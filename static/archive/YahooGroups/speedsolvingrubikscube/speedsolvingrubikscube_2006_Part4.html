    Find a venue and some friends to help out. The rest is just contacting
        other cubers, trying to get a number of how many can attend, and hope
        that not too many say they can attend, but then back out. As for
        equipment, such as timers, those can be borrowed or you can ask other
        people who have them to bring them. But first, find a possible venue.

    Dave, (and the rest of the group) I am definitely not the most
        experienced organizer in this group, but I have done it none the less,
        so I figured I would answer the questions you have asked. As far as
        cost, I was able to use the meeting facilities in the hotel that I work
        for, so I was not charged a fee for the room. I know that not everyone
        is as fortunate as I am, or perhaps the CalTech guys are in acquiring
        venue space. However, I noticed that at the Barnes and Nobles bookstore
        here in my city, they have space set aside for groups of Scrabble
        players to get together and have meetings and tournaments. I don't
        believe they are charged for this, and so that might be something that
        you can check out. Also, seek out local Science Centers and ask for
        their help. They probably won't charge anything, since it will draw
        attention to their facility. However, if there is a cost incurred, you
        can attempt to make up for that by charging a participation fee. Before
        anything though, you really should talk with other cubers in the general
        area of where you want to hold the competition, and see when the best
        time to hold the event will be. Come up with a list of at least 10
        competitors and go from there. I don't believe that the number of
        spectators is as important, as long as there is something there
        watching, that way there is more of a sense of pressure. When I held my
        competition, I only had two stackmats. One was mine, and the other was
        provided by Chris Hunt. Due to our small number of competitors, this was
        ok. Now, nearly ever cuber has a stackmat, and would more than likely be
        willing to lend it to the competition. As far as the tournament
        displays, I think that Speedstacks has been generous in loaning
        equipment out for these events. This was the case in Tennessee. (And
        with some of the CalTech events I think) Send them a request. The worst
        they can do is say no. As far as the delegate, it doesn't
        necessarily have to be a board member, just another cuber who is willing
        to be the main judge, and can be trusted by the WCA to follow all of the
        rules. Let me know if I can answer anything else, and best of luck.

    Bob, Thanks for recalling those posts. Perhaps we can re-create a poll
        and take a new tally of where people would want this held. Anyone have
        any suggestions? Also, Tyson, do you think we can make this happen early
        next summer, before Worlds, and make a thing every other year, or at
        least give it a try? Please let me know on that. I'm sure we can
        gather up at least 20 solid cubers from around the nation to join, not
        counting all the locals that would possibly come. Patrick ----- Original

        opportunites so far for competitions. &gt; &gt; Despite living in a less

        competitions since I started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not too far like

        &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near future, &gt; &gt;
        especailly for this continent to equal Europe in number of &gt; &gt;
        competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wouldn't mind seeing
        competitions closer to south-central US like &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly
        more north. NJ is kinda hard to get to, but it &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst.
        I'm just glad that we are getting a steady in- &gt; &gt; flux of new
        cubers and cubers that are willing to organize &gt; &gt; competitions for us.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds like
        something from &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I think it should be
        somewhere *other than &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US cubers not on either
        coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need to lower the startup
        "costs" for a person &gt; &gt; new at running tournaments to do so.
        Even if we will be needing a &gt; &gt; WCA delagate to be the only one
        trusted, and have them bring the &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule
        based on expected turn-out. A single &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of
        in-community knowledge and a few months of &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience
        *should* be encouraged to set up a tournament &gt; &gt; where there are none.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. Planning
        a tourn. &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to see
        it though, &gt; &gt; especially students. But at the samt time it is college
        studets that &gt; &gt; have the most resources availible to them, in terms of
        FUNDING and &gt; &gt; VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we
        end up putting all our &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or running
        enough tournaments. &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to personally
        addressed by the same &gt; &gt; people who complain that there are not enough
        tournments for them. &gt; &gt; And as a whole, we need to be offering the
        proper incentives for &gt; &gt; people to help. Now Europe...., they seem to

        cubing group] Re: US Open / Worlds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy
        with the opportunites so far for competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a
        less popular cubing area, Detroit, I still &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get in 6
        competitions since I started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not too far
        like NJ, and I have the travel time availible &gt; &gt; &gt; to me, than I just
        spend a little over $100 to do a roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; ride. A flight to
        CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these &gt; days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me
        happy too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think that another minor one should be held
        in Toronto (or &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in
        the near future, &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal Europe in
        number of &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        wouldn't mind seeing competitions closer to south-central US like &gt;
        &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get to, &gt; but
        it &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm just glad that we are getting a
        steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new cubers and cubers that are willing to
        organize &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a
        "US Open" (btw, that sounds like something from &gt; &gt; &gt;
        golf/tennis to me), then I think it should be somewhere *other than &gt; &gt;
        &gt; CA* to be fair to the US cubers not on either coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Mainly, I think we need to lower the startup "costs" for a
        person &gt; &gt; &gt; new at running tournaments to do so. Even if we will be
        needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; WCA delagate to be the only one trusted, and have them
        bring the &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule based on expected
        turn-out. A single &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge
        and a few months of &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to
        set up a tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm
        sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. Planning a &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to see it &gt; though, &gt;
        &gt; &gt; especially students. But at the samt time it is college studets &gt;
        that &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most resources availible to them, in terms of
        FUNDING and &gt; &gt; &gt; VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch,
        and we end up putting all our &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or
        running enough tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to
        personally addressed by the same &gt; &gt; &gt; people who complain that there
        are not enough tournments for them. &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a whole, we need to be
        offering the proper incentives for &gt; &gt; &gt; people to help. Now Europe....,
        they seem to have their act &gt; &gt; &gt; together. I never hear anyone complain
        anymore that they don't have &gt; &gt; &gt; enough tourns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug

    Let me share my thoughts on this. I live in NY, so I will be giving my
        thoughts from the perspective of...well, a northeasterner. The two most
        recent northeastern contests were Trumbull + Rutgers Spring. Between the
        two, there were 31 competitors (okay, I'm only counting 3x3
        competitors for time's sake). 7 went to both (22.6%). Of the 31, 4
        (me, Craig, Bob, Bruce) went to Nationals, which is 12.9%. Now
        let's look at Caltech Spring + San Diego. Those were probably the
        two biggest spring contests in California. 80 competitors total, with 23
        at both (28.8%). 26 of the 80 competitors were at nationals, which is
        32.5%. So what's my point? Less people are going to travel across
        the country to go to a contest. About the same percentage travelled
        within their region on the East and West Coasts, but very few travelled
        across the country for Nationals. Am I saying have the US Open on the
        east coast? No. There's less of a cubing population out here. What
        I am saying, though, is that a multi-site idea is the way to go. That
        way, every region (west coast, east coast, midwest, etc.) can go to its
        most convenient location. Sure, people will have to travel, but really
        not as much as if it's just in, say, Denver. Another argument
        against a single location is Worlds. People who are going to go to
        Hungary a few months later aren't going to want to go across the
        country. So if we have a bunch of sites, where? Here's my proposal:
        West Coast at Caltech or Exploratorium, East Coast at Rutgers or in DC,
        and then somewhere in the Midwest--I don't know where, someone else
        should propose something. That's pretty much all I have to say. I
        don't like the idea of having a poll just yet--let's get some
        discussion flowing before a private ballot. Tim

        go &gt; across the country. I just wanted to pitch in my two cents, in case
        anyone else is in the same boat as me. Personally I think the idea of a
        biyearly US-Open is a wonderful idea, and I like the idea of having it
        in the same year as Worlds for many reasons, such as for those who
        can't make it to Worlds, or for those able to go to both Worlds and
        the US Open. Also a Euro Open would be really cool if that is something
        that could be worked out too, though that is just my opinion. As for me,
        I am absolutley 100% going to Hungary for the Worlds in 2007, and I
        won't really be able to travel or do anything else besides that as
        far as cubing goes because I'm mostly broke and want to be
        absolutely certain I can make it to Europe. So personally I think the US
        Open is a great idea, but there's no way I'd be able to make
        it. I have to save literally all of my money for Hungary or there's
        no way I'll be able to afford it. I'll try to make a US-Open
        in the future, but definitely I cannot make it to one in 2007. :-( Chris

    I've never been there (Denver) and would love to go! They hold
        national (maybe intl?) Speedstacks competitions there. I've been to
        LA and SF and don't look forward to going again. Although SF seems
        to be much nicer than LA in terms of weather... I think Seattle would be
        lovely too. I haven't been to one in NYC, so that would be another
        place I'd be interested in seeing more of. I could also go for
        Idaho if someone gave me a better description of what kinda sights and
        sounds that has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural
        environment. I am okay with DC, but there isn't anyone there that
        can host a comp for us there (that I know of at least). I feel that
        Denver is the most central location so that is one of top choices. If we
        Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in Seattle that would be
        great too. For something like Nationals with an expected high turn-out
        you can't go wrong with Idaho if Frank is willing to put some time
        and effort into hosting again. I am not sure how many cubers are in and
        around the Chicago area, but I don't think enough. Michigan cubers
        are too far spread or too involved in school lately (oh and one left
        this year). If it is in Toronto, I would be willing to go and act as a
        WCA delagate if necessary... hem I wonder if I'm allowed to??? I
        know the rules pretty well, and spent a fair amount of free-time pouring
        over them to find things to debate about. I guess I should ask before I
        make any promises. I have not been to Toronto in many years... OMG it
        was WC03! I've been there at least 10 times in the past but never
        stayed long enough to see all the things I wanted to see. If Patterson
        has time I think we could do a second Midwest tournament very
        successfully. I was very happy with the way the TN one was run, although
        a big part of it must have been Chris. It takes more than a single
        individual to make something like that run smoothly. If somebody, say
        Jon, Jake (retired?), or me coordinates with Patterson we could get that
        going for either Madison, WI or Chicago, with at least two cubers from
        MI gurenteed to go. Although I have no idea how busy he is, and I got
        the idea Jon is quite busy these days. How do ppl feel about Madison, WI
        btw? I don't recall this ever being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann
        Arbor, MI (40 minutes away)? Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to
        sneak a peak at AMD's facilities while I'm there! Also any
        chance of a TX tournament? Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin? -Doug ---

        competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a less popular cubing area,

        the travel time &gt; availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me, than I just spend a little
        over $100 to do a roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ride. A flight to CA seems to be
        costing me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me happy too.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think that another minor one should be held in
        Toronto (or &gt; &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time
        in the near future, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal

        are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If
        there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds like something &gt;
        from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I think it should be somewhere
        *other &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US cubers not on either
        coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need to lower the startup
        "costs" for a person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at running tournaments to do
        so. Even if we will be needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WCA delagate to be the only one
        trusted, and have them bring the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule
        based on expected turn-out. A &gt; single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of
        in-community knowledge and a few months of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience
        *should* be encouraged to set up a tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are
        none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like
        I do. Planning a &gt; &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding
        not enough time to see it &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But
        at the samt time it is college studets &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most
        resources availible to them, in terms of FUNDING &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; VENUE. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end up putting
        all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or running enough
        tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to personally
        addressed by the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who complain that there are not
        enough tournments for &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a whole, we need to be
        offering the proper incentives for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to help. Now
        Europe...., they seem to have their act &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together. I never hear
        anyone complain anymore that they don't &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough
        tourns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Lovely! This is precisely the types of questions and discussion I wanted
        to see. I do see your point here. Nobody writes tutorials on how to
        host. It's almost like it's a hidden secret that people horde
        in order to maximize their own publicity value. I'm sure
        that's not the case buy it's how it feels to me and probably
        many others who have wanted to host something but haven't been able
        to work it out. Among which, 100% of the time it's just thier own
        time commitment issues they failed to properly account for I'm
        sure. If you want desparately enough for something to happen and have
        enough time to do something about it but haven't then we only have
        ourselves to blame. There are many people who have miraculaously pulled
        these things off on their first try, including Greenwood, Burton, Pelly,
        Patterson, and the list goes on... I'm sure none of them have the
        support that the Caltech group has or the resources that Frank has. What
        you do need is enthusiasm. It is rather unfortuante that a majority of
        people who have been around as long as I have lost motivation for such
        things... and many just retire from cubing all together. What we as a
        community need are the poeple that are peaking in enthusism, and even if
        there is only one in the area, enough communication, guidance, and
        suggestions from other cubers will go along way to cooking up a
        successful competition. It is a bit sad, but true that turn-out depends
        so highly on how many "high-profile" cubers will be there. You
        pretty much have to start off with working the inital plan to
        suit/attract 1-3 such cubers. There is undoubtedly some bargaining
        involved. If you are a student at a big university that it is very much
        possible to get school funding for such things. They do set aside a bit
        of moeny for clubs and that sort of thing. You bascialy have to plan
        around likely exam intervals. It would be horrible to have soemting the
        second week of December or of April for example... **IF** you're
        targetting college cubers. If you are targetting HS cubers then
        you'd have to stay away from late-May, early-June. The first or
        second week of June would be graduation for most high schools. It is a
        tradition to do it on a Saturday morning, and that seems to make the
        most sense. You bascially have to pack everything into a very short
        time. Say 5 hours on some Saturday morning. It is a good idea to contact
        hosts o that side of the continent just to make sure nobody else has
        already monopolized that weekend of course.... cuz you don't want
        to step on anybody else's toes. The very first thing to do is
        select a venue. Ideally bring a digital camera and take pictures of
        candidate rooms/auditoriums/large lecture halls/stages. Do this from
        multiple angles for each venue possibility. Then e-mail them to people
        that have hosting experience to critique. You'd be supried at how
        many places offer a free (or very negligiable priced) venue. This is of
        course provided that you A) reserve it well in advanced, and B) let them
        hold on to a fairly hefty security-deposit. Good candidates as others
        have already mentioned are: large schools, science museums (you could
        even talk to the Toronto Science Center, and remind them of WC03 and get
        some details about that and what they would be willing to offer), large
        bookstores (multi-story ones), and any other sort of major attraction in
        the city. Well the Sky Dome might be a bit exessive (I've been on
        the turf there, btw!), but I would suspect that the CN Tower would be
        willing to make you a reasonable offer. Definately do your hw on a place
        first, and also take some time to think about and prepare what you are
        going to say, what points they will bring up, and how you are going to
        counter. Just remember, the worst that can do is say no. (I know I just
        typed the exact same thing as some other respose but it's SO true.)
        It might be fun to get different venues competing with each other to
        give you the best deal too, by quoting other offers :). Although that is
        a bit advanced to pull off correctly. Well if nothing else, then try a
        hotel. That would at least make it easier on the non-locals that choose
        to stay at that hotel. -Doug --- In

        couple &gt; competitions (one very big, one fairly small), so I know what
        it looks &gt; and feels like from a competitor's perspective, but I
        have no clue &gt; about what it actually means to organize it. For example:
        &gt; &gt; What should one expect the event to cost? &gt; How does one pay for all
        these costs? &gt; How do you estimate the number of expected competitors? &gt;
        How do you estimate the number of expected spectators? &gt; How do you know
        the proper time to hold the event so you get the &gt; maximum turn out? &gt;
        How and where do you get all the required equipment? &gt; How do you ensure
        it will be sanctioned by the WCA (i.e. what if a &gt; delegate doesn't
        want to make the trip)? &gt; &gt; I am very interested in putting together a
        competition here in the &gt; Toronto area to help the cubing community, and
        to give back for all &gt; the competitions us few Canadians have attended.
        But I really don't &gt; know how to go about organizing it all. Others
        have done it, and &gt; surely made mistakes that new organizers can learn
        from. We are all &gt; about sharing information in this community, but it
        hasn't seemed to &gt; extend to this aspect yet. Any help, advice or
        answers to the &gt; aforementioned questions would be appreciated. &gt; &gt; &gt;

    I must say, that there isn't much of a perk to seeing me in my
        natural environment. Idaho isn't all that exciting when compared to
        places like San Francisco, LA, or New York. However, there are places
        that are neat, if you like the outdoors. As far as another competition,
        I am still more than willing and able to host another event. I still
        have all of the resources necessary, and just need serious competitors.
        Interest is growing a bit here, which will help out, but like Doug said,
        it is always nice to have as many high profile cubers as possible. Also,
        if Chris Hunt were ever interested, I would be willing to help out with
        any planning and execution of an event in Seattle. I have family up
        there that would be willing to help as well. I also agree that Denver
        could be a very nice option, if there was anyone willing to put in some
        work. Frank d_funny007 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote: I've
        never been there (Denver) and would love to go! They hold national
        (maybe intl?) Speedstacks competitions there. I've been to LA and
        SF and don't look forward to going again. Although SF seems to be
        much nicer than LA in terms of weather... I think Seattle would be
        lovely too. I haven't been to one in NYC, so that would be another
        place I'd be interested in seeing more of. I could also go for
        Idaho if someone gave me a better description of what kinda sights and
        sounds that has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural
        environment. I am okay with DC, but there isn't anyone there that
        can host a comp for us there (that I know of at least). I feel that
        Denver is the most central location so that is one of top choices. If we
        Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in Seattle that would be
        great too. For something like Nationals with an expected high turn-out
        you can't go wrong with Idaho if Frank is willing to put some time
        and effort into hosting again. I am not sure how many cubers are in and
        around the Chicago area, but I don't think enough. Michigan cubers
        are too far spread or too involved in school lately (oh and one left
        this year). If it is in Toronto, I would be willing to go and act as a
        WCA delagate if necessary... hem I wonder if I'm allowed to??? I
        know the rules pretty well, and spent a fair amount of free-time pouring
        over them to find things to debate about. I guess I should ask before I
        make any promises. I have not been to Toronto in many years... OMG it
        was WC03! I've been there at least 10 times in the past but never
        stayed long enough to see all the things I wanted to see. If Patterson
        has time I think we could do a second Midwest tournament very
        successfully. I was very happy with the way the TN one was run, although
        a big part of it must have been Chris. It takes more than a single
        individual to make something like that run smoothly. If somebody, say
        Jon, Jake (retired?), or me coordinates with Patterson we could get that
        going for either Madison, WI or Chicago, with at least two cubers from
        MI gurenteed to go. Although I have no idea how busy he is, and I got
        the idea Jon is quite busy these days. How do ppl feel about Madison, WI
        btw? I don't recall this ever being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann
        Arbor, MI (40 minutes away)? Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to
        sneak a peak at AMD's facilities while I'm there! Also any
        chance of a TX tournament? Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin? -Doug ---

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy with the opportunites so far for
        competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a less popular cubing area,
        Detroit, I still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get in 6 competitions since I
        started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not too far like NJ, and I have
        the travel time &gt; availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me, than I just spend a little
        over $100 to do a roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ride. A flight to CA seems to be
        costing me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me happy too.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think that another minor one should be held in
        Toronto (or &gt; &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time
        in the near future, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal
        Europe in number of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I wouldn't mind seeing competitions closer to south- central US &gt;
        like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get
        to, &gt; &gt; but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm just glad that we
        are getting a &gt; steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new cubers and cubers that
        are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If
        there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds like something &gt;
        from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I think it should be somewhere
        *other &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US cubers not on either
        coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need to lower the startup
        "costs" for a person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at running tournaments to do
        so. Even if we will be needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WCA delagate to be the only one
        trusted, and have them bring the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule
        based on expected turn-out. A &gt; single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of
        in-community knowledge and a few months of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience
        *should* be encouraged to set up a tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are
        none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like
        I do. Planning a &gt; &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding
        not enough time to see it &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But
        at the samt time it is college studets &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most
        resources availible to them, in terms of FUNDING &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; VENUE. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end up putting
        all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or running enough
        tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to personally
        addressed by the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who complain that there are not
        enough tournments for &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a whole, we need to be
        offering the proper incentives for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to help. Now
        Europe...., they seem to have their act &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together. I never hear
        anyone complain anymore that they don't &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough
        tourns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Thanks Frank! Is anyone here interested in coming up to Seattle for a
        tournament? My dad has been wanting to help with a tournament for years,
        so if people can actually make it up here then it can definitely be
        done! All we need is enough interested people, -Chris On 10/4/06, Frank

        much of a perk to seeing me in my natural &gt; environment. Idaho

        Francisco, LA, or New York. However, there are places that are neat, if
        you &gt; like the outdoors. &gt; &gt; As far as another competition, I am still
        more than willing and able to &gt; host another event. I still have all of
        the resources necessary, and just &gt; need serious competitors. Interest
        is growing a bit here, which will help &gt; out, but like Doug said, it is
        always nice to have as many high profile &gt; cubers as possible. Also, if
        Chris Hunt were ever interested, I would be &gt; willing to help out with
        any planning and execution of an event in Seattle. &gt; I have family up
        there that would be willing to help as well. I also agree &gt; that Denver
        could be a very nice option, if there was anyone willing to put &gt; in
        some work. &gt; &gt; Frank &gt; &gt; &gt; d_funny007 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com

        too. &gt; &gt; I haven't been to one in NYC, so that would be another
        place I'd be &gt; interested in seeing more of. I could also go for
        Idaho if someone &gt; gave me a better description of what kinda sights and
        sounds that &gt; has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural
        environment. I &gt; am okay with DC, but there isn't anyone there that
        can host a comp &gt; for us there (that I know of at least). &gt; &gt; I feel
        that Denver is the most central location so that is one of &gt; top
        choices. If we Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in &gt; Seattle
        that would be great too. For something like Nationals with &gt; an expected
        high turn-out you can't go wrong with Idaho if Frank is &gt; willing
        to put some time and effort into hosting again. &gt; &gt; I am not sure how
        many cubers are in and around the Chicago area, &gt; but I don't think
        enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too &gt; involved in school
        lately (oh and one left this year). &gt; &gt; If it is in Toronto, I would be
        willing to go and act as a WCA &gt; delagate if necessary... hem I wonder
        if I'm allowed to??? I know &gt; the rules pretty well, and spent a
        fair amount of free-time pouring &gt; over them to find things to debate
        about. I guess I should ask &gt; before I make any promises. I have not
        been to Toronto in many &gt; years... OMG it was WC03! I've been there
        at least 10 times in the &gt; past but never stayed long enough to see all
        the things I wanted to &gt; see. &gt; &gt; If Patterson has time I think we could
        do a second Midwest &gt; tournament very successfully. I was very happy
        with the way the TN &gt; one was run, although a big part of it must have
        been Chris. It &gt; takes more than a single individual to make something
        like that run &gt; smoothly. If somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me
        coordinates &gt; with Patterson we could get that going for either Madison,
        WI or &gt; Chicago, with at least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go.
        Although &gt; I have no idea how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is
        quite busy &gt; these days. &gt; &gt; How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I
        don't recall this ever &gt; being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor,
        MI (40 minutes away)? &gt; &gt; Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to
        sneak a peak at AMD's &gt; facilities while I'm there! Also any
        chance of a TX tournament? &gt; Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin? &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Centrally located does not imply a better turnout. I think &gt; if it was
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; held in Colorado, there would be about 10 people there. It &gt;
        should &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitely be held somewhere that people actually live.

        Worlds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy with the
        opportunites so far for &gt; competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a
        less popular cubing area, Detroit, I &gt; still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get in
        6 competitions since I started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not
        too far like NJ, and I have the travel time &gt; &gt; availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
        me, than I just spend a little over $100 to do a &gt; roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ride. A flight to CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; &gt;
        days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me happy too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do
        think that another minor one should be held in &gt; Toronto (or &gt; &gt; &gt; some
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near &gt;
        future, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal Europe in
        number of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        wouldn't mind seeing competitions closer to south- &gt; central US &gt; &gt;
        like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get
        &gt; to, &gt; &gt; &gt; but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm just glad
        that we are getting a &gt; &gt; steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new cubers and
        cubers that are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds
        like &gt; something &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I think it
        should be somewhere &gt; *other &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US
        cubers not on either coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need
        to lower the startup "costs" for a &gt; person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at
        running tournaments to do so. Even if we will be &gt; needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        WCA delagate to be the only one trusted, and have them &gt; bring the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule based on expected turn-out. &gt; A &gt; &gt;
        single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge and a few
        &gt; months of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set
        up a &gt; tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. &gt; Planning a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to
        see &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But at the samt
        time it is college &gt; studets &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most
        resources availible to them, in terms of &gt; FUNDING &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end
        up putting &gt; all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or
        running enough &gt; tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to
        personally addressed by &gt; the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who complain that
        there are not enough tournments &gt; for &gt; &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a
        whole, we need to be offering the proper &gt; incentives for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        people to help. Now Europe...., they seem to have their &gt; act &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        together. I never hear anyone complain anymore that they &gt; don't &gt;
        &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough tourns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    You give a country designation here but not in the spreadsheet. I think
        that should be included in the spreadsheet too. So this is a very good
        idea, I really like it, especially that I'm ranked 29th on a world
        listing of any sort. Beaten by Craig by one rank again... tisk tisk... I
        think my weakest area would have to be 3x3. This needs to change soon.

        4x4x, and 5x5x5 events in WCA recognised &gt; competitions. &gt; &gt; I simply
        added up their total ranks for each of the 3 events, and then &gt; sorted
        by the lowest combined ranking total. The results are quite &gt; nice, and
        I think a good indicator of who is achieving the most as a &gt; cubing
        "all-rounder". &gt; &gt; The top 10 in the world? &gt; &gt; 1. Lars

        However, there are places that are neat, if you &gt; like the outdoors. &gt; &gt;
        As far as another competition, I am still more than willing and able to
        &gt; host another event. I still have all of the resources necessary, and
        just &gt; need serious competitors. Interest is growing a bit here, which
        will help &gt; out, but like Doug said, it is always nice to have as many
        high profile &gt; cubers as possible. Also, if Chris Hunt were ever
        interested, I would be &gt; willing to help out with any planning and
        execution of an event in Seattle. &gt; I have family up there that would be
        willing to help as well. I also agree &gt; that Denver could be a very nice
        option, if there was anyone willing to put &gt; in some work. &gt; &gt; Frank &gt; &gt;

        too. &gt; &gt; I haven't been to one in NYC, so that would be another
        place I'd be &gt; interested in seeing more of. I could also go for
        Idaho if someone &gt; gave me a better description of what kinda sights and
        sounds that &gt; has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural
        environment. I &gt; am okay with DC, but there isn't anyone there that
        can host a comp &gt; for us there (that I know of at least). &gt; &gt; I feel
        that Denver is the most central location so that is one of &gt; top
        choices. If we Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in &gt; Seattle
        that would be great too. For something like Nationals with &gt; an expected
        high turn-out you can't go wrong with Idaho if Frank is &gt; willing
        to put some time and effort into hosting again. &gt; &gt; I am not sure how
        many cubers are in and around the Chicago area, &gt; but I don't think
        enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too &gt; involved in school
        lately (oh and one left this year). &gt; &gt; If it is in Toronto, I would be
        willing to go and act as a WCA &gt; delagate if necessary... hem I wonder
        if I'm allowed to??? I know &gt; the rules pretty well, and spent a
        fair amount of free-time pouring &gt; over them to find things to debate
        about. I guess I should ask &gt; before I make any promises. I have not
        been to Toronto in many &gt; years... OMG it was WC03! I've been there
        at least 10 times in the &gt; past but never stayed long enough to see all
        the things I wanted to &gt; see. &gt; &gt; If Patterson has time I think we could
        do a second Midwest &gt; tournament very successfully. I was very happy
        with the way the TN &gt; one was run, although a big part of it must have
        been Chris. It &gt; takes more than a single individual to make something
        like that run &gt; smoothly. If somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me
        coordinates &gt; with Patterson we could get that going for either Madison,
        WI or &gt; Chicago, with at least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go.
        Although &gt; I have no idea how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is
        quite busy &gt; these days. &gt; &gt; How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I
        don't recall this ever &gt; being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor,
        MI (40 minutes away)? &gt; &gt; Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to
        sneak a peak at AMD's &gt; facilities while I'm there! Also any
        chance of a TX tournament? &gt; Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin? &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Centrally located does not imply a better turnout. I think &gt; if it was
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; held in Colorado, there would be about 10 people there. It &gt;
        should &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitely be held somewhere that people actually live.

        we would want it to be centrally &gt; located. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Somewhere in central
        Texas, or maybe Colorado, or Kansas. &gt; Anyone &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have any ideas on

        Worlds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy with the
        opportunites so far for &gt; competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a
        less popular cubing area, Detroit, I &gt; still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get in
        6 competitions since I started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not
        too far like NJ, and I have the travel time &gt; &gt; availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
        me, than I just spend a little over $100 to do a &gt; roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ride. A flight to CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; &gt;
        days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me happy too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do
        think that another minor one should be held in &gt; Toronto (or &gt; &gt; &gt; some
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near &gt;
        future, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal Europe in
        number of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        wouldn't mind seeing competitions closer to south- &gt; central US &gt; &gt;
        like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get
        &gt; to, &gt; &gt; &gt; but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm just glad
        that we are getting a &gt; &gt; steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new cubers and
        cubers that are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds
        like &gt; something &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I think it
        should be somewhere &gt; *other &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US
        cubers not on either coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need
        to lower the startup "costs" for a &gt; person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at
        running tournaments to do so. Even if we will be &gt; needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        WCA delagate to be the only one trusted, and have them &gt; bring the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule based on expected turn-out. &gt; A &gt; &gt;
        single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge and a few
        &gt; months of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set
        up a &gt; tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. &gt; Planning a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to
        see &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But at the samt
        time it is college &gt; studets &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most
        resources availible to them, in terms of &gt; FUNDING &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end
        up putting &gt; all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or
        running enough &gt; tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to
        personally addressed by &gt; the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who complain that
        there are not enough tournments &gt; for &gt; &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a
        whole, we need to be offering the proper &gt; incentives for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        people to help. Now Europe...., they seem to have their &gt; act &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        together. I never hear anyone complain anymore that they &gt; don't &gt;
        &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough tourns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Yes, I think our idea has been to try to host a major tournament in the
        United States every summer. In 2004, we had US Nationals in Pasadena. In
        2005, we had a summer tournament in Dallas, and in 2006 we had US
        Nationals in San Francisco. So we'll get to work on finding
        something for summer of 2007 that's in the summer so hopefully more
        convenient for everyone to travel to. 20 competitors would be an
        especially week tournament, especially for a major summer competition
        that was held as an US Open. Pasadena competitions get about 60
        people... so if we do pull off something like this, I think we'd
        want to be expecting about 50 cubers at least. This gives you an idea of
        the possible locations of a competition. -Tyson On 10/4/06, Frank Morris

        must say, that there isn't much of a perk to seeing me in my

        compared to places like &gt; San &gt; &gt; Francisco, LA, or New York. However,
        there are places that are neat, if &gt; you &gt; &gt; like the outdoors. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        As far as another competition, I am still more than willing and able to
        &gt; &gt; host another event. I still have all of the resources necessary, and
        &gt; just &gt; &gt; need serious competitors. Interest is growing a bit here,
        which will &gt; help &gt; &gt; out, but like Doug said, it is always nice to have
        as many high profile &gt; &gt; cubers as possible. Also, if Chris Hunt were
        ever interested, I would be &gt; &gt; willing to help out with any planning
        and execution of an event in &gt; Seattle. &gt; &gt; I have family up there that
        would be willing to help as well. I also &gt; agree &gt; &gt; that Denver could

        weather... I &gt; &gt; think Seattle would be lovely too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        haven't been to one in NYC, so that would be another place I'd
        be &gt; &gt; interested in seeing more of. I could also go for Idaho if
        someone &gt; &gt; gave me a better description of what kinda sights and sounds
        that &gt; &gt; has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural
        environment. I &gt; &gt; am okay with DC, but there isn't anyone there
        that can host a comp &gt; &gt; for us there (that I know of at least). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I feel that Denver is the most central location so that is one of &gt; &gt;
        top choices. If we Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in &gt; &gt;
        Seattle that would be great too. For something like Nationals with &gt; &gt;
        an expected high turn-out you can't go wrong with Idaho if Frank is
        &gt; &gt; willing to put some time and effort into hosting again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am
        not sure how many cubers are in and around the Chicago area, &gt; &gt; but I
        don't think enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too &gt; &gt;
        involved in school lately (oh and one left this year). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is
        in Toronto, I would be willing to go and act as a WCA &gt; &gt; delagate if
        necessary... hem I wonder if I'm allowed to??? I know &gt; &gt; the rules
        pretty well, and spent a fair amount of free-time pouring &gt; &gt; over them
        to find things to debate about. I guess I should ask &gt; &gt; before I make
        any promises. I have not been to Toronto in many &gt; &gt; years... OMG it was
        WC03! I've been there at least 10 times in the &gt; &gt; past but never
        stayed long enough to see all the things I wanted to &gt; &gt; see. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If
        Patterson has time I think we could do a second Midwest &gt; &gt; tournament
        very successfully. I was very happy with the way the TN &gt; &gt; one was run,
        although a big part of it must have been Chris. It &gt; &gt; takes more than a
        single individual to make something like that run &gt; &gt; smoothly. If
        somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me coordinates &gt; &gt; with Patterson
        we could get that going for either Madison, WI or &gt; &gt; Chicago, with at
        least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go. Although &gt; &gt; I have no idea
        how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is quite busy &gt; &gt; these days. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I don't recall this ever
        &gt; &gt; being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor, MI (40 minutes away)? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to sneak a peak at AMD's
        &gt; &gt; facilities while I'm there! Also any chance of a TX tournament?

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy with the opportunites so far for &gt; &gt; competitions.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a less popular cubing area, Detroit, I &gt; &gt;
        still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get in 6 competitions since I started
        cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not too far like NJ, and I have
        the travel time &gt; &gt; &gt; availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me, than I just spend a
        little over $100 to do a &gt; &gt; roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ride. A flight to
        CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        that makes me happy too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think that another
        minor one should be held in &gt; &gt; Toronto (or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near &gt; &gt; future, &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal Europe in number of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        wouldn't mind seeing competitions closer to south- &gt; &gt; central US &gt;
        &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard
        to get &gt; &gt; to, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm
        just glad that we are getting a &gt; &gt; &gt; steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new
        cubers and cubers that are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions
        for us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a "US Open"
        (btw, that sounds like &gt; &gt; something &gt; &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis
        to me), then I think it should be somewhere &gt; &gt; *other &gt; &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US cubers not on either coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need to lower the startup "costs"
        for a &gt; &gt; person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at running tournaments to do so. Even
        if we will be &gt; &gt; needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WCA delagate to be the only one
        trusted, and have them &gt; &gt; bring the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the
        schedule based on expected turn-out. &gt; &gt; A &gt; &gt; &gt; single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge and a few &gt; &gt; months of &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set up a &gt; &gt;
        tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. &gt; &gt; Planning a &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding not enough
        time to see &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But
        at the samt time it is college &gt; &gt; studets &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have
        the most resources availible to them, in terms of &gt; &gt; FUNDING &gt; &gt; &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive
        bunch, and we end up putting &gt; &gt; all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school
        and not going to or running enough &gt; &gt; tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
        fundemental issue needs to personally addressed by &gt; &gt; the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; people who complain that there are not enough tournments &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt;
        &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a whole, we need to be offering the proper &gt;
        &gt; incentives for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to help. Now Europe...., they seem
        to have their &gt; &gt; act &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together. I never hear anyone complain
        anymore that they &gt; &gt; don't &gt; &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough tourns. &gt;

    Don't you think you should weigh the different averages ? Because
        if you average 25 in the 3x3, it only makes a difference of 10 seconds
        with someone who averages 15. But the level difference is quite huge.
        But on the 4x4 and especially the 5x5, a 10 second different is a lot
        less important. Do you see what I mean ? Would it be possible to solve
        that problem (if you think it is a problem of course :p) ? Gilles.

        country designation here but not in the spreadsheet. I &gt; think that
        should be included in the spreadsheet too. So this is a &gt; very good
        idea, I really like it, especially that I'm ranked 29th on &gt; a
        world listing of any sort. &gt; &gt; Beaten by Craig by one rank again... tisk

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as a little bit of fun, I decided to make a combined world &gt;
        &gt; rankings list. There have been 48 cubers this year who have posted &gt; &gt;
        averages in each of 3x3x3, 4x4x, and 5x5x5 events in WCA recognised &gt; &gt;
        competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I simply added up their total ranks for each of
        the 3 events, and &gt; then &gt; &gt; sorted by the lowest combined ranking

    Hi Gilles, I understand what you are saying of course, but personally, I
        don't think it's a problem. The only thing that is taken into
        account is how good you are compared to all the other people in the
        list, what your times are in the various events are not important. Dan

    Okay, looks like we have some good ideas spreading. I will make a poll
        soon and people can vote for the best city. I will just list a bunch of
        cities and see where the votes go. I am thinking that this event would
        go on in the early summer, maybe sometime in June, this way there will
        be a little time between this and the Worlds. I understand that the
        Worlds does indeed put a lot pressure on the pocket, and some people
        won't be able to attend both. However, for those who
        don't/can't attend Worlds, I think another event is a great
        idea so those people can compete yearly. I will post here soon with a
        poll. Patrick ----- Original Message ----- From: Frank

        enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too &gt; involved in school
        lately (oh and one left this year). &gt; &gt; If it is in Toronto, I would be
        willing to go and act as a WCA &gt; delagate if necessary... hem I wonder
        if I'm allowed to??? I know &gt; the rules pretty well, and spent a
        fair amount of free-time pouring &gt; over them to find things to debate
        about. I guess I should ask &gt; before I make any promises. I have not
        been to Toronto in many &gt; years... OMG it was WC03! I've been there
        at least 10 times in the &gt; past but never stayed long enough to see all
        the things I wanted to &gt; see. &gt; &gt; If Patterson has time I think we could
        do a second Midwest &gt; tournament very successfully. I was very happy
        with the way the TN &gt; one was run, although a big part of it must have
        been Chris. It &gt; takes more than a single individual to make something
        like that run &gt; smoothly. If somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me
        coordinates &gt; with Patterson we could get that going for either Madison,
        WI or &gt; Chicago, with at least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go.
        Although &gt; I have no idea how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is
        quite busy &gt; these days. &gt; &gt; How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I
        don't recall this ever &gt; being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor,
        MI (40 minutes away)? &gt; &gt; Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to
        sneak a peak at AMD's &gt; facilities while I'm there! Also any
        chance of a TX tournament? &gt; Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin? &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Bob, &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for recalling those posts. Perhaps we can re-create
        a &gt; poll &gt; &gt; and take a new tally of where people would want this held.
        Anyone &gt; &gt; have any suggestions? Also, Tyson, do you think we can make
        this &gt; &gt; happen early next summer, before Worlds, and make a thing every
        &gt; other &gt; &gt; year, or at least give it a try? Please let me know on that.
        I'm &gt; &gt; sure we can gather up at least 20 solid cubers from around
        the &gt; nation &gt; &gt; to join, not counting all the locals that would
        possibly come. &gt; &gt; &gt; Patrick &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &gt;

        &gt; Centrally located does not imply a better turnout. I think &gt; if it was
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; held in Colorado, there would be about 10 people there. It &gt;
        should &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitely be held somewhere that people actually live.

        Worlds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy with the
        opportunites so far for &gt; competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a
        less popular cubing area, Detroit, I &gt; still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get in
        6 competitions since I started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not
        too far like NJ, and I have the travel time &gt; &gt; availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
        me, than I just spend a little over $100 to do a &gt; roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ride. A flight to CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; &gt;
        days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me happy too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do
        think that another minor one should be held in &gt; Toronto (or &gt; &gt; &gt; some
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near &gt;
        future, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal Europe in
        number of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        wouldn't mind seeing competitions closer to south- &gt; central US &gt; &gt;
        like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get
        &gt; to, &gt; &gt; &gt; but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm just glad
        that we are getting a &gt; &gt; steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new cubers and
        cubers that are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds
        like &gt; something &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I think it
        should be somewhere &gt; *other &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US
        cubers not on either coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need
        to lower the startup "costs" for a &gt; person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at
        running tournaments to do so. Even if we will be &gt; needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        WCA delagate to be the only one trusted, and have them &gt; bring the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule based on expected turn-out. &gt; A &gt; &gt;
        single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge and a few
        &gt; months of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set
        up a &gt; tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. &gt; Planning a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to
        see &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But at the samt
        time it is college &gt; studets &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most
        resources availible to them, in terms of &gt; FUNDING &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end
        up putting &gt; all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or
        running enough &gt; tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to
        personally addressed by &gt; the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who complain that
        there are not enough tournments &gt; for &gt; &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a
        whole, we need to be offering the proper &gt; incentives for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        people to help. Now Europe...., they seem to have their &gt; act &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        together. I never hear anyone complain anymore that they &gt; don't &gt;
        &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough tourns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        you need to include *all* events. Though looking at Dan's list it
        seems to be a requirement to have a ranking in every event in order to

    For the list of cities, you might consider St. Louis, MO as a choice. As
        for potential competitiors, I'll talk to my club at school and see
        if we can't get some funds together and try to make a group trip. I
        asked my dad if I would be able to travel and got the all-famous
        response: "we'll see". I think if we got our pennies
        together, we could get a good number from my school to go. We have a
        meeting tomorrow so I'll see what we can do. Rory PJK Sports Cards

        spreading. I will make a poll soon and people can vote for the best
        city. I will just list a bunch of cities and see where the votes go. I
        am thinking that this event would go on in the early summer, maybe
        sometime in June, this way there will be a little time between this and
        the Worlds. I understand that the Worlds does indeed put a lot pressure
        on the pocket, and some people won't be able to attend both.
        However, for those who don't/can't attend Worlds, I think
        another event is a great idea so those people can compete yearly. I will
        post here soon with a poll. Patrick ----- Original Message ----- From:

        there isn't much of a perk to seeing me in my natural &gt;
        environment. Idaho isn't all that exciting when compared to places
        like San &gt; Francisco, LA, or New York. However, there are places that
        are neat, if you &gt; like the outdoors. &gt; &gt; As far as another competition,
        I am still more than willing and able to &gt; host another event. I still
        have all of the resources necessary, and just &gt; need serious
        competitors. Interest is growing a bit here, which will help &gt; out, but
        like Doug said, it is always nice to have as many high profile &gt; cubers
        as possible. Also, if Chris Hunt were ever interested, I would be &gt;
        willing to help out with any planning and execution of an event in
        Seattle. &gt; I have family up there that would be willing to help as well.
        I also agree &gt; that Denver could be a very nice option, if there was
        anyone willing to put &gt; in some work. &gt; &gt; Frank &gt; &gt; &gt; d_funny007

        don't look forward to going again. &gt; Although SF seems to be much
        nicer than LA in terms of weather... I &gt; think Seattle would be lovely
        too. &gt; &gt; I haven't been to one in NYC, so that would be another
        place I'd be &gt; interested in seeing more of. I could also go for
        Idaho if someone &gt; gave me a better description of what kinda sights and
        sounds that &gt; has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural
        environment. I &gt; am okay with DC, but there isn't anyone there that
        can host a comp &gt; for us there (that I know of at least). &gt; &gt; I feel
        that Denver is the most central location so that is one of &gt; top
        choices. If we Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in &gt; Seattle
        that would be great too. For something like Nationals with &gt; an expected
        high turn-out you can't go wrong with Idaho if Frank is &gt; willing
        to put some time and effort into hosting again. &gt; &gt; I am not sure how
        many cubers are in and around the Chicago area, &gt; but I don't think
        enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too &gt; involved in school
        lately (oh and one left this year). &gt; &gt; If it is in Toronto, I would be
        willing to go and act as a WCA &gt; delagate if necessary... hem I wonder
        if I'm allowed to??? I know &gt; the rules pretty well, and spent a
        fair amount of free-time pouring &gt; over them to find things to debate
        about. I guess I should ask &gt; before I make any promises. I have not
        been to Toronto in many &gt; years... OMG it was WC03! I've been there
        at least 10 times in the &gt; past but never stayed long enough to see all
        the things I wanted to &gt; see. &gt; &gt; If Patterson has time I think we could
        do a second Midwest &gt; tournament very successfully. I was very happy
        with the way the TN &gt; one was run, although a big part of it must have
        been Chris. It &gt; takes more than a single individual to make something
        like that run &gt; smoothly. If somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me
        coordinates &gt; with Patterson we could get that going for either Madison,
        WI or &gt; Chicago, with at least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go.
        Although &gt; I have no idea how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is
        quite busy &gt; these days. &gt; &gt; How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I
        don't recall this ever &gt; being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor,
        MI (40 minutes away)? &gt; &gt; Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to
        sneak a peak at AMD's &gt; facilities while I'm there! Also any
        chance of a TX tournament? &gt; Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin? &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Centrally located does not imply a better turnout. I think &gt; if it was
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; held in Colorado, there would be about 10 people there. It &gt;
        should &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitely be held somewhere that people actually live.

        opportunites so far for &gt; competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a
        less popular cubing area, Detroit, I &gt; still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get in
        6 competitions since I started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not
        too far like NJ, and I have the travel time &gt; &gt; availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
        me, than I just spend a little over $100 to do a &gt; roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ride. A flight to CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; &gt;
        days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me happy too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do
        think that another minor one should be held in &gt; Toronto (or &gt; &gt; &gt; some
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near &gt;
        future, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal Europe in
        number of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        wouldn't mind seeing competitions closer to south- &gt; central US &gt; &gt;
        like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get
        &gt; to, &gt; &gt; &gt; but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm just glad
        that we are getting a &gt; &gt; steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new cubers and
        cubers that are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds
        like &gt; something &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I think it
        should be somewhere &gt; *other &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US
        cubers not on either coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need
        to lower the startup "costs" for a &gt; person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at
        running tournaments to do so. Even if we will be &gt; needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        WCA delagate to be the only one trusted, and have them &gt; bring the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule based on expected turn-out. &gt; A &gt; &gt;
        single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge and a few
        &gt; months of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set
        up a &gt; tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. &gt; Planning a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to
        see &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But at the samt
        time it is college &gt; studets &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most
        resources availible to them, in terms of &gt; FUNDING &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end
        up putting &gt; all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or
        running enough &gt; tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to
        personally addressed by &gt; the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who complain that
        there are not enough tournments &gt; for &gt; &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a

        this article a French cuber mailed me:
        http://www.tulsaworld.com/NewsStory.asp?ID=061004_Ne_A2_Propo36352
        "long considered part of the French fabric"
        "France's smoker-friendly culture where cigarettes have long
        been identified with cool, and where smoky bistros are still redoubts of
        Paris' intelligentsia." "Even the French
        presidency's Web site shows a photo of a young President Jacques
        Chirac in a James Dean-like pose with a cigarette in his mouth."
        But I'm glad they seem to go in the right direction. In my report I
        purposely said I won't visit "this" France again, meaning
        if it changes enough I might go there again. In Germany I think smokers
        aren't smoking to become cool but to avoid being uncool. Both
        nonsense of course, as smoking doesn't make you cool but only
        anti-social. But what I mean is that German smokers are just plain dumb
        and smoke because others do it, not because it has a touch of
        intelligentsia. Ok, that maybe still doesn't make it clearer. But I
        don't want to think about it more right now. Stefan

        the early summer, maybe sometime in June, this way there will be a
        little time between this and the Worlds. I understand that the Worlds
        does indeed put a lot pressure on the pocket, and some people won't
        be able to attend both. However, for those who don't/can't

        help &gt; out, but like Doug said, it is always nice to have as many high
        profile &gt; cubers as possible. Also, if Chris Hunt were ever interested,
        I would be &gt; willing to help out with any planning and execution of an

        environment. I &gt; am okay with DC, but there isn't anyone there that
        can host a comp &gt; for us there (that I know of at least). &gt; &gt; I feel
        that Denver is the most central location so that is one of &gt; top
        choices. If we Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in &gt; Seattle
        that would be great too. For something like Nationals with &gt; an expected
        high turn-out you can't go wrong with Idaho if Frank is &gt; willing
        to put some time and effort into hosting again. &gt; &gt; I am not sure how
        many cubers are in and around the Chicago area, &gt; but I don't think
        enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too &gt; involved in school
        lately (oh and one left this year). &gt; &gt; If it is in Toronto, I would be
        willing to go and act as a WCA &gt; delagate if necessary... hem I wonder
        if I'm allowed to??? I know &gt; the rules pretty well, and spent a
        fair amount of free-time pouring &gt; over them to find things to debate
        about. I guess I should ask &gt; before I make any promises. I have not
        been to Toronto in many &gt; years... OMG it was WC03! I've been there
        at least 10 times in the &gt; past but never stayed long enough to see all
        the things I wanted to &gt; see. &gt; &gt; If Patterson has time I think we could
        do a second Midwest &gt; tournament very successfully. I was very happy
        with the way the TN &gt; one was run, although a big part of it must have
        been Chris. It &gt; takes more than a single individual to make something
        like that run &gt; smoothly. If somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me
        coordinates &gt; with Patterson we could get that going for either Madison,
        WI or &gt; Chicago, with at least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go.
        Although &gt; I have no idea how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is
        quite busy &gt; these days. &gt; &gt; How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I
        don't recall this ever &gt; being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor,
        MI (40 minutes away)? &gt; &gt; Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to
        sneak a peak at AMD's &gt; facilities while I'm there! Also any
        chance of a TX tournament? &gt; Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin? &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Centrally located does not imply a better turnout. I think &gt; if it was
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; held in Colorado, there would be about 10 people there. It &gt;
        should &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitely be held somewhere that people actually live.

        Worlds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy with the
        opportunites so far for &gt; competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite living in a
        less popular cubing area, Detroit, I &gt; still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get in
        6 competitions since I started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not
        too far like NJ, and I have the travel time &gt; &gt; availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
        me, than I just spend a little over $100 to do a &gt; roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ride. A flight to CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; &gt;
        days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me happy too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do
        think that another minor one should be held in &gt; Toronto (or &gt; &gt; &gt; some
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near &gt;
        future, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this continent to equal Europe in
        number of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions so far this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        wouldn't mind seeing competitions closer to south- &gt; central US &gt; &gt;
        like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get
        &gt; to, &gt; &gt; &gt; but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm just glad
        that we are getting a &gt; &gt; steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new cubers and
        cubers that are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds
        like &gt; something &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I think it
        should be somewhere &gt; *other &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be fair to the US
        cubers not on either coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mainly, I think we need
        to lower the startup "costs" for a &gt; person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at
        running tournaments to do so. Even if we will be &gt; needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        WCA delagate to be the only one trusted, and have them &gt; bring the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule based on expected turn-out. &gt; A &gt; &gt;
        single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge and a few
        &gt; months of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set
        up a &gt; tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I'm sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. &gt; Planning a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; tourn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to
        see &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But at the samt
        time it is college &gt; studets &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most
        resources availible to them, in terms of &gt; FUNDING &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end
        up putting &gt; all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going to or
        running enough &gt; tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue needs to
        personally addressed by &gt; the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who complain that
        there are not enough tournments &gt; for &gt; &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a
        whole, we need to be offering the proper &gt; incentives for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        people to help. Now Europe...., they seem to have their &gt; act &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        together. I never hear anyone complain anymore that they &gt; don't &gt;
        &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough tourns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Hey Dave, I'll answer these as best as I can based on my
        experience: &gt; What should one expect the event to cost? Rutgers charges
        me $150-200 for rental of the room + equipment (staging, microphone,
        etc) &gt; How does one pay for all these costs? They fund me. I'm on a
        budget. &gt; How do you estimate the number of expected competitors? I base
        that estimate on previous competitions held in the same area. &gt; How do
        you estimate the number of expected spectators? Who cares? People will
        show up to watch. Just make sure you have plenty of chairs (no one will
        want to stand). &gt; How do you know the proper time to hold the event so
        you get the &gt; maximum turn out? I try not to host a competition in the
        same week of another competition around here. That would be silly. Other
        than that, avoid hosting a competition somewhere remote during a busy
        week (ie - maybe exam weeks especially) &gt; How and where do you get all
        the required equipment? Rutges bought them for me and the rest are
        donated. Just ask. &gt; How do you ensure it will be sanctioned by the WCA
        (i.e. what if a &gt; delegate doesn't want to make the trip)? Become
        one. If you're trusted and well-known in the community, I
        don't think this is really a problem. &gt; I am very interested in
        putting together a competition here in the &gt; Toronto area to help the
        cubing community, and to give back for all &gt; the competitions us few
        Canadians have attended. But I really don't &gt; know how to go about
        organizing it all. Others have done it, and &gt; surely made mistakes that
        new organizers can learn from. We are all &gt; about sharing information in
        this community, but it hasn't seemed to &gt; extend to this aspect
        yet. Any help, advice or answers to the &gt; aforementioned questions would
        be appreciated. DONT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE! ~ Bob

        I'll talk to my club at school and see if we &gt; can't get some

        would go on in the &gt; early summer, maybe sometime in June, this way
        there will be a little time &gt; between this and the Worlds. I understand
        that the Worlds does indeed put a &gt; lot pressure on the pocket, and some
        people won't be able to attend both. &gt; However, for those who
        don't/can't attend Worlds, I think another event is a &gt; great
        idea so those people can compete yearly. I will post here soon with a &gt;

        York. However, there are places that are neat, if &gt; you &gt; &gt; like the
        outdoors. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as another competition, I am still more than
        willing and able to &gt; &gt; host another event. I still have all of the
        resources necessary, and &gt; just &gt; &gt; need serious competitors. Interest
        is growing a bit here, which will &gt; help &gt; &gt; out, but like Doug said, it
        is always nice to have as many high profile &gt; &gt; cubers as possible.
        Also, if Chris Hunt were ever interested, I would be &gt; &gt; willing to help
        out with any planning and execution of an event in &gt; Seattle. &gt; &gt; I have
        family up there that would be willing to help as well. I also &gt; agree &gt;

        They hold &gt; &gt; national (maybe intl?) Speedstacks competitions there. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I've been to LA and SF and don't look forward to going
        again. &gt; &gt; Although SF seems to be much nicer than LA in terms of
        weather... I &gt; &gt; think Seattle would be lovely too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        haven't been to one in NYC, so that would be another place I'd
        be &gt; &gt; interested in seeing more of. I could also go for Idaho if
        someone &gt; &gt; gave me a better description of what kinda sights and sounds
        that &gt; &gt; has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural
        environment. I &gt; &gt; am okay with DC, but there isn't anyone there
        that can host a comp &gt; &gt; for us there (that I know of at least). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I feel that Denver is the most central location so that is one of &gt; &gt;
        top choices. If we Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in &gt; &gt;
        Seattle that would be great too. For something like Nationals with &gt; &gt;
        an expected high turn-out you can't go wrong with Idaho if Frank is
        &gt; &gt; willing to put some time and effort into hosting again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am
        not sure how many cubers are in and around the Chicago area, &gt; &gt; but I
        don't think enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too &gt; &gt;
        involved in school lately (oh and one left this year). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is
        in Toronto, I would be willing to go and act as a WCA &gt; &gt; delagate if
        necessary... hem I wonder if I'm allowed to??? I know &gt; &gt; the rules
        pretty well, and spent a fair amount of free-time pouring &gt; &gt; over them
        to find things to debate about. I guess I should ask &gt; &gt; before I make
        any promises. I have not been to Toronto in many &gt; &gt; years... OMG it was
        WC03! I've been there at least 10 times in the &gt; &gt; past but never
        stayed long enough to see all the things I wanted to &gt; &gt; see. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If
        Patterson has time I think we could do a second Midwest &gt; &gt; tournament
        very successfully. I was very happy with the way the TN &gt; &gt; one was run,
        although a big part of it must have been Chris. It &gt; &gt; takes more than a
        single individual to make something like that run &gt; &gt; smoothly. If
        somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me coordinates &gt; &gt; with Patterson
        we could get that going for either Madison, WI or &gt; &gt; Chicago, with at
        least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go. Although &gt; &gt; I have no idea
        how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is quite busy &gt; &gt; these days. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I don't recall this ever
        &gt; &gt; being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor, MI (40 minutes away)? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to sneak a peak at AMD's
        &gt; &gt; facilities while I'm there! Also any chance of a TX tournament?
        &gt; &gt; Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; sure we can gather up at least 20 solid cubers from

        Centrally located does not imply a better turnout. I think &gt; &gt; if it was
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; held in Colorado, there would be about 10 people there. It &gt; &gt;
        should &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitely be held somewhere that people actually live.

        would want it to be centrally &gt; &gt; located. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Somewhere in
        central Texas, or maybe Colorado, or Kansas. &gt; &gt; Anyone &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have
        any ideas on where? We can change it every year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patrick &gt; &gt;

        September 29, 2006 9:17 PM &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re:
        US Open / Worlds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy
        with the opportunites so far for &gt; &gt; competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite
        living in a less popular cubing area, Detroit, I &gt; &gt; still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        managed to get in 6 competitions since I started cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is not too far like NJ, and I have the travel time &gt; &gt; &gt;
        availible &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me, than I just spend a little over $100 to do
        a &gt; &gt; roundtrip bus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ride. A flight to CA seems to be costing
        me $305-$350 these &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; days. So &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that makes me happy too.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think that another minor one should be held
        in &gt; &gt; Toronto (or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other not-so-far Canadian
        city) some time in the near &gt; &gt; future, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especailly for this
        continent to equal Europe in number of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions so far
        this year. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wouldn't mind seeing
        competitions closer to south- &gt; &gt; central US &gt; &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TX
        but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get &gt; &gt; to, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a lot worst. I'm just glad that we are
        getting a &gt; &gt; &gt; steady in- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flux of new cubers and cubers
        that are willing to organize &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions for us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there will be a "US Open" (btw, that sounds
        like &gt; &gt; something &gt; &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf/tennis to me), then I
        think it should be somewhere &gt; &gt; *other &gt; &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA* to be
        fair to the US cubers not on either coast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Mainly, I think we need to lower the startup "costs" for a &gt; &gt;
        person &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new at running tournaments to do so. Even if we will
        be &gt; &gt; needing a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WCA delagate to be the only one trusted,
        and have them &gt; &gt; bring the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambles and set the schedule
        based on expected turn-out. &gt; &gt; A &gt; &gt; &gt; single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cuber with 2
        months of in-community knowledge and a few &gt; &gt; months of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set up a &gt; &gt; tournament &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where there are none. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure a
        lot of people end up feeling like I do. &gt; &gt; Planning a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tourn. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to see &gt; &gt;
        it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially students. But at the samt time
        it is college &gt; &gt; studets &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the most
        resources availible to them, in terms of &gt; &gt; FUNDING &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; VENUE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We cubers are a competitive bunch, and
        we end up putting &gt; &gt; all our &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time into school and not going
        to or running enough &gt; &gt; tournaments. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This fundemental issue
        needs to personally addressed by &gt; &gt; the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who
        complain that there are not enough tournments &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; And as a whole, we need to be offering the proper &gt; &gt; incentives
        for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to help. Now Europe...., they seem to have their
        &gt; &gt; act &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together. I never hear anyone complain anymore that
        they &gt; &gt; don't &gt; &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough tourns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Well, you could have ratios, for example, let's say the average for
        the world at 3x3 was 30sec, and the average for 4x4 was 2min. Let's
        say I averaged 20 on the 3x3 and 1:20 on the 4x4. Then, I have 1.5 and
        1.33 respectively. Adding those together gives me a point value of 2.83.
        The higher the better. :) -Tim --- In

        combined ranking total. The results are &gt; quite &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice, and I

    The main problem was that people would not submit their times as you can
        imagine. That was two years ago of course, when we were at Stanford. The
        cubing population has grown now, so maybe there would be more interest.
        The "B" and "C" teams were pretty much only the
        United States. We had difficultly in finding enough cubers to form
        single teams from the other countries. It would be fun and probably
        better if it could be automated of course. -Tyson On Oct 5, 2006, at

    I like that idea. But it's rather hard to get 5 cubers from every
        country. Maybe 3 would be enough, what do you think? Reducing the number

    You can let people form their own teams of 3 or 5? That way, people are
        doing it with their friends. Each week, you could have a serious puzzle,
        such as speed solving, and a bonus puzzle as well. The bonus puzzle can
        be something like blindfold solving where only one member of the team
        needs to compete, or it can be something sillier like putting a ball in
        a cup. -Tyson On Oct 5, 2006, at 10:34 AM, Johannes Laire wrote: &gt; I

    Sorry for my late reply, but I just read this after coming back from my
        vacation. The order/payment procedure from rubiks is indeed a bit
        strange, but it is legit. I ordered there twice and got the same
        emailadres. The first order arrived after a week (UPS), the second took
        a little over 2 months (CanadaPost). Arnaud --- In

    Nice work, Frédérick! Gilles, I think there are 22 parity-PLL's,
        because there are also 22 normal PLL's (include solved case). But
        correct me if I am wrong. I guess I will see you both at Dutch open.

    Hi :-) Yes that has the same effect, but it's not the same
        algorithm though!! Fredericks algorithm is exactly what u get when
        combining Stefans permutation parity fix and a corner 3-cycle, with one
        move cancelling ;-) Cheers! -Per PS! There is 2 varieties of
        Stefan's permutation parity fix. The one i gave earlier and this
        one : (Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2. The latter is the correct one to
        combine with corner 3-cycle. My apologies for any confusion :D &gt; --- In

    Nah, don't let Per demotivate you... I like it. My 4x4 PLL in case
        of parity is that I try to recognize a 3x3 PLL, fail, blindly apply the
        parity fix, then recognize again. So yes, like you said it would reduce
        the number of recognitions. I doubt I'll ever learn this, though.
        I'm not the greatest fan of learning a lot of algs. Though I might
        learn pure corner swap algs. I tried to find nice ones by somewhat
        embedding a known parity fix alg into a 3x3 PLL but I haven't found
        anything interesting yet. Stefan --- In

    Hi Frederick :-) Of course it's useful if u can recognize it in one
        look and hence save one look. But like Stefan im not a fan of memorising
        lots of algs. Of course in the long run the more algs u learn the faster
        u will get. My main point was to clarify what ur algorithm is doing. Not
        really from a speeding perspective. Maybe I'M the wrong on the
        wrong forum ;-) It wasn't a brand new construction as such as u
        used 2 well known parts and combined them ;-) One can take many
        combinations like this and find some cancellation and learn it... Is it
        a better forum if u have no response ?? ;-) Happy cubing :-) -Per &gt; ---

        like it. My 4x4 PLL in case of &gt; parity is that I try to recognize a 3x3
        PLL, fail, blindly apply the &gt; parity fix, then recognize again. So yes,
        like you said it would &gt; reduce the number of recognitions. I doubt
        I'll ever learn this, &gt; though. I'm not the greatest fan of
        learning a lot of algs. &gt; &gt; Though I might learn pure corner swap algs.
        I tried to find nice ones &gt; by somewhat embedding a known parity fix alg
        into a 3x3 PLL but I &gt; haven't found anything interesting yet. &gt; &gt;

    &gt; &gt; and while we're at that... how do you RESPOND to that question?
        when &gt; people say, what's the trick, or whatever, what are you
        supposed to &gt; say to that? &gt; I always allude to commutators if
        they've never heard of them, or if they have any sort of math
        background I just tell them that commutators are the trick. I mean think
        about most beginner solutions, almost all the algorithms are
        commutators, or just simpler conjugates, especially for the LL. If there
        is "one trick", then in my opinion commutators are it, but of
        course there might even be an easier way. I just know that it's
        possible to come up with 100% intuitive solutions to a puzzle using
        solely commutators which would count as an "easy" trick to
        solve it. But I agree, in general other than the commutator answer I
        have no idea what to say to the "So what's the trick
        anyway?" question. Chris

    I tend to ask questions back... They go "Is there a trick to

        someone's legitamate question with, that'd be it. Also I

    Nah, don't stop it ;-) Commutators are always even permutations,
        quite trivial to realise. Two differents parts are done, first forward
        then backwards. Regardless if the parts are even or odd the totality
        ends up even. Which again means only exactly half of the cube positions
        may be reachable with commutators. That they actually ARE reachable is
        also not that hard to prove. But i leave that as an exercise for now :D

    Hi Frederick :-) For PLL including permutation parity there is exactly
        ((4!)^2)/2 cases before doing symmetry reductions, total 288 cases. I
        haven't really tried to figure out how many that will be after
        symmetry reductions but i guess it's maybe more than the 21 for
        normal PLL. Or does it have to be the same? Im not sure. Anyway,
        that's quite a lot extra algorithms :D I agree with Stefan it would
        be nice to have a simple corner-swap permutation parity fix too. All i
        have come up with is to combine T- perm or N-perm with the edge
        permutation parity fix (Chris' or Stefans). But i haven't
        found good cancellation scenarios, hence those algs would be too long to
        be useful ... And also i don't use the pairing-up solving, so my
        motivation for finding algs that are not part of my own way of solving
        4x4x4 (or 5x5x5) is not too high. Plaisir! -Per &gt; --- In

    Hi guys, I just wanted to let you know that I will arrive on Friday
        night at the Campanile Hotel with my mom and Joel Heymbeeck. We will
        arrive probably after 8 PM. I look forward to meet you all again.

    I am not sure whether I'll be at the hotel on Friday night because
        I'm staying at Arnaud's place (we'll see). I will
        probably borrow a magic for the competition and I am pretty sure you or
        Erik will fix my magic during the week-end if you get some time ;-). See

    &gt; I agree with Stefan it would be nice to have a simple corner-swap &gt;
        permutation parity fix too. All i have come up with is to combine T- &gt;
        perm or N-perm with the edge permutation parity fix (Chris' or &gt;
        Stefans). But i haven't found good cancellation scenarios, hence &gt;
        those algs would be too long to be useful ... Hi Per =) I got one T-perm
        + Chris-swap that is not so long but it does not do two corners but
        four: I don't know how you denote three layers. I will write like
        (Rrl) for those, hope it's understandable =) (Llr)2 (Ddu)' R2
        (Ddu) (Llr)2 (Ffb)2 (Ddu) B2 (Ddu)' .. (Ff)2 .. U2 b2 (Uu)2 b2 u2
        At the dot's the algs merge and saves one move. Is this one useful?
        But me, I'm using a direct solve method and uses CLL as the first
        LL- step so I want use that alg =) I got a number of more tricky
        PLL's that solves mixed edges but leave the corners undisturbed.
        Try this for example: R' F' r' F' L F r l F'
        L' F l' F R Or this one: r U' r' U l' U l U2 r
        U r' U l' U' l // Kenneth

    Peter and I are flying to Amsterdam on Friday afternoon and then getting
        a train to Delft. We expect to arrive early evening. We're also

    Hi Per, As we said there are 14 PLL cases for the 333 ( including solved
        state ) : http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/solutions_p1.html I
        think there 15 PLL parity cases for the 444 (excluding symetric and
        inverse), but for 2 of them we need to learn inverse too :
        http://frederickbadie.free.fr/444PLLparity.html But may be, I'm
        wrong. Good night and good week. Frederick, Per Kristen Fredlund a
        ï¿½crit : &gt; &gt; Hi Frederick :-) &gt; &gt; For PLL including permutation parity
        there is exactly ((4!)^2)/2 &gt; cases before doing symmetry reductions,
        total 288 cases. I haven't &gt; really tried to figure out how many
        that will be after symmetry &gt; reductions but i guess it's maybe
        more than the 21 for normal PLL. &gt; Or does it have to be the same? Im
        not sure. Anyway, that's quite a &gt; lot extra algorithms :D &gt; &gt; I
        agree with Stefan it would be nice to have a simple corner-swap &gt;
        permutation parity fix too. All i have come up with is to combine T- &gt;
        perm or N-perm with the edge permutation parity fix (Chris' or &gt;
        Stefans). But i haven't found good cancellation scenarios, hence &gt;
        those algs would be too long to be useful ... &gt; &gt; And also i don't
        use the pairing-up solving, so my motivation for &gt; finding algs that are
        not part of my own way of solving 4x4x4 (or &gt; 5x5x5) is not too high. &gt;

    Hi :-) I think the exact count for cases also depends on how u choose to
        recognize each case. Dan Harris lists 21 PLL cases for 3x3x3 on his
        site: http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/index.php?page=3x3x3/cfop/pll/pll
        Anyway i'm not an expert on this since i don't even use the
        Fridrich (CFOP) method ;-) L8r :D -Per &gt; --- In

        http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/solutions_p1.html &gt; &gt; I think
        there 15 PLL parity cases for the 444 (excluding symetric and &gt;
        inverse), but for 2 of them we need to learn inverse too : &gt;

        wrong. &gt; Good night and good week. &gt; &gt; Frederick, &gt; &gt; Per Kristen
        Fredlund a écrit : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frederick :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For PLL including
        permutation parity there is exactly ((4!)^2)/2 &gt; &gt; cases before doing
        symmetry reductions, total 288 cases. I haven't &gt; &gt; really tried to
        figure out how many that will be after symmetry &gt; &gt; reductions but i
        guess it's maybe more than the 21 for normal PLL. &gt; &gt; Or does it
        have to be the same? Im not sure. Anyway, that's quite a &gt; &gt; lot
        extra algorithms :D &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with Stefan it would be nice to have
        a simple corner-swap &gt; &gt; permutation parity fix too. All i have come up
        with is to combine T- &gt; &gt; perm or N-perm with the edge permutation
        parity fix (Chris' or &gt; &gt; Stefans). But i haven't found good
        cancellation scenarios, hence &gt; &gt; those algs would be too long to be
        useful ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And also i don't use the pairing-up solving, so
        my motivation for &gt; &gt; finding algs that are not part of my own way of
        solving 4x4x4 (or &gt; &gt; 5x5x5) is not too high. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plaisir! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Hi, I was wrong, the exact count is 14, the same than PLL without
        parity. I don't know why but it sounds good if this number is the

        &gt; Hi :-) &gt; &gt; I think the exact count for cases also depends on how u

        &gt; For PLL including permutation parity there is exactly ((4!)^2)/2 &gt; &gt; &gt;
        cases before doing symmetry reductions, total 288 cases. I &gt;
        haven't &gt; &gt; &gt; really tried to figure out how many that will be
        after symmetry &gt; &gt; &gt; reductions but i guess it's maybe more than
        the 21 for normal &gt; PLL. &gt; &gt; &gt; Or does it have to be the same? Im not
        sure. Anyway, that's &gt; quite a &gt; &gt; &gt; lot extra algorithms :D &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with Stefan it would be nice to have a simple corner-swap
        &gt; &gt; &gt; permutation parity fix too. All i have come up with is to &gt;
        combine T- &gt; &gt; &gt; perm or N-perm with the edge permutation parity fix
        (Chris' or &gt; &gt; &gt; Stefans). But i haven't found good
        cancellation scenarios, hence &gt; &gt; &gt; those algs would be too long to be
        useful ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And also i don't use the pairing-up solving,
        so my motivation for &gt; &gt; &gt; finding algs that are not part of my own way
        of solving 4x4x4 (or &gt; &gt; &gt; 5x5x5) is not too high. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plaisir!

    Hi, Frederick said he is waiting for the missing solutions. I think he
        was encouraging people to help him find algs for those cases. Anyway, I
        whipped together a simple 4x4x4 optimal solver today. Assuming my

        reductions, total 288 cases. I &gt; &gt; haven't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really tried to
        figure out how many that will be after symmetry &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reductions but i
        guess it's maybe more than the 21 for normal &gt; &gt; PLL. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or
        does it have to be the same? Im not sure. Anyway, that's &gt; &gt; quite
        a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lot extra algorithms :D &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with Stefan it
        would be nice to have a simple corner-swap &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permutation parity
        fix too. All i have come up with is to &gt; &gt; combine T- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perm or
        N-perm with the edge permutation parity fix (Chris' or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Stefans). But i haven't found good cancellation scenarios, hence &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; those algs would be too long to be useful ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And
        also i don't use the pairing-up solving, so my motivation for &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; finding algs that are not part of my own way of solving 4x4x4 (or &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; 5x5x5) is not too high. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plaisir! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    If it doens't take terribly long, I was curious about the cases
        where only edge permutation is effected. A lot of cubers use COLL now
        and so I think those algs would help a lot. I just spent an hr thinking
        about how I could manipulate ACube into doing it somehow, but I am
        pretty sure it can't be done using ACube. I'm too busy to
        write a new program myself... though it probably would not be efficent
        enough. You could restrict to only using &lt;L,l,r,R,U,u&gt;, that should
        speed thigns up, find ones that are intersting and should suffice. -Doug

        During the first two steps I orient as much as possible of the rest of
        the edges, in my third step I do the rest of the orientation (step 2 and
        3 are often done in one alg). Then I end it using my 3-dedge PLL's.
        For the 5x5x5 I do the same thing but there I got an extra step after
        CLL. There I solve the mid edges using a 3x3x3 ELL-alg. Then I solve the
        dedges as it was a 4x4x4. I'm also using CLL+ELL for the 3x3x3 and
        CLL is also useful for a 2x2x2 2-step method, (I'm using it as a
        part of my Ortega step 2+3 method). So I'm using the same LL-algs
        for all sizes of cubes but extra steps are added for the larger ones. I
        also using the "Freeslice-F2L/F3L/F4L..." for all sizes above
        the 2x. I think it's a good aproach =) // Kenneth

    Haha :-P Well that's technically a commutator yes. But with quite
        illegal operators. Legal operators are still only UDFBRL turns. As long
        as we do proper commutators we could then still allow slice turns and
        cube turns as the orientation of the core will be retained after a
        commutator anyhow. But still i'd like to stress the difference
        between that commutators MAY reach half of all cube positions and that

    I often get "Oh, there's JUST a formula to solving it."
        Like somehow it's not difficult because the cube can be reduced to
        patterns and math. Or that knowing how to solve the cube every time is
        cheating. Apparently, the only "legit" way to solve is to
        randomly turn sides and peel stickers until it's solved. Which
        leads me to this one: "When I was a kid, I used to peel off the
        stickers." Awesome. That's how I do it too. Care to try to
        peel off the paint on my speedcube? And verbatim, I hear all the time

        respond, "Yes, the pattern is to have all the greens on one side,
        all the whites on another...." I love it. The usual response is an
        eye roll and shutting up. This might be one of my favorites:
        "Theoretically, any Rubik's cube can be solved in 4
        moves." That's when I hand the cube over and have them show me
        these 4 awesome moves. It hasn't happened yet. I almost forgot:

        like to take a stab at this proof because I think the result is very
        interesting. The short of it for people who don't like my longer
        posts: solve the cube using any BLD method that uses only commutators
        for it's algs. Since you know you will be solving an even position
        on the cube (the condition of what needs to be proved says so) then this
        will be possible using only commutators. Now take the solution you just
        generated and perform the inverse on a solved cube. You have generated
        the position you just solved. However since you can solve all positions,
        this means you can generate all positions. If you don't believe
        this is strong enough, read the longer proof below. The long of it for
        people who don't mind my longer posts. You've been forewarned.
        This is a constructive proof where I just tell you how to solve the even
        permutation cube using only commutators. If you don't like my
        longer posts, you at least know what I am saying in the post and what my
        strategy is. I'm almost 100% certain this is not the most efficient
        proof, and I know you guys will tear me apart about that, but I think it
        is at least *a* proof. If I am wrong and it is not even *a* proof, then
        please feel free to tear my proof apart ;-) I do not mean this to be the
        most elegant proof possible, but simply *a* proof.
        ------------------------------ All I do basically is BLD solving now
        lol, so this was the first thing that came to mind. Take any one of the
        21,626,001,637,244,928,000 even permutations on the cube. The number of
        clockwise twists on the corners for that cube will be congruent to 0
        (mod 3) because I have selected the positions out of the total
        43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible positions on the cube, meaning this
        even position must follow the rules of all positions as far as corner
        twists and edge flips go. The number of flipped edges will be congruent
        to 0 (mod 2) for the same reason. The definition of when a corner is
        twisted is the same as for BLD cubing, I can list the hierarchy of faces
        and the conditions that lead to a corner being twisted or an edge being
        flipped if you want a more complete proof, but I'll assume the
        reader has at least a definition of flipped edges and twisted corners
        based on some BLD cubing method. It is possible to twist the UFR corner
        clockwise using the following algorithm which I will call G. G: U L
        U' L' U L U' L' I can twist a corner counter
        clockwise using the following algorithm H. H: U L' U' L U
        L' U' L Now I can flip corners on the R face using
        commutators. The commutator G and H combined with R face moves can now
        twist corners in all combinations on the R face, assuming the number of
        clockwise twists of the corners on the R face is congruent to 0 (mod 3).
        As an example try the algorithm G R G' R' to see what form
        these commutators take. To twist corners on the L face, simply rotate
        the algorithms I gave across the LR plane. If the sum of the clockwise
        twists on the L face and R face individually are not congruent to 0 (mod
        3) then you will be left with one corner on the R face that is twisted
        and one on the L face that is twisted after applying the above strategy.
        Simply use a setup move to put both corners on the R face. This can be
        done because a conjugate of a commutator, which is still a commutator.
        So do the setup algorithm J followed by any commutator made from the
        algorithms G and H above, using the R face as well. An example: J A R
        A' R' J' where J=L'U'; A is as defined above;
        and R is the usual face turn R. Ok so corners are all twisted correctly
        now. ----- For the edges use the following algorithm: N: R F' U
        R' F Use that algorithm in the following commutator: N E'
        N' E where E is the usual E slice turn that turns the middle
        between U and D as if you were turning the D layer. This flips the edges
        at FR and BR. Assuming a flipped edge is somewhere else on the cube then
        use any setup algorithm J that puts two flipped edges into FR and BR to
        perform the following commutator: J N E' N' E J' to flip
        the FR and BR edges then return the edges back to their starting points.
        For those who don't believe I understand how a conjugate of a
        commutator is also a commutator this is the commutator X Y X'
        Y' where X=J N J' and Y=J E' J' Ok so now the edges
        are flipped correctly. ----------- We're down to the cycling of
        pieces to their correct location. I will break this down into the cycles
        for the corners and for the edges. The overall corner cycle, because
        this is an even permutation on the cube, have an even number of odd
        component cycles. By component cycles I mean all the cycles that
        together add up to the total overall permutation on the corners. This is
        simply the definition of an even permutation on the cube for corners.
        Even cycles can be solved using commutators. Take any cycle (ABCDEFG)
        and do the cycle (ABC) followed by (ADE) followed by (AFG) to solve. Do
        this using freestyle commutators, or when necessary a commutator with a
        setup move, making it a conjugated commutator which is still a
        commutator. If you don't know what I mean about freestyle
        commutators please read here:
        http://s12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?showtopic=207 This is
        simply a set of rules to follow that will generate a commutator to solve
        any 3-cycle necessary. This may require a setup algorithm, which still
        makes it a commutator. Odd cycles can be solved down to two remaining
        pieces. But because there are an even number of them we can use
        commutators to do this. Say we are left with the last two pieces of two
        odd cycles (AB)(CD). Then do two three cycles composed of freestyle
        commutators: Do (ABC) followed by (ADC) to solve those two odd cycles.
        If multiple odd cycles are left at just two pieces, group them into
        pairs and solve as above. Now the corners are completely solved. For the
        edges use the same approach as the corners for the cycles, simply change
        the freestyle commutators to be ones that work for edges, that also
        preserve edge orienatation, and the edges will solve by the same
        strategy. Ok the cube is solved and only commutators were used. Now for
        those who think I don't know what I am talking about, I have solved
        every even permutation but I have not shown that every even permutation
        can be reached from the solved state by commutators alone. Simply take
        the solution you just generated by solving any one of the even
        permutations on the cube and perform the inverse of that solution on a
        solved cube. You can now generate any even permutation on the cube using
        only commutators. Chris

        they are actually &gt; capable of doing this. The latter requires a
        stronger proof than &gt; just odd/even considerations ... It's still
        fairly trivial though. First consider just the permutations: we just
        need to show that any even permutation of edges and any even permutation
        of corners can be solved in the commutator subgroup. Note that A_n is
        generated by 3-cycles and is also generated by double transpositions
        (for n&gt;4). Consider the double transposition T=(UF UB)(UR UL). The
        commutator TF2T'F2 cycles the 3 edges UB, UF DF. Consider the
        double transposition S=(UFR UFL)(UBR UBL). SF2S'F2 is a double
        transposition (UFR UFL)(DFR DFL). Now the cube group acts 3-transitively
        on edges and 4-transitively on corners (and even more, but we don't
        need that). So let X be a move taking the 3 edges we want to cycle into
        positions UB, UF, DF and then the product of commutators cycles the 3
        edges. XTX'XF2X'(XTX')'(XF2X')' is a
        product of commutators that cycles the 3 edges. Let Y be a move taking
        the 4 corners we want to double transpose into the positions UFR UFL DFR
        DFL. Then YSY'YF2Y'(YSY')'(YF2Y')' is a
        product of commutators that double transposes the 4 corners. So we can
        get each 3-cycle of edges, each double transposition of corners and can
        therefore solve any even permutation of edges and any even permutation
        of corners in te commutator subgroup. Next using the 2-transitivity, we
        need only show that it is possible to twist some 2 corners or to flip
        some 2 edges in the commutator subgroup to complete the proof (since
        conjugates of commutators are commutators). For instance, consider any
        move M that flips the UR and UL edges (and does nothing else). Then
        X=(BL)M(L'B')M' is a commutator that flips the UL and UB
        edges. Similarly if M is any move that twists the UFL and UBR corners
        then the commutator F'MFM' will twist the UFL and UFR corners.
        So the entire cube can be oriented within the commutator subgroup. &gt; &gt;

    I was expecting the people interested in this thread to actaully perform
        it and see for themselves... I hope everyone that bothers to read this
        thread actually has a 4x4 on them. It swaps the two UR corners while
        also swapping the adjoining edge piece on the u-layer. It preserves
        everything else. It is optimal in the domino group, STM. I know because
        a program says it is. It's not a useful algorithm, nor was it meant
        to be. I was trying to make a half-hearted argument for why 16 should be
        a lower-bound for the alg that Bruce was seeking for swapping two
        corners alone. As it stands, we 4x4 speedcubers typically do a T- Perm
        and Permutation Parity Alg (in either order). It's not a very good
        argument, and I was more interested in seeing who would be first to
        point out all the flaws to it.... since no one bothered, I'll be
        the first. It is possible that an alg exists that does not meet the
        requirment of perserving supercenters less than 16 turns STM that does
        the same thing. Can anybody think of another reason why my argument
        breaks? I suppose, what I was trying to do as well, was to motivate
        people to discover parity PLLs and quickly populate that table that
        Fredrick posted a link to. I think this is one way of improving the
        popular 4x4 speedsolving method, and was just trying to show that I
        care. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Stefan

        a big/small one) and then apply it according to the patterns that you
        get. You don't need to understand how the formula works, and most
        people don't. Even Jessica Fridrich said she doesn't know how
        many of the OLL formulae, and some of the PLL formulae in her own system
        work. Many of these were discovered rather than constructed. Whether you
        yourself use such formulae is another question, but they certainly do
        exist, and it is not difficult so solve the cube if you use them. &gt; Or
        that knowing how to solve the cube every time is cheating. This is an
        extremist view, but yes I agree with it :-) To clarify, though, my view
        is that I think it's cheating for someone to claim that they can
        solve the cube when they have really memorised a solution which they did
        not come up with themselves. I'm well aware that people will
        disagree with me. I hope there is at least one person who will agree,
        though. &gt; Apparently, the only "legit" way to solve is to
        randomly turn sides &gt; and peel stickers until it's solved. Wait,
        you haven't exhausted all other possible ways to solve the cube. It
        is possible to solve the cube without knowing anything beforehand using
        plain intuition. -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

    Hey :D Hah!! Why didn't i think of that. Well i did, without trying
        lol. I had imagined the layers would go separate ways if doing like
        that. I feel stupid now. Hehe! Ur algorithm cancels 2 moves so it's
        14 turns only. Sweet alg Stefan :D It's also ONE commutator, not 2

    Hello everybody.As you can see I'm from Poland.This is not a
        familiar country for speedcubers because there aren't any shops
        selling Stack Mats :( .In this case I had to do my own TOM's MAT.I
        want to share with you with my idea of extremely cheap home made
        chronometer. http://eurobos.pl/tomek/timer/dsc00341.jpg =&gt; This is my
        TOM'S MAT .Maybe it seems to be poor(it is in comparison with Stack
        Mat :P ) but it works perfectly for me.
        http://eurobos.pl/tomek/timer/mov00068.3gp =&gt; This is a short movie
        showing how my chronometer works.It begins measuring the time after
        pressing touch sensors(it's diffrent from the Stack Mat's
        sensors working rule ) but it really doesn't matter.I can solve the
        cube either while using Stack Mat or TOM's MAT :) .Enjoy and have
        fun .

        is "the obvious effect AND the restriction to domino moves".
        But there was no way I could tell what restriction you used. And I was
        quite sure you didn't prove optimality in general but only with a
        restriction. The major flaw is that there could very well be an alg
        achieving the same effect but with fewer moves, if you allow all moves

    I've got to ask... is this method going to be much faster than what
        is currently used? (first layer, COLL)... I mean, permute all corners is
        many many combinations and so is orient all corners. A method like this
        for BLD would be incredible, but I think there would be too many
        algorithms to memorize, and the algorithm lengths are probably quite
        long. Step 2 is going to be 8! different algorithms right? Isn't
        that worse than ZB? By a lot? By like...56 times? On 10/11/06, James

    I don't think it'll be 8!, since there's no fixed
        reference point. Say the DBL corner is solved, there's only 7! now.
        Then you can freely turn the U face 4 ways, so it's 7!/4. Still
        1260 algorithms...plus the orientation algs. And I can't imagine
        fast recognition on permuting all pieces. And they can't be too

    That's true, I forgot about that flexibility with the 2x2. I guess
        if it's any consolation, practically speaking in a competition

        like this. Though I can't imagine anyone spending this much time on

    (I deleted an earlier post around 24 hours ago because I wanted to
        revise it, after thinking about it awhile. This is my revised post.) By
        domino group, I can see Doug means the group for the Rubik's Domino
        puzzle, and he is saying that his alg is optimal for STM for that
        puzzle. But inner slice moves of the Domino puzzle correspond to moving
        two slices (layers) in a 4x4x4. For the alg Doug mentioned, I count 16
        twist turns, but when I count slice turns on a 4x4x4, I get 23. U slice:
        7 turns, u slice: 7 turns, F slice: 3 turns, B slice: 3 turns; total: 23
        slice turns. His count is correct, of course, for Domino itself. As
        Stefan pointed out the increased number of STM moves of the 4x4x4
        (versus the Domino) may make it possible to find shorter 4x4x4 solutions
        than for Domino for equivalent positions. To me, (U u) is a single
        "twist" turn, but moves two slices (layers), U and u, so I
        would call that two slice turns. On the other hand, u is a single slice
        turn (only one slice/layer is moved), but it requires the cube being
        twisted at two different planes, so I would count u as two twist turns.
        It's been my assumption that slice turn metric (STM) means only one
        layer can be moved (quarter turn or half turn) for what is counted as a
        single move. If that is different from what others view 4x4x4 STM to be,
        let me know. There seems to be generally less standardization on bigger
        cubes in terms of terminology and notation than with the 3x3x3. Of
        course, one could use a metric for the 4x4x4 such that double layer
        turns would count as single moves. That would probably better correspond
        to how many people actually count alg lengths for the 4x4x4. I noticed
        that Jaap once posted an analysis of the centres/centers of the 4x4x4 in
        what he called single slice q+h metric. I assumed that he means moving
        any single layer a quarter turn or a half turn counts as one move, while
        moving two layers counts as two moves. That's the same as what I
        simply view as STM (for 4x4x4), and what I'm using in my optimal
        solver (and five-stage solver). On another note, I made a slight change
        to my optimal solver so it can use a subset of moves, such as Doug
        suggested. I tried instead the moves for stage 4 of my 5-stage solver: {
        U,U',U2,D,D',D2,u2,d2, L2,R2,l2,r2, F2,B2,f2,b2 }. Running for
        several hours, it came up with no solutions of length 14 "single
        slice q+h" moves or less. That's for the adjacent (oriented)
        corner swap with nothing else (visibly) changed (assuming centers
        solved). I thought Stefan was interested in the adjacent corner swap
        case, but I see now he meant adjacent corner swap without moving any
        centers (or edges, of course). I should have realized that's what
        he meant. Anyway, it looks like the corner swap cases don't have
        algs listed yet in the web site listed by Frederick. The "big
        cubes" web site lists solutions consisting of doing a PLL parity
        fix alg followed by a PLL alg (T-perm or N-perm). Since adjacent corner
        swap can be done in 18 slice turns (R2 U' R2 U R2 B2 U B2 D'
        R2 D b2 U2 b2 U2 u2 b2 u2), I thought an optimal solver might be able to
        come up with a shorter alg than a T-Perm + PLL parity fix alg, if such a
        solution exists. But going out 16 or 17 moves seems to be a little
        beyond what my relatively simple optimal solver can do at this point. -

        I'm in a position &gt; &gt; on the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2x2 where I got RR/OR on top
        and when doing z2 it looks like &gt; &gt; this: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OO/RO how many

        2- &gt; &gt; step &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution (so far) which is as fast (with about 150

    Hi! I'm currently learning the method where you do one face and
        then you do the rest. I think it' definitely better then
        "first face"/COLL for me, because I've practice a lot on
        seeing a long way into the solution during inspection. That way I can
        see almost always which of the three cases there will be for the D-layer
        and I solve it so that it's in the right position for the second
        step. Sometimes I can also see which orientation the U-layer will have
        and in rare cases the whole solve. /Gunnar --- In

        4 ways, so it's 7!/4. Still &gt; 1260 algorithms...plus the
        orientation algs. And I can't imagine &gt; fast recognition on
        permuting all pieces. &gt; &gt; And they can't be too long, it's
        just 2x2 after all. Isn't God's &gt; Algorithm 11 moves or less?
        &gt; &gt; However, I think a completely algorithm-based method is not a good &gt;
        idea. Wasn't someone learning to do one face, then COLL plus &gt;
        permute first face? That's like 120 algs...I'm not sure how

        find a good starting position than it is for only the face. It's
        not rare to find three pices in one face with a mixed edge after the
        scramble, two you get almost every time. Also, if you do one layer then
        CLL is a bit better than COLL because of the shorter algs and you can
        get even shorter ones if you use a special 2x2x2 CLL that not care about
        edges at all (algs like R2 U2 R U2 R2). Like half a year ago I had algs
        for all the first face + the rest, learned them in about two months so
        it's not that hard to do (forgot like 50% of them in another two
        months =) =) =) // Kenneth

    My analysis for corner orientation cases was for 3x3x3. If you
        don't count mirror cases as separate cases, I got a number in the
        60's (for two different ways of counting cases). Since for 2x2x2,
        the corners don't have to be oriented with respect to centers, I
        think there may be fewer cases. And if orientation is done first,
        pre-inspection time could be used look for ways to to produce one of
        just a few cases. In Guimond's method, at most two moves (usually 0
        or 1) are said to be required to reduce the cube to one of 16 cases (8
        cases and their mirrors). An additional alignment move may also be
        required to align layers for the alg to be performed. When Bob said 5
        unique cases, I am pretty sure he was referring to corners oriented and
        in the correct layer. It's many more cases if the corners are
        oriented but arbitrarily permuted. It's very easy to get from all
        oriented to all oriented and in the correct layers (Guimond's step
        2). Still, permuting the pieces into the correct layers adds a step to
        the method, making it three steps, and this thread is about 2-step
        methods. I agree with what Tim said about the number of permutation
        cases, except that it appears to me additional reductions can be made.
        You can do a U layer turn to align the two layers in a desired way
        before executing the alg, then turn the U layer again after executing
        the alg to align the layers to the solved state. I believe that
        symmetrical cases will make this less than a 4x additional reduction. If
        you don't count mirror cases as separate cases, that would reduce
        the number further. - Bruce --- In

    Yes. I had imagined a slightly different first step, in which the
        corners are oriented correctly and also placed into their correct layer.

    Hey! Maybe u will come to some agreement on number of cases if u detail
        how calculations are done. Maybe u are not trying to calculate the same
        thing? This reminds me of the different numbers i have heard for number
        of case for PLL for the CFOP (Fridrich) method for 3x3x3. I have heard
        13/14/15/21/22. Maybe there's not even a single correct answer ??

        corner orientation cases was for 3x3x3. If you don't &gt; count mirror
        cases as separate cases, I got a number in the 60's (for &gt; two
        different ways of counting cases). Since for 2x2x2, the corners &gt;
        don't have to be oriented with respect to centers, I think there
        may &gt; be fewer cases. And if orientation is done first, pre-inspection
        time &gt; could be used look for ways to to produce one of just a few
        cases. In &gt; Guimond's method, at most two moves (usually 0 or 1)
        are said to be &gt; required to reduce the cube to one of 16 cases (8 cases
        and their &gt; mirrors). An additional alignment move may also be required
        to align &gt; layers for the alg to be performed. &gt; &gt; When Bob said 5
        unique cases, I am pretty sure he was referring to &gt; corners oriented
        and in the correct layer. It's many more cases if the &gt; corners are
        oriented but arbitrarily permuted. It's very easy to get &gt; from all
        oriented to all oriented and in the correct layers (Guimond's &gt;
        step 2). Still, permuting the pieces into the correct layers adds a &gt;
        step to the method, making it three steps, and this thread is about &gt;
        2-step methods. &gt; &gt; I agree with what Tim said about the number of
        permutation cases, &gt; except that it appears to me additional reductions
        can be made. You &gt; can do a U layer turn to align the two layers in a
        desired way before &gt; executing the alg, then turn the U layer again
        after executing the alg &gt; to align the layers to the solved state. I
        believe that symmetrical &gt; cases will make this less than a 4x
        additional reduction. If you don't &gt; count mirror cases as separate
        cases, that would reduce the number &gt; further. &gt; &gt; - Bruce &gt; --- In

    Hi, I like this alg too : (Rr)2 R F R' B2 R F' R' U2 r2
        U2 B2 (Rr)2 It's speed and it 's easiest to do the U move to
        place the starting position during the PLL recognition time , after that
        , you have just to put the most visible corner on its right place and do
        it quickly. The beginning could be something like that : (x)
        ((Rr)2' (R U R') D2 (R U' R) ..... Thanks to Alexander

    I think it's "Xenon". My brother and I played DDR a lot
        before we started cubing. Cubing is a lot easier to practice though, as

    Hi Ron :-) What's ur method for choosing what orientation to orient
        the edges with respect to? ... I mean u can choose either UD axis or LR
        axis or FB axis. You simply count how many edges need to be oriented for
        each case? U have fixed orientation always? Or u even consider the
        corners when choosing? Or other things? And do u still consider the
        method where u orient all corners and reduce to domino solving in the
        end? Cheerio! -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        edges should be on = U or D face or = F or B face, in the E slice You
        can orient by: = putting the flipped edges in groups of 4 on F or B
        face, then do F or B to flip them = if 2 edges remain, put 1 in U faces,
        one in middle layer, then do moves like F'UF to flip them (this
        example flips UR and FR). One example of a next step is to orient all
        corners. This can be done the Guimond way. All Guimond cases have short
        solutions with U, D, R and L moves. With this start you have all pieces
        oriented often under 15 moves! After that there are still many ways to
        continue... One of them is to put all middle layer edges into middle
        layer, leaving white and yellow stickers on U and D face. Have fun, Ron

    Re: Commutators and generation (and more) Hi :-) Ok, now for some cool
        stuff i found based on the commutators i found for simulating RU turns.
        Start with my 2 commutators :
        [R,R'L'FB'UD][R'L'U2RL,U] now
        [R,R'L'FB'UD][R'L'U2RL,U'] will do the
        same! As mentioned before this simulates turning R then U. This has
        obviously no effect on the centers. If i now solve the cube by
        U'R' we have rotated R and U centers 90 degrees
        counterclockwise in what seems like 22 turns. However my 2 commutators
        end with -LRU so U'R' cancels against -RU. This algorithm only
        turns 2 centers and moves no other cubies. Notice also that the full
        sequence will be :
        L'FB'UDR'U'D'F'BU2RLU'R'L'U2L
        Now we can simply peel off first L' and L as they only serve as
        setup and un-setup for the middle 16 turns with obviously same effect on
        centers (the alg ONLY turns centers!!). Then we have:
        FB'UDR'U'.D'F'BU2RLU'R'L'U2 (16
        turns)* for rotating 2 centers (U and R) ccw (counterclockwise). We can
        do a cyclical shift of this starting after the dot:
        D'F'BU2RLU'R'L'U2FB'UDR'U' Now
        add UR to re-orient the turned centers:
        D'F'BU2RLU'R'L'U2FB'UDR'U'-UR
        gives us D'F'BU2RLU'R'L'U2FB'UD (14 turns)
        This now simulates UR turns with no centers turned. If we reflect this
        about UR-DL axis and reverse it we have simulated doing RU instead.
        First we get: LFB'R2U'D'RUDR2F'BR'L'
        (after reflection) then
        RLFB'R2U'D'R'UDR2F'BL' (after inversion)
        This is the same as : [RLFB'R2U'D',R'] And in
        principle that's exactly the same idea as Stefan had with this:
        [DUR2BF'L'R',U'] Well i at least think this is
        somehow quite neat :D Have fun! -Per * The previous shortest alg i had
        for turning U and R ccw was like this : (R2 U2 R U2 R2 U)*3 (18 turns)
        So in all this i also found a new shorter alg for a center-turning case.
        Niceeeeeee!! :D &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    Guimond's corner orientation algs do not preserve edge orientation.
        You can still use those algs by inserting inner slice turns before any
        turn that would otherwise turn the blue or green face (or whatever faces
        affects edge orientation). I've been looking at OE followed by OC
        as well. One method I've looked at is OE, OC, put corners into
        correct layers, put edges into correct layers, permute each layer
        separately. Two layers may have parity problem, which also needs to be
        fixed along the way. I'm not claiming this method is necessarily
        more efficient than other OE first methods, though. I'll also note
        that Ryan Heise's "Human Thistlethwaite" method is

    Hi, everyone and square-1 solvers! I'm trying to learn a good
        method for solving it, which one would you recommend? I went to Lars
        Vandenbergh's page, but I've found a "4" that I
        still can't understand. For instance, in the 3rd step of his
        solution the first alg is (1,0) / (-3,0) / (-1,-1) / (4,1) / (-1,0) What
        does the "4" mean? Is it in Jaap notation? Thanks in advance!

    I messed around with early edge orientation methods for a while and
        through that experience I discovered 2 things: 1. The move count, which
        is one reason EO appeals to people, appears to be less than a normal
        method but it actually usually balances out in the end. 2. The pieces
        are still everywhere on the cube after EO, making looking ahead more
        difficult. EO is like trying to make a perpetual motion device. --- In

        Given the remark '2 generator algs', I am looking at R, U and

        example of a next step is to orient all corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; This can be done
        the Guimond way. All Guimond cases have short &gt; &gt; solutions &gt; &gt; &gt; with
        U, D, R and L moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; With this start you have all pieces oriented
        often under 15 moves! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that there are still many ways

        was it:
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/5237
        &gt; then the f2l can be solved using only 2 generator algs and the edges &gt;
        of the last layer are already oriented. I experimented with this during
        early 2003. The approach was: - orient edges - construct a line on the
        first layer (2 opposite edges) - fill in the F2L on either side of the
        line, using only R/L/U(/D) turns. Often people who use regular Fridrich
        to solve the F2L end up, by chance, with oriented edges after the cross.
        There are some examples of this on the cube simulator, and whenever that
        happens, the solver is able to solve the whole F2L without rotating the
        cube at all. It looks kind of cool. Here is my initial post about it:
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/5114
        As for the actual trick to solving the edges, here is an excerpt from my
        original post on the topic: ** step 1 ** Put cube into
        &lt;L2,R2,F,B,U,D&gt; group, which I will call G1. That is to say, put the
        cube into a position where the cube can be solved by only using
        L2,R2,F,B,U,D moves. It helps in this method to think of opposite
        colours as the same colour up until you get to step 4. Let's call
        the left/right colours "green" (these are unimportant in step
        1), the up/down colours red, and the front/back colours white. Once you
        get into G1, it is impossible to flip edges, and the only thing we need
        to do to get the cube into G1 is to make sure all the edges are flipped
        right. First you need to find bad edges that are flipped the wrong way.
        A bad edge is one that, if moved to its home position using only moves
        from G1, will be flipped the wrong way. (Of course, you don't need
        to move it there to see that) There are always an even number of bad
        edges, between 0 and 12, or 6 on average. The only way to flip edges to
        turn the left or right sides 90 degrees, and that will flip the 4 edges
        on that side. To flip 4 bad edges, you simply move them all into
        positions on the left side (for example), and turn that side 90 degrees.
        If you have only 2 bad edges, you can make that into 4 by moving just
        one of them onto the left side and turning it. That will change one of
        the bad edges into 3 (plus the other one it makes 4). At end of step 1,
        you should see no red edges facing to the front or back, and you should
        see no white edges facing to the top or bottom. To the untrained eye, it
        will look like you have accomplished nothing so far! Yet, these 12 edges
        are in a much better position now. * * * * Note: The last paragraph
        should not be taken as a complete specification for G1, only an
        observation that holds true. You need to follow all of the previous
        steps to ensure that you get to G1. -- Ryan Heise

    Hi Ryan, OK, here are some credits: :-) - Ryan Heise inspired me to
        investigate orienting edges first - Sebastien Felix inspired me to
        investigate orienting corners after that - Jaap Scherphuis inspired me
        to investigate orienting LL edges during F2L I do think that after
        orienting edges there are so many ways to continue that it is a bit
        strange to give credits to someone who thought of one step. If someone
        came up with solving a cross of edges first, then should he be credited
        if someone else comes up with OLL? I think we should all give credit to
        eachother. We are always inspiring each other. :-) Bruce, there are
        algorithms for Guimond corner orientation step that do not change edge
        orientation. In fact all cases can be solved using only R, L, U and D
        moves. Now I go to Dutch Open... :-) Have fun, Ron ----- Original

    I was at an away football game tonight, as part of the marching band I
        have to go, and I was racing my friend with our 4x4x4s when his cube
        popped. This is not a good thing in the stands. About five seconds
        later, my cube popped in more ways than one. We scrambled all over the
        stands until my friend John crawled under the stands and found the
        remaining three pieces. I was so worried! On the plus side, I found two

    Hi :-) Ok here's a really easy constructive proof that every even
        position on the 3x3x3 cube is reachable by using commutators that only
        use FBUDRL turns. Every position on the cube is reachable by a sequence
        of turns of the 6 outer layers : (m1)(m2)...(mk) - k turns totally (If
        it's not reachable by such a sequence it's not a legal
        position of the cube.) This can be written: (n1)(n2)...(nj) - where each
        turn ni is a 90 degrees CLOCKWISE turn of a layer. For every EVEN
        position j must be an even number. Now group this sequence like so:
        ((n1)(n2))((n3)(n4))...((n(j-1))(nj)) For each group of 2 consecutive
        turns there is 3 possible cases: 1: they are on same layer -&gt; do a
        [RLU2R'L',U'] eqivalent alg 2: they are on adjacent
        layers -&gt; do a [UDF'BU2R'L',U'] equivalent alg 3:
        they are on opposite layers -&gt; do a [RLF2B2U2R'L',U']
        equivalent alg Now the whole sequence (n1)(n2)...(nj) is achieved with
        commutators and hence also the sequence (m1)(m2)...(mk). As long as the
        length of the sequence is an even number of quarterturns :-) Cheerio!!

        we do proper commutators we could then still allow slice turns and &gt; &gt;
        cube turns as the orientation of the core will be retained after a &gt; &gt;
        commutator anyhow. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But still i'd like to stress the
        difference between that commutators &gt; &gt; MAY reach half of all cube
        positions and that they are actually &gt; &gt; capable of doing this. The
        latter requires a stronger proof than &gt; &gt; just odd/even considerations
        ... &gt; &gt; It's still fairly trivial though. &gt; First consider just the
        permutations: we just need to show that any even permutation of &gt; edges
        and any even permutation of corners can be solved in the commutator
        subgroup. &gt; Note that A_n is generated by 3-cycles and is also generated
        by double transpositions (for &gt; n&gt;4). &gt; Consider the double
        transposition T=(UF UB)(UR UL). &gt; The commutator TF2T'F2 cycles the
        3 edges UB, UF DF. &gt; Consider the double transposition S=(UFR UFL)(UBR
        UBL). &gt; SF2S'F2 is a double transposition (UFR UFL)(DFR DFL). &gt; Now
        the cube group acts 3-transitively on edges and 4-transitively on
        corners (and even &gt; more, but we don't need that). So let X be a
        move taking the 3 edges we want to cycle into &gt; positions UB, UF, DF and
        then the product of commutators cycles the 3 edges. &gt;
        XTX'XF2X'(XTX')'(XF2X')' is a product of
        commutators that cycles the 3 edges. &gt; Let Y be a move taking the 4
        corners we want to double transpose into the positions UFR &gt; UFL DFR
        DFL. Then YSY'YF2Y'(YSY')'(YF2Y')' is a
        product of commutators that double &gt; transposes the 4 corners. &gt; So we
        can get each 3-cycle of edges, each double transposition of corners and
        can &gt; therefore solve any even permutation of edges and any even
        permutation of corners in te &gt; commutator subgroup. &gt; Next using the
        2-transitivity, we need only show that it is possible to twist some 2
        corners &gt; or to flip some 2 edges in the commutator subgroup to complete
        the proof (since &gt; conjugates of commutators are commutators). &gt; For
        instance, consider any move M that flips the UR and UL edges (and does
        nothing else). &gt; Then X=(BL)M(L'B')M' is a commutator
        that flips the UL and UB edges. &gt; Similarly if M is any move that twists
        the UFL and UBR corners then &gt; the commutator F'MFM' will
        twist the UFL and UFR corners. &gt; So the entire cube can be oriented
        within the commutator subgroup. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        don;t know the exact dimensions of the springs and (washers?) i might

        opened the center caps, so that i have access to the screws and springs,

        constructive though, since it was, although your post is much more
        explicit and brief. I guess I didn't prove my assertion about
        having sufficient transitivity, although it is clearly true (indeed the
        cube has much more transitivity than is needed for my proof) but I did
        go into more detail than I needed for the other parts. One thing I like
        about what I wrote is that the exact same proof can be used to show that
        the megaminx can be solved using only commutators (the entire puzzle,
        since all the permutations of corners and edges are even, being
        generated by 5-cycles, and since the megaminx has the necessary levels
        of n-transitivity). On the other hand, all you'd need to do to
        emulate your proof is show that one side can be twisted non-trivially
        using a commutator (similar to what you've done in 1. above) so I
        imagine you can easily generalize your proof to the megaminx too. &gt; &gt;

        i'd like to stress the difference between that &gt; commutators &gt; &gt; &gt;
        MAY reach half of all cube positions and that they are actually &gt; &gt; &gt;
        capable of doing this. The latter requires a stronger proof than &gt; &gt; &gt;
        just odd/even considerations ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's still fairly trivial
        though. &gt; &gt; First consider just the permutations: we just need to show
        that &gt; any even permutation of &gt; &gt; edges and any even permutation of
        corners can be solved in the &gt; commutator subgroup. &gt; &gt; Note that A_n is
        generated by 3-cycles and is also generated by &gt; double transpositions
        (for &gt; &gt; n&gt;4). &gt; &gt; Consider the double transposition T=(UF UB)(UR UL). &gt;
        &gt; The commutator TF2T'F2 cycles the 3 edges UB, UF DF. &gt; &gt; Consider
        the double transposition S=(UFR UFL)(UBR UBL). &gt; &gt; SF2S'F2 is a
        double transposition (UFR UFL)(DFR DFL). &gt; &gt; Now the cube group acts
        3-transitively on edges and 4-transitively &gt; on corners (and even &gt; &gt;
        more, but we don't need that). So let X be a move taking the 3 &gt;
        edges we want to cycle into &gt; &gt; positions UB, UF, DF and then the
        product of commutators cycles &gt; the 3 edges. &gt; &gt;
        XTX'XF2X'(XTX')'(XF2X')' is a product of
        commutators that cycles &gt; the 3 edges. &gt; &gt; Let Y be a move taking the 4
        corners we want to double transpose &gt; into the positions UFR &gt; &gt; UFL DFR
        DFL. Then YSY'YF2Y'(YSY')'(YF2Y')' is a
        product of &gt; commutators that double &gt; &gt; transposes the 4 corners. &gt; &gt;
        So we can get each 3-cycle of edges, each double transposition of &gt;
        corners and can &gt; &gt; therefore solve any even permutation of edges and
        any even &gt; permutation of corners in te &gt; &gt; commutator subgroup. &gt; &gt;
        Next using the 2-transitivity, we need only show that it is &gt; possible
        to twist some 2 corners &gt; &gt; or to flip some 2 edges in the commutator
        subgroup to complete the &gt; proof (since &gt; &gt; conjugates of commutators
        are commutators). &gt; &gt; For instance, consider any move M that flips the
        UR and UL edges &gt; (and does nothing else). &gt; &gt; Then
        X=(BL)M(L'B')M' is a commutator that flips the UL and UB
        &gt; edges. &gt; &gt; Similarly if M is any move that twists the UFL and UBR
        corners &gt; then &gt; &gt; the commutator F'MFM' will twist the UFL
        and UFR corners. &gt; &gt; So the entire cube can be oriented within the
        commutator subgroup. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Stefan, you got the drift of what Chris was saying, just &gt; &gt; &gt; accept
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it for once &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think Stefan makes a valid

    Hi! Yes i can quite trivially prove the same on the megaminx. I would as
        a first attempt at this simulate a clockwise turn of one layer on the
        megaminx with this: 1 - cycle 3 adjacent c/e pairs on the layer
        clockwise with a commutator. (1 2 3 4 5) -&gt; (3 1 2 4 5) 2 - cycle 3
        other adjacent c/e pairs such as to achieve a c/e-pair 5- cycle on that
        layer. (3 1 2 4 5) -&gt; (5 1 2 3 4) This is now ur generator for doing all
        possible turns on the megaminx ;-) More cleverly it might be done with
        only one commutator i guess :-) I would have more trouble with my
        approach to show that every even position on the nxnxn cube is reachable
        with commutators. Your approach is more suitable :-) Cheers! -Per &gt; ---

        really easy constructive proof that every even position &gt; &gt; on the 3x3x3
        cube is reachable by using commutators that only use &gt; &gt; FBUDRL turns. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Every position on the cube is reachable by a sequence of turns of
        &gt; &gt; the 6 outer layers : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (m1)(m2)...(mk) - k turns totally &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; (If it's not reachable by such a sequence it's not a legal
        position &gt; &gt; of the cube.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This can be written: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        (n1)(n2)...(nj) - where each turn ni is a 90 degrees CLOCKWISE turn &gt; &gt;
        of a layer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For every EVEN position j must be an even number.
        Now group this &gt; &gt; sequence like so: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        ((n1)(n2))((n3)(n4))...((n(j-1))(nj)) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For each group of 2
        consecutive turns there is 3 possible cases: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1: they are on same
        layer &gt; &gt; -&gt; do a [RLU2R'L',U'] eqivalent alg &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2:
        they are on adjacent layers &gt; &gt; -&gt; do a
        [UDF'BU2R'L',U'] equivalent alg &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3: they are
        on opposite layers &gt; &gt; -&gt; do a [RLF2B2U2R'L',U']
        equivalent alg &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now the whole sequence (n1)(n2)...(nj) is
        achieved with commutators &gt; &gt; and hence also the sequence
        (m1)(m2)...(mk). As long as the length &gt; &gt; of the sequence is an even
        number of quarterturns :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheerio!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        That's very nice. : ) &gt; I hope you weren't saying what I wrote
        was not constructive though, since it was, although &gt; your post is much
        more explicit and brief. &gt; &gt; I guess I didn't prove my assertion
        about having sufficient transitivity, although it is clearly &gt; true
        (indeed the cube has much more transitivity than is needed for my proof)
        but I did go &gt; into more detail than I needed for the other parts. &gt; One
        thing I like about what I wrote is that the exact same proof can be used
        to show that &gt; the megaminx can be solved using only commutators (the
        entire puzzle, since all the &gt; permutations of corners and edges are
        even, being generated by 5- cycles, and since the &gt; megaminx has the
        necessary levels of n-transitivity). &gt; &gt; On the other hand, all
        you'd need to do to emulate your proof is show that one side can be
        &gt; twisted non-trivially using a commutator (similar to what you've
        done in 1. above) so I &gt; imagine you can easily generalize your proof to
        the megaminx too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        SF2S'F2 is a double transposition (UFR UFL)(DFR DFL). &gt; &gt; &gt; Now the
        cube group acts 3-transitively on edges and 4- transitively &gt; &gt; on
        corners (and even &gt; &gt; &gt; more, but we don't need that). So let X be
        a move taking the 3 &gt; &gt; edges we want to cycle into &gt; &gt; &gt; positions UB,
        UF, DF and then the product of commutators cycles &gt; &gt; the 3 edges. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        XTX'XF2X'(XTX')'(XF2X')' is a product of

    Hi, Yes I use Lars V. method. Only differences is that I know (at least
        I should) for every shape the optimal solution (in twist metric) and I
        think Lars don't know EVERY shape (although he will know the most).
        And I (should) do the edge permutation in one step and Lars sometimes
        (maybe most of the times) in two steps (because he doesn't know

    Hi, I played a bit with my Square-1 earlier today and as I do not know
        enough algorithms to solve it completely I had to make one myself to
        permute 2 corners. Here is what I came up with : (0,-1) / (3,0) / (-3,0)
        / (3,-3) / (-3,0) / (0,3) / (-3,0) / (3,0) / (3,-3) / (0,3) / (3,0) /
        (-3,0) / (0,1) And luckily, this corresponds to a regular J permutation.
        :-) Ok it might not be very optimal but I find it quite nice for that
        particular case. Have fun ! Gilles

        Panic I was at an away football game tonight, as part of the marching
        band I have to go, and I was racing my friend with our 4x4x4s when his
        cube popped. This is not a good thing in the stands. About five seconds
        later, my cube popped in more ways than one. We scrambled all over the
        stands until my friend John crawled under the stands and found the
        remaining three pieces. I was so worried! On the plus side, I found two
        sheets of music belonging to two flute players and a sax reed under the
        drums. Rory [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]

    Hi Doug :-) Sorry, i must have overlooked ur first posting of those.
        Anyway i think i beat u with my entry for #3 ;-) And yes, MES is not
        really in use yet for 4x4x4 cube. M = (lr'), E = (u'd), S =
        (fb'). Also bracketing (L2 R2) is not *clear*. Better rewrite that

    Yo !! Last contribution tonight, case N°6: F2 L' U' L F2
        R' D R' D' (Rr)2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 - 15 turns Yes, J-perm
        pluss a permutation parity :-) And an improved case N°10: B2 L U L'
        B2 R D' r2 F2 r2 (Ff)2 r2 f2 R D R2 - 16 turns (J-perm with
        inserted permutation parity) I think only 2 cases are missing now, case

    Hi Stefan :-) Im infected by chatting language, so i tend to type *ur*
        not *your* when i should be typing more formally. Ok, if u read properly
        my proof, the sequence: ((n1)(n2))((n3)(n4))...((n(j-1))(nj)) has solely
        CLOCKWISE turns. So every double turn or counterclockwise turn is
        rewritten with 2 or 3 turns respectively ;-) Besides, u know that i have
        commutators for the mentioned cases also. Nitpicking Stefan ;-) Enjoy!

    I never learned that base Y-Perm you used, once I got used to that, then
        I understood how you came up with those, and how you sneaked in the
        cancellation. I pretty much only know 1 alg for every PLL case, since I
        don't use it very much. For Y-Perm, I've always done:
        FRU'R'FDR'B'R'BR2D'F2 =&gt;
        F(RU'R'b)(RU'y)(R'U'R)z(R2'F'U2)x'
        I use that parity alg, r2U2r2(Uu)2r2u2, for my 4x4 solving so it seemed
        very familiar. I'll have to look at the other ones more carefully
        now, to see if I can figure out how they work. In other news... I'm
        currently averaging faster in practice on 5x5 than 4x4... how weird is

    I ran into a little problem just now. After getting a little bit boared
        with regular solving of the 5x5, I started scrambling and solving in the
        &lt;R,U,u&gt; group and that is pretty fun. I have been doing it for a few
        weeks now and have been going for speed with it. Btw, it is possible to
        get the wing permutation parity this here. On my very first try I
        didn't run into any problems. I just tried to scramble and solve in
        the &lt;R,Uu&gt; group... I'm so stuck. Anyone have any good solutions
        to this? FOr &lt;R,U,u&gt;, I just do centers, group the edges, do a parity
        alg if needed and then the regular 3x3 &lt;RU&gt; subgroup solve, which
        I'm comfortable with. Sometimes I solve the two uL wings right
        after centers or even during as a variation to this method. I can group
        the other edges while preserving those two wings. For &lt;R,Uu&gt; if I try
        that I get stuck after centers. I think this might be a lot similar to
        the &lt;R,u&gt; subgroup on the 3x3, which is somethign I never tried, but
        thanks to this, I guess I should give it a try first perhaps. Any ideas?

    Hi everyone. I've started a Rubik's Cube club here at UC
        Berkeley and we are organizing a competition for November 18th. The room
        I've reserved for now is 105 North Gate Hall. This may change if I
        can obtain a better room but if not, this is the room we will use. The
        events we are planning to have are: 3x3x3 speedsolve 3x3x3 one-handed
        3x3x3 blindfolded 4x4x4 speedsolve Magic We also might have these events
        depending on time/interest: 2x2x2 5x5x5 master magic To pre-register,
        make an entry in the database in the Caltech Rubik's Cube yahoo
        group. It is labeled as Berkeley Fall 2006. Any questions can be
        directed to berkeleycubeclub@... or posted here. I tend to visit this
        forum fairly often. -Dan

    SWEET! Another competition for me to go to. Nov 18, hem... Oh right,
        that's the same date as Rutgers, so I'm already committed.
        Darn. Berkeley is pretty big, there might be a lot more interest then at
        first glance. Be sure to advertise it well. I'm thinking color
        flyers at major points, around the CS/CE area, and the math dept (floors
        7,8,9 of Evans) would be helpful. I think there are math grads there
        that know how to cube and wouldn't mine spending a weekend
        afternoon meeting cubers. 10th floor is where they hold a weekly math
        club... I always think that competitions always tend to be
        under-advertised locally. Or perhaps you can't support having too
        many people. Since I'm curious, and appearently a few other ppl
        here would like to know about planning tournaments: How many people do
        you plan on attending? What is the max you think can be supported? How
        many rounds of main 3x3? Any sorts of funding issues you have to deal
        with? Is there a registration fee attached? Might find competitors by
        posting at a local HS too. Bob'll be serving food and breverages...
        well just pizza and pop. That was a major reason I chose to go to his

    You can of course make the springs yourself like I did. Only I
        don't think most people know how to, so Stefan's option is
        probably the way to go :) A good minx is not equal to good times but

    Hi Doug, I just started this club within the last few weeks. My friends
        and I have wanted to host a tournament for a while now and I started
        looking into it a few weeks ago. I found out that clubs here can reserve
        rooms without cost and so my first objective was to form a club. I
        completed that on Friday, reserved a room and that was that. I
        don't really know how many people I think will attend but I know
        there are a good number of cubers around this area that will come and
        also, there are my students in the speedcubing class that will come (or
        I will fail them all! =p.... not really). The room I reserved is a large
        lecture hall that can hold over 100 people so I'm not too worried
        about too many people coming. I think if we have enough people, we can
        do 3 rounds but perhaps I'm being a bit too optimistic. I really
        don't know what to expect but I'm pretty sure it won't be
        small. Like I said before, we can reserve the room for free so funding
        is not an issue. The only reason I would charge a registration fee (if I
        did it would probably be only $2 or something small) would be to pay for
        prizes and such but I think since this is the first tournament,
        I'll just pay for it out of my own pocket in hopes that a free
        tournament entices more people to come. Oh, and I also plan to advertise
        with fliers in the dorms. I just need to call their office and see if it
        costs anything to do that. I don't really know where else I can
        advertise yet. Oh man, I have to go make a flier now. Didn't even
        think of that.... -Dan PS sorry this is one huge, unorganized paragraph

    Hey Dan, Charge $3 to $5. It's at a minimal cost as chess
        tournaments easily cost $30 and upwards. In Reno, entry fee was $140 I
        think. Anyway, the small amount of money will give your club more
        flexibility in the future and will help you purchase any incidentals you
        need for these competitions. If anything, we should all be giving you
        more money to get your club started! $3 to $5 is definitely trivial. I
        don't think people should really complain about $10 actually. Road
        races will easily cost $20 or $30 if you're a runner. Every other
        event out ther has entry fees that are far more significant, and
        you'll end up putting in a lot of effort, so your life should be
        made as easy as possible which means you not having to pay out of your
        pocket. -Tyson On 10/18/06, Dan Dzoan &lt;gvdlfs3@...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; Hi

        4x4x4 speedsolve &gt; &gt; &gt; Magic &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We also might have these events
        depending on time/interest: &gt; &gt; &gt; 2x2x2 &gt; &gt; &gt; 5x5x5 &gt; &gt; &gt; master magic &gt;

    Now you made me really curios. How do you make your springs yourself?
        How long did it take and how much did it cost? Btw, instead of

    I also think you should charge a bit. There is no reason for you to pay
        the championship with money from your own pocket. But don't charge
        too much. At Belgian Open this year, we charged 15 � per person. The
        reason was that I had to pay for the room, insurance for the room, food,
        drinks and prizes. But this price made some friends of mine say "I
        can solve the cube, I would like to go to a competition but 15� is just
        too much." So Jo�l Heymbeeck and I are working on taking the fee
        down to 5 � per competitor for next year. But really you shouldn't
        pay with your money. And even if you are not profit focus and that you
        make profit, just keep the money to invest in stackmats or cubes for
        your club or pay for charges for the next tournament your organise. Good
        luck with your championship :) Gilles. 2006/10/18, Tyson Mao
        &lt;tyson.mao@...&gt;: &gt; &gt; Hey Dan, &gt; &gt; Charge $3 to $5. It's at a
        minimal cost as chess tournaments easily cost &gt; $30 and upwards. In
        Reno, entry fee was $140 I think. Anyway, the small &gt; amount of money
        will give your club more flexibility in the future and &gt; will &gt; help you
        purchase any incidentals you need for these competitions. &gt; &gt; If
        anything, we should all be giving you more money to get your club &gt;
        started! $3 to $5 is definitely trivial. I don't think people
        should &gt; really complain about $10 actually. Road races will easily cost
        $20 or $30 &gt; if you're a runner. Every other event out ther has
        entry fees that are far &gt; more significant, and you'll end up
        putting in a lot of effort, so your &gt; life &gt; should be made as easy as
        possible which means you not having to pay out &gt; of &gt; your pocket. &gt; &gt;

        this club within the last few weeks. My friends and I &gt; &gt; have wanted to
        host a tournament for a while now and I started looking &gt; &gt; into it a
        few weeks ago. I found out that clubs here can reserve &gt; &gt; rooms without
        cost and so my first objective was to form a club. I &gt; &gt; completed that
        on Friday, reserved a room and that was that. I don't &gt; &gt; really
        know how many people I think will attend but I know there are a &gt; &gt; good
        number of cubers around this area that will come and also, there &gt; &gt; are
        my students in the speedcubing class that will come (or I will &gt; &gt; fail
        them all! =p.... not really). The room I reserved is a large &gt; &gt; lecture
        hall that can hold over 100 people so I'm not too worried &gt; &gt; about
        too many people coming. I think if we have enough people, we &gt; &gt; can do
        3 rounds but perhaps I'm being a bit too optimistic. I really &gt; &gt;
        don't know what to expect but I'm pretty sure it won't be
        small. Like &gt; &gt; I said before, we can reserve the room for free so
        funding is not an &gt; &gt; issue. The only reason I would charge a
        registration fee (if I did it &gt; &gt; would probably be only $2 or something
        small) would be to pay for &gt; &gt; prizes and such but I think since this is
        the first tournament, I'll &gt; &gt; just pay for it out of my own pocket
        in hopes that a free tournament &gt; &gt; entices more people to come. Oh, and
        I also plan to advertise with &gt; &gt; fliers in the dorms. I just need to
        call their office and see if it &gt; &gt; costs anything to do that. I
        don't really know where else I can &gt; &gt; advertise yet. Oh man, I
        have to go make a flier now. Didn't even &gt; &gt; think of that.... &gt; &gt;

    I was afraid you'd ask, cause it's hard to explain in Dutch
        and even harder to explain in English, but here is my best try: As you
        know, springs are made of steel wire (don't know if this is the
        correct word for it though). Now at my model airplane club they have the
        right tools. The device is very easy. It is an other steel wire mounted
        on a rig. And it is made so you can twist the steel wire with a handle.
        This steel wire is horizontaly. There is also a small bracket. You
        choose the thickness of your steelwire, (I thought I choose 0.6 mm) and
        you choose the radius it has to become (the thickness of the steel wire
        on the device). You mount one end of the steel wire of 0.6 on the
        bracket. Now you twist the handel around so that the steel wire of 0.6
        is being wired around the steel wire on the device. This way you can
        make a spring as long as you want or as long as the steel wire is on the
        device. After you have a very long spring. You cut it in bits. Then I
        take it to a small grinding machine to make the points and tops of the
        spring not damage any part of the puzzle. I hope you are able to
        understand some of this...:P Erik --- In

        ones do look a lot better, no? Particularly if you sand them so you
        really have a flat full ring as the end of the spring. With open ends I
        could imagine it scratches more because there's a start point and
        because all pressure gets onto a small point. And scratching has several
        bad effects. I could also imagine that a spring with open ends gets
        pressed diagonally. You know, you can't let it stand on the table
        without help. Of course inside the puzzle it does have help, from the
        screw. But I still don't like it. Stefan

    Respected all, At last, I tasted the experience of a rubiks cube
        championship in The Netherlands. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I enjoyed
        every moment and enjoyed meeting many of the European great cubers. I
        learnt a lot from them all. Thanks to Ron uncle for all his help. It is
        10 days long trip for me and my dad. We reached home safely yesterday
        night. 3*3*3 speed solve:- I had never done 15.66 sec avg at home. But
        my 15.66 sec avg in dutch open semi final is the most satisfying result
        for me. It put me in the second position after Joel Van Noort. My single
        solve 12.56 sec is PLL skip. 4*4*4 speed sove:- My best is 61.xy sec.
        But I had 3 pops and almost in all solves I had double parity. Still I
        am happy with my 80 sec avg. 5*5*5 speed solve:- I want to forgt this.
        3*3*3 blindsolve:- 3 min 55.xy sec is below my standard but after 1st
        DNF, it was done with extra care and effort. 3*3*3 multiple BLD :- I
        tried 5 and got 3 correct, in 4th one, I had 1 pair of corners flipped
        and 5th one I had a good scrambling at the end!! 2*2*2 speed solve:-
        8.06 sec avg was good for me to finish 4th. Squre-1:- I had 2 good
        solves 27 sec and 31 sec. But my first one was horrible. I took 50 sec.
        The avg 36.xy sec put me behind the 2 greats Michael Fung and Lars.
        Pyraminx :- I learnt it a day before the championship and finished last.
        Megaminx :- 6min 1 sec avg was good for me. My dad was unlucky to miss
        out only one edge pair flipped in the 1st cube out of 8 cubes he
        blindsolved. I am happy he solved 7 cubes correctly in 148 min including
        memorisation. Let me thank Ron uncle, Ton uncle, Jaap uncle for their
        help and support. Well done all the participants in Dutch open-2006.

    Ok, well I guess I'll do it like caltech does and charge $3 if

        There is no reason for you to pay the championship with money from your
        own &gt; pocket. &gt; &gt; But don't charge too much. &gt; &gt; At Belgian Open
        this year, we charged 15  per person. &gt; The reason was that I had to pay
        for the room, insurance for the room, food, &gt; drinks and prizes. &gt; But
        this price made some friends of mine say "I can solve the cube, I
        would &gt; like to go to a competition but 15 is just too much." &gt; &gt;
        So Joël Heymbeeck and I are working on taking the fee down to 5  per &gt;
        competitor for next year. &gt; &gt; But really you shouldn't pay with
        your money. &gt; And even if you are not profit focus and that you make
        profit, just keep the &gt; money to invest in stackmats or cubes for your
        club or pay for charges for &gt; the next tournament your organise. &gt; &gt;
        Good luck with your championship :) &gt; Gilles. &gt; &gt; &gt; 2006/10/18, Tyson
        Mao &lt;tyson.mao@...&gt;: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Dan, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Charge $3 to $5.
        It's at a minimal cost as chess tournaments easily cost &gt; &gt; $30 and
        upwards. In Reno, entry fee was $140 I think. Anyway, the small &gt; &gt;
        amount of money will give your club more flexibility in the future and &gt;
        &gt; will &gt; &gt; help you purchase any incidentals you need for these
        competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anything, we should all be giving you more
        money to get your club &gt; &gt; started! $3 to $5 is definitely trivial. I
        don't think people should &gt; &gt; really complain about $10 actually.
        Road races will easily cost $20 or $30 &gt; &gt; if you're a runner.
        Every other event out ther has entry fees that are far &gt; &gt; more
        significant, and you'll end up putting in a lot of effort, so your
        &gt; &gt; life &gt; &gt; should be made as easy as possible which means you not
        having to pay out &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; your pocket. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Tyson &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Doug, &gt; &gt; &gt; I just started this club within the last few
        weeks. My friends and I &gt; &gt; &gt; have wanted to host a tournament for a
        while now and I started looking &gt; &gt; &gt; into it a few weeks ago. I found
        out that clubs here can reserve &gt; &gt; &gt; rooms without cost and so my first
        objective was to form a club. I &gt; &gt; &gt; completed that on Friday, reserved
        a room and that was that. I don't &gt; &gt; &gt; really know how many people
        I think will attend but I know there are a &gt; &gt; &gt; good number of cubers
        around this area that will come and also, there &gt; &gt; &gt; are my students in
        the speedcubing class that will come (or I will &gt; &gt; &gt; fail them all!
        =p.... not really). The room I reserved is a large &gt; &gt; &gt; lecture hall
        that can hold over 100 people so I'm not too worried &gt; &gt; &gt; about
        too many people coming. I think if we have enough people, we &gt; &gt; &gt; can
        do 3 rounds but perhaps I'm being a bit too optimistic. I really &gt;
        &gt; &gt; don't know what to expect but I'm pretty sure it
        won't be small. Like &gt; &gt; &gt; I said before, we can reserve the room
        for free so funding is not an &gt; &gt; &gt; issue. The only reason I would
        charge a registration fee (if I did it &gt; &gt; &gt; would probably be only $2
        or something small) would be to pay for &gt; &gt; &gt; prizes and such but I
        think since this is the first tournament, I'll &gt; &gt; &gt; just pay for
        it out of my own pocket in hopes that a free tournament &gt; &gt; &gt; entices
        more people to come. Oh, and I also plan to advertise with &gt; &gt; &gt; fliers
        in the dorms. I just need to call their office and see if it &gt; &gt; &gt; costs
        anything to do that. I don't really know where else I can &gt; &gt; &gt;
        advertise yet. Oh man, I have to go make a flier now. Didn't even &gt;

        Berkeley is pretty big, there might be a lot more interest then at &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; flyers at major points, around the CS/CE area, and the math dept &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; (floors 7,8,9 of Evans) would be helpful. I think there are math &gt;

        hold a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weekly math club... I always think that competitions
        always tend to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be under-advertised locally. Or perhaps you
        can't support having too &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many people. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since
        I'm curious, and appearently a few other ppl here would like &gt; &gt; &gt;

        plan on attending? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the max you think can be supported? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; How many rounds of main 3x3? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any sorts of funding issues
        you have to deal with? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there a registration fee attached? &gt; &gt;

    Hello all, At last, I tasted a cube championship in The Netherlands. I
        am happy to have met so many great European cubers. The competition was
        tuff and I enjoyed every moment of it. Thanks to Ron uncle and Ton uncle
        for all their help. Everyone treated me with respect. I think all of you
        might have seen the result. Since it is my first ever championship, I
        like to share my performance with you all in this group hoping your
        feedback will help me to improve my cubing skill. 1).3*3*3 speed solve
        first round = 16.66 sec avg= 5th place 2).3*3*3 speed solve semi final =
        15.56 sec avg= 2nd place 3).3*3*3 speed solve final = 17.00 sec avg= 6th
        place 4).2*2*2 speed solve = 8.06 sec= 4th place 5).4*4*4 speed solve
        final = 80.70 sec= 7th place 6).5*5*5 speed solve final = I want to
        forget(too many bad pops) 7).3*3*3 blindfolded = 3min 55.77 sec =4th
        place 8).3*3*3 one handed = 70.36 sec avg = 6th place 9).Square-1 = 6min
        1.07 sec avg = 7th place 10). Pyraminx = 32.70 sec avg 11).3*3*3
        multiple cubes blindfolded = solved 3 correctly out of 5 cubes. 12).My
        best single solve in 3*3*3 = 12.56 sec(PLL skip) 13).My best 4*4*4
        single solve = 61.06 sec 14).My best 5*5*5 single solve = I want to
        forget this very bad solves 15).My best square-1 single solve = 27.xy
        sec 16).My best Megaminx single solve = 5 min 44.xy sec 17).My best
        2*2*2 single solve is 7.06 sec 18).Team solve with Stefan Poachmann =
        55.xy and 56.xy sec = 2nd place In 4*4*4 solve, I had few pops and all
        the times except the last but best solve, I had double parity in all
        cases. I hate parity but it follows me. I think Stefan uncle is happy to
        team with me and we did very well to finish with 2nd place. Now, I can
        solve megaminx in sub 4 min. Thanks to Stefan uncle for teaching me his
        technique. At last, my dad blindsolved 7 cubes correctly out of 8 he
        tried in multicubes blindfolded. He was unlucky to have flipped only one
        pair of edges in one cube which denied him the world record. I thought
        he will be dejected, but he told me it was all in the game and that was
        it and he will try again in the next championship. But, I felt sad for
        him and was dejected. Over all we enjoyed every moment of it. It gave us
        very rich experience. At last I was sad to say good bye to Ron uncleand
        Ton uncle very early, Stefan uncle and others later one by one. Well
        done winners and good luck next time for all the participants. My dad
        often tells me "luck is not in our hands but work is in our
        hands" and "all of us may not be equally talented but all of
        us may have equal opportunities". I will practice well and try to
        do my best in the next championship. Thanks for all the tips given to me
        by various participants. J.Bernett Orlando

    This is a very hard question... I just played around with it. You have
        to allow for the inverses of each of those generators too. It is
        included implicitly as performing it 5 times to get the equivalent
        result I guess, but it seems nicer to include it explicitly. For
        starters, I would go for an edges first approach. Since we know that
        doing any of those generators 3 times perserves edges... I don't
        know how much people here are going to be able to help on this question,
        besides I guess jaap... No one has responded to my questions about
        &lt;u,R&gt;, and this is a previous topic I found searching here, in each
        case I coulnd't find an answer to. This would help in my more
        specific question about how to solve the &lt;Uu,R&gt; group on the 5x5. I
        think you can get almost every corner possiblity (the 8!*3^7/2 even
        ones), where by almost I'm guessing a factor of 3 or 9 on EO...
        Similar for edges. This should be a very challenging. -Doug --- In

    Okay, I solve your question, you solve mine :). I just had a few
        successful solves in this subgroup. Here is my method: Let P = (the
        move) := RU'R'U, as it is for teamBLD. Let Q =
        R'URU'. Solve all 12 edges intuitively. It's inuitive for
        me because I've done that before... especially for 3^4 and 3^5
        cubes, but here's a brief explainataion: P cycles three edges
        counter clockwise about the UFR corner, the ones adjacent to that
        corner. This is enough to position each edge in place, although using Q
        would certainly speed things up and perhaps get them in place with
        correct flip as well. A very ineffiecent way of doing this is solving EP
        first and then EO. But that would suffice for a solution. To do EO
        separately you can do this: To flip the UF and RF edges, use (P y'
        Q y) Near the end of doing edges you will probably need to use
        "setup moves". In this case try to resist the urge to use
        single turn setup turns, because that would invalidate the purpose of
        this excersise. Do note that (P y' Q y) alone without setup moves
        is theoretically enough to solve EO... (think about why). For the
        corners P^3 does two 2-cycles as most cubers are aware by now. Thanks to
        the sub-sub-group we are now in, it is actaully possible (I have yet to
        prove it though) to use solely cube rotations and P^3 to solve most of
        the corners (both permutation and orientation), where by most I mean
        with all CP done and only at most 4 that need twist. Now for CO. To
        twist the UFR corner ccw and the UBR corner cw do the following alg:
        (P^3 x' P^2 x P^3 x' P^4 x). Fill in the details and feel free
        to ask questions. I guess this makes me an expert now! Yippy. :) -Doug

    Thanks for your efforts. But you explained how such a scramble can be
        solved, and it was not the problem. :-) &gt; I think you can get almost
        every corner possiblity (the 8!*3^7/2 &gt; even ones) I don't think
        so, and that's precisely the point. To be honest, I have more ideas
        of possibly very interesting sequences that keep the corners in this
        supposed group. But I can't see what exactly the group is. Gilles.

    Not mine, though. Constantin suggested it because he'd like
        certificates very much, and I agree. He did get one of those RWC glass
        cubes as trophy (I think for winning blindfold at the German Open) and
        just like me he doesn't like its complete anonymity, it
        doesn't say what he got it for so he can't even show that to
        his friends. Plus, you can easily just buy it on the internet. It's
        not a trophy. Certificates on the other hand are easy to make personal.
        Mention competition, event, competitor and place, put the WCA logo and
        maybe some more graphics on it, let the WCA delegate sign it and there
        you go, a very nice (and cheap?) souvenir you can also hang on the wall

    I am fairly convinced that that subgroup consists of precisely all the
        even permutation elements. I have a sequence that can be used to twist
        any two corners without affecting edges. I have another sequence that
        flips any two edges without effecting corners. All the erientation
        possiblities can thus be achived. The centers never rotate in this

    Hey !! Ok, so i studied these commutators a little bit and i came up
        with algs for twisting 2 corners and flipping 2 edges. Corner 2-twist:
        (([R',F])*2 ([R,U'])*2)*2 - 32 turns (ugh!) in condensed
        notation. Edge 2-flip: ([R',F])*2 ([R,U'])*2 ([F,R'])*2
        ([U',R])*2 - 32 turns (ugh!) Are these optimal? A corner 3-twist
        can be done like so: ([R',F][F',U][U',R])*2 - 19 turns
        due to cancellations Have fun! -Per PS! It's still not sufficient
        that corners be in an even permutation to be solvable in this
        "Y-commutator subgroup". Now, what if say URF- UBR and UFL-ULB
        are swapped. I can't see how that is solvable ... &gt; --- In

        Good thing you added that one. The first two corner twist you gave
        twisted corners in the same orbit (under half turns) so it doesn't
        work for twisting any pair - buut in combination with the last of these
        (and the 3 corners being in the same layer) that obstruction is removed.

    All edge 3-cycles (hence all even edge permutations) are possible
        although the problem is really about corners. So the even corner
        permutation problem really is equivalent to knowing what can achieved
        with these generators. (I'm using UF=1, UB=2, UR=3, UL=4, DF=5,
        DB=6, DR=7, DL=8, FR=9, FL=10, BR=11, BL=12.) By earlier posts we can
        forget about orientation of edges (these moves will preserve the
        corners). (*) Let
        a=((RU'R'UR'URU')6(LU'L'UL'ULU')6)5
        which cycles (1 12 9) Let
        b=((L'ULU'LU'L'U)6(R'URU'RU'R'U)6)5
        which cycles (1 11 10) Let c=a5b5a10 which cycles (9 11 10) bc2 cycles
        (1 9 10) I'm going to call 2 moves equivalent if they only differ
        by orientation of edges (*) or by being inverses, as that can be
        achieved by doing the same move lots of times or by rotations of the
        whole cube - since I don't want to think so hard and basically show
        you can get anything of the form (1 2 x), (1 3 x), (1 6 x) and (1 7 x).
        (1 9 10) is equivalent to (1 2 3). (1 12 9) is equivalent to (3 7 1) and
        to (6 9 1) (9 11 10) is equivalent to (1 2 6) (1 2 3)(3 7 1)=(1 2 7). (1
        2 9)=(1 2 6)(6 9 1) So any edge permutation of the form (1 2 x) is
        possible. (1 3 6) is equivalent to (1 12 9) (1 3 9)=(1 3 6)(6 9 1) (1 3
        10)=(1 3 9)(9 10 1) (1 3 12)=(1 3 10)(10 12 1)- NB (10 12 1) is
        equivalent to a (1 2 x) So any edge permutation of the form (1 3 x) is
        possible. Any edge permutation of the form (1 6 x) falls into one of the

    What do you mean "inverted"? There are a few different
        interpretations I can come up with. Do you mean solving the cross on the
        opposite color? solving in such a way as to need a 180 on the cross
        layer? insert each edge of the cross flipped? Solve the cross in the
        reversed cyclic order? I don't have any problems with doing this
        phase of my 5x5. I have more of a pause when there is a parity alg being
        finished, and even more so when it's on the 4x4, but I'm

    Hi Bruce! Yah ok, the fact that &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B,x,y&gt; is 2 times larger
        than for &lt;RU'R'U,R'URU',RUR'U',x,y&gt;
        only means that the odd positions are excluded, which is trivial anyway.
        The reason all even permutations are reachable in
        &lt;RU'R'U,R'URU',RUR'U',x,y&gt; is that we
        can do say P= ([R,F] )*3 then some Z-commutator Q and combine these 2
        sequences to a larger commutator PQP'Q' to achieve 3-cycles on
        corners. We have already shown that we can cycle edges and twist corners
        and flip edges as we desire in the group
        &lt;RU'R'U,R'URU',x,y&gt;. At the moment i'm most
        interested in finding optimal sequences for the following in
        &lt;RU'R'U,R'URU',x,y&gt;: 1 : any 2-twist on corners 2
        : any 2-flip on edges 3 : any edge 3-cycle And likewise when restricted
        to solely F,R and U turns. Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

    Hi :-) Ok, here's a way to do solely an edge 3-cycle:
        ([R',F][R,U'])*2 ([F',U])*2 - 24 turns and a shorter way
        than posted previously to twist 2 corners:
        [[R',F][F',U],[D',L]] - 22 turns due to some
        cancellations (I hope this condensed notation is clear, there's
        some commutators inside the main big commutator. Also recall that
        [P,Q]^-1 is simply [Q,P].) Anyone has something better? What is possible
        solely in &lt;RUR'U',R'U'RU,x,y&gt; ? The Z-commutator

    Hi Anssi =) The rule is that the competition must have at least 10

    [R',U][R',F][F,U'] + U' (adjustment) positions the
        corners. The trick is [R',U], [R',F] and [F,U'] solve
        D-corners one by one, and when D-corners are OK, U-corners are
        automatically permuted. I feel there's an intermediary subgroup
        that could be interesting, and it looks closely related to
        Y-commutators. Otherwise, I don't care about commutators when they
        are useless for speed-cubing. Let me take an example. RU'R'U
        scrambles ULF UF UFR UR URB FR FDR pieces. You get an "Y"
        shape (pyramid) of unsolved pieces. Consider this Y as your degree of
        freedom. Without changing other pieces, you can do FR'F'R,
        R'FRF', etc, 6 commutators. But, more interesting, you can
        "move the Y" to another place, or keep it in the same place,
        but move solved pieces. Example: U'l After U'l, you still can
        apply the 6 commutators, and then restore solved pieces with l'U.
        U'l removes two 1x2x2 from the block of solved pieces, but you keep
        pseudo-blocks. Another sequence that travels through the "Y
        space": RU'R'U2F'UL2BLB'LU'FU' Now
        back to what I was saying about corner permutation. After
        RU'R'U2F'UL2BLB'LU'FU', just insert the
        last D-corner with R'FRF' and you'll see all corners and
        positioned, because a 2-cycle or a 3-cycle can't happen. Even
        better, I think you can always get the last 4 corners automatically
        permuted when using Y-commutators and some other tricks after a shorter
        sequence based on RU'R'U2F'UL2BLB'LU'FU'
        (RU'R'U2F, RU'R'U2F'UL2BL, etc.). Gilles (still

        RightCosets function does that. It gives cycle notation using
        user-assigned numbers for the various facelets. GAP gave representative
        elements consisting of three-cycles and double swaps (along with the
        identity element). Translating to more meaningful notation, these
        representatives are: 1) identity 2) LFD-&gt;FRD-&gt;RBD-&gt;LFD 3)

        of Erno Rubik. She brought one of the original Hungarian made cubes, as
        well as a bunch of literature and clippings about the cube, some of
        which were very intriguing (many in Hungarian). She spoke for a while
        and also showed a brief video clip from Lifestyles of the Rich and

        andy suggestions on how to do it Many cubes are not adjustable. You can
        try using a knife to help get the covers off, but you will probably find
        that the centers are attached with rivets and can't be loosened.
        Your best bet is to buy a do-it-yourself cube from www.rubiks.com. They
        come with screws that you can adjust however you like them.

    Hi David! cool you finally got to this yahoo group... ok, concerning
        your problem, well, it all depends on the type of cube you have, most of
        them don't even have screws, just rivets, and there's no way
        to tighten/loosen them. Also, the caps are glued (or melted) so you
        would have to apply some force to open it. But my advice would be, get a
        DIY kit from rubiks.com and make your own cube the way you like it. And
        guys, this is David, a guy I met probably 3 years ago in the US and
        taught how to solve and he finally made his way to this group. Cool to
        hear from you again, dude! What are your times like these days?
        Franï¿½ois David a ï¿½crit : &gt; &gt; i want to loosen the screws on my 3x3x3
        but i cant get the covers off &gt; the center pieces &gt; andy suggestions on

    Hi Gilles! I can't see how that sequence is travelling through
        Y-commutator space. It can't be solely composed of 4-move
        Y-commutators. Or am i missing something ? RU'R'U -
        UF'U'F ... now already ur sequence is *wrong*. U allow
        pseudoblock setups that are not part of the Y-commutator subgroup. So
        i'm also not sure where u are heading with this... Solving purely
        using Y-commutators is kinda interesting, but allowing pseudo-block
        setups also obfuscates it for me ... Anyway i have 2 new sequences:
        Improved 2-flip of edges:
        [[R',F][F',U][U',R],[R,F']] - 26 turns due to many
        cancellations Edge 3-cycle:
        [R',F][F,U'][F,R'][U',F][U,F'] - 18 turns Have
        fun! -Per &gt; Another sequence that travels through the "Y
        space": &gt; RU'R'U2F'UL2BLB'LU'FU'

    Hi :-) I guess it's simply best of 1 for feetsolving for a few
        reasons. Not that many do feetsolving. Some who do it solve rather
        slowly. And also it requires rearrangement of the competition stage
        normally. There's already many many events and not easy to cram all
        in within reasonable timeframe :-) Happy (feet)cubing :-) -Per &gt; --- In

    Hi. I'm przctising speedcubing with one hand.I have few

        should I use?I suppose that the more fingers I use the faster I solve

    Hi, First, a bit of vocabulary : - Holding hand : in 2-handed solving,
        the hand that doesn't do much more than holding the cube (usually
        the left hand) - Solving hand : in 2-handed solving, the hand that
        actually solves the cube (usually the right hand) So, there are
        different strategies for OH-cubing I have encountered : 1. Use your
        "holding hand" to solve the cube OH. This usually doesn't
        require any modification of algorithms. The only issue is to get used to
        use that hand for solving the cube (= developing dexterity). 2. Use your
        "solving hand" to solve the cube OH and mirror all your
        algorithms. The problem with this solution is that it might take a while
        to mirror all your algorithms (or the ones that need to be mirrored
        actually, but that needs to be done for more than 90% of them I think).
        3. Use your "solving hand" to solve the cube OH and use your
        normal algorithms with a z' cube rotation. This is very good at the
        beginning because you only have to get used to do U for R moves, and L
        for U moves. The only thing is that it might be more difficult to look
        at the cube and so recognizing cases. Personally, I use the strategy
        number 2. I think Marc van Beest uses the 3rd strategy. I don't
        know which one uses Ryan Patricio but I bet on strategy number 1. So I
        think that you have to train a bit on each of them to decide which one
        you like the most. If you have any ideas for other
        "strategies", please let the OH-solvers community know. :p
        Concerning "how I hold the cube", I have to say I have no
        idea. Just look at the videos to find out (strangepuzzle or youtube). (I
        think that's because with practice, you think less and less about
        holding the cube but you focus on solving the cube until the point where
        holding the cube is not a problem at all. That's when you are fast,
        because you fully focus on solving the cube. ;-)) Concerning practice,
        it depends. Some days I don't solve a cube at all because I want to
        rest my hands or I am just very busy. But I usuallly solve at least a
        few cubes OH everyday, but it might go up to 50 or 60 solves if I want
        to practice a lot. :-) Good luck with OH-solving ;-) Gilles. 2006/10/22,
        Tomasz Seweryn &lt;speedcuberfrompoland@...&gt;: &gt; &gt; Hi. &gt; &gt; I'm
        przctising speedcubing with one hand.I have few questions.Do you use &gt;
        the same algorithms as in two hands solving?What is the best position of
        &gt; holding the cube while solving it?How many fingers should I use?I
        suppose &gt; that the more fingers I use the faster I solve the cube?How
        are your &gt; practice going?Ma best time is still 52.12 s but my average
        is 1:02:15 .:) &gt; .How do you do? &gt; &gt; Best wishes &gt; &gt;

        Constantin suggested it because he'd like &gt; &gt; certificates very
        much, and I agree. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He did get one of those RWC glass cubes as
        trophy (I think for &gt; &gt; winning blindfold at the German Open) and just
        like me he doesn't &gt; &gt; like its complete anonymity, it doesn't
        say what he got it for so he &gt; &gt; can't even show that to his
        friends. Plus, you can easily just buy it &gt; &gt; on the internet. It's
        not a trophy. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Certificates on the other hand are easy to make
        personal. Mention &gt; &gt; competition, event, competitor and place, put the
        WCA logo and maybe &gt; &gt; some more graphics on it, let the WCA delegate
        sign it and there you &gt; &gt; go, a very nice (and cheap?) souvenir you can
        also hang on the wall &gt; &gt; so it doesn't waste space. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There
        are of course real trophies and some are quite nice, too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan

        can't see how that sequence is travelling through Y-commutator &gt;

        Maybe you'll understand with a video:
        http://grrroux.free.fr/misc/Y.avi I'm scrambling using such an
        "Y-sequence". Then I solve 4 corners (yellow corners) using
        Y-commutators (any orientation), and the other 4 are automatically
        permuted. It feels natural. When I tried this, I was expecting such a
        result, but I can't explain why it works. What I want is to
        understand and find a way to start from such a subgroup. Gilles.

    Just want to announce, that a new version of my program is available,

        sets faceletcolors for cubies, who's orientation should be ignored.
        Ctrl-key+left mousebutton sets the orientation for cubies, who's
        colors are undefined but have a given orientation (important fo OLL-

    I agree with Stefan, a text input option would be very help. Input from
        a specifiable file would be nearly equivalent though, but ideally both.
        Having a visual cube to work from is nice, but it's net very
        practical when I want to do entire alg sets in one go. I tend to want to
        script batch-runs a lot and that was why I have always choose ACube over
        Cube Explorer. But with the new feature of ignoring stickers, I might
        start using Cube Exploer more if text input was made availible. From a
        programming standpoint this shouldn't be terribly time consuming to
        append. I also think some users might like to be able to downlaod
        previous versions of Cube Exploere from your site, not just the most
        recent. This 4.00s version is making me want to go out and buy 2 more
        gigs of RAM.... -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    Forgot about this in my previous post: You can use the web-interface of
        Cube Explorer for this. I actually build a webpage that uses the
        web-interface of Cube Explorer to do this. I also generated 2 million
        unique cubes and "fed" them to Cube Explorer to see if they
        were al solvable in 20 moves or less (they were). My web-interface is
        still online (http://www.arnaudensandra.nl/pages/
        puzzles/cube3/default.asp) but it doesn't work correctly in Opera/
        Firefox. Also, it is in Dutch, but it should be pretty straight-
        forward: "Verwijder alle kleuren" = "Remove all
        colors" "Begin opnieuw" = "Start over" "Ga
        naar de 3D kubus" = "Go to the 3D Cube" (this is the
        button you are probably looking for) "Bestudeer Arnaud's
        oplossingsschema" = "Study Arnaud's solution"
        (don't do this if you are a speedcuber!) Also, B = U (Boven =&gt; Up)
        O = D (Onder =&gt; Down) V = F (Voor =&gt; Front) A = B (Achter =&gt; Back) L = L

    Hi Herbert :-) I love your cube explorer, but i do have some issues with
        your program: 1 - please delay all error messages about impossible
        configurations until the editing is completed and a solve/generation is
        attempted. The automatic fixes for consistency are usually not what is
        wanted. And it's generally faster to edit a configuration from a
        clean cube than from an empty cube. 2 - please allow to display all
        optimal sequences for a generator or solver. Or even better display all
        optimal AND those who are shorter than a specified length. This is
        highly useful when looking for algorithms that are useful for speeding.
        As an example, most people do prefer the 14-turn T-permutation and not
        the optimal 11-turn one because the optimal one has too many half turns
        and is not fingertrick-friendly. (U F2 U' F2 D R2 B2 U B2 D'
        R2 versus R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U
        R' F'.) One option may be to have a button next to the
        run/stop button that will open a new window showing all algorithms found
        so far. I consider 1 to be a "design flaw", while 2 is highly
        desireable to have included in future version :-) Best wishes! -Per (*

    Hi Arnaud! So how does this webpage use the Cube Explorer? Does the Cube
        Explorer have a COM-interface so that u can use server.createobject ()
        etc etc in asp? Is this documented anywhere? I'd be interested to
        use that interface from PHP instead :D Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        You can use the web-interface of Cube Explorer for this. I actually &gt;
        build a webpage that uses the web-interface of Cube Explorer to do &gt;
        this. I also generated 2 million unique cubes and "fed" them
        to Cube &gt; Explorer to see if they were al solvable in 20 moves or less
        (they &gt; were). &gt; &gt; My web-interface is still online
        (http://www.arnaudensandra.nl/pages/ &gt; puzzles/cube3/default.asp) but it
        doesn't work correctly in Opera/ &gt; Firefox. Also, it is in Dutch,
        but it should be pretty straight- &gt; forward: &gt; "Verwijder alle
        kleuren" = "Remove all colors" &gt; "Begin
        opnieuw" = "Start over" &gt; "Ga naar de 3D kubus"
        = "Go to the 3D Cube" (this is the button you &gt; are probably
        looking for) &gt; "Bestudeer Arnaud's oplossingsschema" =
        "Study Arnaud's &gt; solution" (don't do this if you
        are a speedcuber!) &gt; &gt; Also, &gt; B = U (Boven =&gt; Up) &gt; O = D (Onder =&gt;
        Down) &gt; V = F (Voor =&gt; Front) &gt; A = B (Achter =&gt; Back) &gt; L = L (Links =&gt;

        this is the part of this &gt; &gt; &gt; excellent program I do not like at all.
        No, I do not plan to &gt; &gt; &gt; implement this in the moment. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Herbert &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I meant like ACube. Not necessarily with the same
        syntax, &gt; though &gt; &gt; that would be nice cause then we could use both
        tools writing the &gt; &gt; input only once. But you're a programmer, you
        must like the idea to &gt; &gt; generate input cases with a program and feed
        them into your solver, &gt; &gt; no? Someone wrote he has already entered
        40000+ cubes by hand with &gt; &gt; mouseclicking and that was a year or two
        ago, don't know how far he &gt; &gt; is now. To me, that sounds like an
        insane waste of time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt;

    1. I agree. I have always found that to be very annoying. After using it
        so long I adapted to what it does, so perhaps makes this an option. Then
        the user can pick if they want delayed error messages. Also why not
        leave the cube unchanged when the user is inputing? Whenever I have an
        identical piece the older one vanishes. 2. Allowing all the optimals to
        be displayed would require a minor change in an IDA* algorithm so this
        shouldn't be too much of a problem, but if it is a long list, than
        it should really be piped (sent) to a file. Allowing complete
        sub-optimals... I would imainge that this could explode very fast. Maybe
        one longer than optimal is okay, but any more and you are talking about
        increasing the runtime to maybe an hour or more I suspect. (3.) Yes,
        Yahoo really needs to allow for editing of posts (well restrict it to a
        certain timeframe, say 24hrs before a post is uneditable). The more I
        think about it, the more I want ACube to have a GUI... we are trying to
        turn cube explorer more and more into ACube it seems. I can appreciate
        the simplicity of C.E. for what it is, and I can see that the author is
        trying to target the general public more than "power-users"
        like use cubists. This is what it seems to me. It is fair in many ways
        because, how many people in the world would want these features? Pretty
        much exactly the ppl that use ACube frequently and with varing options
        set. I estimate this to be only 20-30 people in the world. ACube
        (besides a GUI, which I don't particularly need) is nearly perfect
        for what we "power-users" want to do. To make that program any
        better would be to extend it to have (limited) 4x4 and 5x5 capabilities
        (1 yrs of coding I bet). You know what would be great? If some how all
        those cube program authors got together and came up with the ultimate
        program! -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Per

        :-) &gt; &gt; I love your cube explorer, but i do have some issues with your &gt;
        program: &gt; &gt; 1 - please delay all error messages about impossible
        configurations &gt; until the editing is completed and a solve/generation
        is attempted. &gt; The automatic fixes for consistency are usually not what
        is wanted. &gt; And it's generally faster to edit a configuration from
        a clean cube &gt; than from an empty cube. &gt; &gt; 2 - please allow to display
        all optimal sequences for a generator or &gt; solver. Or even better
        display all optimal AND those who are shorter &gt; than a specified length.
        This is highly useful when looking for &gt; algorithms that are useful for
        speeding. As an example, most people &gt; do prefer the 14-turn
        T-permutation and not the optimal 11-turn one &gt; because the optimal one
        has too many half turns and is not &gt; fingertrick-friendly. (U F2 U'
        F2 D R2 B2 U B2 D' R2 versus R U R' &gt; U' R' F R2
        U' R' U' R U R' F'.) One option may be to have
        a button &gt; next to the run/stop button that will open a new window
        showing all &gt; algorithms found so far. &gt; &gt; I consider 1 to be a
        "design flaw", while 2 is highly desireable &gt; to have included
        in future version :-) &gt; &gt; Best wishes! &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; (* corrected post

    Announcing the Negative Time Solving Contest 2006 It's that time of
        the year again! This year, in the United States, Daylight Saving Time
        (DST) will end at 2 AM on Sunday, October 29. For countries in the
        European Union, Summer Time ends at 1 a.m. UT on Sunday, October 29.
        This is your only chance of the year to solve a cube in negative time.
        This year's scrambling algorithm will be available online at
        http://cubefreak.net/negative.html in the afternoon of Saturday, 28th.
        Please send your time to smakisumi at gmail with the subject line
        "Negative Time Solving Contest" and include your name,
        nationality, and negative time (e.g. -59 minutes 42.04 seconds) in the
        message. Also, please indicate whether this is your most negative solve.
        I will submit all new personal records for the Negative time solve
        category on speedcubing.com. To submit your time, you must follow these
        rules. Rules 1. Use the provided algorithm. 2. Begin your solve before
        daylight saving ends and complete the solve after daylight saving ends
        in the time zone in which you live. 3. Please, don't be an idiot!
        Remember that this is an unofficial contest. Please follow all rules you
        would when submitting a record to speedcubing.com. Finally, thanks to
        the cube stud Tyson Mao for bringing this great Caltech tradition to
        cubing. Good luck to everyone! Enjoy, Macky

    Included in the download is a file called "cube.chm", which is
        the helpfile. Open this file, then expand the section "Exploring
        the Cube" and open the chapter "For programmers: The Cube
        Explorer Interface". Now look under "Case A". This is how
        I use this from my ASP-Page. I think it would work exactly the same from
        PHP: On my webserver, I used "srvany.exe" to run
        "cube316.exe" as a service. This is not a necessary step to
        do, but it ensures that Cube Explorer is always running, even if nobody
        is logged on to the webserver. The webinterface of Cube Explorer is
        configured to listen to a specific port is described in the helpfile.
        The disadvantage of this method is that Cube Explorer is always running
        and using memory, but because of the smart memory-handling for services
        by Windows (paging out unused memory if memory is needed by other
        programs/ services) this is not a problem on my server. The first page
        (2d-layout) is used to construct the colors of the facelets The second
        page * receives the colors of the facelets * converts this to the
        querystring Cube Explorer expects * Creates an "XML-Request"
        to Cube Explorers web-interface sending it the querystring * Receives

        please contact me. I would be more than happy to help anyone to do this.
        I think I will extend the second page to accept the input from other
        pages and to output in Dutch and English, but this might take a couple

    You can also use Bayes' theorem to turn the problem around; i.e.,
        estimate a "likelihood function" for the proportion, p, of
        "deep" cubes (p=M/W), given that all N randomly-sampled cubes
        were solved within 20 turns. For this I get "likelihood" =
        L(p) = N*exp(-N*p), where I've assumed that p is small enough for
        (1-p)^N to be approximated well by the exponential, and I've also
        assumed a prior distribution for p that is uniform for small p. But what
        can you conclude from the result for L(p)? Simply that p is unlikely to
        be much bigger than 1/N -- which is obvious anyway. This kind of
        argument becomes a little more informative when you've actually
        found a few "deep" states in your random sample, so that the
        likelihood function has a peak in it for some p&gt;0... This is the case
        for depth-30 states of square-1, for example. M.

        R' D R' D' (Rr)2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 - 15 turns Yes, J-perm

        (DST) will end at 2 AM on Sunday, October 29. For countries in the
        European Union, Summer Time ends at 1 a.m. UT on Sunday, October 29.
        This is your only chance of the year to solve a cube in negative time.
        This year's scrambling algorithm will be available online at
        http://cubefreak.net/negative.html in the afternoon of Saturday, 28th.
        Please send your time to smakisumi at gmail with the subject line
        "Negative Time Solving Contest" and include your name,
        nationality, and negative time (e.g. -59 minutes 42.04 seconds) in the
        message. Also, please indicate whether this is your most negative solve.
        I will submit all new personal records for the Negative time solve
        category on speedcubing.com. To submit your time, you must follow these
        rules. Rules 1. Use the provided algorithm. 2. Begin your solve before
        daylight saving ends and complete the solve after daylight saving ends
        in the time zone in which you live. 3. Please, don't be an idiot!
        Remember that this is an unofficial contest. Please follow all rules you
        would when submitting a record to speedcubing.com. Finally, thanks to
        the cube stud Tyson Mao for bringing this great Caltech tradition to
        cubing. Good luck to everyone! Enjoy, Macky

    Hey everyone, I was at a physics competition on saturday, and one of the
        events was particularly interesting and I wanted to see how you guys
        would go about doing it. Each team breaks into 2 mini teams (2 people
        each). These mini teams are put into seperate rooms and are both given
        differen models. These models are made out of tinker toy or k'nex
        type sets. Your task is to (on paper) describe you model with writing or
        drawings/sketchs or whatever so that the other half of your team in the
        other room can build it. After you finish describing, your paper(s) will
        passed to the other room, and theirs will be passed to you and you must
        attempt to build it. You have 35 minutes total to complete this. How do
        you think you would go about doing this? (my team didn't do very
        well...) Thanks, -Peter Greenwood

    Pedro, you have to be in a place where the "official time"
        changes at a specific time so that you get a negative time. So too bad
        if you are in a country where the time doesn't change during the
        year. But you might want to have a look at the regulations in that case,
        just to make sure. ;-) Have fun ! Gilles 2006/10/24, Per Kristen

    Hi, or this one : F2 U (Rr)2 U2 F2 r2 F2 U2 (Rr)2 U' F2 I think we
        could find a good speedcubing alg for each case, with only one inner

        inner slice turns. And wow, you like my opposite swap plus &gt; a whole

        all your algorithms are pretty much the same as my second &gt; suggestion

    Yea, they were the first things that caught my eye when I was looking
        for something to be a house. If we had more time we probably could have
        made something nicer but we didn't have much time so we just
        sharpied windows on the boxes and used them. Also, if we had more time
        we probably could have taken more photos and had more frames for the
        movie and it could have been smoother. Oh well. --- In

    Haha, the most interesting aspect is that you only get one chance a
        year, so this could be quite interesting if you solve, for example,
        blindfolded. Imagine doing a successful blindfolded average over 12
        years! That would be amazing even though it would probably also say a
        lot about your social life. So feel free to do more than just speedsolve

    I think it's a nice feature, but it has to be used honestly.
        However, if a site links a single video from your server, then there
        will be some bias (is that how you call it in English ?) in the download
        statistics because that video has a lot more chances to be downloaded
        than others. On the contrary, the fact that a video is linked from
        another site could be a sign that the video is interesting, therefore
        justifying the fact that it gets more hits. So I really can't make
        a choice, but if it appears that someone has fun in changing
        significatively the "results", then the ranking doesn't
        mean anything any more. To conclude : that's up to you to decide if
        it is the case or not. ;-) Have fun ! Gilles. 2006/10/25, Chris Hunt

    No, there are 22 parity PLL's :p. If two diagonal corners need to

    Hi Pedro, I think that last scene was Power Ranger inspired =p. To
        answer your question, we just used tape to stick the arms and legs on. I
        couldn't get ahold of any duct tape though and the tape we used
        wasn't that great on the tiled cubes that I have and so it kept
        falling off. What we ended up doing was pressing really hard to get the
        arm to stay on, taking a photo really quickly, the arm would then fall
        off and then we would move the robot to where we wanted the next shot,
        and press it on again. The movie was finished pretty quickly. We did the
        whole thing in under 48 hours, from when we started shooting to turning
        it in. For campus moviefest, what they do is give you a laptop and a
        camcorder to use for a week to make a movie. My friend and I didn't
        come up with an idea for a movie until really late Friday night when the
        movie was due Monday. We started shooting around Saturday at 11 PM or
        so, shot until 4:30 in the morning and then again Sunday night starting
        around 9PM. We shot until around 5:30 AM and then it was 12 hours of
        editing and then submitting it at 6 PM Monday. We didn't want to
        shoot during the day because stop motion animation takes a while to do
        and we wanted the lighting in the film to be consistent and that would
        be harder with the light outside changing as the sun moves. I think if
        we had more time, we could have taken 2 or maybe even 3 times the number
        of shots and it would have looked a lot smoother. Oh well though, I
        still like how it came out. =) Dan --- In

    Ahhh ... Then i can just cheat: (r2 u2)*2 = ((Rr)2 R2 (Uu)2 U2)*2 Voila
        no inner layer turns :-P Well, this is in fact the new standard for

    Hi again :-) Ok, i managed to compile it. It was very easy using
        CodeBlocks ;-) I tried running it for the case 10 (of Frederick). This
        gives input RYWOROYW according to ur notes. After a short while the
        program just crashes ungracefully... I still prefer u to compile it for
        me. I'm no expert on C++. It failed also for the simple 6 turn
        permutation parity. So the code is not compiled and linked properly

        there is no need for iTunes (I would never use it either). Instead, try

    Another one, case 4 : R2 Uu2 F2 R2 Uu2 F2 R2 U' R2 F2 R2 U' F2
        Uu2 14 moves 0 slice :) I think the problem must be your lack of memory
        It takes me about 700-800 Mo to run, how much do you have ? I'm
        using GNU/Linux, so I can't give you a binary right now, sorry. But
        I will ask some (very few) friends who are using Windows to compile it.
        ;) If your have less memory, just change the depth research to 4 (the
        QUEUE_DEPTH_SOLVED and QUEUE_DEPTH_SCRAMBLED constants) It will use a
        lot less memory. And if your have uncommmented the #define MIN_TWIST,
        just comment it. Do you have messages that explains the crash ? (except

    Hi, there are 4 cubes which have the highest possible symmetry:
        identity(0f*),Pons Asinorum (6f*), Superflip (20f*) and Pons Asinorum
        composed with Superflip (19f*). From more than 30,000 cubes we know that
        they need 20f* moves. We even know, that all cubes which have *any*
        symmetry can be solved within 20f* moves. So from this point of view
        there is nothing special about superflip. If it is an antipode, than
        there are tenthousands of others, many of them lacking any symmetry. If
        there is an antipode with 21f*, then it has no symmetry at all. In this
        case there are at least 48 antipodes, because the conjugation with any
        of the 48 cube symmetries gives a different cube. &gt; If
        "anyone" is supposed to be me, I´ll quote myself (#8180): &gt; &gt;
        For me - and quite intutively - the superflip represents the highest
        symmetri in &gt; relation to the null point. If that is true (that it does
        have the highest &gt; symmetri), a bold hypothesis would be that this flip
        represents the (only) &gt; diameter of the cube. Other points of "less
        symmetri" may very well be local &gt; maxima in the system. &gt; (I know,

    Per, I compiled it with Dev-C++:

    Hi Herbert :-) How many cubes/configurations have the highest order of
        symmetry on the 5x5x5 cube ?? I haven't really tried to figure this
        out but it must be quite a bit higher at least. And why can't the
        Cube Explorer use tables when ignoring parts of the cube. ACube clearly
        does this and works using the 2-phase algorithm even when ignoring parts
        of the cube. So i would say that for ignoring parts of the cube ACube
        wins hands down. But for normal fully specified configurations Cube
        Explorer is way faster. ACube gives many (optimal) solutions. ACube
        however has no GUI or web interface. So it's good to have both i
        guess ;-) -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        others, many of &gt; them lacking any symmetry. If there is an antipode
        with 21f*, then it &gt; has no symmetry at all. In this case there are at
        least 48 antipodes, &gt; because the conjugation with any of the 48 cube
        symmetries gives a &gt; different cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If "anyone" is
        supposed to be me, I´ll quote myself (#8180): &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For me - and quite
        intutively - the superflip represents the &gt; highest symmetri in &gt; &gt;
        relation to the null point. If that is true (that it does have &gt; the
        highest &gt; &gt; symmetri), a bold hypothesis would be that this flip
        represents &gt; the (only) &gt; &gt; diameter of the cube. Other points of
        "less symmetri" may very &gt; well be local &gt; &gt; maxima in the
        system. &gt; &gt; (I know, it´s not quite sympathetic to - like Goldbach -
        make &gt; more or less vague &gt; &gt; conjectures, but after all, they are there
        for being proved (or &gt; refuted)). &gt; &gt; Rune &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Hi Per, I almost know nothing about the 5x5x5, for example what
        restrictions exist for the orientations and permutations of the edges
        etc. So I really do not know the answer. Concerning Cube Explorer and
        ignoring parts: Indeed ACube is faster in general. But I was surprised,
        how fast CE is without using *big* tables (it also uses some tables, but
        the tables which have to be created for the individual cubes are small
        and that is why there is almost no initialization time when starting the
        search). I use some additional tables for certain configurations, for
        example when all 8 corners are defined. I only implemented an optimal
        solver for the "uncomplete" case, not the two-phase algorithm,
        because I found an optimal solution to the problems I entered always in
        a reasonable time. I would be interested for which usefull
        configurations you think my implementation is yet too slow. Herbert

    Hi Cube Folks -- I got an email from the D.E. Shaw group inviting me to
        send a resume due to my Rubik's Cube involvement. I was curious if
        others got the same email - it looks like they were essentially scanning
        either competiion results or unofficial world records and doing a mass
        emailing. It's a real company doing real investment, technical and
        research work (www.deshaw.com) and thinking about it, for a company like
        that, trying to recruit from a group of puzzle solvers is probably a
        pretty good idea. Here's the start of the email: "The D. E.
        Shaw group is currently looking to hire a small number of truly gifted
        individuals with backgrounds in mathematics, computer science, and other
        technical fields. I came across your name while looking for people who
        have competed successfully in Rubik's Cube World Competitions. A
        mastery of algorithms and puzzles, computational proficiency and
        analytical curiosity -- these same skills that made you formidable in
        cubing competitions are highly valued in our staff. If you might be
        interested in exploring employment opportunities with us, I invite you
        to submit a copy of your resume" I don't think I'll
        respond, because I'm happy in my current job at HP, but I was
        curious if everyone else got this email as well?? yeff

    At some of the job fairs here at UC Berkeley, companies normally give
        out pens or keychains or things of that nature but when D.E. Shaw is
        here, they give out Rubik's cubes. I always try and go to those job
        fairs and get a couple if I can =p Actually, now that I think about it,
        I first started solving Rubik's cubes on the D.E. Shaw cube they

        Cube involvement. I was curious if others got the &gt; same email - it
        looks like they were essentially scanning either &gt; competiion results or
        unofficial world records and doing a mass &gt; emailing. &gt; &gt; It's a
        real company doing real investment, technical and research &gt; work
        (www.deshaw.com) and thinking about it, for a company like &gt; that,
        trying to recruit from a group of puzzle solvers is probably a &gt; pretty
        good idea. &gt; &gt; Here's the start of the email: &gt; &gt; "The D. E.
        Shaw group is currently looking to hire a small number of &gt; truly gifted
        individuals with backgrounds in mathematics, computer &gt; science, and
        other technical fields. I came across your name while &gt; looking for
        people who have competed successfully in Rubik's Cube &gt; World
        Competitions. A mastery of algorithms and puzzles, &gt; computational
        proficiency and analytical curiosity -- these same &gt; skills that made
        you formidable in cubing competitions are highly &gt; valued in our staff.
        If you might be interested in exploring &gt; employment opportunities with
        us, I invite you to submit a copy of &gt; your resume" &gt; &gt; I
        don't think I'll respond, because I'm happy in my current
        job at &gt; HP, but I was curious if everyone else got this email as well??

    Hello For my program, the U-PLL takes 9 moves, it doesn't count
        R' L as one move. So the whole algorithm takes 15 turns, that why
        my program gives me the 14 moves algorithm first. My program search for

    Hi :-) Yes, i have also downloaded and seen that movie now. First i
        viewed it with MPlayer which was a bit annoying since it's a
        commandline based program. But it does support a wide range of codecs.
        After updating my old VLC to the latest version i was able to view it
        there also. My Media Player won't let me view it. There could be a
        codec somewhere that would work with Media Player, but i cannot be

        such cube? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It would be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 - P(meeting no such
        cube) = 1 - ((W-M)/W)^N &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where W = number of possible
        scrambles (4.3e19). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Especially, say there are 4.6x10^8
        scrambles (not so few) that &gt; &gt; &gt; request more than 20 moves to be
        solved, which is the probability &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; find at least one when
        testing 500000 scrambles? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Approximately M*N/W = 5.3e-6 &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Hi Clément! Ok, now ur programs works just fine. How do i stop the
        searching when im satisfied with what it has found already? I found out
        that at least it works to use the pause button ;-) Closing the window
        then i just lose the solutions. Would be nice to have the solutions
        written to a file instead of just to the screen (hint) :-) -Per &gt; --- In

    HI everyone, Seeing videos for the 6x6x6 and now 7x7x7! on
        Olympicube.com got me thinking about the possible fastest times that
        could be achieved on these puzzles, and also whether there is a general
        formula which one could use to predict the limits for solving any
        general nxnxn cube. Doing a little bit of analysis, I would like to
        propose the following formula, which I humbly call Harris' Law. t =
        0.2777*[n^3 - (n-2)^3 - 6mod(n/2)]^1.3272 - 0.53n This is a prediction
        for the achievable limit in seconds (average time, not single time) for
        a puzzle of side length n in a WCA competition. This suggests that the
        WR average for 6x6 would settle around 3:35 - and for 7x7, around 5:35.

    Hi :-) Yes that's what he means. I plotted it in Excel like that
        and i got same numbers as Dan did, so that must be correct. I guess Dan
        is simply scaling up the number of cubies to be solved. Not counting
        very middle centers on odd sized cubes since they are fixed anyway.

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seeing videos for the 6x6x6 and now 7x7x7! on
        Olympicube.com &gt; got me &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking about the possible fastest
        times that could be &gt; achieved on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these puzzles, and also
        whether there is a general formula &gt; which one &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could use to
        predict the limits for solving any general nxnxn &gt; cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Doing a little bit of analysis, I would like to propose the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        following &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formula, which I humbly call Harris' Law. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t = 0.2777*[n^3 - (n-2)^3 - 6mod(n/2)]^1.3272 - 0.53n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a prediction for the achievable limit in seconds &gt;
        (average &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, not single time) for a puzzle of side length n in
        a WCA &gt; &gt; &gt; competition. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This suggests that the WR
        average for 6x6 would settle around &gt; 3:35 - &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and for 7x7, around
        5:35. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dan H :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Huh? Summer Time ends at 3 am in Belgium? Also, I should have included
        in the rules that you get at most 15 seconds of pinspection. So
        everyone: if you've already scrambled, it doesn't matter for
        this year, but if you haven't, don't scramble until you do the
        actual solve. I think it was as late as 10 pm in some parts of Europe

    How did you derive this? &gt; HI everyone, &gt; &gt; Seeing videos for the 6x6x6

    HI, First of all I related the number of solvable pieces to the time
        taken to solve. so n is transformed into the number of pieces by the
        [n^3 - (n-2)^3 - 6mod(n/2)] terms. For the cubes we have data for (2x2 -
        5x5), I assumed we had reached the limits for 3x3x3 solving (I think
        13.22 is a very hard record to beat). I then fitted a curve using a
        regression technique, and subtracted an error term which I think is OK
        to base on the size of the cube. But remember, this is just for fun, not
        a rigorous mathematical procedure, because we are not talking about
        something that can be analytically determined. And the fact that it
        gives a nice fit to the current data is a nice quirk. Dan :) --- In

    I never got such an e-mail. It makes me kinda sad... I've been
        applying to lot of jobs lately and that would have been nice to see.
        After looking through their job descriptions though, I feel rather
        intimidated though. At the last job fair I went to Mathworks was giving
        out cubes (the ppl that develop the Matlab program). Microsoft sometimes
        does too. The only reason I heard of that company DEShaw is that they
        sponser ARML (a math competition where Macky was caught juggling), and I
        got some free mugs and key chain with their logo on them. Anyone here
        want to help me in the door for a job? I'm interested in companies

    You get sub 10 minute times on it already. I am so jealous that you got
        a chance to play with it. It looked like you had some trouble keeping
        the layers aligned during edges step though. But you breezed through the
        finish. The last center seemed to take a few tries and it looked like
        you finally went for a commutator for it. Because the middle layers are
        more pillowed, do you think that keeping the layers aligned will be much
        of a problem after some practice? I think I would do edges a little
        differently on the 7, but I haven't really thought about it much. I
        can't stand virtual cubes that size unfortunately. I want to get my

    I also got it. Like Koen, I initially thought it was junk mail, but
        noticed the "Rubik" part before deleting it. I think it's
        a great way to recruit people, since they're looking for a certain
        kind of person rather than someone who won't require as much
        training. Also, it seems that they had to do at least a bit of research

    I think (maybe) one of the reasons is this: Usually methods that use
        fewer moves have a lot of thinking time since you are doing things
        yourself. So they think that thinking must waste time. But what if you
        get used to everything with practice? You only think while looking
        ahead. Which means no pauses at all. --- In

        (15,1) The one with the * is the best one for me. What do you think ?
        I've also searched for the best algorithm for case 3, as those with
        the minimal number of moves contains 7 slices, but when I sort all the
        algorithms by number of moves + number of slices, the only ones are 11
        moves + 7 slices and 13 moves + 5 slices. One exemple : r2 Uu2 r2 b2
        U' r2 b2 U b2 Uu2 r2 (11,7) R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2 b2 U' r2 b2 U b2
        Uu2 r2 (13,5) We see that the end of the algorithm is the same, and
        personnaly I find quicker to do r2 Uu2 (with the thumb) r2 than R2 Uu2
        Rr2 Uu2 R2. So I think the 11 moves algs must be the fastest algs to do.
        Finally, for case 5, a weird alg (again, 14 moves without the final U):
        L2 Uu2 U' L2 U' F2 Uu2 U' F2 U L2 Uu2 F2 L2 U (15,0) it
        can be done very fast like that : z U2 Rr2 R' U2 R' F2 Rr2

        prefer u to compile it for me. I'm no expert on C++. It &gt; &gt; failed
        also for the simple 6 turn permutation parity. So the code is &gt; &gt; not

    I find it rather unsatisfying that no one has offered a solution to this
        problem yet. Is the &lt;u,R&gt; group really that untractable? It only has
        two generators! I have been thinking about it for a few weeks now, and
        everytime I bring it up no one has been able to help me. Perhaps this
        was discussed in an earlier topic, but I can't find it. Can anyone
        direct me to any relevant infromation? I am solving CF, and need to
        rotate the centers and have no idea how to do this. I think solving CF
        is a good method. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        :-) &gt; &gt; I have been thinking a little about solving the 3x3x3 cube by
        only &gt; using the moves (generators) R and u, where u would mean turning
        the &gt; top 2 layers. So u = U E' obviously :-) (For those who know
        MES &gt; notation!) Otherwise u is well-known fingertrick notation too! &gt; &gt;
        What i have come up with so far is a short 2-flip on edges like so: &gt; &gt;
        (R u2)*2 R' u2 R' u (R' u2)*2 R u2 R u' &gt; &gt; And also
        a non-disclosed edge 3-cycle of same length (challenge). &gt; Could we
        together make up a collection of useful algs to completely &gt; solve the

        searched for the best algorithm for case 3, as those with &gt; the minimal
        number of moves contains 7 slices, but when I sort all the &gt; algorithms
        by number of moves + number of slices, the only ones are 11 &gt; moves + 7
        slices and 13 moves + 5 slices. &gt; &gt; One exemple : &gt; &gt; r2 Uu2 r2 b2
        U' r2 b2 U b2 Uu2 r2 (11,7) &gt; R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2 b2 U' r2 b2 U
        b2 Uu2 r2 (13,5) &gt; &gt; We see that the end of the algorithm is the same,
        and personnaly I &gt; find quicker to do r2 Uu2 (with the thumb) r2 than R2
        Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2. &gt; &gt; So I think the 11 moves algs must be the fastest
        algs to do. &gt; &gt; Finally, for case 5, a weird alg (again, 14 moves
        without the final U): &gt; &gt; L2 Uu2 U' L2 U' F2 Uu2 U' F2 U
        L2 Uu2 F2 L2 U (15,0) &gt; &gt; it can be done very fast like that : &gt; &gt; z U2
        Rr2 R' U2 R' F2 Rr2 R' F2 R U2 Rr2 F2 U2 z' &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Like u had written it it means U u2 which is counted as 2 &gt; &gt; &gt;

        think ? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've also searched for the best algorithm for case
        3, as those with &gt; &gt; the minimal number of moves contains 7 slices, but
        when I sort all the &gt; &gt; algorithms by number of moves + number of
        slices, the only ones are 11 &gt; &gt; moves + 7 slices and 13 moves + 5
        slices. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One exemple : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; r2 Uu2 r2 b2 U' r2 b2 U b2
        Uu2 r2 (11,7) &gt; &gt; R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2 b2 U' r2 b2 U b2 Uu2 r2 (13,5)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We see that the end of the algorithm is the same, and personnaly
        I &gt; &gt; find quicker to do r2 Uu2 (with the thumb) r2 than R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2
        R2. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I think the 11 moves algs must be the fastest algs to do.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, for case 5, a weird alg (again, 14 moves without the
        final U): &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; L2 Uu2 U' L2 U' F2 Uu2 U' F2 U L2 Uu2
        F2 L2 U (15,0) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it can be done very fast like that : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; z U2
        Rr2 R' U2 R' F2 Rr2 R' F2 R U2 Rr2 F2 U2 z' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        think I've found my mistake. &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is the size of the
        arrays which are not as big as they &gt; &gt; &gt; must be. The whole program is
        still under development :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've fixed that, so just
        download again, it should work. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry again, &gt; &gt; &gt; Clément &gt;

        crashes ungracefully... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still prefer u to compile it
        for me. I'm no expert on C++. It &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; failed also for the simple
        6 turn permutation parity. So the &gt; &gt; code is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not compiled and
        linked properly here. I works fine until i &gt; &gt; supply &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my input

        &gt; &gt; &gt; For case 14, the program found several algorithms which
        doesn't sound &gt; &gt; &gt; very good. Here are all starting with Rr2, with

        in fact 14 moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rr2 B2 U2 R2 Ff2 D Bb2 D2 Rr2 U' Bb2

        (15,1) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The one with the * is the best one for me. What do
        you think ? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've also searched for the best algorithm
        for case 3, as those with &gt; &gt; &gt; the minimal number of moves contains 7
        slices, but when I sort all the &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms by number of moves +
        number of slices, the only ones are 11 &gt; &gt; &gt; moves + 7 slices and 13
        moves + 5 slices. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One exemple : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; r2 Uu2 r2 b2
        U' r2 b2 U b2 Uu2 r2 (11,7) &gt; &gt; &gt; R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2 b2 U' r2
        b2 U b2 Uu2 r2 (13,5) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We see that the end of the algorithm
        is the same, and personnaly I &gt; &gt; &gt; find quicker to do r2 Uu2 (with the
        thumb) r2 than R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I think the 11 moves
        algs must be the fastest algs to do. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, for case 5, a
        weird alg (again, 14 moves without the &gt; final U): &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; L2 Uu2
        U' L2 U' F2 Uu2 U' F2 U L2 Uu2 F2 L2 U (15,0) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        it can be done very fast like that : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; z U2 Rr2 R' U2
        R' F2 Rr2 R' F2 R U2 Rr2 F2 U2 z' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Sorry, I think I've found my mistake. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is the
        size of the arrays which are not as big &gt; as they &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; must be. The
        whole program is still under development :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've
        fixed that, so just download again, it should work. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    For case 14 maybe you can try this: (Rr)2 f2 U2 (Ff)2 U' (Rr)2 U2

        the * is the best one for me. What do you think ? &gt; &gt; I've also
        searched for the best algorithm for case 3, as those with &gt; the minimal
        number of moves contains 7 slices, but when I sort all the &gt; algorithms
        by number of moves + number of slices, the only ones are 11 &gt; moves + 7
        slices and 13 moves + 5 slices. &gt; &gt; One exemple : &gt; &gt; r2 Uu2 r2 b2
        U' r2 b2 U b2 Uu2 r2 (11,7) &gt; R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2 b2 U' r2 b2 U
        b2 Uu2 r2 (13,5) &gt; &gt; We see that the end of the algorithm is the same,
        and personnaly I &gt; find quicker to do r2 Uu2 (with the thumb) r2 than R2
        Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2. &gt; &gt; So I think the 11 moves algs must be the fastest
        algs to do. &gt; &gt; Finally, for case 5, a weird alg (again, 14 moves
        without the final U): &gt; &gt; L2 Uu2 U' L2 U' F2 Uu2 U' F2 U
        L2 Uu2 F2 L2 U (15,0) &gt; &gt; it can be done very fast like that : &gt; &gt; z U2
        Rr2 R' U2 R' F2 Rr2 R' F2 R U2 Rr2 F2 U2 z' &gt; &gt; &gt;

        feeling that the old dedge swap is easier to integrate because it
        starts/ends with an inner slice only so combined with an out layer turn
        it just becomes a double layer turn. My dedge swaps start/end with a
        double layer turn, so combined with an outer layer turn they become an
        inner layer turn. Geez, how the hell did you guys get cancellations at

    Hi :-) Well the way i found my contributions was simply to look at
        normal PLL algs from 3x3x3 cube, and then track how the edges move
        around. In some cases i did the permutation parity with edges at UF and
        DF location or UR and DR. And so on. And also there's at least 4
        useful permutation parity algs: 1 - r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 (Chris
        Hardwick) 2 - U2 r2 U2 (r2 (Uu)2)*2 (my modification of #1) 3 - (Rr)2
        (Ff)2 U2 r2 U2 (Ff)2 (Rr)2 (Stefan Pochmann) 4 - (Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2 r2 U2
        (Rr)2 (Uu)2 (Stefan Pochmann) Having so many permutation parity algs
        gives quite good opportunities for move cancellations :-) Oh, and also
        don't forget that we have either: perm. parity + PLL or PLL + perm.
        parity or some insertion scenario ... -Per &gt; --- In

        get the feeling that the old dedge swap is easier to integrate &gt; because
        it starts/ends with an inner slice only so combined with an &gt; out layer
        turn it just becomes a double layer turn. My dedge swaps &gt; start/end
        with a double layer turn, so combined with an outer layer &gt; turn they
        become an inner layer turn. Geez, how the hell did you guys &gt; get

    Hmm, if you want to solve corners first, I suggest doing Guimond method
        for that bit and then solving the centers in 2 moves which can mostly
        done with solving the first edge at the same time. And if you want only

    Hi group =) Messing up the cross is something we all do a little now and
        then... So I decided to create some short and easy to learn algs that
        can come in handy when trouble is there. Take a look at my page:
        http://members.chello.se/solgrop/kub/Xfix.HTM To learn the algs fast
        just build a random cross and fix it at the end using tha algs at my
        page. After 20-30 cubes something you probably now the algs pretty well.

        &gt; Bernett &amp; John Long (but nice) story already... then again, no
        wonder you have lots to tell when you get into a very different culture
        the first time. I'm very happy you were able to come and that you
        enjoyed it. Looking forward to the rest of the story, I had to laugh a
        few times already :-) Little correction: I've teamsolved
        successfully with others before, but not nearly as well as with you, our
        F2L recognition seems to be very similar and we also share quite a few
        LL algs. Was a lot of fun teamsolving with you. And congrats again for
        all your great results! Funny how you make it sound like you barely made
        it to the 3x3 final when in fact you finished 2nd in the semi-final...
        Cheers! Stefan

    If we go by the &lt;20%=lucky definition... For Fridrich solvers, a
        non-lucky LL occurs (215/216)(71/72) = 98.1% of the time. Thus, a
        non-lucky LL occurs 12 for 12 times ((215/216) (71/72))^12 = 79.997% of
        the time. So you get at least one lucky solve just over 20% of the time
        in an average of 12, so 1 lucky solve isn't lucky in an average.
        The probability of getting exactly one lucky solve is (12 C 1) (.981)^11
        (1-.981)^1 = 18.04%, leaving about a 2% chance of 2 or more lucky
        solves, which is definately lucky. Continuing this process gives about a
        0.0051% chance of getting 4 or more lucky solves. I think we can agree
        that that is lucky. So, I would argue that average to be lucky. In fact,
        any Fridrich average with &gt;1 lucky solve is lucky by my definition. Tim

        wasn't able to be at Dutch Open to meet you, maybe we shall meet at

    I have several Rubik's cubes (3x3x3), but they are all the 25th
        Anniv. versions. I am a little disappointed in how clunky the movement
        is. I have tried lubricating them, but I was hoping there is a site that
        sells pre-lubricated cubes that are higher quality than the standard
        store-bought ones. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know!

    Hi :-) Those cubes are not mass produced to the best of my knowledge. So
        ur best bet is to stumble upon one of those at ebay or u can ask some od
        the puzzlebuilder guys at www.twistypuzzles.com if they know where u can
        get one. As a last resort make them urself. It's not extremely
        hard. Apart from bandaging, simple fusing are probably the easiest
        puzzle modifications. (Not counting restickering or swapping pieces.)

    Hi, I forgot the first question. I'm quite sure that a lucky solve
        would still be a valid time. Especially for the single solve categories.
        There is DNF and the 2 second penalty for "over-misalignment".
        DNF only covers pops (cancelled solve) and not fully solved
        cubes/puzzles. DNF does NOT include lucky cases to the best of my
        knowledge. If im wrong im sure someone out there will correct me. The
        full official regulations are available here:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations.html and were discussed in
        this group and here:
        http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?
        p=297&amp;sid=f39af6690bd299f9405f623866d1cc7a -Per PS! Btw, there is
        also DNS (did not start) when a participnat does not show up for a solve
        or chooses not to use the attempt. &gt; --- In

    Answer 1 - No matter lucky or not, the fastest solve is the world record
        Answer 2 - Siamese cubes are really easy to make. Just take 2 cubes and
        glue 2 corners and one edge together so that connectors are placed so
        that the corners connect to one cube and the edge to the other. For a
        triamese, just repeat the operation with other cubies. Have fun !
        Gilles. (this way is not like the official one (with an edge that has 2
        connectors (one in each cube)), but it will work I'm sure (someone

    I would suggest a DIY cube from www.rubiks.com. The screws are under the
        center caps and are what holds the centers to the spindle. Newer cubes
        don't always have screws. I've found that one of mine has more
        of a corkscrew thread pattern rather than real threads. You can check by
        taking an exacto knife and separate the cap from the center carefully. I
        would still suggest a DIY kit as they allow you to make adjustments much
        easier and allow for more of an exact adjustment. qoxc_dennis

        the usual double-blue edge etc, then I saw they have an
        "explanation" for it, namely pure face (not layer) rotations.
        However, the story implies that it takes place inside the regular cube
        the kid plays with. Plus, sometimes you can see two centers of the same
        color. But I like the music (particularly the sax part), so... thumbs
        up. Oh hey, a normal cube plus additional face turning. That's
        equivalent to the 5x5 centers, right? This could actually be fairly easy
        to build. Similarly a face turning 2x2 might be built from a 4x4.
        I'm not sure about the 5x5/3x3 yet but I think the 4x4/2x2 could be
        done simply by extending the centers outwards and adding new larger
        surface squares. Cheers! Stefan

    HI Dwayne, That is a nice tip, thanks. It is useful when you are
        learning in the LL to be able to have some tricks to help you get more
        speed, easily. However, I would think most "expert" cubers are
        able to recognise the PLL without having to refer to the F2L colours for
        guidance. This is something you can achieve with a lot of practice,
        being able to recognise the PLL by looking at two sides (6 stickers)
        only. Lars Vandenbergh, and I think, Katsu Konishi were the first guys
        to do this, however please correct me if this is wrong, somebody. All
        the best, DanH --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    Hi cubers, I am just curious what you think about this subject. We all
        know that pops are not 'allowed' during official competition
        since this year. But if you are practicing and doing an average of 10
        and you have a pop, will you take a pop? Or do you always just resume

    Don't lube it too often, and make sure you clean it (with some
        paper towels or something dry) before you lube it. And don't put
        too much lube on either, you only need a few drops of silicon spray,

    Hi Andrew, You might find (as I have done), that not many companies are
        willing to give you sponsorship, because, as you point out, making their
        money worth while is the onyl reason they would sponsor you, and with
        most companies that's just not going to happen. Companies that may
        sponsor (and are certainly worth the effort investigating), are toy
        shops, and distributors of cubes in your area. If you want sponsorship
        to do the Rubik's cube, you have to consider that the only thing
        you will be helping to promote is the Rubik's Cube... so any
        company that is interested in increased sales of cubes may be interested
        in you. Perhaps if you used a StackMat then the StackMat people might
        help you too... I don't know about that one :) All the best, DanH

    I have found that I develop better technique for looking ahead when my
        cube is getting slow, because of the forced reduction in turning speed.
        But I develop better technique with finger tricks when my cube is fast,
        because they're so much easier. So I purposely wait until my times
        start slipping significantly to re-lube (about once every 4-6 weeks).
        Each time I do re-lube, I get an instant time increase of a second or

    I wouldn't say "most" but "some" cubers do
        (myself included) In the example Johannes gave, I think it would be
        simple to do d2 T-perm, rather than what he suggests, but for me (and I

        do you always just resume the solve (or &gt; take a DNF)? &gt; &gt; I myself will

    Dear Cubers, I just noticed in www.speedcubing.com that I am the fastest
        asian in 2006 in solving 3*3*3 single solve(12.41 sec), third fastest in
        3*3*3 avg, fastest in solving 4*4*4 single solve(61.86 sec). And also
        officially the youngest to solve a 3*3*3 cube blindfolded. I just can

        and helped me. My special thanks are due to Ron uncle and Stefan uncle.

        That is a nice tip, thanks. It is useful when you are learning in &gt; &gt; &gt;
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LL to be able to have some tricks to help you get more
        speed, &gt; &gt; &gt; easily. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I would think most
        "expert" cubers are able to recognise &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PLL
        without having to refer to the F2L colours for guidance. This is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        something you can achieve with a lot of practice, being able to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        recognise the PLL by looking at two sides (6 stickers) only. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Lars Vandenbergh, and I think, Katsu Konishi were the first guys to
        &gt; &gt; &gt; do &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this, however please correct me if this is wrong,
        somebody. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All the best, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DanH &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---

        &gt; &gt; &gt; speeding up the transition from OLL to PLL. I use Fridrich Method

        F face to see &gt; &gt; &gt; what &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; color it is to more quickly line up
        the U face for my PLL. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This may already be common knowledge to
        you experts, but I &gt; &gt; &gt; though it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could possibly help some

    Hi Michael! I mean, if I use one of the timers on a computer and I make
        a POP the program waits for a 13th solve to make an average. Maybe
        I'm wrong, but it seems that good timers should need this

    Does this really matter? You can also calculate your avg manual (with a

        do this. So I don't see why that is a real problem. Michael Fung

    The best advice is to just do a lot of practice solves. Personally, I
        have just gradually built up a good recognition of each case over time,
        I haven't worked particularly hard at it, but it's something
        that just takes time and practice and experience. You will know when you
        get to the point of mastering it, when you can just glance at the cube
        after OLL and just "know" the case you are dealing with. Dan

    And why do you have to click on POP if you have a POP? With Jnetcube you
        can also add a very large time (sothat it will be ignored as worst

    Hi Michael, I would like to add that the general procedure for
        'official rules' UWR is to have the timer start by releasing
        your fingers from the keyboard (same for Stackmat). It is possible to
        start too early (unintentionally) when you start at the beep. Have fun,

        am just curious what you think about this subject. We all know &gt; that &gt;
        &gt; pops are not 'allowed' during official competition since
        this &gt; year. &gt; &gt; But if you are practicing and doing an average of 10
        and you have &gt; a &gt; &gt; pop, will you take a pop? Or do you always just
        resume the solve &gt; (or &gt; &gt; take a DNF)? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I myself will never take
        pops anymore, because it is also not &gt; allowed &gt; &gt; during competitions.

    Hi Ron, I totally agree. When I didn't have a stackmat yet I also
        did this (I used Jess Bondes timer). The way I did it was this: I set
        the countdown time at 0 sec. Then after preinspection I will press the
        spacebar with the fingers of both hands. Note that if the spacebar is
        still pressed the timer will not start! When I am ready my fingers
        release the spacebar, sothat the timer will start. And when I am ready
        with the solve I stopped the timer by hitting the spacebar with both
        hands. Btw, wouldn't it also a good idea to make the standard for
        5x5x5 avg an "avg of 10" instead of an "avg of 5"
        (or at least add this category). Because (almost) all other avgs on
        speedcubing.com are also avg of 10. In my opinion 7 solves is not enough
        for an (unofficial) avg. Just a suggestion. Michael Fung --- In

    I dislike having to wait for the pre-inspection timer to finish before
        starting the solve. For that reason, I also set the pre-inspection timer
        to 0 seconds in JNetCube. The downside of this is I don't get my
        pre-inspection period timed. I think you should press/release the space
        bar once to start the pre-inspection timer, then press and release space
        bar again to start the solve timer. If the timer is started too late,
        the program could also measure how late it was started, and do something
        appropriate. I also think it would be nice if JNetCube would stop the
        timer when the space bar is pressed down. At least on PCs, the timer is
        stopped when the space bar is released, not when it is pressed down. -

    Hi Emanuele It's not a problem at all. If you pop, then you fix it
        and continue the solve until your done, exactly as you do in
        competition. Your timer program will never know you had a POP so it wont
        wait for a 13th solve, (If it does not have eyes, I assume it has not =)

    You should just force yourself not to do any cube rotations (except the
        ones included in the algorithms) when you reach the OLL step.
        That's what I'm doing for the moment and I hit more and more

        The best advice is to just do a lot of practice solves. Personally, I &gt;
        have just gradually built up a good recognition of each case over &gt;
        time, I haven't worked particularly hard at it, but it's
        something &gt; that just takes time and practice and experience. &gt; &gt; You
        will know when you get to the point of mastering it, when you can &gt; just
        glance at the cube after OLL and just "know" the case you are
        &gt; dealing with. &gt; &gt; Dan :) &gt; &gt; --- In

    Yeah, you're right, Kenneth, I guess my timer doesn't have
        eyes to control. At least not yet! ;) So ok, I was wrong. Plus, I
        don't have the same practice like all of you, I still don't
        know what happens in a real competition. But I hope to know it soon.

    True. The fact is that I like the nice report a good timer gives you
        automatically after an average. Anyway, I wasn't used to behave
        like you do after pops. I stopped the solve when the pieces were too
        far. Little behaviours to correct. :) Emanuele --- In

    Hi Aaron, In my humble opinion (and my personal experience), the easiest
        method for blindfold solving is Stefan Pochmann's method. You can
        find it here: http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/ I do
        think this method requires some understanding of cycles, commutators,
        maybe a little group theory (parity issues, transpositions etc.). I have
        written a tutorial about commutators.. I think it might help.. (sorry
        for advertising for my own site :))
        http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jnoort/index.php?location=commutators If
        you have any questions about the method, you can mail me: jnoort[at]

        version 1.0. Features: Average (takes the average over 12 solves, minus
        best and worst) Scramble (continuously generates and displays scrambles
        until you tell it to stop) Alg Avg (a detached averager so you
        don't have to wait for useless scrambles) All of the scrambles
        follow WCA regulations (I think). Unfortunately, the calculators
        can't handle anything more accurate than seconds, so it'll
        have to be used in conjunction with a StackMat or wristwatch. Also, as
        far as I know, this program will only run on the TI-83/84 series of
        calculators -- I'll work on porting later. The program can be
        downloaded here: http://www.kc8onw.net/~thewonderidiot/calccube.8xp (do
        a File-&gt;Save As) It also requires the OmniCalc app, for the modulus
        function. I'll work on a heavier version later that doesn't
        require it (it'll run slower, though). OmniCalc can be downloaded
        here: http://www.detachedsolutions.com/omnicalc/ Any tips for
        improvement would be greatly appreciated. (By the way guys, this is
        fully open source. Programmers, have fun with it.) -Mike Stewart

        New Scrambler for TI-83/84 Series Over the past several months,
        I've been working on a program to act kind of like JNetCube on my

    I made something similar to this for my TI-89 Titanium, over the last
        several months. Mine can provide basic scrambling algs (I never
        bothered, however, to avoid stuff like RLR'), can do an average of
        any number of solves (minus best and worst), time any amount of
        inspection time, and can time solves for you (accurate to nearest
        second), or can input times for use with a stackmat or other timer. I am
        currently working on getting the Standard Deviation to work properly.
        The program will not run on a TI-89, because those apparently do not
        have a time function. If someone with a TI-89 wants a copy, I can take
        the time function out, but then the program will be not be able to time
        you by itself. If someone with a TI-89 titanium wants a copy, speak up,
        and I will post one online somewhere. -Alexei

    I haven't seen any specific rules for it, so I'm asking how it

    For averages of 100, I include all solves, including the lucky ones. You
        can't get a much better average by having lucky cases. POPs, I just
        ignore them. The reason is: a POP can easily cost you 10 seconds, and
        that means a 0.1 seconds difference in the average. The influence a POP
        has in the average is just too big. - Joël. --- In

    Why do you think sub-10 is so hard? ~45 moves and 4 moves per second
        seems really reasonable. Then just some easy/lucky cases and that's

        This would be great if it was possible. Maybe it would be a problem

    Hi :-) If someone come up with a novel solution/method noone has any
        obligation to look into it;-) If the inventor feels it's good
        that's the person who should invest time/effort to explore all
        it's possibilities. And if it's good then surely someone will
        start following. I don't complain because almost noone has shown

    well i have to discuss something thats been bothering me and i know they
        are working on good ideas, but i had to bring it up here, in the hope as
        a group we can think of some good ideas to resolve the issue. i think at
        the past couple cali tournaments that bld has gotten totally out of
        control in the amount of time it takes up, to the point where other
        events and other rounds are being eliminated or less people are allowed
        to advance because of the time constraints that bld is imposing. i
        believe everyone should should have a chance, but i also believe 30
        minutes worth of dnfs is a waste of time. competitions aren't the
        place to practice these skills in my opinion, if you aren't usually
        successful or take large amounts of time, i think that one should work
        at home until they can post decent and consistent times. maybe an
        elimination final, where if the first solve(s) aren't under a
        certain time then you don't advance, giving everyone a chance to
        post a time, but without sacrificing other people's chances to
        compete. possibly 2 dnfs= elimination? only pre registered competitiors
        can participate in bld? maybe a dedicated 2 mat table off to the side
        for bld competitors, which would run from right away in the morning
        until the first round is done to ensure the main stage will only be
        needed for the time its scheduled and doesn't go 45 minutes over.
        i'm not sure maybe there are some better ideas out there. this
        weekend only 16/55 were taken to the final, where usually its 24, and
        the reason was because time was running short after the 2 hr bld event,
        i like second round, but i like even more the 2 chances to better my
        comp average, i know sometimes you win sometimes you loose, but i posted
        my best competition average ever and didn't make it to the semis,
        which i have only missed out on twice in the 10 or so comps i've
        gone to. and i am also tired of the 5x5 event always being the first
        thing to go. its unfair to cancel because the scramblings take a while,
        or the event takes some time; these things shouldn't be enough to
        stop it from happening, i work hard at it, and it really sucks i hardly
        ever get a chance to compete with 5x5. It seriously can't take even
        1/2 as much time as the bld event, especially considering at the largest
        tournaments, there aren't more that 5-10 people insterested, so it
        should be totally feasible to have a 45-60 min 5x5 round, even less if
        we use the graduated final system, where if the first solve or two
        isn't under a certain time, then you stop. this is my boo hoo about
        some stuff maybe some people have some good ideas to resolve some of
        these problems. i want everyone to have a chance to do what they want,
        without hindering anyone else's chance to do what they want.

    yes, it would be a problem, for said reason. i guess you could always
        spend the money to manufacture a cube that blends colors together... or
        just melt together separate pieces of plastic to form the colors.

    Hi Clancy, Our hobby is growing and more people are competing in more
        events. That is good news! But this also means that time schedules are
        getting tighter. If we keep on growing like this, then we may need
        qualification times per event. In Europe we introduced combined rounds,
        where everyone who wants to compete has at least one attempt, and after
        that people beating a specific time have one or more extra attempts.
        This way we can do many puzzles, each in 1 round, with everyone having
        his chance to compete. On the other side we also have strict time
        limits. For blindfolded we often have a time limit of 20 minutes for 2
        cubes. And the slower competitors can use a Stackmat or stopwatch
        somewhere in a corner, so that we can use up to 10 timers. This way we
        can handle the blindfolded competition in one hour. Anyway, I think we
        should not criticize competitors who are slower. Everyone should have
        his chance. Using time limits and a limited number of attempts, we can
        still have many events on one day. But it takes some smart planning and
        smart event formats. A competition organizer will try to have the most
        popular events. The popularity of events is different in different
        countries. Of course you can always organize a competition yourself! You
        could even organize a two day competition. :-) Have fun, Ron -----

        couple cali tournaments that bld has gotten totally out of control in
        the amount of time it takes up, to the point where other events and
        other rounds are being eliminated or less people are allowed to advance
        because of the time constraints that bld is imposing. i believe everyone
        should should have a chance, but i also believe 30 minutes worth of dnfs
        is a waste of time. competitions aren't the place to practice these
        skills in my opinion, if you aren't usually successful or take
        large amounts of time, i think that one should work at home until they
        can post decent and consistent times. maybe an elimination final, where
        if the first solve(s) aren't under a certain time then you
        don't advance, giving everyone a chance to post a time, but without
        sacrificing other people's chances to compete. possibly 2 dnfs=
        elimination? only pre registered competitiors can participate in bld?
        maybe a dedicated 2 mat table off to the side for bld competitors, which
        would run from right away in the morning until the first round is done
        to ensure the main stage will only be needed for the time its scheduled
        and doesn't go 45 minutes over. i'm not sure maybe there are
        some better ideas out there. this weekend only 16/55 were taken to the
        final, where usually its 24, and the reason was because time was running
        short after the 2 hr bld event, i like second round, but i like even
        more the 2 chances to better my comp average, i know sometimes you win
        sometimes you loose, but i posted my best competition average ever and
        didn't make it to the semis, which i have only missed out on twice
        in the 10 or so comps i've gone to. and i am also tired of the 5x5
        event always being the first thing to go. its unfair to cancel because
        the scramblings take a while, or the event takes some time; these things
        shouldn't be enough to stop it from happening, i work hard at it,
        and it really sucks i hardly ever get a chance to compete with 5x5. It
        seriously can't take even 1/2 as much time as the bld event,
        especially considering at the largest tournaments, there aren't
        more that 5-10 people insterested, so it should be totally feasible to
        have a 45-60 min 5x5 round, even less if we use the graduated final
        system, where if the first solve or two isn't under a certain time,
        then you stop. this is my boo hoo about some stuff maybe some people
        have some good ideas to resolve some of these problems. i want everyone
        to have a chance to do what they want, without hindering anyone
        else's chance to do what they want.

    I must agree with you on at least point, "...If someone come up
        with a novel solution/method noone has any obligation to look into it
        ;-)" Of course no one is obligated! If somehow I implied that,
        please, show me where :) There are of course, many ideas that hit the
        group. I didn't suggest that everyone should help develop those
        ideas. Sometimes it is better though, when considering a new method, to
        reflect on the ideas and concerns of a third party. To explain further,
        suppose I come up with a new system for the 5x5. I may have mapped out
        the method and several of it's variants, but it is difficult to map
        out its pros and cons for one of two reasons: (a): A limit of expertise.
        (b): My view would be inherently bias because it is _my_ idea. It is
        similar to occasions when I have discussed FMC ideas with you, Per; I
        explored a new method idea, but still asked you about it. Why? - Because
        method development is easier when an expert in the area can point out
        otherwise unobvious things. Then I see someone post an idea, looking not
        for someone to do all the work, but just for thoughts on the method. How
        should these people interpret the lack of response? And then on the flip
        side, we've had insanely long threads regarding that three door
        scenario. Have the pros and cons of the cage method not been explored
        publicly? It's lack of development doesn't mean it hasn't
        been addressed well enough. As for Gilles method, nothing is more
        inspiring to me in terms of method development. He did a fantastic job
        of exploring a method idea, with little assistance. Perhaps he had the
        expertise needed to develop that method and see the strengths and
        weaknesses of it. Not everyone is so good :) And how much sooner might
        the method have been brought to the cubing world if the community had
        jumped in with their ideas? "Now it's proven to be good and
        people are beginning to show an interest in it :-)" Methods
        shouldn't have to be proven for their worth by the developer! Not
        everyone is capable of extremely fast times. That is (to me) the same as
        saying, "You will not prove your method until you are extremely
        fast." That's my perception of it however; I don't intend
        to put words in your mouth. -RP --- In

    Hi Clancy, Our hobby is growing and more people are competing in more
        events. That is good news! But this also means that time schedules are
        getting tighter. ---i agree its good news, but i think a lot of ideas
        and structure plans of comps have to be re-thought because of this
        ========================================================== If we keep on
        growing like this, then we may need qualification times per event. In
        Europe we introduced combined rounds, where everyone who wants to
        compete has at least one attempt, and after that people beating a
        specific time have one or more extra attempts. This way we can do many
        puzzles, each in 1 round, with everyone having his chance to compete. On
        the other side we also have strict time limits. For blindfolded we often
        have a time limit of 20 minutes for 2 cubes. And the slower competitors
        can use a Stackmat or stopwatch somewhere in a corner, so that we can
        use up to 10 timers. This way we can handle the blindfolded competition
        in one hour. ---these are both options i said would be feasible i was
        kind of looking for alternate options or an genereal consensus to what,
        if anything, should be done
        ===================================================================
        Anyway, I think we should not criticize competitors who are slower.
        Everyone should have his chance. Using time limits and a limited number
        of attempts, we can still have many events on one day. But it takes some
        smart planning and smart event formats. --- i never critisized anyone
        for being slow, i'm just saying that things probably need to be
        restructured for everyone to get the most out of these competitions
        ============================================================= A
        competition organizer will try to have the most popular events. The
        popularity of events is different in different countries. ---i can
        appreciate this, but at the same time, why should one group of people
        have 3 chances to do thier event, while another group doesn't get
        any ============================================================== Of
        course you can always organize a competition yourself! You could even
        organize a two day competition. :-) --yes i could, but this issue would
        probably be prevelent there too, which is why i asked what people think
        is best. if no one else cares, that's ok, but i don't see why
        we shouldn't strive to make sure everyone gets the most they can
        out of these competitions

    I haven't competed yet, but this is something I have always thought
        about--the time constraints. However, how hard is it to setup more
        tables to allow more events to take place so that people can compete in
        all the categories they want? BLD does take time, but a separate table
        for that while others work on other competitions sounds like it would

        However, how hard is it to setup more tables to allow more events to
        take place so that people can compete in all the categories they want?
        BLD does take time, but a separate table for that while others work on
        other competitions sounds like it would resolve the issue. &gt; &gt; &gt; -----

        well i have to discuss something thats been bothering me and i know they
        are working on good ideas, but i had to bring it up here, in the hope as
        a group we can think of some good ideas to resolve the issue. i think at
        the past couple cali tournaments that bld has gotten totally out of
        control in the amount of time it takes up, to the point where other
        events and other rounds are being eliminated or less people are allowed
        to advance because of the time constraints that bld is imposing. i
        believe everyone should should have a chance, but i also believe 30
        minutes worth of dnfs is a waste of time. competitions aren't the
        place to practice these skills in my opinion, if you aren't usually
        successful or take large amounts of time, i think that one should work
        at home until they can post decent and consistent times. maybe an
        elimination final, where if the first solve(s) aren't under a
        certain time then you don't advance, giving everyone a chance to
        post a time, but without &gt; sacrificing other people's chances to
        compete. possibly 2 dnfs= elimination? only pre registered competitiors
        can participate in bld? maybe a dedicated 2 mat table off to the side
        for bld competitors, which would run from right away in the morning
        until the first round is done to ensure the main stage will only be
        needed for the time its scheduled and doesn't go 45 minutes over.
        i'm not sure maybe there are some better ideas out there. &gt; &gt; this
        weekend only 16/55 were taken to the final, where usually its 24, and
        the reason was because time was running short after the 2 hr bld event,
        i like second round, but i like even more the 2 chances to better my
        comp average, i know sometimes you win sometimes you loose, but i posted
        my best competition average ever and didn't make it to the semis,
        which i have only missed out on twice in the 10 or so comps i've
        gone to. &gt; &gt; and i am also tired of the 5x5 event always being the first
        thing to go. its unfair to cancel because the scramblings take a while,
        or the event takes some time; these things shouldn't be enough to
        stop it from happening, i work hard at it, and it really sucks i hardly
        ever get a chance to compete with 5x5. It seriously can't take even
        1/2 as much time as the bld event, especially considering at the largest
        tournaments, there aren't more that 5-10 people insterested, so it
        should be totally feasible to have a 45-60 min 5x5 round, even less if
        we use the graduated final system, where if the first solve or two
        isn't under a certain time, then you stop. &gt; &gt; this is my boo hoo
        about some stuff maybe some people have some good ideas to resolve some
        of these problems. i want everyone to have a chance to do what they
        want, without hindering anyone else's chance to do what they want.

    Hello all, I belonged to this group in highschool when I was more
        involved with the cube, and I recently joined again due to some powerful
        new interest. I have determined that the source of my slow times is from
        the F2l and I am not certain how to go about fixing it. I know most of
        the permutations of corner and edge pieces from jessica friedrichs
        method, but I always find myself aligning them to look like the picture
        I learned the alg from. my best F2L is 25 seconds on average, and my
        goal is to solve the entire cube in under 30 seconds every single time.
        obviously that is impossible with such slow F2L times. Any tips on how
        to progress would be great because it seems I have hit a wall. Best

    Hi Stefan, &gt;&gt; Anyway, I think we should not criticize competitors who
        are slower. &gt;&gt; Everyone should have his chance. &gt;So you're against
        time limits? &gt;&gt; Using time limits and a limited number of attempts, we
        can still &gt;&gt; have many events on one day. &gt;So you're in favor of
        time limits? :-) I am not against time limits. There are two: 1) time
        limits BEFORE the competition 2) time limits DURING the competition We
        have to be mild with 1), everyone should have his chance. We have to be
        stricter with 2), otherwise we cannot stick to the time schedule and
        have many different events. If your first solve is not inside 2), then
        you cannot have more attempts. You can also do this by having combined
        finals. Have fun, Ron

    I see 3 ways to solve this problem ... at least Smart scheduling,
        combined finals and skilled officials/judges. And the obvious: having
        more timers. Every participant having a timer should bring it and let
        organisers know about it. Another more conctroversial way to deal with
        this is to have separate competetitions for bld-,oh- and feetsolving.
        How else are we gonna fit even larger olympicubes into a competition?
        With all respect id rather see 7x7x7 solving in a tournament than 3
        rounds of magic and mastermagic. Also the clock is not a major event in
        my eyes even i do that sometimes (for fun, never practice it). I guess
        it's simply IMPOSSIBLE to go for 3-day competitions because many
        travel far to competitions and can only stay a weekend, that's it.
        Exceptions could be made for EC, WC and other really major competitions
        (US nationals too). Organisers can have a look at how previous
        competitions like wc 2005 and ec2006 thet were successfully organised
        with lots of events and copy the competition formats/scheduling. Happy
        cubing all :-) -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        the end. /Gunnar --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        can't understand that I'm as &gt; &gt; fast myself, because it looks

        solving myself, but I guess it's different when you &gt; &gt; are the one
        who knows what's being done. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My next goalis t get a sub-26

    One thing that has helped me a lot is to stop thinking of forming edge
        pairs using "algorithms", and instead, just spending time
        intuitively thinking about how to make pairs from different positions in
        as few moves as possible.... After a while you will just see what you
        have to do instead of thinking "which algorithm is this....?"
        Also, when you start forming an edge pair with whatever sequence of
        moves you need to do, dont think about doing the sequence, leave that to
        muscle memory to perform... Instead, take the permutation slow, and
        start looking for an edge or corner that you need to connect, that that
        way you already have half of the next pair located before you've
        even finished placing the first edge pair... That should be good for a
        few weeks of practice, so good luck!

    Fixing the judging problem is easy. You can make it like this: to be

        to resolve the issue. i think at the past couple cali tournaments that
        bld has gotten totally out of control in the amount of time it takes up,

        also believe 30 minutes worth of dnfs is a waste of time. competitions
        aren't the place to practice these skills in my opinion, if you
        aren't usually successful or take large amounts of time, i think
        that one should work at home until they can post decent and consistent
        times. maybe an elimination final, where if the first solve(s)
        aren't under a certain time then you don't advance, giving
        everyone a chance to post a time, but without &gt; sacrificing other
        people's chances to compete. possibly 2 dnfs= elimination? only pre
        registered competitiors can participate in bld? maybe a dedicated 2 mat
        table off to the side for bld competitors, which would run from right
        away in the morning until the first round is done to ensure the main
        stage will only be needed for the time its scheduled and doesn't go
        45 minutes over. i'm not sure maybe there are some better ideas out
        there. &gt; &gt; this weekend only 16/55 were taken to the final, where
        usually its 24, and the reason was because time was running short after
        the 2 hr bld event, i like second round, but i like even more the 2
        chances to better my comp average, i know sometimes you win sometimes
        you loose, but i posted my best competition average ever and didn't
        make it to the semis, which i have only missed out on twice in the 10 or
        so comps i've gone to. &gt; &gt; and i am also tired of the 5x5 event
        always being the first thing to go. its unfair to cancel because the
        scramblings take a while, or the event takes some time; these things
        shouldn't be enough to stop it from happening, i work hard at it,
        and it really sucks i hardly ever get a chance to compete with 5x5. It
        seriously can't take even 1/2 as much time as the bld event,
        especially considering at the largest tournaments, there aren't
        more that 5-10 people insterested, so it should be totally feasible to
        have a 45-60 min 5x5 round, even less if we use the graduated final

   <div class="email-content">
    Hey, all. I apologize in advance that this post will be long, but I just
        found this Yahoo Group and I have issues that I've wanted to ask
        about for a long time. Anyways, I've played around on and off with
        the Fridrich method of solving the cube for a long time now. I first
        attempted learning it probably around 7-8 years ago, and was able to
        memorize most of the move sequences for the F2L. I got to the point
        where I averaged around 25-30 seconds for just the cross + F2L, and then
        hit a wall. I couldn't get any faster than that. Due to frustration
        my interest in the cube slowly faded, and every few months/years I would
        pick it up for a while, try to improve/keep up with what I had learned,
        not get anywhere, and stop playing with the cube again. I've read
        all the strategies/tips I can find, lubricated the cube, learned a lot
        of the finger tricks, but I'm still unable to break that 25-30
        second mark for the cross + F2L. My own analysis of my problems leads me
        to these issues that I really would appreciate feedback on: 1. Solving
        the cross: It takes me a really long time to do the cross. When I try to
        plan out the moves beforehand, the series of moves I choose require
        reorienting the cube several times, since it seems to require rotating
        all 6 sides, which I can't do while leaving the cube in the same
        orientation the whole time. Since each series of 8 or so moves is
        different each time, I can't seem position the cube correctly to
        perform the moves quickly. Generally I leave it cross- side up. Would it
        be better if I learned how to do it with the cross either on the side or
        the bottom? What are some strategies on what I can do to eliminate the
        need to keep turning the cube in order to rotate the desired faces? 2.
        Finding the corner-edge combination: I have trouble locating the
        corner-edge combinations. Do people have a system where they look for
        the corner first, then find the matching edge, or vice-versa? Also, if
        for example you find the corner first, there are 8 possible places the
        matching edge could be. Is there a system for quickly noticing where
        that piece is? 3. Positioning the pieces/cube in order to begin the F2L
        sequences: I can do a lot of the move sequences pretty fast. However, in
        order to begin the move sequence, the pieces need to be set up in the
        correct way, and the cube needs to be oriented so that the correct face
        is facing me. That takes me a long time. When I am finished with one
        move sequence, even *if* I have the next set located already, it takes
        me a lot of time to rotate the bottom layer such that the corner piece
        is in the right place in relation to the target location, then reorient
        the cube so that my hands are in the right place to begin the move
        sequence. I've heard all the tips about trying to minimize the
        number of times you need to turn the whole cube, but I can't seem
        to understand how to do that when the pieces I'm trying to move
        to/from are on the back of the cube. Do you just have to learn a
        different move sequence for each orientation? How do you do that?
        Finally, it seems like it's a matter of preference, but generally,
        do people do the F2L with the cross on the side or on the bottom? I do
        it on the side (the right side since I'm left-handed), but I want
        to try out having the cross on the bottom too. Any tips for one or the
        other? Thanks in advance, I really want to figure out what I've
        been doing wrong all these years.

        group] boo hoo &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well i have to discuss something thats been
        bothering me and i &gt; know they are working on good ideas, but i had to
        bring it up here, in &gt; the hope as a group we can think of some good
        ideas to resolve the &gt; issue. i think at the past couple cali
        tournaments that bld has gotten &gt; totally out of control in the amount
        of time it takes up, to the point &gt; where other events and other rounds
        are being eliminated or less &gt; people are allowed to advance because of
        the time constraints that bld &gt; is imposing. i believe everyone should
        should have a chance, but i &gt; also believe 30 minutes worth of dnfs is a
        waste of time. competitions &gt; aren't the place to practice these
        skills in my opinion, if you aren't &gt; usually successful or take
        large amounts of time, i think that one &gt; should work at home until they
        can post decent and consistent times. &gt; maybe an elimination final,
        where if the first solve(s) aren't under a &gt; certain time then you
        don't advance, giving everyone a chance to post &gt; a time, but
        without &gt; &gt; sacrificing other people's chances to compete. possibly
        2 dnfs= &gt; elimination? only pre registered competitiors can participate
        in bld? &gt; maybe a dedicated 2 mat table off to the side for bld
        competitors, &gt; which would run from right away in the morning until the
        first round &gt; is done to ensure the main stage will only be needed for
        the time its &gt; scheduled and doesn't go 45 minutes over. i'm
        not sure maybe there are &gt; some better ideas out there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this
        weekend only 16/55 were taken to the final, where usually its &gt; 24, and
        the reason was because time was running short after the 2 hr &gt; bld
        event, i like second round, but i like even more the 2 chances to &gt;
        better my comp average, i know sometimes you win sometimes you loose, &gt;
        but i posted my best competition average ever and didn't make it to
        &gt; the semis, which i have only missed out on twice in the 10 or so comps
        &gt; i've gone to. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and i am also tired of the 5x5 event always
        being the first thing &gt; to go. its unfair to cancel because the
        scramblings take a while, or &gt; the event takes some time; these things
        shouldn't be enough to stop it &gt; from happening, i work hard at it,
        and it really sucks i hardly ever &gt; get a chance to compete with 5x5. It
        seriously can't take even 1/2 as &gt; much time as the bld event,
        especially considering at the largest &gt; tournaments, there aren't
        more that 5-10 people insterested, so it &gt; should be totally feasible to
        have a 45-60 min 5x5 round, even less if &gt; we use the graduated final
        system, where if the first solve or two &gt; isn't under a certain
        time, then you stop. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is my boo hoo about some stuff maybe
        some people have some &gt; good ideas to resolve some of these problems. i
        want everyone to have &gt; a chance to do what they want, without hindering
        anyone else's chance &gt; to do what they want. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Subject: [Speed cubing group] boo hoo &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well i
        have to discuss something thats been bothering me and i &gt; &gt; &gt; know they
        are working on good ideas, but i had to bring it up &gt; &gt; here, in &gt; &gt; &gt;
        the hope as a group we can think of some good ideas to resolve &gt; &gt; the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; issue. i think at the past couple cali tournaments that bld has &gt; &gt;
        gotten &gt; &gt; &gt; totally out of control in the amount of time it takes up,
        to the &gt; &gt; point &gt; &gt; &gt; where other events and other rounds are being
        eliminated or less &gt; &gt; &gt; people are allowed to advance because of the
        time constraints &gt; &gt; that bld &gt; &gt; &gt; is imposing. i believe everyone
        should should have a chance, but &gt; &gt; i &gt; &gt; &gt; also believe 30 minutes
        worth of dnfs is a waste of time. &gt; &gt; competitions &gt; &gt; &gt; aren't the
        place to practice these skills in my opinion, if you &gt; &gt; aren't &gt; &gt;
        &gt; usually successful or take large amounts of time, i think that &gt; &gt; one
        &gt; &gt; &gt; should work at home until they can post decent and consistent &gt; &gt;
        times. &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe an elimination final, where if the first solve(s)
        aren't &gt; &gt; under a &gt; &gt; &gt; certain time then you don't advance,
        giving everyone a chance to &gt; &gt; post &gt; &gt; &gt; a time, but without &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        sacrificing other people's chances to compete. possibly 2 dnfs= &gt; &gt;
        &gt; elimination? only pre registered competitiors can participate in &gt; &gt;
        bld? &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe a dedicated 2 mat table off to the side for bld &gt; &gt;
        competitors, &gt; &gt; &gt; which would run from right away in the morning until
        the first &gt; &gt; round &gt; &gt; &gt; is done to ensure the main stage will only be
        needed for the &gt; &gt; time its &gt; &gt; &gt; scheduled and doesn't go 45
        minutes over. i'm not sure maybe &gt; &gt; there are &gt; &gt; &gt; some better
        ideas out there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this weekend only 16/55 were taken to
        the final, where usually &gt; &gt; its &gt; &gt; &gt; 24, and the reason was because
        time was running short after the &gt; &gt; 2 hr &gt; &gt; &gt; bld event, i like second
        round, but i like even more the 2 &gt; &gt; chances to &gt; &gt; &gt; better my comp
        average, i know sometimes you win sometimes you &gt; &gt; loose, &gt; &gt; &gt; but i
        posted my best competition average ever and didn't make it &gt; &gt; to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; the semis, which i have only missed out on twice in the 10 or so &gt; &gt;
        comps &gt; &gt; &gt; i've gone to. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and i am also tired of
        the 5x5 event always being the first &gt; &gt; thing &gt; &gt; &gt; to go. its unfair
        to cancel because the scramblings take a &gt; &gt; while, or &gt; &gt; &gt; the event
        takes some time; these things shouldn't be enough to &gt; &gt; stop it &gt;
        &gt; &gt; from happening, i work hard at it, and it really sucks i hardly &gt; &gt;
        ever &gt; &gt; &gt; get a chance to compete with 5x5. It seriously can't
        take even &gt; &gt; 1/2 as &gt; &gt; &gt; much time as the bld event, especially
        considering at the largest &gt; &gt; &gt; tournaments, there aren't more
        that 5-10 people insterested, so &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; should be totally feasible
        to have a 45-60 min 5x5 round, even &gt; &gt; less if &gt; &gt; &gt; we use the
        graduated final system, where if the first solve or &gt; &gt; two &gt; &gt; &gt;
        isn't under a certain time, then you stop. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is
        my boo hoo about some stuff maybe some people have some &gt; &gt; &gt; good ideas
        to resolve some of these problems. i want everyone to &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; a
        chance to do what they want, without hindering anyone else's &gt; &gt;
        chance &gt; &gt; &gt; to do what they want. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Bottom cross, from start, always. It's not easy first but by time

        Need lots of help Hey, all. I apologize in advance that this post will
        be long, but I just found this Yahoo Group and I have issues that
        I've wanted to ask about for a long time. Anyways, I've played
        around on and off with the Fridrich method of solving the cube for a
        long time now. I first attempted learning it probably around 7-8 years
        ago, and was able to memorize most of the move sequences for the F2L. I
        got to the point where I averaged around 25-30 seconds for just the
        cross + F2L, and then hit a wall. I couldn't get any faster than
        that. Due to frustration my interest in the cube slowly faded, and every
        few months/years I would pick it up for a while, try to improve/keep up
        with what I had learned, not get anywhere, and stop playing with the
        cube again. I've read all the strategies/tips I can find,
        lubricated the cube, learned a lot of the finger tricks, but I'm
        still unable to break that 25-30 second mark for the cross + F2L. My own
        analysis of my problems leads me to these issues that I really would
        appreciate feedback on: 1. Solving the cross: It takes me a really long
        time to do the cross. When I try to plan out the moves beforehand, the
        series of moves I choose require reorienting the cube several times,
        since it seems to require rotating all 6 sides, which I can't do
        while leaving the cube in the same orientation the whole time. Since
        each series of 8 or so moves is different each time, I can't seem
        position the cube correctly to perform the moves quickly. Generally I
        leave it cross- side up. Would it be better if I learned how to do it
        with the cross either on the side or the bottom? What are some
        strategies on what I can do to eliminate the need to keep turning the
        cube in order to rotate the desired faces? 2. Finding the corner-edge
        combination: I have trouble locating the corner-edge combinations. Do
        people have a system where they look for the corner first, then find the
        matching edge, or vice-versa? Also, if for example you find the corner
        first, there are 8 possible places the matching edge could be. Is there
        a system for quickly noticing where that piece is? 3. Positioning the
        pieces/cube in order to begin the F2L sequences: I can do a lot of the
        move sequences pretty fast. However, in order to begin the move
        sequence, the pieces need to be set up in the correct way, and the cube
        needs to be oriented so that the correct face is facing me. That takes
        me a long time. When I am finished with one move sequence, even *if* I
        have the next set located already, it takes me a lot of time to rotate
        the bottom layer such that the corner piece is in the right place in
        relation to the target location, then reorient the cube so that my hands
        are in the right place to begin the move sequence. I've heard all
        the tips about trying to minimize the number of times you need to turn
        the whole cube, but I can't seem to understand how to do that when
        the pieces I'm trying to move to/from are on the back of the cube.
        Do you just have to learn a different move sequence for each
        orientation? How do you do that? Finally, it seems like it's a
        matter of preference, but generally, do people do the F2L with the cross
        on the side or on the bottom? I do it on the side (the right side since
        I'm left-handed), but I want to try out having the cross on the
        bottom too. Any tips for one or the other? Thanks in advance, I really
        want to figure out what I've been doing wrong all these years.

    When I save CalCube and omnicalc to my computer then right click and

        downloaded TI Connect and it says something like "calcube.8xp
        isn't a valid win32 application". I used to have a timer on my
        calculator. It was able to do more than just seconds (2 digits more).
        The seconds were longer than normal though. All I want this for is the
        scrambles. I need a way to get scrambles without being on the computer.
        It's annoying scrambling myself since I do the same kind of turns
        every time. I'm using a TI-83 Plus Silver Edition BTW. --- In

    hello, &gt;From reading what you posted, I can side with you on many of the
        same things. I just began to solve the cross on the bottom, and I am
        seeing improvement of a few seconds, but for the most part I have hit a
        wall in my F2L as well, and I cannot solve it faster than 25- 30
        seconds. this is the major problem with my entire solve. It is very
        difficult to try and break the wall, so if you come across anything that
        works for you, please let me know. casen --- In

        post will be long, but I &gt; just found this Yahoo Group and I have issues
        that I've wanted to ask &gt; about for a long time. Anyways, I've
        played around on and off with &gt; the Fridrich method of solving the cube
        for a long time now. I first &gt; attempted learning it probably around 7-8
        years ago, and was able to &gt; memorize most of the move sequences for the
        F2L. I got to the point &gt; where I averaged around 25-30 seconds for just
        the cross + F2L, and &gt; then hit a wall. I couldn't get any faster
        than that. Due to &gt; frustration my interest in the cube slowly faded,
        and every few &gt; months/years I would pick it up for a while, try to
        improve/keep up &gt; with what I had learned, not get anywhere, and stop
        playing with the &gt; cube again. &gt; &gt; I've read all the
        strategies/tips I can find, lubricated the cube, &gt; learned a lot of the
        finger tricks, but I'm still unable to break &gt; that 25-30 second
        mark for the cross + F2L. &gt; &gt; My own analysis of my problems leads me to
        these issues that I really &gt; would appreciate feedback on: &gt; &gt; 1.
        Solving the cross: It takes me a really long time to do the cross. &gt;
        When I try to plan out the moves beforehand, the series of moves I &gt;
        choose require reorienting the cube several times, since it seems to &gt;
        require rotating all 6 sides, which I can't do while leaving the
        cube &gt; in the same orientation the whole time. Since each series of 8 or
        so &gt; moves is different each time, I can't seem position the cube &gt;
        correctly to perform the moves quickly. Generally I leave it cross- &gt;
        side up. Would it be better if I learned how to do it with the cross &gt;
        either on the side or the bottom? What are some strategies on what I &gt;
        can do to eliminate the need to keep turning the cube in order to &gt;
        rotate the desired faces? &gt; &gt; 2. Finding the corner-edge combination: I
        have trouble locating the &gt; corner-edge combinations. Do people have a
        system where they look for &gt; the corner first, then find the matching
        edge, or vice-versa? Also, &gt; if for example you find the corner first,
        there are 8 possible places &gt; the matching edge could be. Is there a
        system for quickly noticing &gt; where that piece is? &gt; &gt; 3. Positioning
        the pieces/cube in order to begin the F2L sequences: I &gt; can do a lot of
        the move sequences pretty fast. However, in order to &gt; begin the move
        sequence, the pieces need to be set up in the correct &gt; way, and the
        cube needs to be oriented so that the correct face is &gt; facing me. That
        takes me a long time. When I am finished with one &gt; move sequence, even
        *if* I have the next set located already, it &gt; takes me a lot of time to
        rotate the bottom layer such that the &gt; corner piece is in the right
        place in relation to the target &gt; location, then reorient the cube so
        that my hands are in the right &gt; place to begin the move sequence. &gt; &gt;
        I've heard all the tips about trying to minimize the number of
        times &gt; you need to turn the whole cube, but I can't seem to
        understand how &gt; to do that when the pieces I'm trying to move
        to/from are on the back &gt; of the cube. Do you just have to learn a
        different move sequence for &gt; each orientation? How do you do that? &gt; &gt;
        Finally, it seems like it's a matter of preference, but generally,
        do &gt; people do the F2L with the cross on the side or on the bottom? I do
        &gt; it on the side (the right side since I'm left-handed), but I want
        to &gt; try out having the cross on the bottom too. Any tips for one or the
        &gt; other? &gt; &gt; Thanks in advance, I really want to figure out what
        I've been doing &gt; wrong all these years. &gt;

    Hi, My current thinking is that if you are very two-handed (Ron van
        Bruchem, myself, Chris Hardwick, etc) then it would be better for you to
        practice cross-on-bottom. If you are very right-handed (Lars
        Vandenbergh, etc) then it may be better for you to practice
        cross-on-left, allowing for mostly right-handed moves. If you are very
        left-handed, maybe cross on right would work for you?! But it is my
        experience that most naturally left handed people are gifted with
        ambidextrousness (I did check that and that is correct ;) ). But I
        don't think there are any real speed advantages to be gained with
        either method, so simply pick which one suits your style the best. DanH

        It's not easy first but by time this &gt; approach is the fastes. &gt; &gt;
        If the U layer is correct but not the cube rotation, then learn to hold
        &gt; the top layer and rotate d, it's much faster than U + cube
        orientation. &gt; &gt; Most really fast cubers (and others, like me =) do not
        orient the cube &gt; if the pair is on the backside of the cube, they just
        do the algs as &gt; from the backside in those cases. If the pair is on
        either R or L side, &gt; then it's usaly rather easy to turn the cube
        and do the first move in &gt; one go. &gt; &gt; Practice helps of course. &gt; &gt; //

    Hi :-) There is no singular answer to this! One could have cross top on
        top during f2l and then cross at bottom during PLL/OLL. Cross top while
        setting it up and cross left while completing f2l (c/e pairs) and then
        finally the cross at bottom while doing PLL/OLL is yet another option.
        The key is to have a good overview of the cube and being able to find
        the cubies or color patterns or whatever one is looking for. One can
        "wiggle" the cube during a sequence (alg) in order to see
        better. The cube does not have to lie *static* in prescribed position. I
        hope this makes sense to everyone;-) Transition from cross top to cross
        left is easier than a straight transition from cross top to cross
        bottom. Most sites (in fact all i know) will show algs for PLL/OLL with
        the cross at bottom (or actually more correctly with the unsolved layer
        on top). So learning those algs with cross bottom and then move the
        cross again is not easy. So basically, the *best* reason for having
        cross at bottom is to be prepared for reading sites that give OLL/PLL
        algs with cross at bottom :D There is no *proven* facts that say that
        the cross this or that way is faster than any other way. It has just
        become consensus to give LL algs with unsolved layer top. Back in
        80's the final unsolved last layer was almost always assumed to be
        at the bottom (B-layer). Things have changed over time :D -Per &gt; --- In

    Hi :-) 1 - Read the manual of ur calculator, about it's programming

        integers below a certain value - u may want integers 1-6 (for the 6
        layers of the cube) (for even better results generate numbers between
        1-600 000 for instance, let 1-100000 &gt; R , 100001-200000 &gt; L etc... ) 3
        - Generate a sequence of random numbers (as many as the desired length
        of scramble sequence) 4 - For each number generate another random number
        to tell how to turn the layer represented by that number ... clockwise,
        2 steps or ccw 5 - Display this on screen with cube notation (1,1)=R
        (1,2)=R2 (1,3)=R' (2,2)=L2 and so on. 6 - Make it advanced with
        axis control Disallow U'DU2 and so on It's not really all too

    You need to be able to perform F2L C/E pairs without watching yourself
        do it. Try finding the C and E you want to pair and place, then look
        away and see if you can put them together and in their proper slot
        without looking. Once you get good at this, instead of looking away when
        pairing the C/E, look for the next set to pair while you're pairing
        and placing the current C/E pair. Then you'll know exactly where
        your next set is when it comes time. You'll probably have to slow
        way down during F2L to see what's going on, but you won't have
        to pause to find the next pieces you need. Practice solving without
        pausing, even if you have to go really slow, it can only get easier and
        faster if you practice. You should practice pairing on the backside
        slots too, it helps alot, even though it's kind of backwards tricky
        at first, it isn't too tough. Good luck! --- In

        post will be long, but I &gt; just found this Yahoo Group and I have issues
        that I've wanted to ask &gt; about for a long time. Anyways, I've
        played around on and off with &gt; the Fridrich method of solving the cube
        for a long time now. I first &gt; attempted learning it probably around 7-8
        years ago, and was able to &gt; memorize most of the move sequences for the
        F2L. I got to the point &gt; where I averaged around 25-30 seconds for just
        the cross + F2L, and &gt; then hit a wall. I couldn't get any faster
        than that. Due to &gt; frustration my interest in the cube slowly faded,
        and every few &gt; months/years I would pick it up for a while, try to
        improve/keep up &gt; with what I had learned, not get anywhere, and stop
        playing with the &gt; cube again. &gt; &gt; I've read all the
        strategies/tips I can find, lubricated the cube, &gt; learned a lot of the
        finger tricks, but I'm still unable to break &gt; that 25-30 second
        mark for the cross + F2L. &gt; &gt; My own analysis of my problems leads me to
        these issues that I really &gt; would appreciate feedback on: &gt; &gt; 1.
        Solving the cross: It takes me a really long time to do the cross. &gt;
        When I try to plan out the moves beforehand, the series of moves I &gt;
        choose require reorienting the cube several times, since it seems to &gt;
        require rotating all 6 sides, which I can't do while leaving the
        cube &gt; in the same orientation the whole time. Since each series of 8 or
        so &gt; moves is different each time, I can't seem position the cube &gt;
        correctly to perform the moves quickly. Generally I leave it cross- &gt;
        side up. Would it be better if I learned how to do it with the cross &gt;
        either on the side or the bottom? What are some strategies on what I &gt;
        can do to eliminate the need to keep turning the cube in order to &gt;
        rotate the desired faces? &gt; &gt; 2. Finding the corner-edge combination: I
        have trouble locating the &gt; corner-edge combinations. Do people have a
        system where they look for &gt; the corner first, then find the matching
        edge, or vice-versa? Also, &gt; if for example you find the corner first,
        there are 8 possible places &gt; the matching edge could be. Is there a
        system for quickly noticing &gt; where that piece is? &gt; &gt; 3. Positioning
        the pieces/cube in order to begin the F2L sequences: I &gt; can do a lot of
        the move sequences pretty fast. However, in order to &gt; begin the move
        sequence, the pieces need to be set up in the correct &gt; way, and the
        cube needs to be oriented so that the correct face is &gt; facing me. That
        takes me a long time. When I am finished with one &gt; move sequence, even
        *if* I have the next set located already, it &gt; takes me a lot of time to
        rotate the bottom layer such that the &gt; corner piece is in the right
        place in relation to the target &gt; location, then reorient the cube so
        that my hands are in the right &gt; place to begin the move sequence. &gt; &gt;
        I've heard all the tips about trying to minimize the number of
        times &gt; you need to turn the whole cube, but I can't seem to
        understand how &gt; to do that when the pieces I'm trying to move
        to/from are on the back &gt; of the cube. Do you just have to learn a
        different move sequence for &gt; each orientation? How do you do that? &gt; &gt;
        Finally, it seems like it's a matter of preference, but generally,
        do &gt; people do the F2L with the cross on the side or on the bottom? I do
        &gt; it on the side (the right side since I'm left-handed), but I want
        to &gt; try out having the cross on the bottom too. Any tips for one or the
        &gt; other? &gt; &gt; Thanks in advance, I really want to figure out what
        I've been doing &gt; wrong all these years. &gt;

    What do you mean by practicing pairing on the backside slots?
        Doesn't placing the C/E pair into the back slots without rotating
        the entire cube mean that you would have to turn the back face
        sometimes? The way I hold the cube, that's pretty difficult. I hold
        the cube with my non-turning hand on the bottom 2x2x3 cubes, which
        leaves my turning hand available to turn the top and side faces freely,
        but makes it difficult to turn the other 4 faces without moving my other
        hand. Is there a different way to hold it so that more faces are
        available for turning? Does this also mean that you guys learn several
        different ways to do the same move sequence for a certain C/E pair,
        depending not only on the location of the corner and edge pieces in
        relation to each other, but also where those pieces are relative to your
        hand position, slot location, etc? --- In

        &gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, all. I apologize in advance that this post will be
        long, but I &gt; &gt; just found this Yahoo Group and I have issues that
        I've wanted to ask &gt; &gt; about for a long time. Anyways, I've
        played around on and off with &gt; &gt; the Fridrich method of solving the
        cube for a long time now. I first &gt; &gt; attempted learning it probably
        around 7-8 years ago, and was able to &gt; &gt; memorize most of the move
        sequences for the F2L. I got to the point &gt; &gt; where I averaged around
        25-30 seconds for just the cross + F2L, and &gt; &gt; then hit a wall. I
        couldn't get any faster than that. Due to &gt; &gt; frustration my
        interest in the cube slowly faded, and every few &gt; &gt; months/years I
        would pick it up for a while, try to improve/keep up &gt; &gt; with what I had
        learned, not get anywhere, and stop playing with the &gt; &gt; cube again. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I've read all the strategies/tips I can find, lubricated the
        cube, &gt; &gt; learned a lot of the finger tricks, but I'm still unable
        to break &gt; &gt; that 25-30 second mark for the cross + F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My own
        analysis of my problems leads me to these issues that I really &gt; &gt; would
        appreciate feedback on: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Solving the cross: It takes me a
        really long time to do the cross. &gt; &gt; When I try to plan out the moves
        beforehand, the series of moves I &gt; &gt; choose require reorienting the
        cube several times, since it seems to &gt; &gt; require rotating all 6 sides,
        which I can't do while leaving the cube &gt; &gt; in the same orientation
        the whole time. Since each series of 8 or so &gt; &gt; moves is different each
        time, I can't seem position the cube &gt; &gt; correctly to perform the
        moves quickly. Generally I leave it cross- &gt; &gt; side up. Would it be
        better if I learned how to do it with the cross &gt; &gt; either on the side
        or the bottom? What are some strategies on what I &gt; &gt; can do to
        eliminate the need to keep turning the cube in order to &gt; &gt; rotate the
        desired faces? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Finding the corner-edge combination: I have
        trouble locating the &gt; &gt; corner-edge combinations. Do people have a
        system where they look for &gt; &gt; the corner first, then find the matching
        edge, or vice-versa? Also, &gt; &gt; if for example you find the corner first,
        there are 8 possible places &gt; &gt; the matching edge could be. Is there a
        system for quickly noticing &gt; &gt; where that piece is? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.
        Positioning the pieces/cube in order to begin the F2L sequences: I &gt; &gt;
        can do a lot of the move sequences pretty fast. However, in order to &gt; &gt;
        begin the move sequence, the pieces need to be set up in the correct &gt; &gt;
        way, and the cube needs to be oriented so that the correct face is &gt; &gt;
        facing me. That takes me a long time. When I am finished with one &gt; &gt;
        move sequence, even *if* I have the next set located already, it &gt; &gt;
        takes me a lot of time to rotate the bottom layer such that the &gt; &gt;
        corner piece is in the right place in relation to the target &gt; &gt;
        location, then reorient the cube so that my hands are in the right &gt; &gt;
        place to begin the move sequence. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've heard all the tips
        about trying to minimize the number of times &gt; &gt; you need to turn the
        whole cube, but I can't seem to understand how &gt; &gt; to do that when
        the pieces I'm trying to move to/from are on the back &gt; &gt; of the
        cube. Do you just have to learn a different move sequence for &gt; &gt; each
        orientation? How do you do that? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, it seems like
        it's a matter of preference, but generally, do &gt; &gt; people do the
        F2L with the cross on the side or on the bottom? I do &gt; &gt; it on the side
        (the right side since I'm left-handed), but I want to &gt; &gt; try out
        having the cross on the bottom too. Any tips for one or the &gt; &gt; other? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks in advance, I really want to figure out what I've been
        doing &gt; &gt; wrong all these years. &gt; &gt; &gt;

    They don't learn different ways of doing it, it's the same
        way, just from a different angle. To do the back slots, just reposition
        your hands a little and you can do B/B' like you do U/U' For
        B' reposition only your left hand so that your 4 fingers on all on

        ago, and was able &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; memorize most of the move sequences for the
        F2L. I got to the &gt; point &gt; &gt; &gt; where I averaged around 25-30 seconds
        for just the cross + F2L, &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; then hit a wall. I couldn't
        get any faster than that. Due to &gt; &gt; &gt; frustration my interest in the
        cube slowly faded, and every few &gt; &gt; &gt; months/years I would pick it up
        for a while, try to improve/keep &gt; up &gt; &gt; &gt; with what I had learned, not
        get anywhere, and stop playing with &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; cube again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I've read all the strategies/tips I can find, lubricated the &gt;
        cube, &gt; &gt; &gt; learned a lot of the finger tricks, but I'm still
        unable to break &gt; &gt; &gt; that 25-30 second mark for the cross + F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; My own analysis of my problems leads me to these issues that I &gt;
        really &gt; &gt; &gt; would appreciate feedback on: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Solving the
        cross: It takes me a really long time to do the &gt; cross. &gt; &gt; &gt; When I
        try to plan out the moves beforehand, the series of moves &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt;
        choose require reorienting the cube several times, since it seems &gt; to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; require rotating all 6 sides, which I can't do while leaving
        the &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; in the same orientation the whole time. Since each
        series of 8 or &gt; so &gt; &gt; &gt; moves is different each time, I can't
        seem position the cube &gt; &gt; &gt; correctly to perform the moves quickly.
        Generally I leave it &gt; cross- &gt; &gt; &gt; side up. Would it be better if I
        learned how to do it with the &gt; cross &gt; &gt; &gt; either on the side or the
        bottom? What are some strategies on &gt; what I &gt; &gt; &gt; can do to eliminate
        the need to keep turning the cube in order to &gt; &gt; &gt; rotate the desired
        faces? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Finding the corner-edge combination: I have
        trouble locating &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; corner-edge combinations. Do people have a
        system where they look &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; the corner first, then find the
        matching edge, or vice-versa? &gt; Also, &gt; &gt; &gt; if for example you find the
        corner first, there are 8 possible &gt; places &gt; &gt; &gt; the matching edge
        could be. Is there a system for quickly &gt; noticing &gt; &gt; &gt; where that
        piece is? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Positioning the pieces/cube in order to begin
        the F2L &gt; sequences: I &gt; &gt; &gt; can do a lot of the move sequences pretty
        fast. However, in order &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; begin the move sequence, the pieces
        need to be set up in the &gt; correct &gt; &gt; &gt; way, and the cube needs to be
        oriented so that the correct face &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; facing me. That takes me a
        long time. When I am finished with one &gt; &gt; &gt; move sequence, even *if* I
        have the next set located already, it &gt; &gt; &gt; takes me a lot of time to
        rotate the bottom layer such that the &gt; &gt; &gt; corner piece is in the right
        place in relation to the target &gt; &gt; &gt; location, then reorient the cube
        so that my hands are in the &gt; right &gt; &gt; &gt; place to begin the move
        sequence. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've heard all the tips about trying to
        minimize the number of &gt; times &gt; &gt; &gt; you need to turn the whole cube,
        but I can't seem to understand &gt; how &gt; &gt; &gt; to do that when the
        pieces I'm trying to move to/from are on the &gt; back &gt; &gt; &gt; of the
        cube. Do you just have to learn a different move sequence &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt;
        each orientation? How do you do that? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, it seems like
        it's a matter of preference, but &gt; generally, do &gt; &gt; &gt; people do
        the F2L with the cross on the side or on the bottom? I &gt; do &gt; &gt; &gt; it on
        the side (the right side since I'm left-handed), but I want &gt; to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; try out having the cross on the bottom too. Any tips for one or &gt;
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; other? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks in advance, I really want to figure
        out what I've been &gt; doing &gt; &gt; &gt; wrong all these years. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    I do feel that I'm fairly ambidextrous. Do you mean that you twist
        the faces with both hands? Do you also do the entire move sequences
        during the F2L with both hands then, depending on the location and
        orientation of the pieces? I find that when I do this, simply the
        process of switching hands slows me down. You have to turn with one
        hand, then grip the cube with that same hand, then release the cube with
        the other hand, then turn with the other hand. How is that faster than
        doing everything with one hand? --- In

        Re: Need lots of help &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottom cross, from start, always.
        It's not easy first but by time this &gt; &gt; approach is the fastes. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; If the U layer is correct but not the cube rotation, then learn to
        hold &gt; &gt; the top layer and rotate d, it's much faster than U + cube
        orientation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most really fast cubers (and others, like me =) do
        not orient the cube &gt; &gt; if the pair is on the backside of the cube, they
        just do the algs as &gt; &gt; from the backside in those cases. If the pair is
        on either R or L side, &gt; &gt; then it's usaly rather easy to turn the
        cube and do the first move in &gt; &gt; one go. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Practice helps of

    It is not always faster to not rotate. Often times it is quicker to

        Re: Need lots of help What do you mean by practicing pairing on the
        backside slots? Doesn't placing the C/E pair into the back slots
        without rotating the entire cube mean that you would have to turn the
        back face sometimes? The way I hold the cube, that's pretty
        difficult. I hold the cube with my non-turning hand on the bottom 2x2x3
        cubes, which leaves my turning hand available to turn the top and side
        faces freely, but makes it difficult to turn the other 4 faces without
        moving my other hand. Is there a different way to hold it so that more
        faces are available for turning? Does this also mean that you guys learn

    Translucent as in a given color? Or clear? I think that if you ask from
        cubesmith you might be able to get tiles without the white backing on
        them, which will make them translucent, although I'm not sure.

        &gt; Campus Center at Rutgers University in Piscataway, NJ. You should &gt; &gt;
        &gt; come. The competition runs from 10am-5pm, but registration will be &gt; &gt;
        &gt; from 9am-10am. Get there before 10am, please. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those of
        you not coming, you can stay updated because I will have &gt; &gt; &gt; live
        updates. I will have wireless this time, so it'll be cool stuff. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; If anything serious happens, I'll tell you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For

    &gt; I do feel that I'm fairly ambidextrous. Do you mean that you
        twist &gt; the faces with both hands? Do you also do the entire move
        sequences &gt; during the F2L with both hands then, depending on the
        location and &gt; orientation of the pieces? Yes, that's right, but
        commonly for each pair you use either L and U or R and U, but have no
        preference which. F2L moves which contain L R and U to solve one pair
        are rare. &gt; &gt; I find that when I do this, simply the process of
        switching hands &gt; slows me down. You have to turn with one hand, then
        grip the cube &gt; with that same hand, then release the cube with the
        other hand, then &gt; turn with the other hand. How is that faster than
        doing everything &gt; with one hand? &gt; It's not necessarily faster,
        but I think it's more easy to be fluent. It is my experience that
        GENERALLY two handed people solve with less delays but slower, more
        fluent turn rates, whereas one handed people have a very high turn rate,
        but with a few pauses between pairs. Don't forget, if you just use
        onehand, you will have to rotate more than someone who uses both hands
        to solve into both R and L side F2L slots. So the time taken to regrip
        (minimal) is matched by the time taken to rotate (minimal) DanH :)

    I'll be there Saturday. Bob, things have been intense. And my free
        time wasn't as free as I thought, so my proposed events aren't
        most likely going to occur. I surely am not ready for 5x5x5 bld. I was
        almost in an accident Thursday night, so I'm a little tense still
        ... If anybody has some x-centers for a rubik's 5x5x5, I'd
        appreciate it if I could buy three of them! This is in reference to
        cubers participating at Rutgers Fall 2006. If I don't get the
        x-centers I'll just have to buy them after the competition. Later,

    Hi guys, We are working hard on a new website for WCA and a great
        database with all competition results. Most work at the moment is done
        by Stefan Pochmann, who is creating all pages for the database (persons,
        competitions, records and events and subpages). We have had help from
        many people, among others Gilles van den Peereboom, Frank Morris and Per
        Kristen Fredlund. Clément Gallet will help us with the design of the new
        WCA website. One feature of the database is that you can make nice
        selections. Here are some. People who competed in 10 or more official

    Hi everyone, Just as a reminder, the Berkeley Fall Tournament is
        tomorrow. Registration is from 9:30am to 10 am and then the tournament
        starts promptly at 10 am. For people going, the place you want to enter
        the campus is at the corner of Hearst Ave and Euclid Ave. You will want
        to enter the campus, then go around the building on your left. The room
        is to the left after you turn the corner. I will try and have poster
        board signs up so that it is easier to find but I'm not sure if
        they are allowed and they might be taken down. Here is the address on
        google maps:
        http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Hearst+Ave+%26+Euclid+Ave,+Berkeley,+CA+94709&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=37.874978,-122.260025&amp;spn=0.012415,0.029697&amp;t=h&amp;om=1
        And here is a photo showing where you need to go:
        http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b103/dkwired/directions.jpg Oh, and
        the green X is a parking garage that you have to pay to park in but it
        is allowed. If you find parking on the street it will probably be free
        and but you have to look for it. If you have any questions, send an
        email to berkeleycubeclub@... and I will try and answer them. Hope to
        see you there! Dan

        better results generate numbers between 1-600 &gt; &gt; &gt; 000 for instance,
        let 1-100000 &gt; R , 100001-200000 &gt; L etc... ) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3 - Generate a
        sequence of random numbers (as many as the desired &gt; &gt; &gt; length of
        scramble sequence) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4 - For each number generate another
        random number to tell how to &gt; &gt; &gt; turn the layer represented by that
        number ... clockwise, 2 steps or &gt; &gt; &gt; ccw &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5 - Display this
        on screen with cube notation &gt; &gt; &gt; (1,1)=R (1,2)=R2 (1,3)=R'
        (2,2)=L2 and so on. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6 - Make it advanced with axis control &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Disallow U'DU2 and so on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's not really all
        too hard - step 6 can be somewhat complex though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck!

    You shouldn't have to compress with Lite8x. I don't know what

        annoying scrambling myself &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do the same kind of
        turns every time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm using a TI-83 Plus Silver

        Hi :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 - Read the manual of ur calculator, about
        it's programming &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ability!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2 - Find out how it
        can generate something random like integers &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; below a certain
        value - u may want integers 1-6 (for the 6 &gt; &gt; layers of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        cube) (for even better results generate numbers between 1-600 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        000 for instance, let 1-100000 &gt; R , 100001-200000 &gt; L etc... ) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3 - Generate a sequence of random numbers (as many as the
        desired &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; length of scramble sequence) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4 -
        For each number generate another random number to tell how to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        turn the layer represented by that number ... clockwise, 2 &gt; steps or &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ccw &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5 - Display this on screen with cube
        notation &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1,1)=R (1,2)=R2 (1,3)=R' (2,2)=L2 and so on. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6 - Make it advanced with axis control &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Disallow U'DU2 and so on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's not really
        all too hard - step 6 can be somewhat complex &gt; &gt; though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Umm, I've started using this term. Hinge Solve - The 4th solve in
        an average of 5 in competition when the first 3 solves have been good.
        The 4th solve makes the average, taking a lot of pressure off of the 5th
        solve. For clarification, I messed up both of my hinge solves on magic
        and master magic...it sucked... Lemme know what you think of the term...

    I only got Craig's last attempt in the Master Magic on video.
        Unfortunately, that was his slowest solve that counted toward the
        average. (He had a DNF in the previous attempt). Still, that average is
        a new world record, so here is that last attempt anyway:

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 - Read the manual of ur
        calculator, about it's programming &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ability!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 2 - Find out how it can generate something random like integers &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; below a certain value - u may want integers 1-6 (for the 6 &gt; &gt; &gt;
        layers of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cube) (for even better results generate
        numbers between &gt; 1-600 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 000 for instance, let 1-100000 &gt; R ,
        100001-200000 &gt; L etc... ) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3 - Generate a
        sequence of random numbers (as many as the &gt; desired &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; length
        of scramble sequence) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4 - For each number
        generate another random number to tell &gt; how to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turn the
        layer represented by that number ... clockwise, 2 &gt; &gt; steps or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ccw &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5 - Display this on screen with cube
        notation &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1,1)=R (1,2)=R2 (1,3)=R' (2,2)=L2 and so on.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6 - Make it advanced with axis control &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Disallow U'DU2 and so on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's not
        really all too hard - step 6 can be somewhat complex &gt; &gt; &gt; though. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        captured the entire five solves on video. Again, I'll provide two

    Hey, does anyone know another source besides rubiks.com to buy a diy kit
        from? Rubiks.com seems to be perpetually out of stock, and I would enjoy
        one of those cubes oooh so much. I was also wondering where I could find
        one of those stack mats that they use for timing in competitions. I
        noticed a few videos online where people had them connected to their
        computers, and they seem like a fun toy to have. Any info would be

        Features: &gt; Average (takes the average over 12 solves, minus best and
        worst) &gt; Scramble (continuously generates and displays scrambles until
        you tell &gt; it to stop) &gt; Alg Avg (a detached averager so you don't
        have to wait for useless &gt; scrambles) &gt; &gt; All of the scrambles follow
        WCA regulations (I think). Unfortunately, &gt; the calculators can't
        handle anything more accurate than seconds, so &gt; it'll have to be
        used in conjunction with a StackMat or wristwatch. &gt; Also, as far as I
        know, this program will only run on the TI-83/84 &gt; series of calculators
        -- I'll work on porting later. &gt; &gt; The program can be downloaded
        here: &gt; http://www.kc8onw.net/~thewonderidiot/calccube.8xp &gt; (do a
        File-&gt;Save As) &gt; &gt; It also requires the OmniCalc app, for the modulus
        function. I'll work &gt; on a heavier version later that doesn't
        require it (it'll run slower, &gt; though). OmniCalc can be downloaded
        here: &gt; http://www.detachedsolutions.com/omnicalc/ &gt; &gt; Any tips for
        improvement would be greatly appreciated. (By the way &gt; guys, this is
        fully open source. Programmers, have fun with it.) &gt; &gt; -Mike Stewart &gt;

    Sorry, mate, the stackmat is not connected to the computer...I
        don't know if that is posible...probably not...what people normally

    Hehe... ok I'll explain it, I don't think anyone will get it
        anyway. Those 16 guys all had an 18.90 seconds 3x3 solve. It's the
        time with the most persons. Well, 19.40 actually appeared 18 times, but
        three people had it twice, so only 15 people got it. Yes I know, a

    &gt; Well, DNS means you didn't start the attempt. DNF means you
        started, tried, &gt; and for some reason did not finish. Yes, that's
        what I understood. I was not allowed a 2nd attempt since my first

    Hi Dan, You can find some for sale at this thread:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5117 I ordered some from
        this guy, and the quality of the cubes are superb. He has them in
        different colors, including white. The pieces are identical to
        Rubiks.com, except the center caps are much better. They are like the
        Studio Cube caps that snap on and stay on. But they still have arches
        like the Rubiks.com DIY kits. The screws, washers, and stickers are the
        only weak part of the kits. The washers are all weird sizes. The screws
        are different depending which color kit. The stickers are vinyl
        flourescent but they aren't perfectly square. I use Cubesmith
        stickers and tiles, anyway. I'd post pictures, but he already has
        good pictures up there. Chris --- In

    AAh, I just assumed it was connected to the computer, because at the end
        of the video, he films the screen showing his times, however I didnt
        notice him typing. It isn't all that important though, a timer is a

        I ordered some from this guy, and the quality of the cubes are &gt; superb.
        He has them in different colors, including white. The &gt; pieces are
        identical to Rubiks.com, except the center caps are much &gt; better. They
        are like the Studio Cube caps that snap on and stay &gt; on. But they still

        sizes. The screws are different depending &gt; which color kit. The
        stickers are vinyl flourescent but they aren't &gt; perfectly square.
        I use Cubesmith stickers and tiles, anyway. I'd &gt; post pictures,

    Hi :-) Sadly there are no (good) sites about fewest moves techniques
        that i know of. I would however recommend to have a look at methods such
        as Petrus for building blocks (also Roux for a different block first
        approach). There's a few commutator pages like Roux' or Joel
        van Noort's. Also studying solutions at dan's fewest moves
        challenge is a good start. Commutators are used for constructing for

    Please correct me if I am wrong, but even if your first attempts lasts
        15 minutes, you are still allowed to have a 2nd attempt, which would
        then last only 5 minutes. At least that is what I understood from

        Sorry to dig this out again, but I'd like to clarify my point. The
        sub10 average claim stated like that is impossible to prove wrong. If
        you're wrong, at no time can this be proven because you can always
        say "wait a little longer and you'll see". But if
        you're right and someone does get sub10, you can then play the
        glorious prophet and say "I called it!". It's like a bet
        designed to be impossible to lose. A good bet should include the
        possibility to prove each side. In the above case, I suggest you be
        brave enough to add something like "in the next three years".

    Not to mention that Macky did a 13.34 second average in the final at
        Caltech the week before. The level of competition there was extremely
        high as well with 53 competitors. It should be noted, however, that
        Macky does math now instead of Rubik's Cube, so we were all
        extremely impressed at his astonishing level of cubing with no practice.
        Macky, you should really just stop getting such good grades in Math 1A
        and just cube instead. At this point, I bet you could avoid turning in
        every single homework set, and probably skip taking the exam, and still

    Hello everyone, I am now in the final steps for organizing Belgian Open
        2007. Nothing is sure yet about these 2 events (4x4 and 5x5 Blindfolded)
        but what were the time limits for these events in previous competitions
        ? I couldn't find that information on speedcubing.com. Also, how
        were these events organized in a practical way ? Because I won't be
        able to offer a separate area. If people want to compete in that, all I
        can do is give them a table in a corner of the room and have someone
        look at them from time to time. Obviously these won't be optimal
        conditions. I even wonder if the event would be official under these
        circumstances. (or I can make it unofficial, that would be a lot easier
        to organize) What do you think ? Thanks ! Gilles

    Different competition directors will structure their competitions

    Hi Stefan, Perhaps he did mess up, but if he spend 10 minutes trying to
        fix something, that's probably not a wise decision. I don't
        really care how someone goes about fixing their solution, but if the

    Hi Gilles, There are no official time limits, because memorization time
        is included. There are of course practical time limits. For WC 2005 we
        had a time frame of 3 hours for 4x4 and 5x5 blindfolded. During that
        time frame competitors could do best of 2 for both events. But they
        could miss other events, because we had some events in parallel.
        Normally we have a separate room for 4x4 and 5x5 blindfolded. If that is
        not possible, then a table in a corner would do too. If of course the
        competitors are willing to compete under those circumstances. Otherwise
        there can not be such an event. Normally I keep an eye on competitors
        competing in a corner. Also from an angle where they cannot see me. You
        can also have shifts for judges. Why have an event, if you do not follow

        7:55 PM Subject: [Speed cubing group] TIme limits - 4x4 and 5x5
        Blindfolded Hello everyone, I am now in the final steps for organizing
        Belgian Open 2007. Nothing is sure yet about these 2 events (4x4 and 5x5
        Blindfolded) but what were the time limits for these events in previous
        competitions ? I couldn't find that information on speedcubing.com.
        Also, how were these events organized in a practical way ? Because I
        won't be able to offer a separate area. If people want to compete
        in that, all I can do is give them a table in a corner of the room and
        have someone look at them from time to time. Obviously these won't
        be optimal conditions. I even wonder if the event would be official
        under these circumstances. (or I can make it unofficial, that would be a
        lot easier to organize) What do you think ? Thanks ! Gilles [Non-text

        at the GWiz competition. Anyways, I've finally released &gt; &gt; version
        1.0. &gt; &gt; Features: &gt; &gt; Average (takes the average over 12 solves, minus
        best and worst) &gt; &gt; Scramble (continuously generates and displays
        scrambles until you tell &gt; &gt; it to stop) &gt; &gt; Alg Avg (a detached

        &gt; All of the scrambles follow WCA regulations (I think). Unfortunately,
        &gt; &gt; the calculators can't handle anything more accurate than
        seconds, so &gt; &gt; it'll have to be used in conjunction with a
        StackMat or wristwatch. &gt; &gt; Also, as far as I know, this program will
        only run on the TI-83/84 &gt; &gt; series of calculators -- I'll work on
        porting later. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The program can be downloaded here: &gt; &gt;
        http://www.kc8onw.net/~thewonderidiot/calccube.8xp &gt; &gt; (do a File-&gt;Save
        As) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It also requires the OmniCalc app, for the modulus function.
        I'll work &gt; &gt; on a heavier version later that doesn't require
        it (it'll run slower, &gt; &gt; though). OmniCalc can be downloaded here:

    Hmm... Are clear plastic cubes allowed? Rule 3h forbids modifications
        that make "more colours/pieces are visible". Question is, what
        do we consider a modification? Does it only mean modifications done by
        the competitor? Or also modifications done by the manufacturer? I'd
        say both, because otherwise you could simply come up with a manufacturer
        that does the modification for you that you yourself aren't allowed
        to do, thereby rendering the rule useless. Opinions? Cheers! Stefan ---

    A 10-minute limit (per attempt) means only Stackmat timing is needed;
        stopwatch timing is not needed. Since a stopwatch was not used, it was
        not measured how much over 10 minutes I took. I would assume the judge
        could have stopped me when the timer shut off, and freed up the Stackmat
        station for another competitor to use, but he let me continue. - Bruce

    I just got a stackmat at target that came in one of those new starter

        only the right sensor. It's not really a problem, because I use the
        stackmat for myself and don't cheat because that would be
        pointless, but this might be a problem for all of the new ones. Has

    In that case I think we will have 4x4 and 5x5 Blindfolded official. I
        thought that to make it official, it had to happen in a separate quiet

        practical time limits. For WC 2005 we had a time frame &gt; of 3 hours for
        4x4 and 5x5 blindfolded. &gt; During that time frame competitors could do
        best of 2 for both events. &gt; But they could miss other events, because
        we had some events in parallel. &gt; &gt; Normally we have a separate room for
        4x4 and 5x5 blindfolded. &gt; If that is not possible, then a table in a
        corner would do too. If of &gt; course the competitors are willing to
        compete under those circumstances. &gt; Otherwise there can not be such an
        event. &gt; Normally I keep an eye on competitors competing in a corner.
        Also from an &gt; angle where they cannot see me. You can also have shifts
        for judges. &gt; &gt; Why have an event, if you do not follow official rules?
        It is not that &gt; much harder to make it official. &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt; &gt; Ron

    Hi:-) Something "similar" has been discussed before; mixing

        should not be allowed to mix cubies of different colors as this may give
        benefits wrt recognition amongst other things. Now, transparent cubes
        will still have all cubies the same "color". So personally i

    Hey Ron, Gilles, I have one thing I'd like to say about speed
        blindfolded and multiple cubes blindfolded. I like the idea of having
        them be official, especially since we have already set official records
        for them. However I understand that the time constraints of adding this
        event can kill the smoothness of a competition and make for time
        problems. I have two solutions to propose for debate, since I do like
        the idea of having speed 3x3 blindfolded and multiple 3x3 blindfolded be
        official events. 1) Run an official event for both speed blindfolded and
        multiple cubes blindfolded and try to work it into the schedule as best
        as possible. However, if a competitior in the speed blindfolded or
        multiple cubes blindfolded misses another event in which he or she is
        competition, they automatically forfeit that round. There are two
        problems with this. What if the person who is 2nd place in the 3x3x3
        speed round decides to do multiple cubes blindfolded and runs over past
        the time allotted for the 3x3x3 semi- finals. This person then forfeits
        the semi-final round and thus should not be allowed to advance to the
        finals. However, what if their time in the 1st round is actually better
        than all the time in the final round (due to nerves in the final, etc.)
        Should this person be allowed the 1st place and winning slot in the
        tournament? I don't know the answer to that question, which is why
        I only proposed this idea for debate. 2) The second idea, also open to
        debate, is to allow for record attempts. The WCA board should appoint
        people who are certified judges for record attempts. This would be
        similar to how we handle the 24 hour cubing marathon. If someone wants
        to break the multiple cubes blindfolded record, that person would
        contact the WCA board. The board then appoints a judge closest to the
        competitior. It is the competitor's and judge's responsibility
        to arrange an official meeting place (i.e. with media attention
        preferrably, and done in a public setting where spectators are aware of
        what is going on and have plenty of space to sit and watch). Then the
        event is handled exactly as if it were at a competition, only that is
        the only event. I see a problem with this idea that needs to be debated
        or fixed before anything like this can happen. There is a larger
        concentration of cubers on the west coast US than the east coast US,
        making it easier to find a judge in your area, and thus easier to
        attempt a record. This of course applies to other areas with sparse
        cubers who want to attempt records as compared to areas with lots of
        cubers who want to attempt records, I only gave the one example since
        it's the area I am more knowledgable about. --------- I think it
        would be good to keep the 3x3x3 speed blindfolded and 3x3x3 multiple
        cubes blindfolded for a couple reasons. 1) We already have records for
        them, 2) They are amazing categories and sure to please an audience, the
        media/press, and also cubers alike who see the results of these events.
        I think these events are positive for the cubing community, and am
        willing to help come up with ideas for keeping them. I understand if
        time constraints mean we can't keep them, as I've helped out
        for competitions before where we cut the allotted time very close.
        However, I think it would be nice to keep these categories. Those are
        just two ideas I had, and I'm willing to change/debate them in any

    Hey everyone I just got my 4x4x4 yesterday and would like to know from
        you experts on it how long should I play with it before lubing. I did 5
        or 6 solves yesterday and more than 15 today already...is it enough?
        also, what's the best way to lube it? dissemble everything? remove
        an edge piece? just turn 2 faces a bit and create an opening and put the
        lube there? oh, another thing...the WCA regulations now use r as
        "the 2 right layers", right? anyone knows if it is the same on
        JNetCube? of if it uses r = 2nd layer from right? thanks Pedro

    Hi Chris, I cannot give my opinion about your second proposal but I can
        do it for the first one. Here is a "nearly final" version of
        the Belgian Open 2007 Schedule :
        http://gillesvdp.orgfree.com/belgianopen2007/Time_Schedule.htm - I place
        these events on the day without the main 3x3 competition and they do not
        have a fixed schedule, making it for a competitor to have more freedom
        to choose his events. Actually at first it was scheduled that these
        competitions are limited in the morning. But what if the competitor
        doesn't want to compete in 4x4 and 5x5 at all ? Then I think it
        should be made possible. The only problem with this is the judges. Last
        year I really had troubles to find judges to make the competition very
        smooth. These events will only make the problem bigger. So I am really
        thinking to limit these events between 9:30 and 13:00 for example. But
        this remains to be decided. - As for going to the final without
        competing in the 2nd round, I think that's just not possible. But
        WCA experts will have a better opinion. (If anyone has comments about
        Belgian Open 2007 schedule, please send them to me at gillesvdp [@]
        skynet.be ) Bye ! Gilles. 2006/11/22, cmhardw
        &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;: &gt; &gt; Hey Ron, Gilles, &gt; &gt; I have one thing
        I'd like to say about speed blindfolded and &gt; multiple cubes
        blindfolded. &gt; &gt; I like the idea of having them be official, especially
        since we have &gt; already set official records for them. &gt; &gt; However I
        understand that the time constraints of adding this event &gt; can kill the
        smoothness of a competition and make for time problems. &gt; &gt; I have two
        solutions to propose for debate, since I do like the idea &gt; of having
        speed 3x3 blindfolded and multiple 3x3 blindfolded be &gt; official events.
        &gt; &gt; 1) Run an official event for both speed blindfolded and multiple &gt;
        cubes blindfolded and try to work it into the schedule as best as &gt;
        possible. However, if a competitior in the speed blindfolded or &gt;
        multiple cubes blindfolded misses another event in which he or she &gt; is
        competition, they automatically forfeit that round. &gt; &gt; There are two
        problems with this. What if the person who is 2nd &gt; place in the 3x3x3
        speed round decides to do multiple cubes &gt; blindfolded and runs over
        past the time allotted for the 3x3x3 semi- &gt; finals. This person then
        forfeits the semi-final round and thus &gt; should not be allowed to
        advance to the finals. However, what if &gt; their time in the 1st round is
        actually better than all the time in &gt; the final round (due to nerves in
        the final, etc.) Should this &gt; person be allowed the 1st place and
        winning slot in the tournament? &gt; &gt; I don't know the answer to that
        question, which is why I only &gt; proposed this idea for debate. &gt; &gt; 2)
        The second idea, also open to debate, is to allow for record &gt; attempts.
        The WCA board should appoint people who are certified &gt; judges for
        record attempts. This would be similar to how we handle &gt; the 24 hour
        cubing marathon. If someone wants to break the multiple &gt; cubes
        blindfolded record, that person would contact the WCA board. &gt; The board
        then appoints a judge closest to the competitior. It is &gt; the
        competitor's and judge's responsibility to arrange an official
        &gt; meeting place (i.e. with media attention preferrably, and done in a &gt;
        public setting where spectators are aware of what is going on and &gt; have
        plenty of space to sit and watch). Then the event is handled &gt; exactly
        as if it were at a competition, only that is the only event. &gt; &gt; I see a
        problem with this idea that needs to be debated or fixed &gt; before
        anything like this can happen. There is a larger &gt; concentration of
        cubers on the west coast US than the east coast US, &gt; making it easier
        to find a judge in your area, and thus easier to &gt; attempt a record.
        This of course applies to other areas with sparse &gt; cubers who want to
        attempt records as compared to areas with lots of &gt; cubers who want to
        attempt records, I only gave the one example &gt; since it's the area
        I am more knowledgable about. &gt; &gt; --------- &gt; &gt; I think it would be good
        to keep the 3x3x3 speed blindfolded and &gt; 3x3x3 multiple cubes
        blindfolded for a couple reasons. 1) We &gt; already have records for them,
        2) They are amazing categories and &gt; sure to please an audience, the
        media/press, and also cubers alike &gt; who see the results of these
        events. I think these events are &gt; positive for the cubing community,
        and am willing to help come up &gt; with ideas for keeping them. &gt; &gt; I
        understand if time constraints mean we can't keep them, as
        I've &gt; helped out for competitions before where we cut the allotted
        time &gt; very close. However, I think it would be nice to keep these &gt;
        categories. &gt; &gt; Those are just two ideas I had, and I'm willing to
        change/debate &gt; them in any way necessary to try to help keep these
        events, as I &gt; think they are positive for our community, despite the
        challenges of &gt; holding these events in a competition. &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; ---

    Hi Chris, My main concern for these events is the time for memorization.
        What is better: = someone solving speed blindfolded in 20 seconds, after
        6 hours of memorization or = someone solving speed blindfolded in 25
        seconds, after 30 minutes of memorization. Same goes for multiple
        blindfolded. What are your ideas in that subject? Have fun, Ron -----

    Whether someone turns both right layers or just the inner right layer is
        a decision of the person scrambling. I don't think anything special
        needs to be done to the scramble alg to allow for either method. The

    I have another major objection against "multiple". I
        can't imagine a good format (after all we said on the WCA forum). A
        competitor who takes time to solve only 1 cube without risks beats
        another who "only" solves 7 out of 8... I think a standard
        blindfold solving event is enough for official competitions, even if the
        list of new specialized challenges and records that could be interesting
        is much longer. If there's a large community that wants it,
        it's different, but at least find a good format. Gilles. --- In

        Sent: Wednesday, November 22, 2006 5:35 PM &gt; Subject: [Speed cubing
        group] Re: TIme limits - 4x4 and 5x5 Blindfolded &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Ron, Gilles,
        &gt; &gt; I have one thing I'd like to say about speed blindfolded and &gt;
        multiple cubes blindfolded. &gt; &gt; I like the idea of having them be
        official, especially since we have &gt; already set official records for
        them. &gt; &gt; However I understand that the time constraints of adding this
        event &gt; can kill the smoothness of a competition and make for time
        problems. &gt; &gt; I have two solutions to propose for debate, since I do
        like the idea &gt; of having speed 3x3 blindfolded and multiple 3x3
        blindfolded be &gt; official events. &gt; &gt; 1) Run an official event for both
        speed blindfolded and multiple &gt; cubes blindfolded and try to work it
        into the schedule as best as &gt; possible. However, if a competitior in
        the speed blindfolded or &gt; multiple cubes blindfolded misses another
        event in which he or she &gt; is competition, they automatically forfeit
        that round. &gt; &gt; There are two problems with this. What if the person who
        is 2nd &gt; place in the 3x3x3 speed round decides to do multiple cubes &gt;
        blindfolded and runs over past the time allotted for the 3x3x3 semi- &gt;
        finals. This person then forfeits the semi-final round and thus &gt; should
        not be allowed to advance to the finals. However, what if &gt; their time
        in the 1st round is actually better than all the time in &gt; the final
        round (due to nerves in the final, etc.) Should this &gt; person be allowed
        the 1st place and winning slot in the tournament? &gt; &gt; I don't know
        the answer to that question, which is why I only &gt; proposed this idea
        for debate. &gt; &gt; 2) The second idea, also open to debate, is to allow for
        record &gt; attempts. The WCA board should appoint people who are certified
        &gt; judges for record attempts. This would be similar to how we handle &gt;
        the 24 hour cubing marathon. If someone wants to break the multiple &gt;
        cubes blindfolded record, that person would contact the WCA board. &gt; The
        board then appoints a judge closest to the competitior. It is &gt; the
        competitor's and judge's responsibility to arrange an official
        &gt; meeting place (i.e. with media attention preferrably, and done in a &gt;
        public setting where spectators are aware of what is going on and &gt; have
        plenty of space to sit and watch). Then the event is handled &gt; exactly
        as if it were at a competition, only that is the only event. &gt; &gt; I see a
        problem with this idea that needs to be debated or fixed &gt; before
        anything like this can happen. There is a larger &gt; concentration of
        cubers on the west coast US than the east coast US, &gt; making it easier
        to find a judge in your area, and thus easier to &gt; attempt a record.
        This of course applies to other areas with sparse &gt; cubers who want to
        attempt records as compared to areas with lots of &gt; cubers who want to
        attempt records, I only gave the one example &gt; since it's the area
        I am more knowledgable about. &gt; &gt; --------- &gt; &gt; I think it would be good
        to keep the 3x3x3 speed blindfolded and &gt; 3x3x3 multiple cubes
        blindfolded for a couple reasons. 1) We &gt; already have records for them,
        2) They are amazing categories and &gt; sure to please an audience, the
        media/press, and also cubers alike &gt; who see the results of these
        events. I think these events are &gt; positive for the cubing community,
        and am willing to help come up &gt; with ideas for keeping them. &gt; &gt; I
        understand if time constraints mean we can't keep them, as
        I've &gt; helped out for competitions before where we cut the allotted
        time &gt; very close. However, I think it would be nice to keep these &gt;
        categories. &gt; &gt; Those are just two ideas I had, and I'm willing to
        change/debate &gt; them in any way necessary to try to help keep these
        events, as I &gt; think they are positive for our community, despite the
        challenges of &gt; holding these events in a competition. &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; ---

    I admit that my sub10-average claim was a bit stupid. But partly it was
        intended to be. I had in mind to see the interest in discussing the
        3x3x3 format in the light of lucky solves. Now we have an average 3(5).
        The probablilty of a great average caused by lucky solves could be

    Hi Anders, I think there is good validity in this. For the final of a
        major tournament where everyone is very fast, it is actually feasible to
        do an average of 10 (12 solves, truncating fastest and slowest) and it
        might be exciting to watch because you have more solves the count. Dan
        Dzoan is great... don't get me wrong, but that 14.41 second average
        was crazy fast, and most likely not representative of what he does on a
        more normal (human-state, not powered by the vessels of anima) average.
        I think it's something that could be discussed with the WCA Board.

        and stickers are the only weak part of the kits. &gt; The washers are all
        weird sizes. The screws are different depending &gt; which color kit. The
        stickers are vinyl flourescent but they aren't &gt; perfectly square.

    Hey Ron, I think ideally the solve done in 20 seconds, despite 6 hours
        of memorization should be considered the better solve. This is because
        for speed blindfolded only the solving time should count. I would also
        say that a person solving in 20.00 seconds who memorized in 6 hours ties
        a person who solves in 20.00 seconds who memorized in 2 hours. This is
        because of our definition of speed blindfolded. We could ammend this
        category by saying that the memorization time does count. However this
        turns back into the regular blindfolded solving where you try to
        memorize and solve in roughly the same amount of time. As for
        competitions I agree that someone memorizing for 6 hours poses a
        problem, because this person needs to be supervised by a judge for the
        entirity of that time. I personally like the idea of having the WCA
        recognize records in the same way that Guinness does. If you break a
        record under the scrutiny of a WCA appointed judge/delegate/observer of
        records, and this attempt is done in a public setting with media and
        spectators, then that should be the new world record. This lets the
        majority of competitors focus on the mainstream events and lets the
        minority who focus on fringe events do so without holding up the main
        competition. As one example at an official tournament you can have an
        official WCA world record judge to let people attempt the weirder
        records. These people attempting would not be allowed to compete in the
        official "mainstream" event running alongside it. This is just
        an idea. I know there has already been strong opposition to the idea of
        a WCA judge who judges record attempts not done in an official
        competition, and probably rightly so. I get the impression my ideas
        usually have more problems than good, I'm just trying to help out.
        I know that I will continue to focus on the big cubes BLD categories
        very seriously because I don't see how I could ever catch up to the
        new standards of mainstream speedcubing. After competing in big cubes
        BLD so many times though I realize how much of a burden it is on the
        competition. That's exactly why almost every time I have competed
        in the big cubes BLD events (except US Nationals) I have helped
        scramble/judge/etc. rather than compete in many if any other events. If
        people like me want to practice a weirder category so much, why restrict
        us from doing it if we're willing to make concessions on regular
        mainstream events at a competition? I'm perfectly willing to give
        up 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and other speed events in order to get my two attempts
        per cube for the big cubes BLD event. Why shouldn't someone else be
        able to do multiple cubes blindfolded or speed 3x3 blindfolded assuming
        they are willing to give up other events and help judge/etc.? For some
        tournaments I realize the judge shortage makes not even this concession
        possible. Yes I have helped out as a judge at tournaments before, so I
        know how hard it is to fill the timers when you don't have enough
        judges. I just feel like the "fringe" events are looked down
        on by people who compete in the more "mainstream" events,
        since they take away from the mainstream events. This is rightly so
        because usually the fringe event competitiors are also mainstream event
        competitors, and that causes problems for time at a tournament. But if
        us fringe event people are willing to give up competing in mainstream
        events, shouldn't that fix the problem? You could make it a
        condition of competing in big cubes BLD, speed 3x3 BLD, and multiple 3x3
        BLD that you must help judge the main events and must not compete in
        those events so that you don't hold up the tournaments. I would be
        willing to do this for big cubes BLD, since I've seen how much of a
        burden it is to compete in my favorite events. I would be perfectly
        willing to accept that as a condition of getting 2 solves per big cube
        BLD event. If someone wants to do multiple 3x3 BLD, or speed 3x3 BLD,
        but is not willing to compromise on helping make the competition run
        more smoothly, then they obviously don't want to compete in those
        events enough and it would be understandable to not allow those events.
        If we are willing to make concessions, why should the event always and
        forever be made unofficial at the expense of those who do enjoy
        practicing those events? I realize that I am speaking more in theory. I
        realize that you can't please everybody all of the time. All
        I'm saying is that as a "fringe event" competitor I am
        willing to make concessions to help make sure the tournament runs more
        smoothly when I attempt the bigger cubes BLD, and I think making this a
        requirement for these fringe events could make it easier to have them at
        competitions. As always these are just suggestions, I know the ultimate
        decision rests with the community and the WCA board. I just think it
        would be nice to allow people to focus on the categories they love
        and/or are good at, even if that event is not a mainstream speedcubing
        event. This is, of course, under the condition that those fringe event
        people are willing to make concessions in order to make the overall
        competition they are at run smoothly enough to please everyone. Chris

    Hey Gilles, Yes I also agree that someone who attempts and solves one
        cube should not outdo someone who attempts 8 and solves "only"
        7 even though our current rules have that happen. Why not a points
        system, similar to how the memory experts do things? I don't fully
        understand their system, but if someone attempts to memorize 4000 binary
        digits and only correctly recalls 3800 of them, they don't consider
        the attempt a 100% total and complete failure, they just adjust the
        score so that it appears the person memorized 3700-3800 or something
        like that. This is of course a simplified explanation, since I
        don't fully understand how an incorrectly recalled piece of
        information affects their score. Maybe instead of considering attempting
        8 and solving 7 a 100% complete and total failure something like this.
        You get 2 points for successfully solving an attempted cube, and -1
        points for each cube attempted and DNF'd. So attempting 1 and
        solving 1 is 2 poinst. Attempting 8 and solving 7 is 7*(2)-1=13 points.
        So the person who attempted 8 and solved 7 still soundly beats the
        person who attempted and solved one, which is what should happen in my
        opinion. Just a thought. I would suggest that if this is something of
        interest that we should find a point system that works best for cubing,
        rather than modeling the points system for memory sports exactly without
        any change. But then again I shouldn't say much since I don't

    I agree that the cancellation effect Tim mentions would make the
        JNetCube scrambles effectively shorter, and thus, arguably of less
        quality, if the lower case letters are treated as double-layer twists
        rather than a single inner layer turn. For unofficial records, 40 moves
        is recommended for 4x4x4 (I'm not clear if actually required) and
        JNetCube appears to use exactly 40-move scrambles. So I would suggest
        using single-layer turns for the lower-case moves in JNetCube scramble
        algs if you are planning to post unofficial records; but if you're
        just practicing, use either double-layer or single-layer turns as you
        wish, since I think you will still get a reasonably good scrambling
        either way, in my opinion. If you want to check your scrambles with the
        View Scramble command, you have to use single-layer turns, though. BTW,
        it seems that the View Scramble command for 5x5x5 doesn't work. It
        seems to show rather minimally scrambled cubes (at least the version I
        have). - Bruce --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Tim

    Ok, I borrowed my sister's TI-83 and ported over the scrambling
        algorithm generator from my TI-89 cube timer program. It's kind of
        long, but I tested it and it works on hers. I'll post the code here
        so if you (or anyone) feels like typing it in you certainly may. Notes:
        The program is not 100% wca compliant because each turn is necessarily
        in a layer orthogonal to the layer the previous twist: example - You
        will never see B B' but nor will you see B F2 . The scrambles are
        of random length between 20 and 27 twists long. When programming, I will
        use "-&gt;" to denote the "sto" button. Also, it is
        important to utilize the built in calculator commands instead of typing
        them out: example - Instead of typing "IF" hit
        "prgm" then scroll to "If" and press
        "enter" Anything after a "//" should not be typed
        it's just information I'm giving you. Every time you hit
        "Enter" it automatically adds the ":" It
        doesn't matter if your line of code wraps past the edge of the
        screen. And please all you professional coders, keep the criticism to a
        minimum, coding's just a hobby for me =P I'm never very
        elegant nor efficient! Without further ado: Hit "prgm" then
        "new" and press "enter" Title your program, I use
        "qb" &lt;code&gt; :ClrHome // found under "catalog"
        (2nd then 0) :iPart(rand6)-&gt;M //iPart is found under
        "Math"-&gt;"num" //rand is under
        "Math"-&gt;"prb" :iPart(rand7)-&gt;A :(A+20)-&gt;A :3-&gt;Y
        :1-&gt;X :Output(1,2,"SCRAMBLING ALG") //Output is found under
        "prgm"-&gt;"I/O" :0-&gt;S :Lbl t //Lbl is found under
        "Prgm"-&gt;"CTL" :S+1-&gt;S :M-&gt;L :Lbl R :iPart(rand6)-&gt;M
        :If M=L //if is found under "Prgm"-&gt;"CTL" :Then
        //Then is found under "Prgm"-&gt;"CTL" :Goto R //Goto
        is found under "Prgm"-&gt;"CTL" :End //End is found

        //or is under "Test"-&gt;"Logic" :Then :If M=(L+1)
        :Then :Goto R :End :End :If L=1 or L=3 or L=5 :Then :If M=L-1 :Then
        :Goto R :End :End :If M=0 :Then :Output(Y,X,"F") //I know y,x
        goes against convention, sorry :end :If M=1 :Then
        :Output(Y,X,"B") :end :If M=2 :Then :Output(Y,X,"R")
        :end :If M=3 :Then :Output(Y,X,"L") :end :If M=4 :Then
        :Output(Y,X,"U") :end :If M=5 :Then :Output(Y,X,"D")
        :end :X+1-&gt;X :iPart(rand3)-&gt;D :If D=0 :Then :X+1-&gt;X :End :If D=1 :Then

        :Then :Goto T :End &lt;/code&gt; Should just be able to go to
        "prgm"-&gt;"exec"-&gt;qb and get a scrambling alg (and hit

    I had the same discussion at the Berkeley competition. And I disagree. I
        think the reason that chess, tennis and football have point ranking
        systems is that the skill of the competitors is not directly measurable.
        This is because they're essentially duels, where you fight others
        rather than try to accomplish something measurable. So all objective
        information that's available is who beat who when, and it makes
        sense to try to compute a number out of all that. In sports like
        running, jumping etc the skill of the performer is directly measurable,
        and AFAIK they never have rating systems. And I think speed cubing is
        clearly in this category. It's hard to imagine that any rating
        system could be more informative that learning somebody's best
        times. Titles can still be fun, but I like how we hand those out to
        people who win championships. On Nov 22, 2006, at 22:52, JohnLouis Louis

        will still get a reasonably good scrambling either way, in my opinion.
        If you want to check your scrambles with the View Scramble command, you
        have to use single-layer turns, though. Yeah, that was the main reason I
        wanted to know about the scrambling type, I like to check my
        scramble...but, well, it doesn't mattet that much, as my times are
        3 - 4 minutes right now...haha...the cube is sooooooooo stiff... any
        help on the other questions? Pedro BTW, it seems that the View Scramble
        command for 5x5x5 doesn't work. It seems to show rather minimally
        scrambled cubes (at least the version I have). - Bruce --- In

    Hi, and welcome to the world of speedcubing! don't worry if you
        don't understand that (or any of the other) guides at first, some
        of the terminology and abbreviations can take a little to get used to,
        and it can be hard at first to try to translate the algorithms from
        printed page to actual movements on the cube at first, but it's
        really not that bad. just keep at it and it gets easier to understand
        very quickly. as far as corner/edge pairing, it's the step right
        after forming the cross in Fridrich or other layer by layer methods.
        Like many cubers, I solve white cross on bottom first, then insert 2
        pieces at a time in each of the 4 slots until all of the first 2 layers
        (or bottom 2 layers the way I do it) are complete. Almost all of the c/e
        algorithms consist of a setup step to put the corner piece and the edge
        piece in the correct relative "starting" position, then a step
        to unite the c/e pieces so they're next to each other and with the
        correct orientation usually somewhere on the top layer, and finally a
        step to insert the pair into the correct slot on the cube. in most
        beginner methods, after completing the white (or whatever color) cross
        you might insert the white corner pieces first, then go to the second
        layer edge pieces. c/e pairing combines those two steps into one, so
        cross + 4 c/e pairs results in first 2 layers completed. best advice i
        can give on that is find a site with some of the algorithms and go
        through them slowly watching what happens to the corner and edge pieces,
        try to pick apart the algs into those little steps of setting it up,
        combining, and inserting the pair. working corner/working edge is a
        little different. but the guide you have is a good start for moving from
        a beginner method to a more advanced method and the algs you'll
        learn will stay with you forever. Also, I don't think mastering the
        first 2 layers could be over-emphasized--you have to do it 4 times in
        each solve, so getting really fast at this step can go a long way to
        improving your times. best of luck! --Kirk --- In

    Hi Chris, Gilles and Ron, I fully agree with Chris not because I am one
        of the victims of existing rules for multiple cubes blindfolded, but it
        is good for this sport I feel. I do not consider myself as a cuber,
        although I love this sport/hobby very much. I can tell you the scoring
        system in memory sports. Binary Digits:- There will be 30 digits in a
        line. If you recall all the 30 digits correctly, you will get 30 points
        for that line. If there is only 1 mistake, you will get only 15 points
        for that line. If there is more than 1 mistake or not completed, you
        will get "zero" points for that line. Since it is a time limit
        event, the last line is counted even if it is not complete, however the
        mistake rule applies to it. Random numbers:- There will be 40 numbers in
        a line. If you recall all the 40 numbers correctly, you will get 40
        points for that line. If there is only 1 mistake, you will get only 20
        points for that line. If there is more than 1 mistake or not completed,
        you will get "zero" points for that line. Since it is a time
        limit event, the last line is counted even if it is not complete,
        however the mistake rule applies to it. Pack Of cards :- All correcet=
        52 points. 1 mistake = 26 points. 2 or more mistakes = zero points. Few
        more suggestions :- 1).Like in memory sports, only one mistake say 1
        pair of corners or one pair of edges wrong may be given some weightage.
        2).More than 25% wrong the negative scoring should be more. For example
        tried 10 cubes but 3 cubes are wrong. 3).More than 50% wrong the
        negative scoring should be still more.For example tried 10 cubes but 6
        cubes are wrong. 4).More than 75% wrong the negative scoring should be
        still more.For example tried 10 cubes but 8 cubes are wrong. 5).Speed
        blindfold and multiple cubes blindfold may be made official. Just a
        thought. John Louis cmhardw &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote: Hey
        Gilles, Yes I also agree that someone who attempts and solves one cube
        should not outdo someone who attempts 8 and solves "only" 7
        even though our current rules have that happen. Why not a points system,
        similar to how the memory experts do things? I don't fully
        understand their system, but if someone attempts to memorize 4000 binary
        digits and only correctly recalls 3800 of them, they don't consider
        the attempt a 100% total and complete failure, they just adjust the
        score so that it appears the person memorized 3700-3800 or something
        like that. This is of course a simplified explanation, since I
        don't fully understand how an incorrectly recalled piece of
        information affects their score. Maybe instead of considering attempting
        8 and solving 7 a 100% complete and total failure something like this.
        You get 2 points for successfully solving an attempted cube, and -1
        points for each cube attempted and DNF'd. So attempting 1 and
        solving 1 is 2 poinst. Attempting 8 and solving 7 is 7*(2)-1=13 points.
        So the person who attempted 8 and solved 7 still soundly beats the
        person who attempted and solved one, which is what should happen in my
        opinion. Just a thought. I would suggest that if this is something of
        interest that we should find a point system that works best for cubing,
        rather than modeling the points system for memory sports exactly without
        any change. But then again I shouldn't say much since I don't
        understand their system very well. Chris --- In

        explained, they consider a row of digits a unit, evaluate each row

        cube as a unit. The crucial point which John didn't mention is that
        they have a fixed amout of time. Everybody has for example 30 minutes to
        memorize as much as possible (and then later a fixed amount of time to
        recall as much as possible). There we differ so far because we've
        given different time limits for different number of cubes. So someone
        can solve more cubes simply by using more time. I have suggested in the
        WCA forum to give everybody 60 minutes and then you solve as many cubes
        as you can in that amount of time, counting all successes and ignoring
        the failures. Then that would be similar to what the memo guys do. &gt;

        Attempting 8 and solving 7 is 7*(2)-1=13 points. That sounds good, at
        least if we don't use a fixed time limit. The problem of counting
        successes and ignoring failures is that you can let them give you 10
        cubes when you really only intend to do five, and pick the five easiest
        ones. That would be discouraged with your idea of actually punishing
        cubes you attempt but don't solve. However... assume you achieve
        like John did, 7 correct and one with just two edges flipped. So
        you're pretty much as close to 8 as you possibly can, yet
        you'll lose to someone who got 7 out of 7. Stefan

    Hi:-) For the fmc competition there is rating as u know Lars. And the

        the competitors is not directly &gt; measurable. This is because
        they're essentially duels, where you &gt; fight others rather than try
        to accomplish something measurable. So &gt; all objective information
        that's available is who beat who when, and &gt; it makes sense to try

        It's hard to imagine &gt; that any rating system could be more

        sport the skill is also directly measurable, yet they have ratings and
        titles. The reason I think is that while they don't need that for
        each category (speed numbers, hour cards, words, etc), they use it to
        get an *overall* rating of everybody, combining the stats of all
        categories in some weighted way. So they can not only say who's the
        best speed number memorizer and the best hour cards memorizer, but
        simply "the best memorizer". Overall. And of course not only

    I think it would probably be cool to have a kind of ranking for cubing

        Hi:-) For the fmc competition there is rating as u know Lars. And the
        solutions are directly measurable in a number of metrics. So i see no
        real contradiction between having rating and performances that are
        directly measurable ;-) Whether speedcubing/speedpuzzling rating is
        desirable is another matter and mostly just a personal preference thing

        Berkeley competition. And I disagree. &gt; &gt; I think the reason that chess,
        tennis and football have point ranking &gt; systems is that the skill of
        the competitors is not directly &gt; measurable. This is because
        they're essentially duels, where you &gt; fight others rather than try
        to accomplish something measurable. So &gt; all objective information
        that's available is who beat who when, and &gt; it makes sense to try
        to compute a number out of all that. &gt; &gt; In sports like running, jumping
        etc the skill of the performer is &gt; directly measurable, and AFAIK they
        never have rating systems. And I &gt; think speed cubing is clearly in this
        category. It's hard to imagine &gt; that any rating system could be
        more informative that learning &gt; somebody's best times. &gt; &gt; Titles
        can still be fun, but I like how we hand those out to people &gt; who win

        some points system be introduced in cubing &gt; &gt; as well ? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some

    Hi Stefan, Chris, John Louis, Ron... - The competitor is given T
        minutes. - The competitor asks for N scrambled cubes. - The competitor
        solves M&lt;N cubes. - Result=a*M-b*(N-M). - When results are identical,
        the best time wins. Mhhh... Looks good. But T is a problem. Some
        competitors may want more than 60 minutes
        (http://speedcubing.com/records/recs_bf_333num.html), if the goal really
        is to solve as many cubes as possible. How many people would be
        interested in this category? By the way, I think that "multiple
        blindfolded" would be ok for a Guiness-like special record, with
        simple rules. No time constraint, N cubes to be solved. Gilles. --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why not a points system, similar to how the memory experts do &gt;
        &gt; things? I don't fully understand their system, but if someone &gt; &gt;
        attempts to memorize 4000 binary digits and only correctly recalls &gt; &gt;
        3800 of them, they don't consider the attempt a 100% total and &gt; &gt;
        complete failure, they just adjust the score so that it appears the &gt; &gt;
        person memorized 3700-3800 or something like that. &gt; &gt; Like John already
        explained, they consider a row of digits a unit, &gt; evaluate each row
        separately and take the sum. In cubing, naturally &gt; I'd think of a
        cube as a unit. &gt; &gt; The crucial point which John didn't mention is
        that they have a fixed &gt; amout of time. Everybody has for example 30
        minutes to memorize as &gt; much as possible (and then later a fixed amount
        of time to recall as &gt; much as possible). &gt; &gt; There we differ so far
        because we've given different time limits for &gt; different number of
        cubes. So someone can solve more cubes simply by &gt; using more time. &gt; &gt;
        I have suggested in the WCA forum to give everybody 60 minutes and &gt;
        then you solve as many cubes as you can in that amount of time, &gt;
        counting all successes and ignoring the failures. Then that would be &gt;
        similar to what the memo guys do. &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe instead of considering
        attempting 8 and solving 7 a 100% &gt; &gt; complete and total failure
        something like this. You get 2 points &gt; &gt; for successfully solving an
        attempted cube, and -1 points for each &gt; &gt; cube attempted and
        DNF'd. So attempting 1 and solving 1 is 2 &gt; &gt; poinst. Attempting 8
        and solving 7 is 7*(2)-1=13 points. &gt; &gt; That sounds good, at least if we
        don't use a fixed time limit. The &gt; problem of counting successes
        and ignoring failures is that you can &gt; let them give you 10 cubes when
        you really only intend to do five, &gt; and pick the five easiest ones.
        That would be discouraged with your &gt; idea of actually punishing cubes
        you attempt but don't solve. &gt; &gt; However... assume you achieve like
        John did, 7 correct and one with &gt; just two edges flipped. So
        you're pretty much as close to 8 as you &gt; possibly can, yet
        you'll lose to someone who got 7 out of 7. &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt;

    Ok, I typed it all in. It doesn't work completely. It will show

        just be how it looks once you post the message. You had five

        You had a "-" sign there somewhere. Is that a negative or a

    One basis for a rating might simply be a transformation of your long
        term average maybe? So your times contribute to not only the competition
        that you are participating in, but also to your long term series of
        times. Then, if you have a bad tournament, it doesn't affect your
        rating, as long as it's a one off. Then, once you've solved a
        threshold number of cubes, your oldest times drop off the end, to be
        replaced by your new times. If you didn't solve the threshold
        number of cubes, your rating would be provisional. That could work maybe
        as the barebones of a system. Defining the rating someone would need to
        be called International Master, Grand Master etc, would be quite
        subjective though :) Dan :) --- In

        hard to &gt; imagine &gt; &gt; that any rating system could be more informative
        that learning &gt; &gt; somebody's best times. &gt; &gt; In the memory sport
        the skill is also directly measurable, yet they &gt; have ratings and
        titles. The reason I think is that while they don't &gt; need that for
        each category (speed numbers, hour cards, words, etc), &gt; they use it to
        get an *overall* rating of everybody, combining the &gt; stats of all
        categories in some weighted way. So they can not only &gt; say who's
        the best speed number memorizer and the best hour cards &gt; memorizer, but
        simply "the best memorizer". Overall. And of course &gt; not only
        the best but generally to have an overall ranking of &gt; everbody. Like
        some guys have done it here for cubing already, Dan &gt; Harris recently
        and someone else computed "top cubers" and "top &gt;

    Hi guys, I wrote my own scrambler very simply, 17 lines I believe. I
        don't believe this is fully WCA compliant, but it does not include
        repeats like U U', and it cancels out stuff like U D U2. The only
        reason I am not sure is because it will also cancel out stuff like U F
        U2, which is legal. This will be fixed in the next version, but it will
        be a few lines longer. Here is my code, I will explain its usage at the
        end. :Input C :DelVar ADelVar B"UDFBLR2'-&gt;Str1 :".-&gt;Str2
        :For(I,1,C :Lbl A :randInt(1,6-&gt;A :If A=B or A=C :Goto A :B-&gt;C :A-&gt;B
        :Str2+sub(Str1,A,1-&gt;Str2 :randInt(0,2-&gt;A :If A
        :Str2+sub(Str1,A+6,1-&gt;Str2 :Str2+" -&gt;Str2 :End Notes about my code:
        - I use -&gt; to represent Sto&gt; (store) found above ON. - No changes need
        to be made to this code. Yes, it looks odd, but it works exactly as
        presented. - This program uses only 6 variables: A, B, C, I, Str1, and
        Str2 - When entering this code, you do not have to enter the : before
        each line. Usage of this program: After entering this program and
        running it, you will be prompted with a question mark. Enter the length
        of the scramble you want. The program will run, (note: it will take
        longer depending on the length of the scramble). When the program
        displays Done, press VARS, 7 (or scroll down to String), 2 (or Str2),
        then press Enter twice. The scramble will be displayed. You can scroll
        left and right with the arrow keys. I'll be working on a full
        "jnetcube suite" for the calc this week. Have fun! -Peter

        anticlockwise &gt; versions of the letters. I even checked to see if I

        &gt; You had a "-" sign there somewhere. Is that a negative or a

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The scrambles are of random length between 20 and 27 twists
        long. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When programming, I will use "-&gt;" to denote
        the "sto" button. Also, &gt; &gt; &gt; it is important to utilize the
        built in calculator commands instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; typing them out: example -
        Instead of typing "IF" hit "prgm" then &gt; &gt; &gt; scroll

        &gt; &gt; &gt; giving you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every time you hit "Enter" it
        automatically adds the ":" It doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; matter if
        your line of code wraps past the edge of the screen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And

        This will be fixed in the next version, but it will be a few &gt; lines

        mark. Enter the length of the scramble you want. The &gt; program will run,
        (note: it will take longer depending on the length &gt; of the scramble).
        When the program displays Done, press VARS, 7 (or &gt; scroll down to
        String), 2 (or Str2), then press Enter twice. The &gt; scramble will be
        displayed. You can scroll left and right with the &gt; arrow keys. &gt; &gt;

    I guess there were a few other things I should have noted: - On the
        second to last line, there is a quote ", then a space, then the
        store symbol. - To display the scramble, press VARS 7 2 Enter Make sure
        Str2 is displayed on the screen, or else you will get the line
        UDFBLR2' - The . before the scramble is there for simplicity of
        coding. Ignore it. (not in the code, but in the outputed scramble) If

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When programming, I will use "-&gt;" to denote
        the "sto" button. &gt; Also, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is important to utilize
        the built in calculator commands &gt; &gt; instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; typing them
        out: example - Instead of typing "IF" hit "prgm"

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anything after a "//" should not be typed
        it's just &gt; information I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every time you hit "Enter" it automatically adds the
        ":" It &gt; doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter if your line of code
        wraps past the edge of the screen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And please all

        GRAND MASTER OF CUBING One basis for a rating might simply be a
        transformation of your long term average maybe? So your times contribute
        to not only the competition that you are participating in, but also to
        your long term series of times. Then, if you have a bad tournament, it
        doesn't affect your rating, as long as it's a one off. Then,
        once you've solved a threshold number of cubes, your oldest times
        drop off the end, to be replaced by your new times. If you didn't
        solve the threshold number of cubes, your rating would be provisional.
        That could work maybe as the barebones of a system. Defining the rating
        someone would need to be called International Master, Grand Master etc,
        would be quite subjective though :) Dan :) --- In

        that learning &gt; &gt; somebody's best times. &gt; &gt; In the memory sport
        the skill is also directly measurable, yet they &gt; have ratings and
        titles. The reason I think is that while they don't &gt; need that for
        each category (speed numbers, hour cards, words, etc), &gt; they use it to
        get an *overall* rating of everybody, combining the &gt; stats of all
        categories in some weighted way. So they can not only &gt; say who's
        the best speed number memorizer and the best hour cards &gt; memorizer, but
        simply "the best memorizer". Overall. And of course &gt; not only
        the best but generally to have an overall ranking of &gt; everbody. Like
        some guys have done it here for cubing already, Dan &gt; Harris recently
        and someone else computed "top cubers" and "top &gt;
        puzzlers" of WC2005. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

    Ok, I got it to work. I think I prefer the other way of seeing the
        scramble. Having to scroll isn't too much fun. I also like the idea
        of just pressing enter again to get a different scramble. But, it is
        great that you managed to get a scrambler with so little lines :) --- In

        believe this is fully WCA compliant, but it does not include repeats &gt; &gt;

        (note: it will take longer depending on the length &gt; &gt; &gt; of the
        scramble). When the program displays Done, press VARS, 7 (or &gt; &gt; &gt;
        scroll down to String), 2 (or Str2), then press Enter twice. The &gt; &gt; &gt;
        scramble will be displayed. You can scroll left and right with the &gt; &gt; &gt;

        "IF" hit "prgm" &gt; then &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scroll to
        "If" and press "enter" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Anything after a "//" should not be typed it's just &gt; &gt;
        information I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Every time you hit "Enter" it automatically adds the
        ":" It &gt; &gt; doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter if your line of
        code wraps past the edge of the screen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And
        please all you professional coders, keep the criticism to a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        minimum, coding's just a hobby for me =P I'm never very &gt; &gt;

        very simply, 17 lines I believe. I don't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe this is
        fully WCA compliant, but it does not include repeats &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like U
        U', and it cancels out stuff like U D U2. The only reason &gt; I am &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; not sure is because it will also cancel out stuff like U F U2,
        which &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is legal. This will be fixed in the next version, but it
        will be &gt; a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lines longer. Here is my code, I will explain
        its usage at the end. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :Input C &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :DelVar ADelVar

        :Str2+" -&gt;Str2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :End &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notes about my code: &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; - I use -&gt; to represent Sto&gt; (store) found above ON. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - No
        changes need to be made to this code. Yes, it looks odd, but it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        works exactly as presented. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - This program uses only 6
        variables: A, B, C, I, Str1, and Str2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - When entering this code,
        you do not have to enter the : before &gt; each &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Usage of this program: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After entering this program and running
        it, you will be prompted &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a question mark. Enter the
        length of the scramble you want. The &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; program will run, (note: it
        will take longer depending on the length &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the scramble). When
        the program displays Done, press VARS, 7 (or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scroll down to
        String), 2 (or Str2), then press Enter twice. The &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scramble will
        be displayed. You can scroll left and right with the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arrow keys.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll be working on a full "jnetcube

        the message. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You had five "'"s, on
        the calculator they are spaced, and why &gt; five? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You
        had a "-" sign there somewhere. Is that a negative or a &gt;
        minus? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And there was a "lbl t" in the

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks a lot! I've been needing a portable scrambler for
        &gt; almost a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year. I'll use this one until someone makes
        a really awesome &gt; &gt; &gt; one with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lots of features. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, I borrowed my sister's TI-83 and ported over
        the &gt; scrambling &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithm generator from my TI-89 cube
        timer program. It's &gt; &gt; &gt; kind of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long, but I tested
        it and it works on hers. I'll post the &gt; &gt; &gt; code here &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; so if you (or anyone) feels like typing it in you &gt; certainly may. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notes: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The program is not 100% wca
        compliant because each turn is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a
        layer orthogonal to the layer the previous twist: example &gt; &gt; &gt; - You &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will never see B B' but nor will you see B F2 . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The scrambles are of random length between 20 and 27
        twists &gt; &gt; long. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When programming, I will
        use "-&gt;" to denote the "sto" button. &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is important to utilize the built in calculator commands &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; typing them out: example - Instead of
        typing "IF" hit "prgm" &gt; &gt; then &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scroll
        to "If" and press "enter" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Anything after a "//" should not be typed it's just &gt; &gt;
        &gt; information I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Every time you hit "Enter" it automatically adds the
        ":" It &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter if your line of
        code wraps past the edge of the screen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And
        please all you professional coders, keep the criticism &gt; to a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; minimum, coding's just a hobby for me =P I'm never very &gt;
        &gt; &gt; elegant nor &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; efficient! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    I know you got it working, but I'll clarify it for others, just in
        case. 1. Any time you see "=0" it's a zero, any time you
        see a "-&gt;O" it's an upper case letter oh. 2.The
        "'" is &lt;quote&gt;&lt;apostrophe&gt;&lt;quote&gt; 3. I believe
        all "-"'s are minus signs, not negative signs. 4. You are
        correct, "Lbl t" should probably "Lbl T" though
        I'm not sure how finicky the 83 is about case sensitivity. Hope
        that helps, and glad you found the program useful. -Daniel --- In

    Selling my cube collection. So i think I'll do it auction form...

        have: 1 5x5x5 Cube from mefferts.com, tiles instead of stickers,
        flawless condtion 1 4x4x4 cube from the 80s of course, pretty good
        condition, moves smoothly 1 2x2x2 EASTSHEEN cube! extremely slick,
        capable of super-fast times 1 2x2x2 (kindof broken) rubik's brand
        cube, very stiff 2 pyraminx puzzles, very fun 1 Alexanders Star,
        freaking hard, pretty stiff too and for the 3x3x3 cubes: I have 5 for
        sale (might be able to find some more laying around) conditions: 2 are
        of decent quality, but hardly speed cubes 2 are excellent speedcubes
        that i have reached very fast times on 1 is really old and not name
        brand and pretty darn stiff The stickers on these 5 are mildly worn, on
        some of them i removed the a side so it is just black. If you do the
        math on this it is probably around 200 dollars worth of cubes but
        we'll see where we get, if anywhere at all! By the way, i live in
        San Clemente and dont know if anyone is local, otherwise ill ship them
        and charge the actual cost of shipping. So, anyone care to start the

    I was at the Berkeley competition and we were trying to figure out who
        had the better cubes: Northern California, or Southern California. And
        well, we might as well settle this once and for all? I'm not sure
        about a format, but I'm sure we can figure something out. So,
        eligibility. Pretty much any California is eligible for this. If you
        aren't a California, but you happen to be in California, we
        probably won't complain too much. I'm basically giving
        Southern California Leyan and Macky. (I still think it'll be
        close...) In terms of picking teams, Chris Dzoan, a Fremont native in
        Irvine can elect to represent Northern California (by the way, this
        would be an online competition) and Darren Kwong, an Alhambra native,
        can elect to represent Southern California. Not sure what the events
        will be right now, but probably 3x3x3 speed solve, one-handed speed
        solve, and blindfold solve. In terms of format, here's one
        proposition. Each event, you elect a certain number of people, perhaps 3
        or 5. They get ranked (probably according to competition results) and
        then number 1 from the north faces off against the number 1 from the
        south. Limitation... perhaps each person is only allowed to compete in 1
        event, or maybe 2... Anyway, just throwing the idea out to see
        who's interested. By the way, if the rest of the world wants to
        challenge California, here's the lineup I'm submitting if each
        event is three people deep: 3x3x3 Speed Solve 1. Shotaro Makisumi 2.
        Darren Kwong 3. Toby Mao 3x3x3 One-Handed Speed Solve 1. Ryan Patricio
        2. Dan Dzoan 3. Chris Dzoan 3x3x3 Blindfold Solve 1. Leyan Lo 2. Tyson
        Mao 3. Chris Kreuger -Tyson

    Gaï¿½tan, what do you want? I mean, what's your problem with us?
        Why do you keep flooding here with your stuff noone cares about (if even
        understands). Your videos are lame, I don't even get the point (is
        there a point a all?). Everyone knows you're a cheater with your
        behind-your-back "trick" (and if you aren't, please prove
        so, come to the next competition, and I'll pay your plane ticket if
        you can solve the cube blindfolded in twice the time you claim you can
        do). If you want us to admit you're the best and first and
        whatever, then fine: woah, Gaï¿½tan you're THE MAN, now quit
        bothering us. I don't even want to hear a single word from you
        again, go write your book about yourself et ferme ta putain de gueule.
        BTW, do you have the rights to modify this movie? my god, how can even
        do such a bad thing out of such great movies? Sorry guys, but I was
        pissed off, had to do something about it. F. Alien Stranger wrote: &gt; &gt; &gt;

        collection of puzzles! Lot of 11 Selling my cube collection. So i think
        I'll do it auction form... Anyways i dont really know what i'm
        doing. Heres the list of what i have: 1 5x5x5 Cube from mefferts.com,
        tiles instead of stickers, flawless condtion 1 4x4x4 cube from the 80s
        of course, pretty good condition, moves smoothly 1 2x2x2 EASTSHEEN cube!
        extremely slick, capable of super-fast times 1 2x2x2 (kindof broken)
        rubik's brand cube, very stiff 2 pyraminx puzzles, very fun 1
        Alexanders Star, freaking hard, pretty stiff too and for the 3x3x3
        cubes: I have 5 for sale (might be able to find some more laying around)
        conditions: 2 are of decent quality, but hardly speed cubes 2 are
        excellent speedcubes that i have reached very fast times on 1 is really
        old and not name brand and pretty darn stiff The stickers on these 5 are
        mildly worn, on some of them i removed the a side so it is just black.
        If you do the math on this it is probably around 200 dollars worth of
        cubes but we'll see where we get, if anywhere at all! By the way, i
        live in San Clemente and dont know if anyone is local, otherwise ill
        ship them and charge the actual cost of shipping. So, anyone care to
        start the bidding?

    Sounds like an interesting idea, except maybe if we did some events that
        aren't run by the California area...say big cubes, magic, megaminx,
        basically other puzzles...not just the standard cube, because California
        tends to specialize in the 3x3, and the rest of the world in other
        puzzles, at least that's the view it seems like to me...You guys
        could do East coast US vs. West Coast US, or just East and West of North
        America, or Americas vs. Everyone else...Americas vs. Everyone else
        would settle the dispute that was going on after US Nationals, and
        before Euros...I dunno, just throwing ideas around. Craig --- In

        figure out who &gt; had the better cubes: Northern California, or Southern
        California. And &gt; well, we might as well settle this once and for all?
        I'm not sure &gt; about a format, but I'm sure we can figure
        something out. &gt; &gt; So, eligibility. Pretty much any California is
        eligible for this. If &gt; you aren't a California, but you happen to
        be in California, we &gt; probably won't complain too much. I'm
        basically giving Southern &gt; California Leyan and Macky. (I still think
        it'll be close...) &gt; &gt; In terms of picking teams, Chris Dzoan, a
        Fremont native in Irvine can &gt; elect to represent Northern California
        (by the way, this would be an &gt; online competition) and Darren Kwong, an
        Alhambra native, can elect to &gt; represent Southern California. &gt; &gt; Not
        sure what the events will be right now, but probably 3x3x3 speed &gt;
        solve, one-handed speed solve, and blindfold solve. In terms of &gt;
        format, here's one proposition. Each event, you elect a certain
        number &gt; of people, perhaps 3 or 5. They get ranked (probably according
        to &gt; competition results) and then number 1 from the north faces off
        against &gt; the number 1 from the south. Limitation... perhaps each person
        is only &gt; allowed to compete in 1 event, or maybe 2... &gt; &gt; Anyway, just
        throwing the idea out to see who's interested. By the &gt; way, if the
        rest of the world wants to challenge California, here's the &gt;
        lineup I'm submitting if each event is three people deep: &gt; &gt; 3x3x3
        Speed Solve &gt; 1. Shotaro Makisumi &gt; 2. Darren Kwong &gt; 3. Toby Mao &gt; &gt;
        3x3x3 One-Handed Speed Solve &gt; 1. Ryan Patricio &gt; 2. Dan Dzoan &gt; 3.
        Chris Dzoan &gt; &gt; 3x3x3 Blindfold Solve &gt; 1. Leyan Lo &gt; 2. Tyson Mao &gt; 3.

        automatically adds the ":" It doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; matter if
        your line of code wraps past the edge of the screen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And
        please all you professional coders, keep the criticism to a &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Aaahh... Completely missed like 5 messages there. Sorry about that.
        I've been trying to think of other ways to add to this program.
        I'd like to get higher order cubes supported, but displaying a full
        3x3x3 scramble takes up nearly the whole screen. I was thinking about
        making the whole alg scroll up Star Wars-style after a set delay period

        because each turn is &gt; necessarily &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a layer orthogonal to the
        layer the previous twist: example - You &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will never see B B'
        but nor will you see B F2 . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The scrambles are of random
        length between 20 and 27 twists long. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When programming,
        I will use "-&gt;" to denote the "sto" button. Also, &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; it is important to utilize the built in calculator commands &gt;
        instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; typing them out: example - Instead of typing
        "IF" hit "prgm" then &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scroll to
        "If" and press "enter" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anything
        after a "//" should not be typed it's just information
        I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every time you hit
        "Enter" it automatically adds the ":" It
        doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter if your line of code wraps past the edge of
        the screen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And please all you professional coders, keep
        the criticism to a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minimum, coding's just a hobby for me =P
        I'm never very elegant nor &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; efficient! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Without further ado: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hit "prgm" then "new"
        and press "enter" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Title your program, I use
        "qb" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :ClrHome // found under
        "catalog" (2nd then 0) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :iPart(rand6)-&gt;M //iPart is

        I'll do it auction form... &gt; Anyways i dont really know what
        i'm doing. Heres the list of what i have: &gt; &gt; 1 5x5x5 Cube from
        mefferts.com, tiles instead of stickers, flawless &gt; condtion &gt; 1 4x4x4
        cube from the 80s of course, pretty good condition, moves smoothly &gt; 1
        2x2x2 EASTSHEEN cube! extremely slick, capable of super-fast times &gt; 1
        2x2x2 (kindof broken) rubik's brand cube, very stiff &gt; 2 pyraminx
        puzzles, very fun &gt; 1 Alexanders Star, freaking hard, pretty stiff too &gt;
        &gt; and for the 3x3x3 cubes: &gt; I have 5 for sale (might be able to find
        some more laying around) &gt; conditions: &gt; 2 are of decent quality, but
        hardly speed cubes &gt; 2 are excellent speedcubes that i have reached very
        fast times on &gt; 1 is really old and not name brand and pretty darn stiff
        &gt; The stickers on these 5 are mildly worn, on some of them i removed the
        &gt; a side so it is just black. &gt; &gt; If you do the math on this it is
        probably around 200 dollars worth of &gt; cubes but we'll see where we
        get, if anywhere at all! &gt; &gt; By the way, i live in San Clemente and dont
        know if anyone is local, &gt; otherwise ill ship them and charge the actual
        cost of shipping. &gt; &gt; So, anyone care to start the bidding? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Hi everyone, The Speedcuber Profiles section is back on
        www.cubestation.co.uk! It's been completely renovated, and is much
        more automatic now, the best feature at the moment is that when you
        add/edit a profile now it immediately appears online! For people who
        never saw the profiles section on the old website, it is a place where
        speedcubers add a bit of information about themselves, so other people
        around the world can see who they are, keep track of contact details,
        best times etc. I hope you can all find 5 minutes in the day to add a
        bit about yourselves, and hopefully the section will grow into a very
        cool database of speedcubing information. I have decided to start from
        scratch, because all of the old profiles were of course way out of date
        :) You can find the speedcuber profiles section here
        http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/index.php?page=profiles/profilelogin Of
        course, if you find any bugs (I've tested pretty thoroughly) then
        please let me know via my contacts page so I can get it fixed! All the
        best, Dan Harris :)

    This is the second post in the last little while depicting the new
        timers as less than ideal for official events. Mike just said there is
        no output for the tournament display and James Stuber said he can start
        it or stop it by touching only the right sensor. Both purchased the
        items from Target in the complete kit, which I understand is the only
        way to purchase a timer now. Surely you must be able to purchase a timer
        with the output present, or the Tournament Display would be rendered
        obsolete. I am guessing these would be available on the speedstack
        website. But will the starting and stopping condition be different, too?
        Does anyone have any insight not this situation? If one needed to
        purchase several timers and displays, how do we ensure we are getting
        the quality required for a competition? -Dave Campbell

        &gt; Of course, if you find any bugs (I've tested pretty thoroughly)
        then &gt; please let me know via my contacts page so I can get it fixed! &gt;

        1 4x4x4 cube from the 80s of course, pretty good condition, moves &gt;
        smoothly &gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 EASTSHEEN cube! extremely slick, capable of
        super-fast times &gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 (kindof broken) rubik's brand cube,
        very stiff &gt; &gt; 2 pyraminx puzzles, very fun &gt; &gt; 1 Alexanders Star,
        freaking hard, pretty stiff too &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and for the 3x3x3 cubes: &gt; &gt; I
        have 5 for sale (might be able to find some more laying around) &gt; &gt;
        conditions: &gt; &gt; 2 are of decent quality, but hardly speed cubes &gt; &gt; 2
        are excellent speedcubes that i have reached very fast times on &gt; &gt; 1 is
        really old and not name brand and pretty darn stiff &gt; &gt; The stickers on
        these 5 are mildly worn, on some of them i removed the &gt; &gt; a side so it
        is just black. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you do the math on this it is probably around
        200 dollars worth of &gt; &gt; cubes but we'll see where we get, if
        anywhere at all! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, i live in San Clemente and dont

        SELLING my collection of puzzles! &gt;&gt; Lot of 11 &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Selling my
        cube collection. So i think I'll do it auction form... &gt;&gt; &gt; Anyways
        i dont really know what i'm doing. Heres the list of what &gt;&gt; i
        have: &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1 5x5x5 Cube from mefferts.com, tiles instead of
        stickers, flawless &gt;&gt; &gt; condtion &gt;&gt; &gt; 1 4x4x4 cube from the 80s of
        course, pretty good condition, moves &gt;&gt; smoothly &gt;&gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 EASTSHEEN
        cube! extremely slick, capable of super-fast times &gt;&gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 (kindof
        broken) rubik's brand cube, very stiff &gt;&gt; &gt; 2 pyraminx puzzles,
        very fun &gt;&gt; &gt; 1 Alexanders Star, freaking hard, pretty stiff too &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; and for the 3x3x3 cubes: &gt;&gt; &gt; I have 5 for sale (might be able to find
        some more laying around) &gt;&gt; &gt; conditions: &gt;&gt; &gt; 2 are of decent quality,
        but hardly speed cubes &gt;&gt; &gt; 2 are excellent speedcubes that i have
        reached very fast times on &gt;&gt; &gt; 1 is really old and not name brand and
        pretty darn stiff &gt;&gt; &gt; The stickers on these 5 are mildly worn, on some
        of them i &gt; removed the &gt;&gt; &gt; a side so it is just black. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If
        you do the math on this it is probably around 200 dollars &gt; worth of &gt;&gt;
        &gt; cubes but we'll see where we get, if anywhere at all! &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        By the way, i live in San Clemente and dont know if anyone is local, &gt;&gt;
        &gt; otherwise ill ship them and charge the actual cost of shipping. &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; So, anyone care to start the bidding? &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;

    I got a Stackmat at Target, too, a couple weeks ago. The timer also did
        not have a way of connecting a tournament display. But it doesn't
        have the problem of starting/stopping using only one sensor. - Bruce ---

    I think it would be nice. Too bad you can't make a smaller font (or

        &gt; &gt; Ok, I borrowed my sister's TI-83 and ported over the scrambling
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithm generator from my TI-89 cube timer program.
        It's &gt; kind of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long, but I tested it and it works on
        hers. I'll post the &gt; code here &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so if you (or anyone)
        feels like typing it in you certainly may. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notes: &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The program is not 100% wca compliant because each turn is &gt; &gt;
        necessarily &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a layer orthogonal to the layer the previous
        twist: example &gt; - You &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will never see B B' but nor will
        you see B F2 . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The scrambles are of random length
        between 20 and 27 twists long. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When programming, I
        will use "-&gt;" to denote the "sto" button. &gt; Also, &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is important to utilize the built in calculator commands &gt; &gt;
        instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; typing them out: example - Instead of typing
        "IF" hit "prgm" then &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scroll to
        "If" and press "enter" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anything
        after a "//" should not be typed it's just &gt; information
        I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every time you hit
        "Enter" it automatically adds the ":" It &gt;
        doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter if your line of code wraps past the edge
        of the screen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And please all you professional
        coders, keep the criticism to a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minimum, coding's just a

    Hi John ! I did 3 french champs 1 world and 1 euro and I've never
        have a lucky cube. I usually have the slowest PLL but only in the Final
        ! :-S When does the lucky change ? Edouard. --- In

        think I'll do it auction &gt; form... &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyways i dont really
        know what i'm doing. Heres the list &gt; of what &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i have: &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 5x5x5 Cube from mefferts.com, tiles instead of
        stickers, &gt; &gt; &gt; flawless &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; condtion &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 4x4x4 cube
        from the 80s of course, pretty good &gt; condition, moves &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; smoothly
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 EASTSHEEN cube! extremely slick, capable of
        super-fast &gt; &gt; &gt; times &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 (kindof broken) rubik's
        brand cube, very stiff &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 pyraminx puzzles, very fun &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt; 1 Alexanders Star, freaking hard, pretty stiff too &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt; and for the 3x3x3 cubes: &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have 5 for sale (might be able
        to find some more laying &gt; around) &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions: &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2
        are of decent quality, but hardly speed cubes &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 are excellent
        speedcubes that i have reached very fast &gt; times on &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 is
        really old and not name brand and pretty darn stiff &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The
        stickers on these 5 are mildly worn, on some of them i &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; removed
        the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a side so it is just black. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you
        do the math on this it is probably around 200 dollars &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; worth of &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; cubes but we'll see where we get, if anywhere at all! &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, i live in San Clemente and dont know if
        anyone is &gt; &gt; &gt; local, &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise ill ship them and charge the
        actual cost of &gt; shipping. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So, anyone care to
        start the bidding? &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;

    Hi there, I recently got a arxon cube, an ideal cube and a 25th
        anniversary cube. I read that those should be suitable for speedcubing.
        i lubed them all with silicon spray (no oil or fat, just silicon!), let
        that dry for some minutes and played with the cube for some hours.. on
        the arxon and ideal, i also adjusted the screw tension (on the
        anniversary, i cant because you cant see the screws when you open the
        caps). but the cubes still kind of suck.. i think the tension of the
        springs is okay after adjusting the screws, but they still dont move
        smoothly. for how long would you say do i have to play with a cube for
        it to go smooth? i had another (very cheap and crappy) cube, i luped it
        and it went totally smooth after a few minutes (but it hat no springs,
        so it sucked for speedcubing). anybody can give me any hints for what to
        do or what i might have done wrong? general tips or especially for
        arxon/ideal/25th, whatever, anything would be appreciated! thanks in
        advance! ps: if you recommend other cubes for speedcubing (like the diy
        i real a lot about), can anybody tell me where to get those in europe
        (especially germany)? i want to avoid high shipping costs from
        rubiks.com

    That's right, I'm not into blindfolded at all (I never
        practice it) but when there's a competition I almost always give it
        a try. I've only been succesfull once out of 10 attempts or so. And
        I also never miss out on the Clock, but before 2006 I never practiced it
        as well causing many DNFs. It's not the sort of record you're
        supposed to be proud of but I like to think it's because I at least
        try competing in events I'm not very good at rather than opt out to
        avoid making a fool of myself :p. LarsV --- In

    Come to think of it, if you display text on the graph, it's MUCH
        smaller than normal text. Omnicalc can add lowercase letter
        functionality to the calculators, so the inner layer turns won't be
        a problem. I think we might be able to fit an entire 4x4x4 scramble onto
        the graph.... --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        right, I'm not into blindfolded at all (I never practice it) but
        when there's a &gt; competition I almost always give it a try.
        I've only been succesfull once out of 10 attempts &gt; or so. And I
        also never miss out on the Clock, but before 2006 I never practiced it
        as well &gt; causing many DNFs. &gt; &gt; It's not the sort of record
        you're supposed to be proud of but I like to think it's
        because I &gt; at least try competing in events I'm not very good at
        rather than opt out to avoid making a &gt; fool of myself :p. &gt; &gt; LarsV Oh
        yes, the clock... you got 10 DNFs each for 3x3bld and clock, 3 for magic
        and one for each of 5x5, minx and master magic. And I agree,
        participating in events you're not good at is still fun. Now I wish
        I hadn't skipped so many events at Euro2006. Like you wrote on your
        site recently, the competition aspect is so much fun and I missed it...
        Btw, I certainly didn't mean to make fun of anyone with that DNF
        list, wouldn't have posted it if I weren't way up there
        myself. My own DNFs: 10 magic, 8 3x3bld, 2 5x5bld, 2 square-1, once each
        for 3x3, master magic and speedblind. General remark: for the
        unsuccessful attempts there might be some mistakes left in the database,
        particularly DNF instead of DNS. For example I didn't actually DNF
        twice at WC2005 in 5x5bld. Only once because I was so slow I had to stop
        my first attempt to continue other events. Also I can of course always
        do mistakes with the stats, so don't take them too seriously.
        Cheers! Stefan

    Mmm, I average above 35 official solves per competition. Not too bad :-)

        that's a lot of sub-20s 3x3x3 solves. I was *almost* part of &gt; this

        of &gt; working on the serious system. I do like these 'safest
        XYZer' stats, &gt; though. Bob leads the master magic one, btw, with
        42/42. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan Haha, yes, I suspected that I should be
        reasonably high up on the 'safest' clock solvers. There often
        seems to be a lot of clock DNFs in competition, but fortunately I
        haven't done this yet! Until last weekend I think I also had a 100%
        solve rate for the Magic. At the UK Open I got my first DNF. At the end
        of the solve, two tiles were elevated *just* over the allowable amount.
        :( Oh well. Other statistics I'd be interested to see are about
        girls in cubing. I was wondering if there are more girls cubing now than
        before. I haven't really seen an increase from the competitions
        I've been to, but I only make it to about 2 competitions a year and
        I know there are so many other competitions happening all over the
        world. Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com/ -- http://www.fastmail.fm

    &gt;From the text-only rankings at speedcubing.com, I was able to get this
        stat: Most common first names. (I disregarded accents, umlauts, and
        other stuff like that) First place is Daniel, with an amazing 19 people
        (Duma, Niemann, Beyer, Hermansson, Hayes, Lo, Bay, Hudson, Wang, Chung,
        Fortuna, Calvo, Russo, Johnsen, Buckley, Lee, Lewandowski, Piper, Hop).
        If you add the Dan's (Harris, Dzoan, Knights, Seal, Posey, Henage),
        you get 25 people! Second place is David at 16 (Bergman, Wesley, Allen,
        Calvo, Tsai, Barr, Skolnik, Pemberton, Aguila, Madnick, Erani, Gomes,
        Matics, Salvia, Kim, Drost), which goes up to 18 if you add Dave
        Campbell and Davey Groen. Tied for third is Thomas (Templier, Bischof,
        Rouault, Le Roux, Kohn, Stadler, Bossmann, Rond, Borsdorf, Schienpflug,
        Rosenberg), Michael (Fung, Atkinson, Grimsley, Swart, Gottlieb, Travis,
        Woodruff, Inadomi, Powers, Chiang, Fischer plus 5 Mike's), and
        Kevin (Lo, Wu, Huang, Jorgensen, Tseng, Brandon, Hu, Chang, Swan,
        Fickling, Liao) at 11 each. And tied for sixth is Kim (Kyung-Ho,
        Nam-Gyun, Beom-Hee, Kyung-Ho, Hyung-Sub, Han-Ear, Young-Dong, Gun,
        Tae-Seop, Chang-Gyun) and Chris (Hardwick, Dzoan, Hunt, Szlatenyi,
        Pelley, Parlette, Tandiono, Joe, DiDamo, Licciardi, and 4 Christophers
        as well) at 10. How about last names? With eight each, Chang, Chen, Lee,
        and Wang lead the way, followed by Huang and Suzuki at 5 each. 32 names
        have been both a last name and a first name: Allen, Antonio, Brandon,
        Christian, Fernando, Grant, Hanson, Ho, Howard, Idekawa, Jang, Joe, Jun,
        Kang, Kim, Lee, Lucas, Luis, Lukasz, Manuel, Maria, Martin, Mary, Mu,
        Park, Song, Tomotsugu, Travis, Wesley, Wu, Yamamoto, Yi This was done

        From the text-only rankings at speedcubing.com, I was able to get this
        stat: Most common first names. (I disregarded accents, umlauts, and
        other stuff like that) First place is Daniel, with an amazing 19 people
        (Duma, Niemann, Beyer, Hermansson, Hayes, Lo, Bay, Hudson, Wang, Chung,
        Fortuna, Calvo, Russo, Johnsen, Buckley, Lee, Lewandowski, Piper, Hop).
        If you add the Dan's (Harris, Dzoan, Knights, Seal, Posey, Henage),
        you get 25 people! Second place is David at 16 (Bergman, Wesley, Allen,
        Calvo, Tsai, Barr, Skolnik, Pemberton, Aguila, Madnick, Erani, Gomes,
        Matics, Salvia, Kim, Drost), which goes up to 18 if you add Dave
        Campbell and Davey Groen. Tied for third is Thomas (Templier, Bischof,
        Rouault, Le Roux, Kohn, Stadler, Bossmann, Rond, Borsdorf, Schienpflug,
        Rosenberg), Michael (Fung, Atkinson, Grimsley, Swart, Gottlieb, Travis,
        Woodruff, Inadomi, Powers, Chiang, Fischer plus 5 Mike's), and
        Kevin (Lo, Wu, Huang, Jorgensen, Tseng, Brandon, Hu, Chang, Swan,
        Fickling, Liao) at 11 each. And tied for sixth is Kim (Kyung-Ho,
        Nam-Gyun, Beom-Hee, Kyung-Ho, Hyung-Sub, Han-Ear, Young-Dong, Gun,
        Tae-Seop, Chang-Gyun) and Chris (Hardwick, Dzoan, Hunt, Szlatenyi,
        Pelley, Parlette, Tandiono, Joe, DiDamo, Licciardi, and 4 Christophers
        as well) at 10. How about last names? With eight each, Chang, Chen, Lee,
        and Wang lead the way, followed by Huang and Suzuki at 5 each. 32 names
        have been both a last name and a first name: Allen, Antonio, Brandon,
        Christian, Fernando, Grant, Hanson, Ho, Howard, Idekawa, Jang, Joe, Jun,
        Kang, Kim, Lee, Lucas, Luis, Lukasz, Manuel, Maria, Martin, Mary, Mu,
        Park, Song, Tomotsugu, Travis, Wesley, Wu, Yamamoto, Yi This was done

    Hello, Dan: I don't believe Harris has ever competed, thus I did
        miss him as he was not on the rankings. If the database were used for
        this, Harris would not be found as Harris Chan wouldn't be in the
        database. Ron: In the rankings, they're listed as, for instance,
        Kim Kyung-Ho, so I just took Kim as the first name without a thought.
        Stefan: Whoops, I knew I'd miss one. --Tim --- In

        tournaments, but I haven't received a response. They don't
        have it on their websites. I'm guessing the one handed problem
        probably has something to do with a short on the left side so the left
        side is always "held". I would think the elimination of the
        data port is one reason why it's cheaper. It could also be that it
        seems like it's now marketed by "Jakks", which I believe
        is a bigger toy company.

    I looked on the SpeedStacks web site, and timers seem to be only
        available by getting a "pack." There are StackPacks, the packs
        that are available in stores, and they claim the timers supplied in
        those packs can not be used with tournament displays. The other pack
        available is a "Sport Pack." They come with a timer compatible
        with tournament displays, but have a starting price of a whopping 260 US
        dollars. They are not available via web; only phone, fax, or mail. It
        seems rather outrageous to me that this is the only way to get a
        tournament display-compatible timer. Wishful thinking: Maybe they could
        come out with a new timer designed to be connected to a computer. It
        seems to me this ought to be a requirement for the next version - it
        would be very nice both for home use and tournament use. - Bruce --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Selling my cube collection. So i think
        I'll do it auction &gt; &gt; form... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyways i dont really
        know what i'm doing. Heres the list &gt; &gt; of what &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i have:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 5x5x5 Cube from mefferts.com, tiles instead
        of stickers, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flawless &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; condtion &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 4x4x4
        cube from the 80s of course, pretty good &gt; &gt; condition, moves &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        smoothly &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 EASTSHEEN cube! extremely slick, capable
        of &gt; super-fast &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 (kindof broken)
        rubik's brand cube, very stiff &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 pyraminx puzzles,
        very fun &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 Alexanders Star, freaking hard, pretty stiff too
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and for the 3x3x3 cubes: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have 5
        for sale (might be able to find some more laying &gt; &gt; around) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt; conditions: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 are of decent quality, but hardly speed
        cubes &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 are excellent speedcubes that i have reached very
        fast &gt; &gt; times on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 is really old and not name brand and
        pretty darn stiff &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The stickers on these 5 are mildly worn,
        on some of them i &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; removed the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a side so it is just
        black. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you do the math on this it is
        probably around 200 dollars &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; worth of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; cubes but
        we'll see where we get, if anywhere at all! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt; By the way, i live in San Clemente and dont know if &gt; anyone is &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; local, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise ill ship them and charge the actual cost
        of &gt; &gt; shipping. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So, anyone care to start the

    Im sure this question has been asked like billions of times, but hey why
        not another time. I just got back into speedcubing maybe 2 months ago?
        My times are averaging right around 30seconds. I use f2l with a 3look
        ll, except for when theres only a dot on the LL then I learned lik all
        the 8OLL algos for it. Anyways, my question is, are there any tips for
        practicing F2L? I mean otehr than looking ahead. and more importantly,
        how exactly do you guys get better at looking ahead? Right now I jus
        keep on practicing and practicing, but Ive kinda hit a barrier at right
        around high 20s. Also, is it about time for me to learn OLL? Honestly, I
        really dont want to learn 57 new algorithms &gt;_&lt;. And I feel that the
        recognition time will increase alot more from my 3look LL. I guess what
        Im trying to ask is would it be better for me to work more on my
        cross+F2L, or to work on learning OLL. Thanks ahead of time, -Richard
        Zou

    I used the Unofficial 3x3x3 averages, not Official. I got the methods
        because I knew what people used which method for the most part (most
        people do I think). Official 3x3 average 2006: 1-12 - Fridrich 13 -
        Petrus 14-20 - Fridrich 21 - LBL supposedly 22 - Fridrich 23 - Roux
        24-43 - Fridrich 44 - ZZ method (not sure if he used it for this
        competition) 45-78 - Fridrich 79 - Petrus 80-95 - Fridrich 96 - His own
        method (not sure if it was used in that competition) 97-100 - Fridrich
        Some of the Fridrich users I'm unsure about. --- In

        mention what method &gt; &gt; they use. &gt; &gt; What basis did you use for this?
        It can't be the 3x3 Average (or at &gt; least not the current version
        on speedcubing.com) as 16 is Toby Mao, &gt; and I had thought he used
        Fridrich. So which ranking did you take &gt; these from, and how did you

        one. I used rubik's cube and removed the colored stickers and

    One of my campers at EPGY had one and she let me play with it. It's
        hard mainly because you can't tell at a glance what you've
        done already and what you have left to do, since all the stickers are

    I remember these being discussed a while back... You can find all sorts
        of sudoku cubes these days in the shops, catalogues, etc etc. We had the
        idea of a 4x4x4 sudoku cube, where all the faces would have 1 to 16, and
        also each of the stickers around a horizontal or vertical layer would be
        1 to 16. I've no idea how to come up with a possible design for the
        puzzle, does anyone have a program that could generate the design for
        this puzzle, and also how many possible puzzles are there? Dan :) --- In

    Well, the patenting process takes a long time and costs quite a bit of
        money (especially for a worldwide protection as you can see the multiple
        applications in different patent offices at the right of the page). If
        they do that, it is surely for a good reason. What do you think about
        the US Patent delaying the distribution of these cubes ? Does this look
        logical to you or do you find any other good reason ? Gilles 2006/11/28,
        pjgat09 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;: &gt; &gt; WOW!! &gt; &gt; That is turely
        amazing, they have the designs for each of the cubes &gt; already complete.
        I am in total shock. I suppose someone with more &gt; know-how than me
        could make these. &gt; &gt; I can't wait for Olympic cubes to start mass
        producing their cubes &gt; (are they ever going to?) &gt; &gt; -Peter Greenwood &gt;

        think I'll do it auction &gt; &gt; &gt; form... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyways i
        dont really know what i'm doing. Heres the list &gt; &gt; &gt; of what &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i have: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 5x5x5 Cube from
        mefferts.com, tiles instead of stickers, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flawless &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt; condtion &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 4x4x4 cube from the 80s of course, pretty
        good &gt; &gt; &gt; condition, moves &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; smoothly &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2
        EASTSHEEN cube! extremely slick, capable of &gt; &gt; super-fast &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        times &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 2x2x2 (kindof broken) rubik's brand cube,
        very stiff &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 pyraminx puzzles, very fun &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1
        Alexanders Star, freaking hard, pretty stiff too &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and for the 3x3x3 cubes: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have 5 for sale (might
        be able to find some more laying &gt; &gt; &gt; around) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        conditions: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 are of decent quality, but hardly speed
        cubes &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 are excellent speedcubes that i have reached very
        fast &gt; &gt; &gt; times on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 is really old and not name brand
        and pretty darn stiff &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The stickers on these 5 are mildly
        worn, on some of them i &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; removed the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a side so
        it is just black. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you do the math on
        this it is probably around 200 &gt; dollars &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; worth of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt; cubes but we'll see where we get, if anywhere at all! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, i live in San Clemente and dont know
        if &gt; &gt; anyone is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; local, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise ill ship them
        and charge the actual cost of &gt; &gt; &gt; shipping. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt; So, anyone care to start the bidding? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;

    Pedro, you don't need a guide, it's easy to assemble a
        Rubik's 4x4x4 without one. Start by putting in the four bottom
        layer centres and then bulid that layer compleatly. After that you put
        in the middle layers, centres first, then edges. Finnaly you do the top
        layer, centres first again and then finnish it of the same way as the
        3x3x3 by turning the layer 45 degrees and then putting in the last edge.
        Do the reverse to diassemble. // Kenneth --- In

        18 months after it has been filed at the USPTO. Also, applying for a

    Hello all, In our institute, we have a very big technical festival each
        year, and this year the managers have approached me to hold an informal
        workshop on rubik's cube. The time alloted will be about 1hr for
        the whole thing. The main aim is to get ppl interested in cubing. So i
        am asking for your help here, what do you think i should talk for the 1
        hr? Mostly ppl who are intrigued by the cube will be attending and my
        goal is to get them interested enuf so that they also start cubing.
        Surely teaching them how to solve the cube in 1hr is not feasible, so i
        am thinking that i;ll teach them how to read algorithms and then give
        them some one page handout that they could try after the workshop.
        Please pour in ideas, its good for the whole cubing community after all!

    Why not just teach them the first layer or first two layers? Teach them
        some subset of the solution, whatever you can in an hour. Then people
        will surely be interested because they'll want to learn how to
        finish the cube. Also, if they can accomplish something, they'll
        feel a sense of fulfillment. -Tyson On Nov 29, 2006, at 5:48 AM, Sachin

    That's odd, I just downloaded it from the files section and it ran
        fine on mine. A few things to try: It shouldn't make a difference,
        but I run AMS 2.05 on a hardware 1 calculator (the Titanium is HW2
        I'm pretty sure), to check your AMS version hit home-&gt;f1-&gt;Shift-&gt;=
        , it should tell you. Also, try opening the file manager
        (2nd-&gt;subtraction symbol) and unlocking the program (highlight it then
        hit f1-&gt;7) Then when you run it, it should give you the error and the
        option of Exit, or goto. Choose goto and let me know which line in the
        program it sends you to. Just reproducing it here should be enough. You
        might also try clearing your variables (either from the file manager or
        the clean up function on the home screen). Just make sure you don't
        have anything important saved under a variable first! Let me know what
        that 2nd step gives you and which ams version you're running.

        when the program is working you'll likely need to tweak the line
        that reads: 1.42+tenth-&gt;tenth in order to get the timer right. I would
        imagine the titanium is faster and thus would require a lower increment.
        I'll keep trying, good luck! -Daniel . [Non-text portions of this

    Hey Anthony, You are actually "unarchiving variable". so in

    I purchased 2 rubik's brand 3x3 last saturday at Target, and opened
        them last night. One of the cubes was so horrible that it barely turned.
        Furthermore, after I came to the obvious conclusion that I would take it
        apart and lube it, I found out that this cube was so tight that it could
        barely be taken apart. I did get it apart, and I did lube it... but then
        I spent over an hour trying to get it back together (getting the last
        piece in). I have disassembled/reassembled cubes many times before, of
        coure, but nothing like this. In the end, the piece in question ended up
        BREAKING, and now I no longer can use that cube (well, it's not
        like I'd have wanted to use such a bad cube anyways). I tried
        emailing Rubik, and they were absolutely zero help to me, saying that I
        need to go back to Target (which I can't now anyways, because
        I'm away at college). I swear, every time you buy a rubik's
        brand cube at a store it is a total toss-up! The two cubes I got were
        completely different.. one of them was alright, but the other was an
        abomination. So inconsistent and infuriating. I think I'll be

    In some shops, they sell the Rubik's Cubes without the packaging
        and just put lots of them into a big pot. Then most customers will play
        a bit with it so that all of them are scrambled. But this is good news
        for us because it means that we can actually try them before purchasing
        it (and they are usually good since lots of people have used it before
        you). (There is one shop like this very close to the venue of the next

        Well, I sincerely hope he'd have experienced this scenario at least
        a dozen times to call for a boycott on Rubik's brand products.
        After all, this is the product that has made our sport possible in the
        first place. I, myself, have never had a bad cube, but I don't buy
        store bought cubes for speedcubing because of the risk factor, and the
        time required to get it into competition condition. I only use DIY kits,
        and I always have a stock on hand for those occasions when the
        Rubik's shop is out of stock. It just seems logical if you are
        serious about cubing. The cost of equipment for this sport is very
        minimal. Think of other sports or activities that would cost much more
        to participate (football, hockey, etc). Furthermore, you must be
        resourceful in this sport. Save every piece that is not broken. If you
        encounter the situation where you cannot get the cube apart as it is so
        tight, the problem lies with the kernel. If you have an old cube that is
        too loose or something is wrong with it, swap out your old kernel and
        put it with new pieces. I have done this several times and the result is
        always very positive. In my eyes, if you buy a cube from the store, you
        are buying pieces to build a speedcube, you are not buying a sub-12 cube
        out of the box. I will continue to purchase Rubik's products
        myself, but I am sorry to hear about the bad experience. -Dave Campbell

    Aaron -- You can, of course, use your standard 3x3x3 method and then
        just do the corners. Something like: do first layer, permute second
        layer corners, orient second layer corners. I used to do this and it
        worked just fine. I've now switched to using the first part of the
        "corners first" method called Ortega-Jelinik. I really like
        this method for a 2x2x2, it's very quick with very little
        memorization (I memorized most routines in a day). Here's a link to
        the method: http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html Ortega-Jelinik goes: - do
        one side (don't worry about permutation) - orient opposite side -
        permute everything If I had a decent 2x2x2 (mine's way too loose),
        I think I could probably regularly hit sub-10 seconds with this method
        and a little more practice (US Nationals I averaged 12.86). Your mileage
        may vary. yeff --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    Thanks for the info. I'm sure it will be a great help. I don't
        orient the corners like a lot of other people, so the website will be
        very helpful. Perhaps I should have learned this way first. Oh well.

        of course, use your standard 3x3x3 method and then just do &gt; the
        corners. Something like: do first layer, permute second layer &gt; corners,
        orient second layer corners. I used to do this and it worked &gt; just
        fine. &gt; &gt; I've now switched to using the first part of the
        "corners first" &gt; method called Ortega-Jelinik. I really like
        this method for a 2x2x2, &gt; it's very quick with very little
        memorization (I memorized most &gt; routines in a day). &gt; &gt; Here's a
        link to the method: &gt; &gt; http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html &gt; &gt;
        Ortega-Jelinik goes: &gt; - do one side (don't worry about
        permutation) &gt; - orient opposite side &gt; - permute everything &gt; &gt; If I
        had a decent 2x2x2 (mine's way too loose), I think I could &gt;
        probably regularly hit sub-10 seconds with this method and a little &gt;
        more practice (US Nationals I averaged 12.86). Your mileage may vary. &gt;

    Sorry for the delay, but here is the version of the program I currently
        use. Many of its features do not work, but the feature I use most often,
        the rolling averages, does. As stated before, the program will not work
        on a TI-89 that is not a Titanium without taking all of the time
        functions out of the code. I am currently working on improving the
        program, adding more functions, making the current ones work, etc. so
        expect an update within a week or so. I'll also post an 89 (not
        Titanium) version. http://www.freewebs.com/saratogacubing/cube.89p

        can, of course, use your standard 3x3x3 method and then just do &gt; &gt; the
        corners. Something like: do first layer, permute second layer &gt; &gt;
        corners, orient second layer corners. I used to do this and it &gt; worked
        &gt; &gt; just fine. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've now switched to using the first part of
        the "corners first" &gt; &gt; method called Ortega-Jelinik. I really
        like this method for a &gt; 2x2x2, &gt; &gt; it's very quick with very
        little memorization (I memorized most &gt; &gt; routines in a day). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Here's a link to the method: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ortega-Jelinik goes: &gt; &gt; - do
        one side (don't worry about permutation) &gt; &gt; - orient opposite side
        &gt; &gt; - permute everything &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I had a decent 2x2x2 (mine's
        way too loose), I think I could &gt; &gt; probably regularly hit sub-10
        seconds with this method and a little &gt; &gt; more practice (US Nationals I
        averaged 12.86). Your mileage may &gt; vary. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeff &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---

        to go. Until then check out what we currently have and let us know what

    Hi Matt, everyone, That's exactly the sort of question that should
        be in a Cube FAQ somewhere. And now we have one! I've written a new
        FAQ section on my website, where you can browse Questions and Answers to
        various frequently asked questions. Just go to
        http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/index.php?page=faq/faq to access it. If
        you can't find an answer to your question, then there is the option
        to submit your own question, where it will open to response by anyone
        who knows the answer! You can answer these unanswered questions, or you
        can provide alternative replies to questions that have already been
        answered. As you can see this section will grow and grow, and eventually
        become a great knowledge base for any frequently asked questions to do
        with cubing. If you have a CubeStation Account, there is now an option
        to volunteer yourself as an FAQ Expert. If you set this option to Yes,
        you will receive notifications via email when new questions have been
        asked, and a link to a page where you can post an answer. The default
        for this option is set to No. Please feel free to use and enjoy the
        FAQ's, and contribute where you can. I would appreciate any + or -
        feedback too :) DanH :) --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    Hey all, I was wondering whether anyone can teach me how to make a 4x4x4
        speedcube other than just lubing it. I've recently purchased a
        Rubik's Revenge from Rubiks.com along with the cube lube. I've
        already lubed up the cube but it just seems quite impossible for this
        cube to move as fast as my 3x3x3 speedcube. And today, I guess was
        cubing faster than the cube can handle and one of the center pieces
        broke. Did I buy the wrong type of cube? How should I change the cube so
        that it can be a speedcube? Thanks! ~Aron

    Revenges and Professors are meant for a progressive build. It works

    Does anyone know Andy Tsao's breakdown for that type of solve? His
        memorization time at Berkeley was generally around 60 seconds for the
        3x3x3 BLD. His average OH solve is 47 seconds. Of course, the BLD method
        takes longer than Fridrich or a speed solve method. Though, with OH
        solving for BLD, you won't really have any delays between any of
        the steps or any of the cycles since you can use that extra time it
        takes to do algorithms to think about your next thing. -Tyson On Dec 4,

    Three tips: 1) Play with it a lot. They get better after a while (approx
        1 month) 2) Don't lube it directly, wait a month. 3) Buy Studio,
        not Rubiks. They are just a little better --------- Oorspronkelijk

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey all, &gt; &gt; I was wondering whether anyone can teach
        me how to make a 4x4x4 &gt; speedcube other than just lubing it. I've
        recently purchased a Rubik's &gt; Revenge from Rubiks.com along with
        the cube lube. I've already lubed up &gt; the cube but it just seems
        quite impossible for this cube to move as &gt; fast as my 3x3x3 speedcube.
        And today, I guess was cubing faster than &gt; the cube can handle and one
        of the center pieces broke. &gt; &gt; Did I buy the wrong type of cube? How
        should I change the cube so that &gt; it can be a speedcube? &gt; &gt; Thanks! &gt;
        &gt; ~Aron &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Hey Aron, What I have done for making a nice 4x4 is to use the lube
        syringes that rubiks.com has. I used this stuff at first for my 3x3,4x4
        and 5x5 before I knew about silicon spray.After geting good use of the
        4x4 with that lube then appllied the silicon. All 3 cubes (3x3,4x4,5x5)
        are now my competition cubes and are very nice. MATT

    I think my favorite would be: "UR ALL RETARDED!!! The rubeiks cube
        is nothing more than a puzzle, a group of colors all paired together to
        form one cube. The colors r then scrambled in order to form a PUZZLE!!!!
        It's no phenomenon that this boy can solve this puzzle. Y? B/c
        he's chinese. that's pretty much it. He's studied
        patterns, probably even completed a few himself. Yet, u all seem to
        think he's been blinded, literally, n is using some way to cheat.
        No, he isn't. The blindfold was placed there before so he
        can't see the cube n examine it before the buzzer goes off. So he
        can't tell the pattern at which the puzzle was set. N, ironically,

    After the first answers we got, it has been decided that it's going
        to be a 1-day competition (on the 3rd or 4th). List of events: - 3x3x3
        (at least 2 rounds - average of 5) - 4x4x4 - 5x5x5 - 2x2x2 - 3x3x3
        blindfolded - 3x3x3 one-handed If there's another event you'd

    Oh ok, since it will only be a one-day compeitition, I can say that if
        it happens on the Sunday, I MIGHT compete. But I have my last exam

        the inner two layers. It takes me much more force to turn the inner
        layer than the outer layer. This causes an uneven turn when I try to do
        a double layer turn, leading to the cube getting "stuck". Just
        thought of an idea. Is it wise to sand down the 4x4 core piece so that
        the center pieces would turn better? --- In

    You could try sanding down the in sides some of the center pieces as
        they may not be wide enough for the slots on the ballkernal. But I would

    Ton Dennenbroek used to sell prepared Studio-cubes around 2002/2003. One
        reason he stopped was he actually had wrist/hand injuries from the stiff
        cubes he had to break in. Keep in mind though that breaking in a cube
        yourself also means that it'll adjust itself to your own cubing
        style. This is another reason why cubes from other speedcubers feel
        different from your own cubes. --- In

    I Completely agree on this one. To bad most "Rubiks"-machines
        work exactly the wrong way 1) You have to scramble it and they solve it
        2) You have to break in the cube before they can start solving it. I
        would like a robot that I 1) Give a new (stiff) cube to break it in
        automatically 2) Give a solved cube and get a nicely scrambled one for

    Hello all, I just got my DIY kit in the mail yesterday and I put it
        together. I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice on how to
        set it up properly. Basically what I did was I tightened the screws
        until the pieces stopped popping out. currently this cubes performance
        is no better than the rubik's cube I bought from target (it is
        fairly old and worn in though). Another thing I was wondering was if
        anyone had a clever idea to attach the center caps in a manner that
        makes them easy to remove if necessary. best regards, casen

        cubing loop for a while now, but am getting back into it, and want to be
        able to make cubes that don't suck. David ps -- anyone who read my

    I don't know about the sandpaper, but most kinds of Silicone Spray
        will make your cube sticky at first. I don't know about that brand
        in particular, but what I would recommend is to disassemble the cube,
        spray the parts, wait a few hours for it to dry. Then flip over the
        pieces, spray, and dry again. After a few hours, assemble the cube, play
        with it for a while, then disassemble and let it dry for several hours,
        or overnight. This seems to work the best for me, and for several other
        speedcubers I know. -Alexei --- In

        down the pieces in an attempt to speed up the wear-and-tear process,
        basically because there is no undo method. However, I did just that last
        month, and the result was surprisingly good. In fact, the cube went from
        being a speedcube I was willing to sacrifice to the cube I used in at
        the Rutgers Fall last month (including the one-handed event). Here is
        the website I used as my instruction manual.
        http://www.freespaces.com/jasa86/cube/smooth_cube.htm And as for the
        lube situation, it is usually sticky until it dries completely and is
        worked into the cube. If it is still sticky a few days after application
        and use, something is awry. -Dave Campbell

    Hi cubers, You all know, I am in top-3 and in the finals for the award.
        1). I am there in the finals for my skill to solve a 3*3*3 cube
        blindfolded and fast. 2). Akrit is a 13 year old boy who is doing his
        medicine 2nd year in university. 3). Akash is a 14 year old boy who has
        designed a spaceship model. After many rounds of testing, we 3 were
        selected by judges for finals out of thousands of applicants. We 3
        performed on POGO TV and exhibited our skill and also explained our
        concepts on 29th nov and viewers were asked to vote for their favorite
        kid. Now, we are waiting for the result which will be announced on 10th
        dec in Bombay which is 2000 km away from my home town. If I win or
        loose, that is immaterial. Being part of it is fun. The final prize
        distribution ceremony will be telecast on 17th dec. When I think back -
        where all this cubing has taken me, how many new friends it has given
        me, what a respect and recognition I get where ever I go and above all
        the pleasure I get by simply cubing etc - it is a sweet memory, since
        Ron uncle met me a year back in my place on 17th dec - 2005, exactly a
        year back. Thanks to Ron uncle, Stefan Uncle and whole cubing community
        for inspiring me. J.BERNETT ORLANDO ---------------------------------

    Hey Andy, Your solves must have been really really weird... consider the
        following: 3:33.78 - BLD on Cube Simulator 2:13.65 - BLD with One Hand
        Your average on the Cube Simulator is 12.57 seconds. Your best OH
        average in competition is 47.03 seconds. What in the world happened that
        your OH BLD solve can be *that* must faster than your Cube Simulator BLD
        solve? Is it because of how the program is written? Surely you must be
        quite used to making cube rotations to turn the back face and things
        like that. Dan Dzoan can solve a cube blindfolded right? I'm very
        curious what Dan Dzoan's OH-BLD execution time is. Surely his BLD
        memorization is much slower than yours, but we can measure his execution
        time. He averages about 24 seconds for OH, so we would expect his
        execution to be around twice your speed. -Tyson On Dec 7, 2006, at 5:24

    Hi folks -- Had some questions about the Jan 13 competition in San
        Francisco at the Exploratorium, and thought I'd ask them here
        (rather than caltechrubik's group) since multiple folks might be
        interested in the answers. - It is a one day competition, right? The
        Exploratorium website (http://www.exploratorium.edu/rubiks/) says
        "each day" but I'm guessing that's a typo. It does
        say "Saturday, January 13" at the top. - Will 3x3x3 first
        round be best of three or average of five? - Last year, we had lots of
        3x3x3 competitors (which was great) so we ran out of time for other
        stuff (bummer), leading to an insertion of a time limit for 4x and only
        Frank doing 5x. What's the plan for those events for this year? One
        option might be to use the "European-style" setup where
        everyone does 1-2 runs, then the best 4-8 people finish out an aveage of
        5. As long as we know the plan beforehand (rather than in the middle of
        a solve! :-), I'm sure it will be fine. - Need any help? I'm
        happy to get there early and help out. thanks! yeff

        I taught a Rubik's Cube class after school for 15 3rd-6th graders.

    Andy said he was really taking him time on the computer cube when I
        talked to him on AIM later that day. On a real cube, you can easily tell
        if you did 2 moves by accident, but on the computer cube, it is much
        harder to tell if you hit two keys by accident,instead of the one you
        intended to do. Also, I'm sure the memorization took longer on the
        computer cube, as it is more cumbersome to rotate it around to see the
        other sides of the cube. Oh, and as far as I know, Andy only did one
        successful computer solve, as opposed to several one handed solves.

    Hey everyone, Does replacing every turn in an algorithm with it's
        double turn have any sort of significance? I was looking at this alg R U
        R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'
        but instead I performed it like this r u r' u' r' f r2
        u' r' u' r u r' f' This is equivalent to L B
        D' R' B' R D2 B' L' D' B R D' R'
        and then rotating the cube 90 degrees as y' Anyway I just thought
        it was cool that you could get an interesting pattern (do the turn D
        after the above algorithm to see a cool pattern). Does this qualify as a
        transformation, or is it totally and completely unrelated to the
        original algorithm? I just didn't know if turning like this had any
        sort of significance. Chris P.S. The state reached on the cube after
        doing that D turn I suggested can be reached simply by this commutator:
        R L D2 L' D' B D2 B' D R' so the move created by
        doing all double turns is not the shortest way to setup this case.

    That is a very spify pattern. I don't think there is any
        mathematical significance though. It seems pretty random from what I can
        tell. An obvious consequence is that the "action" (math sense)
        on the corners would be identical. So whatever happens to the corners
        before would happen to the corners after altering a sequence in this
        manner. Different sequences that have the same effect on the cube state,
        should act like an equivalence class since for all intensive purposes
        they are they associate with the same group element. Any
        "transformation" of a sequence that has mathematical
        significance should be a homomorphism on that... In this case I can take
        two algs that do the same thing and transform this way and end up with
        something wildly different and seemingly unrelated. If there is some
        significance, I don't see it. -Doug --- In

    Assuming no stickers are peeled..., if you disassemble a normal 3x3
        rubik's cube and re-assemble it randomly, then there is a 1/12
        chance that it will be solvable. The safest thing to do is assemble it
        into solved state. If you understand the math behind this and the
        constraints that are imposed then it is possible to look at a cube and
        tell if it is solvable. Certain aspects need to be carefully counted up
        to do this check, and it is not a quick check. This is not a
        "dumb" question, it's perfectly legitamate thing to be
        asking, however the answer is pretty well known among cubers. When a
        cuber is in a rush, they may assemble a cube randomly and get it close
        to solved state, and then fiddle with a few pieces by taking them out
        and putting them back so that it will be solvable. -Doug --- In

        cube links came up and was thinking about a bunch of you guys and was
        wondering who is still around and who's still active. I have lost
        touch with the cubing world in the last few years... I have been
        teaching art near indianapolis for three years now and am still actively
        cubing. Last fall I taught a Rubik's Cube class after school for 15
        3rd-6th graders. It was an awesome time! Its amazing what the young mind
        can comprehend! Anyways, if anyone I have once crossed paths with reads
        this, I hope all is well!!! And keep cubing! I think it keeps one sane,

    Hi :-) The 1/12 breaks down like so : 1/2 chance of avoiding
        "position- parity" 1/2 chance of flipping the edges correctly
        and finally 1/3 chance of orienting corners correctly. Multiply these
        probabilities and u get 1/12 :D Yah, these 3 issues are completely
        independent of course ;-) -Per &gt; --- In

    Ok I've seen a few new methods come out, that are working for
        individuals. I was wondering what others thought about this method.
        Cross 3 c/e pairs Insert Last Corner -- Relatively Permuting Opposite LL
        Corners Insert Last Edge -- Orienting LL Edges (this preserves partial
        relative permutation) OLL (this preserves partial relative permutation)
        PLL 9 cases -the 4 ELL, and the ENVY PLLs ... jealous? =P -6/7 OLL cases
        are 2-gen the other swaps opp corners -- the "U OLL" corners
        (preserving relative partial corner permutation. The main problem is the
        E and Z permutations, which I am working on speeding up. I will add this
        method to my site and practice it. I'll release it once I begin
        sub30 averages with it. This has been playing in my mind, I've been
        trying to perfect the concept, this may be it. I've seen two new
        methods developed that has brought the developer to sub 20 and sub 25 in
        the different cases. Later, Daniel Beyer

    My first solve took at least ten or fifteen minutes. After a week, my
        average was around 2, 2+1/2, 3 minutes. I was screaming when I broke two
        minutes. Rory mlundervilleis1 &lt;mlundervilleis1@...&gt; wrote: im just

    Hey all, I was practicing solving on Sunday and was averaging around 26
        or so. All of a sudden, I got a time of 18.82!! I started yelling and
        got my camera to take a picture of the time. I was so HAPPY!!! Rory

    Hey Tyson, So basically since Berkeley I've gotten my OH average
        down to about 36. I started OH BLD cubing the following week, and my
        only successful time was around 4 min, but I did get several 2:40 DNFs.
        I guess the 2:13 was easier than normal, and I had almost no
        hesitations. I'm still insanely inconsistent with OH BLD, as the
        2:13 was around my 5th successful attempt amid dozens of failed ones.
        For BLD simulator, I messed up on a T-perm on my first attempt, so I
        went really slow on my second one. Hope that explains it, Andy

    Last night I dreamt that I was shopping in supermarket which is near
        where I used to live. There was a short woman with short blonde hair,
        quite old, and she had set up a stall selling brand new Deluxe Cubes. I
        picked one up and started playing with it, it turned quite smoothly and
        I remember thinking "Wow, Stefan Pochmann told me it would take
        ages to adjust a Deluxe Cube to get it this smooth!", so I turned
        it for a bit, and the woman was looking at me scornfully as if to say
        "That kid is such a sucker, I bet he doesn't know the first
        thing about Rubik's Cubes". So I bought the cube and walked
        away. I only then noticed that the colours were a bit weird, the orange
        was almost identical to the yellow, and there were two blue sides which
        were almost identical. As I knew this would be no good for speedcubing,
        I went back to the stall and asked the woman if I could change the cube,
        because it was no good for speedcubing. She took quite a nasty tone with
        me, and told me that all the cubes were the same, and that's how
        they were made these days. I knew she was lying (I mean I'm the UK
        #1 and everything), and I noticed that at the bottom of one of the piles
        was a perfect cube, with amazing colours just right for speedcubing. So
        I asked her if I could change it for that one, but she told me that she
        didn't like my attitude and quickly took away the cube before I
        could grab it, and hid it away on the top shelf of the aisle, next to
        some multipacks of crisps. I really felt like saying to this woman
        "Do you know who I am?", but decided that would sound pretty
        ridiculous. Then she told me to "go away and play with this",
        as she handed me a box which had written on the side "For Lars
        Vandenbergh and Dan H". I thought "she doesn't know
        I'm Dan H!" Inside was my worst nightmare, the broken up
        Pyramorphix from Dutch Cube Day that I've never managed to
        reassemble! So I knew I was never going to get that cube. I planned to
        steal it, so I stalked the supermarket, waiting until she had a break
        and moved from the aisle. I walked past once, damn, she was stacking
        some shelves, next time I walked past she was just walking off,
        "brilliant" I thought, "now's my chance!" I
        tried to get the cube, but it was too high up, so I pulled this table
        from somewhere, (which also had a frozen chicken on it), stood on the
        table, and got the cube! But she was on her way back! So I hurriedly got
        down, put the table back, hid the cube under my coat, and made a run for
        it. But as I got to the doorway, the cube fell from my coat and smashed
        all over the floor. Has anyone else dreamt about the cube? What do you
        think it means? Dan :)

    Cool dream! I dont see what the chickens got to do in here though. As
        Freud would say, its probably something about your childhood or
        something sexual? :-p Well, I had this dream once where I was supposedly
        Harry Potter (that was a few days before EC 2006) and I found a position
        on the cube that looked very scrambled but at the same time, every face
        had the same kind of pattern on it, and I was told that only real
        magicians could solve that particular cube. I could solve it, so I guess
        it must mean something. And I remember thinking, woah, no way I lose EC
        with my skills and I did. Oh well. I guess Im not Harry Potter, probably
        more like Ron with my red hair, no way he could solve that cube anyway.
        Thats one point to add to the list: youve been cubing too much if the
        cube has already been the point of a dream. Oh and there was that one
        where I spent all night dreaming of a cube I could never solve, like,
        always get to the PLL, mess it up, start again, and so on. Very
        frustrating indeed. Sounds a lot like Sisyphus, doesnt it? F. De :

    I don't think is would be any faster than F2L OLL PLL. I did come
        up with this one: Cross, 3 F2L pairs. Insert last pair and orientate
        corners top layer. All in once. This last step is 21 (normal PLL) + 21
        (Pll only all corners misoriented) + 42 (2 opposite edges flipped) + 84
        (2 adjacent edges flipped). This is a lot less than ZBLL. Only the step
        where you orientate the corners is slightly longer cause it would be a
        lot cases to do this from every position so I think about first pairing
        up... --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Daniel

    Why make things so complex? So many Fridrich users try to come up with
        ways of reducing their move count by adding steps with more thinking

    First OLL is thoughtless, PLL is thoughtless. Finding opp corners is
        rather thoughtless, and recognizing EO case is rather thougtless.
        Correction, there are 6 cases for the last corner counting mirrors --
        they're 3-4 move each. And 12 cases counting mirrors across the F/B
        plane for the last edge. The last edge is about 10 moves. So ... other
        than that. OLL/PLL is commonplace so I don't know I'll have to
        see what times I can get. Later, Daniel Beyer --- In

    I've had periods of dreams on the recurring cube theme. I would see
        them in a store, and they were either really elaborate cubistic puzzles,
        or they were often cubes of really high complexity. I would count the
        tiles, and they would seem to go on and on, to something on the order of
        a rectangular 8x16x25. Early on I had at least one cube that changed
        shape when I turned it, and ended up looking like a doll. These dreams
        may have been inspired by the likes of the snake puzzle or the octagonal
        barrel. Billy

        People from for example Germany, Norway and Sweden would even accept

    Hi group =) I "invented" a new event I call "Triple
        Sprint". You do three fast events: Pyraminx, Magic and 2x2x2 (any
        order) in relay. The current UWR is 27,34 (not lucky of course) and it
        is done by me (I'm trying to get Gunnar into it but he has not
        replyed yet, expect sub 20 from him if he is intrested). Anyone here
        willing to give it a try?, it's fun and full stress all the way. If
        a number of us tries it, then maybe Ron can put up a new category at
        Speedcubing for the event. // Kenneth

    So, I've tried explaining this to people at school but they
        don't get it. I thought you all might find it interesting. I'm
        waiting to hear back from my top-choice college (i hear tomorrow night
        at 5!!! AHH!) and thus far the only two ways i've found to relax
        myself are a) calculus and b) learning PLL. I, up until 3 days ago, had
        no desire to learn PLL but something clicked in me and over the last
        three days i've covered 11 out of the 21 algorithms, a record of
        algorithm learning for me. I was just wondering if anyone else feels
        that a cube can relieve stress like nothing else, or has any personal
        experience from something like this. ~John H.~ P.S. Thanks to everyone
        for all the helpful posts over the past couple of years i've been
        reading them. I don't post here very often but read every single
        digest email that i get. Thanks to you guys my 5x5 times dropped over 5
        minutes, and the other cubes are coming along. Thanks!

    There also is an existing parallel in terminology: "speed

    None of those steps are thoughtless. &gt;Correction, there are 6 cases for

    Well for me it works like this: Normal Stress (Life stress) Cubing
        relaxes me. Cube stress, magic relaxes me... Magic stress: I'm
        officially screwed. Yah I was talking with Matt the other day, and
        I've talked about it with others before. Cubing takes your mind off
        everything else. You have to focus to do it and get decent times, which,
        if you are cubing you are trying to do, since you always wanna be
        faster...Anyways, cubing clears your mind, and so it makes things seem
        like nothing while you are cubing. When I broke up with my girlfriend a
        couple months ago I just sat and cubed for hours. Sure, once I stopped
        it hit me, but waiting those few hours helped... Cube Stress: At
        competitions when I am stressed out, I just get my magic out and do a
        whole lot of solves. My hands can get really shaky...and magic kinda
        needs hands that are not normal...and so magic will bring my hands back
        to where they are supposed to be...thus I get less stressed. Magic
        Stress: I haven't found anything to help me with this, except
        closing my eyes, breathing a few deep breaths and thinking of my
        girlfriend. Seeing her face smiling at me makes me smile and relax.
        Thats the only thing, and I have to do it before each solve, which, for
        those of you that were at Rutgers fall thats what I was doing in between
        each solve, just stopping and clearing my mind so my hands stopped
        shaking a little... Craig --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    My AP European history final last year was an essay. We had to list what
        we felt were the ten most important events in European history and we
        had to justify it. Sounds easy and it was. The only problem was it was
        long. My teacher was very easy-going and let us talk quietly as long as
        we weren't cheating (trust me, she could tell). My friend, after 90
        minutes was losing focus slowly, along with everyone else in the room.
        It became hard to concentrate and we started to get worried about time.
        my friend solved his cube a few times and went back to his paper and was
        able to finish very quickly after. I followed suit and found it much
        easier to concentrate on my essay. Maybe it has to do with with blood
        circulation as your brain works quickly to solve the cube. Maybe, I
        don't know. Anyway, that's my two cents. Rory giraffeboy13

    Why don't they make small programs like these open source? Do they

    Maybe. I think though it takes a certain kind of person to truly have
        the desire and drive to benefit from the cube as much as we do/might.
        I've definitely heard of juggling workshops though (being a prof.
        juggler myself by technical meaning) and think that there could be
        something in at least introducing a lot of people to the cube. Juggling
        also has a different "tone" too: people believe that with
        enough practice anyone can juggle 3 balls. What most people don't
        know is that with enough practice, anyone can solve a 3x3. I think
        people just assume that only smart people can solve rubik's cubes.
        Who knows though, maybe you're onto something. ~John H.~ --- In

    Same here. I'm an eighth grader, and all my friends are like,
        "U solved it once already, whats the point of doing it again?"
        My best friends mom teaches me physical science, and she know about how
        the cube can be taken apart. I always play with it during class, so she
        took it apart and is giving one piece back each day. Pretty mean. She

    Nice story, thanks for posting. I found this quite astonishing:
        "Although she declined to give specific numbers, Hasbro spokeswoman
        Patricia Riso says sales of the Cube increased 73 percent from 2004 to
        2005, and are expected to increase an additional 80 percent this

    I've had trouble with textured tiles because my fingers are too
        dry. Like, you know, when you have trouble turning the pages of a book
        and need to wet your fingers a little. I think some textured tiles cause
        a similar issue for me. When my fingers aren't as dry (they never
        are at a competition) it's less of or no problem. But maybe
        I'm unusual, at the Spanish Championship 2004 several people even
        used some powder to make their hands less wet and I remember thinking

    Tyson, I just now saw your performance on CNN. The whole setup was
        awesome, they had trailers for your solve throughout the whole show
        beforehand. Sorry about the DNF, but considering your solving conditions
        a) LIVE b) you had to stop AND talk between memorizing and solving, c)
        did I mention LIVE TV?? I thought you did amazing! Also it looked like
        you were off by only 3 edges, and they looked oriented, which
        considering LIVE TV is pretty freakin' amazing. It was awesome
        Tyson, the people I was watching with thought it was extremely
        impressive, and they were non-cubers. And yes I made sure we were all
        watching your solve when I heard about it ;-) Chris P.S. I feel sorry
        for the girl who had to scramble your cube for an hour, when I'm
        sure there exists a 19-20 move sequence that would have put the cube in
        the same state she put it in ;-)

        Tyson, I just now saw your performance on CNN. The whole setup was
        awesome, they had trailers for your solve throughout the whole show
        beforehand. Sorry about the DNF, but considering your solving conditions
        a) LIVE b) you had to stop AND talk between memorizing and solving, c)
        did I mention LIVE TV?? I thought you did amazing! Also it looked like
        you were off by only 3 edges, and they looked oriented, which
        considering LIVE TV is pretty freakin' amazing. It was awesome
        Tyson, the people I was watching with thought it was extremely
        impressive, and they were non-cubers. And yes I made sure we were all
        watching your solve when I heard about it ;-) Chris P.S. I feel sorry
        for the girl who had to scramble your cube for an hour, when I'm
        sure there exists a 19-20 move sequence that would have put the cube in
        the same state she put it in ;-) [Non-text portions of this message have

    The DNF was on the very last algorithm. All I had to do was to switch UL
        -&gt; FR -&gt; DR. Because it's DR, I did "F'" as a setup
        move, and then I was going to use the two-gen algorithm without the
        R2... except I did the wrong one. That was it. The had me do another
        solve immediately after that and they will air it on Monday. -Tyson On

        that is the effect of a mainstream movie starring a Rubik's cube.
        Now if you think the Rubik's cube is popular, compare it to sudoku

    I was wearing those clothes because I had an interview with a local
        television news station that morning. I went to work dressed like that
        :-P Yeah... it was actually kind of tough blindfolding with like, noises
        and music and Anderson Cooper blaring into my right ear. I don't
        think you can see it, but I'm wearing an ear piece. As for the
        girl, I don't know her. She's genuinely a complete stranger. I
        think it was kind of bad that they had an asian girl do the scrambling.
        I don't know what stereotype it reinforces, but after seeing all
        those racist comments on yahoo, it'd be nice to get away from it a
        little bit. As I said, they're going to air me doing a successful
        solve (me not being a complete idiot) on Monday. Hopefully someone can
        capture that as I don't have the equipment (nor do I get the
        channel). Oh and Marcus, she's a bit old for you probably. I
        estimate she's about 26 years old... and she's engaged to the
        person who's running the camera. If you want to meet girls, play
        chess. That's why I play chess. I'm not even kidding. -Tyson

        effect of Will Smith? I like to watch this site to see trends on the
        web, and to check ranking of sites I develop: trends.google. com You can
        actually see the relative amount of searches that are done. Now check
        the trend for the search term "rubik": http://www.google.
        com/trends? q=rubik I guess that is the effect of a mainstream movie
        starring a Rubik's cube. Now if you think the Rubik's cube is
        popular, compare it to sudoku http://www.google. com/trends? q=rubik%2C+
        sudoku Have fun playing with Google's statistics ;-) Michiel

    Hi, I just wanted to say hi after just joining tis group. I have a new
        interesting in the cube.. possessed-like I seached stores for a cube
        yesterday, without luck. My husband found one for me today. I've
        always been really fast at solving one side of the cube, but never
        really tried to work the rest of it.. Just recently realized the side
        pieces have to go in a certain place and match up with the other sides!
        (no, I'm not dumb, just never looked that close I guess) *laugh* I
        read it somewhere recently and had a lightbulb moment that threw me into
        what I think is going to be a new obsession! Anyway, I have seen some
        websites and though they are great... I dont want to 'just do'
        the algs. I try one when I'm stuck and try to watch whats
        happening.. but it seems that when I am focusing on doing an alg. step
        by step, I'm not 'seeing' whats happening. Any tips to
        see and understand what I am doing while I am using an alg for help and
        learning? I'd like to keep it intuitive, I think I'd grow
        bored fast if I felt that I was just repeating algs/steps in my head.

    I think it's best to learn by combining rote memorization with
        understanding. There are a lot of methods you can use, some are more
        intuitive than others. Check out Ryan Heise's site for an intuitive
        approach. To get really fast, I don 't think there's any way
        around memorizing algorithms. F2L algorithms are easier to memorize if
        you understand them; they usually pair up a corner edge pair and then
        insert them together. In my opinion there's not much point in
        trying to understand last layer algorithms. My advice is memorize first,
        understand later. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    A very special woman to me is a cuber. She lost her cube a few months
        ago, and I think she is going through withdrawls. I've played with
        a few of the good ones, and I thought I'd try to find her a new one
        for christmas. So about 3 dozen cubes later, and after pilfering every
        target, k- mart, toy's R us, ETC. that I could find, and all of
        them that I turned out the same. So I thought "there must be more
        than just these 2 brands". I did some searching, lo and behold
        I'm right! there are (course, you all saw that one coming) So now,
        I have very little time left before christmas, the only seller of the
        good cubes on ebay is shipping form the UK, and there is no way in heck
        it would ever get here before the 25'th, let alone with enough time
        to adjust and lubricate it as all of the pages are saying needs to be
        done. Can anyone help me figure out where I can go to pick one up?
        I'm near san antonio texas, but I'll drive 700 miles if I have
        to, and price isn't really the issue. I just need to find one
        before christmas. Now what to do with a few dozen POS cubes...... Thank
        you in advance for any help. It would be greatly appriciated.

    Finally a beginner that isn't lazy and actually wants to do things
        on their own. I congratualate you for that. The Roux method is mostly
        intuitive, not much to memorize. It can be hard but where's the fun
        in something easy? grrroux.free.fr Petrus is intuitive for the first two
        layers. lar5.com Like the last poster said, try out Ryan Heise's
        method. ryanheise.com &gt;To get really fast, I don 't think
        there's any way around &gt;memorizing algorithms. Not true. Most

        pick one up? I'm &gt; near san antonio texas, but I'll drive 700
        miles if I have to, and &gt; price isn't really the issue. I just need
        to find one before &gt; christmas. &gt; &gt; Now what to do with a few dozen POS

    Hello and welcome to the sport of speedcubing! It is quite addicting,
        and becomes a daily activity when you start getting into it, and it is
        not only fun, but good for you. Whenever someone starts learning to
        solve, I always tell them to not really memorize the alg, but try to see
        where the pieces are going. It may be a good idea for you to memorize
        the alg as is, and once you can do it easily without much thinking, try
        watching the pieces, and the alg comes much easier to you. Check out my
        beginners guide here if you haven't yet:
        http://www40.brinkster.com/patjk/beginners.html&lt;http://www40.brinkster.com/patjk/beginners.html&gt;
        Being able to solve it is quite simple, just work at it, and feel free
        to ask if you have questions. Good luck, Patrick ----- Original Message

        Sent: Sunday, December 17, 2006 2:14 PM Subject: [Speed cubing group] a
        newbie, just joined Hi, I just wanted to say hi after just joining tis
        group. I have a new interesting in the cube.. possessed-like I seached
        stores for a cube yesterday, without luck. My husband found one for me
        today. I've always been really fast at solving one side of the
        cube, but never really tried to work the rest of it.. Just recently
        realized the side pieces have to go in a certain place and match up with
        the other sides! (no, I'm not dumb, just never looked that close I
        guess) *laugh* I read it somewhere recently and had a lightbulb moment
        that threw me into what I think is going to be a new obsession! Anyway,
        I have seen some websites and though they are great... I dont want to
        'just do' the algs. I try one when I'm stuck and try to
        watch whats happening.. but it seems that when I am focusing on doing an
        alg. step by step, I'm not 'seeing' whats happening. Any
        tips to see and understand what I am doing while I am using an alg for
        help and learning? I'd like to keep it intuitive, I think I'd
        grow bored fast if I felt that I was just repeating algs/steps in my
        head. Thanks! [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]

    Hmm, well this may be a dumb question, but did you try lubing any of the
        cubes with silicone? I mean, I don't know of any cubes (besides the
        Rubik's DIY cubes and the studio cubes) that are really smooth
        right out of the box. I'm sure with the 3 dozen cubes you have, a
        bunch of them would actually turn pretty well after you add some
        silicone. Also, you said you live in San Antonio? Well, I live in Sugar
        Land (suburb of Houston), I could probably sell you one of my cubes if
        you'd like. Email me personally if you want more info. -Sapan

    It actually reminds me of DDR with a high speed multiplier activated,

    I asked the same question as you for the &lt;R, U, u&gt; group on the 3x3.
        If you say you work on the &lt;R, r, U, u&gt; group on the 4x4, it means
        that you want to solve positions of the cube that have been scrambled
        using only those moves. And of course cube rotations are not allowed.

    All -- &gt;From the article Chris Hardwick posted, and from Tyson's

        cubing resurgence? I decided to give a Rubik's Cube as part of the
        gift exchange at work, and when I was in the mall I saw that the
        Discovery Channel store had *tons* of the 25th Anniversary cubes for
        sale. I've found those are pretty decent cubes once they're
        broken in (even before lubing). So, I grabbed one. While I was browsing
        around the store (like 5-10 minutes) I saw three other people buying
        cubes (one person was buying two). It's well-known at work that
        I'm a cuber, just recently multiple people have told me that they
        or their kids are cubers. I point them all to speedcubing.com and the
        January competition in San Francisco (I live in Sacramento). It'll
        be interesting to see what kind of crowd we have at the January
        competition. yeff

    Hi, and welcome! that little lightbulb moment is good hurdle to get
        over--when i teach newbies, i try to explain that concept by pointing
        out that all the white stickers are not created equal. i'll pull a
        piece out to show that it's attached to the side piece. it's
        definitely critical to get that concept. my tip for learning algs would
        be to try to understand at least a little bit about what they're
        doing, but go by rote memorization because if you have to becuase
        eventually you will understand better. also, i like doing the algs
        slowly at first, and then once i have it down, practicing it like 10 or
        20 times holding the cube under a desk so i'm not looking at it. if
        you do the same alg over and over again, it will come back to the
        original state. Also good practice is practicing the OLL algs with their
        inverse pairs (start with solved cube, do one OLL alg, which sets up a
        different OLL case, then do OLL alg for that case twice (first time
        orients LL, second time sets up the case for the first OLL alg you did),
        then alternate doing each OLL alg 2x). you can learn a lot of the OLL
        algs this way, and it helped me because when first learning those algs
        it was hard for me to set up the cube for the alg i was trying to learn.
        this way, you learn an alg to solve, and an alg to set it up at the same
        time. you want to be able to do the algs without watching the cube so
        that when you actually do the algs you can focus on looking for other
        pieces that you need for the next step. it also just frees your fingers
        to work without waiting for your eyes to catch up. Good luck, and happy
        cubing! --Kirk --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Not sure what to do now, keeping doing the directions over and over
        until I 'see' it or try a different method.. I looked at the
        more intuitive methods, like with making the 2x2 boxes.. that blew my

    Northern California Pre-Qualifying Round Information Northern California
        Pre-Qualifying Round Date: Saturday, January 6, 2007 Time: 10 AM to 4 PM
        Location: Crystal Springs Uplands School, Gryphon Center 400 Uplands
        Drive Hillsborough, CA 94010 Note: The Gryphon Center is the school
        gymnasium. The competition will be in a classroom on the ground level.
        Purpose: The purpose of the pre-qualifying event is so that competitors
        can attempt to qualify for the semi-final and final rounds and avoid the
        rush of the first-round of the competition during the day of the
        competition. The other purpose is also to help facilitate the
        competition. If you can make it to the pre-qualifying round, we ask that
        you do in order to improve the flow of the competition for the Caltech
        Rubik's Cube Club. We are currently working on deciding how to
        advance people. In the past, it has been a certain number of
        competitors. We are considering making benchmark times for semi-final
        and final rounds. -Tyson [Non-text portions of this message have been

    Oh, just saw this reply, thank you! I will try some of these ideas. You
        are right about understanding concepts. I've noticed that a lot of
        the websites with algs. do not explain what you are doing or trying to
        do. That helps me so much, even if its just a little "You are
        trying to get ____ to move to ____ by ___ ___. I guess my mind is a bit
        different than most, I need to understand rather than follow a recipe..
        although I will try the advice given, to do algs until I can see whats
        happening. I am finding that when I work the cube on my own, I move
        things in a way that seems to be different than how algs. do/describe.
        Its hard to explain but.. I tend to twist 2 layers at once, and see
        things that way too (sort of backward from holding the 2 layers still
        and moving one edge). I know that in essence it is the same thing/move,
        but they 'feel' different to me. I am also left-handed, if
        this makes any difference. And I tend to see and do my own moves with
        more of a erm.. slicing type approach.. I tend to turn my 2 layers one
        way and then turn the bottom of those two back.. so its like slicing
        through the center whoa.. sorry for the babbling, not sure if these
        things make sense to anyone but me, but oh well! Thanks again. --- In

        hurdle to get over--when i &gt; teach newbies, i try to explain that
        concept by pointing out that &gt; all the white stickers are not created
        equal. i'll pull a piece out &gt; to show that it's attached to
        the side piece. it's definitely &gt; critical to get that concept. &gt; &gt;
        my tip for learning algs would be to try to understand at least a &gt;
        little bit about what they're doing, but go by rote memorization &gt;
        because if you have to becuase eventually you will understand &gt; better.
        &gt; &gt; also, i like doing the algs slowly at first, and then once i have it
        &gt; down, practicing it like 10 or 20 times holding the cube under a &gt;
        desk so i'm not looking at it. if you do the same alg over and over
        &gt; again, it will come back to the original state. Also good practice &gt;
        is practicing the OLL algs with their inverse pairs (start with &gt; solved
        cube, do one OLL alg, which sets up a different OLL case, &gt; then do OLL
        alg for that case twice (first time orients LL, second &gt; time sets up
        the case for the first OLL alg you did), then alternate &gt; doing each OLL
        alg 2x). you can learn a lot of the OLL algs this &gt; way, and it helped
        me because when first learning those algs it was &gt; hard for me to set up
        the cube for the alg i was trying to learn. &gt; this way, you learn an alg
        to solve, and an alg to set it up at the &gt; same time. you want to be
        able to do the algs without watching the &gt; cube so that when you
        actually do the algs you can focus on looking &gt; for other pieces that
        you need for the next step. it also just &gt; frees your fingers to work
        without waiting for your eyes to catch up. &gt; &gt; Good luck, and happy
        cubing! &gt; --Kirk

        turn the cube 180 degrees so I can do L U2 L' U' L U'

        layer turns are often used to make algs faster to execute, those turns
        are denoted using lower case letters, r does the same as R+M' (M is
        the middle layer). All cubers are using slice turns (M E and S), thing
        is: if you only do those then you will not do anything to the corners,
        only edges and centres moves. // Kenneth

    I'm new to the Square 1 and don't know much about the puzzle
        yet. But one thing I found and that is when you are in star shape at
        start of the solve and is about to transform to a cube, then it matters
        where you split the star if you get an parity error or not. It takes
        just one turn of the star to fix... one turn! (correct me if I'm
        wrong, but my parity alg does cube -&gt; star, turn star once, star -&gt; cube
        so I'm pretty sure =) But I'm totaly confused (because of the
        shape shift) when it comes to recognition... not a single clue. Any
        idéas? Anyone tried this and gave it up? :P // Kenneth

    If you like doing slice moves, and intuitive approaches, I strongly
        recommend using Gilles Roux's method. The first few steps are
        mainly intuitive and he uses a lot of slice moves because he leaves 2 of
        the bottom edges for later, like a working space.

        reply, thank you! I will try some of these ideas. &gt; You are right about
        understanding concepts. I've noticed that a lot &gt; of the websites
        with algs. do not explain what you are doing or &gt; trying to do. That
        helps me so much, even if its just a little "You &gt; are trying to
        get ____ to move to ____ by ___ ___. &gt; &gt; I guess my mind is a bit
        different than most, I need to understand &gt; rather than follow a
        recipe.. although I will try the advice given, &gt; to do algs until I can
        see whats happening. &gt; &gt; I am finding that when I work the cube on my
        own, I move things in a &gt; way that seems to be different than how algs.
        do/describe. Its hard &gt; to explain but.. I tend to twist 2 layers at
        once, and see things &gt; that way too (sort of backward from holding the 2
        layers still and &gt; moving one edge). I know that in essence it is the
        same thing/move, &gt; but they 'feel' different to me. I am also
        left-handed, if this makes &gt; any difference. And I tend to see and do my
        own moves with more of a &gt; erm.. slicing type approach.. I tend to turn
        my 2 layers one way and &gt; then turn the bottom of those two back.. so
        its like slicing through &gt; the center &gt; &gt; whoa.. sorry for the babbling,
        not sure if these things make sense to &gt; anyone but me, but oh well!

        little lightbulb moment is good hurdle to get over--when i &gt; &gt; teach
        newbies, i try to explain that concept by pointing out that &gt; &gt; all the
        white stickers are not created equal. i'll pull a piece &gt; out &gt; &gt;
        to show that it's attached to the side piece. it's definitely
        &gt; &gt; critical to get that concept. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my tip for learning algs would
        be to try to understand at least a &gt; &gt; little bit about what
        they're doing, but go by rote memorization &gt; &gt; because if you have
        to becuase eventually you will understand &gt; &gt; better. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also, i
        like doing the algs slowly at first, and then once i have &gt; it &gt; &gt; down,
        practicing it like 10 or 20 times holding the cube under a &gt; &gt; desk so
        i'm not looking at it. if you do the same alg over and &gt; over &gt; &gt;
        again, it will come back to the original state. Also good practice &gt; &gt;
        is practicing the OLL algs with their inverse pairs (start with &gt; &gt;
        solved cube, do one OLL alg, which sets up a different OLL case, &gt; &gt;
        then do OLL alg for that case twice (first time orients LL, second &gt; &gt;
        time sets up the case for the first OLL alg you did), then &gt; alternate &gt;
        &gt; doing each OLL alg 2x). you can learn a lot of the OLL algs this &gt; &gt;
        way, and it helped me because when first learning those algs it was &gt; &gt;
        hard for me to set up the cube for the alg i was trying to learn. &gt; &gt;
        this way, you learn an alg to solve, and an alg to set it up at the &gt; &gt;
        same time. you want to be able to do the algs without watching the &gt; &gt;
        cube so that when you actually do the algs you can focus on looking &gt; &gt;
        for other pieces that you need for the next step. it also just &gt; &gt; frees
        your fingers to work without waiting for your eyes to catch &gt; up. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Good luck, and happy cubing! &gt; &gt; --Kirk &gt;

    You know, I figured out why Sudoku is so popular. People who can't
        solve a face on a Rubik's Cube can do the Sudoku. Anyone can do the
        Rubik's Cube, sure, but it takes work. For Sudoku, anyone can do
        the Sudoku, and it doesn't even take practice. It takes practice to
        get good, but you don't have to learn anything at all. Rubik's
        Cube has a learning curve. Sudoku doesn't. I was on this airplane
        to New York, and this woman next to me was curious about the cube, so I
        thought I'd try to teach her a bit. She was horrible...
        couldn't put four white edges next to the yellow center.
        Eventually, she gave up... and she pulls out a Sudoku. So there's
        no argument whether or not Sudoku is "better" than
        Rubik's Cube. They're different. One is simply much more
        accessible to the mass population than the other. -Tyson On Dec 19,

    Yes, this pre-qualifying basically acts as a substitute to your first
        round on the day of the competition. It's more of a hassle to you,
        but to the people who can make it, it would be of great assistance to
        the competition and will allow more time for more events. Otherwise, we

    Hey guys, I just joined this group recently. I just learned how to do
        the Rubik's cube several weeks ago using the Layer by Layer
        Beginner's method and was able to achieve a fastest time of 1:14.
        Since then, I have wanted to learn a newer method so that I could
        achieve faster times. I have done some researching on the internet and I
        came across the Fridrich method. How much faster do you think I will be
        able to get if I learn the 4-look Fridrich method (just to help with a
        faster LL solve)? I have tried learning the Fridrich F2L intuitively to
        no avail. Thanks again for all the help.

    By using a Cross + Fridrich F2L + 4-look last layer, you could drop your
        times to the low twenties. However, this would require months of
        training. I am using a Cross + Working Corner (keyhole) + 4 look last
        layer and have a 30.06 12/10 average. Practise is more important than
        the amount of algorithms you know. Only if you want to get really fast
        (sub 20) you need to learn many more algorithms (and also practice a
        lot). --------- Oorspronkelijk bericht -------- Van:

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey guys, I just joined this group recently. &gt; &gt; I
        just learned how to do the Rubik's cube several weeks ago using the
        &gt; Layer by Layer Beginner's method and was able to achieve a
        fastest &gt; time of 1:14. Since then, I have wanted to learn a newer
        method so &gt; that I could achieve faster times. I have done some
        researching on the &gt; internet and I came across the Fridrich method. &gt; &gt;
        How much faster do you think I will be able to get if I learn the &gt;
        4-look Fridrich method (just to help with a faster LL solve)? I have &gt;
        tried learning the Fridrich F2L intuitively to no avail. &gt; &gt; Thanks
        again for all the help. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    i think if youre gonna go for times like sub30, you should at least
        learn 3 look LL (EOLL,COLL,PLL). it will give you a significant boost
        from 4 look while only learning around 30 algos. and recognition isnt
        quite as hard as OLL. plus constant practicing of F2L will get really
        annoying, while learning PLL takes some time and is kinda fun =P.

    Well, since I am fairly new to cubing, I would be happy with sub-minute
        times. (As things stand right now, sub-30 is a big dream for me.) I have
        already learned the 16 or so algorithms for the 4-look Fridrich but was
        wondering what the potential for this method is, both including AND
        excluding Fridrich F2L. Thanks for the tips.

    Hi, I bought a pyraminx in June of this year, but I have not been able
        to use it because one of the vertex pieces containing the screw came
        loose. However, the cap which contains the head of the screw is glued
        very tightly, and I cannot access it. Does anyone know what kind of
        solvent I should use on the glue...or if I should do that at all? In
        addition, how can I remove the barrels which contain a spring and ball?
        I have taken apart the entire puzzle except for three of the vertex
        axes. Thanks Ernest

    learning fridrich f2l cuts down your time so incredibly much if
        you're trying to get under thirty just learning it would probably
        get you there after a while. without f2l, you can definitely get under a
        minute with 4-look and layer by layer. i have a friend who can do it in
        45 seconds on average using those methods, but his turn speed's
        about as fast as mine (pretty fast, i guess, 3-4 turns per second maybe,
        don't know if he pauses a lot). i think when i used a 4-look last
        layer with fridrich's f2l i got around 30, i believe... i might be
        wrong... well anyway, f2l isn't too bad. intuitive approach is
        great, but i think for most ppl (including me) if you just look at a few
        (5, 6, maybe more) of the shorter algorithms and memorize them, then
        work with them a bit you'll see how they work after a while and you
        can basically make the rest of the algorithms yourself. that's how
        it worked for me. of course, as time went on i saw more efficient ways
        of doing the f2l pairs from certain situations, which is why it's
        probably good to check your algorithms against posted ones from time to
        time. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    gaetan you are a nutjob and a jerk. you are a cheater and have been
        busted, everyone knows you're a fake, and can't really do some
        of the things you claim. you wonder why you don't get much
        attention, that's because YOU AREN'T THAT GOOD. maybe back in
        the 80's when you started growing that dead mink on your upper lip,
        you were something special with your mediocre times, but now,
        you're just another hack. if you wish to proove different then
        start using your fingers at a competition instead of at your keyboard.
        just because you are jealous of tyson's opportunites doesn't
        mean you should make fun of him, i would love to see you two in a
        controlled blindfold contest, i have 100$ that says tyson would kick

    I was thinking about this on my way to work, and the entire situation is
        both amusing and sad. On one hand, my e-mail of course is some what
        puerile, but I think I'm allowed to slap some people around evervy
        now and then. But now, examining the situation... If Gaetan really could
        indeed solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded in blazing speed, imagine
        how much press that could generate for him? He was on FOX news before,
        and so he certainly must have contacts. Simply go, tell some news agency
        or someone with the capacity to produce a show that you can beat Tyson
        Mao at solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded. Hollywood and
        televisions love all that type of drama. But anyway, that's besides
        to point. Here are the reasons why no one respects you, and the actions
        you have failed to perform to remove this doubt. First, a solve time of
        30 seconds is ridiculous. It's possible, but not likely. People who
        make claims but don't back them off earn absolutely no respect in
        our world. We all know this, and we all know who the perpetrators are.
        You must somehow demonstrate that you have the knowledge and aptitude to
        solve a cube blindfolded in 30 seconds. If you could explain to use your
        method, maybe we would see that you've put in some effort, and
        actually have some idea of what you're doing. May I remind you of a
        good friend of ours and his amazing "corners first" method
        which produced sub-17 second results back when sub-17 was ridiculous? He
        was never "ready" to release his method, and he never
        explained anything about it. No one believed him, and his excuses for
        never being able to solve added to our speculation. Where is he now?
        He's where you've been for a long time, except he at least did
        a solitary good act for the world of Rubik's Cube. You've done
        nothing. The second item which really kills any credibility you might
        have is the complete lack of sense you have when it comes to writing
        e-mails. Did you take a crack at my mother in this last one? She is a
        very hard working woman and I respect her very much. If we were football
        (soccer) players, you would have earned a headbutt to your chest.
        Originally when I read your e-mails, I gave you the benefit of the doubt
        that somehow there was a language barrier and that English was not a
        strong language for you and perhaps some of the ideas you were trying to
        convey were being misinterpreted because of a French to English
        translation. This, as we have found, is not the case. The latest e-mail
        you've written makes perfect sense to me. It takes me time to
        decode your other e-mails, but you generally have little validity into
        whatever asinine point you have. But anyway, moving right along...
        Third... those videos. What the hell is with those videos? Your latest
        video of me actually made sense. Congratulations, you actually landed a
        punch on me. You must be quite proud of yourself, but this can't
        possibly negate the absolute nonesense which you have shown us in the
        past. What's with bringing out old e-mail conversations? These
        people you are trying to degrade, they deserve to be left alone. They do
        nothing to make your life more difficult. You can mess with me as much
        as you'd like. I have no problem standing here bracing myself
        against whatever attack you can throw my way. In some way, I've
        earned it, because I'll throw punches back at you. But I
        acknowledge this fact. A real man (or woman, to be politically correct),
        stands up for what he believes in, and what he's done, and takes
        responsibility for his actions. Why don't you stand up for
        yourself? If you have as much talent as you try to make us believe, it
        would be such a waste that probably everyone in this forum gives you
        absolutely no respect. Simply explain yourself in a coherent manner, and
        I might even begin to respect you. Clearly, this is an impossible takes
        for you. In any case, here's a parting thought. You were on
        national television way before I was. You solved the Rubik's Cube
        blindfolded faster than I did, and you did it correct on your first try,
        something I failed to do. Why, good sir if you will, have I become known
        on the television circuit, and you have faded into obscurity? I know the
        answer. It extends beyond what you can do with the cube. It is how you
        interact with people. Think about it, and think about where you want
        your life to go. If you can do what you claim to do, you could have
        easily had everything that has come my way, and more. The world thinks
        I'm special. The cubers in this forum know I'm not. I was
        simply lucky, the man with the right skill at the right time. You were
        that person once as well. How many other opportunities in your life have
        disappeared, simply because of who you are? Tyson Mao On 12/22/06,

    I had a similar problem and have not been able to fix it at all. I was
        told that the easiest way to fix it is to buy a new one. I tried so many

        Does anyone know what kind of solvent I should use on the glue...or if I
        should do that at all? In addition, how can I remove the barrels which
        contain a spring and ball? I have taken apart the entire puzzle except
        for three of the vertex axes. Thanks Ernest

    Hey Ryan that blindfolded version is really cool...specially the part
        that it turns grey when you start moving : ) but I had my eyes
        closed...stopped 'cause it's been a long time since I last

    But I mess up very often, mostly because it's hard to get good
        lighting for feetcubing. Again some tips: 1. Try to avoid U-moves (at
        least for me they are difficult), so cross on B may be the best choice.
        Sune: R' F2 R F R' F R U-permutation: R B' R B R B R
        B' R' B' R2 2. Don't use a very loose cube ,because
        stuck turns are horrible. 3. Praacticeeee... I can do all OLL and PLL
        algs with my feet. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

    Hey all, I am cuber with an F2L of about 19sec and and best solve
        average of 28.7sec. I've just got a qestion about F2L and one about
        the Cross and I hope I can explain the questions correcly. 1. F2L When
        you have a pair, your finger know how to put it into its correct slot
        (i.e. Step 1:the pair up and Step 2:the insertion) and you find the next
        pair. When do most sub 20ish cubers decide what moves it will take to
        insert pair 2? Before pair 1 Match up Before pair 1 Insertion After pair
        1 Insertion The reason I ask is that I'm trying to developpe an
        exercise to advance my F2L. An exercice I am trying is I match up pair
        1, line it up to its insertion slot (i.e. U turn) then I STOP until I
        know how to match up the next pair and line it up with it's
        insertion slot perform the match up and line up of pair 2 adn STOP and
        so on. 2. The Cross When Determining moves to complete the cross is it
        OK (if you will) to not have the last section of moves memorized? Can I
        or do most cubers sometimes mentally picture where the location of the
        last cross piece will be only while performing the first 2-3. I think
        that's where I'm lacking, It seems to take a frustratingly
        long time to determine the location of the 4th cross piece will after
        the shuffle of the cube while inserting the first three cross pieces
        therefore I only know how to inserts the last cross piece into its
        location when the first three pieces have been inserted (Though I close
        my eyes for the cross). Thanks Dwayne Sorry about the long paragraphs!

    Some of you may have seen Matt Harding's videos where he travels

        cubing with the 25th anniversary cube. I've learned the beginners
        guide to cubing and im now memorizing the PLL pattern. Also i avrg times
        between 1:00 - 1:25. I was just wondering if im set on the right course
        to learning and if there's any way that i could plan the F2Ls
        better (i can look ahead up to 3 parts of the cross). Thanks in Advance.

    Because corners are closed spaces full of air ==&gt; float Edges are not

    Hi everyone, Hope you all have a great Christmas Day tomorrow, and best
        of luck for the New Year. Thanks to everyone who put in a lot of hard
        work organising tournaments this year, you ensured that the cube is not
        only here to stay but is growing in popularity once again. And
        congratulations to all of you who participated and volunteered in those
        competitions, without you we would not have a cubing scene! See you in
        2007! Dan Harris :)

    It's perfectly feasible to solve it with only algs you discover
        yourself. I did it in a week or two. I'm less convinced you can do
        it without *any* algorithms at all. I suppose it depends on what you
        consider an "algorithm". /Lars On Dec 25, 2006, at 0:09, David

        She's already at 2 and a half minutes, and progressing quickly. She
        is quite good for someone who just started. Anyways, my question is
        this: She told me yesterday that she thought she was getting some
        calasses on her fingers from cubing, but I didn't think it was from
        cubing. Has anyone else ever gotten calasses from cubing??? Thanks,

    Northern California Pre-Qualifying Round Date: Saturday, January 6, 2007
        Time: 1 PM to 5 PM Location: Winnett Center, Caltech Purpose: The
        purpose of the pre-qualifying event is so that competitors can attempt
        to qualify for the semi-final and final rounds and avoid the rush of the
        first-round of the competition during the day of the competition. The
        other purpose is also to help facilitate the competition. If you can
        make it to the pre-qualifying round, we ask that you do in order to
        improve the flow of the competition for the Caltech Rubik's Cube
        Club. ~Daniel Lo

    I have a few of the 2005 cubes I purchased from Target here in the U.S.
        The centers appears to be solid plastic - I cannot figure out a way to
        pry the center caps off, if they exist. Any advice? They are black with
        the curved center pieces. I bought three cubes before I knew you could
        try them and return the good ones. One of them is a rocket without any
        adjustments to the springs. The other two are ridiculously stiff and no
        amount of work removing manufacturing imperfections or siliconing seems
        to help.

    Hello everybody ! I've a new category to submit to the WCA

        on the table, and when you take it, the timer starts. You look at it and
        when you are sure you will succeed in finishing the cube blindfolded,
        you put the cube on the table and stops the timer. The judge looks at
        the scrambled cube and ask you "Are you sure you'll finish it
        blindfolded ?". If you are sure, you answer "yes" and the
        time is saved, if the judge thinks that you don't lie. If he thinks
        you lie, you've done a DNF. We could do avg of 5 in competition, I

        80's section. I tried to catch the clip on tape but was
        unsuccessful. Anyway the clip was only about 10-20 seconds long. First
        they showed my hands close up solving, then they showed a fast forwarded
        (clearly marked with a sub-title) 17 second solve. I wanted to get the
        video up here but I probably goofed the setting on my VCR or something
        so the video didn't capture. Well, cubing is certainly growing in
        the media in my local area because of the Pursuit of Happyness movie and
        all of Tyson's media coverage. I hope this movie has more effect on
        the cubing community in general, because it certainly is putting it in
        the spotlight in my local area. Happy cubing, Chris P.S. Reporters and
        News people no longer ask me those questions "So do you think the
        Rubik's cube is on the comeback?" or "Do you think this
        Rubik's cube revival will last?" or any other variation. They
        now mostly ask me about competitions and records and what competitions
        are coming up next worldwide, etc.. I think that's good, because I
        think they just assume the cube is back now and so they don't ask
        those "comeback" questions any more :-)

    Cool. Yeah, I have noticed many people talk about the cube in the
        Pursuit of Happyness and went out to buy one. Just yesterday I did a
        solve and a BLD solve for about 10 people, and they said they are going

    How about this : You solve a cube without looking at the timer. Then you

    I found the first idea genious. For the second... If the judge is
        blindfolded, the competitor can cheat... So we need a second judge, who

    Why not disqualify the judge for cheating and let the competitor judge
        himself? Blindfolded, of course =) That will save a lot of judges.
        Problem is, how do we know the judge cheated? Well, simply let the
        competitor guess if he did or not. If he guess the judge chaeted then he
        is out (it's not clear if it is the judge or the competitor who is
        out). If the guess is that the judge did not cheat, then the competitor
        is taking the wrong guess (I'm sure) and the judge is definitly
        out! // Kenneth (who is more often the judge than he is the competitor

        second... If the judge is blindfolded, the competitor can &gt; cheat... So
        we need a second judge, who looks at the other judge (if &gt; he
        doesn't cheat) and the competitor. And maybe a third judge who &gt;

        more in Edouard's spirit : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The judge is blindfolded. The

        is solved or not. &gt; &gt; If the judge thinks it is solved, then the time is
        accepted (even if &gt; &gt; the cube is not actually solved). &gt; &gt; If the judge

    i really am sorry if this has been asked before but i want to know what
        (preferably common) stores (i'm in boston) sell a *rubik's*
        cube 2x2x2. i'm giving it as a gift, so i want it to be a
        rubik's cube but i need it in a local store since i don't want
        to pay for shipping/wait for the shipping. does anybody know any stores
        nearby that sell them? i know target has regular rubik's cubes, but
        i'm not sure if they had the 2x2... thanks, tony

    Hey Chris! I'm in the area (chapel hill/carrboro) and i was
        wondering if the raleigh celebration will have a competition. I've
        never entered one before (because a majority are out west or otherwise
        inaccessible) and would really love the opportunity. If there isn't
        going to be one that's cool, i'll probably still end up there
        anyway. I know a couple othere people who are going to try and come too.
        Also, i'm president of the rubik's cube club at my school and
        i was wondering if maybe we could work something out and have you visit
        one of out meetings and maybe give us a talk or something. Let me know.

        &gt; &gt; Hi everyone, &gt; &gt; I was on my local news station tonight for the
        cube. I was hired by &gt; the organization running our New Year's
        celebration for a 2 hour &gt; performance at a venue to demonstrate/talk
        about the cube. They are &gt; doing a flashback section along the street
        from the 70's through the &gt; 90's and of course the cube is
        featured in the 80's section. &gt; &gt; I tried to catch the clip on tape
        but was unsuccessful. Anyway the &gt; clip was only about 10-20 seconds
        long. First they showed my hands &gt; close up solving, then they showed a
        fast forwarded (clearly marked &gt; with a sub-title) 17 second solve. &gt; &gt;
        I wanted to get the video up here but I probably goofed the setting &gt; on
        my VCR or something so the video didn't capture. &gt; &gt; Well, cubing
        is certainly growing in the media in my local area &gt; because of the
        Pursuit of Happyness movie and all of Tyson's media &gt; coverage. I
        hope this movie has more effect on the cubing community &gt; in general,
        because it certainly is putting it in the spotlight in &gt; my local area.
        &gt; &gt; Happy cubing, &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; P.S. Reporters and News people no longer
        ask me those questions "So &gt; do you think the Rubik's cube is
        on the comeback?" or "Do you think &gt; this Rubik's cube
        revival will last?" or any other variation. They &gt; now mostly ask
        me about competitions and records and what &gt; competitions are coming up
        next worldwide, etc.. I think that's &gt; good, because I think they
        just assume the cube is back now and so &gt; they don't ask those
        "comeback" questions any more :-) &gt;

    Check speedcubing.com and browse to the 5x5 section. I know there are a
        few people who can do it blindfolded in under 20 minutes (counting

    Well, hopefully your cubes come back. I know they miss you. There's
        absolutely no reason to feel inferior simply because your times are in
        the 40's and 50's instead of 10's and 20's.

        I'm trying to learn how to solve the cube without any algorithms
        (unless i came up with them myself, without a computer) Is this
        feasible? I'm working through Joël's tutorial on commutators,
        which is helpful, but i'm hoping there is something/somebody out
        there to provide additional advice for me. If Joël reads this, I
        encourage you to beef up your commutators tutorial! It's good
        stuff, but more depth would be ever better! --David

    Oh I think I get it now... If you consider only the (independent)

        that once the bottom 4 corners are solved then the top 4 must be
        permuted properly relative to each other. Hence, positions that do not
        satisfy this corners constraint on the 4x4 would not be &lt;R,R,U,u&gt;

    I could be wrong but i belive most of the new model rubik cubes all have
        an internal nail type system kind like a screw however which prevents
        the pieces from coming out or being pryed out. This makes most of the
        newer models non adjustable and not so great for speed cubing. If you
        get an older cube id say 80's era or a diy kit from rubiks.com or
        other cube specialty online you can adjust. Keep working your cube in
        though and it will get better with time. Sanding the pieces down can
        also help.

    That's incredible. And it's good to know that stackmats are

        lighting. Personally, I never understood why anyone would actually want
        to solve a cube with their feet (assuming they had two good hands). The
        last time I gave it a try was about 6 yrs ago. It'd probably take
        me 12 minutes. I'm very parinoid about germs, and wouldn't
        want anyone's feet on either my timer or cube (including my own
        feet). Just thinking about it makes me shudder. Yet, I am still
        impressed by anyone who can solve it under 2 minutes this way. (Just
        never want to see it in-person.) -Doug --- In

    It is a piety no one has bothered to answer this yet, but I'll give
        it a try. I don't normally use Fridrich F2L though, so my advice
        might not be what you are looking for. (Well on the 5x5 I use it
        exclusiely since it's better suited to less inspection time than
        what I normally use on 3x3.) And, you ask the advice of a sub-20 cuber,
        while I don't consider myself to be, although I get a few single
        sub-15 times on a daily basis. First off, I think a good goal/plateau to
        be targeting is 13 seconds (or at least that used to be a good
        rule-of-thumb back in the day). It's not terribly hard to get
        sub-7s on any 2-look LL. I used to be there, and need to get myself back
        down to 13s ave. In general, I think that at your level (I am guessing
        from the way you sound), that the F2L excersize you describe is a good
        thing. But here's some stuff to move forward to, when you're
        ready. What I recommend doing is to stop thinking about F2L algs as
        "match- up then insert". It should be a single fluid motion
        that takes ~1.0s to execute. In fact, for some of the more awkward cases
        none of the optimal algs will be of this form (match-up then insert).
        Ideally, you plan out the next pair at the same time you start the
        current alg. In practice, many times I encounter situations where 2 or
        more are ready to go and I have to pick from that set of pairs.
        Moreover, I think of it as picking from a collection of *ALGS*, and
        knowing in advaced that one alg won't effect another pair that I
        have located. Thus I do two algs in rapid succession. If this is not
        feasible, then I chose one pair/alg that gives a better setup for the
        other pair. Of course this is borderline multi-slotting stuff, but this
        is good... In which case, it can be as advanced as looking for
        opportunities where you "pair-up up A *while* inserting B" and
        vice- versa. Right after the cross, and really throughout F2L, I scan
        the LL for F2L pieces. So really, I just try to be ready for whatever
        junk may get "kicked out" of a slot, hoping for the best. For
        the final F2L pair, I do ZB so that there is less overhead for the LL
        and a greater chance for 1-alg LL. Okay, now for the cross. I don't
        think it's a good idea to close your eyes during cross. In fact I
        don't blink during a solve. (I try really hard not to blink during
        5x5 either, lol.) It's always possible for some level of your
        conciousness to pick up on certain patterns and/or plan ahead further.
        Closing your eyes for cross is a good excersize, ...for a beginner.
        Definately plan out at least 3 pieces of the cross. AND don't try
        to solve them into "absolute position" only "relative
        postion". I vaugely recall Dan H. making an emphasis on this in one
        of his tutorials I saw somewhere a while back. (If you can find what
        I'm talking about, I highly recommend studing that.) During my very
        last turn of "solving-3-cross-pieces-relative-to-each- other (if I
        can't do all 4 together)" I will "sneak in" a turn
        (if necessary) so that the final cross piece is in the middle layer if
        it was originally flipped. *Think about what I mean by this (it's
        hard to explain things in text).* Then it's 1 or 2 turns to finish,
        and perhaps 1 more turn to adjust the cross layer so they line up with
        the centers. Now, this is where I want to point out something that most
        novice and some advanced cubers will constantly negelct, rarely ever
        contemplate it... LOOK FOR SLANT PAIRS! Before linking the cross up with
        the centers it's possible to sneak in a "slant pairing".
        Sometimes I just do all of them *slant*, and it's more efficent
        that way. I probably use the technique of slant-ZbF2L more than any
        other cuber, so I'm very used to it and a big advocator ot it.
        However, etremely fast cubers NEVER do any slant F2L stuff (Jessica F.
        comes to mind). Sometimes I even re-slant, but it can be a hassle so
        don't do it more than once. Instead of excersizing the
        "closing your eyes" approach. Try minimizing turns! In almost
        every single case, it is possible to solve a cross in 7 turns or less
        (FTM/HTM). (108 out of however many quintillion that absolutely require
        8 FTM turns in fact.) Think about that.... -Doug p.s. I just timed a
        random F2L solve and got 12.93 with OLL skip! (landed on T-Perm in fact)

    I believe the term is "traditional chinese (characters)" not
        classical &gt;_&lt;. I have a hard time with simplified chinese, I think
        the traditional characters look much more artistic. My Manderin is a
        little rusty too, plus they where speaking rather fast. Luckily it is
        subtitled! I'm quite fluent in Cantonese, btw. I can tell that it
        is set in Taiwan though. Anyways, I am really bored and might post a

    This is really good stuff. By "slant pairs", I assume you mean
        solving "unmatched pairs" into slots with the cross off so
        they are solved when the cross is put in place. I think Jason Thong had
        something on that on his site but he called it multislotting which is a
        term that already means something else. I like the term "slant
        pairing". --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, d_funny007

        this yet, but I'll give &gt; it a try. &gt; &gt; I don't normally use
        Fridrich F2L though, so my advice might not be &gt; what you are looking
        for. (Well on the 5x5 I use it exclusiely since &gt; it's better
        suited to less inspection time than what I normally use &gt; on 3x3.) And,
        you ask the advice of a sub-20 cuber, while I don't &gt; consider
        myself to be, although I get a few single sub-15 times on a &gt; daily
        basis. &gt; &gt; First off, I think a good goal/plateau to be targeting is 13
        seconds &gt; (or at least that used to be a good rule-of-thumb back in the
        day). &gt; It's not terribly hard to get sub-7s on any 2-look LL. I
        used to be &gt; there, and need to get myself back down to 13s ave. &gt; &gt; In
        general, I think that at your level (I am guessing from the way &gt; you
        sound), that the F2L excersize you describe is a good thing. But &gt;
        here's some stuff to move forward to, when you're ready. &gt; &gt;
        What I recommend doing is to stop thinking about F2L algs as
        "match- &gt; up then insert". It should be a single fluid motion
        that takes ~1.0s &gt; to execute. In fact, for some of the more awkward
        cases none of the &gt; optimal algs will be of this form (match-up then
        insert). &gt; &gt; Ideally, you plan out the next pair at the same time you
        start the &gt; current alg. In practice, many times I encounter situations
        where 2 &gt; or more are ready to go and I have to pick from that set of
        pairs. &gt; Moreover, I think of it as picking from a collection of *ALGS*,
        and &gt; knowing in advaced that one alg won't effect another pair
        that I &gt; have located. Thus I do two algs in rapid succession. If this
        is not &gt; feasible, then I chose one pair/alg that gives a better setup
        for &gt; the other pair. &gt; &gt; Of course this is borderline multi-slotting
        stuff, but this is &gt; good... In which case, it can be as advanced as
        looking for &gt; opportunities where you "pair-up up A *while*
        inserting B" and vice- &gt; versa. &gt; &gt; Right after the cross, and
        really throughout F2L, I scan the LL for &gt; F2L pieces. So really, I just
        try to be ready for whatever junk may &gt; get "kicked out" of a
        slot, hoping for the best. &gt; &gt; For the final F2L pair, I do ZB so that
        there is less overhead for &gt; the LL and a greater chance for 1-alg LL. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Okay, now for the cross. &gt; &gt; I don't think it's a good
        idea to close your eyes during cross. In &gt; fact I don't blink
        during a solve. (I try really hard not to blink &gt; during 5x5 either,
        lol.) It's always possible for some level of your &gt; conciousness to
        pick up on certain patterns and/or plan ahead &gt; further. &gt; &gt; Closing
        your eyes for cross is a good excersize, ...for a beginner. &gt; &gt;
        Definately plan out at least 3 pieces of the cross. AND don't try
        to &gt; solve them into "absolute position" only "relative
        postion". I &gt; vaugely recall Dan H. making an emphasis on this in
        one of his &gt; tutorials I saw somewhere a while back. (If you can find
        what I'm &gt; talking about, I highly recommend studing that.) &gt; &gt;
        During my very last turn of "solving-3-cross-pieces-relative-to-
        each- &gt; other (if I can't do all 4 together)" I will
        "sneak in" a turn (if &gt; necessary) so that the final cross
        piece is in the middle layer if &gt; it was originally flipped. *Think
        about what I mean by this (it's &gt; hard to explain things in text).*
        Then it's 1 or 2 turns to finish, &gt; and perhaps 1 more turn to
        adjust the cross layer so they line up &gt; with the centers. &gt; &gt; Now, this
        is where I want to point out something that most novice &gt; and some
        advanced cubers will constantly negelct, rarely ever &gt; contemplate it...
        LOOK FOR SLANT PAIRS! Before linking the cross up &gt; with the centers
        it's possible to sneak in a "slant pairing". &gt; &gt;
        Sometimes I just do all of them *slant*, and it's more efficent
        that &gt; way. I probably use the technique of slant-ZbF2L more than any
        other &gt; cuber, so I'm very used to it and a big advocator ot it.
        However, &gt; etremely fast cubers NEVER do any slant F2L stuff (Jessica F.
        comes &gt; to mind). &gt; &gt; Sometimes I even re-slant, but it can be a hassle
        so don't do it &gt; more than once. &gt; &gt; Instead of excersizing the
        "closing your eyes" approach. Try &gt; minimizing turns! In
        almost every single case, it is possible to &gt; solve a cross in 7 turns
        or less (FTM/HTM). (108 out of however many &gt; quintillion that
        absolutely require 8 FTM turns in fact.) Think &gt; about that.... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        -Doug &gt; &gt; p.s. I just timed a random F2L solve and got 12.93 with OLL
        skip! &gt; (landed on T-Perm in fact) &gt;

    Tools required: A dremel and razor blade and a phillips screwdriver.
        Disassemble the rubik's cube. Slide the Razor blade under the cap,
        and use the leverage, and push down on the blade like a fulcrum. Repeat
        5 more times to remove all 6 caps. Use a dremel and a bit to create a
        "x" in all 6 rivets. Be accurate so that your phillips
        screwdriver will fit tightly into the engravement. Adjust the tension of
        the Rivets that you just converted into screws as needed. Apply the caps
        putting a layer of paper underneath as a spacer to hold the caps in
        place. They may pop, just put them back in when they do so. To avoid
        this, do not slam or drop the cube. Since you are doing this to a 2005
        model. Makesure to visit cubesmith.com and buy yourself some nice
        stickers!!! ~End Later, Daniel Beyer --- In

    I've been thinking about Domino (or 3x3x2) solving recently, and my
        conclusion is that getting a sub-15 average will probably require some
        kind of LL algorithm set. So I've used ACube to find fast
        algorithms for all LL cases on the Domino, for two different styles of
        solving: 1) Solve with a 3x3 side on top. There are 21 standard PLL
        cases and 20 PLL cases with parity. 2) Solve with a 2x3 side on top (so
        you use Roux blocks). There are 16 LL cases. Would anyone be interested
        enough in Domino speedsolving to learn last layer algorithms? I'm
        considering it myself... if you're interested, I'll put them
        on the web.

    I am having similar problems with a cube removing the center piece,
        however I am wondering if it is worth the trouble. How big of a
        difference is there between a lubed cube and a non-lubed cube? I am
        thinking of simply popping out one of the pieces and squeezing some lube
        in there instead of going through the hassle of popping the center piece
        to loosen the tension on the springs. I also have another DIY cube I
        ordered from rubiks.com. I seem to have a lot of trouble with DIY cubes.
        I find that I absolutely Must tighten the screws all the way, otherwise
        the cube will be too loose and will fall apart with every turn I make.
        Currently, I have not lubed this cube and am wondering how big of a
        difference it would make. (After all, this is really the only option I
        have of 'loosening' the cube, since I mentioned earlier that
        loosening the screws even by a moderate amount make the entire cube
        extremely loose and very prone to popping.) Thanks for the responses.

        big cubes. I'm pretty sure his section on 4x4 was the first of

    We would very much like to encourage newer cubers to post more often.
        There is nothing to be afraid of..., we won't bite! (Well it seems
        Clancy might o_O.) Ask questions, even stupid ones (although a lot of
        them, so that we can pick something that isn't too silly to answer,
        lol). It's how we all get better at cubing (okay so practice is the
        key, but still...). Also, even if you are not spectacular, I'd
        encourage you to come to a competition sometime. Meeting cubers faster
        than you is a great way to get more motivated about cubing. And we want

    I have always used the term "slant pairs". Plus I feel
        I've been cubing long enough to deserve to coin terminology.
        However, I do like the term "unmatched pairs"... it sounds
        much more technical and I'd be willing to adopt it. I guess I just
        haven't heard either of those terms used frequently enough to make
        a firm decision. I think it's becasue it's just not very
        popular. It seems to me that many of the fastest cubers simply
        don't use it at all. It avoids having to deal with complex issues
        such as having the number of corners and edges done to be out of sync,
        and/or having to "re-slant". (Would you say
        "re-unmatch"??? Hem, okay so maybe my term does have one

    Ya, I wonder why that is. There must be some scientific explaination for
        it. Orange always lasts the shortest, followed by green, and then blue,
        and then red and yellow. (okay so I'm guesstimateing, can someone
        else post what they think the order really is, thus confirming there is
        an order to it, or that is independent of cubing style) I highly
        recommend cubesmith as well. Short of that, cutting out your own sticers
        out of colored electrical tape used to be my prefernce. It still yields
        a great effect if one is willing to put in *that* much time. Me on the
        other hand, I've been cubing pretty long and grew tired of stickers
        peeling on me. Thus, to avoid it completely, I always peel off all the
        stickers whenever I take a cube out of the box and then de- gunkify it.
        At this point I wait till i have time to do a proper
        "prepping" and before re-stickering. Oh, and for peeling off
        the stickers I recomend getting one of those plastic razors (they can be
        found on cubesmith, but possibly other places too, "Scrape
        Rite" is what it's called). Those things have made
        de-stickering very fast and even fun! (Try one in each hand or two in
        one hands and time yourself.... I know someone here is going to... :) )

   <div class="email-content">
    First off in response to the original post: Holy ****!, I didn't
        know it was possible. That sounds really cool. Stefan is probably right
        though, those rivets aren't threaded the usual way. Turning one
        this way might still loosen things up though I could imagine.
        Personally, I still perfer the non-DIY over DIY for my main speedcubes.
        Now when it comes to removing the center caps, The method he described
        should work pretty well in theory. A few details that should have been
        pointed out though... Understand the geometry of the center caps. You
        certainly don't want to slice the center cap straight off, the cap
        is what is technically known as a shallow (or stub) tenon. It's a
        "mortise and tenon joint", and the cap-side is a bit rounded
        (a fillet) while the mortise is squared off. Knowning these things and
        how deep the joint is can help with *AVOIDING INJURIES*. On a DIY cube,
        the caps already have tiny spacers built- in so that it is not terribly
        hard to get a razor blade in. Oh and I must stress this: *cut away from
        your body* (and other bodies). *I've hurt myself a lot doing things
        like changing tiles on a Meffert's assembly cube so I know a thing
        or two about this stuff.) If nothing else works, try going at it from
        the corner and levering it there (that part has more area so you get
        more mechanical advatage). Trry different corners of it too. They are
        usually placed with 2 small drops of glue on opposite sides... I'd
        say that the over-hang is about 2mm and the depth of it is about 1.5mm.
        It's best to familiarize yourself with a stand-alone center cap or
        DIY kit before attempting this. Hem, having said all that... is it
        really worth doing? I say *no*. Loose cubes generally can't be
        tightened (unless there're actual screws), and tight cubes loosen
        very quickly after a couple weeks of rigorious cubing, which I believe
        is desireable in order for a cube to "learn" your cubing style
        and be well suited for a cuber. Out of the box, I've never run into
        a cube that was "too loose" or "too tight" for me to
        toss. On the other hand, with most of the DIY cubes I have put together
        I have the constant urge to trash them or give them away. As they seem
        to lock-up more often than pre- assembled cubes for me for some reason.
        (Any one else feel the same way?) I even go through the trouble of
        lubing the springs and using 1 or 2 washers per axle (got the idea from
        Stefan). On a not-so-related note, I am starting to hate the embossed
        Rubik's logo that is always on one of the caps nowadays. I think
        that the store bought cubes have dwindled in quality over the past few
        years. If you can, I do (now) recommend DIY over those. In turn, I
        recommend 25th anniversary cubes over DIY. Unfortunately they are not
        usually found in stores [in the Us]. If you want a good cube you are
        just gonna have to spend the time hunting around. Oh, and BTW never buy
        a cube off Amazon (I had a really bad expereince once). In the end,
        it's all about how much time you are willing to spend, choosing and
        prepping a new cube. -Doug (and his endless stream of worthless

   <div class="email-content">
    I'm kind of in the same boat. I've been cubing for about 5
        months too. After starting fridrich about two or three months ago my
        times got faster. I'm now at about 40 for an average and I
        sometimes get times individual times in the 20s. Since I am still
        thinking a lot when I solve, I know I can cut another ten seconds or so
        within a couple of more months of practice. I know I am a novice so my
        advice isn't worth anything, but here are a couple of things that
        come to my mind: 1) Progress in steps. Start with a four-look for a
        while, then go to a three-look when you are not making any mistakes.
        Then last go to a two-look after you perfect your OLLs. In other words,
        first learn easy PLLs and use them for a while before moving on to the
        harder ones and save the OLLs for later. You can slowly add OLLs as you
        see the need. It took me a full-month to memorize all of the ALGs for
        OLL and their inverses. 2) When doing F2L, learn the pairs at first by
        really trying to understand the ALGs. It is not important to do them
        quickly. In fact, it is probably best to do them extremely slowly and
        note how all of the pieces moves in relation to each other. This will be
        important later. Start with "easy" ones first and slowly move
        on to the more difficult ones, such as pairs that are out of place or
        stuck in the wrong slots, after you really know them with your both your
        fingers and your mind. You should know what the move will feel like
        before you even attempt the ALG. So in other words, don't practice
        for speed, practice for perfection. 3) Create your on system for
        learning ALGs. Some people really have a difficult time memorizing the
        notation as is. Of course learning the notation is important to get a
        lot of the ALGs on the net, but you may be able to make your own system
        that works for you better. For example, some people who learn better
        through music or sound may want to learn the "sound" of the
        ALGs. I have two meanings by this. One, all of your finger tricks have a
        unique rhythm and sound, so the combination of moves will sound a
        certain way. You can then practice to a metronome trying to get the
        rhythm faster and faster. Second, you can rename the notation into
        consonant and vowel combinations. For example, a "R" turn can
        be called "TA," a "U" turn can be called
        "BA," and a "R" can be called "TE." Thus a
        "RUR'" can be renamed "TABATE," a new word you
        can memorize easily and sing along as you are cubing!! I know this is
        probably not the answer you were looking for and I am in no position to
        make any advice, but I know exactly what you are talking about!!! To a

    &gt; Oh and (R2U2)^3 doesn't count! Of course it does! That's one
        of the 20 algorithms with parity. Here are some longer ones (I try to
        use RULDM only, because it's fast for me): R2 D' L2 U' L2
        D' L2 U' L2 D' R2 D' swaps UF and UR edges. U R2
        U' R2 y' M2 D L2 D' L2 D' R2 D R2 U' R2 x2
        swaps UBL and UFR corners. y' R2 U R2 U' R2 D R2 U' R2
        U' R2 U R2 U' R2 U2 R2 swaps UFR and ULF corners. &gt; Now that I
        think more about it, You can't use the standard 3x3 PLLs &gt; either
        due to the turning restrictions. Hem..., at the same time &gt; there would
        be added flexibility of not caring about the &gt; 4
        "invisible-edges"/"mystery-edges" or being off by an
        E (assuming &gt; holding it a certain way). I bet there are tons of cool
        PLL algs for &gt; this puzzle. You could say 'tons'... I usually
        got about 50-100 optimal algorithms when I searched, so I guess you have
        a lot of stuff to choose from. On the other hand, the optimal algorithms
        can be pretty long, and all the 180-degree turns are slow. &gt; On second
        thought, I think I'd go with a CF method. What do you guys &gt; think?
        That's a pretty good idea, actually, except that you wouldn't
        be able to do the edges in one algorithm. On the other hand, if you sort
        the edges, you can do edge permutation on each layer separately, and the
        algorithms for that are 12 moves or less. &gt; Okay I really want a domino
        now! Me too. I usually emulate on a 3x3x3 (ignore middle layer) or
        4x4x4. If I ever decide to seriously speedcube it, I'll have to get
        or make a real one. I haven't decided whether it's faster to
        have a numbered or colored cube. Is it a valid record, I wonder, if you
        use a 3x3x2 cuboid?

   <div class="email-content">
    Spoken like a true expert. A few comments though... let's start
        with the more wildly random ones. 1) My name is "Doug"! the
        handle is dfunny and it has stuck since grade school and is from the
        Nickelodeon cartoon (obvious to the American pop culture ppl here). I
        don't like to be called that &gt;_&lt;. 2) I don't want to see
        another person using the sign-off of "Cheers!!!" o_O. 3) Both
        of you are progressing nicely. Many of the cubers here have been around
        for 4 years to be getting as fast/good as we are. There are even a few
        old-school from the early 80's still around. True, there are a few
        exceptional cubers out there that can master things after only a year or
        two of cubing (and at this rate you can still be one of them), but
        don't put unnessecary pressure on yourselves to get fast. When I
        started cubing, I didn't focus on speed, and opted to focus on
        "understanding". In the long run if you just blindly focus on
        speed then you'd be missing out on all the coolness that is hidden
        deep in the cube. Although, I should also point out there are tons of
        sub-20 cubers out there that have a lot to learn still.... Cube for the
        journey, not the destination. :) 4) The second person's response
        should answer all your questions (oh and btw, it makes it easier for ppl
        to answer all your questions if you punctuate better, I like to do a
        "find" on the ?'s) 5) Working on F2L and PLLs at the same
        time should be enough to keep you occupied. Just focusing on just one or
        the other may lead to an early on-set of boredom. There are really only
        13 PLLs and those are important to learn (heck, even if you don't
        plan on being pure- Fridrich like me - actually I'm far from it).
        The order of those and c/e-pairing algs does make a difference. Start
        off with the shorter F2L algs. &lt;This is where I'm too lazy to
        suggest an order for it, so let's just pretend I did and/or wait
        till someone else does.&gt; And for PLL, learn the 3-edge cycles and 3-
        corner cycles first. I would learn the slice version first and go back
        to a 2-gen after halfway though OLLs. I am refering to the following:
        (R2 U F B' R2 F' B U R2) and its F&lt;-&gt;B mirror for edges and
        then (x R' U R' D2 R U' R' D2 R2' x') and
        it's inverse. Oh, and DO know your notation, I don't quite
        agree with the second post on that point. I think that beginners NEED to
        KNOW and USE the standard notation that we as a community have adopted.
        It's the freakin' language! It's like moving to France
        and not planning on learning French. Don't make your own system...
        (if you feel up to it extend the notation slightly sure, have some fun
        with it). Using mnemonics and stuff might prove helpful, but I would
        consider that notation. Also don't focus too hard on the
        "sound" of an alg. That sound will gradually change as you get
        faster and perfect your cubing-style anyways. It's something that
        will seep into your subconscious for sure. (BTW, fun game to play at a
        cube gathering is to bld ppl and have them figure out which alg you are
        perfoming using their ears only...) So getting back to the point. Learn
        the Z-Perm, yes I said "the", I don't like to use
        unqualified wording much, but in this case there is really just one alg
        that like 95% of cubers use for it and it's a really fun alg to
        coast with, as is the T-Perm. It's much easier to have a cuber
        there to teach a beginner the Z-Perm, since it probably takes 20 times
        longer to learn it on your own. Learn an H-Perm/+Perm while you are at
        it. After T, do Y. Then finish off all the ones that are in the parity
        group (N,J/L,F,R) but also stick E-Perm in there too. This saves the
        G-Perm for last and that one has 4 distinct appearences so it's
        harder to do regonition for but there is a trick for that... Okay so
        hopefully the two of you are at least half way done with PLL anyways and
        most of that was useless info. Before learning more than say 5 OLLs,
        master F2L. I've been cubing for years and still don't know
        about 1/3 of the OLL. (I use a slightly different method actually and so
        I don't really need them.) But even Fridrich followers can get to
        averaging 17s knowing as much as I know about OLL and PLL I'm sure
        (given detexterity of course). Try to learn those in order of alg length
        too, for this I recommend Bob's site he has them laid out pretty
        well. Well at the point where you start learning say 1/4 of OLL, spend
        some serious time forcing yourself to be more active and optimal with
        the cross step. This is typically neglected and cubers that are fast
        (that know that they can make up the time elsewhere) will be chronically
        lazy on that step. Target getting to 13s average on F2L including cross.
        To expedite this, you can exclusivle do F2L solves for a sitting. After
        this point is where I htink you have to master OLL (or do something
        equivalently or more advanced/useful). I just did a 29.xx solve using
        Fridrich, with 2-look OLL. So it's totally possible. (Next one was
        30.78.) Okay I'm actually quite bad at this, but it is accepted
        that averaging sub-25 is a realistic goal using pure-Fridrich but with
        2-look OLL. 5) You learned all of OLL in just 1 month! That must have
        been rigourous. I would have recommened stretching that out further to
        maybe 2 months with periods of "consolidation". Reminds me of
        how ChrisH learned all of ZBF2L in just 1 intensive month, but that is
        probably 3-4 times harder. But he didn't retain it...., so what
        does that tell you about learning things too fast? I'm taking my
        time learning new algs. I learn a new alg (and it's inverse and
        mirrors) once a week. It does get easier though...well after it gets
        much harder. 6) In regards to the later remarks on the first post,
        memory really doesn't have much to do with speedcubing (at least
        not anywhere near the beginner level). It's more about intuition, I
        hold. Think about it... all you really have to memorize straight are the
        13 PLLs. c/e- pairing algs can be learned intuitively for sure. Cheat a
        little and refernce sites for the more awkward ones. But after studing
        (yes cubing requires *studing*... I mean how else are you going to get
        your cubing-diploma? o_O), ya after studing a new F2L alg for a while
        you should be able to understand it well enough that it's not
        counted as memorization. Okay I conceed that there are a few (just a few
        really) that are best left memorized dead. The one I use for the case
        when "the corner is in and good and the edge is in but
        flipped" I did executed blindly for the longest time. Also there is
        the related one where the corner is instead twisted in place. I also
        never used the alg (R2 U2 R' U' R U' R2) (inverse to
        setup) for the longest time and the one I used instead was memorized.
        Here's a brief description of what you should be doing while
        learning an F2L alg: I'll pick as an example, R U' R'
        F' U2 F (inverse to setup). BTW, I feel that the proper way to
        write an alg is on a line by itself either single-spaced or no-spaces
        like that. It's a very common thing to say "inverse to
        setup". Do do that; it's a helpful studing technique. This of
        course requires you to practice "reading an alg backwards".
        The skill is very important as well as reading an alg mirrored and even
        the combinations of the two whenever needed. I quickly got to the point
        where I can not only mirror algs on-the- fly (and every cuber should be
        able to do this), but to be able to inverse algs on-the-fly, which is
        much less mastered ability among cubers. It comes in handy...
        Doens't come up a lot for Fridrich users is why they don't
        generally care. I studied inversing a lot for a CLL alg set, which is
        something more advanced (in a way, I know... grumble, grumble...). So
        start with disecting the alg. Actually, start with picking the alg that
        best suits your cubing style (but after only 5 months of cubing you guys
        shouldn't really have a cubing-style to speak of). Being able to
        disect them is needed for the selection process though... I look at R
        U' R' F' U2 F and look for things of the form (X Y*
        X') or (X' Y* X), where it is better if the * is not a 2. And
        I do "grouping" or "locating the triggers" (F'
        U2 F) looks good and (R U' R') looks even better. Thus the alg
        should be (R U' R') (F' U2 F) the parentheses are
        actaully a part of our standard notation scheme to denote the triggering
        [possiblities &lt;since some expereienced people may opt to deviate at
        their discresion&gt;]. Learn stand-alone TRIGGERS. In fact, almost all of
        them are getting names soon I hope! (I'd like to extend the core
        teamBLD callings for them.) Practice things like (R U' R')
        like a thousand times! I like to call it "kick right".
        Fingering is very important to get right. If done right that trigger can
        be done under 0.50s comfortably. Oh and do time yourself doing 10
        back-to-back executions of this and moving the decimal point to get an
        accurate timing. Come up with quirky names for triggers and algs
        yourself, it's really fun (esp. with other cubers) and helps with
        the learning process. Making flash cards like people often do for
        learning a foreign language helps too, but that requires a greater
        measure of dedication. The second part of that alg is a fast trigger
        too, plus it connects well together. I recommend watching videos of
        these algs, I'm sure thre are at least 3 sites that showcase
        individual videos of all the algs you need to learn (typically a
        "slow" version along with a "fast" version). -Doug
        p.s. I just realized I used the term "parity group," but
        that's not a group in the mathematical sence.... I couldn't
        find an adequate definition so that it would be; I'm such a dork.

        about 5 months too. &gt; After starting fridrich about two or three months
        ago my times got &gt; faster. I'm now at about 40 for an average and I
        sometimes get times &gt; individual times in the 20s. Since I am still
        thinking a lot when I &gt; solve, I know I can cut another ten seconds or
        so within a couple of &gt; more months of practice. &gt; &gt; I know I am a
        novice so my advice isn't worth anything, but here are a &gt; couple
        of things that come to my mind: &gt; &gt; 1) Progress in steps. Start with a
        four-look for a while, then go to a &gt; three-look when you are not making
        any mistakes. Then last go to a &gt; two-look after you perfect your OLLs.
        In other words, first learn easy &gt; PLLs and use them for a while before
        moving on to the harder ones and &gt; save the OLLs for later. You can
        slowly add OLLs as you see the need. &gt; It took me a full-month to
        memorize all of the ALGs for OLL and their &gt; inverses. &gt; &gt; 2) When doing
        F2L, learn the pairs at first by really trying to &gt; understand the ALGs.
        It is not important to do them quickly. In fact, &gt; it is probably best
        to do them extremely slowly and note how all of &gt; the pieces moves in
        relation to each other. This will be important &gt; later. Start with
        "easy" ones first and slowly move on to the more &gt; difficult
        ones, such as pairs that are out of place or stuck in the &gt; wrong slots,
        after you really know them with your both your fingers &gt; and your mind.
        You should know what the move will feel like before you &gt; even attempt
        the ALG. So in other words, don't practice for speed, &gt; practice
        for perfection. &gt; &gt; 3) Create your on system for learning ALGs. Some
        people really have a &gt; difficult time memorizing the notation as is. Of
        course learning the &gt; notation is important to get a lot of the ALGs on
        the net, but you may &gt; be able to make your own system that works for
        you better. For &gt; example, some people who learn better through music or
        sound may want &gt; to learn the "sound" of the ALGs. I have two
        meanings by this. One, &gt; all of your finger tricks have a unique rhythm
        and sound, so the &gt; combination of moves will sound a certain way. You
        can then practice &gt; to a metronome trying to get the rhythm faster and
        faster. Second, you &gt; can rename the notation into consonant and vowel
        combinations. For &gt; example, a "R" turn can be called
        "TA," a "U" turn can be called "BA," &gt; and
        a "R" can be called "TE." Thus a
        "RUR'" can be renamed "TABATE," a &gt; new word
        you can memorize easily and sing along as you are cubing!! &gt; &gt; I know
        this is probably not the answer you were looking for and I am &gt; in no
        position to make any advice, but I know exactly what you are &gt; talking
        about!!! &gt; &gt; To a sub-20 &gt; Cheers!!! &gt;

    I understand that holding the cube to the left offers a more dominant

        more ambidextrous one. my question is whether or not there is a clear
        benefit to using the cross on the bottom. Ive been trying it with a
        cross on the bottom lately and I find that theres much less wasted
        turning and regripping in order to position the ce pair. but i still
        feel really uncomfortable using both hands. and its hard to get used to
        new algorithms. so should i try to change to cross on the bottom, or is
        it really not necessary?

    Maybe, after you put the cube down, the memorization time would stop,
        and then you'd have to solve the cube untimed, but realistically,

    &gt;From what I heard, cross on left is more finger-tricky, and thus faster
        execution, since you would use mostly R and U moves for many of the
        cases. With cross on bottom, however, is considerably easier to look
        ahead, since you can see the whole last layer much easier, which is
        where most of the easiest cases come from. -Alexei --- In

    What a year was 2006 for my son Bernett! I take this day to thank all
        those who inspired my young son. He had performed in 5 television
        channels, 33 public performances in varoius schools, colleges, public
        places etc, one championship - Dutch Open Championship-2006. His school
        has given him free education for this year, our honourable president
        Dr.A.P.J.Abdul Kalam honoured him, Dalmia Cement Ltd honoured him for
        his performance in Dutch open-2006, Reached TOP-3 of Pogo Amazing kids
        award 2006, Maths genius shakuntala Devi praised his cubing and
        memorising skill etc Recently, when he was interviewed by a local tamil
        magazine he answered as follows for some of the questions. 1.What is the
        turning point in your life ? - Every cuber who inspired me is a turning
        point. Ron and Stefan are the main motivators for me. Moreover my dad
        who listens to me very patiently and answers my every question is a big
        boost for me. "Our honourable president Dr.Abdul Kalam said the
        different coloured each piece in a scrambled cube is a problem in
        one's life. How swiftly you are solving the cube. The same way you
        will solve the problems of life also." I am greatly inspired by
        him. He spoke to me so softly. 2.What is your ambition ? - I am
        interested in computer field right now. I do not know, if my priority
        changes when I grow up. 3.Why are you cubing ?- It is fun always. Now,
        it has given me so many friends. 4. Who is your best friend ? - All my
        classmates &amp; my teachers. But my dad is my best. The interviewer
        told me, " sir, I think you are the reason for Bernett's
        wonderful performance because you listen to him and gives him what he
        wants and appreciates him". He also told me he got a message for
        parents, ie, " if you want your kids to do well, then listen to
        them, motivate them and give them more opportunity". But, you all
        know, I do not know much in cubing. God has given him the ability &amp;
        you all cubers had been the source of inspiration. Let me salute and
        thank you all for what all you have done for Bernett. Hope you will
        continue to do the same in 2007 also. Let us meet in Budapest. Wishing
        you all a happy new year. John Louis Send free SMS to your Friends on

    Those have been dis-continued (at least in the states) for about 10
        years now. They have become quite hard to find. I think your best bet to
        finding a sq-1 is to use e-bay unfortunately. I have gotten 2 of them in
        my life, bought at a toy store around 1993. I lost one and I turned on
        into a speedcube. *Looks at my speed-sq1 with pride* It does haunt me a
        bit that I can't solve a sq1 on my own... I can get to a cube shape
        after lots of random turning and then solving corners would be the same
        as doing them on say a rubik's domino or 2x2x3. I could then get
        most of the edges in intuitively. I can preceed further using
        commutators. If I see parity I'm screwed. Does anyone have a very
        short or easy to memorize parity alg for sq1? It can mess up every
        single piece as long as it gets me back to cube shape... -Doug --- In

    The mechanism of the domino doesn't seem to lend itself very well
        to speed-cubing. When I got the puzzle, it got stuck on some turns. It
        turned out that one of the pieces was cracked inside. So I took it apart
        and stuck a piece of wood inside to hold it in place. It has worked ever
        since, but sometimes it sticks and you have to kind of work around it.
        The one I got was a Christmas version of the domino. It was red on one
        side and white on the other. One side had Santa Clause and the other
        Christmas bells. In a way I like that better because an unsolved picture
        is more quickly noticable than just dominos being out of order. It would
        be quite adequate just to have a 3*3*2 with six colored faces like the
        cube does, even if you lose the mater of center orientation. Correct me
        if I'm wrong, but doesn't the five fall in the center square
        of the domino puzzle? If it looks like it does on a die, the center
        orientation doesn't matter anyway. Billy
