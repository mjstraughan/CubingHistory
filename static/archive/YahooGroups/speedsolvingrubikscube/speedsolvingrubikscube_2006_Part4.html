I can only guess how hard this was to get the visa...it&#x27;s really good it
finally happens. :-)

There will be some nice competition in Multiple Blindfolded cubing :D (and
other events of course :-))

I can&#x27;t wait for that competition. :-)

It is funny; the majority of cubers seem to have a webpage with a
tutorial about learning to solve the cube. But I haven&#x27;t seen one that
explains how put together a competition.  I have been to a couple
competitions (one very big, one fairly small), so I know what it looks
and feels like from a competitor&#x27;s perspective, but I have no clue
about what it actually means to organize it. For example:

What should one expect the event to cost? 
How does one pay for all these costs?  
How do you estimate the number of expected competitors? 
How do you estimate the number of expected spectators?  
How do you know the proper time to hold the event so you get the
maximum turn out?  
How and where do you get all the required equipment? 
How do you ensure it will be sanctioned by the WCA (i.e. what if a
delegate doesn&#x27;t want to make the trip)?

I am very interested in putting together a competition here in the
Toronto area to help the cubing community, and to give back for all
the competitions us few Canadians have attended.  But I really don&#x27;t
know how to go about organizing it all.  Others have done it, and
surely made mistakes that new organizers can learn from.  We are all
about sharing information in this community, but it hasn&#x27;t seemed to
extend to this aspect yet.  Any help, advice or answers to the
aforementioned questions would be appreciated.

          <div class="email-content">Find a venue and some friends to help out.  The rest is just contacting
other cubers, trying to get a number of how many can attend, and hope that
not too many say they can attend, but then back out.  As for equipment, such
as timers, those can be borrowed or you can ask other people who have them
to bring them.  But first, find a possible venue.

          <div class="email-content">Dave, (and the rest of the group)
   
  I am definitely not the most experienced organizer in this group, but I have done it none the less, so I figured I would answer the questions you have asked.
  
As far as cost, I was able to use the meeting facilities in the hotel that I work for, so I was not charged a fee for the room.  I know that not everyone is as fortunate as I am, or perhaps the CalTech guys are in acquiring venue space.  However, I noticed that at the Barnes and Nobles bookstore here in my city, they have space set aside for groups of Scrabble players to get together and have meetings and tournaments.  I don&#x27;t believe they are charged for this, and so that might be something that you can check out.  Also, seek out local Science Centers and ask for their help.  They probably won&#x27;t charge anything, since it will draw attention to their facility.  However, if there is a cost incurred, you can attempt to make up for that by charging a participation fee.  
   
  Before anything though, you really should talk with other cubers in the general area of where you want to hold the competition, and see when the best time to hold the event will be.  Come up with a list of at least 10 competitors and go from there.  I don&#x27;t believe that the number of spectators is as important, as long as there is something there watching, that way there is more of a sense of pressure.  
   
  When I held my competition, I only had two stackmats.  One was mine, and the other was provided by Chris Hunt.  Due to our small number of competitors, this was ok.  Now, nearly ever cuber has a stackmat, and would more than likely be willing to lend it to the competition.  As far as the tournament displays, I think that Speedstacks has been generous in loaning equipment out for these events.  This was the case in Tennessee. (And with some of the CalTech events I think)  Send them a request.  The worst they can do is say no.
   
  As far as the delegate, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be a board member, just another cuber who is willing to be the main judge, and can be trusted by the WCA to follow all of the rules.  
   
  Let me know if I can answer anything else, and best of luck.

          <div class="email-content">Bob,
 Thanks for recalling those posts.  Perhaps we can re-create a poll and take a new tally of where people would want this held.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Also, Tyson, do you think we can make this happen early next summer, before Worlds, and make a thing every other year, or at least give it a try?  Please let me know on that.  I&#x27;m sure we can gather up at least 20 solid cubers from around the nation to join, not counting all the locals that would possibly come.
Patrick

          <div class="email-content">Let me share my thoughts on this.  I live in NY, so I will be giving <br>
my thoughts from the perspective of...well, a northeasterner.<br>
<br>
The two most recent northeastern contests were Trumbull + Rutgers <br>
Spring.  Between the two, there were 31 competitors (okay, I&#x27;m only <br>
counting 3x3 competitors for time&#x27;s sake).  7 went to both (22.6%).  <br>
Of the 31, 4 (me, Craig, Bob, Bruce) went to Nationals, which is 12.9%.<br>
<br>
Now let&#x27;s look at Caltech Spring + San Diego.  Those were probably the <br>
two biggest spring contests in California.  80 competitors total, with <br>
23 at both (28.8%).  26 of the 80 competitors were at nationals, which <br>
is 32.5%.<br>
<br>
So what&#x27;s my point?  Less people are going to travel across the <br>
country to go to a contest.  About the same percentage travelled <br>
within their region on the East and West Coasts, but very few <br>
travelled across the country for Nationals.<br>
<br>
Am I saying have the US Open on the east coast?  No.  There&#x27;s less of <br>
a cubing population out here.  What I am saying, though, is that a <br>
multi-site idea is the way to go.  That way, every region (west coast, <br>
east coast, midwest, etc.) can go to its most convenient location.  <br>
Sure, people will have to travel, but really not as much as if it&#x27;s <br>
just in, say, Denver.<br>
<br>
Another argument against a single location is Worlds.  People who are <br>
going to go to Hungary a few months later aren&#x27;t going to want to go <br>
across the country.<br>
<br>
So if we have a bunch of sites, where?  Here&#x27;s my proposal:  West <br>
Coast at Caltech or Exploratorium, East Coast at Rutgers or in DC, and <br>
then somewhere in the Midwest--I don&#x27;t know where, someone else should <br>
propose something.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s pretty much all I have to say.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of having <br>
a poll just yet--let&#x27;s get some discussion flowing before a private <br>
ballot.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Another argument against a single location is Worlds.  People who are <br>
&gt; going to go to Hungary a few months later aren&#x27;t going to want to go <br>
&gt; across the country.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to pitch in my two cents, in case anyone else is in the<br>
same boat as me.<br>
<br>
Personally I think the idea of a biyearly US-Open is a wonderful idea,<br>
and I like the idea of having it in the same year as Worlds for many<br>
reasons, such as for those who can&#x27;t make it to Worlds, or for those<br>
able to go to both Worlds and the US Open.  Also a Euro Open would be<br>
really cool if that is something that could be worked out too, though<br>
that is just my opinion.<br>
<br>
As for me, I am absolutley 100% going to Hungary for the Worlds in<br>
2007, and I won&#x27;t really be able to travel or do anything else besides<br>
that as far as cubing goes because I&#x27;m mostly broke and want to be<br>
absolutely certain I can make it to Europe.<br>
<br>
So personally I think the US Open is a great idea, but there&#x27;s no way<br>
I&#x27;d be able to make it.  I have to save literally all of my money for<br>
Hungary or there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be able to afford it.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll try to make a US-Open in the future, but definitely I cannot make<br>
it to one in 2007.  :-(<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve never been there (Denver) and would love to go! They hold 
national (maybe intl?) Speedstacks competitions there.

I&#x27;ve been to LA and SF and don&#x27;t look forward to going again. 
Although SF seems to be much nicer than LA in terms of weather... I 
think Seattle would be lovely too.

I haven&#x27;t been to one in NYC, so that would be another place I&#x27;d be 
interested in seeing more of. I could also go for Idaho if someone 
gave me a better description of what kinda sights and sounds that 
has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural environment. I 
am okay with DC, but there isn&#x27;t anyone there that can host a comp 
for us there (that I know of at least).

I feel that Denver is the most central location so that is one of 
top choices. If we Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in 
Seattle that would be great too. For something like Nationals with 
an expected high turn-out you can&#x27;t go wrong with Idaho if Frank is 
willing to put some time and effort into hosting again.

I am not sure how many cubers are in and around the Chicago area, 
but I don&#x27;t think enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too 
involved in school lately (oh and one left this year).
 
If it is in Toronto, I would be willing to go and act as a WCA 
delagate if necessary... hem I wonder if I&#x27;m allowed to??? I know 
the rules pretty well, and spent a fair amount of free-time pouring 
over them to find things to debate about. I guess I should ask 
before I make any promises. I have not been to Toronto in many 
years... OMG it was WC03! I&#x27;ve been there at least 10 times in the 
past but never stayed long enough to see all the things I wanted to 
see.

If Patterson has time I think we could do a second Midwest 
tournament very successfully. I was very happy with the way the TN 
one was run, although a big part of it must have been Chris. It 
takes more than a single individual to make something like that run 
smoothly. If somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me coordinates 
with Patterson we could get that going for either Madison, WI or 
Chicago, with at least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go. Although 
I have no idea how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is quite busy 
these days.

How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I don&#x27;t recall this ever 
being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor, MI (40 minutes away)?

Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to sneak a peak at AMD&#x27;s 
facilities while I&#x27;m there! Also any chance of a TX tournament? 
Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin?

          <div class="email-content">Lovely! This is precisely the types of questions and discussion I 
wanted to see.

I do see your point here. Nobody writes tutorials on how to host. 
It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s a hidden secret that people horde in order to 
maximize their own publicity value. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not the case buy 
it&#x27;s how it feels to me and probably many others who have wanted to 
host something but haven&#x27;t been able to work it out. Among which, 
100% of the time it&#x27;s just thier own time commitment issues they 
failed to properly account for I&#x27;m sure.

If you want desparately enough for something to happen and have 
enough time to do something about it but haven&#x27;t then we only have 
ourselves to blame. There are many people who have miraculaously 
pulled these things off on their first try, including Greenwood, 
Burton, Pelly, Patterson, and the list goes on... I&#x27;m sure none of 
them have the support that the Caltech group has or the resources 
that Frank has. What you do need is enthusiasm. It is rather 
unfortuante that a majority of people who have been around as long 
as I have lost motivation for such things... and many just retire 
from cubing all together. What we as a community need are the poeple 
that are peaking in enthusism, and even if there is only one in the 
area, enough communication, guidance, and suggestions from other 
cubers will go along way to cooking up a successful competition.

It is a bit sad, but true that turn-out depends so highly on how 
many &quot;high-profile&quot; cubers will be there. You pretty much have to 
start off with working the inital plan to suit/attract 1-3 such 
cubers. There is undoubtedly some bargaining involved.

If you are a student at a big university that it is very much 
possible to get school funding for such things. They do set aside a 
bit of moeny for clubs and that sort of thing.

You bascialy have to plan around likely exam intervals. It would be 
horrible to have soemting the second week of December or of April 
for example... **IF** you&#x27;re targetting college cubers. If you are 
targetting HS cubers then you&#x27;d have to stay away from late-May, 
early-June. The first or second week of June would be graduation for 
most high schools.

It is a tradition to do it on a Saturday morning, and that seems to 
make the most sense. You bascially have to pack everything into a 
very short time. Say 5 hours on some Saturday morning.

It is a good idea to contact hosts o that side of the continent just 
to make sure nobody else has already monopolized that weekend of 
course.... cuz you don&#x27;t want to step on anybody else&#x27;s toes.

The very first thing to do is select a venue. Ideally bring a 
digital camera and take pictures of candidate 
rooms/auditoriums/large lecture halls/stages. Do this from multiple 
angles for each venue possibility. Then e-mail them to people that 
have hosting experience to critique. You&#x27;d be supried at how many 
places offer a free (or very negligiable priced) venue. This is of 
course provided that you A) reserve it well in advanced, and B) let 
them hold on to a fairly hefty security-deposit.

Good candidates as others have already mentioned are: large schools, 
science museums (you could even talk to the Toronto Science Center, 
and remind them of WC03 and get some details about that and what 
they would be willing to offer), large bookstores (multi-story 
ones), and any other sort of major attraction in the city.

Well the Sky Dome might be a bit exessive (I&#x27;ve been on the turf 
there, btw!), but I would suspect that the CN Tower would be willing 
to make you a reasonable offer. Definately do your hw on a place 
first, and also take some time to think about and prepare what you 
are going to say, what points they will bring up, and how you are 
going to counter.

Just remember, the worst that can do is say no. (I know I just typed 
the exact same thing as some other respose but it&#x27;s SO true.)

It might be fun to get different venues competing with each other to 
give you the best deal too, by quoting other offers :). Although 
that is a bit advanced to pull off correctly.

Well if nothing else, then try a hotel. That would at least make it 
easier on the non-locals that choose to stay at that hotel.

I know... it&#x27;s coming in Europe, too, but some countries are still 
very slow. Germany included, it&#x27;s not any better than France, I think 
they&#x27;re almost the same. Though the view of smokers on cigarettes 
seems to be a bit different, one of the French cubers even walked 
around in a Camel shirt.

No it&#x27;s not (just yours).

  As far as another competition, I am still more than willing and able to host another event.  I still have all of the resources necessary, and just need serious competitors.  Interest is growing a bit here, which will help out, but like Doug said, it is always nice to have as many high profile cubers as possible.  Also, if Chris Hunt were ever interested, I would be willing to help out with any planning and execution of an event in Seattle.  I have family up there that would be willing to help as well.  I also agree that Denver could be a very nice option, if there was anyone willing to put in some work.

I&#x27;ve been to LA and SF and don&#x27;t look forward to going again. 
Although SF seems to be much nicer than LA in terms of weather... I 
think Seattle would be lovely too.

I haven&#x27;t been to one in NYC, so that would be another place I&#x27;d be 
interested in seeing more of. I could also go for Idaho if someone 
gave me a better description of what kinda sights and sounds that 
has to offer other than seeing Frank in his natural environment. I 
am okay with DC, but there isn&#x27;t anyone there that can host a comp 
for us there (that I know of at least).

I feel that Denver is the most central location so that is one of 
top choices. If we Hunt has time and is willing to organize one in 
Seattle that would be great too. For something like Nationals with 
an expected high turn-out you can&#x27;t go wrong with Idaho if Frank is 
willing to put some time and effort into hosting again.

I am not sure how many cubers are in and around the Chicago area, 
but I don&#x27;t think enough. Michigan cubers are too far spread or too 
involved in school lately (oh and one left this year).

If it is in Toronto, I would be willing to go and act as a WCA 
delagate if necessary... hem I wonder if I&#x27;m allowed to??? I know 
the rules pretty well, and spent a fair amount of free-time pouring 
over them to find things to debate about. I guess I should ask 
before I make any promises. I have not been to Toronto in many 
years... OMG it was WC03! I&#x27;ve been there at least 10 times in the 
past but never stayed long enough to see all the things I wanted to 
see.

If Patterson has time I think we could do a second Midwest 
tournament very successfully. I was very happy with the way the TN 
one was run, although a big part of it must have been Chris. It 
takes more than a single individual to make something like that run 
smoothly. If somebody, say Jon, Jake (retired?), or me coordinates 
with Patterson we could get that going for either Madison, WI or 
Chicago, with at least two cubers from MI gurenteed to go. Although 
I have no idea how busy he is, and I got the idea Jon is quite busy 
these days.

How do ppl feel about Madison, WI btw? I don&#x27;t recall this ever 
being suggested. Detroit, MI? Ann Arbor, MI (40 minutes away)?

Any cubers in Portland btw? I would love to sneak a peak at AMD&#x27;s 
facilities while I&#x27;m there! Also any chance of a TX tournament? 
Dallas (again), Houston, or Austin?

Is anyone here interested in coming up to Seattle for a tournament? My dad
has been wanting to help with a tournament for years, so if people can
actually make it up here then it can definitely be done!

All we need is enough interested people,

          <div class="email-content">You give a country designation here but not in the spreadsheet. I 
think that should be included in the spreadsheet too. So this is a 
very good idea, I really like it, especially that I&#x27;m ranked 29th on 
a world listing of any sort.

Beaten by Craig by one rank again... tisk tisk... I think my weakest 
area would have to be 3x3. This needs to change soon.

Is anyone here interested in coming up to Seattle for a tournament? My dad
has been wanting to help with a tournament for years, so if people can
actually make it up here then it can definitely be done!

All we need is enough interested people,

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I think our idea has been to try to host a major tournament in the
United States every summer.  In 2004, we had US Nationals in Pasadena.  In
2005, we had a summer tournament in Dallas, and in 2006 we had US Nationals
in San Francisco.  So we&#x27;ll get to work on finding something for summer of
2007 that&#x27;s in the summer so hopefully more convenient for everyone to
travel to.

20 competitors would be an especially week tournament, especially for a
major summer competition that was held as an US Open.  Pasadena competitions
get about 60 people... so if we do pull off something like this, I think
we&#x27;d want to be expecting about 50 cubers at least.  This gives you an idea
of the possible locations of a competition.

          <div class="email-content">Don&#x27;t you think you should weigh the different averages ?

Because if you average 25 in the 3x3, it only makes a difference of 10
seconds with someone who averages 15. But the level difference is quite
huge.

But on the 4x4 and especially the 5x5, a 10 second different is a lot less
important.

Do you see what I mean ?
Would it be possible to solve that problem (if you think it is a problem of
course :p) ?

I understand what you are saying of course, but personally, I don&#x27;t
think it&#x27;s a problem. The only thing that is taken into account is how
good you are compared to all the other people in the list, what your
times are in the various events are not important.

Dan :)

          <div class="email-content">Okay, looks like we have some good ideas spreading.  I will make a poll soon and people can vote for the best city.  I will just list a bunch of cities and see where the votes go.  I am thinking that this event would go on in the early summer, maybe sometime in June, this way there will be a little time between this and the Worlds.  I understand that the Worlds does indeed put a lot pressure on the pocket, and some people won&#x27;t be able to attend both.  However, for those who don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t attend Worlds, I think another event is a great idea so those people can compete yearly.  I will post here soon with a poll.

Um... Dan called it &quot;Combined WCA World Rankings for 2006&quot;. No 
restriction to cubes and regular cubing. So I say for &quot;the true all 
around&quot; you need to include *all* events. Though looking at Dan&#x27;s 
list it seems to be a requirement to have a ranking in every event in 
order to be in the list (several top cubers are missing!). So here&#x27;s 
the list covering *all* events:

&lt;begin>
&lt;end>

          <div class="email-content">For the list of cities, you might consider St. Louis, MO as a  choice.  As for potential competitiors, I&#x27;ll talk to my club at  school and see if we can&#x27;t get some funds together and try to make a  group trip.  I asked my dad if I would be able to travel and got  the all-famous response: &quot;we&#x27;ll see&quot;.  I think if we got our  pennies together, we could get a good number from my school to  go.  We have a meeting tomorrow so I&#x27;ll see what we can do.

I will make a poll soon  and people can vote for the best city. I will just list a bunch of  cities and see where the votes go. I am thinking that this event would  go on in the early summer, maybe sometime in June, this way there will  be a little time between this and the Worlds. I understand that the  Worlds does indeed put a lot pressure on the pocket, and some people  won&#x27;t be able to attend both. However, for those who don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t attend  Worlds, I think another event is a great idea so those people can  compete yearly. I will post here soon with a poll.

Somewhat confirmed in this article a French cuber mailed me:
http://www.tulsaworld.com/NewsStory.asp?ID=061004_Ne_A2_Propo36352

&quot;long considered part of the French fabric&quot;

&quot;France&#x27;s smoker-friendly culture where cigarettes have long been 
identified with cool, and where smoky bistros are still redoubts of 
Paris&#x27; intelligentsia.&quot;

&quot;Even the French presidency&#x27;s Web site shows a photo of a young 
President Jacques Chirac in a James Dean-like pose with a cigarette 
in his mouth.&quot;

But I&#x27;m glad they seem to go in the right direction. In my report I 
purposely said I won&#x27;t visit &quot;this&quot; France again, meaning if it 
changes enough I might go there again.

In Germany I think smokers aren&#x27;t smoking to become cool but to avoid 
being uncool. Both nonsense of course, as smoking doesn&#x27;t make you 
cool but only anti-social. But what I mean is that German smokers are 
just plain dumb and smoke because others do it, not because it has a 
touch of intelligentsia. Ok, that maybe still doesn&#x27;t make it 
clearer. But I don&#x27;t want to think about it more right now.

  For the list of cities, you might consider St. Louis, MO as a choice. As for potential competitiors, I&#x27;ll talk to my club at school and see if we can&#x27;t get some funds together and try to make a group trip. I asked my dad if I would be able to travel and got the all-famous response: &quot;we&#x27;ll see&quot;. I think if we got our pennies together, we could get a good number from my school to go. We have a meeting tomorrow so I&#x27;ll see what we can do.

I will just list a bunch of cities and see where the votes go. I am thinking that this event would go on in the early summer, maybe sometime in June, this way there will be a little time between this and the Worlds. I understand that the Worlds does indeed put a lot pressure on the pocket, and some people won&#x27;t be able to attend both. However, for those who don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t attend Worlds, I think another event is a great idea so those people can compete yearly. I will post here soon with a poll.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Dave,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll answer these as best as I can based on my experience:<br>
<br>
&gt; What should one expect the event to cost?<br>
Rutgers charges me $150-200 for rental of the room + equipment<br>
(staging, microphone, etc) <br>
<br>
&gt; How does one pay for all these costs?<br>
They fund me.  I&#x27;m on a budget.<br>
<br>
&gt; How do you estimate the number of expected competitors?<br>
I base that estimate on previous competitions held in the same area.<br>
<br>
&gt; How do you estimate the number of expected spectators? <br>
Who cares?  People will show up to watch.  Just make sure you have<br>
plenty of chairs (no one will want to stand).<br>
 <br>
&gt; How do you know the proper time to hold the event so you get the<br>
&gt; maximum turn out?  <br>
I try not to host a competition in the same week of another<br>
competition around here.  That would be silly.  Other than that, avoid<br>
hosting a competition somewhere remote during a busy week (ie - maybe<br>
exam weeks especially)<br>
<br>
&gt; How and where do you get all the required equipment? <br>
Rutges bought them for me and the rest are donated.  Just ask.<br>
<br>
&gt; How do you ensure it will be sanctioned by the WCA (i.e. what if a<br>
&gt; delegate doesn&#x27;t want to make the trip)?<br>
Become one.  If you&#x27;re trusted and well-known in the community, I<br>
don&#x27;t think this is really a problem.<br>
<br>
&gt; I am very interested in putting together a competition here in the<br>
&gt; Toronto area to help the cubing community, and to give back for all<br>
&gt; the competitions us few Canadians have attended.  But I really don&#x27;t<br>
&gt; know how to go about organizing it all.  Others have done it, and<br>
&gt; surely made mistakes that new organizers can learn from.  We are all<br>
&gt; about sharing information in this community, but it hasn&#x27;t seemed to<br>
&gt; extend to this aspect yet.  Any help, advice or answers to the<br>
&gt; aforementioned questions would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
DONT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, you could have ratios, for example, let&#x27;s say the average for
the world at 3x3 was 30sec, and the average for 4x4 was 2min. Let&#x27;s
say I averaged 20 on the 3x3 and 1:20 on the 4x4. Then, I have 1.5 and
1.33 respectively. Adding those together gives me a point value of
2.83. The higher the better. :)

We need mixed teams though :D Norway is like me, Geir Ugelstad and

The order/payment procedure from rubiks is indeed a bit strange, but 
it is legit. I ordered there twice and got the same emailadres. The 
first order arrived after a week (UPS), the second took a little over 
2 months (CanadaPost).

After an opposing feedback I think I should clarify that term.

From:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social

I meant this:
&quot;public behavior that lacks judgement and consideration for others 
and may cause them or their property damage&quot;

Not this:
&quot;those who perceived to be excessively introverted&quot;

That would be very fast in case of a parity.

Gilles, I think there are 22 parity-PLL&#x27;s, because there are also 22
normal PLL&#x27;s (include solved case). But correct me if I am wrong.

I guess I will see you both at Dutch open.

Yes that has the same effect, but it&#x27;s not the same algorithm 
though!! Fredericks algorithm is exactly what u get when combining 
Stefans permutation parity fix and a corner 3-cycle, with one move 
cancelling ;-)

Cheers!

-Per

PS! There is 2 varieties of Stefan&#x27;s permutation parity fix. The one 
i gave earlier and this one : (Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2. The 
latter is the correct one to combine with corner 3-cycle. My 
apologies for any confusion :D

pieces a few at a time until everything&#x27;s where it should be). She
then asked, &quot;But how do you know when you&#x27;re done?&quot;

Of course it&#x27;s useful if u can recognize it in one look and hence 
save one look. But like Stefan im not a fan of memorising lots of 
algs. Of course in the long run the more algs u learn the faster u 
will get. My main point was to clarify what ur algorithm is doing. 
Not really from a speeding perspective. Maybe I&#x27;M the wrong on the 
wrong forum ;-) It wasn&#x27;t a brand new construction as such as u used 
2 well known parts and combined them ;-) One can take many 
combinations like this and find some cancellation and learn it...

Is it a better forum if u have no response ?? ;-)

Happy cubing :-)

<br>
I always allude to commutators if they&#x27;ve never heard of them, or if<br>
they have any sort of math background I just tell them that<br>
commutators are the trick.<br>
<br>
I mean think about most beginner solutions, almost all the algorithms<br>
are commutators, or just simpler conjugates, especially for the LL.<br>
<br>
If there is &quot;one trick&quot;, then in my opinion commutators are it, but of<br>
course there might even be an easier way.  I just know that it&#x27;s<br>
possible to come up with 100% intuitive solutions to a puzzle using<br>
solely commutators which would count as an &quot;easy&quot; trick to solve it.<br>
<br>
But I agree, in general other than the commutator answer I have no<br>
idea what to say to the &quot;So what&#x27;s the trick anyway?&quot; question.<br>

Ur alg is doing exactly same as Fredricks. It&#x27;s just some symmetry

Fredericks ;-)

offering it.

Let&#x27;s not forget the work that goes into finding these sorts of 
algorithms. I have read a lot of messages trivializing this, and it 
doesn&#x27;t make me happy.

I wonder how many more 4x4 PLLs remain...

          <div class="email-content">I tend to ask questions back...

They go &quot;Is there a trick to that&quot;? I say &quot;Depends on what you mean 
by trick.&quot;

After that, whatever words they use I just make them define it... at 
some point they will reaize that they original question was pretty 
non-sensical.

Same with &quot;Is there a formula involved?&quot;... I&#x27;ll ask &quot;what would you 
consider a formula?&quot; (sometimes I smile sometimes I don&#x27;t, depends 
on their personality)

&quot;Is there a pattern?&quot; &quot;This thing is full of patterns. There are 
patterns all around you; there&#x27;s a pattern to every aspect of the 
world in which we live.&quot; (At this point they think you are either 
crazy or eccentric, but either way it opens up more interesting 
coversation.) Bascially, just get through the inital annoying 
questions and don&#x27;t fret on them.

But of course at some point, I know enough math mumbo jumbo to give 
the really lengthy textbook answers that would be way over their 
head and then wish they never asked the question in the first place. 
That is if they are just being plain dull.

The ones left standing will be the ones worth talking to about 
cubing.

Chris is absolutely right though, commutators are the way to 
approach any new mechanical puzzle, and so if you had to pick a 
single thing to answer someone&#x27;s legitamate question with, that&#x27;d be 
it. Also I thought what Stefen said about solving &quot;U&quot; with 
commutators was really funny, that takes genius to catch that so 
quickly. I totally laughed when I read that.

&gt; say to that? <br>
<br>
I think this is a pretty innocent and valid question. If I used<br>
Fridrich, my might say &quot;the trick is that if you divide the solution up<br>
into stages, then each stage may only have a small number of possible<br>
cases making it possible to memorise solutions to solve very possible<br>
case that comes up.&quot;<br>
<br>
If they ask &quot;is there a pattern?&quot; or &quot;is there a sequence?&quot;, I might say<br>
&quot;there isn&#x27;t a single pattern or sequence that you can learn which, by<br>
repeated application, can trivially solve the cube. But many people do<br>
use a *set* of patterns or sequences. For example, one for a 3 corner<br>
rotation, one for a 3 edge rotation, etc... Experts just tend to use a<br>
larger set and therefore know more shortcuts.&quot;<br>

  I think this is a pretty innocent and valid question. If I used
  Fridrich, my might say &quot;the trick is that if you divide the solution up
  into stages, then each stage may only have a small number of possible
  cases making it possible to memorise solutions to solve very possible
  case that comes up.&quot;
  
  If they ask &quot;is there a pattern?&quot; or &quot;is there a sequence?&quot;, I might say
  &quot;there isn&#x27;t a single pattern or sequence that you can learn which, by
  repeated application, can trivially solve the cube. But many people do
  use a *set* of patterns or sequences. For example, one for a 3 corner
  rotation, one for a 3 edge rotation, etc... Experts just tend to use a
  larger set and therefore know more shortcuts.&quot;

More like this:
(Rr)2 B2 [B2 U&#x27; F2 U B2 U&#x27; F2 U] U2 r2 U2 B2 (Rr)2

I.e. clearly separating the two algorithms (inner and outer). But 
your version helped me getting that.

Maybe not as quickly as you think. I&#x27;ve been nitpicking about this in 
the past at least once and the others are right, I should stop it.

Commutators are always even permutations, quite trivial to realise. 
Two differents parts are done, first forward then backwards. 
Regardless if the parts are even or odd the totality ends up even. 
Which again means only exactly half of the cube positions may be 
reachable with commutators. That they actually ARE reachable is also 
not that hard to prove. But i leave that as an exercise for now :D

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Frederick :-)

For PLL including permutation parity there is exactly ((4!)^2)/2 
cases before doing symmetry reductions, total 288 cases. I haven&#x27;t 
really tried to figure out how many that will be after symmetry 
reductions but i guess it&#x27;s maybe more than the 21 for normal PLL. 
Or does it have to be the same? Im not sure. Anyway, that&#x27;s quite a 
lot extra algorithms :D

I agree with Stefan it would be nice to have a simple corner-swap 
permutation parity fix too. All i have come up with is to combine T-
perm or N-perm with the edge permutation parity fix (Chris&#x27; or 
Stefans). But i haven&#x27;t found good cancellation scenarios, hence 
those algs would be too long to be useful ...

And also i don&#x27;t use the pairing-up solving, so my motivation for 
finding algs that are not part of my own way of solving 4x4x4 (or 
5x5x5) is not too high.

Plaisir!

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I agree with Stefan it would be nice to have a simple corner-swap <br>
&gt; permutation parity fix too. All i have come up with is to combine T-<br>
&gt; perm or N-perm with the edge permutation parity fix (Chris&#x27; or <br>
&gt; Stefans). But i haven&#x27;t found good cancellation scenarios, hence <br>
&gt; those algs would be too long to be useful ...<br>
<br>
Hi Per =)<br>
<br>
I got one T-perm + Chris-swap that is not so long but it does not do <br>
two corners but four:<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know how you denote three layers. I will write like (Rrl) for <br>
those, hope it&#x27;s understandable =)<br>
<br>
(Llr)2 (Ddu)&#x27; R2 (Ddu) (Llr)2 (Ffb)2 (Ddu) B2 (Ddu)&#x27; .. (Ff)2 .. U2 <br>
b2 (Uu)2 b2 u2<br>
<br>
At the dot&#x27;s the algs merge and saves one move. Is this one useful?<br>
<br>
But me, I&#x27;m using a direct solve method and uses CLL as the first LL-<br>
step so I want use that alg =) I got a number of more tricky PLL&#x27;s <br>
that solves mixed edges but leave the corners undisturbed.<br>
<br>
Try this for example: R&#x27; F&#x27; r&#x27; F&#x27; L F r l F&#x27; L&#x27; F l&#x27; F R<br>
Or this one: r U&#x27; r&#x27; U l&#x27; U l U2 r U r&#x27; U l&#x27; U&#x27; l<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

As we said there are 14 PLL cases for the 333 ( including solved state ) :
http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/solutions_p1.html

I think there 15 PLL parity cases for the 444 (excluding symetric and 
inverse), but for 2 of them we need to learn inverse too :
http://frederickbadie.free.fr/444PLLparity.html

But may be, I&#x27;m wrong.
Good night and good week.

Frederick,

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I think the exact count for cases also depends on how u choose to 
recognize each case. Dan Harris lists 21 PLL cases for 3x3x3 on his 
site:

http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/index.php?page=3x3x3/cfop/pll/pll

Anyway i&#x27;m not an expert on this since i don&#x27;t even use the Fridrich 
(CFOP) method ;-)

L8r :D

Yes :-)

We need mixed teams though :D Norway is like me, Geir Ugelstad and 
maybe Terje Kristensen or Eivind Fonn. Unless we have some other 
anonymous cubers here, but i doubt it :-o

I think Stefan makes a valid point - Chris used words like 100% and solely, but only half 
the positions can be solved by commutators.

Actually... I just realized how much more powerful commutators are 
then I ever imagined. Here&#x27;s how to orient a single (!) corner in 
place without changing *anything* else of the cube. Consider the 
commutator PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; with P=pullSomeCornerOutOfTheCube and 
Q=rotateTheCube. You might have to use a loose cube, though...

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Frederick said he is waiting for the missing solutions. I think he was
encouraging people to help him find algs for those cases.

Anyway, I whipped together a simple 4x4x4 optimal solver today.
Assuming my program works correctly, there is no solution for the
adjacent corner swap case in 12 moves (slice turn metric) or less.

          <div class="email-content">If it doens&#x27;t take terribly long, I was curious about the cases where 
only edge permutation is effected. A lot of cubers use COLL now and so 
I think those algs would help a lot.

I just spent an hr thinking about how I could manipulate ACube into 
doing it somehow, but I am pretty sure it can&#x27;t be done using ACube. 
I&#x27;m too busy to write a new program myself... though it probably would 
not be efficent enough.

You could restrict to only using &lt;L,l,r,R,U,u>, that should speed 
thigns up, find ones that are intersting and should suffice.

It is for the 4x4 PLL where the corners are done and you need a non-<br>

Maybe someone here can clean that up a bit...


For the two corners adj case... note that 20 is the slice count for 
the number of turns it takes to do a T-Perm followed by Chris&#x27;s 
Permutation Parity (Dedge Swap as some ppl call it). I don&#x27;t think I 
can improve on that, but this was the subsequent case I started 
working on.

This may be a bit of topic but still it&#x27;s 4x4x4 PLL&#x27;s.

I made a page for my mixed dedged PLL&#x27;s:

http://members.chello.se/solgrop/kub/4x4x4_PLL.htm

If anyone got a shorter alg for &quot;CASE 8&quot; then I will be glad to hear 
abuot it =)

These algs is the fourth step in my 4x4x4 LL. At first I use CLL for 
corners and then I solve one dedge, both orientation and permutation. 
During the first two steps I orient as much as possible of the rest 
of the edges, in my third step I do the rest of the orientation (step 
2 and 3 are often done in one alg). Then I end it using my 3-dedge 
PLL&#x27;s.

For the 5x5x5 I do the same thing but there I got an extra step after 
CLL. There I solve the mid edges using a 3x3x3 ELL-alg. Then I solve 
the dedges as it was a 4x4x4.

I&#x27;m also using CLL+ELL for the 3x3x3 and CLL is also useful for a 
2x2x2 2-step method, (I&#x27;m using it as a part of my Ortega step 2+3 
method). So I&#x27;m using the same LL-algs for all sizes of cubes but 
extra steps are added for the larger ones. I also using 
the &quot;Freeslice-F2L/F3L/F4L...&quot; for all sizes above the 2x. I think 
it&#x27;s a good aproach =)

  Hey guys,

  I just got my first sub 14 average:

Well that&#x27;s technically a commutator yes. But with quite illegal 
operators. Legal operators are still only UDFBRL turns. As long as 
we do proper commutators we could then still allow slice turns and 
cube turns as the orientation of the core will be retained after a 
commutator anyhow.

But still i&#x27;d like to stress the difference between that commutators 
MAY reach half of all cube positions and that they are actually 
capable of doing this. The latter requires a stronger proof than 
just odd/even considerations ...

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">I often get &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s JUST a formula to solving it.&quot;  Like somehow
it&#x27;s not difficult because the cube can be reduced to patterns and
math.  Or that knowing how to solve the cube every time is cheating. 
Apparently, the only &quot;legit&quot; way to solve is to randomly turn sides
and peel stickers until it&#x27;s solved.

Which leads me to this one: &quot;When I was a kid, I used to peel off the
stickers.&quot;  Awesome.  That&#x27;s how I do it too.  Care to try to peel off
the paint on my speedcube?

And verbatim, I hear all the time &quot;Isn&#x27;t there like a set pattern to
solving it?&quot;  I usually respond, &quot;Yes, the pattern is to have all the
greens on one side, all the whites on another....&quot;  I love it.  The
usual response is an eye roll and shutting up.

This might be one of my favorites: &quot;Theoretically, any Rubik&#x27;s cube
can be solved in 4 moves.&quot;  That&#x27;s when I hand the cube over and have
them show me these 4 awesome moves.  It hasn&#x27;t happened yet.

I almost forgot: &quot;One time, I saw this Chinese kid solve the cube in
like 4 seconds on TV.  Can you do it that fast?&quot;

I&#x27;d like to take a stab at this proof because I think the result is<br>
very interesting.<br>
<br>
The short of it for people who don&#x27;t like my longer posts: solve the<br>
cube using any BLD method that uses only commutators for it&#x27;s algs. <br>
Since you know you will be solving an even position on the cube (the<br>
condition of what needs to be proved says so) then this will be<br>
possible using only commutators.  Now take the solution you just<br>
generated and perform the inverse on a solved cube.  You have<br>
generated the position you just solved.  However since you can solve<br>
all positions, this means you can generate all positions.  If you<br>
don&#x27;t believe this is strong enough, read the longer proof below.<br>
<br>
The long of it for people who don&#x27;t mind my longer posts.  You&#x27;ve been<br>
forewarned.  This is a constructive proof where I just tell you how to<br>
solve the even permutation cube using only commutators.  If you don&#x27;t<br>
like my longer posts, you at least know what I am saying in the post<br>
and what my strategy is.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m almost 100% certain this is not the most efficient proof, and I<br>
know you guys will tear me apart about that, but I think it is at<br>
least *a* proof.  If I am wrong and it is not even *a* proof, then<br>
please feel free to tear my proof apart ;-)  I do not mean this to be<br>
the most elegant proof possible, but simply *a* proof.<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
All I do basically is BLD solving now lol, so this was the first thing<br>
that came to mind.<br>
<br>
Take any one of the 21,626,001,637,244,928,000 even permutations on<br>
the cube.<br>
<br>
The number of clockwise twists on the corners for that cube will be<br>
congruent to 0 (mod 3) because I have selected the positions out of<br>
the total 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible positions on the cube,<br>
meaning this even position must follow the rules of all positions as<br>
far as corner twists and edge flips go.<br>
<br>
The number of flipped edges will be congruent to 0 (mod 2) for the<br>
same reason.<br>
<br>
The definition of when a corner is twisted is the same as for BLD<br>
cubing, I can list the hierarchy of faces and the conditions that lead<br>
to a corner being twisted or an edge being flipped if you want a more<br>
complete proof, but I&#x27;ll assume the reader has at least a definition<br>
of flipped edges and twisted corners based on some BLD cubing method.<br>
<br>
It is possible to twist the UFR corner clockwise using the following<br>
algorithm which I will call G.<br>
<br>
G: U L U&#x27; L&#x27; U L U&#x27; L&#x27;<br>
<br>
I can twist a corner counter clockwise using the following algorithm H.<br>
<br>
H: U L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27; U&#x27; L<br>
<br>
Now I can flip corners on the R face using commutators.<br>
<br>
The commutator G and H combined with R face moves can now twist<br>
corners in all combinations on the R face, assuming the number of<br>
clockwise twists of the corners on the R face is congruent to 0 (mod<br>
3).  As an example try the algorithm G R G&#x27; R&#x27; to see what form these<br>
commutators take.<br>
<br>
To twist corners on the L face, simply rotate the algorithms I gave<br>
across the LR plane.<br>
<br>
If the sum of the clockwise twists on the L face and R face<br>
individually are not congruent to 0 (mod 3) then you will be left with<br>
one corner on the R face that is twisted and one on the L face that is<br>
twisted after applying the above strategy.  Simply use a setup move to<br>
put both corners on the R face.  This can be done because a conjugate<br>
of a commutator, which is still a commutator.<br>
<br>
So do the setup algorithm J followed by any commutator made from the<br>
algorithms G and H above, using the R face as well.  An example:<br>
J A R A&#x27; R&#x27; J&#x27; where J=L&#x27;U&#x27;; A is as defined above; and R is the usual<br>
face turn R.<br>
<br>
Ok so corners are all twisted correctly now.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
For the edges use the following algorithm:<br>
<br>
N: R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F<br>
<br>
Use that algorithm in the following commutator:<br>
N E&#x27; N&#x27; E<br>
<br>
where E is the usual E slice turn that turns the middle between U and<br>
D as if you were turning the D layer.<br>
<br>
This flips the edges at FR and BR.  Assuming a flipped edge is<br>
somewhere else on the cube then use any setup algorithm J that puts<br>
two flipped edges into FR and BR to perform the following commutator:<br>
<br>
J N E&#x27; N&#x27; E J&#x27; to flip the FR and BR edges then return the edges back<br>
to their starting points.<br>
<br>
For those who don&#x27;t believe I understand how a conjugate of a<br>
commutator is also a commutator this is the commutator X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; where<br>
X=J N J&#x27; and Y=J E&#x27; J&#x27;<br>
<br>
Ok so now the edges are flipped correctly.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
We&#x27;re down to the cycling of pieces to their correct location.  I will<br>
break this down into the cycles for the corners and for the edges.<br>
<br>
The overall corner cycle, because this is an even permutation on the<br>
cube, have an even number of odd component cycles.  By component<br>
cycles I mean all the cycles that together add up to the total overall<br>
permutation on the corners.  This is simply the definition of an even<br>
permutation on the cube for corners.<br>
<br>
Even cycles can be solved using commutators.  Take any cycle (ABCDEFG)<br>
and do the cycle (ABC) followed by (ADE) followed by (AFG) to solve. <br>
Do this using freestyle commutators, or when necessary a commutator<br>
with a setup move, making it a conjugated commutator which is still a<br>
commutator.  If you don&#x27;t know what I mean about freestyle commutators<br>
please read here:<br>
http://s12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?showtopic=207<br>
This is simply a set of rules to follow that will generate a<br>
commutator to solve any 3-cycle necessary.  This may require a setup<br>
algorithm, which still makes it a commutator.<br>
<br>
Odd cycles can be solved down to two remaining pieces.  But because<br>
there are an even number of them we can use commutators to do this.<br>
<br>
Say we are left with the last two pieces of two odd cycles (AB)(CD). <br>
Then do two three cycles composed of freestyle commutators: Do (ABC)<br>
followed by (ADC) to solve those two odd cycles.<br>
<br>
If multiple odd cycles are left at just two pieces, group them into<br>
pairs and solve as above.<br>
<br>
Now the corners are completely solved.  For the edges use the same<br>
approach as the corners for the cycles, simply change the freestyle<br>
commutators to be ones that work for edges, that also preserve edge<br>
orienatation, and the edges will solve by the same strategy.<br>
<br>
Ok the cube is solved and only commutators were used.<br>
<br>
Now for those who think I don&#x27;t know what I am talking about, I have<br>
solved every even permutation but I have not shown that every even<br>
permutation can be reached from the solved state by commutators alone.<br>
 Simply take the solution you just generated by solving any one of the<br>
even permutations on the cube and perform the inverse of that solution<br>
on a solved cube.<br>
<br>
You can now generate any even permutation on the cube using only<br>
commutators.<br>

These even positions very close to the solved state seem like they

like two 3-cycles away from solved or anything like that.

It&#x27;s still fairly trivial though.
First consider just the permutations: we just need to show that any even permutation of 
edges and any even permutation of corners can be solved in the commutator subgroup.
Note that A_n is generated by 3-cycles and is also generated by double transpositions (for 
n>4).
Consider the double transposition T=(UF UB)(UR UL).
The commutator TF2T&#x27;F2 cycles the 3 edges UB, UF DF.
Consider the double transposition S=(UFR UFL)(UBR UBL).
SF2S&#x27;F2 is a double transposition (UFR UFL)(DFR DFL).
Now the cube group acts 3-transitively on edges and 4-transitively on corners (and even 
more, but we don&#x27;t need that). So let X be a move taking the 3 edges we want to cycle into 
positions UB, UF, DF and then the product of commutators cycles the 3 edges. 
XTX&#x27;XF2X&#x27;(XTX&#x27;)&#x27;(XF2X&#x27;)&#x27; is a product of commutators that cycles the 3 edges.
Let Y be a move taking the 4 corners we want to double transpose into the positions UFR 
UFL DFR DFL. Then YSY&#x27;YF2Y&#x27;(YSY&#x27;)&#x27;(YF2Y&#x27;)&#x27; is a product of commutators that double 
transposes the 4 corners.
So we can get each 3-cycle of edges, each double transposition of corners and can 
therefore solve any even permutation of edges and any even permutation of corners in te 
commutator subgroup.
Next using the 2-transitivity, we need only show that it is possible to twist some 2 corners 
or to flip some 2 edges in the commutator subgroup to complete the proof (since 
conjugates of commutators are commutators).
For instance, consider any move M that flips the UR and UL edges (and does nothing else).
Then X=(BL)M(L&#x27;B&#x27;)M&#x27; is a commutator that flips the UL and UB edges.
Similarly if M is any move that twists the UFL and UBR corners then 
the commutator F&#x27;MFM&#x27; will twist the UFL and UFR corners.
So the entire cube can be oriented within the commutator subgroup.

Interesting question.

For now i found this: (4 commutators - PQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=[P,Q])

1 : [B&#x27;RF&#x27;R2BR&#x27;F,R] - cycles 3 c/e pairs on R layer
2 : [BU&#x27;FU2B&#x27;UF&#x27;,U] - cycles 3 c/e pairs on U layer
3 : [L&#x27;BL,F&#x27;] - fixes remaining corners
4 : [UL&#x27;U2D2R,U] - fixes remaining edges

Do these one by one 1+2+3+4. Not really very short, 52 turns. Can 
someone find anything better than this??

Cheers!

On the same note, we can flip an edge with &quot;commutator&quot;.
P = pull some edge out of the cube
Q = rotate the cube 180 degrees around the axis between that edge 
and opposite edge. Say if remove UF, then the axis will be the UF/DB 
axis.

Then PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; flips the edge ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey :D

We can do much better than this. We can turn R clockwise then U
counterclockwise with the following:

1 : [U&#x27;DF&#x27;BR&#x27;L,U] - 12 turns because 2 turns cancel out

Now rotate U 180 degrees with the following:

2 : [R&#x27;L&#x27;U2RL,U] - 12 turns

Combined effect is what we want, 24 turns. Over 50% improvement from
my first (silly) attempt :-P

Cheers!

======
PER&#x27;s THEOREM : 20 face turns is the minimum to achieve RU effect on
a Rubik&#x27;s Cube (minus centers orientation) if done purely by 
sequential
commutators.
======

My solution to achieve that is like so:

1 : [R,R&#x27;L&#x27;FB&#x27;UD] - achieves RU&#x27; effect, 12 turns (RR&#x27; cancels)
2 : [R&#x27;L&#x27;U2RL,U] - achieves U2 effect, 12 turns

1+2 results in 20 turns because 4 moves cancel out (RLR&#x27;L&#x27;).
Now this was an awesome result :D I love it !!

Please define precisely what you mean with &quot;sequential commutators&quot; or
I&#x27;ll feed you the mighty [R,z]. Oh well, I demolish you with this anyway:

[D U R2 B F&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27;, U&#x27;]

Dude, I would&#x27;ve expected you to see this. Btw, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s
optimal even just for this idea as I didn&#x27;t try all possibilities. And
thanks to Ron for his online solver, I don&#x27;t have my regular computer
here right now.

          <div class="email-content">I was expecting the people interested in this thread to actaully 
perform it and see for themselves... I hope everyone that bothers to 
read this thread actually has a 4x4 on them.

It swaps the two UR corners while also swapping the adjoining edge 
piece on the u-layer. It preserves everything else.

It is optimal in the domino group, STM. I know because a program 
says it is. It&#x27;s not a useful algorithm, nor was it meant to be.

I was trying to make a half-hearted argument for why 16 should be a 
lower-bound for the alg that Bruce was seeking for swapping two 
corners alone. As it stands, we 4x4 speedcubers typically do a T-
Perm and Permutation Parity Alg (in either order).

It&#x27;s not a very good argument, and I was more interested in seeing 
who would be first to point out all the flaws to it.... since no one 
bothered, I&#x27;ll be the first.

It is possible that an alg exists that does not meet the requirment 
of perserving supercenters less than 16 turns STM that does the same 
thing. Can anybody think of another reason why my argument breaks?

I suppose, what I was trying to do as well, was to motivate people 
to discover parity PLLs and quickly populate that table that 
Fredrick posted a link to. I think this is one way of improving the 
popular 4x4 speedsolving method, and was just trying to show that I 
care.

<br>
But they are right. Such formulae exist. All you need to do is memorise<br>
a formula (whether it be a big/small one) and then apply it according to<br>
the patterns that you get. You don&#x27;t need to understand how the formula<br>
works, and most people don&#x27;t. Even Jessica Fridrich said she doesn&#x27;t<br>
know how many of the OLL formulae, and some of the PLL formulae in her<br>
own system work. Many of these were discovered rather than constructed.<br>
<br>
Whether you yourself use such formulae is another question, but they<br>
certainly do exist, and it is not difficult so solve the cube if you use<br>
them.<br>
<br>
&gt; Or that knowing how to solve the cube every time is cheating. <br>
<br>
This is an extremist view, but yes I agree with it :-) To clarify,<br>
though, my view is that I think it&#x27;s cheating for someone to claim that<br>
they can solve the cube when they have really memorised a solution which<br>
they did not come up with themselves.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m well aware that people will disagree with me. I hope there is at<br>
least one person who will agree, though.<br>
<br>
&gt; Apparently, the only &quot;legit&quot; way to solve is to randomly turn sides<br>
&gt; and peel stickers until it&#x27;s solved.<br>
<br>
Wait, you haven&#x27;t exhausted all other possible ways to solve the cube.<br>
It is possible to solve the cube without knowing anything beforehand<br>
using plain intuition.<br>

Hah!! Why didn&#x27;t i think of that. Well i did, without trying lol. I 
had imagined the layers would go separate ways if doing like that. I 
feel stupid now. Hehe! Ur algorithm cancels 2 moves so it&#x27;s 14 turns 
only. Sweet alg Stefan :D It&#x27;s also ONE commutator, not 2 like my 
solution. Hmmpfff ... lol ... U disproved my Theorem already. So, i 
treat u a smoke free meal next time we meet ;-)

Have fun!

country for speedcubers because there aren&#x27;t any shops selling Stack<br>

with you with my idea of extremely cheap home made chronometer.<br>
<br>

.Maybe it seems to be poor(it is in comparison with Stack Mat :P ) but<br>
it works perfectly for me.<br>
<br>
http://eurobos.pl/tomek/timer/mov00068.3gp =&gt; This is a short movie<br>
showing how my chronometer works.It begins measuring the time after<br>
pressing touch sensors(it&#x27;s diffrent from the Stack Mat&#x27;s sensors<br>

either while using Stack Mat or TOM&#x27;s MAT  :) .Enjoy and have fun .<br>

Well yeah it&#x27;s easy to see the effect (except centers) but &quot;what it
does&quot; actually is &quot;the obvious effect AND the restriction to domino
moves&quot;. But there was no way I could tell what restriction you used.
And I was quite sure you didn&#x27;t prove optimality in general but only
with a restriction. The major flaw is that there could very well be an
 alg achieving the same effect but with fewer moves, if you allow all
moves and not just domino ones.

Oops... good that I didn&#x27;t write the length so you&#x27;ll never know
whether I saw the cancellation.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be 8!, since there&#x27;s no fixed reference point.  
Say the DBL corner is solved, there&#x27;s only 7! now.
Then you can freely turn the U face 4 ways, so it&#x27;s 7!/4.  Still 
1260 algorithms...plus the orientation algs.  And I can&#x27;t imagine 
fast recognition on permuting all pieces.

And they can&#x27;t be too long, it&#x27;s just 2x2 after all.  Isn&#x27;t God&#x27;s 
Algorithm 11 moves or less?

However, I think a completely algorithm-based method is not a good 
idea.  Wasn&#x27;t someone learning to do one face, then COLL plus 
permute first face?  That&#x27;s like 120 algs...I&#x27;m not sure how much 
better or worse that would be than COLL.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s true, I forgot about that flexibility with the 2x2.  I guess if it&#x27;s
any consolation, practically speaking in a competition environment, the 15
seconds inspection would be valuable for a method like this.  Though I can&#x27;t
imagine anyone spending this much time on the 2x2 when ZB for the 3x3 seems
more valuable.

That doesn&#x27;t mean I wouldn&#x27;t like to see someone try.  The average time for
a 2x2 is already like... 4 seconds or something right?  I think that this
proposed method of solving the 2x2, even if it takes fewer moves, might not
be as fast because many COLL algorithms fit very well with the hands.  The
ones with all corners in the right places can be solved with two-generators
as well.

          <div class="email-content">(I deleted an earlier post around 24 hours ago because I wanted to
revise it, after thinking about it awhile. This is my revised post.)

By domino group, I can see Doug means the group for the Rubik&#x27;s Domino
puzzle, and he is saying that his alg is optimal for STM for that puzzle.

But inner slice moves of the Domino puzzle correspond to moving two
slices (layers) in a 4x4x4. For the alg Doug mentioned, I count 16
twist turns, but when I count slice turns on a 4x4x4, I get 23. U
slice: 7 turns, u slice: 7 turns, F slice: 3 turns, B slice: 3 turns;
total: 23 slice turns. His count is correct, of course, for Domino
itself. As Stefan pointed out the increased number of STM moves of the
4x4x4 (versus the Domino) may make it possible to find shorter 4x4x4
solutions than for Domino for equivalent positions.

To me, (U u) is a single &quot;twist&quot; turn, but moves two slices (layers),
U and u, so I would call that two slice turns. On the other hand, u is
a single slice turn (only one slice/layer is moved), but it requires
the cube being twisted at two different planes, so I would count u as
two twist turns. It&#x27;s been my assumption that slice turn metric (STM)
means only one layer can be moved (quarter turn or half turn) for what
is counted as a single move. If that is different from what others
view 4x4x4 STM to be, let me know. There seems to be generally less
standardization on bigger cubes in terms of terminology and notation
than with the 3x3x3.

Of course, one could use a metric for the 4x4x4 such that double layer
turns would count as single moves. That would probably better
correspond to how many people actually count alg lengths for the 4x4x4.

I noticed that Jaap once posted an analysis of the centres/centers of
the 4x4x4 in what he called single slice q+h metric. I assumed that he
means moving any single layer a quarter turn or a half turn counts as
one move, while moving two layers counts as two moves. That&#x27;s the same
as what I simply view as STM (for 4x4x4), and what I&#x27;m using in my
optimal solver (and five-stage solver).

On another note, I made a slight change to my optimal solver so it can
use a subset of moves, such as Doug suggested. I tried instead the
moves for stage 4 of my 5-stage solver: { U,U&#x27;,U2,D,D&#x27;,D2,u2,d2,
L2,R2,l2,r2, F2,B2,f2,b2 }. Running for several hours, it came up with
no solutions of length 14 &quot;single slice q+h&quot; moves or less. That&#x27;s for
the adjacent (oriented) corner swap with nothing else (visibly)
changed (assuming centers solved).

I thought Stefan was interested in the adjacent corner swap case, but
I see now he meant adjacent corner swap without moving any centers (or
edges, of course). I should have realized that&#x27;s what he meant. 
Anyway, it looks like the corner swap cases don&#x27;t have algs listed yet
in the web site listed by Frederick. The &quot;big cubes&quot; web site lists
solutions consisting of doing a PLL parity fix alg followed by a PLL
alg (T-perm or N-perm).

Since adjacent corner swap can be done in 18 slice turns (R2 U&#x27; R2 U
R2 B2 U B2 D&#x27; R2 D b2 U2 b2 U2 u2 b2 u2), I thought an optimal solver
might be able to come up with a shorter alg than a T-Perm + PLL parity
fix alg, if such a solution exists. But going out 16 or 17 moves seems
to be a little beyond what my relatively simple optimal solver can do
at this point.

          <div class="email-content">The method I already know the formula&#x27;s for, but I didn&#x27;t learn yet is
indeed make one face and then the rest. But the thing is I&#x27;d like to
explore if there are more methods with the same speed and amount of
algorithms other than this one. For example: seperate lets say the red
and orange face. (like guimond step 1) then there are 3 orientation
cases for both layers (this is reached by a setup move like U or
something). Then solve all in 1 alg. But I dunno how many algs this
would be.

I&#x27;m currently learning the method where you do one face and then you
do the rest. I think it&#x27; definitely better then &quot;first face&quot;/COLL for
me, because I&#x27;ve practice a lot on seeing a long way into the solution
during inspection. That way I can see almost always which of the three
cases there will be for the D-layer and I solve it so that it&#x27;s in the
right position for the second step. Sometimes I can also see which
orientation the U-layer will have and in rare cases the whole solve.

I asgree, first face + the rest is &quot;the method&quot;. If you solve one 
layer first then it&#x27;s much harder to find a good starting position 
than it is for only the face. It&#x27;s not rare to find three pices in 
one face with a mixed edge after the scramble, two you get almost 
every time.

Also, if you do one layer then CLL is a bit better than COLL because 
of the shorter algs and you can get even shorter ones if you use a 
special 2x2x2 CLL that not care about edges at all (algs like R2 U2 R 
U2 R2).

Like half a year ago I had algs for all the first face + the rest, 
learned them in about two months so it&#x27;s not that hard to do (forgot 
like 50% of them in another two months =) =) =)

The description of the Exploratorium competition is less than 
flattering.  Too bad the cube doesn&#x27;t illuminate properly, color-
wise I mean.  But maybe we could steal the parts to make a 
functionally twisting glow-cube.

No, I don&#x27;t care about centers except they should stay on their faces.
But inside their faces they can move around freely because at that
point in the solution each face&#x27;s centers have the same color.

          <div class="email-content">My analysis for corner orientation cases was for 3x3x3. If you don&#x27;t
count mirror cases as separate cases, I got a number in the 60&#x27;s (for
two different ways of counting cases). Since for 2x2x2, the corners
don&#x27;t have to be oriented with respect to centers, I think there may
be fewer cases. And if orientation is done first, pre-inspection time
could be used look for ways to to produce one of just a few cases. In
Guimond&#x27;s method, at most two moves (usually 0 or 1) are said to be
required to reduce the cube to one of 16 cases (8 cases and their
mirrors). An additional alignment move may also be required to align
layers for the alg to be performed.

When Bob said 5 unique cases, I am pretty sure he was referring to
corners oriented and in the correct layer. It&#x27;s many more cases if the
corners are oriented but arbitrarily permuted. It&#x27;s very easy to get
from all oriented to all oriented and in the correct layers (Guimond&#x27;s
step 2). Still, permuting the pieces into the correct layers adds a
step to the method, making it three steps, and this thread is about
2-step methods.

I agree with what Tim said about the number of permutation cases,
except that it appears to me additional reductions can be made. You
can do a U layer turn to align the two layers in a desired way before
executing the alg, then turn the U layer again after executing the alg
to align the layers to the solved state. I believe that symmetrical
cases will make this less than a 4x additional reduction. If you don&#x27;t
count mirror cases as separate cases, that would reduce the number
further.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

Maybe u will come to some agreement on number of cases if u detail 
how calculations are done. Maybe u are not trying to calculate the 
same thing? This reminds me of the different numbers i have heard 
for number of case for PLL for the CFOP (Fridrich) method for 3x3x3. 
I have heard 13/14/15/21/22. Maybe there&#x27;s not even a single correct 
answer ??

Cheers!

What&#x27;s ur method for choosing what orientation to orient the edges 
with respect to? ... I mean u can choose either UD axis or LR axis 
or FB axis. You simply count how many edges need to be oriented for 
each case? U have fixed orientation always? Or u even consider the 
corners when choosing? Or other things?

And do u still consider the method where u orient all corners and 
reduce to domino solving in the end?

Cheerio!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

Given the remark &#x27;2 generator algs&#x27;, I am looking at R, U and L moves after 
orienting the edges.
I always have blue face in front and yellow face on top.

So:
= the yellow and white stickers of the 8 U and D edges
and
= the blue and green stickers of the remaining 4 edges
should be on
= U or D face
or
= F or B face, in the E slice

You can orient by:
= putting the flipped edges in groups of 4 on F or B face, then do F or B to 
flip them
= if 2 edges remain, put 1 in U faces, one in middle layer, then do moves 
like F&#x27;UF to flip them (this example flips UR and FR).

One example of a next step is to orient all corners.
This can be done the Guimond way. All Guimond cases have short solutions 
with U, D, R and L moves.
With this start you have all pieces oriented often under 15 moves!

After that there are still many ways to continue...
One of them is to put all middle layer edges into middle layer, leaving 
white and yellow stickers on U and D face.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Re: Commutators and generation (and more) 


Hi :-)

Ok, now for some cool stuff i found based on the commutators i found
for simulating RU turns.

Start with my 2 commutators :

[R,R&#x27;L&#x27;FB&#x27;UD][R&#x27;L&#x27;U2RL,U] now
[R,R&#x27;L&#x27;FB&#x27;UD][R&#x27;L&#x27;U2RL,U&#x27;] will do the same!

As mentioned before this simulates turning R then U. This has
obviously no effect on the centers. If i now solve the cube by U&#x27;R&#x27;
we have rotated R and U centers 90 degrees counterclockwise in what 
seems like 22 turns. However my 2 commutators end with -LRU so U&#x27;R&#x27;
cancels against -RU. This algorithm only turns 2 centers and moves
no other cubies. Notice also that the full sequence will be :

L&#x27;FB&#x27;UDR&#x27;U&#x27;D&#x27;F&#x27;BU2RLU&#x27;R&#x27;L&#x27;U2L

Now we can simply peel off first L&#x27; and L as they only serve as
setup and un-setup for the middle 16 turns with obviously same
effect on centers (the alg ONLY turns centers!!).

Then we have:
FB&#x27;UDR&#x27;U&#x27;.D&#x27;F&#x27;BU2RLU&#x27;R&#x27;L&#x27;U2 (16 turns)*
for rotating 2 centers (U and R) ccw (counterclockwise).

We can do a cyclical shift of this starting after the dot:
D&#x27;F&#x27;BU2RLU&#x27;R&#x27;L&#x27;U2FB&#x27;UDR&#x27;U&#x27;

Now add UR to re-orient the turned centers:
D&#x27;F&#x27;BU2RLU&#x27;R&#x27;L&#x27;U2FB&#x27;UDR&#x27;U&#x27;-UR
gives us
D&#x27;F&#x27;BU2RLU&#x27;R&#x27;L&#x27;U2FB&#x27;UD (14 turns)

This now simulates UR turns with no centers turned.
If we reflect this about UR-DL axis and reverse it we have simulated
doing RU instead. First we get:
LFB&#x27;R2U&#x27;D&#x27;RUDR2F&#x27;BR&#x27;L&#x27; (after reflection) then
RLFB&#x27;R2U&#x27;D&#x27;R&#x27;UDR2F&#x27;BL&#x27; (after inversion)

This is the same as : [RLFB&#x27;R2U&#x27;D&#x27;,R&#x27;]
And in principle that&#x27;s exactly the same idea as Stefan had with
this: [DUR2BF&#x27;L&#x27;R&#x27;,U&#x27;]

Well i at least think this is somehow quite neat :D

Have fun!

-Per

* The previous shortest alg i had for turning U and R ccw was like
this : (R2 U2 R U2 R2 U)*3 (18 turns) So in all this i also found a
new shorter alg for a center-turning case. Niceeeeeee!! :D

          <div class="email-content">Guimond&#x27;s corner orientation algs do not preserve edge orientation.
You can still use those algs by inserting inner slice turns before any
turn that would otherwise turn the blue or green face (or whatever
faces affects edge orientation).

I&#x27;ve been looking at OE followed by OC as well. One method I&#x27;ve looked
at is OE, OC, put corners into correct layers, put edges into correct
layers, permute each layer separately. Two layers may have parity
problem, which also needs to be fixed along the way. I&#x27;m not claiming
this method is necessarily more efficient than other OE first methods,
though.

I&#x27;ll also note that Ryan Heise&#x27;s &quot;Human Thistlethwaite&quot; method is
another EO first method
(http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/human_thistlethwaite_algorithm.html).

I meant to say that the inner slice turn would need to be inserted
before a quarter-turn of a blue or green face. This is not necessary
for half-turns. In the parentheses, I should have said &quot;face turns&quot;
instead of &quot;faces.&quot;

About case 8<br>
Why dont you start with swapping the red edges with r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 <br>
u2 thats a 6 move + a 21 move case left 27 moves total 3 moves better <br>
then 30 :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I messed around with early edge orientation methods for a while and
through that experience I discovered 2 things:

1. The move count, which is one reason EO appeals to people, appears
to be less than a normal method but it actually usually balances out
in the end.
2. The pieces are still everywhere on the cube after EO, making
looking ahead more difficult.

EO is like trying to make a perpetual motion device.

HI Evan,

Maybe this was it:

> of the last layer are already oriented.

I experimented with this during early 2003.

The approach was:

- orient edges
- construct a line on the first layer (2 opposite edges)
- fill in the F2L on either side of the line, using only R/L/U(/D)
  turns.

Often people who use regular Fridrich to solve the F2L end up, by
chance, with oriented edges after the cross. There are some examples of
this on the cube simulator, and whenever that happens, the solver is
able to solve the whole F2L without rotating the cube at all. It looks
kind of cool.

Here is my initial post about it:

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/5114


As for the actual trick to solving the edges, here is an excerpt from my
original post on the topic:

** step 1 **

Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F,B,U,D> group, which I will call G1. That is to
say, put the cube into a position where the cube can be solved by only
using L2,R2,F,B,U,D moves. It helps in this method to think of opposite
colours as the same colour up until you get to step 4. Let&#x27;s call the
left/right colours &quot;green&quot; (these are unimportant in step 1), the
up/down colours red, and the front/back colours white.

Once you get into G1, it is impossible to flip edges, and the only thing
we need to do to get the cube into G1 is to make sure all the edges are
flipped right. First you need to find bad edges that are flipped the
wrong way. A bad edge is one that, if moved to its home position using
only moves from G1, will be flipped the wrong way. (Of course, you don&#x27;t
need to move it there to see that)

There are always an even number of bad edges, between 0 and 12, or 6 on
average. The only way to flip edges to turn the left or right sides 90
degrees, and that will flip the 4 edges on that side. To flip 4 bad
edges, you simply move them all into positions on the left side (for
example), and turn that side 90 degrees. If you have only 2 bad edges,
you can make that into 4 by moving just one of them onto the left side
and turning it. That will change one of the bad edges into 3 (plus the
other one it makes 4).

At end of step 1, you should see no red edges facing to the front or
back, and you should see no white edges facing to the top or bottom. To
the untrained eye, it will look like you have accomplished nothing so
far! Yet, these 12 edges are in a much better position now.

* * * *

Note: The last paragraph should not be taken as a complete specification
for G1, only an observation that holds true. You need to follow all of
the previous steps to ensure that you get to G1.

<br>
OK, here are some credits:  :-)<br>
- Ryan Heise inspired me to investigate orienting edges first<br>
- Sebastien Felix inspired me to investigate orienting corners after that<br>
- Jaap Scherphuis inspired me to investigate orienting LL edges during F2L<br>
<br>
I do think that after orienting edges there are so many ways to continue that it is a bit strange to give credits to someone who thought of one step.<br>
If someone came up with solving a cross of edges first, then should he be credited if someone else comes up with OLL?<br>
<br>
I think we should all give credit to eachother. We are always inspiring each other. :-)<br>
<br>
Bruce, there are algorithms for Guimond corner orientation step that do not change edge orientation. In fact all cases can be solved using only R, L, U and D moves.<br>
<br>
Now I go to Dutch Open... :-)<br>

The &quot;4&quot; means turn upper layer 4*30=120 degrees clockwise. How can you
know what the other numbers mean and not what the &quot;4&quot; means???

In general: (a,b) means: turn U-layer a*30 degrees clockwise and turn
D-layer b*30 degrees clockwise (but from the view above it is
counterclockwise!). And &quot;/&quot; means a twist (turn the right half of the
square-1 180 degrees).

I hope this will help.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Ok here&#x27;s a really easy constructive proof that every even position
on the 3x3x3 cube is reachable by using commutators that only use
FBUDRL turns.

Every position on the cube is reachable by a sequence of turns of
the 6 outer layers :

(m1)(m2)...(mk) - k turns totally

(If it&#x27;s not reachable by such a sequence it&#x27;s not a legal position
of the cube.)

This can be written:

(n1)(n2)...(nj) - where each turn ni is a 90 degrees CLOCKWISE turn
of a layer.

For every EVEN position j must be an even number. Now group this
sequence like so:

((n1)(n2))((n3)(n4))...((n(j-1))(nj))

For each group of 2 consecutive turns there is 3 possible cases:

1: they are on same layer
-> do a [RLU2R&#x27;L&#x27;,U&#x27;] eqivalent alg

2: they are on adjacent layers
-> do a [UDF&#x27;BU2R&#x27;L&#x27;,U&#x27;] equivalent alg

3: they are on opposite layers
-> do a [RLF2B2U2R&#x27;L&#x27;,U&#x27;] equivalent alg

Now the whole sequence (n1)(n2)...(nj) is achieved with commutators
and hence also the sequence (m1)(m2)...(mk). As long as the length
of the sequence is an even number of quarterturns :-)

Cheerio!!

interesting in speed cubing with it.  Unfortunately, the springs are<br>
very tight and i wanted to replace the springs with softer ones. <br>
However, I don;t know the exact dimensions of the springs and<br>
(washers?) i might need if im taking out the original springs.  I have<br>
taken it apart and opened the center caps, so that i have access to<br>
the screws and springs, but I need to go out and buy the replacement<br>
springs.  If anyone (Stefan) could tell me what size spring /washers<br>
are good, that would be great.<br>

That&#x27;s very nice. : )
I hope you weren&#x27;t saying what I wrote was not constructive though, since it was, although 
your post is much more explicit and brief.

I guess I didn&#x27;t prove my assertion about having sufficient transitivity, although it is clearly 
true (indeed the cube has much more transitivity than is needed for my proof) but I did go 
into more detail than I needed for the other parts.
One thing I like about what I wrote is that the exact same proof can be used to show that 
the megaminx can be solved using only commutators (the entire puzzle, since all the 
permutations of corners and edges are even, being generated by 5-cycles, and since the 
megaminx has the necessary levels of n-transitivity).

On the other hand, all you&#x27;d need to do to emulate your proof is show that one side can be 
twisted non-trivially using a commutator (similar to what you&#x27;ve done in 1. above) so I 
imagine you can easily generalize your proof to the megaminx too.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Yes i can quite trivially prove the same on the megaminx. I would as 
a first attempt at this simulate a clockwise turn of one layer on 
the megaminx with this:

1 - cycle 3 adjacent c/e pairs on the layer clockwise with a 
commutator. (1 2 3 4 5) -> (3 1 2 4 5)

2 - cycle 3 other adjacent c/e pairs such as to achieve a c/e-pair 5-
cycle on that layer. (3 1 2 4 5) -> (5 1 2 3 4)

This is now ur generator for doing all possible turns on the 
megaminx ;-) More cleverly it might be done with only one commutator 
i guess :-)

I would have more trouble with my approach to show that every even 
position on the nxnxn cube is reachable with commutators. Your 
approach is more suitable :-)

Cheers!

I looked at Jaap&#x27;s notation and it wasn&#x27;t mentioned.
At first I thought it could be a 120° degrees rotation, but everytime 
I made one of those algs with the &quot;4&quot; I messed up the puzzle...
Now I&#x27;ve tried several times and realized I made some mistake 
somewhere.
Thanx!

PS: Do you use Lars V.&#x27; method?

Yes I use Lars V. method. Only differences is that I know (at least I
should) for every shape the optimal solution (in twist metric) and I
think Lars don&#x27;t know EVERY shape (although he will know the most).
And I (should) do the edge permutation in one step and Lars sometimes
(maybe most of the times) in two steps (because he doesn&#x27;t know every

Maybe some thing URD based?

/ (3,-3) / (3,0) / (-3,0) / (0,3) / (-3,0) /

turns to..

RU2D2&#x27;RU2RD2&#x27;RD2RD2&#x27;R

Someone write a program to convert from one to the other :)

<br>
I played a bit with my Square-1 earlier today and as I do not know<br>
enough algorithms to solve it completely I had to make one myself to<br>
permute 2 corners.<br>
<br>
Here is what I came up with :<br>
<br>
(0,-1) / (3,0) / (-3,0) / (3,-3) / (-3,0) / (0,3) / (-3,0) / (3,0) /<br>
(3,-3) / (0,3) / (3,0) / (-3,0) / (0,1) <br>
<br>
And luckily, this corresponds to a regular J permutation. :-)<br>
<br>
Ok it might not be very optimal but I find it quite nice for that<br>
particular case.<br>

Congratulations with ur awesome results. Especially on square-1 and 
the 4x4x4 cube. Very impressive :D Four world records in 2 days is 
amazing. Was DCD 2006 your first major competition ?

Subject: [Speed cubing group] 4x4x4 Panic

I was at an away football game tonight, as part of the marching band I
have to go, and I was racing my friend with our 4x4x4s when his cube
popped. This is not a good thing in the stands. About five seconds
later, my cube popped in more ways than one. We scrambled all over
the stands until my friend John crawled under the stands and found the
remaining three pieces. I was so worried! On the plus side, I found
two sheets of music belonging to two flute players and a sax reed
under the drums.

For that I (or rather, my solver) would write

/ u3d9/ u3/ u9/ d3/ u9/

but if you want a really compact notation, try Josef J&#x27;s:

|33|30|90|09|90|

(The 33 and 09 aren&#x27;t typos, btw: he takes ANTIclockwise as the 
positive direction for the D face -- which is handy when reflecting 
sequences in a horizontal plane.)

How about

(u3)/ u3d9/ u3/ u9/ d3/ u9/ 

or ((3,0))/(3,-3)/(3,0)/(-3,0)/(0,3)/(-3,0)/ if you prefer?

One more case :

and

Also S = fb&#x27;... not sure if this is standard notation yet.

Hem... the first one is probably longer than doing a 3-cycle and 
then the regular parity alg if you ocunt (L2 R2) as 2 turns.

Sorry, i must have overlooked ur first posting of those. Anyway i 
think i beat u with my entry for #3 ;-)

And yes, MES is not really in use yet for 4x4x4 cube. M = (lr&#x27;), E = 
(u&#x27;d), S = (fb&#x27;). Also bracketing (L2 R2) is not *clear*. Better 
rewrite that as M2 (r2l2) if possible, to really show it is ONE 
move. Besides that M2 is faster also IMHO ;-)

No cancellations, just a T-perm pluss permutation parity. Who will 
find something shorter ?? Some award will be given ;-)

Last contribution tonight, case N°6:

F2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L F2 R&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; (Rr)2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 - 15 turns

Yes, J-perm pluss a permutation parity :-)

And an improved case N°10:
B2 L U L&#x27; B2 R D&#x27; r2 F2 r2 (Ff)2 r2 f2 R D R2 - 16 turns

(J-perm with inserted permutation parity)

I think only 2 cases are missing now, case N°11 and case N°12.
Bon nuit :D

What about cases like 2 and 3 but with the second turn in the other

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan :-)

Im infected by chatting language, so i tend to type *ur* not *your* 
when i should be typing more formally.

Ok, if u read properly my proof, the sequence:

((n1)(n2))((n3)(n4))...((n(j-1))(nj))

has solely CLOCKWISE turns. So every double turn or counterclockwise 
turn is rewritten with 2 or 3 turns respectively ;-)

Besides, u know that i have commutators for the mentioned cases 
also. Nitpicking Stefan ;-)

Enjoy!

  I was at an away football game tonight, as part of the marching band I
  have to go, and I was racing my friend with our 4x4x4s when his cube
  popped. This is not a good thing in the stands. About five seconds
  later, my cube popped in more ways than one. We scrambled all over
  the stands until my friend John crawled under the stands and found the
  remaining three pieces. I was so worried! On the plus side, I found
  two sheets of music belonging to two flute players and a sax reed
  under the drums.

Ah right, I missed that, sorry. I guess I was unconsciously expecting 
a proof that every alg can be written with clockwise quarter turns 
and because of that didn&#x27;t realize what you said. There go all my 
hopes to become NWC...

I like the idea very much, btw.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

No, i have used well known standard PLL sequences and combined them 
with some variation of permutation parity fix. Sometimes i found the 
following permutation parity useful : U2 r2 U2 (r2 (Uu)2)*2 Not to 
mention that i also keep track of the edges so that sometimes the 
edges i use for the permutation parity are not at UF/UB or UR/UL 
positions. For case N° 12 for instance, they are at UR and DR 
positions :-)

          <div class="email-content">I never learned that base Y-Perm you used, once I got used to that, 
then I understood how you came up with those, and how you sneaked in 
the cancellation.

I pretty much only know 1 alg for every PLL case, since I don&#x27;t use 
it very much.

For Y-Perm, I&#x27;ve always done:
FRU&#x27;R&#x27;FDR&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27;BR2D&#x27;F2
=> F(RU&#x27;R&#x27;b)(RU&#x27;y)(R&#x27;U&#x27;R)z(R2&#x27;F&#x27;U2)x&#x27;

I use that parity alg, r2U2r2(Uu)2r2u2, for my 4x4 solving so it 
seemed very familiar. I&#x27;ll have to look at the other ones more 
carefully now, to see if I can figure out how they work.

In other news... I&#x27;m currently averaging faster in practice on 5x5 
than 4x4... how weird is that?

          <div class="email-content">I ran into a little problem just now.

After getting a little bit boared with regular solving of the 5x5, I 
started scrambling and solving in the &lt;R,U,u> group and that is pretty 
fun. I have been doing it for a few weeks now and have been going for 
speed with it. Btw, it is possible to get the wing permutation parity 
this here. On my very first try I didn&#x27;t run into any problems.

I just tried to scramble and solve in the &lt;R,Uu> group... I&#x27;m so stuck.

Anyone have any good solutions to this?

FOr &lt;R,U,u>, I just do centers, group the edges, do a parity alg if 
needed and then the regular 3x3 &lt;RU> subgroup solve, which I&#x27;m 
comfortable with. Sometimes I solve the two uL wings right after 
centers or even during as a variation to this method. I can group the 
other edges while preserving those two wings.

For &lt;R,Uu> if I try that I get stuck after centers.

I think this might be a lot similar to the &lt;R,u> subgroup on the 3x3, 
which is somethign I never tried, but thanks to this, I guess I should 
give it a try first perhaps.

Any ideas?

  Hi Michael :-)

  Congratulations with ur awesome results. Especially on square-1 and 
  the 4x4x4 cube. Very impressive :D Four world records in 2 days is 
  amazing. Was DCD 2006 your first major competition ? 

  Keep it up!

You think it might not be possible to underrate him? I.e. however low

          <div class="email-content">SWEET! Another competition for me to go to. Nov 18, hem... Oh right, 
that&#x27;s the same date as Rutgers, so I&#x27;m already committed. Darn.

Berkeley is pretty big, there might be a lot more interest then at 
first glance. Be sure to advertise it well. I&#x27;m thinking color 
flyers at major points, around the CS/CE area, and the math dept 
(floors 7,8,9 of Evans) would be helpful. I think there are math 
grads there that know how to cube and wouldn&#x27;t mine spending a 
weekend afternoon meeting cubers. 10th floor is where they hold a 
weekly math club... I always think that competitions always tend to 
be under-advertised locally. Or perhaps you can&#x27;t support having too 
many people.

Since I&#x27;m curious, and appearently a few other ppl here would like 
to know about planning tournaments:
How many people do you plan on attending?
What is the max you think can be supported?
How many rounds of main 3x3?
Any sorts of funding issues you have to deal with?
Is there a registration fee attached?

Might find competitors by posting at a local HS too.

Bob&#x27;ll be serving food and breverages... well just pizza and pop. 
That was a major reason I chose to go to his :). Maybe you can do 
the same.

Sorry, in advance, for all the annoying questions.

Only I don&#x27;t think most people know how to, so Stefan&#x27;s option is
probably the way to go :)
A good minx is not equal to good times but good times are equal to a
good minx...(or whatever)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,
I just started this club within the last few weeks.  My friends and I
have wanted to host a tournament for a while now and I started looking
into it a few weeks ago.  I found out that clubs here can reserve
rooms without cost and so my first objective was to form a club.  I
completed that on Friday, reserved a room and that was that.  I don&#x27;t
really know how many people I think will attend but I know there are a
good number of cubers around this area that will come and also, there
are my students in the speedcubing class that will come (or I will
fail them all! =p.... not really).  The room I reserved is a large
lecture hall that can hold over 100 people so I&#x27;m not too worried
about too many people coming.  I think if we have enough people, we
can do 3 rounds but perhaps I&#x27;m being a bit too optimistic.  I really
don&#x27;t know what to expect but I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t be small.  Like
I said before, we can reserve the room for free so funding is not an
issue.  The only reason I would charge a registration fee (if I did it
would probably be only $2 or something small) would be to pay for
prizes and such but I think since this is the first tournament, I&#x27;ll
just pay for it out of my own pocket in hopes that a free tournament
entices more people to come.  Oh, and I also plan to advertise with
fliers in the dorms.  I just need to call their office and see if it
costs anything to do that.  I don&#x27;t really know where else I can
advertise yet.  Oh man, I have to go make a flier now.  Didn&#x27;t even
think of that....

          <div class="email-content">Hey Dan,

Charge $3 to $5.  It&#x27;s at a minimal cost as chess tournaments easily cost
$30 and upwards.  In Reno, entry fee was $140 I think.  Anyway, the small
amount of money will give your club more flexibility in the future and will
help you purchase any incidentals you need for these competitions.

If anything, we should all be giving you more money to get your club
started!  $3 to $5 is definitely trivial.  I don&#x27;t think people should
really complain about $10 actually.  Road races will easily cost $20 or $30
if you&#x27;re a runner.  Every other event out ther has entry fees that are far
more significant, and you&#x27;ll end up putting in a lot of effort, so your life
should be made as easy as possible which means you not having to pay out of
your pocket.

          <div class="email-content">I also think you should charge a bit.
There is no reason for you to pay the championship with money from your own
pocket.

But don&#x27;t charge too much.

At Belgian Open this year, we charged 15 � per person.
The reason was that I had to pay for the room, insurance for the room, food,
drinks and prizes.
But this price made some friends of mine say &quot;I can solve the cube, I would
like to go to a competition but 15� is just too much.&quot;

So Jo�l Heymbeeck and I are working on taking the fee down to 5 � per
competitor for next year.

But really you shouldn&#x27;t pay with your money.
And even if you are not profit focus and that you make profit, just keep the
money to invest in stackmats or cubes for your club or pay for charges for
the next tournament your organise.

Good luck with your championship :)
Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">I was afraid you&#x27;d ask, cause it&#x27;s hard to explain in Dutch and even
harder to explain in English, but here is my best try:
As you know, springs are made of steel wire (don&#x27;t know if this is the
correct word for it though). Now at my model airplane club they have
the right tools. The device is very easy. It is an other steel wire
mounted on a rig. And it is made so you can twist the steel wire with
 a handle. This steel wire is horizontaly. There is also a small bracket. 
You choose the thickness of your steelwire, (I thought I choose 0.6
mm) and you choose the radius it has to become (the thickness of the
steel wire on the device). You mount one end of the steel wire of 0.6
on the bracket. Now you twist the handel around so that the steel wire
of 0.6 is being wired around the steel wire on the device. This way
you can make a spring as long as you want or as long as the steel wire
is on the device. After you have a very long spring. You cut it in
bits. Then I take it to a small grinding machine to make the points
and tops of the spring not damage any part of the puzzle.

I hope you are able to understand some of this...:P

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I guess I understand. Sounds like quite some work, though. And 
not everybody has access to a device and the wire material like that. 
Plus, you don&#x27;t get closed but open ends. Right?

Not sure they&#x27;re bad, but closed ones do look a lot better, no? 
Particularly if you sand them so you really have a flat full ring as 
the end of the spring. With open ends I could imagine it scratches 
more because there&#x27;s a start point and because all pressure gets onto 
a small point. And scratching has several bad effects. I could also 
imagine that a spring with open ends gets pressed diagonally. You 
know, you can&#x27;t let it stand on the table without help. Of course 
inside the puzzle it does have help, from the screw. But I still 
don&#x27;t like it.

          <div class="email-content">Respected all,<br>
         At last, I tasted the experience of a rubiks cube championship in The Netherlands. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I enjoyed every moment and enjoyed meeting many of the European great cubers. I learnt a lot from them all. <br>
        Thanks to Ron uncle for all his help. <br>
        It is 10 days long trip for me and my dad. We reached home safely yesterday night.<br>
  3*3*3 speed solve:-  I had never done 15.66 sec avg at home. But my 15.66 sec avg in dutch open semi final is the most satisfying result for me. It put me in the second position after Joel Van Noort. My single solve 12.56 sec is PLL skip.<br>
  4*4*4 speed sove:- My best is 61.xy sec. But I had 3 pops and almost in all solves I had double parity. Still I am happy with my 80 sec avg.<br>
  5*5*5 speed solve:- I want to forgt this.<br>
  3*3*3 blindsolve:- 3 min 55.xy sec is below my standard but after 1st DNF, it was done with extra care and effort.<br>
  3*3*3 multiple BLD :- I tried 5 and got 3 correct, in 4th one, I had 1 pair of corners flipped and 5th one I had a good scrambling at the end!!<br>
  2*2*2 speed solve:- 8.06 sec avg was good for me to finish 4th.<br>
  Squre-1:- I had 2 good solves 27 sec and 31 sec. But my first one was horrible. I took 50 sec. The avg 36.xy sec put me behind the 2 greats Michael Fung and Lars.<br>
  Pyraminx :- I learnt it a day before the championship and finished last.<br>
  Megaminx :- 6min 1 sec avg was good for me.<br>
   <br>
                 My dad was unlucky to miss out only one edge pair flipped in the 1st cube out of 8 cubes he blindsolved. I am happy he solved 7 cubes correctly in 148 min including memorisation.<br>
                 Let me thank Ron uncle, Ton uncle, Jaap uncle for their help and support. <br>
                Well done all the participants in Dutch open-2006.<br>

For some puzzles you put alot of time to get good results.
Then you have a nice reminder of that event.

          <div class="email-content">Hello all,<br>
         At last, I tasted a cube championship in The Netherlands. I am happy to have met so many great European cubers. The competition was tuff and I enjoyed every moment of it. Thanks to Ron uncle and Ton uncle for all their help. Everyone treated me with respect. <br>
        I think all of you might have seen the result. Since it is my first ever championship, I like to share my performance with you all in this group hoping your feedback will help me to improve my cubing skill.<br>
  1).3*3*3 speed solve first round = 16.66 sec avg= 5th place<br>
  2).3*3*3 speed solve semi final =  15.56 sec avg= 2nd place<br>
  3).3*3*3 speed solve final         =  17.00 sec avg= 6th place<br>
  4).2*2*2 speed solve = 8.06 sec= 4th place<br>
  5).4*4*4 speed solve final = 80.70 sec= 7th place<br>
  6).5*5*5 speed solve final = I want to forget(too many bad pops)<br>
  7).3*3*3 blindfolded = 3min 55.77 sec =4th place<br>
  8).3*3*3 one handed = 70.36 sec avg = 6th place<br>
  9).Square-1 = 6min 1.07 sec avg = 7th place<br>
  10). Pyraminx = 32.70 sec avg<br>
  11).3*3*3 multiple cubes blindfolded = solved 3 correctly out of 5 cubes.<br>
  12).My best single solve in 3*3*3 = 12.56 sec(PLL skip)<br>
  13).My best 4*4*4 single solve = 61.06 sec<br>
  14).My best 5*5*5 single solve = I want to forget this very bad solves<br>
  15).My best square-1 single solve = 27.xy sec<br>
  16).My best Megaminx single solve = 5 min 44.xy sec<br>
  17).My best 2*2*2 single solve is 7.06 sec<br>
  18).Team solve with Stefan Poachmann = 55.xy and 56.xy sec = 2nd place<br>
                      In 4*4*4 solve, I had few pops and all the times except the last but best solve, I had double parity in all cases. I hate parity but it follows me. <br>
                      I think Stefan uncle is happy to team with me and we did very well to finish with 2nd place. Now, I can solve megaminx in sub 4 min. Thanks to Stefan uncle for teaching me his technique.<br>
                      At last, my dad blindsolved 7 cubes correctly out of 8 he tried in multicubes blindfolded. He was unlucky to have flipped only one pair of edges in one cube which denied him the world record. I thought he will be dejected, but he told me it was all in the game and that was it and he will try again in the next championship. But, I felt sad for him and was dejected. <br>
                     Over all we enjoyed every moment of it. It gave us very rich experience. At last I was sad to say good bye to Ron uncleand Ton uncle very early, Stefan uncle and others later one by one. <br>
                     Well done winners and good luck next time for all the participants. My dad often tells me &quot;luck is not in our hands but work is in our hands&quot; and &quot;all of us may not be equally talented but all of us may have equal opportunities&quot;. I will practice well and try to do my best in the next championship. Thanks for all the tips given to me by various participants.<br>

          <div class="email-content">This is a very hard question... I just played around with it.
You have to allow for the inverses of each of those generators too. 
It is included implicitly as performing it 5 times to get the 
equivalent result I guess, but it seems nicer to include it 
explicitly.

For starters, I would go for an edges first approach. Since we know 
that doing any of those generators 3 times perserves edges...

I don&#x27;t know how much people here are going to be able to help on 
this question, besides I guess jaap...

No one has responded to my questions about &lt;u,R>, and this is a 
previous topic I found searching here, in each case I coulnd&#x27;t find 
an answer to. This would help in my more specific question about how 
to solve the &lt;Uu,R> group on the 5x5.

I think you can get almost every corner possiblity (the 8!*3^7/2 
even ones), where by almost I&#x27;m guessing a factor of 3 or 9 on EO... 
Similar for edges. This should be a very challenging.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I solve your question, you solve mine :).

I just had a few successful solves in this subgroup. Here is my 
method:

Let P = (the move) := RU&#x27;R&#x27;U, as it is for teamBLD. Let Q = R&#x27;URU&#x27;.

Solve all 12 edges intuitively. It&#x27;s inuitive for me because I&#x27;ve 
done that before... especially for 3^4 and 3^5 cubes, but here&#x27;s a 
brief explainataion:

P cycles three edges counter clockwise about the UFR corner, the 
ones adjacent to that corner. This is enough to position each edge 
in place, although using Q would certainly speed things up and 
perhaps get them in place with correct flip as well.

A very ineffiecent way of doing this is solving EP first and then 
EO. But that would suffice for a solution.

To do EO separately you can do this:
To flip the UF and RF edges, use (P y&#x27; Q y)

Near the end of doing edges you will probably need to use &quot;setup 
moves&quot;. In this case try to resist the urge to use single turn setup 
turns, because that would invalidate the purpose of this excersise.

Do note that (P y&#x27; Q y) alone without setup moves is theoretically 
enough to solve EO... (think about why).

For the corners P^3 does two 2-cycles as most cubers are aware by 
now. Thanks to the sub-sub-group we are now in, it is actaully 
possible (I have yet to prove it though) to use solely cube 
rotations and P^3 to solve most of the corners (both permutation and 
orientation), where by most I mean with all CP done and only at most 
4 that need twist.

Now for CO. To twist the UFR corner ccw and the UBR corner cw do the 
following alg: (P^3 x&#x27; P^2 x P^3 x&#x27; P^4 x).

Fill in the details and feel free to ask questions.

I guess this makes me an expert now! Yippy. :)

          <div class="email-content">Not mine, though. Constantin suggested it because he&#x27;d like 
certificates very much, and I agree.

He did get one of those RWC glass cubes as trophy (I think for 
winning blindfold at the German Open) and just like me he doesn&#x27;t 
like its complete anonymity, it doesn&#x27;t say what he got it for so he 
can&#x27;t even show that to his friends. Plus, you can easily just buy it 
on the internet. It&#x27;s not a trophy.

Certificates on the other hand are easy to make personal. Mention 
competition, event, competitor and place, put the WCA logo and maybe 
some more graphics on it, let the WCA delegate sign it and there you 
go, a very nice (and cheap?) souvenir you can also hang on the wall 
so it doesn&#x27;t waste space.

There are of course real trophies and some are quite nice, too.

          <div class="email-content">I am fairly convinced that that subgroup consists of precisely all the 
even permutation elements.

I have a sequence that can be used to twist any two corners without 
affecting edges. I have another sequence that flips any two edges 
without effecting corners. All the erientation possiblities can thus 
be achived.

The centers never rotate in this subgroup so the permutation parity 
must stay the same. I can 3-cycle any 3 corners without affecting 
edges..., I think. I should test this one out more throughly though. 
I&#x27;m not too sure about EP.

That&#x27;s about as much as I can figure out. I don&#x27;t think it is possible 
to do any 3-corner cycle now that I&#x27;ve tried.

What&#x27;s your exact algs for flipping 2 edges and twisting 2 corners? 
I assume that you do indeed do solely 4-move commutators (Y-shape) 
and not allowing to combine with setup-moves :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey !!

Ok, so i studied these commutators a little bit and i came up with 
algs for twisting 2 corners and flipping 2 edges.

Corner 2-twist:

(([R&#x27;,F])*2 ([R,U&#x27;])*2)*2 - 32 turns (ugh!)

in condensed notation.

Edge 2-flip:

([R&#x27;,F])*2 ([R,U&#x27;])*2 ([F,R&#x27;])*2 ([U&#x27;,R])*2 - 32 turns (ugh!)

Are these optimal?

A corner 3-twist can be done like so:

([R&#x27;,F][F&#x27;,U][U&#x27;,R])*2 - 19 turns due to cancellations

Have fun!

-Per

PS! It&#x27;s still not sufficient that corners be in an even permutation 
to be solvable in this &quot;Y-commutator subgroup&quot;. Now, what if say URF-
UBR and UFL-ULB are swapped. I can&#x27;t see how that is solvable ...

Exact.
That&#x27;s what I told you, when for example D-corners are put in
position, U-corners are automagically correctly permuted.

Tell me how to reach this strange group with a few setup moves (forget
the edges for now), and I have some ideas to make it useful
(pseudo-blocks conservation, remember?).

My previous alg twisted 2 corners that were not adjacent. Here is 
one simple variation that does:

([R&#x27;,F] ([R,U&#x27;])*2 [R&#x27;,F])*2

Yes, a legal cyclical shift. This should prove that ANY possible 
corner orientation configuration in the full cube group is also 
reachable in the &quot;Y-commutator subgroup&quot;.

Neat!

Good thing you added that one. The first two corner twist you gave twisted corners in the 
same orbit (under half turns) so it doesn&#x27;t work for twisting any pair - buut in combination 
with the last of these (and the 3 corners being in the same layer) that obstruction is 
removed.

All edge 3-cycles (hence all even edge permutations) are possible although the problem is 
really about corners. So the even corner permutation problem really is equivalent to 
knowing what can achieved with these generators.

(I&#x27;m using UF=1, UB=2, UR=3, UL=4, DF=5, DB=6, DR=7, DL=8, FR=9, FL=10, BR=11, 
BL=12.)

By earlier posts we can forget about orientation of edges (these moves will preserve the 
corners). (*)

Let a=((RU&#x27;R&#x27;UR&#x27;URU&#x27;)6(LU&#x27;L&#x27;UL&#x27;ULU&#x27;)6)5 which cycles (1 12 9)
Let b=((L&#x27;ULU&#x27;LU&#x27;L&#x27;U)6(R&#x27;URU&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)6)5 which cycles (1 11 10)
Let c=a5b5a10 which cycles (9 11 10)
bc2 cycles (1 9 10)

I&#x27;m going to call 2 moves equivalent if they only differ by orientation of edges (*) or by 
being inverses, as that can be achieved by doing the same move lots of times or by 
rotations of the whole cube - since I don&#x27;t want to think so hard and basically show you 
can get anything of the form (1 2 x), (1 3 x), (1 6 x) and (1 7 x).

(1 9 10) is equivalent to (1 2 3).
(1 12 9) is equivalent to (3 7 1) and to (6 9 1)
(9 11 10) is equivalent to (1 2 6)
(1 2 3)(3 7 1)=(1 2 7).
(1 2 9)=(1 2 6)(6 9 1)

So any edge permutation of the form (1 2 x) is possible.

(1 3 6) is equivalent to (1 12 9)
(1 3 9)=(1 3 6)(6 9 1)
(1 3 10)=(1 3 9)(9 10 1)
(1 3 12)=(1 3 10)(10 12 1)- NB (10 12 1) is equivalent to a (1 2 x)

So any edge permutation of the form (1 3 x) is possible.

Any edge permutation of the form (1 6 x) falls into one of the above categories.
The only other thing to look at is (1 7 12)=(1 7 3)(3 12 1) and (1 7 3) is equivalent to 
(1 3 7) and (3 12 1) to (1 3 12).

          <div class="email-content">What do you mean &quot;inverted&quot;?

There are a few different interpretations I can come up with. Do you 
mean solving the cross on the opposite color? solving in such a way as 
to need a 180 on the cross layer? insert each edge of the cross 
flipped? Solve the cross in the reversed cyclic order?

I don&#x27;t have any problems with doing this phase of my 5x5. I have more 
of a pause when there is a parity alg being finished, and even more so 
when it&#x27;s on the 4x4, but I&#x27;m comfortable with no-inspection cross.

Another piece of the puzzle...

If I scramble the cube with a sequence like RU&#x27;BU&#x27;L&#x27;BL&#x27;DFL&#x27;F&#x27;LDF&#x27;RF&#x27;U
for example (all but random), I&#x27;m pretty sure you can solve the
corners with Y-commutators only.

          <div class="email-content">Using GAP, I get that the number of elements in &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B,x,y> is 
30 times larger than for &lt;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U,R&#x27;URU&#x27;,x,y>. If edges are ignored I 
get the same result of a factor of 30 (in agreement that all edge 
positions are reachable).

I&#x27;ll also note that that I get that &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B,x,y> is 2 times 
larger than for &lt;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U,R&#x27;URU&#x27;,RUR&#x27;U&#x27;,x,y>. The additional 
commutator as a generator allows all even-permutation positions of 
the corners to be reached.

I had a feeling you might be able to answer this. : )
So then &lt;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U,R&#x27;URU&#x27;,x,y> is 15 times smaller than &lt;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U,R&#x27;URU&#x27;,RUR&#x27;U&#x27;,x,y>?
Does GAP allow you to get a set of coset representatives?

I guess RU&#x27;R&#x27;uFUF&#x27;U&#x27; essentially does cycle 3 corners on the F face (factorng in that we can 
solve even edge permutations and all orientations already from the smallet subgroup) and 
if we can cycle 3 corners on one face (UFR UFL UBR)(UFL UFR DFR)=(UFL UBR DFR) and (UFL 
UBR DFR)(UFL DFR DFL)=(UFL UBR DFL) shows we can get all the even corner 3-cycles in 
the group generated with the extra commutator. Clearly then the original subgroup does 
not allow for a 3-cycles of corners in the same face.

Yah ok, the fact that &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B,x,y> is 2 times larger than for 
&lt;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U,R&#x27;URU&#x27;,RUR&#x27;U&#x27;,x,y> only means that the odd positions are 
excluded, which is trivial anyway. The reason all even permutations 
are reachable in &lt;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U,R&#x27;URU&#x27;,RUR&#x27;U&#x27;,x,y> is that we can do say P=
([R,F] )*3 then some Z-commutator Q and combine these 2 sequences to 
a larger commutator PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; to achieve 3-cycles on corners. We have 
already shown that we can cycle edges and twist corners and flip 
edges as we desire in the group &lt;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U,R&#x27;URU&#x27;,x,y>.

At the moment i&#x27;m most interested in finding optimal sequences for 
the following in &lt;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U,R&#x27;URU&#x27;,x,y>:

1 : any 2-twist on corners
2 : any 2-flip on edges
3 : any edge 3-cycle

And likewise when restricted to solely F,R and U turns.

Cheers!

Right. A final adjustement move (1/4 turn) will be necessary.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Ok, here&#x27;s a way to do solely an edge 3-cycle:

([R&#x27;,F][R,U&#x27;])*2 ([F&#x27;,U])*2 - 24 turns

and a shorter way than posted previously to twist 2 corners:

[[R&#x27;,F][F&#x27;,U],[D&#x27;,L]] - 22 turns due to some cancellations

(I hope this condensed notation is clear, there&#x27;s some commutators 
inside the main big commutator. Also recall that [P,Q]^-1 is simply 
[Q,P].)

Anyone has something better?

What is possible solely in &lt;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;,R&#x27;U&#x27;RU,x,y> ? The Z-commutator 
subgroup? We know already that ALL even positions are possible in 
the combined Y/Z commutator subgroup :-)

that scramble and got to the point where I need to swap just two 
edges. Thus I conclude this scramble is not possible to solve within 
this subgroup.

The rule is that the competition must have at least 10 competitors to 
be official, not in every event doe, but for the whole contest. Then 
it also must have an WCA delagate to judge the whole thing.

BTW: I think it is to bad you could not come to the Swedish open 
contest, we had a great time today (more fun tomorrow) and we all 
missed you.

[R&#x27;,U][R&#x27;,F][F,U&#x27;] + U&#x27; (adjustment) positions the corners.

The trick is [R&#x27;,U], [R&#x27;,F] and [F,U&#x27;] solve D-corners one by one, and
when D-corners are OK, U-corners are automatically permuted.

I feel there&#x27;s an intermediary subgroup that could be interesting, and
it looks closely related to Y-commutators.

Otherwise, I don&#x27;t care about commutators when they are useless for
speed-cubing.

Let me take an example.
RU&#x27;R&#x27;U scrambles ULF UF UFR UR URB FR FDR pieces. You get an &quot;Y&quot; shape
(pyramid) of unsolved pieces. Consider this Y as your degree of freedom.
Without changing other pieces, you can do FR&#x27;F&#x27;R, R&#x27;FRF&#x27;, etc, 6
commutators.
But, more interesting, you can &quot;move the Y&quot; to another place, or keep
it in the same place, but move solved pieces.
Example: U&#x27;l
After U&#x27;l, you still can apply the 6 commutators, and then restore
solved pieces with l&#x27;U.
U&#x27;l removes two 1x2x2 from the block of solved pieces, but you keep
pseudo-blocks.
Another sequence that travels through the &quot;Y space&quot;:
RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2F&#x27;UL2BLB&#x27;LU&#x27;FU&#x27;

Now back to what I was saying about corner permutation.
After RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2F&#x27;UL2BLB&#x27;LU&#x27;FU&#x27;, just insert the last D-corner with
R&#x27;FRF&#x27; and you&#x27;ll see all corners and positioned, because a 2-cycle or
a 3-cycle can&#x27;t happen.

Even better, I think you can always get the last 4 corners
automatically permuted when using Y-commutators and some other tricks
after a shorter sequence based on RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2F&#x27;UL2BLB&#x27;LU&#x27;FU&#x27; (RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2F,
RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2F&#x27;UL2BL, etc.).

Yes.

> Does GAP allow you to get a set of coset representatives?

Yes, the RightCosets function does that. It gives cycle notation 
using user-assigned numbers for the various facelets. GAP gave 
representative elements consisting of three-cycles and double swaps 
(along with the identity element).

Translating to more meaningful notation, these representatives are:
1) identity
2) LFD->FRD->RBD->LFD
3) LFD->RBD->FRD->LFD
4) LDB&lt;->LFD, FRD&lt;->RBD
5) LDB->LFD->FRD->LDB
6) LDB->LFD->RBD->LDB
7) LDB->FRD->LFD->LDB
8) LDB->FRD->RBD->LDB
9) LDB&lt;->FRD, LFD&lt;->RBD
10) LDB->RBD->LFD->LDB
11) LDB->RBD->FRD->LDB
12) LDB&lt;->RBD, LFD&lt;->FRD
13) URF&lt;->LDB, FRD&lt;->RBD
14) URF&lt;->LDB, LFD&lt;->FRD
15) URF&lt;->LDB, LFD&lt;->RBD

... if I haven&#x27;t made any mistakes in my GAP model or in the 
translating of the results.

Many cubes are not adjustable.  You can try using a knife to help get
the covers off, but you will probably find that the centers are
attached with rivets and can&#x27;t be loosened.  Your best bet is to buy a
do-it-yourself cube from www.rubiks.com.  They come with screws that
you can adjust however you like them.

          <div class="email-content">Hi David!<br>
cool you finally got to this yahoo group... ok, concerning your problem, <br>
well, it all depends on the type of cube you have, most of them don&#x27;t <br>
even have screws, just rivets, and there&#x27;s no way to tighten/loosen <br>
them. Also, the caps are glued (or melted) so you would have to apply <br>
some force to open it. But my advice would be, get a DIY kit from <br>
rubiks.com and make your own cube the way you like it.<br>
And guys, this is David, a guy I met probably 3 years ago in the US and <br>
taught how to solve and he finally made his way to this group. Cool to <br>
hear from you again, dude! What are your times like these days?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles!<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t see how that sequence is travelling through Y-commutator <br>
space. It can&#x27;t be solely composed of 4-move Y-commutators. Or am i <br>
missing something ?<br>
<br>
RU&#x27;R&#x27;U - UF&#x27;U&#x27;F ... now already ur sequence is *wrong*. U allow <br>
pseudoblock setups that are not part of the Y-commutator subgroup. <br>
So i&#x27;m also not sure where u are heading with this...<br>
<br>
Solving purely using Y-commutators is kinda interesting, but <br>
allowing pseudo-block setups also obfuscates it for me ... <br>
<br>
Anyway i have 2 new sequences:<br>
<br>
Improved 2-flip of edges:<br>
[[R&#x27;,F][F&#x27;,U][U&#x27;,R],[R,F&#x27;]] - 26 turns due to many cancellations<br>
<br>
Edge 3-cycle:<br>
[R&#x27;,F][F,U&#x27;][F,R&#x27;][U&#x27;,F][U,F&#x27;] - 18 turns<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I guess it&#x27;s simply best of 1 for feetsolving for a few reasons. Not 
that many do feetsolving. Some who do it solve rather slowly. And 
also it requires rearrangement of the competition stage normally. 
There&#x27;s already many many events and not easy to cram all in within 
reasonable timeframe :-)

Happy (feet)cubing :-)

 I&#x27;m przctising speedcubing with one hand.I have few questions.Do you use the same algorithms as in two hands solving?What is the best position of holding the cube while solving it?How many fingers should I use?I suppose that the more fingers I use the faster I solve the cube?How are your practice going?Ma best time is still 52.12 s but my average is 1:02:15 .:) .How do you do?

3x3, and I&#x27;m doing everything.  I wish I could have gone to G-Wiz, 
but the PSAT&#x27;s were this weekend.

Nice job, Chris, 2 sub-10 4x4 BLD solves??? Wow...
Real close finish, .04 seconds!  That&#x27;s not much!  And Andrew Kang 
got a 11.30?  Nice...fourth fastest time in contest ever, and second 
fastest outside of the Exploratorium.

Anyway, hope to see you at Rutgers, Doug.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

First, a bit of vocabulary :
- Holding hand : in 2-handed solving, the hand that doesn&#x27;t do much more
than holding the cube (usually the left hand)
- Solving hand : in 2-handed solving, the hand that actually solves the cube
(usually the right hand)

So, there are different strategies for OH-cubing I have encountered :

1. Use your &quot;holding hand&quot; to solve the cube OH. This usually doesn&#x27;t
require any modification of algorithms. The only issue is to get used to use
that hand for solving the cube (= developing dexterity).

2. Use your &quot;solving hand&quot; to solve the cube OH and mirror all your
algorithms. The problem with this solution is that it might take a while to
mirror all your algorithms (or the ones that need to be mirrored actually,
but that needs to be done for more than 90% of them I think).

3. Use your &quot;solving hand&quot; to solve the cube OH and use your normal
algorithms with a z&#x27; cube rotation. This is very good at the beginning
because you only have to get used to do U for R moves, and L for U moves.
The only thing is that it might be more difficult to look at the cube and so
recognizing cases.


Personally, I use the strategy number 2. I think Marc van Beest uses the 3rd
strategy. I don&#x27;t know which one uses Ryan Patricio but I bet on strategy
number 1.
So I think that you have to train a bit on each of them to decide which one
you like the most.

If you have any ideas for other &quot;strategies&quot;, please let the OH-solvers
community know. :p


Concerning &quot;how I hold the cube&quot;, I have to say I have no idea. Just look at
the videos to find out (strangepuzzle or youtube). (I think that&#x27;s because
with practice, you think less and less about holding the cube but you focus
on solving the cube until the point where holding the cube is not a problem
at all. That&#x27;s when you are fast, because you fully focus on solving the
cube. ;-))
Concerning practice, it depends. Some days I don&#x27;t solve a cube at all
because I want to rest my hands or I am just very busy. But I usuallly solve
at least a few cubes OH everyday, but it might go up to 50 or 60 solves if I
want to practice a lot. :-)

Good luck with OH-solving ;-)

Gilles.

Indeed.



Maybe you&#x27;ll understand with a video:
http://grrroux.free.fr/misc/Y.avi

I&#x27;m scrambling using such an &quot;Y-sequence&quot;.
Then I solve 4 corners (yellow corners) using Y-commutators (any
orientation), and the other 4 are automatically permuted.

It feels natural. When I tried this, I was expecting such a result,
but I can&#x27;t explain why it works.
What I want is to understand and find a way to start from such a subgroup.

Gilles.

In the way of Acube? I must admit, that this is the part of this 
excellent program I do not like at all. No, I do not plan to 
implement this in the moment.

Yes, I meant like ACube. Not necessarily with the same syntax, though 
that would be nice cause then we could use both tools writing the 
input only once. But you&#x27;re a programmer, you must like the idea to 
generate input cases with a program and feed them into your solver, 
no? Someone wrote he has already entered 40000+ cubes by hand with 
mouseclicking and that was a year or two ago, don&#x27;t know how far he 
is now. To me, that sounds like an insane waste of time.

Not a new request, but how about an option to send to a file ALL 
solutions to a single problem?  I&#x27;m still using your old Cube Optimizer 
(and M. Reid&#x27;s program) when I want all the solutions.

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Stefan, a text input option would be very help.

Input from a specifiable file would be nearly equivalent though, but 
ideally both.

Having a visual cube to work from is nice, but it&#x27;s net very 
practical when I want to do entire alg sets in one go. I tend to 
want to script batch-runs a lot and that was why I have always 
choose ACube over Cube Explorer. But with the new feature of 
ignoring stickers, I might start using Cube Exploer more if text 
input was made availible. From a programming standpoint this 
shouldn&#x27;t be terribly time consuming to append.

I also think some users might like to be able to downlaod previous 
versions of Cube Exploere from your site, not just the most recent.

This 4.00s version is making me want to go out and buy 2 more gigs 
of RAM....

Awesome to see you can ignore cubies, but how about an option to
ignore parts of cubies? So you can find OLL algs and such.

Multiple solutions, optimised for slice turns, the ability to restrict
to certain moves.

Apart from these few things, it&#x27;s good :)

          <div class="email-content">Forgot about this in my previous post:

You can use the web-interface of Cube Explorer for this. I actually 
build a webpage that uses the web-interface of Cube Explorer to do 
this. I also generated 2 million unique cubes and &quot;fed&quot; them to Cube 
Explorer to see if they were al solvable in 20 moves or less (they 
were).

My web-interface is still online (http://www.arnaudensandra.nl/pages/
puzzles/cube3/default.asp) but it doesn&#x27;t work correctly in Opera/
Firefox. Also, it is in Dutch, but it should be pretty straight-
forward:
&quot;Verwijder alle kleuren&quot; = &quot;Remove all colors&quot;
&quot;Begin opnieuw&quot; = &quot;Start over&quot;
&quot;Ga naar de 3D kubus&quot; = &quot;Go to the 3D Cube&quot; (this is the button you 
are probably looking for)
&quot;Bestudeer Arnaud&#x27;s oplossingsschema&quot; = &quot;Study Arnaud&#x27;s 
solution&quot; (don&#x27;t do this if you are a speedcuber!)

Also,
B = U (Boven => Up)
O = D (Onder => Down)
V = F (Voor => Front)
A = B (Achter => Back)
L = L (Links => Left)
R = R (Rechts => Right)

Umm... you can set the orientation, disregarding identity of the 
piece.  Isn&#x27;t that what you want for OLL?  And you can then copy and 
paste the solutions (which is part of what I wanted).

It&#x27;s very nice to have this...

I&#x27;d also be squeamish about this, but perhaps we&#x27;re unduly prejudiced 
against feet.

Think for a moment of the places where hands go that you&#x27;d be unlikely 
to reach with a foot...  Why should we expect the average foot to be 
dirtier than the average hand?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Herbert :-)

I love your cube explorer, but i do have some issues with your
program:

1 - please delay all error messages about impossible configurations
until the editing is completed and a solve/generation is attempted.
The automatic fixes for consistency are usually not what is wanted.
And it&#x27;s generally faster to edit a configuration from a clean cube
than from an empty cube.

2 - please allow to display all optimal sequences for a generator or
solver. Or even better display all optimal AND those who are shorter
than a specified length. This is highly useful when looking for
algorithms that are useful for speeding. As an example, most people
do prefer the 14-turn T-permutation and not the optimal 11-turn one
because the optimal one has too many half turns and is not
fingertrick-friendly. (U F2 U&#x27; F2 D R2 B2 U B2 D&#x27; R2 versus R U R&#x27;
U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;.) One option may be to have a button
next to the run/stop button that will open a new window showing all
algorithms found so far.

I consider 1 to be a &quot;design flaw&quot;, while 2 is highly desireable
to have included in future version :-)

Best wishes!

Ugh.  Point taken.  

Some people do, in fact, get fungal infections of the hands and nails.  
Probably not as common as athlete&#x27;s foot, though...

I&#x27;m not really talking about dirt. Except the kind of dirty places 
you can get an infection. Like those athlete&#x27;s feet. Also...

I wash my hands many times a day. Can you say the same about your 
feet?

I have my hands in the air most of the time, not in a warm, dark, 
humid environment that rarely if ever gets cleaned. Can you say the 
same about your feet?

[No, but hands tend to be exposed more often to &quot;germs&quot;, and they 
also have more opportunities to pass them on...]

Most people&#x27;s hands &quot;occasionally&quot; touch their noses or -- even 
worse! -- their mouths.  The same cannot be said for feet.

But the thought of (other people&#x27;s) athlete&#x27;s foot has already been 
enough to put me off the whole idea of foot cubing.  I don&#x27;t even 
want to try it alone in the bathroom.  :(

&gt; Awesome to see you can ignore cubies, but how about an option to<br>

You can find OLL algs. Use Ctrl-Key + leftmouseclick to define <br>

The restriction to certain moves - a good idea. I put it onto the <br>

So how does this webpage use the Cube Explorer? Does the Cube 
Explorer have a COM-interface so that u can use server.createobject
() etc etc in asp? Is this documented anywhere? I&#x27;d be interested to 
use that interface from PHP instead :D

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">1. I agree. I have always found that to be very annoying. After 
using it so long I adapted to what it does, so perhaps makes this an 
option. Then the user can pick if they want delayed error messages. 
Also why not leave the cube unchanged when the user is inputing? 
Whenever I have an identical piece the older one vanishes.

2. Allowing all the optimals to be displayed would require a minor 
change in an IDA* algorithm so this shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a 
problem, but if it is a long list, than it should really be piped 
(sent) to a file. Allowing complete sub-optimals... I would imainge 
that this could explode very fast. Maybe one longer than optimal is 
okay, but any more and you are talking about increasing the runtime 
to maybe an hour or more I suspect.

(3.) Yes, Yahoo really needs to allow for editing of posts (well 
restrict it to a certain timeframe, say 24hrs before a post is 
uneditable).

The more I think about it, the more I want ACube to have a GUI... we 
are trying to turn cube explorer more and more into ACube it seems.

I can appreciate the simplicity of C.E. for what it is, and I can 
see that the author is trying to target the general public more 
than &quot;power-users&quot; like use cubists. This is what it seems to me. It 
is fair in many ways because, how many people in the world would 
want these features? Pretty much exactly the ppl that use ACube 
frequently and with varing options set. I estimate this to be only 
20-30 people in the world.

ACube (besides a GUI, which I don&#x27;t particularly need) is nearly 
perfect for what we &quot;power-users&quot; want to do. To make that program 
any better would be to extend it to have (limited) 4x4 and 5x5 
capabilities (1 yrs of coding I bet).

You know what would be great? If some how all those cube program 
authors got together and came up with the ultimate program!

HAHA, umm you&#x27;re hosting the competition Bob.

Also, I&#x27;ll be there.  I&#x27;m working out the legits this week.  Ummm I 
dunno who will go w/ me or how much cash I&#x27;ll miss out on, but I&#x27;ll 
be there for sure.  

Bob, I would like to really compete in the big cube BLD.  If that 
means I forfeit participation in other events,  so be it.  I would 
just like to compete in 

3x3 Speed
3x3 Bld
4x4 Bld
5x5 Bld

The rest is trivial =P

Later,
Daniel Beyer

Oh contraire Blackadder. It contains a lot of terms from undergrad. Almost all of them 
would be found in undergraduate courses (or earlier) as I recall - though I&#x27;d have to listen 
again to get an exact count. I especially don&#x27;t understand you illustrating it with the term 
quotient since quotient would appear in the first term of undergraduate study.

          <div class="email-content">Announcing the Negative Time Solving Contest 2006<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s that time of the year again! This year, in the United States,<br>
Daylight Saving Time (DST) will end at 2 AM on Sunday, October 29.<br>
For countries in the European Union, Summer Time ends at 1 a.m. UT<br>
on Sunday, October 29.<br>
<br>
This is your only chance of the year to solve a cube in negative<br>
time. This year&#x27;s scrambling algorithm will be available online at<br>
http://cubefreak.net/negative.html<br>
in the afternoon of Saturday, 28th.<br>
<br>
Please send your time to smakisumi at gmail with the subject line <br>
&quot;Negative Time Solving Contest&quot; and include your name, nationality,<br>
and negative time (e.g. -59 minutes 42.04 seconds) in the message.<br>
Also, please indicate whether this is your most negative solve. I<br>
will submit all new personal records for the Negative time solve<br>
category on speedcubing.com.<br>
<br>
To submit your time, you must follow these rules. <br>
<br>
Rules<br>
1. Use the provided algorithm.<br>
2. Begin your solve before daylight saving ends and complete the <br>
solve after daylight saving ends in the time zone in which you live.<br>
3. Please, don&#x27;t be an idiot! Remember that this is an unofficial <br>
contest. Please follow all rules you would when submitting a record<br>
to speedcubing.com.<br>
<br>
Finally, thanks to the cube stud Tyson Mao for bringing this great <br>
Caltech tradition to cubing. Good luck to everyone!<br>
<br>
Enjoy,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Included in the download is a file called &quot;cube.chm&quot;, which is the 
helpfile. Open this file, then expand the section &quot;Exploring the 
Cube&quot; and open the chapter &quot;For programmers: The Cube Explorer 
Interface&quot;. Now look under &quot;Case A&quot;.

This is how I use this from my ASP-Page. I think it would work 
exactly the same from PHP:

On my webserver, I used &quot;srvany.exe&quot; to run &quot;cube316.exe&quot; as a 
service. This is not a necessary step to do, but it ensures that Cube 
Explorer is always running, even if nobody is logged on to the 
webserver. The webinterface of Cube Explorer is configured to listen 
to a specific port is described in the helpfile. The disadvantage of 
this method is that Cube Explorer is always running and using memory, 
but because of the smart memory-handling for services by Windows 
(paging out unused memory if memory is needed by other programs/
services) this is not a problem on my server.

The first page (2d-layout) is used to construct the colors of the 
facelets

The second page
* receives the colors of the facelets
* converts this to the querystring Cube Explorer expects
* Creates an &quot;XML-Request&quot; to Cube Explorers web-interface sending it 
the querystring
* Receives the &quot;XML-Response&quot; from Cube Explorers web-interface
* Converts this &quot;XML-Response&quot; into Dutch sentences for easy reading
* Converts this &quot;XML-Response&quot; into input for the 3D java applet

If anyone would like to use my page, or create their own, please 
contact me. I would be more than happy to help anyone to do this. I 
think I will extend the second page to accept the input from other 
pages and to output in Dutch and English, but this might take a 
couple of days.

All optimal solutions was what I had in mind.  But some people might

You can always make the UFR and UR cubies grey before you start 
editing the rest of the cube... 

On the other hand, the editing function in Jaap&#x27;s Cubie doesn&#x27;t have 
this feature/problem at all.  It&#x27;s very clean and intuitive -- just 
click and drag.

You could say that about some of the other features, too.  E.g. the 
webcam interface (of no interest to me) and the antisymmetry editor 
(which I like very much).  Puzzling is a specialized business...

I&#x27;m sure Herbert will find a good compromise!

It would be

1 - P(meeting no such cube) = 1 - ((W-M)/W)^N

where W = number of possible scrambles (4.3e19).

Approximately M*N/W = 5.3e-6

How did you get from 1-((W-M)/W)^N to M*N/W? Also, the latter to me 
sounds more like the expected number of sup20 scrambles rather than 
the probability to find at least one.

((W-M)/W)^N =(1-M/W)^N is about 1-N*M/W for M/W&lt;&lt;1 (binomial 
expansion).

My fingers like the first one best. But still I prefer Stefan&#x27;s opposite swap followed by a 2-generator edge 3-cycle.

  F2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L F2 R&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; (Rr)2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 - 15 turns

  Yes, J-perm pluss a permutation parity :-)

  And an improved case N°10:
  B2 L U L&#x27; B2 R D&#x27; r2 F2 r2 (Ff)2 r2 f2 R D R2 - 16 turns

  (J-perm with inserted permutation parity)

  I think only 2 cases are missing now, case N°11 and case N°12.
  Bon nuit :D

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, many inner slice turns. And wow, you like my opposite swap plus 
a whole 3-cycle? How about these instead:

(R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) oppositeSwap (U R U&#x27; R&#x27;)
(x R2 F&#x27;) oppositeSwap (F R2)

Actually all your algorithms are pretty much the same as my second 
suggestion but with the older oppositeSwap.

To be more precise: two setup moves around a variation of r2 U2 r2 
U2u2 r2 u2.

Yes... but this was done via a relatively small number of coset 
searches, which is not the same as making 7.6e14 independent, random 
choices of cubes. 

Having said that, the results shouldn&#x27;t RAISE anyone&#x27;s expectations of 
a 21f* cube being found!

          Announcing the Negative Time Solving Contest 2006

It&#x27;s that time of the year again! This year, in the United States,
Daylight Saving Time (DST) will end at 2 AM on Sunday, October 29.
For countries in the European Union, Summer Time ends at 1 a.m. UT
on Sunday, October 29.

This is your only chance of the year to solve a cube in negative
time. This year&#x27;s scrambling algorithm will be available online at
http://cubefreak.net/negative.html
in the afternoon of Saturday, 28th.

Please send your time to smakisumi at gmail with the subject line 
&quot;Negative Time Solving Contest&quot; and include your name, nationality,
and negative time (e.g. -59 minutes 42.04 seconds) in the message.
Also, please indicate whether this is your most negative solve. I
will submit all new personal records for the Negative time solve
category on speedcubing.com.

To submit your time, you must follow these rules. 

Rules
1. Use the provided algorithm.
2. Begin your solve before daylight saving ends and complete the 
solve after daylight saving ends in the time zone in which you live.
3. Please, don&#x27;t be an idiot! Remember that this is an unofficial 
contest. Please follow all rules you would when submitting a record
to speedcubing.com.

Finally, thanks to the cube stud Tyson Mao for bringing this great 
Caltech tradition to cubing. Good luck to everyone!

Enjoy,
Macky

<br>
I was at a physics competition on saturday, and one of the events was<br>
particularly interesting and I wanted to see how you guys would go<br>
about doing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Each team breaks into 2 mini teams (2 people each). These mini teams<br>
are put into seperate rooms and are both given differen models. These<br>
models are made out of tinker toy or k&#x27;nex type sets. <br>
<br>
Your task is to (on paper) describe you model with writing or<br>
drawings/sketchs or whatever so that the other half of your team in<br>
the other room can build it. <br>
<br>
After you finish describing, your paper(s) will passed to the other<br>
room, and theirs will be passed to you and you must attempt to build it. <br>
<br>
You have 35 minutes total to complete this.<br>
<br>
<br>
How do you think you would go about doing this? (my team didn&#x27;t do<br>
very well...)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Pedro, you have to be in a place where the &quot;official time&quot; changes at a
specific time so that you get a negative time.

So too bad if you are in a country where the time doesn&#x27;t change during the
year.
But you might want to have a look at the regulations in that case, just to
make sure. ;-)

Have fun !

also... why post on a rubik&#x27;s cube group? does rubik&#x27;s cubing

          <div class="email-content">Yea, they were the first things that caught my eye when I was looking
for something to be a house.  If we had more time we probably could
have made something nicer but we didn&#x27;t have much time so we just
sharpied windows on the boxes and used them.  Also, if we had more
time we probably could have taken more photos and had more frames for
the movie and it could have been smoother.  Oh well.

          <div class="email-content">Haha, the most interesting aspect is that you only get one chance a

blindfolded. Imagine doing a successful blindfolded average over 12

lot about your social life.

So feel free to do more than just speedsolve 3x3.

          <div class="email-content">I think it&#x27;s a nice feature, but it has to be used honestly.

However, if a site links a single video from your server, then there will be
some bias (is that how you call it in English ?) in the download statistics
because that video has a lot more chances to be downloaded than others.

On the contrary, the fact that a video is linked from another site could be
a sign that the video is interesting, therefore justifying the fact that it
gets more hits.

So I really can&#x27;t make a choice, but if it appears that someone has fun in
changing significatively the &quot;results&quot;, then the ranking doesn&#x27;t mean
anything any more.

To conclude : that&#x27;s up to you to decide if it is the case or not. ;-)

Have fun !

Your algorithm is either 13 turns or it should be written like so :

f2 (Uu)2 f2 r2 U&#x27; f2 r2 U r2 (Uu)2 f2 

Like u had written it it means U u2 which is counted as 2 turns of 
course.

Are you going to share your solver?? I only know about ACube 4x4x4 
version (Josef Jelinek) and Charles Tsai 8-step 4x4x4 solver. Pluss 
unreleased similar 5-step solver of Bruce Norskog.

Kind regards,

No, i don&#x27;t think we gonna find that ;-) If only using ONE inner slice 
turn we will have side effect on 16 centers. We need at least 3 inner 
slice turns to avoid this side effect ;-) Stefans permutation fix(es) 
do exactly that.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Pedro,
I think that last scene was Power Ranger inspired =p.  To answer your
question, we just used tape to stick the arms and legs on.  I couldn&#x27;t
get ahold of any duct tape though and the tape we used wasn&#x27;t that
great on the tiled cubes that I have and so it kept falling off.  What
we ended up doing was pressing really hard to get the arm to stay on,
taking a photo really quickly, the arm would then fall off and then we
would move the robot to where we wanted the next shot, and press it on
again.

The movie was finished pretty quickly.  We did the whole thing in
under 48 hours, from when we started shooting to turning it in.  For
campus moviefest, what they do is give you a laptop and a camcorder to
use for a week to make a movie.  My friend and I didn&#x27;t come up with
an idea for a movie until really late Friday night when the movie was
due Monday.  We started shooting around Saturday at 11 PM or so, shot
until 4:30 in the morning and then again Sunday night starting around
9PM.  We shot until around 5:30 AM and then it was 12 hours of editing
and then submitting it at 6 PM Monday.  We didn&#x27;t want to shoot during
the day because stop motion animation takes a while to do and we
wanted the lighting in the film to be consistent and that would be
harder with the light outside changing as the sun moves.  I think if
we had more time, we could have taken 2 or maybe even 3 times the
number of shots and it would have looked a lot smoother.  Oh well
though, I still like how it came out.  =)

Then i can just cheat: (r2 u2)*2 = ((Rr)2 R2 (Uu)2 U2)*2 Voila no 
inner layer turns :-P

Well, this is in fact the new standard for making scrambles on 
cubes. Use solely double-outer-layer and outer-layer turns. Yes, i 
know scrambling is different of course :-)

Did I say they were new? :-)
I just pointed out they are optimal.

Have fun,

  Hi Ron,

  These are all Chris Hardwicks 6-turn permutation parity pluss some 
  setup and un-setup. Nothing more. Nothing new :-)

  Enjoy!

I&#x27;ve forgotten the parenthesis  :)
It takes indeed 11 turns

I&#x27;ve written a solver especially for finding those PLL Algs, so for
exemple I&#x27;ve decided not to implement single quarter inside turns.

You can find it there, although the code is a bit in a mess :S
http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/clement.gallet/main.cpp

I&#x27;ve written quickly some notes here :
http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/clement.gallet/notes.txt

For now, with my computer, searching for all the solutions of depth 10
takes about 1 second, and you multiply it by 25 for each extra depth.

Yes i just wanted to stress the importance of concise notation :-) I 
would prefer if you could make a windows executable for me. And if 
it takes commandline parameters also please explain how that is 
done.

Ok, i managed to compile it. It was very easy using CodeBlocks ;-)

I tried running it for the case 10 (of Frederick). This gives input 
RYWOROYW according to ur notes. After a short while the program just 
crashes ungracefully...

I still prefer u to compile it for me. I&#x27;m no expert on C++. It 
failed also for the simple 6 turn permutation parity. So the code is 
not compiled and linked properly here. I works fine until i supply 
my input and is starts works 5 steps for the scramble. Then crashes.

I watched it via quicktime on the site (bah), but I liked it so much I
later downloaded it 
http://www.campusmoviefest.com/movies/berkeley/2006/cubemen.m4v

And there is no need for iTunes (I would never use it either).
Instead, try out VLC (videoLAN player) if you haven&#x27;t before. It had
no problem playing it. http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

Good luck!

I think the problem must be your lack of memory
It takes me about 700-800 Mo to run, how much do you have ?
I&#x27;m using GNU/Linux, so I can&#x27;t give you a binary right now, sorry.
But I will ask some (very few) friends who are using Windows to
compile it. ;)

If your have less memory, just change the depth research to 4
(the QUEUE_DEPTH_SOLVED and QUEUE_DEPTH_SCRAMBLED constants)
It will use a lot less memory.

And if your have uncommmented the #define MIN_TWIST, just comment it.

Do you have messages that explains the crash ? (except for the
SEGFAULT :) )

Good luck,
Clément

midnight, the calendar advances one day. You can get a negative time

  For me - and quite intutively - the superflip represents the highest symmetri in<br>
  relation to the null point. If that is true (that it does have the highest<br>
  symmetri), a bold hypothesis would be that this flip represents the (only)<br>
  diameter of the cube. Other points of &quot;less symmetri&quot; may very well be local<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
there are 4 cubes which have the highest possible symmetry:<br>
identity(0f*),Pons Asinorum (6f*), Superflip (20f*) and Pons Asinorum <br>
composed with Superflip (19f*). From more than 30,000 cubes we know <br>
that they need 20f* moves. We even know, that all cubes which have <br>
*any* symmetry can be solved within 20f* moves. <br>
<br>
So from this point of view there is nothing special about superflip. <br>
If it is an antipode, than there are tenthousands of others, many of <br>
them lacking any symmetry. If there is an antipode with 21f*, then it <br>
has no symmetry at all. In this case there are at least 48 antipodes, <br>
because the conjugation with any of the 48 cube symmetries gives a <br>
different cube.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;   If  &quot;anyone&quot; is supposed to be me, I´ll quote myself (#8180):<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;   For me - and quite intutively - the superflip represents the <br>
highest symmetri in<br>
&gt;   relation to the null point. If that is true (that it does have <br>

&gt;   symmetri), a bold hypothesis would be that this flip represents <br>
the (only)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Per, I compiled it with Dev-C++:
http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~mfung/speedcubing/Dump/.

Clement, for case for the optimal solution must be at most 13 moves
because fixing the PLL parity is 6 moves and the U-PLL is 7 moves.
(But I don&#x27;t say that less moves = faster :p). Or did your program
also gives solutions at most 13 moves?

Your compiled version also crashes here, just like the versioni 
compiled myself. Your executable was however 4-5 times bigger then 
mine. I used a GNU compiler. Dev-C++ has their own compiler or it&#x27;s 
just an IDE using some other compiler ??

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Herbert :-)

How many cubes/configurations have the highest order of symmetry on 
the 5x5x5 cube ?? I haven&#x27;t really tried to figure this out but it 
must be quite a bit higher at least.

And why can&#x27;t the Cube Explorer use tables when ignoring parts of 
the cube. ACube clearly does this and works using the 2-phase 
algorithm even when ignoring parts of the cube. So i would say that 
for ignoring parts of the cube ACube wins hands down. But for normal 
fully specified configurations Cube Explorer is way faster. ACube 
gives many (optimal) solutions. ACube however has no GUI or web 
interface. So it&#x27;s good to have both i guess ;-)

That&#x27;s what i needed. A direct link to the file. Not a page with

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,<br>
<br>
I almost know nothing about the 5x5x5, for example what restrictions <br>
exist for the orientations and permutations of the edges etc. So I <br>
really do not know the answer. <br>
<br>
Concerning Cube Explorer and ignoring parts:<br>
<br>
Indeed ACube is faster in general. But I was surprised, how fast CE <br>
is without using *big* tables (it also uses some tables, but the <br>
tables which have to be created for the individual cubes are small <br>
and that is why there is almost no initialization time when starting <br>
the search). I use some additional tables for certain configurations, <br>
for example when all 8 corners are defined. I only implemented an <br>
optimal solver for the &quot;uncomplete&quot; case, not the two-phase <br>
algorithm, because I found an optimal solution to the problems I <br>
entered always in a reasonable time.<br>
I would be interested for which usefull configurations you think my <br>
implementation is yet too slow.  <br>

<br>
I got an email from the D.E. Shaw group inviting me to send a resume <br>
due to my Rubik&#x27;s Cube involvement. I was curious if others got the <br>
same email - it looks like they were essentially scanning either <br>
competiion results or unofficial world records and doing a mass <br>
emailing.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a real company doing real investment, technical and research <br>
work (www.deshaw.com) and thinking about it, for a company like <br>
that, trying to recruit from a group of puzzle solvers is probably a <br>
pretty good idea.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s the start of the email:<br>
<br>
&quot;The D. E. Shaw group is currently looking to hire a small number of <br>
truly gifted individuals with backgrounds in mathematics, computer <br>
science, and other technical fields.  I came across your name while <br>
looking for people who have competed successfully in Rubik&#x27;s Cube <br>
World Competitions.  A mastery of algorithms and puzzles, <br>
computational proficiency and analytical curiosity -- these same <br>
skills that made you formidable in cubing competitions are highly <br>
valued in our staff.  If you might be interested in exploring <br>
employment opportunities with us, I invite you to submit a copy of <br>
your resume&quot;<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll respond, because I&#x27;m happy in my current job at <br>
HP, but I was curious if everyone else got this email as well?? <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello

For my program, the U-PLL takes 9 moves, it doesn&#x27;t count R&#x27; L as one
move. So the whole algorithm takes 15 turns, that why my program gives
me the 14 moves algorithm first.

My program search for all solutions of 10 moves or less, then 11
moves, then 12 moves, etc...

Yes, i have also downloaded and seen that movie now. First i viewed 
it with MPlayer which was a bit annoying since it&#x27;s a commandline 
based program. But it does support a wide range of codecs. After 
updating my old VLC to the latest version i was able to view it 
there also. My Media Player won&#x27;t let me view it. There could be a 
codec somewhere that would work with Media Player, but i cannot be 
bothered now ;-)

Sorry, I think I&#x27;ve found my mistake.
The problem is the size of the arrays which are not as big as they
must be. The whole program is still under development :)

I&#x27;ve fixed that, so just download again, it should work.

Sorry again,

Ok, now ur programs works just fine. How do i stop the searching 
when im satisfied with what it has found already? I found out that 
at least it works to use the pause button ;-) Closing the window 
then i just lose the solutions. Would be nice to have the solutions 
written to a file instead of just to the screen (hint) :-)

<br>
Seeing videos for the 6x6x6 and now 7x7x7! on Olympicube.com got me<br>
thinking about the possible fastest times that could be achieved on<br>
these puzzles, and also whether there is a general formula which one<br>
could use to predict the limits for solving any general nxnxn cube.<br>
<br>
Doing a little bit of analysis, I would like to propose the following<br>
formula, which I humbly call Harris&#x27; Law.<br>
<br>
t = 0.2777*[n^3 - (n-2)^3 - 6mod(n/2)]^1.3272 - 0.53n<br>
<br>
This is a prediction for the achievable limit in seconds (average<br>
time, not single time) for a puzzle of side length n in a WCA competition.<br>
<br>
This suggests that the WR average for 6x6 would settle around 3:35 -<br>
and for 7x7, around 5:35.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Yes that&#x27;s what he means. I plotted it in Excel like that and i got 
same numbers as Dan did, so that must be correct. I guess Dan is 
simply scaling up the number of cubies to be solved. Not counting 
very middle centers on odd sized cubes since they are fixed anyway.

Enjoy!

Also, I should have included in the rules that you get at most 15
seconds of pinspection. So everyone: if you&#x27;ve already scrambled,
it doesn&#x27;t matter for this year, but if you haven&#x27;t, don&#x27;t
scramble until you do the actual solve.

I think it was as late as 10 pm in some parts of Europe when I posted
the algorithm. Sorry!

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

Oops, it is the same.. :-)

For Stefan&#x27;s algorithm I do the r2 upwards.
For the algorithm below I do Rr2 downwards and then R2 upwards.
This feels faster.

Have fun,

Ron

  Hi Clément,

  It works great now!

  I found this nice permutation parity PLL with your program.
  Not sure if it is new, but for me it is faster than Stefan&#x27;s edge swap.
  Uu2 Rr2 U2 Rr2 R2 U2 Rr2 Uu2 (8, 16, 0)

  Have fun,

  Ron

    Hi Per

    Sorry, I think I&#x27;ve found my mistake.
    The problem is the size of the arrays which are not as big as they
    must be. The whole program is still under development :)

    I&#x27;ve fixed that, so just download again, it should work.

    Sorry again,
    Clément

May be like a rubix cube (don&#x27;t know what that is) but it&#x27;s *not* 
like a Rubik&#x27;s cube.

&gt; Seeing videos for the 6x6x6 and now 7x7x7! on Olympicube.com got me<br>

Great, thanks. Next question: In the documentation you frequently 
refer to source code (e.g. cubicube.pas), where can I find it?

          <div class="email-content">HI,
First of all I related the number of solvable pieces to the time taken
to solve. so n is transformed into the number of pieces by the [n^3 -
(n-2)^3 - 6mod(n/2)] terms. For the cubes we have data for (2x2 -
5x5), I assumed we had reached the limits for 3x3x3 solving (I think
13.22 is a very hard record to beat). I then fitted a curve using a
regression technique, and subtracted an error term which I think is OK
to base on the size of the cube.

But remember, this is just for fun, not a rigorous mathematical
procedure, because we are not talking about something that can be
analytically determined. And the fact that it gives a nice fit to the
current data is a nice quirk.

Dan :)

Hmm.  It&#x27;s not so surprising, really.  You have just four pieces of 
data as input, and three parameters in your function that you&#x27;ve 
adjusted to get a good fit.  There is also an infinite number of 
functional forms to choose from. :)

Oh crap, I just fought my way through the advanced levels, now I see 
the final exam... demotivating... but I&#x27;ll give it a try. And hey, 
too simple? I personally find it much harder than, say... a Rubik&#x27;s 
cube.

Nobody has reached the &quot;limits&quot; if you ask me. Even with Fridrich,
it&#x27;s possible to get pretty fast (see Ryan&#x27;s simulator for example).
But I don&#x27;t understand why most cubers think executing 40-45 moves is
slower than ~55.

The only reason I heard of that company DEShaw is that they sponser

          <div class="email-content">You get sub 10 minute times on it already. I am so jealous that you 
got a chance to play with it. It looked like you had some trouble 
keeping the layers aligned during edges step though. But you breezed 
through the finish. The last center seemed to take a few tries and 
it looked like you finally went for a commutator for it.

Because the middle layers are more pillowed, do you think that 
keeping the layers aligned will be much of a problem after some 
practice?

I think I would do edges a little differently on the 7, but I 
haven&#x27;t really thought about it much. I can&#x27;t stand virtual cubes 
that size unfortunately.

I want to get my hands on one so bad now. I bet that less than five 
7x7 exist now. Any update on the status of the 6x6 public 
availiblity? I feel like it should be getting close.

          <div class="email-content">I also got it.  Like Koen, I initially thought it was junk mail, but
noticed the &quot;Rubik&quot; part before deleting it.  I think it&#x27;s a great way
to recruit people, since they&#x27;re looking for a certain kind of person
rather than someone who won&#x27;t require as much training.  Also, it
seems that they had to do at least a bit of research to find our email
addresses, so I&#x27;m wondering if they saw more personal info, such as
age bracket and education.

          <div class="email-content">I think (maybe) one of the reasons is this:

Usually methods that use fewer moves have a lot of thinking time since
you are doing things yourself.  So they think that thinking must waste
time.  But what if you get used to everything with practice?  You only
think while looking ahead.  Which means no pauses at all.

I&#x27;ve improved a bit my program, and I&#x27;ve created in the same time a
svn repository here : http://rubiks.kicks-ass.org/svn/pysolver/trunk/

For case 14, the program found several algorithms which doesn&#x27;t sound
very good. Here are all starting with Rr2, with only one slice, the
final U/U&#x27; can be dropped, so that makes in fact 14 moves. 

Rr2 B2 U2 R2 Ff2 D Bb2 D2 Rr2 U&#x27; Bb2 D2 f2 Ll2 U (15,1)
Rr2 B2 U2 R2 Bb2 U Ff2 D2 Rr2 U&#x27; Bb2 D2 f2 Ll2 U (15,1)
Rr2 B2 U2 R2 Bb2 U Bb2 U2 Ll2 D&#x27; Ff2 D2 f2 Ll2 U (15,1)
Rr2 B2 D2 L2 Ff2 D Ff2 D2 Rr2 U&#x27; Ff2 D2 f2 Ll2 U&#x27; (15,1)
Rr2 B2 D2 L2 Ff2 D Ff2 D2 Ll2 D&#x27; Bb2 U2 b2 Rr2 U&#x27; (15,1)
Rr2 B2 D2 L2 Ff2 D Bb2 U2 Ll2 D&#x27; Bb2 D2 f2 Ll2 U&#x27; (15,1)
Rr2 B2 D2 L2 Bb2 U Bb2 D2 Rr2 U&#x27; Ff2 D2 f2 Ll2 U&#x27; (15,1)
Rr2 B2 D2 L2 Bb2 U Bb2 D2 Ll2 D&#x27; Bb2 U2 b2 Rr2 U&#x27; (15,1)
*Rr2 f2 U2 Ff2 D Rr2 U2 Ff2 U&#x27; Ff2 L2 U2 B2 Ll2 U (15,1)
Rr2 f2 U2 Ff2 D Rr2 U2 Bb2 D&#x27; Bb2 L2 U2 B2 Ll2 U (15,1)

Rr2 f2 D2 Ff2 U&#x27; Rr2 U2 Ff2 D Ff2 R2 U2 F2 Rr2 U&#x27; (15,1)
Rr2 f2 D2 Ff2 U&#x27; Rr2 U2 Bb2 U Bb2 R2 U2 F2 Rr2 U&#x27; (15,1)
Rr2 f2 D2 Ff2 D Rr2 U2 Ff2 D&#x27; Ff2 L2 U2 B2 Ll2 U&#x27; (15,1)
Rr2 f2 D2 Ff2 D&#x27; Rr2 U2 Ff2 D Ff2 L2 U2 B2 Ll2 U (15,1)

Rr2 f2 D2 Bb2 U Rr2 U2 Ff2 U&#x27; Bb2 L2 D2 F2 Rr2 U&#x27; (15,1)
Rr2 f2 D2 Bb2 U Rr2 U2 Bb2 D&#x27; Ff2 L2 D2 F2 Rr2 U&#x27; (15,1)

The one with the * is the best one for me. What do you think ?

I&#x27;ve also searched for the best algorithm for case 3, as those with
the minimal number of moves contains 7 slices, but when I sort all the
algorithms by number of moves + number of slices, the only ones are 11
moves + 7 slices and 13 moves + 5 slices.

One exemple : 

r2 Uu2 r2 b2 U&#x27; r2 b2 U b2 Uu2 r2 (11,7)
R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2 b2 U&#x27; r2 b2 U b2 Uu2 r2 (13,5)

We see that the end of the algorithm is the same, and personnaly I
find quicker to do r2 Uu2 (with the thumb) r2 than R2 Uu2 Rr2 Uu2 R2.

So I think the 11 moves algs must be the fastest algs to do.

Finally, for case 5, a weird alg (again, 14 moves without the final U): 

L2 Uu2 U&#x27; L2 U&#x27; F2 Uu2 U&#x27; F2 U L2 Uu2 F2 L2 U (15,0)

it can be done very fast like that :

z U2 Rr2 R&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F2 Rr2 R&#x27; F2 R U2 Rr2 F2 U2 z&#x27;

this problem yet. Is the &lt;u,R> group really that untractable? It 
only has two generators!

I have been thinking about it for a few weeks now, and everytime I 
bring it up no one has been able to help me. Perhaps this was 
discussed in an earlier topic, but I can&#x27;t find it. Can anyone 
direct me to any relevant infromation?

I am solving CF, and need to rotate the centers and have no idea how 
to do this. I think solving CF is a good method.

Is there an up-to-date website showing all cases and shortest/best 
algs found so far?

Here are two I just found, though rather trivial:

R2&#x27; U&#x27; R2 (d&#x27;Uu) (Rr)2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 y R2 U R2&#x27; (U&#x27;u&#x27;d) R2
R2 (d&#x27;Uu) R2 U&#x27; R2 y&#x27; u2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (U&#x27;u&#x27;d) R2 U R2

start/end with a double layer turn, so combined with an outer layer <br>

How about this method?

1 - first layer corners
2 - align centers with upper layer corners
3 - fix upper layer corner orientation
4 - edges

For step 2, you can use algs like:

R2 u2 R u2 R2 u

For step 3, just use Sune algs (R u R&#x27; u R u2 R&#x27;).  You have to use an
even number of these because each one will rotate the upper corners
180 degrees out of alignment with the centers.

I haven&#x27;t figured out all of step 4 yet.  You could use this alg to do
a three cycle of corners:

(R2 u)*18 u (R2 u)*6

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Well the way i found my contributions was simply to look at normal 
PLL algs from 3x3x3 cube, and then track how the edges move around. 
In some cases i did the permutation parity with edges at UF and DF 
location or UR and DR. And so on. And also there&#x27;s at least 4 useful 
permutation parity algs:

1 - r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 (Chris Hardwick)
2 - U2 r2 U2 (r2 (Uu)2)*2 (my modification of #1)
3 - (Rr)2 (Ff)2 U2 r2 U2 (Ff)2 (Rr)2 (Stefan Pochmann)
4 - (Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2 (Stefan Pochmann)

Having so many permutation parity algs gives quite good 
opportunities for move cancellations :-)

Oh, and also don&#x27;t forget that we have either:

perm. parity + PLL 

or

PLL + perm. parity

or some insertion scenario ...

That&#x27;s an interesting method that should work well. In fact corner 3-
cycles are impossible. Still the problem of solving the edges 
effectively remains. My short way to cycle 3-edges is like this:

(R u2)*2 R&#x27; u2 R&#x27; u&#x27; (R&#x27; u2)*2 R u2 R u

Edge 2-flip is like so:

(R u2)*2 R&#x27; u2 R&#x27; u (R&#x27; u2)*2 R u2 R u&#x27; (compare w d 3-cycle)

<br>
Does anyone have any ideas for a solution strategy for the following <br>

owse/8d6e<br>
<br>
I can solve everything apart from the last centers. Found no easy way <br>
to make a center 3-cycle. Once that is found we can completely solve <br>
it. Although it&#x27;s a lengthy solution :-)<br>

<br>
Messing up the cross is something we all do a little now and then...<br>
<br>
So I decided to create some short and easy to learn algs that can come <br>
in handy when trouble is there. Take a look at my page:<br>
<br>
http://members.chello.se/solgrop/kub/Xfix.HTM<br>
<br>
To learn the algs fast just build a random cross and fix it at the end <br>
using tha algs at my page. After 20-30 cubes something you probably now <br>
the algs pretty well.<br>

No, this is strictly &lt;u,R> solving. No singular U turns allowed. U 
is always turned dragging e layer along with it, making it u. And 
also no physical orientation of the cube either :-)

Have fun!

Well if you haven&#x27;t seen the bad cross until OLL is done then you 
are having a very bad day ;-) Most people will recognize it much 
earlier. Then there are easier fixes and far less cases. But those 
listed are nice to know anyway :D

That&#x27;s one heck of a long journey. And so many complications to get

Long (but nice) story already... then again, no wonder you have lots 
to tell when you get into a very different culture the first time. 
I&#x27;m very happy you were able to come and that you enjoyed it. Looking 
forward to the rest of the story, I had to laugh a few times already
 :-)

Little correction: I&#x27;ve teamsolved successfully with others before, 
but not nearly as well as with you, our F2L recognition seems to be 
very similar and we also share quite a few LL algs. Was a lot of fun 
teamsolving with you.

And congrats again for all your great results! Funny how you make it 
sound like you barely made it to the 3x3 final when in fact you 
finished 2nd in the semi-final...

Cheers!
Stefan

Well, It&#x27;s also possible to mess up the block =)

When I read Pers answer I came to think about FMC. The X-fix algs are 
wery useful for that too.

And now I&#x27;m reading your answer and I start to think about BLD =)

You can solve one more case using the D and D&#x27; cross algs. It then do a 
double Z-PLL. Just add a U2 before the last turn: S2 M2 U/U&#x27; M2 U2 S2

Per: 

Well I do FMC sometimes (not often doe) but I don&#x27;t know much about 
those.

But if you are snort of time?

Gilles:

You can do the alg for case 2 as M&#x27; (U&#x27; d&#x27;) M U&#x27; M&#x27; S&#x27; [U] to get rid 
of one of the S moves, I do it like that but also cube rotate before 
the last S move so I can do that one to in M.

Long (but nice) story already... then again, no wonder you have lots 
to tell when you get into a very different culture the first time. 
I&#x27;m very happy you were able to come and that you enjoyed it. Looking 
forward to the rest of the story, I had to laugh a few times already
:-)

Little correction: I&#x27;ve teamsolved successfully with others before, 
but not nearly as well as with you, our F2L recognition seems to be 
very similar and we also share quite a few LL algs. Was a lot of fun 
teamsolving with you.

And congrats again for all your great results! Funny how you make it 
sound like you barely made it to the 3x3 final when in fact you 
finished 2nd in the semi-final...

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">If we go by the &lt;20%=lucky definition...
For Fridrich solvers, a non-lucky LL occurs (215/216)(71/72) = 98.1% 
of the time.  Thus, a non-lucky LL occurs 12 for 12 times ((215/216)
(71/72))^12 = 79.997% of the time.  So you get at least one lucky 
solve just over 20% of the time in an average of 12, so 1 lucky 
solve isn&#x27;t lucky in an average.  The probability of getting exactly 
one lucky solve is (12 C 1) (.981)^11 (1-.981)^1 = 18.04%, leaving 
about a 2% chance of 2 or more lucky solves, which is definately 
lucky.  Continuing this process gives about a 0.0051% chance of 
getting 4 or more lucky solves.  I think we can agree that that is 
lucky.

So, I would argue that average to be lucky.  In fact, any Fridrich 
average with >1 lucky solve is lucky by my definition.

I am so happy that you had such a great time in Holland, I remember
the first time I visited (because of the Cube), it was a fantastic
experience for me also. I am very sad that I wasn&#x27;t able to be at
Dutch Open to meet you, maybe we shall meet at the next World
Championships.

By far the best part of the story however:
&quot;Have fun(copy right Ron uncle) &amp; Cheers(copy right Stefan uncle)&quot;

Oh of course you qwerty users don&#x27;t have the M next to the L.
But basically I just typed on the rong keys though using the same
combination, and it&#x27;s funny it gives that sort of Spanish name.

That&#x27;s all ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Those cubes are not mass produced to the best of my knowledge. So ur 
best bet is to stumble upon one of those at ebay or u can ask some 
od the puzzlebuilder guys at www.twistypuzzles.com if they know 
where u can get one. As a last resort make them urself. It&#x27;s not 
extremely hard. Apart from bandaging, simple fusing are probably the 
easiest puzzle modifications. (Not counting restickering or swapping 
pieces.)

Best of luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I forgot the first question. I&#x27;m quite sure that a lucky solve would 
still be a valid time. Especially for the single solve categories. 
There is DNF and the 2 second penalty for &quot;over-misalignment&quot;. DNF 
only covers pops (cancelled solve) and not fully solved 
cubes/puzzles. DNF does NOT include lucky cases to the best of my 
knowledge. If im wrong im sure someone out there will correct me.

The full official regulations are available here:

http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations.html

and were discussed in this group and here:

http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?
p=297&amp;sid=f39af6690bd299f9405f623866d1cc7a

-Per

PS! Btw, there is also DNS (did not start) when a participnat does 
not show up for a solve or chooses not to use the attempt.

          <div class="email-content">Answer 1 - No matter lucky or not, the fastest solve is the world record

Answer 2 - Siamese cubes are really easy to make.
Just take 2 cubes and glue 2 corners and one edge together so that
connectors are placed so that the corners connect to one cube and the edge
to the other.

For a triamese, just repeat the operation with other cubies.

Have fun !

Gilles.

(this way is not like the official one (with an edge that has 2 connectors
(one in each cube)), but it will work I&#x27;m sure (someone told it to me at
European Championship)

I am so happy that you had such a great time in Holland, I remember
the first time I visited (because of the Cube), it was a fantastic
experience for me also. I am very sad that I wasn&#x27;t able to be at
Dutch Open to meet you, maybe we shall meet at the next World

By far the best part of the story however:

          <div class="email-content">I would suggest a DIY cube from www.rubiks.com.  The screws are under the center caps and are what holds the centers to the spindle.  Newer cubes don&#x27;t always have screws.  I&#x27;ve found that one of mine has more of a corkscrew thread pattern rather than real threads.  You can check by taking an exacto knife and separate the cap from the center carefully.  I would still suggest a DIY kit as they allow you to make adjustments much easier and allow for more of an exact adjustment.

About the music video: First I noticed the usual double-blue edge 
etc, then I saw they have an &quot;explanation&quot; for it, namely pure face 
(not layer) rotations. However, the story implies that it takes place 
inside the regular cube the kid plays with. Plus, sometimes you can 
see two centers of the same color. But I like the music (particularly 
the sax part), so... thumbs up.

Oh hey, a normal cube plus additional face turning. That&#x27;s equivalent 
to the 5x5 centers, right? This could actually be fairly easy to 
build. Similarly a face turning 2x2 might be built from a 4x4. I&#x27;m 
not sure about the 5x5/3x3 yet but I think the 4x4/2x2 could be done 
simply by extending the centers outwards and adding new larger 
surface squares.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">HI Dwayne,

That is a nice tip, thanks. It is useful when you are learning in the
LL to be able to have some tricks to help you get more speed, easily.
 However, I would think most &quot;expert&quot; cubers are able to recognise the
PLL without having to refer to the F2L colours for guidance. This is
something you can achieve with a lot of practice, being able to
recognise the PLL by looking at two sides (6 stickers) only.

Lars Vandenbergh, and I think, Katsu Konishi were the first guys to do
this, however please correct me if this is wrong, somebody.

All the best,
DanH

Legal (fact, read the rules) but not legitimate (my opinion).

towels or something dry) before you lube it.

And don&#x27;t put too much lube on either, you only need a few drops of
silicon spray, which will spread a nice thin layer all around the cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Andrew,

You might find (as I have done), that not many companies are willing
to give you sponsorship, because, as you point out, making their money
worth while is the onyl reason they would sponsor you, and with most
companies that&#x27;s just not going to happen.

Companies that may sponsor (and are certainly worth the effort
investigating), are toy shops, and distributors of cubes in your area.
If you want sponsorship to do the Rubik&#x27;s cube, you have to consider
that the only thing you will be helping to promote is the Rubik&#x27;s
Cube... so any company that is interested in increased sales of cubes
may be interested in you. Perhaps if you used a StackMat then the
StackMat people might help you too... I don&#x27;t know about that one :)

All the best,
DanH

          <div class="email-content">I have found that I develop better technique for looking ahead when my
cube is getting slow, because of the forced reduction in turning
speed.  But I develop better technique with finger tricks when my cube
is fast, because they&#x27;re so much easier.  So I purposely wait until my
times start slipping significantly to re-lube (about once every 4-6
weeks).  Each time I do re-lube, I get an instant time increase of a
second or two.

How do people get the sailboats into the jars?

How do they get that pear into that bottle of liquor?  Well, that one is
different.  So think about the sailboat.

reason... To me, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to do U2 y2 T-perm instead
of T-perm U2 etc.

many other) expert cubers, it&#x27;s normal to do the permutation and then
the necessary U-adjustment. We have learnt special tricks to help us
know before the end of the permutation exactly what move to add on, so
there is no delay, just a simple add on to the end of the permutation
which takes a fraction of a second.

I didn&#x27;t really suggest it, but that&#x27;s how some cubers do it. First
AUF, then recognize, then the alg. If the cuber sees that it&#x27;s a
T-perm before U-adjustment, he could do d2 instead, but of course
T-perm and then U2 is better.

I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s normal to a great majority of really fast cubers. PLL
is really easy to recognize.

Katsu is really fast at PLL and has some great algs and videos, his
site really helped me! Doing all 21 algs in a row is a really good way
to practise, it makes you learn all the cases well.

It takes min 5 sec and I am loosing a lot here. COULD ANYONE SUGGEST

I mean, if I use one of the timers on a computer and I make a POP the 
program waits for a 13th solve to make an average.
Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but it seems that good timers should need this 
upgrade... or not?

          <div class="email-content">The best advice is to just do a lot of practice solves. Personally, I
have just gradually built up a good recognition of each case over
time, I haven&#x27;t worked particularly hard at it, but it&#x27;s something
that just takes time and practice and experience.

You will know when you get to the point of mastering it, when you can
just glance at the cube after OLL and just &quot;know&quot; the case you are
dealing with.

It takes min 5 sec and I am loosing a lot here. COULD ANYONE SUGGEST

you can also add a very large time (sothat it will be ignored as worst

Btw you also had this &#x27;problem&#x27; when POPs were still allowed, because
what to do with a DNF? :p

I would like to add that the general procedure for &#x27;official rules&#x27; UWR is to have the timer start by releasing your fingers from the keyboard (same for Stackmat).
It is possible to start too early (unintentionally) when you start at the beep.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,
I totally agree. When I didn&#x27;t have a stackmat yet I also did this (I
used Jess Bondes timer). The way I did it was this: I set the
countdown time at 0 sec. Then after preinspection I will press the
spacebar with the fingers of both hands. Note that if the spacebar is
still pressed the timer will not start! When I am ready my fingers
release the spacebar, sothat the timer will start. And when I am ready
with the solve I stopped the timer by hitting the spacebar with both
hands. 

Btw, wouldn&#x27;t it also a good idea to make the standard for 5x5x5 avg
an &quot;avg of 10&quot; instead of an &quot;avg of 5&quot; (or at least add this
category). Because (almost) all other avgs on speedcubing.com are also
avg of 10. In my opinion 7 solves is not enough for an (unofficial)
avg. Just a suggestion.

          <div class="email-content">I dislike having to wait for the pre-inspection timer to finish before
starting the solve. For that reason, I also set the pre-inspection
timer to 0 seconds in JNetCube. The downside of this is I don&#x27;t get my
pre-inspection period timed. I think you should press/release the
space bar once to start the pre-inspection timer, then press and
release space bar again to start the solve timer. If the timer is
started too late, the program could also measure how late it was
started, and do something appropriate.

I also think it would be nice if JNetCube would stop the timer when
the space bar is pressed down. At least on PCs, the timer is stopped
when the space bar is released, not when it is pressed down.

It&#x27;s not a problem at all. If you pop, then you fix it and continue 
the solve until your done, exactly as you do in competition. Your 
timer program will never know you had a POP so it wont wait for a 
13th solve, (If it does not have eyes, I assume it has not =)

control. At least not yet! ;)
So ok, I was wrong. Plus, I don&#x27;t have the same practice like all of 
you, I still don&#x27;t know what happens in a real competition. But I 
hope to know it soon.

          <div class="email-content">True. The fact is that I like the nice report a good timer gives you 
automatically after an average. Anyway, I wasn&#x27;t used to behave like 
you do after pops. I stopped the solve when the pieces were too far.
Little behaviours to correct. :)

          <div class="email-content">Check out Mackys site at cubefreak.net .  He has his BLD method (probably the quickest), as well as links to others.  Pochmann method is also quite nice and easy, although memo is harder.
Good luck,

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Blindfolded Methods: Any good tutorials?


  I&#x27;m looking for some good tutorials on blindfolded cubing (3x3x3). I 
  don&#x27;t necessarily need the fastest or most efficient method. I would 
  prefer to start with the easiest (and most comprehensive tutorial). I 
  also don&#x27;t mind having to memorize.

  Anyway, any tips or links would help tremendously.

  Thanks!
  Aaron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Aaron,

In my humble opinion (and my personal experience), the easiest method 
for blindfold solving is Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s method. You can find it here:

http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/

I do think this method requires some understanding of cycles, 
commutators, maybe a little group theory (parity issues, transpositions 
etc.). I have written a tutorial about commutators.. I think it might 
help.. (sorry for advertising for my own site :))

http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jnoort/index.php?location=commutators

If you have any questions about the method, you can mail me: jnoort[at]
gmail[dot]com.

Good luck,

Joël.

Indeed it will be hard to beat, but far from impossible. With four 
lucky solves for a skilled cuber, I forecast a sub-10 average of five.

D&#x27;oh.. *I* forecast a sub-5 average of five. How are you ever gonna

Having one POP or a lucky solve in 100 solves is statiscally rather
normal. There&#x27;s no need for additional solves. Removing outliers is
useful only the data sample is too small.

          <div class="email-content">For averages of 100, I include all solves, including the lucky ones. 
You can&#x27;t get a much better average by having lucky cases.

POPs, I just ignore them. The reason is: a POP can easily cost you 10 
seconds, and that means a 0.1 seconds difference in the average. The 
influence a POP has in the average is just too big.

might have 10(12) averages (or why not 5(9)? ) instead of 3(5) 
averages to level lucky solves.

I&#x27;ve booked at the same place I stayed in the spring:
Best Western The Garden Executive Hotel, South Plainfield, NJ

Incidently, last spring I arrived late, but in the morning, I found
two people cube racing in the breakfast room.

I hope to arrive early, like late afternoon Friday, possibly, but it
could be late again.

I noticed that too.  It&#x27;s sad because there were some really neat
ideas that people didn&#x27;t care about because they were too focused on
the method they were using.

Anyone read that post from &quot;Eligeon&quot; about &quot;The Boomerang&quot; method? 
Was anyone around then to see what the steps were?

If someone come up with a novel solution/method noone has any 
obligation to look into it;-) If the inventor feels it&#x27;s good that&#x27;s 
the person who should invest time/effort to explore all it&#x27;s 
possibilities. And if it&#x27;s good then surely someone will start 
following. I don&#x27;t complain because almost noone has shown interest

          <div class="email-content">well i have to discuss something thats been bothering me and i know they are working on good ideas, but i had to bring it up here, in the hope as a group we can think of some good ideas to resolve the issue.  i think at the past couple cali tournaments that bld has gotten totally out of control in the amount of time it takes up, to the point where other events and other rounds are being eliminated or less people are allowed to advance because of the time constraints that bld is imposing.  i believe everyone should should have a chance, but i also believe 30 minutes worth of dnfs is a waste of time.  competitions aren&#x27;t the place to practice these skills in my opinion, if you aren&#x27;t usually successful or take large amounts of time, i think that one should work at home until they can post decent and consistent times.  maybe an elimination final, where if the first solve(s) aren&#x27;t under a certain time then you don&#x27;t advance, giving everyone a chance to post a time, but without<br>
 sacrificing other people&#x27;s chances to compete. possibly 2 dnfs= elimination?  only pre registered competitiors can participate in bld? maybe a dedicated 2 mat table off to the side for bld competitors, which would run from right away in the morning until the first round is done to ensure the main stage will only be needed for the time its scheduled and doesn&#x27;t go 45 minutes over.  i&#x27;m not sure maybe there are some better ideas out there.<br>
<br>
this weekend only 16/55 were taken to the final, where usually its 24, and the reason was because time was running short after the 2 hr bld event, i like second round, but i like even more the 2 chances to better my comp average, i know sometimes you win sometimes you loose, but i posted my best competition average ever and didn&#x27;t make it to the semis, which i have only missed out on twice in the 10 or so comps i&#x27;ve gone to.<br>
<br>
and i am also tired of the 5x5 event always being the first thing to go.  its unfair to cancel because the scramblings take a while, or the event takes some time; these things shouldn&#x27;t be enough to stop it from happening, i work hard at it, and it really sucks i hardly ever get a chance to compete with 5x5. It seriously can&#x27;t take even 1/2 as much time as the bld event, especially considering at the largest tournaments, there aren&#x27;t more that 5-10 people insterested, so it should be totally feasible to have a 45-60 min 5x5 round, even less if we use the graduated final system, where if the first solve or two isn&#x27;t under a certain time, then you stop.<br>
<br>
<br>
this is my boo hoo about some stuff maybe some people have some good ideas to resolve some of these problems.  i want everyone to have a chance to do what they want, without hindering anyone else&#x27;s chance to do what they want.<br>

          <div class="email-content">yes, it would be a problem, for said reason. i guess you could always
spend the money to manufacture a cube that blends colors together...
or just melt together separate pieces of plastic to form the colors.

I&#x27;ve been interested since I read about it.  I just can&#x27;t find a site

          <div class="email-content">Hi Clancy,<br>
<br>
Our hobby is growing and more people are competing in more events. That is good news!<br>
But this also means that time schedules are getting tighter.<br>
<br>
If we keep on growing like this, then we may need qualification times per event.<br>
In Europe we introduced combined rounds, where everyone who wants to compete has at least one attempt, and after that people beating a specific time have one or more extra attempts.<br>
This way we can do many puzzles, each in 1 round, with everyone having his chance to compete.<br>
<br>
On the other side we also have strict time limits. For blindfolded we often have a time limit of 20 minutes for 2 cubes.<br>
And the slower competitors can use a Stackmat or stopwatch somewhere in a corner, so that we can use up to 10 timers.<br>
This way we can handle the blindfolded competition in one hour.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think we should not criticize competitors who are slower. Everyone should have his chance.<br>
Using time limits and a limited number of attempts, we can still have many events on one day.<br>
But it takes some smart planning and smart event formats.<br>
<br>
A competition organizer will try to have the most popular events. The popularity of events is different in different countries.<br>
<br>
Of course you can always organize a competition yourself! You could even organize a two day competition. :-)<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>

  well i have to discuss something thats been bothering me and i know they are working on good ideas, but i had to bring it up here, in the hope as a group we can think of some good ideas to resolve the issue. i think at the past couple cali tournaments that bld has gotten totally out of control in the amount of time it takes up, to the point where other events and other rounds are being eliminated or less people are allowed to advance because of the time constraints that bld is imposing. i believe everyone should should have a chance, but i also believe 30 minutes worth of dnfs is a waste of time. competitions aren&#x27;t the place to practice these skills in my opinion, if you aren&#x27;t usually successful or take large amounts of time, i think that one should work at home until they can post decent and consistent times. maybe an elimination final, where if the first solve(s) aren&#x27;t under a certain time then you don&#x27;t advance, giving everyone a chance to post a time, but without<br>
  sacrificing other people&#x27;s chances to compete. possibly 2 dnfs= elimination? only pre registered competitiors can participate in bld? maybe a dedicated 2 mat table off to the side for bld competitors, which would run from right away in the morning until the first round is done to ensure the main stage will only be needed for the time its scheduled and doesn&#x27;t go 45 minutes over. i&#x27;m not sure maybe there are some better ideas out there.<br>
<br>
  this weekend only 16/55 were taken to the final, where usually its 24, and the reason was because time was running short after the 2 hr bld event, i like second round, but i like even more the 2 chances to better my comp average, i know sometimes you win sometimes you loose, but i posted my best competition average ever and didn&#x27;t make it to the semis, which i have only missed out on twice in the 10 or so comps i&#x27;ve gone to.<br>
<br>
  and i am also tired of the 5x5 event always being the first thing to go. its unfair to cancel because the scramblings take a while, or the event takes some time; these things shouldn&#x27;t be enough to stop it from happening, i work hard at it, and it really sucks i hardly ever get a chance to compete with 5x5. It seriously can&#x27;t take even 1/2 as much time as the bld event, especially considering at the largest tournaments, there aren&#x27;t more that 5-10 people insterested, so it should be totally feasible to have a 45-60 min 5x5 round, even less if we use the graduated final system, where if the first solve or two isn&#x27;t under a certain time, then you stop.<br>
<br>
  this is my boo hoo about some stuff maybe some people have some good ideas to resolve some of these problems. i want everyone to have a chance to do what they want, without hindering anyone else&#x27;s chance to do what they want.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I must agree with you on at least point, &quot;...If someone come up with a
novel solution/method noone has any obligation to look into it ;-)&quot;

Of course no one is obligated!  If somehow I implied that, please,
show me where :)  

There are of course, many ideas that hit the group.  I didn&#x27;t suggest
that everyone should help develop those ideas.  Sometimes it is better
though, when considering a new method, to reflect on the ideas and 
concerns of a third party.  

To explain further, suppose I come up with a new system for the 5x5. 
I may have mapped out the method and several of it&#x27;s variants, but it
is difficult to map out its pros and cons for one of two reasons:
(a): A limit of expertise.  (b): My view would be inherently bias
because it is _my_ idea.

It is similar to occasions when I have discussed FMC ideas with you,
Per; I explored a new method idea, but still asked you about it.  Why?
- Because method development is easier when an expert in the area can
point out otherwise unobvious things.  

Then I see someone post an idea, looking not for someone to do all the
work, but just for thoughts on the method.  How should these people
interpret the lack of response?  And then on the flip side, we&#x27;ve had
insanely long threads regarding that three door scenario.  

Have the pros and cons of the cage method not been explored publicly?
 It&#x27;s lack of development doesn&#x27;t mean it hasn&#x27;t been addressed well
enough.  As for Gilles method, nothing is more inspiring to me in
terms of method development.  He did a fantastic job of exploring a
method idea, with little assistance.  Perhaps he had the expertise
needed to develop that method and see the strengths and weaknesses of
it.  Not everyone is so good :)  And how much sooner might the method
have been brought to the cubing world if the community had jumped in
with their ideas?

&quot;Now it&#x27;s proven to be good and people are beginning to show an
interest in it :-)&quot;

Methods shouldn&#x27;t have to be proven for their worth by the developer!
 Not everyone is capable of extremely fast times.  That is (to me) the
same as saying, &quot;You will not prove your method until you are
extremely fast.&quot;  That&#x27;s my perception of it however; I don&#x27;t intend
to put words in your mouth.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Clancy,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our hobby is growing and more people are competing in more events. That is good news!<br>
<br>
But this also means that time schedules are getting tighter.<br>
<br>
---i agree its good news, but i think a lot of ideas and structure plans of comps have to be re-thought because of this<br>
<br>
==========================================================<br>
<br>
If we keep on growing like this, then we may need qualification times per event.<br>
<br>
In Europe we introduced combined rounds, where everyone who wants to<br>
compete has at least one attempt, and after that people beating a<br>
specific time have one or more extra attempts.<br>
<br>
This way we can do many puzzles, each in 1 round, with everyone having his chance to compete.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On the other side we also have strict time limits. For blindfolded we often have a time limit of 20 minutes for 2 cubes.<br>
<br>
And the slower competitors can use a Stackmat or stopwatch somewhere in a corner, so that we can use up to 10 timers.<br>
<br>
This way we can handle the blindfolded competition in one hour.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
---these are both options i said would be feasible i was kind of looking for alternate options or an genereal consensus to what, if anything, should be done<br>
===================================================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think we should not criticize competitors who are slower. Everyone should have his chance.<br>
<br>
Using time limits and a limited number of attempts, we can still have many events on one day.<br>
<br>
But it takes some smart planning and smart event formats.<br>
<br>
<br>
--- i never critisized anyone for being slow, i&#x27;m just saying that things probably need to be restructured for everyone to get the most out of these competitions<br>
=============================================================<br>
<br>
<br>
A competition organizer will try to have the most popular events. The popularity of events is different in different countries.<br>
<br>
<br>
---i can appreciate this, but at the same time, why should one group of people have 3 chances to do thier event, while another group doesn&#x27;t get any<br>
==============================================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course you can always organize a competition yourself! You could even organize a two day competition. :-)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--yes i could, but this issue would probably be prevelent there too, which is why i asked what people think is best.<br>
<br>
if no one else cares, that&#x27;s ok, but i don&#x27;t see why we shouldn&#x27;t strive to make sure everyone gets the most they can out of these competitions<br>
<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">yeah i think a good idea was getting some of the people not participating being judges, as well as after a competitor gets finished with their run, they can help judge too.  with tourneys getting as big as they are if everyone judges just once or twice i&#x27;m sure the mats could stay filled.

&gt;&gt; Anyway, I think we should not criticize competitors who are slower.<br>

&gt;So you&#x27;re against time limits?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Using time limits and a limited number of attempts, we can still<br>

&gt;So you&#x27;re in favor of time limits?<br>
<br>
:-)<br>
I am not against time limits. There are two:<br>
1) time limits BEFORE the competition<br>
2) time limits DURING the competition<br>
We have to be mild with 1), everyone should have his chance.<br>
We have to be stricter with 2), otherwise we cannot stick to the time <br>
schedule and have many different events.<br>
If your first solve is not inside 2), then you cannot have more attempts. <br>
You can also do this by having combined finals.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I see 3 ways to solve this problem ... at least

Smart scheduling, combined finals and skilled officials/judges.

And the obvious: having more timers. Every participant having a 
timer should bring it and let organisers know about it.

Another more conctroversial way to deal with this is to have 
separate competetitions for bld-,oh- and feetsolving. How else are 
we gonna fit even larger olympicubes into a competition? With all 
respect id rather see 7x7x7 solving in a tournament than 3 rounds of 
magic and mastermagic. Also the clock is not a major event in my 
eyes even i do that sometimes (for fun, never practice it). I guess 
it&#x27;s simply IMPOSSIBLE to go for 3-day competitions because many 
travel far to competitions and can only stay a weekend, that&#x27;s it. 
Exceptions could be made for EC, WC and other really major 
competitions (US nationals too).

Organisers can have a look at how previous competitions like wc 2005 
and ec2006 thet were successfully organised with lots of events and 
copy the competition formats/scheduling.

Happy cubing all :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey pat,

Thanks for the advice. I do in fact pare the corner and edge pieces 
and place them into the 4 slots, but I find that I always rotate the 
cube looking for the next pare, and I only know the permutations 
from one angle. I found some good links on your web page, and i plan 
on working on the F2L bearing these new ideas in mind.


thanks again,


Casen

SUB-20 non lucky really is an achievement. Congratulations for that. :-)

But I&#x27;m sure you will get used to it....just remember how ridiculously fast
were sub20 videos with 2 hands when you were just starting speedcubing. :-)

Well, welcome in the club :-) (if there is a club :p)

          <div class="email-content">One thing that has helped me a lot is to stop thinking of forming edge<br>
pairs using &quot;algorithms&quot;, and instead, just spending time intuitively<br>
thinking about how to make pairs from different positions in as few<br>
moves as possible.... After a while you will just see what you have to<br>
do instead of thinking &quot;which algorithm is this....?&quot; Also, when you<br>
start forming an edge pair with whatever sequence of moves you need to<br>
do, dont think about doing the sequence, leave that to muscle memory<br>
to perform... Instead, take the permutation slow, and start looking<br>
for an edge or corner that you need to connect, that that way you<br>
already have half of the next pair located before you&#x27;ve even finished<br>
placing the first edge pair... That should be good for a few weeks of<br>
practice, so good luck!<br>

  The number of judges is an issue. Not everyone organizing tournaments
  has the people to run a large number of timers.

  know they are working on good ideas, but i had to bring it up here, in
  the hope as a group we can think of some good ideas to resolve the
  issue. i think at the past couple cali tournaments that bld has gotten
  totally out of control in the amount of time it takes up, to the point
  where other events and other rounds are being eliminated or less
  people are allowed to advance because of the time constraints that bld
  is imposing. i believe everyone should should have a chance, but i
  also believe 30 minutes worth of dnfs is a waste of time. competitions
  aren&#x27;t the place to practice these skills in my opinion, if you aren&#x27;t
  usually successful or take large amounts of time, i think that one
  should work at home until they can post decent and consistent times.
  maybe an elimination final, where if the first solve(s) aren&#x27;t under a
  certain time then you don&#x27;t advance, giving everyone a chance to post
  a time, but without
  > sacrificing other people&#x27;s chances to compete. possibly 2 dnfs=
  elimination? only pre registered competitiors can participate in bld?
  maybe a dedicated 2 mat table off to the side for bld competitors,

          <em>Date:</em> Wed, 15 Nov 2006 03:03:42 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Hey, all. I apologize in advance that this post will be long, but I <br>
just found this Yahoo Group and I have issues that I&#x27;ve wanted to ask <br>
about for a long time. Anyways, I&#x27;ve played around on and off with <br>
the Fridrich method of solving the cube for a long time now. I first <br>
attempted learning it probably around 7-8 years ago, and was able to <br>
memorize most of the move sequences for the F2L. I got to the point <br>
where I averaged around 25-30 seconds for just the cross + F2L, and <br>
then hit a wall. I couldn&#x27;t get any faster than that. Due to <br>
frustration my interest in the cube slowly faded, and every few <br>
months/years I would pick it up for a while, try to improve/keep up <br>
with what I had learned, not get anywhere, and stop playing with the <br>
cube again.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve read all the strategies/tips I can find, lubricated the cube, <br>
learned a lot of the finger tricks, but I&#x27;m still unable to break <br>
that 25-30 second mark for the cross + F2L.<br>
<br>
My own analysis of my problems leads me to these issues that I really <br>
would appreciate feedback on:<br>
<br>
1. Solving the cross: It takes me a really long time to do the cross. <br>
When I try to plan out the moves beforehand, the series of moves I <br>
choose require reorienting the cube several times, since it seems to <br>
require rotating all 6 sides, which I can&#x27;t do while leaving the cube <br>
in the same orientation the whole time. Since each series of 8 or so <br>
moves is different each time, I can&#x27;t seem position the cube <br>
correctly to perform the moves quickly. Generally I leave it cross-<br>
side up. Would it be better if I learned how to do it with the cross <br>
either on the side or the bottom? What are some strategies on what I <br>
can do to eliminate the need to keep turning the cube in order to <br>
rotate the desired faces?<br>
<br>
2. Finding the corner-edge combination: I have trouble locating the <br>
corner-edge combinations. Do people have a system where they look for <br>
the corner first, then find the matching edge, or vice-versa? Also, <br>
if for example you find the corner first, there are 8 possible places <br>
the matching edge could be. Is there a system for quickly noticing <br>
where that piece is?<br>
<br>
3. Positioning the pieces/cube in order to begin the F2L sequences: I <br>
can do a lot of the move sequences pretty fast. However, in order to <br>
begin the move sequence, the pieces need to be set up in the correct <br>
way, and the cube needs to be oriented so that the correct face is <br>
facing me. That takes me a long time. When I am finished with one <br>
move sequence, even *if* I have the next set located already, it <br>
takes me a lot of time to rotate the bottom layer such that the <br>
corner piece is in the right place in relation to the target <br>
location, then reorient the cube so that my hands are in the right <br>
place to begin the move sequence.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve heard all the tips about trying to minimize the number of times <br>
you need to turn the whole cube, but I can&#x27;t seem to understand how <br>
to do that when the pieces I&#x27;m trying to move to/from are on the back <br>
of the cube. Do you just have to learn a different move sequence for <br>
each orientation? How do you do that?<br>
<br>
Finally, it seems like it&#x27;s a matter of preference, but generally, do <br>
people do the F2L with the cross on the side or on the bottom? I do <br>
it on the side (the right side since I&#x27;m left-handed), but I want to <br>
try out having the cross on the bottom too. Any tips for one or the <br>
other?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance, I really want to figure out what I&#x27;ve been doing <br>
wrong all these years.<br>

:p

A competitor has to finish all his attempts before he is able to help
judging.

So what you do (as an organizer) if you lack judges for 3x3 is to have a few
people have all their attempts faster than anyone else and then they judge.

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Need lots of help


  Hey, all. I apologize in advance that this post will be long, but I 
  just found this Yahoo Group and I have issues that I&#x27;ve wanted to ask 
  about for a long time. Anyways, I&#x27;ve played around on and off with 
  the Fridrich method of solving the cube for a long time now. I first 
  attempted learning it probably around 7-8 years ago, and was able to 
  memorize most of the move sequences for the F2L. I got to the point 
  where I averaged around 25-30 seconds for just the cross + F2L, and 
  then hit a wall. I couldn&#x27;t get any faster than that. Due to 
  frustration my interest in the cube slowly faded, and every few 
  months/years I would pick it up for a while, try to improve/keep up 
  with what I had learned, not get anywhere, and stop playing with the 
  cube again.

  I&#x27;ve read all the strategies/tips I can find, lubricated the cube, 
  learned a lot of the finger tricks, but I&#x27;m still unable to break 
  that 25-30 second mark for the cross + F2L.

  My own analysis of my problems leads me to these issues that I really 
  would appreciate feedback on:

  1. Solving the cross: It takes me a really long time to do the cross. 
  When I try to plan out the moves beforehand, the series of moves I 
  choose require reorienting the cube several times, since it seems to 
  require rotating all 6 sides, which I can&#x27;t do while leaving the cube 
  in the same orientation the whole time. Since each series of 8 or so 
  moves is different each time, I can&#x27;t seem position the cube 
  correctly to perform the moves quickly. Generally I leave it cross-
  side up. Would it be better if I learned how to do it with the cross 
  either on the side or the bottom? What are some strategies on what I 
  can do to eliminate the need to keep turning the cube in order to 
  rotate the desired faces?

  2. Finding the corner-edge combination: I have trouble locating the 
  corner-edge combinations. Do people have a system where they look for 
  the corner first, then find the matching edge, or vice-versa? Also, 
  if for example you find the corner first, there are 8 possible places 
  the matching edge could be. Is there a system for quickly noticing 
  where that piece is?

  3. Positioning the pieces/cube in order to begin the F2L sequences: I 
  can do a lot of the move sequences pretty fast. However, in order to 
  begin the move sequence, the pieces need to be set up in the correct 
  way, and the cube needs to be oriented so that the correct face is 
  facing me. That takes me a long time. When I am finished with one 
  move sequence, even *if* I have the next set located already, it 
  takes me a lot of time to rotate the bottom layer such that the 
  corner piece is in the right place in relation to the target 
  location, then reorient the cube so that my hands are in the right 
  place to begin the move sequence.

  I&#x27;ve heard all the tips about trying to minimize the number of times 
  you need to turn the whole cube, but I can&#x27;t seem to understand how 
  to do that when the pieces I&#x27;m trying to move to/from are on the back 
  of the cube. Do you just have to learn a different move sequence for 
  each orientation? How do you do that?

  Finally, it seems like it&#x27;s a matter of preference, but generally, do 
  people do the F2L with the cross on the side or on the bottom? I do 
  it on the side (the right side since I&#x27;m left-handed), but I want to 
  try out having the cross on the bottom too. Any tips for one or the 
  other?

  Thanks in advance, I really want to figure out what I&#x27;ve been doing 
  wrong all these years.

          <div class="email-content">When I save CalCube and omnicalc to my computer then right click and
choose &quot;Compress with Lite8x&quot;, the window comes up and says &quot;Lite8x
was unable to recognize the program type.&quot;

Also, I downloaded TI Connect and it says something like &quot;calcube.8xp
isn&#x27;t a valid win32 application&quot;.

I used to have a timer on my calculator.  It was able to do more than
just seconds (2 digits more).  The seconds were longer than normal though.

All I want this for is the scrambles.  I need a way to get scrambles 
without being on the computer.  It&#x27;s annoying scrambling myself since
I do the same kind of turns every time.

I&#x27;m using a TI-83 Plus Silver Edition BTW.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

My current thinking is that if you are very two-handed (Ron van
Bruchem, myself, Chris Hardwick, etc) then it would be better for you
to practice cross-on-bottom.

If you are very right-handed (Lars Vandenbergh, etc) then it may be
better for you to practice cross-on-left, allowing for mostly
right-handed moves.

If you are very left-handed, maybe cross on right would work for you?!
But it is my experience that most naturally left handed people are
gifted with ambidextrousness (I did check that and that is correct ;) ).

But I don&#x27;t think there are any real speed advantages to be gained
with either method, so simply pick which one suits your style the best.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

There is no singular answer to this!

One could have cross top on top during f2l and then cross at bottom 
during PLL/OLL. Cross top while setting it up and cross left while 
completing f2l (c/e pairs) and then finally the cross at bottom 
while doing PLL/OLL is yet another option. The key is to have a good 
overview of the cube and being able to find the cubies or color 
patterns or whatever one is looking for. One can &quot;wiggle&quot; the cube 
during a sequence (alg) in order to see better. The cube does not 
have to lie *static* in prescribed position. I hope this makes sense 
to everyone;-) Transition from cross top to cross left is easier 
than a straight transition from cross top to cross bottom. Most 
sites (in fact all i know) will show algs for PLL/OLL with the cross 
at bottom (or actually more correctly with the unsolved layer on 
top). So learning those algs with cross bottom and then move the 
cross again is not easy. So basically, the *best* reason for having 
cross at bottom is to be prepared for reading sites that give 
OLL/PLL algs with cross at bottom :D There is no *proven* facts that 
say that the cross this or that way is faster than any other way. It 
has just become consensus to give LL algs with unsolved layer top. 
Back in 80&#x27;s the final unsolved last layer was almost always assumed 
to be at the bottom (B-layer). Things have changed over time :D

1 - Read the manual of ur calculator, about it&#x27;s programming 
ability!!
2 - Find out how it can generate something random like integers 
below a certain value - u may want integers 1-6 (for the 6 layers of 
the cube) (for even better results generate numbers between 1-600 
000 for instance, let 1-100000 > R , 100001-200000 > L etc... )

3 - Generate a sequence of random numbers (as many as the desired 
length of scramble sequence)

4 - For each number generate another random number to tell how to 
turn the layer represented by that number ... clockwise, 2 steps or 
ccw

5 - Display this on screen with cube notation
(1,1)=R (1,2)=R2 (1,3)=R&#x27; (2,2)=L2 and so on.

6 - Make it advanced with axis control
Disallow U&#x27;DU2 and so on

It&#x27;s not really all too hard - step 6 can be somewhat complex though.

Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">You need to be able to perform F2L C/E pairs without watching yourself
do it. Try finding the C and E you want to pair and place, then look
away and see if you can put them together and in their proper slot
without looking. Once you get good at this, instead of looking away
when pairing the C/E, look for the next set to pair while you&#x27;re
pairing and placing the current C/E pair. Then you&#x27;ll know exactly
where your next set is when it comes time.

You&#x27;ll probably have to slow way down during F2L to see what&#x27;s going
on, but you won&#x27;t have to pause to find the next pieces you need.
Practice solving without pausing, even if you have to go really slow,
it can only get easier and faster if you practice.

You should practice pairing on the backside slots too, it helps alot,
even though it&#x27;s kind of backwards tricky at first, it isn&#x27;t too tough.

Good luck!

But, I don&#x27;t know programming.  Every cuber seems to know all kinds of
math and programming.

I looked through my manual but didn&#x27;t see anything about programming.

I wanted to be able to do this by myself after your nice post but I
can&#x27;t.  I understood what you were saying, I just don&#x27;t know how to do it.

averager for TI-83 Silver Edition in Basic if you&#x27;re interested. The
timer isn&#x27;t really all that great...I think of it as more of an
approximation of a time. If the solve is over 30 seconds, then it
becomes around 1 second off.

          <div class="email-content">What do you mean by practicing pairing on the backside slots? Doesn&#x27;t 
placing the C/E pair into the back slots without rotating the entire 
cube mean that you would have to turn the back face sometimes? The 
way I hold the cube, that&#x27;s pretty difficult. I hold the cube with my 
non-turning hand on the bottom 2x2x3 cubes, which leaves my turning 
hand available to turn the top and side faces freely, but makes it 
difficult to turn the other 4 faces without moving my other hand. Is 
there a different way to hold it so that more faces are available for 
turning?

Does this also mean that you guys learn several different ways to do 
the same move sequence for a certain C/E pair, depending not only on 
the location of the corner and edge pieces in relation to each other, 
but also where those pieces are relative to your hand position, slot 
location, etc?

          <div class="email-content">They don&#x27;t learn different ways of doing it, it&#x27;s the same way, just
from a different angle.

To do the back slots, just reposition your hands a little and you can
do B/B&#x27; like you do U/U&#x27;

For B&#x27; reposition only your left hand so that your 4 fingers on all on
D with your index finger on the bottom of DBL and keep your thumb on
the U center.

          <div class="email-content">I do feel that I&#x27;m fairly ambidextrous. Do you mean that you twist 
the faces with both hands? Do you also do the entire move sequences 
during the F2L with both hands then, depending on the location and 
orientation of the pieces?

I find that when I do this, simply the process of switching hands 
slows me down. You have to turn with one hand, then grip the cube 
with that same hand, then release the cube with the other hand, then 
turn with the other hand. How is that faster than doing everything 
with one hand?

          <div class="email-content">It is not always faster to not rotate.  Often times it is quicker to rotate and to do a B move than to do it from an odd angel.

&quot;Does this also mean that you guys learn several different ways to do 
the same move sequence for a certain C/E pair, depending not only on 
the location of the corner and edge pieces in relation to each other, 
but also where those pieces are relative to your hand position, slot 
location, etc?&quot;

Yes, you learn to insert the C/E pairs from all angels, holding the cube 1 way.

  What do you mean by practicing pairing on the backside slots? Doesn&#x27;t 
  placing the C/E pair into the back slots without rotating the entire 
  cube mean that you would have to turn the back face sometimes? The 
  way I hold the cube, that&#x27;s pretty difficult. I hold the cube with my 
  non-turning hand on the bottom 2x2x3 cubes, which leaves my turning 
  hand available to turn the top and side faces freely, but makes it 
  difficult to turn the other 4 faces without moving my other hand. Is 
  there a different way to hold it so that more faces are available for 
  turning?

  Does this also mean that you guys learn several different ways to do 
  the same move sequence for a certain C/E pair, depending not only on 
  the location of the corner and edge pieces in relation to each other, 
  but also where those pieces are relative to your hand position, slot 
  location, etc?

          <div class="email-content">Translucent as in a given color? Or clear?  I think that if you ask from
cubesmith you might be able to get tiles without the white backing on them,
which will make them translucent, although I&#x27;m not sure.

About the LED cube, cool!!  What exactly is it?  A light up cube?  Do the
light&#x27;s change colors? etc.

&gt; I do feel that I&#x27;m fairly ambidextrous. Do you mean that you twist <br>
&gt; the faces with both hands? Do you also do the entire move sequences <br>
&gt; during the F2L with both hands then, depending on the location and <br>
&gt; orientation of the pieces?<br>
<br>
Yes, that&#x27;s right, but commonly for each pair you use either L and U<br>
or R and U, but have no preference which. F2L moves which contain L R<br>
and U to solve one pair are rare.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I find that when I do this, simply the process of switching hands <br>
&gt; slows me down. You have to turn with one hand, then grip the cube <br>
&gt; with that same hand, then release the cube with the other hand, then <br>
&gt; turn with the other hand. How is that faster than doing everything <br>
&gt; with one hand?<br>
&gt; <br>
It&#x27;s not necessarily faster, but I think it&#x27;s more easy to be fluent.<br>
It is my experience that GENERALLY two handed people solve with less<br>
delays but slower, more fluent turn rates, whereas one handed people<br>
have a very high turn rate, but with a few pauses between pairs.<br>
Don&#x27;t forget, if you just use onehand, you will have to rotate more<br>
than someone who uses both hands to solve into both R and L side F2L<br>
slots. So the time taken to regrip (minimal) is matched by the time<br>
taken to rotate (minimal)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll be there Saturday.  Bob, things have been intense.  And my free 
time wasn&#x27;t as free as I thought, so my proposed events aren&#x27;t most 
likely going to occur.  I surely am not ready for 5x5x5 bld.
I was almost in an accident Thursday night, so I&#x27;m a little tense 
still ...

If anybody has some x-centers for a rubik&#x27;s 5x5x5, I&#x27;d appreciate it 
if I could buy three of them!  This is in reference to cubers 
participating at Rutgers Fall 2006.  If I don&#x27;t get the x-centers  
I&#x27;ll just have to buy them after the competition.

Later,

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
We are working hard on a new website for WCA and a great database <br>
with all competition results.<br>
Most work at the moment is done by Stefan Pochmann, who is creating <br>
all pages for the database (persons, competitions, records and events <br>
and subpages).<br>
We have had help from many people, among others Gilles van den <br>
Peereboom, Frank Morris and Per Kristen Fredlund. Clément Gallet will <br>
help us with the design of the new WCA website.<br>
<br>
One feature of the database is that you can make nice selections.<br>
Here are some.<br>
<br>
People who competed in 10 or more official competitions:<br>
Ton Dennenbroek	18<br>
Leyan Lo	17<br>
Ron van Bruchem	17<br>
Jaap Scherphuis	14<br>
Lars Petrus	13<br>
Lars Vandenbergh	13<br>
Shotaro Makisumi	13<br>
Bob Burton	12<br>
Mike Grimsley	12<br>
Stefan Pochmann	12<br>
Tyson Mao	12<br>
Joël van Noort	11<br>
Kåre Krig	11<br>
Shelley Chang	11<br>
Adam Zamora	10<br>
Bill McGaugh	10<br>
Frank Morris	10<br>
Gunnar Krig	10<br>
Koen Heltzel	10<br>
Ryan Patricio	10<br>
<br>
Number of competitors who successfully solved a Rubik&#x27;s 3x3 Cube in <br>
an official competition:<br>
1177<br>
<br>
Average best time of top 100 best 3x3 solvers:<br>
14.54 seconds<br>
<br>
Number of different countries:<br>
36<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
Just as a reminder, the Berkeley Fall Tournament is tomorrow. <br>
Registration is from 9:30am to 10 am and then the tournament starts<br>
promptly at 10 am.  For people going, the place you want to enter the<br>
campus is at the corner of Hearst Ave and Euclid Ave.  You will want<br>
to enter the campus, then go around the building on your left.  The<br>
room is to the left after you turn the corner.  I will try and have<br>
poster board signs up so that it is easier to find but I&#x27;m not sure if<br>
they are allowed and they might be taken down.<br>
<br>
Here is the address on google maps: <br>
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Hearst+Ave+%26+Euclid+Ave,+Berkeley,+CA+94709&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=37.874978,-122.260025&amp;spn=0.012415,0.029697&amp;t=h&amp;om=1<br>
<br>
And here is a photo showing where you need to go: <br>
http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b103/dkwired/directions.jpg<br>
<br>
Oh, and the green X is a parking garage that you have to pay to park<br>
in but it is allowed.  If you find parking on the street it will<br>
probably be free and but you have to look for it.  If you have any<br>
questions, send an email to berkeleycubeclub@... and I will try<br>
and answer them.  Hope to see you there!<br>

time was somewhere around two and a half minutes? Sorry I can&#x27;t remember
exactly, but it was something between 2 and 3 minutes.

Ron and the other Dutch cubers, and the Belgian cubers, are currently on
their way to the airport. I&#x27;m sure Ron will post the full results as
soon as he gets a chance.

BTW, the UK Open was lots of fun!! :)

You will be pleased to hear that Shelley came away with a resounding
victory in the BLD event, unlike me, who still didn&#x27;t get one right!

In the 3x3x3:
1. Lars Vandenbergh
2. Dan Harris
3. Ron van Bruchem

4x4x4: 
1. Lars Vandenbergh
2. Ron van Bruchem
3. Dan Harris

5x5x5:
1. Ron van Bruchem
2. Lars Vandenbergh
3. Dan Harris

Other event results, and times and everything else, will be made
available as soon as I receive them from Mr Hedley Jones.

Thanks!

Dan :)

As for writing out the program&#x27;s code, it is rather long. My cousin

will take you a long time to punch it in though =P.

Yeah, please keep working on that thing just in case I can&#x27;t make a

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

I think it is the number of competitions won by a person from a country.

Here is another nice statistic.
In the top 100 solves on 3x3 cube the #100 solve was done by Mitsuki Gunji 
with 13.53 seconds.
Other people in top 100 are:
Shotaro Makisumi 25
Jean Pons 8
Joï¿½l van Noort 7
Leyan Lo 7
Ryan Patricio 7
Anssi Vanhala 5
Dan Dzoan 3
Darren Kwong 3
Lars Vandenbergh 3
Ravi Fernando 3
Andrew Kang 2
Dan Harris 2
Edouard Chambon 2
Franï¿½ois Sechet 2
Thibaut Jacquinot 2
Toby Mao 2
Anthony Hsu 1
Bernett Orlando 1

Chris Dzoan 1
Chris Hardwick 1
Dave Campbell 1
Gilles van den Peereboom 1
Gunnar Krig 1
Jason Baum 1
Matt Walter 1
Mitsuki Gunji 1
Quinn Lewis 1
Ron van Bruchem 1
Takahito Domon 1
Tomasz Zolnowski 1
Tyson Mao 1
Yoon Seon-Gyu 1

In the top 100 averages on 3x3 cube the #99 solve was done by Yuki Hayashi, 
Ryan Patricio and Takahito Domon, with 15.85 seconds average.
Other people in top 100 are:
Shotaro Makisumi 19
Ryan Patricio 10
Joï¿½l van Noort 9
Lars Vandenbergh 9
Leyan Lo 8

Btw. in my original post I forgot to mention a crucial point.
Josef Jelinek is the person who started all this. The work we are doing now 
is based on his initial efforts.

Have fun,

Ron

Unfortunately, that was his slowest solve that counted toward the
average. (He had a DNF in the previous attempt). Still, that average
is a new world record, so here is that last attempt anyway:

Nah, that would look like this (assuming &quot;winning a competition&quot; 
means winning its 3x3 event):

17	Japan
14	USA
9	Netherlands
7	Sweden
5	France
4	Belgium
3	Canada
2	Finland
2	Germany
2	Poland
2	Spain
1	Hungary
1	Korea
1	Taiwan

And here are the winners:

11	Shotaro Makisumi
5	Joël van Noort
5	Leyan Lo
4	Gunnar Krig
4	Lars Vandenbergh
4	Ron van Bruchem
3	Matt Walter
3	Yuki Hayashi
2	Anssi Vanhala
2	Ernesto Fernández Regueira
2	Frank Morris
2	Takahito Domon
1	Anthony Hsu
1	Bertrand Bordage
1	Chris Hunt
1	Dan Knights
1	Edouard Chambon
1	Jean Pons
1	Joe Allen
1	Johan Hillerström
1	Kazuya Kawamoto
1	Lars Petrus
1	Micael Hellberg
1	Michel Bechtatou
1	Ming-Hao Kang
1	Minh Thai
1	Mitko Prodanov
1	Piotr Kózka
1	Ryan Patricio
1	Stefan Pochmann

Frank was right, I listed number of competitions per country.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
Your program looks like a great start. 

I did some basic modifications to the code to save space, heres what I
got: http://pastebin.com/829136

Take a look at the &quot;The 1337 Guide to TI-BASIC&quot; for more tips on
saving space (very important on a calculator) and speeding up the
program: http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/369/36993.html

Feel free to email me with any questions or code at pjgat09 (_AT_)
gmail (...DoT...). com

Good luck, and happy programming.

But where can I get those white cubes from? Particularly to Ron and

like that? I remember Sean saying that he didn&#x27;t do much at all, just
lube it.

          <div class="email-content">Hehe... ok I&#x27;ll explain it, I don&#x27;t think anyone will get it anyway.

Those 16 guys all had an 18.90 seconds 3x3 solve. It&#x27;s the time with 
the most persons. Well, 19.40 actually appeared 18 times, but three 
people had it twice, so only 15 people got it.

Yes I know, a pretty useless statistic. But fooling around with the 
database is fun.

Cheers!

Yes, that&#x27;s what I understood.  I was not allowed a 2nd attempt since
my first attempt exceeded the announced 10-minute time limit (and was
not successful either). Anyway, it does now correctly show up as &quot;DNS&quot;
for the 2nd attempt in the results.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan,

You can find some for sale at this thread:

http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5117

I ordered some from this guy, and the quality of the cubes are 
superb.  He has them in different colors, including white.  The 
pieces are identical to Rubiks.com, except the center caps are much 
better.  They are like the Studio Cube caps that snap on and stay 
on.  But they still have arches like the Rubiks.com DIY kits.  The 
screws, washers, and stickers are the only weak part of the kits.  
The washers are all weird sizes.  The screws are different depending 
which color kit.  The stickers are vinyl flourescent but they aren&#x27;t 
perfectly square.  I use Cubesmith stickers and tiles, anyway.  I&#x27;d 
post pictures, but he already has good pictures up there.

Chris

You&#x27;re still in the that top-100-solves list, so stop whining. Jess 
Bonde for example isn&#x27;t even in the top-100-solvers anymore! Place 
100 is Jamie Ding with 16.30 seconds.

          <div class="email-content">AAh, I just assumed it was connected to the computer, because at the 
end of the video, he films the screen showing his times, however I 
didnt notice him typing. It isn&#x27;t all that important though, a timer 
is a timer. I took a look at those DIY kits on the twisty puzzle 
forum...they look shady, and the screws and washers look a bit 
mismatched. I just wish rubiks.com would restock already.

          <div class="email-content">That was one freak of a 12.89 second solve at the World Championships.  
How hilarious...

Well, I guess I&#x27;m constantly reminded how slow I am by that creature 
that sleeps in the room next door to mine.  What a punk.  He used to 
play World of Warcraft... and I used to be fast.  Now he&#x27;s fast, but I 
don&#x27;t play World of Warcraft.

Perhaps that&#x27;s the secret?

          <div class="email-content">I believe the top 5 3x3x3 solves at Rutgers were:

1) 12.71 Anthony Hsu
2) 13.02 Dave Campbell
3) 13.44 Jason Baum
4) 13.56 Anthony Hsu
5) 13.69 Matt Walter

My videos of these solves can be downloaded from these links:

#1) http://tinyurl.com/yj9fq2

#2) http://tinyurl.com/yn8pon

#3) http://tinyurl.com/ydp3q4

#4) http://tinyurl.com/yel9m5

#5) http://tinyurl.com/yzq25k

Okay, so I only got the tail end of Jason&#x27;s 13.44 solve and also
missed a little of the beginning of Anthony&#x27;s 13.56 solve. 

Enjoy!

Sadly there are no (good) sites about fewest moves techniques that i 
know of. I would however recommend to have a look at methods such as 
Petrus for building blocks (also Roux for a different block first 
approach). There&#x27;s a few commutator pages like Roux&#x27; or Joel van 
Noort&#x27;s. Also studying solutions at dan&#x27;s fewest moves challenge is 
a good start. Commutators are used for constructing for instance 
edge or corner 3-cycles for insertion.

Sorry to dig this out again, but I&#x27;d like to clarify my point. The 
sub10 average claim stated like that is impossible to prove wrong. If 
you&#x27;re wrong, at no time can this be proven because you can always 
say &quot;wait a little longer and you&#x27;ll see&quot;. But if you&#x27;re right and 
someone does get sub10, you can then play the glorious prophet and 
say &quot;I called it!&quot;. It&#x27;s like a bet designed to be impossible to 
lose. A good bet should include the possibility to prove each side. 
In the above case, I suggest you be brave enough to add something 
like &quot;in the next three years&quot;.

Cheers!
Stefan

the week before.  The level of competition there was extremely high as well
with 53 competitors.  It should be noted, however, that Macky does math now
instead of Rubik&#x27;s Cube, so we were all extremely impressed at his
astonishing level of cubing with no practice.

Macky, you should really just stop getting such good grades in Math 1A and
just cube instead.  At this point, I bet you could avoid turning in every
single homework set, and probably skip taking the exam, and still pass the
class... unless you really want that P+.

<br>
I am now in the final steps for organizing Belgian Open 2007.<br>
Nothing is sure yet about these 2 events (4x4 and 5x5 Blindfolded) but<br>
what were the time limits for these events in previous competitions ?<br>
<br>
I couldn&#x27;t find that information on speedcubing.com.<br>
<br>
Also, how were these events organized in a practical way ?<br>
<br>
Because I won&#x27;t be able to offer a separate area. If people want to<br>
compete in that, all I can do is give them a table in a corner of the<br>
room and have someone look at them from time to time.<br>
Obviously these won&#x27;t be optimal conditions. I even wonder if the<br>
event would be official under these circumstances.<br>
<br>
(or I can make it unofficial, that would be a lot easier to organize)<br>
<br>
What do you think ?<br>

Personally, it doesn&#x27;t make sense if someone takes 15 minutes that they get
5 minutes for a second attempt.  If someone fails after 15 minutes, would
they really have much of a chance of solving the cube in 5?

First of all, you don&#x27;t know what caused those 15 minutes. Maybe he 
can do it in five but realized a huge mistake and tried to fix it an 
enormously complicated way or even learn something during the process.

Also: What do you say about 10:01 for the first attempt? Should he 
get another attempt in the remaining 9:59? If yes, please specify 
where you draw the line and explain why you draw it there. If no, 
please explain why there&#x27;s a combined attempts time limit when it&#x27;s 
in fact a 10 minutes per attempt limit (*).

Cheers!

Perhaps he did mess up, but if he spend 10 minutes trying to fix something,
that&#x27;s probably not a wise decision.  I don&#x27;t really care how someone goes
about fixing their solution, but if the total time is 15 minutes, I don&#x27;t
think they should get a second attempt if the time constraints of the
competition do not allow it.

<br>
There are no official time limits, because memorization time is included.<br>
<br>
There are of course practical time limits. For WC 2005 we had a time frame of 3 hours for 4x4 and 5x5 blindfolded.<br>
During that time frame competitors could do best of 2 for both events.<br>
But they could miss other events, because we had some events in parallel.<br>
<br>
Normally we have a separate room for 4x4 and 5x5 blindfolded.<br>
If that is not possible, then a table in a corner would do too. If of course the competitors are willing to compete under those circumstances. Otherwise there can not be such an event.<br>
Normally I keep an eye on competitors competing in a corner. Also from an angle where they cannot see me. You can also have shifts for judges.<br>
<br>
Why have an event, if you do not follow official rules? It is not that much harder to make it official.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmm...

Are clear plastic cubes allowed? Rule 3h forbids modifications that 
make &quot;more colours/pieces are visible&quot;. Question is, what do we 
consider a modification? Does it only mean modifications done by the 
competitor? Or also modifications done by the manufacturer? I&#x27;d say 
both, because otherwise you could simply come up with a manufacturer 
that does the modification for you that you yourself aren&#x27;t allowed 
to do, thereby rendering the rule useless.

Opinions?

          <div class="email-content">A 10-minute limit (per attempt) means only Stackmat timing is needed;
stopwatch timing is not needed. Since a stopwatch was not used, it was
not measured how much over 10 minutes I took. I would assume the judge
could have stopped me when the timer shut off, and freed up the
Stackmat station for another competitor to use, but he let me continue.

I thought that to make it official, it had to happen in a separate quiet

It should be possible then to have these events.

What about 3x3 speedblindfolded and 3x3 multiple blindfolded ?
Can they happen in the same conditions to make them official ?

Something &quot;similar&quot; has been discussed before; mixing black and 
white diy-kits. The consensus/practice/conclusion is that it should 
not be allowed to mix cubies of different colors as this may give 
benefits wrt recognition amongst other things. Now, transparent 
cubes will still have all cubies the same &quot;color&quot;. So personally i 
see no problem with that at all. It might even be a handicap to have 
tranpsarency, no benefit at all :-o

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles,

3x3 speed blindfolded and 3x3 multiple blindfolded are not official events of WCA.
For the 2007 version of WCA regulations we will make a decision on these events.
So feel free to give your feedback, once we have a draft version ready.

Have fun,

Ron

  In that case I think we will have 4x4 and 5x5 Blindfolded official.

  I thought that to make it official, it had to happen in a separate quiet
  area.
  It should be possible then to have these events.

  What about 3x3 speedblindfolded and 3x3 multiple blindfolded ?
  Can they happen in the same conditions to make them official ?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron, Gilles,

I have one thing I&#x27;d like to say about speed blindfolded and 
multiple cubes blindfolded.

I like the idea of having them be official, especially since we have 
already set official records for them.

However I understand that the time constraints of adding this event 
can kill the smoothness of a competition and make for time problems.

I have two solutions to propose for debate, since I do like the idea 
of having speed 3x3 blindfolded and multiple 3x3 blindfolded be 
official events.

1) Run an official event for both speed blindfolded and multiple 
cubes blindfolded and try to work it into the schedule as best as 
possible.  However, if a competitior in the speed blindfolded or 
multiple cubes blindfolded misses another event in which he or she 
is competition, they automatically forfeit that round.

There are two problems with this.  What if the person who is 2nd 
place in the 3x3x3 speed round decides to do multiple cubes 
blindfolded and runs over past the time allotted for the 3x3x3 semi-
finals.  This person then forfeits the semi-final round and thus 
should not be allowed to advance to the finals.  However, what if 
their time in the 1st round is actually better than all the time in 
the final round (due to nerves in the final, etc.)  Should this 
person be allowed the 1st place and winning slot in the tournament?

I don&#x27;t know the answer to that question, which is why I only 
proposed this idea for debate.

2) The second idea, also open to debate, is to allow for record 
attempts.  The WCA board should appoint people who are certified 
judges for record attempts.  This would be similar to how we handle 
the 24 hour cubing marathon.  If someone wants to break the multiple 
cubes blindfolded record, that person would contact the WCA board.  
The board then appoints a judge closest to the competitior.  It is 
the competitor&#x27;s and judge&#x27;s responsibility to arrange an official 
meeting place (i.e. with media attention preferrably, and done in a 
public setting where spectators are aware of what is going on and 
have plenty of space to sit and watch).  Then the event is handled 
exactly as if it were at a competition, only that is the only event.

I see a problem with this idea that needs to be debated or fixed 
before anything like this can happen.  There is a larger 
concentration of cubers on the west coast US than the east coast US, 
making it easier to find a judge in your area, and thus easier to 
attempt a record.  This of course applies to other areas with sparse 
cubers who want to attempt records as compared to areas with lots of 
cubers who want to attempt records, I only gave the one example 
since it&#x27;s the area I am more knowledgable about.

---------

I think it would be good to keep the 3x3x3 speed blindfolded and 
3x3x3 multiple cubes blindfolded for a couple reasons.  1) We 
already have records for them, 2) They are amazing categories and 
sure to please an audience, the media/press, and also cubers alike 
who see the results of these events.  I think these events are 
positive for the cubing community, and am willing to help come up 
with ideas for keeping them.

I understand if time constraints mean we can&#x27;t keep them, as I&#x27;ve 
helped out for competitions before where we cut the allotted time 
very close.  However, I think it would be nice to keep these 
categories.

Those are just two ideas I had, and I&#x27;m willing to change/debate 
them in any way necessary to try to help keep these events, as I 
think they are positive for our community, despite the challenges of 
holding these events in a competition.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I cannot give my opinion about your second proposal but I can do it for the
first one.

Here is a &quot;nearly final&quot; version of the Belgian Open 2007 Schedule :
http://gillesvdp.orgfree.com/belgianopen2007/Time_Schedule.htm

- I place these events on the day without the main 3x3 competition and they
do not have a fixed schedule, making it for a competitor to have more
freedom to choose his events.
Actually at first it was scheduled that these competitions are limited in
the morning. But what if the competitor doesn&#x27;t want to compete in 4x4 and
5x5 at all ? Then I think it should be made possible.
The only problem with this is the judges. Last year I really had troubles to
find judges to make the competition very smooth. These events will only make
the problem bigger. So I am really thinking to limit these events between
9:30 and 13:00 for example. But this remains to be decided.

- As for going to the final without competing in the 2nd round, I think
that&#x27;s just not possible. But WCA experts will have a better opinion.

(If anyone has comments about Belgian Open 2007 schedule, please send them
to me at gillesvdp [@] skynet.be )

Bye !
Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

My main concern for these events is the time for memorization.

What is better:
= someone solving speed blindfolded in 20 seconds, after 6 hours of memorization
or
= someone solving speed blindfolded in 25 seconds, after 30 minutes of memorization.

Same goes for multiple blindfolded.

What are your ideas in that subject?

Have fun,

Ron

  Hey Ron, Gilles,

  I have one thing I&#x27;d like to say about speed blindfolded and 
  multiple cubes blindfolded.

  I like the idea of having them be official, especially since we have 
  already set official records for them.

  However I understand that the time constraints of adding this event 
  can kill the smoothness of a competition and make for time problems.

  I have two solutions to propose for debate, since I do like the idea 
  of having speed 3x3 blindfolded and multiple 3x3 blindfolded be 
  official events.

  1) Run an official event for both speed blindfolded and multiple 
  cubes blindfolded and try to work it into the schedule as best as 
  possible. However, if a competitior in the speed blindfolded or 
  multiple cubes blindfolded misses another event in which he or she 
  is competition, they automatically forfeit that round.

  There are two problems with this. What if the person who is 2nd 
  place in the 3x3x3 speed round decides to do multiple cubes 
  blindfolded and runs over past the time allotted for the 3x3x3 semi-
  finals. This person then forfeits the semi-final round and thus 
  should not be allowed to advance to the finals. However, what if 
  their time in the 1st round is actually better than all the time in 
  the final round (due to nerves in the final, etc.) Should this 
  person be allowed the 1st place and winning slot in the tournament?

  I don&#x27;t know the answer to that question, which is why I only 
  proposed this idea for debate.

  2) The second idea, also open to debate, is to allow for record 
  attempts. The WCA board should appoint people who are certified 
  judges for record attempts. This would be similar to how we handle 
  the 24 hour cubing marathon. If someone wants to break the multiple 
  cubes blindfolded record, that person would contact the WCA board. 
  The board then appoints a judge closest to the competitior. It is 
  the competitor&#x27;s and judge&#x27;s responsibility to arrange an official 
  meeting place (i.e. with media attention preferrably, and done in a 
  public setting where spectators are aware of what is going on and 
  have plenty of space to sit and watch). Then the event is handled 
  exactly as if it were at a competition, only that is the only event.

  I see a problem with this idea that needs to be debated or fixed 
  before anything like this can happen. There is a larger 
  concentration of cubers on the west coast US than the east coast US, 
  making it easier to find a judge in your area, and thus easier to 
  attempt a record. This of course applies to other areas with sparse 
  cubers who want to attempt records as compared to areas with lots of 
  cubers who want to attempt records, I only gave the one example 
  since it&#x27;s the area I am more knowledgable about.

  ---------

  I think it would be good to keep the 3x3x3 speed blindfolded and 
  3x3x3 multiple cubes blindfolded for a couple reasons. 1) We 
  already have records for them, 2) They are amazing categories and 
  sure to please an audience, the media/press, and also cubers alike 
  who see the results of these events. I think these events are 
  positive for the cubing community, and am willing to help come up 
  with ideas for keeping them.

  I understand if time constraints mean we can&#x27;t keep them, as I&#x27;ve 
  helped out for competitions before where we cut the allotted time 
  very close. However, I think it would be nice to keep these 
  categories.

  Those are just two ideas I had, and I&#x27;m willing to change/debate 
  them in any way necessary to try to help keep these events, as I 
  think they are positive for our community, despite the challenges of 
  holding these events in a competition.

I have another major objection against &quot;multiple&quot;.
I can&#x27;t imagine a good format (after all we said on the WCA forum).
A competitor who takes time to solve only 1 cube without risks beats
another who &quot;only&quot; solves 7 out of 8...

I think a standard blindfold solving event is enough for official
competitions, even if the list of new specialized challenges and
records that could be interesting is much longer.
If there&#x27;s a large community that wants it, it&#x27;s different, but at
least find a good format.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Anders,

I think there is good validity in this.  For the final of a major tournament
where everyone is very fast, it is actually feasible to do an average of 10
(12 solves, truncating fastest and slowest) and it might be exciting to
watch because you have more solves the count.

Dan Dzoan is great... don&#x27;t get me wrong, but that 14.41 second average was
crazy fast, and most likely not representative of what he does on a more
normal (human-state, not powered by the vessels of anima) average.

I think it&#x27;s something that could be discussed with the WCA Board.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

I think ideally the solve done in 20 seconds, despite 6 hours of 
memorization should be considered the better solve.  This is because 
for speed blindfolded only the solving time should count.  I would 
also say that a person solving in 20.00 seconds who memorized in 6 
hours ties a person who solves in 20.00 seconds who memorized in 2 
hours.  This is because of our definition of speed blindfolded.

We could ammend this category by saying that the memorization time 
does count.  However this turns back into the regular blindfolded 
solving where you try to memorize and solve in roughly the same 
amount of time.

As for competitions I agree that someone memorizing for 6 hours 
poses a problem, because this person needs to be supervised by a 
judge for the entirity of that time.

I personally like the idea of having the WCA recognize records in 
the same way that Guinness does.  If you break a record under the 
scrutiny of a WCA appointed judge/delegate/observer of records, and 
this attempt is done in a public setting with media and spectators, 
then that should be the new world record.

This lets the majority of competitors focus on the mainstream events 
and lets the minority who focus on fringe events do so without 
holding up the main competition.

As one example at an official tournament you can have an official 
WCA world record judge to let people attempt the weirder records.  
These people attempting would not be allowed to compete in the 
official &quot;mainstream&quot; event running alongside it.

This is just an idea.  I know there has already been strong 
opposition to the idea of a WCA judge who judges record attempts not 
done in an official competition, and probably rightly so.  I get the 
impression my ideas usually have more problems than good, I&#x27;m just 
trying to help out.

I know that I will continue to focus on the big cubes BLD categories 
very seriously because I don&#x27;t see how I could ever catch up to the 
new standards of mainstream speedcubing.  After competing in big 
cubes BLD so many times though I realize how much of a burden it is 
on the competition.  That&#x27;s exactly why almost every time I have 
competed in the big cubes BLD events (except US Nationals) I have 
helped scramble/judge/etc. rather than compete in many if any other 
events.

If people like me want to practice a weirder category so much, why 
restrict us from doing it if we&#x27;re willing to make concessions on 
regular mainstream events at a competition?  I&#x27;m perfectly willing 
to give up 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and other speed events in order to get my 
two attempts per cube for the big cubes BLD event.

Why shouldn&#x27;t someone else be able to do multiple cubes blindfolded 
or speed 3x3 blindfolded assuming they are willing to give up other 
events and help judge/etc.?

For some tournaments I realize the judge shortage makes not even 
this concession possible.  Yes I have helped out as a judge at 
tournaments before, so I know how hard it is to fill the timers when 
you don&#x27;t have enough judges.

I just feel like the &quot;fringe&quot; events are looked down on by people 
who compete in the more &quot;mainstream&quot; events, since they take away 
from the mainstream events.  This is rightly so because usually the 
fringe event competitiors are also mainstream event competitors, and 
that causes problems for time at a tournament.

But if us fringe event people are willing to give up competing in 
mainstream events, shouldn&#x27;t that fix the problem?

You could make it a condition of competing in big cubes BLD, speed 
3x3 BLD, and multiple 3x3 BLD that you must help judge the main 
events and must not compete in those events so that you don&#x27;t hold 
up the tournaments.

I would be willing to do this for big cubes BLD, since I&#x27;ve seen how 
much of a burden it is to compete in my favorite events.  I would be 
perfectly willing to accept that as a condition of getting 2 solves 
per big cube BLD event.

If someone wants to do multiple 3x3 BLD, or speed 3x3 BLD, but is 
not willing to compromise on helping make the competition run more 
smoothly, then they obviously don&#x27;t want to compete in those events 
enough and it would be understandable to not allow those events.

If we are willing to make concessions, why should the event always 
and forever be made unofficial at the expense of those who do enjoy 
practicing those events?

I realize that I am speaking more in theory.  I realize that you 
can&#x27;t please everybody all of the time.  All I&#x27;m saying is that as 
a &quot;fringe event&quot; competitor I am willing to make concessions to help 
make sure the tournament runs more smoothly when I attempt the 
bigger cubes BLD, and I think making this a requirement for these 
fringe events could make it easier to have them at competitions.

As always these are just suggestions, I know the ultimate decision 
rests with the community and the WCA board.  I just think it would 
be nice to allow people to focus on the categories they love and/or 
are good at, even if that event is not a mainstream speedcubing 
event.  This is, of course, under the condition that those fringe 
event people are willing to make concessions in order to make the 
overall competition they are at run smoothly enough to please 
everyone.

Well...I don&#x27;t really use the transparentness as an advantage. Not
consciously at least...may be subconsciously o.O
Yu-Jeong Min always use that cube for avgs, and he&#x27;s pretty fast. So
are you saying he&#x27;s fast because he could &quot;look through&quot; it? I
personally don&#x27;t think that I can make out much of the other face&#x27;s
colours from the clear pastic anyways.

Is it possible to turn the transparency off? Then you could see how 
much it affects you.

Yes I also agree that someone who attempts and solves one cube 
should not outdo someone who attempts 8 and solves &quot;only&quot; 7 even 
though our current rules have that happen.

Why not a points system, similar to how the memory experts do 
things?  I don&#x27;t fully understand their system, but if someone 
attempts to memorize 4000 binary digits and only correctly recalls 
3800 of them, they don&#x27;t consider the attempt a 100% total and 
complete failure, they just adjust the score so that it appears the 
person memorized 3700-3800 or something like that.

This is of course a simplified explanation, since I don&#x27;t fully 
understand how an incorrectly recalled piece of information affects 
their score.

Maybe instead of considering attempting 8 and solving 7 a 100% 
complete and total failure something like this.  You get 2 points 
for successfully solving an attempted cube, and -1 points for each 
cube attempted and DNF&#x27;d.  So attempting 1 and solving 1 is 2 
poinst.  Attempting 8 and solving 7 is 7*(2)-1=13 points.  So the 
person who attempted 8 and solved 7 still soundly beats the person 
who attempted and solved one, which is what should happen in my 
opinion.

Just a thought.  I would suggest that if this is something of 
interest that we should find a point system that works best for 
cubing, rather than modeling the points system for memory sports 
exactly without any change.  But then again I shouldn&#x27;t say much 
since I don&#x27;t understand their system very well.

If you want to check your scrambles with the View Scramble command,
you have to use single-layer turns, though.

BTW, it seems that the View Scramble command for 5x5x5 doesn&#x27;t work.
It seems to show rather minimally scrambled cubes (at least the

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I borrowed my sister&#x27;s TI-83 and ported over the scrambling
algorithm generator from my TI-89 cube timer program.  It&#x27;s kind of
long, but I tested it and it works on hers.  I&#x27;ll post the code here
so if you (or anyone) feels like typing it in you certainly may.

Notes:
The program is not 100% wca compliant because each turn is necessarily
in a layer orthogonal to the layer the previous twist: example - You
will never see B B&#x27; but nor will you see B F2 .

The scrambles are of random length between 20 and 27 twists long.

When programming, I will use &quot;->&quot; to denote the &quot;sto&quot; button.  Also,
it is important to utilize the built in calculator commands instead of
typing them out: example - Instead of typing &quot;IF&quot; hit &quot;prgm&quot; then
scroll to &quot;If&quot; and press &quot;enter&quot;

Anything after a &quot;//&quot; should not be typed it&#x27;s just information I&#x27;m
giving you.

Every time you hit &quot;Enter&quot; it automatically adds the &quot;:&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t
matter if your line of code wraps past the edge of the screen.

And please all you professional coders, keep the criticism to a
minimum, coding&#x27;s just a hobby for me =P I&#x27;m never very elegant nor
efficient!

Without further ado:
Hit &quot;prgm&quot; then &quot;new&quot; and press &quot;enter&quot;
Title your program, I use &quot;qb&quot;

&lt;code>
:ClrHome // found under &quot;catalog&quot; (2nd then 0)
:iPart(rand6)->M //iPart is found under &quot;Math&quot;->&quot;num&quot; 
//rand is under &quot;Math&quot;->&quot;prb&quot;
:iPart(rand7)->A
:(A+20)->A
:3->Y
:1->X
:Output(1,2,&quot;SCRAMBLING ALG&quot;) //Output is found under &quot;prgm&quot;->&quot;I/O&quot;
:0->S
:Lbl t //Lbl is found under &quot;Prgm&quot;->&quot;CTL&quot;
:S+1->S
:M->L
:Lbl R
:iPart(rand6)->M
:If M=L //if is found under &quot;Prgm&quot;->&quot;CTL&quot;
:Then //Then is found under &quot;Prgm&quot;->&quot;CTL&quot;
:Goto R //Goto is found under &quot;Prgm&quot;->&quot;CTL&quot;
:End //End is found under &quot;Prgm&quot;->&quot;CTL&quot;
:If L=0 or L=2 or L=4 //= is under &quot;Test&quot;->&quot;Test&quot; (2nd then &quot;Math&quot;)
//or is under &quot;Test&quot;->&quot;Logic&quot;
:Then
:If M=(L+1)
:Then
:Goto R
:End
:End
:If L=1 or L=3 or L=5
:Then
:If M=L-1
:Then
:Goto R
:End
:End
:If M=0
:Then
:Output(Y,X,&quot;F&quot;) //I know y,x goes against convention, sorry
:end
:If M=1
:Then
:Output(Y,X,&quot;B&quot;) 
:end
:If M=2
:Then
:Output(Y,X,&quot;R&quot;) 
:end
:If M=3
:Then
:Output(Y,X,&quot;L&quot;) 
:end
:If M=4
:Then
:Output(Y,X,&quot;U&quot;) 
:end
:If M=5
:Then
:Output(Y,X,&quot;D&quot;) 
:end
:X+1->X
:iPart(rand3)->D
:If D=0
:Then
:X+1->X
:End
:If D=1
:Then
:Output(Y,X,&quot;&#x27;&quot;) // &#x27; is found by going to catalog 
//and hitting up arrow
:X+2->X
:End
:If D=2
:Then
:Output(Y,X,&quot;2&quot;)
:X+2->X
:End
:If X>14 // > is found under &quot;test&quot;->&quot;test&quot;
:Then
:1->X
:Y+1->Y
:End
:If S<a :Then
:Goto T
:End
&lt;/code>

Should just be able to go to &quot;prgm&quot;->&quot;exec&quot;->qb and get a scrambling
alg (and hit enter to get a new one when you&#x27;ve used the present one).

Let me know if you get any errors, I tried to transcribe my code
exactly.  Best of luck!

          <div class="email-content">I had the same discussion at the Berkeley competition. And I disagree.<br>
<br>
I think the reason that chess, tennis and football have point ranking  <br>
systems is that the skill of the competitors is not directly  <br>
measurable. This is because they&#x27;re essentially duels, where you  <br>
fight others rather than try to accomplish something measurable. So  <br>
all objective information that&#x27;s available is who beat who when, and  <br>
it makes sense to try to compute a number out of all that.<br>
<br>
In sports like running, jumping etc the skill of the performer is  <br>
directly measurable, and AFAIK they never have rating systems. And I  <br>
think speed cubing is clearly in this category. It&#x27;s hard to imagine  <br>
that any rating system could be more informative that learning  <br>
somebody&#x27;s best times.<br>
<br>
Titles can still be fun, but I like how we hand those out to people  <br>
who win championships.<br>

Yeah, that was the main reason I wanted to know about the scrambling type, I like to check my scramble...but, well, it doesn&#x27;t mattet that much, as my times are 3 - 4 minutes right now...haha...the cube is sooooooooo stiff...

any  help on the other questions?

 BTW, it seems that the View Scramble command for 5x5x5 doesn&#x27;t work.
 It seems to show rather minimally scrambled cubes (at least the

          <div class="email-content">Hi, and welcome to the world of speedcubing!

don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t understand that (or any of the other) 
guides at first, some of the terminology and abbreviations can take 
a little to get used to, and it can be hard at first to try to 
translate the algorithms from printed page to actual movements on 
the cube at first, but it&#x27;s really not that bad.  just keep at it 
and it gets easier to understand very quickly.

as far as corner/edge pairing, it&#x27;s the step right after forming the 
cross in Fridrich or other layer by layer methods.  Like many 
cubers, I solve white cross on bottom first, then insert 2 pieces at 
a time in each of the 4 slots until all of the first 2 layers (or 
bottom 2 layers the way I do it) are complete.  Almost all of the 
c/e algorithms consist of a setup step to put the corner piece and 
the edge piece in the correct relative &quot;starting&quot; position, then a 
step to unite the c/e pieces so they&#x27;re next to each other and with 
the correct orientation  usually somewhere on the top layer, and 
finally a step to insert the pair into the correct slot on the 
cube.  in most beginner methods, after completing the white (or 
whatever color) cross you might insert the white corner pieces 
first, then go to the second layer edge pieces.  c/e pairing 
combines those two steps into one, so cross + 4 c/e pairs results in 
first 2 layers completed.

best advice i can give on that is find a site with some of the 
algorithms and go through them slowly watching what happens to the 
corner and edge pieces, try to pick apart the algs into those little 
steps of setting it up, combining, and inserting the pair. 

working corner/working edge is a little different.  but the guide 
you have is a good start for moving from a beginner method to a more 
advanced method and the algs you&#x27;ll learn will stay with you 
forever.  Also, I don&#x27;t think mastering the first 2 layers could be 
over-emphasized--you have to do it 4 times in each solve, so getting 
really fast at this step can go a long way to improving your times.  

best of luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris, Gilles and Ron,
                 I fully agree with Chris not because I am one of the victims of existing rules for multiple cubes blindfolded, but it is good for this sport I feel. I do not consider myself as a cuber, although I love this sport/hobby very much. I can tell you the scoring system in memory sports. 
   
  Binary Digits:- There will be 30 digits in a line. If you recall all the 30 digits correctly, you will get 30 points for that line. If there is only 1 mistake, you will get only 15 points for that line. If there is more than 1 mistake or not completed, you will get &quot;zero&quot; points for that line. Since it is a time limit event, the last line is counted even if it is not complete, however the mistake rule applies to it.
   
  Random numbers:- There will be 40 numbers in a line. If you recall all the 40 numbers correctly, you will get 40 points for that line. If there is only 1 mistake, you will get only 20 points for that line. If there is more than 1 mistake or not completed, you will get &quot;zero&quot; points for that line. Since it is a time limit event, the last line is counted even if it is not complete, however the mistake rule applies to it.
   
  Pack Of cards :- All correcet= 52 points. 1 mistake = 26 points. 2 or more mistakes = zero points.
   
  Few more suggestions :- 
  1).Like in memory sports, only one mistake say 1 pair of corners or one pair of edges wrong may be given some weightage. 
2).More than 25% wrong the negative scoring should be more. For example tried 10 cubes but 3 cubes are wrong.
  3).More than 50% wrong the negative scoring should be still more.For example tried 10 cubes but 6 cubes are wrong.
  4).More than 75% wrong the negative scoring should be still more.For example tried 10 cubes but 8 cubes are wrong.
  5).Speed blindfold and multiple cubes blindfold may be made official.
                Just a thought.

          Hey Gilles,

Yes I also agree that someone who attempts and solves one cube 
should not outdo someone who attempts 8 and solves &quot;only&quot; 7 even 
though our current rules have that happen.

Why not a points system, similar to how the memory experts do 
things? I don&#x27;t fully understand their system, but if someone 
attempts to memorize 4000 binary digits and only correctly recalls 
3800 of them, they don&#x27;t consider the attempt a 100% total and 
complete failure, they just adjust the score so that it appears the 
person memorized 3700-3800 or something like that.

This is of course a simplified explanation, since I don&#x27;t fully 
understand how an incorrectly recalled piece of information affects 
their score.

Maybe instead of considering attempting 8 and solving 7 a 100% 
complete and total failure something like this. You get 2 points 
for successfully solving an attempted cube, and -1 points for each 
cube attempted and DNF&#x27;d. So attempting 1 and solving 1 is 2 
poinst. Attempting 8 and solving 7 is 7*(2)-1=13 points. So the 
person who attempted 8 and solved 7 still soundly beats the person 
who attempted and solved one, which is what should happen in my 
opinion.

Just a thought. I would suggest that if this is something of 
interest that we should find a point system that works best for 
cubing, rather than modeling the points system for memory sports 
exactly without any change. But then again I shouldn&#x27;t say much 
since I don&#x27;t understand their system very well.

Like John already explained, they consider a row of digits a unit, 
evaluate each row separately and take the sum. In cubing, naturally 
I&#x27;d think of a cube as a unit.

The crucial point which John didn&#x27;t mention is that they have a fixed 
amout of time. Everybody has for example 30 minutes to memorize as 
much as possible (and then later a fixed amount of time to recall as 
much as possible).

There we differ so far because we&#x27;ve given different time limits for 
different number of cubes. So someone can solve more cubes simply by 
using more time.

I have suggested in the WCA forum to give everybody 60 minutes and 
then you solve as many cubes as you can in that amount of time, 
counting all successes and ignoring the failures. Then that would be 
similar to what the memo guys do.

That sounds good, at least if we don&#x27;t use a fixed time limit. The 
problem of counting successes and ignoring failures is that you can 
let them give you 10 cubes when you really only intend to do five, 
and pick the five easiest ones. That would be discouraged with your 
idea of actually punishing cubes you attempt but don&#x27;t solve.

However... assume you achieve like John did, 7 correct and one with 
just two edges flipped. So you&#x27;re pretty much as close to 8 as you 
possibly can, yet you&#x27;ll lose to someone who got 7 out of 7.

For the fmc competition there is rating as u know Lars. And the 
solutions are directly measurable in a number of metrics. So i see 
no real contradiction between having rating and performances that 
are directly measurable ;-) Whether speedcubing/speedpuzzling rating 
is desirable is another matter and mostly just a personal preference 
thing ...

In the memory sport the skill is also directly measurable, yet they 
have ratings and titles. The reason I think is that while they don&#x27;t 
need that for each category (speed numbers, hour cards, words, etc), 
they use it to get an *overall* rating of everybody, combining the 
stats of all categories in some weighted way. So they can not only 
say who&#x27;s the best speed number memorizer and the best hour cards 
memorizer, but simply &quot;the best memorizer&quot;. Overall. And of course 
not only the best but generally to have an overall ranking of 
everbody. Like some guys have done it here for cubing already, Dan 
Harris recently and someone else computed &quot;top cubers&quot; and &quot;top 
puzzlers&quot; of WC2005.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hi Stefan, Chris, John Louis, Ron...

- The competitor is given T minutes.
- The competitor asks for N scrambled cubes.
- The competitor solves M&lt;N cubes.
- Result=a*M-b*(N-M).
- When results are identical, the best time wins.

Mhhh...  Looks good.

But T is a problem. Some competitors may want more than 60 minutes
(http://speedcubing.com/records/recs_bf_333num.html), if the goal
really is to solve as many cubes as possible.
How many people would be interested in this category?
By the way, I think that &quot;multiple blindfolded&quot; would be ok for a
Guiness-like special record, with simple rules. No time constraint, N
cubes to be solved.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">If I remember correctly, this is the movie that someone posted to 
this group a year or two ago looking for a coach to teach an actor 
how to cube and make it look convincing.  I saw a trailer for the 
film the other day, and it looked like he was cubing ok, but I 
haven&#x27;t seen the Oprah clip.  

I think it was Toby Mao who ended up working with him on the set in 
San Francisco.

happy cubing

It doesn&#x27;t work completely.  It will show &quot;SCRAMBLING ALG&quot; and some of
the letters of the scramble.  It never shows the anticlockwise
versions of the letters.  I even checked to see if I typed it in
right.  There were some things I was unsure about:

You had a &quot;o&quot; in places, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was supposed to put a
Zero, a degree, or an actual lower case &quot;O&quot;, it might just be how it
looks once you post the message.

You had five &quot;&#x27;&quot;s, on the calculator they are spaced, and why five?

You had a &quot;-&quot; sign there somewhere.  Is that a negative or a minus?

And there was a &quot;lbl t&quot; in the code.  Is it supposed to be an upper
case &quot;T&quot;?

          <div class="email-content">One basis for a rating might simply be a transformation of your long
term average maybe?

So your times contribute to not only the competition that you are
participating in, but also to your long term series of times. Then, if
you have a bad tournament, it doesn&#x27;t affect your rating, as long as
it&#x27;s a one off.

Then, once you&#x27;ve solved a threshold number of cubes, your oldest
times drop off the end, to be replaced by your new times. If you
didn&#x27;t solve the threshold number of cubes, your rating would be
provisional.

That could work maybe as the barebones of a system.

Defining the rating someone would need to be called International
Master, Grand Master etc, would be quite subjective though :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,
I wrote my own scrambler very simply, 17 lines I believe. I don&#x27;t
believe this is fully WCA compliant, but it does not include repeats
like U U&#x27;, and it cancels out stuff like U D U2. The only reason I am
not sure is because it will also cancel out stuff like U F U2, which
is legal. This will be fixed in the next version, but it will be a few
lines longer. Here is my code, I will explain its usage at the end.

:Input C
:DelVar ADelVar B&quot;UDFBLR2&#x27;->Str1
:&quot;.->Str2
:For(I,1,C
:Lbl A
:randInt(1,6->A
:If A=B or A=C
:Goto A
:B->C
:A->B
:Str2+sub(Str1,A,1->Str2
:randInt(0,2->A
:If A
:Str2+sub(Str1,A+6,1->Str2
:Str2+&quot; ->Str2
:End

Notes about my code:
- I use -> to represent Sto> (store) found above ON.
- No changes need to be made to this code. Yes, it looks odd, but it
works exactly as presented. 
- This program uses only 6 variables: A, B, C, I, Str1, and Str2
- When entering this code, you do not have to enter the : before each
line.

Usage of this program: 
After entering this program and running it, you will be prompted with
a question mark. Enter the length of the scramble you want. The
program will run, (note: it will take longer depending on the length
of the scramble). When the program displays Done, press VARS, 7 (or
scroll down to String), 2 (or Str2), then press Enter twice. The
scramble will be displayed. You can scroll left and right with the
arrow keys. 

I&#x27;ll be working on a full &quot;jnetcube suite&quot; for the calc this week. 

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">I got the first program to work.  I was stupid and thought (&quot;&#x27;&quot;) was
actually five (&#x27;)s.  Very nice.

This new one peter posted I couldn&#x27;t get to do anything until I put a
&quot;.&quot; after the (&quot;) in the next to last line.  I remembered typing that
in the beginning.

But when I press Enter twice it shows the same thing every time. 
UDFBLR2&#x27;2.

Programming seems like a lot of fun.  I took a couple classes last
year but couldn&#x27;t get into it because the teacher....

Some of you might be familiar with him (Rick Leinecker).

          <div class="email-content">I guess there were a few other things I should have noted:
- On the second to last line, there is a quote &quot;, then a space, then
the store symbol.
- To display the scramble, press VARS 7 2 Enter 
  Make sure Str2 is displayed on the screen, or else you will get the
line UDFBLR2&#x27; 
- The . before the scramble is there for simplicity of coding. Ignore
it. (not in the code, but in the outputed scramble)

If you still can&#x27;t get the program to work correctly, let me know and
I&#x27;ll be glad to help.

  One basis for a rating might simply be a transformation of your long
  term average maybe?

  So your times contribute to not only the competition that you are
  participating in, but also to your long term series of times. Then, if
  you have a bad tournament, it doesn&#x27;t affect your rating, as long as
  it&#x27;s a one off.

  Then, once you&#x27;ve solved a threshold number of cubes, your oldest
  times drop off the end, to be replaced by your new times. If you
  didn&#x27;t solve the threshold number of cubes, your rating would be
  provisional.

  That could work maybe as the barebones of a system.

  Defining the rating someone would need to be called International
  Master, Grand Master etc, would be quite subjective though :)

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I got it to work.

I think I prefer the other way of seeing the scramble.  Having to
scroll isn&#x27;t too much fun.  I also like the idea of just pressing
enter again to get a different scramble.

But, it is great that you managed to get a scrambler with so little
lines :)

End

I made a few changes in this code version. Number 1 is the way the
code is displayed. It is now displayed on screen, 5 turns per line, 5
lines. The code will always show 25 moves. It still prevents doubles
and turns such as U D U2. You can also now press enter each time the
program finishes for a new scramble. 

If you have any more suggestions, let me know!

          <div class="email-content">I know you got it working, but I&#x27;ll clarify it for others, just in case.

1. Any time you see &quot;=0&quot; it&#x27;s a zero, any time you see a &quot;->O&quot; it&#x27;s an
upper case letter oh.

2.The &quot;&#x27;&quot; is &lt;quote>&lt;apostrophe>&lt;quote>

3. I believe all &quot;-&quot;&#x27;s are minus signs, not negative signs.

4. You are correct, &quot;Lbl t&quot; should probably &quot;Lbl T&quot; though I&#x27;m not
sure how finicky the 83 is about case sensitivity.

Hope that helps, and glad you found the program useful.

1 2x2x2 (kindof broken) rubik&#x27;s brand cube, very stiff<br>
2 pyraminx puzzles, very fun<br>
1 Alexanders Star, freaking hard, pretty stiff too<br>
<br>
and for the 3x3x3 cubes:<br>
I have 5 for sale (might be able to find some more laying around)<br>
conditions:<br>
2 are of decent quality, but hardly speed cubes<br>
2 are excellent speedcubes that i have reached very fast times on<br>
1 is really old and not name brand and pretty darn stiff<br>
The stickers on these 5 are mildly worn, on some of them i removed the<br>
a side so it is just black.<br>
<br>
If you do the math on this it is probably around 200 dollars worth of<br>
cubes but we&#x27;ll see where we get, if anywhere at all!<br>
<br>
By the way, i live in San Clemente and dont know if anyone is local,<br>
otherwise ill ship them and charge the actual cost of shipping.<br>
<br>
So, anyone care to start the bidding?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I was at the Berkeley competition and we were trying to figure out who <br>
had the better cubes: Northern California, or Southern California.  And <br>
well, we might as well settle this once and for all?  I&#x27;m not sure <br>
about a format, but I&#x27;m sure we can figure something out.<br>
<br>
So, eligibility.  Pretty much any California is eligible for this.  If <br>
you aren&#x27;t a California, but you happen to be in California, we <br>
probably won&#x27;t complain too much.  I&#x27;m basically giving Southern <br>
California Leyan and Macky.  (I still think it&#x27;ll be close...)<br>
<br>
In terms of picking teams, Chris Dzoan, a Fremont native in Irvine can <br>
elect to represent Northern California (by the way, this would be an <br>
online competition) and Darren Kwong, an Alhambra native, can elect to <br>
represent Southern California.<br>
<br>
Not sure what the events will be right now, but probably 3x3x3 speed <br>
solve, one-handed speed solve, and blindfold solve.  In terms of <br>
format, here&#x27;s one proposition.  Each event, you elect a certain number <br>
of people, perhaps 3 or 5.  They get ranked (probably according to <br>
competition results) and then number 1 from the north faces off against <br>
the number 1 from the south.  Limitation... perhaps each person is only <br>
allowed to compete in 1 event, or maybe 2...<br>
<br>
Anyway, just throwing the idea out to see who&#x27;s interested.  By the <br>
way, if the rest of the world wants to challenge California, here&#x27;s the <br>
lineup I&#x27;m submitting if each event is three people deep:<br>
<br>
3x3x3 Speed Solve<br>
1. Shotaro Makisumi<br>
2. Darren Kwong<br>
3. Toby Mao<br>
<br>
3x3x3 One-Handed Speed Solve<br>
1. Ryan Patricio<br>
2. Dan Dzoan<br>
3. Chris Dzoan<br>
<br>
3x3x3 Blindfold Solve<br>
1. Leyan Lo<br>
2. Tyson Mao<br>
3. Chris Kreuger<br>

what do you want? I mean, what&#x27;s your problem with us? Why do you keep 
flooding here with your stuff noone cares about (if even understands). 
Your videos are lame, I don&#x27;t even get the point (is there a point a 
all?). Everyone knows you&#x27;re a cheater with your behind-your-back 
&quot;trick&quot; (and if you aren&#x27;t, please prove so, come to the next 
competition, and I&#x27;ll pay your plane ticket if you can solve the cube 
blindfolded in twice the time you claim you can do). If you want us to 
admit you&#x27;re the best and first and whatever, then fine: woah, Gaï¿½tan 
you&#x27;re THE MAN, now quit bothering us. I don&#x27;t even want to hear a 
single word from you again, go write your book about yourself et ferme 
ta putain de gueule.
BTW, do you have the rights to modify this movie? my god, how can even 
do such a bad thing out of such great movies?
Sorry guys, but I was pissed off, had to do something about it.

  Selling my cube collection. So i think I&#x27;ll do it auction form... <br>

          <div class="email-content">Sounds like an interesting idea, except maybe if we did some events that aren&#x27;t run by the 
California area...say big cubes, magic, megaminx, basically other puzzles...not just the 
standard cube, because California tends to specialize in the 3x3, and the rest of the world 
in other puzzles, at least that&#x27;s the view it seems like to me...You guys could do East coast 
US vs. West Coast US, or just East and West of North America, or Americas vs. Everyone 
else...Americas vs. Everyone else would settle the dispute that was going on after US 
Nationals, and before Euros...I dunno, just throwing ideas around.

I&#x27;ve been trying to think of other ways to add to this program. I&#x27;d
like to get higher order cubes supported, but displaying a full 3x3x3
scramble takes up nearly the whole screen. I was thinking about making
the whole alg scroll up Star Wars-style after a set delay period or
after a button press. Think this would work?

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
The Speedcuber Profiles section is back on www.cubestation.co.uk!<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s been completely renovated, and is much more automatic now, the<br>
best feature at the moment is that when you add/edit a profile now it<br>
immediately appears online!<br>
<br>
For people who never saw the profiles section on the old website, it<br>
is a place where speedcubers add a bit of information about<br>
themselves, so other people around the world can see who they are,<br>
keep track of contact details, best times etc.<br>
<br>
I hope you can all find 5 minutes in the day to add a bit about<br>
yourselves, and hopefully the section will grow into a very cool<br>
database of speedcubing information.<br>
<br>
I have decided to start from scratch, because all of the old profiles<br>
were of course way out of date :)<br>
<br>
You can find the speedcuber profiles section here<br>
http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/index.php?page=profiles/profilelogin<br>
<br>
Of course, if you find any bugs (I&#x27;ve tested pretty thoroughly) then<br>
please let me know via my contacts page so I can get it fixed!<br>
<br>
All the best,<br>
<br>
Dan Harris :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">This is the second post in the last little while depicting the new<br>
timers as less than ideal for official events.  Mike just said there<br>
is no output for the tournament display and James Stuber said he can<br>
start it or stop it by touching only the right sensor.   Both<br>
purchased the items from Target in the complete kit, which I<br>
understand is the only way to purchase a timer now.  <br>
<br>
Surely you must be able to purchase a timer with the output present,<br>
or the Tournament Display would be rendered obsolete. I am guessing<br>
these would be available on the speedstack website.  But will the<br>
starting and stopping condition be different, too? Does anyone have<br>
any insight not this situation?  If one needed to purchase several<br>
timers and displays, how do we ensure we are getting the quality<br>
required for a competition?<br>

as a speedcuber for more than a year ago. After I did that I saw you 
did not add profiles anymore until you had updated the site. And now

I did 3 french champs 1 world and 1 euro and I&#x27;ve never have a lucky

I must have had an OLL skip in the past, I&#x27;m pretty sure of that.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bernett,

You know, I would guess that even if you have done a lot of
competitions, you would not be &quot;unlucky&quot; to not have been &quot;lucky&quot;, if
you see what I mean :)

I have taken part in 9 competitions, and I have had one PLL skip, in
the Dutch Open 2003 :) But that is all!

Let&#x27;s restrict this only to 3x3 and only to luck in LL. Probability 
of no luck for one attempt is 1-(215/216*71/72) = 0.9815.

Probability for luck in Bernett&#x27;s 15 attempts:
1 - 0.9815^15 = 24.38%

Probability for no luck in Ron&#x27;s (btw exactly) 200 attempts:
0.9815^200 = 2.41%

Cheers!
Stefan

So here&#x27;s a list of the top-10 for number of official 3x3 solves:

204	204	16	Leyan Lo
199	200	18	Ron van Bruchem
163	163	13	Shotaro Makisumi
161	161	14	Lars Vandenbergh
147	150	19	Ton Dennenbroek
130	130	10	Ryan Patricio
125	126	14	Lars Petrus
114	114	9	Tyson Mao
113	113	11	Joël van Noort
104	104	9	Frank Morris
104	105	12	Stefan Pochmann

The list also shows number of attempts (i.e. solves+DNFs) and number 
of competitions. And here the same but for all events, not just 3x3:

505	527	18	Ron van Bruchem
475	501	14	Lars Vandenbergh
404	419	17	Leyan Lo
343	368	10	Gunnar Krig
336	361	12	Stefan Pochmann
297	306	11	Kåre Krig
297	316	9	Gilles van den Peereboom
293	307	10	Frank Morris
279	298	13	Shotaro Makisumi
268	280	11	Joël van Noort

arxon and ideal, i also adjusted the screw tension (on the<br>
anniversary, i cant because you cant see the screws when you open the<br>
caps).<br>
<br>
but the cubes still kind of suck.. i think the tension of the springs<br>
is okay after adjusting the screws, but they still dont move smoothly.<br>
<br>
for how long would you say do i have to play with a cube for it to go<br>
smooth? i had another (very cheap and crappy) cube, i luped it and it<br>
went totally smooth after a few minutes (but it hat no springs, so it<br>
sucked for speedcubing).<br>
<br>
anybody can give me any hints for what to do or what i might have done<br>
wrong? general tips or especially for arxon/ideal/25th, whatever,<br>
anything would be appreciated!<br>
<br>
thanks in advance!<br>
<br>
ps: if you recommend other cubes for speedcubing (like the diy i real<br>
a lot about), can anybody tell me where to get those in europe<br>
(especially germany)? i want to avoid high shipping costs from rubiks.com<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m not into blindfolded at all (I never practice it) but when there&#x27;s a 
competition I almost always give it a try. I&#x27;ve only been succesfull once out of 10 attempts 
or so. And I also never miss out on the Clock, but before 2006 I never practiced it as well 
causing many DNFs.

It&#x27;s not the sort of record you&#x27;re supposed to be proud of but I like to think it&#x27;s because I 
at least try competing in events I&#x27;m not very good at rather than opt out to avoid making a 
fool of myself :p.

Oh yes, the clock... you got 10 DNFs each for 3x3bld and clock, 3 for 
magic and one for each of 5x5, minx and master magic.

And I agree, participating in events you&#x27;re not good at is still fun. 
Now I wish I hadn&#x27;t skipped so many events at Euro2006. Like you 
wrote on your site recently, the competition aspect is so much fun 
and I missed it...

Btw, I certainly didn&#x27;t mean to make fun of anyone with that DNF 
list, wouldn&#x27;t have posted it if I weren&#x27;t way up there myself. My 
own DNFs: 10 magic, 8 3x3bld, 2 5x5bld, 2 square-1, once each for 
3x3, master magic and speedblind.

General remark: for the unsuccessful attempts there might be some 
mistakes left in the database, particularly DNF instead of DNS. For 
example I didn&#x27;t actually DNF twice at WC2005 in 5x5bld. Only once 
because I was so slow I had to stop my first attempt to continue 
other events. Also I can of course always do mistakes with the stats, 
so don&#x27;t take them too seriously. 

Cheers!
Stefan

Stefan, how many of my DNF&#x27;s are because of 3x3x3 bld?

8 3x3bld, 7 magic, 2 5x5, 2 clock, 1 2x2, 1 3x3.

Btw, the safest magicers are Lacey Burton and Jeff Soesbe, they each 
had 15 attempts without any DNF. Safest 3x3BLDer is Matyas Kuti with 
8 out of 8!

And the top 3x3bld DNFers: Macky(18), Tyson(18), Warren(18), 
Leyan(15). Take that, California!

> And when do we get to use the database ourselves?! :D

Well, you probably won&#x27;t ever get your hands on it directly. The 
database will be used to display official results in different views. 
Though I also have a &#x27;miscellaneous&#x27; section in mind where we could 
show additional fun statistics like a few of those Ron and I showed 
here. But now I&#x27;m just working on the regular views. Should be ready 
soon, don&#x27;t know when exactly but I&#x27;m sure this year.

Cheers!
Stefan

Something to make you feel better: your 12/12 make you #3 in the 
&#x27;safest clockers&#x27; list after me(36) and Ron(16) :-)

Ok, enough... or Ron will behead me for doing this stuff instead of 
working on the serious system. I do like these &#x27;safest XYZer&#x27; stats, 
though. Bob leads the master magic one, btw, with 42/42.

Cheers!
Stefan

Though this will be Ron&#x27;s decision as it is his account. It might be 
possible to restrict queries to read-only but even then it still 
costs runtime/transfer/queries and these are limited so I don&#x27;t think 
Ron will want to make that possible publicly.

My 13.02 at Rutgers this month was a PLL skip.  And I don&#x27;t think I
have that many official solves, surely less than 50.

Haha, yes, I suspected that I should be reasonably high up on the
&#x27;safest&#x27; clock solvers. There often seems to be a lot of clock DNFs in
competition, but fortunately I haven&#x27;t done this yet!

Until last weekend I think I also had a 100% solve rate for the Magic.
At the UK Open I got my first DNF. At the end of the solve, two tiles
were elevated *just* over the allowable amount. :( Oh well.

Other statistics I&#x27;d be interested to see are about girls in cubing. I
was wondering if there are more girls cubing now than before. I haven&#x27;t
really seen an increase from the competitions I&#x27;ve been to, but I only
make it to about 2 competitions a year and I know there are so many
other competitions happening all over the world.

You mean attempts, not solves. Btw, Matyas Kuti averages 61 
attempts, though that is powered by only two competitions with 
70 attempts in one of them. That&#x27;s place 2 for number of attempts in 
a single competition, place 1 is Chris Hardwick with 76 attempts at 
US Nationals 2006: two DNFs at 3x3bld and 74 solves including 4 at 
4x4bld/5x5bld. Place 2 for number of solves in one competition is 
Craig Bouchard with 66, also US Nationals 2006.

The top four not exceeding 10 minutes:

10:00.00 Doug Li 3x3 blindfolded Dallas 2005
10:00.00 Mark Gaines 3x3 with feet Swedish Open 2005
 9:59.66 Brent Morgen 3x3 blindfolded US 2004

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

Dan:
I don&#x27;t believe Harris has ever competed, thus I did miss him as he 
was not on the rankings.  If the database were used for this, Harris 
would not be found as Harris Chan wouldn&#x27;t be in the database.

Ron:
In the rankings, they&#x27;re listed as, for instance, Kim Kyung-Ho, so I 
just took Kim as the first name without a thought.

Stefan:
Whoops, I knew I&#x27;d miss one.

He only competed in magic, I guess that&#x27;s why. You also missed Max 
Chang who only did onehanded. And there are also 11 Chris&#x27;s and 
Richards. But just one Ron. Kinda strange. Ron is unique :-)

But not bad for not having the database.

Ah, that&#x27;s why.  I only used the 3x3 rankings.

I only count 10 Chris and 9 Richard (Chui, Dorrance, Mu, Patterson, 
Scibetti, Truong, Verrycken, Wang, Nagy) (on 3x3 rankings)...

> But just one Ron. Kinda strange. Ron is unique :-)

Unless you count Ronald Hoekstra.

Why thank you.

Question that maybe can be answered by the database (sorry, I&#x27;m not 
going to try to do this by hand): Are Max Chang and the Daniel 
Birchfield the only non 3x3 competitors?  I would assume no since 
you counted 1 more Chris and 2 more Richards than I did.

          <div class="email-content">I looked on the SpeedStacks web site, and timers seem to be only
available by getting a &quot;pack.&quot; There are StackPacks, the packs that
are available in stores, and they claim the timers supplied in those
packs can not be used with tournament displays. The other pack
available is a &quot;Sport Pack.&quot; They come with a timer compatible with
tournament displays, but have a starting price of a whopping 260 US
dollars. They are not available via web; only phone, fax, or mail. It
seems rather outrageous to me that this is the only way to get a
tournament display-compatible timer.

Wishful thinking: Maybe they could come out with a new timer designed
to be connected to a computer. It seems to me this ought to be a
requirement for the next version - it would be very nice both for home
use and tournament use.

What basis did you use for this? It can&#x27;t be the 3x3 Average (or at
least not the current version on speedcubing.com) as 16 is Toby Mao,
and I had thought he used Fridrich.  So which ranking did you take
these from, and how did you deduce the method used by the competitor?

          <div class="email-content">Im sure this question has been asked like billions of times, but hey<br>
why not another time. <br>
<br>
I just got back into speedcubing maybe 2 months ago? My times are<br>
averaging right around 30seconds. I use f2l with a 3look ll, except<br>
for when theres only a dot on the LL then I learned lik all the 8OLL<br>
algos for it. <br>
<br>
Anyways, my question is, are there any tips for practicing F2L? I mean<br>
otehr than looking ahead. and more importantly, how exactly do you<br>
guys get better at looking ahead? Right now I jus keep on practicing<br>
and practicing, but Ive kinda hit a barrier at right around high 20s. <br>
<br>
Also, is it about time for me to learn OLL? Honestly, I really dont<br>
want to learn 57 new algorithms &gt;_&lt;. And I feel that the recognition<br>
time will increase alot more from my 3look LL. I guess what Im trying<br>
to ask is would it be better for me to work more on my cross+F2L, or<br>
to work on learning OLL.<br>

Thanks ahead of time,<br>

          <div class="email-content">I used the Unofficial 3x3x3 averages, not Official.  I got the methods
because I knew what people used which method for the most part (most
people do I think).

Official 3x3 average 2006:

1-12 - Fridrich
13 - Petrus
14-20 - Fridrich
21 - LBL supposedly
22 - Fridrich
23 - Roux
24-43 - Fridrich
44 - ZZ method (not sure if he used it for this competition)
45-78 - Fridrich
79 - Petrus
80-95 - Fridrich
96 - His own method (not sure if it was used in that competition)
97-100 - Fridrich

Some of the Fridrich users I&#x27;m unsure about.

hard mainly because you can&#x27;t tell at a glance what you&#x27;ve done
already and what you have left to do, since all the stickers are the
same color.

You can find all sorts of sudoku cubes these days in the shops,
catalogues, etc etc.

We had the idea of a 4x4x4 sudoku cube, where all the faces would have
1 to 16, and also each of the stickers around a horizontal or vertical
layer would be 1 to 16. 

I&#x27;ve no idea how to come up with a possible design for the puzzle,
does anyone have a program that could generate the design for this
puzzle, and also how many possible puzzles are there?

That is turely amazing, they have the designs for each of the cubes
already complete. I am in total shock. I suppose someone with more
know-how than me could make these.

I can&#x27;t wait for Olympic cubes to start mass producing their cubes
(are they ever going to?)

the port.

the port?

          <div class="email-content">Well, the patenting process takes a long time and costs quite a bit of money
(especially for a worldwide protection as you can see the multiple
applications in different patent offices at the right of the page).
If they do that, it is surely for a good reason.

What do you think about the US Patent delaying the distribution of these
cubes ?
Does this look logical to you or do you find any other good reason ?

          <div class="email-content">Pedro, you don&#x27;t need a guide, it&#x27;s easy to assemble a Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4 
without one.

Start by putting in the four bottom layer centres and then bulid that 
layer compleatly. After that you put in the middle layers, centres 
first, then edges. Finnaly you do the top layer, centres first again 
and then finnish it of the same way as the 3x3x3 by turning the layer 
45 degrees and then putting in the last edge. Do the reverse to 
diassemble.

I won&#x27;t appear to the public until 18 months after it has been filed<br>

different things.  It can takes years for a patent to go through after<br>
it gets to the USPTO.  So until then they claim &quot;Patent Pending&quot;.<br>

I wrote it a while back it&#x27;s got a reasonably accurate timer and

basic method.  IMO, don&#x27;t teach them &quot;algorithms&quot; or even how to read
them.  Only tell them HOW to do things.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s odd, I just downloaded it from the files section and it ran
fine on mine.  A few things to try:

It shouldn&#x27;t make a difference, but I run AMS 2.05 on a hardware 1
calculator (the Titanium is HW2 I&#x27;m pretty sure), to check your AMS
version hit home->f1->Shift->= , it should tell you.

Also, try opening the file manager (2nd->subtraction symbol) and
unlocking the program (highlight it then hit f1->7)  Then when you run
it, it should give you the error and the option of Exit, or goto. 
Choose goto and let me know which line in the program it sends you to.
 Just reproducing it here should be enough.

You might also try clearing your variables (either from the file
manager or the clean up function on the home screen).  Just make sure
you don&#x27;t have anything important saved under a variable first!

Let me know what that 2nd step gives you and which ams version you&#x27;re
running.

 without one.
 
 Start by putting in the four bottom layer centres and then bulid that 
 layer compleatly. After that you put in the middle layers, centres 
 first, then edges. Finnaly you do the top layer, centres first again 
 and then finnish it of the same way as the 3x3x3 by turning the layer 
 45 degrees and then putting in the last edge. Do the reverse to 
 diassemble.

          <div class="email-content">Hrmm... the only thing I can think is to maybe delete the program and
reload it.  I also have a different version you may want to try if
that doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m still trying to recreate the problem on my end.

Also, when the program is working you&#x27;ll likely need to tweak the line
  that reads:

1.42+tenth->tenth

in order to get the timer right.  I would imagine the titanium is
faster and thus would require a lower increment.

I&#x27;ll keep trying, good luck!

  Hrmm... the only thing I can think is to maybe delete the program and<br>
  reload it. I also have a different version you may want to try if<br>
  that doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m still trying to recreate the problem on my end.<br>
<br>
  Also, when the program is working you&#x27;ll likely need to tweak the line<br>
  that reads:<br>
<br>
  1.42+tenth-&gt;tenth<br>
<br>
  in order to get the timer right. I would imagine the titanium is<br>
  faster and thus would require a lower increment.<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ll keep trying, good luck!<br>

put lots of them into a big pot.
Then most customers will play a bit with it so that all of them are
scrambled.
But this is good news for us because it means that we can actually try them
before purchasing it (and they are usually good since lots of people have
used it before you).

(There is one shop like this very close to the venue of the next Belgian
Open. ;-))

I think this is the best way to purchase good Rubik&#x27;s Cubes.

Well, I sincerely hope he&#x27;d have experienced this scenario at least a
dozen times to call for a boycott on Rubik&#x27;s brand products.  After
all, this is the product that has made our sport possible in the first
place.  I, myself, have never had a bad cube, but I don&#x27;t buy store
bought cubes for speedcubing because of the risk factor, and the time
required to get it into competition condition.  I only use DIY kits,
and I always have a stock on hand for those occasions when the Rubik&#x27;s
shop is out of stock.  It just seems logical if you are serious about
cubing.  The cost of equipment for this sport is very minimal. Think
of other sports or activities that would cost much more to participate
(football, hockey, etc).   

Furthermore, you must be resourceful in this sport.  Save every piece
that is not broken.  If you encounter the situation where you cannot
get the cube apart as it is so tight, the problem lies with the
kernel. If you have an old cube that is too loose or something is
wrong with it, swap out your old kernel and put it with new pieces. I
have done this several times and the result is always very positive. 
In my eyes, if you buy a cube from the store, you are buying pieces to
build a speedcube, you are not buying a sub-12 cube out of the box. 

I will continue to purchase Rubik&#x27;s products myself, but I am sorry to
hear about the bad experience.

You can, of course, use your standard 3x3x3 method and then just do 
the corners. Something like: do first layer, permute second layer 
corners, orient second layer corners. I used to do this and it worked 
just fine.

I&#x27;ve now switched to using the first part of the &quot;corners first&quot; 
method called Ortega-Jelinik. I really like this method for a 2x2x2, 
it&#x27;s very quick with very little memorization (I memorized most 
routines in a day).

Here&#x27;s a link to the method:

http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html

Ortega-Jelinik goes:
- do one side (don&#x27;t worry about permutation)
- orient opposite side
- permute everything

If I had a decent 2x2x2 (mine&#x27;s way too loose), I think I could 
probably regularly hit sub-10 seconds with this method and a little 
more practice (US Nationals I averaged 12.86). Your mileage may vary.

Is it the closest amount of time someone came to making it into the finals or next round 
(by average)?  Martin Zahradnik was off by 0.1 in the czech open...
Jo Myeong-Gyu

Ok, maybe not, It works for Andrew Chow and Martin Zahradnik, but not Jo Myeong-Gyu

I dunno...thats hard...I&#x27;ll continue to look...

such.  I have new news!  SCCC has our very own website now!  Check it<br>
out at http://www.sccubeclub.com/.  Our website includes solutions for<br>

a page on the Fridrich method.  A lot of our pages are still under<br>
construction right now but i will let you know when everything is<br>
ready to go.  Until then check out what we currently have and let us<br>

French cubers are planning a new open championship in 2007.

Date: 3-4 February 2007
Location: Hôtel Campanile, Roissy (near Paris CDG airport)

The organization needs to know approximately the number of people who
will attend the event.
It&#x27;s important to negociate good prices for the room! If we manage to
find 100 competitors, prices will drop :-)

If you are interested, please answer immediately by sending a mail to
the organizer, Aurélien Souchet. Address: mistervanne&lt;AT>msn&lt;DOT>com
or send it to me.

&quot;- I will attend.&quot;
&quot;- I will probably attend.&quot;
&quot;- I may attend if ....&quot;
&quot;- I will stay at the hotel on Friday night (2-bed room, 65 euros or
hopefully a bit less).&quot;
&quot;- I will stay at the hotel on Saturday night.&quot;

Tell your friends and answer now. Thank you!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Matt, everyone,

That&#x27;s exactly the sort of question that should be in a Cube FAQ
somewhere. And now we have one!

I&#x27;ve written a new FAQ section on my website, where you can browse
Questions and Answers to various frequently asked questions. Just go
to http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/index.php?page=faq/faq to access it.

If you can&#x27;t find an answer to your question, then there is the option
to submit your own question, where it will open to response by anyone
who knows the answer! You can answer these unanswered questions, or
you can provide alternative replies to questions that have already
been answered.

As you can see this section will grow and grow, and eventually become
a great knowledge base for any frequently asked questions to do with
cubing.

If you have a CubeStation Account, there is now an option to volunteer
yourself as an FAQ Expert. If you set this option to Yes, you will
receive notifications via email when new questions have been asked,
and a link to a page where you can post an answer. The default for
this option is set to No.

Please feel free to use and enjoy the FAQ&#x27;s, and contribute where you
can. I would appreciate any + or - feedback too :)

DanH :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
I was wondering whether anyone can teach me how to make a 4x4x4 <br>
speedcube other than just lubing it. I&#x27;ve recently purchased a Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Revenge from Rubiks.com along with the cube lube. I&#x27;ve already lubed up <br>
the cube but it just seems quite impossible for this cube to move as <br>
fast as my 3x3x3 speedcube. And today, I guess was cubing faster than <br>
the cube can handle and one of the center pieces broke.<br>
<br>
Did I buy the wrong type of cube? How should I change the cube so that <br>
it can be a speedcube?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Does anyone know Andy Tsao&#x27;s breakdown for that type of solve?  His 
memorization time at Berkeley was generally around 60 seconds for the 
3x3x3 BLD.  His average OH solve is 47 seconds.  Of course, the BLD 
method takes longer than Fridrich or a speed solve method.  Though, 
with OH solving for BLD, you won&#x27;t really have any delays between any 
of the steps or any of the cycles since you can use that extra time it 
takes to do algorithms to think about your next thing.

          <div class="email-content">Three tips:

1) Play with it a lot. They get better after a while (approx 1 month)
2) Don&#x27;t lube it directly, wait a month.
3) Buy Studio, not Rubiks. They are just a little better

<br>
What I have done for making a nice 4x4 is to use the lube syringes that <br>
rubiks.com has. I used this stuff at first for my 3x3,4x4 and 5x5 <br>
before I knew about silicon spray.After geting good use of the 4x4 with <br>
that lube then appllied the silicon. All 3 cubes (3x3,4x4,5x5) are now <br>
my competition cubes and are very nice.<br>

&quot;UR ALL RETARDED!!! The rubeiks cube is nothing more than a puzzle, a
group of colors all paired together to form one cube. The colors r
then scrambled in order to form a PUZZLE!!!! It&#x27;s no phenomenon that
this boy can solve this puzzle. Y? B/c he&#x27;s chinese. that&#x27;s pretty
much it. He&#x27;s studied patterns, probably even completed a few himself.
Yet, u all seem to think he&#x27;s been blinded, literally, n is using some
way to cheat. No, he isn&#x27;t. The blindfold was placed there before so
he can&#x27;t see the cube n examine it before the buzzer goes off. So he
can&#x27;t tell the pattern at which the puzzle was set. N, ironically,
half of u can&#x27;t spell gulible. GULIBLE!!!&quot;

After the first answers we got, it has been decided that it&#x27;s going to
be a 1-day competition (on the 3rd or 4th).

List of events:

- 3x3x3 (at least 2 rounds - average of 5)
- 4x4x4
- 5x5x5
- 2x2x2

If there&#x27;s another event you&#x27;d like to compete in, it may be added
later. Ask the organisor.

Further details and online registration will come soon.

Thanks for the help!

Here&#x27;s my situation. I do have the lube syringes from rubiks.com and 
have applied them to my 4x4 cube. The result is that all the outer 
layers are turning very smoothly but not the inner two layers. It 
takes me much more force to turn the inner layer than the outer 
layer. This causes an uneven turn when I try to do a double layer 
turn, leading to the cube getting &quot;stuck&quot;.

Just thought of an idea. Is it wise to sand down the 4x4 core piece 
so that the center pieces would turn better?

          <div class="email-content">Ton Dennenbroek used to sell prepared Studio-cubes around 2002/2003.
One reason he stopped was he actually had wrist/hand injuries from the
stiff cubes he had to break in. 

Keep in mind though that breaking in a cube yourself also means that
it&#x27;ll adjust itself to your own cubing style. This is another reason
why cubes from other speedcubers feel different from your own cubes.

          <div class="email-content">I Completely agree on this one. To bad most &quot;Rubiks&quot;-machines work exactly
the wrong way
1) You have to scramble it and they solve it
2) You have to break in the cube before they can start solving it.

I would like a robot that I
1) Give a new (stiff) cube to break it in automatically
2) Give a solved cube and get a nicely scrambled one for me to solve

          <div class="email-content">Hello all,<br>
<br>
I just got my DIY kit in the mail yesterday and I put it together. I<br>
was wondering if anyone could offer some advice on how to set it up<br>
properly. Basically what I did was I tightened the screws until the<br>
pieces stopped popping out. currently this cubes performance is no<br>
better than the rubik&#x27;s cube I bought from target (it is fairly old<br>
and worn in though). Another thing I was wondering was if anyone had a<br>
clever idea to attach the center caps in a manner that makes them easy<br>
to remove if necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
best regards,<br>

          <div class="email-content">     I don&#x27;t know about the sandpaper, but most kinds of Silicone
Spray will make your cube sticky at first.  I don&#x27;t know about that
brand in particular, but what I would recommend is to disassemble the
cube, spray the parts, wait a few hours for it to dry.  Then flip over
the pieces, spray, and dry again.  After a few hours, assemble the
cube, play with it for a while, then disassemble and let it dry for
several hours, or overnight.  This seems to work the best for me, and
for several other speedcubers I know.

I was very weary of using sandpaper to sand down the pieces in an
attempt to speed up the wear-and-tear process, basically because there
is no undo method.  However, I did just that last month, and the
result was surprisingly good.  In fact, the cube went from being a
speedcube I was willing to sacrifice to the cube I used in at the
Rutgers Fall last month (including the one-handed event).  Here is the
website I used as my instruction manual. 

http://www.freespaces.com/jasa86/cube/smooth_cube.htm

And as for the lube situation, it is usually sticky until it dries
completely and is worked into the cube. If it is still sticky a few
days after application and use, something is awry.

          <div class="email-content">Hi cubers,<br>
        You all know, I am in top-3 and in the finals for the award. <br>
  1). I am there in the finals for my skill to solve a 3*3*3 cube blindfolded and fast.<br>
  2). Akrit is a 13 year old boy who is doing his medicine 2nd year in university.<br>
  3). Akash is a 14 year old boy who has designed a spaceship model.<br>
        After many rounds of testing, we 3 were selected by judges for finals out of thousands of applicants. We 3 performed on POGO TV and exhibited our skill and also explained our concepts on 29th nov and viewers were asked to vote for their favorite kid.<br>
        Now, we are waiting for the result which will be announced on 10th dec in Bombay which is 2000 km away from my home town. If I win or loose, that is immaterial. Being part of it is fun. The final prize distribution ceremony will be telecast on 17th dec.<br>
        When I think back - where all this cubing has taken me, how many new friends it has given me, what a respect and recognition I get where ever I go and above all the pleasure I get by simply cubing etc - it is a sweet memory, since Ron uncle met me a year back in my place on 17th dec - 2005, exactly a year back.<br>
        Thanks to Ron uncle, Stefan Uncle and whole cubing community for inspiring me.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Andy,

Your solves must have been really really weird... consider the 
following:

3:33.78 - BLD on Cube Simulator
2:13.65 - BLD with One Hand

Your average on the Cube Simulator is 12.57 seconds.  Your best OH 
average in competition is 47.03 seconds.  What in the world happened 
that your OH BLD solve can be *that* must faster than your Cube 
Simulator BLD solve?

Is it because of how the program is written?  Surely you must be quite 
used to making cube rotations to turn the back face and things like 
that.

Dan Dzoan can solve a cube blindfolded right?  I&#x27;m very curious what 
Dan Dzoan&#x27;s OH-BLD execution time is.  Surely his BLD memorization is 
much slower than yours, but we can measure his execution time.  He 
averages about 24 seconds for OH, so we would expect his execution to 
be around twice your speed.

            I made a rubiks cube site.  Comments, suggestions, and criticism are

all very welcome.  And I do appologize for the lack of new/useful

information.  In time the site will fill more.  Thanks, Chip.

          <div class="email-content">Hi folks --<br>
<br>
Had some questions about the Jan 13 competition in San Francisco at <br>
the Exploratorium, and thought I&#x27;d ask them here (rather than <br>
caltechrubik&#x27;s group) since multiple folks might be interested in <br>
the answers.<br>
<br>
- It is a one day competition, right? The Exploratorium website <br>
(http://www.exploratorium.edu/rubiks/) says &quot;each day&quot; but I&#x27;m <br>
guessing that&#x27;s a typo. It does say &quot;Saturday, January 13&quot; at the <br>
top.<br>
<br>
- Will 3x3x3 first round be best of three or average of five?<br>
<br>
- Last year, we had lots of 3x3x3 competitors (which was great) so <br>
we ran out of time for other stuff (bummer), leading to an insertion <br>
of a time limit for 4x and only Frank doing 5x. What&#x27;s the plan for <br>
those events for this year? <br>
<br>
One option might be to use the &quot;European-style&quot; setup where everyone <br>
does 1-2 runs, then the best 4-8 people finish out an aveage of 5. <br>
As long as we know the plan beforehand (rather than in the middle of <br>
a solve! :-), I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.<br>
<br>
- Need any help? I&#x27;m happy to get there early and help out.<br>
<br>
thanks!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Andy said he was really taking him time on the computer cube when I
talked to him on AIM later that day.  On a real cube, you can easily
tell if you did 2 moves by accident, but on the computer cube, it is
much harder to tell if you hit two keys by accident,instead of the one
you intended to do.  Also, I&#x27;m sure the memorization took longer on
the computer cube, as it is more cumbersome to rotate it around to see
the other sides of the cube.  Oh, and as far as I know, Andy only did
one successful computer solve, as opposed to several one handed solves.

Yeah I remember when you and the crew from Owen Hall were posting all
kinds of times on speedcubing.com :-)

Glad things are well with you, and that&#x27;s awesome about the class you
taught!

Happy cubing and stay in touch!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Does replacing every turn in an algorithm with it&#x27;s double turn have<br>
any sort of significance?<br>
<br>
I was looking at this alg R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;<br>
<br>
but instead I performed it like this r u r&#x27; u&#x27; r&#x27; f r2 u&#x27; r&#x27; u&#x27; r u r&#x27; f&#x27;<br>
<br>
This is equivalent to L B D&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R D2 B&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; B R D&#x27; R&#x27; and then<br>
rotating the cube 90 degrees as y&#x27;<br>
<br>
Anyway I just thought it was cool that you could get an interesting<br>
pattern (do the turn D after the above algorithm to see a cool pattern).<br>
<br>
Does this qualify as a transformation, or is it totally and completely<br>
unrelated to the original algorithm?  I just didn&#x27;t know if turning<br>
like this had any sort of significance.<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  The state reached on the cube after doing that D turn I<br>
suggested can be reached simply by this commutator: R L D2 L&#x27; D&#x27; B D2<br>
B&#x27; D R&#x27; so the move created by doing all double turns is not the<br>
shortest way to setup this case.<br>

Tell Andy that a bunch of us are getting together to do some cubing.  
And that we can go to Saratoga.  We can go to his home, so he has no 
excuse not to come hang out with us and compete in our informal 
competition where we will do the OH-BLD event.  We will also do the BLD 
event, where I expect to be beaten soundly by a 1:42 average.

          <div class="email-content">That is a very spify pattern. I don&#x27;t think there is any 
mathematical significance though. It seems pretty random from what I 
can tell. An obvious consequence is that the &quot;action&quot; (math sense) 
on the corners would be identical. So whatever happens to the 
corners before would happen to the corners after altering a sequence 
in this manner.

Different sequences that have the same effect on the cube state, 
should act like an equivalence class since for all intensive 
purposes they are they associate with the same group element. 
Any &quot;transformation&quot; of a sequence that has mathematical 
significance should be a homomorphism on that...

In this case I can take two algs that do the same thing and 
transform this way and end up with something wildly different and 
seemingly unrelated.

If there is some significance, I don&#x27;t see it.

rubik&#x27;s cube and re-assemble it randomly, then there is a 1/12 chance

The safest thing to do is assemble it into solved state. If you 
understand the math behind this and the constraints that are imposed 
then it is possible to look at a cube and tell if it is solvable. 
Certain aspects need to be carefully counted up to do this check, and 
it is not a quick check.

This is not a &quot;dumb&quot; question, it&#x27;s perfectly legitamate thing to be 
asking, however the answer is pretty well known among cubers.

When a cuber is in a rush, they may assemble a cube randomly and get 
it close to solved state, and then fiddle with a few pieces by taking 
them out and putting them back so that it will be solvable.

Hey Hey, I just googled my name and was amazed as to how many cube<br>
links came up and was thinking about a bunch of you guys and was<br>
wondering who is still around and who&#x27;s still active. I have lost<br>
touch with the cubing world in the last few years... I have been<br>
teaching art near indianapolis for three years now and am still<br>
actively cubing. Last fall I taught a Rubik&#x27;s Cube class after school<br>
for 15 3rd-6th graders. It was an awesome time! Its amazing what<br>
the young mind can comprehend! Anyways, if anyone I have once crossed<br>
paths with reads this, I hope all is well!!! And keep cubing! I<br>
think it keeps one sane,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

The 1/12 breaks down like so : 1/2 chance of avoiding &quot;position-
parity&quot; 1/2 chance of flipping the edges correctly and finally 1/3 
chance of orienting corners correctly. Multiply these probabilities 
and u get 1/12 :D Yah, these 3 issues are completely independent of 
course ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Ok I&#x27;ve seen a few new methods come out, that are working for <br>
individuals.  I was wondering what others thought about this method.<br>
<br>
Cross<br>
3 c/e pairs<br>
Insert Last Corner -- Relatively Permuting Opposite LL Corners<br>
Insert Last Edge -- Orienting LL Edges <br>
(this preserves partial relative permutation)<br>
OLL (this preserves partial relative permutation)<br>
PLL 9 cases<br>
<br>
-the 4 ELL, and the ENVY PLLs  ... jealous?  =P<br>
-6/7 OLL cases are 2-gen the other swaps opp corners -- the &quot;U OLL&quot; <br>
corners (preserving relative partial corner permutation.<br>
The main problem is the E and Z permutations, which I am working on <br>
speeding up.  I will add this method to my site and practice it.  <br>
I&#x27;ll release it once I begin sub30 averages with it.  This has been <br>
playing in my mind, I&#x27;ve been trying to perfect the concept, this may <br>
be it.  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve seen two new methods developed that has brought the developer to <br>
sub 20 and sub 25 in the different cases.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson,<br>
<br>
So basically since Berkeley I&#x27;ve gotten my OH average down to about<br>
36. I started OH BLD cubing the following week, and my only successful<br>
time was around 4 min, but I did get several 2:40 DNFs. I guess the<br>
2:13 was easier than normal, and I had almost no hesitations. I&#x27;m<br>
still insanely inconsistent with OH BLD, as the 2:13 was around my 5th<br>
successful attempt amid dozens of failed ones.<br>
For BLD simulator, I messed up on a T-perm on my first attempt, so I<br>
went really slow on my second one.<br>
<br>
Hope that explains it,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Last night I dreamt that I was shopping in supermarket which is near<br>
where I used to live. There was a short woman with short blonde hair,<br>
quite old, and she had set up a stall selling brand new Deluxe Cubes. <br>
<br>
I picked one up and started playing with it, it turned quite smoothly<br>
and I remember thinking &quot;Wow, Stefan Pochmann told me it would take<br>
ages to adjust a Deluxe Cube to get it this smooth!&quot;, so I turned it<br>
for a bit, and the woman was looking at me scornfully as if to say<br>
&quot;That kid is such a sucker, I bet he doesn&#x27;t know the first thing<br>
about Rubik&#x27;s Cubes&quot;.<br>
<br>
So I bought the cube and walked away. I only then noticed that the<br>
colours were a bit weird, the orange was almost identical to the<br>
yellow, and there were two blue sides which were almost identical. As<br>
I knew this would be no good for speedcubing, I went back to the stall<br>
and asked the woman if I could change the cube, because it was no good<br>
for speedcubing. She took quite a nasty tone with me, and told me that<br>
all the cubes were the same, and that&#x27;s how they were made these days.<br>
I knew she was lying (I mean I&#x27;m the UK #1 and everything), and I<br>
noticed that at the bottom of one of the piles was a perfect cube,<br>
with amazing colours just right for speedcubing. So I asked her if I<br>
could change it for that one, but she told me that she didn&#x27;t like my<br>
attitude and quickly took away the cube before I could grab it, and<br>
hid it away on the top shelf of the aisle, next to some multipacks of<br>
crisps. I really felt like saying to this woman &quot;Do you know who I<br>
am?&quot;, but decided that would sound pretty ridiculous. Then she told me<br>
to &quot;go away and play with this&quot;, as she handed me a box which had<br>
written on the side &quot;For Lars Vandenbergh and Dan H&quot;. I thought &quot;she<br>
doesn&#x27;t know I&#x27;m Dan H!&quot; Inside was my worst nightmare, the broken up<br>
Pyramorphix from Dutch Cube Day that I&#x27;ve never managed to reassemble!<br>
So I knew I was never going to get that cube. <br>
<br>
I planned to steal it, so I stalked the supermarket, waiting until she<br>
had a break and moved from the aisle. I walked past once, damn, she<br>
was stacking some shelves, next time I walked past she was just<br>
walking off, &quot;brilliant&quot; I thought, &quot;now&#x27;s my chance!&quot; I tried to get<br>
the cube, but it was too high up, so I pulled this table from<br>
somewhere, (which also had a frozen chicken on it), stood on the<br>
table, and got the cube! But she was on her way back! So I hurriedly<br>
got down, put the table back, hid the cube under my coat, and made a<br>
run for it. But as I got to the doorway, the cube fell from my coat<br>
and smashed all over the floor.<br>
<br>
Has anyone else dreamt about the cube? What do you think it means? <br>

Freud would say, its probably something about your childhood or something<br>
sexual? :-p<br>
<br>
Well, I had this dream once where I was supposedly Harry Potter (that was a<br>
few days before EC 2006) and I found a position on the cube that looked very<br>
scrambled but at the same time, every face had the same kind of pattern on<br>
it, and I was told that only real magicians could solve that particular<br>
cube. I could solve it, so I guess it must mean something. And I remember<br>
thinking, woah, no way I lose EC with my skills and I did. Oh well. I guess<br>
Im not Harry Potter, probably more like Ron with my red hair, no way he<br>
could solve that cube anyway.<br>
<br>
Thats one point to add to the list: youve been cubing too much if the<br>
cube has already been the point of a dream.<br>
<br>
Oh and there was that one where I spent all night dreaming of a cube I could<br>
never solve, like, always get to the PLL, mess it up, start again, and so<br>
on. Very frustrating indeed. Sounds a lot like Sisyphus, doesnt it?<br>

I don&#x27;t remember dreaming about the cube (I usually don&#x27;t remember what I&#x27;ve dreamed...haha)

that would be great

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think is would be any faster than F2L OLL PLL.
I did come up with this one: Cross, 3 F2L pairs. Insert last pair and
orientate corners top layer. All in once. This last step is 21 (normal
PLL) + 21 (Pll only all corners misoriented) + 42 (2 opposite edges
flipped) + 84 (2 adjacent edges flipped). This is a lot less than
ZBLL. Only the step where you orientate the corners is slightly longer
cause it would be a lot cases to do this from every position so I
think about first pairing up...

So many Fridrich users try to come up with ways of reducing their move
count by adding steps with more thinking time.  If they want that so
bad why don&#x27;t those people try Heise (besides the obvious reason of
being so used to Fridrich)?

          <div class="email-content">First OLL is thoughtless, PLL is thoughtless.  Finding opp corners 
is rather thoughtless, and recognizing EO case is rather thougtless.

Correction, there are 6 cases for the last corner counting mirrors --
 they&#x27;re 3-4 move each.  And 12 cases counting mirrors across the 
F/B plane for the last edge.    The last edge is about 10 moves.  
So ... other than that.  OLL/PLL is commonplace so

I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ll have to see what times I can get.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve had periods of dreams on the recurring cube theme. I would see them in<br>
a store, and they were either really elaborate cubistic puzzles, or they<br>
were often cubes of really high complexity. I would count the tiles, and<br>
they would seem to go on and on, to something on the order of a rectangular<br>
8x16x25. Early on I had at least one cube that changed shape when I turned<br>
it, and ended up looking like a doll. These dreams may have been inspired by<br>
the likes of the snake puzzle or the octagonal barrel.<br>

I understand people from the US rater uses &quot;speed cuber&quot;, some people 
from England and the most of us from the rest of Europe 
uses &quot;speedcuber&quot;. People from for example Germany, Norway and Sweden 
would even accept words like &quot;speedcuberprofiles&quot;. It is actually the 
correct way to build words in our languages, but not in english =)

Wery nice Gunnar!

As yuo can see Gunnar now is the master of this, but for how long? It&#x27;s 
up to you guys to do something about it, I can&#x27;t, not fast enough =)

My best now is 27.04 and I also had a lucky 23.66 (skiped one step for 
the Pyraminx).

There also is an existing parallel in terminology: &quot;speed stacking&quot; 
seems to be changing into &quot;sport stacking&quot; (see 
http://www.speedstacks.com/)

Is cubing a &quot;sport&quot;? The first definition of &quot;sport&quot; (as a noun) at 
www.webster.com seems to imply so:

&quot;1 a : a source of diversion : RECREATION 
b : sexual play 
c (1) : physical activity engaged in for pleasure (2) : a particular 
activity (as an athletic game) so engaged in&quot;

OK, maybe not definition 1b. But you never know...

7(cross) + 7(BR) + 7(BL) + 7(FL) + 3(DFR) + 10(FR) + 7(OLL) + 10(PLL) = 58

That&#x27;s 4 more moves than the average for CFOP.

I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t be fast, these added steps just make it more
complex.

          <div class="email-content">Well for me it works like this:

Normal Stress (Life stress) Cubing relaxes me.

Cube stress, magic relaxes me...

Magic stress: I&#x27;m officially screwed.

Yah I was talking with Matt the other day, and I&#x27;ve talked about it with others before.  
Cubing takes your mind off everything else.  You have to focus to do it and get decent 
times, which, if you are cubing you are trying to do, since you always wanna be 
faster...Anyways, cubing clears your mind, and so it makes things seem like nothing while 
you are cubing.  When I broke up with my girlfriend a couple months ago I just sat and 
cubed for hours.  Sure, once I stopped it hit me, but waiting those few hours helped...

Cube Stress: At competitions when I am stressed out, I just get my magic out and do a 
whole lot of solves.  My hands can get really shaky...and magic kinda needs hands that are 
not normal...and so magic will bring my hands back to where they are supposed to 
be...thus I get less stressed.

Magic Stress: I haven&#x27;t found anything to help me with this, except closing my eyes, 
breathing a few deep breaths and thinking of my girlfriend.  Seeing her face smiling at me 
makes me smile and relax.  Thats the only thing, and I have to do it before each solve, 
which, for those of you that were at Rutgers fall thats what I was doing in between each 
solve, just stopping and clearing my mind so my hands stopped shaking a little...

Of course, that&#x27;s what I tried to say and I also make that clear in

          <div class="email-content">My AP European history final last year was an essay.  We had to list what we felt were the ten most important events in European history and we had to justify it.  Sounds easy and it was.  The only problem was it was long.  My teacher was very easy-going and let us talk quietly as long as we weren&#x27;t cheating  (trust me, she could tell).  My friend, after 90 minutes was losing focus slowly, along with everyone else in the room.  It became hard to concentrate and we started to get worried about time.  my friend solved his cube a few times and went back to his paper and was able to finish very quickly after.  I followed suit and found it much easier to concentrate on my essay.  Maybe it has to do with with blood circulation as your brain works quickly to solve the cube.  Maybe, I don&#x27;t know.  Anyway, that&#x27;s my two cents.

 I&#x27;m waiting to hear back from my top-choice college (i hear tomorrow night at 5!!! AHH!) and 
 thus far the only two ways i&#x27;ve found to relax myself are a) calculus and b) learning PLL.  I, up

 P.S. Thanks to everyone for all the helpful posts over the past couple of years i&#x27;ve been

&quot;Fler bollar i luften&quot; (direct translation: &quot;More balls in the air&quot;)

three balls, to relieve them from stress.

Maybe someone should start a company that does the same but with the 3x3x3 ? :)

          <div class="email-content">Why don&#x27;t they make small programs like these open source? Do they
somehow make money from them?

I really like the program but I can only use it at work in my book
shop, where I have windows. At home I use FreeBSD and it would be
great to have the source code and maybe I could make it into a
portable Qt or Gtk+ program that could work on Linux/BSD/Windows/MacOS
X.

Maybe. I think though it takes a certain kind of person to truly have the desire and drive to 
benefit from the cube as much as we do/might.  I&#x27;ve definitely heard of juggling 
workshops though (being a prof. juggler myself by technical meaning) and think that there 
could be something in at least introducing a lot of people to the cube.  

Juggling also has a different &quot;tone&quot; too: people believe that with enough practice anyone 
can juggle 3 balls.  What most people don&#x27;t know is that with enough practice, anyone can 
solve a 3x3.  I think people just assume that only smart people can solve rubik&#x27;s cubes.  
Who knows though, maybe you&#x27;re onto something.

&quot;Although she declined to give specific numbers, Hasbro spokeswoman Patricia Riso says sales of the Cube increased 73 percent from 2004 to 2005, and are expected to increase an additional 80 percent this year&quot;

That is a considerable amount, almost hard to believe.  But very nice article.

Mainstream media now, huh? Not bad.

Found this: http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/
2006/12/shot-rubiks-cube-solved-blindfolded_13.html

Gotta love the second sentence of this comment: &quot;That&#x27;s old news, you 
can see competitions of this on You Tube. They memorize the 
algorithm&quot;. BAM! The algorithm!

<br>
I just now saw your performance on CNN.  The whole setup was <br>
awesome, they had trailers for your solve throughout the whole show <br>
beforehand.<br>
<br>
Sorry about the DNF, but considering your solving conditions a) LIVE <br>
b) you had to stop AND talk between memorizing and solving, c) did I <br>
mention LIVE TV??  I thought you did amazing!  Also it looked like <br>
you were off by only 3 edges, and they looked oriented, which <br>
considering LIVE TV is pretty freakin&#x27; amazing.<br>
<br>
It was awesome Tyson, the people I was watching with thought it was <br>
extremely impressive, and they were non-cubers.  And yes I made sure <br>
we were all watching your solve when I heard about it ;-)<br>
<br>

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: CNN Live Tonight (Friday)

Tyson,

I just now saw your performance on CNN. The whole setup was 
awesome, they had trailers for your solve throughout the whole show 
beforehand.

Sorry about the DNF, but considering your solving conditions a) LIVE 
b) you had to stop AND talk between memorizing and solving, c) did I 
mention LIVE TV?? I thought you did amazing! Also it looked like 
you were off by only 3 edges, and they looked oriented, which 
considering LIVE TV is pretty freakin&#x27; amazing.

It was awesome Tyson, the people I was watching with thought it was 
extremely impressive, and they were non-cubers. And yes I made sure 
we were all watching your solve when I heard about it ;-)

Chris

P.S. I feel sorry for the girl who had to scramble your cube for an 
hour, when I&#x27;m sure there exists a 19-20 move sequence that would 
have put the cube in the same state she put it in ;-)

Impressing indeed.

I took the liberty of uploading the video to youtube and submitting
the story to digg:

http://digg.com/videos_educational/Tyson_Mao_Beauty_and_the_Geek_solving_Rubik_s_Cube_blindfolded_LIVE_on_CNN

Please digg the story so Tyson can make it to the front page of digg
(yet again ;) ).

And thanks to Jeremy for the video! I hope you or someone else can

To chojin_42: how about linking to the original, high quality version

Check out speedcubing.com for the video (or youtube).

Stefan,
I&#x27;d be glad to take care of Monday&#x27;s video also!

Until then,

Tyson,

I just now saw your performance on CNN. The whole setup was 
awesome, they had trailers for your solve throughout the whole show 
beforehand.

Sorry about the DNF, but considering your solving conditions a) LIVE 
b) you had to stop AND talk between memorizing and solving, c) did I 
mention LIVE TV?? I thought you did amazing! Also it looked like 
you were off by only 3 edges, and they looked oriented, which 
considering LIVE TV is pretty freakin&#x27; amazing.

It was awesome Tyson, the people I was watching with thought it was 
extremely impressive, and they were non-cubers. And yes I made sure 
we were all watching your solve when I heard about it ;-)

Chris

P.S. I feel sorry for the girl who had to scramble your cube for an 
hour, when I&#x27;m sure there exists a 19-20 move sequence that would 
have put the cube in the same state she put it in ;-)

:)

It&#x27;s very funny that you were dressed like that because when I watched it I
was wearing just the same kind of stuff : same color shirt and a blazer (of
the same color of course) on top of it (I had to do a presentation in
English later that day)

Maybe a French guy could get on France 24 soon, that would be cool too :D

          <div class="email-content">I was wearing those clothes because I had an interview with a local  
television news station that morning.  I went to work dressed like that  
:-P

Yeah... it was actually kind of tough blindfolding with like, noises  
and music and Anderson Cooper blaring into my right ear.  I don&#x27;t think  
you can see it, but I&#x27;m wearing an ear piece.

As for the girl, I don&#x27;t know her.  She&#x27;s genuinely a complete  
stranger.  I think it was kind of bad that they had an asian girl do  
the scrambling.  I don&#x27;t know what stereotype it reinforces, but after  
seeing all those racist comments on yahoo, it&#x27;d be nice to get away  
from it a little bit.

As I said, they&#x27;re going to air me doing a successful solve (me not  
being a complete idiot) on Monday.  Hopefully someone can capture that  
as I don&#x27;t have the equipment (nor do I get the channel).

Oh and Marcus, she&#x27;s a bit old for you probably.  I estimate she&#x27;s  
about 26 years old... and she&#x27;s engaged to the person who&#x27;s running the  
camera.  If you want to meet girls, play chess.  That&#x27;s why I play  
chess.  I&#x27;m not even kidding.

Objet : [Speed cubing group] effect of Will Smith?









  


    
            I like to watch this site to see trends on the web, and to check

ranking of sites I develop: trends.google. com



You can actually see the relative amount of searches that are done.



Now check the trend for the search term &quot;rubik&quot;:

http://www.google. com/trends? q=rubik



I guess that is the effect of a mainstream movie starring a Rubik&#x27;s cube.



Now if you think the Rubik&#x27;s cube is popular, compare it to sudoku

http://www.google. com/trends? q=rubik%2C+ sudoku



Have fun playing with Google&#x27;s statistics ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I think it&#x27;s best to learn by combining rote memorization with 
understanding. There are a lot of methods you can use, some are more 
intuitive than others. Check out Ryan Heise&#x27;s site for an intuitive 
approach. To get really fast, I don &#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way around 
memorizing algorithms. F2L algorithms are easier to memorize if you 
understand them; they usually pair up a corner edge pair and then 
insert them together. In my opinion there&#x27;s not much point in trying 
to understand last layer algorithms. My advice is memorize first, 
understand later. --- In

          <div class="email-content">A very special woman to me is a cuber.  She lost her cube a few <br>
months ago, and I think she is going through withdrawls.  I&#x27;ve <br>
played with  a few of the good ones, and I thought I&#x27;d try to find <br>
her a new one for christmas.<br>
<br>
So about 3 dozen cubes later,  and after pilfering every target, k-<br>
mart, toy&#x27;s R us,  ETC. that I could find,  and all of them that I <br>
turned out the same.  So I thought &quot;there must be more than just <br>
these 2 brands&quot;.  I did some searching, lo and behold I&#x27;m right! <br>
there are (course,  you all saw that one coming)<br>
<br>
So now, I have very little time left before christmas, the only <br>
seller of the good cubes on ebay is shipping form the UK, and there <br>
is no way in heck it would ever get here before the 25&#x27;th, let alone <br>
with enough time to adjust and lubricate it as all of the pages are <br>
saying needs to be done.<br>
<br>
<br>
Can anyone help me figure out where I can go to pick one up? I&#x27;m <br>
near san antonio texas, but I&#x27;ll drive 700 miles if I have to, and <br>
price isn&#x27;t really the issue.  I just need to find one before <br>
christmas.  <br>
<br>
Now what to do with a few dozen POS cubes......<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance for any help.  It would be greatly appriciated.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Finally a beginner that isn&#x27;t lazy and actually wants to do things on
their own.  I congratualate you for that.

The Roux method is mostly intuitive, not much to memorize.  It can be
hard but where&#x27;s the fun in something easy?  grrroux.free.fr

Petrus is intuitive for the first two layers.  lar5.com

Like the last poster said, try out Ryan Heise&#x27;s method.  ryanheise.com

Not true.  Most cubers are just too lazy to try it for the same amount
of time that they spend practicing their memorized stuff.

          <div class="email-content">are these good cubes?  I haven&#x27;t heard anything good about 
rubik&#x27;s.com, and I have at least 16 of them sitting next to me that 
say they don&#x27;t move very well.   Are the DIY kits comparable to the 
Hungarian cubes?

          <div class="email-content">they say orders placed after december 10th are not guaranteed to 
arive before christmas.  Which leaves me little doubt that this late 
in the game, it would not arrive in time :/  I&#x27;m hoping to find one 
of the hungarian ones on a shelf some where, Or someone who has an 
extra speed cube they would be willing to sell.  Or anything else 
that would let me ensure to get it in time :/

          <div class="email-content">Hello and welcome to the sport of speedcubing!
  It is quite addicting, and becomes a daily activity when you start getting into it, and it is not only fun, but good for you.  Whenever someone starts learning to solve, I always tell them to not really memorize the alg, but try to see where the pieces are going.  It may be a good idea for you to memorize the alg as is, and once you can do it easily without much thinking, try watching the pieces, and the alg comes much easier to you.  Check out my beginners guide here if you haven&#x27;t yet:
http://www40.brinkster.com/patjk/beginners.html&lt;http://www40.brinkster.com/patjk/beginners.html>

Being able to solve it is quite simple, just work at it, and feel free to ask if you have questions.  Good luck,
Patrick

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] a newbie, just joined


  Hi, I just wanted to say hi after just joining tis group. I have a new 
  interesting in the cube.. possessed-like I seached stores for a cube 
  yesterday, without luck. My husband found one for me today. I&#x27;ve always 
  been really fast at solving one side of the cube, but never really 
  tried to work the rest of it.. Just recently realized the side pieces 
  have to go in a certain place and match up with the other sides! (no, 
  I&#x27;m not dumb, just never looked that close I guess) *laugh* I read it 
  somewhere recently and had a lightbulb moment that threw me into what I 
  think is going to be a new obsession!

  Anyway, I have seen some websites and though they are great... I dont 
  want to &#x27;just do&#x27; the algs. I try one when I&#x27;m stuck and try to watch 
  whats happening.. but it seems that when I am focusing on doing an alg. 
  step by step, I&#x27;m not &#x27;seeing&#x27; whats happening.

  Any tips to see and understand what I am doing while I am using an alg 
  for help and learning? I&#x27;d like to keep it intuitive, I think I&#x27;d grow 
  bored fast if I felt that I was just repeating algs/steps in my head.

  Thanks!

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, well this may be a dumb question, but did you try lubing any of the
cubes with silicone? I mean, I don&#x27;t know of any cubes (besides the
Rubik&#x27;s DIY cubes and the studio cubes) that are really smooth right out
of the box. I&#x27;m sure with the 3 dozen cubes you have, a bunch of them
would actually turn pretty well after you add some silicone.

Also, you said you live in San Antonio? Well, I live in Sugar Land
(suburb of Houston), I could probably sell you one of my cubes if you&#x27;d
like. Email me personally if you want more info.

If you say you work on the &lt;R, r, U, u> group on the 4x4, it means that you

those moves.
And of course cube rotations are not allowed. ;-)

(U r&#x27; U2 r2 U2 r U&#x27;) R (U r&#x27; U2 r2 U2 r U&#x27;) R&#x27; flips two edge pairs.
Or, using the commutator notation: [U r&#x27; U2 r2 U2 r U&#x27;, R]

About parity, I don&#x27;t know how to fix it effectively. I&#x27;ve never tried

This is amusing.  We&#x27;re making the same accusations that other people make
about ourselves.  Though of course, we know what&#x27;s possible and what&#x27;s

&gt;From the article Chris Hardwick posted, and from Tyson&#x27;s busy media <br>
schedule, it sure sounds like we could be in the middle of a cubing <br>
resurgence?<br>
<br>
I decided to give a Rubik&#x27;s Cube as part of the gift exchange at <br>
work, and when I was in the mall I saw that the Discovery Channel <br>
store had *tons* of the 25th Anniversary cubes for sale. I&#x27;ve found <br>
those are pretty decent cubes once they&#x27;re broken in (even before <br>
lubing). So, I grabbed one. While I was browsing around the store <br>
(like 5-10 minutes) I saw three other people buying cubes (one <br>
person was buying two).<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s well-known at work that I&#x27;m a cuber, just recently multiple <br>
people have told me that they or their kids are cubers. I point them <br>
all to speedcubing.com and the January competition in San Francisco <br>
(I live in Sacramento).<br>
<br>
It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what kind of crowd we have at the <br>
January competition.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi!!

Stefan POchmann was heavily into UuRr solving over a yr ago. He 
reached an awesome average of about 1:10 or so, cannot quite recall. 
He also made vids of it. Not sure where these can be found now ...
If only he had come up with a fast 2x2x4 block first method, that 
UuRr solving would be faster then his normal 4x4x4 solving style :D 

There&#x27;s no positions that would be impossible after 2x2x4 and 
proceeding solving with the 4 remaining free slices ...

          <div class="email-content">Hi, and welcome!

that little lightbulb moment is good hurdle to get over--when i 
teach newbies, i try to explain that concept by pointing out that 
all the white stickers are not created equal.  i&#x27;ll pull a piece out 
to show that it&#x27;s attached to the side piece.  it&#x27;s definitely 
critical to get that concept.

my tip for learning algs would be to try to understand at least a 
little bit about what they&#x27;re doing, but go by rote memorization 
because if you have to becuase eventually you will understand 
better.  

also, i like doing the algs slowly at first, and then once i have it 
down, practicing it like 10 or 20 times holding the cube under a 
desk so i&#x27;m not looking at it.  if you do the same alg over and over 
again, it will come back to the original state.  Also good practice 
is practicing the OLL algs with their inverse pairs (start with 
solved cube, do one OLL alg, which sets up a different OLL case, 
then do OLL alg for that case twice (first time orients LL, second 
time sets up the case for the first OLL alg you did), then alternate 
doing each OLL alg 2x).  you can learn a lot of the OLL algs this 
way, and it helped me because when first learning those algs it was 
hard for me to set up the cube for the alg i was trying to learn.   
this way, you learn an alg to solve, and an alg to set it up at the 
same time.  you want to be able to do the algs without watching the 
cube so that when you actually do the algs you can focus on looking 
for other pieces that you need for the next step.  it also just 
frees your fingers to work without waiting for your eyes to catch up.

Good luck, and happy cubing!

<br>
Thanks for the welcome, tips and links. <br>
<br>
I just solved the cube for the first time. While I&#x27;m happy to of done <br>
it, I cant help feeling like I cheated or something LOL.<br>
<br>
I was having trouble with the LL and ended up using broncoviper&#x27;s <br>
tutorial (thanks). I dont feel like I know how I did it.. I mean.. <br>
anyone can just follow instructions. <br>
<br>
Not sure what to do now, keeping doing the directions over and over <br>
until I &#x27;see&#x27; it or try a different method.. I looked at the more <br>
intuitive methods, like with making the 2x2 boxes.. that blew my mind.. <br>
I couldnt keep track of where the pieces I wanted to work with were, or <br>
envision the box I was trying to make.<br>

          <div class="email-content">  Oh, just saw this reply, thank you! I will try some of these ideas. 
You are right about understanding concepts. I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot 
of the websites with algs. do not explain what you are doing or 
trying to do. That helps me so much, even if its just a little &quot;You 
are trying to get ____ to move to ____ by ___ ___. 

I guess my mind is a bit different than most, I need to understand 
rather than follow a recipe.. although I will try the advice given, 
to do algs until I can see whats happening. 

I am finding that when I work the cube on my own, I move things in a 
way that seems to be different than how algs. do/describe. Its hard 
to explain but.. I tend to twist 2 layers at once, and see things 
that way too (sort of backward from holding the 2 layers still and 
moving one edge). I know that in essence it is the same thing/move, 
but they &#x27;feel&#x27; different to me. I am also left-handed, if this makes 
any difference. And I tend to see and do my own moves with more of a 
erm.. slicing type approach.. I tend to turn my 2 layers one way and 
then turn the bottom of those two back.. so its like slicing through 
the center

whoa.. sorry for the babbling, not sure if these things make sense to 
anyone but me, but oh well! Thanks again.

Na, you are not used to it yet, in time yuo will understand why 
cubers does things like they do =)

So am I, and it makes difference. If you got an alg: R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; 
R&#x27; [U2] (sune backwards) then I rather turn the cube 180 degrees so I 
can do L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; [U2] instead, it&#x27;s much faster for me.

Double layer turns are often used to make algs faster to execute, 
those turns are denoted using lower case letters, r does the same as 
R+M&#x27; (M is the middle layer). All cubers are using slice turns (M E 
and S), thing is: if you only do those then you will not do anything 
to the corners, only edges and centres moves.

one thing I found and that is when you are in star shape at start of <br>
the solve and is about to transform to a cube, then it matters where <br>
you split the star if you get an parity error or not. It takes just one <br>
turn of the star to fix... one turn! (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but my <br>
parity alg does cube -&gt; star, turn star once, star -&gt; cube so I&#x27;m <br>

But I&#x27;m totaly confused (because of the shape shift) when it comes to <br>

You know you&#x27;re a cuber if... you can understand and explain that 
algorithm just by thinking about it (don&#x27;t have a 4x4 with me right 
now). Then again, it&#x27;s admittedly rather obvious.

One can be found in the videos section on his website:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/videos/

And he thinks his average was higher, more like 1:20, but he doesn&#x27;t

recommend using Gilles Roux&#x27;s method. The first few steps are mainly 
intuitive and he uses a lot of slice moves because he leaves 2 of 
the bottom edges for later, like a working space.

          <div class="email-content">You know, I figured out why Sudoku is so popular.  People who can&#x27;t <br>
solve a face on a Rubik&#x27;s Cube can do the Sudoku.  Anyone can do the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube, sure, but it takes work.  For Sudoku, anyone can do the <br>
Sudoku, and it doesn&#x27;t even take practice.  It takes practice to get <br>
good, but you don&#x27;t have to learn anything at all.  Rubik&#x27;s Cube has a <br>
learning curve.  Sudoku doesn&#x27;t.<br>
<br>
I was on this airplane to New York, and this woman next to me was <br>
curious about the cube, so I thought I&#x27;d try to teach her a bit.  She <br>
was horrible... couldn&#x27;t put four white edges next to the yellow <br>
center.  Eventually, she gave up... and she pulls out a Sudoku.<br>
<br>
So there&#x27;s no argument whether or not Sudoku is &quot;better&quot; than Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Cube.  They&#x27;re different.  One is simply much more accessible to the <br>
mass population than the other.<br>

Yeah, it&#x27;s really simple. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t bother to explain it.
Just executing it once while watching the cube should be enough.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, this pre-qualifying basically acts as a substitute to your first round
on the day of the competition.  It&#x27;s more of a hassle to you, but to the
people who can make it, it would be of great assistance to the competition
and will allow more time for more events.  Otherwise, we will have to cancel
some of the other events.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys, I just joined this group recently.<br>
<br>
I just learned how to do the Rubik&#x27;s cube several weeks ago using the<br>
Layer by Layer Beginner&#x27;s method and was able to achieve a fastest<br>
time of 1:14. Since then, I have wanted to learn a newer method so<br>
that I could achieve faster times. I have done some researching on the<br>
internet and I came across the Fridrich method. <br>
<br>
How much faster do you think I will be able to get if I learn the<br>
4-look Fridrich method (just to help with a faster LL solve)? I have<br>
tried learning the Fridrich F2L intuitively to no avail. <br>

          <div class="email-content">By using a Cross + Fridrich F2L + 4-look last layer, you could drop your
times to the low twenties. However, this would require months of training.

I am using a Cross + Working Corner (keyhole) + 4 look last layer and have a
30.06 12/10 average. Practise is more important than the amount of
algorithms you know. Only if you want to get really fast (sub 20) you need
to learn many more algorithms (and also practice a lot).

          <div class="email-content">i think if youre gonna go for times like sub30, you should at least<br>
learn 3 look LL (EOLL,COLL,PLL). it will give you a significant boost<br>
from 4 look while only learning around 30 algos. and recognition isnt<br>
quite as hard as OLL.<br>
<br>
plus constant practicing of F2L will get really annoying, while<br>
learning PLL takes some time and is kinda fun =P.<br>

I bought a pyraminx in June of this year, but I have not been able to<br>
use it because one of the vertex pieces containing the screw came loose.<br>
However, the cap which contains the head of the screw is glued very<br>
tightly, and I cannot access it.  Does anyone know what kind of<br>
solvent I should use on the glue...or if I should do that at all?  In<br>
addition, how can I remove the barrels which contain a spring and<br>

          <div class="email-content">learning fridrich f2l cuts down your time so incredibly much if you&#x27;re
trying to get under thirty just learning it would probably get you
there after a while. without f2l, you can definitely get under a
minute with 4-look and layer by layer. i have a friend who can do it
in 45 seconds on average using those methods, but his turn speed&#x27;s
about as fast as mine (pretty fast, i guess, 3-4 turns per second
maybe, don&#x27;t know if he pauses a lot). i think when i used a 4-look
last layer with fridrich&#x27;s f2l i got around 30, i believe... i might
be wrong...

well anyway, f2l isn&#x27;t too bad. intuitive approach is great, but i
think for most ppl (including me) if you just look at a few (5, 6,
maybe more) of the shorter algorithms and memorize them, then work
with them a bit you&#x27;ll see how they work after a while and you can
basically make the rest of the algorithms yourself. that&#x27;s how it
worked for me. of course, as time went on i saw more efficient ways of
doing the f2l pairs from certain situations, which is why it&#x27;s
probably good to check your algorithms against posted ones from time
to time.

You cannot judge a cuber who had not declared anything simply 
because nobody had passed before him. 

My alien trick show + my unique domain name + my unique old picture 
on Toronto on this web, it&#x27;s a curious hazard only ? 

Lucky ? 

Who is the first one person fusion faker-cuber on tv ? 

I presume your mother hahahaha  

Congratulation you are official and big star cuber tv 2005-2006 and

So what! your bad luck it&#x27;s funny

you are a nutjob and a jerk.  you are a cheater and have been busted, everyone knows you&#x27;re a fake, and can&#x27;t really do some of the things you claim. you wonder why you don&#x27;t get much attention, that&#x27;s because YOU AREN&#x27;T THAT GOOD.  maybe back in the 80&#x27;s when you started growing that dead mink on your upper lip, you were something special with your mediocre times, but now, you&#x27;re just another hack.  if you wish to proove different then start using your fingers at a competition instead of at your keyboard.  just because you are jealous of tyson&#x27;s opportunites doesn&#x27;t mean you should make fun of him, i would love to see you two in a controlled blindfold contest, i have 100$ that says tyson would kick your ass.

            Cheater NO !!! FAKER



An original guy which has been judged like in a competition to the 

dead zone cube time

 

You cannot judge a cuber who had not declared anything simply 

because nobody had passed before him. 



My alien trick show + my unique domain name + my unique old picture 

on Toronto on this web, it&#x27;s a curious hazard only ? 



Lucky ? 



Who is the first one person fusion faker-cuber on tv ? 



I presume your mother hahahaha  



Congratulation you are official and big star cuber tv 2005-2006 and

So what! your bad luck it&#x27;s funny

          <em>Date:</em> Fri, 22 Dec 2006 09:33:01 -0800<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">I was thinking about this on my way to work, and the entire situation is
both amusing and sad.  On one hand, my e-mail of course is some what
puerile, but I think I&#x27;m allowed to slap some people around evervy now and
then.  But now, examining the situation...

If Gaetan really could indeed solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded in blazing
speed, imagine how much press that could generate for him?  He was on FOX
news before, and so he certainly must have contacts.  Simply go, tell some
news agency or someone with the capacity to produce a show that you can beat
Tyson Mao at solving a Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded.  Hollywood and televisions
love all that type of drama.

But anyway, that&#x27;s besides to point.  Here are the reasons why no one
respects you, and the actions you have failed to perform to remove this
doubt.

First, a solve time of 30 seconds is ridiculous.  It&#x27;s possible, but not
likely.  People who make claims but don&#x27;t back them off earn absolutely no
respect in our world.  We all know this, and we all know who the
perpetrators are.  You must somehow demonstrate that you have the knowledge
and aptitude to solve a cube blindfolded in 30 seconds.  If you could
explain to use your method, maybe we would see that you&#x27;ve put in some
effort, and actually have some idea of what you&#x27;re doing.

May I remind you of a good friend of ours and his amazing &quot;corners first&quot;
method which produced sub-17 second results back when sub-17 was
ridiculous?  He was never &quot;ready&quot; to release his method, and he never
explained anything about it.  No one believed him, and his excuses for never
being able to solve added to our speculation.  Where is he now?  He&#x27;s where
you&#x27;ve been for a long time, except he at least did a solitary good act for
the world of Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  You&#x27;ve done nothing.

The second item which really kills any credibility you might have is the
complete lack of sense you have when it comes to writing e-mails.  Did you
take a crack at my mother in this last one?  She is a very hard working
woman and I respect her very much.  If we were football (soccer) players,
you would have earned a headbutt to your chest.  Originally when I read your
e-mails, I gave you the benefit of the doubt that somehow there was a
language barrier and that English was not a strong language for you and
perhaps some of the ideas you were trying to convey were being
misinterpreted because of a French to English translation.  This, as we have
found, is not the case.  The latest e-mail you&#x27;ve written makes perfect
sense to me.  It takes me time to decode your other e-mails, but you
generally have little validity into whatever asinine point you have.  But
anyway, moving right along...

Third... those videos.  What the hell is with those videos?  Your latest
video of me actually made sense.  Congratulations, you actually landed a
punch on me.  You must be quite proud of yourself, but this can&#x27;t possibly
negate the absolute nonesense which you have shown us in the past.  What&#x27;s
with bringing out old e-mail conversations?  These people you are trying to
degrade, they deserve to be left alone.  They do nothing to make your life
more difficult.

You can mess with me as much as you&#x27;d like.  I have no problem standing here
bracing myself against whatever attack you can throw my way.  In some way,
I&#x27;ve earned it, because I&#x27;ll throw punches back at you.  But I acknowledge
this fact.  A real man (or woman, to be politically correct), stands up for
what he believes in, and what he&#x27;s done, and takes responsibility for his
actions.

Why don&#x27;t you stand up for yourself?  If you have as much talent as you try
to make us believe, it would be such a waste that probably everyone in this
forum gives you absolutely no respect.  Simply explain yourself in a
coherent manner, and I might even begin to respect you.

Clearly, this is an impossible takes for you.  In any case, here&#x27;s a parting
thought.

You were on national television way before I was.  You solved the Rubik&#x27;s
Cube blindfolded faster than I did, and you did it correct on your first
try, something I failed to do.  Why, good sir if you will, have I become
known on the television circuit, and you have faded into obscurity?

I know the answer.  It extends beyond what you can do with the cube.  It is
how you interact with people.  Think about it, and think about where you
want your life to go.  If you can do what you claim to do, you could have
easily had everything that has come my way, and more.

The world thinks I&#x27;m special.  The cubers in this forum know I&#x27;m not.  I was
simply lucky, the man with the right skill at the right time.  You were that
person once as well.  How many other opportunities in your life have
disappeared, simply because of who you are?

  Some goodies for you, just in time for Christmas...

  - blindfolded version: http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/blind.html&lt;http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/blind.html>

  - permalinks.

  Permalinks allow you to link directly to your own solve (e.g. from your
  home page). For example, here is a link to my current record solve:

  http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/record.cgi?db=single&amp;name=Ryan%20Heise&lt;http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/record.cgi?db=single&amp;name=Ryan%20Heise>

could mean some very fast times.

 I bought a pyraminx in June of this year, but I have not been able to
 use it because one of the vertex pieces containing the screw came loose.
 However, the cap which contains the head of the screw is glued very
 tightly, and I cannot access it.  Does anyone know what kind of
 solvent I should use on the glue...or if I should do that at all?  In
 addition, how can I remove the barrels which contain a spring and
 ball?  I have taken apart the entire puzzle except for three of the
 vertex axes.
 
 Thanks

that blindfolded version is really cool...specially the part that it turns grey when you start moving : ) but I had my eyes closed...stopped &#x27;cause it&#x27;s been a long time since I last played with it, and got confused with some moves...but I&#x27;ll try to get familiar (again) with the controls and beat that time....

          <div class="email-content">But I mess up very often, mostly because it&#x27;s hard to get good
lighting for feetcubing. Again some tips: 
1. Try to avoid U-moves (at least for me they are difficult), so cross
on B may be the best choice.
Sune: R&#x27; F2 R F R&#x27; F R 
U-permutation: R B&#x27; R B R B R B&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R2  
2. Don&#x27;t use a very loose cube ,because stuck turns are horrible.
3. Praacticeeee...
I can do all OLL and PLL algs with my feet.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
  I am cuber with an F2L of about 19sec and and best solve average of <br>
28.7sec. I&#x27;ve just got a qestion about F2L and one about the Cross <br>
and I hope I can explain the questions correcly. <br>
<br>
1. F2L<br>
  When you have a pair, your finger know how to put it into its <br>
correct slot (i.e. Step 1:the pair up and Step 2:the insertion) and <br>
you find the next pair.<br>
When do most sub 20ish cubers decide what moves it will take to <br>
insert pair 2?<br>
<br>
Before pair 1 Match up<br>
Before pair 1 Insertion<br>
After pair 1 Insertion<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is that I&#x27;m trying to developpe an exercise to <br>
advance my F2L. An exercice I am trying is I match up pair 1, line it <br>
up to its insertion slot (i.e. U turn) then I STOP until I know how <br>
to match up the next pair and line it up with it&#x27;s insertion slot <br>
perform the match up and line up of pair 2 adn STOP and so on.<br>
<br>
2. The Cross<br>
<br>
When Determining moves to complete the cross is it OK (if you will) <br>
to not have the last section of moves memorized? Can I or do most <br>
cubers sometimes mentally picture where the location of the last <br>
cross piece will be only while performing the first 2-3. <br>
I think that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m lacking, It seems to take a frustratingly <br>
long time to determine the location of the 4th cross piece will after <br>
the shuffle of the cube while inserting the first three cross pieces <br>
therefore I only know how to inserts the last cross piece into its <br>
location when the first three pieces have been inserted (Though I <br>
close my eyes for the cross).<br>
<br>

since I&#x27;m in China right now, I&#x27;ll try and do the same... I already did today on the Great Wall independently of seeing your video (don&#x27;t have my computer here, I&#x27;m using a public one), and I&#x27;ll do it at Tian&#x27;anmen (sp?) tomorrow (we got a concert there), the forbidden palace, Xi&#x27;an, Shanghai, and whereverI can on my trip. We are indeed traveling a lot, and there are some places I haven&#x27;t been told yet... Probably a lot more than that. Touring with orchestras is fun...

Yeah, me too. I went to Paris in December, and I must say it is very

Edges are not closed so the air can get away and thus the edge starts to
sink. ;-)

That&#x27;s why it is very hard to speedbuild a rubik&#x27;s cube under water. :p

Last week I taught my girlfriend how to cube.  She&#x27;s already at 2 and a half minutes, and <br>
progressing quickly.  She is quite good for someone who just started.  Anyways, my question <br>
is this:  She told me yesterday that she thought she was getting some calasses on her fingers <br>
from cubing, but I didn&#x27;t think it was from cubing.  Has anyone else ever gotten calasses <br>

Yeah, particularly after only studying the cube for about 10 seconds. 
I trust they explained that properly? And the guy with the beard 
needs to talk a lot less.

Unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t explain it. They just said &quot;now he&#x27;s going
to solve the cube blindfolded! and one handed!&quot;

He looks at it for 10 seconds and one of the hosts exclaims, &quot;wow,
that&#x27;s it?&quot; No mention about how he must have memorized that cube
beforehand.

          <div class="email-content">I have a few of the 2005 cubes I purchased from Target here in the <br>
U.S. The centers appears to be solid plastic - I cannot figure out a <br>
way to pry the center caps off, if they exist. Any advice? <br>
<br>
They are black with the curved center pieces.<br>
<br>
I bought three cubes before I knew you could try them and return the <br>
good ones. One of them is a rocket without any adjustments to the <br>
springs. The other two are ridiculously stiff and no amount of work <br>
removing manufacturing imperfections or siliconing seems to help. <br>

I&#x27;ve a new category to submit to the WCA approbation.<br>
I called it &quot;inspection blindfold&quot;.<br>
The cube is on the table, and when you take it, the timer starts. You<br>
look at it and when you are sure you will succeed in finishing the<br>
cube blindfolded, you put the cube on the table and stops the timer. <br>
The judge looks at the scrambled cube and ask you &quot;Are you sure you&#x27;ll<br>
finish it blindfolded ?&quot;. If you are sure, you answer &quot;yes&quot; and the<br>
time is saved, if the judge thinks that you don&#x27;t lie.<br>
If he thinks you lie, you&#x27;ve done a DNF.<br>

  Hi everyone,

  I was on my local news station tonight for the cube. I was hired by 
  the organization running our New Year&#x27;s celebration for a 2 hour 
  performance at a venue to demonstrate/talk about the cube. They are 
  doing a flashback section along the street from the 70&#x27;s through the 
  90&#x27;s and of course the cube is featured in the 80&#x27;s section.

  I tried to catch the clip on tape but was unsuccessful. Anyway the 
  clip was only about 10-20 seconds long. First they showed my hands 
  close up solving, then they showed a fast forwarded (clearly marked 
  with a sub-title) 17 second solve.

  I wanted to get the video up here but I probably goofed the setting 
  on my VCR or something so the video didn&#x27;t capture.

  Well, cubing is certainly growing in the media in my local area 
  because of the Pursuit of Happyness movie and all of Tyson&#x27;s media 
  coverage. I hope this movie has more effect on the cubing community 
  in general, because it certainly is putting it in the spotlight in 
  my local area.

  Happy cubing,

im a very slow cuber, and still since i got one, at least 10 people i 
know have gotten cubes as a result of me loving it.

I received a Rubik&#x27;s Jr (2x2x2 with 5 sides pink, 1 side green, with a
monkey on one pink side) and the Rubik&#x27;s world (2x2x2 sphere).  Both
are fun, but not anywhere near as challenging as blindsolving...which
is my goal to have learned by mid-January....

          <div class="email-content">How about this :

You solve a cube without looking at the timer. Then you must guess the
time you have made, and the difference with the real time is added to it.

Or more in Edouard&#x27;s spirit :

The judge is blindfolded. The competitor solve the cube, and then the
judge must guess is the cube is solved or not.
If the judge thinks it is solved, then the time is accepted (even if
the cube is not actually solved).
If the judge thinks it&#x27;s not solved, and he&#x27;s right, then it&#x27;s a DNF.
If the judge thinks it&#x27;s not solved, and he&#x27;s wrong, he must do a
speed blindfold immediately !

For the second... If the judge is blindfolded, the competitor can
cheat... So we need a second judge, who looks at the other judge (if
he doesn&#x27;t cheat) and the competitor. And maybe a third judge who
judges the two other... und so weiter...

          <div class="email-content">Why not disqualify the judge for cheating and let the competitor 
judge himself? Blindfolded, of course =)

That will save a lot of judges.

Problem is, how do we know the judge cheated?

Well, simply let the competitor guess if he did or not. If he guess 
the judge chaeted then he is out (it&#x27;s not clear if it is the judge 
or the competitor who is out). If the guess is that the judge did not 
cheat, then the competitor is taking the wrong guess (I&#x27;m sure) and 
the judge is definitly out!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris!

I&#x27;m in the area (chapel hill/carrboro) and i was wondering if the raleigh celebration will 
have a competition.  I&#x27;ve never entered one before (because a majority are out west or 
otherwise inaccessible) and would really love the opportunity.  If there isn&#x27;t going to be 
one that&#x27;s cool, i&#x27;ll probably still end up there anyway.  I know a couple othere people who 
are going to try and come too.

Also, i&#x27;m president of the rubik&#x27;s cube club at my school and i was wondering if maybe we 
could work something out and have you visit one of out meetings and maybe give us a 
talk or something.  Let me know.  (my real email address is captnjohnny1618@... 
if you want to reach me that way) thanks!

          <div class="email-content">Well, hopefully your cubes come back.  I know they miss you.

There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to feel inferior simply because your times 
are in the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s instead of 10&#x27;s and 20&#x27;s.  Everyone,

  I&#x27;m trying to learn how to solve the cube without any algorithms (unless i came up with them myself, without a computer)<br>
<br>
  Is this feasible? I&#x27;m working through Joël&#x27;s tutorial on commutators, which is helpful, but i&#x27;m hoping there is something/somebody out there to provide additional advice for me.<br>
<br>
  If Joël reads this, I encourage you to beef up your commutators tutorial! It&#x27;s good stuff, but more depth would be ever better! <br>

If you consider only the (independent) corners subgroup, we already 
know that when solving &lt;R,U> on the 2x2, that once the bottom 4 
corners are solved then the top 4 must be permuted properly relative 
to each other. Hence, positions that do not satisfy this corners 
constraint on the 4x4 would not be &lt;R,R,U,u> solvable.

Another example would be the T-Perm on the 4x4; it&#x27;s not in &lt;R,R,U,u>.

          <div class="email-content">I could be wrong but i belive most of the new model rubik cubes all <br>
have an internal nail type system kind like a screw however which <br>
prevents the pieces from coming out or being pryed out. This makes <br>
most of the newer models non adjustable and not so great for speed <br>
cubing. If you get an older cube id say 80&#x27;s era or a diy kit from <br>
rubiks.com or other cube specialty online you can adjust. Keep working <br>
your cube in though and it will get better with time. Sanding the <br>

compatible. However, I think that video could have used better

Personally, I never understood why anyone would actually want to solve 
a cube with their feet (assuming they had two good hands). The last 
time I gave it a try was about 6 yrs ago. It&#x27;d probably take me 12 
minutes. I&#x27;m very parinoid about germs, and wouldn&#x27;t want anyone&#x27;s 
feet on either my timer or cube (including my own feet). Just thinking 
about it makes me shudder.

Yet, I am still impressed by anyone who can solve it under 2 minutes 
this way. (Just never want to see it in-person.)

          <div class="email-content">It is a piety no one has bothered to answer this yet, but I&#x27;ll give <br>
it a try.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t normally use Fridrich F2L though, so my advice might not be <br>
what you are looking for. (Well on the 5x5 I use it exclusiely since <br>
it&#x27;s better suited to less inspection time than what I normally use <br>
on 3x3.) And, you ask the advice of a sub-20 cuber, while I don&#x27;t <br>
consider myself to be, although I get a few single sub-15 times on a <br>
daily basis.<br>
<br>
First off, I think a good goal/plateau to be targeting is 13 seconds <br>
(or at least that used to be a good rule-of-thumb back in the day). <br>
It&#x27;s not terribly hard to get sub-7s on any 2-look LL. I used to be <br>
there, and need to get myself back down to 13s ave.<br>
<br>
In general, I think that at your level (I am guessing from the way <br>
you sound), that the F2L excersize you describe is a good thing. But <br>
here&#x27;s some stuff to move forward to, when you&#x27;re ready.<br>
<br>
What I recommend doing is to stop thinking about F2L algs as &quot;match-<br>
up then insert&quot;. It should be a single fluid motion that takes ~1.0s <br>
to execute. In fact, for some of the more awkward cases none of the <br>
optimal algs will be of this form (match-up then insert).<br>
<br>
Ideally, you plan out the next pair at the same time you start the <br>
current alg. In practice, many times I encounter situations where 2 <br>
or more are ready to go and I have to pick from that set of pairs. <br>
Moreover, I think of it as picking from a collection of *ALGS*, and <br>
knowing in advaced that one alg won&#x27;t effect another pair that I <br>
have located. Thus I do two algs in rapid succession. If this is not <br>
feasible, then I chose one pair/alg that gives a better setup for <br>
the other pair.<br>
<br>
Of course this is borderline multi-slotting stuff, but this is <br>
good... In which case, it can be as advanced as looking for <br>
opportunities where you &quot;pair-up up A *while* inserting B&quot; and vice-<br>
versa.<br>
<br>
Right after the cross, and really throughout F2L, I scan the LL for <br>
F2L pieces. So really, I just try to be ready for whatever junk may <br>
get &quot;kicked out&quot; of a slot, hoping for the best.<br>
<br>
For the final F2L pair, I do ZB so that there is less overhead for <br>
the LL and a greater chance for 1-alg LL.<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, now for the cross.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to close your eyes during cross. In <br>
fact I don&#x27;t blink during a solve. (I try really hard not to blink <br>
during 5x5 either, lol.) It&#x27;s always possible for some level of your <br>
conciousness to pick up on certain patterns and/or plan ahead <br>
further.<br>
<br>
Closing your eyes for cross is a good excersize, ...for a beginner.<br>
<br>
Definately plan out at least 3 pieces of the cross. AND don&#x27;t try to <br>
solve them into &quot;absolute position&quot; only &quot;relative postion&quot;. I <br>
vaugely recall Dan H. making an emphasis on this in one of his <br>
tutorials I saw somewhere a while back. (If you can find what I&#x27;m <br>
talking about, I highly recommend studing that.)<br>
<br>
During my very last turn of &quot;solving-3-cross-pieces-relative-to-each-<br>
other (if I can&#x27;t do all 4 together)&quot; I will &quot;sneak in&quot; a turn (if <br>
necessary) so that the final cross piece is in the middle layer if <br>
it was originally flipped. *Think about what I mean by this (it&#x27;s <br>
hard to explain things in text).* Then it&#x27;s 1 or 2 turns to finish, <br>
and perhaps 1 more turn to adjust the cross layer so they line up <br>
with the centers.<br>
<br>
Now, this is where I want to point out something that most novice <br>
and some advanced cubers will constantly negelct, rarely ever <br>
contemplate it... LOOK FOR SLANT PAIRS! Before linking the cross up <br>
with the centers it&#x27;s possible to sneak in a &quot;slant pairing&quot;.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I just do all of them *slant*, and it&#x27;s more efficent that <br>
way. I probably use the technique of slant-ZbF2L more than any other <br>
cuber, so I&#x27;m very used to it and a big advocator ot it. However, <br>
etremely fast cubers NEVER do any slant F2L stuff (Jessica F. comes <br>
to mind).<br>
<br>
Sometimes I even re-slant, but it can be a hassle so don&#x27;t do it <br>
more than once.<br>
<br>
Instead of excersizing the &quot;closing your eyes&quot; approach. Try <br>
minimizing turns! In almost every single case, it is possible to <br>
solve a cross in 7 turns or less (FTM/HTM). (108 out of however many <br>
quintillion that absolutely require 8 FTM turns in fact.) Think <br>
about that....<br>

I have a hard time with simplified chinese, I think the traditional 
characters look much more artistic.

My Manderin is a little rusty too, plus they where speaking rather 
fast. Luckily it is subtitled! I&#x27;m quite fluent in Cantonese, btw. I 
can tell that it is set in Taiwan though.

Anyways, I am really bored and might post a full translation of this

go visit Jon. (What do you think?)

solving &quot;unmatched pairs&quot; into slots with the cross off so they are 
solved when the cross is put in place. I think Jason Thong had 
something on that on his site but he called it multislotting which is 
a term that already means something else. I like the term &quot;slant 
pairing&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">Tools required:  A dremel and razor blade and a phillips screwdriver.  

Disassemble the rubik&#x27;s cube.
Slide the Razor blade under the cap, and use the leverage, and push 
down on the blade like a fulcrum.  Repeat 5 more times to remove all 6 
caps.
Use a dremel and a bit to create a &quot;x&quot; in all 6 rivets.  Be accurate so 
that your phillips screwdriver will fit tightly into the engravement.
Adjust the tension of the Rivets that you just converted into screws as 
needed.
Apply the caps putting a layer of paper underneath as a spacer to hold 
the caps in place.  They may pop, just put them back in when they do 
so.  To avoid this, do not slam or drop the cube.
Since you are doing this to a 2005 model.  Makesure to visit 
cubesmith.com and buy yourself some nice stickers!!!

Did you actually succeed in doing that or is this just an idea? 
Wouldn&#x27;t work with the type of rivet I know (which doesn&#x27;t have a 
spiral thread but only rings).

conclusion is that getting a sub-15 average will probably require some<br>

So I&#x27;ve used ACube to find fast algorithms for all LL cases on the<br>
Domino, for two different styles of solving:<br>
<br>
1) Solve with a 3x3 side on top. There are 21 standard PLL cases and<br>
20 PLL cases with parity.<br>
2) Solve with a 2x3 side on top (so you use Roux blocks). There are 16<br>
LL cases.<br>

Would anyone be interested enough in Domino speedsolving to learn last<br>

          <div class="email-content">I am having similar problems with a cube removing the center piece,<br>
however I am wondering if it is worth the trouble. How big of a<br>
difference is there between a lubed cube and a non-lubed cube? I am<br>
thinking of simply popping out one of the pieces and squeezing some<br>
lube in there instead of going through the hassle of popping the<br>
center piece to loosen the tension on the springs. <br>
<br>
I also have another DIY cube I ordered from rubiks.com. I seem to have<br>
a lot of trouble with DIY cubes. I find that I absolutely Must tighten<br>
the screws all the way, otherwise the cube will be too loose and will<br>
fall apart with every turn I make. Currently, I have not lubed this<br>
cube and am wondering how big of a difference it would make. (After<br>
all, this is really the only option I have of &#x27;loosening&#x27; the cube,<br>
since I mentioned earlier that loosening the screws even by a moderate<br>
amount make the entire cube extremely loose and very prone to popping.)<br>

Guys, I&#x27;m sure he meant the cuber has to perform the bld solve to 
prove it. (Although there should probably be a pre-set time limit to 
this part, say 5 minute...?)

Anyways..., I like it! Although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d suck at it.

On a related note..., anyone try speedblindfold for big cubes yet?

          <div class="email-content">standard answer: look at Hardwick&#x27;s 4x4 pages, then look at 
bigcubes.com, then look at Hardwick&#x27;s advanced 4x4 pages.

Aside form that, how well does it turn? have you tried to lubricate 
it? How fast are you at 3x3? it shouldn&#x27;t take a cuber more than that 
time +10s to do the segmented-solve on a 4x4 or 5x5. (At least that&#x27;s 
my rule-of-thumb.)

The learning curve for big cubes is even worst that for the 3x3, jsut 
to warn ya. There are just so many more variations and techniques one 
can learn.

It is always great news to hear that cubing is in the media again.
However, it used to be that various media things would be stashed 
somewhere on the internet for us to grab. I really pride myself on 
my collection of cubing in the media clips and have noticed a huge 
decline in people archiving such things.

I used to hope to collect every single piece of cube-in-media clips 
in the last 10 yrs... having things on youTube for a short while is 
no good. grrr...

Anyhow, two things I would really like to have: a clip of DanK on 
the Ellen D. show, and a clip of Will S. on Oprah.

Also I want to take this opportunity to point out some new cube 
sightings I made! Episode 1x21 of &quot;Angel&quot; features a cube and 
Pyraminx. There is also one episode of &quot;Buffy&quot; that has a cube on 
one of the character&#x27;s nightstands (impling they cube). I forgot 
which one, and wonder if someone here knows.

I have yet to watch &quot;Happyness&quot;... :(. But for those of you who 
have, how many scenes is there a cube? Just the one? (I hope not!)

          <div class="email-content">We would very much like to encourage newer cubers to post more 
often. There is nothing to be afraid of..., we won&#x27;t bite! (Well it 
seems Clancy might o_O.)

Ask questions, even stupid ones (although a lot of them, so that we 
can pick something that isn&#x27;t too silly to answer, lol). It&#x27;s how we 
all get better at cubing (okay so practice is the key, but still...).

Also, even if you are not spectacular, I&#x27;d encourage you to come to 
a competition sometime. Meeting cubers faster than you is a great 
way to get more motivated about cubing. And we want our community to 
grow.

With so many tourns. these days, if you haven&#x27;t been to one than I 
don&#x27;t consider you to be truly part of the cubing community...

          <div class="email-content">I have always used the term &quot;slant pairs&quot;. Plus I feel I&#x27;ve been 
cubing long enough to deserve to coin terminology. However, I do like 
the term &quot;unmatched pairs&quot;... it sounds much more technical and I&#x27;d be 
willing to adopt it.

I guess I just haven&#x27;t heard either of those terms used frequently 
enough to make a firm decision. I think it&#x27;s becasue it&#x27;s just not 
very popular. It seems to me that many of the fastest cubers simply 
don&#x27;t use it at all. It avoids having to deal with complex issues such 
as having the number of corners and edges done to be out of sync, 
and/or having to &quot;re-slant&quot;. (Would you say &quot;re-unmatch&quot;??? Hem, okay 
so maybe my term does have one advantage after all.)

Anyways, thanks for the compliment!

          <div class="email-content">Ya, I wonder why that is. There must be some scientific explaination 
for it. Orange always lasts the shortest, followed by green, and then 
blue, and then red and yellow. (okay so I&#x27;m guesstimateing, can 
someone else post what they think the order really is, thus confirming 
there is an order to it, or that is independent of cubing style)

I highly recommend cubesmith as well. Short of that, cutting out your 
own sticers out of colored electrical tape used to be my prefernce. It 
still yields a great effect if one is willing to put in *that* much 
time.

Me on the other hand, I&#x27;ve been cubing pretty long and grew tired of 
stickers peeling on me. Thus, to avoid it completely, I always peel 
off all the stickers whenever I take a cube out of the box and then de-
gunkify it. At this point I wait till i have time to do a 
proper &quot;prepping&quot; and before re-stickering.

Oh, and for peeling off the stickers I recomend getting one of those 
plastic razors (they can be found on cubesmith, but possibly other 
places too, &quot;Scrape Rite&quot; is what it&#x27;s called). Those things have made 
de-stickering very fast and even fun! (Try one in each hand or two in 
one hands and time yourself.... I know someone here is going to... :) )

          <div class="email-content">First off in response to the original post:
Holy ****!, I didn&#x27;t know it was possible. That sounds really cool.

Stefan is probably right though, those rivets aren&#x27;t threaded the 
usual way. Turning one this way might still loosen things up though 
I could imagine.

Personally, I still perfer the non-DIY over DIY for my main 
speedcubes.

Now when it comes to removing the center caps, The method he 
described should work pretty well in theory. A few details that 
should have been pointed out though... Understand the geometry of 
the center caps. You certainly don&#x27;t want to slice the center cap 
straight off, the cap is what is technically known as a shallow (or 
stub) tenon. It&#x27;s a &quot;mortise and tenon joint&quot;, and the cap-side is a 
bit rounded (a fillet) while the mortise is squared off. Knowning 
these things and how deep the joint is can help with *AVOIDING 
INJURIES*. On a DIY cube, the caps already have tiny spacers built-
in so that it is not terribly hard to get a razor blade in.

Oh and I must stress this: *cut away from your body* (and other 
bodies). *I&#x27;ve hurt myself a lot doing things like changing tiles on 
a Meffert&#x27;s assembly cube so I know a thing or two about this stuff.)

If nothing else works, try going at it from the corner and levering 
it there (that part has more area so you get more mechanical 
advatage). Trry different corners of it too. They are usually placed 
with 2 small drops of glue on opposite sides...

I&#x27;d say that the over-hang is about 2mm and the depth of it is about 
1.5mm. It&#x27;s best to familiarize yourself with a stand-alone center 
cap or DIY kit before attempting this.

Hem, having said all that... is it really worth doing? I say *no*.

Loose cubes generally can&#x27;t be tightened (unless there&#x27;re actual 
screws), and tight cubes loosen very quickly after a couple weeks of 
rigorious cubing, which I believe is desireable in order for a cube 
to &quot;learn&quot; your cubing style and be well suited for a cuber.

Out of the box, I&#x27;ve never run into a cube that was &quot;too loose&quot; 
or &quot;too tight&quot; for me to toss. On the other hand, with most of the 
DIY cubes I have put together I have the constant urge to trash them 
or give them away. As they seem to lock-up more often than pre-
assembled cubes for me for some reason. (Any one else feel the same 
way?)

I even go through the trouble of lubing the springs and using 1 or 2 
washers per axle (got the idea from Stefan).

On a not-so-related note, I am starting to hate the embossed Rubik&#x27;s 
logo that is always on one of the caps nowadays.

I think that the store bought cubes have dwindled in quality over 
the past few years. If you can, I do (now) recommend DIY over those. 
In turn, I recommend 25th anniversary cubes over DIY. Unfortunately 
they are not usually found in stores [in the Us]. If you want a good 
cube you are just gonna have to spend the time hunting around. Oh, 
and BTW never buy a cube off Amazon (I had a really bad expereince 
once).

In the end, it&#x27;s all about how much time you are willing to spend, 
choosing and prepping a new cube.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m kind of in the same boat. I&#x27;ve been cubing for about 5 months too.
After starting fridrich about two or three months ago my times got
faster. I&#x27;m now at about 40 for an average and I sometimes get times
individual times in the 20s. Since I am still thinking a lot when I
solve, I know I can cut another ten seconds or so within a couple of
more months of practice. 

I know I am a novice so my advice isn&#x27;t worth anything, but here are a
couple of things that come to my mind:

1) Progress in steps. Start with a four-look for a while, then go to a
three-look when you are not making any mistakes. Then last go to a
two-look after you perfect your OLLs. In other words, first learn easy
PLLs and use them for a while before moving on to the harder ones and
save the OLLs for later. You can slowly add OLLs as you see the need.
It took me a full-month to memorize all of the ALGs for OLL and their
inverses.

2) When doing F2L, learn the pairs at first by really trying to
understand the ALGs. It is not important to do them quickly. In fact,
it is probably best to do them extremely slowly and note how all of
the pieces moves in relation to each other. This will be important
later. Start with &quot;easy&quot; ones first and slowly move on to the more
difficult ones, such as pairs that are out of place or stuck in the
wrong slots, after you really know them with your both your fingers
and your mind. You should know what the move will feel like before you
even attempt the ALG. So in other words, don&#x27;t practice for speed,
practice for perfection. 

3) Create your on system for learning ALGs. Some people really have a
difficult time memorizing the notation as is. Of course learning the
notation is important to get a lot of the ALGs on the net, but you may
be able to make your own system that works for you better. For
example, some people who learn better through music or sound may want
to learn the &quot;sound&quot; of the ALGs. I have two meanings by this. One,
all of your finger tricks have a unique rhythm and sound, so the
combination of moves will sound a certain way. You can then practice
to a metronome trying to get the rhythm faster and faster. Second, you
can rename the notation into consonant and vowel combinations. For
example, a &quot;R&quot; turn can be called &quot;TA,&quot; a &quot;U&quot; turn can be called &quot;BA,&quot;
and a &quot;R&quot; can be called &quot;TE.&quot; Thus a &quot;RUR&#x27;&quot; can be renamed &quot;TABATE,&quot; a
new word you can memorize easily and sing along as you are cubing!!

I know this is probably not the answer you were looking for and I am
in no position to make any advice, but I know exactly what you are
talking about!!!

To a sub-20
Cheers!!!

<br>
Of course it does! That&#x27;s one of the 20 algorithms with parity.<br>
<br>
Here are some longer ones (I try to use RULDM only, because it&#x27;s fast<br>
for me):<br>
R2 D&#x27; L2 U&#x27; L2 D&#x27; L2 U&#x27; L2 D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; swaps UF and UR edges.<br>
U R2 U&#x27; R2 y&#x27; M2 D L2 D&#x27; L2 D&#x27; R2 D R2 U&#x27; R2 x2 swaps UBL and UFR corners.<br>
y&#x27; R2 U R2 U&#x27; R2 D R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 swaps UFR and ULF<br>

<br>
You could say &#x27;tons&#x27;... I usually got about 50-100 optimal algorithms<br>
when I searched, so I guess you have a lot of stuff to choose from. On<br>
the other hand, the optimal algorithms can be pretty long, and all the<br>
180-degree turns are slow.<br>
<br>
&gt; On second thought, I think I&#x27;d go with a CF method. What do you guys <br>
&gt; think?<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s a pretty good idea, actually, except that you wouldn&#x27;t be able<br>
to do the edges in one algorithm. On the other hand, if you sort the<br>
edges, you can do edge permutation on each layer separately, and the<br>
algorithms for that are 12 moves or less.<br>
<br>
&gt; Okay I really want a domino now!<br>
<br>
Me too. I usually emulate on a 3x3x3 (ignore middle layer) or 4x4x4.<br>
If I ever decide to seriously speedcube it, I&#x27;ll have to get or make a<br>
real one.<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t decided whether it&#x27;s faster to have a numbered or colored<br>

of &quot;Cheers!!!&quot; o_O.

3) Both of you are progressing nicely. Many of the cubers here have 
been around for 4 years to be getting as fast/good as we are. There 
are even a few old-school from the early 80&#x27;s still around. True, 
there are a few exceptional cubers out there that can master things 
after only a year or two of cubing (and at this rate you can still 
be one of them), but don&#x27;t put unnessecary pressure on yourselves to 
get fast. When I started cubing, I didn&#x27;t focus on speed, and opted 
to focus on &quot;understanding&quot;. In the long run if you just blindly 
focus on speed then you&#x27;d be missing out on all the coolness that is 
hidden deep in the cube. Although, I should also point out there are 
tons of sub-20 cubers out there that have a lot to learn still....

Cube for the journey, not the destination. :)

4) The second person&#x27;s response should answer all your questions (oh 
and btw, it makes it easier for ppl to answer all your questions if 
you punctuate better, I like to do a &quot;find&quot; on the ?&#x27;s)

5) Working on F2L and PLLs at the same time should be enough to keep 
you occupied. Just focusing on just one or the other may lead to an 
early on-set of boredom. There are really only 13 PLLs and those are 
important to learn (heck, even if you don&#x27;t plan on being pure-
Fridrich like me - actually I&#x27;m far from it). The order of those and 
c/e-pairing algs does make a difference.

Start off with the shorter F2L algs. &lt;This is where I&#x27;m too lazy to 
suggest an order for it, so let&#x27;s just pretend I did and/or wait 
till someone else does.> And for PLL, learn the 3-edge cycles and 3-
corner cycles first. I would learn the slice version first and go 
back to a 2-gen after halfway though OLLs. I am refering to the 
following: (R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2) and its F&lt;->B mirror for edges 
and then (x R&#x27; U R&#x27; D2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R2&#x27; x&#x27;) and it&#x27;s inverse.

Oh, and DO know your notation, I don&#x27;t quite agree with the second 
post on that point. I think that beginners NEED to KNOW and USE the 
standard notation that we as a community have adopted. It&#x27;s the 
freakin&#x27; language! It&#x27;s like moving to France and not planning on 
learning French. Don&#x27;t make your own system... (if you feel up to it 
extend the notation slightly sure, have some fun with it). Using 
mnemonics and stuff might prove helpful, but I would consider that 
notation. Also don&#x27;t focus too hard on the &quot;sound&quot; of an alg. That 
sound will gradually change as you get faster and perfect your 
cubing-style anyways. It&#x27;s something that will seep into your 
subconscious for sure. (BTW, fun game to play at a cube gathering is 
to bld ppl and have them figure out which alg you are perfoming 
using their ears only...)

So getting back to the point. Learn the Z-Perm, yes I said &quot;the&quot;, I 
don&#x27;t like to use unqualified wording much, but in this case there 
is really just one alg that like 95% of cubers use for it and it&#x27;s a 
really fun alg to coast with, as is the T-Perm. It&#x27;s much easier to 
have a cuber there to teach a beginner the Z-Perm, since it probably 
takes 20 times longer to learn it on your own. Learn an H-Perm/+Perm 
while you are at it. After T, do Y. Then finish off all the ones 
that are in the parity group (N,J/L,F,R) but also stick E-Perm in 
there too. This saves the G-Perm for last and that one has 4 
distinct appearences so it&#x27;s harder to do regonition for but there 
is a trick for that...

Okay so hopefully the two of you are at least half way done with PLL 
anyways and most of that was useless info.

Before learning more than say 5 OLLs, master F2L.

I&#x27;ve been cubing for years and still don&#x27;t know about 1/3 of the 
OLL. (I use a slightly different method actually and so I don&#x27;t 
really need them.) But even Fridrich followers can get to averaging 
17s knowing as much as I know about OLL and PLL I&#x27;m sure (given 
detexterity of course). Try to learn those in order of alg length 
too, for this I recommend Bob&#x27;s site he has them laid out pretty 
well.

Well at the point where you start learning say 1/4 of OLL, spend 
some serious time forcing yourself to be more active and optimal 
with the cross step. This is typically neglected and cubers that are 
fast (that know that they can make up the time elsewhere) will be 
chronically lazy on that step.

Target getting to 13s average on F2L including cross. To expedite 
this, you can exclusivle do F2L solves for a sitting. After this 
point is where I htink you have to master OLL (or do something 
equivalently or more advanced/useful).

I just did a 29.xx solve using Fridrich, with 2-look OLL. So it&#x27;s 
totally possible. (Next one was 30.78.) Okay I&#x27;m actually quite bad 
at this, but it is accepted that averaging sub-25 is a realistic 
goal using pure-Fridrich but with 2-look OLL.

5) You learned all of OLL in just 1 month! That must have been 
rigourous. I would have recommened stretching that out further to 
maybe 2 months with periods of &quot;consolidation&quot;. Reminds me of how 
ChrisH learned all of ZBF2L in just 1 intensive month, but that is 
probably 3-4 times harder. But he didn&#x27;t retain it...., so what does 
that tell you about learning things too fast?

I&#x27;m taking my time learning new algs. I learn a new alg (and it&#x27;s 
inverse and mirrors) once a week. It does get easier though...well 
after it gets much harder.

6) In regards to the later remarks on the first post, memory really 
doesn&#x27;t have much to do with speedcubing (at least not anywhere near 
the beginner level). It&#x27;s more about intuition, I hold. Think about 
it... all you really have to memorize straight are the 13 PLLs. c/e-
pairing algs can be learned intuitively for sure. Cheat a little and 
refernce sites for the more awkward ones. But after studing (yes 
cubing requires *studing*... I mean how else are you going to get 
your cubing-diploma? o_O), ya after studing a new F2L alg for a 
while you should be able to understand it well enough that it&#x27;s not 
counted as memorization. Okay I conceed that there are a few (just a 
few really) that are best left memorized dead. The one I use for the 
case when &quot;the corner is in and good and the edge is in but flipped&quot; 
I did executed blindly for the longest time. Also there is the 
related one where the corner is instead twisted in place. I also 
never used the alg (R2 U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R2) (inverse to setup) for the 
longest time and the one I used instead was memorized.

Here&#x27;s a brief description of what you should be doing while 
learning an F2L alg:
I&#x27;ll pick as an example,
R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U2 F
(inverse to setup). BTW, I feel that the proper way to write an alg 
is on a line by itself either single-spaced or no-spaces like that. 
It&#x27;s a very common thing to say &quot;inverse to setup&quot;. Do do that; it&#x27;s 
a helpful studing technique. This of course requires you to 
practice &quot;reading an alg backwards&quot;. The skill is very important as 
well as reading an alg mirrored and even the combinations of the two 
whenever needed.

I quickly got to the point where I can not only mirror algs on-the-
fly (and every cuber should be able to do this), but to be able to 
inverse algs on-the-fly, which is much less mastered ability among 
cubers. It comes in handy... Doens&#x27;t come up a lot for Fridrich 
users is why they don&#x27;t generally care. I studied inversing a lot 
for a CLL alg set, which is something more advanced (in a way, I 
know... grumble, grumble...).

So start with disecting the alg. Actually, start with picking the 
alg that best suits your cubing style (but after only 5 months of 
cubing you guys shouldn&#x27;t really have a cubing-style to speak of). 
Being able to disect them is needed for the selection process 
though...

I look at
R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U2 F
and look for things of the form (X Y* X&#x27;) or (X&#x27; Y* X), where it is 
better if the * is not a 2. And I do &quot;grouping&quot; or &quot;locating the 
triggers&quot;
(F&#x27; U2 F) looks good and (R U&#x27; R&#x27;) looks even better. Thus the alg 
should be
(R U&#x27; R&#x27;) (F&#x27; U2 F)
the parentheses are actaully a part of our standard notation scheme 
to denote the triggering [possiblities &lt;since some expereienced 
people may opt to deviate at their discresion>].

Learn stand-alone TRIGGERS. In fact, almost all of them are getting 
names soon I hope! (I&#x27;d like to extend the core teamBLD callings for 
them.) Practice things like (R U&#x27; R&#x27;) like a thousand times! I like 
to call it &quot;kick right&quot;. Fingering is very important to get right. 
If done right that trigger can be done under 0.50s comfortably. Oh 
and do time yourself doing 10 back-to-back executions of this and 
moving the decimal point to get an accurate timing.

Come up with quirky names for triggers and algs yourself, it&#x27;s 
really fun (esp. with other cubers) and helps with the learning 
process. Making flash cards like people often do for learning a 
foreign language helps too, but that requires a greater measure of 
dedication.

The second part of that alg is a fast trigger too, plus it connects 
well together. I recommend watching videos of these algs, I&#x27;m sure 
thre are at least 3 sites that showcase individual videos of all the 
algs you need to learn (typically a &quot;slow&quot; version along with 
a &quot;fast&quot; version).

p.s. I just realized I used the term &quot;parity group,&quot; but that&#x27;s not 
a group in the mathematical sence.... I couldn&#x27;t find an adequate 
definition so that it would be; I&#x27;m such a dork.

 Did you actually succeed in doing that or is this just an idea? 
 Wouldn&#x27;t work with the type of rivet I know (which doesn&#x27;t have a

I can&#x27;t. And I&#x27;m still not convinced about &quot;turning it into a screw&quot;

Sure? I admit I haven&#x27;t tried it (since I didn&#x27;t have a loose cube 
and didn&#x27;t want to waste a good one) but here&#x27;s how the rivets looked 
that I got with a DIY a while ago, looks to me like you should be

  What a year was 2006 for my son Bernett! I take this day to thank all those who inspired my young son. He had performed in 5 television channels, 33 public performances in varoius schools, colleges, public places etc, one championship - Dutch Open Championship-2006. <br>
  His school has given him free education for this year, our honourable president Dr.A.P.J.Abdul Kalam honoured him, Dalmia Cement Ltd honoured him for his performance in Dutch open-2006, Reached TOP-3 of Pogo Amazing kids award 2006, Maths genius shakuntala Devi praised his cubing and memorising skill etc<br>
  Recently, when he was interviewed by a local tamil magazine he answered as follows for some of the questions.<br>
  1.What is the turning point in your life ? - Every cuber who inspired me is a turning point. Ron and Stefan are the main motivators for me. Moreover my dad who listens to me very patiently and answers my every question is a big boost for me. <br>
  &quot;Our honourable president Dr.Abdul Kalam said the different coloured each piece in a scrambled cube is a problem in one&#x27;s life. How swiftly you are solving the cube. The same way you will solve the problems of life also.&quot; I am greatly inspired by him. He spoke to me so softly.<br>
   <br>
  2.What is your ambition ? - I am interested in computer field right now. I do not know, if my priority changes when I grow up.<br>
   <br>
  3.Why are you cubing ?- It is fun always. Now, it has given me so many friends.<br>
   <br>
  4. Who is your best friend ? - All my classmates &amp; my teachers. But my dad is my best.<br>
     <br>
              The interviewer told me, &quot; sir, I think you are the reason for Bernett&#x27;s wonderful performance because you listen to him and gives him what he wants and appreciates him&quot;. He also told me he got a message for parents, ie, &quot; if you want your kids to do well, then listen to them, motivate them and give them more opportunity&quot;. <br>
              But, you all know, I do not know much in cubing. God has given him the ability &amp; you all cubers had been the source of inspiration. Let me salute  and thank you all for what all you have done for Bernett. Hope you will continue to do the same in 2007 also.<br>
              Let us meet in Budapest.<br>
  Wishing you all a happy new year.<br>

yea thats right. I like the cross on the left side because you mostly
use R and U. the problem is that I have to turn R or l alot in order
to setup the algorithm. i dont really have a problem with the looking
ahead

How is that even a domino alg? Shouldn&#x27;t some of the turns be 180s? I <br>
tried it on my 3x3 and all it did was twist 6 of the corners in place <br>
and muck up the edges...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Those have been dis-continued (at least in the states) for about 10 
years now. They have become quite hard to find. I think your best 
bet to finding a sq-1 is to use e-bay unfortunately.

I have gotten 2 of them in my life, bought at a toy store around 
1993. I lost one and I turned on into a speedcube. *Looks at my 
speed-sq1 with pride* It does haunt me a bit that I can&#x27;t solve a 
sq1 on my own... I can get to a cube shape after lots of random 
turning and then solving corners would be the same as doing them on 
say a rubik&#x27;s domino or 2x2x3. I could then get most of the edges in 
intuitively. I can preceed further using commutators. If I see 
parity I&#x27;m screwed.

Does anyone have a very short or easy to memorize parity alg for 
sq1? It can mess up every single piece as long as it gets me back to 
cube shape...

          <div class="email-content">The mechanism of the domino doesn&#x27;t seem to lend itself very well to<br>
speed-cubing. When I got the puzzle, it got stuck on some turns. It turned<br>
out that one of the pieces was cracked inside. So I took it apart and stuck<br>
a piece of wood inside to hold it in place. It has worked ever since, but<br>
sometimes it sticks and you have to kind of work around it.<br>
<br>
The one I got was a Christmas version of the domino. It was red on one side<br>
and white on the other. One side had Santa Clause and the other Christmas<br>
bells. In a way I like that better because an unsolved picture is more<br>
quickly noticable than just dominos being out of order.<br>
<br>
It would be quite adequate just to have a 3*3*2 with six colored faces like<br>
the cube does, even if you lose the mater of center orientation. Correct me<br>
if I&#x27;m wrong, but doesn&#x27;t the five fall in the center square of the domino<br>
puzzle? If it looks like it does on a die, the center orientation doesn&#x27;t<br>
matter anyway.<br>
