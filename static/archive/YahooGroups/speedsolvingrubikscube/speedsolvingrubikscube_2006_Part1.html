        Mmhh... I think clock is a bit different. Yes, it does take longer to
        scramble than to solve. But, scrambling a clock is fairly easy and not
        that slow after you've done it a few times. And it's easier if you know
        how to solve the clock. Scrambling megaminx with the scramble algs gives
        even *me* a headache and takes me 3 minutes or so for the 60 moves.
        That's why for practice I prefer doing 100 "humanrandom" moves, taking
        me 40 seconds. Also, in case the clock scrambler made a mistake, there
        are many people who can just solve it in a short time for a new
        scrambling attempt. Megaminx takes *everybody* a long time and Square-1
        takes *almost* everybody a long time. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Well I managed to learn all of PLL (with finger tricks) by the end of
        the year. I only started learning Fridrich after WC05-- I was using
        corners-first then. Seeing all the CFOP-style solves in person convinced

        Hi, new here, but been speedcubing a year or so. I did the following
        guide originally while learning Guimond's method. It is basically a
        clarified edition, with some added algorithms and some left away. I
        haven't gone through all mostly optimized solutions from the french
        version of his guide yet. I hope this helps those who are having hard
        time learning this particular method. After I get sub-30 sec with this I
        propably start learning ZB-method. Very attractive due to its 40 move
        average count. http://www.zborowski.republika.pl/expert3x3x3method.html
        Attached is the guide itself in a text format. Anyone with cubing sites
        may publish, add to it and transform to whatever formats necessary. ie.
        with visuals etc if needed. Original guide is located at
        http://www.rubikscuberecord.com For those who don't know, Guimond's
        method is perhaps one of the easiest and fastest way to learn to solve
        rubik's cube, while getting pretty easy under 1 minutes. And only a
        handful of algorithms to remember too. Here's the link to the textfile

        Thats a good time for a beginners method. You should try and learn
        finger tricks so that you can turn the sides faster. I suggest you learn
        that too. Good luck learning petrus! Peter Greenwood --- In

        Thanks. My best time is 57 seconds, so not much faster than that. Even
        with finger tricks and faster recognition, without more algorythms I am
        very close to the limits of this system. I am eager to learn Petrus and
        can get the 2x2x2 block in a horrid 30 seconds. Can anyone tell me what
        times are possible using the Petrus method? I know Mr. Petrus can get
        sub 20 but he has been at it for years. I hope to get sub 50 seconds
        within a month. Is that reasonable?

        &gt; I just went to a local hardware store (I think it's called town and

        but the catch was they are waaay longer than i needed them to be, so I
        had to cut them down, I also bought 24 nylon washers yet I only ended up
        using 12. I was able to change out three megaminx springs to every
        spring that i bought. the whole process of cutting the springs and
        changing them took about 2 hours total, but it was worth it, my megaminx
        works sooo much better. Thanks guys! ~John~

        I must say that sub-1 minute average for 4*4*4 as quite ambitious, but
        that's how it should be. My prime goal is to get a sub-15 average for
        3*3*3 and a sub-30 average for one-handed solving. I also hope to be
        among the finalists at the European championships. We are a couple of
        Swedes that are practicing 2*2*2 quite hard now and I will try to learn
        the 2-step solution where you first orient one sida and then fix the
        rest. I guess we will see a lot of amazing achievement during 2006. Here
        are some of my guesses: sub-13 average for 3*3*3 A LOT of sub-15
        averages. sub-1 minute average for 4*4*4 /Gunnar -- In

        I disagree too...you use a working corner to do the F2L, don't you? I
        didn't understand your LL, but I think you can be fast with a 3-look LL:
        orient edges (or corners), orient corners (or edges), permute all...Joël

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did you also try the M2 trick for the H
        permutation? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes of course. But there I haven't
        decided yet whether I like Bob's or &gt; &gt; your way better. What
        annoys me about this alg is that I'm not able to &gt; &gt; do the U2
        nicely, usually I do that in one motion with my right index &gt; &gt;
        finger, but that doesn't fit in here for me. And I need my right &gt;
        &gt; middle finger for holding the cube, so I can't do index+middle.
        &gt; &gt; Instead, I do U twice with index finger. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The four-edge-flip alg is now one of my favourite algs. It feels very
        &gt; &gt; nice, and the best thing is that both at start and end, I have
        the &gt; &gt; standard grip. And I both start and end with r'. So I can
        do it &gt; &gt; endlessly without stop, and I did that (repeating the
        alg for maybe 15 &gt; &gt; minutes) last night. I also did it while
        reading some new posts, and &gt; &gt; sometimes when I looked back at
        the cube I thought "oh damn you made a &gt; &gt; mistake" but then a
        moment later my hands had restored it again. Well, &gt; &gt; of course I
        only saw it *pass* the solved state, cause my hands don't &gt; &gt; know
        when to break (since there's no stop between two executions). It &gt;
        &gt; feels so natural... it's like I'm just holding the cube and wiggle
        L &gt; &gt; and R a bit back and forth, just throwing in some index
        finger pulling &gt; &gt; at times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt;

        Hi Stefan! Time ago I ordered some nice 2milimeter washers from Skiffy
        website, a web you recommended. I recommend this washers too. But, where
        do you buy the springs? which is the website? and the spring
        characteristics/requirements? It is hard to find in stores here in
        Spain... Alberto. ----- Original Message ----- From: Stefan Pochmann To:

        scratch the washers away. It certainly &gt; isn't as clean as if i had
        gotten springs that we're actually cut to &gt; the correct length by the
        manufacturer. Did you order your springs &gt; online or through the mail
        or did you buy them at a store? Ah, ok... 0.60 for 8 springs would've
        been a super deal. I ordered mine through the manufacturer's website. No
        chance to get good springs for a good price in a store, at least that's
        my experience. Cheers! Stefan

        Yes, thats correct. Its about as fast as my alg, which is about 3.5-4

        Water will be absorbed into the magic no matter how tight it is. This
        happened to me once. Luckily the inserts were custom and i just replaced

        The 18.5 moves is from Ryan Heises F2l strategy I think. I've been
        messing around with his F2l method, and I'd say a more reasonable goal
        for speedcubing would be 20-23 moves, which is still much less, but much
        slower recognition than f2l pairs. -James Stuber _____ From:

        Did you also try the M2 trick for the H permutation? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Yes of course. But there I haven't decided yet whether I like
        &gt; Bob's or &gt; &gt; &gt; your way better. What annoys me about this
        alg is that I'm not &gt; able to &gt; &gt; &gt; do the U2 nicely,
        usually I do that in one motion with my right &gt; index &gt; &gt; &gt;
        finger, but that doesn't fit in here for me. And I need my right &gt;
        &gt; &gt; middle finger for holding the cube, so I can't do
        index+middle. &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, I do U twice with index finger.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The four-edge-flip alg is now one of my
        favourite algs. It feels &gt; very &gt; &gt; &gt; nice, and the best
        thing is that both at start and end, I have &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        standard grip. And I both start and end with r'. So I can do it &gt;
        &gt; &gt; endlessly without stop, and I did that (repeating the alg for
        &gt; maybe 15 &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes) last night. I also did it while
        reading some new posts, &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes when I looked
        back at the cube I thought "oh damn you &gt; made a &gt; &gt; &gt;
        mistake" but then a moment later my hands had restored it again. &gt;
        Well, &gt; &gt; &gt; of course I only saw it *pass* the solved state,
        cause my hands &gt; don't &gt; &gt; &gt; know when to break (since
        there's no stop between two &gt; executions). It &gt; &gt; &gt; feels so
        natural... it's like I'm just holding the cube and &gt; wiggle L &gt;
        &gt; &gt; and R a bit back and forth, just throwing in some index finger
        &gt; pulling &gt; &gt; &gt; at times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        have practiced it for (only) 7 months. I know it's possible to average
        sub 15 with this method, and that's in fact my goal before 2007. That
        will, of course, require very much intuition and practice, but I know
        it's possible. So, the Petrus method is a really fast speedcubing
        method, and I believe it's at least as good as Fridrich. It's a pity
        that so few people use it. I'm sure you'll be able to do sub 50 within a
        month, it's not hard at all. I don't remember exactly how fast I
        improved, but I remember that it took me 1-2 months to average 45
        seconds. - Johannes

        megaminx a couple days ago, a Meffert's &gt; 12-color tiled megaminx
        that I ordered online. The problem is if you &gt; turn one of the sides
        counter clockwise about 6 or 7 complete &gt; rotations, it gets looser
        and looser and just pops off. &gt; &gt; This does not happen with the
        other 11 sides. I am new to megaminxs' &gt; and I just want to know is
        this normal, or did I buy a broken puzzle? That's semi-normal. The
        springs are too long and strong. Usually this only makes the puzzle
        extremely stiff, but in some cases the pressure together with the
        non-ground spring ends and rotations combine and screw out the screw.
        See other Megaminx thread from the last 2-3 days. Cheers! Stefan

        Finally a challenger from Finland! &gt; My best time with the Petrus
        method is 11.91 seconds and my best &gt; average of 10 is 19.46. I have
        practiced it for (only) 7 months. I &gt; know it's possible to average
        sub 15 with this method, and that's in &gt; fact my goal before 2007.
        That will, of course, require very much &gt; intuition and practice, but
        I know it's possible. So, the Petrus &gt; method is a really fast
        speedcubing method, and I believe it's at &gt; least as good as
        Fridrich. It's a pity that so few people use it. &gt; &gt; I'm sure
        you'll be able to do sub 50 within a month, it's not hard at &gt; all. I
        don't remember exactly how fast I improved, but I remember that &gt; it
        took me 1-2 months to average 45 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; - &gt; Johannes

        the exact washers are this:

        I can see they are not as small as I stated. The page says : outside
        diameter 6, inside diameter 3.2, thick 0.8. Really, between 2 and 3 mm
        of metal, oustide minus inside diameter. I have always 'thought' they
        were (it is better to say 'called') 2mm or so because when I bought '3mm
        wahers' in a store, they selled me bigger washers than the ones I bought
        by web. So, it is probably (and surely) a defect on me. Be sure the
        washers are the linked here above. Alberto. ----- Original Message -----

        M in e.g. M3 = Metric. The 3 (when talking about screws) stands for 3 mm

        I use Firefox and for whatever reason the cubes on lar5.com don't show
        up. However I also find it frustrating to try and figure an algorithm
        out by following a java cube rather than standard notation (e.g. F, R',
        U' etc.). Is there a place where the Petrus method is documented using
        standard notation or is it something I have to learn from the animated
        cubes? I read that the method is something I can work up to as a
        beginner (again, using the Jasmine Lee solution set right now with Sune
        and Anti-Sune for my corner permutation) to get my cubing faster,
        perhaps a bit easier to learn than Fridrich (ack, 100's of possible
        algorithms). p.s. Just downloaded cube twister last night. Very
        impressive! I tried Dan Harris' solution set as put together by
        nascarjon and it worked quite nicely. Lots to remember there for the
        last layer solutions.

        Hey, everyone. Well a few days ago i was watching the movie in the
        message titled "My First Move". Liking what I saw, I was inspired to
        make my own movie. I thought it was neat to see someone around my age,
        14 (I think he was anyway) solve the cube. I would like to say good job
        and thank you to thebunze. I believe did the cube fairly quick for a
        beginner method, although I was unsuccessful in beating thebunze's time
        of 1:03. My current record is 59 secs. So enjoy, and please leave some
        feedback, good or bad. Thank you.

        Hey nice video. Was that a layer method starting with blue? I'd enjoy
        helping eachother out. Last night on our way to the Hard rock Casino I
        did a time of 45 seconds doing the LL in 1 look skipping the other 3.
        (lucky) and my new best is 51 seconds without skipping anything. However
        with the Petrus method my times = bad If you have AIM then IM me @ "FM8"
        or add me on Yahoo. Im 16 btw but started when i was 13 and quit for 2-3

        Tyson, &gt; Your unwillingness to take up Stefan or &gt; my offers in
        this manner shows us a lack of confidence you have in your &gt; answer.
        It is a breach of nettiquete to demand an immediate response. Your
        conclusions as to why I haven't responded are all products of your
        imagination - all make believe. Since I met the two previous challenges,
        I would have thought that you might have concluded that there were other
        reasons why I was slow in responding. I also would have thought that the
        conservatism I have shown in my own listing of records on
        speedcubingdotcom would recommend me to you as one who doesn't make lame
        excuses, and who understands standards and proofs. If there are lame
        excuses here they are on your side. &gt; In the case where something
        cannot be proven, we &gt; have no reason to believe it. I have not asked
        you to believe anything. I gave you checkable references and you ignored
        them. I take efforts to keep contexts clear, but it seems you find those
        efforts to be tedious, which is probably why you missed that I made no
        claim to having psychic powers. &gt; No one can prove super-human
        powers, or &gt; ESP, This is, in fact, false. Some psychic abilities
        have been shown to exist. The inability of academia to honestly deal
        with this is well-known to many. Remote viewing was successfully
        demonstrated in a double blind experiment on national television.
        http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/pub/news/95nov30-dp.html Proofs
        have been presented many, many times, and refused publication with no
        good reason. &gt; or even religion for that matter, and so, the cubing
        community &gt; will not accept these reasons as excuses for whatever
        situation may &gt; arise. Sorry, but I haven't given any excuses. I was
        challenged to go to one of several websites and try the game. I did, and
        when I reported the result I was immediately misquoted. I was challenged
        to "play the game" 100 times, even though the problem revolves around a
        single try. I did not get the results I was told I would get, which
        means that your side failed to convince me, and on top of that it was
        implied that I was lying. You mistake me for a dancing bear, one who
        immediately jumps at your slightest urging. I met two challenges,
        although I took my time, and what did I get for my efforts? Ridicule,
        and now the false accusation that I was making lame excuses in not
        meeting challenges. At the time I presented the result of my multiple
        tries I was still thinking that this was a friendly place. I had hoped
        that my prior posts here might have given people the idea that I respect
        people. I had hoped that what I posted would lead to interesting
        conversations. To many of you here, it's been very nice getting you to
        know you a little bit, feel free to contact me privately. To the rest,
        you know who you are, I just say Good bye, David J --- In

        show us your code and &gt; if it does not contain errors, given that the
        probability of what you &gt; did was on the order of 10^-18, I will
        believe that you have ESP. If &gt; you show us your code, and it does
        indeed play the Monty Hall game, and &gt; you managed to get 76 wins
        without switching the door, I'll believe you &gt; have super-human
        powers. &gt; &gt; Either that, or just play my game. If you put in $4,
        and I put in $5, &gt; and out of 100 times you win 76 times, you win
        $468. That's a lot of &gt; money. &gt; &gt; With regards to ESP and all
        the arguments concerning time intervals and &gt; variations of the human
        mind, you are now simply deviating tremendously &gt; from your original
        statement that the probability of winning is 1/2 if &gt; one does not
        switch the door. Your unwillingness to take up Stefan or &gt; my offers
        in this manner shows us a lack of confidence you have in your &gt;
        answer. Or would you care to make a counter offer? Did you play &gt;
        Charles' program? &gt; &gt; With all of this said, I know this topic has
        strayed very far from &gt; Rubik's Cube, so I'm going to bring it back
        to the Rubik's Cube. If &gt; people are going to make claims, they
        should be willing to prove it. &gt; Creating a situation, such as this
        one, where things cannot be proven &gt; is not an excuse. In the case
        where something cannot be proven, we &gt; have no reason to believe it.
        No one can prove super-human powers, or &gt; ESP, or even religion for
        that matter, and so, the cubing community &gt; will not accept these
        reasons as excuses for whatever situation may &gt; arise. &gt; &gt; If
        you claim there are unicorns, it's your responsibility to prove to &gt;
        me that there's a unicorn. It's not my fault that I can't find a &gt;
        unicorn, and then you use that result to say that I can't disprove it,
        &gt; and therefore it's true. That's a logical fallacy. &gt; &gt; So, if
        you're going to post an unofficial world record, don't create a &gt;
        situation where you'll never be able to reproduce it, or you'll never
        &gt; be able to prove yourself. What if Macky started posting 11 second
        &gt; averages and then claimed, "I only have magical abilities on the
        cube &gt; when no one else is watching. Otherwise I get nervous. Oh, and
        if you &gt; film it, I get nervous too." Then how in the world are we
        supposed to &gt; verify it? &gt; &gt; If something cannot be proven, no
        one is going to give you the benefit &gt; of the doubt. &gt; &gt; Tyson

        Research Institute (now known as Stanford Research &gt; &gt;&gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Targ and Puthoff issued a lengthy and quite positive
        scientific &gt; &gt;&gt; paper extolling the psychic abilities of
        Geller. Their protocols for &gt; &gt;&gt; this "serious" investigation
        of the powers claimed by Geller were &gt; &gt;&gt; described by Dr. Ray
        Hyman, who investigated the project on behalf of &gt; &gt;&gt; a U.S.
        funding agency, as "sloppy and inadequate." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From
        Edwin C. May, Ph.D. &gt; &gt; Cognitive Sciences Laboratory &gt; &gt;
        Palo Alto, California &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In the Section on the
        Evaluation Plan in the report, Mumford et al. &gt; &gt; (Page 2-1, 1995)
        correctly required of the laboratory investigations &gt; &gt;
        "...unambiguous [emphasis added] evidence for the existence of the &gt;
        &gt; phenomenon... ." Following this lead, Hyman hypothesized a number
        of &gt; &gt; alternative explanations for the observed statistical
        significance &gt; &gt; other than the anomalous cognitive one, although
        he admits he couldn't &gt; &gt; find any obvious flaws in the
        methodology (Mumford et al., 1995, Page &gt; &gt; 3-75). &lt;
        &gt;eoq&lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Concerning SRI's research with Geller,
        Dr Ray Hyman did not witness &gt; &gt; them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ---

        honestly say that you didn't believe what you just quoted? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; IIRC Randi was there at SRI for the Iri Geller trials himself.
        He went &gt; &gt; over all of their procedures. He prides himself at
        being able to sniff &gt; &gt; out fakery. He found nothing wrong. He
        himself found that SRI's &gt; &gt; experiment was neither sloppy nor
        inadequate. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not at all impressed that Randi
        quotes someone else describing &gt; &gt; that SRI experiment as sloppy
        and inadequate, especially when he knows &gt; &gt; better from his own

        play some music in the background or something...or like macky does, do

        2006/1/4, Sachin Shirwalkar &lt;sachinss@...&gt;: &gt; Ofcourse its
        cool! &gt; &gt; &gt; Just dont let people see u solving the cube for the
        whole time. Coz &gt; staring at one thing which u dont understand for
        about 60 seconds is &gt; boring :( &gt; &gt; So make ur slve a little
        more dramatic...like play some music in the &gt; background or
        something...or like macky does, do it one handed while &gt; fliping
        balls with the other hand at the same time. &gt; &gt; Do let us know how
        it goes. And im sure, if u perform with the cube, &gt; atleast 2-3 ppl
        will get interested enuf to start cubing, and thats &gt; good for the
        community. So think of it as social work :) &gt; &gt; Sachin. &gt; &gt;

        Hi Adam, I'm a girl speedcuber. I'm a reasonably active cuber,
        particularly as far as girls go. I've competed in several official
        competitions and can solve lots of other puzzles too, not just the
        3×3×3. I've been part of this yahoo discussion group for many years, but
        just haven't posted much recently. I used to post A LOT on here, as
        Stefan's stats showed. (For those who don't know to what I'm referring,
        Stefan posted some stats a while ago about the most prolific posters at
        the time and I think I was reasonably high up on the list.) You'll find
        that very few girls are interested in speedcubing, which means very few
        girls are active in this group and very few enter official competitions
        (or unofficial competitions for that matter). Jasmine

        few girls are interested in speedcubing, &gt; which &gt; means very few

        So basically you'd like to know which person has had, in average, the
        best result, for this year consedering all categories ? If so, I think
        you need to figure out something like a "points classification". I think
        it can be easily made, just extend what has already been done with the
        20 best of each category. (of course you'd have a few problems you'd
        need to handle (for example : not the same number of competitors in
        every category)). If you want to have something more official, I suggest
        the creation of a "Cubing Quadriathlon event" or something like (i'm not
        sute if the word wuadriathlon is correct :p) that :p Though I'm not sure
        it'd be a success. Gilles. 2006/1/4, Craig Bouchard

        I'm a female cuber. For the most part I only do 3x3 speedsolving and

        Hi David :-) I think he probably means 2 and 2 swapped adjacent centers.
        That would leave a swap of 2 corners or swap of 2 edges at the end.

        Hey. A few things. What I was talking about is
        http://www.geocities.com/ladartfrog/untitled.jpg Also -- I encountered
        another pattern (top layer looks like an H) which took me a while to
        solve.. anyone know an easier method to solve that? In case it helps, I
        use the following algorithms for the last layer: F U R U' R' F' (to
        solve the cross) F R U R' U' F' (to solve the cross) L' U' L U' L' U2 L
        U2 ( rotate 3 corners) F2 U R' L F2 R L' U F2 (edge switch) F2 U' R' L
        F2 R L' U' F2 (edge switch) Maybe there is a site with a big list of
        solutions for this? I've looked but can't find anything good. thanks

        Hi :-) Ah ok then i know what u mean :-) It's a 2-flip :-) My easy cure
        for that is this one (assumimg u know what the E move is): R' E' R2 E2
        R' (flips first edge) U'............ (positions next edge) R E2 R2 E

        Hey -- sorry to be sending so many emails, but I realized that if my
        edges are at least oriented properly, I can solve them... the only
        problem I have is when they are rotated. So my real question (my initial
        one) is how do I rotate edge pieces? Can it be done without affecting
        the rest of the puzzle, or should the edges not be done last? Thanks

        -- I encountered another pattern (top layer looks like an H) which took

        F2 U' R' L F2 R L' U' F2 (edge switch) Maybe there is a site with a big
        list of solutions for this? I've looked but can't find anything good.

        Very nice commutator Per :-) Also, to flip edges on the LL, I recommend
        this : (M'U) * 4 It will flip the UB and the UL edge + the DB and DF
        edge. Just do U moves to choose which edge you want to flip and then do
        it again. (the down side will be solved) Gilles. 2006/1/4, Per Kristen
        Fredlund &lt;aspiring_to_love@...&gt;: &gt; Hi :-) &gt; &gt; Ah ok then
        i know what u mean :-) It's a 2-flip :-) &gt; &gt; My easy cure for that
        is this one (assumimg u know what the E move &gt; is): &gt; &gt; R' E'
        R2 E2 R' (flips first edge) &gt; U'............ (positions next edge)
        &gt; R E2 R2 E R... (flips second edge) &gt; U............. (restores U

        I have some auctions running again, some end this Saturday, some next.
        I'll probably add some more soon. I'm turning the German game cube into
        a speedcube again, same with the Tomy Megaminx. The Speed-Domino is
        prepared already, but I want to play with it some more before I sell it.

        http://search.ebay.co.uk/_W0QQsassZstefanQ5fpochmann The "normal" cube
        is a heavy (145 grams) old type cube with caps everywhere inside,
        probably late 1970s from Pentangle or Politechnika. The Calendar is
        German. All other puzzles are I think obvious from the group picture.

        looking around...ended up buying another magic, a homer simpson head, a
        new 5x5 (hope it turns out good :)) and then the 4x4 below. I wasn't
        going to get another 4x4...but all the stuff was 25% off...and this
        intrigued me...I've never seen anything like this...It was a public
        display, and the case was still closed like it had never been open, so I
        don't think someone took it out, mixed it, and then put it back in cuz
        there are only a few ppl in the world who can do that (from what I saw
        with the UFO puzzles at WC)...so can anyone explain this phenomenon???
        Anyone else ever had this happen??? I had to buy it...and right now the
        cube is in my garage with lube in it...when it is done I am going to
        time the solve... Side 1:

        Gilles, I don't know if I understand your method. How would I use it to
        solve something like the one I posted before,
        http://www.geocities.com/ladartfrog/untitled.bmp, or like
        http://www.geocities.com/ladartfrog/2fish.jpg that I would like to learn
        your method since it requires almost no memorization. thanks David

        commutator Per :-) Also, to flip edges on the LL, I recommend this :
        (M'U) * 4 It will flip the UB and the UL edge + the DB and DF edge. Just
        do U moves to choose which edge you want to flip and then do it again.
        (the down side will be solved) Gilles. 2006/1/4, Per Kristen Fredlund
        &lt;aspiring_to_love@...&gt;: &gt; Hi :-) &gt; &gt; Ah ok then i know
        what u mean :-) It's a 2-flip :-) &gt; &gt; My easy cure for that is
        this one (assumimg u know what the E move &gt; is): &gt; &gt; R' E' R2
        E2 R' (flips first edge) &gt; U'............ (positions next edge) &gt;
        R E2 R2 E R... (flips second edge) &gt; U............. (restores U
        layer) &gt; &gt; To know what the E move is check here : &gt; &gt;

        (FR'F'R)(L'U)(RU'M') &gt; Then Permute with R2 d'(M'U2M) d'L2 &gt; &gt;
        Does the first one mean M'U three times in the same spot, then U, then
        MU 3 times in the same spot, then U? &gt; &gt; The second one makes
        sense except I don't understand the logic behind the grouping with

        David M refers to the column between L and R. M turns similarly to L,
        and M' is like an R. Grouping with parentheses helps to denote which
        moves should be done together, either to demonstrate the effects of
        certain chunks, or for ease of performing the moves themselves. The d'
        was lowercase because it means the two layers below U. Lowercase letters
        generally refer to double layer turns. Also, Jason, why don't you
        perform that ELL as (rUR')(U'M)(URU'R')? It only uses RUM moves and is
        super fast. The inverse is great, too: (RUR'U)(M'U)(RU'r') -Mike

        Well i still think this sport or hobby, whatever you call it is still
        somewhat male oriented. I'll tell you my experience...i am in the
        process of setting a rubik's cube club at my univ and to that effect i
        had called a informal meeting of all those interested in the cube....i
        had publicised it quite well and about 25 people showed up which is
        quite above my expectations btw. But the real fun thing is that not even
        a single female turned up. So i think this clearly shows that cubing is
        not much the liking of the female population. Also the statistics on
        this group or in any cubing competition also show the same results. But
        i still cannot understand as to what exactly makes cubing so male
        dominated? Is there some genes in males which are more tuned to puzzle
        solving or what? Sachin. On 1/5/06, adam kiss

        Today a friend showed me a passage in her Sudoku book which claimed that
        the Rubik's Cube is NOT a puzzle. Their claim is that anything which has
        more than one solved state is not a puzzle. Their reason is that because
        the centres on a standard Rubik's Cube can have various different
        orientations and we still consider it 'solved', then it isn't a puzzle.
        By this definition only supercubes are puzzles. I thought the book
        sounded pretty crap. My friend didn't necessarily believe it either, but
        had told me about it because she knew I'd be interested in anything that
        mentioned cubes. Maybe the author was just trying to convince sudoku
        solvers that they are cooler than cubers?? ;) What does everyone else
        think? BTW, I consulted Wikipedia to see what it had to say on the
        matter: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle (You'll see that the cube is
        almost the definition of puzzle in Wikipedia! Well, not quite, but
        you'll see what I mean if you follow this link.) Jasmine

        The way we solve the cube, it's not a puzzle. The Rubik's Cube, when
        solved without being taught, is indeed a puzzle. The fact that the
        Rubik's Cube has 12 additional orientation combinations for the centers
        (did I get that number right) is pretty trivial. If they want to define
        puzzle that way, fine, we just draw some arrows. If anything, I think
        just citing the number of Rubik's Cube competitions compared to Sudoku
        competitions, and I think we can rest our case. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Hi :-) Yes i tend to agree. I have a few of the 2003 version made in
        russia. Maybe the ones made before or after (in Hungary) are a lot
        better. Anyhow it seems like too much work to make a studio cube which
        will turn as nicely as the black diy (from rubiks.com). And it doesn't
        have arched centers either. So yes, the studio cubes on sale at ebay

        Hi :-) I have heard those things before, that the cube is NOT a puzzle.
        The reason given wass that you simply follow steps that u know
        beforehand. That the cube is not a puzzle because it has several solved
        states sounds a bit lame: too theoretical and far fetched. Anyhow, maybe
        one could say that the cube is a puzzle only as long as u work it all
        out by urself, and that until the solving becomes "mechanical" it
        remains a puzzle and after that only a toy ? Whether the cube is a toy
        or a puzzle is not really so interesting. One can still have heaps of
        fun with it. It gets more intriguing the more u learn about it ;-)
        Cheers! -Per PS! The normal 3x3x3 cube has (4^6)/2 = 2048 "solved
        states". It's impossible to turn a singular center 90 degrees. &gt; ---

        I just re-assembled 4x4x4 for the first time. Peter's little brother
        pulled his 4x4x4 apart the other day and assumed that I'd be able to fix
        it (a fair assumption since he knows I can solve it). Anyway, I told him
        that I've never re-assembled a 4x4x4 before, but I'd give it a go. I've
        put it back together now, but jeez, it was not easy! Solving the 4x4x4
        is much easier then reassembling it!! Not that this should be a surprise
        though because solving a 3x3x3 the normal way is much faster and easier
        than reassembling it. Does anyone have a good site about ressembling the
        4x4x4. If so, I'll send the link next time someone asks me about the

        group] Rubik's cube the 'puzzle' &gt; The way we solve the cube, it's
        not a puzzle. The Rubik's Cube, when &gt; solved without being taught,
        is indeed a puzzle. The fact that the &gt; Rubik's Cube has 12
        additional orientation combinations for the centers &gt; (did I get that
        number right) is pretty trivial. If they want to &gt; define puzzle that
        way, fine, we just draw some arrows. &gt; &gt; If anything, I think just
        citing the number of Rubik's Cube &gt; competitions compared to Sudoku
        competitions, and I think we can rest &gt; our case. &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao

        showed me a passage in her Sudoku book which claimed &gt; &gt; that &gt;

        which &gt; &gt; has &gt; &gt; more than one solved state is not a
        puzzle. Their reason is that &gt; &gt; because &gt; &gt; the centres on
        a standard Rubik's Cube can have various different &gt; &gt;
        orientations and we still consider it 'solved', then it isn't a puzzle.
        &gt; &gt; By this definition only supercubes are puzzles. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I thought the book sounded pretty crap. My friend didn't
        necessarily &gt; &gt; believe it either, but had told me about it
        because she knew I'd be &gt; &gt; interested in anything that mentioned
        cubes. Maybe the author was just &gt; &gt; trying to convince sudoku
        solvers that they are cooler than cubers?? ;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What
        does everyone else think? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I consulted Wikipedia
        to see what it had to say on the matter: &gt; &gt;
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle (You'll see that the cube is almost
        &gt; &gt; the definition of puzzle in Wikipedia! Well, not quite, but
        you'll see &gt; &gt; what I mean if you follow this link.) &gt; &gt;

        One way of impress is to talk to the audience when you solve the cube
        and describe what you are doing, and also look the audience in their
        eyes when executing algorithms ("Oh, he does it without looking at
        it..."). This will most probably slow down the solve a bit, but for a

        have two pieces &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which need to be switched and
        rotated. I only have 6 sequences &gt; &gt; &gt; that I &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; use for the last layer, and I can usually solve this situation
        &gt; &gt; &gt; in 5-10 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes of randomly
        trying different combinations of sequences. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        - Sorry about the Notation. I forget that beginners don't know the

        I don't know how you solve the cube, but I dont suggest learning the
        beginners method posted there. Just learn the ROUx method. Very little
        to memorize... M'U M'U M' U2 M U M U M U2 (M' is pushing, M is pulling)

        David &gt; &gt; M refers to the column between L and R. M turns
        similarly to L, and &gt; M' is like an R. &gt; &gt; Grouping with
        parentheses helps to denote which moves should be done &gt; together,
        either to demonstrate the effects of certain chunks, or for &gt; ease of
        performing the moves themselves. &gt; &gt; The d' was lowercase because
        it means the two layers below U. &gt; Lowercase letters generally refer
        to double layer turns. &gt; &gt; Also, Jason, why don't you perform that
        ELL as (rUR')(U'M)(URU'R')? &gt; It only uses RUM moves and is super
        fast. The inverse is great, too: &gt; (RUR'U)(M'U)(RU'r') &gt; &gt;

        There is something I wanted to do : At the english class, we had to talk
        for a few minutes about an object we use daily. Of course, I took the
        cube. But for some reason the teacher put me with another student and I
        had to talk about the iMac G5 :s However, what I had planned was this :
        Show it solved to the class at the beginning, describing it, and then
        showing them how to scramble it. And then I was supposed to talk about
        competitions, different approaches of the cube (FMC, speed, one
        handed,..) and solve it one-handed at the same time. (Because when I
        talk, especially to a large audience, I use my hands to speak) But
        thinking about it now, it'd have been a bit difficult. :s Have fun !

        HEllo everyone I had to post. Because of me, there are 6 more women that
        can independently solve the cube. My Mom, 2 sisters, 2 friends, and my
        10 year old cousin (proudest achievement). I taught them F2L using 1
        simple sequence (RURU'), its mirror and inverses(L'U'LU)
        (URU'R')(U'L'UL). 1. Solve Cross ( 2 step process, Orient on Opposite
        center) 2. Place Corners using (RUR'U')or(L'U'LU) 3. Place middle layer
        edges using (URU'R')y'(U'L'UL) Then I just taught them a simple 4 look,
        Petrus style approach 1. Orient Edges F(RUR'U') F' or F(URU'R')F' 2.
        Position Corners with Niklas (RU')(L'U)(R'U'L) 3. Orient Corners with
        Sunes and Antisunes 4. Position Edges (R2U)(RUR'U')(R'U')(R'UR') and R2
        d'(M'U2M)d' L2 the Best part of all was that I taught all of them using
        no notation. Everything just had a name. There are really only 5
        sequences to learn. 9 if you count inverses and mirrors. Sorry about big
        posting Jason Kovacic PS. I have also taught my Brother and my friend
        Troy. Everyone was given a choice of either Corners 1st or Cross
        (Demonstrated). Both males chose corners 1st 5 females chose cross 1
        female learned both kind of interesting... -- In

        a puzzle. Their claim is that anything which &gt; &gt; &gt; has &gt;
        &gt; &gt; more than one solved state is not a puzzle. Their reason is
        that &gt; &gt; &gt; because &gt; &gt; &gt; the centres on a standard
        Rubik's Cube can have various different &gt; &gt; &gt; orientations and

        Its really good that you are teching so many people to cube. And its
        really interesting that most of the females choose cross over corners
        first. Do we have any psychologists on this group that can shed some
        light on this male-female discussion? I had a psychology course last
        year but i really didnt pay much attention to it and now i think i
        should have :( Sachin. &gt; I have also taught my Brother and my friend
        Troy. &gt; Everyone was given a choice of either Corners 1st or Cross
        (Demonstrated). &gt; &gt; Both males chose corners 1st &gt; 5 females
        chose cross &gt; 1 female learned both &gt; &gt; kind of interesting...

        Hello everyone how many of you out there know multiple methods? On
        Speedcubing.com, the record is like 11 methods for under 3 minutes. What
        actually constitutes a separate method, and not just a variant? I think
        I know 6 systems for speedcubing... CFOP 25.48, 21.62 Xcross OLL PLL
        23.75, 21.09 Petrus (3x2x2 Orient Edges) 26.12, (33.48) Varasano Corners
        25.81, 30.12 Waterman Corners 31.20, 25.03 ROUX (19.69), 21.31 AVG 25.15
        None of these times are spectacular, but i am happy with them. I'm
        gladmthat my Roux solves were the fastest, as it is my main method.
        Petrus is my slowest system; Expanding to 3x2x2 is hard for me.
        Howerver, I do use full color neutrality for petrus solves; It's is
        easier than it sounds. Happy Cubing Jason Kovacic Kovacic81@...

        You're not going to answer his one in a hurry! Chess has had the same
        discussion for generations. The only thing I think you can say is that
        individually there is no reason for either sex to be better than the
        other (personally I'd say the Polgars - especially Judith - have
        demonstrated this in chess) even thought there might be good reasons -
        social or otherwise - for men to be more interested. (Go Jasmine!)

        Hi Jasmine, Was it an Eastheen 4x4x4 or a Rubik's 4x4x4? About 6 months

        Even i had the same problem. The thing is Ron gave me one of his used
        Rubik 4x4 and i practised it like hell that night. And sure enuf, pieces
        kept popping out. But in one solve, the whole cube totally crumbled in
        my hands. So i got a good look at the mechanism and tried to reassemble
        it. At that time i had a friend with me in my room so i asked him to
        hold the 4x4 for me while i put the pieces in. But he thought it would
        be much more fun to watch me fight over it. So there i was, trying to
        hold the incomplete 4x4 in one hand and searching for pieces with the
        other hand while trying to dodge from my friend trying to hit the
        unstable structure with cubies :) But finally it was over and i was very
        happy that i could do it. Now im waiting for my 5x5 to arrive so that i
        may pry it open to see its mechanism. Sachin. On 1/5/06, Per Kristen

        Rubik's cube the 'puzzle' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The way we
        solve the cube, it's not a puzzle. The Rubik's Cube, &gt; when &gt; &gt;
        &gt; solved without being taught, is indeed a puzzle. The fact that &gt;
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubik's Cube has 12 additional orientation
        combinations for the &gt; centers &gt; &gt; &gt; (did I get that number
        right) is pretty trivial. If they want &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; define
        puzzle that way, fine, we just draw some arrows. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; If anything, I think just citing the number of Rubik's Cube
        &gt; &gt; &gt; competitions compared to Sudoku competitions, and I think
        we can &gt; rest &gt; &gt; &gt; our case. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        claim is that anything &gt; which &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; more than one solved state is not a puzzle. Their reason is &gt;
        that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the centres on a
        standard Rubik's Cube can have various &gt; different &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; orientations and we still consider it 'solved', then it isn't &gt;
        a puzzle. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By this definition only supercubes are
        puzzles. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought the book
        sounded pretty crap. My friend didn't &gt; necessarily &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; believe it either, but had told me about it because she knew &gt;
        I'd be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in anything that mentioned cubes.
        Maybe the author &gt; was just &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to convince
        sudoku solvers that they are cooler than &gt; cubers?? ;) &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does everyone else think? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I consulted Wikipedia to see what it had
        to say on the &gt; matter: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle (You'll see that the cube &gt; is
        almost &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the definition of puzzle in Wikipedia! Well,
        not quite, but &gt; you'll see &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what I mean if you

        The thing is with this though, The puzzle was in a display...hard to
        explain, but wasn't in a shop. The people that worked there were just
        people trying to make money...and I don't think it was tampered with.
        Someone mentioned before that they thought that maybe it had been on
        display and then someone put it back in so the stickers wouldn't
        curl...not likely, cuz it would walk away too easily, and if it was on
        display, the box would have probably been thrown away as the company
        wouldn't want to sell a used item. Craig

        Okay, because we (most of us) learned a solution, the cube is more of a
        sport than a puzzle but every cross I make is its own little puzzle as

        I'm not a big ebay user. If I said "I'll send you cash/check for

        know 6 systems for speedcubing... &gt; &gt; CFOP 25.48, 21.62 &gt;
        Xcross OLL PLL 23.75, 21.09 &gt; Petrus (3x2x2 Orient Edges) 26.12,
        (33.48) &gt; Varasano Corners 25.81, 30.12 &gt; Waterman Corners 31.20,
        25.03 &gt; ROUX (19.69), 21.31 &gt; &gt; AVG 25.15 &gt; &gt; None of
        these times are spectacular, but i am happy with them. I'm &gt;
        gladmthat my Roux solves were the fastest, as it is my main method. &gt;
        &gt; Petrus is my slowest system; Expanding to 3x2x2 is hard for me.
        &gt; Howerver, I do use full color neutrality for petrus solves; It's is
        &gt; easier than it sounds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy Cubing &gt; &gt;

        are the cubes from the Japanese snack company Tohato, and they picture a
        jack-o-lantern hot pepper on each face. Apparently they are fairly
        challenging since each face uses the same scheme. I've seen videos of
        Yuki Hayashi and Katsuyuki Konishi solving it, and they take
        considerably longer than their normal solving times! Anyway, I've
        checked on the Tohato site and eBay but I haven't seen any for sale. If
        someone has an extra, or wants to sell theirs, please let me know.
        Thanks! Chris Pelley P.S. The week before WC05, I had an idea for a
        "Rubik's Magic Pumpkin" puzzle that would be similar to the Homer Head
        or Darth Maul 2x2 cubes. But the idea I had was that when it was in the
        solved position, the eyes of the pumpkin would light up or something
        like that. So it would be like a jack-o-lantern cube. So when I spotted
        the Tohato cubes at WC05, I was quite surprised! I guess it's not that
        big of a coincidence since WC05 was the week after Halloween.

        orientation so it would be a puzzle in that sense, albeit only for the
        2x2x2 and 3x3x3.) I agree to a large extent with what Tyson said (about
        it not being a puzzle, at least for most of the people here). At least
        in the sense it is not a puzzle to solve it - but in the sense of the of
        the theory behind it, there's still a lot to know. Maybe that's not a
        puzzle though. &gt; I thought the book sounded pretty crap. My friend
        didn't necessarily &gt; believe it either, but had told me about it

        In the same way that a Rubik's cube is a puzzle, so also is a Sudoku.
        Just as you learn an algorithm to accomplish a certain task on the cube,
        you learn to "cross-hatch" or draw lines on a Sudoku to limit a number
        to a square. In any puzzle you must use some algorithm, very easy and
        unnoticable or sequential and essential as for the cube, to accomplish
        tasks. In a jigsaw puzzle, I begin with the corners (an algorithm that
        helps me figure out the outline) and I search the unplaced pieces for
        one that matches the picture and cutouts (another algorithm, even though
        it is an obvious one). I dont think just because there exists a large
        number of algorithms to accomplish different tasks that the cube can no
        longer be called a puzzle. The puzzle is figuring out which algorithm to
        use in a certain situation. If that holds, even speedsolving is still a
        form of puzzle-solving. Regardless, the first step for solving the cube
        (like making a cross) is still a puzzle. Cheers, Robert Hank &gt; -----

        Hey -- Jason, you said that I should learn the ROUx method... so you

        solve the cube consistently without having to look at any references
        (thanks to the help provided by many of you who have answered my
        questions in the past few days). My method is: -Solve first 2 layers
        -Solve the cross of the bottom layer -Get the LL corners in the right
        place -Get the LL corners rotated correctly -Switch any incorrect
        corners I am starting to get pretty good at this, but I know there is
        little I can do besides getting faster with my algorithms and cutting
        down time doing the first layer. I can do it in about 4 minutes usually,
        but I want to start learning more advanced methods. I'm not looking to
        be the best cuber ever or anything, but I would like to at least get my
        average down to 90 seconds or 2 minutes. What are the most common
        methods that you guys use, how difficult are they to learn and use, and

        Are you sure? It seems like it would be absolutely ridiculous to cut
        down the time that much. Even if I did no thinking or looking at the
        cube at all, but instead just always knew exactly which algorithm to use
        instantly, I think the way I'm doing it now would still take over a
        minute... any other thoughts? And even so, I'll eventually want to start
        getting more advanced and using some of the methods that you guys use...
        the methods which allow you to do cubes in 20 seconds. For the time
        being, I'm looking for any methods which are slightly faster than my
        current method, but I'd rather not try to learn any of the hardest
        methods first. Let me know.. thanks! David -----------------------

        When I first got a cube (when i was 7 or so), The furthest I could get
        was to orient all of the white pieces to the white center. " I got the

        edges. I had no idea that the pieces all had to be in a certain place. I
        didn't even realize at that point that the centers were stationary. I
        didn't understand the opposite colors. I learned a corners 1st method by

        I was around 19 when i took the cube for solving it seriously. I kept
        working on it for a whole 3 months(i had my summer holidays going on)
        ... i only saw one algo on the net to flip two corners but then i
        realised that this is cheating so i started to work on my own solution.
        I did somethinglike a corners first method with solving the two opposite
        layers and then doing the middle layer at the end, I remember very
        vividly, i was in the train once when i "discovered" the sune algorithm.
        I was just playing around with the corner edge pair and i thougt of
        putting them a little differently and then suddenly the corners were all
        oriented! I was very proud of myself that time. I had gotten really
        stuck in the last two edge pairs. I just couldnt orient them correctly.
        So when one day when i was playing with the cube, the pieces popped out,
        I just put them back together and solved them. Then i realised that i
        had put the btm layer edge wrongly...so i put it back correctly adn then
        solved it. But in the mean time the two middle layer pieces had oriented
        them correctly! So i gave it some thought and my method at that time was
        to purposefully incorrectly orient the btm layer edge piece and them do
        a middle layer turn and again solve it. Now that i look back upon it, it
        seems to be just horribly inefficient, but i was still very proud of
        myself :) Btw ppl dont hijack the topic...lets stick to the original
        thread :) Sachin. On 1/6/06, kovacic81 &lt;kovacic81@yahoo.com&gt;

        In many ways I am right with you Stefan. I don't think solving it
        yourself is necessarily a good start for speedcubing but the
        satisfaction is worth the effort. I was very surprised when I took the
        cube up again in 2003 that most people in this forum didn't solve it for
        themselves. Having said that I think general puzzle solving techniques
        and experience are important (in life generally!) and if you start to
        learn them by being taught how to solve the cube well thats good
        experience too. Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From: "Stefan

        Hi Jasmine ! I worked out the solution all by myself back in 1981. I was
        16 yrs old at the time. Like you i seem to remember that the last layer
        was what i struggled with. My very first method i neeeded to "restart" 5
        or 6 times over and in some myterious ways i then solved the cube in
        about 10 mins or so. This was before i discovered how to construct
        genuine 3-cycles. Gaining insight into constructing cycles skyrocketed
        my cubing. Quite soon my times were down to 40 secs or so. Whether a
        newbie cuber should go through the pain and agony of working it all out
        by himself/herself i leave up to the individual. But surely if someone
        asks me for help i won't hesitate to give it. I won't "overrule" the
        decision of that individual to not figure it out by himself/herself ;-)
        I don't believe that having been taught (parts of) a method is
        necessarily bad for "cube-understanding". Those who not learn all all on
        his/her own are probably not interested in the "deeper" understanding of
        the cube. They just want to be able to "solve that thing" ;-) Cheers!

        Sub-60s is definitely possible with a 4-look LL. I used to solve with a
        4-look LL and didn't really bother learning more LL algorithms until I
        got my average under 60s. It's possible to go much faster than 60s with
        4-look LL. I've seen people do 30s solves with a 4-look LL! Are you
        solving with F2L pairs? If not then I'd advise that would be a very
        valuable next step. F2L pairs are not that difficult to work out on your
        own and they'll really improve your solve times once you get the hang of
        them. BTW, re working stuff out on your own (just referring to another
        discussion string on the group), I feel pretty strongly about this with
        regard to the F2L. Even now I never use an F2L trick unless I understand
        exactly how it works. :) Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com On Thu,

        For the time being, I'm looking for any methods which are &gt; slightly

        someone having success with something that isn't Fridrich. I've been
        working more on my variation for step 4 where you first place DB as you
        orient edges, and then permute the L5E. So far, it's very much like
        learning ZB. Right now, my average with pure Roux is around 20, but my
        normal average this way is about 22. My best times are 15.0x this way
        (non lucky), though, so it has very good spike times. I expect this
        number to grow substantially once I learn more algs. One strategy I'm
        experimenting with that could be useful to you (or other Roux solvers)
        is learning both COLL and CLL. This would allow you O6E skips twice as
        often, and give you the three edges orientation for the majority of the
        rest of solves. Also, I've been trying to recognize the orientation
        before the end of step 2. If you save either the DL or DR edge piece for
        last, you can use it to help influence orientation to your liking. If
        you have a corner edge pair for last, you can use those too, with some
        intuitive ZBF2L. This is a little harder, but will be more useful in the
        end. That said, learning one step algs for corners is going to help your
        times, but not all that much. The F2B and L6E steps are much more
        important. You can get very good times still using only two step algs
        for the corners. Learning to use unconstrained centers and the special
        cases for step 4 will probably get you farther in the end than CLL. I
        say in the end because those are probably going to take a long time to
        get used to, but they will be worth it. Keep up the good work, and keep
        us posted! -Mike

        me. Is it 75%? 50% of the time you get one parity, and 50% of the time
        you don't get it, you get the other. 7/8 * 31/108 .251 5/6 * 51/648 .065
        26/27 * 9/24 .574 11/12 * 7/24 .267 ------------ ---- 1.16 So, dividing
        41% by 1.16 we get ~35%. Did I do that right? :S -Mike

        I cannot stand the 25th anniversary stickers. If I cube with them near a
        ceiling light (or just about any direct light source), I'm nearly
        blinded while solving the silver face. Additionally, the blue stickers
        crapped out amazingly fast. After getting one, I switched to making the
        yellow face my top face, because it was easier to see, and every cube
        has a yellow face. Then I just got fed up and replaced the stickers. On
        the bright side, it's now my best cube. On 1/5/06, Eric

        Right on. F2L pairs is your definite next step. I was using your method
        and picked up Fridrich in manageable chunks using the following steps: I
        learned F2L pairs from Fridrich's site and stuck to the 4LLL until I had
        a consistent sub 30 time on F2L. F2L pairs is easy to learn on its own
        because you can set each algorithm up to practice quickly. I didn't move
        on from each algorithm until I really understood how it worked. That
        helps a ton in reducing your decision making time for each pair. Then I
        created a sort of 3 look LL method by orienting edges first using my old
        method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and permute the LL.
        There are only 6 Fridrich LL orientation algorithms where all edges are
        already oriented, so it seemed like a good small chunk to learn, instead
        of trying to memorize all 41 or w/e at once. I had to break the Fridrich
        method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-) But I went
        from 3 min. solves using your method to sub 60 very quickly. - Matt On

        I was something like 7 or 8 when I picked up a cube for the first time.
        I tried doing it color by color, though after a while I did understand
        that when I finished a side all the colors had to line up with the
        center pieces of the adjacent sides. So I figured out how to do one
        layer, and at one point managed to get two sides solved, but then, of
        course, couldn't get any further without messing up the progress I'd
        made. After a few years that first Rubik's cube got lost (though I found
        a few pieces of it in an old toy box last year and I'm still wondering
        what happened to it), and I didn't pick it up again until I started my
        freshman year at Caltech, when I figured out a very inefficient method
        to do the first two layers. I finally consulted a website for help on
        the last layer, though initially I skipped over the part about the
        middle layer, so I kept using my own method for a while. Which explains
        why the first timed solves I recorded were on the order of the time it
        takes me to do a 4x4 now (and I'm still pretty slow at that). I gave my
        brother a cube for Christmas, and I let him play with it for a while
        before attempting to teach him a solution. Not only is it more
        satisfying to see how much you can figure out on your own, it's also
        easier to learn a solution when you have a slightly better understanding
        of what's going on and not just applying movesets blindly. Shelley ---

        in another thread, someone was asking about how old were cubers when
        they figured it out on their own (without being taught or reading from a
        book). I was 11, well actually almost 12. did it during summer break
        back in 1981. There wasn't anyone else I knew that could do it, though I
        had one friend (who was at the time basically my only friend) who was a
        little interested in trying to figure it out, but not quite as obsessed
        as I was. Figuring it out took an awful lot of patience and thinking and
        trial and error--basically, my whole summer. Obviously, there would not
        be anywhere near as many cubers if we restricted it to only those who
        actually figured it out on their own--sure, many people can figure it
        out, but how many have the time or interest or determination to figure
        it out? But only those who have figured it out on their own know the
        feeling you get when you can put those last couple of pieces of the
        puzzle back in place without any help. It was a real confidence booster
        and a watershed point in my life. In the 6th grade, I was a loner, a
        wallflower, very shy, introverted, and very much a nerd. I ate my sack
        lunch by myself then went to the library. I didn't talk to or play with
        other kids at recess. Then 7th grade started, and when people found out
        I could solve the cube, they wanted a demonstration so I would solve it
        for them at lunch--eventually I started to charge people 25 cents to do
        it, and kids would gather round and watch and I guess it was basically
        what I needed to come out of my shell a little, and that year I stopped
        staring at the floor all the time and started to have confidence in
        myself and I formed many very good friendships (though ironically none
        of my friends ever really did learn how to solve the cube). You can look
        at pictures of me from the 6th to the 7th and you can see a real
        transformation. Maybe it would have happened without the cube, or would
        have been just the same if I had just learned how to do it from someone
        else, but it was definitely a catalyst. My method was just a simple
        layer by layer, with a few algs for what we would call a 4 look LL. I
        could get the F2L very early on, but the LL is what took me most of the
        summer to figure out. By the time school started 7th grade I could do it
        in about a minute and a half. I think I was lucky the internet wasn't
        around back then, becuase I probably would have just looked up some
        solution and learned it, and I'm glad I did it on my own. But I never
        would have become a speedcuber if I hadn't looked up other algs on the
        Internet and learned from others, so you could say that deprived me of
        the chance to become a speedcuber on my own, and that's just fine with
        me... --Kirk

        Yeah I've wondered that a lot myself. My older cousin (who was already a
        college professor) wrote down a few notes for me only about 2 days after
        I got my first cube. He had figured it out on his own, taking about
        three months. A few days later I could solve it myself. So I'll never
        know how far I would've gotten on my own. I did solve the 4x4, 5x5 on my
        own, but I just extended the 3x3 corners-first method so that doesn't
        count. Megaminx doesn't really count either since so much knowledge is
        transferrable. I did solve Square-1 on my own, and it took me almost two
        years! Of course I didn't work on it continuously during that time. So I
        imagine I might have licked the 3x3 eventually. Learning a radically
        different method can be almost like starting over. I know when I began
        learning F2L after being a corners-first guy for so long, it was almost
        like a whole new puzzle. (Yes, PUZZLE!) Chris --- In

        Jasmine/Matt -- at the moment, I solve the first layer and second layer
        seperately. I took a look at a couple sites, but I'm not sure which one
        to use... they seem a little difficult to follow. Any suggestions for
        what sites I should visit for learning how to solve F2L pairs? Please
        provide links beacuse I am not familiar with any of the names of sites.
        Also, what is meant by a "4 look method" or a "3 look method", etc?
        Thanks! David Matt Moberly &lt;mmoberly@...&gt; wrote: Right on. F2L
        pairs is your definite next step. I was using your method and picked up
        Fridrich in manageable chunks using the following steps: I learned F2L
        pairs from Fridrich's site and stuck to the 4LLL until I had a
        consistent sub 30 time on F2L. F2L pairs is easy to learn on its own
        because you can set each algorithm up to practice quickly. I didn't move
        on from each algorithm until I really understood how it worked. That
        helps a ton in reducing your decision making time for each pair. Then I
        created a sort of 3 look LL method by orienting edges first using my old
        method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and permute the LL.
        There are only 6 Fridrich LL orientation algorithms where all edges are
        already oriented, so it seemed like a good small chunk to learn, instead
        of trying to memorize all 41 or w/e at once. I had to break the Fridrich
        method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-) But I went
        from 3 min. solves using your method to sub 60 very quickly. - Matt On

        definitely possible with a 4-look LL. I used to solve with a &gt; 4-look
        LL and didn't really bother learning more LL algorithms until I &gt; got
        my average under 60s. &gt; &gt; It's possible to go much faster than 60s
        with 4-look LL. I've seen &gt; people do 30s solves with a 4-look LL!
        &gt; &gt; Are you solving with F2L pairs? If not then I'd advise that
        would be a &gt; very valuable next step. F2L pairs are not that
        difficult to work out on &gt; your own and they'll really improve your
        solve times once you get the &gt; hang of them. &gt; &gt; BTW, re
        working stuff out on your own (just referring to another &gt; discussion
        string on the group), I feel pretty strongly about this with &gt; regard
        to the F2L. Even now I never use an F2L trick unless I understand &gt;
        exactly how it works. :) &gt; &gt; Jasmine &gt;

        Hi everyone, First of all, thanks to everyone who took part in the
        Christmas Challenge FMC! I have a lot of entries to deal with, and I
        will promise to post the results on the FMC page sometime tomorrow
        morning :) There were lots of great solutions as always! Finally,
        FMC#102 will be launched at midnight tonight, falling back down to earth
        after the novelties of the TeamFMC100 and then the Christmas Challenge,
        with a regular FMC scramble. All you have to do is solve the scramble in
        as least moves as possible! All are welcome, and it is always great to
        have new people on board! Yes, that includes all you speedcubers too!
        Good Luck! Dan :) [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]

        Yeah, I agree with you mike, CMLL isn't everything. I broke the 25avg
        barrier by just optimising how I did my F2B. Now I'm after sub-20 :) I
        find that CMLL sometimes slows me down, as I know 60% of it, but I'm not
        'fluent' with every case I know yet. I think the F2B is the most
        important part, then comes LSEC and then CMLL :) Well, that in ordedr of
        how much I think I could improve each bit :) Thanks, Thom. --- In

        &gt; Although it isn't a staggering figure, it is my first sub 25 avg
        with &gt; &gt; ROUX. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (19.97), 24.64, 20.55, 22.49,
        24.03, (31.84), 28.37, 25.84, 24.72, &gt; &gt; 25.87, 25.92, 26.79 AVG
        24.92 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still use a 2 step process for Corners. Once
        i learn CLL, these &gt; &gt; times will drop substantially. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Jason k &gt; &gt; Way to go, Jason! It's good to see someone
        having success with &gt; something that isn't Fridrich. I've been
        working more on my variation &gt; for step 4 where you first place DB as
        you orient edges, and then &gt; permute the L5E. So far, it's very much
        like learning ZB. Right now, &gt; my average with pure Roux is around
        20, but my normal average this way &gt; is about 22. My best times are
        15.0x this way (non lucky), though, so &gt; it has very good spike
        times. I expect this number to grow &gt; substantially once I learn more
        algs. &gt; &gt; One strategy I'm experimenting with that could be useful
        to you (or &gt; other Roux solvers) is learning both COLL and CLL. This
        would allow &gt; you O6E skips twice as often, and give you the three
        edges orientation &gt; for the majority of the rest of solves. &gt; &gt;
        Also, I've been trying to recognize the orientation before the end of
        &gt; step 2. If you save either the DL or DR edge piece for last, you
        can &gt; use it to help influence orientation to your liking. If you
        have a &gt; corner edge pair for last, you can use those too, with some
        intuitive &gt; ZBF2L. This is a little harder, but will be more useful
        in the end. &gt; &gt; That said, learning one step algs for corners is
        going to help your &gt; times, but not all that much. The F2B and L6E
        steps are much more &gt; important. You can get very good times still
        using only two step algs &gt; for the corners. &gt; &gt; Learning to use
        unconstrained centers and the special cases for step 4 &gt; will
        probably get you farther in the end than CLL. I say in the end &gt;
        because those are probably going to take a long time to get used to,
        &gt; but they will be worth it. &gt; &gt; Keep up the good work, and
        keep us posted! &gt; &gt; -Mike &gt;

        I had the same exact problem. I recieved my kit 2 fridays before
        christmas, I discovered the problem with the screws and I emailed them
        saturday. They told me about their factory problem and that they would
        send the replacement screws on monday via "air mail". Now I'm still not
        clear as to what air mail is because I didn't get them by friday and
        since UPS operates only on business days (or so I'm told), there was no
        way I was getting the screws before christmas. I was disappointed
        because I was going away for vacation and I wanted something to do on
        the long plane ride. Anyhow, I got back from vacation 8 days later and
        the screws still haven't come. So I'm not exactly sure what this "air
        mail" is since it's not the usual shipping that you pay for. I wonder if
        the screws are coming in a regular letter envelope via regular mail. Oy,
        I had high expectations for my 1st experience with Rubiks.com but they

        for vacation and I wanted &gt; &gt; something to do on the long plane
        ride. Anyhow, I got back from &gt; &gt; vacation 8 days later and the
        screws still haven't come. So I'm not &gt; &gt; exactly sure what this
        "air mail" is since it's not the usual shipping &gt; &gt; that you pay
        for. I wonder if the screws are coming in a regular &gt; &gt; letter
        envelope via regular mail. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oy, I had high
        expectations for my 1st experience with Rubiks.com but &gt; &gt; they
        let me down. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm still waiting for the screws. &gt;

        Hello Everyone mike, thanks for the encouragement. i read your post and
        wondered about f2b 10.78, 12.87, 12.31, (23.53), 12.99, 12.65, 18.17,
        12.94, 11.17, 11.41, 13.18, (10.68) AVG 12.85 This is a pretty good
        improvement, but i wont be happy until i'm sub 10. On the 23.53, I had a
        really bad first b. For the 2nd block, i did both pairs first and then
        FORCED myself to do a new alg Gilles showed me. R' U' R2 U R2 U' R' y M'
        U2 M y' Ur'R'UM'U'R2 The last one is Gilles' Which one do you guys use?
        And Question 2, do you guys use (U R r M) only for B2? I almost
        exclusively use these subsets for B2. Because of this, I usually use the
        first algorithm Question 3. if you learn CLL or COLL instead of CMLL,
        then you dont have to have the cube oriented for step 3. In this case I
        think the 2nd alg is the best, b/c you don't have to do the last y'. Do
        you guys do Y rotations during F2B? i dont. Jason K --- In

        isn't everything. I broke the 25avg &gt; barrier by just optimising how

        slows me down, as I know 60% of it, but I'm &gt; not 'fluent' with every
        case I know yet. &gt; &gt; I think the F2B is the most important part,
        then comes LSEC and then &gt; CMLL :) Well, that in ordedr of how much I

        (19.97), 24.64, 20.55, 22.49, 24.03, (31.84), 28.37, 25.84, 24.72, &gt;

        &gt; &gt; times will drop substantially. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Jason k &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Way to go, Jason! It's good to see someone
        having success with &gt; &gt; something that isn't Fridrich. I've been
        working more on my variation &gt; &gt; for step 4 where you first place
        DB as you orient edges, and then &gt; &gt; permute the L5E. So far, it's
        very much like learning ZB. Right now, &gt; &gt; my average with pure
        Roux is around 20, but my normal average this way &gt; &gt; is about 22.
        My best times are 15.0x this way (non lucky), though, so &gt; &gt; it
        has very good spike times. I expect this number to grow &gt; &gt;
        substantially once I learn more algs. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One strategy
        I'm experimenting with that could be useful to you (or &gt; &gt; other
        Roux solvers) is learning both COLL and CLL. This would allow &gt; &gt;
        you O6E skips twice as often, and give you the three edges orientation
        &gt; &gt; for the majority of the rest of solves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Also, I've been trying to recognize the orientation before the end of
        &gt; &gt; step 2. If you save either the DL or DR edge piece for last,
        you can &gt; &gt; use it to help influence orientation to your liking.
        If you have a &gt; &gt; corner edge pair for last, you can use those
        too, with some intuitive &gt; &gt; ZBF2L. This is a little harder, but
        will be more useful in the end. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That said, learning
        one step algs for corners is going to help your &gt; &gt; times, but not
        all that much. The F2B and L6E steps are much more &gt; &gt; important.
        You can get very good times still using only two step algs &gt; &gt; for
        the corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Learning to use unconstrained centers
        and the special cases for step 4 &gt; &gt; will probably get you farther
        in the end than CLL. I say in the end &gt; &gt; because those are
        probably going to take a long time to get used to, &gt; &gt; but they
        will be worth it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Keep up the good work, and keep us
        posted! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike &gt; &gt; &gt;

        average just now, and I can't say I'm very happy with it. I wish it were
        a second or two less. 11.43, 9.26, 11.78, 13.62, (8.37), (15.14), 9.09,
        14.87, 10.90, 12.43, 13.01, 10.31 = 11.67 average I've learned two
        important things: The first, I'm terrible at building the F2B when there
        isn't an obvious start. I need to work on being more flexible. If there
        isn't a corner edge pair, I don't do as well. If one is there, though, I
        get good times. I also tend to hurry too much when I don't have a solid
        start planned. I need to work on slowing down and staying calm. Also, I
        make far too many rotations during my F2B. I generally build the first
        block in front, because it allows for easy RULMd algs. If I could learn
        to make the blocks on L and R I'm sure it could be faster. &gt; This is
        a pretty good improvement, but i wont be happy until i'm sub &gt; 10. On
        the 23.53, I had a really bad first b. For the 2nd block, i &gt; did
        both pairs first and then FORCED myself to do a new alg Gilles &gt;
        showed me. My goal for the F2B is sub-9. I know it can be done, and
        really shouldn't take all that much work. The trick is seeing my fewest
        moves solution in the 15 seconds... &gt; &gt; R' U' R2 U R2 U' R' &gt;
        &gt; y M' U2 M y' &gt; &gt; Ur'R'UM'U'R2 &gt; &gt; &gt; The last one is
        Gilles' &gt; Which one do you guys use? Wow. That's a great trick! I'm
        going to have to steal that. This leads to an interesting point. You can
        use the last pair or edge to influence the orientation to your liking,
        often avoiding that step altogether, and even more often achieving the
        easy 3 edges on top situation. It's not always as easy to see, because
        of the corners, but it can be done, I think. In the end, I would also
        like to be able to use tricks to influence either (or both) the edge
        orientation or the corner case. For 7/32 of cases, you can use what
        amounts to a VH or ZBF2L alg to orient the U edges only. For the other
        24 unoriented cases, you can try for a better orientation (such as the 3
        edges scenario). Also, has anyone looked into placing the UF and UB
        edges after orienting? A lot of times, this is much easier than trying
        for UL and UR, but I don't know if the decision between the two can be
        made fast enough. Using this and unconstrained centers (solving slowly,
        because I can't speedsolve that way yet), you can achieve almost optimal
        L6E solutions most of the time. I tried this for hours earlier and the
        nastiest case I found was 19 moves to fix. Only a few sub-10 though.
        Another thing to try is placing DB while orienting the edges. This can
        usually be done in 7 moves or less. After that, you're left with 5 edges
        to possibly permute. 1/5 of the time, it's a simple edge PLL, around
        1/10 of the time it's a 3 edge cycle in a slice, and the rest of the
        time, it's just two 3 cycles. The average using only MU moves is around
        7, but better if you're smart about solving the DB edge. Consulting my
        trusty list of algs for DB and placing using only a couple algs and some
        intuition, I averaged 13.9 moves to finish the edges this way. I imagine
        with the full list of L5E algs, and influencing orientation with the
        last pair or edge and the corners, this could be reduced to around 12.
        Perhaps less. Also, while I highly advocate using MU type algs, I've
        recently discovered some simple special cases that I think are useful to
        learn. When all but three pieces are placed and oriented, and two of the
        wrong pieces are flipped, you can always solve in &lt;10 moves. Usually,
        it's 8. The trick is to use commutators. As an example: M'UM D2 M'U'M
        D2. Does anyone else actively use algs like this? Anywho, that's about
        all the spiel I've got for now. Happy cubing. &gt; Jason K -Mike

        one do you guys use? The second one. But sometimes I do it with standing
        slices if I'm in an awkward position. and if the LD slice is at UR, I
        just use the standard 3-cycle from the LSE, part 3. I've got a good one
        for you, F (r U r' U')*3 F'. Try it :) &gt; In the end, I would also

        constrainging yourself to the standard 1x2x2 + corner edge (or any other
        formula). I do this most often, but not all the time, so It may do more
        harm than good. Unsure though :) &gt; Also, has anyone looked into
        placing the UF and UB edges after &gt; orienting? A lot of times, this
        is much easier than trying for UL and &gt; UR, but I don't know if the
        decision between the two can be made fast &gt; enough. Yeah, I've used
        all sorts of different stratergies. Placing DB and DB, UF and UB,
        leaving out the final U2 from the placing the UR and UL pieces and doing
        the last bit a usually a shorter number of moves. A thing I still use is
        if the ULB and ULF corners are solved after the first block, doing a z'
        and executing COLL (Not CMLL) on the corners and then shifting into the
        classic corners first senario. It's good to have little tricks like that
        under your sleeve for lucky cases. On last thing I still can't get right
        is the E2 M E2 alg. I can never get it under a second. What do you guys

        it :) Simple algs like that make me smile. Unfortunately, I can't see
        that one coming up in a solve very often. Do you use that one much? &gt;
        The problem with this is, You are constrainging yourself to the &gt;
        standard 1x2x2 + corner edge (or any other formula). I do this most &gt;
        often, but not all the time, so It may do more harm than good. Unsure
        &gt; though :) You can use similar trick for placing edges last. And you
        don't necessarily need to change the orientation. Often it's helpful to
        influence the corners. Think of the difference between U'RUR' and
        R'FRF'. &gt; Yeah, I've used all sorts of different stratergies. Placing
        DB and DB, &gt; UF and UB, leaving out the final U2 from the placing the
        UR and UL &gt; pieces and doing the last bit a usually a shorter number
        of moves. I'm pretty much placing DB while orienting edges almost all of
        the time now. It seems like a lot of algs to start with, but they're not
        so bad because they're short and mostly common sense. It feels great to
        get DB or DF placed after step 3, and see an easy 3 edges on top
        orientation. You can usually even work out the L5E step afterward to be
        a nice case based on which direction you orient that one from. &gt; A
        thing I still use is if the ULB and ULF corners are solved after the
        &gt; first block, doing a z' and executing COLL (Not CMLL) on the
        corners &gt; and then shifting into the classic corners first senario.
        It's good to &gt; have little tricks like that under your sleeve for
        lucky cases. I would try that, but my corners first times are all &gt;30
        on average. :( &gt; On last thing I still can't get right is the E2 M E2
        alg. I can never &gt; get it under a second. What do you guys do and how
        do you perform it? I avoid that one like the plague. It doesn't really
        come up very often the way I solve the L6E. Only about 1/30 of the times
        I get an O6E skip, which is about 1/32. 1 out of a little under 1,000
        solves. If I solve the normal Roux way, though, I hate getting that one.
        It probably takes me &gt;2 seconds on average. I used to do it as
        M'E2(push with right thumb twice)M/M'E2(push twice again). Now I've
        switched to doing it as M' and then double click the E' with my right
        index finger. The trick is to adjust your right middle finger during the
        M' turn, so that it's positioned on the B sticker of DBR (and right
        thumb on the F sticker of DFR). I've also tried doing the E2 as a wrist
        turn, but it's not as fast as the clicking once you get it down. &gt; ~

        David, I was about right where you are a month ago :). Get ready for
        some major improvements in speed when you take this next step. Basically
        you want the F2L right? What it does is it lets you insert a corner and
        its corresponding edge piece at the same time, allowing you to
        essentially do 2 layers at once. It depends on where you want the cross.
        Like the 1st step is always just to solve the cross. I choose to solve
        the cross on the bottom because then I'm looking for the F2L pairs on
        the top which is easier to see. Some people choose to hold the cross in
        the left hand but I don't really like that. I'm not saying you have to
        solve it on the bottom but whatever you prefer, the F2L methods vary
        depending on that. Anyways, F2L for beginners, I started with the
        algorithms on Speedcubing.com: http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that
        page allows you to choose the method for whatever side you prefer to
        solve the cross. The site's nice because it gives you a printable page
        of the algorithms with all of them on 1 single page so you can put it in
        your pocket and what not. Don't worry about the 3 look and 4 look yet
        until you've somewhat mastered the F2L. Those are methods to solving the
        last layer. I'm assuming that you learned how to do the last layer by
        first flipping the edges of the last layer up, moving them to their
        right places, then moving the corners to their right places and then
        individually flipping those up. Basically what these methods do is save
        you a lot of time and a lot of moves. Basically you can just flip all
        the pieces face up with 1 or 2 steps, and then move all the pieces to
        their right places with the last step. Learning this is essential if you
        want to cube in under 60 seconds although since there is much to
        memorize, I would first learn the F2L. The next step after you learn the
        F2L, is learning how to look ahead. Basically to become efficient at the
        F2L you must be able to find the next corner/edge pair while you're
        solving the 1st one. Like while you're doing the cross you find the 1st
        corner/edge pair and the moment you finish the cross you can go right
        into the F2L without delay. While you're putting that pair in place,
        look for the next pair, and the moment you're done with the 1st pair you
        can go right into the 2nd pair without delay. To do this you must slow
        down your F2L to give yourself time. Once you are able to look ahead,
        you can start to speed up. I don't know how to do it myself and I'm
        starting to try it just a few days ago but it's really hard. Does anyone
        have any tips for Matt and I? I just can't seem to do it. I'm slowing
        down but I'm still struggling to keep track of the pieces. Usually I've
        found either an edge or a corner, but I don't see the 2nd piece until
        after I finish inserting the current pair, which ruins the entire point
        really. Usually I see the pair but because of the nature of the F2L
        method I use, I think I know where it is but after I finish inserting
        the current pair, I find that the piece is actually somewhere on the
        bottom layer somewhere else. Phew that was long. Hope this helps you
        Matt and hope someone can help me! --- In

        F2L pairs is your definite next step. I was using your method &gt; and
        picked up Fridrich in manageable chunks using the following steps: &gt;
        &gt; I learned F2L pairs from Fridrich's site and stuck to the 4LLL
        until I had a &gt; consistent sub 30 time on F2L. F2L pairs is easy to
        learn on its own &gt; because you can set each algorithm up to practice
        quickly. I didn't move on &gt; from each algorithm until I really
        understood how it worked. That helps a &gt; ton in reducing your
        decision making time for each pair. &gt; &gt; Then I created a sort of 3
        look LL method by orienting edges first using my &gt; old method and
        using Fridrich to orient the corners and permute the LL. &gt; There are
        only 6 Fridrich LL orientation algorithms where all edges are &gt;
        already oriented, so it seemed like a good small chunk to learn, instead
        of &gt; trying to memorize all 41 or w/e at once. I had to break the
        Fridrich &gt; method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-)
        But I went from 3 &gt; min. solves using your method to sub 60 very
        quickly. &gt; &gt; - Matt &gt; &gt; &gt; On 1/6/06, Jasmine Lee

        got my average under 60s. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's possible to go much
        faster than 60s with 4-look LL. I've seen &gt; &gt; people do 30s solves
        with a 4-look LL! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you solving with F2L pairs? If
        not then I'd advise that would be a &gt; &gt; very valuable next step.
        F2L pairs are not that difficult to work out on &gt; &gt; your own and
        they'll really improve your solve times once you get the &gt; &gt; hang
        of them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, re working stuff out on your own (just
        referring to another &gt; &gt; discussion string on the group), I feel
        pretty strongly about this with &gt; &gt; regard to the F2L. Even now I

        looking at the cube at all, but instead just always knew exactly &gt;
        &gt; &gt; which algorithm to use instantly, I think the way I'm doing it

        &gt; &gt; any other thoughts? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And even so,
        I'll eventually want to start getting more &gt; &gt; &gt; advanced and
        using some of the methods that you guys use... the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        methods which allow you to do cubes in 20 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; For the time being, I'm looking for any methods which are &gt;

        Mellowfreezer: Thanks! I currently solve the cross on the top of the
        cube, but I think I know what you mean how it would be easier to solve
        the first two layers simultaneously if all of the work you were doing
        was not at the bottom of the cube. Do you think that most people do it
        the bottom way? If so, i would trust their judgement and learn to do it
        that way. For the time being, I guess i'll just start doing it your way.
        Those algorithms look really intimidating; right now i'm able to solve
        the cube using a total of i think 9 algorithms... but I guess i should
        just start memorizing them? How long is this supposed to take me? :-)
        Thanks David mellowfreezer &lt;djspazy@...&gt; wrote: David, I was about
        right where you are a month ago :). Get ready for some major
        improvements in speed when you take this next step. Basically you want
        the F2L right? What it does is it lets you insert a corner and its
        corresponding edge piece at the same time, allowing you to essentially
        do 2 layers at once. It depends on where you want the cross. Like the
        1st step is always just to solve the cross. I choose to solve the cross
        on the bottom because then I'm looking for the F2L pairs on the top
        which is easier to see. Some people choose to hold the cross in the left
        hand but I don't really like that. I'm not saying you have to solve it
        on the bottom but whatever you prefer, the F2L methods vary depending on
        that. Anyways, F2L for beginners, I started with the algorithms on
        Speedcubing.com: http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that page allows
        you to choose the method for whatever side you prefer to solve the
        cross. The site's nice because it gives you a printable page of the
        algorithms with all of them on 1 single page so you can put it in your
        pocket and what not. Don't worry about the 3 look and 4 look yet until
        you've somewhat mastered the F2L. Those are methods to solving the last
        layer. I'm assuming that you learned how to do the last layer by first
        flipping the edges of the last layer up, moving them to their right
        places, then moving the corners to their right places and then
        individually flipping those up. Basically what these methods do is save
        you a lot of time and a lot of moves. Basically you can just flip all
        the pieces face up with 1 or 2 steps, and then move all the pieces to
        their right places with the last step. Learning this is essential if you
        want to cube in under 60 seconds although since there is much to
        memorize, I would first learn the F2L. The next step after you learn the
        F2L, is learning how to look ahead. Basically to become efficient at the
        F2L you must be able to find the next corner/edge pair while you're
        solving the 1st one. Like while you're doing the cross you find the 1st
        corner/edge pair and the moment you finish the cross you can go right
        into the F2L without delay. While you're putting that pair in place,
        look for the next pair, and the moment you're done with the 1st pair you
        can go right into the 2nd pair without delay. To do this you must slow
        down your F2L to give yourself time. Once you are able to look ahead,
        you can start to speed up. I don't know how to do it myself and I'm
        starting to try it just a few days ago but it's really hard. Does anyone
        have any tips for Matt and I? I just can't seem to do it. I'm slowing
        down but I'm still struggling to keep track of the pieces. Usually I've
        found either an edge or a corner, but I don't see the 2nd piece until
        after I finish inserting the current pair, which ruins the entire point
        really. Usually I see the pair but because of the nature of the F2L
        method I use, I think I know where it is but after I finish inserting
        the current pair, I find that the piece is actually somewhere on the
        bottom layer somewhere else. Phew that was long. Hope this helps you
        Matt and hope someone can help me! --- In

        F2L pairs is your definite next step. I was using your method &gt; and
        picked up Fridrich in manageable chunks using the following steps: &gt;
        &gt; I learned F2L pairs from Fridrich's site and stuck to the 4LLL
        until I had a &gt; consistent sub 30 time on F2L. F2L pairs is easy to
        learn on its own &gt; because you can set each algorithm up to practice
        quickly. I didn't move on &gt; from each algorithm until I really
        understood how it worked. That helps a &gt; ton in reducing your
        decision making time for each pair. &gt; &gt; Then I created a sort of 3
        look LL method by orienting edges first using my &gt; old method and
        using Fridrich to orient the corners and permute the LL. &gt; There are
        only 6 Fridrich LL orientation algorithms where all edges are &gt;
        already oriented, so it seemed like a good small chunk to learn, instead
        of &gt; trying to memorize all 41 or w/e at once. I had to break the
        Fridrich &gt; method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-)
        But I went from 3 &gt; min. solves using your method to sub 60 very
        quickly. &gt; &gt; - Matt &gt; &gt; &gt; On 1/6/06, Jasmine Lee

        not then I'd advise that would be a &gt; &gt; very valuable next step.
        F2L pairs are not that difficult to work out on &gt; &gt; your own and
        they'll really improve your solve times once you get the &gt; &gt; hang

        referring to another &gt; &gt; discussion string on the group), I feel
        pretty strongly about this with &gt; &gt; regard to the F2L. Even now I

        Hey, not bad! I have only practiced it a little so far, and I just did
        it 4 times in a row in 10.63 seconds (with stopwatch). And on video I
        got a 2.00. My current top alg is still faster (9.89 and 1.67) but of
        course I've practiced that way more often. Thanks (also to Joel)! Stefan

        Like I said, it's all personal preference. The way I see it, you have to
        do the Last Layer face up anyways so if you do the cross on the top you
        still have to flip everything over sooner or later, why not just start
        with the cross on the bottom and save yourself a step. Yes 42 algorithms
        is a lot but take your time learning them thoroughly. Actually, just
        today someone showed me another F2L method which is a bit more
        efficient. =D http://cubewhiz.com/f2l.html I made it into a printable
        page using the graphics from the speedcubing.com site:
        http://home.comcast.net/~djspazy/rubiks/f2l.html For people like you and
        I, we just want to focus on the FR: of each case. That is solving for
        the pair in the Front Right corner of the cube. Basically you see those
        moves inside the ( ), those are triggers. You can do those moves really
        really quickly with just a flick of your wrist. I personally think this
        method is far more efficient and quick and actually, if you slow down to
        observe what's happening, the algorithm is actually pretty much
        intuitive. If you notice, most of the cases have a mirror case. Like you
        look case #25 on cubewhiz site, it's mirror is case number 38. So 25 the
        pieces were on the right, now 38 theyre on the left flipped over the
        diagonal of the cube. So in most cases, by learning one of the
        algorithms, chances are you will know its mirror and so you actually
        learn 2. But do not attempt to memorize them all in a week. Do perhaps 4
        a day on the weekdays, that's 20 which is a lot. Spend the week end
        reviewing all that you have learned. You don't want to learn them so
        fast that you end up forgetting them at the end. The point is to
        thoroughly learn them. The site also gives you algorithms for when the
        pair is in the FR: front left, BR: back right, BL: back left corner, but
        that is way too much memorization for now. In the future once you have
        mastered the FR, you might consider coming back to these because those
        are helpful in that you don't have to always rotate the cube so much to
        solve the FR corner. Once you identify a pair that goes in the BR
        corner, you don't have to rotate your cube so that the BR corner is in
        the FR position to solve it. Good luck. --- In

        currently solve the cross on the top of the cube, but I think I know
        what you mean how it would be easier to solve the first two layers
        simultaneously if all of the work you were doing was not at the bottom
        of the cube. Do you think that most people do it the bottom way? If so,
        i would trust their judgement and learn to do it that way. For the time
        being, I guess i'll just start doing it your way. &gt; &gt; Those
        algorithms look really intimidating; right now i'm able to solve the
        cube using a total of i think 9 algorithms... but I guess i should just
        start memorizing them? How long is this supposed to take me? :-) &gt;

        a month ago :). Get ready for &gt; some major improvements in speed when
        you take this next step. &gt; Basically you want the F2L right? What it
        does is it lets you insert a &gt; corner and its corresponding edge
        piece at the same time, allowing you &gt; to essentially do 2 layers at
        once. &gt; &gt; It depends on where you want the cross. Like the 1st
        step is always &gt; just to solve the cross. I choose to solve the cross
        on the bottom &gt; because then I'm looking for the F2L pairs on the top
        which is easier &gt; to see. Some people choose to hold the cross in the
        left hand but I &gt; don't really like that. I'm not saying you have to
        solve it on the &gt; bottom but whatever you prefer, the F2L methods
        vary depending on that. &gt; &gt; Anyways, F2L for beginners, I started
        with the algorithms on &gt; Speedcubing.com:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that page allows &gt; you to choose
        the method for whatever side you prefer to solve the &gt; cross. The
        site's nice because it gives you a printable page of the &gt; algorithms
        with all of them on 1 single page so you can put it in your &gt; pocket
        and what not. &gt; &gt; Don't worry about the 3 look and 4 look yet
        until you've somewhat &gt; mastered the F2L. Those are methods to
        solving the last layer. I'm &gt; assuming that you learned how to do the
        last layer by first flipping &gt; the edges of the last layer up, moving
        them to their right places, &gt; then moving the corners to their right
        places and then individually &gt; flipping those up. Basically what
        these methods do is save you a lot &gt; of time and a lot of moves.
        Basically you can just flip all the pieces &gt; face up with 1 or 2
        steps, and then move all the pieces to their right &gt; places with the
        last step. Learning this is essential if you want to &gt; cube in under
        60 seconds although since there is much to memorize, I &gt; would first
        learn the F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The next step after you learn
        the F2L, is learning how to look ahead. &gt; Basically to become
        efficient at the F2L you must be able to find the &gt; next corner/edge
        pair while you're solving the 1st one. Like while &gt; you're doing the
        cross you find the 1st corner/edge pair and the &gt; moment you finish
        the cross you can go right into the F2L without &gt; delay. While you're
        putting that pair in place, look for the next &gt; pair, and the moment
        you're done with the 1st pair you can go right &gt; into the 2nd pair
        without delay. To do this you must slow down your &gt; F2L to give
        yourself time. Once you are able to look ahead, you can &gt; start to
        speed up. &gt; &gt; I don't know how to do it myself and I'm starting to
        try it just a few &gt; days ago but it's really hard. Does anyone have
        any tips for Matt and &gt; I? I just can't seem to do it. I'm slowing
        down but I'm still &gt; struggling to keep track of the pieces. Usually
        I've found either an &gt; edge or a corner, but I don't see the 2nd
        piece until after I finish &gt; inserting the current pair, which ruins
        the entire point really. &gt; Usually I see the pair but because of the
        nature of the F2L method I &gt; use, I think I know where it is but
        after I finish inserting the &gt; current pair, I find that the piece is
        actually somewhere on the &gt; bottom layer somewhere else. &gt; &gt;
        Phew that was long. Hope this helps you Matt and hope someone can help
        me! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; &gt; Right on. F2L pairs is your definite next step. I was using
        your &gt; method &gt; &gt; and picked up Fridrich in manageable chunks
        using the following steps: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I learned F2L pairs from
        Fridrich's site and stuck to the 4LLL until &gt; I had a &gt; &gt;
        consistent sub 30 time on F2L. F2L pairs is easy to learn on its own
        &gt; &gt; because you can set each algorithm up to practice quickly. I
        didn't &gt; move on &gt; &gt; from each algorithm until I really
        understood how it worked. That &gt; helps a &gt; &gt; ton in reducing
        your decision making time for each pair. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then I
        created a sort of 3 look LL method by orienting edges first &gt; using
        my &gt; &gt; old method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and
        permute the LL. &gt; &gt; There are only 6 Fridrich LL orientation
        algorithms where all edges are &gt; &gt; already oriented, so it seemed
        like a good small chunk to learn, &gt; instead of &gt; &gt; trying to
        memorize all 41 or w/e at once. I had to break the Fridrich &gt; &gt;
        method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-) But I &gt;
        went from 3 &gt; &gt; min. solves using your method to sub 60 very
        quickly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Matt &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On

        &gt; &gt; Sub-60s is definitely possible with a 4-look LL. I used to
        solve &gt; with a &gt; &gt; &gt; 4-look LL and didn't really bother
        learning more LL algorithms until I &gt; &gt; &gt; got my average under
        60s. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's possible to go much faster than
        60s with 4-look LL. I've seen &gt; &gt; &gt; people do 30s solves with a
        4-look LL! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you solving with F2L pairs?
        If not then I'd advise that would be a &gt; &gt; &gt; very valuable next
        step. F2L pairs are not that difficult to work &gt; out on &gt; &gt;
        &gt; your own and they'll really improve your solve times once you get
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; hang of them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, re
        working stuff out on your own (just referring to another &gt; &gt; &gt;
        discussion string on the group), I feel pretty strongly about this &gt;
        with &gt; &gt; &gt; regard to the F2L. Even now I never use an F2L trick

        Ok, let me tell you the rules I use: Edge on top or bottom layer: if U/D
        color is on U/D, the edge is correct. If F/B color is NOT on U/D, the
        edge is correct. Edge on middle layer: if U/D color is on L/R, the edge
        is correct. If F/B color is on F/B, the edge is correct. Believe me,
        with practice it gets easy. Oh, and how do you solve the cube normally?
        Starting with which color? Depending on this, you should change your way
        to do BLD...I start with white cross, and yellow is my LL color, so I
        use yellow on top and blue on front. But it's all personal preference.

        Apparently it is not said enough: Do not learn F2L by heart !!! You can
        look at the algs to help you figure out the pairing process but the F2L

        preference. The way I see it, you have &gt; to do the Last Layer face up
        anyways so if you do the cross on the top &gt; you still have to flip
        everything over sooner or later, why not just &gt; start with the cross
        on the bottom and save yourself a step. &gt; &gt; Yes 42 algorithms is a
        lot but take your time learning them &gt; thoroughly. Actually, just
        today someone showed me another F2L method &gt; which is a bit more
        efficient. =D http://cubewhiz.com/f2l.html &gt; I made it into a
        printable page using the graphics from the &gt; speedcubing.com site:
        http://home.comcast.net/~djspazy/rubiks/f2l.html &gt; For people like
        you and I, we just want to focus on the FR: of each &gt; case. That is
        solving for the pair in the Front Right corner of the cube. &gt; &gt;
        Basically you see those moves inside the ( ), those are triggers. You
        &gt; can do those moves really really quickly with just a flick of your
        &gt; wrist. I personally think this method is far more efficient and
        quick &gt; and actually, if you slow down to observe what's happening,
        the &gt; algorithm is actually pretty much intuitive. &gt; &gt; If you
        notice, most of the cases have a mirror case. Like you look &gt; case
        #25 on cubewhiz site, it's mirror is case number 38. So 25 the &gt;
        pieces were on the right, now 38 theyre on the left flipped over the
        &gt; diagonal of the cube. So in most cases, by learning one of the &gt;
        algorithms, chances are you will know its mirror and so you actually
        &gt; learn 2. But do not attempt to memorize them all in a week. Do &gt;
        perhaps 4 a day on the weekdays, that's 20 which is a lot. Spend the
        &gt; week end reviewing all that you have learned. You don't want to
        learn &gt; them so fast that you end up forgetting them at the end. The
        point is &gt; to thoroughly learn them. &gt; &gt; The site also gives
        you algorithms for when the pair is in the FR: &gt; front left, BR: back
        right, BL: back left corner, but that is way too &gt; much memorization
        for now. In the future once you have mastered the &gt; FR, you might
        consider coming back to these because those are helpful &gt; in that you
        don't have to always rotate the cube so much to solve the &gt; FR
        corner. Once you identify a pair that goes in the BR corner, you &gt;
        don't have to rotate your cube so that the BR corner is in the FR &gt;
        position to solve it. &gt; &gt; Good luck. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        right where you are a month ago :). Get ready for &gt; &gt; some major
        improvements in speed when you take this next step. &gt; &gt; Basically
        you want the F2L right? What it does is it lets you insert a &gt; &gt;
        corner and its corresponding edge piece at the same time, allowing you
        &gt; &gt; to essentially do 2 layers at once. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It
        depends on where you want the cross. Like the 1st step is always &gt;
        &gt; just to solve the cross. I choose to solve the cross on the bottom
        &gt; &gt; because then I'm looking for the F2L pairs on the top which is
        easier &gt; &gt; to see. Some people choose to hold the cross in the
        left hand but I &gt; &gt; don't really like that. I'm not saying you
        have to solve it on the &gt; &gt; bottom but whatever you prefer, the
        F2L methods vary depending on that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyways, F2L for
        beginners, I started with the algorithms on &gt; &gt; Speedcubing.com:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that page allows &gt; &gt; you to
        choose the method for whatever side you prefer to solve the &gt; &gt;
        cross. The site's nice because it gives you a printable page of the &gt;
        &gt; algorithms with all of them on 1 single page so you can put it in
        your &gt; &gt; pocket and what not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't worry
        about the 3 look and 4 look yet until you've somewhat &gt; &gt; mastered
        the F2L. Those are methods to solving the last layer. I'm &gt; &gt;
        assuming that you learned how to do the last layer by first flipping
        &gt; &gt; the edges of the last layer up, moving them to their right
        places, &gt; &gt; then moving the corners to their right places and then
        individually &gt; &gt; flipping those up. Basically what these methods
        do is save you a lot &gt; &gt; of time and a lot of moves. Basically you
        can just flip all the pieces &gt; &gt; face up with 1 or 2 steps, and
        then move all the pieces to their right &gt; &gt; places with the last
        step. Learning this is essential if you want to &gt; &gt; cube in under
        60 seconds although since there is much to memorize, I &gt; &gt; would
        first learn the F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The next step after you learn the F2L, is learning how to look ahead.
        &gt; &gt; Basically to become efficient at the F2L you must be able to
        find the &gt; &gt; next corner/edge pair while you're solving the 1st
        one. Like while &gt; &gt; you're doing the cross you find the 1st
        corner/edge pair and the &gt; &gt; moment you finish the cross you can
        go right into the F2L without &gt; &gt; delay. While you're putting that
        pair in place, look for the next &gt; &gt; pair, and the moment you're
        done with the 1st pair you can go right &gt; &gt; into the 2nd pair
        without delay. To do this you must slow down your &gt; &gt; F2L to give
        yourself time. Once you are able to look ahead, you can &gt; &gt; start
        to speed up. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know how to do it myself and
        I'm starting to try it just a few &gt; &gt; days ago but it's really
        hard. Does anyone have any tips for Matt and &gt; &gt; I? I just can't
        seem to do it. I'm slowing down but I'm still &gt; &gt; struggling to
        keep track of the pieces. Usually I've found either an &gt; &gt; edge or
        a corner, but I don't see the 2nd piece until after I finish &gt; &gt;
        inserting the current pair, which ruins the entire point really. &gt;
        &gt; Usually I see the pair but because of the nature of the F2L method
        I &gt; &gt; use, I think I know where it is but after I finish inserting
        the &gt; &gt; current pair, I find that the piece is actually somewhere
        on the &gt; &gt; bottom layer somewhere else. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Phew
        that was long. Hope this helps you Matt and hope someone can &gt; help

        &gt; Right on. F2L pairs is your definite next step. I was using your
        &gt; &gt; method &gt; &gt; &gt; and picked up Fridrich in manageable
        chunks using the following steps: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        learned F2L pairs from Fridrich's site and stuck to the 4LLL until &gt;
        &gt; I had a &gt; &gt; &gt; consistent sub 30 time on F2L. F2L pairs is
        easy to learn on its own &gt; &gt; &gt; because you can set each
        algorithm up to practice quickly. I didn't &gt; &gt; move on &gt; &gt;
        &gt; from each algorithm until I really understood how it worked. That
        &gt; &gt; helps a &gt; &gt; &gt; ton in reducing your decision making
        time for each pair. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then I created a sort
        of 3 look LL method by orienting edges first &gt; &gt; using my &gt;
        &gt; &gt; old method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and
        permute &gt; the LL. &gt; &gt; &gt; There are only 6 Fridrich LL
        orientation algorithms where all &gt; edges are &gt; &gt; &gt; already
        oriented, so it seemed like a good small chunk to learn, &gt; &gt;
        instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to memorize all 41 or w/e at once. I
        had to break the Fridrich &gt; &gt; &gt; method into reasonable chunks
        to keep from giving up. :-) But I &gt; &gt; went from 3 &gt; &gt; &gt;
        min. solves using your method to sub 60 very quickly. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sub-60s is definitely possible with a 4-look LL. I

        really bother learning more LL algorithms &gt; until I &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; got my average under 60s. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        It's possible to go much faster than 60s with 4-look LL. I've seen &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you solving with F2L pairs? If not then I'd
        advise that &gt; would be a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very valuable next step.
        F2L pairs are not that difficult to work &gt; &gt; out on &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; your own and they'll really improve your solve times once you &gt;

        &gt; &gt; BTW, re working stuff out on your own (just referring to
        another &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion string on the group), I feel
        pretty strongly about this &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regard to
        the F2L. Even now I never use an F2L trick unless I &gt; &gt; understand
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly how it works. :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you sure? It seems like it would
        be absolutely ridiculous to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cut down the time
        that much. Even if I did no thinking or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking
        at the cube at all, but instead just always knew exactly &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; which algorithm to use instantly, I think the way I'm doing it
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now would still take over a minute... &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any other thoughts? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And even so, I'll eventually
        want to start getting more &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advanced and using
        some of the methods that you guys use... the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        methods which allow you to do cubes in 20 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the time being, I'm looking for any
        methods which are &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slightly faster than my
        current method, but I'd rather not try &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn
        any of the hardest methods first. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me know.. thanks! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Jason, you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said that I should learn the ROUx

        [1]http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        learning the method there? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I am just getting to the point where I can solve the cube &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; consistently without having to look at any references
        (thanks to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the help provided by many of you who
        have answered my questions &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the past few
        days). My method is: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Solve first 2 layers &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Solve the cross of the bottom layer &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; -Get the LL corners in the right place &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; -Get the LL corners rotated correctly &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        -Switch any incorrect corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I am starting to get pretty good at this, but I know there is
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little I can do besides getting faster with my
        algorithms and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cutting down time doing the
        first layer. I can do it in about 4 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes
        usually, but I want to start learning more advanced &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; methods. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not
        looking to be the best cuber ever or anything, but I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; would like to at least get my average down to 90 seconds or 2 &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; What are the most common methods that you guys use, how &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult are they to learn and use, and how fast
        are they? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thanks!!

        But the site makes so much sense! It practically gives you the intuitive
        steps! Well actually I'm beginning to see your point. I'm experimenting
        with the F2L myself only occasionally glancing at the site. I am already

        personal preference. The way I see it, you have &gt; &gt; to do the Last
        Layer face up anyways so if you do the cross on the top &gt; &gt; you
        still have to flip everything over sooner or later, why not just &gt;
        &gt; start with the cross on the bottom and save yourself a step. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes 42 algorithms is a lot but take your time learning
        them &gt; &gt; thoroughly. Actually, just today someone showed me
        another F2L method &gt; &gt; which is a bit more efficient. =D
        http://cubewhiz.com/f2l.html &gt; &gt; I made it into a printable page
        using the graphics from the &gt; &gt; speedcubing.com site:
        http://home.comcast.net/~djspazy/rubiks/f2l.html &gt; &gt; For people
        like you and I, we just want to focus on the FR: of each &gt; &gt; case.
        That is solving for the pair in the Front Right corner of the &gt; cube.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically you see those moves inside the ( ), those
        are triggers. You &gt; &gt; can do those moves really really quickly
        with just a flick of your &gt; &gt; wrist. I personally think this
        method is far more efficient and quick &gt; &gt; and actually, if you
        slow down to observe what's happening, the &gt; &gt; algorithm is
        actually pretty much intuitive. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you notice, most
        of the cases have a mirror case. Like you look &gt; &gt; case #25 on
        cubewhiz site, it's mirror is case number 38. So 25 the &gt; &gt; pieces
        were on the right, now 38 theyre on the left flipped over the &gt; &gt;
        diagonal of the cube. So in most cases, by learning one of the &gt; &gt;
        algorithms, chances are you will know its mirror and so you actually
        &gt; &gt; learn 2. But do not attempt to memorize them all in a week. Do
        &gt; &gt; perhaps 4 a day on the weekdays, that's 20 which is a lot.
        Spend the &gt; &gt; week end reviewing all that you have learned. You
        don't want to learn &gt; &gt; them so fast that you end up forgetting
        them at the end. The point is &gt; &gt; to thoroughly learn them. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; The site also gives you algorithms for when the pair is
        in the FR: &gt; &gt; front left, BR: back right, BL: back left corner,
        but that is way too &gt; &gt; much memorization for now. In the future
        once you have mastered the &gt; &gt; FR, you might consider coming back
        to these because those are helpful &gt; &gt; in that you don't have to
        always rotate the cube so much to solve the &gt; &gt; FR corner. Once
        you identify a pair that goes in the BR corner, you &gt; &gt; don't have
        to rotate your cube so that the BR corner is in the FR &gt; &gt;
        position to solve it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Mellowfreezer: Thanks! I currently solve the cross on the top of

        easier to solve &gt; &gt; the first two layers simultaneously if all of
        the work you were doing &gt; &gt; was not at the bottom of the cube. Do
        you think that most people do it &gt; &gt; the bottom way? If so, i
        would trust their judgement and learn to do &gt; &gt; it that way. For
        the time being, I guess i'll just start doing it your &gt; &gt; way.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those algorithms look really intimidating;
        right now i'm able to &gt; &gt; solve the cube using a total of i think
        9 algorithms... but I guess i &gt; &gt; should just start memorizing
        them? How long is this supposed to take &gt; &gt; me? :-) &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; David, I was about right where you are a month ago :).
        Get ready for &gt; &gt; &gt; some major improvements in speed when you
        take this next step. &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically you want the F2L right?
        What it does is it lets you insert a &gt; &gt; &gt; corner and its
        corresponding edge piece at the same time, allowing you &gt; &gt; &gt;
        to essentially do 2 layers at once. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It
        depends on where you want the cross. Like the 1st step is always &gt;
        &gt; &gt; just to solve the cross. I choose to solve the cross on the
        bottom &gt; &gt; &gt; because then I'm looking for the F2L pairs on the
        top which is easier &gt; &gt; &gt; to see. Some people choose to hold
        the cross in the left hand but I &gt; &gt; &gt; don't really like that.
        I'm not saying you have to solve it on the &gt; &gt; &gt; bottom but
        whatever you prefer, the F2L methods vary depending on &gt; that. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyways, F2L for beginners, I started with the
        algorithms on &gt; &gt; &gt; Speedcubing.com:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that page allows &gt; &gt; &gt; you
        to choose the method for whatever side you prefer to solve the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; cross. The site's nice because it gives you a printable page of the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms with all of them on 1 single page so you can
        put it in your &gt; &gt; &gt; pocket and what not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Don't worry about the 3 look and 4 look yet until you've
        somewhat &gt; &gt; &gt; mastered the F2L. Those are methods to solving
        the last layer. I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; assuming that you learned how to do
        the last layer by first flipping &gt; &gt; &gt; the edges of the last
        layer up, moving them to their right places, &gt; &gt; &gt; then moving
        the corners to their right places and then individually &gt; &gt; &gt;
        flipping those up. Basically what these methods do is save you a lot
        &gt; &gt; &gt; of time and a lot of moves. Basically you can just flip
        all the pieces &gt; &gt; &gt; face up with 1 or 2 steps, and then move
        all the pieces to their right &gt; &gt; &gt; places with the last step.
        Learning this is essential if you want to &gt; &gt; &gt; cube in under
        60 seconds although since there is much to memorize, I &gt; &gt; &gt;
        would first learn the F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The next step after you learn the F2L, is
        learning how to look ahead. &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically to become efficient
        at the F2L you must be able to find the &gt; &gt; &gt; next corner/edge
        pair while you're solving the 1st one. Like while &gt; &gt; &gt; you're
        doing the cross you find the 1st corner/edge pair and the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        moment you finish the cross you can go right into the F2L without &gt;
        &gt; &gt; delay. While you're putting that pair in place, look for the
        next &gt; &gt; &gt; pair, and the moment you're done with the 1st pair
        you can go right &gt; &gt; &gt; into the 2nd pair without delay. To do
        this you must slow down your &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L to give yourself time.
        Once you are able to look ahead, you can &gt; &gt; &gt; start to speed
        up. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know how to do it myself and
        I'm starting to try it just a few &gt; &gt; &gt; days ago but it's
        really hard. Does anyone have any tips for Matt and &gt; &gt; &gt; I? I
        just can't seem to do it. I'm slowing down but I'm still &gt; &gt; &gt;
        struggling to keep track of the pieces. Usually I've found either an
        &gt; &gt; &gt; edge or a corner, but I don't see the 2nd piece until
        after I finish &gt; &gt; &gt; inserting the current pair, which ruins
        the entire point really. &gt; &gt; &gt; Usually I see the pair but
        because of the nature of the F2L method I &gt; &gt; &gt; use, I think I
        know where it is but after I finish inserting the &gt; &gt; &gt; current
        pair, I find that the piece is actually somewhere on the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        bottom layer somewhere else. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Phew that was
        long. Hope this helps you Matt and hope someone can &gt; &gt; help me!

        Jasmine/Matt -- at the moment, I solve the first layer and second &gt;
        &gt; &gt; layer seperately. I took a look at a couple sites, but I'm not
        sure &gt; &gt; &gt; which one to use... they seem a little difficult to
        follow. Any &gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions for what sites I should visit for
        learning how to solve &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L pairs? Please provide links
        beacuse I am not familiar with any of &gt; &gt; &gt; the names of sites.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, what is meant by a "4 look
        method" or a "3 look method", &gt; etc? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Thanks! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David &gt;

        &gt; Right on. F2L pairs is your definite next step. I was using your
        &gt; &gt; &gt; method &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and picked up Fridrich in
        manageable chunks using the following &gt; steps: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I learned F2L pairs from Fridrich's site and stuck
        to the 4LLL until &gt; &gt; &gt; I had a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistent
        sub 30 time on F2L. F2L pairs is easy to learn on &gt; its own &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; because you can set each algorithm up to practice quickly. I
        didn't &gt; &gt; &gt; move on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from each algorithm
        until I really understood how it worked. That &gt; &gt; &gt; helps a
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ton in reducing your decision making time for each
        pair. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then I created a sort of 3
        look LL method by orienting edges first &gt; &gt; &gt; using my &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; old method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and
        permute &gt; &gt; the LL. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are only 6 Fridrich
        LL orientation algorithms where all &gt; &gt; edges are &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; already oriented, so it seemed like a good small chunk to learn,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to memorize all 41
        or w/e at once. I had to break the &gt; Fridrich &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-) But I &gt;
        &gt; &gt; went from 3 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; min. solves using your method
        to sub 60 very quickly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Matt

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sub-60s is definitely possible with a 4-look LL. I
        used to solve &gt; &gt; &gt; with a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4-look LL
        and didn't really bother learning more LL algorithms &gt; &gt; until I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got my average under 60s. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's possible to go much faster than 60s
        with 4-look LL. I've seen &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people do 30s solves
        with a 4-look LL! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are
        you solving with F2L pairs? If not then I'd advise that &gt; &gt; would
        be a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very valuable next step. F2L pairs are not
        that difficult to work &gt; &gt; &gt; out on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        your own and they'll really improve your solve times once you &gt; &gt;
        get the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hang of them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, re working stuff out on your own (just
        referring to another &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion string on the
        group), I feel pretty strongly about this &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; regard to the F2L. Even now I never use an F2L trick
        unless I &gt; &gt; &gt; understand &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly how
        it works. :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jasmine

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you sure? It seems like it would be absolutely
        ridiculous to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cut down the time that much.
        Even if I did no thinking or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking at
        the cube at all, but instead just always knew exactly &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; which algorithm to use instantly, I think the way I'm
        doing it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now would still take over a
        minute... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        any other thoughts? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; And even so, I'll eventually want to start getting more &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advanced and using some of the methods that you
        guys use... the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods which allow you to
        do cubes in 20 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; For the time being, I'm looking for any methods which are
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slightly faster than my current method,
        but I'd rather not try &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn any of the
        hardest methods first. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Let me know.. thanks! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; with that method you use now, you could get less than 60 seconds

        [1]http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; learning the method there? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just getting to the point where I can solve the
        cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistently without having to look
        at any references (thanks to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the help
        provided by many of you who have answered my questions &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; in the past few days). My method is: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; -Solve first 2 layers &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Solve the
        cross of the bottom layer &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Get the LL
        corners in the right place &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Get the LL
        corners rotated correctly &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Switch any
        incorrect corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I am starting to get pretty good at this, but I know there is &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little I can do besides getting faster with my
        algorithms and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cutting down time doing the
        first layer. I can do it in about 4 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        minutes usually, but I want to start learning more advanced &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not looking to be the best cuber ever or
        anything, but I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would like to at least get
        my average down to 90 seconds or 2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        minutes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        What are the most common methods that you guys use, how &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult are they to learn and use, and how fast are
        they? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        then I was told otherwise...and now I know intuitive...its much
        better...you get used to the cases too so you are pretty much executing

        won't use Empty Slots and other fun stuff...but you know...go
        ahead...learn algs and take &gt;40 moves for F2L every solve...have fun

        It practically gives you the &gt; intuitive steps! Well actually I'm
        beginning to see your point. I'm &gt; experimenting with the F2L myself
        only occasionally glancing at the &gt; site. I am already beginning to
        see what to do without having even &gt; memorized any algorithms. &gt;

        it's all personal preference. The way I see it, you have &gt; &gt; &gt;
        to do the Last Layer face up anyways so if you do the cross on the top
        &gt; &gt; &gt; you still have to flip everything over sooner or later,
        why not just &gt; &gt; &gt; start with the cross on the bottom and save
        yourself a step. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes 42 algorithms is a
        lot but take your time learning them &gt; &gt; &gt; thoroughly.
        Actually, just today someone showed me another F2L method &gt; &gt; &gt;
        which is a bit more efficient. =D http://cubewhiz.com/f2l.html &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I made it into a printable page using the graphics from the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; speedcubing.com site:
        http://home.comcast.net/~djspazy/rubiks/f2l.html &gt; &gt; &gt; For
        people like you and I, we just want to focus on the FR: of each &gt;
        &gt; &gt; case. That is solving for the pair in the Front Right corner
        of the &gt; &gt; cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically you see
        those moves inside the ( ), those are triggers. You &gt; &gt; &gt; can
        do those moves really really quickly with just a flick of your &gt; &gt;
        &gt; wrist. I personally think this method is far more efficient and
        quick &gt; &gt; &gt; and actually, if you slow down to observe what's
        happening, the &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithm is actually pretty much
        intuitive. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you notice, most of the
        cases have a mirror case. Like you look &gt; &gt; &gt; case #25 on
        cubewhiz site, it's mirror is case number 38. So 25 the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        pieces were on the right, now 38 theyre on the left flipped over the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; diagonal of the cube. So in most cases, by learning one
        of the &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms, chances are you will know its mirror
        and so you actually &gt; &gt; &gt; learn 2. But do not attempt to
        memorize them all in a week. Do &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps 4 a day on the
        weekdays, that's 20 which is a lot. Spend the &gt; &gt; &gt; week end
        reviewing all that you have learned. You don't want to learn &gt; &gt;
        &gt; them so fast that you end up forgetting them at the end. The point
        is &gt; &gt; &gt; to thoroughly learn them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; The site also gives you algorithms for when the pair is in the FR:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; front left, BR: back right, BL: back left corner, but
        that is way too &gt; &gt; &gt; much memorization for now. In the future
        once you have mastered the &gt; &gt; &gt; FR, you might consider coming
        back to these because those are helpful &gt; &gt; &gt; in that you don't
        have to always rotate the cube so much to solve the &gt; &gt; &gt; FR
        corner. Once you identify a pair that goes in the BR corner, you &gt;
        &gt; &gt; don't have to rotate your cube so that the BR corner is in the
        FR &gt; &gt; &gt; position to solve it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Good luck. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Mellowfreezer: Thanks! I currently solve the cross on the top of
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; cube, but I think I know what you mean how it would
        be easier to solve &gt; &gt; &gt; the first two layers simultaneously if
        all of the work you were doing &gt; &gt; &gt; was not at the bottom of
        the cube. Do you think that most people do it &gt; &gt; &gt; the bottom
        way? If so, i would trust their judgement and learn to do &gt; &gt; &gt;
        it that way. For the time being, I guess i'll just start doing it your
        &gt; &gt; &gt; way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those
        algorithms look really intimidating; right now i'm able to &gt; &gt;
        &gt; solve the cube using a total of i think 9 algorithms... but I guess
        i &gt; &gt; &gt; should just start memorizing them? How long is this
        supposed to take &gt; &gt; &gt; me? :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        where you are a month ago :). Get &gt; ready for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        some major improvements in speed when you take this next step. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Basically you want the F2L right? What it does is it lets you
        &gt; insert a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corner and its corresponding edge
        piece at the same time, &gt; allowing you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
        essentially do 2 layers at once. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        It depends on where you want the cross. Like the 1st step is always &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; just to solve the cross. I choose to solve the cross on
        the bottom &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because then I'm looking for the F2L
        pairs on the top which is &gt; easier &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see. Some
        people choose to hold the cross in the left hand but I &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; don't really like that. I'm not saying you have to solve it on the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottom but whatever you prefer, the F2L methods vary
        depending on &gt; &gt; that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Anyways, F2L for beginners, I started with the algorithms on &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Speedcubing.com: http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that page
        &gt; allows &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you to choose the method for whatever
        side you prefer to solve the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cross. The site's nice
        because it gives you a printable page of the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        algorithms with all of them on 1 single page so you can put it &gt; in
        your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pocket and what not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't worry about the 3 look and 4 look yet until you've
        somewhat &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mastered the F2L. Those are methods to
        solving the last layer. I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assuming that you
        learned how to do the last layer by first flipping &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        the edges of the last layer up, moving them to their right places, &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; then moving the corners to their right places and then
        individually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flipping those up. Basically what these
        methods do is save you a lot &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of time and a lot of
        moves. Basically you can just flip all the &gt; pieces &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; face up with 1 or 2 steps, and then move all the pieces to their
        &gt; right &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; places with the last step. Learning this
        is essential if you want to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cube in under 60 seconds
        although since there is much to memorize, I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would
        first learn the F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The next step after
        you learn the F2L, is learning how to look &gt; ahead. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Basically to become efficient at the F2L you must be able to &gt;
        find the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next corner/edge pair while you're solving
        the 1st one. Like while &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you're doing the cross you
        find the 1st corner/edge pair and the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment you
        finish the cross you can go right into the F2L without &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; delay. While you're putting that pair in place, look for the next
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair, and the moment you're done with the 1st pair
        you can go right &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the 2nd pair without delay. To
        do this you must slow down your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L to give yourself
        time. Once you are able to look ahead, you can &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start
        to speed up. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know how to
        do it myself and I'm starting to try it just &gt; a few &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; days ago but it's really hard. Does anyone have any tips for &gt;
        Matt and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I? I just can't seem to do it. I'm slowing
        down but I'm still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; struggling to keep track of the
        pieces. Usually I've found either an &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edge or a
        corner, but I don't see the 2nd piece until after I finish &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; inserting the current pair, which ruins the entire point
        really. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usually I see the pair but because of the
        nature of the F2L method I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use, I think I know where
        it is but after I finish inserting the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; current pair,
        I find that the piece is actually somewhere on the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        bottom layer somewhere else. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Phew that was long. Hope this helps you Matt and hope someone can &gt;
        &gt; &gt; help me! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right on. F2L pairs is your definite next step.
        I was &gt; using your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; and picked up Fridrich in manageable chunks using the following
        &gt; &gt; steps: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        learned F2L pairs from Fridrich's site and stuck to the 4LLL &gt; until
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistent sub 30
        time on F2L. F2L pairs is easy to learn on &gt; &gt; its own &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; because you can set each algorithm up to practice
        quickly. I &gt; didn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; from each algorithm until I really understood how it worked. That
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helps a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ton in reducing
        your decision making time for each pair. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then I created a sort of 3 look LL method by
        orienting edges first &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; old method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and permute
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the LL. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are only 6
        Fridrich LL orientation algorithms where all &gt; &gt; &gt; edges are
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already oriented, so it seemed like a good
        small chunk to learn, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; trying to memorize all 41 or w/e at once. I had to break the &gt;
        &gt; Fridrich &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method into reasonable chunks to
        keep from giving up. :-) But I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went from 3 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; min. solves using your method to sub 60 very quickly.

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sub-60s is definitely possible with a
        4-look LL. I used to &gt; solve &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4-look LL and didn't really bother learning more LL
        algorithms &gt; &gt; &gt; until I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got my
        average under 60s. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; It's possible to go much faster than 60s with 4-look LL. &gt;
        I've seen &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people do 30s solves with a
        4-look LL! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Are you solving with F2L pairs? If not then I'd advise that &gt; &gt;
        &gt; would be a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very valuable next step.
        F2L pairs are not that difficult to &gt; work &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out on
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your own and they'll really improve your
        solve times once you &gt; &gt; &gt; get the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; hang of them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; BTW, re working stuff out on your own (just referring to
        another &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion string on the group), I
        feel pretty strongly &gt; about this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regard to the F2L. Even now I never use an F2L trick
        unless I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        exactly how it works. :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        have answered my &gt; questions &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in
        the past few days). My method is: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        -Solve first 2 layers &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Solve the
        cross of the bottom layer &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Get the LL
        corners in the right place &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Get the
        LL corners rotated correctly &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Switch
        any incorrect corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am starting to get pretty good at this, but I know
        &gt; there is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little I can do besides
        getting faster with my algorithms and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        cutting down time doing the first layer. I can do it in &gt; about 4
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes usually, but I want to start
        learning more advanced &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not
        looking to be the best cuber ever or anything, but I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; would like to at least get my average down to 90 seconds
        or 2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are the most
        common methods that you guys use, how &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        difficult are they to learn and use, and how fast are they? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thanks!!

        Oh its you, hahahaha I did what you told me not to do. But the thing is,
        for beginners, the F2L isn't exactly intuitive if you've never done it
        before. At least get some experience, some sense of the F2L before you
        go and experiment on your own. True, I don't know how use empty slots,
        as a matter of fact I don't even know what it is, but I still wouldn't
        be able to even if I hadn't looked at the site. Haha if the F2L was
        intuitive without looking at algorithms, then solving the rubik's cube
        wouldn't be very special because everyone would be able to do it. Btw, I
        am very interested to hear about how to do the F2L in under 40 moves o.O

        you know...go ahead...learn algs and take &gt;40 moves for &gt; F2L

        &gt; Like I said, it's all personal preference. The way I see it, you
        &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do the Last Layer face up anyways so if
        you do the cross on &gt; the top &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you still have to
        flip everything over sooner or later, why not just &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        start with the cross on the bottom and save yourself a step. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes 42 algorithms is a lot but take your
        time learning them &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoroughly. Actually, just today
        someone showed me another F2L &gt; method &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is a
        bit more efficient. =D http://cubewhiz.com/f2l.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I made it into a printable page using the graphics from the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; speedcubing.com site: &gt;
        http://home.comcast.net/~djspazy/rubiks/f2l.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For
        people like you and I, we just want to focus on the FR: of each &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; case. That is solving for the pair in the Front Right
        corner of the &gt; &gt; &gt; cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Basically you see those moves inside the ( ), those are &gt;
        triggers. You &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can do those moves really really
        quickly with just a flick of your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrist. I
        personally think this method is far more efficient and &gt; quick &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; and actually, if you slow down to observe what's
        happening, the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithm is actually pretty much
        intuitive. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you notice, most
        of the cases have a mirror case. Like you look &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case
        #25 on cubewhiz site, it's mirror is case number 38. So 25 the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; pieces were on the right, now 38 theyre on the left flipped
        over the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diagonal of the cube. So in most cases, by
        learning one of the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms, chances are you will
        know its mirror and so you actually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learn 2. But do
        not attempt to memorize them all in a week. Do &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        perhaps 4 a day on the weekdays, that's 20 which is a lot. Spend the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; week end reviewing all that you have learned. You
        don't want to &gt; learn &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them so fast that you end
        up forgetting them at the end. The &gt; point is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
        thoroughly learn them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The site
        also gives you algorithms for when the pair is in the FR: &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; front left, BR: back right, BL: back left corner, but that is &gt;
        way too &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much memorization for now. In the future
        once you have mastered the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FR, you might consider
        coming back to these because those are &gt; helpful &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        in that you don't have to always rotate the cube so much to &gt; solve
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FR corner. Once you identify a pair that goes in
        the BR corner, you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't have to rotate your cube so
        that the BR corner is in the FR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position to solve
        it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Mellowfreezer: Thanks! I currently solve the cross on the top
        &gt; of the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cube, but I think I know what you mean
        how it would be easier to &gt; solve &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first two
        layers simultaneously if all of the work you were &gt; doing &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; was not at the bottom of the cube. Do you think that most
        people &gt; do it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the bottom way? If so, i would
        trust their judgement and learn to do &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it that way.
        For the time being, I guess i'll just start doing &gt; it your &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those
        algorithms look really intimidating; right now i'm able to &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; solve the cube using a total of i think 9 algorithms... but I
        &gt; guess i &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should just start memorizing them? How
        long is this supposed to take &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me? :-) &gt; &gt; &gt;

        improvements in speed when you take this next step. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Basically you want the F2L right? What it does is it lets you &gt;
        &gt; insert a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corner and its corresponding edge
        piece at the same time, &gt; &gt; allowing you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        to essentially do 2 layers at once. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; It depends on where you want the cross. Like the 1st step
        is &gt; always &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just to solve the cross. I
        choose to solve the cross on the bottom &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because
        then I'm looking for the F2L pairs on the top which is &gt; &gt; easier
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see. Some people choose to hold the cross in
        the left hand &gt; but I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't really like
        that. I'm not saying you have to solve it on the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; bottom but whatever you prefer, the F2L methods vary depending on
        &gt; &gt; &gt; that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Anyways, F2L for beginners, I started with the algorithms on &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Speedcubing.com: http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that
        page &gt; &gt; allows &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you to choose the method
        for whatever side you prefer to solve the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        cross. The site's nice because it gives you a printable page &gt; of the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms with all of them on 1 single page so
        you can put it &gt; &gt; in your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pocket and
        what not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't worry
        about the 3 look and 4 look yet until you've somewhat &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; mastered the F2L. Those are methods to solving the last layer.
        I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assuming that you learned how to do the
        last layer by first &gt; flipping &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the edges of
        the last layer up, moving them to their right places, &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; then moving the corners to their right places and then &gt;
        individually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flipping those up. Basically what
        these methods do is save you &gt; a lot &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of time
        and a lot of moves. Basically you can just flip all the &gt; &gt; pieces
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; face up with 1 or 2 steps, and then move all
        the pieces to their &gt; &gt; right &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; places with
        the last step. Learning this is essential if you &gt; want to &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; cube in under 60 seconds although since there is much to
        &gt; memorize, I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would first learn the F2L.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The next step
        after you learn the F2L, is learning how to look &gt; &gt; ahead. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically to become efficient at the F2L you must be
        able to &gt; &gt; find the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next corner/edge
        pair while you're solving the 1st one. Like while &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; you're doing the cross you find the 1st corner/edge pair and the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment you finish the cross you can go right
        into the F2L without &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delay. While you're
        putting that pair in place, look for the next &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        pair, and the moment you're done with the 1st pair you can go &gt; right
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the 2nd pair without delay. To do this you
        must slow down &gt; your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L to give yourself
        time. Once you are able to look ahead, &gt; you can &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; start to speed up. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I don't know how to do it myself and I'm starting to try it just
        &gt; &gt; a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; days ago but it's really hard.
        Does anyone have any tips for &gt; &gt; Matt and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I? I just can't seem to do it. I'm slowing down but I'm still &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; struggling to keep track of the pieces. Usually I've
        found &gt; either an &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edge or a corner, but I
        don't see the 2nd piece until after I &gt; finish &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; inserting the current pair, which ruins the entire point really.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usually I see the pair but because of the
        nature of the F2L &gt; method I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use, I think I
        know where it is but after I finish inserting the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; current pair, I find that the piece is actually somewhere on the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottom layer somewhere else. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Phew that was long. Hope this helps
        you Matt and hope someone can &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help me! &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Right on. F2L pairs is your definite next step. I was &gt; &gt;
        using your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        and picked up Fridrich in manageable chunks using the following &gt;
        &gt; &gt; steps: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I learned F2L pairs from Fridrich's site and stuck to the 4LLL &gt;
        &gt; until &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; consistent sub 30 time on F2L. F2L pairs is easy to learn on &gt;
        &gt; &gt; its own &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because you can set each
        algorithm up to practice quickly. I &gt; &gt; didn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; move on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from each algorithm until I
        really understood how it worked. &gt; That &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        helps a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ton in reducing your decision
        making time for each pair. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Then I created a sort of 3 look LL method by orienting
        edges &gt; first &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; old method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and
        permute &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the LL. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There
        are only 6 Fridrich LL orientation algorithms where all &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; edges are &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already oriented, so it
        seemed like a good small chunk to learn, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to memorize all 41 or
        w/e at once. I had to break the &gt; &gt; &gt; Fridrich &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-)
        But I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went from 3 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        min. solves using your method to sub 60 very quickly. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sub-60s is definitely

        &gt; with a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4-look LL and didn't
        really bother learning more LL algorithms &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got my average under 60s. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's
        possible to go much faster than 60s with 4-look LL. &gt; &gt; I've seen
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people do 30s solves with a 4-look
        LL! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Are you solving with F2L pairs? If not then I'd advise that &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; would be a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very
        valuable next step. F2L pairs are not that difficult to &gt; &gt; work
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your
        own and they'll really improve your solve times once you &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; get the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hang of them. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, re
        working stuff out on your own (just referring to &gt; another &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion string on the group), I feel pretty
        strongly &gt; &gt; about this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regard to the F2L. Even now I never use an F2L
        trick unless I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cut down the time that much. Even if
        I did no thinking or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking at

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which algorithm to use instantly, I
        think the way I'm &gt; doing it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        now would still take over a minute... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        rather &gt; not try &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn any
        of the hardest methods first. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; cutting down time doing the first layer. I can do it in &gt;
        &gt; about 4 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes usually,

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are the most
        common methods that you guys use, how &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; difficult are they to learn and use, and how fast are they? &gt;

        No, doesn't work...try it on any cube...it works that if you turn a face
        it is solved, but you aren't just turning a face cuz you have to do
        everything in a different manner...you orient everything first...then
        permute them...so everything must be oriented before permuted, therefore
        you need to know which ones need to be oriented and orient them...and
        you have to do that in their respective positions...unless of course
        your name is Stefan Pochmann and none of these rules apply to you :p

        First of all, I never really introduced myself, but I'm a new cuber who
        joined this group about a week ago... my name is David, i'm 17 from
        Ohio/USA, and learned how to solve a rubik's cube (using a cheat-sheet
        for algs) on Christmas (although I had my cube before then). I did 12 in
        a row today to find my average time, which is 2:41 at the moment.
        Anyways, I want to get faster.. at least to be able to solve the cube in
        a minute. A few questions. First of all, from what people here have told
        me, I need to learn how to solve F2L in one step. Currently I do all 3
        layers seperately. I printed of all 41 algs from speedcubing.com, but I
        have been told that I should know how to do it intuitively. With that in
        mind, what is the best way of learning how to do the F2L simultaneously?
        The way I see it, there should be a way to learn a smaller number of
        algs and then learn how to position the cubes so that those algs can be
        used.. maybe that woudlnt' work though. Anyways, let me know what
        methods you guys used for mastering F2L. Second question: is this a good
        method for last layer? -Cross -Permute corners -Orient corners -Permute
        edges -(Orient edges; i almost never have situations where the edges are
        in the right place but oriented wrong) Third question: are there any
        algs to rotate 1 corner (i know that it would also have to move edges,
        b/c it's not possible to rotate just one piece) What about rotate 2
        adjacent corners, or 2 opposite corners? I currently have one alg, which
        rotates all of the corners except front left; it is inefficient and I
        sometimes have to execute it as many as 5 times to orient all of the
        corners. Fourth question -- any other general tips on getting faster?
        Thanks a lot, and thanks to all the people who've helped me so far!

        &gt; A few questions. RUR' and RU'R'. Do those to your cube and learn
        how an why they work. That is the goal state for each corner/edge pair.
        Play around with the cube trying to transform each case that comes up
        into one of those, ready for insertion. &gt; Second question: is this a
        good method for last layer? &gt; -Cross &gt; -Permute corners &gt;
        -Orient corners &gt; -Permute edges &gt; -(Orient edges; i almost never
        have situations where the edges are in the right place but oriented
        wrong) The last step (orienting edges again) is completely unnecessary.
        But other than that, yes, it's a good method. Using this, you can
        achieve times in the 16's. Many people will tell you that orienting
        corners before permuting them is better because it leads into learning
        PLL. Keeping the order this way leads better into COLL. It's all a
        matter of preference. &gt; Third question: are there any algs to rotate
        1 corner (i know that it would also have to move edges, b/c it's not
        possible to rotate just one piece) What about rotate 2 adjacent corners,
        or 2 opposite corners? I currently have one alg, which rotates all of
        the corners except front left; it is inefficient and I sometimes have to
        execute it as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners. You cannot
        rotate a single corner. You also cannot flip a lone edge. Twisting them

        introduced myself, but I'm a new cuber who joined this group about a
        week ago... my name is David, i'm 17 from Ohio/USA, and learned how to
        solve a rubik's cube (using a cheat-sheet for algs) on Christmas
        (although I had my cube before then). I did 12 in a row today to find my
        average time, which is 2:41 at the moment. &gt; &gt; Anyways, I want to
        get faster.. at least to be able to solve the cube in a minute. &gt;
        &gt; A few questions. RUR' and RU'R'. Do those to your cube and learn
        how an why they work. That is the goal state for each corner/edge pair.
        Play around with the cube trying to transform each case that comes up
        into one of those, ready for insertion. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I shall play
        around with those patterns and try to understand them, but I did it a
        few times and nothing seems to click.. I'm not really sure what I'm
        aiming for here. &gt; Second question: is this a good method for last
        layer? &gt; -Cross &gt; -Permute corners &gt; -Orient corners &gt;
        -Permute edges &gt; -(Orient edges; i almost never have situations where
        the edges are in the right place but oriented wrong) The last step
        (orienting edges again) is completely unnecessary. But other than that,
        yes, it's a good method. Using this, you can achieve times in the 16's.
        Many people will tell you that orienting corners before permuting them
        is better because it leads into learning PLL. Keeping the order this way
        leads better into COLL. It's all a matter of preference. It's possible
        to get under 20 seconds with this method? That seems ridiculous! I know
        my algs (i only have about 10 of them) pretty well, and I don't do too
        much thinking, and as I said, the average I took today was 2:41. I
        suppose after learning how to do F2L, and learning some more algs for
        LL, I could cut down to times like that.... I was always under the
        impression that the people who solved it in sub-20 used some sort of
        strange technique which involved lots of both genius and memorization
        -_- &gt; Third question: are there any algs to rotate 1 corner (i know
        that it would also have to move edges, b/c it's not possible to rotate
        just one piece) What about rotate 2 adjacent corners, or 2 opposite
        corners? I currently have one alg, which rotates all of the corners
        except front left; it is inefficient and I sometimes have to execute it
        as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners. You cannot rotate a
        single corner. You also cannot flip a lone edge. Twisting them and
        shuffling them around are completely separate. You can have one without
        the other quite easily. Also, if you learn how to perform the mirror of
        the alg you know (L'U'LU'L'U2L compared to RUR'URU2R') you can complete
        any possible orientation in two algs. Learning shorter algs for a couple
        of cases is helpful and simple. They're really just extensions of the
        basic alg you already know. The one I currently use is the first one you
        listed -- The (L'U'LU'L'U2L) one. What is the difference between these
        two moves? I would try it right now and try to figure it out, but I
        don't have a good situation to test it on... &gt; Fourth question -- any
        other general tips on getting faster? Learn why the things you do to the
        cube work the way they do. It makes recalling things so much easier
        during solves. Stay calm, and go slowly. But most importantly, have fun.
        Hmm, not sure what you mean by "learn why the things you do to the cube
        work the way they do", but I will try to be aware of what's going on
        while i'm moving it, rather than just repeating algorithms from the
        internet. Thanks. David &gt; David -Mike SPONSORED LINKS Jigsaw puzzle

        Hello Everyone First a short post for Mike Bennett [[[ Mike- you should
        defenitely try to make B1 on the left side. You're already a full second
        faster than me at F2B, so maybe you shouldn't listen to me, but doing B1
        on the Left has really improved my F2B As it says on Gilles site, with
        B1 on the left side, you can see almost** every piece from one point of
        view. With the B1 on the F slice, you can only see a few pieces.
        **except the DB edge Once the moves for B1 become more automatic, you
        can find 1 of the two corners you need for B2 quickly, b/c you will be
        able to see all of the pieces. Also, the cube is ready for R U r M moves
        with B1 on the left.]]] I like the idea of never having to do cube
        rotations. Waterman Once you have the white layer done(on the L), its
        all R U r M moves to finish. Petrus With a 3x2x2 block (on the L), and
        oriented Edges, you finish the F2L with only R U moves ROUX With B1 on
        the L, I only use R U r M moves for B2, and then never have to rotate
        for CLL or Step 4. There are some x rotations, done as r R l' etc.. but
        once B1 is formed, it pretty much stays in my left hand, unbroken for
        the whole solve. (Some CLL algs break it up real quick.) Im interested
        in How many of you solve the Cross, 2x2 or X on the Left side. As far as
        CFOP I think that F2L algs are faster in z. sorry about the long post
        happy cubing, Jason K

        David, for F2L, I would advise not memorizing algorithms, but figuring
        out a way to do everything intuitively. Try this. If you have a corner
        pointed up, and its edge is in the U layer, line up the edge with its
        center. This will put the corner somewhere else on the top layer. Now
        move the slice with the edge on it away from the slot your working with.
        Now move the U slice until the corner pairs up with the edge. FOR LL
        (RUR')U(RU2R') sune (RU2R')U'(RU'R') antisune (RUR')U(RU'R'U)(RU2R')
        double sune (R'U2)(RUR'U')(RUR'U')(RUR'U) R the one you asked about R U2
        R2 U' R2 U' R2 U2 R Bruno Hope that helps. And yes that is a good
        method. I would eventually incorporate COLL into your method. JASON K

        but I have been told that I should know how to do it intuitively. With

        &lt;ladartfrog@y...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; First of all, I never really
        introduced myself, but I'm a new cuber who joined this group about a
        week ago... my name is David, i'm 17 from Ohio/USA, and learned how to
        solve a rubik's cube (using a cheat-sheet for algs) on Christmas
        (although I had my cube before then). I did 12 in a row today to find my
        average time, which is 2:41 at the moment. &gt; &gt; Anyways, I want to
        get faster.. at least to be able to solve the cube in a minute.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This isn't hard, mainly practice...any (well
        most) methods, with enough practice, I believe can be sub-60... &gt;
        &gt; A few questions. &gt; &gt; First of all, from what people here have
        told me, I need to learn how to solve F2L in one step. Currently I do
        all 3 layers seperately. I printed of all 41 algs from speedcubing.com,
        but I have been told that I should know how to do it intuitively. With
        that in mind, what is the best way of learning how to do the F2L
        simultaneously? The way I see it, there should be a way to learn a
        smaller number of algs and then learn how to position the cubes so that
        those algs can be used.. maybe that woudlnt' work though. Anyways, let
        me know what methods you guys used for mastering F2L.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I saw a guide on Twistypuzzles for
        F2L...the link is:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step2.shtml Starts
        there...you could learn from someone really good at it...you can look at
        the algorithms, not to memorize, but to understand what they do so you
        can think about doing it on your own... &gt; &gt; Second question: is
        this a good method for last layer? &gt; -Cross &gt; -Permute corners
        &gt; -Orient corners &gt; -Permute edges &gt; -(Orient edges; i almost
        never have situations where the edges are in the right place but
        oriented wrong) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mike is
        right, that last step is not needed unless you somehow manage to screw
        up an algorithm...but for a beginner solution that is a good order...I
        still do a 4LLL (4-look last layer) by doing: Orient Corners, Orient
        Edges**, Permute Corners**, Permute Edges... It will help me lead into
        PLL...but everyone does it different... **means that those 2 steps
        sometimes switch... &gt; &gt; Third question: are there any algs to
        rotate 1 corner (i know that it would also have to move edges, b/c it's
        not possible to rotate just one piece) What about rotate 2 adjacent
        corners, or 2 opposite corners? I currently have one alg, which rotates
        all of the corners except front left; it is inefficient and I sometimes
        have to execute it as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Someone tossed out some algorithms...I
        think if you want a 4LLL(every time) or less with skips...then you need
        to learn: 3 for (as you call it) the cross on top, 4 for permuting
        corners...7 for Orienting corners and 4 for Permuting
        Edges...so...3+4+7+4...18 algorithms for a guaranteed 4LLL...(sorry if
        my counting is off) but 18 isn't much, compared to 57 for OLL and 21 for
        PLL, and those 18 will be one step towards the 78 for OLL and PLL...so
        you will "only" have 60 more to go... &gt; &gt; Fourth question -- any
        other general tips on getting faster? &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What Mike said about
        understanding what the things you do on your cube do, he means
        deconstruct your algorithms...back when I was a beginner, using my
        beginner method...I think I was averaging 1:30-2:00 (don't remember...)
        and when I deconstructed my algorithms it allowed me to (as I called it)
        "multitask" to save algs...I only used 5 or 6 algorithms to solve the
        cube...and 1 for the F2L...sometimes I had to execute an algorithm 3
        times...then I deconstructed and the most I had to do was 2
        ever...so...yah...Thats what intuitive F2L is all about, know what the
        pieces are doing and being visual, not a robot... As for tips I myself
        have for you...practice...i know thats obvious...but well...its
        true...look ahead is very important I need to start doing this now that
        I know intuitive F2L (thanks Chris) and it will help me get faster with
        my F2L, but looking ahead is crucial, it brings down your times a
        lot...ummmmm...when learning new algorithms for the last layer, look
        around, there are plenty of sites out there with a ton of algorithms,
        find the one that is best suited for your hands...if you are a lefty, do
        algorithms that use your left hand...play to your strengths, you can
        modify any system out there to be better for you...or something you can
        use easier...and always have fun cubing...I get pissed off
        sometimes...but it's always fun... &gt; Thanks a lot, and thanks to all
        the people who've helped me so far! &gt; &gt; David
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These were from me and I hope it
        helps: Craig

        personaly, if youv'e been cubing for only a week, i would just recommend
        getting times around 1 minute with your current method. Once you get
        there, THEN I would recommend learning F2L. There are many choices for
        the last layer. I use COLL, but most people like OLL/PLL. Anyways, don't
        worry about learning new methods just yet

        Hey Craig, just talked to you on Yahoo Messanger I think it means no one
        else can say Sune is theirs or use it in their own solution without
        giving him credit. Like I can't go post "my own method" on a website and

        A few things: Jason -- when you said gave me that suggestion for F2L,
        when you say "iIf you have a corner pointed up, and its edge is in the U
        layer", you mean that the silver side where I solved the cross is DOWN,
        and so "pointed up" would mean that the silver side of the corner is
        facing up (ie, opposite the silver cross)? Also; you gave me the sune,
        antisune, doublesune, and bruno patterns.. i'm not familiar with what
        those are. I don't suppose it will be difficult to look them up, but
        these are definetely ones I should memorize? I also don't know what COLL
        is. Craig -- I will definetely check out that link for the method for
        F2L, b/c I don't think it would be enjoyable to memorize 41 algorithms.
        Also, you said that my last step (orient edges) is redundant. However, I
        think I should have been more specific. When I said that my method is:
        "&gt; -Cross &gt; -Permute corners &gt; -Orient corners &gt; -Permute
        edges &gt; -(Orient edges; i almost never have situations where the
        edges are in the right place but oriented wrong)" I mean, by cross, that
        the cross is solved on the yellow side only.. that is, I will have
        yellow pieces in all 4 spots, but they won't necessarily be the correct
        ones. Don't ask why, but I learned this part of my method specifically
        off of a website somewhere, and it seems to work. I have 2 algs for
        "solving" the cross -- how many do I actually need, to truly solve the
        cross? Where can I get them? Later you said that there are 18 algs I
        should learn for LL; there are a million sites that offer huge lists of
        algs, but they offer so many algs on each page that I simply don't know
        which ones to learn. Where can I get these 18 so that I can commit them
        to memory? I will try to deconstruct my algs. Thanks to the many people
        who have responded! I'm sure I'll have many more questions later. -_-

        advise not memorizing algorithms, but figuring out a way to do
        everything intuitively. Try this. If you have a corner pointed up, and
        its edge is in the U layer, line up the edge with its center. This will
        put the corner somewhere else on the top layer. Now move the slice with
        the edge on it away from the slot your working with. Now move the U
        slice until the corner pairs up with the edge. FOR LL (RUR')U(RU2R')
        sune (RU2R')U'(RU'R') antisune (RUR')U(RU'R'U)(RU2R') double sune
        (R'U2)(RUR'U')(RUR'U')(RUR'U) R the one you asked about R U2 R2 U' R2 U'
        R2 U2 R Bruno Hope that helps. And yes that is a good method. I would
        eventually incorporate COLL into your method. JASON K --- In

        introduced myself, but I'm a new cuber who joined this group about a
        week ago... my name is David, i'm 17 from Ohio/USA, and learned how to
        solve a rubik's cube (using a cheat-sheet for algs) on Christmas
        (although I had my cube before then). I did 12 in a row today to find my
        average time, which is 2:41 at the moment. &gt; &gt; Anyways, I want to
        get faster.. at least to be able to solve the cube in a minute. &gt;
        &gt; A few questions. &gt; &gt; First of all, from what people here have
        told me, I need to learn how to solve F2L in one step. Currently I do
        all 3 layers seperately. I printed of all 41 algs from speedcubing.com,
        but I have been told that I should know how to do it intuitively. With
        that in mind, what is the best way of learning how to do the F2L
        simultaneously? The way I see it, there should be a way to learn a
        smaller number of algs and then learn how to position the cubes so that
        those algs can be used.. maybe that woudlnt' work though. Anyways, let
        me know what methods you guys used for mastering F2L. &gt; &gt; Second
        question: is this a good method for last layer? &gt; -Cross &gt;
        -Permute corners &gt; -Orient corners &gt; -Permute edges &gt; -(Orient
        edges; i almost never have situations where the edges are in the right
        place but oriented wrong) &gt; &gt; Third question: are there any algs
        to rotate 1 corner (i know that it would also have to move edges, b/c
        it's not possible to rotate just one piece) What about rotate 2 adjacent
        corners, or 2 opposite corners? I currently have one alg, which rotates
        all of the corners except front left; it is inefficient and I sometimes
        have to execute it as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners. &gt;
        &gt; Fourth question -- any other general tips on getting faster? &gt;
        &gt; Thanks a lot, and thanks to all the people who've helped me so far!

        another cuber in the UK! I hope that you will be able to meet up with
        Duncan soon, he is a very nice guy and he has a great knowledge of the
        cube! Hopefully you will be able to make it to the next meeting of UK
        cubers, which I hope will be sooner as opposed to later! Anyway, if you

        here. I used to play with the cube in the &gt; 80's when I was little(I
        used a really simple beginner layer method, I &gt; think) and recently
        after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in the office &gt; had got hooked
        again and bought a new cube in August. &gt; &gt; I've been reading a lot
        of the people here's web pages and they have &gt; all been a great help
        (esp. Jessica Fridrich's, Dan Harris', Joel Van &gt; Noort, Chris
        Hardwick's). So thanks to everyone for making some great &gt; webpages.
        I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting better at doing &gt; F2L
        (it's taking a long time to be able to make fast decisions &gt; though!)
        and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F PLL algorithms (and &gt; have
        forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm going to try to learn all the &gt;
        PLL ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is that the general approach
        &gt; to learning Fridrich? Since I learnt those PLL's I have found it
        &gt; possible to solve the cube in around 50 seconds whereas before it
        was &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something like that if I went flat out.
        Still &gt; pretty slow compared to everyone here. &gt; &gt; Still, I had
        a go with Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and was shocked &gt; when using my
        method after a few tries I solved it in 31 seconds. &gt; Well, That was
        a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt; &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought
        from a department store in August with &gt; bright stickers on (which
        deteriorated really rapidly )- probably the &gt; generic 3 x 3
        Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY cube with PVC &gt; stickers
        which I prefer. The DIY one seems to be easier to control &gt; turns on
        and more suitable for doing fast solves (although it's &gt; noisier
        according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has M0105B written on &gt; one of
        the corners. &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any opinions of the new
        anniversary cube? Is it the &gt; same as the normal 3 x 3 but with a
        different centre white sticker? Is &gt; it at all suitable for
        speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or polypropelene? &gt; &gt; That's it
        for now. &gt; &gt; Cheers, Matt &gt;

        hardcore magicians out there...How long does it take you to replace a
        string from the time you have the replacement string in your hand??? So
        how long to remove the old string, and replace it with the new one...I'd
        say for me maybe 1-2 minutes...if I was going top speed...I'd be
        fine...and I usually use the string that broke as the thing to pull the
        final loop over the edge...I've heard ppl whine that its a bad
        idea...probably is...but meh... Craig --- In

        "Step 5+6 Index." On Gilles Roux's site, CLL is called "step 3" Some of
        these algs do not maintain edge orientation. Whatever you learn, I would
        advise using something that takes advantage of Algs that simultaneously
        Orient/Permute corners. Learn CLL COLL dont mess with OLL just my 2

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jason -- when you said gave me that suggestion for
        F2L, when you say &gt; "iIf you have a corner pointed up, and its edge
        is in the U layer", &gt; you mean that the silver side where I solved
        the cross is DOWN, and so &gt; "pointed up" would mean that the silver
        side of the corner is facing &gt; up (ie, opposite the silver cross)?
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes...he was kinda trying to explain some
        intuitive F2L, add me &gt; to yahoo or MSN chbouchard777 for yahoo and
        logitewty@h... for MSN &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also; you gave me the
        sune, antisune, doublesune, and bruno &gt; patterns.. i'm not familiar
        with what those are. I don't suppose it &gt; will be difficult to look
        them up, but these are definetely ones I &gt; should memorize? &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Umm...its a good start to a 4LLL...they would be
        good... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also don't know what COLL is.
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;COLL is a term for a set of algorithms that
        some people use. A &gt; more advanced method...it orients and permutes
        the corners in one &gt; algorithm... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Craig -- I
        will definetely check out that link for the method for &gt; F2L, b/c I
        don't think it would be enjoyable to memorize 41 &gt; algorithms. Also,
        you said that my last step (orient edges) is &gt; redundant. However, I
        think I should have been more specific. When I &gt; said that my method
        is: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "&gt; -Cross &gt; &gt; &gt; -Permute corners
        &gt; &gt; &gt; -Orient corners &gt; &gt; &gt; -Permute edges &gt; &gt;
        &gt; -(Orient edges; i almost never have situations where the edges are
        &gt; &gt; in the right place but oriented wrong)" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        mean, by cross, that the cross is solved on the yellow side &gt; only..
        that is, I will have yellow pieces in all 4 spots, but they &gt; won't
        necessarily be the correct ones. Don't ask why, but I learned &gt; this
        part of my method specifically off of a website somewhere, and it &gt;
        seems to work. I have 2 algs for "solving" the cross -- how many do I
        &gt; actually need, to truly solve the cross? Where can I get them? &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When you solve the cross on top, that is orienting
        the &gt; edges...and there are 3 algorithms you need to learn to always
        do this &gt; in 1 step...most likely you have 2 algorithms, and for the
        case where &gt; all 4 edges are wrong you execute an algorithm twice...
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later you said that there are 18 algs I should
        learn for LL; there &gt; are a million sites that offer huge lists of
        algs, but they offer so &gt; many algs on each page that I simply don't
        know which ones to learn. &gt; Where can I get these 18 so that I can
        commit them to memory? &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, well I was
        wrong...its only 17...but I understand what you &gt; mean...there are a
        lot of sites out there...I will compile a list of &gt; the ones you need
        for the 4LLL...and send them to you... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will
        try to deconstruct my algs. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thats good...it
        helps... &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks to the many people who have responded!
        I'm sure I'll have &gt; many more questions later. -_- &gt; &gt; &gt;

      <div class="email-content">
        Hello everyone, First thing: I was wondering if there are any cubers
        and/or any official or unofficial cube competitions near me. I live in
        Minnesota of the US. I learned how to do the cube about 3 weeks ago and
        got sub-50 non lucky this past week. It would be nice to talk with some
        people that really know a lot about the cube and also to enter in some
        competitions. Next thing: Some people have been saying that you should
        not memorize the F2L algs and some people have been saying that that is
        what they did. Personally, I memorized the F2L algs in the sense that I
        got a sheet of paper and practiced the algs. However, I learn best by
        doing that and while I am doing that I look at the moves to see what is
        going on. I think this combines doing it intuitively and memorizing in a
        pretty good way, although maybe you don't get the satisfaction and good
        practice of doing it for yourself. I think it is right that you should
        not just learn algorithms. It would be like just memorizing a poem and
        not even realizing what it is saying. So am I going to suffer later on
        from learning F2L the way I did or will I be all right? Next next thing:
        I am switching my LL order so that it would be easier to move to
        OLL/PLL. Before I did the normal beginner LL: OE, PC, OC, PE. Now I have
        been trying to switch to OE, OC, PC, PE but somebody posted a different
        way to do this (I think it was oc, oe**, pe**, pc where the stars could
        be switched). Which would be the better way if I am aiming for OLL/PLL?
        I thought the way I was trying would be good because to do PC than PE I
        had to learn 7 of the PLL algs and then I could gradually incorporate
        more. Last thing: What does a good 3x3 usually cost and where can I get
        one. Mine is a Rubiks.com one that works reasonably well now that I put
        some silicon lube on it. Cheers, Robbie

        thing: I was wondering if there are any cubers and/or any official or
        unofficial cube competitions near me. I live in Minnesota of the US. I
        learned how to do the cube about 3 weeks ago and got sub-50 non lucky
        this past week. It would be nice to talk with some people that really
        know a lot about the cube and also to enter in some competitions. Hi
        there. I'm from Iowa currently, but planning to move to Minnesota
        relatively soon. My girlfriend lives in Minneapolis as do many of our
        cubing friends. Where exactly are you from? As far as competitions go,
        the closest one to you to date has been Chicago. My girlfriend is
        working on starting a tournament at the U of M, but they want her to
        start a cube club first, so it's slow going. I know Jake Rueth is
        possibly planning a Wisconsin tournament for this spring, so keep your
        eyes peeled. At the very least, an informal cuber gathering is likely,
        assuming you don't live in Duluth or something. &gt; Next thing: Some
        people have been saying that you should not memorize the F2L algs and
        some people have been saying that that is what they did...So am I going
        to suffer later on from learning F2L the way I did or will I be all
        right? As long as you understand why the algs work the way they do,
        you'll be fine. Otherwise, it makes recognition and execution,
        especially in competition, worse. Also, learning them by rote will make
        it harder to use more advanced tricks on your own later. &gt; Next next
        thing: I am switching my LL order so that it would be easier to move to
        OLL/PLL. Before I did the normal beginner LL: OE, PC, OC, PE. Now I have
        been trying to switch to OE, OC, PC, PE but somebody posted a different
        way to do this (I think it was oc, oe**, pe**, pc where the stars could
        be switched). Which would be the better way if I am aiming for OLL/PLL?
        I thought the way I was trying would be good because to do PC than PE I
        had to learn 7 of the PLL algs and then I could gradually incorporate
        more. If you want to learn OLL/PLL, that way described will do you no
        good. Just learn OLL/PLL. If you want to learn the VH method (OE during
        final pair/COLL/PELL) keep your current order. Personally I recommend
        the latter, as it is both a great system with fewer and shorter algs,
        and doesn't create another generic Fridrich clone. &gt; Last thing: What
        does a good 3x3 usually cost and where can I get one. Mine is a
        Rubiks.com one that works reasonably well now that I put some silicon
        lube on it. &gt; Cheers, &gt; Robbie You live in the land of Target.
        They go for about $9 there. Wal-Mart has them, too. -Mike

        For that purpose I really suggest using this notation with U meaning
        (Uu) and r meaning (l'rR), and all non-U-turns being half turns: (x' U')
        (R' U' r U' L U) (r' U' r U) (L' U' L U L' U) z I think it's fairly easy
        to learn as it flows really easily. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Thanks for the welcome Dan, this is a great group. Having a little
        trouble keeping up with the volume (and often content!) of posts, but am
        already picking up a lot of stuff through being here. I think the next
        step for me like some other new cubers here is improving my F2L, it
        still slows my times down. I have made efforts to learn F2L as
        intuitively as possible and can fairly quickly work out how to solve a
        pair when I spot then but the trouble is spotting them ahead of time. I
        want to have a smooth solving approach where I move from one pair to the
        next without pausing. I guess the looking ahead bit is just a technique
        you learn from practicing and staying focussed while doing the First two
        layers.. but if there are any pointers to speed up this process I would
        be interested in hearing them. Your website has been a great help for
        the last layer algorithms so thanks for maintaining that. While on the
        topic of websites that helped me, I forgot to mention in my first post
        that it was Jasmine's excellently explained beginner method that started
        me off again after all these years away from the cube. As far as meeting
        up goes... time is at a premium at the moment what with me and my wife
        expecting our second baby and all that that entails... but I will make
        an effort since it would no doubt help my method loads plus I get to see
        some really fast cubers up close! cheers, Matt --- In

        the UK here. I used to play with the cube in the &gt; &gt; 80's when I
        was little(I used a really simple beginner layer &gt; method, I &gt;
        &gt; think) and recently after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in the &gt;
        office &gt; &gt; had got hooked again and bought a new cube in August.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been reading a lot of the people here's web
        pages and they &gt; have &gt; &gt; all been a great help (esp. Jessica
        Fridrich's, Dan Harris', Joel &gt; Van &gt; &gt; Noort, Chris
        Hardwick's). So thanks to everyone for making some &gt; great &gt; &gt;
        webpages. I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting better at &gt;
        doing &gt; &gt; F2L (it's taking a long time to be able to make fast
        decisions &gt; &gt; though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F PLL
        algorithms &gt; (and &gt; &gt; have forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm
        going to try to learn all &gt; the &gt; &gt; PLL ones and then look at
        the OLL ones. Is that the general &gt; approach &gt; &gt; to learning
        Fridrich? Since I learnt those PLL's I have found it &gt; &gt; possible
        to solve the cube in around 50 seconds whereas before it &gt; was &gt;
        &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something like that if I went flat out. Still
        &gt; &gt; pretty slow compared to everyone here. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Still, I had a go with Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and was shocked &gt;
        &gt; when using my method after a few tries I solved it in 31 seconds.
        &gt; &gt; Well, That was a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought from a department store in August
        &gt; with &gt; &gt; bright stickers on (which deteriorated really
        rapidly )- probably &gt; the &gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell,
        and a Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY cube with &gt; PVC &gt; &gt; stickers which I
        prefer. The DIY one seems to be easier to control &gt; &gt; turns on and
        more suitable for doing fast solves (although it's &gt; &gt; noisier
        according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has M0105B written on &gt; &gt;
        one of the corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any opinions of
        the new anniversary cube? Is it &gt; the &gt; &gt; same as the normal 3
        x 3 but with a different centre white &gt; sticker? Is &gt; &gt; it at
        all suitable for speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or &gt;
        polypropelene? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's it for now. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        there. I'm from Iowa currently, but planning to move to Minnesota

        cubing friends. Where exactly are you from? As far as competitions go,
        the closest one to you to date has been Chicago. My girlfriend is
        working on starting a tournament at the U of M, but they want her to
        start a cube club first, so it's slow going. I know Jake Rueth is
        possibly planning a Wisconsin tournament for this spring, so keep your
        eyes peeled. At the very least, an informal cuber gathering is likely,
        assuming you don't live in Duluth or something. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually
        I'm a sophomore at the U of M and I was talking to a friend about maybe
        starting a cube club. I think you need three people and a professor to
        start a club, so you can have your girlfriend count me as one of the
        three if she wants. Cheers, Robbie ---------------------------------

        algorithms for a guaranteed 4LLL... Be careful about the word "need" :-)
        Besides dropping the number for PCLL from 4 down to 2, I've taken this a
        bit further now. You can do guaranteed 2-step PLL with a set of only 5
        algs. I'll use Jessica's names:
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html (J1) = Jessica's
        J (J2) = L&lt;-&gt;R mirror of (J1) (R1) = Jessica's R (R2) =
        L&lt;-&gt;R mirror of (R1) You get all algs except H like this: U - (J1)
        y2 (J2) A - (J1) y (J2) Z - (J1) y' (R2) H - ??? E - (R1) y (J2) T -
        (J1) U' (J2) V - (J1) y (R1) U' F - (J1) y U (R1) R - (R1) J - (J1) Y -
        (J1) (J2) U G1- (R1) (J2) U' d' G2- (J1) (R2) U2 G3- (J2) (R1) d2 G4-
        (R2) (J1) U' d' N - (J1) y2 (J1) So those four algs plus H guarantees
        2-step PLL. Is this optimal? I wouldn't be surprised if it were possible
        with only 4 algs. Cheers! Stefan

        different way to do this (I think it was oc, oe**, pe**, pc where the
        stars could be switched). Which would be the better way if I am aiming
        for OLL/PLL? I thought the way I was trying would be good because to do
        PC than PE I had to learn 7 of the PLL algs and then I could gradually
        incorporate more. &gt; &gt; Last thing: What does a good 3x3 usually
        cost and where can I get one. Mine is a Rubiks.com one that works

        one. Mine is a Rubiks.com one that works reasonably well now that I &gt;

        Have you never heard that you can solve the LL with only 1 algorithm ?
        Just use FURU'R'F' wisely and you will be able to solve it (you might
        have to do it several times, and figure out how to combine several
        FURU'R'F' to affect only a few pieces. I can't remember the name of the

        That's not what I meant. I meant applying algs to the LL only. If you
        use that alg you mentioned on LL only, it's obvious you cannot solve the
        whole LL no matter how often you apply it. So if it works at all, then
        you have to apply the alg to other layers than the LL. Also, Craig was
        talking about a 4-look LL and I'm after a 2-step (better name than
        2-look I think, but we mean the same) PLL. To be precise: find a
        smallest possible set of algs that change only the U layer and which
        solve every PLL case with at most two alg applications (from that set)
        together with any U-turns before, between or after the algs. Currently
        the best I know is 5. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        you suggested would take more moves on average... &gt; &gt; Craig For
        simplicity, let's assume all algs are 12 moves. If you permute corners
        and edges *separately* you'll need (5/6)*12 + (11/12)*12 = 21 moves. If
        you *combine* permuting corners and edges using 5 algs, then it looks
        like this: (3*2*1)*(4*3) = 72 cases after solving one corner with a U
        turn. We need: 1 * 0 algs 21 * 1 alg 50 * 2 algs On average that's 20.17
        moves, ha! :-) (I admit being a bit sloppy but I hope the general idea
        is clear) Furthermore, you can easily reduce twisting work for free with
        separate permutations. For permuting corners you have one alg to swap
        adjacent corners and one to swap diagonally opposite corners. Consider
        the latter case and let the algorithm be this one:
        http://www.cubewhiz.com/images/pll/pll21.gif Now: 1) Rotate U so that
        the FL corner is solved (BR is solved, too, and the other two need to be
        swapped). 2) Look where the edge at F belongs. - If it belongs at F,
        simply apply the alg. - If it belongs at R, do y2 and apply the alg. -
        If it belongs at B, do U'd and apply the alg. - If it belongs at L, do
        y2 and go to step 1) unless you've done that before, in which case you
        just apply the alg. This is fairly simple and guarantees that at least
        one edge is solved, and then you don't need the Z and H perms anymore,
        you're guaranteed a 3-cycle or even a edge permutation skip with 1/3
        chance (hey, you don't even have to declare it lucky then :-). If two
        adjacent corners need to be swapped, it's not so easy. For swapping two
        diagonally opposite corners it doesn't matter which two opposite corners
        you swap, i.e. you can apply the alg from all four angles and the
        corners will be solved (at least relative to each other). But for
        adjacent corners, you just have one angle. So you can't influence the
        edges if you only know one alg, and you can't prevent getting e.g. Z or
        H. You need separate algs for that. But using J and its mirror is
        enough. And a rule to decide which to apply is also very easy. Summary:
        Using Y, J, mirror(J), U and mirror(U) is enough for easy 2-step PLL. No
        need learning H and Z. Cheers! Stefan

        Ok, just to close this properly: Extending your textual reasoning should
        look like this: - If the first step is skipped (probability x) then
        we're done. - Otherwise (probability (1-x)) if the second step is
        skipped (probability y) then we're done. - Still otherwise (probability
        (1-x)(1-y)) if the third step is skipped (probability z) then we're
        done. So you'd get x + (1-x)*y + (1-x)*(1-y)*z or x + (1-x) * (y + (1-y)
        * z). This works but is is complicated. You ask for "at least one step
        skipped". You could try to solve similar but extreme cases cause those
        are generally easier, e.g. "all steps skipped" (probability x*y*z) or
        "no steps skipped" (probability (1-x)(1-y)(1-z)). And if you then
        realized that "at least one" is the opposite of "none" then you could
        answer your question simply by: 1 - (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) Cheers! Stefan ---

        Yep. Can you also show a concise formula for three things, i. e. &gt; x,
        &gt; &gt; y &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and z? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Px
        + (Pnotx * Py + (Pnoty* Pz)) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That still
        seems not right, though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why not? (True, it isn't,
        but why do *you* say so?) &gt; &gt; Actually I shouldn't have told you.
        I should let you do some &gt; verification yourself first. For example
        some general obvious tests. &gt; It's a probability, so it should be
        between 0 and 1. Obviously it's &gt; never less than 0, but it's easy to
        get it above 1. Also, symmetry. &gt; Choose three different values for
        x, y and z. Then change their order, &gt; e.g. swapping the values of x
        and y. The value should stay the same, &gt; but does it? &gt; &gt;
        Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

        I just have to share this with you all. Earlier today I solved the cube
        one-handed in 25.89. My old record was 28.14 so it was quite a big
        improvement. It was totally non-lucky but with the easiest cases for OLL
        and PLL. I also set a new average record of 35.51!! My long time goal is
        to win the one-handed event at the european championships. (There will
        be a EC this summer, right??) I'm hoping to average sub-30 before summer
        and hopefully faster than Joël, Anssi and other europeans at the same. I
        also did a lucky 22.83 a few days ago, with a PLL-skip. Hopefully more
        europeans will try to get their times down before summer. /Gunnar

        this with you all. Earlier today I solved the &gt; &gt; cube one-handed
        in 25.89. My old record was 28.14 so it was quite &gt; a &gt; &gt; big
        improvement. It was totally non-lucky but with the easiest &gt; cases
        &gt; &gt; for OLL and PLL. I also set a new average record of 35.51!!
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My long time goal is to win the one-handed event at
        the european &gt; &gt; championships. (There will be a EC this summer,
        right??) I'm &gt; hoping to &gt; &gt; average sub-30 before summer and
        hopefully faster than Joël, Anssi &gt; and &gt; &gt; other europeans at
        the same. I also did a lucky 22.83 a few days &gt; ago, &gt; &gt; with a
        PLL-skip. Hopefully more europeans will try to get their &gt; times &gt;
        &gt; down before summer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /Gunnar &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        How would y'all suggest preparing a 4x4x4 for speedsolving? Did you take
        yours apart? I've seen the pictures of how to reassemble one and I don't
        think I'm up for that. With my 3x3x3 cubes, I just played with them
        until they were nice and broken in, then took them apart, cleaned,
        lubed, and put on new stickers. But replacement stickers aren't as easy
        to come by for the 4x4x4, so I'd rather not wear them out. - Matt

        Hi All, Just thoght you might be interested in this email I got today:
        Good Morning Peter We have received the above mentioned order including
        the Money Order in the mail today, since the placing of this order it
        was discovered that the factory made an error in the tooling of the 8
        corner pieces included in the 3x3 Black Assembly kits. Therefore the
        existing stock had to be pulled from the site. Replacement product is on
        its way from the Factory in China. We will not be able to process this
        order until the replacement product arrives (estimated delivery time is
        Jan 20th.) I will remove the order from the Money Order Page so you will
        not sent order reminder e-mails and it will be left in the orders to
        process page. Thank you, The Rubik's Shop customer service Thats quite
        annoying!! Peter Greenwood

        Hi :-) Cool adjacent LL double-flip :-) The other alg u mention flips 2
        opposite edges so it's not the same. However taking
        (MU)(MU)(MU2)(M'U)(M'U)(M'U2) and shifting it cyclically to
        (MU)(MU2)(M'U)(M'U)(M'U2)(MU) and conjugating with M2 we get :
        (M'U)(MU2)(M'U)(M'U)(M'U2)(MU)M2 . Indeed the same as what u found, so
        it's not really "new" :D Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Hey Ben, Just some ideas from times I've taken a long break but
        definitely take the time to follow your instincts. When you practice all
        the time you get into a sort of routine and do the same things for the
        same old situations all the time. When you take a break you lose these
        habits and start thinking intuitively again. If at some point you think
        "wow why do I do this when another strategy is better?" then take the
        time now to switch. I've noticed a number of my bad habits and have been
        able to correct them after taking a break. As far as your times, those
        really shouldn't take long. It's easier to relearn than to learn for the
        first time, so all it takes is a little time to get your hands/mind to
        remember. Seriously though, take the time to let your intuition help you
        analyze your strategy and hopefully catch any bad habits. Not much
        advice here, but I hope it helps. Chris --- In

        (RU'R'U)2 and (U'RUR')2 Also, I know that the 2 edge flipping algs are
        for different cases. I only knew (M'UM'UM'd2)2 before this morning. I
        wanted to find something faster for 2 adjacent edges(faster than using
        setup moves and the edgeflip alg). I figured that I would find a ROUX
        solution with a PLL skip, which is exactly what i did. 13 moves isn't
        bad at all. MIKE- are you saying that you have been using M2UM'U2MUM2 to
        cycle 3 edges for a long time now? I've never heard of anyone using this
        alg to Move 3 edges. I use 2gen for 3 cycles usually. But with Roux, I
        rarely get these cases. PLLs in Middle layer (PMLs?) are ALL faster that

        cases. PLLs in Middle layer (PMLs?) are ALL faster that PELLs for Zb
        &gt; &gt; &gt; JASON K Yep. I've been using them that way since probably
        April or May of last year. They're Gilles' move for when the UR and UL
        edges are both in the U layer after orientation. Check out his site.
        Previously, I had used L2 U F' B L2 F B' U L2 and its inverse, but this
        was just so much easier. Like I said, with practice, it only takes me
        under 1.6 on average for either direction. I really, really need to
        learn to do it from the opposite side, though... Really, all this move
        is is the M2 setup move, followed by a PML alg, and undoing the setup.
        It's the same thing as my beginner alg, but performing with no regrips
        and only using MU makes it incredibly fast. It's one of the reasons COLL
        works for me. -Mike

        if you plan on learning the full fridrich last layer i guess this is the
        best way to do it... 4 look (4 steps) ------ (of course less algorithms
        will work too, but this is the amount required to do each step by
        executing just 1 algorithm) orient edges (3 algorithms, to make a cross
        on LL) orient corners (7 to make entire LL same color) permute edges (4)
        \ (or first corners then edges) permute corners (3) / 3 look ------
        orient edges (3) orient corners (7) permute all (21) 2 look ------

        Which is faster? I don't know the specific answer-- it would depend on
        your technique as much as anything. However the second strategy is
        closer to a 2-look LL, where you orient in one alg and permute in
        another. So maybe that's a better way to start learning, because you
        could learn the corners-only and edges-only algs for orientation and
        permutation (for a total of four looks). Then as you learn the combined
        cases, you can sometimes apply one to skip a look. I think many people
        do this on their way to learning the full OLL set. For PLL there are
        fewer cases so that strategy will be more short-term. Chris --- In

        Hi Pedro I usually post on Fewest Moves Challenge Forum, but your

        as you can see the best took around 20 moves. This is quite
        representative of FMC experts approach. So in my opinion, your 21 moves
        F2L while SPEEDCUBING sounds a bit lucky, sorry ;) I don't remember
        speedcubing standards for considering a slove as lucky, so it is just my
        opinion of FMC solver ... anyway, did you guys ever took an average of
        moves you take for solving the F2L while speedsolving ? I think a moves
        number limit for F2L could be a good benchmark for considering a solve
        as lucky, instead of considering all 5 Fridrich steps (cross + 4 pairs)

        number limit for F2L could be a good benchmark for considering a solve
        as lucky, instead of considering all 5 Fridrich steps (cross + 4 pairs)

        around 20 seconds, with a previous PB of 14.05. I just got a very very
        very fast solve. This was the scramble: &gt; &gt; D2 R L2 B2 U2 D B F2
        R2 B U' R' B2 R F2 L' B' D2 F2 L D F2 D' B' L' &gt; &gt; and my solve:

        pair: (y2) L' U L U2 y' R U R' &gt; 4th pair: (y') R U R' U' R U R' &gt;
        OLL: (y2) R' F R B' R' F' R B &gt; PLL: (U) F2 L' U' r U2 l' U R' U' R2
        &gt; &gt; Which is 40 moves / 11.38 seconds = ~3.5 moves/sec &gt; &gt; I
        don't think it was lucky, but want to hear from you what you think &gt;
        &gt; Man, I'm sooooooooooooooooooooo happy with this!!! &gt; &gt; Pedro

        &gt; We had two weeks to solve the F2L, and as you can see the best took
        &gt; around 20 moves. This is quite representative of FMC experts
        approach. &gt; So in my opinion, your 21 moves F2L while SPEEDCUBING
        sounds a bit &gt; lucky, sorry ;) Hey Cyril, I think if a speedcuber
        said that he/she averaged in the very low twenties for F2L moves, then
        that would be a suspect claim to me. However you have to consider that
        when speedcubing you'll see more scrambles than when doing an F2L FMC.
        Perhaps if, for the FMC F2L contest, you true FMCers were given a
        scramble that a speedcuber could do in 21 moves? I think the number of
        moves it would take you might be in the mid to low teens. I don't think
        a low 20 move F2L is too lucky personally. Consider a 7 move Xcross
        (which is reasonable to notice during inspection, and is the same as
        doing the cross and skipping the first pair basically). After that you
        can have a 6.25 move average for the other pairs (about average in
        general) to get 18.75 turns for the rest of F2L and together you have
        25.75 turns total. Now just consider a 6 move Xcross and one less move
        for each pair (easy cases, but not lucky) and you've dropped 4 moves
        down to 21.75 turns. In speedcubing you will sometimes get these super
        easy scrambles. So I don't think it's lucky, uncommon yes but not by our
        definition too lucky to count. Simply since in speedcubing you go
        through many, many more F2L solves than for F2L FMC, you'll occasionaly
        get a solve like this. Again, I still believe that if for the FMC you
        guys looked at a scramble where most people solve the F2L in the low
        twenties, it would be very cool to see what sort of low move count you
        guys would get. Just my two cents of course, Chris

        Hi :-) Just to clarify this! The agreed practice for calling a solve
        lucky is that there is a SKIPPED step. In his solution there is no
        skipped step the way i see it. If someone wants to call X-cross a
        skipped step so be it. But after x-cross he does pair by pair for f2l
        and then both a OLL and a PLL. So it's not technically lucky in my
        opinion. Those who call this solve lucky i suppose are jealous ;-) It's
        no crime to have many easy steps along a solution. And what more. If
        this time was part of an average it's discarded anyway. If ppl really
        wanna be fuzzy about lucky solves the single best time category of any
        puzzle should removed. Because there will always be borderline cases and
        discussions. **Shrugs** ... Have fun! -Per PS! Both speedcubers and
        FMC'ers crave for "lucky" solutions. It is what is fun to achieve. To
        have good solves analysed and scrutinised is not much fun :-) &gt; ---

        interesting ... are we going to discuss the everlasting topic to decide
        "what's lucky ?" ;) My opinion was the opinion of a FMC cuber, so don't
        hesitate to discard my 2 cents (actually 2 swiss cents = US$ 1.6 cents,
        so my opinion should not count as much as the opinion of US or EU cubers
        .. .) More seriously, what I wanted to point out is the somewhat unclear
        definition of a lucky solve. I totally agree with Chris' (although you
        make nicely optimistic assumptions about FMCers ;) ), Per's and Mike's
        posts, but depending on the method you use, the notion of "skipped step"
        can hardly be defined, and my (too ?) scientist point of view is that
        rules based on other criteria may be more consistent, like the one
        proposed by J. R. Taylor (An Introduction to Error Analysis, University
        Science Books, Mill Valley, 1982) to define outliers in a series of data
        : it is a simple test based on the mean and standard deviation of the
        series. You assume your times distribution is gaussian (mean u, std dev
        s), and compute the probability of getting a time t using erf function
        table. Typically, Taylor defines an outlier when this probability
        multiplied by the number of trials N is lower than 5% (usual threshold).
        In your cas Pedro, u = 20, t = 11.xx and s is probably around 2.6 (just
        an assumption, it computed it for two guys averaging around 20 on
        speedcubing.com website) Now the fun part: assuming you get a time of
        u-3s =12.2 sec for example, som maths (actually I hope I did them
        correctly) show that the required number of solved cubes to consider it
        non-lucky (=non- outlier) is ... exactly 10 ;) So if you were courageous
        enough to follow my thinking I'll change my vote: if in your entire
        cuber life you have already solved as much as TEN cubes, I consider your
        solve wasn't lucky :) (of course, you should adapt the values for your
        real u, s and t, but I don't expect the results to change in an
        extraordinary way !) sorry for the long post, actually I thought my
        conclusion would be more spectacular (like you should have solved some
        billions of cubes), but actually probability laws are not always
        intuitive. It makes me think about a problem with 3 doors I saw on a
        forum some weeks ago ;) Last word for Per: don't insinuate I'm jealous
        ;) How could I ? I'm not even a speedcuber ! cyril

        Hi :-) There's more to commutators than those easy short 4-move algs.
        When writing like Chris said : X Y X' Y' or P Q P' Q' (not to confuse
        with turning the cube physically) each of P or Q can be a sequence of
        several moves. And also conjugates commutators are very useful. A
        conjugate is like this : C P Q P' Q' C' so u add C before a commutator
        and inverse C after it. That combined alg gives same net effect on the
        cube but on different cubies. C server to bring other cubies into the
        positions affected by P Q P' Q' only. By making C the inverse of part of
        P Q P' Q' we achieve a cyclical shift. Ie if we have P = R' and Q = F
        then P Q P' Q' = R' F R F'. By letting C = R we get C P Q P' Q' C' = R
        R' F R F' R' = F R F' R'. And so on. It's very interesting and useful to
        study commutators that make up for instance 3-cycles on corners or edges
        :-) -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I'm having a tough time getting finger tricks down... it feels like I'm
        not getting enough traction on the cube. The less I use my wrists, the
        more I end up fumbling the cube. (I also have trouble getting plastic
        bags open, my fingers are just too slick. Maybe too many years as a
        bassist.) Do tiles help with getting a good grip on the cube? What's
        your opinion about textured tiles? They look cool but I don't know any
        other cubers personally, so the only speedcubes I've played with are my
        own. - Matt

        Tastes will vary, but I REALLY like the Cubesmith Lexan tiles. Try both
        (textured and non). They are similar, but the textured just has a
        slightly rougher surface. Both have a much better grip than the glossy
        type tiles on the 1982 Ideal Deluxe Cube or Meffert's tiles on the 3x3
        assembly cubes. They are also very thin, so it's not much different than
        stickers as far as overall feel. They don't make the cube seem larger,
        like a Game Cube or Deluxe. The other benefit is they are nearly
        impossible to chip or otherwise mar, so your cube always looks sharp.

        price, they're certainly worth a try. I wish he offered 5x5 lexan tiles.

        Yeah, I got the same problem with the caps too. I thought of not putting
        the caps on, but sometimes the other pieces get caught with the corner
        pieces (because of the hole) resulting in not-so-smooth turns. I ended
        up cutting small gaps in the edges of the caps so that they line up
        nicely with the notches in the corner piece. I then put the caps on and
        sand down the edges so that they are flat. It's a lot of work but the
        cube turns very well now with the corner caps on. Older DIY cubes comes
        with the corner caps installed, so this is a new feature... which brings
        me a lot of extra work! :( I ordered 4 cubes so I have 3 more to work
        on... --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Daniel Jih"

        Oooo sanding is a good idea. Thanks. I suppose it will be some work but

        sometimes the other pieces get caught with &gt; the corner pieces
        (because of the hole) resulting in not-so-smooth &gt; turns. I ended up
        cutting small gaps in the edges of the caps so that &gt; they line up
        nicely with the notches in the corner piece. I then put &gt; the caps on
        and sand down the edges so that they are flat. It's a lot &gt; of work
        but the cube turns very well now with the corner caps on. &gt; &gt;
        Older DIY cubes comes with the corner caps installed, so this is a &gt;
        new feature... which brings me a lot of extra work! :( I ordered 4 &gt;

        &gt; Because I put them on, but they're not exactly perfect so they jut

        the magic doesn't have more solved states and you can't do any moves

        I took the advice of a recent post and used a metal file to sand mine.
        As long as the grain of the file is sufficient to sand the plastic, you
        should be okay. The file I used was even too large but it still did the
        trick. I was going to make a post of this, but I just haven't got any
        good photos yet to help illustrate. But this is a great technique, even
        for store bought cubes. The place where the corner cover is "welded" on
        (or however they do that at the factory) sometimes leaves extra plastic
        attached to the foot of the corner piece. The result is usually not
        noticable, until you get four "bad" pieces lined up the same way on one
        face, with each corner cover occupying the same plane. This puts so much
        tension on the circular track of that face, that suddenly that face will
        seem to turn very rough. If you twist a few of the corners, it will turn
        smooth again. Sanding that part eliminates this effect. Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, My ex-girlfriend lent me a book a while back that I've
        since given back but have been thinking about all along all the same. It
        was a book introducing how to perform speed mental arithmetic. One of
        the most important things they stressed for speed multiplication, is to
        memorize the multiplication tables out to the 25's (so 325 unique
        entries). I am currently working on memorizing these now and was
        wondering if anyone else does, or has done this is the past? I feel like
        memorizing an alg is easy since it's my comfort zone and I've had years
        to practice, but memorizing something like this seems very new to me and
        I don't know the best way to approach it. So far I am working on the
        perfect sqaures beyond 17 (which is as high as I knew before, other than
        easy ones like 20^2), and the 11 times tables because of the really easy
        trick to multiply a number by 11. So anyway, I'm very very interested in
        learning speed mental arithmetic and am looking for others who are or
        have been interested for a while. This is all new to me, and it would be
        awesome to hear some advice from someone who already does this ;-) Also
        does anyone have any advice for memorizing this larger multiplication
        table? Thanks, Chris

        Wow, thanks a lot for figuring out this stuff. Yeah, let's see... so I
        did a blindfold solve for my first interview (15 people all crammed in
        the room watching with a black t-shirt tied around my head), a blindfold
        solve for Ashton Kutcher in another interview, and then that one was my
        third "performance" style blindfold solve. By "performance," I mean that
        if I screw up and fail, it's really bad and looks like I just plain
        suck. I might have to do one this Monday for a press conference. Yikes.

        Good Luck Tyson What the girls should'nt know on BATG for you -1-That
        the champion of the world blindfold 2003 was inspired by a
        magician-cuber no delared (1993-2003) . -2-That it takes much more years
        to become an excellent chess gamer. -3- To have the chance to have an
        official blindfold record because the cube is not really popular. The
        opposite could make it possible to an exceptionally gifted child to
        better. http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=1499 He once saw a man
        doing the puzzle behind his back and was inspired to try it himself. "I
        thought this guy has to have extraordinary vision or something," he
        said. "I thought I'd try it. :=) Gaétan PS:Congradulation for Gunnar and

        It definitely takes many more years to do a lot of other things, such as
        chess, music, athletics, etc. The list is endless. Simply said, the new
        generation of cubers have reached their level of expertise in a very
        short period of time—less than 3 years. Though, I'm not really sure why
        the girls would care about number 1. There are many more important
        things that determine how you get on and succeed on the show, such as
        the way you give your interviews, your interactions between people in
        the house. I must say though, when I went there fore an interview, they
        were strictly looking for sub-2 minute blindfold cubers, and cubers
        inspired by little Japanese boys. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        The end of this episode is indeed special, but assuming that the

        The list is endless. Simply said, &gt; the new generation of cubers have
        reached their level of expertise in a &gt; very short period of
        time—less than 3 years. &gt; &gt; Though, I'm not really sure why the
        girls would care about number 1. &gt; There are many more important
        things that determine how you get on and &gt; succeed on the show, such
        as the way you give your interviews, your &gt; interactions between

        think ? 2006/1/14, Gilles van den Peereboom &lt;gillesvdp@gmail.com&gt;:
        &gt; Btw, how come you are not in the Interview list ? (video link on
        the &gt; main page), there are only 14 people there. &gt; Why are you
        out ? &gt; (and who's the other ? (I'm not familiar with the names.)

        &lt;gillesvdp@gmail.com&gt;: &gt; &gt; The end of this episode is indeed
        special, but assuming that the &gt; &gt; "rock/sing/danse show" was made
        after that dismissal, it could be very &gt; &gt; easy to determine which
        couple was changed. &gt; &gt; I'll take a brief look at that later. &gt;
        &gt; Otherwise I must admit that it's a very funny show and that I
        laught &gt; &gt; quite a lot. &gt; &gt; Tyson will win :p &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &lt;tmao@its.caltech.edu&gt;: &gt; &gt; &gt; It definitely takes many
        more years to do a lot of other things, such &gt; &gt; &gt; as chess,
        music, athletics, etc. The list is endless. Simply said, &gt; &gt; &gt;
        the new generation of cubers have reached their level of expertise in a
        &gt; &gt; &gt; very short period of time—less than 3 years. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though, I'm not really sure why the girls would care
        about number 1. &gt; &gt; &gt; There are many more important things that
        determine how you get on and &gt; &gt; &gt; succeed on the show, such as
        the way you give your interviews, your &gt; &gt; &gt; interactions
        between people in the house. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I must say
        though, when I went there fore an interview, they were &gt; &gt; &gt;
        strictly looking for sub-2 minute blindfold cubers, and cubers inspired
        &gt; &gt; &gt; by little Japanese boys. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Yahoo. Look at their updated privacy statement at
        http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/ About half-way down the page, in
        the section on cookies, you will see a link that says WEB BEACONS. Click
        on the phrase "Web Beacons." On the page that opens, find a paragraph
        entitled "Outside the Yahoo Network." In that section find a little
        "Click Here to Opt Out" link that will let you "opt-out" of their
        snooping. Be careful! NOT to click on the next button shown. It is an
        "Opt Back In" button that, if clicked, will UNDO the opt-out. Note that
        Yahoo's invasion of your privacy - and your ability to opt-out of it -

        about BATG... did you guys notice only 5 teams are sitting at the poker
        table? and tyson isn't one of them...! what happened? and i guess the
        pochmann-method can be fast then ;-) i'm just not very used to blindfold
        solving a very rough calculation... 11 edges with T-permutation + setup
        (and undo) moves --&gt; 11x (14 + 2to4) moves T-permutation and another
        PLL to get corners back in place --&gt; 24 moves 7 corners with some
        algorithm + setup (and undo) moves --&gt; 7x (15 + 2to4) moves more or
        less a total of 337 turns. how many turns do these others systems more
        or less need to complete a cube blindfolded? sander --- Stefan Pochmann

        special, but assuming that the &gt;&gt; "rock/sing/danse show" was made
        after that dismissal, it could be very &gt;&gt; easy to determine which
        couple was changed. &gt;&gt; I'll take a brief look at that later.
        &gt;&gt; Otherwise I must admit that it's a very funny show and that I

        &lt;tmao@...&gt;: &gt;&gt;&gt; It definitely takes many more years to do
        a lot of other things, such &gt;&gt;&gt; as chess, music, athletics,
        etc. The list is endless. Simply said, &gt;&gt;&gt; the new generation
        of cubers have reached their level of expertise &gt;&gt;&gt; in a
        &gt;&gt;&gt; very short period of time—less than 3 years. &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Though, I'm not really sure why the girls would care about
        number 1. &gt;&gt;&gt; There are many more important things that
        determine how you get on &gt;&gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt;&gt; succeed on the
        show, such as the way you give your interviews, your &gt;&gt;&gt;
        interactions between people in the house. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I
        must say though, when I went there fore an interview, they were
        &gt;&gt;&gt; strictly looking for sub-2 minute blindfold cubers, and
        cubers &gt;&gt;&gt; inspired &gt;&gt;&gt; by little Japanese boys.

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see... so I did a
        blindfold solve for my first &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interview
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (15 people all crammed in the room watching with a
        black t-shirt &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tied &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; around my

        "performance" style &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blindfold &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        solve. By "performance," I mean that if I screw up and fail,
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really bad and looks like I
        just plain suck. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I might have

        Hey, I was just curious what the shortest move count for a non-lucky
        solve would be...using Fridrich, and no advanced techniques such as
        Xcross or w/e... Cross: Kinda ambiguous...if it is 1 or 2 moves...some
        ppl consider it lucky...but this will only barely affect the final
        count...I'll use 2 in my count... Pair 1: 3 moves Pair 2: 3 moves Pair
        3: 3 moves Pair 4: 3 moves OLL: 6 moves (i believe this is the shortest
        one) PLL: 9 moves (don't shoot me if I'm wrong) Total: 29 moves Someone
        turning at 3 moves/sec would get sub-10...and if you did Xcross it would
        be less...you would eliminate one pair...maybe 1 sec...I was just
        curious... Craig

        &gt; Craig If you get the H perm or use a 7 move 3 edge cycle, it could
        be 2 shorter. 27 is better than 29. If you allow an easy 2 move xcross,
        that makes for a grand total of 25 for the shortest possible non-lucky
        case. But wait. Better idea: If you do a Roux solve, the best possible
        case is 2 moves for a non-lucky F2B, 6 for the corners, 3 for orienting
        edges and 3 to finish. 14 beats 25 in my book, especially when it only
        involves 1 rotation and no regrips after. :) -Mike

        Hey, &gt; &gt; I was just curious what the shortest move count for a
        non-lucky solve &gt; would be...using Fridrich, and no advanced
        techniques such as Xcross &gt; or w/e... &gt; &gt; Cross: Kinda
        ambiguous...if it is 1 or 2 moves...some ppl consider it &gt;
        lucky...but this will only barely affect the final count...I'll use 2
        &gt; in my count... &gt; Pair 1: 3 moves &gt; Pair 2: 3 moves &gt; Pair
        3: 3 moves &gt; Pair 4: 3 moves &gt; OLL: 6 moves (i believe this is the
        shortest one) &gt; PLL: 9 moves (don't shoot me if I'm wrong) &gt;
        Total: 29 moves &gt; Someone turning at 3 moves/sec would get
        sub-10...and if you did &gt; Xcross it would be less...you would
        eliminate one pair...maybe 1 &gt; sec...I was just curious... &gt; &gt;

        &gt; If you do a Roux solve, the best possible case is 2 moves for a
        &gt; non-lucky F2B, 6 for the corners, 3 for orienting edges and 3 to

        Backwards to scramble. Personally, I hate S moves, so I'd do a y
        adjustment, an M', and another y, but that's it. If you can see ahead of
        time whhere the DF edge is, you can get a head start on solving it,
        changing the two M' turns into a single M2, shortening to a 13 move
        solve. I can't wait until that comes up in competition. :) Leyan, watch
        out. -Mike

        Due to the contest running long, several "run-time" changes were made to
        the competition: - 5x was narrowed down to Frank (since he was the only
        registered contestant who could finish 5 solves in a reasonable time). -
        4x4x4 and 3x-onehanded were run with elimination times. If you finished
        a solve in more than 2:30, you didn't get any more solves. [This one
        killed me when I made a mistake at the end of my fourth one- handed
        solve and had to essentially solve twice, ending up at 2:33. Ouch! No
        average for me :(] - several of the Magic runs were done at a side
        table. [This was fun. Many spectators were crowded around the table
        asking and watching. I actually got applause after my runs, which was
        embarassing given how slow I am.) Despite my personally disappointing
        performance, it was a great contest. More impressions in another

        Tyson, since he puts a tremendous amount of work into organizing,
        publicizing and supervising the contest, tends not to compete (except in
        blindfold). He was regularly talking to press people, keeping things
        going, making run-time decisions on contest timing, and all over the
        place - hopefully he got lunch this time. Jessica Fridrich did not
        compete - no idea why. But if all the young gals in the audience wanted
        someone female to look up to, Casey Pernsteiner is the new idol. I was
        impressed by how calm and smooth her solves were in the final round.

        solved your cube is. That's a DNF then, which is much better than
        disqualification. Was this maybe the reason why Macky DNFed at 4x4? Btw,
        why do the results say DNF for your fifth attempt? That means you were
        allowed a fifth solve. Cheers! Stefan

        All -- Just wanted to give some impressions of this year's contest at
        the Exploratorium. - The competition was fun, as always. Almost 60
        competitors in the 3x, many of them probably in a first competition,
        along with the new format (5 solves per competitor) meant the first
        round ran long. This required some changes to the rest of the events
        which meant contestants didn't get to do as much as they wanted. - For
        next year, I'd suggest having a "side stage" and if people are beyond a
        certain cutoff time (3x world record average?) on their first solve in
        an event, move them to the side stage for the rest of their solves. This
        allows for running things in parallel. The side stage (which was set up
        for the Magic) also allows for the audience to get closer to the action
        (which I must admit was fun when I did my Magic runs). - The grouping
        (bring cubers up in groups to do all their runs at well) works well.
        Though being in the first group made me very nervous - I was shaking
        like a leaf during my solves ... - The crowd was fantastic! There were
        probably close to 200 people watching, of all ages. I regularly talked
        to people in the crowd who were just amazed by the abilities of the
        cubers (one quote: "We didn't even know this was here and we've been
        sitting here all day just transfixed!"). The crowd regularly cheered
        great times and successful blindfold solves. They also liked all the fun
        awards at the end, like 17th place in 3x first round, farthest traveled,
        best camera crew :) - It seemed like Blindfold had a lot of DNF? I'd
        guess that the crowd noise and the need to run four blindfold solvers at
        once made it tough but I didn't compete in blindfold, so I don't know. -
        There was a "Meet the Cubers" table where people would sit and the
        audience could interact with them. It seemed like not too many people
        came by the table? Perhaps if there was a side stage, the table (and the
        merchandise table) could be in that area. Things got a little crowded
        with the cuber waiting area being right next to merchandise and to the
        audience (and to where the press wanted to talk to people). - The press
        could also probably use a couple "pods" where they could get close to
        the action without having to step in front of audience. Perhaps one on
        each side? But, most importantly, any difficulties and changes that
        occurred during the competition were due to success! Many more
        competitors and a huge, appreciative crowd made for a great, exciting
        competition. While I was personally disappointed in how I did, I can't
        deny that everyone had a great time. Many thanks to all the folks who
        organized and ran the competition, and special thanks to Tyson for all
        his hard work! yeff

        Hey everyone, I've known that this happens to me, but tonight I had a
        chance to really test it. I feel like I'm pretty good at blocking out
        distraction when I'm solving, but there is one distraction that I just
        can't handle or block out. If someone counts out the timer during my
        solve I can't block it out, and I've noticed that I subconsciously count
        along with the person instead of devoting all of my attention to
        solving. I was practicing the 4x4x4 when my sister came up and started
        counting every second on the timer as they changed. She seemed to enjoy
        doing this, so I encouraged her to keep it up for a few solves since it
        was really hard to focus when she did this. Here is a list of times that
        I did with her counting along with the seconds as they changed: 1:13.40
        1:12.38 1:16.91 1:17.07 1:09.42 1:27.55 I then did a few solves without
        her counting along: 1:02.12 1:02.16 Then she counted along again:
        1:21.92 1:12.75 Then no counting again: 58.86 1:09.94 1:04.17 Then I did
        two 3x3x3 solves with her counting along: 13.99 17.32 The counting
        didn't seem to affect my concentration when doing the 3x3x3, but when
        solving the 4x4x4 (particularly edges) I had a horrible time trying to
        concentrate when the time was being called out. I tended to rush and
        solve too quickly, and even with really deep breathing I still tried to
        solve too quickly without realizing it. Does anyone else have this
        problem? Is this something that would affect all cubers, or am I just
        the type of person that can't handle this particular type of
        distraction? Also, I find it interesting that hearing the seconds
        counted out during a 3x3x3 doesn't really affect my concentration,
        whereas for the 4x4x4 I have a much harder time doing the solve. Does
        anyone else have a distraction that they just can't handle? Does hearing
        the seconds counted out during your solve mess anyone else up? Chris

        I agree with Mike that the CRC is very good, but be careful. The CRC
        seems to break the plastic down rather quickly. I use it on a new cube
        that I want to smooth out, then use Prestone after that. I'll never put
        the CRC on a Studio Cube again. The soft plastic was worn out within
        weeks, but the 25th anny. cubes don't wear so fast. Matt

        four successful solves, why didn't they count the DNF as your worst
        attempt, the 76.87 as your best, and average the other three? That's an
        average of 105.05, enough for you to be in 17th place, seems to me like
        that would have been fair...or did I miss something in the 2006
        regulations?

        After watching 24 (my whole family is addicted to it), the news previews
        came on and ran down the headlines they would talk about. They mentioned
        the new record (congrats to Leyan by the way), and so I raced back home
        to try to watch it. Turns out I watched for about a half hour before it
        came on, and it ended up being only a 10 second segment! They showed a
        few brief clips of cubes spinning and the newscaster talked over it. He
        got confused and basically said the 11 seconds was a new record for
        one-handed solving. That was a bummer that he screwed up the info, but
        its cool to see cubing in the news, which will hopefully help it spread
        even more. -Chris Parlette --- In

        A DNF would have also meant no fifth solve attempt. The flow of events
        (during the solve) went something like this (As a note, I average about
        1:20-1:30 one-handed): I'm going through the solve and starting my
        4-step LL, and after orienting edges all the corners are oriented as
        well. I think "Ooh, a PLL, should I? Let's go for it!" (I haven't
        practiced PLL one- handed). I screw up, and say (to myself, and to
        proctor): "Dang, I messed up, I'll just take a DNF". Here's the rest of
        the conversation (while I'm starting over from the cross). Proctor:
        Well, if you DNF, you don't get your fifth solve. Me: What? Proctor:
        We're running out of time, so DNF means no more solves. Me: OK, I'll
        finish it. Proctor: And if you finish after 2:30, you don't get your
        fifth solve either. Me: What?!?! Proctor: Yeah, sorry, we're just
        running out of time. Me: Aak! I'd better hurry. I probably could have
        petitioned Tyson for the fifth solve, but I was already mad at myself
        for taking a chance, so I didn't even try. The point that the fifth
        solve should be a DNS, and that I could still have a valid average
        (tossing the DNS and the fastest time) are both reasonable - maybe I can
        petition for an average to be listed. But it would be a 1:45 average,
        and I was shooting for 1:30, so I wouldn't be happy anyway :) yeff ---

        I agree with Mike that the CRC is very good, but be careful. The CRC
        seems to break the plastic down rather quickly. I use it on a new cube
        that I want to smooth out, then use Prestone after that. I'll never put
        the CRC on a Studio Cube again. The soft plastic was worn out within
        weeks, but the 25th anny. cubes don't wear so fast. Matt SPONSORED LINKS

        is a new one I found tonight that's very fast despite being so long. Try
        it. Set up the cube with the inverse. (L'U')(LU'L'U)*2
        (LU'L'U')(RU')(LUR') 19 moves, but after only a little bit of practice,
        I'm already under 2.5 seconds on average with it. I suppose everyone
        else will probably want it in (mostly) RU, so here it is: (RU)(R'URU')*2
        (R'URU)(L'U)(R'U'L) Also, try as I might, I still can't find a better
        alg for this case or its mirror(inverse to scramble):
        (LU')(R'U)(LU'R)U'(RUR'URU2R') For that and the mirror, I average around
        2.75, but I've never found a better alg for it. Does anyone else use
        this? -Mike

        find that you almost say their names out loud, maybe even holding them

        rule is: "If during a round a competitor does not solve within the time
        limit, then his solve may (courtesy of main judge) be stopped and
        disqualified by the judge. The main judge decides whether the competitor
        can continue the round, f.i. if the time was exceeded because of a
        puzzle defect." I had read it like "If you're still solving at the time
        limit, the judge can stop you and eliminate you from the round". So I
        thought if you stop the timer *yourself* then the rest of the rule
        including the elimination wouldn't apply. So what you should do instead
        is pop or break the puzzle by dropping it on the floor. Oh well, I guess
        I'll just try to never get into the situation :-) Cheers! Stefan

        &lt;gillesvdp@...&gt;: &gt; &gt;&gt; The end of this episode is indeed
        special, but assuming that the &gt; &gt;&gt; "rock/sing/danse show" was

        determine which couple was changed. &gt; &gt;&gt; I'll take a brief look
        at that later. &gt; &gt;&gt; Otherwise I must admit that it's a very
        funny show and that I laught &gt; &gt;&gt; quite a lot. &gt; &gt;&gt;

        &gt;&gt; 2006/1/14, Tyson Mao &lt;tmao@...&gt;: &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It
        definitely takes many more years to do a lot of other things, such &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; as chess, music, athletics, etc. The list is endless.
        Simply said, &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the new generation of cubers have reached
        their level of expertise &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in a &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; very
        short period of time�less than 3 years. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Though, I'm not really sure why the girls would care about
        number 1. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There are many more important things that
        determine how you get on &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; succeed
        on the show, such as the way you give your interviews, your &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; interactions between people in the house. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I must say though, when I went there fore an
        interview, they were &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; strictly looking for sub-2 minute
        blindfold cubers, and cubers &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; inspired &gt;

        To have the chance to have an official blindfold record &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because the cube is not really popular. The opposite

        did a blindfold solve for my first &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interview &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (15 people all crammed in the room watching with a

        "performance" style &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blindfold &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solve. By "performance," I mean that if I screw up

        Hello everybody, I've been speed cubing for about two years. I've played
        with the cube for years and years, my dad was always into the cube, his
        interest in it was passed to me. Now, at age 17, I can solve the cube in
        50 seconds using a layered method. I've studied the Fridrich method but
        have been bombed with school my senior year, and just went back my old
        method. I am going to try and learn the Fridrich Method again for the
        first two layers and some basic ZB method algs Do you have any
        suggestions?

        i was doing an average on the clock... first 12 solves were: 9,61 9,81

        sec) I already asked Stefan some time ago what he thinks is lucky and
        not lucky when solving the clock. i agreed with him that skipping 1 or 2
        out of 14 steps isn't lucky since it happens a lot. i don't know the
        exact probability, but i solved plenty to know it happens a lot :-) the
        7,83 time had 2 steps skipped in the front cross and all other steps had
        to be done, but of course the corners at the back were extremely easy
        too. (twice 1, once 10 and once 11 o' clock or something, which goes
        very very fast) yet i'm not sure wether i should post it or not... but
        then again, if you make sure you solve like a gazillion, you are sure to
        get an easy case from time to time. so what do you guys think should be
        considered lucky for the clock? sander

        Pedro: M' E2 M E2 is the one I'm trying to get away from in the first
        place. Because multi-slice algs are more prone to lockups plus you have
        to regrip a bit, and since my (only) cube isn't great, I'd much prefer
        to use a different one. Gilles says it takes him 1 second (about) to
        execute M' E2 M E2. It takes me about 2.70 seconds to do that one :P.
        And with the other alg I discovered, I can execute it in 1.58 (fastest)
        and 1.60 (average). It also solves PLSE in a more 'pure' way (MU!).
        Stefan, your alg is fun, but I can't seem to get it to flow very well,
        it's probibly just me though. Regarding slice moves, I now execute the
        M' as a single move, (no r'R) usually with the ring finger of my left
        hand, and I do a ring-middle for an M2. I solve M differently as I
        optimised my solving M for each alg I use (yes, I actually went through
        every orientation and worked out different ways of doing finger tricks
        and algs. I can solve the two opposite edges flipped on top in 1.05 :)
        Mike, I'm very excited for the launch of your site :D &gt; What are the
        things you would want to see included most on another &gt; Roux site?
        Mostly alternative ways of going about something. I especially wanna see
        your LSE approach. Alternative algs! CMLL mostly with COLL recognition
        helpers :) Oh, and have the backwards verssions to setup the cases for
        easyer practise. Different stratergies (like turning it into a faux-CF
        and things) Mostly help with the F2B :S little tricks like to swap two
        edges or flip two - they're always fun. That's all for now, if it's not
        asking too much :P &gt; How interested would you be in learning new
        algorithms to be able to &gt; solve the cube in fewer moves with Roux?
        Not so much fewer moves, but faster sequences than I'm using now. I
        solve in about 57 moves, so I could drop 9 somewhere I'd like to find
        where I could get rid of them aswell as speeding up though. &gt; How
        many new algs would you be willing to learn? As many as it takes to be
        faster :) The only limit is time really, not the amount of algs.
        Although 100 sounds a nice value to be going on with. (long algs, not
        things like M'UM - they don't count as hard to learn :P). &gt; How would
        you like to see the cases shown (java applets, imagecube, U &gt; face
        diagrams, etc.)? LSE would be hard to do with face diagrams. I think
        java is your best bet, but usually it crashes my browser to have more
        than one running on a page. I think it's best to do it similar to gilles
        (imagecube?) and show the alg, I mean you can work out what it does just
        from the alg, really. &gt; Any other suggestions? Not really. It'd be
        nice to have a section on helpful tips and tricks. Such as, inverted and
        opposite block building. I like how I'm now able to start on one of four
        blocks, and then I'm even able to build the second upside-down. It's
        gotten to the point where they just all feel like the same block. Doing
        the corners after that is also easy, and I can always solve it in two or
        less moves, recognition time is almost zero, I have a handy little
        system I use to check. Oh! Recently I've been trying to combine OLSE and
        PLSE into the same step, I've done it a few times, it's like the
        optimisations gilles suggests, really. &gt; Also, Thom, I've completely
        switched to your 4 centers alg. I prefer to do it like (M'UM'U')*3,
        though. 12 turns in under 1.7 seconds! 1.58, sub-1.5 is possible. Race
        you to it :P ~Thom :: Sorry about this post, my spelling has gone out
        the window since I left high school.

        Well the Megaminx seems like a logical choice (mefferts.com). But if you
        want a slightly different challenge, get yourself a Square-1 (also known

        for the L5E. There are only 16 or so, and nearly half of those are just
        mirrors, so it shouldn't be difficult. As for the two opposite edges,
        eventually, the method I'm developing will avoid those cases that aren't
        oriented or the 3 edges on top 100% of the time. &gt; Mostly alternative
        ways of going about something. I especially wanna &gt; see your LSE
        approach. &gt; Alternative algs! CMLL mostly with COLL recognition
        helpers :) &gt; Oh, and have the backwards verssions to setup the cases
        for easyer &gt; practise. &gt; Different stratergies (like turning it
        into a faux-CF and things) &gt; Mostly help with the F2B :S little
        tricks like to swap two edges or &gt; flip two - they're always fun. I
        will list all of the algs I use, and provide more than one alg for each
        case most of the time. My method involves COLL, so I will obviously post
        those algs. I can list inverses for setup, too. I got a solve yesterday
        where the D corners were all finished before the solve, so I used COLL
        to fix the others. I finished with a generic corners first solution (not
        very efficient and averages ~65 moves) for a 23.36. I think I may
        include a page about tricks like this when I finish. &gt; Not so much
        fewer moves, but faster sequences than I'm using now. I &gt; solve in
        about 57 moves, so I could drop 9 somewhere I'd like to find &gt; where
        I could get rid of them aswell as speeding up though. We got the
        (M'UM'U')*3 alg to over 12 moves/second, and I'm sure we can optimize
        the L5E algs similarly. These will be lightning fast once mastered. &gt;
        As many as it takes to be faster :) The only limit is time really, not
        &gt; the amount of algs. Although 100 sounds a nice value to be going on
        &gt; with. (long algs, not things like M'UM - they don't count as hard
        to &gt; learn :P). The full system would use about 78 distinct cases,
        and about 60 mirrors. 138 total is not so bad, especially when 40 of
        those are COLL. Almost all of the rest are algs to insert a pair and
        orient edges, so they are much shorter than LL algs. &gt; LSE would be
        hard to do with face diagrams. I think java is your best &gt; bet, but
        usually it crashes my browser to have more than one running &gt; on a
        page. I think it's best to do it similar to gilles (imagecube?) &gt; and
        show the alg, I mean you can work out what it does just from the &gt;
        alg, really. The COLL algs will wind up with a diagram as on Lars
        Vandenbergh's page. I think I will use imagecube images for almost every
        other case. &gt; Not really. It'd be nice to have a section on helpful
        tips and tricks. &gt; Such as, inverted and opposite block building. I
        like how I'm now able &gt; to start on one of four blocks, and then I'm
        even able to build the &gt; second upside-down. It's gotten to the point
        where they just all feel &gt; like the same block. Doing the corners
        after that is also easy, and I &gt; can always solve it in two or less
        moves, recognition time is almost &gt; zero, I have a handy little
        system I use to check. I would be interested in learning about how you
        recognize mixed block corners quickly, as this has been difficult for
        me. That is definitely something I want to go on my site. Please email

        Yeah, my vote would go to the megaminx. What's not fun about a 12 sided
        Rubik's cube? I like it because it solves just like a 3x3 for the most
        part, but has its own little challenges. It isn't something you should
        need to look up a solution for. Plus it looks really cool. I like my

        138 isn't bad. Shouldn't take more than a year. I've got more ideas and
        things but I'm simply too tired right now, I'll catch you tomorrow
        sometime. ~Thom stuff follows.... === Stay with me on this one, most of
        it is blaringly obvious === I solve with green on top and blue on
        bottom, yellow/white to the sides. This will be a little rushed because
        I'm... I have no excuse, this will be rushed. Basically, for CMLL/COLL
        with roux, you recognise the cases manually for each mix of
        normal/inverted corners, there are only six for each case (are they? I
        think I'm confused about the mix of normal/inverted for each one) and
        you don't need to learn the algs, just where to apply which ones. This
        is handy because you learn it subconciously while you're solving, I've
        learnt a couple of them this way and I don't even know a full CMLL :). A
        chart would probibly help aswell.... Usually, they're the same and most
        of the time you can guess which alg the facelets want, I think only a
        few times I've not been able to work it out or I've done the wrong alg.
        Then, my two-step. I suggest you use the two-step then progress to the
        one step gradually (very...) Lets see if I can remember.... |B|| ||B| |
        || || | |G|| ||G| if two corners are alright, place them towards you and
        adjacent swap :) both alright, continue. non alright, opposite swap.
        |B|| ||G| | || || | |G|| ||B| Always a swap to adjacent corners, little
        harder, still easy. What you do is 'search for the bruno'. Look for
        where the white and yellow colours form a bruno shape. This is a little
        weird. Position it so it's 'sitting' if you get what I mean. (stickers
        on UFL, UFR, ULB and URB). and do roux adjacent swap, (swap ULB and
        URB). and it'll be done. I was about to suggest that because solved
        produces bruno, we should look into other configurations to learn,
        because the white stickers produce other orientation patterns. probibly
        too much work. Besides, gilles has got the general idea under possible
        improvment on his site.

        I've seen pictures of a cube that has different shaped studs sticking
        out of each face for someone who's blind, or someone who wants to solve
        it without using sight at all. Is this just a collectible? Is there
        anywhere I can actually buy one? Meffert's doesn't have anything like
        it. - Matt -- http://procool.blogspot.com [Non-text portions of this

        be fishing line Anyway you kept folding the sections this way and that
        until you solved the puzzle. I had two of these and really loved them
        and now both have broken line or whatever and theres no way to repair
        them. So does anyone know what this game was called and then does anyone

        Hello Everyone I had a great time at the Competition this saturday. It
        was great to see people I have met before, and to meet some new people.
        I was happy to see the large number of competitors, as well as the large
        amount of media coverage. The venue was awsome as well. I wish I had had
        the time to check out all of the Exhibits. My best avg with ROUX so far:
        24.97. I am currently a 25 sec cuber. My avg in 1st Round 24.67: (23.23,
        22.92, 34.42, 23.51, 27.14) I was very happy with my performance in the
        1st round. Since the 2nd round had been Axed for time constraints, I
        considered myself lucky to make the finals. I originally thought that I
        would only get 5 solves, which would have been fine (Hey I only got 3 in
        Orlando). I got really nervous in the Finals, and messed up my 1st and
        2nd cubes BADLY. However,I managed a 21.63 for my 3rd solve, so I was
        happy with that. I think that Everyone in the Finals used Fridrich
        except myself and LArs Petrus. I was happy to represent the small ROUX
        crowd. Im excited about this Method, as I have just switched 8 weeks
        ago. Once I take the time to learn fast CLL Algs, sub 20 should be no
        problem. JASON KOVACIC

        Yeah, Leyan took it up the butt from reporters yesterday. Why did they
        all suddenly decide that they would hound us on Monday? Leyan's birthday
        isn't for awhile, but I'm buying him one of those metal things that

        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It definitely takes many more years to do a lot of
        other things, such &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; as chess, music, athletics,
        etc. The list is endless. Simply said, &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the new
        generation of cubers have reached their level of expertise &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; in a &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; very short period of time—less
        than 3 years. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Though, I'm
        not really sure why the girls would care about number 1. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; There are many more important things that determine how you
        get on &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; succeed on the
        show, such as the way you give your interviews, your &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; interactions between people in the house. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I must say though, when I went there
        fore an interview, they were &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; strictly looking for
        sub-2 minute blindfold cubers, and cubers &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        inspired &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; by little Japanese boys. &gt; &gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see... so I did a blindfold solve for
        my first &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interview &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (15 people all crammed in the room watching with a
        black t-shirt &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tied &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; around my head), a blindfold solve for Ashton
        Kutcher in another &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interview, and then
        that one was my third "performance" style &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        blindfold &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solve. By "performance," I mean
        that if I screw up and fail, &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really bad and looks like I just plain suck. &gt;

        Congratulations Sander, it looks like we're gonna have a high record in
        Belgium :-) About the Lucky cases, it's hard to tell because with
        Stefan's Method : you have 2 kind of lucky cases : - the one you like
        (skipping steps) - the ones you don't like (cases that makes you change
        the method) So if the "luck" you have is of the second type, i'd say
        "non-lucky" (because you actually don't use them), but of course if you
        skip 5 steps...that's kind of lucky... Gilles. 2006/1/16, sander
        hendrickx &lt;sanderhendrickx@...m&gt;: &gt; i was doing an average on
        the clock... &gt; first 12 solves were: &gt; &gt; 9,61 9,81 9,27 9,69
        10,36 10,83 10,14 10,41 9,83 10,16 &gt; 8,39 7,83 &gt; (average 9,77
        sec) &gt; &gt; I already asked Stefan some time ago what he thinks is
        &gt; lucky and not lucky when solving the clock. i agreed &gt; with him
        that skipping 1 or 2 out of 14 steps isn't &gt; lucky since it happens a
        lot. i don't know the exact &gt; probability, but i solved plenty to
        know it happens a &gt; lot :-) &gt; the 7,83 time had 2 steps skipped in
        the front cross &gt; and all other steps had to be done, but of course
        the &gt; corners at the back were extremely easy too. (twice 1, &gt;
        once 10 and once 11 o' clock or something, which goes &gt; very very
        fast) &gt; yet i'm not sure wether i should post it or not... but &gt;
        then again, if you make sure you solve like a &gt; gazillion, you are
        sure to get an easy case from time &gt; to time. &gt; so what do you
        guys think should be considered lucky &gt; for the clock? &gt; &gt;

        Interesting, would it be possible to define something like that for the
        cube ? in order to avoid scrambles that give you for example more than 2
        pairs of pieces attached together ? But then we have a problem because
        there are different methods. So what's lucky for someone might not be
        the same for another person. But is a "measure of luck" possible to
        define for the cube or not ? Gilles. 2006/1/17, Stefan Pochmann

        lucky when solving the clock. i agreed &gt; &gt; with him that skipping
        1 or 2 out of 14 steps isn't &gt; &gt; lucky since it happens a lot. i
        don't know the exact &gt; &gt; probability, but i solved plenty to know
        it happens a &gt; &gt; lot :-) &gt; &gt; the 7,83 time had 2 steps
        skipped in the front cross &gt; &gt; and all other steps had to be done,
        but of course the &gt; &gt; corners at the back were extremely easy too.
        (twice 1, &gt; &gt; once 10 and once 11 o' clock or something, which
        goes &gt; &gt; very very fast) &gt; &gt; yet i'm not sure wether i
        should post it or not... but &gt; &gt; then again, if you make sure you
        solve like a &gt; &gt; gazillion, you are sure to get an easy case from
        time &gt; &gt; to time. &gt; &gt; so what do you guys think should be

        &gt; Try (U2D2)M' (U2D2)M' &gt; &gt; Why take 12 moves over 6? &gt; &gt;
        Jason Kovacic Because you can fingertrick every single one of those 12,
        and those six are awful. They're basically multislice moves by turning
        the actual cube at the same time. You can even solve this state in 3
        moves, but you wouldn't want to, as I and mike can solve the 12 moves
        faster than those three in any case. Also, I've said this about three
        times now. It's purer. ~Thom

        2006/1/14, Tyson Mao &lt;tmao@...&gt;: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It
        definitely takes many more years to do a lot of other things, &gt; such
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; as chess, music, athletics, etc. The list is
        endless. Simply &gt; said, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the new
        generation of cubers have reached their level of expertise &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; very short period of
        time�less than 3 years. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Though, I'm not really sure why the girls would care about
        number &gt; 1. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There are many more important
        things that determine how you get on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; succeed on the show, such as the way you
        give your interviews, &gt; your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; interactions
        between people in the house. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; I must say though, when I went there fore an interview,
        they were &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; strictly looking for sub-2 minute
        blindfold cubers, and cubers &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; inspired &gt;

        If you haven't yet tried modifying your cube, a can of silicon spray is
        cheap. Take it apart, lube it up, and see if you like it. The nice part
        about cubing is all the parts are really cheap. If it turns out your
        cube sucks as a speedcube, you can just go get another one and keep this
        one as a spare. Then you'll have more than one Rubik's cube, which gets
        you big points on the geek test. On 1/17/06, thebunze

        forcing you to use it, use whichever you prefer. Gawd... &gt; Also, do
        you use non-matching blocks? I'm having a load of difficulty &gt; making
        sense out of Thom's post about them. Am I missing something &gt; really
        easy? Yeah, I didn't really explain it well at all, but I don't know how
        to explain it better... The main method I use solves them in two steps.
        Because I use the block upside down when I create non-mathing blocks, I
        see the green and blue as one colour and fix the orientation of them,
        that bit is really not that hard. Then the permutation you look for the
        arrangement of the green/blue corners pieces, and act accordingly
        looking at my post. I'll get some U graphs up to explain what I mean, is
        there an easy way of generating them or do I have to GIMP it up? Someone
        should make U-face pics imagecube-style. TODO: Explain non-mathing
        blocks better. ;) ~Thom

        Hi, I have just uploaded a cube emulator that I have developed for Java
        enabled mobile devices (phones, PDAs etc). I started off trying to sell
        it but now I am giving it away free, so feel free to use it and pass it
        on to anyone you think might want it. The program works fine on my Sony
        Ericsson K750 and I know it also works on the K700 and T630. It should
        in theory run on any Java enabled colour device with at least 128 * 128
        pixels, although it might not be as fast on older devices. I can usually
        solve this in about 2 or 3 minutes and on a real cube I take about 30
        seconds. I think it would be possible to get sub-minute with the
        emulator. The file I have uploaded is 'Morrix Cube ZIP File'. It
        contains four files: MorrixCube.jar The jar file containing the program.
        MorrixCube.jad A descriptor file (usually not needed). Morrix Cube
        Demo.gif An animated gif showing how the emulator looks. readme.txt
        Information about the program. Extract these files to your PC and read
        the readme.txt file for instructions on how to install the emulator.
        Good luck with it and let me know how it goes. Party on, Jim

        fyi, Leyan's new WR also was mentioned in Jay Leno's monologue last
        night [late night talk show here in the US]. anyone else catch that?
        Congrats again to Leyan on his awesome time! the joke is mentioned on
        Leno's website and went something like: A twenty-year-old student at
        Caltech set a new world's record when he solved the Rubik's Cube in
        eleven seconds -- eleven seconds! -- which would be pretty impressive if
        this was 1983. (He also made some crack about not being able to get his
        out of the box in 11 seconds; and how he had to take his apart in order
        to solve it again) I went to the site to see if I could get the clip,
        but it's not up... --Kirk --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        How many cubes do you guys own? I own two 3x3x3 cubes, both the 25th

        also wonder about buying replacement stickers etc... after less than a
        month of "serious cubing", i've already worn down my cube a
        significantly. I was thinking about buying new stickers online, but then
        I heard you guys talking about rubik's cube tiles to add instead of
        stickers? What kind of accessories do you guys have/recommend? Are there
        other kinds of rubik's cubes I can buy? Higher quality ones maybe?

        It means it's like a setup move, and it's not really part of the

        R, instead of D' D2 R' D B' D' B D' R I would suggest doing F2L with the
        cross on the bottom, though, and for this case doing (R U R' U')*3 or

        Tonight David Letterman announced that Leyan Lo would be on the show. It
        turned out to be a spoof, where some guy (claiming to be Leyan Lo) tried
        to solve it and gave up in disgust. Kind of a lame stunt... why not just
        have Leyan on for real? Still, it's kind of amazing the coverage this
        has been getting all week.

        Tastes will vary, but I REALLY like the Cubesmith Lexan tiles. Try &gt;
        &gt; both (textured and non). They are similar, but the textured just
        has &gt; &gt; a slightly rougher surface. Both have a much better grip
        than the &gt; &gt; glossy type tiles on the 1982 Ideal Deluxe Cube or
        Meffert's tiles on &gt; &gt; the 3x3 assembly cubes. They are also very
        thin, so it's not much &gt; &gt; different than stickers as far as
        overall feel. They don't make the &gt; &gt; cube seem larger, like a
        Game Cube or Deluxe. The other benefit is &gt; &gt; they are nearly
        impossible to chip or otherwise mar, so your cube &gt; &gt; always looks
        sharp. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        Hello, I have just started speedcubing since I got my cube at Christmas,
        I am loving it. In addition to the 3x3x3 cube I received, I have also
        gotten a 4x4x4 cube. However, it does not turn nearly as nicely as by
        regular cube. I have silicon spray, which worked great on the smaller
        cube, but I am wondering, will the lubricant make the larger cube too
        loose? I understand that these cubes are looser to begin with, but I am
        wondering what people do to make them turn nicer.

        Silicone does work nicely on the larger cubes, but don't use a lot. Also
        I think it's better to work in the cube for a while without any lube to
        wear it down a little more smoothly first. Once the larger cubes wear
        down from use they start popping (think explosion) so you want to try to
        delay that process as long as possible. I use a small amount of lube in
        the larger cubes, but you have to apply it a little more often than for
        a 3x3x3. I'd say I lube the 4x4 once every two weeks or so, and I tend
        to lube the 3x3 about once every 3-4 weeks. Hope that helps, Chris ---

        my method, let me know. Enjoy. My homepage:

        It's not a big deal at all. I'm just pointing it out so that if you're
        in a magic competition, please don't start your hands like that. The
        idea of the regulations is so that there is no ambiguity that there is
        puzzle manipulation before the timer is started. If your fingers are
        over the Magic like that, there is a slight bit of ambiguity. Not much,
        not likely, but why take a risk? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute

        Bravo Quinn! Man i can't even imagine 15 minutes of turning brand new
        store-bought cubes. Ouch!! If I ever saw 30 scrambled store bought cubes
        and people wanting me to solve them, I would turn the other way. -David

        Hmm that's an interesting idea, but it would require that generate a
        series of random numbers from lets say 1-10. The you would need a for
        loop for 10 outputs and so depending on what number it generates, you
        need a if-then-else statement telling it to output something for that
        number. Like if it generates 1 you output U, generates 2, output U',
        generates 3, output U2 etc etc etc. Actually you probably need more than
        1-10... but that's just how sophisticated you want it to be. Good luck.

        What specifically do you need help with? It doesn't sound like it would
        be very difficult. The way I would do it would be something like: Make a
        list of different moves: R, R', U, U', B, B', L, L', D, D' should work
        Set a loop to run a few lines of code, say, 30 times. In that loop,
        generate a random number from 1 to 10 (assumign you have 10 diff moves
        from above) Also in that loop, have a bunch of IF statements to
        translate the random number into its corresponding move. One way to do
        it would simply be something like: IF &lt;variable&gt; = 1 THEN
        &lt;something&gt; = "R" IF &lt;variable&gt; = 2 THEN &lt;something&gt; =
        "R'" IF &lt;variable&gt; = 3 THEN &lt;something&gt; = "L" IF
        &lt;variable&gt; = 4 THEN &lt;something&gt; = "L''" IF &lt;variable&gt;
        = 5 THEN &lt;something&gt; = "B" IF &lt;variable&gt; = 6 THEN
        &lt;something&gt; = "B''' etc The most tricky part (which still isn't
        very tricky at all) is determinien what to with the &lt;something&gt;.
        What you might be able to do is designate a string variable (text). In
        some languages, if you use addition on a string variable. Then, just say
        something like: &lt;something&gt; = &lt;something&gt; + &lt;whichever
        move was picked&gt; Once that's done, you'd have a string variable with
        the random scramble in it, and you'd just have to display it. I don't
        know how much you know about TI programming, but this should at least
        give you a start... lf you decide to do it, and want to try my way, i'd
        be glad to help if you had any specific questions... I'd actually be
        interested in having such a program if it was completed. (although i
        have the TI-89, and never use my 83+) Anyways that's just my suggestion,
        there is prolly a better way to do it, but my way is probably the
        simplest. David undermostfiend &lt;undermostfiend@...&gt; wrote: can

        you know about TI programming, but this should at least give you a
        start... lf you decide to do it, and want to try my way, i'd be glad to
        help if you had any specific questions.. . I'd actually be interested in
        having such a program if it was completed. (although i have the TI-89,
        and never use my 83+) &gt; &gt; Anyways that's just my suggestion, there
        is prolly a better way to do it, but my way is probably the simplest.

        help with? It doesn't sound like it would be very difficult. The way I
        would do it would be something like: &gt; &gt; Make a list of different
        moves: R, R', U, U', B, B', L, L', D, D' should work &gt; &gt; Set a
        loop to run a few lines of code, say, 30 times. &gt; &gt; In that loop,
        generate a random number from 1 to 10 (assumign you have 10 diff moves
        from above) &gt; &gt; Also in that loop, have a bunch of IF statements
        to translate the random number into its corresponding move. One way to
        do it would simply be something like: &gt; &gt; IF &lt;variable&gt; = 1
        THEN &lt;something&gt; = "R" &gt; IF &lt;variable&gt; = 2 THEN
        &lt;something&gt; = "R'" &gt; IF &lt;variable&gt; = 3 THEN
        &lt;something&gt; = "L" IF &lt;variable&gt; = 4 THEN &lt;something&gt; =
        "L''" &gt; IF &lt;variable&gt; = 5 THEN &lt;something&gt; = "B" &gt; IF
        &lt;variable&gt; = 6 THEN &lt;something&gt; = "B''' &gt; &gt; etc &gt;
        &gt; The most tricky part (which still isn't very tricky at all) is
        determinien what to with the &lt;something&gt;. What you might be able
        to do is designate a string variable (text). In some languages, if you
        use addition on a string variable. Then, just say something like:
        &lt;something&gt; = &lt;something&gt; + &lt;whichever move was
        picked&gt; &gt; &gt; Once that's done, you'd have a string variable with
        the random scramble in it, and you'd just have to display it. &gt; &gt;

        I agree, I've had a DIY for about...3 months and its very good. Also,
        about the white DIY's with arched centers: BEWARE!! They are not the
        same as the black DIYs, I can't really tell the difference in how they
        are made, but the white DIY's still tend to pop more than blacks. So
        once Rubik's.com restocks their inventory I would reccomend the black
        DIY's. One question, I think I've put together 6 DIY kits, 2 black, 2
        new white, and 2 old white and for all of the arched centers the center
        caps had some protrusion on both sides that did not let it pop in the
        centers easily. Although on the 2 older white cubes I put together the
        caps fit in perfectly. Anyone else have that problem? -David

        John, If you check the files section, 89timer is a program I wrote to
        time, scramble, and keep averages of cube solves. You should be able to
        pull up the code (or let me know and I'll send it to you). The scrambler
        isn't quite the same as a competition scrambler, but it does an adequate
        job IMHO. The 89-basic code should be very similar to the 83 basic code.

        The newest batch of regular Hasbro/Winning Moves cubes are good, too. I
        got one of the Restoration Hardware cubes that turned great, then an
        anniversary cube that was just as good. Both are dated 10/05 on the
        manufacturing code. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Yeah, those centers must be the same ones they use on factory- assembled
        cubes. Therefore they are made to be easy to glue on. Unfortunately that
        stinks for tuning. My solution is just to use a tiny drop of glue on
        each tab, so that later removal of the caps is not a big deal for
        retuning. Like Stefan, I hate using glue, but no other solution has
        worked for me on the DIY kits. The older white ones used the same (or
        similar) mold as Rubik's Studio cubes, and they pop in easily and stay
        in. The new design is probably cheaper to make since the walls of the
        center piece are thinner. It also makes the cube lighter. Chris --- In

        Anyone else have that problem?

        1) make a cross on 1 side 2) practice a lot so you can make 4

        the F2L (first 2 layers) 3) do last layer with 4-look Fridrich method

        for 1 case and take the one you like best. then if you really plan on
        getting fast, you can go from 4-look to 3-look and eventually to 2-look
        fridrich (orient all in 1 step and permute all in 1 step) and learn some

        the Gilles Roux method, but I can't really &gt; understand the 3rd step,
        with the corners. Could someone please help &gt; me figure it out? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Congrats on deciding to use this method. I
        personally feel like it's given far too little attention. Glad to see
        someone else trying it out. :) As far as that step, it's trying to
        accomplish two things: correct corner placement (relative to eachother)
        and correct corner orientation. As a beginner, you should probably aim
        to do it in two steps. Pick one sequence that changes two adjacent
        corners ignoring whatever it does to the orientation. Same goes for one
        sequence to switch two opposite corners. That's whichever alg you like
        best from columns 2-5, and whichever you like best from column 6. Then,
        learn the 7 cases to orient corners when the permutation is correct. 9
        algs to always solve corners in two steps or less. It can be very, very
        fast. Once you have those mastered, try to learn the rest of the cases
        for the fastest possible step. If recognition is what you're having
        trouble with, try twisting the top layer (mentally, if you can), to
        match up two corners with their correct positions. If the corners are
        next to eachother, and the other two are also correct, the permutation
        is already done. If they are next to eachother and the others are
        incorrect, then use your adjacent swap alg. If they are opposite
        eachother with the other two incorrect, use your other swap alg. Then,
        orient according to the pattern that comes up. Hope this helps. I'll put
        a page explaining this in detail up on my site sometime in the next few
        days when I have time. Thanks for the idea. Keep us updated on your
        progress. -Mike Bennett

        I love programming with my TI-83. I've made around 20 games and programs
        for it, with it's simple "language". When you make a pogram with a lot
        of lines it's quite hard to know what is where in the code, but that's
        part of the challange. My goal is always to make as small codes as
        possible, e.g. as few bytes as possible. /Gunnar --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Make a list of different moves: R, R', U, U', B, B',
        L, L', D, D' &gt; should work &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Set a loop to run a
        few lines of code, say, 30 times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In that loop,
        generate a random number from 1 to 10 (assumign you &gt; have 10 diff
        moves from above) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also in that loop, have a bunch of
        IF statements to translate the &gt; random number into its corresponding
        move. One way to do it would &gt; simply be something like: &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; IF &lt;variable&gt; = 1 THEN &lt;something&gt; = "R" &gt; &gt;
        IF &lt;variable&gt; = 2 THEN &lt;something&gt; = "R'" &gt; &gt; IF
        &lt;variable&gt; = 3 THEN &lt;something&gt; = "L" IF &lt;variable&gt; =

        &lt;something&gt; = "B''' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The most tricky part (which still isn't very tricky at all) is &gt;
        determinien what to with the &lt;something&gt;. What you might be able
        to do &gt; is designate a string variable (text). In some languages, if
        you use &gt; addition on a string variable. Then, just say something
        like: &gt; &lt;something&gt; = &lt;something&gt; + &lt;whichever move
        was picked&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once that's done, you'd have a string
        variable with the random &gt; scramble in it, and you'd just have to
        display it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know how much you know about TI
        programming, but this &gt; should at least give you a start... lf you
        decide to do it, and want &gt; to try my way, i'd be glad to help if you

        such a program if it was &gt; completed. (although i have the TI-89, and

        Hello It caught my attention when I saw someone new learning the Roux
        method. I have only been using it for 2 months and already had
        remarkable progress. I am finally sub 25 consistently and with no step 3
        algs. There are 2 things you are trying to do, ORIENT and PERMUTE top
        corners. I still do this in 2 steps, but once you learn all of the algs,
        it is only 1 step. Here are the first 10 you need to learn A2 (RB'R) F2
        (R'BR) F2 R2 3 cycle corners B1 [U] (RU2R'U')(RU'R') antisune/ inverse
        of C1 C1 (RUR')U(RU2R') sune/ inverse of B1 D4 [U'] (FR'F'R)(URU'R')

        (RUR')U(RU'R'U)(RU2R') sune twice I do not recommend learning Step 3
        from Gilles Site. While I do love the method, I don't like CMLL. And I
        don't like how not all of the algs are written down. I am completing
        tables of CLL algs and COLL algs, but I think that I am going to abandon
        the idea of learning both. For CMLL, you always have to have the blocks
        on the L and R. With CLL or COLL, you have more flexability, to do the
        alg from any angle. I hope this helps and keep us informed of your

        Solving the first two layers at the same time is different than your
        method. Concentrate on making a cross on the top face and then getting
        the corners and the side edges in place together _at the same time_.
        This is called F2L (First Two Layers). Even cheap cubes are fine to
        learn on. You'll probably make a significant improvement in your time by
        cleaning and greasing it. Most people use silicon spray to lubricate the
        cube. You'd need to do this even with a better cube. - Matt On 1/19/06,

        There are many fast cubers out there, but my question to the group
        is...Which cuber has been most influential to you overall? Perhaps it is
        someone who got you started, or someone who inspired you in crucial
        points of your "cubing career". Think it over and send me an email

        &gt; I do not recommend learning Step 3 from Gilles Site. &gt; While I
        do love the method, I don't like CMLL. And I don't like how &gt; not all
        of the algs are written down. &gt; &gt; I am completing tables of CLL
        algs and COLL algs, but I think that I &gt; am going to abandon the idea
        of learning both. For CMLL, you always &gt; have to have the blocks on
        the L and R. With CLL or COLL, you have &gt; more flexability, to do the
        alg from any angle. w00t another roux solver... Considering Gilles
        executes the algs on that page in 2 seconds or under, I think it's quite
        worth it. I used to think I'd learn CMLL with COLL style-recognition,
        but I've abandoned this since gilles told me to, and I've noticed I have
        faster recognition learning this way. I don't see the fact that they
        arn't all written down a problem. Firstly, it's not exacly hard to do a
        written down alg backwards or mirrored. Secondly, you have a better
        understanding of the whole step, you being to notice just how closly
        most of the algs are related. You say you can solve from any angle, so
        I'll assume you mean with the blocks on U and B (considering you've not
        learnt COLL, I doubt you've learnt the 4x48 algs needed to do a 'true'
        from every angle solve). Well, how often do you have blocks on U and B.
        In every single solve I have ever done, the block have always been on
        the left and right. That's the general idea of the system. I don't have
        a clue why you'd have otherwise. Plus, CMLL is better when you're
        working with inverted blocks. Because you're not relying on the four
        stickers you look at all the time, you can get better at recognising
        cases. I can't really talk for this though, because I use my own freaky
        recognition tricks here. The general 'vibe' from CMLL copulates better
        with inverted blocks. I think I use about 15% solves with inverted
        blocks and another 15% with upside down blocks. The ratio of having
        white or yellow on the L block isn't a factor anymore, since it's about
        50/50. ~Thom

        nah, we're nice people. we all started out slow (well i'm still quite

        http://studwww.ugent.be/~snhendri/sander.htm you don't really solve the
        first 2 layers seperately. you make a pair of a corner together with the
        right edge in the top layer (if your cross is at the bottom). then you
        insert the pair into the right slot, rather then solving the corners
        first then inserting the edge. &gt; Oh yeah and by the way, I'm sure
        alot of you guys &gt; told yourself "3:38 &gt; is slow, but the fact is
        that my rubik cube is realy &gt; cheap, I bought &gt; it for 1$ to see
        if I would like solving it, and I &gt; do, so I'm planning &gt; on

        Hey, What do you guys recommend in terms of memorizing algorithms? I'm a
        somewhat inexperienced cuber (best time=96 seconds, using 9 algs), and
        now I'm trying to memorize more (Thanks Craig -_-) I have recieved
        recommendations in the past to deconstruct my algs, and trying to
        understand why they work, beacuse it helps for memorization and other
        things. My question: should I focus on just memorizing the algs right
        now (which I'm kinda anxious to do), or should I start this (seemingly
        tedious) process of deconstructing the algorithms? Basically i'm only
        asking beacuse I was told that this process will help with memorization.
        So, how much does it help? How much time does it even take (to
        deconstruct etc)? Thanks, David --------------------------------- What

        done entirely with muscle memory and I have no idea what the heck I'm
        doing. I see a case and then my hands solve it. So, whatever works for
        you. I just memorized algs blindly when I first started and it worked
        fine. -Chris StrangePuzzle.com On 1/20/06, David Pritts

        the 3rd step, with the corners. Could someone please help &gt; &gt; me
        figure it out? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks &gt; &gt;
        Congrats on deciding to use this method. I personally feel like it's
        &gt; given far too little attention. Glad to see someone else trying it
        out. :) &gt; &gt; As far as that step, it's trying to accomplish two
        things: correct &gt; corner placement (relative to eachother) and
        correct corner &gt; orientation. As a beginner, you should probably aim
        to do it in two &gt; steps. Pick one sequence that changes two adjacent
        corners ignoring &gt; whatever it does to the orientation. Same goes for
        one sequence to &gt; switch two opposite corners. That's whichever alg
        you like best from &gt; columns 2-5, and whichever you like best from
        column 6. Then, learn &gt; the 7 cases to orient corners when the
        permutation is correct. 9 algs &gt; to always solve corners in two steps
        or less. It can be very, very &gt; fast. Once you have those mastered,
        try to learn the rest of the &gt; cases for the fastest possible step.
        &gt; &gt; If recognition is what you're having trouble with, try
        twisting the &gt; top layer (mentally, if you can), to match up two
        corners with their &gt; correct positions. If the corners are next to
        eachother, and the &gt; other two are also correct, the permutation is
        already done. If they &gt; are next to eachother and the others are
        incorrect, then use your &gt; adjacent swap alg. If they are opposite
        eachother with the other two &gt; incorrect, use your other swap alg.
        Then, orient according to the &gt; pattern that comes up. Hope this
        helps. &gt; &gt; I'll put a page explaining this in detail up on my site
        sometime in &gt; the next few days when I have time. Thanks for the
        idea. &gt; &gt; Keep us updated on your progress. &gt; &gt; -Mike
        Bennett &gt; Thanks this help quite a bit, but one thing I don't
        understand is where in the graph it says something like "(D5)' Sym(F5)"
        does that mean it's the same move as F5 and the inverse of D5?

        There are many fast cubers out there, but my question to the group
        is...Which cuber has been most influential to you overall? Perhaps it is
        someone who got you started, or someone who inspired you in crucial
        points of your "cubing career". Think it over and send me an email
        nominating the most influential cuber to you:
        richy_jr_2000[at]yahoo[dot]com; please title the email "nomination"
        (this is for my own convenience :P ) To avoid bias please refrain from
        nominating anyone publicly on the group for now. I'll take the top
        results and poll the group. Additionally (sorry to be late with this), I
        encourage everyone to elaborate on their choice. How that cuber has
        influenced you. I will organize this bit as well. Thank you very much :)
        I know picking one cuber out of many who have helped a ton is difficult.
        If it eases your mind, feel free to give honorable mention to 2 other
        cubers. I will also take this into consideration when tallying finalists
        for the poll :) I would again appreciate an elaboration on any honorable
        mentions you make. I know this is the third post on this idea in a short
        period, but I am taking this 'project' very seriously. I believe this is
        a great way to recognize the cubers that have helped the community so
        much. :) Happy Cubing, -Richard

        I posted up my OLL algorithms and showed how some of them are similar or

        Hey everyone, I've had this ongoing disput with a friend for a while now
        and its time to settle it. On the 2006 version of the WCA rules it says
        that the Rubik's Magic it can be solved if the puzzle is two tiles
        higher than flat. Does that mean the last step of the transformer does
        not have to be done? Or even the last two steps..? Or does it mean that
        the puzzle itself must be flat not partially bent? -David

        I have just been wondering what would be the best way to my inpsection
        faster. I use the petrus method, I first look for corner edge pairs,
        then for either the 3rd and 4th piece or a edge on the right face. But
        this takes me longer than 15 seconds. Would it better for me to take
        whatever time I needed for inspection? Or should I just the 15 seconds
        and just try to get all the inspection I need? Ben

        For Petrus, try to memorize how you are going to solve the first 2x2x2
        block during inspection. Take as much time as you need, and eventually,
        you will be able to easily plan the block in 15 seconds. -Chris On

        Unfortunately, if one "ear" of the magic is folded down, that's DNS. I
        got one of those at Rutgers. You might say that if, to solve it, the
        puzzle must reach a point two tiles above the table, it's DNS. I'm not a
        huge fan of that rule, I might argue that it should be a 1-2 second
        penalty. Just like on the cube, there's solved, almost solved, and not
        solved. But I haven't solved magic in about a month, so it doesn't
        really affect me much any more. --- In

        &gt; Hi John, I made one in about 5 min, then sized it down. Heres the
        simple program. Note, it asks for input at start. This is the number of
        moves of the scramble. This program also blocks any cases like F B F or
        R L R. Hope you like it. Dont change any of the program, it works
        perfectly as is. (yes, that includes the missing parentheses and
        quotation marks) Note: to access the scramble after the program runs:
        Vars-String-Str1 Here you go: 1-&gt;Y " -&gt;Str1 DelVar ADelVar B Input
        Z Lbl A randInt(1,6-&gt;C If C=A Goto A If C=B Goto A A-&gt;B C-&gt;A If
        C=1 Str1+" F-&gt;Str1 If C=2 Str1+" B-&gt;Str1 If C=3 Str1+" L-&gt;Str1
        If C=4 Str1+" R-&gt;Str1 If C=5 Str1+" D-&gt;Str1 If C=6 Str1+"
        U-&gt;Str1 randInt(1,3-&gt;C If C=2 Str1+"2-&gt;Str1 If C=3
        Str1+"3-&gt;Str1 Y+1-&gt;Y If Y=Z Stop Goto A Feel free to change it as
        much as you want, but credit me. :) Also tell me if you make it any
        shorter. Heres a quick programming description of the program: First,
        reset the counter to 1 (Y). Input your scramble number, then start the
        loop (loop A). Generate a random number C. Heres where I shortened the
        program quite a bit. Instead of looking for cases like FBF it will also
        cancel FLF or FUF. This is done with A and B. A is our immediate past,
        and B is our distant past. If C = A, make a new number (if FF or RR etc
        happens, make a new letter). If C = B make a new number (if FBF or FUF
        or FLF etc happens, make a new letter). After you pass those checks, it
        changes the past into the distant past and the new letter to the past
        (past to distant past: A-&gt;B new to past: C-&gt;A). Now we create a
        rotation. Using the same variable C, make a new number 1-3. Notice that
        1 is never used. That is because 1 rotation can be shown as nothing, so
        no check is needed. :) After it adds rotation, 1 is added to the counter
        which is checked against your input. If they match, the program ends.
        Remember, the scramble is stored in Str1 (Vars-String-Str1). I chose not
        to display the scramble at the end because you wouldn't be able to see
        it. The program would end blocking you from scrolling through the
        scramble. Thats why you must pull it up manually. Well, enjoy my
        program. Hope it brings much school time (or work time) cubing. Peter

        Thanks &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi John, &gt;
        &gt; I made one in about 5 min, then sized it down. Heres the simple
        &gt; program. Note, it asks for input at start. This is the number of
        moves &gt; of the scramble. This program also blocks any cases like F B
        F or R L &gt; R. Hope you like it. Dont change any of the program, it
        works &gt; perfectly as is. (yes, that includes the missing parentheses
        and &gt; quotation marks) &gt; &gt; Note: to access the scramble after
        the program runs: Vars-String-Str1 &gt; Here you go: &gt; &gt; 1-&gt;Y
        &gt; " -&gt;Str1 &gt; DelVar ADelVar B &gt; Input Z &gt; Lbl A &gt;
        randInt(1,6-&gt;C &gt; If C=A &gt; Goto A &gt; If C=B &gt; Goto A &gt;
        A-&gt;B &gt; C-&gt;A &gt; If C=1 &gt; Str1+" F-&gt;Str1 &gt; If C=2 &gt;
        Str1+" B-&gt;Str1 &gt; If C=3 &gt; Str1+" L-&gt;Str1 &gt; If C=4 &gt;
        Str1+" R-&gt;Str1 &gt; If C=5 &gt; Str1+" D-&gt;Str1 &gt; If C=6 &gt;
        Str1+" U-&gt;Str1 &gt; randInt(1,3-&gt;C &gt; If C=2 &gt;
        Str1+"2-&gt;Str1 &gt; If C=3 &gt; Str1+"3-&gt;Str1 &gt; Y+1-&gt;Y &gt;
        If Y=Z &gt; Stop &gt; Goto A &gt; &gt; Feel free to change it as much as
        you want, but credit me. :) Also &gt; tell me if you make it any
        shorter. &gt; &gt; Heres a quick programming description of the program:
        &gt; First, reset the counter to 1 (Y). Input your scramble number, then
        &gt; start the loop (loop A). Generate a random number C. Heres where I
        &gt; shortened the program quite a bit. Instead of looking for cases
        like &gt; FBF it will also cancel FLF or FUF. This is done with A and B.
        A is &gt; our immediate past, and B is our distant past. If C = A, make
        a new &gt; number (if FF or RR etc happens, make a new letter). If C = B
        make a &gt; new number (if FBF or FUF or FLF etc happens, make a new
        letter). &gt; After you pass those checks, it changes the past into the
        distant past &gt; and the new letter to the past (past to distant past:
        A-&gt;B new to &gt; past: C-&gt;A). Now we create a rotation. Using the
        same variable C, make &gt; a new number 1-3. Notice that 1 is never
        used. That is because 1 &gt; rotation can be shown as nothing, so no
        check is needed. :) After it &gt; adds rotation, 1 is added to the
        counter which is checked against your &gt; input. If they match, the
        program ends. Remember, the scramble is &gt; stored in Str1
        (Vars-String-Str1). I chose not to display the scramble &gt; at the end
        because you wouldn't be able to see it. The program would &gt; end
        blocking you from scrolling through the scramble. Thats why you &gt;
        must pull it up manually. &gt; &gt; Well, enjoy my program. Hope it
        brings much school time (or work time) &gt; cubing. &gt; &gt; Peter

        I like that idea of a second or two penalty, but I have another thing to
        say. There needs to be a standard measurement. Not just 2 tiles of the
        table, because tiles are different. Some tiles are thinner, some
        thicker. Lets say I solve, and am off the table a bit. The jusde uses
        thicker tiles to measure, and I get a DNF. If he or she used thinner
        tiles, the time might have counted. My 2 cents. Peter Greenwood --- In

        - For Petrus Solves, I figure out the 2x2 (which I think is easier that

        Hey David, It all depends which part you are doing...if you are learning
        the LL algs, most people just blindly memorise them...it works, and will
        make you fast, but for the people like me who like to know what they do,
        just for the heck of it, we deconstruct, for F2L its a different story
        altogether...I've been going over one alg in my head for a few days,
        just looking at each piece as it goes...F R U R' U' F'...not too sure
        why...just watching it in my head (no cube in my hand) and it is usually
        when watching TV or a movie...I just pull the cube up in my brain and
        concentrate on one piece and execute the algorithm...meh... Craig --- In

        I'm trying to move from CF to Roux. Since the two are similar methods,
        most of this I already know how to do. I don't understand step 4a
        however. Am I correct in assuming that when the cubes are in the "right
        orientation", that after step 4c their orientation should still be
        correct? When I follow the patterns listed in 4a, it seems that a few
        are still in the wrong orientation. "Do it again, as long as wrong
        orientations remain" Does this mean that after using the sequence i have
        to recheck all 6 corners to see what's happened to their orientation? I
        guess my question is this: once I get all of the edges in step 4 into
        the correct "orientation", then after 4b and 4c, the corners should
        still be in the correct orientation? Because when I'm doing it theres
        always 2 in the wrong orientation, and the only way I know to solve that
        is M'UM'UM'U2 MUMUMU2, which adds about 5 more seconds onto the time.
        Maybe someone can reexplain step 4 but dumb it down for me? TY!

        You should look closely at the algorithms. You should try to memorize
        mirror moves. They are great, you can see the symmetry of the cube. Look
        at where you can add variations to the algorithms too. This algorithm
        orients BR edge of the Middle Layer (R' U R') (U2 B')(R2 B) U2 R2 if you
        toss in a R2 before the last two turns you can permute two edges, rather
        than orient just the one. the (R' U R') (U2 B')(R2 B) [[R2]] U2 R2 The
        Back and Front Right Mid Layer edges are switched and the original BRME
        is oriented. Picking apart the algs can be very beneficial. You stop
        looking at the algs as counter and clock turns. I feel it's better to
        see the algs as turning toward or away from the desired solved edge sets
        final position. This makes doing the symetrical algs (mirrors) a lot
        easier. Also discover your own algorithms, add variations to the algs
        like that R2 I added. Discover the cause and effects of your varaiations
        and the mirror moves. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; Maybe someone can reexplain step 4 but dumb it down for me? TY! The
        goal of Step 4a is all edges oriented. The algs to orient are only a few
        turns long, but several require you to repeat or use more than one.
        After a short while of practice, you can generally do them without
        thinking. The longest is when all 6 edges are incorrect. You have to
        perform three algs. Still, with practice, you can see the initial case
        and instantly know which steps to go through. Corners stay oriented when
        you finish Step 3. They don't change at all afterward. I think you meant
        edges. Your problem is probably that you're not orienting the DF and DB
        edges, or perhaps UL and UR. Try this instead: Sometime before you begin
        your step 4 orientation, try to get the U or D center on top. Then,
        orient accordingly. All edges with your U or D color will be easy to
        tell if they are oriented or not. In the end, this is not quite as fast,
        and you aren't able to optimize as well, but this is a much easier
        orientation definition to start with. If an edge has the U or D color
        facing up (or down on the D side) it's oriented. If the U or D color is
        facing the side, it's incorrect. Try that for a while. Good luck! -Mike

        I use CF sometimes, with a ROUX ending. I suggest learning step 4 first.
        Finish corners, fill in 3 ledges and 3 redges. Make sure that the 2

        still in the wrong orientation. &gt; &gt; "Do it again, as long as wrong
        orientations remain" &gt; Does this mean that after using the sequence i
        have to recheck all 6 &gt; corners to see what's happened to their
        orientation? &gt; &gt; I guess my question is this: once I get all of
        the edges in step 4 &gt; into &gt; the correct "orientation", then after
        4b and 4c, the corners should &gt; still &gt; be in the correct
        orientation? Because when I'm doing it theres &gt; always 2 &gt; in the
        wrong orientation, and the only way I know to solve that is &gt;
        M'UM'UM'U2 MUMUMU2, which adds about 5 more seconds onto the time. &gt;
        &gt; Maybe someone can reexplain step 4 but dumb it down for me? TY!

        Roux was under 20 too, before he had to go found his own cult. There may
        well be more. One of my goals for the year is to learn the Roux method.
        It only seems polite. And doing U and slice moves is the fastest thing I
        can do with a cube. I plan to get sub 20 too one day. I was pretty close
        on the plane to Orlando. And I did my best time ever the other day,
        13.98. So there's still hope. &gt;&gt; For Petrus Solves, I figure out
        the 2x2 (which I think is easier that &gt;&gt; the cross). I decide
        which corner I am going to use for the 3x2x2 &gt;&gt; ahead of time. As
        I do the 2x2 (which becomes automatic after time), &gt;&gt; I watch my
        CHOSEN CORNER. Then I quickly throw it in, and have 2 &gt;&gt; quick
        edges to insert, finishing the 3x2x2. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that
        2x2x2-block is much harder than cross, but maybe I'm just &gt; too bad.
        That 'chosen corner' -thing is quite similiar to what I do. The cross
        seems much harder to me, since it's so spread out. But I'm very biased
        in my experience, of course. If you're a beginner, I can see how the
        cross is simpler, since the pieces don't interact much. &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; WHAT IS A GOOD TIME FOR A 3x2x2? I've actually never measured
        this, but I did some quick timing right now, and here are my (stackmat)
        numbers 2x2x3: 7.45 7.36 6.53 6.47 7.51 2x2x3 + OE: 6.55 14.68 7.22 8.71
        9.00 If we ignore the blackout, I seem to do roughly 7 for the 2x2x3 and
        8.5 including edge orientation. I you do 6 and 10, it sounds like you
        could squeeze 1-2 seconds out of your step 3 without too much trouble. I
        usually meld step 2 and 3 together a bit in that I fix one pair of edges
        while finishing up the 2x2x3. Then there's usually only 1 pair left. I
        normally plan out the full 2x2x2 during preinspection, and usually while
        perforning that, I'll spot something more or less good to continue with.
        Just putting the corner in place is not optimal in number of moves, and
        I never do that, but I can see how it simplifies things in a way. My
        plan/dream is to plan out the full 2x2x3 during preinspection. It
        shouldn't be too hard if you work at it. I think practicing by planning
        it all out in your mind and then executing it without looking would be a
        good way. Once you can do it, you just need to get it down to 15
        seconds. And the blindfold experience should make it easier to look at
        THE OTHER pieces while executing it and be ready to continue very
        quickly once it's done. I'll probably never get around to this, but at
        least I have a dream. - - - - - - - - - - - - "He who refuses to do

        That actually makes a lot more sense. So as long as all the facelets
        that are facing up or down are red or orange, then they're "correct"? I
        think the real thing that's buggering me is "an edge is correctly
        oriented if you can solve it with a sequence in the group enerated by
        &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2&gt;... no matter where a side is, if i use one of
        those, i can put it in a "fixed" position. The red/orange thing made
        that a lot easier to understand. so after i get them all in the right
        orientation, if i use the 3 combinations from 4b, they won't mess up the
        orientations. One thing I noticed is that if they are all in the right
        "orientation" and i do something like... M2UMU', they still all stay in
        the right orientation. also, say on the middle row i have all the orange
        and red either on the front or the back, then a simple M or M' puts them
        on top or bottom, right? I think i understand now. Thank you so much!

        Ok, heres the problem i keep having. When i follow the patterns in 4a,
        it doesn't fix the orientation. Right now i have the cube on last 6. I'm
        doing blue and green as my top/bottom. 4 of the 6 cubes have the blue
        facelet either facing up or down. the ones that are not correct are the
        top-back edge and the top-left edge. So i look on the handy chart and it
        says that "M'UM'" will fix it (because that shows the topback and
        topleft edge as purple). So i do those 3 moves. now the topleft,
        topback, topright, and bottomfront sides are messed up. same move is
        supposed to fix it, "M'UM'", so i do it again. topright and bottomfront
        are now messed up. thats not on the chart, but if i do M2U', we're back
        to the first situation where the topback and topleft edges are messed
        up. am i supposed to just keep doing M'UM' over and over until it fixes
        it? None of these patterns seem to accomplish anything... --- In

        Hey everyone, I finished making a video of the WC using video from
        Disney. The movie is 40 minutes long. I haven't exported it yet so I
        don't know how big of a file it will be, but I'm guessing it's going to
        be big. How could I post a 40 minute movie for everybody to download or
        view it? Thanks, Andy http://andyscubepage.tk

        Hey David, you could get two or three times the practice by executing a
        couple LL algs randomly and then try to get back to the solved state.
        That's the way I practice LL algs. For instance, say I want to practice
        permuting four edge pieces that all need to move to the opposite face
        (don't know the number of the algs, sorry), then I could do the move
        once, and the four edges would be mixed. If i did it again, they would
        be solved. Or I could do that move, combined with two more moves, maybe
        a couple of OLL algs, etc. Cheers, Robbie Date: Sat, 21 Jan 2006

        scrambling only one layer? Hey, Thanks to everyone who answered my
        question earlier about LL algorithms/memorization. I will have the 17
        algorithms for the LL memorized WELL by the end of the day. Currently I
        have almost all of them memorized, but most of them will need
        practice.... IE, I can remember them, but it reqires thinking, and is
        not necessarily fast. My question: to get practice using these
        algs/executing them quickly from memory, I obviously just need to use
        them a bunch of times... so, is there a way i could scramble the last
        layer without messing up my F2L (too much?). That way I could save a lot
        of time and focus my practice where it is needed. Just a thought. David

        blue and green as my &gt; top/bottom. 4 of the 6 cubes have the blue
        facelet either facing up &gt; or down. the ones that are not correct are
        the top-back edge and &gt; the top-left edge. So i look on the handy
        chart and it says &gt; that "M'UM'" will fix it (because that shows the
        topback and topleft &gt; edge as purple). So i do those 3 moves. now the
        topleft, topback, &gt; topright, and bottomfront sides are messed up.
        same move is &gt; supposed to fix it, "M'UM'", so i do it again.
        topright and &gt; bottomfront are now messed up. thats not on the chart,
        but if i do &gt; M2U', we're back to the first situation where the
        topback and &gt; topleft edges are messed up. am i supposed to just keep
        doing M'UM' &gt; over and over until it fixes it? None of these patterns
        seem to &gt; accomplish anything... You have two problems. To solve this
        way, first you need to make sure you have either the blue or green
        center on top. If you have the other one, you'll always end up with two
        wrong at the end at least. Second, you may have to adjust the U face
        after performing each M'UM' type alg. When you have the UB and UL
        incorrect, perform M'UM' like you said. Then, to match the new
        orientation to one of the patterns, do U2. This gives you incorrect
        edges at UL+UF+UR. Now try M'UM'. Solved orientation. If you leave your
        U the same between algs and don't match the pictures, there's almost no
        way to get a correct orientation. Try that. Good luck. -Mike

        Hi Andy, wmv probably would make a smaller file size, but the quality
        might be lower. I dont how many settings you can adjust, so I can't
        really be sure. Make a mpg if you want to make DVD, and use wmv with low

        If you just want to take care of the OLL case I highly recommend
        (assuming right-handed) to do this: (R'D'RD)M(D'R'Dr) I used to use this
        alg all the time (as is). Now to be more advanced about it, the popular
        convention/recommendation is to hold the cube with the LL on top. In
        that case it would be: (RUR'U')(rR'U)(RU'r') It's the same as the one I
        discovered myself but I would attribute it to Bob. I first saw it on his
        site. As for the ELL case, I would just use the (M'U)^3 U (Mu)^3 U alg
        that I attribute to Macky, when I leanred it for BLD. I have an
        optimized one for ELL that I use in my CLL/ELL system though that is
        rather complicated but much faster. -Doug --- In

        it from the opposite side, as M' U &gt; &gt; is bound to be faster. I'm
        just too lazy to learn a new alg. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To flip adjacent

        Hello Lars and Everyone I think that making a 3x2x2 in one look is hard.
        7 pieces to track. The cross is 4(CFOP). The White Corners is 4
        (waterman). THE 2x2 is 4 pieces as well. Extended Cross (2x2 plus 2
        edges) is 6 pieces. Not as hard as a 3x2x2, but still pretty hard. My
        approach to Petrus is to do a 2x2 and track a corner. SO 5 pieces. A
        3x2x1 is also 5 pieces. I can do it in 1 look roughly 30-40% of the
        time. Most of the time, I can only form a 2x2x1 and track the other 2
        pieces. Either way, a ROUX block is usually pretty quick; about 9-10
        moves. WHAT Is the Avg move count for a 3x2x2? (same 4 blocks) WHAT is
        the Avg move count for a 3x2x1? (same 4 blocks) I use white/red
        white/orange yellow/red and yellow/orange I've seen calculations for the
        optimal cross solve. MATH people, can you help me? THank you JASON K ---

        the year is to learn the &gt; Roux method. It only seems polite. And
        doing U and slice moves is the &gt; fastest thing I can do with a cube.
        &gt; &gt; I plan to get sub 20 too one day. I was pretty close on the
        plane to &gt; Orlando. And I did my best time ever the other day, 13.98.
        So there's &gt; still hope. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; For Petrus Solves, I
        figure out the 2x2 (which I think is easier that &gt; &gt;&gt; the
        cross). I decide which corner I am going to use for the 3x2x2 &gt;
        &gt;&gt; ahead of time. As I do the 2x2 (which becomes automatic after
        time), &gt; &gt;&gt; I watch my CHOSEN CORNER. Then I quickly throw it
        in, and have 2 &gt; &gt;&gt; quick edges to insert, finishing the 3x2x2.
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that 2x2x2-block is much
        harder than cross, but maybe I'm just &gt; &gt; too bad. That 'chosen
        corner' -thing is quite similiar to what I do. &gt; &gt; The cross seems
        much harder to me, since it's so spread out. But I'm &gt; very biased in
        my experience, of course. If you're a beginner, I can &gt; see how the
        cross is simpler, since the pieces don't interact much. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; WHAT IS A GOOD TIME FOR A 3x2x2? &gt; &gt; I've
        actually never measured this, but I did some quick timing right &gt;
        now, and here are my (stackmat) numbers &gt; &gt; 2x2x3: 7.45 7.36 6.53
        6.47 7.51 &gt; 2x2x3 + OE: 6.55 14.68 7.22 8.71 9.00 &gt; &gt; If we
        ignore the blackout, I seem to do roughly 7 for the 2x2x3 and &gt; 8.5
        including edge orientation. I you do 6 and 10, it sounds like you &gt;
        could squeeze 1-2 seconds out of your step 3 without too much trouble.
        &gt; &gt; I usually meld step 2 and 3 together a bit in that I fix one
        pair of &gt; edges while finishing up the 2x2x3. Then there's usually
        only 1 pair &gt; left. &gt; &gt; I normally plan out the full 2x2x2
        during preinspection, and usually &gt; while perforning that, I'll spot
        something more or less good to &gt; continue with. Just putting the
        corner in place is not optimal in &gt; number of moves, and I never do
        that, but I can see how it simplifies &gt; things in a way. &gt; &gt; My
        plan/dream is to plan out the full 2x2x3 during preinspection. It &gt;
        shouldn't be too hard if you work at it. I think practicing by &gt;
        planning it all out in your mind and then executing it without &gt;
        looking would be a good way. Once you can do it, you just need to get
        &gt; it down to 15 seconds. And the blindfold experience should make it
        &gt; easier to look at THE OTHER pieces while executing it and be ready
        to &gt; continue very quickly once it's done. I'll probably never get
        around &gt; to this, but at least I have a dream. &gt; &gt; &gt; - - - -

        I was actually just starting to figure out the thing about the centers.
        I didn't see them noted and must have missed where that was mentioned. I
        spent about an hour just moving sides around and seeing what changes and
        what doesn't change orientation, and noticed that if all 4 were fixed,
        sometimes after aligning the centers all 4 would be wrong. One question
        though... how much faster is this than doing position first and just
        fixing the (usually only one) orientation problem with M'UM'UM'U2
        MU'MU'MU2? One way or another you need to put the cubes in the right
        location, so that should take the same number of moves, but isn't it
        faster just to do the 12 move switch rather than having to keep chasing
        down sides and doing patterns that aren't always predictable? For me, on
        a random cube with "final six", the way i do it is usually either 20-24
        moves (if one side is oriented wrong), or 10-12 moves if they're already
        fixed. Essentially i'm wondering how the 12 move zero recognition time
        thing stacks up against messing with the orientations. --- In

        have the blue facelet either facing up &gt; &gt; or down. the ones that
        are not correct are the top-back edge and &gt; &gt; the top-left edge.
        So i look on the handy chart and it says &gt; &gt; that "M'UM'" will fix
        it (because that shows the topback and topleft &gt; &gt; edge as
        purple). So i do those 3 moves. now the topleft, topback, &gt; &gt;
        topright, and bottomfront sides are messed up. same move is &gt; &gt;
        supposed to fix it, "M'UM'", so i do it again. topright and &gt; &gt;
        bottomfront are now messed up. thats not on the chart, but if i do &gt;
        &gt; M2U', we're back to the first situation where the topback and &gt;

        to &gt; &gt; accomplish anything... &gt; &gt; You have two problems. To
        solve this way, first you need to make sure &gt; you have either the
        blue or green center on top. If you have the &gt; other one, you'll
        always end up with two wrong at the end at least. &gt; Second, you may
        have to adjust the U face after performing each M'UM' &gt; type alg.
        When you have the UB and UL incorrect, perform M'UM' like &gt; you said.
        Then, to match the new orientation to one of the patterns, &gt; do U2.
        This gives you incorrect edges at UL+UF+UR. Now try M'UM'. &gt; Solved
        orientation. If you leave your U the same between algs and &gt; don't
        match the pictures, there's almost no way to get a correct &gt;
        orientation. Try that. Good luck. &gt; &gt; -Mike &gt;

        average fewer than 14 moves to place and orient all 6 edges, without
        learning any of the special cases. The fact that you can orient the
        edges in around 7 moves helps, because M'U moves are incredibly fast.
        Those orientations are very easy to recognize. Just go through each one
        and memorize which of the 3 move algs needs to happen when. Most of them
        are just M'U M' U adjustment M'U M'. After that, learn to place the UR
        and UL edges simultaneously, giving you a simple 3 edge cycle in a slice
        to finish most of the time. Very fast. -Mike

        Has anyone tried Petrus without OE and then finishing with OLL/PLL? I

        different f2l methods, and I like the move counts the Petrus Method
        provides for the f2l. The total move count for f2l is around 5 moves
        less than fridrich, a potential 1-1.5 second improvement. The only
        holdback is recognition times, but a planned out 2x2x2 can allow for
        being able to see at least a corner/edge pair for the 2x2x3, and a
        follow up with either fridrich style or placing a corner/edge pair and

        think that you should memorize them for the sake of understanding what
        moves do what on your cube. Once you memorize the algorithms, step back
        a bit and just spend time to understand what is happened with each

        I was in the EXACT same boat you were quite recently (around
        November-December). After using it for a couple of months, I have to say
        that learning the F2L algs intuitively is awesome :). Yes, at the
        beginning, it's difficult, and yes, almost always, your times will be
        worse when you're starting. But keep at it, and your times will go down
        very much. The advantages of intuitive F2L are many, those which I can
        elaborate on if you want me too. But to answer your questions:
        http://www.snkenjoi.com/wikicube/mediawiki-1.5.3/index.php?title=Intuitive_F2L
        That website goes over intuitive F2L very well for someone starting to
        learn it. In terms of tips for it, I would most recommend just playing
        around with the cube after the cross is done, and thinking about ways to
        put together corner-edge pairs in different situations. A page of
        algorithms comes in handy when you absolutely cannot figure out how to
        do it. But experiment, and have fun with it! I don't think my response
        was too good, so if you have more questions, feel free to ask me.

        You basically want to have a situation with 3 bad edges on top, and 1 on
        the bottom, either in DF or DB If in DF, M'UM' If in DB, MUM' BUT HERE's
        THE COOL PART; you can change the M' to M or vice versa. In addition,
        you can change which way you do U as well. All that matters is the first
        move(M or M') If in DF, M'UM' or M'UM or M'U'M' or M'U'M If in DB, MUM'
        or MUM or MU'M' or MU'M. Each of these has a different affect on the
        positions of the 6 edges. You can pick which one of the 4 you do to
        control where your ledge and redge end up. I strongly suggest using
        White and YEllow on L and R, because tracking bright pieces is easy,
        even at full turning speed. Once edges are oriented, If you have a ledge
        or redge in DF, put the other ledge/redge in UB and Do M'U2M' You want
        to have ledge and redge paired up on the bottom, with all edges
        oriented. THen simply do a U adjustment, and insert ledge and redge
        simultaneously. THis is what Mike B was talking about. you should be
        averaging under 15 moves with practice Here are a couple posts I put up
        awhile ago

        starting to figure out the thing about the &gt; centers. I didn't see
        them noted and must have missed where that &gt; was mentioned. I spent
        about an hour just moving sides around and &gt; seeing what changes and
        what doesn't change orientation, and noticed &gt; that if all 4 were
        fixed, sometimes after aligning the centers all 4 &gt; would be wrong.
        &gt; &gt; One question though... how much faster is this than doing
        position &gt; first and just fixing the (usually only one) orientation
        problem &gt; with M'UM'UM'U2 MU'MU'MU2? One way or another you need to
        put the &gt; cubes in the right location, so that should take the same
        number of &gt; moves, but isn't it faster just to do the 12 move switch
        rather than &gt; having to keep chasing down sides and doing patterns
        that aren't &gt; always predictable? For me, on a random cube with
        "final six", the &gt; way i do it is usually either 20-24 moves (if one
        side is oriented &gt; wrong), or 10-12 moves if they're already fixed.
        Essentially i'm &gt; wondering how the 12 move zero recognition time
        thing stacks up &gt; against messing with the orientations. &gt; &gt;

        4a, it doesn't fix the orientation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right
        now i have the cube on last 6. I'm doing blue and green &gt; as my &gt;
        &gt; &gt; top/bottom. 4 of the 6 cubes have the blue facelet either &gt;
        facing up &gt; &gt; &gt; or down. the ones that are not correct are the
        top-back edge &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; the top-left edge. So i look on
        the handy chart and it says &gt; &gt; &gt; that "M'UM'" will fix it
        (because that shows the topback and &gt; topleft &gt; &gt; &gt; edge as
        purple). So i do those 3 moves. now the topleft, &gt; topback, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; topright, and bottomfront sides are messed up. same move is &gt;
        &gt; &gt; supposed to fix it, "M'UM'", so i do it again. topright and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; bottomfront are now messed up. thats not on the chart,
        but if i &gt; do &gt; &gt; &gt; M2U', we're back to the first situation
        where the topback and &gt; &gt; &gt; topleft edges are messed up. am i
        supposed to just keep doing &gt; M'UM' &gt; &gt; &gt; over and over
        until it fixes it? None of these patterns seem to &gt; &gt; &gt;
        accomplish anything... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have two problems. To
        solve this way, first you need to make &gt; sure &gt; &gt; you have
        either the blue or green center on top. If you have the &gt; &gt; other
        one, you'll always end up with two wrong at the end at &gt; least. &gt;
        &gt; Second, you may have to adjust the U face after performing each
        &gt; M'UM' &gt; &gt; type alg. When you have the UB and UL incorrect,
        perform M'UM' &gt; like &gt; &gt; you said. Then, to match the new
        orientation to one of the &gt; patterns, &gt; &gt; do U2. This gives you
        incorrect edges at UL+UF+UR. Now try &gt; M'UM'. &gt; &gt; Solved
        orientation. If you leave your U the same between algs and &gt; &gt;
        don't match the pictures, there's almost no way to get a correct &gt;
        &gt; orientation. Try that. Good luck. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike &gt;

        That is the one I used to learn intuitive F2L and I find it wonderful
        and very progressive. http://dougreed.no-ip.org/~doug/f2l/f2l.htm
        Christophe &gt; Hey, &gt; &gt; Yesterday I memorized what I suppose are
        "the basic" 17 LL algs, improving my cubing quite a bit from the method
        I had been using... from what I've heard, the next thing I should do
        (besides of course practicing and getting faster) is learn how to do
        F2L. Currently, I do the first and second layers seperately, and it
        usually takes me around a minute or so to do the F2L (35/25). (That
        number is based off of one trial) &gt; &gt; I refuse to memorize 41
        algorithms. I would be unable to do this anyways. Plus, even if this
        were a good idea, lots of people have told me DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE
        THOSE, IT SHOULD BE INTUITIVE.. so, i'm going to try to follow that
        advice :) &gt; &gt; Any good guides for F2L? Craig recommended the one
        at http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step2.shtml . However,
        the problem with this guide is that the color-scheme on the cube in the
        guide is different from my cube. But, if you guys agree that it is a
        good guide, I could just go through and change the text/pictures,
        switching around BLUE and YELLOW, thus making it match my cube. (Is that
        right?) &gt; &gt; I want to know if that guide is good, before I take
        the time to do that... or maybe you guys know of some other good
        guides... let me know what you think is best. I need to learn intuitive
        F2L!! &gt; &gt; Thanks &gt; &gt; David &gt;

        For a 40 mins video I think half a CD, something around 350 mb, as a

        decide to use can assure great quality. As we would really like detail
        so we can actually see the cubes I think this would be a reasonable file

        Hi all, I just got my Rubik's Domino which I had won on an auction. I
        got I really cheap 2.5$US, but it seems that it is a knockoff puzzle
        (http://www.tradera.com/auction/auction.asp?aid=22855742/). The problem
        is that I can't turn the 1x2x3 blocks, the 1x3x3 block turns nicely
        though. I found Stefan's guide
        (http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/disassemble/rubiks_domino/) for
        disassembling the puzzle but I can't get the center cap of. Can't I just
        pop an edge as for the 3x3x3? //Dennis www.cubeloop.com [Non-text

        Has anybody successfully solved the maze cube on cubesmith.com? I
        searched the whole yahoo group and only found one thread about it. It
        looks very tempting. It reminded me of the discussion a few days back
        about whether the Rubik's cube really counts as a "puzzle" to
        speedcubers, once they've reduced solving it to a method. Putting
        together the maze would (at least momentarily) make it a puzzle again,
        even with my existing arsenal of speedcubing algorithms. Plus I'm
        curious if anybody speed-solves the colorblind cube. I wonder if it
        would take longer (or even shorter??) to solve once my mind switched to
        shape recognition vs. colors. - Matt -- http://procool.blogspot.com

        Here's an article from German magazine "Spiegel" ("Mirror"). I used to
        think they're a serious intelligent magazine, at least they do pretend
        do be. But now this:
        http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,395614,00.html Oh wow, wait...
        they fixed it a bit. My dad printed it a few days ago when it said: "Er
        drehte die Farben in 11,13 Sekunden in die richtige Position - mit
        verbundenen Augen." ("He turned the colors in 11.13 seconds into the
        right position - blindfolded.") So now they removed the "blindfolded".
        But they still say Leyan beat all other competitors (not true, Macky
        won) and that for this he only needed six of eight attempts (pure
        nonsense bullshit). Compared to the earlier version they also deleted
        this sentence: "Den Weltmeister-Titel konnte Lo allerdings nicht
        ergattern, dafuer haette er nur fuenf Versuche brauchen duerfen". "But
        Lo didn't get the world champion title (correct, since it wasn't the
        world championship, you dumbass), for that he would've needed to do it
        with only five attempts (AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!)". Actually I should've
        known better. Two years ago they wrote a short article about the 2003
        world championship. In an article about half as long as this new one
        (sorry, can't find it anymore) they managed to make several serious
        mistakes and insult Jessica Fridrich. I think they first mentioned that
        she had been a competitor 1982 already. And then they said her method is
        now obsolete. And that despite her 2nd place and champion Dan Knights
        using her system. Gosh... Che... no, not really... Stefan

        http://www.twistypuzzles.com/ In the menu, choose "Puzzle Database" -
        "Search" Use keyword search for "domino" Then you can see a few
        different. Spindle and Groove are considerable different and you can see
        how they work. The one with the indented pips looks still different
        (look at the pictures on its own site by clicking on it). The custom
        made "2x3x3" is (usually) a keychain 3x3 hidden inside cubies from a
        normal 3x3. No idea about the Marvel/Lettered/Blindman. And if you don't
        care about weight/size you can turn a 4x4 cube into a domino easily. I
        think yours is probably that standard spindle or groove version. Can you
        try to look between the pieces inside the puzzle? Do you see split
        spindle pieces? If it's a split spindle (i.e. like the one you've seen
        from me) then I'd say popping an edge is not the best idea, but if the
        center cap is really stuck it's probably your best bet. You could try to
        pull down the spindle with e.g. a screwdriver while you pull the edge
        up. You'd need to get the edge piece over that half-circle at the end of
        the spindle arm. Never tried that, though. And it depends on how loose
        your puzzle is I'd say. Cheers! Stefan

        I noticed on the WC2005 website that only 3 people attempted solving the
        5x5x5 cube blindfolded, and none of them finished... this didn't
        surprise me in the least, of course, since the whole concept is absurd.
        I determined that it wasn't possible. Then I saw on Stephan's site that
        he apparently set a world record for solving the 5x5x5 blindfolded, in
        2.5 hours... Although I don't ever plan to try something this absurd
        myself at any point in my life, I would be delighted and fascinated to
        hear exactly HOW you would do something like that... IE, do you (after
        every move), go through all the sides, picturing what colors were placed
        where as a result of your move? Is your memory THAT good? How many
        people have ever done this? Amazing. David

        Several people have done this, have a look at the speedcubing.com record
        list for this. And not just this, also relays (more than one cube) or
        Super 5x5 and Megaminx. Dror was very close in Orlando, he only had a
        blue and a green center swapped. And he's a *lot* faster than me. I
        didn't practice it since my solve at Euro2004, and it took me
        embarassingly long to just analyze/memorize. After about 3 hours or so I
        had to give up cause another event started. But at that point I had
        already made two mistakes or so. Next time I'll be prepared better, I
        swear. Try solving 3x3 blindfolded first, that's really easy. And then
        to step up to the larger puzzles it's just a matter of memorization
        techniques. And a matter of dedication/motivation. It's all a matter of
        dedication/motivation... Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Hey David, doing the 5x5x5 blindfolded is certainly not impossible, and
        in fact a number of people have done it. See
        http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_bf_555.html As far as how
        exactly you do it, you don't update the cube in your head with every
        turn, you solve with longer sequences that move only 3 pieces at a time
        (or flip 2 pieces at a time). These are almost always intuitive
        commutators (permutations in the form X Y X' Y' where X and Y are two
        separate permutations). So for example if I want to cycle just 3 wing
        edges on a 5x5x5, and change absolutely nothing else on the cube (this
        is the key part) then I could do something like this R' d R U R' d' R U'
        If you do this on a 5x5x5 you'll see that it only affects 3 edge pieces,
        and if you look deeper you'll see that absolutely nothing else on the
        whole cube changes. So what you do is memorize how the different types
        of pieces cycle back to their original places. There are only 5 types of
        pieces on a 5x5x5, and they are corners, central edges, wing edges, and
        two types of centers (called +centers and Xcenters). If you memorize the
        cycles of each piece type, as well as the orientations of the corners
        and central edges, you can use moves to either move or flip pieces
        without affecting anything else. For example if I want to flip two
        central edges without changing anything else I can do R' e' R2 e2 R' U R
        e2 R2 e R U' This long move is just a commutator of the form X Y X' Y' X
        = R' e' R2 e2 R' Y = U and you can see how it is made. Check out the
        blindfolded group at
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/ if you
        are interested in learning more about blindfold solving. So in short
        it's definitely not impossible to do a 5x5x5 blindfolded. Not easy, yes,
        but definitely possible. Hope this helps, Chris --- In

        Basically what you're looking at is an optimized algorithm for the F2L.
        It consists of finger tricks. The finger tricks are the moves between

        That is mind boggling... I'm very impressed.. obviously I want to be

        WITHOUT blindfold, however... I'll ask for a prof cube for my birthday
        which is in 3 weeks ^_^ Quick question: on Rubiks.com, it has a big
        WARNING message on the revenge/professor cube saying that due to having
        many more moving parts, these cubes are much more delicate than the
        3x3x3 and are "not suitable for speedcubing". Does this just mean that
        these cubes are more likely to pop a piece, or that they are actually
        prone to true breakage? Second quick question: When would you recommend
        I start learning how to blindfold the 3x3x3? I have only been seriously
        cubing for about a month, and I currently average maybe 1:50 or so (just
        memorized the basic 17 algs for PLL/OLL, so i expect my times will start
        to decrease as these become more second-nature to me). Third quick
        question: are there some people who simply can't learn to blindfold? b/c
        if there are, I would bet (from knowing the way I think/learn/etc) that
        I am one of them :-( Thanks, David cmhardw

        blindfolded is certainly not impossible, and in fact a number of people
        have done it. See http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_bf_555.html As
        far as how exactly you do it, you don't update the cube in your head
        with every turn, you solve with longer sequences that move only 3 pieces
        at a time (or flip 2 pieces at a time). These are almost always
        intuitive commutators (permutations in the form X Y X' Y' where X and Y
        are two separate permutations). So for example if I want to cycle just 3
        wing edges on a 5x5x5, and change absolutely nothing else on the cube
        (this is the key part) then I could do something like this R' d R U R'
        d' R U' If you do this on a 5x5x5 you'll see that it only affects 3 edge
        pieces, and if you look deeper you'll see that absolutely nothing else
        on the whole cube changes. So what you do is memorize how the different
        types of pieces cycle back to their original places. There are only 5
        types of pieces on a 5x5x5, and they are corners, central edges, wing
        edges, and two types of centers (called +centers and Xcenters). If you
        memorize the cycles of each piece type, as well as the orientations of
        the corners and central edges, you can use moves to either move or flip
        pieces without affecting anything else. For example if I want to flip
        two central edges without changing anything else I can do R' e' R2 e2 R'
        U R e2 R2 e R U' This long move is just a commutator of the form X Y X'
        Y' X = R' e' R2 e2 R' Y = U and you can see how it is made. Check out
        the blindfolded group at
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/ if you
        are interested in learning more about blindfold solving. So in short
        it's definitely not impossible to do a 5x5x5 blindfolded. Not easy, yes,
        but definitely possible. Hope this helps, Chris --- In

        on David Letterman in the past week or so. Since he mentioned it ahead

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey David, Answers to your questions below: &gt; Quick question: on
        Rubiks.com, it has a big WARNING message on the &gt;revenge/professor
        cube saying that due to having many more moving &gt;parts, these cubes
        are much more delicate than the 3x3x3 and are "not &gt;suitable for
        speedcubing". Does this just mean that these cubes are &gt;more likely
        to pop a piece, or that they are actually prone to true &gt;breakage?
        That's just their warning so that if you do break it you can't sue or
        anything. Basically, don't be surprised if you do twist an Xcenter (the
        centers that are closest to the corners) and it breaks.
        www.cubesmith.com sells replacement pieces, and I belive rubiks.com
        might as well. The rubiks.com 5x5's are the ones that a lot of people
        use for speedcubing though, so no worries. &gt; Second quick question:
        When would you recommend I start learning &gt;how to blindfold the
        3x3x3? I have only been seriously cubing for &gt;about a month, and I
        currently average maybe 1:50 or so (just &gt;memorized the basic 17 algs
        for PLL/OLL, so i expect my times will &gt;start to decrease as these
        become more second-nature to me). You can learn how to blindfold solve
        anytime you want really. Again check out the blindsolving group, but
        there are tutorials written on how to blindfold solve (check out Macky's
        and Tyson's tutorials. I think Leyan may also have one, but not sure).
        It won't harm your speedcubing at all, and is just a different way to
        solve. I would personally recommend starting with either the corners
        only of a 3x3x3 cube or a 2x2x2 cube blindfolded. Like anything
        blindfold solving works by learning the basics and working up. Though
        you could learn to solve the 5x5 first, it would be a lot harder in my
        opinion. I think your time would be better spent learning the 2x2, then
        the 3x3, then the 4x4, then the 5x5. Though you should know that there
        are people who have done the 3x3 then gone straight to the 5x5, so it
        really is up to you. &gt; Third quick question: are there some people
        who simply can't learn &gt;to blindfold? b/c if there are, I would bet
        (from knowing the way I &gt;think/learn/etc) that I am one of them :-(
        Absolutely not. I am totally convinced that anyone could learn to do
        this. It takes only the desire to do it, and dedication to practice and
        train your memory. Now I do believe that some people are gifted with a
        stronger memory than most, but anyone can train their memory to do
        things that might now seem impossible to you right now. Your memory, and
        anyone's for that matter, is definitely trainable, and with practice you
        definitely could do the cube blindfolded (yes even the 5x5), no doubt at
        all. One thing that working on blindfold solving taught me is that your
        memory is actually much *better* than you think it is. You'll find that
        you'll actually have a problem with trying to *forget* information from
        a previous solve, even though a lot of time has passed since then. In
        short I think blindfoldsolving is for everyone, and is achievable by
        everyone. Anyone who thinks they can't blindfold solve, I am convinced I
        could teach you how to do it (and any BLD solver really could teach you
        how to do it), but I would offer to help if I can. Just look for me on
        yahoo messenger (cmhardw). All it takes is just for you to want to do
        it. Chris

        That is mind boggling... I'm very impressed.. obviously I want to be
        much more impressed with Chris's solving it in 40 minutes, but part of
        me is just as amazed that Stefan can go for 2.5 hours without making one
        mistake or becoming suicidal.. -.- I don't think my memory would allow
        me to do that.. I am extremely interested in learning how to solve one
        WITHOUT blindfold, however... I'll ask for a prof cube for my birthday
        which is in 3 weeks ^_^ Quick question: on Rubiks.com, it has a big
        WARNING message on the revenge/professor cube saying that due to having
        many more moving parts, these cubes are much more delicate than the

        these cubes are more likely to pop a piece, or that they are actually
        prone to true breakage? Second quick question: When would you recommend
        I start learning how to blindfold the 3x3x3? I have only been seriously
        cubing for about a month, and I currently average maybe 1:50 or so (just

        blindfolded is certainly not impossible, and in fact a number of people
        have done it. See http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_bf_555.html As
        far as how exactly you do it, you don't update the cube in your head
        with every turn, you solve with longer sequences that move only 3 pieces
        at a time (or flip 2 pieces at a time). These are almost always
        intuitive commutators (permutations in the form X Y X' Y' where X and Y
        are two separate permutations). So for example if I want to cycle just 3
        wing edges on a 5x5x5, and change absolutely nothing else on the cube
        (this is the key part) then I could do something like this R' d R U R'
        d' R U' If you do this on a 5x5x5 you'll see that it only affects 3 edge
        pieces, and if you look deeper you'll see that absolutely nothing else
        on the whole cube changes. So what you do is memorize how the different
        types of pieces cycle back to their original places. There are only 5
        types of pieces on a 5x5x5, and they are corners, central edges, wing
        edges, and two types of centers (called +centers and Xcenters). If you
        memorize the cycles of each piece type, as well as the orientations of
        the corners and central edges, you can use moves to either move or flip
        pieces without affecting anything else. For example if I want to flip
        two central edges without changing anything else I can do R' e' R2 e2 R'
        U R e2 R2 e R U' This long move is just a commutator of the form X Y X'
        Y' X = R' e' R2 e2 R' Y = U and you can see how it is made. Check out
        the blindfolded group at
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/ if you
        are interested in learning more about blindfold solving. So in short
        it's definitely not impossible to do a 5x5x5 blindfolded. Not easy, yes,
        but definitely possible. Hope this helps, Chris --- In

        David, Hey, this is Marcus. I think anyone can solve the cube
        blindfolded with enough practice and dedication -- and you don't
        necessarily need to know how to speedsolve one in order to do it, as an
        entirely different set of algorithms are used. I think in order to
        blindfold solve well you need a good visual mind and memory. And yeah
        the 4x4x4 cubes tend to break a lot. My friend's 4x4x4's center pieces
        snapped into pieces once. To begin, definitely try to first blindfold
        solve a 3x3x3. There are plenty of algs to get you started -- you don't
        need OLL or PLL or anything like that, however. Even for a beginner I
        would say, if you really tried hard, you could blindfold solve your
        first cube in under an hour, given the extra time dedicated to
        memorizing cube positions and ensuring your algorithms are correctly
        implemented, etc. I wouldn't even think about the 5x5x5 until you master
        the 3x3x3 but that is just my advice. Happy cubing!

        Ok... this is my third try. Yahoo doesn't like me. Hi Dennis, I bought 3
        of those from Tradera too last year. Great price for an unusual item
        (about $2 for you foreigners :) . Mine were also stiff as hell to begin
        with but I turned mine like in your first picture and managed to get the
        edge out. The center cap is glued on so you need a thin sharp knife to
        cut it open in the seam. You will want to get it off eventually anyhow
        cause' beneath it is a screw and a spring and adjusting the spring will
        do miracles for the puzzle. I completely dissassembled mine, cleaned,
        and lubed it and adjusted the tension... like a whole new puzzle. Still
        not great, but compared to before it's awesome. An additional adjustment
        you might want to make is to sand the end of the springs flat. They
        stick out pretty much and gets caught in the surrounding plastic. And
        for those who are interested, it's a groove mechanism. /Gustav Dennis

        never tried anything besides 3x3x3 (so far) but i'm quite convinced too

        I've finally seen the first two episodes of BATG and they are well worth
        watching. I was watching the show with some friends who all thought
        Tyson was definitely less geeky than many of the other guys. I'm glad to
        see that Tyson's cube has made numerous appearances already. I'm still
        hoping to see one of the girls playing with it though. It would be
        awesome if they learnt the cube, but I'm guessing that's not going to
        happen (maybe just one layer?? surely they could manage this much??)
        BTW, on an unrelated note, unrelated except for the fact that it also
        involves the USA, I'm in Hawaii at the moment! I'll tell you all why

        Hey guys, After a while of not cubing a lot, I started taking some
        averages today... I was happy that I could still average sub16 without
        problems... Because I didn't cube much for a while, I am pretty
        inconsistent, but I can still get some nice 13's :). The thing is, I
        started having some nice times: 12,11 15,42 13,45 13,76 11,70 (lucky,
        but still nice)... And after this I started to get very nervous, getting
        bad times. And this is not the first time something like this happens.

        Alright, now more seriously: Have you tried speedsolving your Domino? I
        got interested in this recently and took the unofficial records for it
        easily, though that's mainly cause I'm pretty much the only one doing it
        :-(. I have a "normal" scrambler already (http://tinyurl. com/9vxr8) and
        I'm writing a better one at the moment (I'll generate random *states*
        and let CubeExplorer solve/generate them). Cheers! Stefan --- In

        I didn't cube much for a while, I am pretty &gt; inconsistent, but I can
        still get some nice 13's :). &gt; &gt; The thing is, I started having
        some nice times: 12,11 15,42 13,45 &gt; 13,76 11,70 (lucky, but still
        nice)... And after this I started to get &gt; very nervous, getting bad
        times. And this is not the first time &gt; something like this happens.

        Hi all, I found a physics paper dealing with conservation laws in
        particle physics. The special thing is that they use the cube to
        illustrate the conservation laws. Quite funny I thought. You can find

        Hi, you can find finger tricks videos in our yahoo FILES section. Click
        on FILES on the left side and go to the folder DAN K'S FINGERTRICKS.
        METHOD: I'd like to recommend Jessica Fridrich's method. Personally, I
        learned Jessica Fridrich's method from here:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01.shtml WHAT YOU HAVE TO
        UNDERSTAND (I taught someone how to solve the first two layers in about
        2 weeks): I assume that you can form the cross. Then I can give the
        following tips: 1) First thing after the cross: Learn how to bring a
        corner-edge pair to the upper layer. On the twistypuzzles website above,
        we look for blue corners and their corresponding edge. Blue is our
        "target"-colour here. (Note: Most websites refer to white as their
        "target" colour, here it is blue. Just think of "white" when I write
        "blue" in the following text if you like. I personally also use white as
        "target" colour.) What is a corner edge pair? Let's have a look here:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step3.shtml Consider the
        first cube image. Remember, our target colour is blue. We see the
        blue-green-orange corner cubie on the top layer right in front of us.
        The corresponding edge is green-orange. Why green orange? =&gt; We said
        blue-green-orange, right? Now take away the target colour blue and you
        get green-orange. 2) Secondly: Analyze how to PAIR UP a corner-edge
        pair, that is how to bring a corner and it's corresponding edge together
        on the upper layer. In the following cases the corners with a blue
        sticker (blue is our target colour) are in the top layer. Basically what
        you have to recognize is that there are only TWO cases: Case a) Blue
        sticker on TOP of corner cubie, see here:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step3.shtml
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step6.shtml Analyze and
        understand how to bring the corner and it's corresponding edge together.
        Case b) Blue sticker NOT ON TOP of corner cubie, see here:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step4.shtml
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step5.shtml Analyze and
        understand how to bring the corner and it's corresponding edge together.
        This step, namely to understand the pairing up is very important! Then,
        once you've understood step 2, go on: 3) Of course, you have to learn
        how to put in a "corner-edge pair" in it's correct slot. This is shown
        on the second half of the website:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step3.shtml Then follows the
        TOP LAYER: 4) Form the cross on the top (=last) layer:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step7.shtml 5) Then swap
        (=permute) the corners:

        is also called "permute edges" on other websites). FINISHED :) 8) Some
        additional tips: Definitely buy silicon spray and apply it to the inner
        of your cube, but it should be 100% silicon, otherwise the plastic of
        your cube could be destroyed. 9) Learn fingertricks, especially for the
        last layer. That REALLY makes it easier to memorize algorithms. What's
        really fun about Jessica Fridrich's method is that you improve quite
        fast. Good luck! - Edgardo --- In

        Ok, Stefan and Gustav. It was the grooved version of the Domino. I
        figured that out when trying to pop one of the edges, since I was afraid
        to destroy the center cap since it was so hard glued on. However, I
        didn't succeed to disassemble my Domino even when using my largest
        screwdriver to really force a popping edge. But the outcome was that the
        puzzle now works when it had been "stretched" a bit. I squirted some
        silicon spray into the puzzle and it turned into "decent" puzzle. Now
        it's solved but I think I will try Domino speedsolving later on. Btw,
        nice scrambles for the Domino. // Dennis www.cubeloop.com

        anywhere from 2 seconds to 15 seconds of preinspection.. about 2-3
        seconds average to do the cross.. know your cube. look for shorter ways.
        check out macky's site. you should be able to do it without looking.

        ok, i spent a few hours with that last part and have it pretty much
        down. heres the only problem i'm having... if i rush up to the very end
        and have only 1 on the L face and one on the R to solve (red and orange
        for me), then if the 2 faces are complementary (say red/blue and
        orange/green or something), then i can finish very quickly. If its
        something like red/blue and orange/white, or red/yellow and
        orange/green, then i get confused because i view the yellow/white sides
        as "wrong". So the extra time spent to either make sure the red/orange
        edges that are missing are either green or blue, OR to fix it when i get
        to that point, seems to take much longer than simply stuffing them all
        in the right place and finishing with M'UM'UM'U2MUMUMU2 --- In

        how much faster is this than doing position &gt; &gt; first and just

        M'UM'UM'U2 MU'MU'MU2? One way or another you need to put the &gt; &gt;
        cubes in the right location, so that should take the same number of &gt;
        &gt; moves, but isn't it faster just to do the 12 move switch rather
        than &gt; &gt; having to keep chasing down sides and doing patterns that
        aren't &gt; &gt; always predictable? For me, on a random cube with
        "final six", the &gt; &gt; way i do it is usually either 20-24 moves (if
        one side is oriented &gt; &gt; wrong), or 10-12 moves if they're already
        fixed. Essentially i'm &gt; &gt; wondering how the 12 move zero
        recognition time thing stacks up &gt; &gt; against messing with the
        orientations. &gt; &gt; Not at all. Following Gilles' Step 4, you can
        generally average fewer &gt; than 14 moves to place and orient all 6
        edges, without learning any of &gt; the special cases. The fact that you
        can orient the edges in around 7 &gt; moves helps, because M'U moves are
        incredibly fast. Those &gt; orientations are very easy to recognize.
        Just go through each one and &gt; memorize which of the 3 move algs
        needs to happen when. Most of them &gt; are just M'U M' U adjustment M'U
        M'. After that, learn to place the &gt; UR and UL edges simultaneously,
        giving you a simple 3 edge cycle in a &gt; slice to finish most of the
        time. Very fast. &gt; &gt; -Mike &gt;

        Awesome link! Thanks! Developing a method for the cross is one of those
        things I just kept putting off. I had no idea how to even take advantage
        of pre-inspection time. My current method has been to just get
        everything into the D layer as fast as possible and then use R2 and UE
        or U'E' to swap D edges. This will easily shave 5 - 10 seconds off my
        time. On 1/25/06, Evan Gates &lt;evan.gates@...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; Dan

        Your webpage (blindsolving instructions) says that people should let you
        know what they think about your page. So, I'm going to say that not only
        did I think it was hilarious/enjoyable/educational, it made me want to
        learn to blindsolve. Although I have a horrible short-term memory (been
        diagnosed by professionals as having this problem, lol), I am going to
        definetely give it a shot. Chris H.'s emails earlier this week also
        helped with this, when he told me that he is confident that ANYONE can
        learn, with dedication. (Thanks to Chris, and to the other people who
        were responding to my questions earlier this week about the 5x5x5
        blindsolve) Anyways, great site. I will start working on that sometime
        in the next few months? (weeks? hours?) Btw, do you think it'd be good
        to start with a 2x2x2 ? Thanks, and good job David ps--one other random
        question, since i don't want to send another message just for this: what
        is your opinion on getting a 5x5x5 before getting a 4x4x4? i've only
        asked one person so far, and he said it's fine, but that other people
        would disagree with him.. thanks. --------------------------------- Do

        PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ MY OLD POSTS ABOUT STEP 4(LINK BELOW) I
        ALMOST PREFER HAVING 4 BAD EDGES TO HAVING 0 BAD EDGES. M'UM'UM'U2
        MUMUMU2 is 12 moves. That's just to flip 2 edges. I can do all of step 4
        in about 13 moves on Avg. Jason K --- In

        DF or DB &gt; &gt; If in DF, M'UM' &gt; If in DB, MUM' &gt; &gt; BUT
        HERE's THE COOL PART; you can change the M' to M or vice versa. &gt; In
        addition, you can change which way you do U as well. All that &gt;
        matters is the first move(M or M') &gt; &gt; If in DF, M'UM' or M'UM or
        M'U'M' or M'U'M &gt; If in DB, MUM' or MUM or MU'M' or MU'M. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Each of these has a different affect on the positions of the 6
        edges. &gt; You can pick which one of the 4 you do to control where your
        ledge and &gt; redge end up. I strongly suggest using White and YEllow
        on L and R, &gt; because tracking bright pieces is easy, even at full
        turning speed. &gt; &gt; Once edges are oriented, If you have a ledge or
        redge in DF, put the &gt; other ledge/redge in UB and Do M'U2M' &gt;
        &gt; You want to have ledge and redge paired up on the bottom, with all
        &gt; edges oriented. THen simply do a U adjustment, and insert ledge and
        &gt; redge simultaneously. THis is what Mike B was talking about. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; you should be averaging under 15 moves with practice &gt; Here

        starting to figure out the thing about the &gt; &gt; centers. I didn't
        see them noted and must have missed where that &gt; &gt; was mentioned.
        I spent about an hour just moving sides around and &gt; &gt; seeing what
        changes and what doesn't change orientation, and noticed &gt; &gt; that
        if all 4 were fixed, sometimes after aligning the centers all 4 &gt;
        &gt; would be wrong. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One question though... how much
        faster is this than doing position &gt; &gt; first and just fixing the
        (usually only one) orientation problem &gt; &gt; with M'UM'UM'U2
        MU'MU'MU2? One way or another you need to put the &gt; &gt; cubes in the
        right location, so that should take the same number of &gt; &gt; moves,
        but isn't it faster just to do the 12 move switch rather than &gt; &gt;
        having to keep chasing down sides and doing patterns that aren't &gt;
        &gt; always predictable? For me, on a random cube with "final six", the
        &gt; &gt; way i do it is usually either 20-24 moves (if one side is
        oriented &gt; &gt; wrong), or 10-12 moves if they're already fixed.
        Essentially i'm &gt; &gt; wondering how the 12 move zero recognition
        time thing stacks up &gt; &gt; against messing with the orientations.

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, heres the problem i keep having. When i
        follow the patterns &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4a, it doesn't fix
        the orientation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right now i
        have the cube on last 6. I'm doing blue and green &gt; &gt; as my &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; top/bottom. 4 of the 6 cubes have the blue facelet either
        &gt; &gt; facing up &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or down. the ones that are not
        correct are the top-back edge &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        top-left edge. So i look on the handy chart and it says &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; that "M'UM'" will fix it (because that shows the topback and &gt;
        &gt; topleft &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edge as purple). So i do those 3 moves.
        now the topleft, &gt; &gt; topback, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; topright, and
        bottomfront sides are messed up. same move is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        supposed to fix it, "M'UM'", so i do it again. topright and &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; bottomfront are now messed up. thats not on the chart, but if
        i &gt; &gt; do &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; M2U', we're back to the first
        situation where the topback and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; topleft edges are
        messed up. am i supposed to just keep doing &gt; &gt; M'UM' &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; over and over until it fixes it? None of these patterns seem
        to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accomplish anything... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; You have two problems. To solve this way, first you need to make
        &gt; &gt; sure &gt; &gt; &gt; you have either the blue or green center
        on top. If you have the &gt; &gt; &gt; other one, you'll always end up
        with two wrong at the end at &gt; &gt; least. &gt; &gt; &gt; Second, you
        may have to adjust the U face after performing each &gt; &gt; M'UM' &gt;
        &gt; &gt; type alg. When you have the UB and UL incorrect, perform M'UM'
        &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; you said. Then, to match the new
        orientation to one of the &gt; &gt; patterns, &gt; &gt; &gt; do U2. This
        gives you incorrect edges at UL+UF+UR. Now try &gt; &gt; M'UM'. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Solved orientation. If you leave your U the same between algs
        and &gt; &gt; &gt; don't match the pictures, there's almost no way to
        get a correct &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation. Try that. Good luck. &gt; &gt;

        and 53 seconds and 736.4mb. It's a QuickTime Movie (.mov). How should I
        get it on the internet so all of you can download it? The quality isn't
        the best, but when I tried exporting it at the best quality, it was

        I'm planning on starting to work on solving the 4x4, but I need some
        advice. Do most people use the eastsheen cube or the rubiks.com cube, or
        another one that I haven't mentioned? While I'm here, I'll go ahead and
        ask the same question for the 5x5. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

        Hi David, thanks about your kind words about my blindsolving page. Makes
        me feel bad that I still haven't written the final version, though :-) I
        myself started with a 2x2, but that was before I knew how easy
        blindsolving is. I can recommend starting with 3x3 right away. You can
        first start with edges and corners separately if you want a smaller
        challenge. I'll post some new scramblers later today anyway that can be
        useful for this... "Getting" a 5x5 before a 4x4? Do you mean buying or
        solving or blindsolving? Well, all doesn't matter. For blindsolving, I
        went from 3x3 to Megaminx to 5x5 and still have never attempted a 4x4.
        Cheers! Stefan

        i did my first blindsolve attempts after reading stefan's page. and yeah
        it is quite funny sometimes :-p i'd say just start with the 3x3x3 right
        away and don't bother about the smaller cube. just make sure you have a
        good method to memorize. if you are going to use the method stefan
        explains with the items along a "mental" route, take your time to come
        up with good items that YOU can remember easily! take your time the
        first couple times you try. just memorize for an hour if needed. and
        don't give up if you fail a couple of times. many people fail their
        first attempt to blindsolve a cube (well at least i did) and you should
        feel happy if you come quite close, like 2 edges with wrong orientation
        or 2 pieces swapped, because then you know you can do it :-) !! and you
        will after some more attempts. and i'd get a 4x4x4 before getting a
        5x5x5 for the simple reason that the 5x5x5 cube is a cube with odd
        dimension, just like the 3x3x3. the 4x4x4 is a cube with even dimension
        and has a couple "extra's" because of that (being the parity errors and
        not having fixed centers) greetz, sander --- David Pritts

        Awesome. I was referring to buying a 5x5x5 or 4x4x4... so far I have one
        person recommending I get the 4x4x4 first (sander) and one person saying
        it doesn't matter. I think I might be leaning towards getting teh
        revenge first, simply beacuse that way, I can impress people with the
        4x4x4, and then impress them again later when i get the professor cube

        "Getting" a 5x5 before a 4x4? Do you mean buying or solving or

        3x3 to Megaminx to 5x5 and still have never attempted a 4x4. Cheers!

        instructions) says that people should let you know what they think about
        your page. So, I'm going to say that not only did I think it was
        hilarious/enjoyable/educational, it made me want to learn to blindsolve.
        &gt; &gt; Although I have a horrible short-term memory (been diagnosed
        by professionals as having this problem, lol), I am going to definetely
        give it a shot. Chris H.'s emails earlier this week also helped with
        this, when he told me that he is confident that ANYONE can learn, with
        dedication. (Thanks to Chris, and to the other people who were
        responding to my questions earlier this week about the 5x5x5 blindsolve)
        &gt; &gt; Anyways, great site. I will start working on that sometime in
        the next few months? (weeks? hours?) Btw, do you think it'd be good to
        start with a 2x2x2 ? &gt; &gt; Thanks, and good job &gt; &gt; David &gt;
        &gt; ps--one other random question, since i don't want to send another
        message just for this: what is your opinion on getting a 5x5x5 before
        getting a 4x4x4? i've only asked one person so far, and he said it's
        fine, but that other people would disagree with him.. thanks. &gt; &gt;
        Out of curiosity, is this a question with respect to blindfolding on a
        4x4x4 or 5x5x5 or just getting a 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 (or maybe both!)? That's
        not so crazy as it sounds - I bought my 4x4x4 specifically so as to have
        one to try out my blindfold method. : ) The 4x4x4 is a lot easier to
        blindfold solve than the 5x5x5. There's a lot less to remember for a
        start. Also, if you solve a 5x5x5 blindfolded then you've essentially
        also done a 4x4x4 blindfolded (because stripping out the middle slices
        leaves a 4x4x4). Arguably it's more difficult to do a 4x4x4 by the
        method of solving a 5x5x5 (as you have to remember all that extra stuff
        for the 5x5x5). Solving the 4x4x4 blindfolded takes a little practice
        but it is not too bad (unless you're racing when you have 2 problems a)
        you can here the other person clicking away which does nothing for the
        concentration and b) you risk spending less time than you should on the
        memorization which is nearly always a bad idea). It can be done
        consistently. The 5x5x5 is a harder proposition. For one thing it is a
        bigger investment in time. I remember the early days of blindfolding the
        larger cubes. In those days, only the 3x3x3 had been solved blindfolded
        and although people would do more than one cube, it didn't seem that
        anyone cared to try the larger cubes. The frustration you get from
        spending all that time on the 5x5x5 memorizing/solving only to find out
        that you've got two pieces switched is quite bad. (It's even worse if
        you're doing more than one cube - mainly because of the extra time.) On
        the other hand, if you do solve a 4x4x4 or a 5x5x5 blindfolded then
        you'll be one of very few to achieve it, especially the 5x5x5. It's a
        pretty cool thing to be able to do. Essentially, all that is required
        for blindfold cubing is a good memory and good concentration. If you
        possess both of these then you can learn to solve the cube blindfolded.
        If you can't concentrate then you may be able to learn it in theory but
        perhaps not execute it in practice. If you can't memorize, it's probably
        not going to work. To give you a rough idea of the memory required for
        smaller cubes: to solve the 2x2x2 blindfolded is little more than being
        able to remember a telephone number or two (plus a small number of
        algorithms - 2 would suffice). If you can do that then you probably have
        the memory capabilities. To solve the 3x3x3 blindfolded, you probably
        need the equivalent of also being able to remember a couple of credit
        card numbers (plus a small number of algorithms - while less is
        possible, 5 or 6 is a good number to start with, especially if you're
        not concerned with speed). &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------

        Good point David... if you get the 5x5x5 now, your non-cubing friends
        will think you're downgrading when you get the 4x4x4. I think the 4x4x4
        is a more interesting challenge because of the lack of fixed centers. To
        be honest, once you've figured out the 4x4x4, there's almost nothing
        left to figure out about the 5x5x5. But I guess that's probably the case
        with all larger cubes. It seems like a valid assumption that since the
        number of possible states of a cube rises exponentially with size, the
        complexity of getting to the correct state also rises, but that's
        completely untrue. So with bigger cubes, it's really all about
        impressing people that don't know the difference. :-D On 1/26/06, David

        Tomy one has 10 colors (only orange and yellow repeat on opposite
        faces). I do have a Supernova (same puzzle but cut a little deeper on
        each face) with 12 colors. As for algorithms, you can use concepts from
        the 3x3 cube, but not all algorithms will translate exactly. For
        example, the following corner 3-cycle translates nicely: (R' U L U') (R
        U L' U') But something like this edge flipper breaks down: (M U)4 (M
        U')4 Since there really is no "M" slice, and also because the Megaminx U
        face does not have an order of 4. In any case, the Megaminx is a
        must-have. I prefer any 12-color version. Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, Well it's been over 7 years and I have never gotten around
        to learning ELL until today. I've decided that knowing ELL is worthwhile
        for a couple of the goals I have, and I want to broaden my algs
        knowledge as much as I can as well. Does anyone have any advice of where
        to look for good fast ELL algs for a complete noob? I have no idea what
        I'm doing when it comes to this alg set. So far I am looking at the ones

        Thanks, &gt; &gt; Chris The Speedcubing list is just fine. Those algs
        are great. But, I would use Cube Explorer to check those and see if
        there aren't better algs from other rotations you would prefer. Also,
        there are a few algs you won't be able to find anywhere, just from
        optimizing algs from ACube. The two of those that I use are: (r U R' U')
        M U (R U' R') and its inverse. I think those are both rotations of 90
        degrees from where Speedcubing shows to perform them, but they work so
        much better. Also, don't hesitate to go through and understand each alg,
        because if you can see what they're doing, you can come up with your
        own. That's how I found my Z perm, which is 9 moves (10 with a U
        adjustment at the end 3/4 of the time). Good luck, and let us know how
        it turns out. -Mike [Non-text portions of this message have been

        &gt; &gt; Yours confusingly, &gt; &gt; ~Thom Ok. If you know the 32
        VHF2L algs, the basic principle is simple, but I'm not certain if it
        would be helpful for standard Roux. In fact, I'm pretty sure it would
        only make things more difficult. If you intend to finish with L5E, it's
        the way to go. For 1/4 of cases, there are two edges in D incorrect. For
        these, we need to generate special algs. I'm working on that, but it's
        slow going. Mostly, because I'm busy with something else. But it will
        get done, and hopefully soon. Doug Li may help. For 1/4 of cases, you
        have no edges in D incorrect, so a VHF2L alg is enough to get you all
        correct edges at the cost of a few extra moves. For 1/2 of cases, you
        can use a VHF2L alg to achieve the 3 edges on top situation. You aren't
        able to change the D edges, but you can influence the U edges to end
        with 3 incorrect. It's a bit tricky to see at first, but if you play
        around with it, it gets much easier. You can never wind up with 4 edges
        incorrect on top this way, so if you have 3 up there already, you know
        to do a normal alg. If you don't have 3 already, you just view the edge
        that's correct as bad. Cake, really. Now if only someone could better
        explain to me non-matching blocks. I feel pretty dumb because it's
        giving me so much trouble. ;) -Mike [Non-text portions of this message

        I am starting to get the hang of intuitive F2L! (it sorta just started
        to click after i struggled through it, looking at the four "algorithms"
        repeatedly). Now I can solve 3 corners with this method without too much
        trouble, although it's still not fast. My old method is still MUCH
        faster than this. Question: Generally I have some difficulty inserting
        the last pair into the F2L. Tips? How do I form one of the "fundamental
        F2L cases" when I am so limited in my ability to move the pieces around?
        I have been able to do it before, but the last one frequently takes a
        long time... I am realy unable to plan it out (although I am starting to
        get better at actually planning out the first 3, rather than just moving
        rnadomly aroudn until I recognize a pattern), and I sort of just play
        with it for a while. Will I just get better at this? How long will I
        have to use F2L until I get "relatively fast" at it (ie, less than 45

        All -- I wanted to get a megaminx, and thought "oh, I'll just use
        mefferts" When I was working on checking out, all of a sudden I was in a
        site where I had to set up an account, and give them credit card and
        social security and phone number and date of birth. That seemed a little
        odd, so I bugged out. (Why can't I just enter credit card and shipping
        address and be done? or use paypal?) Alas, that means I still don't have
        a Megaminx. Was the strangeness of that purchase process standard
        procedure for Mefferts? Any other places to get a Megaminx? thanks, yeff

        That's odd...I ordered a megaminx almost 2 weeks ago and it was a snap,
        I just entered in the credit card and one set of billing/shipping info
        and it was sent the next business day. I guess try again. I still
        haven't recieved mine so depending on where you live you may want to use

        That doesn't sound odd. It was quite a while ago when I last ordered
        from Mefferts so I can't remember all the details, but I think I only
        had to supply the obvious details like my address and credit card. I
        can't think of any valid reason why you'd need a social security number

        Hello, When you start with F2L intuitively, it's completely normal to be
        quite slow at the beginning. When I did that too, I did the same as you
        : playing with the pieces so that I luckily find a basic case. But then
        with time you'll find ways to improve your solution for any case. Just
        give it time and you'll be fine (I never learned any F2L alg and yet I
        can do them around 11 seconds on average.) Good luck ! Gilles.
        2006/1/27, David Pritts &lt;ladartfrog@...&gt;: &gt; I am starting to
        get the hang of intuitive F2L! (it sorta just started to click after i
        struggled through it, looking at the four "algorithms" repeatedly). Now
        I can solve 3 corners with this method without too much trouble,
        although it's still not fast. My old method is still MUCH faster than
        this. &gt; &gt; Question: Generally I have some difficulty inserting the
        last pair into the F2L. Tips? How do I form one of the "fundamental F2L
        cases" when I am so limited in my ability to move the pieces around?
        &gt; &gt; I have been able to do it before, but the last one frequently
        takes a long time... I am realy unable to plan it out (although I am
        starting to get better at actually planning out the first 3, rather than
        just moving rnadomly aroudn until I recognize a pattern), and I sort of
        just play with it for a while. Will I just get better at this? How long
        will I have to use F2L until I get "relatively fast" at it (ie, less
        than 45 seconds in my case) &gt; &gt; thanks &gt; &gt; David &gt; &gt;

        At the beginning I think it's pretty normal to be able to do algorithms
        from only one angle (usuallu FR slot), but you'll manage to do F2L from
        more and more angles with time. Resulting that you won't need many cube
        rotations at the end (cube rotations are not very good because you lose
        too much time, but you'll manage do minimise the number of cube
        rotations you do with time and training.) Gilles. 2006/1/27, Marco
        Garbelini &lt;garbelini@...m&gt;: &gt; I'm starting to play around with
        Fridrich F2L as well. &gt; &gt; How about cube rotations and regrips?
        Should I stick to the same cube &gt; orientation all the way? I keep
        rotating and regripping all the time, or at &gt; least I'm tempted to.

        find ways to improve your solution for any &gt; &gt; case. Just give it
        time and you'll be fine (I never learned any F2L &gt; &gt; alg and yet I

        That's Leyan doing his fake solve. It's pretty cool-- evidently just a
        short scramble for which he memorized the inverse alg. Impresses
        non-cubers and cubers alike :) Sorry about the embedded videos, but they

        Haha, I haven't seen the video yet, but I think I was there for that.
        It's a little magic trick Leyan has... I believe. You basically practice
        scrambling the cube, and then you practice solving that scramble, then
        you can reverse your solve, or reverse your scramble, or whatever. A
        good thing to try because he could do the solve when he's nervous to see
        how he's doing. It's basically a prepared scramble. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Did some serious Domino solving today, 200+ solves. This puzzle is so
        much fun... for example, I solve the bottom layer corners one by one and
        in at least one of the solves I got a very cool continuous solve of
        them: http://stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/videos/domino_coolness.wmv Ok,
        wasn't executed perfectly. But here's the "combined alg" that solved the
        corners. Try it on a 3x3x3 cube: (R2' U' R2 U R2') U' (R2 U R2' U' R2) U
        (L2 U L2' U' L2) U (L2' U' L2 U L2') How does that feel? Cheers! Stefan

        Re: WC2005 Videos Posted Haha, I haven't seen the video yet, but I think
        I was there for that. It's a little magic trick Leyan has... I believe.
        You basically practice scrambling the cube, and then you practice
        solving that scramble, then you can reverse your solve, or reverse your
        scramble, or whatever. A good thing to try because he could do the solve
        when he's nervous to see how he's doing. It's basically a prepared
        scramble. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Jan

        Hey, I don't usually read the posts here because there are so many, but
        I just wanted to know if I could get some feedback on a small minimal
        solver that I wrote awhile back. Hopefully it might be useful to
        someone. It has fixed centers and you have to enter in the algorithm to
        scramble it. The program was originally written to look for short corner
        algs for the Roux method, so it's meant for someone who already knows
        what they're doing. Anyway, I'd appreciate the input:

        solving today, 200+ solves. This puzzle is so much fun... for example, I
        solve the bottom layer corners one by one and in at least one of the
        solves I got a very cool continuous solve of them:
        http://stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/videos/domino_coolness.wmv Ok, wasn't

        (L2 U L2' U' L2) U (L2' U' L2 U L2') How does that feel? Cheers! Stefan

        edges How long do you need with your method? For your step 3, does that
        mean you look at both sides to determine parity? How long does that
        recognition take you? I still suck at recognizing my step 4. It's so
        much easier with colors than with numbers... or maybe I'm just more used
        to it? Nah, I think recognizing colors is more inherently easier cause
        it's more "basic" for the brain. Cheers! Stefan

        Do you know anything about commutators ? If you know how to handle
        commutators on the 3x3, you should be able to solve anything on any
        "cube style" puzzle. Otherwise you can try to adapt some algorithms from
        the 3x3 on the Megaminx. R' U L U' R U L' U' This will permute 3
        corners. You should be able to put all your corners at the right
        position with that. For the orientation you can try to adapt this thing
        : L U L' U L U2 L' R' U' R U' R' U2 R You have to have a straight line
        in front of view (a corner alone at the back), and consider that that

        fast ELL algs &gt; for a complete noob? I have no idea what I'm doing
        when it comes to &gt; this alg set. So far I am looking at the ones on
        speedcubing.com and &gt; I get the feeling that I should probably be
        checking some of the Roux &gt; resources pages as well. &gt; &gt; I
        would appreciate any advice, I'm totally new to this. &gt; &gt; Thanks,

        as indicated by my several posts recently... I am starting to get the
        hang of it, and it is no longer difficult for me.. HOWEVER, it's not
        fast. With my old method, I solved the first layer and used 2 algs to
        solve the 4 pieces in the 2nd layer. WIth this method, a good F2L takes
        about 45 seconds(for me). How much practice do you think it will take me
        such that I can do F2L in less than 45 seconds? I just timed myself 5
        times and I did it in around: 2:25 2:20 1:55 2:12 1:50 Anyways, I can
        see that I'm getting much better with practice, but I'm still anxious to
        get faster so I figured I'd ask.. plus, Craig B told me that he got the
        hang of it in 3-4 days, and it's taken me longer than that, and I think
        i've been doing a relatively heavy amount of cubing in the past few
        days, so I figured I should get it down sooner ^^ Also - although I
        understand this method, do you think it makes a big enough difference in
        time to justify memorizing the 41 algs? This method is pretty good and i
        know it has a potential for being very fast, but assuming I took it
        slowly (maybe 1 a day, or 4-5 a week or something), I could easily
        memorize those algs after a month or two.. would that be noticeably
        faster? It seems to me that having an alg for each case would be
        significantly faster. Let me know. David ps--ordered cubesmith tiles,
        got them on today..very nice -_-

        better at doing them intuitively. If you're worried about progress so
        much and fixated so heavily on taking the easier route just to get a
        little better in 2 months, you're not going to try to understand why the
        algs work as they do. Just keep at it, and you will see the times drop.
        I cubed incredibly heavily for about two weeks before my times were down
        to what they were before learning F2L. But without it, I never would
        have gotten sub-30, much less sub-20. David -Mike [Non-text portions of

        them you will understand them, which will make it easier for you do
        learn F2L fast. There is a few cases that I still have just memorized
        but I know almost every case intuitive, which helps me to use empty
        slots. So, my suggestion is that you look up algs and try to understand

        Hey David, LOL...i think you were a little mistaken when I told you 3-4
        days. It took me 3-4 days, learning from Chris Hardwick, and running
        through solves with him, a lot, and I practiced like mad, and didn't
        time my solves, but rather went really slow through the solve and
        counted my moves, trying to recognize the best pair to do at the time,
        and doing this got me used to recognizing the case, and then once I knew
        I was averaging under 40 moves (easily) and I knew my recognition was
        getting better, I started timing myself and by then my times were
        probably around 50-60 seconds for F2L...kinda clunky and slow...Now I
        average around 20 seconds with F2L, the thing is with F2L intuitive is
        that you end up saving a lot of moves, and chances are the intuitive F2L
        you are using doesn't use empty slots or anything beyond the basic
        F2L...Sure, go ahead and learn the algs blindly (or not) either way you
        will end up doing more moves cuz you won't save the moves using the
        empty slots...I could go on, but I won't... Craig --- In

        Hi Stefan, Interesting approach, and probably one of the best for a true
        Domino. I do not have a Domino, so I use a 3x3x3. This helps indeed

        Almost 15 years ago, I saw Stevie Starr while he performed on a stage at
        a county fair in the SF Bay Area. I sat and watched his act from the
        front row, about 10-15 feet away. The guy is either really doing it, or
        is one of the best sleight of hand artists around (like at the level of
        people like Ricky Jay). I'm still skeptical, but whatever it is it's

        many cubing competitions and most of the wives I've met (the primary

        terribly fast (e.g. usually over a minute), but they do at least solve

        My wife and I learned to solve the cube with a very basic method
        together before I started speedcubing. She never committed any of it to
        memory, and has now lost all interest in it. The cube has become "the

        married! As many of you know, we've been engaged for a very long &gt;
        time &gt; &gt; (since before Worlds 2003 when many of you first met
        Peter!) and &gt; just &gt; &gt; hadn't quite gotten around to actually
        getting married. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I always thought a tropical island
        was a good location for getting &gt; &gt; married, so that's what we
        did! Here's a selection of photos: &gt; &gt;

        Just so this email is at least slightly on topic, I was wondering &gt;
        &gt; whether anyone else is married to someone who hasn't yet learnt
        &gt; solve &gt; &gt; the cube? I've been to many cubing competitions and
        most of the &gt; wives &gt; &gt; I've met (the primary cuber in the
        couple is always the guy) have &gt; learnt &gt; &gt; to solve. Often not
        terribly fast (e.g. usually over a minute), &gt; but they &gt; &gt; do
        at least solve it. I need to get Peter to learn beyond the F2L &gt; so
        we &gt; &gt; can go for the husband + wife record on speedcubing.com! :)

        When I started learning F2L, I tried to memorize. It didn't work out
        until one day (after about a week) when things started clicking. Once I
        saw how the pieces were moving, it was much easier to memorize. It is
        definitely important to know how the algorithms work, so don't just
        memorize them--understand them. This way, it becomes intuitive and
        automatic. Eventually, with some help from a friend, I learned how to
        make use of empty slots and whatnot. I average around 15-16 seconds now,
        having started in late December of 2004. Good luck! Darren --- In

        recently i have actually been working very heavily on F2L. before now i
        was going purely on intuition that i had developed from the petrus
        method but the downside with that is that its not always optimal and
        fast so now i have actually gone back and started memorizing the
        algorithms. What i recommend you do is you print up a page and on pretty
        much every case look at the sheet and see what it says for it. after
        that go through the alg and pay attention to what it does. try and watch
        how the pieces pair up in each alg and how each alg effects all the
        other pieces. some times you can use an algorithm to solve a pair and
        move a piece or to out of the F2L or you can breakup pieces that are
        matched incorrectly. experimentation can lead to understanding but there
        are a lot of tricks that are alot easier learned than they are to figure
        out John, David Pritts &lt;ladartfrog@...&gt; wrote: how fast do you
        guys solve F2L? how does that compare to the total time it takes you to

        my several posts recently... I am starting to get the hang of it, and it
        is no longer difficult for me.. HOWEVER, it's not fast. With my old
        method, I solved the first layer and used 2 algs to solve the 4 pieces
        in the 2nd layer. WIth this method, a good F2L takes about 45
        seconds(for me). How much practice do you think it will take me such
        that I can do F2L in less than 45 seconds? I just timed myself 5 times
        and I did it in around: 2:25 2:20 1:55 2:12 1:50 Anyways, I can see that
        I'm getting much better with practice, but I'm still anxious to get
        faster so I figured I'd ask.. plus, Craig B told me that he got the hang
        of it in 3-4 days, and it's taken me longer than that, and I think i've
        been doing a relatively heavy amount of cubing in the past few days, so
        I figured I should get it down sooner ^^ Also - although I understand
        this method, do you think it makes a big enough difference in time to
        justify memorizing the 41 algs? This method is pretty good and i know it

        Hey, my bday is coming up in a few weeks, and I have decided I want to
        get some new puzzles... unfortunately I'm a bit stumped as to which
        puzzles to ask for. As of now, I have only the 3x3x3. Which puzzles do
        you guys find most satisfying? -revenge cube -professor cube -2x2x2 cube
        -megaminx I think I might choose 2 of the above. At the moment I'm
        leaning heavily towards getting a revenge cube, simply because in terms
        of impressing non-cubists, the 4x4x4 would be useless if they have
        already seen me solve a 5x5x5 -_- I'm aware that the 4x4x4 is very
        difficult. I also think a megaminx looks very interesting. What do you
        guys recommend? --------------------------------- Yahoo! Autos. Looking

        Well I have all of those, although I've only had my megaminx for 3 days,
        that is definately one of them. My pick would be 4x4 and megaminx. The
        4x4 isn't too hard and doesn't take much time like the 5x5 would, yet
        its more complicating than a 3x3, and a megaminx...well they are just so
        much fun...and even if you can't solve it right away people will still
        be amazed. As for a 2x2....they are what $6 and Rubik's 2x2s are usually
        bad so yeah. Well that's my 2 cents. -David

        anyone else is married to someone who hasn't yet learnt solve &gt; the
        cube? I've been to many cubing competitions and most of the wives &gt;
        I've met (the primary cuber in the couple is always the guy) have learnt
        &gt; to solve. Often not terribly fast (e.g. usually over a minute), but
        they &gt; do at least solve it. I need to get Peter to learn beyond the
        F2L so we &gt; can go for the husband + wife record on speedcubing.com!

        So I emailed one of my friends in Australia with the subject line
        "Finally did it!" and with the message "Check out the 30 January entry
        on my blog: http://speedcuber.blogspot.com" (which links to the wedding
        photos). My friend replied saying that blogspot.com sites are blocked
        from her work, so she wasn't sure to what I was referring. Here's part
        of her email which is pretty funny: "I'm guessing you did one of two
        things (or maybe both): 1. got a sub-20 non-lucky solve on the cube 2.
        got married" It's pretty funny that she put the cubing guess *first* on
        the list!! On that point, I still haven't had a non-lucky sub-20s time.
        Best is currently 20.12s. Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com On Mon,

        &gt; &gt; Hi Guys, &gt; This isn't at all related to speedcubing, but
        this is the &gt; easiest way to &gt; send a message to all my
        speedcubing friends whom I haven't yet &gt; emailed. &gt; Anyway, my
        news is that Peter and I went to Hawaii last week and &gt; got &gt;
        married! As many of you know, we've been engaged for a very long &gt;
        time &gt; (since before Worlds 2003 when many of you first met Peter!)
        and &gt; just &gt; hadn't quite gotten around to actually getting
        married. &gt; I always thought a tropical island was a good location for
        &gt; getting &gt; married, so that's what we did! Here's a selection of

        Hi Andy ! Did you try to upload your video on GoogleVideo ? They say
        they have no filesize limit (see text below ...) ---&gt;
        https://upload.video.google.com/ Otherwise, I think there is no filesize
        limit for gmail adresses (mail.google.com). If you'd like to, I can send
        two invitations to you, you create two accounts, send the video from one
        to the other and give us the username/passwords. I just checked it, a
        video can be downloaded from sent mail as well as inbox folders ... Just
        tell us what you think about that, I'd really like to see this vid as
        well ... and the torrent thing is apparently not the optimal way :)
        cyril Google Video Program: Your work deserves to be seen. You've made a
        great video. Now who will watch it? Whether you produce hundreds of
        titles a year or just a few, you can give your videos the recognition
        and visibility they deserve by promoting them on Google - for free.

        I realized that after I solved the F2L, I am now able to orientate and
        permute the edges. Then using a 2corner flip I can orientate the
        corners. Then use a three corner (PLL) rotation and not screw up the
        orientation of the centers - which gives me a solved cube. I will see if
        I can make it easier, or if that is what I will need to do to solve.

        Hey Eric, I like the super3x3, I think it is a very fun cube. I don't
        know exactly how my PLL and OLL algs flip centers, but I can usually
        have an idea if one will flip a side center or not. Basically what I do
        is to solve the F2L while orienting those 5 centers. Then I usually do
        an OLL and either solve edges and then corners with center-safe algs, or
        use a PLL and just flip two centers at the end. I like this for the edge
        3 cycle to also preserve centers: R2 U F B' R2 F' B U2 F B' R2 F' B U R2
        which I do as R2 d' r R' U2 r' R U2 r R' U2 r' R U' y' R2 I think this
        strategy needs improving though since I hate ending with two centers
        flipped the same direction, the only alg I have to solve that is very
        slow, I use: R L U2 L' R' U M E' M' E R L U2 L' R' U E' M E M' I think
        ideally, if the 3x3x3 supercube was the main event and what everyone was
        doing, that probably we would have algs for OLL that leave the side
        centers alone, and algs to solve the PLL correctly in relation to the
        last face center. I think that's an ambitious method to learn, but
        probably what Fridrich would evolve into if people stopped caring about
        the regular 3x3 cube and moved to the supercube. Just my $0.02 Chris ---

        The Eastsheen 2x2x2 (sold at Mefferts) is the superior cube. Check out
        the mechanism: http://tinyurl.com/csol6 It's like a bandaged 3x3x3
        inside. Most of the Rubik's 2x2x2 develop the issue where one of the
        three planes of rotation is much rougher to twist than the other two,
        and harder to align. But the Eastsheen turns flawlessly on all three

        Haha I myself think the 2 Look is too strenuous for memorization at my
        level at least. If you want, try the 3 look LL. Basically there are 2
        moves to permute the edges (well there's actually a 3rd case but you can
        combine the 2 moves to solve that case), another 7 for corner
        permutations (these are 7 from the 57 when the cross is solved) and then
        the 21 orientations. This in my opinion is the best method to start.
        It's less memorization, and spend some time to really get it down. After
        you have it down, you basically already have half of the 2 look down
        cold. It's a good transition method you could say. --- In

        I think that's backwards. Switch "orientation" and "permutation" and
        you're good. Of course, the 4-look LL would be a good starting place,
        then 3- look, then 2-look. Don't jump right into 3 or 2 look; it'll be

        Oh yea I always get those two mixed up. Haha because I always think that
        orienting is putting something where it's suppose to be and yeeaa. I
        actually started out with a very very very bad ll method. Basically you
        orient the edges with those 2 moves I talked about earlier, then you
        permute them. Next you permute the corners (there are 2 moves, well 1,
        the other is just a mirror to rotate 3 corners
        clockwise/counterclockwise), and orient each individual corner with like
        an 8-turn move (total of like 32 turns for 4 corners &gt;.&gt;) such an
        unefficient method, but in total you only had to memorize like a total
        of 8 things. 4 really if you don't count mirrors. --- In

        out with a very very very bad ll method. &gt; Basically you orient the
        edges with those 2 moves I talked about &gt; earlier, then you permute
        them. Next you permute the corners (there &gt; are 2 moves, well 1, the
        other is just a mirror to rotate 3 corners &gt;
        clockwise/counterclockwise), and orient each individual corner with &gt;
        like an 8-turn move (total of like 32 turns for 4 corners &gt;.&gt;)
        such an &gt; unefficient method, but in total you only had to memorize
        like a total &gt; of 8 things. 4 really if you don't count mirrors. &gt;

        good starting place, then 3- &gt; &gt; look, then 2-look. Don't jump
        right into 3 or 2 look; it'll be &gt; &gt; confusing and awful while

        think the 2 Look is too strenuous for memorization &gt; &gt; at my &gt;
        &gt; &gt; level at least. If you want, try the 3 look LL. Basically
        there &gt; &gt; are 2 &gt; &gt; &gt; moves to permute the edges (well
        there's actually a 3rd case but &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; can combine
        the 2 moves to solve that case), another 7 for corner &gt; &gt; &gt;
        permutations (these are 7 from the 57 when the cross is solved) and &gt;
        &gt; &gt; then the 21 orientations. This in my opinion is the best
        method to &gt; &gt; &gt; start. It's less memorization, and spend some
        time to really get it &gt; &gt; &gt; down. After you have it down, you
        basically already have half of &gt; &gt; the 2 &gt; &gt; &gt; look down

        Hello avid cubers! We all know and love the humble Rubik's cube, but,
        there comes a time in any cuber's life when we have to relenquish the
        comfort of the 3x3 and 'tackle' the higher order cubes. Progressing from
        the 3x3 is no major obstacle, since 4x4's are still being produced
        (albeit at relatively high costs) today. Likewise the 5x5 is still on
        the market (touch wood). But beyond that?? I recently stumbled (yes, in
        a link following kinda way) upon this site: www.olympicube.com, which
        you no doubt may have done yourself. On the site is made mention to a
        new method for constructing large cubes, by a greek inventor. BUT hold
        your horses, I've yet to ascertain whether these are to be solved. The
        6x6, of which they/he has a working prototype looks amazing. This post,
        therefore, is to ask you (the wider cubing community) whether you know
        anything more about these so called 'olympic cubes', and whether they
        CAN be purchased. If you have any info that is definitive, might you
        drop me a message at jonathonh@.....? or, else, post here, and I'll try
        to come again ;). As an Australian resident, however, I'm thinking that
        these cubes HAVE been marketed, and I'm just going to have to wait for a
        ripple to come my way, Cheers! and good cubing!

        My second post, and inside 10 minutes... I recently got a 5x5 cube, and
        at the moment, can solve it everytime, but I feel my method isn't
        'tight' and elegant enough. Basically, and as is pretty inuitive, I
        complete the centers, build the edge triplets and solve as a 3x3, which
        requires minimal thought (and practically 0 extra algs). The 'center
        solution' is naturally slow, so I'm going talk exclusively about
        associating the edge triplets. I'd like to hear from anyone who has a
        relatively EFFICIENT way of avoiding the 'parity' error (or, more
        correctly, when you must swap TWO small edge cubies, instead of three).
        To correct this, I simply perform RrU2 five times, which muddles up a
        few edges, but yields a cycle of three. This, I find, is incredibly
        inelegant. Are there any ways to COMPLETELY avoid this possibility. I
        initially thought looking ahead when I had four edges to go (to
        'combine') but this does not seem to have any effect. So what do you
        think?? Jon

        Thanks Everybody. I am going to do a CLL ELL method. I think I will like
        this method, it will be easier looking at 4 cubies per look rathe r than
        8. PLL isn't all that bad, but the OLL will be strenuous. I am still
        discouraged a little bit that my F2L moves are so slow. Are there any
        tips, I think that I need to really practice getting an extended cross,
        and after each extended cross I look at each position. As soon as I
        recognize it I push out the alg 10 times so that I get used to it by
        repetition. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Mike Bennett

        Permute/Orient Edges &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could also interpret this
        as CLL/ELL. I think that this is a good &gt; &gt; option. Many mirrored
        and inversed cases. Less cases than OLL/PLL. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if
        you get bored of Cross, Pair, Pair, Pair, Pair, CLL, ELL, you &gt; &gt;
        can easily switch to B1, B2, CLL, 6E4C. ;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jason K
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Another nice benefit of this is that the ELL can be
        solved using only MU &gt; algs, and are incredibly fast. And yes, Roux
        is an easy jump to make after &gt; this. All the cool kids are doing it.

        for the 5x5 the method you are doing works...and the best site I can

        http://www.bigcubes.com It is a wonderful site, of course there are
        other methods out there, but the one you do is on that site, with all of
        the algorithms. The fix you are referring to, I believe I know what it

        http://img5.imageshack.us/my.php?image=imgp02206rt.jpg Is that the
        one??? If so: do: r2 B2 U2 l U2 r' U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l' B2 r2 It fixes

        the centers, build &gt; the edge triplets and solve as a 3x3, which
        requires minimal thought &gt; (and practically 0 extra algs). The
        'center solution' is naturally &gt; slow, so I'm going talk exclusively
        about associating the edge &gt; triplets. I'd like to hear from anyone
        who has a relatively &gt; EFFICIENT way of avoiding the 'parity' error
        (or, more correctly, &gt; when you must swap TWO small edge cubies,
        instead of three). To &gt; correct this, I simply perform RrU2 five
        times, which muddles up a &gt; few edges, but yields a cycle of three.
        This, I find, is incredibly &gt; inelegant. Are there any ways to
        COMPLETELY avoid this possibility. &gt; I initially thought looking
        ahead when I had four edges to go &gt; (to 'combine') but this does not
        seem to have any effect. &gt; &gt; So what do you think?? &gt; &gt; Jon

        Hey Jon, There absolutely is a way to avoid the parity error, but you're
        not going to like it. The only ways I have found to avoid the edge
        parity 100% of the time are to 1) count the pseudo-edge cycles during
        inspection or 2) count the number of inner face quarter turns in your
        scrambling alg (which is cheating btw) As for counting pseudo-cycles
        basically during inspection you count the cycles to pair up a wing edge
        with it's partner wing edge, not how to pair them up correctly. This is
        exactly how you do it for the 4x4x4, and since the the 5x5 contains a
        4x4 it works there too. This is basically like following the cycles of a
        3x3x3 cube, so max you have to follow 12 cycles, but it's very hard to
        locate the full 12 "pieces" and I have found that the fastest I have
        ever successfully counted pseudo-cycles is a little over 20 seconds. I
        think with a few months training that maybe this could be done in under
        15 seconds most of the time, and maybe with mastery in under 15 seconds.
        The problem is, it would require most of the 15 second inspection, and
        you wouldn't be able to plan any of the first steps of your solve, since
        you would have been too busy counting pseudo-cycles. Also, I doubt the
        accuracy of this method in a competition setting where nerves become a
        factor and you might miss a piece, or miscount the cycle. Also, yeah
        your method is populary known as "centers-first", and is a good method.
        The alg Craig posted is good to fix parity. There are a few other ones
        for the 5x5, but I don't know them very well. There is one that starts
        with your (r' U2)x4 r' and then moves edges back though. Check
        bigcubes.com for other cool algs. If you're crazy enough to try counting
        pseudo-cycles I'll explain in depth how to do it, but from my experience
        it's not worth it. Happy cubing, Chris --- In

        10 minutes... &gt; &gt; I recently got a 5x5 cube, and at the moment,
        can solve it &gt; everytime, but I feel my method isn't 'tight' and
        elegant enough. &gt; Basically, and as is pretty inuitive, I complete
        the centers, build &gt; the edge triplets and solve as a 3x3, which
        requires minimal thought &gt; (and practically 0 extra algs). The
        'center solution' is naturally &gt; slow, so I'm going talk exclusively
        about associating the edge &gt; triplets. I'd like to hear from anyone
        who has a relatively &gt; EFFICIENT way of avoiding the 'parity' error
        (or, more correctly, &gt; when you must swap TWO small edge cubies,
        instead of three). To &gt; correct this, I simply perform RrU2 five
        times, which muddles up a &gt; few edges, but yields a cycle of three.
        This, I find, is incredibly &gt; inelegant. Are there any ways to
        COMPLETELY avoid this possibility. &gt; I initially thought looking
        ahead when I had four edges to go &gt; (to 'combine') but this does not
        seem to have any effect. &gt; &gt; So what do you think?? &gt; &gt; Jon

        Hi :-) That's a horrible way to do it. Only turn the TOP layer 45
        degrees. Then bend the edge triplet of top layer upwards while bending
        the adjacent layer downwards. Well, that's just my opinion. Oh, and
        there's no need to disassemble it to get lube inside. Just use the
        flexible thin tube that came w the can to get the silicone inside. Some
        turning of the cube will make the silicone distribute itself nicely :-)
        Spray a little from several angles. Do the turning and then repeat a few
        times the very first time the cube is lubed. Later, much less lube is
        needed each time. After a long time and several lube sessions it's a
        good idea to wash it all away before lubing. This will indeed require to
        take the cube apart :-) Have fun! -Per &gt; --- In

        sounds like a lot of work to avoid the flip. i can execute that alg in
        about 4 or 5 seconds, and its not really all that common of an ending. i
        find if i do see it happen or that its going to happen when i get to the
        last couple of edges, i might try this move which flips 2 middle centers
        at FL and FR. E' F U F' L F' L' F E (number 4 on
        http://bigcubes.com/5x5x5/lastedges.html is the mirror of this and will
        also work, i've found its easier for me to do it on the left side
        instead of the right) i think there are other endings that are crappier
        and take more time than the centerflip one, at least for me. to avoid
        this completely check out the cage method (Per knows this method well)
        for solving its, it fixes the edges before all the centers, like how
        mike said. hope this helps. ----- Original Message ---- From: mike_go_uk

        Thanks for your reply Chris! It is quite an honour! (excuse the
        spelling...) I understand perfectly what you are talking about, but,
        somehow, I just don't see counting the edge cycles as being very
        practical - at all. So, you're right, I DON'T like it ;). There is
        frankly, too much opportunity to MISCOUNT/ miss a cycle etc etc. If this
        TRULY is the only way to avoid my problem, then the way I treat it might
        seem to be the most effective. Craig and your site reference
        (www.bigcubes.com) is comprehensive, but I am reluctant to use
        algorithms I have not worked out for myself, especially when I can't
        REALLY see them speeding up the solve that much. Besides, there are
        quite a few of the edge algs to rememeber, and at the moment, (since I
        can hardly speed solve the 5x5) I just want a more 'elegant' method. By
        the way, may I ask what your average is? Mine is quite poor at the
        moment (I've had the 5x5 for around a week now). My main failing is the
        center solution, which proceeds thusly: solve opposite faces !! (at the
        time this was the easiest to do, except the last pair is a bit
        'wishy-washy'...) Again, thanks for the reply, and happy cubing to you!

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I know this is the third post on this idea in a short
        period, but I &gt; am &gt; &gt; taking this 'project' very seriously.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe this is a great way to recognize the
        cubers that have &gt; helped &gt; &gt; the community so much. :) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy Cubing, &gt; &gt; -Richard &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Yeah that would be cool. You said the centers and other pieces all look
        different. Since a picture speaks a thousand words, maybe some closeup

        - You may use multiple cubes to aid in your attempt. Sounds to me like
        you can scramble 12 cubes and just solve them in a row without
        scrambling. Having someone else do scrambling is in the same spirit I'd
        say. Cheers! Stefan

        Heh, that would be the simple solution :p I'll explain as fully as I
        can... The set comes in a big ziploc bag with all the pieces in it
        loosely, screws, washers, the whole shebang...And the screws look
        longer...and the washers are flat on one side, curved on the other...i
        put the flat side against the spring...The edge pieces just look
        smoother, and the corner pieces, like the "corner cap" as I'll call it,
        looks like it has a bit of an opening to it...its not a full piece...
        The center caps - uhh...how to explain...ok...Take a white DIY center
        cap, add 2 little nobbies on each side, and on 2 opposite sides, make 1
        of them longer, and thats what u have, they don't stay in place, but you
        can still use paper :) (as i did) or glue (don't...u'll kill ur cube...)
        Anything else??? I'm trying to help best i can... Craig --- In

        Yeah that would be cool. You said the centers and other &gt; pieces all
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look different. Since a picture speaks a thousand
        words, &gt; maybe some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; closeup shots would be handy.

        I have a question about comparing scrambles like this. Since many CFOP
        solvers start with a white cross, the orientation of the cube at the
        beginning of the scramble will make a difference. Is it an unspoken
        assumption that you always scramble with white on top and green in front
        (or just white on top)? In this case, I did scramble that way and I see
        the easy Xcross for white. I'm just curious because nobody ever mentions
        which color cross they were going for in these examples. Chris --- In

        reading it, it's a great link. My aim is to try and do the cube
        blindfolded with no algorithms and just commutators and conjugates, but
        I'm finding this hard at the moment due to trying to remember the
        inverse of the alg :S I found a couple of them that'd be good for
        blindsolving algs, I could just remember these and use them, but what's
        the fun in that? :P Flip edges: X = MDM'D'MD2M' Rotate corners: X =

        I know it'd be good to tell the orientation of the cube to start before

        comparing scrambles like this. Since many &gt; &gt; CFOP solvers start
        with a white cross, the orientation of the cube at &gt; &gt; the
        beginning of the scramble will make a difference. Is it an &gt; &gt;
        unspoken assumption that you always scramble with white on top and &gt;
        &gt; green in front (or just white on top)? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this
        case, I did scramble that way and I see the easy Xcross for &gt; &gt;
        white. I'm just curious because nobody ever mentions which color &gt;
        &gt; cross they were going for in these examples. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

      <div class="email-content">
        This post is rather technical in nature but if you do understand the
        technicalities the details are not difficult. It deals with solving
        sizeable cubes in a canonical way. To alert you, this post is about
        infinite cubes. The scrambling is assumed to be a function from some
        ordinal into the slice space (including face turns and inner slices). In
        particular the scramble might not be finite (so it's not part of the
        group generated by the slices, in general). The solution described will
        also often be infinite even if the scramble is not. The aim is to solve
        the cube in type alpha where the cube length is of type 1+alpha+n (+1)
        +n+alpha*+1. Consider a cube of length type 1+alpha + n (+1 if odd) + n
        +alpha* +1 (where alpha is some limit ordinal - I'm not going to try to
        consider more complicated than that - and alpha* is the reverse order
        type of alpha (so n+alpha* is actually the reverse order type of n) - so
        the centres are a square of length type alpha + n (+1 if odd) + n +
        alpha*. If alpha is 0, this is just a regular cube, but what if it is
        not? That's the case under discussion here. We can fix an initial
        orientation of the scrambled cube by either (in the case of an even
        cube) assuming the UFR corner is solved or (in the case of an odd cube)
        assuming the very centre squares are solved placed in whatever way we
        usually would place them - i.e. U at U, F at F etc. It is clear that
        each centre can be decomposed into pieces 4 of which are easily type
        (2n)*alpha=alpha or (2n+1)*alpha=alpha (depending on n being odd or
        even), 4 of which are easily typed alpha^2 (going in from the corners)
        and then canonically reordered in type alpha and (in the odd case) 4 of
        type alpha and either (2n)^2 (even case) or (2n+1)^2 (odd case).
        Moreover the edges can be typed either as 2*alpha or 1+2*alpha (i.e.
        alpha). Since m+alpha=alpha for all finite m, we can put the centres
        (2n)^2 or (2n+1)^2 first without increasing the type and then it is easy
        to arrange the 8 (or 12) alphas to get 12*alpha=alpha, so that we can
        type each centre in type alpha and hence the whole in type
        6*alpha=alpha. Moreover the edges can be typed in 24*alpha or
        12=24*alpha=alpha and the corners in type 8, giving a total typing of
        8+2*alpha=alpha. So we can type the entire cube in type alpha. We can
        also do it in such a way that the corners all come first and this for
        each centre position all the edges that can be reached by producing from
        its orbit (either 12 or 24 of them) come before that centre position. We
        can assume that centre postions (in a particular coordinate) are all
        consecutive and ordered according to a particular face dictionary (e.g.
        U,D,F,B,R,L). e.g. the position in the U face diagonally next to the UBL
        piece comes directly before the corresponding position in the D face
        (adjacent DFL) which is directly before the one in the F face (adjacent
        FLU) etc. - using a net diagram of the cube surface. Memorize the cube
        position in type alpha. (You could go for type card(alpha) but the
        mapping might not be as easy and some of the canonical aspects may not
        be preserved.) Now we proceed to solve the cube by transfinite
        induction. We are solving ordering on the positions not the pieces (so
        the fact that we have lots of pieces that could conceivably go in the
        same place is irrelevant). We start by making sure that the corners are
        evenly permuted (by using D if necessary). We can then solve the corners
        with 3 cycles and orientation moves. If the cube is odd we can then also
        do the 12 central most edges in 3 cycles and orientation moves. So
        assume all that is done. It takes finite type. Given a position, we
        assume all lower positions have been solved. There are two cases: 1. the
        current position is solved - and we are done with the stage. 2. the
        current position is not solved. If the current position is not solved
        then there must be another element in its orbit (by which I mean the
        orbit of the pieces that can go into this position) which is also not
        solved (a later position). If there are two such other positions then we
        can certainly apply one of the standard algorithms for a finite cube
        (e.g. a 5x5x5) to cycle the 3 pieces in the earliest such positions,
        solving the earliest of those positions without changing any of the rest
        of the cube and we are done with the stage. So next we must consider the
        possibility that there are only two unsolved positions in the cycle. If
        the position is an edge then all the centre positions in the slice
        containing that edge are later positions. Slicing the edge quarter of a
        turn will disturb either 2 or 3 of the already solved positions but will
        reduce things to an even permutation for that orbit so that we can go
        back to the earlier elements of the orbit and solve again (this time the
        whole bunch) in a couple of 3 cycles. We can choose to slice the edge so
        that the current position goes into the earlier position, for
        definiteness. So now the problem comes - what if the current position is
        a centre position. Since the corners are solved and so are all the edges
        produced from its orbit.this case cannot in fact arise. The evenness of
        the other two implying the eveness of the permutation of this orbit, so
        we can't possibly arrive in this situation. Therefore we can always
        solve the position without disturbing the lower positions (except for
        edge slicing and here there is only once choice of slice) and either no
        higher positions or a canonical choice of higher positions, using
        canonical permutations (either 2 earliest unsolved pieces in a 3-cycle
        or all the D centre on the first move (in case the corner permutation is
        odd) but that is a canonical permutation or of 2-3 higher edges and a
        bunch of centres in a slice but again the slice direction has been
        chosen in a canonical way and since in the original ordering the centre
        pieces are arranged in blocks of 6 (each corresponding to the same
        position but in each face according to a face dictionary - e.g.
        U,D,F,B,R,L) the slice even reorders the centre pieces in a canonical
        way. Note each step (plus, if necessary the fixing of the finite number
        of displaced earlier positions - in edge slicing - though not in such
        step the fixing of the later centre positions) takes only finitely many
        moves. Therefore this system will solve the cube in type alpha and
        because all the distortions along the way are all canonical, it could
        even be in principle be used as a useful method for blindfold cubing.

        is itself conjugated by the identity element) but of course that's
        rather trivial. (* Of course, whether the representation used in the

        Hi, I was just watching a movie and saw a cube. After some searching, I
        don't believe that this has ever been pointed out before. Something like
        30 minutes into the movie "Hitch" is a cube lying on the office desk of
        the character played by EvaM. Wonder if this has anything to do with
        WillS being part of the cast. This is rather brief, and I was supprised
        (caught it a moment ago) because I had seen this movie many times before
        and never saw it before. Anyone else notice this sighting? Hem...,
        looking forward to watching "The Pursuit of Happyness" when it comes out
        (in 10-14 months), which features a cube for more than a second. Totally
        unrelated, but oddly enough I was sad to see Chris/Tristin leave on
        BatG2 tonight. That show is so awesome. Contact me for episodes, cuz I
        know lots of ppl are anti-bittorrent for whatever reason and I have a
        fast connection. Hem... Tyson/Thais going (last week) was really sudden,

        (This algorithm is from http://tinyurl.com/dgl8d) The explanation they

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I have a new LL strategy for centers first people to
        propose and analyze in this post. I am trying to come up with new ways
        to handle the parities on a 4x4, and am requesting we put our brains to
        this task. Here is the idea, to only have the double parity (meaning do
        an alg to fix the orientation parity, then do an alg later in the solve
        to fix the permutation parity) 1/8 the time instead of 1/4. To do this
        break the orientation parity cases into 2 groups. 1 oriented LL edge: Do
        either the parity alg or double parity alg leaving a 50-50 chance to
        also have PLL parity so to encounter double parity here is a 1/8 chance
        overall. 3 oriented LL edges: Do a COLL alg, now recognizing whether the
        3x3 edge groups have the same parity as the corners is very easy. So if
        you have double parity do the double parity fix pure version, if not do
        the regular parity fix pure version. So that means only 1/8 the time you
        do 2 algs. Now don't get excited yet, this method stinks. Here are the
        times for each LL strategy (for me). I did an average of each alg.
        permutation parity fix: 02.34, 02.24, 02.63, (03.28), 02.44, 02.73,
        02.68, 02.23, 02.43, 02.90, 02.79, (02.11) = 2.54 average orientation
        parity (speedsolve version - double parity alg): 04.94, 04.47, 05.34,
        04.91, 04.65, 05.03, 04.42, 04.45, (04.18), (05.52), 04.97, 05.29 = 4.85
        average double parity alg pure version: 06.23, 07.56, (06.02), 08.10,
        06.50, (08.24), 08.02, 06.71, 07.64, 07.33, 06.42, 06.24 = 7.07 average
        orientation-parity-only alg pure version 06.06, (05.98), 06.79, 06.75,
        06.77, 06.38, (08.66), 06.51, 06.41, 06.66, 07.40, 07.60 = 6.73 average
        So here is the analysis of the extra time spent on average just fixing
        parities: Conventional method with 1/4 double parity: 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54
        + 0.25*4.85 + 0.25*(2.54+4.85) = 3.70 seconds on average to fix
        parities. ----- and with the new 1/8 double parity method 0.25*0 +
        0.25*2.54 + 0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) + 0.125*(7.07) +
        0.125*(6.73) = 3.89 seconds on average spent fixing parities. Also
        solving with the new way I have to do COLL vs. OLL 1/8 the time which is
        probably 1 second longer. So 1/8 second overall. Making the 3.89
        actually 4.02 seconds. In order to make this faster than the
        conventional approach I would need to solve the pure version double
        parity alg (x) and the pure version orientation-parity-only alg (y) in:
        3.70 = 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) + 0.125*(x)
        + 0.125*(y) + 0.125 2.94 = 0.125*(12.24 + x + y) 11.28 seconds = x + y
        Which means the sum of both pure alg versions has to be 11.28 seconds or
        less. We can assume that x can be no faster than 4.85 and y can be no
        faster than 5.55 which is my average for the speed solve
        orientation-parity-only alg (again this analysis is done with my times,
        since those are the only available to me right now). 05.82, 05.38,
        05.11, 05.82, 05.54, 05.58, (04.75), (06.07), 05.57, 05.52, 05.74, 05.39
        = 5.55 seconds So that means there is only a give room of about 0.8 or
        0.4 seconds per alg. Meaning that my pure version double parity alg can
        only be 0.4 slower than my speed solve version and same for the
        orientation-only-parity algs. I don't think that's possible for me. So
        in conclusion again, this method stinks. But can we somehow reduce the
        1/4 chance to do both parities and, for me, take 7.39 doing nothing but
        fixing parities. I mean come on that amount of time is ridiculous. Added
        on to a solve that would otherwise have been 55 seconds means that
        11.91% of the solve is fixing parities. Fixing parities. That's
        ridiculous, we shouldn't have the standard accept that as ok. Can we
        take anything from this and form a different, better strategy? Any
        ideas? My only idea so far is to use the COLL case when you have
        orientation parity to guess the corner permutation and then compare it
        to the edge permutation. I think that is fairly thought intensive
        though, so the amount of decision time required could actually make that
        strategy take more time fixing parities on average. Alright, well I'm
        trying to think of something new, anyone else have ideas? Also, should
        the centers first method be scrapped entirely in favor of a cage method?
        That would allow me flexibility to fix the orientation parity (the only
        one!) and also commutators are very easy to come up with on the fly once
        you have practice and experience with them. So with mastery it seems to
        me that maybe a cage method is a better choice in the long run than a
        centers first method. Fixing parity sucks, but the fact that the edge
        permutation is completely independent of the rest of the cube (!) is
        what makes the 4x4 so cool in my opinion :-D Chris P.S. If you actually
        made it to the end of this post congratulations. I know it's long, but I
        want to come up with a better way to handle the 4x4 parities. Even if it
        only saves 0.5 second on average, that's still time saved. Thanks for
        your time spent reading.

        Interesting post, I can see this is consuming your very being at the
        moment. (and I fully understand). Firstly, I'd like to agree with your
        comment at the bottom, about the edge permutation (and it being
        independent of this rest of the cube) - the 4x4 rocks! Anyway, you made
        mention of a 'cage' method, which I haven't heard of before. Could this
        be where you do the centers last? My original method was just this, but
        I found it was a bit touch-and-go, however, doing it this way, I could
        correct the parity errors (at least the orientation one, not sure on the
        other one, my 4x4 is kaputt) before they occured (and no, this was not
        elegant). At the time I thought this method (even if it was 'beginners')
        was awful. A shame to leave the privacy of my room, so to speak. As the
        cubes get larger, the centers first method becomes increasingly
        applicable (and efficient), but for the 4x4 is there promise with this
        cage method I wonder? If so, I might have to have another look! Cheers,
        happy cubing!

        Because you are directly solving more pieces, there is greater potential
        for speed. The resolving to a 3x3 portion of centers first approaches is
        very abstract compared to directly solving each piece or group of
        pieces. However, I think a hybrid of the two will be the best in the
        end. Maybe I'm biased ;), but I see more promise in beginning with two
        1x3x4 blocks, then U corners, then finishing edges/taking care of
        parities, then solving 4 M centers. The speedsolve OLL parity alg for
        this is 13 moves long, all l/l' r and U2. Finishing the edges is largely
        in the air, but it can be done any number of ways. The way that I found
        that I use is to pair them up, then orient, but I think perhaps directly
        placing 2 at a time may have good results, as well, as may finishing one
        slice, then the other. Either way, if more people were to use this sort
        of approach as opposed to centers first, I'm sure much progress could be
        made. Chris -Mike [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]

        YES... HEHE...I couldn't apply this but maybe: Have an alg for the OLL

        do a COLL case to solve the corners, and leave the edges to be
        permuted...The way I do my LL is 4LLL, so I've never gotten one of the
        corner PLL parities...i'm kinda happy about that...not sure which is
        faster...cuz if you do: 1 alg for edges (1,2,3,4) then COLL, then PLL

        new LL strategy for centers first people to propose and &gt; analyze in
        this post. I am trying to come up with new ways to handle &gt; the
        parities on a 4x4, and am requesting we put our brains to this task.
        &gt; &gt; Here is the idea, to only have the double parity (meaning do
        an alg to &gt; fix the orientation parity, then do an alg later in the
        solve to fix &gt; the permutation parity) 1/8 the time instead of 1/4.
        To do this break &gt; the orientation parity cases into 2 groups. &gt;
        &gt; 1 oriented LL edge: &gt; Do either the parity alg or double parity
        alg leaving a 50-50 chance &gt; to also have PLL parity so to encounter
        double parity here is a 1/8 &gt; chance overall. &gt; &gt; 3 oriented LL
        edges: &gt; Do a COLL alg, now recognizing whether the 3x3 edge groups
        have the &gt; same parity as the corners is very easy. So if you have
        double parity &gt; do the double parity fix pure version, if not do the
        regular parity &gt; fix pure version. &gt; &gt; So that means only 1/8
        the time you do 2 algs. Now don't get excited &gt; yet, this method
        stinks. &gt; &gt; Here are the times for each LL strategy (for me). I
        did an average of &gt; each alg. &gt; &gt; permutation parity fix: &gt;
        02.34, 02.24, 02.63, (03.28), 02.44, 02.73, 02.68, 02.23, 02.43, &gt;
        02.90, 02.79, (02.11) = 2.54 average &gt; &gt; orientation parity
        (speedsolve version - double parity alg): &gt; 04.94, 04.47, 05.34,
        04.91, 04.65, 05.03, 04.42, 04.45, (04.18), &gt; (05.52), 04.97, 05.29 =
        4.85 average &gt; &gt; double parity alg pure version: &gt; 06.23,
        07.56, (06.02), 08.10, 06.50, (08.24), 08.02, 06.71, 07.64, &gt; 07.33,
        06.42, 06.24 = 7.07 average &gt; &gt; orientation-parity-only alg pure
        version &gt; 06.06, (05.98), 06.79, 06.75, 06.77, 06.38, (08.66), 06.51,
        06.41, &gt; 06.66, 07.40, 07.60 = 6.73 average &gt; &gt; So here is the
        analysis of the extra time spent on average just fixing &gt; parities:
        &gt; &gt; Conventional method with 1/4 double parity: &gt; &gt; 0.25*0 +
        0.25*2.54 + 0.25*4.85 + 0.25*(2.54+4.85) = 3.70 seconds on &gt; average
        to fix parities. &gt; &gt; ----- &gt; &gt; and with the new 1/8 double
        parity method &gt; &gt; 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.125*(4.85+2.54) +
        0.125*(4.85) + 0.125*(7.07) + &gt; 0.125*(6.73) = 3.89 seconds on
        average spent fixing parities. &gt; &gt; Also solving with the new way I
        have to do COLL vs. OLL 1/8 the time &gt; which is probably 1 second
        longer. So 1/8 second overall. Making the &gt; 3.89 actually 4.02
        seconds. &gt; &gt; In order to make this faster than the conventional
        approach I would &gt; need to solve the pure version double parity alg
        (x) and the pure &gt; version orientation-parity-only alg (y) in: &gt;
        &gt; 3.70 = 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) + &gt;
        0.125*(x) + 0.125*(y) + 0.125 &gt; &gt; 2.94 = 0.125*(12.24 + x + y)
        &gt; &gt; 11.28 seconds = x + y &gt; &gt; Which means the sum of both
        pure alg versions has to be 11.28 seconds &gt; or less. &gt; &gt; We can
        assume that x can be no faster than 4.85 and y can be no faster &gt;
        than 5.55 which is my average for the speed solve &gt;
        orientation-parity-only alg (again this analysis is done with my &gt;
        times, since those are the only available to me right now). &gt; &gt;
        05.82, 05.38, 05.11, 05.82, 05.54, 05.58, (04.75), (06.07), 05.57, &gt;
        05.52, 05.74, 05.39 = 5.55 seconds &gt; &gt; So that means there is only
        a give room of about 0.8 or 0.4 seconds &gt; per alg. Meaning that my
        pure version double parity alg can only be &gt; 0.4 slower than my speed
        solve version and same for the &gt; orientation-only-parity algs. I
        don't think that's possible for me. &gt; So in conclusion again, this
        method stinks. &gt; &gt; But can we somehow reduce the 1/4 chance to do
        both parities and, for &gt; me, take 7.39 doing nothing but fixing
        parities. I mean come on that &gt; amount of time is ridiculous. Added
        on to a solve that would &gt; otherwise have been 55 seconds means that
        11.91% of the solve is &gt; fixing parities. Fixing parities. That's
        ridiculous, we shouldn't &gt; have the standard accept that as ok. &gt;
        &gt; Can we take anything from this and form a different, better
        strategy? &gt; Any ideas? My only idea so far is to use the COLL case
        when you have &gt; orientation parity to guess the corner permutation
        and then compare it &gt; to the edge permutation. I think that is fairly
        thought intensive &gt; though, so the amount of decision time required
        could actually make &gt; that strategy take more time fixing parities on
        average. Alright, &gt; well I'm trying to think of something new, anyone
        else have ideas? &gt; &gt; Also, should the centers first method be
        scrapped entirely in favor of &gt; a cage method? That would allow me
        flexibility to fix the orientation &gt; parity (the only one!) and also
        commutators are very easy to come up &gt; with on the fly once you have
        practice and experience with them. So &gt; with mastery it seems to me
        that maybe a cage method is a better &gt; choice in the long run than a
        centers first method. &gt; &gt; Fixing parity sucks, but the fact that
        the edge permutation is &gt; completely independent of the rest of the
        cube (!) is what makes the &gt; 4x4 so cool in my opinion :-D &gt; &gt;
        Chris &gt; &gt; P.S. If you actually made it to the end of this post
        congratulations. &gt; I know it's long, but I want to come up with a
        better way to handle &gt; the 4x4 parities. Even if it only saves 0.5
        second on average, that's &gt; still time saved. Thanks for your time
        spent reading. &gt;

        I mean you will need a fast video card (and CPU), due to the high
        bitrate. A lot pixels are getting thrown on the screen, and it sounds
        like your hardware can't keep up. You could try playing it back at 50%
        size and see if that helps. I can play it on a 1Ghz Pentium M laptop no
        problem. The video is so well produced, I actually want a DVD video of
        it. Andy, any chance you could offer to mail it out to folks for $10
        each or something? Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        screws, washers, the whole shebang...And the screws look longer...and
        &gt; the washers are flat on one side, curved on the other...i put the
        flat &gt; side against the spring...The edge pieces just look smoother,
        and the &gt; corner pieces, like the "corner cap" as I'll call it, looks
        like it &gt; has a bit of an opening to it...its not a full piece...
        &gt; &gt; The center caps - uhh...how to explain...ok...Take a white DIY
        center &gt; cap, add 2 little nobbies on each side, and on 2 opposite
        sides, make &gt; 1 of them longer, and thats what u have, they don't
        stay in place, but &gt; you can still use paper :) (as i did) or glue

        I've never actually seen anyone playing with one on NUMB3RS, but it
        could easily happen. I wouldn't be surprised if they used the cube to
        describe group theory or something in a future episode. The 5x5x5 I saw
        last time was sitting on a shelf very poorly scrambled and with several
        sides twisted 45 degrees. Which makes it look kind of cool but obviously
        not the way any cuber would set it down. Off-topic, but does anyone find
        it difficult to leave a cube sitting around scrambled? I have two 3x3's,
        a 4x4 and a 5x5 on my desk at work, and I can't focus on work if any of
        them are scrambled. On 2/2/06, Evan Gates &lt;evan.gates@...&gt; wrote:

        &gt; &gt; Hi, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was just watching a movie and saw a
        cube. After some searching, I &gt; &gt; don't believe that this has ever
        been pointed out before. Something &gt; &gt; like 30 minutes into the
        movie "Hitch" is a cube lying on the office &gt; &gt; desk of the
        character played by EvaM. Wonder if this has anything to &gt; &gt; do
        with WillS being part of the cast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is rather
        brief, and I was supprised (caught it a moment ago) &gt; &gt; because I
        had seen this movie many times before and never saw it &gt; &gt; before.
        Anyone else notice this sighting? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hem..., looking
        forward to watching "The Pursuit of Happyness" when &gt; &gt; it comes
        out (in 10-14 months), which features a cube for more than &gt; &gt; a
        second. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Totally unrelated, but oddly enough I was
        sad to see Chris/Tristin &gt; &gt; leave on BatG2 tonight. That show is
        so awesome. Contact me for &gt; &gt; episodes, cuz I know lots of ppl
        are anti-bittorrent for whatever &gt; &gt; reason and I have a fast
        connection. Hem... Tyson/Thais going (last &gt; &gt; week) was really

        all the pieces in it loosely, &gt; &gt; screws, washers, the whole

        &gt; corner pieces, like the "corner cap" as I'll call it, looks like it
        &gt; &gt; has a bit of an opening to it...its not a full piece... &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; The center caps - uhh...how to explain...ok...Take a

        on 2 opposite sides, make &gt; &gt; 1 of them longer, and thats what u
        have, they don't stay in place, but &gt; &gt; you can still use paper :)

        slice space (including face turns and inner slices). In particular the
        &gt; scramble might not be finite (so it's not part of the group

        also often be infinite even if the scramble is not. The &gt; aim is to

        Craig, thanks for the detailed description. So the corner caps have been
        shrunk, further reducing the amount of plastic and making the cube
        potentially even lighter. Does that seem to affect the turning at all? I
        can imagine silicone lubricant seeping to the interior of the corner
        pieces now. But on the other hand, there is less surface area in contact
        so less friction. Formerly the corner caps (as you call them) had a
        small tab connecting to the "foot" of the corner. On some cubies this
        tab is so thick that it causes the cube to catch, and must be sanded or
        worn down. Can you tell if the new corners have this problem? Chris ---

        number of quarter turns. If you mean conjugates only of commutators then
        you can only solve cubes requiring an even number of quarter turns to
        solve. Thus you can't solve that scramble. i.e. U cannot be solved using
        only commutators (and conjugates of commutators). Stefan's post is to
        point out that restricting yourself in this way doesn't allow for that
        position to be solved.

        my &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fastest U2 move. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; My best time is 0.28 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        think it's possible to reach sub 0.25 seconds but it's &gt; &gt; kinda
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi everyone, to fix the parity I use a method I'm sure you know but I'd
        like to remember it to you because in any cases you only have to do one
        parity alg. When I've solved the F2L I look if there is a Oll parity or
        not. 1°) If not you do the OLL and then PLL (with sometimes the PLL
        parity) 2°) If there is a OLL parity problem, you do an OLL so that only
        one edge remains flipped(you can choose the OLL between several of them,
        and choose the shortest one). Then you can easily see if there is also a
        PLL parity or not, and you do the OLL parity alg or the both parity alg
        depending on the situation. So you have zero or one alg to do. I use
        this method (like Yuki) since a long time and it wokrs pretty well.
        You've almost no break after little practice. And it seems easier than
        learning COLL or something else. What do you think of that? Olivier ---

        new LL strategy for centers first people to propose and &gt; &gt;
        analyze in this post. I am trying to come up with new ways to handle
        &gt; &gt; the parities on a 4x4, and am requesting we put our brains to
        this task. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is the idea, to only have the double
        parity (meaning do an alg to &gt; &gt; fix the orientation parity, then
        do an alg later in the solve to fix &gt; &gt; the permutation parity)
        1/8 the time instead of 1/4. To do this break &gt; &gt; the orientation
        parity cases into 2 groups. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 oriented LL edge: &gt;
        &gt; Do either the parity alg or double parity alg leaving a 50-50
        chance &gt; &gt; to also have PLL parity so to encounter double parity
        here is a 1/8 &gt; &gt; chance overall. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3 oriented
        LL edges: &gt; &gt; Do a COLL alg, now recognizing whether the 3x3 edge
        groups have the &gt; &gt; same parity as the corners is very easy. So if
        you have double parity &gt; &gt; do the double parity fix pure version,
        if not do the regular parity &gt; &gt; fix pure version. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So that means only 1/8 the time you do 2 algs. Now don't get
        excited &gt; &gt; yet, this method stinks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here are
        the times for each LL strategy (for me). I did an average of &gt; &gt;
        each alg. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permutation parity fix: &gt; &gt; 02.34,
        02.24, 02.63, (03.28), 02.44, 02.73, 02.68, 02.23, 02.43, &gt; &gt;
        02.90, 02.79, (02.11) = 2.54 average &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation
        parity (speedsolve version - double parity alg): &gt; &gt; 04.94, 04.47,
        05.34, 04.91, 04.65, 05.03, 04.42, 04.45, (04.18), &gt; &gt; (05.52),
        04.97, 05.29 = 4.85 average &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; double parity alg pure
        version: &gt; &gt; 06.23, 07.56, (06.02), 08.10, 06.50, (08.24), 08.02,
        06.71, 07.64, &gt; &gt; 07.33, 06.42, 06.24 = 7.07 average &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; orientation-parity-only alg pure version &gt; &gt; 06.06,
        (05.98), 06.79, 06.75, 06.77, 06.38, (08.66), 06.51, 06.41, &gt; &gt;
        06.66, 07.40, 07.60 = 6.73 average &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So here is the
        analysis of the extra time spent on average just fixing &gt; &gt;
        parities: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Conventional method with 1/4 double
        parity: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.25*4.85 +
        0.25*(2.54+4.85) = 3.70 seconds on &gt; &gt; average to fix parities.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and with the new 1/8
        double parity method &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 +
        0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) + 0.125*(7.07) + &gt; &gt; 0.125*(6.73)
        = 3.89 seconds on average spent fixing parities. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Also solving with the new way I have to do COLL vs. OLL 1/8 the time
        &gt; &gt; which is probably 1 second longer. So 1/8 second overall.
        Making the &gt; &gt; 3.89 actually 4.02 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In
        order to make this faster than the conventional approach I would &gt;
        &gt; need to solve the pure version double parity alg (x) and the pure
        &gt; &gt; version orientation-parity-only alg (y) in: &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 3.70 = 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) + &gt;
        &gt; 0.125*(x) + 0.125*(y) + 0.125 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.94 =
        0.125*(12.24 + x + y) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 11.28 seconds = x + y &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Which means the sum of both pure alg versions has to be
        11.28 seconds &gt; &gt; or less. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We can assume that
        x can be no faster than 4.85 and y can be no faster &gt; &gt; than 5.55
        which is my average for the speed solve &gt; &gt;
        orientation-parity-only alg (again this analysis is done with my &gt;
        &gt; times, since those are the only available to me right now). &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 05.82, 05.38, 05.11, 05.82, 05.54, 05.58, (04.75),
        (06.07), 05.57, &gt; &gt; 05.52, 05.74, 05.39 = 5.55 seconds &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; So that means there is only a give room of about 0.8 or 0.4
        seconds &gt; &gt; per alg. Meaning that my pure version double parity
        alg can only be &gt; &gt; 0.4 slower than my speed solve version and
        same for the &gt; &gt; orientation-only-parity algs. I don't think
        that's possible for me. &gt; &gt; So in conclusion again, this method
        stinks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But can we somehow reduce the 1/4 chance to
        do both parities and, for &gt; &gt; me, take 7.39 doing nothing but
        fixing parities. I mean come on that &gt; &gt; amount of time is
        ridiculous. Added on to a solve that would &gt; &gt; otherwise have been
        55 seconds means that 11.91% of the solve is &gt; &gt; fixing parities.
        Fixing parities. That's ridiculous, we shouldn't &gt; &gt; have the
        standard accept that as ok. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can we take anything
        from this and form a different, better strategy? &gt; &gt; Any ideas? My
        only idea so far is to use the COLL case when you have &gt; &gt;
        orientation parity to guess the corner permutation and then compare it
        &gt; &gt; to the edge permutation. I think that is fairly thought
        intensive &gt; &gt; though, so the amount of decision time required
        could actually make &gt; &gt; that strategy take more time fixing
        parities on average. Alright, &gt; &gt; well I'm trying to think of
        something new, anyone else have ideas? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, should
        the centers first method be scrapped entirely in favor of &gt; &gt; a
        cage method? That would allow me flexibility to fix the orientation &gt;
        &gt; parity (the only one!) and also commutators are very easy to come
        up &gt; &gt; with on the fly once you have practice and experience with
        them. So &gt; &gt; with mastery it seems to me that maybe a cage method
        is a better &gt; &gt; choice in the long run than a centers first
        method. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fixing parity sucks, but the fact that the
        edge permutation is &gt; &gt; completely independent of the rest of the
        cube (!) is what makes the &gt; &gt; 4x4 so cool in my opinion :-D &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. If you actually made it to
        the end of this post congratulations. &gt; &gt; I know it's long, but I
        want to come up with a better way to handle &gt; &gt; the 4x4 parities.
        Even if it only saves 0.5 second on average, that's &gt; &gt; still time
        saved. Thanks for your time spent reading. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        If you mean conjugates only of &gt; commutators then you can only solve

        can't solve that scramble. &gt; i.e. U cannot be solved using only

        Hi, The only problem is that the 'pure version' algs are much slower
        than the 'speedsolve version' algs (at least for me). What I do is this:
        If three edges are corrected oriented after F2L, I will flip the last
        edge with a 'speedsolve version' alg. And then use I COLL (except for
        the S and As orientation), so that I will often have a one-look LL after
        this. If I have a two-look LL, then I have bad luck. Of course I also
        use COLL if four edges are corrected oriented after F2L. Michael Fung

        remember it to you because in any cases you only have to do one parity
        &gt; alg. &gt; &gt; When I've solved the F2L I look if there is a Oll
        parity or not. &gt; 1°) If not you do the OLL and then PLL (with
        sometimes the PLL parity) &gt; &gt; 2°) If there is a OLL parity
        problem, you do an OLL so that only one &gt; edge remains flipped(you
        can choose the OLL between several of them, &gt; and choose the shortest
        one). Then you can easily see if there is also &gt; a PLL parity or not,
        and you do the OLL parity alg or the both parity &gt; alg depending on
        the situation. &gt; &gt; So you have zero or one alg to do. I use this
        method (like Yuki) since &gt; a long time and it wokrs pretty well.
        You've almost no break after &gt; little practice. And it seems easier
        than learning COLL or something else. &gt; &gt; What do you think of

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a new LL strategy for centers first people to
        propose and &gt; &gt; &gt; analyze in this post. I am trying to come up
        with new ways to handle &gt; &gt; &gt; the parities on a 4x4, and am
        requesting we put our brains to this &gt; task. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Here is the idea, to only have the double parity (meaning do an alg
        to &gt; &gt; &gt; fix the orientation parity, then do an alg later in
        the solve to fix &gt; &gt; &gt; the permutation parity) 1/8 the time
        instead of 1/4. To do this break &gt; &gt; &gt; the orientation parity
        cases into 2 groups. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 oriented LL edge:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Do either the parity alg or double parity alg leaving a
        50-50 chance &gt; &gt; &gt; to also have PLL parity so to encounter
        double parity here is a 1/8 &gt; &gt; &gt; chance overall. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3 oriented LL edges: &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a COLL alg,
        now recognizing whether the 3x3 edge groups have the &gt; &gt; &gt; same
        parity as the corners is very easy. So if you have double parity &gt;
        &gt; &gt; do the double parity fix pure version, if not do the regular
        parity &gt; &gt; &gt; fix pure version. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So
        that means only 1/8 the time you do 2 algs. Now don't get excited &gt;
        &gt; &gt; yet, this method stinks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here
        are the times for each LL strategy (for me). I did an average of &gt;
        &gt; &gt; each alg. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permutation parity
        fix: &gt; &gt; &gt; 02.34, 02.24, 02.63, (03.28), 02.44, 02.73, 02.68,
        02.23, 02.43, &gt; &gt; &gt; 02.90, 02.79, (02.11) = 2.54 average &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation parity (speedsolve version - double
        parity alg): &gt; &gt; &gt; 04.94, 04.47, 05.34, 04.91, 04.65, 05.03,
        04.42, 04.45, (04.18), &gt; &gt; &gt; (05.52), 04.97, 05.29 = 4.85
        average &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; double parity alg pure version:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 06.23, 07.56, (06.02), 08.10, 06.50, (08.24), 08.02,
        06.71, 07.64, &gt; &gt; &gt; 07.33, 06.42, 06.24 = 7.07 average &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation-parity-only alg pure version &gt;
        &gt; &gt; 06.06, (05.98), 06.79, 06.75, 06.77, 06.38, (08.66), 06.51,
        06.41, &gt; &gt; &gt; 06.66, 07.40, 07.60 = 6.73 average &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; So here is the analysis of the extra time spent on
        average just fixing &gt; &gt; &gt; parities: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Conventional method with 1/4 double parity: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.25*4.85 + 0.25*(2.54+4.85) = 3.70
        seconds on &gt; &gt; &gt; average to fix parities. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; ----- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and with the new 1/8
        double parity method &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 +
        0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) + 0.125* (7.07) + &gt; &gt; &gt;
        0.125*(6.73) = 3.89 seconds on average spent fixing parities. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also solving with the new way I have to do COLL vs.
        OLL 1/8 the time &gt; &gt; &gt; which is probably 1 second longer. So
        1/8 second overall. Making the &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.89 actually 4.02
        seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In order to make this faster than
        the conventional approach I would &gt; &gt; &gt; need to solve the pure
        version double parity alg (x) and the pure &gt; &gt; &gt; version
        orientation-parity-only alg (y) in: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.70 =
        0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) + &gt; &gt; &gt;
        0.125*(x) + 0.125*(y) + 0.125 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.94 =
        0.125*(12.24 + x + y) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 11.28 seconds = x +
        y &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which means the sum of both pure alg
        versions has to be 11.28 seconds &gt; &gt; &gt; or less. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; We can assume that x can be no faster than 4.85 and y can
        be no faster &gt; &gt; &gt; than 5.55 which is my average for the speed
        solve &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation-parity-only alg (again this analysis is
        done with my &gt; &gt; &gt; times, since those are the only available to
        me right now). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 05.82, 05.38, 05.11, 05.82,
        05.54, 05.58, (04.75), (06.07), 05.57, &gt; &gt; &gt; 05.52, 05.74,
        05.39 = 5.55 seconds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So that means there
        is only a give room of about 0.8 or 0.4 seconds &gt; &gt; &gt; per alg.
        Meaning that my pure version double parity alg can only be &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 0.4 slower than my speed solve version and same for the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; orientation-only-parity algs. I don't think that's possible for me.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; So in conclusion again, this method stinks. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But can we somehow reduce the 1/4 chance to do both
        parities and, for &gt; &gt; &gt; me, take 7.39 doing nothing but fixing
        parities. I mean come on that &gt; &gt; &gt; amount of time is
        ridiculous. Added on to a solve that would &gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise have
        been 55 seconds means that 11.91% of the solve is &gt; &gt; &gt; fixing
        parities. Fixing parities. That's ridiculous, we shouldn't &gt; &gt;
        &gt; have the standard accept that as ok. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Can we take anything from this and form a different, better strategy?
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Any ideas? My only idea so far is to use the COLL case
        when you have &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation parity to guess the corner
        permutation and then compare it &gt; &gt; &gt; to the edge permutation.
        I think that is fairly thought intensive &gt; &gt; &gt; though, so the
        amount of decision time required could actually make &gt; &gt; &gt; that
        strategy take more time fixing parities on average. Alright, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; well I'm trying to think of something new, anyone else have ideas?
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, should the centers first method be
        scrapped entirely in favor of &gt; &gt; &gt; a cage method? That would
        allow me flexibility to fix the orientation &gt; &gt; &gt; parity (the
        only one!) and also commutators are very easy to come up &gt; &gt; &gt;
        with on the fly once you have practice and experience with them. So &gt;
        &gt; &gt; with mastery it seems to me that maybe a cage method is a
        better &gt; &gt; &gt; choice in the long run than a centers first
        method. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fixing parity sucks, but the fact
        that the edge permutation is &gt; &gt; &gt; completely independent of
        the rest of the cube (!) is what makes the &gt; &gt; &gt; 4x4 so cool in
        my opinion :-D &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; P.S. If you actually made it to the end of this post
        congratulations. &gt; &gt; &gt; I know it's long, but I want to come up
        with a better way to handle &gt; &gt; &gt; the 4x4 parities. Even if it
        only saves 0.5 second on average, that's &gt; &gt; &gt; still time
        saved. Thanks for your time spent reading. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        This post is rather technical in nature but if you do understand the
        technicalities the &gt; &gt; &gt; details are not difficult. It deals
        with solving sizeable cubes in a canonical way. To &gt; alert &gt; &gt;
        &gt; you, this post is about infinite cubes. The scrambling is assumed
        to be a function &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; some ordinal into the slice
        space (including face turns and inner slices). In particular &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; scramble might not be finite (so it's not part of the
        group generated by the slices, in &gt; &gt; &gt; general). The solution
        described will also often be infinite even if the scramble is not. &gt;
        The &gt; &gt; &gt; aim is to solve the cube in type alpha where the cube
        length is of type 1+alpha+n &gt; (+1) &gt; &gt; &gt; +n+alpha*+1. &gt;

        Hey everyone, I'm sure most of you remember metronome solving. Well I
        recently rediscovered it and have been practicing a little bit with it,
        and I think I am going to include this into my regular practice routine.
        Basically you go to http://www.metronomeonline.com/ and set it to a
        tempo. Then you solve F2L (F2B, 2x2x2, etc..) doing one move on each
        click. You can't go faster or slower, and you cannot pause and miss a
        beat. I've found that I can do 184 smoothly with no delays maybe 1/10
        and I miss one or two beats between the cross and the first pair, but do
        the rest cleanly, maybe half the time. Anyway the reason I posted this
        is that I realized that I rush waaaaaaay too much during the F2L, which
        causes lockups and such. Anyway I just set a 15 second average (not
        common for me, but also not that uncommon) of 15.89 seconds. I tried
        using my pace from doing F2L at 184 rather than my usual pace, and had
        some very nice flowing F2Ls during the average. Try giving it a shot
        (for the first time, or again). I think it helped me to find a better
        pace for my F2L. I thought I had F2L fairly well figured out, but I
        guess a little more work is always a good thing ;-) If you try it let me
        know what you think. I know this is a repeat from a while ago, but I
        think I have personally neglected the usefulness of this training
        technique. Chris

        Here's a metronome average. I had it set to 184 and did just F2L on each
        solve. Basically since the F2L averages about 30 moves I am shooting for
        a 10 second average. So times around 10 seconds were the ones where I
        didn't miss a beat, and times above are ones where I missed beats, or
        had to do stupid moves like U U' in order to keep a tempo. 10.97, 15.54,
        14.43, 16.07, (18.49), 13.41, 13.99, 10.44, 14.21, 12.74, 10.72, (09.73)
        = 13.25 The 10.97, 10.44 9.73 were solves where I didn't miss a beat at
        all, and the 10.72 I did miss a beat after doing Xcross in looking for
        the 2nd pair, but the shorter move count because of the Xcross made it
        still a good solve. Try it out, it's fun to get a solve with no missed
        beats. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, cmhardw

        It depends, if you haven't spotted another pair yet do it as two to give
        yourself time to look. If you've already spotted a pair go for a faster
        solve and do it in one beat. So doing in one beat is preferred, but if
        you need the time to spot a pair do it in 2. Chris --- In

        Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt; The 15.89 was for the whole cube. My LL is very
        consistent in the 6.25-6.50 range though, so I would say that my F2L
        averaged about 9.5- 9.6 for that average. That's why I posted, I think
        the metronome solving helped me find a better, smoother pacing during my
        F2L for that average. I definitely rushed less and kept things more
        consistent it felt like. Chris

        Don't know about such lists, but we could try playing xtris against each
        other. Might suck, though, cause of the transfer delays. But we could

        Maybe I was not very clear, thanks Gilles for your explanation. This
        time I will try to be very clear. My method to solve the 3x3x3 phase on
        the 4x4x4 is: 1) Cross and F2L, 2) OLL, 3) Parity, 4) PLL. I use three
        algs on step 3: OLL parity fixer pure [ r2 B2 U2 l U2 r' U2 r U2 (r) U2
        r U2 l' (r') B2 r2 ], PLL parity fixer pure [ r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 ],

        You still have potentially four algs to complete &gt; &gt; the LL (OLL,

        In the same idea : 1) Cross and 3 pairs 2) Before inserting last pair
        (ex : FR) , watch for oll parity 2a) no parity : insert last pair 2b)
        parity : insert last pair with the wrong corner (UFR, not DFR) and with
        the FR edge flipped. 3) OLL 4) PLL (think about PLL parity if necessary,
        by inversing mentaly 2 opposites edges, and inversing colors of the last
        corner if you come from 2b ) 5) double or simple parity speed algs No

        &gt; &gt; &gt; how many of u solve the f2l like me and from the side....
        if i am &gt; &gt; gonna start learning to do cross on the bottom i might
        as well do &gt; &gt; f2l with cross on the bottom as well.. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; PS: i never knew u hade to be 18 to go on the group chat....
        do u &gt; &gt; guys have another place where we can chat and i can
        recive some &gt; &gt; help.... :P &gt; &gt; like some other speed cubing
        chat room where there are no age &gt; &gt; restrcitions :D...( have any
        ideas of how i can get throught this &gt; &gt; problem with out the use

        Let me first tell something about myself: my best average of 10 is
        slightly under 25 secs, my best single solve without luck is 17.84 and
        my best lucky solve is around 15 secs. Anyway, today I had this awesome
        scramble generated by JNetCube: U' D B2 D' B2 D' F2 D2 B2 F' L' R U' F'
        R' U R' L U B' R2 B F L2 F2, and I managed to solve it in 11.41 secs!
        The reconstructed solve is: double x-cross: L U2 R2 U L2, 3rd pair: U2
        y' R U R' U R U' R', 4th pair: L' U' L, OLL: F R U' R' U' R U R' F',
        PLL: y2 R2 U'R' U' R U R U R U' R. I think this isn't technically a
        lucky solve, but do you find the F2L too lucky, even though I saw the
        double x-cross during the inspection time? I managed to take this on
        video with my digital camera, since I tape most of my solves just in
        case I make a new record. Here is the video:

        Hi all, I'm currently learning the cube, but am a tad miffed by what the
        standard defintion of 3 LLL is. I think I do a 3 LLL, which involves
        making a cross on the LL, then OLL, and then PLL. but after hearing some
        of you guys I'm not sure that this is the best way! Cheers James

        the higher order cubes (i.e. &gt;5x5 ). Chris H., I was looking on your
        site at the big cubes link, and it seems the following link:
        http://www.oinkleburger.com/Cube, is no longer valid. How crestfallen I
        feel at the moment! Do you know where that program has been moved to?
        And is there any chance I can [still] get a hold of it? Thanks, Jon

        Too true Craig, I've just (well around 40mins ago) worked it out, and
        everything's sweet ... I just got a wee bit confused there for a moment.
        5:15-5:30!!! that's amazing. Have you lubed your cube (I've yet to do
        this to any of my cubes)? If so, what type of silicone spray is best?

        are talking about, but, somehow, I &gt; &gt; just don't see counting the
        edge cycles as being very practical - at &gt; &gt; all. So, you're
        right, I DON'T like it ;). There is frankly, too &gt; &gt; much
        opportunity to MISCOUNT/ miss a cycle etc etc. If this TRULY is &gt;
        &gt; the only way to avoid my problem, then the way I treat it might
        seem &gt; &gt; to be the most effective. Craig and your site reference
        &gt; &gt; (www.bigcubes.com) is comprehensive, but I am reluctant to use
        &gt; &gt; algorithms I have not worked out for myself, especially when I
        can't &gt; &gt; REALLY see them speeding up the solve that much.
        Besides, there are &gt; &gt; quite a few of the edge algs to rememeber,
        and at the moment, (since &gt; &gt; I can hardly speed solve the 5x5) I
        just want a more 'elegant' &gt; &gt; method. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the
        way, may I ask what your average is? Mine is quite poor at &gt; &gt; the
        moment (I've had the 5x5 for around a week now). My main failing &gt;
        &gt; is the center solution, which proceeds thusly: solve opposite &gt;
        &gt; faces !! (at the time this was the easiest to do, except the last
        &gt; &gt; pair is a bit 'wishy-washy'...) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again,
        thanks for the reply, and happy cubing to you! &gt; &gt; PS (have you
        even considered blindfolded solving for this puzzle) ;) &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Oinkleburger was a really handy little applet that let you do as big of

        Well "Best Way" is determined by your preference. I love the 3 Look Last
        layer, for now at least. It's efficient enough to get 18 second
        solves(from what I've heard). You're right, it's basically form cross,
        which is 2 moves (there's a 3rd when no edges are flipped but you can do
        that by combining the 2 moves). Then there are 7 OLL and the standard 21
        PLL. I like it because it's a balance between memorization and
        efficiency. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, james

        5:15-5:30 is actually nothing...check out the UWR page for 5x5 speed,
        the top times are around 2 minutes...but I am hoping to one day be

        hes probably the most well known for using it, but I modified it
        slightly...I am planning on switching over to the other method soon...as
        I feel it might wield faster times in the end...you never know
        tho...Yah, I lube all my cubes...5x5s are the worst unlubed...until you
        really break them in...As for the silicone spray, everyone has a

        if I can do that completely but maybe I can describe some of the ideas
        and flesh things out a bit more. An order on a set S is a relation R
        such that for any distinct s,t,u in R not(sRs) (irreflexive condition)
        if sRt and tRu then sRu (transitive condition). (e.g. &lt;) (This is a
        strict order; for a weak order the conditions are sRs (reflexive, if sRt
        and tRs then s=t (symmetric) and if SRt and tRu then sRu (transitive).
        e.g. &lt;=, but we only consider strict orders here.) For instance, in
        the game of rock, paper, scissors. We can define a relation B (beats)
        such that paperBrock, rockBscissors, scissorsBpaper. This is not an
        order. It is irreflexive (we don't have things like paper Bpaper) but
        not transitive - whilst paperB rok and rockBscissors, we don't have
        paperBscissors. The order is total (or linear) if for any s,t either sRt
        or s=t or tRs. (i.e. you can compare any two elements). The usual order
        on the integers is a total order. The order is a well-order if it is a
        total order and any non-empty subset T of S has a least element - that
        is an element m of T such that for each t in T either mRt or m=t. (This
        element is then unique by the conditions above.) An ordinal is a
        particular type of well-ordered set (well-ordered by membership) and any
        well-ordered set is (order-)isomorphic to an ordinal. For instance, any
        subset of the natural numbers is well-ordered and so is the entire set
        of natural numbers but the set of integers is not well-ordered (it has
        no least element). The empty set is an ordinal (with the empty relation
        being the order) and is commonly called 0. If an ordinal has a maximum
        element it is a successor ordinal - otherwise it is a limit ordinal. Any
        ordinal looks like alpha+n where alpha is a limit ordinal and n is a
        finite ordinal. The set of natural numbers is a limit ordinal (the first
        limit ordinal except 0). w={0,1,2,3,...} but there are other subsequent
        ordinals e.g. w+1={0,1,2,3,...,w} and
        w+w={0,1,2,3,...,w,w+1,w+2,...}=w*2 etc. And there are still larger ones
        like w_1 which is far bigger. Ordinals have curious properties. w+1 is
        distinct from w (it has a last element) but 1+w is actually the same
        ordinal. Putting 1 element in front of a list of type w, doesn't change
        the type (they are order-isomorphic) - e.g. {-1,0,1,2,...} is clearly
        the same type as {0,1,2,...} (just map k to k+1). Similarly w*2 is
        bigger than w but 2*w is the same as w. In
        {a_{0,0},a_{0,1},a_{1,0},a_{1,1},...} (which is w copies of 2
        ({a_{i,0},a_{i,1}})) can be mapped to w by taking a_{i,0} to 2i and
        a_{i,1} to 2i+1 and this is an order-isomorphism. It is this property
        that effectively allows us to take an order-type for 1 face-centre and
        put all 6 faces into the same type (as long as such type is a limit and
        this can always be arranged by putting some finite stuff at the start).
        You basically use {a_{0,0},a_{0,1},...,a_{0,5},a_{1,0},...} to transfer
        one to the other (and this puts each centre coordinate into blocks of 6
        (so you have the same coordinate for each centre in turn). Similarly
        n*alpha=alpha for any finite n&gt;0 (n=1,2,3,...). Anyway, for any
        ordinal alpha at least as big as w, the reverse order alpha* is not a
        well- order (because you get a subset {...,3,2,1,0} with no least
        element). So it will turn out that your centres have strips of type
        alpha+n (+1)+(alpha+n)* for some limit alpha (because I effectively made
        an assumption right at the start that I wasn't going to consider
        anything more complicated. The +1 would be the case of an odd cube.
        (Essentially, the logic here is that because you can rotate the face by
        a half turn the end of strip must be the reverse order of the start. I'm
        only looking at getting half way via an ordinal so I must have
        alpha+n(+1)+(alpha+n)*=alpha+n(+1)+n+alpha* (since
        (beta+gamma)*=gamma*+beta* and n*=n). Including the edges the whole face
        has strips of type 1+alpha+n(+1)+n+alpha*+1. Similrly the same type must
        run both vertically and horizontally because you can do quarter turns
        too. Thus I can break a centre into pieces: alpha*alpha n*alpha
        (1*alpha) n*alpha (alpha*)*alpha alpha*n n*n (1*n) n*n (alpha*)*n
        (alpha*1) (n*1) (1*1) (n*1) (alpha*)*1 alpha*n n*n (1*n) n*n (alpha*)*n
        alpha*(alpha*) n*(alpha*) (1*(alpha*)) n*(alpha*) (alpha*)*(alpha*) And
        going across all 6 centres we can put these into types like
        6*(alpha*alpha) 6*(n*alpha) (6*(1*alpha)) 6*(n*alpha) 6*((alpha*)*alpha)
        etc. As indicated earlier n*alpha=alpha so 6*(n*alpha)=6*alpha=alpha.
        Clearly, we can run reverse type on the alpha* to type
        6*((alpha*)*alpha) in type 6*((alpha)*alpha). (This is effectively
        coming in from the corner.) Less obviously, we can type alpha*alpha in
        type alpha and we can even do it in a canonical (methodical etc.) way,
        independent of alpha. So effectively then 6*((alpha)*alpha) can be typed
        in type 6*alpha=alpha. So we get a finite load of chunks that can be
        typed in type alpha or in a finite type (like n*n). Put the finite bunch
        first to get N+k alpha=alpha. (We can also do this methodically -
        putting them in in a particular order - after all, we only have finitely
        many chunks.) So we get to type all the centres in type alpha. We can
        also splice things together (the 4 things that are effectively
        alpha*alpha etc. to ensure that orbits of 24 centres all come in one
        bunch). (An orbit being just the set of positions a particular piece can
        occupy. If you include orientation this is actually of size 24 for every
        piece - 8*3 for corners 12*2 for centre edges, 24*1 for other edges,
        24*1 for non-central centres, 6*4 for centre centres.) The corners can
        be typed in type 8; there are only 8 corners. If the cube is odd, the
        central edges can be typed in type 12. So the two of these can be typed
        in type 20 (finite). This is going to be put at the start of the order.
        The non-central edges can be typed in type 24*n+12*alpha+12*alpha* which
        is easily convertible into type 24*alpha=alpha. Each orbit (of 24
        non-central edges) comes together as a clump. Since 20+2*alpha=alpha, we
        can easily put the entire cube into type alpha. We need to do this
        carefully, to ensure that each orbit of edges comes before all the
        centre pieces running off from those edges. (But there are only finitely
        many edges per orbit, so it is not too difficult.) In fact, one could
        run through this by transfinite induction on the (already ordered in
        type alpha) centres. At stage beta, if the appropriate orbit of edges
        hasn't been put in the order, put them in before centre beta. (This can
        be used to define the well-ordering of the edges!) (We can define the
        order to add the orbit using a lexicographic ordering - there are two
        edge positions per edge to add - two on the edge joining UFR to UFL etc.
        - and each lies nearest to one corner so we can order first by edge and
        then by nearest corner.) This, then effectively types the entire cube
        into type alpha (half a side length, more or less). If the corner
        permutation is odd, start by using D (this will make that permutation
        even - but it will move some centres, edge pieces around - but it will
        always do so in a fixed way and, moreover, in a canonical way that it
        easy to Find the first non-solved position (NB the corners and central
        edges are right up front, but of course, they might already be solved.)
        In the case of corners, central edges, you can orient them in a finite
        number of moves and permute them with 3 cycles in a finite number of
        moves. (3-cycles, because we made the permutation even.) For a
        non-solved corner/edge we just cycle the position in question, the
        position holding the piece in question and the least other remaining
        position. In this way we can methodically solve the corners and edges.
        Then you simply use transfinite induction as follows. If the cube is not
        yet solved, there is a least unsolved position (because we have well-
        ordered the positions in type alpha and so the set of unsolved positions
        is a non-empty subset of a well-ordered set and hence has a least
        element). Given the next unsolved position, if it is a centre, we must
        already have solved all the edges that can be reached by running to the
        edge from the centre (in a slice) plus all the edges in the orbit of
        such (by way of setting up the order in that way). This implies that the
        orbit of the centre in question has at least 3 unsolved centres and we
        can 3-cycle the unsolved centre in the position we want to solve, the
        centre that goes into that position and the least other unsolved centre.
        Again this takes a finite number of moves. If on the other hand it is an
        edge, then gain if possible use a 3-cycle described in the same way.
        Otherwise, there will be only two unsolved edges. In this case we slice
        the position in question - this disturbs 4 edges (including the one in
        question and some already solved ones) - in the direction that takes it
        to the lesser edge position (for definiteness). It also permutes several
        centres (who appear later in the solving stage) doing so in a canonical
        way (that makes it easier to remember where each has mapped to). In this
        event we go back and solve those edges in that orbit again, in order
        (now using only 3-cycles). At most this will take 2 3-cycles (we could
        be left with 1 3-cycle, a double transposition or 1 5-cycle) and so
        again solving the edge (plus correcting any prior disturbed edges) takes
        only a finite number of moves. All these 3-cycles can be done similarly
        to a 5x5x5 and have definite upper lengths, and there are only a finite
        number (of equivalence classes) of algorithms we need, so each stage
        will take at most M turns (for some M). That means the entire solution
        can be effected in type M*alpha=alpha. &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        I've just downloaded and am now currently watching the video. To Andy:
        You obviously put a lot of effort into editing this all together. Thanks
        for making this available to all of us! To everyone who offered advice
        on how to get the video: Thanks! I had never used Torrent or Azureus
        before so I didn't know what I was doing and wouldn't have been able to
        see it without the tips. To all cubers: Watching this video made me feel
        quite reminiscent. :) It was so great seeing everyone again at Worlds
        and also meeting some new faces. Watching the video also makes me think
        about all the interesting places I've been to thanks to speedcubing.
        'Outsiders' might (and do!!) say 'you guys need to get a life and get
        out more', but ironically, I think speedcubing does mean we 'get out
        more'. Whenever I've travelled anywhere for a cubing event, I usually
        stay for a little bit of time either before/after the competition and do
        some sightseeing, so I do see more of the city than just the competition
        venue. Also, there are places that I've visited for cubing events that I
        would not yet have been to otherwise. What about everyone else? Are
        there new cities/countries that you have visited thanks to speedcubing?
        :) Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com On Fri, 03 Feb 2006 13:59:13

        After doing that scramble I got a 31.83s solve, my second attempt was a
        28.33(kinda a new PB -but it was the second solve on the same
        scramble,don't really count) My 2x2x3 block was 5 moves [x L F2 L2 R2

        &gt; It could be that you need the client azureus. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was something with when you have
        made a torrent with &gt; &gt; &gt; azureus &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
        only works with the client azureus. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; To everyone who offered advice on how to get the video:
        Thanks! I had &gt; never used Torrent or Azureus before so I didn't know
        what I was doing &gt; and wouldn't have been able to see it without the
        tips. &gt; &gt; To all cubers: Watching this video made me feel quite
        reminiscent. :) &gt; It &gt; was so great seeing everyone again at
        Worlds and also meeting some new &gt; faces. &gt; &gt; Watching the
        video also makes me think about all the interesting places &gt; I've
        been to thanks to speedcubing. 'Outsiders' might (and do!!) say &gt;
        'you guys need to get a life and get out more', but ironically, I think
        &gt; speedcubing does mean we 'get out more'. Whenever I've travelled
        &gt; anywhere for a cubing event, I usually stay for a little bit of
        time &gt; either before/after the competition and do some sightseeing,
        so I do &gt; see &gt; more of the city than just the competition venue.
        Also, there are &gt; places &gt; that I've visited for cubing events
        that I would not yet have been to &gt; otherwise. &gt; &gt; What about
        everyone else? Are there new cities/countries that you have &gt; visited

        without luck is &gt; 17.84 &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; my best lucky
        solve is around 15 secs. Anyway, today I had this &gt; &gt; awesome &gt;

        L' &gt; R &gt; &gt; U' F' &gt; &gt; &gt; R' U R' L U B' R2 B F L2 F2,

        reconstructed solve is: double x-cross: L U2 R2 U L2, 3rd &gt; &gt;

        lucky solve, but do you find the F2L too lucky, even though I &gt; saw
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; double x-cross during the inspection time?
        I managed to take &gt; this &gt; &gt; on &gt; &gt; &gt; video with my
        digital camera, since I tape most of my solves &gt; just &gt; &gt; in

        I've had several people tell me about 'Leyan Lo' and how he can't
        actually solve the cube. Letterman always introduces him as the real
        thing and never says otherwise, it makes sense that people would believe
        him. People who don't know anything about cubing just assume what
        Letterman is saying is accurate. I think Letterman is the real idiot.

        I saw the clip too and thought it was pretty stupid. I didn't think it
        was the least bit funny either. And when watching the guy, he OBVIOUSLY
        had no idea what he was doing (well, it was obvious to all of us
        anyway!). He'd do one twist, then undo it, then repeat several times,
        then find another move, then undo it, then repeat that one several
        times. It was SO lame. It would have looked less unrealistic if he'd
        just randomly scrambled the cube! Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com

        the ridiculous fat white guy who &gt; claimed to be "Leyan Lo" (an
        interesting name for a white guy, i &gt; would say) would recognize that
        it was an amusing spoof... is it &gt; possible for a person who can
        solve the cube in 11.13 seconds &gt; (whether it had a PLL skip or not
        :) to be "unable" to solve the &gt; cube? &gt; &gt; lol &gt; &gt; I was
        talking to some people today, when they saw me cubing, &gt; and they
        were asking me if I knew about this guy who just set &gt; the world
        record. I did know. Then they said "he hasn't been &gt; able to do it on
        TV though". And I explained to them that &gt; they're right, b/c from
        what I've heard he got an easy scramble, &gt; usually it takes him like
        15 seconds.. and they're like "no he &gt; hasn't been able to do it at
        all yet". &gt; &gt; Then I realized that they actually thought the spoof
        was real. &gt; &gt; Wow. &gt; &gt; -David &gt; &gt;

        First let me say that i love the show, and although I have *never*
        really watched TV before, I have now seen every episode of this.
        However.. Perhaps other people have noticed some of the same things,
        maybe everyone will disagree with me... I don't know. But, here are a
        few of my observations which suggest (to me) that the show is (to some
        degree) scripted/rigged/NOT-real. 1) The "Asides" with the camera --
        several times per episode, there will be a clip of one of the
        contestants alone in a room just talking to the camera. In these
        sessions, they have said things about how they don't like their partner,
        or they hate another contestant, etc. If the show were for real, nobody
        would say anything about another person that they didn't want the other
        person to know, beacuse the other person would find out about it. The
        only way to get around this is if everyone was completely isolated from
        the outside world, which obviously isn't true since, for example, Tyson
        was able to respond to his email, and (if i remember correctly) attend
        the Caltech cubing tournament which was during the BATG season. 2) Too
        dumb -- perhaps I have a skewed perspective, but I don't think that, for
        example, ANYBODY in the US doesn't know who John Kerry is. Maybe I'm
        completely wrong here, but I found that to be entirely too unrealistic.
        The same goes for plenty of other questions, etc. Remember that some of
        the girls have attended college. Perhaps it's not the ivy league, but
        anyone college student would know way more than some of those girls are
        portrayed as knowing. The same goes for some of the things the guys do.
        Example: If trying to impress females with your decorating abilities,
        would anyone actually write "in blood" on the wall? ehh not likely. 3)
        Chris incident -- kinda the same as my first reason, but if the show was
        for real, would anyone actually say "No I don't like my beauty".
        Furthremore, he lies about it.. he tells her he was trying to flatter
        the other girl.. BUT, then he tells the camera in private that he just
        "forgot about the hidden camera" or whatever. If the show was for real,
        I don't think he would have said what he said, and I don't think he
        would have gone out and admitted to lying about it to Tristin. 4)
        Camerawork/timing etc -- All of the timing etc is perfect, strange for a
        reality show. Example: on the first episode (or the second one,
        whcihever it was) when they did the competition to "get to change around
        any 2 teams"... They had everyone on the stairs as Chris was going to
        announce who they had chosen. "The first team that we picked... was us"
        &lt;Commercial break right away&gt;. Every commercial break is preceded
        by a dramatic moment, and there are the same number of dramatic moments
        in each episode, and they occur in regular increments. Perhaps this is
        stupid, beacuse I suppose they obviously film a lot more than actually
        gets onto the show, and consequently perfect timing etc could be
        achieved by good editing, but to me it still seems like everyhting works
        out too perfectly in this respect. 5) Nobody would ever be as big an
        asshole as Chris was. Seriously. It makes the show more exciting when
        there's a badguy.. how would the people who screened the show know that
        he would end up being such a loser? These are just a few of the things I
        noticed. I'm sure when I watch the show this week I'll be reminded of
        other things. I'm sure you will too, if you look for them. Anyways,
        perhaps I'm wrong, but it just seems to me that it's not real. Or, maybe
        i'm right and i'm the last person to know this? Sorry for rambling on
        for so long.. lol David

        Well, 1) This show was filmed waaaaay before you are actually seeing it
        on TV. It is not live and has undergone significant editing before it
        has aired on your television. The individual interviews are just that,
        individual, and anything said in there is not played back to the other
        members in the house. This is typical of a reality show. People's
        comments will remain private unless those people decide to tell other
        members in the house. 2) There are many stupid people in the world and
        I'm sure the casting process involved finding some not-as-bright girls
        to put on the show. The guys are suppose to be smart and the girls are
        suppose to be beautiful... 3) I don't find it hard to believe at all.
        Chris is a jerk and that's that. 4) When you have a camera on you for
        almost 24 hours a day, you'd be surprised how much footage can be
        recorded. Just like any show, the footage will be edited and formatted
        for a 30-60 minute block of time for tv episodes. Editing is easy and
        necessary. Moments of climax are always placed before a commercial break
        so that viewers will continue to watch the show. 5) From what I
        understand, there was a fairly strong interview process. Chris would
        obviously be a good guy to have on the show because he makes it
        interesting and creates 'drama'. People like to watch that stuff.
        Obviosiosly any edited show will not reflect exactly what happened...
        but I highly doubt any of the people's reactions or comments are
        scripted. -Chris On 2/5/06, David Pritts &lt;ladartfrog@...&gt; wrote:

        he lies about it.. he tells her he was trying to flatter the &gt; other
        girl.. BUT, then he tells the camera in private that he just "forgot
        &gt; about the hidden camera" or whatever. If the show was for real, I
        don't &gt; think he would have said what he said, and I don't think he
        would have gone &gt; out and admitted to lying about it to Tristin. &gt;
        &gt; 4) Camerawork/timing etc -- All of the timing etc is perfect,
        strange &gt; for a reality show. Example: on the first episode (or the
        second one, &gt; whcihever it was) when they did the competition to "get
        to change around any &gt; 2 teams"... They had everyone on the stairs as
        Chris was going to announce &gt; who they had chosen. "The first team
        that we picked... was us" &lt;Commercial &gt; break right away&gt;.
        Every commercial break is preceded by a dramatic moment, &gt; and there
        are the same number of dramatic moments in each episode, and they &gt;
        occur in regular increments. Perhaps this is stupid, beacuse I suppose
        they &gt; obviously film a lot more than actually gets onto the show,
        and consequently &gt; perfect timing etc could be achieved by good
        editing, but to me it still &gt; seems like everyhting works out too
        perfectly in this respect. &gt; &gt; 5) Nobody would ever be as big an
        asshole as Chris was. Seriously. It &gt; makes the show more exciting
        when there's a badguy.. how would the people &gt; who screened the show
        know that he would end up being such a loser? &gt; &gt; These are just a
        few of the things I noticed. I'm sure when I watch the &gt; show this
        week I'll be reminded of other things. I'm sure you will too, if &gt;
        you look for them. &gt; &gt; Anyways, perhaps I'm wrong, but it just
        seems to me that it's not real. &gt; Or, maybe i'm right and i'm the
        last person to know this? &gt; &gt; Sorry for rambling on for so long..

        Leyan has been getting e-mail from random people who don't realize that

        watching TV weren't that stupid, but apparently something as obvious as
        that to us is completely missed by the general public. If we could scare
        them somehow by threatening to sue, it would be a shot in the dark, but
        maybe they could get some compensation from it? I think suing them would
        cost more, and probably wouldn't fly because technically, I don't think

        be "unable" to solve the &gt;&gt; cube? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lol &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; I was talking to some people today, when they saw me cubing,
        &gt;&gt; and they were asking me if I knew about this guy who just set
        &gt;&gt; the world record. I did know. Then they said "he hasn't been
        &gt;&gt; able to do it on TV though". And I explained to them that
        &gt;&gt; they're right, b/c from what I've heard he got an easy
        scramble, &gt;&gt; usually it takes him like 15 seconds.. and they're
        like "no he &gt;&gt; hasn't been able to do it at all yet". &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; Then I realized that they actually thought the spoof was real.

        Thanks Chris, Yeah... I don't really want to respond to this one in
        public. I don't want some private investigator named Simone deSimone
        coming up behind me and capping a bullet in my head. I know Brandon
        would be scared too. Well, not really, but still... I'll just say that
        everything was honest, and I'm actually kind of tired of answering this
        question. You might as well go and doubt the authenticity of my
        blindfold solves while you're at it, but at the end of the day, I know I
        can solve the cube blindfolded, and I know I can do it in under
        2-minutes. The show is honest, it was not rigged. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        you are actually seeing it on &gt; TV. It &gt; is not live and has
        undergone significant editing before it has aired &gt; on &gt; your
        television. The individual interviews are just that, individual, &gt;
        and &gt; anything said in there is not played back to the other members
        in the &gt; house. &gt; This is typical of a reality show. People's
        comments will remain &gt; private &gt; unless those people decide to
        tell other members in the house. &gt; &gt; 2) There are many stupid
        people in the world and I'm sure the casting &gt; process involved
        finding some not-as-bright girls to put on the show. &gt; The &gt; guys
        are suppose to be smart and the girls are suppose to be &gt;
        beautiful... &gt; &gt; 3) I don't find it hard to believe at all. Chris
        is a jerk and that's &gt; that. &gt; &gt; 4) When you have a camera on
        you for almost 24 hours a day, you'd be &gt; surprised how much footage
        can be recorded. Just like any show, the &gt; footage &gt; will be
        edited and formatted for a 30-60 minute block of time for tv &gt;
        episodes. Editing is easy and necessary. Moments of climax are always
        &gt; placed &gt; before a commercial break so that viewers will continue
        to watch the &gt; show. &gt; &gt; 5) From what I understand, there was a
        fairly strong interview process. &gt; Chris would obviously be a good
        guy to have on the show because he &gt; makes it &gt; interesting and
        creates 'drama'. People like to watch that stuff. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Obviosiosly any edited show will not reflect exactly what happened...
        &gt; but I &gt; highly doubt any of the people's reactions or comments
        are scripted. &gt; &gt; &gt; -Chris &gt; &gt; On 2/5/06, David Pritts
        &lt;ladartfrog@...&gt; wrote: &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; First let me say that i
        love the show, and although I have *never* &gt;&gt; really &gt;&gt;
        watched TV before, I have now seen every episode of this. However..
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps other people have noticed some of the same
        things, maybe &gt;&gt; everyone will disagree with me... I don't know.
        But, here are a few &gt;&gt; of my &gt;&gt; observations which suggest
        (to me) that the show is (to some degree) &gt;&gt;
        scripted/rigged/NOT-real. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) The "Asides" with the
        camera -- several times per episode, there &gt;&gt; will &gt;&gt; be a
        clip of one of the contestants alone in a room just talking to &gt;&gt;
        the &gt;&gt; camera. In these sessions, they have said things about how
        they don't &gt;&gt; like &gt;&gt; their partner, or they hate another
        contestant, etc. If the show were &gt;&gt; for &gt;&gt; real, nobody
        would say anything about another person that they didn't &gt;&gt; want
        &gt;&gt; the other person to know, beacuse the other person would find
        out &gt;&gt; about it. &gt;&gt; The only way to get around this is if
        everyone was completely &gt;&gt; isolated from &gt;&gt; the outside
        world, which obviously isn't true since, for example, &gt;&gt; Tyson was
        &gt;&gt; able to respond to his email, and (if i remember correctly)
        attend the &gt;&gt; Caltech cubing tournament which was during the BATG
        season. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) Too dumb -- perhaps I have a skewed
        perspective, but I don't &gt;&gt; think &gt;&gt; that, for example,
        ANYBODY in the US doesn't know who John Kerry is. &gt;&gt; Maybe
        &gt;&gt; I'm completely wrong here, but I found that to be entirely too
        &gt;&gt; unrealistic. &gt;&gt; The same goes for plenty of other
        questions, etc. Remember that some &gt;&gt; of the &gt;&gt; girls have
        attended college. Perhaps it's not the ivy league, but &gt;&gt; anyone
        &gt;&gt; college student would know way more than some of those girls
        are &gt;&gt; portrayed &gt;&gt; as knowing. The same goes for some of
        the things the guys do. &gt;&gt; Example: If &gt;&gt; trying to impress
        females with your decorating abilities, would anyone &gt;&gt; actually
        write "in blood" on the wall? ehh not likely. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) Chris
        incident -- kinda the same as my first reason, but if the &gt;&gt; show
        &gt;&gt; was for real, would anyone actually say "No I don't like my
        beauty". &gt;&gt; Furthremore, he lies about it.. he tells her he was
        trying to flatter &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; other girl.. BUT, then he tells
        the camera in private that he just &gt;&gt; "forgot &gt;&gt; about the
        hidden camera" or whatever. If the show was for real, I &gt;&gt; don't
        &gt;&gt; think he would have said what he said, and I don't think he
        would &gt;&gt; have gone &gt;&gt; out and admitted to lying about it to
        Tristin. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 4) Camerawork/timing etc -- All of the timing
        etc is perfect, &gt;&gt; strange &gt;&gt; for a reality show. Example:
        on the first episode (or the second one, &gt;&gt; whcihever it was) when
        they did the competition to "get to change &gt;&gt; around any &gt;&gt;
        2 teams"... They had everyone on the stairs as Chris was going to
        &gt;&gt; announce &gt;&gt; who they had chosen. "The first team that we
        picked... was us" &gt;&gt; &lt;Commercial &gt;&gt; break right away&gt;.
        Every commercial break is preceded by a dramatic &gt;&gt; moment,
        &gt;&gt; and there are the same number of dramatic moments in each
        episode, &gt;&gt; and they &gt;&gt; occur in regular increments. Perhaps
        this is stupid, beacuse I &gt;&gt; suppose they &gt;&gt; obviously film
        a lot more than actually gets onto the show, and &gt;&gt; consequently
        &gt;&gt; perfect timing etc could be achieved by good editing, but to me
        it &gt;&gt; still &gt;&gt; seems like everyhting works out too perfectly
        in this respect. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 5) Nobody would ever be as big an
        asshole as Chris was. Seriously. &gt;&gt; It &gt;&gt; makes the show
        more exciting when there's a badguy.. how would the &gt;&gt; people
        &gt;&gt; who screened the show know that he would end up being such a
        loser? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; These are just a few of the things I noticed.
        I'm sure when I watch &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; show this week I'll be
        reminded of other things. I'm sure you will &gt;&gt; too, if &gt;&gt;
        you look for them. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyways, perhaps I'm wrong, but it
        just seems to me that it's not &gt;&gt; real. &gt;&gt; Or, maybe i'm
        right and i'm the last person to know this? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry for
        rambling on for so long.. lol &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; David &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

        I did not know that all of the filming happened a long time ago. This
        explains a lot. And I guess you're right, I wouldn't have thought anyone
        was stupid enough to think that Leyan Lo is a fat white guy who can't
        solve a barely scrambled cube... hmm. Thanks. David Tyson Mao

        I'll just say that everything was honest, and I'm actually kind of tired
        of answering this question. You might as well go and doubt the
        authenticity of my blindfold solves while you're at it, but at the end
        of the day, I know I can solve the cube blindfolded, and I know I can do
        it in under 2-minutes. The show is honest, it was not rigged. Tyson Mao

        before you are actually seeing it on &gt; TV. It &gt; is not live and
        has undergone significant editing before it has aired &gt; on &gt; your
        television. The individual interviews are just that, individual, &gt;
        and &gt; anything said in there is not played back to the other members
        in the &gt; house. &gt; This is typical of a reality show. People's
        comments will remain &gt; private &gt; unless those people decide to
        tell other members in the house. &gt; &gt; 2) There are many stupid
        people in the world and I'm sure the casting &gt; process involved
        finding some not-as-bright girls to put on the show. &gt; The &gt; guys
        are suppose to be smart and the girls are suppose to be &gt;
        beautiful... &gt; &gt; 3) I don't find it hard to believe at all. Chris
        is a jerk and that's &gt; that. &gt; &gt; 4) When you have a camera on
        you for almost 24 hours a day, you'd be &gt; surprised how much footage
        can be recorded. Just like any show, the &gt; footage &gt; will be
        edited and formatted for a 30-60 minute block of time for tv &gt;
        episodes. Editing is easy and necessary. Moments of climax are always
        &gt; placed &gt; before a commercial break so that viewers will continue
        to watch the &gt; show. &gt; &gt; 5) From what I understand, there was a
        fairly strong interview process. &gt; Chris would obviously be a good
        guy to have on the show because he &gt; makes it &gt; interesting and
        creates 'drama'. People like to watch that stuff. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Obviosiosly any edited show will not reflect exactly what happened...
        &gt; but I &gt; highly doubt any of the people's reactions or comments
        are scripted. &gt; &gt; &gt; -Chris &gt; &gt; On 2/5/06, David Pritts

        love the show, and although I have *never* &gt;&gt; really &gt;&gt;
        watched TV before, I have now seen every episode of this. However..
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps other people have noticed some of the same
        things, maybe &gt;&gt; everyone will disagree with me... I don't know.
        But, here are a few &gt;&gt; of my &gt;&gt; observations which suggest
        (to me) that the show is (to some degree) &gt;&gt;
        scripted/rigged/NOT-real. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) The "Asides" with the
        camera -- several times per episode, there &gt;&gt; will &gt;&gt; be a
        clip of one of the contestants alone in a room just talking to &gt;&gt;
        the &gt;&gt; camera. In these sessions, they have said things about how
        they don't &gt;&gt; like &gt;&gt; their partner, or they hate another
        contestant, etc. If the show were &gt;&gt; for &gt;&gt; real, nobody
        would say anything about another person that they didn't &gt;&gt; want
        &gt;&gt; the other person to know, beacuse the other person would find
        out &gt;&gt; about it. &gt;&gt; The only way to get around this is if
        everyone was completely &gt;&gt; isolated from &gt;&gt; the outside
        world, which obviously isn't true since, for example, &gt;&gt; Tyson was
        &gt;&gt; able to respond to his email, and (if i remember correctly)
        attend the &gt;&gt; Caltech cubing tournament which was during the BATG
        season. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) Too dumb -- perhaps I have a skewed
        perspective, but I don't &gt;&gt; think &gt;&gt; that, for example,
        ANYBODY in the US doesn't know who John Kerry is. &gt;&gt; Maybe
        &gt;&gt; I'm completely wrong here, but I found that to be entirely too
        &gt;&gt; unrealistic. &gt;&gt; The same goes for plenty of other
        questions, etc. Remember that some &gt;&gt; of the &gt;&gt; girls have
        attended college. Perhaps it's not the ivy league, but &gt;&gt; anyone
        &gt;&gt; college student would know way more than some of those girls
        are &gt;&gt; portrayed &gt;&gt; as knowing. The same goes for some of
        the things the guys do. &gt;&gt; Example: If &gt;&gt; trying to impress
        females with your decorating abilities, would anyone &gt;&gt; actually
        write "in blood" on the wall? ehh not likely. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) Chris
        incident -- kinda the same as my first reason, but if the &gt;&gt; show
        &gt;&gt; was for real, would anyone actually say "No I don't like my
        beauty". &gt;&gt; Furthremore, he lies about it.. he tells her he was
        trying to flatter &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; other girl.. BUT, then he tells
        the camera in private that he just &gt;&gt; "forgot &gt;&gt; about the
        hidden camera" or whatever. If the show was for real, I &gt;&gt; don't
        &gt;&gt; think he would have said what he said, and I don't think he
        would &gt;&gt; have gone &gt;&gt; out and admitted to lying about it to
        Tristin. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 4) Camerawork/timing etc -- All of the timing
        etc is perfect, &gt;&gt; strange &gt;&gt; for a reality show. Example:
        on the first episode (or the second one, &gt;&gt; whcihever it was) when
        they did the competition to "get to change &gt;&gt; around any &gt;&gt;
        2 teams"... They had everyone on the stairs as Chris was going to
        &gt;&gt; announce &gt;&gt; who they had chosen. "The first team that we
        picked... was us" &gt;&gt; &lt;Commercial &gt;&gt; break right away&gt;.
        Every commercial break is preceded by a dramatic &gt;&gt; moment,
        &gt;&gt; and there are the same number of dramatic moments in each
        episode, &gt;&gt; and they &gt;&gt; occur in regular increments. Perhaps
        this is stupid, beacuse I &gt;&gt; suppose they &gt;&gt; obviously film
        a lot more than actually gets onto the show, and &gt;&gt; consequently
        &gt;&gt; perfect timing etc could be achieved by good editing, but to me
        it &gt;&gt; still &gt;&gt; seems like everyhting works out too perfectly
        in this respect. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 5) Nobody would ever be as big an
        asshole as Chris was. Seriously. &gt;&gt; It &gt;&gt; makes the show
        more exciting when there's a badguy.. how would the &gt;&gt; people
        &gt;&gt; who screened the show know that he would end up being such a
        loser? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; These are just a few of the things I noticed.
        I'm sure when I watch &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; show this week I'll be
        reminded of other things. I'm sure you will &gt;&gt; too, if &gt;&gt;
        you look for them. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyways, perhaps I'm wrong, but it
        just seems to me that it's not &gt;&gt; real. &gt;&gt; Or, maybe i'm
        right and i'm the last person to know this? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry for
        rambling on for so long.. lol &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; David &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

        Maybe we should have The Talk... Reality shows are heavily edited. They
        have hundreds of hours of footage for each episode that they cut down to
        45 minutes. The goal of the editing is not to report as truthfully as
        possible what happened that day, but to make an as entertaining as
        possible show. This includes directly lying about events, as well as
        implying events and motivations that didn't exist. The contestants
        typically sign away any rights to complain about things like this when
        they take the job. However, they are typically not faked in a scripted
        way. That's much too hard to to, and you need real talented actors and
        scriptwriters to make that work. Part of the motivation for all the
        "reality" TV getting shown is that it's very expensive to hire that
        level of acting and writing talent. &gt; 1) The "Asides" with the camera
        This is very standard. Everyone knows these confessions could end up in
        the final show. But that's long after they've left the mansion. &gt;
        &gt; The only way to get around this is if everyone was completely &gt;
        isolated from the outside world, which obviously isn't true since, &gt;
        for example, Tyson was able to respond to his email, and (if i &gt;
        remember correctly) attend the Caltech cubing tournament which was &gt;
        during the BATG season. The way they did this was they recorded it all
        in October. &gt; 2) Too dumb -- perhaps I have a skewed perspective, but
        I don't &gt; think that, for example, ANYBODY in the US doesn't know who
        John &gt; Kerry is. Yes, you do need to get out more. These people are
        very much out there. It's not so much an issue of being dumb (though
        that helps) as of not being interested. You know, a lot of people would
        take your questions here and wonder if anyone could really be that
        uninformed about reality TV to not know it was all prerecorded. The
        reason you didn't know is not that you're stupid, you just weren't
        keeping up with this field. &gt; 4) Camerawork/timing etc -- All of the
        timing etc is perfect, &gt; strange for a reality show. Well, it's
        edited over several months by pros. Of course it's gonna look good. &gt;
        5) Nobody would ever be as big an asshole as Chris was. &gt; Seriously.
        It makes the show more exciting when there's a badguy.. &gt; how would
        the people who screened the show know that he would end &gt; up being
        such a loser? They make him into an asshole through editing. Maybe he
        really is that big a jerk, but if not, they can very easily make him
        into one through selective editing. It's standard reality show fare, you
        need to give the audience someone to root for and against. - - - - - - -

        Hello, What type of pyraminx is it ? Gilles. teemu_tiinanen a ï¿½crit :
        &gt; My problem is that after the first pop with my Pyraminx one of the
        &gt; bearings fell off and it didn't stay on its place anymore. After
        that &gt; my Pyraminx has been extremely unstable and the pieces pop
        constantly &gt; making it impossible to speedsolve. So I was wondering,
        does anyone &gt; have any tips for repairing my Pyraminx and possibly
        making it smooth &gt; for speedsolving? I really wouldn't like to buy a
        new one... &gt; &gt; Thanks beforehand &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        hi, hope this isnt a dumb question, but I am hoping you can help settle
        an argument between a friend and I. His method of solving the cube is to
        study it for ~2 minutes, and then solve in about 40 seconds. I dont know
        what method he uses. My method of solving the cube is to pick the cube
        up and just start solving immediately, it takes me about 1 min 30
        seconds to solve using a pretty straightforward method from a 20 year
        old Penguin paperback book. My argument is, that it takes him about 2
        mins 40 to solve the cube, whereas it takes me about 1 min 30, but he
        argues he is the fastest, discounting the studying time and claiming it
        takes him only 40 seconds. In any situation though, whenever we are both
        simultaneously passed a cube neither of us has seen before, I always
        solve before he has even started twisting. so who is fastest?

        ok, so the official examination time is about 15 seconds. so you should
        actually be studying the cube 15 seconds before you start solving. but
        you have a raw speed of about 1 min 30 right? right. your friend has 15
        seconds to study the cube as well. if he does not start after that, then
        its his problem. if he solves the cube in 40 secs after looking at the
        cube for 2 mins, then his real score is actually 2 mins 40 secs minus 15
        secs which is 2 mins and 25 secs. you are obviously faster. in a

        Well, considering the 15 second inspection time, that you don't use, but
        he (technically) does, so he takes...2 mins 25 seconds, meaning you

        Look up the definition of slander. It is something that people sue for
        all the time. However, I don't know how likely you are to be successful,
        especially since it would seem that slander is largely how comedians
        make a living. With something as targeted as what he's done (obviously
        discrediting a specific individual), though, you may have a better
        chance. Of course, you are also talking about going up against
        someone/something with significant financial backing - good luck!
        Regardless, in the end, any action against Letterman would probably just
        be fuel for him to use against you (Leyan). Perhaps a better approach
        would be to try to get Leyan (the real one) some air time - perhaps even
        on Letterman's show. Sure, he's not likely to repeat his 11 second
        performance, but at least he could repair some of the damage done by the
        negative publicity provided by Letterman. - Grant --- Tyson Mao wrote:

        wow, thanks for the quick answers guys. Im not sure if my amateur method
        would benefit from 15 seconds study time, Im not good enough to think
        moves in advance. I just pick it up and start making the top layer
        immediately, without giving much thought as to what i'll be doing after
        that bit is done :) I'll try and find out a bit more about what hes
        doing, he just looks at it while holding his fingers on the cube in
        fixed locations while looking all around the cube, then he'll move his
        fingers and look for another 5 seconds, and so on, until eventually he
        just starts twisting.

        They could do things like that. Read this article and add
        "Frankenbiting" to your vocabulary: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/
        article/0,9171,1154194,00.html Though it would be hard to fake that
        cheering footage. It had to be taken at some time during the
        elimination. And you're right, that's bad sportsmanship. Bad winners are
        even worse than bad losers. I don't doubt Chris has some rough edges to
        his personality, but I also don't doubt that the editors work hard to
        pick out the few minutes of footage each day that will make him look the
        worst. Or to be more precise, will make their show the most interesting.
        Or put it this way. They could just as easily have put together a show
        where we would never be having a conversation about how big a jerk he
        may be. /Lars On Feb 5, 2006, at 14:10, Stefan Pochmann wrote: &gt; ---

        in his mouth, I kinda &gt;&gt; disagree. Not just because of how he
        "interviewed" the other teams in &gt;&gt; the first episode. But also
        because of his behaviour watching his &gt;&gt; girl &gt;&gt; in the
        elimination room when Tyson was thrown out. He partied with &gt;&gt;
        every correct answer of his girl and even said "sweet" when Tyson's
        &gt;&gt; girl got something wrong. You may do that in private. But not
        if &gt;&gt; Tyson &gt;&gt; is sitting right next to you. Unless you're a
        jerk. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Stefan &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, I just realized
        the possibility that Chris actually said "sweet" &gt; at another point
        of time, not as reaction to Thais' wrong answer. &gt; Would they do this
        type of editing? At least they make it look like &gt; it's running

        &gt; &gt; You'll get there...I should probably learn full PLL, I'm
        pretty sure &gt; &gt; that solve was 3LLL...which is quite common for me
        now...I've been off &gt; &gt; school for a few days and I've been
        practicing like mad with my new &gt; &gt; cubes...hovering around 20,

        This is exciting news! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm so *almost*

        Sorry, i am a newbie. I've just brought a rubik cube 3x3, but it is so
        tight I've seen some speedcubing video and the cubes they use are all
        very loose and can be turned extremely smoothly. What's wrong with my
        rubik?? Surely my rubik is the official one, not those low quality $1 or
        $2 rubiks. Do i need to add lubricant or do other things to make it turn
        smoothly??

        Hi, I am the lucky new owner of a couple original 1981 cubes in apparent
        mint condition. From reading around I understand they could make a good
        speedcubes.. I'm surprised by this since they are really stiff. Do I
        need to consider replacing any parts (eg. the kernel) or is it just the
        case that it needs many hours working in and lubing. I'd rather not
        replace anything unless I have to to keep it original but if I had to
        then where should I go to get replacement parts for this type of cube.
        Anyone had trouble removing centre caps from this age of cube? I
        accidentally damaged one of the centre caps to get at the screws. It
        seems that the intervening years welded the cap on somewhat. Any tips
        for this. Finally, I notice that the inside of the centre cubies are
        flat, not curved like the DIY cubes are. Am I right in thinking that
        flat ones are more prone to popping (hence the design change) because
        that certainly seems to be the case on this cube. Having slightly
        loosened the tension and lubricated the first of the cubes It still
        doesn't move that easily and it pops all the time. It seems my only
        option is to tighten the tension again to stop the popping but that
        means a stiff cube again. Cheers, Matt

        If you've bought your cube from a shop then it is not the same as the
        cubes that speedcubers use - even if it is Rubik's. Apparently only one
        in ten shop-bought cubesare suitable for speedcubing. The best bet is to
        buy the DIY black cubes directly from the Rubik's website. I've only got
        the blank 3x3 from rubiks that you have to sticker yourself at the mo,
        but even that is about twenty times better than my shop bought cube.
        Also, you can apparently get RSI from trying speedcube on a bad cube, so
        be careful. superkenkan &lt;superkenkan@...&gt; wrote: Sorry, i am a

        Rubiks.com sells assembly cubes that you can fine-tune to be very good.
        They cost about what a store-bought cube would (plus shipping).
        "Stickiness" has nothing to do with the cube and everything to do with
        the lube. Use 100% silicone spray. Try Lowes or Pep Boys or somewhere.
        Don't use anything with petroleum in it. Cubesmith.com has lots of good
        options for stickers/tiles. You'll need maybe $30 for what I mentioned
        above. It's not an expensive hobby, but if you're only willing to pay
        $5, you're not going to have a good cube. On 2/5/06, matteo

        So, do you let all the pieces dry before putting it together? Or just
        put it together wet and give it a day or two before expecting the
        stickiness to stop? My spray seems to work awesome the first time I use
        it on any cube, but after the first time the cubes get sticky...
        sometimes worse than when they were un-lubed in the first place. On

        Isn't using more of your brain a disadvantage for a speed cuber? To me,
        that means that he is struggling to maintain his current speed (although
        in this case, it sounds like he is just wasting time). Compare this to
        running. You might say "you would win an official race, but he'd be
        breathing harder at the end." You don't get any extra points in
        speedcubing for thinking. On 2/6/06, varkmaster2

        yea, you need to add lubricant. use silicon spray (not wd-40, that eats

        article, Lars! It fits in with what I've pretty much known all along -
        that "reality" shows, like all TV shows, are "manipulated" (a more
        appropriate word) for dramatic effect. Some friends of mine were on a
        family "reality" show, "Meet Mister Mom"
        (http://www.nbc.com/Meet_Mister_Mom/). In this show, they take two large
        families where the mom runs the house, send the moms off to a spa for a
        week and give dad and the kids challenges. One challenge was a family
        game of football. My friends clobbered the other team (their kids are
        very athletic) but for the show the game became a tie. There's so much
        footage taken that they can present people and situations in whatever
        manner they wish. BATG was filmed over the course of a week or two, so
        it's a small sample of someone's personality in what I imagine is a
        stressful situation. You have to give credit to Tyson that he
        continually presents as a good guy in the show. (My daughter was sad
        when Tyson and Thais were eliminated). Random question for Tyson: My
        wife commented that "I'll bet those women never talked to any of the
        guys again after the show was done?" Can you prove her wrong? (I said
        I'd bet some ex-contestants send email back and forth). yeff

        again, just the other day I was wondering what happened to you... Sven:
        Umm, I average around 26-27 when I'm warmed up, but I get a lot of times
        varying around 20, especially the good and easy solves...I've gotten
        quite a bit better in the last month and a half since Chris Hardwick
        taught me F2L...I'm planning on learning PLL soon, and then OLL, so
        hopefully these times become more regular...At school today I got a lot
        of 22s and 23s and the likes, some faster, some slower... Craig --- In

        own an "Arxon cube" I beleive that it is the UK version of the ideal
        cube. I had it sealed for about 2 years. But then 2 weeks ago, I decided
        to open it up. It's great! very smooth with no lubricant. Someone posted
        earlier that they use DIY innards with 1981 pieces. Maybe you could try
        that. Jason K I think that it is heavier and a little bit bigger...
        maybe just my imagination. &gt; &gt; Hi, I am the lucky new owner of a
        couple original 1981 cubes in &gt; apparent mint condition. From reading
        around I understand they could &gt; make a good speedcubes.. &gt; &gt;
        I'm surprised by this since they are really stiff. Do I need to &gt;
        consider replacing any parts (eg. the kernel) or is it just the case
        &gt; that it needs many hours working in and lubing. I'd rather not
        replace &gt; anything unless I have to to keep it original but if I had
        to then &gt; where should I go to get replacement parts for this type of
        cube. &gt; &gt; Anyone had trouble removing centre caps from this age of
        cube? I &gt; accidentally damaged one of the centre caps to get at the
        screws. It &gt; seems that the intervening years welded the cap on
        somewhat. Any tips &gt; for this. &gt; &gt; Finally, I notice that the
        inside of the centre cubies are flat, not &gt; curved like the DIY cubes
        are. Am I right in thinking that flat ones &gt; are more prone to
        popping (hence the design change) because that &gt; certainly seems to
        be the case on this cube. Having slightly loosened &gt; the tension and
        lubricated the first of the cubes It still doesn't &gt; move that easily
        and it pops all the time. It seems my only option is &gt; to tighten the
        tension again to stop the popping but that means a &gt; stiff cube
        again. &gt; &gt; Cheers, Matt &gt;

        I had an excellent store-bought cube that just tightened up on me last
        time I cleaned &amp; lubed it. Maybe because I submerged it in water?
        Anyway, now it's very tight and impractical for speedcubing. Lubing does
        nothing to help. I'm willing to try just about anything to loosen it up
        again, even at the risk of breaking it. Does anybody have any tricks for
        loosening up a riveted cube? - Matt [Non-text portions of this message

        don't know PLL or OLL and Chris Hardwick just taught you F2L 6 weeks
        ago, and you are now hitting sub 20 times, and a lot of 21 and 22 second

        I'd sign up. That is pretty good for only knowing 1/3 of a system.

        I started learning OLL in August, and PLL shortly thereafter. I was
        learning both simultaneously for a while. October 31 I finished learning
        PLL November 26 or so (on a Saturday I believe) I finished OLL Just
        found a file listing which algs I knew on Oct 30... 35/57 OLL 17/21 PLL
        So it took me a month to learn last 22 cases of OLL I remember it was
        the 4 G cases that I learned last for PLL But I still check my list
        occasionally when I forget a case Probably more than you cared to

        You've gotta be sceptical. Seeing as how your sunday contest average you
        have a week before your 22.5 average was 34 seconds, plus you three/four
        look, plus you don't know OLL/PLL. And you always seemed to be around 33
        when i was racing you about a week ago. Then there was that non-lucky
        OLL skip you claimed to have. I'm not blatently calling you a liar, as
        you could be telling the truth. But things like this just make it harder
        to belive. Crongratulations, if I'm mistaken. In other news: New PB
        single 16.15 (I had a 16.43 today!) I'm still averaging around 21-22
        though but..... I've finished learning CMLL! Including recognition! One
        look corners, and one look last layer for me :D. I just gotta get every
        case recognised and executed under two seconds. Then I'll be sub-20.

        19...but I think I'm &gt; better &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; than that

        Hey Thom, I understand your reasoning, and since you've shut me out I
        haven't had the chance to explain... The time I got the 34 was beacuse:
        a) I hadn't been cubing for a week(at all) cuz I was studying for exams
        and my mom had taken away ALL of my cubes...so I had little practice...
        b) The cube I was using had gone to mush...lockups, it began popping, it
        was gooey...probably some other factors... I don't count the 22.53
        average as my PB average because it wasn't 100% real, I did solves in
        between (at school...) I did some one night, then the others another
        night, and it was a rolling average...I count my PB average to be about
        24 or 25...not sure exact... Thom, towards the racing thing, look at my
        previous post about people who watch me cube often...also about the many
        other cubers who do a 3LLL and get sub-20 times, I believe Doug Reed to
        be one of them (or used to be) Craig --- In

        think I've found a fault with the DIYs...The &gt; edges are &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bigger than the center pieces (you know how there
        is an opening &gt; &gt; &gt; on the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one
        side of the edge) well that can slide over the center, &gt; which I &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have found can cause pops, and send center
        caps across the &gt; &gt; &gt; room...But &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; I still love it :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To Darren: I used to do LBL, but I had
        always wanted to do &gt; &gt; F2L...and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        Chris Hardwick taught me in December, and I've been using it &gt; ever
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; since...I don't know how fast that F2L
        on that solve was, but &gt; &gt; a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        weeks ago I did an F2L average of around 19...but I think I'm &gt; &gt;
        better &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; than that now...It was just a
        fast fluid solve, and a 3LLL... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;

        And if you are still skeptical I was off school for 4 days (finished
        exams) and I was cubing all day all 4 days...working on getting faster

        your reasoning, and since you've shut me out I haven't &gt; had the
        chance to explain... &gt; &gt; The time I got the 34 was beacuse: &gt;
        a) I hadn't been cubing for a week(at all) cuz I was studying for &gt;
        exams and my mom had taken away ALL of my cubes...so I had little &gt;
        practice... &gt; b) The cube I was using had gone to mush...lockups, it
        began popping, &gt; it was gooey...probably some other factors... &gt;
        &gt; I don't count the 22.53 average as my PB average because it wasn't
        &gt; 100% real, I did solves in between (at school...) I did some one
        &gt; night, then the others another night, and it was a rolling
        average...I &gt; count my PB average to be about 24 or 25...not sure
        exact... &gt; &gt; Thom, towards the racing thing, look at my previous
        post about people &gt; who watch me cube often...also about the many
        other cubers who do a &gt; 3LLL and get sub-20 times, I believe Doug
        Reed to be one of them (or &gt; used to be) &gt; &gt; Craig &gt; &gt;

        F2L on that solve was, but &gt; &gt; &gt; a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; weeks ago I did an F2L average of around 19...but I think

        Aww, c'mon, Thom. I average 26s over a hundred solves and will have a
        few of those sub-20, surely you did too when you were averaging in the
        high 20's. An easy cross with a couple quick F2L pairs will take off a
        lot of non-lucky but easy seconds for us high 20 guys. I just wish I
        could average a quick F2L. So what's CMLL? Is that M not supposed to be

        think I've found a fault with the DIYs...The &gt; &gt; edges are &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bigger than the center pieces (you know
        how there is an &gt; opening &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one side of the edge) well that can slide over
        the &gt; center, &gt; &gt; which I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        have found can cause pops, and send center caps across &gt; the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; room...But &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I still
        love it :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To Darren: I used to do LBL, but I had always wanted
        to &gt; do &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L...and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Chris Hardwick taught me in December, and I've been &gt;
        using it &gt; &gt; ever &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; since...I
        don't know how fast that F2L on that solve &gt; was, but &gt; &gt; &gt;
        a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; weeks ago I did an F2L
        average of around 19...but I &gt; think I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; better &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; than that now...It was just a fast
        fluid solve, and a &gt; 3LLL... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;

        &gt; &gt; You've gotta be sceptical. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Seeing as how your sunday contest average you have a week before &gt;
        &gt; your &gt; &gt; &gt; 22.5 average was 34 seconds, plus you
        three/four look, plus you &gt; &gt; don't &gt; &gt; &gt; know OLL/PLL.
        And you always seemed to be around 33 when i was &gt; &gt; racing &gt;
        &gt; &gt; you about a week ago. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then there
        was that non-lucky OLL skip you claimed to have. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not blatently calling you a liar, as you
        could be telling the &gt; &gt; &gt; truth. But things like this just
        make it harder to belive. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Crongratulations, if I'm mistaken. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; In other news: New PB single 16.15 (I had a 16.43 today!) I'm
        &gt; still &gt; &gt; &gt; averaging around 21-22 though but..... I've
        finished learning &gt; CMLL! &gt; &gt; &gt; Including recognition! One
        look corners, and one look last layer &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; me
        :D. I just gotta get every case recognised and executed under &gt; &gt;
        two &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds. Then I'll be sub-20. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        varying around 20, especially the good and easy &gt; &gt; solves...I've
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gotten quite a bit better in the last month and a
        half since &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hardwick taught me
        F2L...I'm planning on learning PLL soon, &gt; and &gt; &gt; then &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; OLL, so hopefully these times become more regular...At
        school &gt; &gt; today I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got a lot of 22s and 23s
        and the likes, some faster, some &gt; &gt; slower... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; something? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How did you manage to go

        Yeah, I just never remember to open it when I go on computer :) BTW
        great job on sub-20. My best time is 20.56 or something similar. I'll be
        joining the sub-20 club any day now... Tim --- In

        Thom. I average 26s over a hundred solves and will &gt; &gt; &gt; have a
        few of those sub-20, surely you did too when you were &gt; &gt; &gt;
        averaging in the high 20's. An easy cross with a couple quick F2L &gt;
        &gt; &gt; pairs will take off a lot of non-lucky but easy seconds for us
        &gt; &gt; high &gt; &gt; &gt; 20 guys. I just wish I could average a
        quick F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what's CMLL? Is that M not
        supposed to be there? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matt &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You've gotta be sceptical. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seeing as how your sunday contest average you have a
        week before &gt; &gt; &gt; your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 22.5 average was 34
        seconds, plus you three/four look, plus you &gt; &gt; &gt; don't &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; know OLL/PLL. And you always seemed to be around 33 when
        i was &gt; &gt; &gt; racing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you about a week ago.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then there was that non-lucky
        OLL skip you claimed to have. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not blatently calling you a liar, as you could
        be telling the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth. But things like this just make
        it harder to belive. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Crongratulations, if I'm mistaken. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In other news: New PB single 16.15 (I had a
        16.43 today!) I'm &gt; &gt; still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; averaging around
        21-22 though but..... I've finished learning &gt; &gt; CMLL! &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Including recognition! One look corners, and one look last
        layer &gt; &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me :D. I just gotta get
        every case recognised and executed under &gt; &gt; &gt; two &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; seconds. Then I'll be sub-20. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Rethinking my non-matching blocks technique :S &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Nice to hear from you again, just the other day I was &gt; &gt; &gt;
        wondering &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what happened to you... &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sven: Umm, I average around
        26-27 when I'm warmed up, but I &gt; &gt; get &gt; &gt; &gt; a lot &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of times varying around 20, especially the good and
        easy &gt; &gt; &gt; solves...I've &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gotten quite
        a bit better in the last month and a half since &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hardwick taught me F2L...I'm planning on
        learning PLL soon, &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; then &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; OLL, so hopefully these times become more regular...At school &gt;
        &gt; &gt; today I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got a lot of 22s and 23s and
        the likes, some faster, some &gt; &gt; &gt; slower... &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How did you manage to go sub-20? Is your

        &gt;&gt;&gt; To Chris: I think I've found a fault with the &gt; &gt;
        DIYs...The &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edges are &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bigger than the center pieces (you know how there is
        &gt; &gt; an &gt; &gt; &gt; opening &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one side of the edge)
        well that can slide over the &gt; &gt; &gt; center, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        which I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have found can
        cause pops, and send center caps across &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; room...But &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; I still love it :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To Darren:
        I used to do LBL, but I had always wanted &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; do
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L...and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Chris Hardwick taught me in December, and I've been &gt;
        &gt; &gt; using it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; since...I don't know how fast that F2L on that
        solve &gt; &gt; &gt; was, but &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a few &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; weeks ago I did an F2L average of
        around 19...but I &gt; &gt; &gt; think I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        better &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; than that
        now...It was just a fast fluid solve, and a &gt; &gt; &gt; 3LLL... &gt;

        I think I learned PLL in about a week, and OLL in about two or three
        months (I took my time for that). But of course, after I learned PLL, my
        PLL wasn't perfect... Same goes for the OLL's. If you want to learn
        OLL's, I recommend my OLL page:

        You could start by learning the edges-only and corners-only OLL. I
        believe there are only around 12 of those. I learned them in a week. You
        can quickly chain an edge alg and a corner alg to handle OLL with only
        two algorithms. Technically, this is 3LLL, but you can determine which
        edge alg and which corner alg you're going to use in a single look, so
        in my mind it's just a slow 2LLL. Am I wrong? Then, you can learn the
        rest of OLL to do corners and edges together in one algorithm. I have
        not yet done this (and am not really looking forward to it). On 2/6/06,

        average around 26-27 when I'm warmed up, but I get &gt; a lot &gt; &gt;
        &gt; of times varying around 20, especially the good and easy &gt;
        solves...I've &gt; &gt; &gt; gotten quite a bit better in the last month
        and a half since &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; Hardwick taught me F2L...I'm
        planning on learning PLL soon, and &gt; then &gt; &gt; &gt; OLL, so
        hopefully these times become more regular...At school &gt; today I &gt;
        &gt; &gt; got a lot of 22s and 23s and the likes, some faster, some &gt;
        slower... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Craig &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; I thought your average was around 30 seconds... did I miss
        &gt; something? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How did you manage to go sub-20? Is
        your standard deviation &gt; very high? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Btw, congrats ! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sven

        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To Chris: I
        think I've found a fault with the DIYs...The &gt; &gt; edges are &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bigger than the center pieces (you know
        how there is an &gt; opening &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one side of the edge) well that can slide over
        the &gt; center, &gt; &gt; which I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        have found can cause pops, and send center caps across &gt; the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; room...But &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I still
        love it :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To Darren: I used to do LBL, but I had always wanted
        to &gt; do &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L...and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Chris Hardwick taught me in December, and I've been &gt;
        using it &gt; &gt; ever &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; since...I
        don't know how fast that F2L on that solve &gt; was, but &gt; &gt; &gt;
        a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; weeks ago I did an F2L
        average of around 19...but I &gt; think I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; better &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; than that now...It was just a fast
        fluid solve, and a &gt; 3LLL... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;

        Re: SUB-20!!! Fair enough, but you have to understand why I felt like
        that in the first place. Craig: I really don't care anymore :) Good job
        on the sub-20. CMLL is where you do the corners in one step where the
        LSE part of the cube can be ignored. Thanks all. ~Thom --- In

        you did too when you were &gt; averaging in the high 20's. An easy cross
        with a couple quick F2L &gt; pairs will take off a lot of non-lucky but
        easy seconds for us high &gt; 20 guys. I just wish I could average a
        quick F2L. &gt; &gt; So what's CMLL? Is that M not supposed to be there?

        I thought of Lesotho at first, then Vatican of course. I hesitated about
        Liechtenstein, but it appears to have a border with Switzerland and
        Germany, same for Andorra (between France and Spain). Interesting
        subject. Btw, do you know with which country France has the longest land
        border ? (ok I'll just give you the answer : Brasil) Have fun ! Gilles.

        exactly so, but the answer they &gt; were looking for was Lesotho. I

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think that, for example, ANYBODY in the US

        Seeing as how your sunday contest average you have a week before &gt;
        &gt; your &gt; &gt; &gt; 22.5 average was 34 seconds, plus you
        three/four look, plus you &gt; &gt; don't &gt; &gt; &gt; know OLL/PLL.
        And you always seemed to be around 33 when i was &gt; &gt; racing &gt;
        &gt; &gt; you about a week ago. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then there
        was that non-lucky OLL skip you claimed to have. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not blatently calling you a liar, as you
        could be telling the &gt; &gt; &gt; truth. But things like this just

        &gt; &gt; In other news: New PB single 16.15 (I had a 16.43 today!) I'm
        still &gt; &gt; &gt; averaging around 21-22 though but..... I've
        finished learning CMLL! &gt; &gt; &gt; Including recognition! One look
        corners, and one look last layer &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; me :D. I
        just gotta get every case recognised and executed under &gt; &gt; two
        &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds. Then I'll be sub-20. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To Chris: I
        think I've found a fault with the DIYs...The &gt; &gt; &gt; edges are
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bigger than the center pieces
        (you know how there is an &gt; &gt; opening &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one side of the edge)
        well that can slide over the &gt; &gt; center, &gt; &gt; &gt; which I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have found can cause pops,
        and send center caps across &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        room...But &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I still love it :)

        &gt;&gt;&gt; To Darren: I used to do LBL, but I had always wanted to
        &gt; &gt; do &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L...and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Chris Hardwick taught me in December, and I've been &gt;
        &gt; using it &gt; &gt; &gt; ever &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; since...I don't know how fast that F2L on that solve &gt;
        &gt; was, but &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; weeks ago I did an F2L average of around 19...but I &gt;
        &gt; think I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; than that now...It was just a fast fluid solve, and a &gt;
        &gt; 3LLL... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        thought up a new F2L method to teach him though. Cross (8 or less moves)
        3-move algs for the corners place 3 corners Use a Key Hole Variation to
        place three MidLayer edges 3-move Alg for last corner 7 move Alg for

        Orient Corners (7 or 14) Orient Edges (14 or 28) The max it'd take to
        solve the cube using minimal algorithms would be 120 moves which is an
        easy 2 minute solve for a beginner right?

        Greetings. I'm new to the group and wanted to get some advice. I've got
        a little bit of knowledge, just enough to be dangerous. I can more or
        less intuitively get the cross and F2L solved. As far as LL methods,
        ultimately, I think COLL + PLL may be a good goal. I was planning on
        starting with PLL algorithms (since I'd probably need to know these to
        start with, even using COLL). Is this recommended? Also, what is the

        I taught my girlfriend to solve the F2L the same way you describe. Her
        LL only differs in the order of things. I think it makes more sense to
        teach: Orient Edges, Orient corners, Permute edges, Permute Corners.
        This makes it easy to expand to full OLL and PLL because you can still
        use the algs that you learned early on. If you permute the corners
        without worrying about their orientation, then those algs will be
        useless when/if your teacher decides to learn more OLL and PLL. My
        girlfriend averages around 1:30 and doesn't really practice...ever...so
        2:00 is a reasonable time for this method. -Chris On 2/7/06, Daniel

        hello all i need to do some hardcore cross training (groan!). i think
        that it would really help to have a few hundred 15 move scrambles with
        solutions for the cross alone. my plan is as follows 1. generate a load
        of scrambles out of jnetcube 2. truncate to 15 moves 3. write a little
        program to calculate the positions and orientations of the D layer edges
        for each of the scrambles 4. run these through acube 5. collate the
        results into a neat file obviously if someone already has a load of
        scrambles and solutions that would be really cool. would anyone else be
        interested in the resultant file? cheers paul

        I think most people start out learning all the PLLs - there are only 21
        and they're easy to practice, since almost all of them are inverses of
        themselves. Start on a solved cube and just keep doing the algorithm to
        get the execution down. After you've learned most or all of them, just
        do normal solves to work on the recognition. Shelley --- In

        I always seem to have one piece that needs to be placed on its own. For
        example, I can place the (white/blue edge &amp; red/white/blue corner)
        as a corner edge pair AND the (white/green edge &amp; red/white/green
        corner) as a corner edge pair, but I need to place the white/red edge on
        its own using a slice move. Please help.

        Are you sure vaseline is not harmful? I have never heard of anyone
        endorsing it as a good lube. Are there silicone sprays with petroleum in
        them? I just checked mine again and it mentions in the safety warning

        Hey, Just wondering... most competitions/contests/whatever will allow
        one pop per session, correct? With this in mind, do most people usually
        use their pops? I figured that people would intentionally pop whenever
        having a bad solve.. does this happen? ---------------------------------

        completely misunderstood your post. The vaseline /is/ harmful. If you
        use it to loosen a cube (i.e., by using its harmful properties!) you
        should clean it off carefully just as soon as the cube is loose enough.
        Otherwise the cube will keep getting looser. Mike

        the silicone on your cube. But I don't know whether they are always safe

        Let's say your top + bottom colors are white + yellow (they might not
        be, just replace white + yellow with your preferred top + bottom
        colors). Let's take a white corner on the white side. The correct
        orientation, clearly, is white facing upward (assuming white is the top
        side). What's clockwise + what's counter-clockwise? Well, look head-on
        at the corner in question, so you can see all three stickers. See if
        it's twisted once clockwise relative to the correct orientation, or
        counter-clockwise. If the correct spot for white is at 12 o'clock, then
        being twisted clockwise means it's at 4 o'clock, and being twised
        counter-clockwise is 8 o'clock. The same thing goes for yellow corners
        on the yellow side. What about white corner on yellow side? Well, just
        pretend that the yellow center is white and follow the above rules. And,
        again, same goes for yellow corner on white side. What about corners
        with white AND yellow, or corners with neither? Er...they don't exist
        (assuming your color scheme has white opposite yellow) Hope this all
        makes sense; it's easy once you get used to it, don't worry. Tim --- In

        Of course it's not harmful. Why would it be? People use it everyday for
        their dry/chapped lips. Futhermore it's not smelly or dirty like WD40 or
        other lubs. Use it sparingly inside as you assemble the pieces together.

        Here's part of article 5 of the WCA regulations: Article 5: Puzzle
        Defects 5a) Puzzle defects are unintentional defects of puzzles (like:
        pieces popping, wires breaking, screws/caps/stickers falling off) that
        make it impossible or harder to solve the puzzle. ... **5c) In 'Best of'
        and 'Average of 5' rounds solves with a puzzle defect cannot be
        exchanged by an extra attempt. **5d) In 'Mean of 3' rounds solves with a
        puzzle defect may be exchanged by an extra attempt. 5d1) There may be
        maximum 1 extra attempt per round. ... 5d3) A judge may decide to
        disqualify a solve or to not award an extra attempt, if the competitor's
        puzzle defect is ruled intentional, under discretion of the judge. So,
        if you're in a mean of 3 round (clock, square-1, megaminx), and you can
        pop without looking intentional (heck, if you can pop a clock, that's
        something), then go for it! But, if they suspect you...tough luck, DNS
        and no extra solve. So, for that reason, it's really not a good idea to
        intentionally pop. Anyway, it's dishonest to pop intentionally for an
        extra solve. Tim --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, David

        Yes, in an average of 5 event, there are no pop allowances. And believe

        Vaseline works great initially, but it will destroy your cube after a
        number of years. I had a great Rubik's Game cube that I took out after
        storing it for several years, and it dissolved the central burr. The
        cube fell apart the second I tried to turn it. Fortunately I had another
        part that I used to rebuild it. The pieces were still okay, but there
        was a slimy black coating over everything before I cleaned it up.
        Silicone oil works just as well, and is safer on plastic. Chris --- In

        So it sounds like if I'm using a spray with petroleum distillates, the

        pop out an edge and spray some silicone thing inside, put the edge back

        can do... if you take your cube apart, to more or less paint each cube
        with lubricant, I'd let the pieces dry before reassamebling the cube.
        the guide about 'how to make a speedcube' on SCC also tells you
        something about how to apply lubricant.

        Hey, Just ordered a 4x4x4 cube and a megaminx from Mefferts, and I have
        a few questions. First, the megaminx is listed as a "tiled megaminx",
        and the description says it has vinyl stickers. I bought tiles from
        cubesmith for my 3x3x3 and like them a lot... since this megaminx is
        "tiled", does this mean that they won't turn to shit and fall off in a
        month like the rubik's stickers? Also -- I assume the 4x4x4 cube has the
        same crappy stickers that my 3x3x3 had? Third -- how long does it take
        to learn these puzzles? How difficult are they compared to 3x3, in terms
        of how many algs i'll need to know, different intuitive skills etc.
        Thanks!! I can't wait til I get my puzzles. David

        Using that same method, you should be able to average well under 100
        moves. Even on the worst case scenario, 100 moves would be pushing it.
        Two algs for OE One alg for PC (LU'R'UL'U'RU2) Sune and Antisune for OC
        (but consider adding double Sune and Bruno) Four algs for PE or just two
        3 cycles (perhaps repeated) Using a slower and longer way to orient
        corners, I was averaging under 100 moves, and was averaging far under a
        minute for a while. In fact, I just took an average without warming up
        and the slowest time was 38.95. I only used Sune/Anitsune for OC and
        only used 3 edge cycles to permute edges. Under 2 minutes should be an
        easy goal for your teacher with not too much effort. He ought to be
        plenty hooked by then. :) -Mike [Non-text portions of this message have

        Out of curiosity, why do most beginner methods have permuting corners
        before orienting? I find that it's much easier to recognize and teach
        which corners need to be switched when the corners are already oriented;
        it also leads into the normal 3 and 2 look last layers better. When I
        first learned a four look last layer I did OE PC OC PE just because that
        was the way I found it, but I now teach people OE OC PC PE. Just curious
        as to if there is a specific reason, or if it's just because that was
        they way that it has been done. -Evan Until next time, Happy Cubing

        I only had to learn one more alg to solve the 4x4x4, though admittedly I
        haven't learnt the algs for flipping edge pieces or swapping two
        corners, so there's only a 1 in 4 chance I can solve with any given

        Hey everyone, I just got back from a sort of cube club type meeting at
        Duke University. I brought about 30 puzzles for people to play with and
        in the course of the night successfully taught 6 people how to solve,
        and 2-3 others how to solve the F2L. A few people didn't have time to
        finish learning, and also Tyson I met a girl there who said she knew you
        and Leyan, but sadly I didn't catch her name. Anyway the method I taught
        to the people I did teach was Joel van Noort's LL mixed in with my own
        stuff for F2L (cross + corners + F2L edges, for which I have a system
        that is easy to teach/remember but of course not very speedy). Anyway I
        was very impressed with how easy it is to teach the LL with commutators,
        rather than "ok do this sequence, and don't ask me how it works because
        it's 'magic'". I found that the 6 I was able to teach understood exactly
        what they were doing for LL, and also they were all able to remember
        what they did with minimal reminders from me after the initial teaching
        session. All of the people I taught simply wanted to learn to solve and
        weren't interested in speed. So in concluson, with quite a lot of
        experience teaching people to solve the cube, I have to say that Joel's
        commutator LL is the best/easiest I've ever used. It will definitely be
        the method I teach to people who just want to learn to solve, and aren't
        interesed in later scaling to a speedier method. So Joel, I think your
        method is great, and will definitely be what I teach to beginners in the
        future :-) Chris

        I think that simplicity is important for a beginners method With OE PC
        OC PE, there are only &gt; &gt; Two algs for OE &gt; &gt; One alg for PC
        (LU'R'UL'U'RU2) &gt; &gt; Sune and Antisune for OC (but consider adding
        double Sune and Bruno) and maybe also add R'U2(RUR'U')(RUR'U')(RUR'UR)
        &gt; &gt; Four algs for PE or just two 3 cycles (perhaps repeated) FOR
        OC, sune and antisune are great, because they don't mess with the
        permutation of the corners. ALSO it is very important to remember that
        you only need to turn the R and U sides of the cube for sune and
        antisune. This is very easy for a beginner. I teach using RURU' and
        URU'R' to do F2l, also 2 gen. Its harder to learn R'FRB'R'F'RB and its
        inverse than Sune and Antisune. And these algs switch corner positions.

        cross on opposite side before insertion. I now use this method to teach
        people the cross (2 people so far) --- In

        be switched when the corners are already oriented; it also &gt; leads
        into the normal 3 and 2 look last layers better. When I first learned
        &gt; a four look last layer I did OE PC OC PE just because that was the
        way I &gt; found it, but I now teach people OE OC PC PE. Just curious as

        &gt; Step 2 is pretty hard, and of step 2 the DR edge is the hardest to

        edge. People often are afraid of this step, but it should not be that
        frightening. 1) Last pair: Piece of cake. 2) The only problem is the
        1x2x2. If DR-edge already is in R-layer with the right orientation, it's
        only a matter of adding a corner-edge pair. But the "DR first" strategy
        may be a bit slow, because you have to check for DR-edge and then find
        two pieces before starting. I prefer the "1x1x2 first" technique,
        because you can assemble 2 pieces as fast as you solve DR-edge, and then
        assembling the 1x1x2 and another edge is like solving a pair, but
        without any constraint except preserving the first 1x2x3. Gilles.

        Hi Chris! Nice to hear that the method works... Allthough I have to say
        a few things about this... I didn't really come up with the method
        myself. I really just combined some existing moves to make a method...
        And Ton Dennebroek was using the same type of ideas to teach beginners
        to solve the cube. One other thing: People on the internet really don't
        like that commutator. I made a simpler method that is easier to follow
        from the webpage. I think my explanation of the commutator method is
        somewhat complicated or something... But because commutators are cool, I
        am now also making a section about them! It will take a while to finish
        it, but it's gonna be interesting for both beginners and experienced
        cubers (who don't know about commutators). Happy cubing :), - Joël ---

        of the people I taught &gt; simply wanted to learn to solve and weren't
        interested in speed. &gt; &gt; So in concluson, with quite a lot of
        experience teaching people to &gt; solve the cube, I have to say that
        Joel's commutator LL is the &gt; best/easiest I've ever used. It will
        definitely be the method I &gt; teach to people who just want to learn
        to solve, and aren't &gt; interesed in later scaling to a speedier
        method. &gt; &gt; So Joel, I think your method is great, and will
        definitely be what I &gt; teach to beginners in the future :-) &gt; &gt;

        Isn't it kind of risky to just stick a popped cubie back into a

        &gt;From what I understand, the vinyl stickers part is a typo. Only the
        6-color megaminx had vinyl stickers. You'll need to learn 2 more
        algorithms for solving parity problems with the 4x4x4. Chris's page on
        speedcubing.com has them. I was able to get the rest of it solved just
        using my 3x3x3 know-how and some creative thinking. You should then be
        able to solve the 5x5x5 (and any bigger cube, i think?) using only what
        you had to learn for the 4x4x4 and more creative thinking. This is
        off-topic, but... I ordered my megaminx from mefferts almost two weeks
        ago, and the only notification I got about my order was confirmation of
        my paypal transaction. Does mefferts notify you when your puzzle ships?
        Or does it just magically show up at your door one day? How long does it
        usually take people in USA to get shipments from mefferts? On 2/7/06,

        Hey Joel, Looking back at your page I actually did change some stuff. I
        read your page a while back and liked the idea, but I substituted a
        different corner flip commutator without realizing. To flip corners I
        showed them L D2 L' F' D2 F to flip the corner clockwise and F' D2 F L
        D2 L' to flip counterclockwise. Other than that I used the same moves
        you did exactly for the LL. What made this work so well is that after
        doing L D2 L' type moves to flip corners, then also using L D2 L' to
        move them (I used the L reflection, since I prefer LU moves) I could say
        "and of course that should look familiar, we're using the same idea as
        flipping corners only we're only doing part of the move". So all the
        moves were conjugate manuevers with a D2 in them. To move edges I used
        your M D2 M' so again the same form. Having absolutely every step of a
        similar form (conjuagte with a D2) made it very easy for them to
        memorize. My only suggestion for the method on your site would be to try
        that commutator for flipping corners since it makes everything a
        conjugate with a D2 move. The repetition helps a lot for helping a
        beginner remember what to do. Just my two cents of course, but I found
        it to work very, very well. Well thanks Ton and Joel for the idea, I
        like this commutator LL much better than my old way of showing people,
        and will definitely use it in the future. So thanks again! Chris --- In

        I agree that simplicity is important for a beginner's method, but I
        beleive that OE PC OC PE isn't the simplest. In my beginners method I
        teach One alg for OE F U R U' R' F' One alg for OC R U R' U R U2 R' One
        alg for PC l' U R' D2 R U' R' D2 R2 * One alg for OE F2 U L R' F2 L' R U
        F2 ** *in this case the lowercase l means a double layer turn **I teach
        to turn U in the direction that the edge needs to go, so this and its
        inverse are learned at the same time, but as only one alg It is true
        that this is not a genuine four look last layer, but it has fewer algs
        and is easier to teach to a beginner (in my opinion). From this point it
        is easy to add algs in one at a time for each step in working up to a
        four look last layer. Jason, I'm glad to hear that you found part of my
        solution helpful. To be perfectly fair, most of that beginner solution
        is the way Tyson taught me to teach people (I hope that makes sense)

        &gt; &gt; corners need to be switched when the corners are already
        oriented; &gt; it also &gt; &gt; leads into the normal 3 and 2 look last

        layer I did OE PC OC PE just because that was the way I &gt; &gt; found
        it, but I now teach people OE OC PC PE. Just curious as to if &gt; there

        Using that same method, you should be able to average well under 100
        &gt; &gt; &gt; moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; Even on the worst case scenario,
        100 moves would be pushing it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Two algs
        for OE &gt; &gt; &gt; One alg for PC (LU'R'UL'U'RU2) &gt; &gt; &gt; Sune
        and Antisune for OC (but consider adding double Sune and Bruno) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Four algs for PE or just two 3 cycles (perhaps repeated) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Using a slower and longer way to orient
        corners, I was averaging &gt; under 100 &gt; &gt; &gt; moves, and was
        averaging far under a minute for a while. In fact, &gt; I just &gt; &gt;
        &gt; took an average without warming up and the slowest time was 38.95.
        &gt; I only &gt; &gt; &gt; used Sune/Anitsune for OC and only used 3
        edge cycles to permute &gt; edges. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Under 2
        minutes should be an easy goal for your teacher with not &gt; too much
        &gt; &gt; &gt; effort. He ought to be plenty hooked by then. :) &gt;

        Jasmine &gt; http://speedcuber.blogspot.com That is pretty cool, and I
        would love to have one for my house. But for $500 USD, I had better be
        able to scramble and then solve the thing. How much would it cost to
        build one like they had at the Championships (and other places, as I
        have seen in pictures)? Surely it would cost less than $500 USD. Are
        there specs available for that? I would like to build my own if it was
        fairly straight forward with materials that are common to find. -Dave

        Another page about commutators I made long ago:

        wrote: &gt; &gt; Hey Joel, &gt; &gt; Looking back at your page I
        actually did change some stuff. I read &gt; your page a while back and
        liked the idea, but I substituted a &gt; different corner flip
        commutator without realizing. &gt; &gt; To flip corners I showed them L
        D2 L' F' D2 F to flip the corner &gt; clockwise and F' D2 F L D2 L' to
        flip counterclockwise. &gt; &gt; Other than that I used the same moves
        you did exactly for the LL. &gt; &gt; What made this work so well is
        that after doing L D2 L' type moves &gt; to flip corners, then also
        using L D2 L' to move them (I used the L &gt; reflection, since I prefer
        LU moves) I could say "and of course that &gt; should look familiar,
        we're using the same idea as flipping corners &gt; only we're only doing
        part of the move". &gt; &gt; So all the moves were conjugate manuevers
        with a D2 in them. To &gt; move edges I used your M D2 M' so again the
        same form. Having &gt; absolutely every step of a similar form
        (conjuagte with a D2) made &gt; it very easy for them to memorize. My
        only suggestion for the &gt; method on your site would be to try that
        commutator for flipping &gt; corners since it makes everything a
        conjugate with a D2 move. The &gt; repetition helps a lot for helping a
        beginner remember what to do. &gt; &gt; Just my two cents of course, but
        I found it to work very, very well. &gt; &gt; Well thanks Ton and Joel
        for the idea, I like this commutator LL &gt; much better than my old way
        of showing people, and will definitely &gt; use it in the future. So
        thanks again! &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; --- In

        &gt; Nice to hear that the method works... Allthough I have to say a
        &gt; few &gt; &gt; things about this... I didn't really come up with the
        method &gt; myself. &gt; &gt; I really just combined some existing moves
        to make a method... And &gt; &gt; Ton Dennebroek was using the same type
        of ideas to teach beginners &gt; &gt; to solve the cube. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; One other thing: People on the internet really don't like that &gt;
        &gt; commutator. I made a simpler method that is easier to follow from
        &gt; &gt; the webpage. I think my explanation of the commutator method
        is &gt; &gt; somewhat complicated or something... But because
        commutators are &gt; &gt; cool, I am now also making a section about
        them! It will take a &gt; &gt; while to finish it, but it's gonna be
        interesting for both &gt; beginners &gt; &gt; and experienced cubers
        (who don't know about commutators). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy cubing :),

        According to the site their inspiration was Tic Tac Toe, Checkers,
        Backgammon, etc... They are probably just trying to avoid paying Rubik's
        royalties or something. Very stylish but probably more apropriate for a
        McDonalds kids playgroung than to my lving room though. I would have to
        redecorate everything to make it fit. Just another cube/style related
        thought: When I bought my first cube my intention was nothing more that
        decorative. I just intended to take it out of the box, put it in the
        shelf and only touch it again to take the dust off. Solving it was
        nowhere near my plans. You all know what happened then... Marco On

        &gt; it would cost less than $500 USD. Are there specs available for

        Hi :-) I revisited ur page again today Gilles :-) Why not use : F' U' B'
        E2 B U F instead of M S D S' D2 M' ?? I think it's easier to understand
        and more in line with what u show for the corners. And also the part
        doing the job is symmetric. So P Q P' Q' is in fact same as P Q P Q'
        which for some will be more logical. Well, anyway showing that breaks
        the spirit of commutators ;-) Umm, by the way. Flipping one edge on
        U-layer is much faster as R' E' R2 E2 R' than using F and E moves. I
        know the beginner solution is not meant for speeding. But even so ...

        wrote: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Joel, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Looking back at
        your page I actually did change some stuff. I read &gt; &gt; your page a
        while back and liked the idea, but I substituted a &gt; &gt; different
        corner flip commutator without realizing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To flip
        corners I showed them L D2 L' F' D2 F to flip the corner &gt; &gt;
        clockwise and F' D2 F L D2 L' to flip counterclockwise. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Other than that I used the same moves you did exactly for the LL.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What made this work so well is that after doing L D2
        L' type moves &gt; &gt; to flip corners, then also using L D2 L' to move
        them (I used the L &gt; &gt; reflection, since I prefer LU moves) I
        could say "and of course that &gt; &gt; should look familiar, we're
        using the same idea as flipping corners &gt; &gt; only we're only doing
        part of the move". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So all the moves were conjugate
        manuevers with a D2 in them. To &gt; &gt; move edges I used your M D2 M'
        so again the same form. Having &gt; &gt; absolutely every step of a
        similar form (conjuagte with a D2) made &gt; &gt; it very easy for them
        to memorize. My only suggestion for the &gt; &gt; method on your site
        would be to try that commutator for flipping &gt; &gt; corners since it
        makes everything a conjugate with a D2 move. The &gt; &gt; repetition
        helps a lot for helping a beginner remember what to do. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Just my two cents of course, but I found it to work very, very
        well. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well thanks Ton and Joel for the idea, I like
        this commutator LL &gt; &gt; much better than my old way of showing
        people, and will definitely &gt; &gt; use it in the future. So thanks
        again! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to hear that the method works... Allthough
        I have to say a &gt; &gt; few &gt; &gt; &gt; things about this... I
        didn't really come up with the method &gt; &gt; myself. &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        really just combined some existing moves to make a method... And &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Ton Dennebroek was using the same type of ideas to teach
        beginners &gt; &gt; &gt; to solve the cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; One other thing: People on the internet really don't like that &gt;
        &gt; &gt; commutator. I made a simpler method that is easier to follow
        from &gt; &gt; &gt; the webpage. I think my explanation of the
        commutator method is &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat complicated or something...
        But because commutators are &gt; &gt; &gt; cool, I am now also making a
        section about them! It will take a &gt; &gt; &gt; while to finish it,
        but it's gonna be interesting for both &gt; &gt; beginners &gt; &gt;

        Here's an idea. I can't do the extended cross as Chris Hardwick
        suggests. However, I can place the cross and a corner. The corner
        doesn't even have to be oriented So it's all the same Cross [Permute a
        corner too] Permute 3 F2L slots that last corner you can do a 3 or 4
        move finger trick to pair up then use the VH system, only 16 cases to
        memorize. Edge and corner together system cases. It's easier to grasp
        for me. And a lot less thought.

        Well I got a look at the new 2006 DIY cube. Craig is right-- these do
        seem to be all-new manufacture. The corner cap gap is less than 1mm, a
        little smaller than I imagined. Also the arched centers are no longer
        grafted on to flat centers (look closely at the 2005 centers). Instead
        it all seems to be one molded piece. Regarding the edges catching on the
        centers-- I did also experience that, but only when the caps were still
        off. Finally, one other difference is the manufacturing code is absent
        (i.e. M1005B imprinted on one corner cap). BTW, the white DIY arched
        centers exist: http://tinyurl.com/84sdz Hope they start selling the kits

        why you'd want F2B on L/R for step 4. Right now I only have a handful of
        CLL cases down (maybe 10) 2 of them involve a y rotation during the
        algorithm. EX. (B'RBR) U2 (R'dRB). So should I just not worry about

        good, but not OPTIMAL. 2ND QUESTION How do you guys handle this
        situation? when B1 is complete except for FL edge, and yellow/green edge
        is in DF with green facelet on F face. F U'l'(U'R'U) r2 U2 (u'R'u)
        (L'U')(M'U') I like the last one the best; it's similar to R2UM'U'R2

        Meh.. a few days ago there were zero megaminxes available on ebay
        (except in sets).. so I ordered one from Mefferts last night. Are
        Mefferts' megaminxes really as ugly as they look on their website? I
        paid $28 for that one... I'd rather have one that looks like yours. You
        think they already sent it, or could I cancel it? would i be able to get
        yours for under $28 (including shipping?) hmm, its worth a try. david

        No, this was a photo from twistypuzzles.com. But I can see from the
        photo that the caps are identical to the 2006 black DIY caps (with the
        offset small tabs). Ideally the perfect center would have arches but the
        old style caps (with the thick walls). But that would consume more
        plastic, so I imagine they always look for ways to manufacture it for

        I'm more confused than ever. Jason seems to be saying place the DR edge
        (red/white) fist and Roux seems to be saying place it last. If I place
        it last, it needs to come off the right face into the vertical slice or
        "ring" before I can get it back in the correct location on the right
        face  right? --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Gilles

        hard, and of step 2 the DR edge is the hardest to &gt; &gt; insert. In
        this step, I usually take care of the DR edge right away, &gt; &gt; and
        then build the 2 CE pairs around it. But If you have 1 or both CE &gt;
        &gt; pairs built already, here are my ALgs for insertion of DR edge.
        &gt; &gt; People often are afraid of this step, but it should not be
        that &gt; frightening. &gt; 1) Last pair: Piece of cake. &gt; 2) The
        only problem is the 1x2x2. If DR-edge already is in R-layer &gt; with
        the right orientation, it's only a matter of adding a corner- edge &gt;
        pair. But the "DR first" strategy may be a bit slow, because you have
        &gt; to check for DR-edge and then find two pieces before starting. I
        &gt; prefer the "1x1x2 first" technique, because you can assemble 2
        pieces &gt; as fast as you solve DR-edge, and then assembling the 1x1x2
        and &gt; another edge is like solving a pair, but without any constraint
        except &gt; preserving the first 1x2x3. &gt; &gt; Gilles. &gt;

        Daniel, If I'm understanding you correctly, when solving the cross, you
        ensure that one of the corners is in the correct slot (permutated, not

        Hi, my name is Tyler Biggs. I'm a college student at Iowa who got pretty
        decent at cubing in high school and am now working on lowering my times.
        My best average has been about 24.5 with a best time of 17.99. Anyway, I
        can't seem to find a cube that is smooth and the stickers don't come off
        quickly. If someone could point me to a reliable speedcube, I'd really
        appreciate it. Also, I've gone just about as far as I know how in OLL
        and PLL, my average F2L time is about 16-17 seconds and I'm not sure
        where to improve from here. Suggestions for that would be great also.

        I like the colors too much. If it's a high quality puzzle, I won't
        complain too much.. I'm just saying, I like the look of yours a lot

        Hi :-) Popping means that a small piece (cubie) of the cube/puzzle comes
        loose and falls out. Indeed it may really shoot out in some cases. With
        a fairly loose cube it's sometimes possible to force such popping at
        will. Have fun! -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I just got my first rubiks cube about a week ago, and I have been
        working on it. I have looked through several pages for solutions. What
        is the easiests one to learn? I am having a hard time just lining up
        corners. I can solve one side in about 30 seconds, but I know that that
        is pretty much worthless, but then switching corners around and stuff is
        tough. Can someone link me to a good guide page to look at? Thanks Pat

        I'm no expert, but I thought the below site was pretty good. It starts
        off with solving one side (layer), just as you have been doing so far.
        http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine/rubikscubesolution.html If you use this
        page, I recommend reading everything, and not doing what I did by trying
        to just look at the diagrams and find the algorithms. You have other
        options, such as the Petrus method ( http://lar5.com/cube/ ), which
        focuses on being most move efficient, or the Roux method (
        http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html ) which sort of works from the
        sides in.. not sure.. dont really know much about that method except
        that the people who do it seem to like it. There was a post recently
        (you can check the archives on the site) about a beginner method which
        some people in the group had been teaching and having success with..
        maybe check that out. good luck David broncoviper

        Hey, Tyler. What college? I live in Des Moines, so that's pretty
        central. If it's not too far from there, maybe we could work out some
        sort of cube meeting. As far as a good cube, the rubiks.com DIY kits are
        generally recommended as your best bet, but they are out of stock pretty
        often. I got my best speedcube from Wal-Mart, and have also worked a
        standard Target cube to be great, so either of those should do you just
        fine, provided you're willing to break them in well before lubing. For
        F2L, really work on understanding the algs you've learned, intuitive or
        otherwise. But mostly, concentrate on no delays.
        www.metronomeonline.comis a great tool for no pauses. You might also try
        Nate Christie's F2L triggers page. OLL and PLL is alright, but all the
        cool kids use other systems. ;P -Mike On 2/8/06, tbiggscuber

        My megaminx came yesterday! Woohoo! I'm completely stumped by the LL,
        but what fun would it be if I worked it all out the first day? I have no
        problem with the colors, but the tiles really do stick up that high. The
        picture may even make them look *thinner* than they are when you get one
        in your hands. Has anybody replaced the current tiles on the mefferts
        megaminx with the thin tiles on cubesmith.com? I'm afraid to try prying
        them off without damaging the cubie [or is it minxie? ;-)] underneath.

        Right, you can't be sure how much it will go for. &gt; &gt; But yes.. do
        the tiles really stick up like 3 inches above the thing? &gt; Geez..
        Plus, I dont think I like the colors too much. If it's a high &gt;
        quality puzzle, I won't complain too much.. I'm just saying, I like the
        look &gt; of yours a lot more.. &gt; &gt; the picture on mefferts.com is

        I'm pretty sure that cubesmith doesn't sell tiles for megaminx like the
        tjin lexan cube tiles...he only has the megaminx stickers...I personally
        like the tiles...They get a little lsippery sometimes...cuz the plastic

        I like the Meffert's tiles, but something tells me that Cubesmith lexan
        tiles would be awesome on a Megaminx. I asked Chris L. about making
        some, and he said the only issue would be finding 12 colors of lexan. So
        maybe that will be added to his product line eventually. Chris --- In

        Woohoo! I'm completely stumped by the &gt; LL, but &gt; &gt; what fun
        would it be if I worked it all out the first day? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        have no problem with the colors, but the tiles really do stick up &gt;
        that &gt; &gt; high. The picture may even make them look *thinner* than
        they are &gt; when you &gt; &gt; get one in your hands. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Has anybody replaced the current tiles on the mefferts megaminx
        &gt; with the &gt; &gt; thin tiles on cubesmith.com? I'm afraid to try
        prying them off &gt; without &gt; &gt; damaging the cubie [or is it
        minxie? ;-)] underneath. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On 2/8/06, David Pritts

        Right, you can't be sure how much it will go for. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; But yes.. do the tiles really stick up like 3 inches above the
        &gt; thing? &gt; &gt; &gt; Geez.. Plus, I dont think I like the colors
        too much. If it's a &gt; high &gt; &gt; &gt; quality puzzle, I won't
        complain too much.. I'm just saying, I &gt; like the look &gt; &gt; &gt;
        of yours a lot more.. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the picture on

        You don't HAVE to, but I'd say it isn't the best practise, because
        you've gotta get back sometime, anyway. So I'd do it before the corners
        so you get longer time looking at the case. After I make the first block
        though, I made sure I learnt so that I did no rotations whatsoever
        (apart from going off at a tangent). I'm currently reshuffling my step 2
        and trying to find shortcuts. I've been doing the 1x2x2 - pair and
        insert for a while now, and I'm looking at some alternative things. I
        don't really want to learn F2L because I like being a pure roux solver
        :) but I might learn a few of the tricky ones. It's all pretty easy,
        anyway... Starting to get really good recognition and execution on CMLL
        now. Although, it's slowing my non-mathcing block solving down because I
        have to learn the new cases to recognise. GOnna learn that big 69
        diagram table at some point.... Thanks, ~Thom --- In

        RUR' is fast &gt; U M U (R'U2R) &gt; I know that this is longer, but It

        I would probably use the 1st sequence &gt; , leaving F2B on F and B.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; MY QUESTION; IF YOU use COLL or CLL (like mike and i do

        now I only have a handful of CLL cases down (maybe 10) &gt; 2 of them
        involve a y rotation during the algorithm. &gt; EX. (B'RBR) U2 (R'dRB).
        &gt; &gt; So should I just not worry about where F2B are at the end of

        nice ways to finish pairs without &gt; &gt; rotations, I'd be all set.
        Things like BU'B' for setup. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jason K &gt; &gt; &gt;

        So how many things are actualy wrong with it? I can see two yellow white
        edges and two red green blue corners. You can tell by the corner in the
        UFL position that either B or L is white, and by the corner in the DFR
        position that either B or D is white (unless that's orange), so then the
        yellow face on the solved cube should be white. Five edges have a yellow

        I'd definitely be interested in a few kits if you end up doing that. I
        have a Meffert's Megaminx from several years ago that I just recently

        Uh, older Megaminxes might look slightly different inside. The most
        important part of the whole puzzle, just like for the 3x3 is of
        course... what would you say?... I'd say the screws. And I have two
        six-color Megaminxes that have short screws with small heads which are
        inside that cylindrical hole. So they can't block the center cubie and
        define how far you can pull it from the kernel. Not good, since then the
        limit is defined by a fully compressed spring. Not good at all, as I
        learned the hard way. Do you know how your screws look like? Cheers!

        about hand placement and effective finger usage... is that what we mean
        by "finger tricks?" Anyways.. until recently, I used my entire hand to
        do basically all the moves.. very ineffective. Now, though, I'im
        starting to work on using single fingers to do my moves, etc. My
        question is how long does it take until I get "good" at this?
        Furthremore, how would you recommend improving in this area? As of right
        now, I am just taking my time while doing my algs, and focusing on
        determining which finger is closest/easiest, etc. If I keep up with that
        (with no real "method", just intuitive practice), will I get better? Let
        me know, thanks David __________________________________________________

        No, I think the plastic pieces all look the same (well, that Tomy
        Megaminx has "shorter" corners, but my 6-color later Meffert's don't).
        But let me tell you in my experience the caps of the Megaminxes are most
        often not glued nearly as hard as for example the studio 3x3. Just take
        a thin blade and apply little force, maybe try several centers to find
        an easy one. Good luck! Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Okay, you've inspired me to take it apart. The one face is so loose I
        can literally just grab a corner and pull it out. I see now why it's so
        loose. You know those two opposite posts on the spindle that have
        cylindrical posts? That would be the top one in this photo:
        http://tinyurl.com/bvruk Well, it's not screwed all the way in,
        evidently. I can pull that center out very far compared to all the
        others: http://tinyurl.com/7p887 The opposite face with the other
        cylindrical post barely pulls out at all. So I assume those two faces
        should be balanced better on the screw depth. The other ten centers that
        protrude from the rectangular posts seem fine-- about 1mm or so. Now I'm
        off to get the pocket knife... By the way, does your paper insert method
        work for keeping Megaminx center caps on? Chris --- In

        the angle between center and edges. Cheers! Stefan

        The cap came off the loose center very easily, just as you predicted. So
        for now I can adjust it so it's usable, until I get better springs,

        I thought I may as well have bought a brick off of ebay. This cube
        wouldn't move a bit! But I sat down this morning and played with it.
        From where I started one center (red) was all solved. I solved the
        centers then grouped the edges. It was then a 3cube. I solved it I am
        very pleased that I can solve all my cubes now. Pyramid, 3cube, 4cube,
        and now the 5cube! I just have to practice and get faster on all of
        them.

        I recommend watching videos of cubers that are faster than you. Some
        people have done videos where they do the moves slowly. Try to do it
        exactly like them at first. You may find that you want to change it a
        little later. I know that Dan Knights' page was helpful to me initially,
        but I think it is no longer available. On 2/9/06, David Pritts

        Not that it makes it any less impressive, but it looks like the video is
        sped up. The kids in the background are moving suspiciously fast. But
        still, that's awesome. How many people on this list have tried teaching
        a kid to cube? It seems like their minds would just soak it up,
        especially since it's so hands-on. My son is only 2 years old, so it's a

        Very cool to see someone that young solving the cube! &gt; But still,
        that's awesome. How many people on this list have tried teaching &gt; a
        kid to cube? I have started teaching my sister how to cube, she's 5 and
        will be 6 this April. She likes to help me scramble the cubes I am using
        when I am practicing. Usually she will scramble a bunch of them and ask
        me to solve them one at a time. What I've started doing is only with the
        2x2x2 if she asks me to solve it I say that she has to solve one face
        first (not one layer). She is getting very quick at doing this, so
        pretty soon I plan on moving up to saying she has to solve one layer
        before I'll solve the rest. I really don't know of a good way to teach
        kids to cube, but I figured I would try this and see how it goes.
        Another thing I do a lot with Jade is to scramble the cube (3x3x3) three
        moves or so behind my back and have her unscramble it. She's getting
        really good at doing these too, though ones with lots of double turns
        like R2 U2 R2 still trip her up sometimes. I try to give her helpful
        hints and stuff though so she doesn't get frustrated. If anyone has any
        ideas of how to teach younger kids to cube please share. I'm totally
        winging this and just trying something and if it doesn't work scrapping
        it and trying something different. Chris

        While solving a face seems like an obvious way to work up to solving a
        layer, it doesn't really help you to understand the cube, does it? It
        seems like solving a 1x2x2 corner or even a 1x2x3 block would be a
        better first step. Careful though... she might turn into a roux solver.

        Yes the video is awesome! Very cool to see someone that young solving
        &gt; the cube! &gt; &gt; &gt; But still, that's awesome. How many people
        on this list have tried &gt; teaching &gt; &gt; a kid to cube? &gt; &gt;
        I have started teaching my sister how to cube, she's 5 and will be 6
        &gt; this April. She likes to help me scramble the cubes I am using when
        I &gt; am practicing. Usually she will scramble a bunch of them and ask
        me &gt; to solve them one at a time. What I've started doing is only
        with the &gt; 2x2x2 if she asks me to solve it I say that she has to
        solve one face &gt; first (not one layer). She is getting very quick at
        doing this, so &gt; pretty soon I plan on moving up to saying she has to
        solve one layer &gt; before I'll solve the rest. &gt; &gt; I really
        don't know of a good way to teach kids to cube, but I figured &gt; I
        would try this and see how it goes. &gt; &gt; Another thing I do a lot
        with Jade is to scramble the cube (3x3x3) &gt; three moves or so behind
        my back and have her unscramble it. She's &gt; getting really good at
        doing these too, though ones with lots of &gt; double turns like R2 U2
        R2 still trip her up sometimes. I try to give &gt; her helpful hints and
        stuff though so she doesn't get frustrated. &gt; &gt; If anyone has any
        ideas of how to teach younger kids to cube please &gt; share. I'm
        totally winging this and just trying something and if it &gt; doesn't
        work scrapping it and trying something different. &gt; &gt; Chris &gt;

        Kids generally move suspiciously fast. Honestly, there's no reason to

        Agreed. Also, I know a lot of cell phones cameras produce a video that
        is slightly faster than "real time," so that's probably the explanation.

        I decided to start with the 2x2x2 first though (since it's her favorite
        of the cubes), which doesn't allow for anything fancier than maybe a
        2x1x1 block or something. The problem I've found is that when it comes
        to attention span for little kids you can't throw a lot at them at once.
        So I figured I would start small. Plus for a 2x2x2 solving one face is
        contained in solving one layer (or can be contained if you use the same
        steps every time, the same idea as teaching a beginner a method for
        solving the cross). Also I was pretty late to develop abstract thinking,
        and I'm not saying she will be too, but I've read about mathematical
        reasoning and development in kids and most agree that starting early
        with abstract tasks can help kids to develop abstract thinking sooner,
        but up until a certain age they don't have that type of thinking yet. I
        don't want to throw too much out at once, since she seems to be
        interested and I don't want to overwhelm her and scare her away. I
        figured small steps and lots of fun puzzles (undo 3-4 turns scrambles)
        to make it also a fun way to hang out would be my approach, though I am
        open to any suggestions too. I'm not used to teaching kids how to do
        hard tasks like this, so I'm still figuring out what to do as well.

        That's interesting... the 2x2x2 is my least favorite cube. Every twist
        affects half of the cube! That's too disorienting to me. At least with
        bigger cubes, most of the cube stays stationary while I'm twisting one
        face/slice. But then again, I never developed a good approach for the
        2x2x2. I just piece together the bottom layer and then use a few OLL and
        PLL algorithms (T perm and Y perm, I think) to fix the top. It's
        horribly inefficient, but I don't really care since nobody is ever
        impressed that I can solve it anyway. On 2/10/06, cmhardw

        Hi Roger, You might want to try: http://www.cubestation.co.uk/ (click on
        the F2L link on the left side). And remember: Try to understand how the
        algorithms work! In some cases, if the other F2L pieces are not solved
        yet, the 'standard' F2L algorithms are not optimal: you can try to find
        your own shortcuts if you understand how the F2L system works. Good
        luck...! - Joël. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Stacie

        DIY cube. Craig is right-- these do &gt; seem to be all-new manufacture.
        The corner cap gap is less than 1mm, &gt; a little smaller than I
        imagined. Also the arched centers are no &gt; longer grafted on to flat
        centers (look closely at the 2005 centers). &gt; Instead it all seems to
        be one molded piece. Regarding the edges &gt; catching on the centers--
        I did also experience that, but only when &gt; the caps were still off.
        Finally, one other difference is the &gt; manufacturing code is absent
        (i.e. M1005B imprinted on one corner cap).

        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01.shtml it helps you realize

        Hey, yeah I'll have to do that. I tried to rubiks website and they are
        out of the stickers right now, said they might get them in a week.
        They've got the regular stickers and then some PVC stickers? Sounds like
        the PVC stay on much better, so I'll try to get those when they come in.
        What's the metronome thing? I've heard several times that going slower
        during F2L can help improve times, but can you describe in better detail
        how to go about it. I went to school in Johnston, where did you go?

        work on F2L more. It's easily twice as important as the &gt; LL. Even

        Hey Mike. I actually live in Johnston, but now I'm going to school at
        &gt; &gt; U of I (Iowa City). Yeah, I'll work on the F2L some more.
        Doubt I &gt; &gt; want to commit the time to learn a better last layer
        system, but maybe &gt; &gt; eventually. I don't run into any competition
        in person, so there's &gt; &gt; not quite the motivation to push myself
        much. &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been

        Beats the pants off Rubik's in selection, price, shipping, and
        durability. What's the metronome thing? I've heard several times that
        going &gt; slower during F2L can help improve times, but can you
        describe in &gt; better detail how to go about it. As a good practice
        tool, use a metronome to choose a slow beat. Then, force yourself to do
        1 move per beat, and not pause. Work up to the best speed you can
        without any pauses. I went to school in Johnston, where did you go? I
        went to Newton, but most of my family is from Des Moines, and I live
        there currently. When did you graduate? I'm class of 2003. -Tyler -Mike

        This is very normal.. I remember how hard F2L was for me, when I began
        learning it... F2L is a system that takes quite a lot of time to
        master.. But once you get the hang of it, it allows you to do the F2L
        very quickly. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Stacie

        Cubesmith looks like a great site, wish I'd found that a long while ago.
        I graduated 2004, sophomore at U of I now, majoring in math stuff. So I
        just ordered the set of tiles for 4.50 from that site, or would you
        recommend the plain stickers from them? And then I should get the DIY
        cube with only the cube (no stickers) from rubiks.com? --- In

        Well the corner caps are different. They don't extend all the way to the
        foot anymore. In the second photo you can see a thin black gap (less
        than 1mm) at the edge of the foot. On the old DIY kits (and 25th Anniv.
        cubes) the center cap was often "welded" to the foot, leaving a tab of
        plastic that required sanding or filing for smooth consistent turning.
        These new ones evidently avoid that problem. All 8 corners are perfect
        out of the box. And yes, both the edges and corners have thinner walls.
        This results in the hollow side of the edge catching on the top of the
        center, prior to installing the center caps. I was a little worried
        about this, but once the caps are on, everything works great. Also the
        caps stay on easily using your paper insert method. These caps are very
        much superior to the old DIY center caps, and have a better fit. I'll
        try to get a good photo of the centers posted. Chris --- In

        I forgot to post a photo of the screw: http://tinyurl.com/7q2so After
        tightening, the center did not pull out as far. So presumably this would

        Hey Everyone, So I joined the track team this year. There's an event
        that runners like to do. It's called the beer mile and you can find
        information at www.beermile.com. I was wondering what people thought
        they could do for a "Cube Mile." It's the same thing, except in place of
        drinking a beer, you solve a cube. I think towards the end of the
        season, I could probably break 6-minutes on the cube mile. Is anyone up
        for this? So yeah, the rules go, (solve a cube, run a lap) times 4. The
        first lap, you have to start at the mile start line, so you get those
        extra 9 meters in on a standard track. You may solve the cube between
        the mile start line and the finish line. Actually, 6-minutes is probably
        really hard. I know I could definitely do it in 6:20. Tyson Mao

        This isn't about the Mile, though it is about a sort of marathon... The
        42 cube marathon...what do you do if you don't have another cuber to

        And where did the number 42 come from??? And go Brent Morgan...I say
        less than 20 hours... I've wanted to do a lot of the UWR, but can't cuz

        Well, optimally it wouldn't have a small but a large (I mean diameter)
        head. Washers are always good, so if it doesn't have some it should
        benefit. If it's too tight, some weaker springs could help. Though, they
        shouldn't be too week or else they could break. I once experienced that
        with pretty weak ones. Next time I'm gonna order some in the middle. Oh,
        and spring ends should of course be ground. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Yes, the manufacturer does grind them somewhat. Similar to the springs
        in the 3x3 DIY. To improve it one could use sandpaper or a dremel (I do
        use a cheap clone). But whether it's good to have it 100% flat is not
        sure. For the current Meffert Megaminx I don't, cause I put six washers
        in there anyway and they're metal so there's no point in making them
        extra flat. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Well, just as long as one does not hold the F face too tightly in the
        left hand grip, one can do F and F' turns by using the right hand index
        finger and thumb, respectively, to flick the F face. Cases 10 and 21 at
        http://www.cubewhiz.com/pll.html are good examples of algorithms that

        Hi Everyone, Please respond to these e-mails in the Caltech group. It'll
        be easier for me to keep track of the discussion. I'd like to do a three
        day US National competition this year with the first day being optional.
        Basically, here's the idea: Day 1 — Get together, a couple preliminary
        rounds, just hang out etc. Day 2 — All preliminary rounds Day 3 — All
        final rounds I'd like to do it in a manner such that if someone cannot
        make the first day, it won't affect their participation in the
        competition whatsoever. Anyway, I'm looking at August 18, 19, and 20.
        Any opinions on this? Unfortunately, I see that some colleges will have
        started by then, but hopefully not too many. When responding to the
        practicality and convenience of these dates, general terms are always
        appreciated as opposed to individual preferences, but I wouldn't mind
        hearing individual preferences. Just understand that I can't honor all
        individual requests. Would people object to something in the middle of
        the week such as August 7, 8, 9? I'm guessing that's probably not as
        good. We can probably get by on a two day competition if it were just
        August 5 and 6. August 5 and 6 are looking pretty nice right now
        actually. Comments? Please comment in the Caltech group. Tyson Mao

        The 42 cube marathon number I think came out because someone did 42
        cubes in 15 minutes. It's an irrelevant number today because there are
        many sub-20 cubers now who could all break that record. Tyson Mao

        Strange coincidence. I went to wikipedia.org, to check the marathon
        thing. Todays feature article (on the main page) is about Douglas Adams!
        Still its obvious that a 42 cube "marathon" is based on Kilometers in a
        marathon. However It Turns out that Deep Blue actually was based on Deep
        thought from Hitchhiker's guide. In fact, the predecessor to Deep Blue
        was called deep Thought. in the book, Deep thought was the computer that
        spit out 42. here's the link

        I personally like the textured tiles, but I think I'm in the minority.
        The tiles are very nice though. On 2/11/06, tbiggscuber

        F2L can help improve times, but can you describe in &gt; &gt; &gt;
        better detail how to go about it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a
        good practice tool, use a metronome to choose a slow beat. &gt; Then,
        force &gt; &gt; yourself to do 1 move per beat, and not pause. Work up

        Hi Stefan, I have seen Casey's results already... :).. But I was just
        joking around, of course. On the first generation stackmat, I did not
        have any problems in competitions, and I don't think there ever was a
        clear rule about how to start (well, not about where to put your hands
        on the timer)... So this is just the way I start :p. Judges never had a
        problem with the way I start in competition, and the way I do it when I
        am at home should be correct if I want to send my records to the UWR

        going on when I &gt;&gt; &gt; was &gt; &gt;&gt; not yet there. But hey,
        "Maybe WCA should recognise female cubing &gt;&gt; records"??? Have a
        look at http://www.nascarjon.us/02.05.06.htm &gt;&gt; &gt; and &gt;
        &gt;&gt; you'll see there's no need for it :-) &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I also
        watched your average video. I think your start is illegal &gt;&gt;
        (fingers not on the sensors but in front of them). &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        Cheers! &gt;&gt; Stefan &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        did not have any problems in &gt; competitions, and I don't think there
        ever was a clear rule about &gt; how to start (well, not about where to
        put your hands on the &gt; timer)... So this is just the way I start :p.
        Judges never had a &gt; problem with the way I start in competition, and
        the way I do it &gt; when I am at home should be correct if I want to
        send my records to &gt; the UWR list. (Because timing with JNetCube
        (starting with hands &gt; flat on the table) is also allowed). &gt; &gt;
        Cyou! &gt; &gt; Joël. That's cause the judges don't know better :-). But
        you'll be in trouble if Ron judges you. Well, I guess he'd just tell you
        before the solve to pull your hands backwards if you started like that.
        For the cubes it's less important I guess, but for Rubik's Magic it
        matters quite a bit, cause picking up the puzzle is a large part of the
        total time. I just say this because the Magic is the reason I discussed
        this with Ron a bit more in detail, but the idea is of course valid for
        all puzzles. I agree the rules text can be misunderstood. The "fingers
        touching the sensors" means the fingers, not the palm, should be on the
        sensors. This is both for start and end of the solve. Maybe we should
        just have "good" and "bad" pictures in the rules for this, like we have
        for misalignments? I hope you didn't understand it as a mean accusation,
        it was just meant as a warning. I also warned Quinn about it when I saw
        his Magic videos a while ago, so he could practice the legal way. Later
        Ron was his judge for his Magic world record and told him his ending was
        close to illegal (somewhat the middles of his hands stopped the timer I
        think) but alright. So just be aware :-) Cheers! Stefan

        The caps are glued on, and probably not very easy to remove. Even if you
        could, it would be useless since the 25th Anniv. centers are fastened
        with rivets (not screws). So if the cube is too loose, there is nothing
        you can do. If it's tight, just break it in real good by using it a lot,
        and it might turn out okay. Two of my best cubes are anniv. cubes that
        started out really stiff but became very nice with use. Otherwise, you
        should get a DIY kit from rubiks.com if you want to tune the cube. The
        new 2006 ones are all-new manufacture and superior (in my opinion) to
        the 25th anniv. cubes. Chris --- In

        Just curious how long did it take you guys to learn the fridrich method?
        I can average right now about 45 sec with my modified beginner method
        but im working on learning the rest. So just looking for a point a
        reference. Now I know theres a big difference between learning and
        becoming proficient but lets hear what you have to say. Thanks, Andrew

        i can memorize pretty well, i knocked off 10 F2L algorithms today and
        now im just doing lots and lots of solves to get practice and inbed them
        deeper, I learn them usually by a combination of pattern tricks like
        'prime prime normal prime prime' or whatever and just muscle memory and
        flow. Any algorithm that i really know theres no way i can repeat out
        the notation to it, its all just the motion of my hands and seeing stuff
        fall in the right way. Now i know i cant do 10 a day becuase if I over
        do it then i'll start to loose some that i learned at the beginning. Im
        sure once i get to the LL things will slow a bit because i will have to
        change most of my meathod. With the F2L ones its just an addition to my

        Well I have been learning it for about 3-4 months and I have all of PLL
        done, half of OLL, and I only actually know a couple F2L algorithms... I
        just got the concept of F2L and do it my own way...but I haven't learned
        anything new in a while. If you are committed then after F2L you should
        have an easy month or 2 or 3 learning OLL and PLL. In the 3-4 months I

        I started with F2L because I think i have the most to gain there, I
        average about 15 sec for the LL so that makes it about 30 for F2L. My LL
        is also a lot more consistant. As far as my memorizing tricks goes, for
        some reason if i auduably remember the turn direction it triggers the
        correct face in my head, so i just think that part and the hands do the
        rest. eventually there is no thinking at all like the ones iv been using
        for a year or more. I tend to have bouts of commitment and try to start
        learning and give up. this time im really commited to at least get F2L
        done and then i can do LL later. Andrew --- In

        any action against Letterman would probably &gt; just be fuel for him to
        use against you (Leyan). Perhaps a better &gt; approach would be to try
        to get Leyan (the real one) some air time - &gt; perhaps even on
        Letterman's show. Sure, he's not likely to repeat &gt; his 11 second

        by the negative publicity provided by Letterman. &gt; &gt; - Grant &gt;

        I haven't seen the film, so I don't understand the connection to Rubik's

        Most people that do methods using cross always solve with the cross on
        one colour, there are some people that, if the cross on the other side

        I have been practicing making a white/orange 4x3x1 block 1. Then I make
        the yellow/orange block on the opposite side. Finish up with CLL. Kind
        of like Roux steps 1, 2 , and 3. You end up with most of the white and
        yellow layers finished. 2 centers, 6 edges, and all 8 corners.
        assembled, oriented, and permuted. I can avg just under a minute for
        these steps, but I can cut that down to 45 with practice. I think that a
        30-35sec avg is possible for these steps with lots and lots of practice.
        ANYWAY, I am also interested in learning other methods of solving the
        4x4. I would like to learn the cage method, and M. Akimoto's 4x4 method.
        There is also a 4x4 method in Waterman's booklet, I believe. Does anyone

        lot of half turns and awkward cases. Perhaps there is a way to place
        certain edges, and know a couple of short algs to flip edges to handle
        parity. As is, parity adds at least 4 seconds to a solve, doing nothing
        other than flipping edges. There has to be a nicer way to accomplish
        more and faster. Does anyone know a good place to get center moving
        algs? r' d r U2 r' d' r U2 You can build any type of adjacent two swap
        alg that way. For block swaps, you can use a similar principle: r' E r
        U2 r' E' r U2 For opposite edges, try M d2 M' U' M d2 M' U, and for
        opposite edge blocks, try (r2 u2)*2. Jason K -Mike [Non-text portions of

        I'll let Per go into details on this one...but... I learned a very
        similar method from him...I modified it slightly...and I only use it for
        5x5...I do: 1. Solve White Center 2. Solve Yellow center 3. Solve White
        edges 4. Solve White corners 5. Solve middle edges 6. Solve last 4
        centers 7. Solve yellow corners 8. Solve yellow edges... yes you do
        sometimes get parity...but this method takes VERY few algs... Per does
        something like (don't take my word on this) 1. Solve white edges 2.
        Solve white corners 3. Solve middle layer edges 4. Solve yellow corners
        5. Solve yellow edges 6. Solve all centers... I think mine allows for
        more freedom, but his is apparently faster?!?! The reason I do white and

        If you mean "is a wiki" and "contains some information about
        speedcubing", then yes, like that. But there's unnecessary overhead in
        maintaining the information in Wikipedia's encyclopedia format... plus
        that thing is dog slow. On 2/15/06, thewetdog

        Stefan &gt; I was about to namedrop but I can't seem to access my own
        site at the moment. :S Can you get on it? Also, you should be able to
        use wiki.snkenjoi.com. Should. In the same way that I should be able to
        get on the main site. Off on a tangent: I lost my cube today, my only
        cube. Hopefully I should be getting a donation soon though :). So I've
        been working on 4x4x4 blindsolving with your edges method, stefan. It's
        fun. ~Thom

        Dude! That's a brilliant idea. Something I could probably post some
        competitive times on too, I'd hope. I've run cross country for four
        years now, and I'm doing long distance track this semester. Although I'm
        probably quite a bit slower than you guys at solving the cube (anywhere
        from 30-40 seconds) I think I could make up for it in running. If I go
        out and do it sometime, could there be a unofficial section on
        speedcubing.com for the "Cube Mile"? Jeremy Fleischman Tyson Mao
        &lt;tmao@...&gt; wrote: Hey Everyone, So I joined the track team this
        year. There's an event that runners like to do. It's called the beer
        mile and you can find information at www.beermile.com. I was wondering
        what people thought they could do for a "Cube Mile." It's the same
        thing, except in place of drinking a beer, you solve a cube. I think
        towards the end of the season, I could probably break 6-minutes on the
        cube mile. Is anyone up for this? So yeah, the rules go, (solve a cube,
        run a lap) times 4. The first lap, you have to start at the mile start
        line, so you get those extra 9 meters in on a standard track. You may
        solve the cube between the mile start line and the finish line.
        Actually, 6-minutes is probably really hard. I know I could definitely
        do it in 6:20. Tyson Mao Astrophysics '06 California Institute of

        the way i solve it is pretty straightforward... 1. solve all centers 2.
        solve all edges 3. solve the remaining 3x3x3 cube (using fridrich) 4.

        Hey Jeremy, That's awesome! Let's totally do this. I'm not the best
        runner, but I would have the cube time to make up for it, so we might be
        very close. How fast do you think you can run your 400s? I actually am
        kind of doubtful you could make up your cubing time against me by
        running. I average around 17 to 20 so let's say if I do 20 second solves
        for the cube mile, and I run 72 second 400s, the total per lap is 92
        seconds. If you solve the cube in 35 seconds on average, 92 - 35 is 57
        seconds... which is pretty quick. What's your mile time? Tyson Mao

        doing long distance track this semester. Although &gt; I'm probably
        quite a bit slower than you guys at solving the cube &gt; (anywhere from
        30-40 seconds) I think I could make up for it in &gt; running. &gt; &gt;
        If I go out and do it sometime, could there be a unofficial section &gt;

        joined the track team this year. There's an event that runners &gt; like
        to do. It's called the beer mile and you can find information at &gt;
        www.beermile.com. I was wondering what people thought they could do &gt;
        for a "Cube Mile." It's the same thing, except in place of drinking a
        &gt; beer, you solve a cube. I think towards the end of the season, I
        could &gt; probably break 6-minutes on the cube mile. Is anyone up for
        this? &gt; &gt; So yeah, the rules go, (solve a cube, run a lap) times
        4. The first &gt; lap, you have to start at the mile start line, so you
        get those extra 9 &gt; meters in on a standard track. You may solve the
        cube between the mile &gt; start line and the finish line. Actually,
        6-minutes is probably really &gt; hard. I know I could definitely do it
        in 6:20. &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt; Astrophysics '06 &gt; California

        Hmmm ... five hours southwest of Dallas sounds pretty close to San
        Antonio. I grew up in San Antonio, went to Keystone School from 5th -
        12th grade and taught myself to cube in my freshman year. This was way
        back in 1980/1981, back when you solved Layer-By-Layer, turned with your
        whole hand, and didn't lube up the cubes. Back in the olden days, when
        there wasn't an Internet, you couldn't Google "rubik's cube solution" or
        visit speedsolving bulletin boards, and there were only a couple cube
        books in the bookstore and you were lucky to find them after checking
        all the bookstores in town (when your parents would drive you there).
        Back in the olden days, when if you broke a minute with a lucky solve
        you were ecstatic. Rubik's Cube contests were "1 run, no pre-
        inspection, everyone goes at once, drag race" competitions and the
        winners had times like 68 seconds. Back in the olden days, when "That's
        Incredible" would show people who could solve in 30 or 40 (or even
        22.85) seconds and you'd say "Oh My God! How, How, HOW did they do
        that?!?!?" You young whippersnappers have it easy :-) yeff --- In

        Ah yes, the olden days... I remember them like it was yesterday... &gt;
        This was way back in 1980/1981, back when you solved Layer-By- Layer,
        Yep, that's how I started. I somehow managed to win first place in the
        Peoria, Illinois Ideal Cube-A-Thon (as they were called then) using
        nothing but the "keystone" method for the F2L and my cousin's algorithms
        (see http://tinyurl.com/7o8rt for my original cheat sheet!) My 1st place
        time was 48 seconds! I later switched to Minh Thai's corners-first
        method, and have only recently gone back to trying my hand at LBL. &gt;
        turned with your whole hand, and didn't lube up the cubes. Yeah, I
        actually won that first contest with a cheap "Wonderful Puzzler" clone
        cube. No lube, no nothing. We did have "The Real Solution" replacement
        stickers instead of Cubesmith, although you didn't need them back then
        because the stickers were vinyl to begin with (even the cheap models).
        &gt; solve you were ecstatic. Rubik's Cube contests were "1 run, no pre-
        &gt; inspection, everyone goes at once, drag race" competitions and the
        &gt; winners had times like 68 seconds. I actually liked this format.
        There's something more dramatic about watching every solver start
        simultaneously. I think they even played music. It's also obvious who
        wins (whoever puts their solved cube down first). For the competitor, it
        adds an element of excitement because you are truly "racing" instead of
        just setting times. Speaking of times, I think all of us back then would
        have found the notion of sub-20 averages positively preposterous! Chris

        I'm really sorry if my message sounded harsh and if I came out as an
        asshole. I in no way intended to. I kept my message short because I'm
        kind of tired, but I guess I should have taken my time to be more
        polite. The self-solving cubes offered on eBay are different from those
        used and can easily be recognized as fake cubes. In the clip we see that
        he uses real cubes and we can also see that he is is using the trick
        described earlier by me. He does i very good though. Again, I'm really
        sorry if I was rude. /Gustav Kyle Bryant skrev: &gt;&gt;edgardo_deza

        Hi, A few days ago ChrisH asked me for some quesitons about the exact
        edge distributions for the 4x4. I'd like to report my findings here. Due
        to the rather technical nature of how I obtained these number (quadruple
        nested summations and products)..., I omit the details. Besides I don't
        want to ruin it for ppl who'd like to solve this problem on their own.
        For the 3x3, the cross *exact *probabilities on a random cube is: 0
        84.43% 160489/190080 1 14.51% 6893/47520 2 1.03% 65/6336 3 0.046%
        17/47520 4 (5.26*10^-4)% 1/190080 For the 4x4, the chances of getting a
        specific number of solved edges on a random scramble or after doing
        centers randomly is: 0 59.38% 1 30.92% 2 8.08% 3 1.41% 4 0.186% 5
        0.0198% 6 etc..... 7 8 9 10 11 12 For the 5x5, .... well you get the
        idea... Ok it's better if you just look at the following pages if you
        are intersted in this discrete distribution:
        http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/3x3_ExactCross.jpg
        http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/4x4_EdgePairs.jpg
        http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/5x5_EdgePairs.jpg That is
        Mathematica code, btw (but those functions are certainly not built in,
        lol). These took me several hours to figure out, the 5x5 probabilites
        where based on the other two and easily found after I figured out the
        cross stuff... Everything adds to 1, so it checks out. I also matched
        the numbers to doing it by case count for some base cases so I'm
        confident it's correct. In case you're interested there is a great deal
        of probability theory involved and what Chris showed me:
        Inclusion-Exculsion Principle. Also I had to resort to what I would call
        "the Theory of Highly-Generalized Partial-Derangments" (lots of
        Subfactorials involved and most math ppl don't even know what that is).
        I can show you how I setup the summations if soneone's interested. Plus
        I can generalized it to NxNxN cubes. Tell me if someone already did
        this, I'd like to know if I was the first to bother doing this. -Doug

        Hmmm - maybe we have a new event for future competitions? Take the final
        round competitors, put them through their 5 timing runs, then while
        you're tabulating results, put them in a "drag race": One scramble, no
        pre-inspection, all start at the same time, first solve wins. It could
        be a real crowd pleaser! yeff ps - no, not the other kind of "drag"
        race. Though, now that you mention it, didn't they get Tyson in a dress

        solve you were ecstatic. Rubik's Cube contests were "1 run, no pre- &gt;
        &gt; inspection, everyone goes at once, drag race" competitions and the
        &gt; &gt; winners had times like 68 seconds. &gt; &gt; I actually liked
        this format. There's something more dramatic about &gt; watching every
        solver start simultaneously. I think they even &gt; played music. It's
        also obvious who wins (whoever puts their solved &gt; cube down first).
        For the competitor, it adds an element of &gt; excitement because you
        are truly "racing" instead of just setting &gt; times.

        Tyson, I'm in Dallas (actually Garland and work in downtown Dallas), but
        probably can't help with what you want. I do a layer solve (see RE
        Dallas "Old School") and avg 40-45 sec. I also have a beginner layer
        method that I teach that has only 5 total alg's, from layer 2 to
        completion (no inverse etc.) that a beginner can learn and memorize in
        one day (probable avg solve would be around 90 sec, because although
        only 5 total alg for layer 2 and top, they may have to repeat the same
        alg a couple of times for each step). Yes, not efficient, but can be
        memorized easily in a couple of hours. Currently trying to learn
        Fridich/CFOP (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL), but don't know enough to really teach
        it...still trying to learn/memorize myself. Like I said, probably not
        what you are looking for, but let me know if I can help out. Brent ---

        I ordered some tiles just a couple of weeks ago, and they arrived very
        promptly, just as they always have with my past orders. Just place the
        order through the website and I'm sure you'll receive them soon. And
        thanks to Chris for such great stickers and tiles! Also, fyi, if you
        don't have paypal, there's a link on the site with instructions on how
        you can just send a money order, but paypal is definitely the easiest

        I think you're mixing up messages. The original poster (edgardo_deza)
        asked for the explanation, and Gustav provided one. I believe he meant

        I agree about the no pre-inspection. Everyone knows a large part of
        getting your times down is fast recognition or pre-recognition during
        the solve to minimize the times between algorithms, but we currently let
        everyone have 15 seconds to pre-inspect (isn't that like subtracting a
        portion of the overall solve time). My best single solve, "non-lucky"
        was 24 sec back in 1983...just wondering what it would have been with
        pre-inspection. Anyone have thoughts on pre-inspection vs no
        pre-inspection? &gt; Take the final round competitors, put them through
        their 5 timing &gt; runs, then while you're tabulating results, put them

        Hey, If you check the world records there is a separate record for No-
        inspection...Some people (mainly non-cubers) think the inspection is
        stupid for 1 of 2 reasons...1:They think it is cheating or 2:The don't
        see what you are looking for...So I think the inspection is a good thing
        and if you are hosting a competition and want to do a round with
        no-inspection then go ahead...the Swedish Competitions always have
        them...these competitions probably have the most events but it works cuz

        This really sounds like a fun event. I'll try it when it gets warmer
        outside (Now it's 30-40 cm of snow which isn't the best conditions for
        running). I guess 20 econds per cube is fairly reasonable, but 4 laps á
        72 seconds sounds quite hard to me, with only 20 seconds to catch my
        breath. By the way, what's your best time for one lap (400 meters)??
        I've done 57.8 but I'm not a runner, I'm a highjumper, so I think it's a

        &gt; How fast do you think you can run your 400s? I actually am kind of
        &gt; doubtful you could make up your cubing time against me by running.
        I &gt; average around 17 to 20 so let's say if I do 20 second solves for
        the &gt; cube mile, and I run 72 second 400s, the total per lap is 92
        seconds. &gt; If you solve the cube in 35 seconds on average, 92 - 35 is

        &gt; &gt; www.beermile.com. I was wondering what people thought they
        could do &gt; &gt; for a "Cube Mile." It's the same thing, except in
        place of drinking a &gt; &gt; beer, you solve a cube. I think towards
        the end of the season, I could &gt; &gt; probably break 6-minutes on the
        cube mile. Is anyone up for this? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So yeah, the rules
        go, (solve a cube, run a lap) times 4. The first &gt; &gt; lap, you have
        to start at the mile start line, so you get those extra 9 &gt; &gt;
        meters in on a standard track. You may solve the cube between the mile
        &gt; &gt; start line and the finish line. Actually, 6-minutes is
        probably really &gt; &gt; hard. I know I could definitely do it in 6:20.

        I remember, 25 years ago we discussed the following. You have to run
        400m and solve the cube. You have the option to solve the cub before or
        during the running (or after the running if you like, but it looks
        stupid). What´s your strategy? R ----- Original Message ----- From:

        I think the inspection is &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; good thing and if you

        Well, if I start by solving the cube and then run, a perfect time could
        by around 1:15. I think it would be hard to run that fast while cubing.
        Solving the cube after the run, isn't a good idea in my opinion, since
        you will be very tired and have a hard time turning the cube fast. When

        Yes, but the point is; you don´t have to run that fast, if you are
        cubing simultaneously. (If you run x sec slowerly and solve the cube y
        sec slowerly, then, if x+y&lt;(normal time to solve the cube), the
        overall time will be less. R ----- Original Message ----- From: "Gunnar

        start by solving the cube and then run, a perfect time could by around
        1:15. I think it would be hard to run that fast while cubing. Solving
        the cube after the run, isn't a good idea in my opinion, since you will
        be very tired and have a hard time turning the cube fast. When Michael
        Johnson was at his peak, he could have broken the magical 1-minute

        when it gets warmer &gt; outside (Now it's 30-40 cm of snow which isn't

        Let's totally do this. I'm not the best runner, but I &gt; &gt; would
        have the cube time to make up for it, so we might be very close. &gt;
        &gt; How fast do you think you can run your 400s? I actually am kind of
        &gt; &gt; doubtful you could make up your cubing time against me by
        running. I &gt; &gt; average around 17 to 20 so let's say if I do 20
        second solves for the &gt; &gt; cube mile, and I run 72 second 400s, the
        total per lap is 92 seconds. &gt; &gt; If you solve the cube in 35
        seconds on average, 92 - 35 is 57 &gt; &gt; seconds... which is pretty
        quick. What's your mile time? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt; &gt;

        joined the track team this year. There's an event that runners &gt; &gt;
        &gt; like to do. It's called the beer mile and you can find information
        at &gt; &gt; &gt; www.beermile.com. I was wondering what people thought
        they could do &gt; &gt; &gt; for a "Cube Mile." It's the same thing,
        except in place of drinking a &gt; &gt; &gt; beer, you solve a cube. I
        think towards the end of the season, I &gt; could &gt; &gt; &gt;
        probably break 6-minutes on the cube mile. Is anyone up for this? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So yeah, the rules go, (solve a cube, run a
        lap) times 4. The first &gt; &gt; &gt; lap, you have to start at the
        mile start line, so you get those &gt; extra 9 &gt; &gt; &gt; meters in
        on a standard track. You may solve the cube between the &gt; mile &gt;
        &gt; &gt; start line and the finish line. Actually, 6-minutes is
        probably &gt; really &gt; &gt; &gt; hard. I know I could definitely do
        it in 6:20. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt; &gt; &gt;

        records there is a separate record for No- &gt; &gt; &gt;
        inspection...Some people (mainly non-cubers) think the inspection &gt;

        cheating or 2:The &gt; &gt; &gt; don't see what you are looking for...So
        I think the inspection is &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; good thing and if you
        are hosting a competition and want to do a &gt; &gt; &gt; round with
        no-inspection then go ahead...the Swedish Competitions &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hey everyone, Ok so I've been trying to do this for a long time, and I'm
        very happy to finally have done it! I finally got a sub-20 average using
        a 4LLL! I know others have already done this (I believe Macky and Lars
        V. and I know Dan Knights has done this, and probably others that I
        don't know about). So again I'm not the first by a long shot, but it
        feels good to also have done it :-) 18.24, 19.38, 19.19, (17.56), 19.57,
        20.33, 21.60, 23.96, (24.88), 18.03, 17.90, 20.41 = 19.86 Basically I
        like to do this as an F2L drill, you're allowed to use any F2L tricks
        you know (including influencing the LL edges with the last pair, and no
        I didn't use any ZBF2L). For the LL I did 1) orient edges 2) orient
        corners 3) permute corners 4) permute edges I didn't use any algs that
        permute 2 corners and also two edges, I did a quarter turn and then
        permuted corners first and edges second for those cases. It's fun to
        try, and feels really good to see your F2L times drop by trying to get
        faster this way! Basically just think of it as a way to train your F2L.
        Give it a shot! It's fun! Chris

        In this version of the game, I would run and solve the cube at the same
        time. In a 400, I am not physically fit enough to sprint all out so I
        could keep it at a pretty fast pace and still be able to move my fingers
        and solve the cube. After I finish the cube, I could drop it and sprint

        20 so let's say if I do 20 second solves for the &gt;&gt;&gt; cube mile,
        and I run 72 second 400s, the total per lap is 92 &gt; seconds.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; If you solve the cube in 35 seconds on average, 92 - 35 is

        what people thought they could do &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for a "Cube Mile."
        It's the same thing, except in place of &gt; drinking a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        beer, you solve a cube. I think towards the end of the season, I
        &gt;&gt; could &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably break 6-minutes on the cube
        mile. Is anyone up for this? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So yeah,
        the rules go, (solve a cube, run a lap) times 4. The first
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lap, you have to start at the mile start line, so you
        get those &gt;&gt; extra 9 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meters in on a standard
        track. You may solve the cube between the &gt;&gt; mile &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        start line and the finish line. Actually, 6-minutes is probably &gt;&gt;
        really &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hard. I know I could definitely do it in 6:20.

        do. It's called the beer mile and you can find information &gt;&gt;&gt;
        at &gt;&gt;&gt; www.beermile.com. I was wondering what people thought
        they could do &gt;&gt;&gt; for a "Cube Mile." It's the same thing,
        except in place of drinking &gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt;&gt; beer, you solve
        a cube. I think towards the end of the season, I &gt; could &gt;&gt;&gt;
        probably break 6-minutes on the cube mile. Is anyone up for this?
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So yeah, the rules go, (solve a cube, run a
        lap) times 4. The first &gt;&gt;&gt; lap, you have to start at the mile
        start line, so you get those &gt; extra 9 &gt;&gt;&gt; meters in on a
        standard track. You may solve the cube between the &gt; mile
        &gt;&gt;&gt; start line and the finish line. Actually, 6-minutes is
        probably &gt; really &gt;&gt;&gt; hard. I know I could definitely do it
        in 6:20. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Tyson Mao &gt;&gt;&gt; Astrophysics

        Actually maybe that is too high. Jesse took 24 hours to do 2000... I'm
        just assuming he can keep up with a roughly 30-second average given
        diminishing returns due to awareness and hand condition.

        In total I'll say 3600 3,601, Bob! But in all seriousness, I'm certain
        he's going to approach the 4,000 mark. He's doing abou 180 cubes/hour
        right now, and that would only require about a 165 cube/hour pace from
        here out. As he's still going pretty strong, and is used to doing
        averages of 500 or more frequently, I imagine he'll keep up a good speed
        for quite a while. I'll post a definite guess later. It's handicapping
        to guess so early. -Mike [Non-text portions of this message have been

        more than a second away:

        15 16.**: 7 17.**: 20 18.**: 17 19.**: 14 What makes it so hard to get

        It's a funny thing that I've noticed too. I was in the 17.** range for
        at least two months but then suddenly I did 16.32 and then a few weeks
        later 15.86, so I was in the 16.** range for a really short time. I'm
        not cubing very much right now because my thumb and arm is aching (is it
        the right word?) when I touch a cube. /Gunnar --- In

        17 &gt; 19.**: 14 &gt; &gt; What makes it so hard to get under 17 but so
        easy to get under 16? &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

        We've had some discussion about this before I think but I now have a
        sudoku cube given to me by my wife. Its black plastic with number
        stickers and comes with a sudoku solution for each face (although I
        suspect there are many solutions subject to orientation). Anyway not
        wanting to cheat by looking at the solution I'm still struggling to
        solve it! The orientations of the corners look as though they should
        give a big clue to the intended solution - I guess its still a valid
        solution if the numbers work but aren't oriented the right way. Anyway I
        haven't seen any mention of one on the market so it was a bit of a
        surprise. Anyone else seen any? Duncan PS Had a quick search before I
        pressed send and I find at least that hamleys in London do one called
        the Sudokube. Its different from mine but same principle

        Just bite the bullet, man. I took mine apart and lubed them with the
        same silicone spray I use on my 3x3x3 and they're both excellent now.
        Search google for "disassemble 4x4x4" and "disassemble 5x5x5" to get
        directions for how to safely take them apart and put them back together.
        It took me about an hour to put my 5x5x5 back together, so I'd give
        yourself some time. But they both went from nearly unusable (both made
        my hands really ache to even complete a single solve) to awesome. It's
        definitely worth it. Plus, the mechanism for the 4x4x4 is something you
        really have to see. I still have no idea how it works, but it's very
        cool. On 2/18/06, bballkid2076 &lt;bballkid2076@...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt;

        I would not say it heavily weighs your chances, it's more of a lower-
        bound cutoff threshold. A 1400+ can get you in anywhere, and a 1500+ is
        considered safe if you're going for an Ivy or an equivalent in terms of
        admissions difficulty. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey everyone, I switched over to Curling today cause I have no idea what
        it is and wanted to broaden my horizons. Turns out, the curling reporter
        guy for NBC was standing in front of a miniature curling lane, and on
        one end was a scrambled up cube. Why? I dunno, but nonetheless it is
        there! Now if only we could get cubing in as an olympic event! -daniel

        Hi Brent :-) Go for it! It would be such a cool number to stop at 3456
        ;-) It's such an easy number to remember and maybe someone else will
        have a chance to beat it :-P But Brent, please keep the cube above the

        That's such a great achievement. That gives ~27 seconds per cube, but he

        JNetCube works fine on a Mac and you can use it to enter times manually
        and it will just generate a new scramble each time and calculate your
        average. As with ACube, It also uses Java Runtime Environment (JRE) but
        that should be a standard package in Mac OS X. Is that what you use? I
        don't know about OS 9 or earlier versions. If you want to use ACube, you
        should open Terminal and change to the directory of ACube. Then type the
        following command: java -cp ACube3.jar ACube and off you go. You can
        also execute the included run.bat from the Terminal but you'll have to
        edit it first and remove the trailing @ from the first line. I hope this
        helps. Lars --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "kovacic81"

        True, though... I think most things "pi" related don't usually round...
        gosh, what geeks are we debating the rounding of pi! With "pi" day, it's
        generally on March 14, at 1:59 PM, and well, I guess you could carry it
        out for more decimal places, and in this case as well, rounding makes no

        We stopped at about 7 PM so he had an hour and a half left, but it's
        really not an accurate of how much "time" he used. He solved 2000 cubes
        in about 12 hours and 6 minutes which should give you an idea of the
        rate he was going at for 12 hours... and that was pretty solid with only
        a couple of breaks. After the 12 hour mark, exhaustion really started to
        play in and by noon the next day, his pace had slowed to maybe 100 an
        hour. Tyson Mao Astrophysics '06 California Institute of Technology On

        I'm not sure, though we could easily check the e-mail archive for the
        answer. I was actually pretty surprised when people were guessing 4200
        (based on his beginning pace) and other things as well. I've done this
        race called the KELROF where you have a team of 10 and each person runs
        a mile and you trade off relay style for 24 hours... and towards the
        middle hours, it really feels bad. I mean... feels REALLY bad... so I
        think my guess would have been for about 3400 to 3500 cubes. Brent could
        have done about 3500 to 3700 cubes if he had really wanted, but there is
        a certain amount of pain and discomfort that comes with all of this, and
        without the right motivation, it simply wasn't going to happen. Tyson

        Thank you for mentioning me! I have nothing against Thom, but I wouldn´t
        say he was guessing. He just used a strategy (maybe influenced by a
        certain scoundrel): Saw my guess, added something and had won, had the
        right answer been anything between my guess and 3600. I´m not that proud
        of my "victory". It was all too easy to predict a result &lt;3500. Btw.
        it´s a pity that Brent couldn´t (wouldn´t) fulfil. A logarithmian
        extrapolation pointed on a value around 3450. On the other hand the road
        now lies open to a new record for a man with stamina and motivation.

        Yeah, most people keep it on the D face, AKA "D-Cross." That way, you
        don't have to flip the cube over and you can go straight to F2L etc. not
        necessarily better.. depends on your own preference: e.g. Jean Pons
        solves it on top. &gt;From Macky's site: Q5: Will it really make a
        difference if I put the cross on the bottom / left instead of on the
        top? I don't feel like throwing away the eight algorithms I memorized.
        :( A5: I use to do F2L with cross on U-face, but switched to D-face
        after getting sub-35. And trust me, it really makes a big difference, as
        I got a sub-30 average within a week after making that change. Here are
        a the two big advantages of D-cross F2L in speedcubing: 1. You use a lot
        of U and R moves, which allows you to execute algs quickly using
        FSC's(Finger Short Cuts). For example, one alg in U-cross F2L is FDF',
        but using D-cross F2L, it can be done as RUR' in about 0.3 second. ( ! )
        Dan Knight's Speedcubing Page has some good FSC videos. See how Dan
        turns the cube using just one finger? That's what you will want to be
        doing if you want to average sub-20. 2. By using D-cross F2L, you can
        look for the second corner-edge pair while you're doing the first, third
        when doing the second and so on, so that you can turn the whole F2L
        non-stop. It takes a lot of practice to be able to do this, and I think
        it's not too much to say that this non-stop F2L is what separates sub-20
        cubers from the rest. Oh, and yeah, try turning the algs from
        www.speedcubing.com and then you can learn the ones that you like. One
        more thing: GO SLOWLY ON F2L! This is the best advice anyone can give
        you. If you go too fast, you won't be able to see the next corner-edge
        pair, so you'll have to stop and search for the next pair, which is
        definitely not a good thing in speedcubing. Darren --- In

        of on the top? &gt; I don't feel like throwing away the eight algorithms
        I memorized. :( &gt; A5: &gt; I use to do F2L with cross on U-face, but
        switched to D-face after &gt; getting sub-35. And trust me, it really
        makes a big difference, as I &gt; got a sub-30 average within a week
        after making that change. &gt; &gt; Here are a the two big advantages of
        D-cross F2L in speedcubing: &gt; 1. You use a lot of U and R moves,
        which allows you to execute algs &gt; quickly using FSC's(Finger Short
        Cuts). For example, one alg in &gt; U-cross F2L is FDF', but using
        D-cross F2L, it can be done as RUR' in &gt; about 0.3 second. ( ! ) Dan
        Knight's Speedcubing Page has some good &gt; FSC videos. See how Dan
        turns the cube using just one finger? That's &gt; what you will want to
        be doing if you want to average sub-20. &gt; &gt; 2. By using D-cross
        F2L, you can look for the second corner-edge pair &gt; while you're
        doing the first, third when doing the second and so on, &gt; so that you
        can turn the whole F2L non-stop. It takes a lot of &gt; practice to be
        able to do this, and I think it's not too much to say &gt; that this
        non-stop F2L is what separates sub-20 cubers from the rest. &gt; Oh, and
        yeah, try turning the algs from www.speedcubing.com and then &gt; you
        can learn the ones that you like. &gt; &gt; One more thing: GO SLOWLY ON
        F2L! This is the best advice anyone can &gt; give you. &gt; If you go
        too fast, you won't be able to see the next corner-edge &gt; pair, so
        you'll have to &gt; stop and search for the next pair, which is
        definitely not a good &gt; thing in speedcubing. &gt; &gt; Darren &gt;

        &gt; &gt; When solving the cube using a cross method, what is the

        most people &gt; &gt; hold the cube with white on the D face or solve it
        on the upper face &gt; &gt; then flip over? Thanks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        on the D face, AKA "D-Cross." That way, you &gt; &gt; don't have to flip
        the cube over and you can go straight to F2L etc. &gt; &gt; not
        necessarily better.. depends on your own preference: e.g. Jean &gt; &gt;
