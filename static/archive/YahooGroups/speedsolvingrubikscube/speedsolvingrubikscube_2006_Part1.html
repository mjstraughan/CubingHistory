          <em>From:</em> &quot;Stefan Pochmann&quot; &lt;pochmann@...&gt;<br>

I think clock is a bit different. Yes, it does take longer to scramble 
than to solve. But, scrambling a clock is fairly easy and not that 
slow after you&#x27;ve done it a few times. And it&#x27;s easier if you know how 
to solve the clock. Scrambling megaminx with the scramble algs gives 
even *me* a headache and takes me 3 minutes or so for the 60 moves. 
That&#x27;s why for practice I prefer doing 100 &quot;humanrandom&quot; moves, taking 
me 40 seconds. Also, in case the clock scrambler made a mistake, there 
are many people who can just solve it in a short time for a new 
scrambling attempt. Megaminx takes *everybody* a long time and 
Square-1 takes *almost* everybody a long time.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi, new here, but been speedcubing a year or so.<br>
<br>
I did the following guide originally while learning Guimond&#x27;s<br>
method. It is basically a clarified edition, with some added<br>
algorithms and some left away. I haven&#x27;t gone through all<br>
mostly optimized solutions from the french version of his guide yet.<br>
I hope this helps those who are having hard time learning this<br>
particular method.<br>
<br>
After I get sub-30 sec with this I propably start learning <br>
ZB-method. Very attractive due to its 40 move average count.<br>
http://www.zborowski.republika.pl/expert3x3x3method.html<br>
<br>
Attached is the guide itself in a text format. Anyone with<br>
cubing sites may publish, add to it and transform to whatever <br>
formats necessary. ie. with visuals etc if needed.<br>
Original guide is located at<br>
<br>
http://www.rubikscuberecord.com<br>
<br>
For those who don&#x27;t know, Guimond&#x27;s method is perhaps one<br>
of the easiest and fastest way to learn to solve rubik&#x27;s cube, <br>
while getting pretty easy under 1 minutes. And only a handful<br>
of algorithms to remember too.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thats a good time for a beginners method. You should try and learn
finger tricks so that you can turn the sides faster. I suggest you
learn that too. Good luck learning petrus!

I just went to a local hardware store (I think it&#x27;s called town and
country hardware, not sure though).  I bought 8 springs total (at
$.60) but the catch was they are waaay longer than i needed them to
be, so I had to cut them down, I also bought 24 nylon washers yet I
only ended up using 12.  I was able to change out three megaminx
springs to every spring that i bought.  the whole process of cutting
the springs and changing them took about 2 hours total, but it was
worth it, my megaminx works sooo much better.  Thanks guys!

I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s possible, you and i are in exactly the same boat.
 I&#x27;m in the process of learning the petrus method too.  Last night i
was able to get a time of 1:02, and i&#x27;ve been using the petrus method
for about one and a half weeks.  So, in a week and a half, my times
have dropped about 30-35 seconds, and granted, they won&#x27;t drop that
fast in the future, I would bet that sub-50 in a month is totally
possible, but i guess we&#x27;ll see!  Good luck!

used to hit mid-to-low 30s...but that wasn&#x27;t with 100% beginner...I
learned a bit extra, like 10 more algs to drop about 20 seconds off my

          <div class="email-content">I must say that sub-1 minute average for 4*4*4 as quite ambitious, 
but that&#x27;s how it should be. My prime goal is to get a sub-15 
average for 3*3*3 and a sub-30 average for one-handed solving. I 
also hope to be among the finalists at the European championships.

We are a couple of Swedes that are practicing 2*2*2 quite hard now 
and I will try to learn the 2-step solution where you first orient 
one sida and then fix the rest.

I guess we will see a lot of amazing achievement during 2006. Here 
are some of my guesses: 

sub-13 average for 3*3*3
A LOT of sub-15 averages.
sub-1 minute average for 4*4*4

Is that 0.60 for each spring or for all of them together? And when you 
cut the springs, doesn&#x27;t that leave very unflat (i.e. scratching) 
ends? Or did you find a way to get them nice flat again?

Cheers!

Though... those 40 moves include 18.5 for F2L minus one corner/edge 
pair. Which is surprising, not only because he seems to get 18.5 as 
6+3*6.5 which should be 25.5 instead. What am I missing?

It was 0.60 per spring so it wasn&#x27;t the best deal ever (i was
desperate though! haha) and when i cut the springs i was able to bend
the pointy end so it wouldn&#x27;t scratch the washers away.  It certainly
isn&#x27;t as clean as if i had gotten springs that we&#x27;re actually cut to
the correct length by the manufacturer.  Did you order your springs
online or through the mail or did you buy them at a store?

Ah, ok... 0.60 for 8 springs would&#x27;ve been a super deal. I ordered 
mine through the manufacturer&#x27;s website. No chance to get good springs 
for a good price in a store, at least that&#x27;s my experience.

Time ago I ordered some nice 2milimeter washers from Skiffy website, a web you recommended. I recommend this washers too.
But, where do you buy the springs? which is the website? and the spring characteristics/requirements?
It is hard to find in stores here in Spain...

To answer your question, no, its not a good idea to submerge it if you
value the inserts.

around with his F2l method, and I&#x27;d say a more reasonable goal for
speedcubing would be 20-23 moves, which is still much less, but much slower
recognition than f2l pairs.

Though... those 40 moves include 18.5 for F2L minus one corner/edge 
pair. Which is surprising, not only because he seems to get 18.5 as 
6+3*6.5 which should be 25.5 instead. What am I missing?

willing to learn, b ut first just try to do a simple google search and
u&#x27;ll get what u need most of the time.

And as for ur question, what do u mean by &quot;2 LL&#x27;s&quot; ? There is only one
last layer. Maybe ur confusing something. As for the algos, goto
cubestation.co.uk and u&#x27;ll find all the algos u need.

Keep cubing!

My best time with the Petrus method is 11.91 seconds and my best
average of 10 is 19.46. I have practiced it for (only) 7 months. I
know it&#x27;s possible to average sub 15 with this method, and that&#x27;s in
fact my goal before 2007. That will, of course, require very much
intuition and practice, but I know it&#x27;s possible. So, the Petrus
method is a really fast speedcubing method, and I believe it&#x27;s at
least as good as Fridrich. It&#x27;s a pity that so few people use it.

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be able to do sub 50 within a month, it&#x27;s not hard at
all. I don&#x27;t remember exactly how fast I improved, but I remember that
it took me 1-2 months to average 45 seconds.

That&#x27;s semi-normal. The springs are too long and strong. Usually this 
only makes the puzzle extremely stiff, but in some cases the pressure 
together with the non-ground spring ends and rotations combine and 
screw out the screw. See other Megaminx thread from the last 2-3 days.

Cheers!
Stefan

Actually... no I don&#x27;t. Do you mean 2mm thick? Metal or nylon? I 
thought about getting 2mm thick nylon washers for Megaminx because 
currently I use about 6 washers each 0.8mm thick. But that&#x27;s ok, too, 
and they&#x27;re cheap.

I can see they are not as small as I stated. The page says : outside diameter 6, inside diameter 3.2, thick 0.8.

Really, between 2 and 3 mm of metal, oustide minus inside diameter.

I have always &#x27;thought&#x27; they were (it is better to say &#x27;called&#x27;) 2mm or so because when I bought &#x27;3mm wahers&#x27; in a store, they selled me bigger washers than the ones I bought by web. So, it is probably (and surely) a defect on me.

Be sure the washers are the linked here above.

That&#x27;s awesome fast... looks like 1.10 seconds. I tried it with index 
finger doing the whole U2 in one go, too, and I&#x27;m puzzled. Sometimes 
it works wonderfully, sometimes I just can&#x27;t do it. Must have to do 
with where exactly I place my other fingers. I also pull the M-slice 
with my ring finger instead of middle finger, I prefer to have middle 
(and index) finger to hold the cube stable. Anway, I just got 1.33 on 
video and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Also, and more importantly, both 
Bob&#x27;s and your way are way *safer* for me. I used to screw up r2 R2&#x27; a 
lot...

Ah yes, those are the ones I have, too.

Sure it wasn&#x27;t &quot;M3&quot;? But yes, could be &quot;3mm&quot; as well. Usually when 
they use just one size they mean the inside diameter, since the most 
important thing is that the screw or whatever goes through it nicely. 
And you&#x27;ll find things like &quot;M3&quot; for screws, too. Not sure what 
exactly that is, but I don&#x27;t think the &quot;M&quot; stands for millimeters.

          <div class="email-content">M in e.g. M3 = Metric. The 3 (when talking about screws) stands for 3 mm
thread diameter. You may find a lot of other cryptic abbreviations when
searching for standard fasteners. But I will not bore you with such stuff in
this group :) Note that it doesn&#x27;t say anything about what type of e.g.
screw we&#x27;re talking about (socket head, hexagon head etc.)

Ah yes, those are the ones I have, too.

> I have always &#x27;thought&#x27; they were (it is better to say &#x27;called&#x27;) 2mm 
or so because when I bought &#x27;3mm wahers&#x27; in a store, they selled me 
bigger washers than the ones I bought by web.

Sure it wasn&#x27;t &quot;M3&quot;? But yes, could be &quot;3mm&quot; as well. Usually when 
they use just one size they mean the inside diameter, since the most 
important thing is that the screw or whatever goes through it nicely. 
And you&#x27;ll find things like &quot;M3&quot; for screws, too. Not sure what 
exactly that is, but I don&#x27;t think the &quot;M&quot; stands for millimeters.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">I use Firefox and for whatever reason the cubes on lar5.com don&#x27;t show <br>
up. However I also find it frustrating to try and figure an algorithm <br>
out by following a java cube rather than standard notation (e.g. F, R&#x27;, <br>
U&#x27; etc.).<br>
<br>
Is there a place where the Petrus method is documented using standard <br>
notation or is it something I have to learn from the animated cubes?  I <br>
read that the method is something I can work up to as a beginner (again, <br>
using the Jasmine Lee solution set right now with Sune and Anti-Sune for <br>
my corner permutation) to get my cubing faster, perhaps a bit easier to <br>
learn than Fridrich (ack, 100&#x27;s of possible algorithms).<br>
<br>
p.s. Just downloaded cube twister last night. Very impressive!  I tried <br>
Dan Harris&#x27; solution set as put together by nascarjon and it worked <br>
quite nicely. Lots to remember there for the last layer solutions.<br>

I know how you feel, Im learning an advanced method myself. Having
trouble. By the way, you inspired me to make my own movie. Check out
the message board, you&#x27;ll find it there.

Oh by the way, maybe we can help eachother learn the advanced method.
You know, message back and forth when we get confused. Good job on
your new record and average.

job and thank you to thebunze. I believe did the cube fairly quick for
a beginner method, although I was unsuccessful in beating thebunze&#x27;s

I live in Kingston,
As Peter said he lives in Scarborough,
Dave Campell lives somewhere in Toronto,
Matt Walter lives in Sault St. Marie (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong)
Jason Thong I believe is somewhere in Toronto, but not many people
hear from him...
There really aren&#x27;t that many Canadian cubers...I believe there were 6
at the WC...Me, Matt, Dave, Jason, another guy named Patrick that I
don&#x27;t know where he lives and a guy from Montreal named Corey...so...

I know some other cubers that have started lately from around southern
Ontario...so...maybe we could all have a cubing meeting sometime...or
maybe we&#x27;ll wait till the Canadian Championships...

implying fraud, like he did concerning Rhine, that Puthoff and Targ
gave some magic tricks as proof of psychic ability. They did not. 

I gave specific references which Stefan did not check out on his own.
He used heresay to imply fraud by researchers whom he has not himself
checked out.

It is a breach of nettiquete to demand an immediate response. Your
conclusions as to why I haven&#x27;t responded are all products of your
imagination - all make believe. 

Since I met the two previous challenges, I would have thought that you
might have concluded that there were other reasons why I was slow in
responding. I also would have thought that the conservatism I have
shown in my own listing of records on speedcubingdotcom would
recommend me to you as one who doesn&#x27;t make lame excuses, and who
understands standards and proofs.

If there are lame excuses here they are on your side.

>  In the case where something cannot be proven, we

I have not asked you to believe anything. I gave you checkable
references and you ignored them.
I take efforts to keep contexts clear, but it seems you find those
efforts to be tedious, which is probably why you missed that I made no
claim to having psychic powers.

> No one can prove super-human powers, or 
> ESP, 

This is, in fact, false. Some psychic abilities have been shown to
exist. The inability of academia to honestly deal with this is
well-known to many. Remote viewing was successfully demonstrated in a
double blind experiment on national television. 
http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/pub/news/95nov30-dp.html

Proofs have been presented many, many times, and refused publication
with no good reason.

Sorry, but I haven&#x27;t given any excuses.

I was challenged to go to one of several websites and try the game. I
did, and when I reported the result I was immediately misquoted. I was
challenged to &quot;play the game&quot; 100 times, even though the problem
revolves around a single try. I did not get the results I was told I
would get, which means that your side failed to convince me, and on
top of that it was implied that I was lying.

You mistake me for a dancing bear, one who immediately jumps at your
slightest urging. I met two challenges, although I took my time, and
what did I get for my efforts? Ridicule, and now the false accusation
that I was making lame excuses in not meeting challenges.

At the time I presented the result of my multiple tries I was still
thinking that this was a friendly place. I had hoped that my prior
posts here might have given people the idea that I respect people. 
I had hoped that what I posted would lead to interesting conversations.

To many of you here, it&#x27;s been very nice getting you to know you a
little bit, feel free to contact me privately. To the rest, you know
who you are, I just say

Good bye,  

David J

My most stressful solve was when I did a solve for 25,000+ people at 
the Georgia Tech vs. Air Force game. I did horrible. My hands were 
shaking SOOO bad.

Just dont let people see u solving the cube for the whole time. Coz
staring at one thing which u dont understand for about 60 seconds is
boring :(

So make ur slve a little more dramatic...like play some music in the
background or something...or like macky does, do it one handed while
fliping balls with the other hand at the same time.

Do let us know how it goes. And im sure, if u perform with the cube,
atleast 2-3 ppl will get interested enuf to start cubing, and thats
good for the community. So think of it as social work :)

Well, using my simplistic points-based system, at WC2005 the &quot;Top 
Cuber&quot; was actually Leyan Lo (then Chris Hardwick) and &quot;Top Puzzler&quot; 
was Stefan Pochmann (then Alexander Ooms).

Just to spread the votes somewhat i will vote for either Lars 
Vandenbergh or Frank Morris :-) 

I have to eliminate myself because im really bad on 3x3x3 (not too 
interested either, except fewest moves) and i don&#x27;t even have a real 
2x2x2 cube ;-)

Cheers!

I also vote for Lars.  He never left the stage during awards in Orlando.

Except apparently to sneak up on the hostess.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Adam,

I&#x27;m a girl speedcuber.

I&#x27;m a reasonably active cuber, particularly as far as girls go. I&#x27;ve
competed in several official competitions and can solve lots of other
puzzles too, not just the 3×3×3.

I&#x27;ve been part of this yahoo discussion group for many years, but just
haven&#x27;t posted much recently. I used to post A LOT on here, as Stefan&#x27;s
stats showed. (For those who don&#x27;t know to what I&#x27;m referring, Stefan
posted some stats a while ago about the most prolific posters at the
time and I think I was reasonably high up on the list.)

You&#x27;ll find that very few girls are interested in speedcubing, which
means very few girls are active in this group and very few enter
official competitions (or unofficial competitions for that matter).

          <div class="email-content">So basically you&#x27;d like to know which person has had, in average, the
best result, for this year consedering all categories ?
If so, I think you need to figure out something like a &quot;points classification&quot;.
I think it can be easily made, just extend what has already been done
with the 20 best of each category. (of course you&#x27;d have a few
problems you&#x27;d need to handle (for example : not the same number of
competitors in every category)).

If you want to have something more official, I suggest the creation of
a &quot;Cubing Quadriathlon event&quot; or something like (i&#x27;m not sute if the
word wuadriathlon is correct :p) that :p
Though I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;d be a success.

My probably most stressful solve was for that officer when I entered 
the USA for RWC 2005. He asked what I&#x27;m there for, I said &quot;Rubik&#x27;s 
World Championship&quot;, he said &quot;What?&quot; and eventually I showed him a 
solve. I had amnesia for an intuitive F2L alg! Can you beat that?

Cheers!

Personally, I&#x27;m not sure what about cubing makes it such a male

Yes, I live in the Toronto area.  

Just for clarification:
Matt Walter lives in Southampton (nowhere near Sault Ste. Marie for 
the record).
Jason Thong is in Hamilton as far as I know.
Patrick Lam is in Kamloops, BC.

          <div class="email-content">Hi David :-)

I think he probably means 2 and 2 swapped adjacent centers. That 
would leave a swap of 2 corners or swap of 2 edges at the end.

Please tell us in more detail what is ur problem and we can surely 
help u :-)

Hey. A few things.
   
   What I was talking about is http://www.geocities.com/ladartfrog/untitled.jpg
   
  Also -- I encountered another pattern (top layer looks like an H) which took me a while to solve.. anyone know an easier method to solve that?
   
  In case it helps, I use the following algorithms for the last layer:
  F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;  (to solve the cross)
  F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; (to solve the cross)
  L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L U2 ( rotate 3 corners)

  F2 U&#x27; R&#x27; L F2 R L&#x27; U&#x27; F2 (edge switch)
  
Maybe there is a site with a big list of solutions for this? I&#x27;ve looked but can&#x27;t find anything good.

What method are you using to solve? When you are trying to solve
these middle pieces, are all the other pieces on the cube solved?

If you are trying to swap center pieces of two adjacent faces on a
4x4x4 or 5x5x5 without messing up anything else, you can use this
sequence:

r&#x27; D l D&#x27; r D l&#x27; D&#x27;

In this case, lower case letters means to turn the inner slice that is
adjacent to the named face.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Ah ok then i know what u mean :-) It&#x27;s a 2-flip :-)

My easy cure for that is this one (assumimg u know what the E move 
is):

R&#x27; E&#x27; R2 E2 R&#x27; (flips first edge)
U&#x27;............ (positions next edge)
R E2 R2 E R... (flips second edge)
U............. (restores U layer)

To know what the E move is check here :

Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hey -- sorry to be sending so many emails, but I realized that if my edges are at least oriented properly, I can solve them... the only problem I have is when they are rotated. So my real question (my initial one) is how do I rotate edge pieces? Can it be done without affecting the rest of the puzzle, or should the edges not be done last?
   
  Thanks

Also, to flip edges on the LL, I recommend this :
(M&#x27;U) * 4
It will flip the UB and the UL edge + the DB and DF edge.
Just do U moves to choose which edge you want to flip and then do it
again. (the down side will be solved)

          <div class="email-content">Actually I think you are missing an algorithm to permute the corners!
You can use x R&#x27; U R&#x27; D2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R2.

But check Dan Harris&#x27; beginner solution: http://www.cubestation.co.uk/.

If the alg doesn&#x27;t solve the case try the other picture...they may

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I was at the mall shopping for my sister&#x27;s birthday present and there<br>
was this stand set up that sold rubik&#x27;s type stuff...I was looking<br>
around...ended up buying another magic, a homer simpson head, a new<br>
5x5 (hope it turns out good :)) and then the 4x4 below.<br>
<br>
I wasn&#x27;t going to get another 4x4...but all the stuff was 25%<br>
off...and this intrigued me...I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this...It<br>
was a public display, and the case was still closed like it had never<br>
been open, so I don&#x27;t think someone took it out, mixed it, and then<br>
put it back in cuz there are only a few ppl in the world who can do<br>
that (from what I saw with the UFO puzzles at WC)...so can anyone<br>
explain this phenomenon??? Anyone else ever had this happen??? I had<br>
to buy it...and right now the cube is in my garage with lube in<br>
it...when it is done I am going to time the solve...<br>

Any chance you can scale down to less than 2 MB per picture?

  I don&#x27;t know if I understand your method. How would I use it to solve something like the one I posted before, http://www.geocities.com/ladartfrog/untitled.bmp, or like http://www.geocities.com/ladartfrog/2fish.jpg that
   
  I would like to learn your method since it requires almost no memorization.
   
  thanks

  Very nice commutator Per :-)

Also, to flip edges on the LL, I recommend this :
(M&#x27;U) * 4
It will flip the UB and the UL edge + the DB and DF edge.
Just do U moves to choose which edge you want to flip and then do it
again. (the down side will be solved)

IF they are in the UF and UB position, you could do (M&#x27;U)3 U (MU)3 U 

1. You could set this up with (RB), and then do the aformentioned
algorithm. (Do B&#x27;R&#x27; at the end)

2. Or you could do this ELL : (FR&#x27;F&#x27;R)(L&#x27;U)(RU&#x27;M&#x27;)
Then Permute with R2 d&#x27;(M&#x27;U2M) d&#x27;L2

If anyone finds anything really cool for this case, let me know.

peel and curl if the puzzle was left out for display, so they put it 
back in the box.  Maybe?

IF they are in the UF and UB position, you could do (M&#x27;U)3 U (MU)3 U 

1. You could set this up with (RB), and then do the aformentioned
algorithm. (Do B&#x27;R&#x27; at the end)

2. Or you could do this ELL : (FR&#x27;F&#x27;R)(L&#x27;U)(RU&#x27;M&#x27;)
Then Permute with R2 d&#x27;(M&#x27;U2M) d&#x27;L2

If anyone finds anything really cool for this case, let me know.

M refers to the column between L and R.  M turns similarly to L, and
M&#x27; is like an R.

Grouping with parentheses helps to denote which moves should be done
together, either to demonstrate the effects of certain chunks, or for
ease of performing the moves themselves.

The d&#x27; was lowercase because it means the two layers below U. 
Lowercase letters generally refer to double layer turns.

Also, Jason, why don&#x27;t you perform that ELL as (rUR&#x27;)(U&#x27;M)(URU&#x27;R&#x27;)? 
It only uses RUM moves and is super fast.  The inverse is great, too:
(RUR&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U)(RU&#x27;r&#x27;)

          <div class="email-content">Well i still think this sport or hobby, whatever you call it is still
somewhat male oriented.

I&#x27;ll tell you my experience...i am in the process of setting a rubik&#x27;s
cube club at my univ and to that effect i had called a informal
meeting of all those interested in the cube....i had publicised it
quite well and about 25 people showed up which is quite above my
expectations btw. But the real fun thing is that not even a single
female turned up.
 So i think this clearly shows that cubing is not much the liking of
the female population. Also the statistics on this group or in any
cubing competition also show the same results.

But i still cannot understand as to what exactly makes cubing so male
dominated? Is there some genes in males which are more tuned to puzzle
solving or what?

I think you should look into this thing called commutators. Its a very
general principle and you can make algs of your own with it. A very
good page to learn commutators is this
http://grrroux.free.fr/begin/Begin.html

Happy Cubing!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Yes i tend to agree. I have a few of the 2003 version made in russia. 
Maybe the ones made before or after (in Hungary) are a lot better. 
Anyhow it seems like too much work to make a studio cube which will 
turn as nicely as the black diy (from rubiks.com). And it doesn&#x27;t have 
arched centers either. So yes, the studio cubes on sale at ebay seem 
overpriced ...

I can however recommend studio 4x4x4 cubes :-)

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I have heard those things before, that the cube is NOT a puzzle. The 
reason given wass that you simply follow steps that u know 
beforehand. That the cube is not a puzzle because it has several 
solved states sounds a bit lame: too theoretical and far fetched. 
Anyhow, maybe one could say that the cube is a puzzle only as long 
as u work it all out by urself, and that until the solving 
becomes &quot;mechanical&quot; it remains a puzzle and after that only a toy ?

Whether the cube is a toy or a puzzle is not really so interesting. 
One can still have heaps of fun with it. It gets more intriguing the 
more u learn about it ;-)

Cheers!

-Per

PS! The normal 3x3x3 cube has (4^6)/2 = 2048 &quot;solved states&quot;. It&#x27;s 
impossible to turn a singular center 90 degrees.

that I&#x27;ve never re-assembled a 4x4x4 before, but I&#x27;d give it a go. I&#x27;ve<br>
put it back together now, but jeez, it was not easy! Solving the 4x4x4<br>

Sorry about the Notation.   I forget that beginners don&#x27;t know the
Notation.  

SOmeone posted earlier to look on Gilles ROux page under beginner&#x27;s
method.  David, your case is the 2nd example, so it&#x27;s perfect.  I
don&#x27;t know how you solve the cube, but I dont suggest learning the
beginners method posted there.  Just learn the ROUx method. Very
little to memorize...

M&#x27;U M&#x27;U M&#x27; U2  M U M U M U2 (M&#x27; is pushing, M is pulling)

Look under beginners method for your case
and under &#x27;my method&#x27; for how to cube
and under intro for notation

          <div class="email-content">There is something I wanted to do :
At the english class, we had to talk for a few minutes about an object
we use daily.
Of course, I took the cube.
But for some reason the teacher put me with another student and I had
to talk about the iMac G5 :s

However, what I had planned was this :
Show it solved to the class at the beginning, describing it, and then
showing them how to scramble it. And then I was supposed to talk about
competitions, different approaches of the cube (FMC, speed, one
handed,..) and solve it one-handed at the same time. (Because when I
talk, especially to a large audience, I use my hands to speak)

But thinking about it now, it&#x27;d have been a bit difficult. :s

Have fun !

I had to post.  Because of me, there are 6 more women that can
independently solve the cube.  My Mom, 2 sisters, 2 friends, and my 10
 year old cousin (proudest achievement).  

I taught them F2L using 1 simple sequence (RURU&#x27;), its mirror and
inverses(L&#x27;U&#x27;LU) (URU&#x27;R&#x27;)(U&#x27;L&#x27;UL).

1. Solve Cross ( 2 step process, Orient on Opposite center)
2. Place Corners using (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)or(L&#x27;U&#x27;LU)
3. Place middle layer edges using (URU&#x27;R&#x27;)y&#x27;(U&#x27;L&#x27;UL)

Then I just taught them a simple 4 look, Petrus style approach

1. Orient Edges F(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;) F&#x27; or F(URU&#x27;R&#x27;)F&#x27;
2. Position Corners with Niklas (RU&#x27;)(L&#x27;U)(R&#x27;U&#x27;L)
3. Orient Corners with Sunes and Antisunes
4. Position Edges (R2U)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(R&#x27;U&#x27;)(R&#x27;UR&#x27;) and R2 d&#x27;(M&#x27;U2M)d&#x27; L2

the Best part of all was that I taught all of them using no notation.
 Everything just had a name.  There are really only 5 sequences to
learn. 9 if you count inverses and mirrors.


Sorry about big posting

Jason Kovacic

PS.

I have also taught my Brother and my friend Troy.
Everyone was given a choice of either Corners 1st or Cross (Demonstrated).

Both males chose corners 1st
5 females chose cross
1 female learned both  

kind of interesting...

<br>
how many of you out there know multiple methods?  On Speedcubing.com,<br>
the record is like 11 methods for under 3 minutes.<br>
What actually constitutes a separate method, and not just a variant?<br>
I think I know 6 systems for speedcubing...<br>
<br>
CFOP                         25.48, 21.62<br>
Xcross OLL PLL               23.75, 21.09<br>
Petrus (3x2x2 Orient Edges)  26.12, (33.48)<br>
Varasano Corners             25.81, 30.12<br>
Waterman Corners             31.20, 25.03<br>
ROUX                         (19.69), 21.31<br>
<br>
AVG 25.15<br>
<br>
None of these times are spectacular, but i am happy with them.  I&#x27;m<br>
gladmthat my Roux solves were the fastest, as it is my main method.  <br>
<br>
Petrus is my slowest system; Expanding to 3x2x2 is hard for me.<br>
Howerver, I do use full color neutrality for petrus solves; It&#x27;s is<br>
easier than it sounds.<br>

Chess has had the same discussion for generations.  The only thing I think 
you can say is that individually there is no reason for either sex to be 
better than the other (personally I&#x27;d say the Polgars - especially Judith - 
have demonstrated this in chess) even thought there might be good reasons - 
social or otherwise - for men to be more interested.

Was it an Eastheen 4x4x4 or a Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4?

About 6 months ago my Eastheen 4x4x4 popped for the first time. Then 
I decided to disassemble all the pieces. I can remember that it was 
a nightmare for me to re-assemble it again. Probably it took me 
hours, also because I really didn&#x27;t know how to start. Re-assembling 
a Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4 is much easier!

For an Eastheen 4x4x4 you can maybe use this link:

I would complain and ask them send some for free :-)

Or, bring the parts u need to a hardware store and find the best 
machine screw urself :-) U really only need the core/spindle and 1 
center for this. Possibly one spring also ...

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Even i had the same problem.

The thing is Ron gave me one of his used Rubik 4x4 and i practised it
like hell that night. And sure enuf, pieces kept popping out. But in
one solve, the whole cube totally crumbled in my hands. So i got a
good look at the mechanism and tried to reassemble it. At that time i
had a friend with me in my room so i asked him to hold the 4x4 for me
while i put the pieces in. But he thought it would be much more fun to
watch me fight over it.

So there i was, trying to hold the incomplete 4x4 in one hand and
searching for pieces with the other hand while trying to dodge from my
friend trying to hit the unstable structure with cubies :)

But finally it was over and i was very happy that i could do it. Now
im waiting for my 5x5 to arrive so that i may pry it open to see its
mechanism.

I think a mailing list is a terrible place for this... better check

Yeah, really good to steal their opportunity to find a solution on 
their own and be proud of their achievement.

Haha, you turned it into a video... Dude, isn&#x27;t that harder than just 
resizing it as pictures? What operating system do you use? In Windows 
XP I do this:

double-click it
CTRL-E
CTRL-K
20 TAB 20 ENTER
ALT-F4 ENTER

That takes about 5-10 seconds. And the result is this 37 kb picture:
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/craig.jpg

And to answer your question: There&#x27;s nothing mysterious about it. It&#x27;s 
extremely easy to open and close it without damaging it at all.

Cheers!
Stefan

The package was still sealed like any other package you would get, and
when I took the cube out it didn&#x27;t look or feel like anyone had
tampered with it...but w/e...it was intriguing...

Hmm, then maybe you have a different shortcut for &quot;image&quot;->&quot;scale&quot; (or 
similar... I have the German edition).

Hmm... &quot;sealed&quot; ?!? What do you mean, since when are they sealed? Here 
you can see a sealed Magic:

I think I knew what you meant. But I bet there&#x27;s no glue at the places 
where you should open it.

Do you have a &quot;buy it now&quot; option, either ebay-run or self-run? 

For example, I&#x27;d like to get a megaminx and a black magic, but I&#x27;m 
not a big ebay user. If I said &quot;I&#x27;ll send you cash/check for 
&lt;some_reasonable_amount> plus shipping costs&quot; would you just sell em 
to me (or whoever asks) rather than have the ebay auction?

Or, do you do well enough on the auctions that it&#x27;s worth it to run 
them?

curious,

          <div class="email-content">Does anyone know how I could obtain one of the hot pepper cubes that <br>
were given away at the WC05 after-party?  I was there, but was <br>
evidently busy stuffing my face with food when those cubes were <br>
handed out.  These are the cubes from the Japanese snack company <br>
Tohato, and they picture a jack-o-lantern hot pepper on each face.  <br>
Apparently they are fairly challenging since each face uses the same <br>
scheme.  I&#x27;ve seen videos of Yuki Hayashi and Katsuyuki Konishi <br>
solving it, and they take considerably longer than their normal <br>
solving times!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I&#x27;ve checked on the Tohato site and eBay but I haven&#x27;t seen <br>
any for sale.  If someone has an extra, or wants to sell theirs, <br>
please let me know.  Thanks!<br>
<br>
Chris Pelley<br>
<br>
P.S.  The week before WC05, I had an idea for a &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Magic <br>
Pumpkin&quot; puzzle that would be similar to the Homer Head or Darth <br>
Maul 2x2 cubes.  But the idea I had was that when it was in the <br>
solved position, the eyes of the pumpkin would light up or something <br>
like that.  So it would be like a jack-o-lantern cube.  So when I <br>
spotted the Tohato cubes at WC05, I was quite surprised!  I guess <br>
it&#x27;s not that big of a coincidence since WC05 was the week after <br>
Halloween.<br>

That&#x27;s just a matter of semantics but anyway by this definition you can just say you&#x27;re 
solving a puzzle on the quotient space of the supercube group. :  )
(Then two cubes would be identified if they only differed in centre orientation so it would 
be a puzzle in that sense, albeit only for the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3.)

I agree to a large extent with what Tyson said (about it not being a puzzle, at least for 
most of the people here). At least in the sense it is not a puzzle to solve it - but in the 
sense of the of the theory behind it, there&#x27;s still a lot to know. Maybe that&#x27;s not a puzzle 
though.

For scaling multiple images you can use the ImageResizer PowerToy:

No, sorry, no buy-it-now. One thing I really like about Ebay is that I 
don&#x27;t have to make up a price, I can let the market decide and thus 
get a fair market price. Selling directly only results in me feeling 
bad, either because I&#x27;m ripping someone off or because I could get 
more in an auction.

In the past I&#x27;ve also used a reserve price a few times, I started it 
because I panicked when a valuable puzzle didn&#x27;t have any bid after 2 
days or so. But now I don&#x27;t want to do that anymore, it only distorts 
the picture and I want to let the market decide.

And in many cases I&#x27;m curious to know what an puzzle is worth, i.e. 
what it is worth to other people, for example those that I prepare for 
speedsolving, but also the rare ones.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">In the same way that a Rubik&#x27;s cube is a puzzle, so also is a Sudoku.  Just as you learn an algorithm to accomplish a certain task on the cube, you learn to &quot;cross-hatch&quot; or draw lines on a Sudoku to limit a number to a square.  In any puzzle you must use some algorithm, very easy and unnoticable or sequential and essential as for the cube, to accomplish tasks.  In a jigsaw puzzle, I begin with the corners (an algorithm that helps me figure out the outline) and I search the unplaced pieces for one that matches the picture and cutouts (another algorithm, even though it is an obvious one).
   
  I dont think just because there exists a large number of algorithms to accomplish different tasks that the cube can no longer be called a puzzle.  The puzzle is figuring out which algorithm to use in a certain situation.  If that holds, even speedsolving is still a form of puzzle-solving.  Regardless, the first step for solving the cube (like making a cross) is still a puzzle.

          <div class="email-content">Hey -- Jason, you said that I should learn the ROUx method... so you recommend just going to http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html and learning the method there?
   
  I am just getting to the point where I can solve the cube consistently without having to look at any references (thanks to the help provided by many of you who have answered my questions in the past few days). My method is:

-Solve first 2 layers
  -Solve the cross of the bottom layer
  -Get the LL corners in the right place
  -Get the LL corners rotated correctly
  -Switch any incorrect corners
   
  I am starting to get pretty good at this, but I know there is little I can do besides getting faster with my algorithms and cutting down time doing the first layer. I can do it in about 4 minutes usually, but I want to start learning more advanced methods.
   
  I&#x27;m not looking to be the best cuber ever or anything, but I would like to at least get my average down to 90 seconds or 2 minutes.
   
  What are the most common methods that you guys use, how difficult are they to learn and use, and how fast are they?
   
  thanks!!

Original cube by EvilTron, I take no credit for the work. I only made
it spin a bit differently.

I didn&#x27;t think that my 10 year old cousin would figure out the cube on
her own.  So I taught her.  She payed attention and learned in 2 days.
   Only 9 different sequences.  No Notation.

I am proud of her for learning the cube.
I am proud of myself for teaching her, as well as 5 others, with 2
different approaches and no written notation.

You *thought* so. And now we (and more importantly she) will never 
know. I myself am quite sad I&#x27;ll never know whether I would&#x27;ve been 
able to find a solution myself, if I remember correctly I got a 
solution with my first cube when I was about 6 and sadly nobody 
encouraged me to try it on my own first.

Why waste the opportunity?

Recently a friend of mine became interested and found a solution 
himself. Took him two months, and it wasn&#x27;t the most efficient method, 
but he did it. He resisted getting any help, I resisted giving any 
help. That&#x27;s what *I* am proud of. But yeah, I know I&#x27;m quite lonely 
with that attitude.

          <div class="email-content">Are you sure? It seems like it would be absolutely ridiculous to cut down the time that much. Even if I did no thinking or looking at the cube at all, but instead just always knew exactly which algorithm to use instantly, I think the way I&#x27;m doing it now would still take over a minute...
   
  any other thoughts? 
   
  And even so, I&#x27;ll eventually want to start getting more advanced and using some of the methods that you guys use... the methods which allow you to do cubes in 20 seconds.
   
  For the time being, I&#x27;m looking for any methods which are slightly faster than my current method, but I&#x27;d rather not try to learn any of the hardest methods first.
   
  Let me know.. thanks!

  I am just getting to the point where I can solve the cube consistently without having to look at any references (thanks to the help provided by many of you who have answered my questions in the past few days). My method is:

-Solve first 2 layers
  -Solve the cross of the bottom layer
  -Get the LL corners in the right place
  -Get the LL corners rotated correctly
  -Switch any incorrect corners
   
  I am starting to get pretty good at this, but I know there is little I can do besides getting faster with my algorithms and cutting down time doing the first layer. I can do it in about 4 minutes usually, but I want to start learning more advanced methods.
   
  I&#x27;m not looking to be the best cuber ever or anything, but I would like to at least get my average down to 90 seconds or 2 minutes.
   
  What are the most common methods that you guys use, how difficult are they to learn and use, and how fast are they?
   
  thanks!!

When I first got a cube (when i was 7 or so), The furthest I could get
was to orient all of the white pieces to the white center.  &quot; I got
the white side!&quot;

I didnt know that there were 20 pieces; 8 corners and 12 edges.
I had no idea that the pieces all had to be in a certain place.
I didn&#x27;t even realize at that point that the centers were stationary.
I didn&#x27;t understand the opposite colors.    

I learned a corners 1st method by Jeff Varasano from a book.  So he
taught me in esscence.  i don&#x27;t think that I would have gotten it on
my own. My First Big Alg [(R&#x27;&lt;)(R2 >>) (R&#x27; U2 R) (>> R2 > R) U2] 

My 10 year old cousin got a cube last year for Xmas and has been
working on it with little success for a year.  I promise, i didn&#x27;t
deprive her of anything by teaching her.  

I do agree w/ you, Stephan, about learning things on your own.  I have
tried to do this as much as possible with F2L, but sometimes seeing a
new shorter way to do a Pair will help out.  I defenitely don&#x27;t
believe in memorizing written sequences for F2L.


Thats why I like Gille&#x27;s Method.  very little Memorization.  Lots of
intuition. And lots of (R r U M) moves, of course.

          <div class="email-content">I was around 19 when i took the cube for solving it seriously. I kept
working on it for a whole 3 months(i had my summer holidays going on)
... i only saw one algo on the net to flip two corners but then i
realised that this is cheating so i started to work on my own
solution. I did somethinglike a corners first method with solving the
two opposite layers and then doing the middle layer at the end,

I remember very vividly, i was in the train once when i &quot;discovered&quot;
the sune algorithm. I was just playing around with the corner edge
pair and i thougt of putting them a little differently and then
suddenly the corners were all oriented! I was very proud of myself
that time.

I had gotten really stuck in the last two edge pairs. I just couldnt
orient them correctly. So when one day when i was playing with the
cube, the  pieces popped out, I just put them back together and solved
them. Then i realised that i had put the btm layer edge wrongly...so i
put it back correctly adn then solved it. But in the mean time the two
middle layer pieces had oriented them correctly! So i gave it some
thought and my method at that time was to purposefully incorrectly
orient the btm layer edge piece and them do a middle layer turn and
again solve it. Now that i look back upon it, it seems to be just
horribly inefficient, but i was still very proud of myself :)

Btw ppl dont hijack the topic...lets stick to the original thread :)

is necessarily a good start for speedcubing but the satisfaction is worth 
the effort.  I was very surprised when I took the cube up again in 2003 that 
most people in this forum didn&#x27;t solve it for themselves.  Having said that 
I think general puzzle solving techniques and experience are important (in 
life generally!) and if you start to learn them by being taught how to solve 
the cube well thats good experience too.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine !

I worked out the solution all by myself back in 1981. I was 16 yrs 
old at the time. Like you i seem to remember that the last layer was 
what i struggled with.

My very first method i neeeded to &quot;restart&quot; 5 or 6 times over and in 
some myterious ways i then solved the cube in about 10 mins or so. 
This was before i discovered how to construct genuine 3-cycles. 

Gaining insight into constructing cycles skyrocketed my cubing. 
Quite soon my times were down to 40 secs or so.

Whether a newbie cuber should go through the pain and agony of 
working it all out by himself/herself i leave up to the individual. 
But surely if someone asks me for help i won&#x27;t hesitate to give it. 
I won&#x27;t &quot;overrule&quot; the decision of that individual to not figure it 
out by himself/herself ;-)

I don&#x27;t believe that having been taught (parts of) a method is 
necessarily bad for &quot;cube-understanding&quot;. Those who not learn all 
all on his/her own are probably not interested in the &quot;deeper&quot; 
understanding of the cube. They just want to be able to &quot;solve that 
thing&quot; ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Sub-60s is definitely possible with a 4-look LL. I used to solve with a
4-look LL and didn&#x27;t really bother learning more LL algorithms until I
got my average under 60s.

It&#x27;s possible to go much faster than 60s with 4-look LL. I&#x27;ve seen
people do 30s solves with a 4-look LL!

Are you solving with F2L pairs? If not then I&#x27;d advise that would be a
very valuable next step. F2L pairs are not that difficult to work out on
your own and they&#x27;ll really improve your solve times once you get the
hang of them.

BTW, re working stuff out on your own (just referring to another
discussion string on the group), I feel pretty strongly about this with
regard to the F2L. Even now I never use an F2L trick unless I understand
exactly how it works. :)

Way to go, Jason!  It&#x27;s good to see someone having success with
something that isn&#x27;t Fridrich.  I&#x27;ve been working more on my variation
for step 4 where you first place DB as you orient edges, and then
permute the L5E.  So far, it&#x27;s very much like learning ZB.  Right now,
my average with pure Roux is around 20, but my normal average this way
is about 22.  My best times are 15.0x this way (non lucky), though, so
it has very good spike times.  I expect this number to grow
substantially once I learn more algs.

One strategy I&#x27;m experimenting with that could be useful to you (or
other Roux solvers) is learning both COLL and CLL.  This would allow
you O6E skips twice as often, and give you the three edges orientation
for the majority of the rest of solves.

Also, I&#x27;ve been trying to recognize the orientation before the end of
step 2.  If you save either the DL or DR edge piece for last, you can
use it to help influence orientation to your liking.  If you have a
corner edge pair for last, you can use those too, with some intuitive
ZBF2L.  This is a little harder, but will be more useful in the end.

That said, learning one step algs for corners is going to help your
times, but not all that much.  The F2B and L6E steps are much more
important.  You can get very good times still using only two step algs
for the corners.

Learning to use unconstrained centers and the special cases for step 4
will probably get you farther in the end than CLL.  I say in the end
because those are probably going to take a long time to get used to,
but they will be worth it.

Keep up the good work, and keep us posted!

-Mike

Sub-17 is possible with a 4 look.  I promise. :)  Sub-24 on average is
possible, too.

When you get very good at a 4 look, the odds to skip steps is very
high.  The way I perform it, the odds for a skipped step are about
41%.  So it&#x27;s more of a 3.5 look.

F2L is key.  You&#x27;ll never get sub-20 if your F2L times are 30.xx.  But
you can still get sub-20&#x27;s if your LL times are crap.

Like I said, sub-24 on average is possible with a 4 look.  I advise
everyone to learn F2L (CFOP, Petrus, etc) before they even think about
learning a 3 look.

Can you tell about that way you perform it? Usually it&#x27;s only about 
35.6%.

OE, PC, OC, PE.  1/8 + 1/6 + 1/27 + 1/12 = 89/216 (~41%)

And if that&#x27;s wrong, I&#x27;d like to blame my 4th grade teacher. ;)

For 4x4 reducing it to 3x3, you have those two parity problems. Each 
has 50% chance of skipping. Does that mean you have 50%+50%=100% 
chance of skipping one of them? Btw, cool that you learn probability 
in 4th grade already! Too bad your teacher screwed it :-)

No.  I learned adding fractions using common denominators.  And I
realize there is some overlap because some cases will have two or more
skips in them, but I was unsure how to factor that in.  Would you
please explain how?  That would be very helpful. I&#x27;m trying to work
out some probabilities like that for an idea I&#x27;ve had about the Roux
step 4.

No, I won&#x27;t just explain it, that&#x27;s not my style of teaching :-)

Instead, let me ask you questions: What is the real probability to 
skip at least one of those two parity problems for the 4x4? Why is it 
not 100% like I get for adding 50%+50%? What&#x27;s the correct way to 
compute it? Then apply this knowledge to your 4-step LL.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">The probability that you don&#x27;t any step is:
7/8*5/6*26/27*11/12 = 5005/7776

So the probability that you skip at least one step is:
1-5005/7776 = 2771/7776 ~ 35.6%

That&#x27;s enough explanation for me.<br>
<br>
Is it 75%?  50% of the time you get one parity, and 50% of the time<br>
you don&#x27;t get it, you get the other.<br>
<br>
7/8 * 31/108 .251<br>
5/6 * 51/648 .065<br>

11/12 * 7/24 .267<br>
------------ ----<br>
             1.16<br>
So, dividing 41% by 1.16 we get ~35%.<br>

Yes, you did get it right. I just believe telling someone the answer 
right away is the cheap way out, especially when he could just as well 
find it out himself and learn something by doing so. Telling the 
answer doesn&#x27;t make you a good teacher, it makes you a *lazy* teacher. 
Though, your question seems to indicate that you weren&#x27;t sure about 
your solution yourself, so I&#x27;m not blaming you for writing it ;-)

Have a look at these:

That&#x27;s correct. Can you write it as a concise formula?

Hmm, that stuff looks like mystery to me :-)

Oh, and on this page there&#x27;s another excerpt from the book:

Scroll down about a page (though that part is interesting, too!) and 
read the &quot;TUTORING EXAMPLE&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">Right on.  F2L pairs is your definite next step.  I was using your method
and picked up Fridrich in manageable chunks using the following steps:

I learned F2L pairs from Fridrich&#x27;s site and stuck to the 4LLL until I had a
consistent sub 30 time on F2L.  F2L pairs is easy to learn on its own
because you can set each algorithm up to practice quickly.  I didn&#x27;t move on
from each algorithm until I really understood how it worked.  That helps a
ton in reducing your decision making time for each pair.

Then I created a sort of 3 look LL method by orienting edges first using my
old method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and permute the LL.
There are only 6 Fridrich LL orientation algorithms where all edges are
already oriented, so it seemed like a good small chunk to learn, instead of
trying to memorize all 41 or w/e at once.  I had to break the Fridrich
method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-)  But I went from 3
min. solves using your method to sub 60 very quickly.

.50 + (.50*.50) = .75

Px + (Pnotx*Py) = .75
where P is probability

Is that right at least? :)

The first numbers were all the probabilities of not getting a skip in
a particular step, the second numbers are the probabilities of getting
 a skip in the other steps, and the farthest to the right numbers are
the results from each line.  The 648 was a common denominator (read: I
was too lazy to find a nicer common multiple for 24 and 27).  And
this, kids, is why Mike is not a math major.

Yep. Can you also show a concise formula for three things, i.e. x, y 
and z?

Those second numbers are computed with your initial wrong method, 
though :-). Try answering the x/y/z question above first.

Hehe, there&#x27;s a real nice way to find the least common multiple, 
worthwile to find it :-)

          <div class="email-content">I was something like 7 or 8 when I picked up a cube for the first
time. I tried doing it color by color, though after a while I did
understand that when I finished a side all the colors had to line up
with the center pieces of the adjacent sides. So I figured out how to
do one layer, and at one point managed to get two sides solved, but
then, of course, couldn&#x27;t get any further without messing up the
progress I&#x27;d made.

After a few years that first Rubik&#x27;s cube got lost (though I found a
few pieces of it in an old toy box last year and I&#x27;m still wondering
what happened to it), and I didn&#x27;t pick it up again until I started my
freshman year at Caltech, when I figured out a very inefficient method
to do the first two layers. I finally consulted a website for help on
the last layer, though initially I skipped over the part about the
middle layer, so I kept using my own method for a while. Which
explains why the first timed solves I recorded were on the order of
the time it takes me to do a 4x4 now (and I&#x27;m still pretty slow at that).

I gave my brother a cube for Christmas, and I let him play with it for
a while before attempting to teach him a solution. Not only is it more
satisfying to see how much you can figure out on your own, it&#x27;s also
easier to learn a solution when you have a slightly better
understanding of what&#x27;s going on and not just applying movesets blindly.

          <div class="email-content"><br>
in another thread, someone was asking about how old were cubers when <br>
they figured it out on their own (without being taught or reading <br>
from a book).  <br>
<br>
I was 11, well actually almost 12.  did it during summer break back <br>
in 1981.  There wasn&#x27;t anyone else I knew that could do it, though I <br>
had one friend (who was at the time basically my only friend) who <br>
was a little interested in trying to figure it out, but not quite as <br>
obsessed as I was.  <br>
<br>
Figuring it out took an awful lot of patience and thinking and trial <br>
and error--basically, my whole summer.  Obviously, there would not <br>
be anywhere near as many cubers if we restricted it to only those <br>
who actually figured it out on their own--sure, many people can <br>
figure it out, but how many have the time or interest or <br>
determination to figure it out?  But only those who have figured it <br>
out on their own know the feeling you get when you can put those <br>
last couple of pieces of the puzzle back in place without any help.  <br>
<br>
It was a real confidence booster and a watershed point in my life.  <br>
In the 6th grade, I was a loner, a wallflower, very shy, <br>
introverted, and very much a nerd.  I ate my sack lunch by myself <br>
then went to the library.  I didn&#x27;t talk to or play with other kids <br>
at recess.  Then 7th grade started, and when people found out I <br>
could solve the cube, they wanted a demonstration so I would solve <br>
it for them at lunch--eventually I started to charge people 25 cents <br>
to do it, and kids would gather round and watch and I guess it was <br>
basically what I needed to come out of my shell a little, and that <br>
year I stopped staring at the floor all the time and started to have <br>
confidence in myself and I formed many very good friendships (though <br>
ironically none of my friends ever really did learn how to solve the <br>
cube).  You can look at pictures of me from the 6th to the 7th and <br>
you can see a real transformation.  Maybe it would have happened <br>
without the cube, or would have been just the same if I had just <br>
learned how to do it from someone else, but it was definitely a <br>
catalyst.<br>
<br>
My method was just a simple layer by layer, with a few algs for what <br>
we would call a 4 look LL.  I could get the F2L very early on, but <br>
the LL is what took me most of the summer to figure out.  By the <br>
time school started 7th grade I could do it in about a minute and a <br>
half.<br>
<br>
I think I was lucky the internet wasn&#x27;t around back then, becuase I <br>
probably would have just looked up some solution and learned it, and <br>
I&#x27;m glad I did it on my own.  <br>
<br>
But I never would have become a speedcuber if I hadn&#x27;t looked up <br>
other algs on the Internet and learned from others, so you could say <br>
that deprived me of the chance to become a speedcuber on my own, and <br>
that&#x27;s just fine with me...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah I&#x27;ve wondered that a lot myself.  My older cousin (who was 
already a college professor) wrote down a few notes for me only about 
2 days after I got my first cube.  He had figured it out on his own, 
taking about three months.  A few days later I could solve it myself.  
So I&#x27;ll never know how far I would&#x27;ve gotten on my own.  I did solve 
the 4x4, 5x5 on my own, but I just extended the 3x3 corners-first 
method so that doesn&#x27;t count.  Megaminx doesn&#x27;t really count either 
since so much knowledge is transferrable.

I did solve Square-1 on my own, and it took me almost two years!  Of 
course I didn&#x27;t work on it continuously during that time.  So I 
imagine I might have licked the 3x3 eventually.

Learning a radically different method can be almost like starting 
over.  I know when I began learning F2L after being a corners-first 
guy for so long, it was almost like a whole new puzzle.  (Yes, PUZZLE!)

What&#x27;s that alg? I mean, 3.09 isn&#x27;t fast, but if I remember correctly 
you also said an edge-3-cycle takes you 3 seconds ;-)

  Right on.  F2L pairs is your definite next step.  I was using your method
and picked up Fridrich in manageable chunks using the following steps:

I learned F2L pairs from Fridrich&#x27;s site and stuck to the 4LLL until I had a
consistent sub 30 time on F2L.  F2L pairs is easy to learn on its own
because you can set each algorithm up to practice quickly.  I didn&#x27;t move on
from each algorithm until I really understood how it worked.  That helps a
ton in reducing your decision making time for each pair.

Then I created a sort of 3 look LL method by orienting edges first using my
old method and using Fridrich to orient the corners and permute the LL.
There are only 6 Fridrich LL orientation algorithms where all edges are
already oriented, so it seemed like a good small chunk to learn, instead of
trying to memorize all 41 or w/e at once.  I had to break the Fridrich
method into reasonable chunks to keep from giving up. :-)  But I went from 3
min. solves using your method to sub 60 very quickly.

<br>
 <br>
<br>
First of all, thanks to everyone who took part in the Christmas Challenge<br>
FMC! I have a lot of entries to deal with, and I will promise to post the<br>
results on the FMC page sometime tomorrow morning :) There were lots of<br>
great solutions as always!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Finally, FMC#102 will be launched at midnight tonight, falling back down to<br>
earth after the novelties of the TeamFMC100 and then the Christmas<br>
Challenge, with a regular FMC scramble. All you have to do is solve the<br>
scramble in as least moves as possible! All are welcome, and it is always<br>
great to have new people on board! Yes, that includes all you speedcubers<br>
too!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Good Luck!<br>
<br>
 <br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I agree with you mike, CMLL isn&#x27;t everything. I broke the 25avg
barrier by just optimising how I did my F2B. Now I&#x27;m after sub-20 :) I
find that CMLL sometimes slows me down, as I know 60% of it, but I&#x27;m
not &#x27;fluent&#x27; with every case I know yet.

I think the F2B is the most important part, then comes LSEC and then
CMLL :) Well, that in ordedr of how much I think I could improve each
bit :)

Thanks, Thom.

I wrote about this about a month ago.  I got rivets only, adn
unassembled corner pieces.  I wrote someone at RUBik&#x27;s.com and he said,
&quot;
I&#x27;m sorry the DIY kit was incorrect, we have had some problems with a
factory in China that seems to keep making mistakes like this (now
fired !).
As soon as we get replacemrents we will send you a new kit free of charge.
Wishing you a great holiday.
Best wishes
Dave
Rubik&#x27;s.
&quot;

Who KNOWS when they&#x27;ll get replacements?

          <div class="email-content">I had the same exact problem. I recieved my kit 2 fridays before
christmas, I discovered the problem with the screws and I emailed them
saturday. They told me about their factory problem and that they would
send the replacement screws on monday via &quot;air mail&quot;. Now I&#x27;m still
not clear as to what air mail is because I didn&#x27;t get them by friday
and since UPS operates only on business days (or so I&#x27;m told), there
was no way I was getting the screws before christmas. I was
disappointed because I was going away for vacation and I wanted
something to do on the long plane ride. Anyhow, I got back from
vacation 8 days later and the screws still haven&#x27;t come. So I&#x27;m not
exactly sure what this &quot;air mail&quot; is since it&#x27;s not the usual shipping
that you pay for. I wonder if the screws are coming in a regular
letter envelope via regular mail.

Oy, I had high expectations for my 1st experience with Rubiks.com but
they let me down.

I&#x27;m still waiting for the screws.

Tyson Mao wrote a really great tutorial a few weeks ago.  You should
check it out.

Unfortunately, when I search for anything remotely resembling his
post, I get no results.  I recall that it was under an odd subject,
and it wasn&#x27;t the beginning of the thread.  If anyone (Tyson included)
has any idea how to find it, please post it.

now that you mention him, it sounded familiar, and on macky&#x27;s page,

Hello Everyone

mike, thanks for the encouragement.  i read your post and wondered
about f2b

10.78, 12.87, 12.31, (23.53), 12.99, 12.65, 18.17, 12.94, 11.17,
11.41, 13.18, (10.68)                  AVG 12.85

This is a pretty good improvement, but i wont be happy until i&#x27;m sub
10. On the 23.53, I had a really bad first b.  For the 2nd block, i
did both pairs first and then FORCED myself to do a new alg Gilles
showed me.  

R&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U R2 U&#x27; R&#x27;

y M&#x27; U2 M y&#x27;

Ur&#x27;R&#x27;UM&#x27;U&#x27;R2


The last one is Gilles&#x27; 
Which one do you guys use?

And Question 2, do you guys use (U R r M) only for B2?
I almost exclusively use these subsets for B2. Because of this, I
usually use the first algorithm

Question 3.  if you learn CLL or COLL instead of CMLL, then you dont
have to have the cube oriented for step 3.  In this case I think the
2nd alg is the best, b/c you don&#x27;t have to do the last y&#x27;.  Do you
guys do Y rotations during F2B?  i dont.

> 11.41, 13.18, (10.68)                  AVG 12.85

Now you&#x27;ve got me curious.  I took an average just now, and I can&#x27;t
say I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I wish it were a second or two less.

11.43, 9.26, 11.78, 13.62, (8.37), (15.14), 9.09, 14.87, 10.90, 12.43,
13.01, 10.31 = 11.67 average

I&#x27;ve learned two important things: The first, I&#x27;m terrible at building
the F2B when there isn&#x27;t an obvious start.  I need to work on being
more flexible.  If there isn&#x27;t a corner edge pair, I don&#x27;t do as well.
 If one is there, though, I get good times.  I also tend to hurry too
much when I don&#x27;t have a solid start planned.  I need to work on
slowing down and staying calm.

Also, I make far too many rotations during my F2B.  I generally build
the first block in front, because it allows for easy RULMd algs.  If I
could learn to make the blocks on L and R I&#x27;m sure it could be faster.

My goal for the F2B is sub-9.  I know it can be done, and really
shouldn&#x27;t take all that much work.  The trick is seeing my fewest
moves solution in the 15 seconds...

Wow.  That&#x27;s a great trick!  I&#x27;m going to have to steal that.  This
leads to an interesting point.  You can use the last pair or edge to
influence the orientation to your liking, often avoiding that step
altogether, and even more often achieving the easy 3 edges on top
situation.  It&#x27;s not always as easy to see, because of the corners,
but it can be done, I think.


In the end, I would also like to be able to use tricks to influence
either (or both) the edge orientation or the corner case.  For 7/32
of cases, you can use what amounts to a VH or ZBF2L alg to orient the
U edges only.  For the other 24 unoriented cases, you can try for a
better orientation (such as the 3 edges scenario).

Also, has anyone looked into placing the UF and UB edges after
orienting?  A lot of times, this is much easier than trying for UL and
UR, but I don&#x27;t know if the decision between the two can be made fast
enough.  Using this and unconstrained centers (solving slowly, because
I can&#x27;t speedsolve that way yet), you can achieve almost optimal L6E
solutions most of the time.  I tried this for hours earlier and the
nastiest case I found was 19 moves to fix.  Only a few sub-10 though.

Another thing to try is placing DB while orienting the edges.  This
can usually be done in 7 moves or less.  After that, you&#x27;re left with
5 edges to possibly permute.  1/5 of the time, it&#x27;s a simple edge PLL,
around 1/10 of the time it&#x27;s a 3 edge cycle in a slice, and the rest
of the time, it&#x27;s just two 3 cycles.  The average using only MU moves
is around 7, but better if you&#x27;re smart about solving the DB edge.
Consulting my trusty list of algs for DB and placing using only a
couple algs and some intuition, I averaged 13.9 moves to finish the
edges this way.  I imagine with the full list of L5E algs, and
influencing orientation with the last pair or edge and the corners,
this could be reduced to around 12.  Perhaps less.

Also, while I highly advocate using MU type algs, I&#x27;ve recently
discovered some simple special cases that I think are useful to learn.
 When all but three pieces are placed and oriented, and two of the
wrong pieces are flipped, you can always solve in &lt;10 moves.  Usually,
it&#x27;s 8.  The trick is to use commutators.  As an example: M&#x27;UM D2
M&#x27;U&#x27;M D2.  Does anyone else actively use algs like this?

Anywho, that&#x27;s about all the spiel I&#x27;ve got for now.  Happy cubing.

I&#x27;ll do an average later. I do know that F2B + CMLL for me is around
19 seconds.

The second one. But sometimes I do it with standing slices if I&#x27;m in
an awkward position. and if the LD slice is at UR, I just use the
standard 3-cycle from the LSE, part 3.

I&#x27;ve got a good one for you, F (r U r&#x27; U&#x27;)*3 F&#x27;. Try it :)

The problem with this is, You are constrainging yourself to the
standard 1x2x2 + corner edge (or any other formula). I do this most
often, but not all the time, so It may do more harm than good. Unsure
though :)

Yeah, I&#x27;ve used all sorts of different stratergies. Placing DB and DB,
UF and UB, leaving out the final U2 from the placing the UR and UL
pieces and doing the last bit a usually a shorter number of moves.

A thing I still use is if the ULB and ULF corners are solved after the
first block, doing a z&#x27; and executing COLL (Not CMLL) on the corners
and then shifting into the classic corners first senario. It&#x27;s good to
have little tricks like that under your sleeve for lucky cases.

On last thing I still can&#x27;t get right is the E2 M E2 alg. I can never
get it under a second. What do you guys do and how do you perform it?

I&#x27;ll do an average for my F2B+C(O)LL later.  My brain is thoroughly
fried after being up all night FMCing.

Simple algs like that make me smile.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t see that
one coming up in a solve very often. Do you use that one much?

You can use similar trick for placing edges last.  And you don&#x27;t
necessarily need to change the orientation.  Often it&#x27;s helpful to
influence the corners.  Think of the difference between U&#x27;RUR&#x27; and R&#x27;FRF&#x27;.

I&#x27;m pretty much placing DB while orienting edges almost all of the
time now.  It seems like a lot of algs to start with, but they&#x27;re not
so bad because they&#x27;re short and mostly common sense.  It feels great
to get DB or DF placed after step 3, and see an easy 3 edges on top
orientation.  You can usually even work out the L5E step afterward to
be a nice case based on which direction you orient that one from.

I would try that, but my corners first times are all >30 on average. :(

I avoid that one like the plague.  It doesn&#x27;t really come up very
often the way I solve the L6E.  Only about 1/30 of the times I get an
O6E skip, which is about 1/32.  1 out of a little under 1,000 solves.
 If I solve the normal Roux way, though, I hate getting that one.  It
probably takes me >2 seconds on average.  I used to do it as M&#x27;E2(push
with right thumb twice)M/M&#x27;E2(push twice again).  Now I&#x27;ve switched to
doing it as M&#x27; and then double click the E&#x27; with my right index
finger.  The trick is to adjust your right middle finger during the M&#x27;
turn, so that it&#x27;s positioned on the B sticker of DBR (and right thumb
on the F sticker of DFR). I&#x27;ve also tried doing the E2 as a wrist
turn, but it&#x27;s not as fast as the clicking once you get it down.

          <div class="email-content">David, I was about right where you are a month ago :). Get ready for
some major improvements in speed when you take this next step.
Basically you want the F2L right? What it does is it lets you insert a
corner and its corresponding edge piece at the same time, allowing you
to essentially do 2 layers at once. 

It depends on where you want the cross. Like the 1st step is always
just to solve the cross. I choose to solve the cross on the bottom
because then I&#x27;m looking for the F2L pairs on the top which is easier
to see. Some people choose to hold the cross in the left hand but I
don&#x27;t really like that. I&#x27;m not saying you have to solve it on the
bottom but whatever you prefer, the F2L methods vary depending on that.

Anyways, F2L for beginners, I started with the algorithms on
Speedcubing.com: http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that page allows
you to choose the method for whatever side you prefer to solve the
cross. The site&#x27;s nice because it gives you a printable page of the
algorithms with all of them on 1 single page so you can put it in your
pocket and what not.

Don&#x27;t worry about the 3 look and 4 look yet until you&#x27;ve somewhat
mastered the F2L. Those are methods to solving the last layer. I&#x27;m
assuming that you learned how to do the last layer by first flipping
the edges of the last layer up, moving them to their right places,
then moving the corners to their right places and then individually
flipping those up. Basically what these methods do is save you a lot
of time and a lot of moves. Basically you can just flip all the pieces
face up with 1 or 2 steps, and then move all the pieces to their right
places with the last step. Learning this is essential if you want to
cube in under 60 seconds although since there is much to memorize, I
would first learn the F2L. 




The next step after you learn the F2L, is learning how to look ahead.
Basically to become efficient at the F2L you must be able to find the
next corner/edge pair while you&#x27;re solving the 1st one. Like while
you&#x27;re doing the cross you find the 1st corner/edge pair and the
moment you finish the cross you can go right into the F2L without
delay. While you&#x27;re putting that pair in place, look for the next
pair, and the moment you&#x27;re done with the 1st pair you can go right
into the 2nd pair without delay. To do this you must slow down your
F2L to give yourself time. Once you are able to look ahead, you can
start to speed up.

I don&#x27;t know how to do it myself and I&#x27;m starting to try it just a few
 days ago but it&#x27;s really hard. Does anyone have any tips for Matt and
I? I just can&#x27;t seem to do it. I&#x27;m slowing down but I&#x27;m still
struggling to keep track of the pieces. Usually I&#x27;ve found either an
edge or a corner, but I don&#x27;t see the 2nd piece until after I finish
inserting the current pair, which ruins the entire point really.
Usually I see the pair but because of the nature of the F2L method I
use, I think I know where it is but after I finish inserting the
current pair, I find that the piece is actually somewhere on the
bottom layer somewhere else.

Phew that was long. Hope this helps you Matt and hope someone can help me!

Hehe, time for me to mention there are methods for which the only 
badly oriented edges are in the correct place, i.e. easy to detect...

Why not? (True, it isn&#x27;t, but why do *you* say so?)

It looks a bit like you&#x27;re guessing without understanding :-). Perhaps 
instead try extending the textual two-variable version (which was 
good) to a textual three-variable version.

          <div class="email-content">Mellowfreezer: Thanks! I currently solve the cross on the top of the cube, but I think I know what you mean how it would be easier to solve the first two layers simultaneously if all of the work you were doing was not at the bottom of the cube. Do you think that most people do it the bottom way? If so, i would trust their judgement and learn to do it that way. For the time being, I guess i&#x27;ll just start doing it your way.
   
  Those algorithms look really intimidating; right now i&#x27;m able to solve the cube using a total of i think 9 algorithms... but I guess i should just start memorizing them? How long is this supposed to take me? :-)
   
  Thanks

  David, I was about right where you are a month ago :). Get ready for
some major improvements in speed when you take this next step.
Basically you want the F2L right? What it does is it lets you insert a
corner and its corresponding edge piece at the same time, allowing you
to essentially do 2 layers at once. 

It depends on where you want the cross. Like the 1st step is always
just to solve the cross. I choose to solve the cross on the bottom
because then I&#x27;m looking for the F2L pairs on the top which is easier
to see. Some people choose to hold the cross in the left hand but I
don&#x27;t really like that. I&#x27;m not saying you have to solve it on the
bottom but whatever you prefer, the F2L methods vary depending on that.

Anyways, F2L for beginners, I started with the algorithms on
Speedcubing.com: http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l.html that page allows
you to choose the method for whatever side you prefer to solve the
cross. The site&#x27;s nice because it gives you a printable page of the
algorithms with all of them on 1 single page so you can put it in your
pocket and what not.

Don&#x27;t worry about the 3 look and 4 look yet until you&#x27;ve somewhat
mastered the F2L. Those are methods to solving the last layer. I&#x27;m
assuming that you learned how to do the last layer by first flipping
the edges of the last layer up, moving them to their right places,
then moving the corners to their right places and then individually
flipping those up. Basically what these methods do is save you a lot
of time and a lot of moves. Basically you can just flip all the pieces
face up with 1 or 2 steps, and then move all the pieces to their right
places with the last step. Learning this is essential if you want to
cube in under 60 seconds although since there is much to memorize, I
would first learn the F2L. 




The next step after you learn the F2L, is learning how to look ahead.
Basically to become efficient at the F2L you must be able to find the
next corner/edge pair while you&#x27;re solving the 1st one. Like while
you&#x27;re doing the cross you find the 1st corner/edge pair and the
moment you finish the cross you can go right into the F2L without
delay. While you&#x27;re putting that pair in place, look for the next
pair, and the moment you&#x27;re done with the 1st pair you can go right
into the 2nd pair without delay. To do this you must slow down your
F2L to give yourself time. Once you are able to look ahead, you can
start to speed up.

I don&#x27;t know how to do it myself and I&#x27;m starting to try it just a few
days ago but it&#x27;s really hard. Does anyone have any tips for Matt and
I? I just can&#x27;t seem to do it. I&#x27;m slowing down but I&#x27;m still
struggling to keep track of the pieces. Usually I&#x27;ve found either an
edge or a corner, but I don&#x27;t see the 2nd piece until after I finish
inserting the current pair, which ruins the entire point really.
Usually I see the pair but because of the nature of the F2L method I
use, I think I know where it is but after I finish inserting the
current pair, I find that the piece is actually somewhere on the
bottom layer somewhere else.

Phew that was long. Hope this helps you Matt and hope someone can help me!

          <div class="email-content">Like I said, it&#x27;s all personal preference. The way I see it, you have
to do the Last Layer face up anyways so if you do the cross on the top
you still have to flip everything over sooner or later, why not just
start with the cross on the bottom and save yourself a step.

Yes 42 algorithms is a lot but take your time learning them
thoroughly. Actually, just today someone showed me another F2L method
which is a bit more efficient. =D http://cubewhiz.com/f2l.html 
I made it into a printable page using the graphics from the
speedcubing.com site: http://home.comcast.net/~djspazy/rubiks/f2l.html
For people like you and I, we just want to focus on the FR: of each
case. That is solving for the pair in the Front Right corner of the cube. 

Basically you see those moves inside the ( ), those are triggers. You
can do those moves really really quickly with just a flick of your
wrist. I personally think this method is far more efficient and quick
and actually, if you slow down to observe what&#x27;s happening, the
algorithm is actually pretty much intuitive. 

If you notice, most of the cases have a mirror case. Like you look
case #25 on cubewhiz site, it&#x27;s mirror is case number 38. So 25 the
pieces were on the right, now 38 theyre on the left flipped over the
diagonal of the cube. So in most cases, by learning one of the
algorithms, chances are you will know its mirror and so you actually
learn 2.  But do not attempt to memorize them all in a week. Do
perhaps 4 a day on the weekdays, that&#x27;s 20 which is a lot. Spend the
week end reviewing all that you have learned. You don&#x27;t want to learn
them so fast that you end up forgetting them at the end. The point is
to thoroughly learn them.

The site also gives you algorithms for when the pair is in the FR:
front left, BR: back right, BL: back left corner, but that is way too
much memorization for now. In the future once you have mastered the
FR, you might consider coming back to these because those are helpful
in that you don&#x27;t have to always rotate the cube so much to solve the
FR corner. Once you identify a pair that goes in the BR corner, you
don&#x27;t have to rotate your cube so that the BR corner is in the FR
position to solve it. 

Good luck.

the bottom way? If so, i would trust their judgement and learn to do
it that way. For the time being, I guess i&#x27;ll just start doing it your

Actually I shouldn&#x27;t have told you. I should let you do some 
verification yourself first. For example some general obvious tests. 
It&#x27;s a probability, so it should be between 0 and 1. Obviously it&#x27;s 
never less than 0, but it&#x27;s easy to get it above 1. Also, symmetry. 
Choose three different values for x, y and z. Then change their order, 
e.g. swapping the values of x and y. The value should stay the same, 
but does it?

Cheers!

  Believe me, with practice it gets easy. 
   
  Oh, and how do you solve the cube normally? Starting with which color? Depending on this, you should change your way to do BLD...I start with white cross, and yellow is my LL color, so I use yellow on top and blue on front. But it&#x27;s all personal preference.

now doesnt that mean that if U/D colors are on L or R, they are

How about ignoring those complicated rules? Replace it by a single 
simple one: An edge is correctly oriented if and only if its 
brightness direction is correct, i.e. its brighter sticker is adjacent 
to the brighter center.

You can look at the algs to help you figure out the pairing process
but the F2L should be intuitive.

My 2 cents,

for 2 I&#x27;ll give you 25...so anyways...

I just learn F2L not long ago...and am starting to get fairly decent
with it...need to learn to lookahead better and stuff...but that
obviously comes with time...I was planning on locking myself in my
room one day and learning them...but then I was told otherwise...and
now I know intuitive...its much better...you get used to the cases too
so you are pretty much executing algorithms...and if you just blindly
memorise the algorithms then you won&#x27;t use Empty Slots and other fun
stuff...but you know...go ahead...learn algs and take >40 moves for
F2L every solve...have fun :) If anyone wants to hear my other few
cents...you know where to find me, e-mail, Yahoo, MSN...

          <div class="email-content">Oh its you, hahahaha I did what you told me not to do. But the thing
is, for beginners, the F2L isn&#x27;t exactly intuitive if you&#x27;ve never
done it before. At least get some experience, some sense of the F2L
before you go and experiment on your own. True, I don&#x27;t know how use
empty slots, as a matter of fact I don&#x27;t even know what it is, but I
still wouldn&#x27;t be able to even if I hadn&#x27;t looked at the site. Haha if
the F2L was intuitive without looking at algorithms, then solving the
rubik&#x27;s cube wouldn&#x27;t be very special because everyone would be able
to do it.

Btw, I am very interested to hear about how to do the F2L in under 40
moves o.O

          <div class="email-content">No, doesn&#x27;t work...try it on any cube...it works that if you turn a
face it is solved, but you aren&#x27;t just turning a face cuz you have to
do everything in a different manner...you orient everything
first...then permute them...so everything must be oriented before
permuted, therefore you need to know which ones need to be oriented
and orient them...and you have to do that in their respective
positions...unless of course your name is Stefan Pochmann and none of
these rules apply to you :p

What you said is correct just as long as you restrict L, L&#x27;, R, and R&#x27;.<br>

          <div class="email-content">First of all, I never really introduced myself, but I&#x27;m a new cuber who joined this group about a week ago... my name is David, i&#x27;m 17 from Ohio/USA, and learned how to solve a rubik&#x27;s cube (using a cheat-sheet for algs) on Christmas (although I had my cube before then). I did 12 in a row today to find my average time,  which is 2:41 at the moment.<br>
   <br>
  Anyways, I want to get faster.. at least to be able to solve the cube in a minute.<br>
   <br>
  A few questions.<br>
   <br>
  First of all, from what people here have told me, I need to learn how to solve F2L in one step. Currently I do all 3 layers seperately. I printed of all 41 algs from speedcubing.com, but I have been told that I should know how to do it intuitively. With that in mind, what is the best way of learning how to do the F2L simultaneously? The way I see it, there should be a way to learn a smaller number of algs and then learn how to position the cubes so that those algs can be used.. maybe that woudlnt&#x27; work though. Anyways, let me know what methods you guys used for mastering F2L.<br>
   <br>
  Second question: is this a good method for last layer?<br>
  -Cross<br>
  -Permute corners<br>
  -Orient corners<br>
  -Permute edges<br>
  -(Orient edges; i almost never have situations where the edges are in the right place but oriented wrong)<br>
   <br>
  Third question: are there any algs to rotate 1 corner (i know that it would also have to move edges, b/c it&#x27;s not possible to rotate just one piece) What about rotate 2 adjacent corners, or 2 opposite corners? I currently have one alg, which rotates all of the corners except front left; it is inefficient and I sometimes have to execute it as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners.<br>
   <br>
  Fourth question -- any other general tips on getting faster?<br>
   <br>
  Thanks a lot, and thanks to all the people who&#x27;ve helped me so far!<br>

RUR&#x27; and RU&#x27;R&#x27;.  Do those to your cube and learn how an why they work.
 That is the goal state for each corner/edge pair.  Play around with
the cube trying to transform each case that comes up into one of
those, ready for insertion.

The last step (orienting edges again) is completely unnecessary.  But
other than that, yes, it&#x27;s a good method.  Using this, you can achieve
times in the 16&#x27;s.  Many people will tell you that orienting corners
before permuting them is better because it leads into learning PLL. 
Keeping the order this way leads better into COLL.  It&#x27;s all a matter
of preference.
    
>   Third question: are there any algs to rotate 1 corner (i know that
it would also have to move edges, b/c it&#x27;s not possible to rotate just
one piece) What about rotate 2 adjacent corners, or 2 opposite
corners? I currently have one alg, which rotates all of the corners
except front left; it is inefficient and I sometimes have to execute
it as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners.

You cannot rotate a single corner.  You also cannot flip a lone edge.
 Twisting them and shuffling them around are completely separate.  You
can have one without the other quite easily.  Also, if you learn how
to perform the mirror of the alg you know (L&#x27;U&#x27;LU&#x27;L&#x27;U2L compared to
RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;) you can complete any possible orientation in two algs. 
Learning shorter algs for a couple of cases is helpful and simple. 
They&#x27;re really just extensions of the basic alg you already know.
    
>   Fourth question -- any other general tips on getting faster?

Learn why the things you do to the cube work the way they do.  It
makes recalling things so much easier during solves.  Stay calm, and
go slowly.  But most importantly, have fun.

The last step (orienting edges again) is completely unnecessary.  But
other than that, yes, it&#x27;s a good method.  Using this, you can achieve
times in the 16&#x27;s.  Many people will tell you that orienting corners
before permuting them is better because it leads into learning PLL. 
Keeping the order this way leads better into COLL.  It&#x27;s all a matter
of preference.
   
  It&#x27;s possible to get under 20 seconds with this method? That seems ridiculous! I know my algs (i only have about 10 of them) pretty well, and I don&#x27;t do too much thinking, and as I said, the average I took today was 2:41. I suppose after learning how to do F2L, and learning some more algs for LL, I could cut down to times like that.... I was always under the impression that the people who solved it in sub-20 used some sort of strange technique which involved lots of both genius and memorization -_-
    
>   Third question: are there any algs to rotate 1 corner (i know that
it would also have to move edges, b/c it&#x27;s not possible to rotate just
one piece) What about rotate 2 adjacent corners, or 2 opposite
corners? I currently have one alg, which rotates all of the corners
except front left; it is inefficient and I sometimes have to execute
it as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners.

You cannot rotate a single corner.  You also cannot flip a lone edge.
Twisting them and shuffling them around are completely separate.  You
can have one without the other quite easily.  Also, if you learn how
to perform the mirror of the alg you know (L&#x27;U&#x27;LU&#x27;L&#x27;U2L compared to
RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;) you can complete any possible orientation in two algs. 
Learning shorter algs for a couple of cases is helpful and simple. 
They&#x27;re really just extensions of the basic alg you already know.
   
  The one I currently use is the first one you listed -- The (L&#x27;U&#x27;LU&#x27;L&#x27;U2L) one. What is the difference between these two moves? I would try it right now and try to figure it out, but I don&#x27;t have a good situation to test it on... 
    
>   Fourth question -- any other general tips on getting faster?

Learn why the things you do to the cube work the way they do.  It
makes recalling things so much easier during solves.  Stay calm, and
go slowly.  But most importantly, have fun.
    
  Hmm, not sure what you mean by &quot;learn why the things you do to the cube work the way they do&quot;, but I will try to be aware of what&#x27;s going on while i&#x27;m moving it, rather than just repeating algorithms from the internet.
   
  Thanks.

<br>
First a short post for Mike Bennett<br>
<br>
[[[ Mike- you should defenitely try to make B1 on the left side.<br>
You&#x27;re already a full second faster than me at F2B, so maybe you<br>
shouldn&#x27;t listen to me, but doing B1 on the Left has really improved<br>
my F2B<br>
<br>
As it says on Gilles site, with B1 on the left side, you can see<br>
almost** every piece from one point of view. With the B1 on the F<br>
slice, you can only see a few pieces. <br>
**except the DB edge<br>
<br>
 Once the moves for B1 become more automatic, you can find 1 of the<br>
two corners you need for B2 quickly, b/c you will be able to see all<br>
of the pieces.<br>
<br>
Also, the cube is ready for R U r M moves with B1 on the left.]]]<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I like the idea of never having to do cube rotations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Waterman  <br>
Once you have the white layer done(on the L), its all R U r M moves to<br>
finish. <br>
<br>
Petrus<br>
With a 3x2x2 block (on the L), and oriented Edges, you finish the F2L<br>

With B1 on the L, I only use R U r M moves for B2, and then never have<br>
to rotate for CLL or Step 4.  <br>

There are some x rotations, done as r R l&#x27; etc..<br>
but once B1 is formed, it pretty much stays in my left hand, unbroken<br>
for the whole solve.  (Some CLL algs break it up real quick.)<br>

Im interested in How many of you solve the Cross, 2x2 or X  on the<br>

David, for F2L, I would advise not memorizing algorithms, but figuring
out a way to do everything intuitively.  

Try this. 
If you have a corner pointed up, and its edge is in the U layer, line
up the edge with its center.  This will put the corner somewhere else
on the top layer.  Now move the slice with the edge on it away from
the slot your working with.  Now move the U slice until the corner
pairs up with the edge.

FOR LL

(RUR&#x27;)U(RU2R&#x27;)  sune 
(RU2R&#x27;)U&#x27;(RU&#x27;R&#x27;)  antisune
(RUR&#x27;)U(RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)(RU2R&#x27;) double sune
(R&#x27;U2)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U) R  the one you asked about
R U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R  Bruno

Hope that helps.
 
And yes that is a good method.  I would eventually incorporate COLL
into your method.

I see it, there should be a way to learn a smaller number of algs and

maybe that woudlnt&#x27; work though. Anyways, let me know what methods you

I will work on it all day tomorrow.  I&#x27;ve been meaning to for a while
now, just putting it off.  Now I suppose I have no excuse.

I think I would probably prefer to work B1 on the R side, but that
doesn&#x27;t matter.  In the end, I would like to be flexible about which
side I build on, as long as I keep them on L and R.  Building both
blocks simultaneously will be easier this way.

While I&#x27;m terrible at normal Petrus solving, I&#x27;ve noticed that when I
can orient all of my edges for ZBF2L solving early either using an
edge or a ZB trick on the 3rd pair, finishing the F2L using only RU
moves flies.  All of my sub 14.5 solves have been done this way.

Being able to see all the pieces you need to finish the cube is part
of what prompted me to start looking into placing DB while orienting.
 Most of the time, I can see which L5E alg I need by looking at 2 or 3
edges on U.  That&#x27;s handy.

who joined this group about a week ago... my name is David, i&#x27;m 17
from Ohio/USA, and learned how to solve a rubik&#x27;s cube (using a
cheat-sheet for algs) on Christmas (although I had my cube before
then). I did 12 in a row today to find my average time,  which is 2:41
at the moment.

how to solve F2L in one step. Currently I do all 3 layers seperately.
I printed of all 41 algs from speedcubing.com, but I have been told
that I should know how to do it intuitively. With that in mind, what
is the best way of learning how to do the F2L simultaneously? The way
I see it, there should be a way to learn a smaller number of algs and
then learn how to position the cubes so that those algs can be used..
maybe that woudlnt&#x27; work though. Anyways, let me know what methods you
guys used for mastering F2L.

>>>>>>>>I saw a guide on Twistypuzzles for F2L...the link is:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step2.shtml
Starts there...you could learn from someone really good at it...you
can look at the algorithms, not to memorize, but to understand what
they do so you can think about doing it on your own...

>>>>>>>>>>>>Mike is right, that last step is not needed unless you
somehow manage to screw up an algorithm...but for a beginner solution
that is a good order...I still do a 4LLL (4-look last layer) by doing: 
Orient Corners, Orient Edges**, Permute Corners**, Permute Edges...
It will help me lead into PLL...but everyone does it different...
**means that those 2 steps sometimes switch...

it would also have to move edges, b/c it&#x27;s not possible to rotate just
one piece) What about rotate 2 adjacent corners, or 2 opposite
corners? I currently have one alg, which rotates all of the corners
except front left; it is inefficient and I sometimes have to execute
it as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners.

>>>>>>>>Someone tossed out some algorithms...I think if you want a
4LLL(every time) or less with skips...then you need to learn: 3 for
(as you call it) the cross on top, 4 for permuting corners...7 for
Orienting corners and 4 for Permuting Edges...so...3+4+7+4...18
algorithms for a guaranteed 4LLL...(sorry if my counting is off) but
18 isn&#x27;t much, compared to 57 for OLL and 21 for PLL, and those 18
will be one step towards the 78 for OLL and PLL...so you will &quot;only&quot;
have 60 more to go...

on your cube do, he means deconstruct your algorithms...back when I
was a beginner, using my beginner method...I think I was averaging
1:30-2:00 (don&#x27;t remember...) and when I deconstructed my algorithms 
it allowed me to (as I called it) &quot;multitask&quot; to save algs...I only
used 5 or 6 algorithms to solve the cube...and 1 for the
F2L...sometimes I had to execute an algorithm 3 times...then I
deconstructed and the most I had to do was 2 ever...so...yah...Thats
what intuitive F2L is all about, know what the pieces are doing and
being visual, not a robot...

As for tips I myself have for you...practice...i know thats
obvious...but well...its true...look ahead is very important I need to
start doing this now that I know intuitive F2L (thanks Chris) and it
will help me get faster with my F2L, but looking ahead is crucial, it
brings down your times a lot...ummmmm...when learning new algorithms
for the last layer, look around, there are plenty of sites out there
with a ton of algorithms, find the one that is best suited for your
hands...if you are a lefty, do algorithms that use your left
hand...play to your strengths, you can modify any system out there to
be better for you...or something you can use easier...and always have
fun cubing...I get pissed off sometimes...but it&#x27;s always fun...

I guess he is the originator of most of those names anyway, sune, 
niklas and so on ...

Noone can prevent anyone using the same sequences under different

If someone trademarks say a process printing of both sides of a paper, 
and calls it &quot;duoprint&quot;, it&#x27;s only the name &quot;duoprint&quot; which is 
trademarked. Someone else could call the same thing &quot;duplexprint&quot;

          <div class="email-content">A few things:

Jason -- when you said gave me that suggestion for F2L, when you say &quot;iIf you have a corner pointed up, and its edge is in the U layer&quot;, you mean that the silver side where I solved the cross is DOWN, and so &quot;pointed up&quot; would mean that the silver side of the corner is facing up (ie, opposite the silver cross)?
   
  Also; you gave me the sune, antisune, doublesune, and bruno patterns.. i&#x27;m not familiar with what those are. I don&#x27;t suppose it will be difficult to look them up, but these are definetely ones I should memorize?

  I also don&#x27;t know what COLL is.
   
  Craig -- I will definetely check out that link for the method for F2L, b/c I don&#x27;t think it would be enjoyable to memorize 41 algorithms. Also, you said that my last step (orient edges) is redundant. However, I think I should have been more specific. When I said that my method is:

&quot;>   -Cross
>   -Permute corners
>   -Orient corners
>   -Permute edges
>   -(Orient edges; i almost never have situations where the edges are
in the right place but oriented wrong)&quot;
   
  I mean, by cross, that the cross is solved on the yellow side only.. that is, I will have yellow pieces in all 4 spots, but they won&#x27;t necessarily be the correct ones. Don&#x27;t ask why, but I learned this part of my method specifically off of a website somewhere, and it seems to work. I have 2 algs for &quot;solving&quot; the cross -- how many do I actually need, to truly solve the cross? Where can I get them?
   
  Later you said that there are 18 algs I should learn for LL; there are a million sites that offer huge lists of algs, but they offer so many algs on each page that I simply don&#x27;t know which ones to learn. Where can I get these 18 so that I can commit them to memory?
   
  I will try to deconstruct my algs.
   
  Thanks to the many people who have responded! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have many more questions later. -_-

David, for F2L, I would advise not memorizing algorithms, but figuring
out a way to do everything intuitively.  

Try this. 
If you have a corner pointed up, and its edge is in the U layer, line
up the edge with its center.  This will put the corner somewhere else
on the top layer.  Now move the slice with the edge on it away from
the slot your working with.  Now move the U slice until the corner
pairs up with the edge.

FOR LL

(RUR&#x27;)U(RU2R&#x27;)  sune 
(RU2R&#x27;)U&#x27;(RU&#x27;R&#x27;)  antisune
(RUR&#x27;)U(RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)(RU2R&#x27;) double sune
(R&#x27;U2)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U) R  the one you asked about
R U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R  Bruno

Hope that helps.

And yes that is a good method.  I would eventually incorporate COLL
into your method.

how to solve F2L in one step. Currently I do all 3 layers seperately.
I printed of all 41 algs from speedcubing.com, but I have been told
that I should know how to do it intuitively. With that in mind, what
is the best way of learning how to do the F2L simultaneously? The way
I see it, there should be a way to learn a smaller number of algs and
then learn how to position the cubes so that those algs can be used..
maybe that woudlnt&#x27; work though. Anyways, let me know what methods you
guys used for mastering F2L.

it as many as 5 times to orient all of the corners.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; A few things:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Jason -- when you said gave me that suggestion for F2L, when you say<br>
&quot;iIf you have a corner pointed up, and its edge is in the U layer&quot;,<br>
you mean that the silver side where I solved the cross is DOWN, and so<br>
&quot;pointed up&quot; would mean that the silver side of the corner is facing<br>
up (ie, opposite the silver cross)?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes...he was kinda trying to explain some intuitive F2L, add me<br>
to yahoo or MSN chbouchard777 for yahoo and logitewty@... for MSN<br>
<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   Also; you gave me the sune, antisune, doublesune, and bruno<br>
patterns.. i&#x27;m not familiar with what those are. I don&#x27;t suppose it<br>
will be difficult to look them up, but these are definetely ones I<br>
should memorize?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Umm...its a good start to a 4LLL...they would be good...<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;   I also don&#x27;t know what COLL is.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;COLL is a term for a set of algorithms that some people use. A<br>
more advanced method...it orients and permutes the corners in one<br>
algorithm...<br>
<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   Craig -- I will definetely check out that link for the method for<br>
F2L, b/c I don&#x27;t think it would be enjoyable to memorize 41<br>

redundant. However, I think I should have been more specific. When I<br>
said that my method is:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;&gt;   -Cross<br>
&gt; &gt;   -Permute corners<br>
&gt; &gt;   -Orient corners<br>
&gt; &gt;   -Permute edges<br>
&gt; &gt;   -(Orient edges; i almost never have situations where the edges are<br>
&gt; in the right place but oriented wrong)&quot;<br>
&gt;    <br>

this part of my method specifically off of a website somewhere, and it<br>
seems to work. I have 2 algs for &quot;solving&quot; the cross -- how many do I<br>
actually need, to truly solve the cross? Where can I get them?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When you solve the cross on top, that is orienting the<br>
edges...and there are 3 algorithms you need to learn to always do this<br>
in 1 step...most likely you have 2 algorithms, and for the case where<br>
all 4 edges are wrong you execute an algorithm twice...<br>
<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   Later you said that there are 18 algs I should learn for LL; there<br>
are a million sites that offer huge lists of algs, but they offer so<br>
many algs on each page that I simply don&#x27;t know which ones to learn.<br>
Where can I get these 18 so that I can commit them to memory?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, well I was wrong...its only 17...but I understand what you<br>
mean...there are a lot of sites out there...I will compile a list of<br>
the ones you need for the 4LLL...and send them to you...<br>
<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   I will try to deconstruct my algs.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thats good...it helps... <br>

what i mean is that with the cross on the L side, I think that F2L

I would do its mirror with the cross on bottom though
(RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;)

Basically, i do all [L U] algs as z [R U].  Its easier for me to
rotate the cube and do [R U] moves than to change my grip and do [L U]
moves

I just found this message on the group, great to hear of another 
cuber in the UK! I hope that you will be able to meet up with Duncan 
soon, he is a very nice guy and he has a great knowledge of the cube!

Hopefully you will be able to make it to the next meeting of UK 
cubers, which I hope will be sooner as opposed to later! Anyway, if 
you want to get in touch to talk about anything cubing or otherwise 
then please drop me a line.

No, the two 3-cycles are the same, and I don&#x27;t mean by 
inversion/mirroring. Think again :-)

Yeah I know. The prime factorization is 2^3 * 5^5 so if you don&#x27;t hear 
from me again you know the Illuminati got me.

Why not count the &quot;real&quot; number of messages still in the group, ie

Hey all you hardcore magicians out there...How long does it take you
to replace a string from the time you have the replacement string in
your hand??? So how long to remove the old string, and replace it with
the new one...I&#x27;d say for me maybe 1-2 minutes...if I was going top
speed...I&#x27;d be fine...and I usually use the string that broke as the
thing to pull the final loop over the edge...I&#x27;ve heard ppl whine that
its a bad idea...probably is...but meh...

HELLO DAVID

Yes you were right about the silver being up.  Thats what I meant.

Your 4 look:

Orient Edges
F (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;) F&#x27;
F (URU&#x27;R&#x27;) F&#x27;

Permute Corners
RU&#x27; L&#x27;U R&#x27;U&#x27;L  Niklas (switches two on left)


Orient Corners
(RUR&#x27;)U(RU2R&#x27;) sune
(RU2R&#x27;)U&#x27;(RU&#x27;R&#x27;) antisune
(RUR&#x27;)U(RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)(RU2R&#x27;) double sune
(R&#x27;U2)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U) R the one you asked about
R U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R Bruno

Permute Edges

R2U(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)R&#x27;U&#x27;(R&#x27;UR&#x27;)
R2 d (M&#x27;U2M) d L2
M2U M2U2 M2U M2
M2U M2U u2 M&#x27; E2 M&#x27;


COLL is orienting and permuting corners simultaneously.  On Lars
petrus&#x27; site, COLL is called &quot;Step 5+6 Index.&quot;
On Gilles Roux&#x27;s site, CLL is called &quot;step 3&quot;
 Some of these algs do not maintain edge orientation.

Whatever you learn, I would advise using something that takes
advantage of Algs that simultaneously Orient/Permute corners.
Learn CLL COLL 
dont mess with OLL


just my 2 cents

Argh, forgot to suggest directions in the end. I&#x27;d also like to group 
them differently.

x&#x27; (U&#x27; R2&#x27; U&#x27; r2 U&#x27; L2 U) (r2&#x27; U&#x27; r2 U) (L2&#x27; U&#x27; L2 U L2&#x27; U) z

Between the groups the left hand must regrip, but it can be done 
*while* the right hand pulls the U. No other regripping necessary. 
Always hold it so that the thumbs touch either F or B. With practice 
the whole algorithm should be one fluent motion.

Cheers!
Stefan

I learned how to do the cube about 3 weeks ago and got sub-50 non lucky this past week.  It would be nice to talk with some people that really know a lot about the cube and also to enter in some competitions.<br>
   <br>
  Next thing: Some people have been saying that you should not memorize the F2L algs and some people have been saying that that is what they did.  Personally, I memorized the F2L algs in the sense that I got a sheet of paper and practiced the algs.  However, I learn best by doing that and while I am doing that I look at the moves to see what is going on.  I think this combines doing it intuitively and memorizing in a pretty good way, although maybe you don&#x27;t get the satisfaction and good practice of doing it for yourself.  I think it is right that you should not just learn algorithms.  It would be like just memorizing a poem and not even realizing what it is saying.  So am I going to suffer later on from learning F2L the way I did or will I be all right?<br>
   <br>
  Next next thing: I am switching my LL order so that it would be easier to move to OLL/PLL.  Before I did the normal beginner LL: OE, PC, OC, PE.  Now I have been trying to switch to OE, OC, PC, PE but somebody posted a different way to do this (I think it was oc, oe**, pe**, pc where the stars could be switched).  Which would be the better way if I am aiming for OLL/PLL?  I thought the way I was trying would be good because to do PC than PE I had to learn 7 of the PLL algs and then I could gradually incorporate more.<br>
   <br>
  Last thing: What does a good 3x3 usually cost and where can I get one.  Mine is a Rubiks.com one that works reasonably well now that I put some silicon lube on it.<br>
   <br>

Hi there.  I&#x27;m from Iowa currently, but planning to move to Minnesota
relatively soon.  My girlfriend lives in Minneapolis as do many of our
cubing friends.  Where exactly are you from?  As far as competitions
go, the closest one to you to date has been Chicago.  My girlfriend is
working on starting a tournament at the U of M, but they want her to
start a cube club first, so it&#x27;s slow going.  I know Jake Rueth is
possibly planning a Wisconsin tournament for this spring, so keep your
eyes peeled.  At the very least, an informal cuber gathering is
likely, assuming you don&#x27;t live in Duluth or something.

As long as you understand why the algs work the way they do, you&#x27;ll be
fine.  Otherwise, it makes recognition and execution, especially in
competition, worse.  Also, learning them by rote will make it harder
to use more advanced tricks on your own later.

If you want to learn OLL/PLL, that way described will do you no good.
 Just learn OLL/PLL.  If you want to learn the VH method (OE during
final pair/COLL/PELL) keep your current order.  Personally I recommend
the latter, as it is both a great system with fewer and shorter algs,
and doesn&#x27;t create another generic Fridrich clone.

You live in the land of Target.  They go for about $9 there.  Wal-Mart
has them, too.

learn F2L as intuitively as possible and can fairly quickly work out
how to solve a pair when I spot then but the trouble is spotting them
ahead of time. I want to have a smooth solving approach where I move
from one pair to the next without pausing. I guess the looking ahead
bit is just a technique you learn from practicing and staying focussed
while doing the First two layers.. but if there are any pointers to
speed up this process I would be interested in hearing them.

Your website has been a great help for the last layer algorithms so
thanks for maintaining that. While on the topic of websites that
helped me, I forgot to mention in my first post that it was Jasmine&#x27;s
excellently explained beginner method that started me off again after
all these years away from the cube. 

As far as meeting up goes...  time is at a premium at the moment what
with me and my wife expecting our second baby and all that that
entails... but I will make an effort since it would no doubt help my
method loads plus I get to see some really fast cubers up close!

cheers, Matt

Hi there.  I&#x27;m from Iowa currently, but planning to move to Minnesota
relatively soon.  My girlfriend lives in Minneapolis as do many of our
cubing friends.  Where exactly are you from?  As far as competitions
go, the closest one to you to date has been Chicago.  My girlfriend is
working on starting a tournament at the U of M, but they want her to
start a cube club first, so it&#x27;s slow going.  I know Jake Rueth is
possibly planning a Wisconsin tournament for this spring, so keep your
eyes peeled.  At the very least, an informal cuber gathering is
likely, assuming you don&#x27;t live in Duluth or something.

  >>>>Actually I&#x27;m a sophomore at the U of M and I was talking to a friend about maybe starting a cube club.  I think you need three people and a professor to start a club, so you can have your girlfriend count me as one of the three if she wants.
   
  Cheers,
  Robbie

Be careful about the word &quot;need&quot; :-)

Besides dropping the number for PCLL from 4 down to 2, I&#x27;ve taken this 
a bit further now. You can do guaranteed 2-step PLL with a set of only 
5 algs. I&#x27;ll use Jessica&#x27;s names:
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html

(J1) = Jessica&#x27;s J
(J2) = L&lt;->R mirror of (J1)
(R1) = Jessica&#x27;s R
(R2) = L&lt;->R mirror of (R1)

You get all algs except H like this:

U - (J1) y2 (J2)
A - (J1) y (J2)
Z - (J1) y&#x27; (R2)
H - ???
E - (R1) y (J2)
T - (J1) U&#x27; (J2)
V - (J1) y (R1) U&#x27;
F - (J1) y U (R1)
R - (R1)
J - (J1)
Y - (J1) (J2) U
G1- (R1) (J2) U&#x27; d&#x27;
G2- (J1) (R2) U2
G3- (J2) (R1) d2
G4- (R2) (J1) U&#x27; d&#x27;
N - (J1) y2 (J1)

So those four algs plus H guarantees 2-step PLL. Is this optimal? I 
wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it were possible with only 4 algs.

Cheers!
Stefan

Just use FURU&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27; wisely and you will be able to solve it (you might

FURU&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27; to affect only a few pieces.

That&#x27;s not what I meant. I meant applying algs to the LL only. If you 
use that alg you mentioned on LL only, it&#x27;s obvious you cannot solve 
the whole LL no matter how often you apply it. So if it works at all, 
then you have to apply the alg to other layers than the LL.

Also, Craig was talking about a 4-look LL and I&#x27;m after a 2-step 
(better name than 2-look I think, but we mean the same) PLL.

To be precise: find a smallest possible set of algs that change only 
the U layer and which solve every PLL case with at most two alg 
applications (from that set) together with any U-turns before, between 
or after the algs. Currently the best I know is 5.

I like your thinking Stefan, but I was aiming for a 1 algorithm
solution to most cases in a 4LLL...the concept you described is
actually quite wonderful...i would try it...but I&#x27;m lazy :p as you
know...but if you are a beginner who wants something easy, but also
wants to learn a more advanced solution I would suggest trying what I
suggested, as what you suggested would take more moves on average...

For simplicity, let&#x27;s assume all algs are 12 moves.

If you permute corners and edges *separately* you&#x27;ll need (5/6)*12 + 
(11/12)*12 = 21 moves.

If you *combine* permuting corners and edges using 5 algs, then it 
looks like this:

(3*2*1)*(4*3) = 72 cases after solving one corner with a U turn. We 
need:

1 * 0 algs
21 * 1 alg
50 * 2 algs

On average that&#x27;s 20.17 moves, ha! :-)
(I admit being a bit sloppy but I hope the general idea is clear)

Furthermore, you can easily reduce twisting work for free with 
separate permutations.

For permuting corners you have one alg to swap adjacent corners and 
one to swap diagonally opposite corners. Consider the latter case and 
let the algorithm be this one:
http://www.cubewhiz.com/images/pll/pll21.gif

Now:

1) Rotate U so that the FL corner is solved (BR is solved, too,
   and the other two need to be swapped).

2) Look where the edge at F belongs.
   - If it belongs at F, simply apply the alg.
   - If it belongs at R, do y2 and apply the alg.
   - If it belongs at B, do U&#x27;d and apply the alg.
   - If it belongs at L, do y2 and go to step 1) unless you&#x27;ve
     done that before, in which case you just apply the alg.

This is fairly simple and guarantees that at least one edge is solved, 
and then you don&#x27;t need the Z and H perms anymore, you&#x27;re guaranteed a 
3-cycle or even a edge permutation skip with 1/3 chance (hey, you 
don&#x27;t even have to declare it lucky then :-).

If two adjacent corners need to be swapped, it&#x27;s not so easy. For 
swapping two diagonally opposite corners it doesn&#x27;t matter which two 
opposite corners you swap, i.e. you can apply the alg from all four 
angles and the corners will be solved (at least relative to each 
other). But for adjacent corners, you just have one angle. So you 
can&#x27;t influence the edges if you only know one alg, and you can&#x27;t 
prevent getting e.g. Z or H. You need separate algs for that.

But using J and its mirror is enough. And a rule to decide which to 
apply is also very easy.

Summary: Using Y, J, mirror(J), U and mirror(U) is enough for easy 
2-step PLL. No need learning H and Z.

Cheers!
Stefan

This has appeared here before, so if you&#x27;re interested in results, try 
to find the old thread :-)

IIRC I stopped after the first page or so, when I realized how long it 
would take me to finish it...

Assuming you use the 7 move (in stm; 9 in htm) algs to cycle 3 edges,
it gets even better.

(5/6)*12 + (11/12)*7 = 16.46 moves (18.25 htm)

If I&#x27;d have read that last post correctly, I&#x27;d have done this the
right way.  Oops.

(5/6)*12 + (11/12)*7.55 = ~17 moves (19 htm)

Just be &quot;grateful&quot; that you don&#x27;t do fantasy/RPG.  But I think the idea 
of the test is to score high, and be proud of it. ;)

With fairly honest answers (to the extent that I could be bothered to 
think about them) I got 15.77909% (Geek).  By including some past 
interests and with a flexible interpretation of some of the questions I 
raised that to 23.4714% (still only a Geek).

Extending your textual reasoning should look like this:

- If the first step is skipped (probability x) then we&#x27;re done.
- Otherwise (probability (1-x)) if the second step is skipped 
(probability y) then we&#x27;re done.
- Still otherwise (probability (1-x)(1-y)) if the third step is 
skipped (probability z) then we&#x27;re done.

So you&#x27;d get
x + (1-x)*y + (1-x)*(1-y)*z
or
x + (1-x) * (y + (1-y) * z).

This works but is is complicated. You ask for &quot;at least one step 
skipped&quot;. You could try to solve similar but extreme cases cause those 
are generally easier, e.g. &quot;all steps skipped&quot; (probability x*y*z) or 
&quot;no steps skipped&quot; (probability (1-x)(1-y)(1-z)). And if you then 
realized that &quot;at least one&quot; is the opposite of &quot;none&quot; then you could 
answer your question simply by:
1 - (1-x)(1-y)(1-z)

Thank you.  I hadn&#x27;t posted again yet because I was still trying to
figure out the way to do it properly.  It was driving me nuts.  My

Oh, ok, sorry then. It&#x27;s just that most threads that don&#x27;t get new 
posts for a few days are already dead and forgotten :-). Well, at 
least I did make you think about it... Btw, I really do recommend 
Polya&#x27;s book, it&#x27;s not only great but also very cheap.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I just have to share this with you all. Earlier today I solved the <br>
cube one-handed in 25.89. My old record was 28.14 so it was quite a <br>

for OLL and PLL. I also set a new average record of 35.51!!<br>

My long time goal is to win the one-handed event at the european <br>
championships. (There will be a EC this summer, right??) I&#x27;m hoping to <br>
average sub-30 before summer and hopefully faster than Joël, Anssi and <br>
other europeans at the same. I also did a lucky 22.83 a few days ago, <br>
with a PLL-skip. Hopefully more europeans will try to get their times <br>

Very nice algorithm (I&#x27;m happy to have found it and thought to Bob at the WC :D)

I had found nearly the same improvement but using the F face, but B is
usually faster I have to admit.
Well, it&#x27;s good for you that you found it :-)

<br>
Good Morning Peter<br>
 <br>
We have received the above mentioned order including the Money Order<br>
in the mail today, since the placing of this order it was discovered<br>
that the factory made an error in the tooling of the 8 corner pieces<br>
included in the 3x3 Black Assembly kits. Therefore the existing stock<br>
had to be pulled from the site. Replacement product is on its way from<br>
the Factory in China. We will not be able to process this order until<br>
the replacement product arrives (estimated delivery time is Jan 20th.)<br>
I will remove the order from the Money Order Page so you will not sent<br>
order reminder e-mails and it will be left in the orders to process page.<br>

PS

Or you could do 

M&#x27;U
M U2
M&#x27;U M
AND then some cool PELL


That means I&#x27;ve made a cool PELL

(M2U)(M&#x27;U2)(MUM2)


7 MOVES but no changing grip

Before you criticize all of the M U,
Let us not forget that F2 U M&#x27; U2 M U F2
is really just (M&#x27;U2MU2 &lt;-a CF PLL) with a setup move

I really like M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2
and U2(M2 U M2 U)(M2 B2 M2 B2)
for PELLs

I might as well just use all M U for PELLs

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Cool adjacent LL double-flip :-)

The other alg u mention flips 2 opposite edges so it&#x27;s not the same.

However taking (MU)(MU)(MU2)(M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U2) and shifting it 
cyclically to (MU)(MU2)(M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U2)(MU) and conjugating with M2 
we get : (M&#x27;U)(MU2)(M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U2)(MU)M2 .

Indeed the same as what u found, so it&#x27;s not really &quot;new&quot; :D

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ben,

Just some ideas from times I&#x27;ve taken a long break but definitely take
the time to follow your instincts.  When you practice all the time you
get into a sort of routine and do the same things for the same old
situations all the time.  When you take a break you lose these habits
and start thinking intuitively again.  If at some point you think &quot;wow
why do I do this when another strategy is better?&quot; then take the time
now to switch.

I&#x27;ve noticed a number of my bad habits and have been able to correct
them after taking a break.  As far as your times, those really
shouldn&#x27;t take long.  It&#x27;s easier to relearn than to learn for the
first time, so all it takes is a little time to get your hands/mind to
remember.

Seriously though, take the time to let your intuition help you analyze
your strategy and hopefully catch any bad habits.

Not much advice here, but I hope it helps.

Chris

For the original alg you posted to flip edges, that&#x27;s already the alg
I use for that case, but you peform is from a y2 standpoint.  And as
Per mentioned, that alg and the other one do different things.

Actually, now that I think about it, that&#x27;s the same case for this
alg.  I use this and the mirror to cycle 3 edges in about 1.6 seconds
on average, but again, I perform them from the other side.  I got them
from Gilles&#x27; site a long time ago.

But kudos on discovering them for yourself.  Now hurry up and find a
nice way for me to place the edge in UR(with the R color on the side)
to FR, and flip UB, UL, UF, and UR. 9 or 10 moves, if possible. :)

WHen I say discover, I guess I mean that I found it.  Meaning that it
existed prior to me &quot;finding/discovering&quot; it.  I know that I haven&#x27;t
invented or created something, like a system.

If there are short sequences to move certain pieces around, then I&#x27;m
sure that most are already found.  I don&#x27;t use computers in any way
with cubing.  Other than sunday contest of course, and this little forum.

Edge Flipping ALg
M&#x27;U MU2M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2MUM2

PELL
M2U M&#x27;U2 MUM2

I Also &quot;discovered&quot; a Z perm today.
U2 M2U M2U x&#x27; M2U2 M2U2

A T Perm I &quot;discovered&quot; about a year ago.
(R2U&#x27;R2UR2) y R2UR2 x2 d&#x27; R2 U

Another PELL I &quot;discovered&quot; about 2 years ago

z U M U&#x27;RUM&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;M&#x27;U R2U&#x27;MU

totally useless for speedcubing, but it&#x27;s interesting how the middle
layer restores itself... kind of like (RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)2 and (U&#x27;RUR&#x27;)2

Also, I know that the 2 edge flipping algs are for different cases.
I only knew (M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;d2)2 before this morning.  I wanted to find
something faster for 2 adjacent edges(faster than using setup moves
and the edgeflip alg).  I figured that I would find a ROUX solution
with a PLL skip, which is exactly what i did.  13 moves isn&#x27;t bad at all.

MIKE- are you saying that you have been using M2UM&#x27;U2MUM2 to cycle 3
edges for a long time now?
I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone using this alg to Move 3 edges.
I use 2gen for 3 cycles usually.  But with Roux, I rarely get these
cases.  PLLs in Middle layer (PMLs?) are ALL faster that PELLs for Zb

Yep.  I&#x27;ve been using them that way since probably April or May of
last year.  They&#x27;re Gilles&#x27; move for when the UR and UL edges are both
in the U layer after orientation.  Check out his site.  Previously, I
had used L2 U F&#x27; B L2 F B&#x27; U L2 and its inverse, but this was just so
much easier.  Like I said, with practice, it only takes me under 1.6
on average for either direction.  I really, really need to learn to do
it from the opposite side, though...

Really, all this move is is the M2 setup move, followed by a PML alg,
and undoing the setup.  It&#x27;s the same thing as my beginner alg, but
performing with no regrips and only using MU makes it incredibly fast.
 It&#x27;s one of the reasons COLL works for me.

(of course less algorithms will work too, but this is

orient edges (3 algorithms, to make a cross on LL)

  I just got a non lucky 11.38! Man, I can&#x27;t believe I did that! My normal average is around 20 seconds, with a previous PB of 14.05. I just got a very very very fast solve. This was the scramble:<br>
   <br>
  D2 R L2 B2 U2 D B F2 R2 B U&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; D2 F2 L D F2 D&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27;<br>

          <div class="email-content">Which is faster?  I don&#x27;t know the specific answer-- it would depend 
on your technique as much as anything.  However the second strategy 
is closer to a 2-look LL, where you orient in one alg and permute in 
another.  So maybe that&#x27;s a better way to start learning, because 
you could learn the corners-only and edges-only algs for orientation 
and permutation (for a total of four looks).  Then as you learn the 
combined cases, you can sometimes apply one to skip a look.  I think 
many people do this on their way to learning the full OLL set.  For 
PLL there are fewer cases so that strategy will be more short-term.

I usually post on Fewest Moves Challenge Forum, but your question 
sounded interesting ;) If you browse FMC past results, you&#x27;ll find 
that last year we competed for a special F2L FMC:
http://www.cosine-systems.com/cubestation/fmcresults/fmcresults171204-
2layers.php (hopefully Dan is going to post the results for 2005 
Christmas FMC as well very soon)

We had two weeks to solve the F2L, and as you can see the best took 
around 20 moves. This is quite representative of FMC experts approach. 
So in my opinion, your 21 moves F2L while SPEEDCUBING sounds a bit 
lucky, sorry ;) I don&#x27;t remember speedcubing standards for considering 
a slove as lucky, so it is just my opinion of FMC solver ... anyway, 
did you guys ever took an average of moves you take for solving the 
F2L while speedsolving ? I think a moves number limit for F2L could be 
a good benchmark for considering a solve as lucky, instead of 
considering all 5 Fridrich steps (cross + 4 pairs) (?)

Cheers !  (a tribute to Stefan ;) )

2layers.php (hopefully Dan is going to post the results for 2005 
Christmas FMC as well very soon)

We had two weeks to solve the F2L, and as you can see the best took 
around 20 moves. This is quite representative of FMC experts approach. 
So in my opinion, your 21 moves F2L while SPEEDCUBING sounds a bit 
lucky, sorry ;) I don&#x27;t remember speedcubing standards for considering 
a slove as lucky, so it is just my opinion of FMC solver ... anyway, 
did you guys ever took an average of moves you take for solving the 
F2L while speedsolving ? I think a moves number limit for F2L could be 
a good benchmark for considering a solve as lucky, instead of 
considering all 5 Fridrich steps (cross + 4 pairs) (?)

Hey Cyril,<br>
<br>
I think if a speedcuber said that he/she averaged in the very low<br>

However you have to consider that when speedcubing you&#x27;ll see more<br>

do in 21 moves?  I think the number of moves it would take you might<br>
be in the mid to low teens.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think a low 20 move F2L is too lucky personally.  Consider a 7<br>
move Xcross (which is reasonable to notice during inspection, and is<br>
the same as doing the cross and skipping the first pair basically). <br>
After that you can have a 6.25 move average for the other pairs (about<br>
average in general) to get 18.75 turns for the rest of F2L and<br>
together you have 25.75 turns total.  Now just consider a 6 move<br>
Xcross and one less move for each pair (easy cases, but not lucky) and<br>
you&#x27;ve dropped 4 moves down to 21.75 turns.<br>
<br>
In speedcubing you will sometimes get these super easy scrambles.  So<br>
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s lucky, uncommon yes but not by our definition too<br>
lucky to count.  Simply since in speedcubing you go through many, many<br>
more F2L solves than for F2L FMC, you&#x27;ll occasionaly get a solve like<br>
this.  Again, I still believe that if for the FMC you guys looked at a<br>
scramble where most people solve the F2L in the low twenties, it would<br>
be very cool to see what sort of low move count you guys would get.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Just to clarify this! The agreed practice for calling a solve lucky 
is that there is a SKIPPED step. In his solution there is no skipped 
step the way i see it. If someone wants to call X-cross a skipped 
step so be it. But after x-cross he does pair by pair for f2l and 
then both a OLL and a PLL. So it&#x27;s not technically lucky in my 
opinion. Those who call this solve lucky i suppose are jealous ;-) 
It&#x27;s no crime to have many easy steps along a solution. And what 
more. If this time was part of an average it&#x27;s discarded anyway. If 
ppl really wanna be fuzzy about lucky solves the single best time 
category of any puzzle should removed. Because there will always be 
borderline cases and discussions. **Shrugs** ...

Have fun!

-Per

PS! Both speedcubers and FMC&#x27;ers crave for &quot;lucky&quot; solutions. It is 
what is fun to achieve. To have good solves analysed and scrutinised 
is not much fun :-)

Whatever you permute first has 2 cases, then the other follows with 4.

whatever you permute first,
if you want to be able to do every possible case by
executing
just 1 algorithm (once) you need 3 cases.
both the 3-cycles and 1 for swapping across.

Every possible method has its easy cases.  Getting the nicest cases
for each step is not lucky.  Skipping a step is.  In fact, this solve
could have been much better without being lucky.  If all 3 of your
final pairs had been RUR&#x27; type moves, you had FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27; to orient, and
finish with a 3 cycle, that could be as few as 25 moves for a
non-lucky solve.  Of course, the odds for this are incredibly slim,
but it would still not count as lucky.

I tried this and my first try was a 13.36, which is .97 seconds better
than my fastest time.  I don&#x27;t know whether to count it or not,
because I tried the scramble without reading how it went for you.  My
second try, I tried COLL+PLL to finish, but that case isn&#x27;t very good
for me, so it was 17.66.  :(

You only need one (!) 3-cycle.

U2

I.e. do your clockwise cycle and follow it with U2, then you have made 
a counterclockwise cycle.

Maybe 4 days ago. When I mentioned that I think of the two cases as 
swapping two adjacent or opposite pieces.

Is that the station?  If so, I&#x27;ll try to listen in tomorrow while I&#x27;m

          <div class="email-content">interesting ... are we going to discuss the everlasting topic to <br>
decide &quot;what&#x27;s lucky ?&quot; ;)<br>
<br>
My opinion was the opinion of a FMC cuber, so don&#x27;t hesitate to <br>
discard my 2 cents (actually 2 swiss cents = US$ 1.6 cents, so my <br>
opinion should not count as much as the opinion of US or EU cubers ..<br>
.)<br>
<br>
More seriously, what I wanted to point out is the somewhat unclear <br>
definition of a lucky solve. I totally agree with Chris&#x27; (although you <br>
make nicely optimistic assumptions about FMCers ;) ), Per&#x27;s and Mike&#x27;s <br>
posts, but depending on the method you use, the notion of &quot;skipped <br>
step&quot; can hardly be defined, and my (too ?) scientist point of view is <br>
that rules based on other criteria may be more consistent, like the <br>
one proposed by J. R. Taylor (An Introduction to Error Analysis, <br>
University Science Books, Mill Valley, 1982) to define outliers in a <br>
series of data : it is a simple test based on the mean and standard <br>
deviation of the series. You assume your times distribution is <br>
gaussian (mean u, std dev s), and compute the probability of getting a <br>
time t using erf function table. Typically, Taylor defines an outlier <br>
when this probability multiplied by the number of trials N is lower <br>
than 5% (usual threshold). In your cas Pedro, u = 20, t = 11.xx and s <br>
is probably around 2.6 (just an assumption, it computed it for two <br>
guys averaging around 20 on speedcubing.com website)<br>
<br>
Now the fun part: assuming you get a time of u-3s =12.2 sec for <br>
example, som maths (actually I hope I did them correctly) show that <br>
the required number of solved cubes to consider it non-lucky (=non-<br>
outlier) is ... exactly 10 ;) So if you were courageous enough to <br>
follow my thinking I&#x27;ll change my vote: if in your entire cuber life <br>
you have already solved as much as TEN  cubes, I consider your solve <br>
wasn&#x27;t lucky  :) (of course, you should adapt the values for your real <br>
u, s and t, but I don&#x27;t expect the results to change in an <br>
extraordinary way !)<br>
<br>
sorry for the long post, actually I thought my conclusion would be <br>
more spectacular (like you should have solved some billions of cubes), <br>
but actually probability laws are not always intuitive. It makes me <br>
think about a problem with 3 doors I saw on a forum some weeks ago ;)<br>
<br>
Last word for Per: don&#x27;t insinuate I&#x27;m jealous ;) How could I ? I&#x27;m <br>

The key is that for most of them they are their own inverses.  This 
is one key to making quick easy commutators.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

There&#x27;s more to commutators than those easy short 4-move algs. When 
writing like Chris said : X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; or P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; (not to confuse 
with turning the cube physically) each of P or Q can be a sequence 
of several moves. And also conjugates commutators are very useful. A 
conjugate is like this : C P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; C&#x27; so u add C before a 
commutator and inverse C after it. That combined alg gives same net 
effect on the cube but on different cubies. C server to bring other 
cubies into the positions affected by P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; only. 

By making C the inverse of part of P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; we achieve a cyclical 
shift. Ie if we have P = R&#x27; and Q = F then P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; = R&#x27; F R F&#x27;. By 
letting C = R we get C P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; C&#x27; = R R&#x27; F R F&#x27; R&#x27; = F R F&#x27; R&#x27;.

And so on. It&#x27;s very interesting and useful to study commutators 
that make up for instance 3-cycles on corners or edges :-)

Tastes vary indeed... I only have the earliest of those lexan tiles, 
so I can&#x27;t judge the current ones, but those early ones are not good 
for me. On the other hand, the Deluxe Cube tiles are great for me. My 
hands tend to be too dry, not too wet, maybe that&#x27;s the reason... at 
the Spanish championship 2004 people used powder against their wet 
hands and I just couldn&#x27;t understand cause I have the opposite 
problem, I sometimes apply something to my hands to make them more wet 
(KY liquid actually, so I&#x27;m using that against the recommended use 
which was already against the intended use :-).

That does bear mentioning.  Those original ones had square corners, 
which I found hard to use.  The new ones have rounded corners, so they 
don&#x27;t catch on your fingers and they look more like authentic 
stickers.  The colors are also dead-on.  For the price, they&#x27;re 
certainly worth a try.  I wish he offered 5x5 lexan tiles.

I&#x27;ve used Textured Tiles from Cubesmith for a while, but I don&#x27;t use
them anymore because they become slippery as my fingers start to
sweat.
(+ if you live in a humid area,  it&#x27;ll increase the effect I think)
So now I use basic stickers :-)

I am not sure if we have any cubers out there.  I know a kid named 
Matt from out east showed up to the championships a day late (and 
thus, did not compete), but I don&#x27;t know if it was Halifax that he 
came from or not.  

I assumed that was what you were asking, and not &quot;does anyone in 
Halifax listen to that station&quot; as I am sure they do, and you will 
be heard by many.

Hey you gotta work hard on your beauty-and-geek popularity, the first 
page google finds for &quot;tyson mao&quot; that is made from someone out of the 
cubing community, is about a quiz show in which some Daniel beat you 
to the buzzer about Britney Spears :-)

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I got the same problem with the caps too. I thought of not 
putting the caps on, but sometimes the other pieces get caught with 
the corner pieces (because of the hole) resulting in not-so-smooth 
turns. I ended up cutting small gaps in the edges of the caps so that 
they line up nicely with the notches in the corner piece. I then put 
the caps on and sand down the edges so that they are flat. It&#x27;s a lot 
of work but the cube turns very well now with the corner caps on.

Older DIY cubes comes with the corner caps installed, so this is a 
new feature... which brings me a lot of extra work! :( I ordered 4 
cubes so I have 3 more to work on...

but the cover will create a surface for the silicon lubricant instead
of a hole so in the long run it will be for the better.

          <div class="email-content">the magic doesn&#x27;t have more solved states and you
can&#x27;t do any moves that you can&#x27;t do with a magic with
all 16 strings (which are just the 8 twice everywhere

so i guess it must be legal, but i don&#x27;t think it
would be smart. with only 8 strings, you are much more
likely to force the magic into some weird angle and
snap some strings when going ultrafast...

physics homework?  Oh wait... you&#x27;re done.

Yeah, the solve was really nasty.  So I handed the girls the cube, and  
then I was memorize it, and I was answering questions at the same time  
from the girls.  I took my time on the memorization and on the solve,  
because I wanted to be sure to get it right.  The total time was  
probably about 3 and a half minutes.

Ha!  It looked even faster on TV, of course.  They even got your 
mumbling, but I didn&#x27;t catch any llamas.

I like the part where they got sick of your cubes and made you put 
them all back in the bag.  That reminds me of a certain beauty in my 
home :)

          <div class="email-content">I took the advice of a recent post and used a metal file to sand 
mine.  As long as the grain of the file is sufficient to sand the 
plastic, you should be okay.  The file I used was even too large but 
it still did the trick.

I was going to make a post of this, but I just haven&#x27;t got any good 
photos yet to help illustrate.  But this is a great technique, even 
for store bought cubes.  The place where the corner cover is &quot;welded&quot; 
on (or however they do that at the factory) sometimes leaves extra 
plastic attached to the foot of the corner piece.  The result is 
usually not noticable, until you get four &quot;bad&quot; pieces lined up the 
same way on one face, with each corner cover occupying the same 
plane.  This puts so much tension on the circular track of that face, 
that suddenly that face will seem to turn very rough.  If you twist a 
few of the corners, it will turn smooth again.  Sanding that part 
eliminates this effect.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
My ex-girlfriend lent me a book a while back that I&#x27;ve since given <br>
back but have been thinking about all along all the same.  It was a <br>
book introducing how to perform speed mental arithmetic.  One of the <br>
most important things they stressed for speed multiplication, is to <br>
memorize the multiplication tables out to the 25&#x27;s (so 325 unique <br>
entries).<br>
<br>
I am currently working on memorizing these now and was wondering if <br>
anyone else does, or has done this is the past?<br>
<br>
I feel like memorizing an alg is easy since it&#x27;s my comfort zone and <br>
I&#x27;ve had years to practice, but memorizing something like this seems <br>
very new to me and I don&#x27;t know the best way to approach it.<br>
<br>
So far I am working on the perfect sqaures beyond 17 (which is as <br>
high as I knew before, other than easy ones like 20^2), and the 11 <br>
times tables because of the really easy trick to multiply a number <br>
by 11.<br>
<br>
So anyway, I&#x27;m very very interested in learning speed mental <br>
arithmetic and am looking for others who are or have been interested <br>
for a while.  This is all new to me, and it would be awesome to hear <br>
some advice from someone who already does this ;-)<br>
<br>
Also does anyone have any advice for memorizing this larger <br>
multiplication table?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Chris<br>

Yeah, let&#x27;s see... so I did a blindfold solve for my first interview  
(15 people all crammed in the room watching with a black t-shirt tied  
around my head), a blindfold solve for Ashton Kutcher in another  
interview, and then that one was my third &quot;performance&quot; style blindfold  
solve.  By &quot;performance,&quot; I mean that if I screw up and fail, it&#x27;s  
really bad and looks like I just plain suck.

I might have to do one this Monday for a press conference.  Yikes.

How fast can you let&#x27;s say multiply two 3-digit or two 4-digit numbers 
in your head?

- Hardcore version: somebody tells you the two factors, then you 
think, then you say the result *after* your calculation (i.e. you must 
say the result quickly).

- Kindergarten version: You write both factors down, then you think 
and write the result down (can be mixed, i.e. you can write down 
digits of the result *during* your calculation). You can&#x27;t write 
anything down besides the factors and the result.

Cheers!
Stefan

What the girls should&#x27;nt know on BATG for you

-1-That the champion of the world blindfold 2003 was inspired by a 
magician-cuber no delared (1993-2003) .
   
 -2-That it takes much more years to become an excellent chess 
gamer. 

 -3-  To have the chance to have an official blindfold record  
because the cube is not really popular. The opposite could make it 
possible to an exceptionally gifted child to better.

http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=1499

He once saw a man doing the puzzle behind his back and was inspired 
to try it himself. 

&quot;I thought this guy has to have extraordinary vision or something,&quot; 
he said. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d try it.

:=)
Gaétan

PS:Congradulation for Gunnar and Gustav, 2 world record in the same 
championship with my easy method 2x2x2.

          <div class="email-content">It definitely takes many more years to do a lot of other things, such 
as chess, music, athletics, etc.  The list is endless.  Simply said, 
the new generation of cubers have reached their level of expertise in a 
very short period of time—less than 3 years.

Though, I&#x27;m not really sure why the girls would care about number 1.  
There are many more important things that determine how you get on and 
succeed on the show, such as the way you give your interviews, your 
interactions between people in the house.

I must say though, when I went there fore an interview, they were 
strictly looking for sub-2 minute blindfold cubers, and cubers inspired 
by little Japanese boys.

I&#x27;ll take a brief look at that later.

It says 11.66 for OLL and 12.17 for PLL.
But I guess it depends on which algorithm you use, and which metric
system you use.

Thanks again,
You might hear from me if what I find is statistically interesting :p

thing!
just finished watching. i really had a good laugh!! it
kinda
made my day! (i even would have known the gwen
steffani
question ;-)) it would be really nice if someone
posted a
link to download after each episode...
and yeah the short scenes from next show probably show
what
teams are swapped.

keep on cubing!

well never got past that to be honest...
once you know how the method works it&#x27;s really easy to
do it. (takes some time to come up with 24 colorfull
items and a good route though. but that only needs to
be done once.) it&#x27;s not a very fast method (but of
course a lot depends on how fast you can memorize
things and turn the cube) but a very solid one. and no
new algorithms that need to be learned (if you know
PLL)

did you guys notice only 5 teams are sitting at the
poker table? and tyson isn&#x27;t one of them...! what
happened?

and i guess the pochmann-method can be fast then ;-)
i&#x27;m just not very used to blindfold solving

a very rough calculation...

11 edges with T-permutation + setup (and undo) moves
--> 11x (14 + 2to4) moves
T-permutation and another PLL to get corners back in
place
--> 24 moves
7 corners with some algorithm + setup (and undo) moves
--> 7x (15 + 2to4) moves

more or less a total of 337 turns. how many turns do
these others systems more or less need to complete a
cube blindfolded?

noticed it...but I&#x27;ve had some speculation on that, to make u think
that they are wrongfully showing you someone missing...maybe tyson won
some sort of challenge and was off enjoying his rewards???
maybe...hopefully...

Betting it was lucky :p sorry Leyan if it wasn&#x27;t...but...Leyan&#x27;s
previous best was set a few days ago using Tyson&#x27;s cube with a time of
11.97...so he either got a new PB, or it was lucky...now an American
has the North American record...grrrrrrrrrrrrr...

I would most definitely come.  Perhaps my girlfriend, too.  When are 
you thinking about hosting it, and where in Missouri?  I&#x27;m from Iowa, 
so it&#x27;s only a few hours&#x27; drive.  The Midwest group would be another 
good place to poll about this.

By that I meant, this is the first competition, so whoever had the
best times in the events with new rules, are guaranteed new
WRs...thats what i meant...sorry for any confusion...and Richard, I
agree 100%...any chance we can see Leyan&#x27;s Scramble/Solve???(the moves
I mean) and why didn&#x27;t Macky get a crazy time on that solve too :p

Way to go Leyan!  Wish I could&#x27;ve been there.

Two questions:  Did Tyson not compete?  Was Jessica Fridrich there?

          <div class="email-content">Hey,<br>
<br>
I was just curious what the shortest move count for a non-lucky solve<br>
would be...using Fridrich, and no advanced techniques such as Xcross<br>
or w/e...<br>
<br>
Cross: Kinda ambiguous...if it is 1 or 2 moves...some ppl consider it<br>
lucky...but this will only barely affect the final count...I&#x27;ll use 2<br>
in my count...<br>
Pair 1: 3 moves<br>
Pair 2: 3 moves<br>
Pair 3: 3 moves<br>
Pair 4: 3 moves<br>
OLL: 6 moves (i believe this is the shortest one)<br>
PLL: 9 moves (don&#x27;t shoot me if I&#x27;m wrong)<br>
Total: 29 moves<br>
Someone turning at 3 moves/sec would get sub-10...and if you did<br>
Xcross it would be less...you would eliminate one pair...maybe 1<br>
sec...I was just curious...<br>

If you get the H perm or use a 7 move 3 edge cycle, it could be 2
shorter.  27 is better than 29.

If you allow an easy 2 move xcross, that makes for a grand total of 25
for the shortest possible non-lucky case.

But wait.  Better idea:

If you do a Roux solve, the best possible case is 2 moves for a
non-lucky F2B, 6 for the corners, 3 for orienting edges and 3 to finish.

14 beats 25 in my book, especially when it only involves 1 rotation
and no regrips after. :)

Backwards to scramble.  Personally, I hate S moves, so I&#x27;d do a y
adjustment, an M&#x27;, and another y, but that&#x27;s it.  If you can see ahead
of time whhere the DF edge is, you can get a head start on solving it,
changing the two M&#x27; turns into a single M2, shortening to a 13 move solve.

I can&#x27;t wait until that comes up in competition. :)

Leyan, watch out.

I found a really nice alg recently that I can execute faster than

I have a site that&#x27;s going up sometime in the near future.  One of the
first things to be finished will be my variation on Roux step 4, and
my recent idea about using a VHF2L alg to help get solved and 3 edges
orientations 100% of the time.  Richard Patterson and I have been
working on things like that lately a lot, and it looks promising. 
Promising like I was averaging &lt; 45 moves with it, and I know little
over half the algs necessary.  Stay tuned.

Finally! another site for roux solvers!

I&#x27;m about 60% done with CMLL so once that&#x27;s finished I&#x27;ll be after
something else, that&#x27;s probibly it. I may even start it before I
finish CMLL.

It&#x27;d be good to have some system to help speed up the F2B :) but until
then, I&#x27;ll just have to think about it more :P

Due to the contest running long, several &quot;run-time&quot; changes were made 
to the competition:

- 5x was narrowed down to Frank (since he was the only registered 
contestant who could finish 5 solves in a reasonable time).

- 4x4x4 and 3x-onehanded were run with elimination times. If you 
finished a solve in more than 2:30, you didn&#x27;t get any more solves.

[This one killed me when I made a mistake at the end of my fourth one-
handed solve and had to essentially solve twice, ending up at 2:33. 
Ouch! No average for me :(]

- several of the Magic runs were done at a side table. 

[This was fun. Many spectators were crowded around the table asking 
and watching. I actually got applause after my runs, which was 
embarassing given how slow I am.)

Despite my personally disappointing performance, it was a great 
contest. More impressions in another posting.

Tyson, since he puts a tremendous amount of work into organizing, 
publicizing and supervising the contest, tends not to compete 
(except in blindfold). He was regularly talking to press people, 
keeping things going, making run-time decisions on contest timing, 
and all over the place - hopefully he got lunch this time.

Jessica Fridrich did not compete - no idea why. But if all the young 
gals in the audience wanted someone female to look up to, Casey 
Pernsteiner is the new idol. I was impressed by how calm and smooth 
her solves were in the final round.

You should&#x27;ve just stopped the timer before the limit, no matter how 
solved your cube is. That&#x27;s a DNF then, which is much better than 
disqualification.

Was this maybe the reason why Macky DNFed at 4x4?

Btw, why do the results say DNF for your fifth attempt? That means you 
were allowed a fifth solve.

Cheers!
Stefan

<br>
Just wanted to give some impressions of this year&#x27;s contest at the <br>
Exploratorium.<br>
<br>
- The competition was fun, as always. Almost 60 competitors in the <br>
3x, many of them probably in a first competition, along with the new <br>
format (5 solves per competitor) meant the first round ran long. <br>
This required some changes to the rest of the events which meant <br>
contestants didn&#x27;t get to do as much as they wanted.<br>
<br>
- For next year, I&#x27;d suggest having a &quot;side stage&quot; and if people are <br>
beyond a certain cutoff time (3x world record average?) on their <br>
first solve in an event, move them to the side stage for the rest of <br>
their solves. This allows for running things in parallel. The side <br>
stage (which was set up for the Magic) also allows for the audience <br>
to get closer to the action (which I must admit was fun when I did <br>
my Magic runs).<br>
<br>
- The grouping (bring cubers up in groups to do all their runs at <br>
well) works well. Though being in the first group made me very <br>
nervous - I was shaking like a leaf during my solves ...<br>
<br>
- The crowd was fantastic! There were probably close to 200 people <br>
watching, of all ages. I regularly talked to people in the crowd who <br>
were just amazed by the abilities of the cubers (one quote: &quot;We <br>
didn&#x27;t even know this was here and we&#x27;ve been sitting here all day <br>
just transfixed!&quot;). The crowd regularly cheered great times and <br>
successful blindfold solves. They also liked all the fun awards at <br>
the end, like 17th place in 3x first round, farthest traveled, best <br>
camera crew :)<br>
<br>
- It seemed like Blindfold had a lot of DNF? I&#x27;d guess that the <br>
crowd noise and the need to run four blindfold solvers at once made <br>
it tough but I didn&#x27;t compete in blindfold, so I don&#x27;t know.<br>
<br>
- There was a &quot;Meet the Cubers&quot; table where people would sit and the <br>
audience could interact with them. It seemed like not too many <br>
people came by the table? Perhaps if there was a side stage, the <br>
table (and the merchandise table) could be in that area. Things got <br>
a little crowded with the cuber waiting area being right next to <br>
merchandise and to the audience (and to where the press wanted to <br>
talk to people).<br>
<br>
- The press could also probably use a couple &quot;pods&quot; where they could <br>
get close to the action without having to step in front of audience. <br>
Perhaps one on each side?<br>
<br>
But, most importantly, any difficulties and changes that occurred <br>
during the competition were due to success! Many more competitors <br>
and a huge, appreciative crowd made for a great, exciting <br>
competition. While I was personally disappointed in how I did, I <br>
can&#x27;t deny that everyone had a great time.<br>
<br>
Many thanks to all the folks who organized and ran the competition, <br>
and special thanks to Tyson for all his hard work!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve known that this happens to me, but tonight I had a chance to<br>
really test it.<br>
<br>
I feel like I&#x27;m pretty good at blocking out distraction when I&#x27;m<br>
solving, but there is one distraction that I just can&#x27;t handle or<br>
block out.<br>
<br>
If someone counts out the timer during my solve I can&#x27;t block it out,<br>
and I&#x27;ve noticed that I subconsciously count along with the person<br>
instead of devoting all of my attention to solving.<br>
<br>
I was practicing the 4x4x4 when my sister came up and started counting<br>
every second on the timer as they changed.  She seemed to enjoy doing<br>
this, so I encouraged her to keep it up for a few solves since it was<br>
really hard to focus when she did this.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of times that I did with her counting along with the<br>
seconds as they changed:<br>
1:13.40 1:12.38 1:16.91 1:17.07 1:09.42 1:27.55<br>
<br>
I then did a few solves without her counting along:<br>
1:02.12 1:02.16<br>
<br>
Then she counted along again:<br>
1:21.92 1:12.75<br>
<br>
Then no counting again:<br>
58.86 1:09.94 1:04.17<br>
<br>
Then I did two 3x3x3 solves with her counting along:<br>
13.99 17.32<br>
<br>
The counting didn&#x27;t seem to affect my concentration when doing the<br>
3x3x3, but when solving the 4x4x4 (particularly edges) I had a<br>
horrible time trying to concentrate when the time was being called<br>
out.  I tended to rush and solve too quickly, and even with really<br>
deep breathing I still tried to solve too quickly without realizing it.<br>
<br>
Does anyone else have this problem?  Is this something that would<br>
affect all cubers, or am I just the type of person that can&#x27;t handle<br>
this particular type of distraction?  Also, I find it interesting that<br>
hearing the seconds counted out during a 3x3x3 doesn&#x27;t really affect<br>
my concentration, whereas for the 4x4x4 I have a much harder time<br>
doing the solve.<br>
<br>
Does anyone else have a distraction that they just can&#x27;t handle?  Does<br>
hearing the seconds counted out during your solve mess anyone else up?<br>

          <div class="email-content">After watching 24 (my whole family is addicted to it), the news
previews came on and ran down the headlines they would talk about. 
They mentioned the new record (congrats to Leyan by the way), and so I
raced back home to try to watch it.  Turns out I watched for about a
half hour before it came on, and it ended up being only a 10 second
segment!  They showed a few brief clips of cubes spinning and the
newscaster talked over it.  He got confused and basically said the 11
seconds was a new record for one-handed solving.  That was a bummer
that he screwed up the info, but its cool to see cubing in the news,
which will hopefully help it spread even more.

note, I average about 1:20-1:30 one-handed):

I&#x27;m going through the solve and starting my 4-step LL, and after 
orienting edges all the corners are oriented as well. I think &quot;Ooh, 
a PLL, should I? Let&#x27;s go for it!&quot; (I haven&#x27;t practiced PLL one-
handed).

I screw up, and say (to myself, and to proctor): &quot;Dang, I messed up, 
I&#x27;ll just take a DNF&quot;. Here&#x27;s the rest of the conversation (while 
I&#x27;m starting over from the cross).

Proctor: Well, if you DNF, you don&#x27;t get your fifth solve.
Me: What?
Proctor: We&#x27;re running out of time, so DNF means no more solves.
Me: OK, I&#x27;ll finish it.
Proctor: And if you finish after 2:30, you don&#x27;t get your fifth 
solve either.
Me: What?!?!
Proctor: Yeah, sorry, we&#x27;re just running out of time.
Me: Aak! I&#x27;d better hurry.

I probably could have petitioned Tyson for the fifth solve, but I 
was already mad at myself for taking a chance, so I didn&#x27;t even try.

The point that the fifth solve should be a DNS, and that I could 
still have a valid average (tossing the DNS and the fastest time) 
are both reasonable - maybe I can petition for an average to be 
listed. But it would be a 1:45 average, and I was shooting for 1:30, 
so I wouldn&#x27;t be happy anyway :)

  I agree with Mike that the CRC is very good,  but be careful.  The CRC <br>
  seems to break the plastic down rather quickly.  I use it on a new <br>
  cube that I want to smooth out,  then use Prestone after that.  I&#x27;ll <br>
  never put the CRC on a Studio Cube again.  The soft plastic was worn <br>
  out within weeks,  but the 25th anny. cubes don&#x27;t wear so fast.<br>

Im not too sure about the rules, but i think that would count as an 
official world record anyhow, even how lucky the solve is. This is 
because the scramble is same for everyone at that competition. Had u 
achieved that at home it&#x27;s another matter :-)

Thom, Jason, and all of you other Roux solvers:

What are the things you would want to see included most on another
Roux site?

How interested would you be in learning new algorithms to be able to
solve the cube in fewer moves with Roux?

How many new algs would you be willing to learn?
How would you like to see the cases shown (java applets, imagecube, U
face diagrams, etc.)?

Any other suggestions?

Also, Thom, I&#x27;ve completely switched to your 4 centers alg.  I prefer
to do it like (M&#x27;UM&#x27;U&#x27;)*3, though.  12 turns in under 1.7 seconds! 
That&#x27;s over 7 moves per second.  If that&#x27;s not reason enough to
believe in MU algs, I don&#x27;t know what is.

A few weeks ago, I remember a few people bringing up several of their<br>

19 moves, but after only a little bit of practice, I&#x27;m already under<br>

want it in (mostly) RU, so here it is:<br>
<br>
(RU)(R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*2 (R&#x27;URU)(L&#x27;U)(R&#x27;U&#x27;L)<br>

<br>
(LU&#x27;)(R&#x27;U)(LU&#x27;R)U&#x27;(RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;)<br>

For that and the mirror, I average around 2.75, but I&#x27;ve never found a<br>

Interesting.  When doing the 4x4x4 edges, do you find that you almost 
say their names out loud, maybe even holding them temorarily in a kind 
of &quot;speech memory&quot;?  (I do that -- just for the unpaired edges.)  If 
so, that might be the difference...

It&#x27;s not THE world record (best average), but *it is a world record*.

I&#x27;m going to have to practice that one.  Still, it&#x27;s fun to think that
I was performing the other one at >7 moves/second.

And yes, the second one I forgot a prime.  Let&#x27;s try again.

(LU&#x27;)(R&#x27;U)(L&#x27;U&#x27;R)U&#x27;(RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;)

It&#x27;s just a simple two corner swap alg from my 4 look days with a Sune
to finish.  While not my slowest case, whenever this one comes up, I
can&#x27;t help but think &#x27;I hate this one.&#x27;  Hopefully someone has better
ones.

Oh, ok, I guess either the rules were either changed again or I had 
misread them (latter is more likely :-). The particular rule is:

&quot;If during a round a competitor does not solve within the time limit, 
then his solve may (courtesy of main judge) be stopped and 
disqualified by the judge. The main judge decides whether the 
competitor can continue the round, f.i. if the time was exceeded 
because of a puzzle defect.&quot;

I had read it like &quot;If you&#x27;re still solving at the time limit, the 
judge can stop you and eliminate you from the round&quot;. So I thought if 
you stop the timer *yourself* then the rest of the rule including the 
elimination wouldn&#x27;t apply.

So what you should do instead is pop or break the puzzle by dropping 
it on the floor. Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll just try to never get into the 
situation :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Wow... I had found this alg recently as well, I found out for Rubik&#x27;s 
Domino (anyone else speedsolving that one?) I like to do M2 by pulling 
M&#x27;M&#x27; with left and right ring fingers. Then I tried it on the cube as 
well and included some U/U&#x27; pulling and the result was that alg. But 
it&#x27;s terribly slow for me, how can you possible do it that fast???

Cheers!

I perform M&#x27; as rR&#x27; either direction of U turn to follow is very fast.
 Also, performing M&#x27; this way, you can perform M and M2 better. 
Averaging >4 moves/second is not entirely difficult when using only MU
algs.  With any practice, it becomes natural.

Ahh.... hey, how about doing it this (fun!) way:
r (R&#x27; U l&#x27;) (L U&#x27; r&#x27;) (R&#x27; U l&#x27;) (L U&#x27; r&#x27;) (R&#x27; U l&#x27;) (L U&#x27;)

In order to prevent the M-slice from getting misaligned. I &quot;lock&quot; it 
with my left and right ring fingers alternately.

Cheers!

Oh damn, *once* I don&#x27;t check with the applet (http://thearufam.
brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet.asp) and of course I get it wrong. So 
here&#x27;s a bugfix and improvement as well:

((R&#x27; U l&#x27;) (L U&#x27; r))*3

Now that is fun :-)

solve the cube in 50 seconds using a layered method.  I&#x27;ve studied the<br>
Fridrich method but have been bombed with school my senior year, and<br>
just went back my old method.<br>
<br>
I am going to try and learn the Fridrich Method again for the first<br>

(average 9,77 sec)<br>
<br>
I already asked Stefan some time ago what he thinks is<br>
lucky and not lucky when solving the clock. i agreed<br>
with him that skipping 1 or 2 out of 14 steps isn&#x27;t<br>
lucky since it happens a lot. i don&#x27;t know the exact<br>
probability, but i solved plenty to know it happens a<br>
lot :-)<br>
the 7,83 time had 2 steps skipped in the front cross<br>
and all other steps had to be done, but of course the<br>
corners at the back were extremely easy too. (twice 1,<br>
once 10 and once 11 o&#x27; clock or something, which goes<br>
very very fast)<br>
yet i&#x27;m not sure wether i should post it or not... but<br>
then again, if you make sure you solve like a<br>
gazillion, you are sure to get an easy case from time<br>
to time.<br>
so what do you guys think should be considered lucky<br>
for the clock?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Pedro: M&#x27; E2 M E2 is the one I&#x27;m trying to get away from in the first<br>
place. Because multi-slice algs are more prone to lockups plus you<br>
have to regrip a bit, and since my (only) cube isn&#x27;t great, I&#x27;d much<br>
prefer to use a different one. <br>
Gilles says it takes him 1 second (about) to execute M&#x27; E2 M E2. It<br>
takes me about 2.70 seconds to do that one :P. And with the other alg<br>
I discovered, I can execute it in 1.58 (fastest) and 1.60 (average).<br>
It also solves PLSE in a more &#x27;pure&#x27; way (MU!).<br>
Stefan, your alg is fun, but I can&#x27;t seem to get it to flow very well,<br>
it&#x27;s probibly just me though.<br>
Regarding slice moves, I now execute the M&#x27; as a single move, (no r&#x27;R)<br>
usually with the ring finger of my left hand, and I do a ring-middle<br>
for an M2. I solve M differently as I optimised my solving M for each<br>
alg I use (yes, I actually went through every orientation and worked<br>
out different ways of doing finger tricks and algs. I can solve the<br>
two opposite edges flipped on top in 1.05 :) <br>
<br>
Mike, I&#x27;m very excited for the launch of your site :D<br>
<br>
&gt; What are the things you would want to see included most on another<br>
&gt; Roux site?<br>
<br>
Mostly alternative ways of going about something. I especially wanna<br>
see your LSE approach.<br>
Alternative algs! CMLL mostly with COLL recognition helpers :)<br>
Oh, and have the backwards verssions to setup the cases for easyer<br>
practise.<br>
Different stratergies (like turning it into a faux-CF and things)<br>
Mostly help with the F2B :S little tricks like to swap two edges or<br>
flip two - they&#x27;re always fun.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s all for now, if it&#x27;s not asking too much :P<br>
<br>
&gt; How interested would you be in learning new algorithms to be able to<br>
&gt; solve the cube in fewer moves with Roux?<br>
<br>
Not so much fewer moves, but faster sequences than I&#x27;m using now. I<br>
solve in about 57 moves, so I could drop 9 somewhere I&#x27;d like to find<br>
where I could get rid of them aswell as speeding up though.<br>
 <br>
&gt; How many new algs would you be willing to learn?<br>
<br>
As many as it takes to be faster :) The only limit is time really, not<br>
the amount of algs. Although 100 sounds a nice value to be going on<br>
with. (long algs, not things like M&#x27;UM - they don&#x27;t count as hard to<br>
learn :P).<br>
<br>
&gt; How would you like to see the cases shown (java applets, imagecube, U<br>
&gt; face diagrams, etc.)?<br>
<br>
LSE would be hard to do with face diagrams. I think java is your best<br>
bet, but usually it crashes my browser to have more than one running<br>
on a page. I think it&#x27;s best to do it similar to gilles (imagecube?)<br>
and show the alg, I mean you can work out what it does just from the<br>
alg, really.<br>
<br>
&gt; Any other suggestions?<br>
<br>
Not really. It&#x27;d be nice to have a section on helpful tips and tricks.<br>
Such as, inverted and opposite block building. I like how I&#x27;m now able<br>
to start on one of four blocks, and then I&#x27;m even able to build the<br>
second upside-down. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where they just all feel<br>
like the same block. Doing the corners after that is also easy, and I<br>
can always solve it in two or less moves, recognition time is almost<br>
zero, I have a handy little system I use to check.<br>
<br>
Oh! Recently I&#x27;ve been trying to combine OLSE and PLSE into the same<br>
step, I&#x27;ve done it a few times, it&#x27;s like the optimisations gilles<br>
suggests, really.<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, Thom, I&#x27;ve completely switched to your 4 centers alg. I prefer<br>
to do it like (M&#x27;UM&#x27;U&#x27;)*3, though. 12 turns in under 1.7 seconds!<br>
<br>
1.58, sub-1.5 is possible. Race you to it :P<br>

The fastest I can average with M&#x27;E2ME2 from any angle, any way I&#x27;ve
tried it is still slower than I can do the 12 move alg I just tried a
few times last night.

Eventually, I would like to do this for all of my algs, especially for
the L5E.  There are only 16 or so, and nearly half of those are just
mirrors, so it shouldn&#x27;t be difficult.

As for the two opposite edges, eventually, the method I&#x27;m developing
will avoid those cases that aren&#x27;t oriented or the 3 edges on top 100%
of the time.

I will list all of the algs I use, and provide more than one alg for
each case most of the time.  My method involves COLL, so I will
obviously post those algs.  I can list inverses for setup, too.

I got a solve yesterday where the D corners were all finished before
the solve, so I used COLL to fix the others.  I finished with a
generic corners first solution (not very efficient and averages ~65
moves) for a 23.36.  I think I may include a page about tricks like
this when I finish.

We got the (M&#x27;UM&#x27;U&#x27;)*3 alg to over 12 moves/second, and I&#x27;m sure we
can optimize the L5E algs similarly.  These will be lightning fast
once mastered.

The full system would use about 78 distinct cases, and about 60
mirrors.  138 total is not so bad, especially when 40 of those are
COLL.  Almost all of the rest are algs to insert a pair and orient
edges, so they are much shorter than LL algs.

The COLL algs will wind up with a diagram as on Lars Vandenbergh&#x27;s
page.  I think I will use imagecube images for almost every other case.

I would be interested in learning about how you recognize mixed block
corners quickly, as this has been difficult for me.  That is
definitely something I want to go on my site.  Please email me so we
can talk more about this.  [mikebennett_one] AT [hotmail.com].

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, my vote would go to the megaminx. What&#x27;s not fun about a 12
sided Rubik&#x27;s cube? I like it because it solves just like a 3x3 for
the most part, but has its own little challenges. It isn&#x27;t something
you should need to look up a solution for. Plus it looks really cool. 
I like my dogic too, but it&#x27;s not a puzzle I hear talked about very often.

stuff follows....<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
Stay with me on this one, most of it is blaringly obvious<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
I solve with green on top and blue on bottom, yellow/white to the sides.<br>
<br>
This will be a little rushed because I&#x27;m... I have no excuse, this<br>
will be rushed.<br>
<br>
Basically, for CMLL/COLL with roux, you recognise the cases manually<br>
for each mix of normal/inverted corners, there are only six for each<br>
case (are they? I think I&#x27;m confused about the mix of normal/inverted<br>
for each one) and you don&#x27;t need to learn the algs, just where to<br>
apply which ones. This is handy because you learn it subconciously<br>
while you&#x27;re solving, I&#x27;ve learnt a couple of them this way and I<br>
don&#x27;t even know a full CMLL :). A chart would probibly help aswell....<br>
Usually, they&#x27;re the same and most of the time you can guess which alg<br>
the facelets want, I think only a few times I&#x27;ve not been able to work<br>
it out or I&#x27;ve done the wrong alg.<br>
<br>
Then, my two-step. I suggest you use the two-step then progress to the<br>
one step gradually (very...)<br>
Lets see if I can remember....<br>
<br>
|B|| ||B|<br>
| || || |<br>
|G|| ||G|<br>
<br>
if two corners are alright, place them towards you and adjacent swap :)<br>
both alright, continue.<br>
non alright, opposite swap.<br>
<br>
|B|| ||G|<br>
| || || |<br>
|G|| ||B|<br>
<br>
Always a swap to adjacent corners, little harder, still easy.<br>
<br>
What you do is &#x27;search for the bruno&#x27;. Look for where the white and<br>
yellow colours form a bruno shape. This is a little weird. Position it<br>
so it&#x27;s &#x27;sitting&#x27; if you get what I mean. (stickers on UFL, UFR, ULB<br>
and URB). and do roux adjacent swap, (swap ULB and URB). and it&#x27;ll be<br>
done.<br>
<br>
I was about to suggest that because solved produces bruno, we should<br>
look into other configurations to learn, because the white stickers<br>
produce other orientation patterns. probibly too much work. Besides,<br>
gilles has got the general idea under possible improvment on his site.<br>

I think I detect a bit of not-so-subtle USA/Canada rivalry (assuming the original poster 
was Canadian - I guess Central America is also part of North America) in which case it 
could be just like the English and the Scottish (or English and Welsh etc .) rivalries and so 
forth and not too serious. Probably it wasn&#x27;t meant seriously. &quot;grrrrrrrrrrrrr...&quot; is obviously 
overdone.

You&#x27;re right, in my opinion, about patriotism having little (if any) place in the Rubik&#x27;s Cube 
community. In fact, patriotism, by its very nature, excludes more people than it includes 
(no nation having 50%+ of the population).

For the 4 centers swap, 

I found (M&#x27;UM&#x27;U&#x27;)*3 for that case awhile ago, but I didn&#x27;t think that
it had any potential. I defenitely think that its the worst PML.


Try (U2D2)M&#x27; (U2D2)M&#x27;

Why take 12 moves over 6?

Jason Kovacic


PS, I would like to see CLL algs and COLL algs.   I have already
started a table of Both, but don&#x27;t know anything about webpages.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone<br>
<br>
I had a great time at the Competition this saturday.<br>
It was great to see people I have met before, and to meet some new<br>
people.  I was happy to see the large number of competitors, as well<br>
as the large amount of media coverage.  The venue was awsome as well.<br>
 I wish I had had the time to check out all of the Exhibits.<br>
<br>
My best avg with ROUX so far: 24.97.  I am currently a 25 sec cuber.<br>
My avg in 1st Round 24.67: (23.23, 22.92, 34.42, 23.51, 27.14)<br>
<br>
I was very happy with my performance in the 1st round.  Since the 2nd<br>
round had been Axed for time constraints, I considered myself lucky to<br>
make the finals.  I originally thought that I would only get 5 solves,<br>
which would have been fine (Hey I only got 3 in Orlando).<br>
<br>
I got really nervous in the Finals, and messed up my 1st and 2nd cubes<br>
BADLY.  However,I managed a 21.63 for my 3rd solve, so I was happy<br>
with that. <br>
I think that Everyone in the Finals used Fridrich except myself and<br>
LArs Petrus.  I was happy to represent the small ROUX crowd.<br>
Im excited about this Method, as I have just switched 8 weeks ago. <br>
Once I take the time to learn fast CLL Algs, sub 20 should be no problem.<br>

It is Rubik&#x27;s Magic.  You can still buy them at rubiks.com, and they 
turn up regularly on eBay.

You can usually buy strings at http://www.cubesmith.com/Parts.htm but 
he&#x27;s currently out of stock.  Replacing strings is quite a fiddly job, 
but there are helpful instructions at various places, e.g., 
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/magic.htm

Because I can do those 12 moves in under 1.7 on average. (1.52 best.
Take that, Thom :P)

I will have a COLL page for sure, but because I don&#x27;t know more than a
handful of CLL, I don&#x27;t have enough for a page on it.  If you would
like to send me your algs, though, I would definitely post them. 
Preferably ones that flip edges.

Also, do you use non-matching blocks?  I&#x27;m having a load of difficulty
making sense out of Thom&#x27;s post about them.  Am I missing something
really easy?

-Mike

P.S.  I&#x27;ve almost got the L5E/L6E page finished.  Once that&#x27;s done
enough for starters, I&#x27;ll post the link to my site.

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations Sander, it looks like we&#x27;re gonna have a high record
in Belgium :-)

About the Lucky cases, it&#x27;s hard to tell because with Stefan&#x27;s Method
: you have 2 kind of lucky cases :
- the one you like (skipping steps)
- the ones you don&#x27;t like (cases that makes you change the method)

So if the &quot;luck&quot; you have is of the second type, i&#x27;d say &quot;non-lucky&quot;
(because you actually don&#x27;t use them), but of course if you skip 5
steps...that&#x27;s kind of lucky...

With SCC&#x27;s cutoff at 20%, it looks like 2 skips are ok and 3 are not. 
Actually since I know how I scramble and how I solve, I could let me 
scramble generator remove those scrambles that will give me a lucky 
solve.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Interesting, would it be possible to define something like that for
the cube ? in order to avoid scrambles that give you for example more
than 2 pairs of pieces attached together ?
But then we have a problem because there are different methods.
So what&#x27;s lucky for someone might not be the same for another person.
But is a &quot;measure of luck&quot; possible to define for the cube or not ?

&gt; <br>
&gt; Jason Kovacic<br>
<br>
Because you can fingertrick every single one of those 12, and those<br>
six are awful. They&#x27;re basically multislice moves by turning the<br>
actual cube at the same time.<br>
<br>
You can even solve this state in 3 moves, but you wouldn&#x27;t want to, as<br>
I and mike can solve the 12 moves faster than those three in any case.<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;ve said this about three times now. It&#x27;s purer.<br>

          <div class="email-content">If you haven&#x27;t yet tried modifying your cube, a can of silicon spray is
cheap.  Take it apart, lube it up, and see if you like it.  The nice part
about cubing is all the parts are really cheap.

If it turns out your cube sucks as a speedcube, you can just go get another
one and keep this one as a spare.  Then you&#x27;ll have more than one Rubik&#x27;s
cube, which gets you big points on the geek test.

I use it because it&#x27;s faster for me, personally. I&#x27;m not forcing you<br>

<br>
&gt; Also, do you use non-matching blocks?  I&#x27;m having a load of difficulty<br>
&gt; making sense out of Thom&#x27;s post about them.  Am I missing something<br>
&gt; really easy?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I didn&#x27;t really explain it well at all, but I don&#x27;t know how to<br>
explain it better... The main method I use solves them in two steps.<br>
Because I use the block upside down when I create non-mathing blocks,<br>
I see the green and blue as one colour and fix the orientation of<br>
them, that bit is really not that hard. Then the permutation you look<br>
for the arrangement of the green/blue corners pieces, and act<br>
accordingly looking at my post.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll get some U graphs up to explain what I mean, is there an easy way<br>
of generating them or do I have to GIMP it up? Someone should make<br>
U-face pics imagecube-style.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,	<br>
I have just uploaded a cube emulator that I have developed for Java <br>
enabled mobile devices (phones, PDAs etc).<br>
I started off trying to sell it but now I am giving it away free, so <br>
feel free to use it and pass it on to anyone you think might want it.<br>
The program works fine on my Sony Ericsson K750 and I know it also <br>
works on the K700 and T630. It should in theory run on any Java <br>
enabled colour device with at least 128 * 128 pixels, although it <br>
might not be as fast on older devices. I can usually solve this in <br>
about 2 or 3 minutes and on a real cube I take about 30 seconds. I <br>
think it would be possible to get sub-minute with the emulator. <br>
The file I have uploaded is &#x27;Morrix Cube ZIP File&#x27;.<br>
It contains four files:<br>
<br>
MorrixCube.jar		The jar file containing the program.<br>
MorrixCube.jad		A descriptor file (usually not needed).<br>
Morrix Cube Demo.gif	An animated gif showing how the emulator    <br>
looks.<br>
readme.txt		Information about the program.<br>
	<br>
Extract these files to your PC and read the readme.txt file for <br>
instructions on how to install the emulator.<br>
<br>
Good luck with it and let me know how it goes.<br>
Party on,<br>

Leyan&#x27;s new WR also was mentioned in Jay Leno&#x27;s monologue last night 
[late night talk show here in the US].  anyone else catch that?  
Congrats again to Leyan on his awesome time!

the joke is mentioned on Leno&#x27;s website and went something like:

A twenty-year-old student at Caltech set a new world&#x27;s record when 
he solved the Rubik&#x27;s Cube in eleven seconds -- eleven seconds! -- 
which would be pretty impressive if this was 1983. 

(He also made some crack about not being able to get his out of the 
box in 11 seconds; and how he had to take his apart in order to 
solve it again)

I went to the site to see if I could get the clip, but it&#x27;s not up...

Out of curiosity does that mean you&#x27;re saying he&#x27;s lying. That&#x27;s what it sounds like, but I

 as far as getting better cubes everyone i have talked to has recommended the rubik studio but if you dont want to pay about 50 bucks on ebay then i recommend a rubik&#x27;s DIY kit cube
 
 and for stickers or tiles check out www.cubesmith.com

          <div class="email-content">It means it&#x27;s like a setup move, and it&#x27;s not really part of the 
algorithm, so you can avoid the D2 by recognizing the case and 
starting out with the corner in the back.

So, if you realize you have this case, and the corner is on the 
right-down-back, you can do D R&#x27; D B&#x27; D&#x27; B D&#x27; R, instead of D&#x27; D2 R&#x27; 
D B&#x27; D&#x27; B D&#x27; R

I would suggest doing F2L with the cross on the bottom, though, and 
for this case doing (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*3 or something similar

          <div class="email-content">Silicone does work nicely on the larger cubes, but don&#x27;t use a lot.  
Also I think it&#x27;s better to work in the cube for a while without any 
lube to wear it down a little more smoothly first.  Once the larger 
cubes wear down from use they start popping (think explosion) so you 
want to try to delay that process as long as possible.

I use a small amount of lube in the larger cubes, but you have to 
apply it a little more often than for a 3x3x3.  I&#x27;d say I lube the 4x4 
once every two weeks or so, and I tend to lube the 3x3 about once 
every 3-4 weeks.

Hope that helps,
Chris

in a magic competition, please don&#x27;t start your hands like that.

The idea of the regulations is so that there is no ambiguity that there 
is puzzle manipulation before the timer is started.  If your fingers 
are over the Magic like that, there is a slight bit of ambiguity.  Not 
much, not likely, but why take a risk?

Not keen on that, unless you cannot get a cap off to get at the screw.  
With a tight puzzle, popping an edge in that way pushes apart the 2 
halves of the middle slice: the strain can loosen the screw, so you end 
up taking the cap off anyway.  It&#x27;s happened to me twice.

Apart from that, it can be helpful to tweak the spring tension. :)

I did try, but unsuccessfully. Have you found it? Also, please use 
tinyurl.com so we don&#x27;t all have to copy and paste parts of links.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm that&#x27;s an interesting idea, but it would require that generate a
series of random numbers from lets say 1-10. The you would need a for
loop for 10 outputs and so depending on what number it generates, you
need a if-then-else statement telling it to output something for that
number.

Like if it generates 1 you output U, generates 2, output U&#x27;, generates
3, output U2 etc etc etc. Actually you probably need more than 1-10...
but that&#x27;s just how sophisticated you want it to be. Good luck. I
think I&#x27;ll go make one right now ;)

          <div class="email-content">What specifically do you need help with? It doesn&#x27;t sound like it would be very difficult. The way I would do it would be something like:
   
  Make a list of different moves: R, R&#x27;, U, U&#x27;, B, B&#x27;, L, L&#x27;, D, D&#x27; should work
   
  Set a loop to run a few lines of code, say, 30 times.
   
  In that loop, generate a random number from 1 to 10 (assumign you have 10 diff moves from above)
   
  Also in that loop, have a bunch of IF statements to translate the random number into its corresponding move. One way to do it would simply be something like:

IF &lt;variable> = 1 THEN &lt;something> = &quot;R&quot;
  IF &lt;variable> = 2 THEN &lt;something> = &quot;R&#x27;&quot;
  IF &lt;variable> = 3 THEN &lt;something> = &quot;L&quot;  IF &lt;variable> = 4 THEN &lt;something> = &quot;L&#x27;&#x27;&quot;
  IF &lt;variable> = 5 THEN &lt;something> = &quot;B&quot;
  IF &lt;variable> = 6 THEN &lt;something> = &quot;B&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;
   
  etc
   
  The most tricky part (which still isn&#x27;t very tricky at all) is determinien what to with the &lt;something>. What you might be able to do is designate a string variable (text). In some languages, if you use addition on a string variable. Then, just say something like: &lt;something> = &lt;something> + &lt;whichever move was picked>
   
  Once that&#x27;s done, you&#x27;d have a string variable with the random scramble in it, and you&#x27;d just have to display it.
   
  I don&#x27;t know how much you know about TI programming, but this should at least give you a start... lf you decide to do it, and want to try my way, i&#x27;d be glad to help if you had any specific questions... I&#x27;d actually be interested in having such a program if it was completed. (although i have the TI-89, and never use my  83+)
   
  Anyways that&#x27;s just my suggestion, there is prolly a better way to do it, but my way is probably the simplest.

          <div class="email-content">Chris, I guess you&#x27;re saying this because of Andrew&#x27;s post? I looked 
at rubiks.com pretty much right after Andrew had announced it, and 
they were *not* in stock. Notice Andrew got them as &quot;replacements&quot;, so 
I believe we never had the chance to really order these new really 
arched ones yet. Hopefully soon, though.

Cheers!

completely. Also if you do decide to go that route and need help
putting it together there are some very good sites that have the info
you would need

          <div class="email-content">I agree, I&#x27;ve had a DIY for about...3 months and its very good. Also, <br>
about the white DIY&#x27;s with arched centers: BEWARE!! They are not the <br>
same as the black DIYs, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference in how they <br>
are made, but the white DIY&#x27;s still tend to pop more than blacks. So <br>
once Rubik&#x27;s.com restocks their inventory I would reccomend the black <br>
DIY&#x27;s. One question, I think I&#x27;ve put together 6 DIY kits, 2 black, 2 <br>
new white, and 2 old white and for all of the arched centers the <br>
center caps had some protrusion on both sides that did not let it pop <br>
in the centers easily. Although on the 2 older white cubes I put <br>
together the caps fit in perfectly. Anyone else have that problem? <br>

time, scramble, and keep averages of cube solves.  You should be able
to pull up the code (or let me know and I&#x27;ll send it to you).  The
scrambler isn&#x27;t quite the same as a competition scrambler, but it does
an adequate job IMHO.  The 89-basic code should be very similar to the
83 basic code.

too.  I got one of the Restoration Hardware cubes that turned great, 
then an anniversary cube that was just as good.  Both are dated 
10/05 on the manufacturing code.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, those centers must be the same ones they use on factory-
assembled cubes.  Therefore they are made to be easy to glue on.  
Unfortunately that stinks for tuning.  My solution is just to use a 
tiny drop of glue on each tab, so that later removal of the caps is 
not a big deal for retuning.  Like Stefan, I hate using glue, but no 
other solution has worked for me on the DIY kits.

The older white ones used the same (or similar) mold as Rubik&#x27;s 
Studio cubes, and they pop in easily and stay in.  The new design is 
probably cheaper to make since the walls of the center piece are 
thinner.  It also makes the cube lighter.

if you search the internet, you should find plenty

then if you really plan on getting fast, you can go

Ok so in fact what you are telling me is that I do the first two layer
with the method I know right now and I do the 3rd layer using 4-look
Fridrich method?  Also what do you mean by  2) practice a lot so you
can make 4 corner-edge pairs without really using any algorithms.

          <div class="email-content">Why thank you kind sir.  I&#x27;ve been using the program for nearly two
years now, and it has been sitting quietly in the files section of the
group for nearly as long.  I&#x27;m glad it finally found some use.  I&#x27;m
not entirely sure that the version online is the same as the one I am
presently using on my own calculator, but when it isn&#x27;t 1AM I&#x27;ll check.

Congrats on deciding to use this method.  I personally feel like it&#x27;s
given far too little attention. Glad to see someone else trying it out. :)

As far as that step, it&#x27;s trying to accomplish two things:  correct
corner placement (relative to eachother) and correct corner
orientation.  As a beginner, you should probably aim to do it in two
steps.  Pick one sequence that changes two adjacent corners ignoring
whatever it does to the orientation.  Same goes for one sequence to
switch two opposite corners.  That&#x27;s whichever alg you like best from
columns 2-5, and whichever you like best from column 6.  Then, learn
the 7 cases to orient corners when the permutation is correct.  9 algs
to always solve corners in two steps or less.  It can be very, very
fast.  Once you have those mastered, try to learn the rest of the
cases for the fastest possible step.

If recognition is what you&#x27;re having trouble with, try twisting the
top layer (mentally, if you can), to match up two corners with their
correct positions.  If the corners are next to eachother, and the
other two are also correct, the permutation is already done.  If they
are next to eachother and the others are incorrect, then use your
adjacent swap alg.  If they are opposite eachother with the other two
incorrect,  use your other swap alg.  Then, orient according to the
pattern that comes up.  Hope this helps.

I&#x27;ll put a page explaining this in detail up on my site sometime in
the next few days when I have time.  Thanks for the idea.

Keep us updated on your progress.

Hello

It caught my attention when I saw someone new learning the Roux
method.  I have only been using it for 2 months and already had
remarkable progress.  I am finally sub 25 consistently and with no
step 3 algs.

There are 2 things you are trying to do, ORIENT and PERMUTE top
corners.  I still do this in 2 steps, but once you learn all of the
algs, it is only 1 step.  Here are the first 10 you need to learn

A2  (RB&#x27;R) F2 (R&#x27;BR) F2 R2        3 cycle corners
B1  [U] (RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;)(RU&#x27;R&#x27;)          antisune/ inverse of C1
C1  (RUR&#x27;)U(RU2R&#x27;)                sune/ inverse of B1
D4  [U&#x27;] (FR&#x27;F&#x27;R)(URU&#x27;R&#x27;)         inverse of F5  
E6  [U&#x27;]F (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;) F&#x27;             Favorite CLL/OLL
F5  [U&#x27;](RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(R&#x27;FRF&#x27;)          inverse of D4
G1  F (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)*2 F&#x27;               E6 twice
H1  (RUR&#x27;)U(RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)(RU2R&#x27;)        sune twice

I do not recommend learning Step 3 from Gilles Site. 
While I do love the method, I don&#x27;t like CMLL.  And I don&#x27;t like how
not all of the algs are written down.

I am completing tables of CLL algs and COLL algs, but I think that I
am going to abandon the idea of learning both.   For CMLL, you always
have to have the blocks on the L and R.  With CLL or COLL, you have
more flexability, to do the alg from any angle.


I hope this helps
and keep us informed of your progress.

I forgot 2 algs

C5  (RU&#x27;)(L&#x27;U)R&#x27;U&#x27;L       Niklas (switches left 2 corners)
H6  F (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)*3 F&#x27;       E6 three times, an alt to H1

B-H to Orient whichever case you get, and then use A2 to switch
corners afterwards(if necessary).  5-6 sec is a good goal for both steps.

Yep, I use Petrus. I learned it in June 2005. At first my times were
awful (like 5 minutes), but in 1-2 weeks I got my first sub-60. After
1.5 months I was averaging 45 seconds. It took me 3 months to get
sub-30 and 6 for sub-20. Now I&#x27;m aiming for sub-15 :P

          <div class="email-content">Solving the first two layers at the same time is different than your
method.  Concentrate on making a cross on the top face and then getting the
corners and the side edges in place together _at the same time_.  This is
called F2L (First Two Layers).

Even cheap cubes are fine to learn on.  You&#x27;ll probably make a significant
improvement in your time by cleaning and greasing it.  Most people use
silicon spray to lubricate the cube.  You&#x27;d need to do this even with a
better cube.

          <em>From:</em> &quot;thomkirjava&quot; &lt;snkenjoi@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I do not recommend learning Step 3 from Gilles Site. <br>
&gt; While I do love the method, I don&#x27;t like CMLL.  And I don&#x27;t like how<br>
&gt; not all of the algs are written down.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I am completing tables of CLL algs and COLL algs, but I think that I<br>
&gt; am going to abandon the idea of learning both.   For CMLL, you always<br>
&gt; have to have the blocks on the L and R.  With CLL or COLL, you have<br>
&gt; more flexability, to do the alg from any angle.<br>
<br>
w00t another roux solver...<br>
<br>
Considering Gilles executes the algs on that page in 2 seconds or<br>
under, I think it&#x27;s quite worth it.<br>
<br>
I used to think I&#x27;d learn CMLL with COLL style-recognition, but I&#x27;ve<br>
abandoned this since gilles told me to, and I&#x27;ve noticed I have faster<br>
recognition learning this way.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t see the fact that they arn&#x27;t all written down a problem.<br>
Firstly, it&#x27;s not exacly hard to do a written down alg backwards or<br>
mirrored. Secondly, you have a better understanding of the whole step,<br>
you being to notice just how closly most of the algs are related.<br>
<br>
You say you can solve from any angle, so I&#x27;ll assume you mean with the<br>
blocks on U and B (considering you&#x27;ve not learnt COLL, I doubt you&#x27;ve<br>
learnt the 4x48 algs needed to do a &#x27;true&#x27; from every angle solve).<br>
Well, how often do you have blocks on U and B. In every single solve I<br>
have ever done, the block have always been on the left and right.<br>
That&#x27;s the general idea of the system. I don&#x27;t have a clue why you&#x27;d<br>
have otherwise.<br>
<br>
Plus, CMLL is better when you&#x27;re working with inverted blocks. Because<br>
you&#x27;re not relying on the four stickers you look at all the time, you<br>
can get better at recognising cases. I can&#x27;t really talk for this<br>
though, because I use my own freaky recognition tricks here. The<br>
general &#x27;vibe&#x27; from CMLL copulates better with inverted blocks. I<br>
think I use about 15% solves with inverted blocks and another 15% with<br>
upside down blocks.<br>
<br>
The ratio of having white or yellow on the L block isn&#x27;t a factor<br>
anymore, since it&#x27;s about 50/50.<br>

          <div class="email-content">nah, we&#x27;re nice people. we all started out slow (well<br>
i&#x27;m still quite slow now but that&#x27;s another matter<br>
:-p). it&#x27;s cool you are interested in speedcubing.<br>
<br>
anyway, my vey basic page<br>
http://studwww.ugent.be/~snhendri/sander.htm<br>
<br>
you don&#x27;t really solve the first 2 layers seperately.<br>
you make a pair of a corner together with the right<br>
edge in the<br>
top layer (if your cross is at the bottom). then you<br>
insert the pair into the right slot, rather then<br>
solving the corners first then inserting the edge.<br>
<br>
&gt; Oh yeah and by the way, I&#x27;m sure alot of you guys<br>
&gt; told yourself &quot;3:38<br>
&gt; is slow, but the fact is that my rubik cube is realy<br>
&gt; cheap, I bought<br>
&gt; it for 1$ to see if I would like solving it, and I<br>
&gt; do, so I&#x27;m planning<br>
&gt; on getting a good one tomorow or so, I&#x27;ll post my<br>
&gt; time once I get it<br>

first two layers kill me. It typically takes me 25 secs just to do
them. Does anyone have any suggestions. 

In my initial reveiw prior to solve i locate the first four peices and
if i have time i also find the 2 peice to finish the 6x6x4x4. but it
always seems i have to stop and look for the next two steps. I do the
last layer with 3 looks and i don&#x27;t think my issue is with it.

          <div class="email-content">When I first learned F2L, I blindly memorized algorithms. Then over time I
learned how they worked and now I do F2L intuitively.

My LL is still done entirely with muscle memory and I have no idea what the
heck I&#x27;m doing. I see a case and then my hands solve it.

So, whatever works for you. I just memorized algs blindly when I first
started and it worked fine.

Thanks this help quite a bit, but one thing I don&#x27;t understand is
where in the graph it says something like &quot;(D5)&#x27;     Sym(F5)&quot; does
that mean it&#x27;s the same move as F5 and the inverse of D5?

          <div class="email-content">There are many fast cubers out there, but my question to the group<br>
is...Which cuber has been most influential to you overall? Perhaps it<br>
is someone who got you started, or someone who inspired you in crucial<br>
points of your &quot;cubing career&quot;.<br>
<br>
Think it over and send me an email nominating the most influential<br>
cuber to you: richy_jr_2000[at]yahoo[dot]com; please title the<br>
email &quot;nomination&quot; (this is for my own convenience :P )<br>
<br>
To avoid bias please refrain from nominating anyone publicly on the<br>
group for now. I&#x27;ll take the top results and poll the group.<br>
<br>
Additionally (sorry to be late with this),  I encourage everyone to <br>
elaborate on their choice.  How that cuber has influenced you.  I <br>
will organize this bit as well.  Thank you very much :)<br>
<br>
I know picking one cuber out of many who have helped a ton is <br>
difficult.  If it eases your mind, feel free to give honorable mention <br>
to 2 other cubers.  I will also take this into consideration when <br>
tallying finalists for the poll :)  <br>
<br>
I would again appreciate an elaboration on any honorable mentions you <br>
make.  <br>
<br>
I know this is the third post on this idea in a short period, but I am <br>
taking this &#x27;project&#x27; very seriously.  <br>
<br>
I believe this is a great way to recognize the cubers that have helped <br>
the community so much.  :)<br>
<br>
Happy Cubing,<br>

Taking advantage of the similarity between algs, it is possible to 
memorize maybe two or four at a time quite easily.  Hope that helps a 
little.

I got one of those at Rutgers.

You might say that if, to solve it, the puzzle must reach a point two 
tiles above the table, it&#x27;s DNS.

I&#x27;m not a huge fan of that rule, I might argue that it should be a 1-2 
second penalty.  Just like on the cube, there&#x27;s solved, almost solved, 
and not solved.  But I haven&#x27;t solved magic in about a month, so it 
doesn&#x27;t really affect me much any more.

I&#x27;m not sure what that alg is supposed to do... could you explain more?

Nevermind, I must have done the alg wrong. Interesting alg, a bit
weird to do though

Hi John,

I made one in about 5 min, then sized it down. Heres the simple
program. Note, it asks for input at start. This is the number of moves
of the scramble. This program also blocks any cases like F B F or R L
R. Hope you like it. Dont change any of the program, it works
perfectly as is. (yes, that includes the missing parentheses and
quotation marks)

Note: to access the scramble after the program runs: Vars-String-Str1
Here you go:

1->Y
&quot; ->Str1
DelVar ADelVar B
Input Z
Lbl A
randInt(1,6->C
If C=A
Goto A
If C=B
Goto A
A->B
C->A
If C=1
Str1+&quot; F->Str1
If C=2
Str1+&quot; B->Str1
If C=3
Str1+&quot; L->Str1
If C=4
Str1+&quot; R->Str1
If C=5
Str1+&quot; D->Str1
If C=6
Str1+&quot; U->Str1
randInt(1,3->C
If C=2
Str1+&quot;2->Str1
If C=3
Str1+&quot;3->Str1
Y+1->Y
If Y=Z
Stop
Goto A

Feel free to change it as much as you want, but credit me. :) Also
tell me if you make it any shorter. 

Heres a quick programming description of the program:
First, reset the counter to 1 (Y). Input your scramble number, then
start the loop (loop A). Generate a random number C. Heres where I
shortened the program quite a bit. Instead of looking for cases like
FBF it will also cancel FLF or FUF. This is done with A and B. A is
our immediate past, and B is our distant past. If C = A, make a new
number (if FF or RR etc happens, make a new letter). If C = B make a
new number (if FBF or FUF or FLF etc happens, make a new letter).
After you pass those checks, it changes the past into the distant past
and the new letter to the past (past to distant past: A->B  new to
past: C->A). Now we create a rotation. Using the same variable C, make
a new number 1-3. Notice that 1 is never used. That is because 1
rotation can be shown as nothing, so no check is needed. :) After it
adds rotation, 1 is added to the counter which is checked against your
input. If they match, the program ends. Remember, the scramble is
stored in Str1 (Vars-String-Str1). I chose not to display the scramble
at the end because you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see it. The program would
end blocking you from scrolling through the scramble. Thats why you
must pull it up manually. 

Well, enjoy my program. Hope it brings much school time (or work time)
cubing.

to say. There needs to be a standard measurement. Not just 2 tiles of
the table, because tiles are different. Some tiles are thinner, some

thicker tiles to measure, and I get a DNF. If he or she used thinner

My 2 cents.

For Petrus Solves, I figure out the 2x2 (which I think is easier that
the cross).  I decide which corner I am going to use for the 3x2x2
ahead of time.  As I do the 2x2 (which becomes automatic after time),
I watch my CHOSEN CORNER.  Then I quickly throw it in, and have 2
quick edges to insert, finishing the 3x2x2.  


WHAT IS A GOOD TIME FOR A 3x2x2?

For Sub 20, You need to have the F2L done in 14 sec with Oriented
Edges.  COLL and EPLL in 6 sec?  So you need to have maybe 4 sec to
finish the 2 corner edge pairs(2 sec per pair).  

SO that leaves us with 10 sec for 3x2x2 with oriented edges.

I think 6 sec is a good goal for a 3x2x2.

Any Thoughts?

I don&#x27;t use COLL, but it could be a good idea because EPLL is really
fast. But OLL+PLL requires fewer algorithms and recognizition is easier.

I think that 2x2x2-block is much harder than cross, but maybe I&#x27;m just
too bad. That &#x27;chosen corner&#x27; -thing is quite similiar to what I do.

I think 5 seconds is possible.

LL can be done in 5 secs. Step 4 in four seconds seems very ambitious,
but maybe it&#x27;s possible...

Average: 09.88 seconds
Individual Times: 08.02, 10.87, 11.62, (04.83), (12.68), 08.79, 09.03,
09.46, 12.52, 09.14, 08.98, 10.32

That 4.83 was super easy, I saw the whole 2x2x3 during inspection.
Scramble: B&#x27; L U2 B F&#x27; U&#x27; B D2 B2 U B2 L F L R&#x27; B L2 F L&#x27; U2 D2 B&#x27; U&#x27; D2 R


10 seconds isn&#x27;t very hard, I think that 7-8 is possible with practice.

Average: 06.03 seconds
Individual Times: 05.64, 06.76, 04.60, 05.88, (07.95), 06.03, (03.99),

          <div class="email-content">Hey David,

It all depends which part you are doing...if you are learning the LL
algs, most people just blindly memorise them...it works, and will make
you fast, but for the people like me who like to know what they do,
just for the heck of it, we deconstruct, for F2L its a different story
altogether...I&#x27;ve been going over one alg in my head for a few days,
just looking at each piece as it goes...F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;...not too sure
why...just watching it in my head (no cube in my hand) and it is
usually when watching TV or a movie...I just pull the cube up in my
brain and concentrate on one piece and execute the algorithm...meh...

when<br>
the cubes are in the &quot;right orientation&quot;, that after step 4c their<br>
orientation should still be correct?  When I follow the patterns <br>

<br>
&quot;Do it again, as long as wrong orientations remain&quot;<br>
Does this mean that after using the sequence i have to recheck all 6<br>

I guess my question is this: once I get all of the edges in step 4 <br>

          <div class="email-content">You should look closely at the algorithms.  You should try to 
memorize mirror moves.  They are great, you can see the symmetry of 
the cube.

Look at where you can add variations to the algorithms too.

This algorithm orients BR edge of the Middle Layer

(R&#x27; U R&#x27;) (U2 B&#x27;)(R2 B) U2 R2

if you toss in a R2 before the last two turns you can permute two 
edges, rather than orient just the one.  the    

(R&#x27; U R&#x27;) (U2 B&#x27;)(R2 B) [[R2]] U2 R2

The Back and Front Right Mid Layer edges are switched and the 
original BRME is oriented.

Picking apart the algs can be very beneficial.  You stop looking at 
the algs as counter and clock turns.  I feel it&#x27;s better to see the 
algs as turning toward or away from the desired solved edge sets 
final position.  This makes doing the symetrical algs (mirrors) a 
lot easier.

Also discover your own algorithms, add variations to the algs like 
that R2 I added.  Discover the cause and effects of your varaiations 
and the mirror moves.

  I will have the 17 algorithms for the LL memorized WELL by the end of the day. Currently I have almost all of them memorized, but most of them will need practice.... IE, I can remember them, but it reqires thinking, and is not necessarily fast.<br>
   <br>
  My question: to get practice using these algs/executing them quickly from memory, I obviously just need to use them a bunch of times... so, is there a way i could scramble the last layer without messing up my F2L (too much?). That way I could save a lot of time and focus my practice where it is needed.<br>
   <br>
  Just a thought.<br>

The goal of Step 4a is all edges oriented.  The algs to orient are
only a few turns long, but several require you to repeat or use more
than one.  After a short while of practice, you can generally do them
without thinking.  The longest is when all 6 edges are incorrect.  You
have to perform three algs.  Still, with practice, you can see the
initial case and instantly know which steps to go through.

Corners stay oriented when you finish Step 3.  They don&#x27;t change at
all afterward.  I think you meant edges.  Your problem is probably
that you&#x27;re not orienting the DF and DB edges, or perhaps UL and UR.
Try this instead:  Sometime before you begin your step 4 orientation,
try to get the U or D center on top.  Then, orient accordingly.  All
edges with your U or D color will be easy to tell if they are oriented
or not.  In the end, this is not quite as fast, and you aren&#x27;t able to
optimize as well, but this is a much easier orientation definition to
start with.  If an edge has the U or D color facing up (or down on the
D side) it&#x27;s oriented.  If the U or D color is facing the side, it&#x27;s
incorrect.  Try that for a while.  Good luck!

I use CF sometimes, with a ROUX ending. I suggest learning step 4 first.  

Finish corners, fill in 3 ledges and 3 redges.  Make sure that the 2
empty slots are of the same color.  This helps out a lot.  

I use red on top, so I&#x27;ll explain it using red.   When you have 
everything done except step 4, there are 6 edges left.  Of those 6, 4
are red and two are orange.  But they all have red or orange on them.  

Make sure EITHER a red or orange center is on top.  This restricts you
to only doing M2, and any variation of U.  If an edge has a red or
orange facelet on the top or bottom, then its good.  If the sticker
facing up or down is not red or orange , then the edge is bad.

2 bad edges;  (M&#x27;UMU&#x27;)(M&#x27;UM&#x27;)
3 bad on top, 1 in DF;  (M&#x27;UM&#x27;)
3 bad on bottom, 1 in DB; (MUM&#x27;)
4 bad on top; (M&#x27;U2M&#x27;U2)
6 bad edges; (RU&#x27;r&#x27;U&#x27;)(M&#x27;U)(rUr&#x27;)


the last one is an ALG Gustav Fredell found for me.
HOPE THIS HELPS, HAPPY CUBING.

Gilles Roux was under 20 too, before he had to go found his own cult.  
There may well be more. One of my goals for the year is to learn the  
Roux method. It only seems polite. And doing U and slice moves is the  
fastest thing I can do with a cube.

I plan to get sub 20 too one day. I was pretty close on the plane to  
Orlando. And I did my best time ever the other day, 13.98. So there&#x27;s  
still hope.

The cross seems much harder to me, since it&#x27;s so spread out. But I&#x27;m  
very biased in my experience, of course. If you&#x27;re a beginner, I can  
see how the cross is simpler, since the pieces don&#x27;t interact much.

>>
>> WHAT IS A GOOD TIME FOR A 3x2x2?

I&#x27;ve actually never measured this, but I did some quick timing right  
now, and here are my (stackmat) numbers

2x2x3:          7.45 7.36 6.53 6.47 7.51
2x2x3 + OE: 6.55 14.68 7.22 8.71 9.00

If we ignore the blackout, I seem to do roughly 7 for the 2x2x3 and  
8.5 including edge orientation. I you do 6 and 10, it sounds like you  
could squeeze 1-2 seconds out of your step 3 without too much trouble.

I usually meld step 2 and 3 together a bit in that I fix one pair of  
edges while finishing up the 2x2x3. Then there&#x27;s usually only 1 pair  
left.

I normally plan out the full 2x2x2 during preinspection, and usually  
while perforning that, I&#x27;ll spot something more or less good to  
continue with. Just putting the corner in place is not optimal in  
number of moves, and I never do that, but I can see how it simplifies  
things in a way.

My plan/dream is to plan out the full 2x2x3 during preinspection. It  
shouldn&#x27;t be too hard if you work at it. I think practicing by  
planning it all out in your mind and then executing it without  
looking would be a good way. Once you can do it, you just need to get  
it down to 15 seconds. And the blindfold experience should make it  
easier to look at THE OTHER pieces while executing it and be ready to  
continue very quickly once it&#x27;s done. I&#x27;ll probably never get around  
to this, but at least I have a dream.

          <div class="email-content">That actually makes a lot more sense.  So as long as all the 
facelets that are facing up or down are red or orange, then 
they&#x27;re &quot;correct&quot;?

I think the real thing that&#x27;s buggering me is &quot;an edge is correctly 
oriented if you can solve it with a sequence in the group enerated 
by &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2>...  no matter where a side is, if i use one of 
those, i can put it in a &quot;fixed&quot; position.

The red/orange thing made that a lot easier to understand.

so after i get them all in the right orientation, if i use the 3 
combinations from 4b, they won&#x27;t mess up the orientations.

One thing I noticed is that if they are all in the 
right &quot;orientation&quot; and i do something like... M2UMU&#x27;, they still 
all stay in the right orientation.

also, say on the middle row i have all the orange and red either on 
the front or the back, then a simple M or M&#x27; puts them on top or 
bottom, right?

I think i understand now.  Thank you so much!

          <div class="email-content">Ok, heres the problem i keep having.  When i follow the patterns in 
4a, it doesn&#x27;t fix the orientation.  

Right now i have the cube on last 6.  I&#x27;m doing blue and green as my 
top/bottom.  4 of the 6 cubes have the blue facelet either facing up 
or down.  the ones that are not correct are the top-back edge and 
the top-left edge.  So i look on the handy chart and it says 
that &quot;M&#x27;UM&#x27;&quot; will fix it (because that shows the topback and topleft 
edge as purple).  So i do those 3 moves.  now the topleft, topback, 
topright, and bottomfront sides are messed up.  same move is 
supposed to fix it, &quot;M&#x27;UM&#x27;&quot;, so i do it again.  topright and 
bottomfront are now messed up.  thats not on the chart, but if i do 
M2U&#x27;, we&#x27;re back to the first situation where the topback and 
topleft edges are messed up.  am i supposed to just keep doing M&#x27;UM&#x27; 
over and over until it fixes it?  None of these patterns seem to 
accomplish anything...

          <div class="email-content">Hey David, you could get two or three times the practice by executing a couple LL algs randomly and then try to get back to the solved state.  That&#x27;s the way I practice LL algs.
   
  For instance, say I want to practice permuting four edge pieces that all need to move to the opposite face (don&#x27;t know the number of the algs, sorry), then I could do the move once, and the four edges would be mixed.  If i did it again, they would be solved.
   
  Or I could do that move, combined with two more moves, maybe a couple of OLL algs, etc.
   
  Cheers,
  Robbie

Subject: scrambling only one layer?

Hey,
   
  Thanks to everyone who answered my question earlier about LL 
algorithms/memorization.
   
  I will have the 17 algorithms for the LL memorized WELL by the end of 
the day. Currently I have almost all of them memorized, but most of 
them will need practice.... IE, I can remember them, but it reqires 
thinking, and is not necessarily fast.
   
  My question: to get practice using these algs/executing them quickly 
from memory, I obviously just need to use them a bunch of times... so, 
is there a way i could scramble the last layer without messing up my 
F2L (too much?). That way I could save a lot of time and focus my 
practice where it is needed.
   
  Just a thought.
   
  David

You have two problems.  To solve this way, first you need to make sure
you have either the blue or green center on top.  If you have the
other one, you&#x27;ll always end up with two wrong at the end at least. 
Second, you may have to adjust the U face after performing each M&#x27;UM&#x27;
type alg.  When you have the UB and UL incorrect, perform M&#x27;UM&#x27; like
you said.  Then, to match the new orientation to one of the patterns,
do U2.  This gives you incorrect edges at UL+UF+UR.  Now try M&#x27;UM&#x27;. 
Solved orientation.  If you leave your U the same between algs and
don&#x27;t match the pictures, there&#x27;s almost no way to get a correct
orientation.  Try that.  Good luck.

To solve that case on top, where you probably should be holding your
LL, try (M U)*3 U (M&#x27; U)*3 U.

To solve the orientation, moving around other edges, try (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)
M&#x27; (U R U&#x27; r).

To flip adjacent edges, leaving everything in place, try M U M&#x27; U2 (M
U)*3 U M&#x27; U M2.  You could also try it from the opposite side, as M&#x27; U
is bound to be faster.  I&#x27;m just too lazy to learn a new alg.

To flip adjacent edges, moving around other edges, use M U M&#x27; U2 M U M&#x27;.

wmv probably would make a smaller file size, but the quality might be
lower. I dont how many settings you can adjust, so I can&#x27;t really be
sure. Make a mpg if you want to make DVD, and use wmv with low
settings to make a small download-able file.

I cant wait to see it!!

I highly recommend (assuming right-handed) to do this:
(R&#x27;D&#x27;RD)M(D&#x27;R&#x27;Dr) I used to use this alg all the time (as is).

Now to be more advanced about it, the popular 
convention/recommendation is to hold the cube with the LL on top. In 
that case it would be:
(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(rR&#x27;U)(RU&#x27;r&#x27;)

It&#x27;s the same as the one I discovered myself but I would attribute 
it to Bob. I first saw it on his site.

As for the ELL case, I would just use the (M&#x27;U)^3 U (Mu)^3 U alg 
that I attribute to Macky, when I leanred it for BLD. I have an 
optimized one for ELL that I use in my CLL/ELL system though that is 
rather complicated but much faster.

THat is the ALG that I thought I &quot;discovered&quot; 3 weeks ago, but mirrored

M&#x27;UMU2M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2MUM2

It has 4 M&#x27;s, which are the fastest M moves I can do.  I guess M2 is
also pretty fast, for what it is.

THis alg is a lot faster that MUMUMU2 M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2

And yes i know that they&#x27;re not the same case..

          <div class="email-content">Hello Lars and Everyone

I think that making a 3x2x2 in one look is hard.  7 pieces to track. 
The cross is 4(CFOP).  The White Corners is 4 (waterman).  THE 2x2 is
4 pieces as well. Extended Cross (2x2 plus 2 edges) is 6 pieces.  Not
as hard as a 3x2x2, but still pretty hard.

My approach to Petrus is to do a 2x2 and track a corner.  SO 5 pieces.

A 3x2x1 is also 5 pieces.  I can do it in 1 look roughly 30-40% of the
time.  Most of the time,  I can only form a 2x2x1 and track the other
2 pieces.

Either way, a ROUX block is usually pretty quick; about 9-10 moves.  

WHAT Is the Avg move count for a 3x2x2? (same 4 blocks)
WHAT is the Avg move count for a 3x2x1? (same 4 blocks)

I use white/red white/orange yellow/red and yellow/orange

I&#x27;ve seen calculations for the optimal cross solve.
MATH people, can you help me?


THank you

As for file size, I guess WMV would be smaller.  It uses MPEG-4 by

I usually try to do step 3 very very slowly and plan step 4 as much as<br>

Not a good question. The format alone doesn&#x27;t define the file size. 
Quality is more important. You don&#x27;t want it uncompressed (that would 
be stupidly huge) so you have a quality/filesize trade-off.

For example, Windows Movie Maker let&#x27;s you create .wmv files of your 
desired size. You enter the goal file size, it adjusts the quality 
accordingly.

Cheers!
Stefan

Clarification: Actually I should&#x27;ve said &quot;losslessly compressed&quot; 
instead of &quot;uncompressed&quot;. Both result in way too large files, though.

          <div class="email-content">I was actually just starting to figure out the thing about the 
centers.  I didn&#x27;t see them noted and must have missed where that 
was mentioned.  I spent about an hour just moving sides around and 
seeing what changes and what doesn&#x27;t change orientation, and noticed 
that if all 4 were fixed, sometimes after aligning the centers all 4 
would be wrong.

One question though... how much faster is this than doing position 
first and just fixing the (usually only one) orientation problem 
with M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2 MU&#x27;MU&#x27;MU2?  One way or another you need to put the 
cubes in the right location, so that should take the same number of 
moves, but isn&#x27;t it faster just to do the 12 move switch rather than 
having to keep chasing down sides and doing patterns that aren&#x27;t 
always predictable?  For me, on a random cube with &quot;final six&quot;, the 
way i do it is usually either 20-24 moves (if one side is oriented 
wrong), or 10-12 moves if they&#x27;re already fixed.  Essentially i&#x27;m 
wondering how the 12 move zero recognition time thing stacks up 
against messing with the orientations.

M-turns and U-turns with U/D center on top never change orientations.

Quarter-U-turns with F/B center on top change orientations of all four 
edges in the U layer.

What do you mean, not predictable?

Not at all.  Following Gilles&#x27; Step 4, you can generally average fewer
than 14 moves to place and orient all 6 edges, without learning any of
the special cases.  The fact that you can orient the edges in around 7
moves helps, because M&#x27;U moves are incredibly fast.  Those
orientations are very easy to recognize.  Just go through each one and
memorize which of the 3 move algs needs to happen when.  Most of them
are just M&#x27;U M&#x27; U adjustment M&#x27;U M&#x27;.  After that, learn to place the
UR and UL edges simultaneously, giving you a simple 3 edge cycle in a
slice to finish most of the time.  Very fast.

          <div class="email-content">Has anyone tried Petrus without OE and then finishing with OLL/PLL? I always
found the OE step of Petrus to be somewhat inefficient (sorry Lars) unless
you would finish with ZBLL. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different f2l
methods, and I like the move counts the Petrus Method provides for the f2l.
The total move count for f2l is around 5 moves less than fridrich, a
potential 1-1.5 second improvement. The only holdback is recognition times,
but a planned out 2x2x2 can allow for being able to see at least a
corner/edge pair for the 2x2x3, and a follow up with either fridrich style
or placing a corner/edge pair and then insert an edge in the D layer is
fast.

  I refuse to memorize 41 algorithms. I would be unable to do this anyways. Plus, even if this were a good idea, lots of people have told me DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE THOSE, IT SHOULD BE INTUITIVE.. so, i&#x27;m going to try to follow that advice :)<br>
   <br>
  Any good guides for F2L? Craig recommended the one at http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step2.shtml .

Most people will tell you not to memorize algorithms, and start doing
f2l intuitively on your own, but I still think that you should
memorize them for the sake of understanding what moves do what on your
cube. Once you memorize the algorithms, step back a bit and just spend
time to understand what is happened with each piece. After you do so,
you will understand what to do intuitively and build off there.

the guide is different from my cube. But, if you guys agree  that it
is a good guide, I could just go through and change the 
text/pictures, switching around BLUE and YELLOW, thus making it match
 my cube. (Is that right?)

Dan calls it &quot;advanced&quot; but I&#x27;d at least call 1-2 &quot;basic&quot;:

          <div class="email-content">I was in the EXACT same boat you were quite recently (around<br>
November-December). After using it for a couple of months, I have to<br>
say that learning the F2L algs intuitively is awesome :). <br>
<br>
Yes, at the beginning, it&#x27;s difficult, and yes, almost always, your<br>
times will be worse when you&#x27;re starting. But keep at it, and your<br>
times will go down very much. The advantages of intuitive F2L are<br>
many, those which I can elaborate on if you want me too. <br>
But to answer your questions:<br>
http://www.snkenjoi.com/wikicube/mediawiki-1.5.3/index.php?title=Intuitive_F2L<br>
<br>
That website goes over intuitive F2L very well for someone starting to<br>
learn it. In terms of tips for it, I would most recommend just playing<br>
around with the cube after the cross is done, and thinking about ways<br>
to  put together corner-edge pairs in different situations. A page of<br>
algorithms comes in handy when you absolutely cannot figure out how to<br>
do it. But experiment, and have fun with it!<br>
I don&#x27;t think my response was too good, so if you have more questions,<br>
feel free to ask me.<br>

          <div class="email-content">
You basically want to have a situation with 3 bad edges on top, and 1
on the bottom, either in DF or DB

If in DF, M&#x27;UM&#x27;
If in DB, MUM&#x27;

BUT HERE&#x27;s THE COOL PART; you can change the M&#x27; to M or vice versa. 
In addition, you can change which way you do U as well.  All that
matters is the first move(M or M&#x27;)

If in DF, M&#x27;UM&#x27; or M&#x27;UM or M&#x27;U&#x27;M&#x27; or M&#x27;U&#x27;M
If in DB, MUM&#x27; or MUM or MU&#x27;M&#x27; or MU&#x27;M.  


Each of these has a different affect on the positions of the 6 edges.
You can pick which one of the 4 you do to control where your ledge and
redge end up.  I strongly suggest using White and YEllow on L and R,
because tracking bright pieces is easy, even at full turning speed.

Once edges are oriented, If you have a ledge or redge in DF, put the
other ledge/redge in UB and Do M&#x27;U2M&#x27;

You want to have ledge and redge paired up on the bottom, with all
edges oriented.  THen simply do a U adjustment, and insert ledge and
redge simultaneously.  THis is what Mike B was talking about.


you should be averaging under 15 moves with practice
Here are a couple posts I put up awhile ago

don&#x27;t feel bad, I lived in Germany for 4 years when I was younger 
and didn&#x27;t learn anything but how to count to ten... incorrectly :-(

Trying as best as I can to hold onto the German I know now, but it&#x27;s 
hard to speak not-English in America, definitely :-(

I still love it here, but wish we were more multilingual as a 
culture.

And yes I am mightily impressed by the times seen in Korea.  
Awesome - awesome stuff.

Christophe<br>
&gt; Hey,<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   Yesterday I memorized what I suppose are &quot;the basic&quot; 17 LL algs, improving my cubing quite a bit from the method I had been using... from what I&#x27;ve heard, the next thing I should do (besides of course practicing and getting faster) is learn how to do F2L. Currently, I do the first and second layers seperately, and it usually takes me around a minute or so to do the F2L (35/25). (That number is based off of one trial)<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   I refuse to memorize 41 algorithms. I would be unable to do this anyways. Plus, even if this were a good idea, lots of people have told me DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE THOSE, IT SHOULD BE INTUITIVE.. so, i&#x27;m going to try to follow that advice :)<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   Any good guides for F2L? Craig recommended the one at http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step2.shtml . However, the problem with this guide is that the color-scheme on the cube in the guide is different from my cube. But, if you guys agree that it is a good guide, I could just go through and change the text/pictures, switching around BLUE and YELLOW, thus making it match my cube. (Is that right?)<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   I want to know if that guide is good, before I take the time to do that... or maybe you guys know of some other good guides... let me know what you think is best. I need to learn intuitive F2L!!<br>
&gt;   <br>
&gt; Thanks<br>

Yeah... actually strange, since I think they generally speak English 
well (at least the top cubers there do, I spent some time with them so 
I know).

Maybe a smaller version for people with dialup is also a good idea. Either

Wow, I&#x27;ve never seen one like this. What do you mean you can&#x27;t turn 
the 1x2x3 blocks? Are they hard to turn or do they not turn at all? In 
any case, how to take it apart of course depends on the mechanism. Any 
info or pictures (e.g. with parts turned 45 degrees) you can provide 
us might help...

Cheers!
Stefan

mechanism, are there different Domino&#x27;s that have different mechanisms?

Wow, I&#x27;ve never seen one like this. What do you mean you can&#x27;t turn 
the 1x2x3 blocks? Are they hard to turn or do they not turn at all? In 
any case, how to take it apart of course depends on the mechanism. Any 
info or pictures (e.g. with parts turned 45 degrees) you can provide 
us might help...

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m curious about move counts as well.

I use a slightly modified Petrus method (I create 1x1x3 first and 
finish with OLL/PLL), with fifty solves I average
2x2x3 15 moves
F2L   41 moves
LL    23 moves
Total average for 50 solves was 64 moves

Anyone else have F2L move counts?

the Rubik&#x27;s cube really counts as a &quot;puzzle&quot; to speedcubers, once they&#x27;ve<br>
reduced solving it to a method.  Putting together the maze would (at least<br>
momentarily) make it a puzzle again, even with my existing arsenal of<br>
speedcubing algorithms.<br>

Plus I&#x27;m curious if anybody speed-solves the colorblind cube.  I wonder if<br>
it would take longer (or even shorter??) to solve once my mind switched to<br>

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s an article from German magazine &quot;Spiegel&quot; (&quot;Mirror&quot;). I used to <br>
think they&#x27;re a serious intelligent magazine, at least they do pretend <br>
do be. But now this:<br>
<br>
http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,395614,00.html<br>
<br>
Oh wow, wait... they fixed it a bit. My dad printed it a few days ago <br>
when it said:<br>
<br>
&quot;Er drehte die Farben in 11,13 Sekunden in die richtige Position - mit <br>
verbundenen Augen.&quot;<br>
<br>
(&quot;He turned the colors in 11.13 seconds into the right position - <br>
blindfolded.&quot;)<br>
<br>
So now they removed the &quot;blindfolded&quot;. But they still say Leyan beat <br>
all other competitors (not true, Macky won) and that for this he only <br>
needed six of eight attempts (pure nonsense bullshit).<br>
<br>
Compared to the earlier version they also deleted this sentence:<br>
<br>
&quot;Den Weltmeister-Titel konnte Lo allerdings nicht ergattern, dafuer <br>
haette er nur fuenf Versuche brauchen duerfen&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Lo didn&#x27;t get the world champion title (correct, since it wasn&#x27;t <br>
the world championship, you dumbass), for that he would&#x27;ve needed to <br>
do it with only five attempts (AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!)&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Actually I should&#x27;ve known better. Two years ago they wrote a short <br>
article about the 2003 world championship. In an article about half as <br>
long as this new one (sorry, can&#x27;t find it anymore) they managed to <br>
make several serious mistakes and insult Jessica Fridrich. I think <br>
they first mentioned that she had been a competitor 1982 already. And <br>
then they said her method is now obsolete. And that despite her 2nd <br>
place and champion Dan Knights using her system. Gosh...<br>

Ok, found it, but it&#x27;s not free anymore, would&#x27;ve to pay half a Euro 
for it and it&#x27;s not worth it. But here&#x27;s the link/title/introduction

Oh yes, there are several different!

Go to http://www.twistypuzzles.com/
In the menu, choose &quot;Puzzle Database&quot; - &quot;Search&quot;
Use keyword search for &quot;domino&quot;

Then you can see a few different. Spindle and Groove are considerable 
different and you can see how they work. The one with the indented 
pips looks still different (look at the pictures on its own site by 
clicking on it). The custom made &quot;2x3x3&quot; is (usually) a keychain 3x3 
hidden inside cubies from a normal 3x3.

No idea about the Marvel/Lettered/Blindman. And if you don&#x27;t care 
about weight/size you can turn a 4x4 cube into a domino easily.

I think yours is probably that standard spindle or groove version. Can 
you try to look between the pieces inside the puzzle? Do you see split 
spindle pieces?

If it&#x27;s a split spindle (i.e. like the one you&#x27;ve seen from me) then 
I&#x27;d say popping an edge is not the best idea, but if the center cap is 
really stuck it&#x27;s probably your best bet. You could try to pull down 
the spindle with e.g. a screwdriver while you pull the edge up. You&#x27;d 
need to get the edge piece over that half-circle at the end of the 
spindle arm. Never tried that, though. And it depends on how loose 
your puzzle is I&#x27;d say.

Cheers!
Stefan

my solve at Euro2004, and it took me embarassingly long to just 
analyze/memorize. After about 3 hours or so I had to give up cause 
another event started. But at that point I had already made two 
mistakes or so. Next time I&#x27;ll be prepared better, I swear.

Try solving 3x3 blindfolded first, that&#x27;s really easy. And then to 
step up to the larger puzzles it&#x27;s just a matter of memorization 
techniques. And a matter of dedication/motivation. It&#x27;s all a matter

          <div class="email-content">Hey David,

doing the 5x5x5 blindfolded is certainly not impossible, and in fact 
a number of people have done it.  See 
http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_bf_555.html

As far as how exactly you do it, you don&#x27;t update the cube in your 
head with every turn, you solve with longer sequences that move only 
3 pieces at a time (or flip 2 pieces at a time).  These are almost 
always intuitive commutators (permutations in the form X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; 
where X and Y are two separate permutations).

So for example if I want to cycle just 3 wing edges on a 5x5x5, and 
change absolutely nothing else on the cube (this is the key part) 
then I could do something like this R&#x27; d R U R&#x27; d&#x27; R U&#x27;

If you do this on a 5x5x5 you&#x27;ll see that it only affects 3 edge 
pieces, and if you look deeper you&#x27;ll see that absolutely nothing 
else on the whole cube changes.

So what you do is memorize how the different types of pieces cycle 
back to their original places.

There are only 5 types of pieces on a 5x5x5, and they are corners, 
central edges, wing edges, and two types of centers (called +centers 
and Xcenters).

If you memorize the cycles of each piece type, as well as the 
orientations of the corners and central edges, you can use moves to 
either move or flip pieces without affecting anything else.

For example if I want to flip two central edges without changing 
anything else I can do R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27; U R e2 R2 e R U&#x27;

This long move is just a commutator of the form X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27;

X = R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27;
Y = U

and you can see how it is made.

Check out the blindfolded group at 
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/ if 
you are interested in learning more about blindfold solving.

So in short it&#x27;s definitely not impossible to do a 5x5x5 
blindfolded.  Not easy, yes, but definitely possible.

Hope this helps,
Chris

Did you see the videos on the link Ron posted at speedcubing.com?

The 12.82 by Yoon Seon Gyu looks like it could have potentially been 
sub-12, had it not been for slow PLL recognition.

Pretty impressive, considering it was his first official contest...

Chris, you&#x27;re trying to point out that you solve in very small 
changes. Then why suggest moving 3 pieces when 2 is possible?

I&#x27;m curious about move counts as well.

I use a slightly modified Petrus method (I create 1x1x3 first and 
finish with OLL/PLL), with fifty solves I average
2x2x3 15 moves
F2L   41 moves
LL    23 moves
Total average for 50 solves was 64 moves

Anyone else have F2L move counts?

          <div class="email-content">  That is mind boggling... I&#x27;m very  impressed.. obviously I want to be much more impressed with Chris&#x27;s solving it in 40 minutes, but part of me is just as amazed that Stefan can go for 2.5 hours without making one mistake or becoming suicidal.. -.-
   
   I don&#x27;t think my memory would allow me to do that.. I am extremely interested in learning how to solve one WITHOUT blindfold, however... I&#x27;ll ask for a prof cube for my birthday which is in 3 weeks ^_^
   
  Quick question: on Rubiks.com, it has a big WARNING message on the revenge/professor cube saying that due to having many more moving parts, these cubes are much more delicate than the 3x3x3 and are &quot;not suitable for speedcubing&quot;. Does this just mean that these cubes are more likely to pop a piece, or that they are actually prone to true breakage? 
   
  Second quick question: When would you recommend I start learning how to blindfold the 3x3x3? I have only been seriously cubing for about a month, and I currently average maybe 1:50 or so (just memorized the basic 17 algs for PLL/OLL, so i expect my times will start to decrease as these become more second-nature to me).
   
  Third quick question: are there some people who simply can&#x27;t learn to blindfold? b/c if there are, I would bet (from knowing the way I think/learn/etc) that I am one of them :-(
   
  Thanks,

  Hey David,

doing the 5x5x5 blindfolded is certainly not impossible, and in fact 
a number of people have done it.  See 
http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_bf_555.html

As far as how exactly you do it, you don&#x27;t update the cube in your 
head with every turn, you solve with longer sequences that move only 
3 pieces at a time (or flip 2 pieces at a time).  These are almost 
always intuitive commutators (permutations in the form X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; 
where X and Y are two separate permutations).

So for example if I want to cycle just 3 wing edges on a 5x5x5, and 
change absolutely nothing else on the cube (this is the key part) 
then I could do something like this R&#x27; d R U R&#x27; d&#x27; R U&#x27;

If you do this on a 5x5x5 you&#x27;ll see that it only affects 3 edge 
pieces, and if you look deeper you&#x27;ll see that absolutely nothing 
else on the whole cube changes.

So what you do is memorize how the different types of pieces cycle 
back to their original places.

There are only 5 types of pieces on a 5x5x5, and they are corners, 
central edges, wing edges, and two types of centers (called +centers 
and Xcenters).

If you memorize the cycles of each piece type, as well as the 
orientations of the corners and central edges, you can use moves to 
either move or flip pieces without affecting anything else.

For example if I want to flip two central edges without changing 
anything else I can do R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27; U R e2 R2 e R U&#x27;

This long move is just a commutator of the form X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27;

X = R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27;
Y = U

and you can see how it is made.

Check out the blindfolded group at 
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/ if 
you are interested in learning more about blindfold solving.

So in short it&#x27;s definitely not impossible to do a 5x5x5 
blindfolded.  Not easy, yes, but definitely possible.

Hope this helps,
Chris

at any point in my life, I would be delighted and fascinated to hear 
exactly HOW you would do something like that... IE, do you (after 
every move), go through all the sides, picturing what colors were 
placed where as a result of your move? Is your memory THAT good?

          <div class="email-content">Hey David,<br>
<br>
Answers to your questions below:<br>
<br>
&gt;   Quick question: on Rubiks.com, it has a big WARNING message on the<br>
&gt;revenge/professor cube saying that due to having many more moving<br>
&gt;parts, these cubes are much more delicate than the 3x3x3 and are &quot;not<br>
&gt;suitable for speedcubing&quot;. Does this just mean that these cubes are<br>
&gt;more likely to pop a piece, or that they are actually prone to true<br>
&gt;breakage? <br>
<br>
That&#x27;s just their warning so that if you do break it you can&#x27;t sue or<br>
anything.  Basically, don&#x27;t be surprised if you do twist an Xcenter<br>
(the centers that are closest to the corners) and it breaks. <br>
www.cubesmith.com sells replacement pieces, and I belive rubiks.com<br>
might as well.<br>
<br>
The rubiks.com 5x5&#x27;s are the ones that a lot of people use for<br>
speedcubing though, so no worries.<br>
<br>
&gt;   Second quick question: When would you recommend I start learning<br>
&gt;how to blindfold the 3x3x3? I have only been seriously cubing for<br>
&gt;about a month, and I currently average maybe 1:50 or so (just<br>
&gt;memorized the basic 17 algs for PLL/OLL, so i expect my times will<br>
&gt;start to decrease as these become more second-nature to me).<br>
<br>
You can learn how to blindfold solve anytime you want really.  Again<br>
check out the blindsolving group, but there are tutorials written on<br>
how to blindfold solve (check out Macky&#x27;s and Tyson&#x27;s tutorials.  I<br>
think Leyan may also have one, but not sure).  It won&#x27;t harm your<br>
speedcubing at all, and is just a different way to solve.  I would<br>
personally recommend starting with either the corners only of a 3x3x3<br>
cube or a 2x2x2 cube blindfolded.  Like anything blindfold solving<br>
works by learning the basics and working up.  Though you could learn<br>
to solve the 5x5 first, it would be a lot harder in my opinion.  I<br>
think your time would be better spent learning the 2x2, then the 3x3,<br>
then the 4x4, then the 5x5.  Though you should know that there are<br>
people who have done the 3x3 then gone straight to the 5x5, so it<br>
really is up to you.<br>
<br>
&gt;   Third quick question: are there some people who simply can&#x27;t learn<br>
&gt;to blindfold? b/c if there are, I would bet (from knowing the way I<br>
&gt;think/learn/etc) that I am one of them :-(<br>
<br>
Absolutely not.  I am totally convinced that anyone could learn to do<br>
this.  It takes only the desire to do it, and dedication to practice<br>
and train your memory.  Now I do believe that some people are gifted<br>
with a stronger memory than most, but anyone can train their memory to<br>
do things that might now seem impossible to you right now.  Your<br>
memory, and anyone&#x27;s for that matter, is definitely trainable, and<br>
with practice you definitely could do the cube blindfolded (yes even<br>
the 5x5), no doubt at all.  One thing that working on blindfold<br>
solving taught me is that your memory is actually much *better* than<br>
you think it is.  You&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;ll actually have a problem with<br>
trying to *forget* information from a previous solve, even though a<br>
lot of time has passed since then.<br>
<br>
In short I think blindfoldsolving is for everyone, and is achievable<br>
by everyone.  Anyone who thinks they can&#x27;t blindfold solve, I am<br>
convinced I could teach you how to do it (and any BLD solver really<br>
could teach you how to do it), but I would offer to help if I can. <br>
Just look for me on yahoo messenger (cmhardw).  All it takes is just<br>
for you to want to do it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That is mind boggling... I&#x27;m very  impressed.. obviously I want to be much more impressed with Chris&#x27;s solving it in 40 minutes, but part of me is just as amazed that Stefan can go for 2.5 hours without making one mistake or becoming suicidal.. -.-
   
   I don&#x27;t think my memory would allow me to do that.. I am extremely interested in learning how to solve one WITHOUT blindfold, however... I&#x27;ll ask for a prof cube for my birthday which is in 3 weeks ^_^
   
  Quick question: on Rubiks.com, it has a big WARNING message on the revenge/professor cube saying that due to having many more moving parts, these cubes are much more delicate than the 3x3x3 and are &quot;not suitable for speedcubing&quot;. Does this just mean that these cubes are more likely to pop a piece, or that they are actually prone to true breakage? 
   
  Second quick question: When would you recommend I start learning how to blindfold the 3x3x3? I have only been seriously cubing for about a month, and I currently average maybe 1:50 or so (just memorized the basic 17 algs for PLL/OLL, so i expect my times will start to decrease as these become more second-nature to me).
   
  Third quick question: are there some people who simply can&#x27;t learn to blindfold? b/c if there are, I would bet (from knowing the way I think/learn/etc) that I am one of them :-(

  Hey David,

doing the 5x5x5 blindfolded is certainly not impossible, and in fact 
a number of people have done it.  See 
http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_bf_555.html

As far as how exactly you do it, you don&#x27;t update the cube in your 
head with every turn, you solve with longer sequences that move only 
3 pieces at a time (or flip 2 pieces at a time).  These are almost 
always intuitive commutators (permutations in the form X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; 
where X and Y are two separate permutations).

So for example if I want to cycle just 3 wing edges on a 5x5x5, and 
change absolutely nothing else on the cube (this is the key part) 
then I could do something like this R&#x27; d R U R&#x27; d&#x27; R U&#x27;

If you do this on a 5x5x5 you&#x27;ll see that it only affects 3 edge 
pieces, and if you look deeper you&#x27;ll see that absolutely nothing 
else on the whole cube changes.

So what you do is memorize how the different types of pieces cycle 
back to their original places.

There are only 5 types of pieces on a 5x5x5, and they are corners, 
central edges, wing edges, and two types of centers (called +centers 
and Xcenters).

If you memorize the cycles of each piece type, as well as the 
orientations of the corners and central edges, you can use moves to 
either move or flip pieces without affecting anything else.

For example if I want to flip two central edges without changing 
anything else I can do R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27; U R e2 R2 e R U&#x27;

This long move is just a commutator of the form X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27;

X = R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27;
Y = U

and you can see how it is made.

Check out the blindfolded group at 
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/ if 
you are interested in learning more about blindfold solving.

So in short it&#x27;s definitely not impossible to do a 5x5x5 
blindfolded.  Not easy, yes, but definitely possible.

Hope this helps,
Chris

at any point in my life, I would be delighted and fascinated to hear 
exactly HOW you would do something like that... IE, do you (after 
every move), go through all the sides, picturing what colors were 
placed where as a result of your move? Is your memory THAT good?

Hey, this is Marcus.  I think anyone can solve the cube blindfolded <br>
with enough practice and dedication -- and you don&#x27;t necessarily <br>
need to know how to speedsolve one in order to do it, as an entirely <br>
different set of algorithms are used.  I think in order to blindfold <br>
solve well you need a good visual mind and memory.  <br>
<br>
And yeah the 4x4x4 cubes tend to break a lot.  My friend&#x27;s 4x4x4&#x27;s <br>
center pieces snapped into pieces once.<br>
<br>
To begin, definitely try to first blindfold solve a 3x3x3.  There <br>
are plenty of algs to get you started -- you don&#x27;t need OLL or PLL <br>
or anything like that, however.  Even for a beginner I would say, if <br>
you really tried hard, you could blindfold solve your first cube in <br>
under an hour, given the extra time dedicated to memorizing cube <br>
positions and ensuring your algorithms are correctly implemented, <br>
etc.<br>
<br>
I wouldn&#x27;t even think about the 5x5x5 until you master the 3x3x3 but <br>
that is just my advice.  Happy cubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok... this is my third try. Yahoo doesn&#x27;t like me.

Hi Dennis,

I bought 3 of those from Tradera too last year. Great price for an 
unusual item (about $2 for you foreigners :) . Mine were also stiff as 
hell to begin with but I turned mine like in your first picture and 
managed to get the edge out. The center cap is glued on so you need a 
thin sharp knife to cut it open in the seam. You will want to get it off 
eventually anyhow cause&#x27; beneath it is a screw and a spring and 
adjusting the spring will do miracles for the puzzle. I completely 
dissassembled mine, cleaned, and lubed it and adjusted the tension... 
like a whole new puzzle. Still not great, but compared to before it&#x27;s 
awesome. An additional adjustment you might want to make is to sand the 
end of the springs flat. They stick out pretty much and gets caught in 
the surrounding plastic.

And for those who are interested, it&#x27;s a groove mechanism.

The second picture is as much I dare to rotate the block (or R,L,B,F)
layers. The U (and D) layer is no problem to rotate. What do you mean by
mechanism, are there different Domino&#x27;s that have different mechanisms?

Wow, I&#x27;ve never seen one like this. What do you mean you can&#x27;t turn the 
1x2x3 blocks? Are they hard to turn or do they not turn at all? In any 
case, how to take it apart of course depends on the mechanism. Any info 
or pictures (e.g. with parts turned 45 degrees) you can provide us might 
help...

Cheers!

well, that kind of depends on what system you use... I
learned blindsolving with the method described on
stefan pochmanns site. all you need for the method is
4 PLL algorithms (or just 2 or well actually just 1),
and a bunch of very short and intuï¿½tive setup moves
that you can come up with while doing the solve.
never tried anything besides 3x3x3 (so far) but i&#x27;m
quite convinced too that anyone can solve one
blindfolded. all it takes is, as said by other people
before me :-), motivation and dedication!

greetz,
sander

worth watching. I was watching the show with some friends who all 
thought Tyson was definitely less geeky than many of the other guys.

I&#x27;m glad to see that Tyson&#x27;s cube has made numerous appearances 
already. I&#x27;m still hoping to see one of the girls playing with it 
though. It would be awesome if they learnt the cube, but I&#x27;m guessing 
that&#x27;s not going to happen (maybe just one layer?? surely they could 
manage this much??)

BTW, on an unrelated note, unrelated except for the fact that it also 
involves the USA, I&#x27;m in Hawaii at the moment! I&#x27;ll tell you all why 
later (doesn&#x27;t involve cubing or reality TV shows).

Are there people who can&#x27;t learn blindsolving? Yes. Dead people.

Oh wow, can you sell me one for let&#x27;s say $10 so I can take it to Ebay 
and sell it for $100?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, they do.  For example, they&#x27;ll announce that Lance Armstrong 
is in the studio, then that same fat guy will ride around the 
theatre on a bicycle in full Tour de France gear.  It&#x27;s a running 
gag on the show to do that.  Since Leyan was famous in the news 
recently, I doubt there is anything illegal about it.

It&#x27;s a dumb gag, but I still find it cool that some top cubers (and 
thus cubing in general) are getting media exposure right now.

<br>
After a while of not cubing a lot, I started taking some averages <br>
today... I was happy that I could still average sub16 without <br>
problems... Because I didn&#x27;t cube much for a while, I am pretty <br>
inconsistent, but I can still get some nice 13&#x27;s :).<br>
<br>
The thing is, I started having some nice times: 12,11 15,42 13,45 <br>
13,76 11,70 (lucky, but still nice)... And after this I started to get <br>
very nervous, getting bad times. And this is not the first time <br>
something like this happens.<br>
<br>
What do you guys do when you write down your times to stay focussed? <br>
<br>
Happy cubing ;),<br>

I&#x27;ve never actually timed it, but could of course give it a try. What 
are the restrictions on the puzzle you use? Do if I have to use one of 
those discussed earlier or can I use say a custom made one, made by 4x4x4&#x27;s?

You should learn Petrus method, it&#x27;s good for beginners because it
requires very few algorithms. And you can get very fast with it.

Depends, I&#x27;d say. If you simply simulate a domino on a standard 4x4, 
that should *not* count. Cause recoginition is considerably different. 
Why don&#x27;t you just use your real Domino? Is it still that bad?

never seen the actual article.  Thanks for the upload.

For anyone who hasn&#x27;t read Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;Magic Cubology&quot; 
articles from Scientific American (1981 and 1982), these are also 
worth a read.  You can read most, if not all, of the articles at 
http://books.google.com/ (search for Metamagical Themas, a book that 
also contains the articles).

2x2x3 = 14.3
F2L+OE= 22.6
LL    = 18.9
Total = 55.8 

I started doing this to improve my time - I was
averaging(not Petrus) about 90 moves/solve and doing
that in 2min.  I saw Petrus, understood it now average
45s/solve - 31s(pers.best)  I have only been
speedcubing for 4 months - I am now working on
recognition.  Moves help you know where you can
improve.  Good luck and happy cubing.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

you can find finger tricks videos in our yahoo FILES section. Click on
FILES on the left side and go to the folder DAN K&#x27;S FINGERTRICKS.


METHOD:
I&#x27;d like to recommend Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s method.
Personally, I learned Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s method from here:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01.shtml

WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND (I taught someone how to solve the first
two layers in about 2 weeks):

I assume that you can form the cross. Then I can give the following tips:

1) First thing after the cross: Learn how to bring a corner-edge pair
to the upper layer. On the twistypuzzles website above, we look for
blue corners and their corresponding edge. Blue is our &quot;target&quot;-colour
here.
(Note: Most websites refer to white as their &quot;target&quot; colour, here it
is blue. Just think of &quot;white&quot; when I write &quot;blue&quot; in the following
text if you like. I personally also use white as &quot;target&quot; colour.)

What is a corner edge pair? Let&#x27;s have a look here:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step3.shtml
Consider the first cube image. Remember, our target colour is blue.
We see the blue-green-orange corner cubie on the top layer right in
front of us. The corresponding edge is green-orange. Why green orange?
=> We said blue-green-orange, right? Now take away the target colour
blue and you get green-orange.

2) Secondly: Analyze how to PAIR UP a corner-edge pair, that is how to
bring a corner and it&#x27;s corresponding edge together on the upper layer.

In the following cases the corners with a blue sticker (blue is our
target colour) are in the top layer.

Basically what you have to recognize is that there are only TWO cases:

Case a) Blue sticker on TOP of corner cubie, see here:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step3.shtml
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step6.shtml
Analyze and understand how to bring the corner and it&#x27;s corresponding
edge together.

Case b) Blue sticker NOT ON TOP of corner cubie, see here:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step4.shtml
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step5.shtml
Analyze and understand how to bring the corner and it&#x27;s corresponding
edge together.

This step, namely to understand the pairing up is very important!

Then, once you&#x27;ve understood step 2, go on:

3) Of course, you have to learn how to put in a &quot;corner-edge pair&quot; in
it&#x27;s correct slot. This is shown on the second half of the website:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step3.shtml

Then follows the TOP LAYER:

4) Form the cross on the top (=last) layer:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step7.shtml

5) Then swap (=permute) the corners:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step8.shtml
(&quot;swap corners&quot; is also called &quot;permute corners&quot; on other websites)

6) Rotate (=orient) the corners:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step9.shtml
(&quot;Rotate corners&quot; is also called &quot;orient corners&quot; on other websites)

7) Swap (=permute) the edges of the top layer:
http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01-step10.shtml
(&quot;Swap edges&quot; is also called &quot;permute edges&quot; on other websites).

FINISHED :)

8) Some additional tips:
Definitely buy silicon spray and apply it to the inner of your cube,
but it should be 100% silicon, otherwise the plastic of your cube
could be destroyed.

9) Learn fingertricks, especially for the last layer. That REALLY
makes it easier to memorize algorithms.


What&#x27;s really fun about Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s method is that you improve
quite fast.



Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Ok, Stefan and Gustav.
It was the grooved version of the Domino. I figured that out when trying to
pop one of the edges, since I was afraid to destroy the center cap since it
was so hard glued on. However, I didn&#x27;t succeed to disassemble my Domino
even when using my largest screwdriver to really force a popping edge. But
the outcome was that the puzzle now works when it had been &quot;stretched&quot; a
bit. I squirted some silicon spray into the puzzle and it turned into
&quot;decent&quot; puzzle. Now it&#x27;s solved but I think I will try Domino speedsolving
later on. Btw, nice scrambles for the Domino.

No, it&#x27;s not that bad. But my lagre one made out of 4x4x4&#x27;s (I think) is

know your cube. look for shorter ways. check out macky&#x27;s site. you

example. scramble:

That plus some more practice and I was well on my way to finding crosses

I hate half-turns :-)
The only half-turn I like is U2, and my U2 is in fact 2 moves, UU.

P.S.: That&#x27;s why HTM is not a... oops!

Why? If you want to know about his method, he wrote a book. Oops,

I do like R2s. Especially for Domino. Where I&#x27;d do this as:
(l2 U&#x27;) (r2 U&#x27;)*4 (R2 U&#x27;)

Put your right thumb on D and middle finger on U after the (l2 U&#x27;).

          <div class="email-content">ok, i spent a few hours with that last part and have it pretty much 
down.  heres the only problem i&#x27;m having...  if i rush up to the 
very end and have only 1 on the L face and one on the R to solve 
(red and orange for me), then if the 2 faces are complementary (say 
red/blue and orange/green or something), then i can finish very 
quickly.  If its something like red/blue and orange/white, or 
red/yellow and orange/green, then i get confused because i view the 
yellow/white sides as &quot;wrong&quot;.  So the extra time spent to either 
make sure the red/orange edges that are missing are either green or 
blue, OR to fix it when i get to that point, seems to take much 
longer than simply stuffing them all in the right place and 
finishing with M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2MUMUMU2

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
I also average 2-3 seconds for the cross. During the inspection I 
also try to see my first F2L-pair. But sometimes the cross is very 
difficult for me. In this case I can usually see only how to solve 3 
cross edges.
The most important thing to solve the cross is to know the colour 
scheme of your cube very well.

          <div class="email-content">Awesome link!  Thanks!  Developing a method for the cross is one of those
things I just kept putting off.  I had no idea how to even take advantage of
pre-inspection time.  My current method has been to just get everything into
the D layer as fast as possible and then use R2 and UE or U&#x27;E&#x27; to swap D
edges.  This will easily shave 5 - 10 seconds off my time.

          <div class="email-content">Your webpage (blindsolving instructions) says that people should let you know what they think about your page. So, I&#x27;m going to say that not only did I think it was hilarious/enjoyable/educational, it made me want to learn to blindsolve.<br>
   <br>
  Although I have a horrible short-term memory (been diagnosed by professionals as having this problem, lol), I am going to definetely give it a shot. Chris H.&#x27;s emails earlier this week also helped with this, when he told me that he is confident that ANYONE can learn, with dedication. (Thanks to Chris, and to the other people who were responding to my questions earlier this week about the 5x5x5 blindsolve)<br>
   <br>
  Anyways, great site. I will start working on that sometime in the next few months? (weeks? hours?) Btw, do you think it&#x27;d be good to start with a 2x2x2 ?<br>
   <br>
  Thanks, and good job<br>
   <br>
  David<br>
   <br>
  ps--one other random question, since i don&#x27;t want to send another message just for this: what is your opinion on getting a 5x5x5 before getting a 4x4x4? i&#x27;ve only asked one person so far, and he said it&#x27;s fine, but that other people would disagree with him.. thanks.<br>

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ MY OLD POSTS ABOUT STEP 4(LINK BELOW)

 I ALMOST PREFER HAVING 4 BAD EDGES TO HAVING 0 BAD EDGES.  

M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2 MUMUMU2 is 12 moves.  That&#x27;s just to flip 2 edges.  I can
do all of step 4 in about 13 moves on Avg.

know your cube. look for shorter ways. check out macky&#x27;s site. you

example. scramble:

          <div class="email-content">i did my first blindsolve attempts after reading
stefan&#x27;s page. and yeah it is quite funny sometimes
:-p i&#x27;d say just start with the 3x3x3 right away and
don&#x27;t bother about the smaller cube. just make sure
you have a good method to memorize. if you are going
to use the method stefan explains with the items along
a &quot;mental&quot; route, take your time to come up with good
items that YOU can remember easily!
take your time the first couple times you try. just
memorize for an hour if needed. and don&#x27;t give up if
you fail a couple of times. many people fail their
first attempt to blindsolve a cube (well at least i
did) and you should feel happy if you come quite
close, like 2 edges with wrong orientation or 2 pieces
swapped, because then you know you can do it :-) !!
and you will after some more attempts.

and i&#x27;d get a 4x4x4 before getting a 5x5x5 for the
simple reason that the 5x5x5 cube is a cube with odd
dimension, just like the 3x3x3. the 4x4x4 is a cube
with even dimension and has a couple &quot;extra&#x27;s&quot; because
of that (being the parity errors and not having fixed
centers)

sander

  I was referring to buying a 5x5x5 or 4x4x4... so far I have one person recommending I get the 4x4x4 first (sander) and one person saying it doesn&#x27;t matter. I think I might be leaning towards getting teh revenge first, simply beacuse that way, I can impress people with the 4x4x4, and then impress them again later when i get the professor cube :)

Out of curiosity, is this a question with respect to blindfolding on 
a 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 or just getting a 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 (or maybe both!)? 
That&#x27;s not so crazy as it sounds - I bought my 4x4x4 specifically so 
as to have one to try out my blindfold method. : )

The 4x4x4 is a lot easier to blindfold solve than the 5x5x5. There&#x27;s 
a lot less to remember for a start. Also, if you solve a 5x5x5 
blindfolded then you&#x27;ve essentially also done a 4x4x4 blindfolded 
(because stripping out the middle slices leaves a 4x4x4). Arguably 
it&#x27;s more difficult to do a 4x4x4 by the method of solving a 5x5x5
(as you have to remember all that extra stuff for the 5x5x5).

Solving the 4x4x4 blindfolded takes a little practice but it is not 
too bad (unless you&#x27;re racing when you have 2 problems a) you can 
here the other person clicking away which does nothing for the 
concentration and b) you risk spending less time than you should on 
the memorization which is nearly always a bad idea). It can be done 
consistently.
The 5x5x5 is a harder proposition. For one thing it is a bigger 
investment in time.

I remember the early days of blindfolding the larger cubes. In those 
days, only the 3x3x3 had been solved blindfolded and although people 
would do more than one cube, it didn&#x27;t seem that anyone cared to try 
the larger cubes. The frustration you get from spending all that 
time on the 5x5x5 memorizing/solving only to find out that you&#x27;ve 
got two pieces switched is quite bad. (It&#x27;s even worse if you&#x27;re 
doing more than one cube - mainly because of the extra time.)

On the other hand, if you do solve a 4x4x4 or a 5x5x5 blindfolded 
then you&#x27;ll be one of very few to achieve it, especially the 5x5x5. 
It&#x27;s a pretty cool thing to be able to do.

Essentially, all that is required for blindfold cubing is a good 
memory and good concentration. If you possess both of these then you 
can learn to solve the cube blindfolded. If you can&#x27;t concentrate 
then you may be able to learn it in theory but perhaps not execute 
it in practice. If you can&#x27;t memorize, it&#x27;s probably not going to 
work.

To give you a rough idea of the memory required for smaller cubes: 
to solve the 2x2x2 blindfolded is little more than being able to 
remember a telephone number or two (plus a small number of 
algorithms - 2 would suffice). If you can do that then you probably 
have the memory capabilities. To solve the 3x3x3 blindfolded, you 
probably need the equivalent of also being able to remember a couple 
of credit card numbers (plus a small number of algorithms - while 
less is possible, 5 or 6 is a good number to start with, especially 
if you&#x27;re not concerned with speed).

          <div class="email-content">Good point David... if you get the 5x5x5 now, your non-cubing friends will
think you&#x27;re downgrading when you get the 4x4x4.

I think the 4x4x4 is a more interesting challenge because of the lack of
fixed centers.  To be honest, once you&#x27;ve figured out the 4x4x4, there&#x27;s
almost nothing left to figure out about the 5x5x5.  But I guess that&#x27;s
probably the case with all larger cubes.  It seems like a valid assumption
that since the number of possible states of a cube rises exponentially with
size, the complexity of getting to the correct state also rises, but that&#x27;s
completely untrue.  So with bigger cubes, it&#x27;s really all about impressing
people that don&#x27;t know the difference. :-D

Will be tiles I think. I got several of these during the last year and 
all were with tiles. Don&#x27;t know whether the description said &quot;vinyl 
stickers&quot;, though. But probably did.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve never seen a 12-color stickered Megaminx (except Cubesmith 
stickers).  My Meffert&#x27;s vinyl stickered one has only 6 colors 
(opposite faces the same).  My Meffert&#x27;s tiled one has 12 colors.  
And my original Tomy one has 10 colors (only orange and yellow 
repeat on opposite faces).  I do have a Supernova (same puzzle but 
cut a little deeper on each face) with 12 colors.

As for algorithms, you can use concepts from the 3x3 cube, but not 
all algorithms will translate exactly.  For example, the following 
corner 3-cycle translates nicely:

(R&#x27; U L U&#x27;) (R U L&#x27; U&#x27;)

But something like this edge flipper breaks down:

(M U)4 (M U&#x27;)4

Since there really is no &quot;M&quot; slice, and also because the Megaminx U 
face does not have an order of 4.

In any case, the Megaminx is a must-have.  I prefer any 12-color 
version.

Here is an extensive list:

http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/solutions_a2.html

It might not be what u are looking for since the recognition is not 
described, and no fingertrick notation given.

Maybe u are looking for algs that solely use M and U turns? They are 
really fast i guess and u can ask Gilles or Ron where to find them.

Cheers!

The Speedcubing list is just fine.  Those algs are great.  But, I would use
Cube Explorer to check those and see if there aren&#x27;t better algs from other
rotations you would prefer.  Also, there are a few algs you won&#x27;t be able to
find anywhere, just from optimizing algs from ACube.  The two of those that
I use are:
(r U R&#x27; U&#x27;) M U (R U&#x27; R&#x27;) and its inverse.

I think those are both rotations of 90 degrees from where Speedcubing shows
to perform them, but they work so much better.

Also, don&#x27;t hesitate to go through and understand each alg, because if you
can see what they&#x27;re doing, you can come up with your own.  That&#x27;s how I
found my Z perm, which is 9 moves (10 with a U adjustment at the end 3/4 of
the time).

Good luck, and let us know how it turns out.

-Mike

Ok.  If you know the 32 VHF2L algs, the basic principle is simple, but I&#x27;m
not certain if it would be helpful for standard Roux.  In fact, I&#x27;m pretty
sure it would only make things more difficult.  If you intend to finish with
L5E, it&#x27;s the way to go.

For 1/4 of cases, there are two edges in D incorrect.  For these, we need to
generate special algs.  I&#x27;m working on that, but it&#x27;s slow going.  Mostly,
because I&#x27;m busy with something else.  But it will get done, and hopefully
soon.  Doug Li may help.

For 1/4 of cases, you have no edges in D incorrect, so a VHF2L alg is enough
to get you all correct edges at the cost of a few extra moves.

For 1/2 of cases, you can use a VHF2L alg to achieve the 3 edges on top
situation.  You aren&#x27;t able to change the D edges, but you can influence the
U edges to end with 3 incorrect.  It&#x27;s a bit tricky to see at first, but if
you play around with it, it gets much easier.  You can never wind up with 4
edges incorrect on top this way, so if you have 3 up there already, you know
to do a normal alg.  If you don&#x27;t have 3 already, you just view the edge
that&#x27;s correct as bad.  Cake, really.

Now if only someone could better explain to me non-matching blocks.  I feel
pretty dumb because it&#x27;s giving me so much trouble. ;)

  I have been able to do it before, but the last one frequently takes a long time... I am realy unable to plan it out (although I am starting to get better at actually planning out the first 3, rather than just moving rnadomly aroudn until I recognize a pattern), and I sort of just play with it for a while.

from Mefferts so I can&#x27;t remember all the details, but I think I only

yeah.. my initial cross alg was odd. not having seen the

When you start with F2L intuitively, it&#x27;s completely normal to be
quite slow at the beginning.
When I did that too, I did the same as you : playing with the pieces
so that I luckily find a basic case.
But then with time you&#x27;ll find ways to improve your solution for any
case. Just give it time and you&#x27;ll be fine (I never learned any F2L
alg and yet I can do them around 11 seconds on average.)

Good luck !
Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m starting to play around with Fridrich F2L as well.

How about cube rotations and regrips? Should I stick to the same cube
orientation all the way? I keep rotating and regripping all the time, or at
least I&#x27;m tempted to.

Cheers,

          <div class="email-content">At the beginning I think it&#x27;s pretty normal to be able to do
algorithms from only one angle (usuallu FR slot), but you&#x27;ll manage to
do F2L from more and more angles with time.
Resulting that you won&#x27;t need many cube rotations at the end (cube
rotations are not very good because you lose too much time, but you&#x27;ll
manage do minimise the number of cube rotations you do with time and
training.)

ok thanks! do you have any Idea where I could buy some? I tried
Canadian tires and zellers and Patrik morrin but they only have
jig-a-loo wish is made of petroleum I think ( it damaged my cube >_&lt; )

Yeah, this game has the same weakness as Big Brother, Survivor and
many other reality shows. The most interesting people will get voted
off first. To win you have to fly below the radar and not get noticed.

  You&#x27;re right, Lars. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like this kind of program, where the audience chooses who wins...I think people should win the show by his capabilities and skills, not by being the &quot;public favorite&quot;...
   
  Well, of course, just my opinion...

Woot got riped again!  

HAZARDOUS  iNGREDIENTS:

     n-hexane              Petroleum distillates                 
porpane (propellant)      isobutane (propellant)

from the silicone lube named
 Silicone greaseless lubricant

Upload the .torrent so we can start leeching. Keep seeding fro myoue

<br>
  Did some serious Domino solving today, 200+ solves. This puzzle is so <br>
  much fun... for example, I solve the bottom layer corners one by one <br>
  and in at least one of the solves I got a very cool continuous solve <br>
  of them:<br>
<br>
  http://stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/videos/domino_coolness.wmv<br>
<br>
  Ok, wasn&#x27;t executed perfectly. But here&#x27;s the &quot;combined alg&quot; that <br>
  solved the corners. Try it on a 3x3x3 cube:<br>
<br>
  (R2&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U R2&#x27;) U&#x27; (R2 U R2&#x27; U&#x27; R2) U (L2 U L2&#x27; U&#x27; L2) U (L2&#x27; U&#x27; L2 <br>
  U L2&#x27;)<br>
<br>
  How does that feel?<br>
<br>

Hi Ron,

I do:

1) D edges
2) D corners
3) U corners
4) U edges

How long do you need with your method?

For your step 3, does that mean you look at both sides to determine 
parity? How long does that recognition take you? I still suck at 
recognizing my step 4. It&#x27;s so much easier with colors than with 
numbers... or maybe I&#x27;m just more used to it? Nah, I think recognizing 
colors is more inherently easier cause it&#x27;s more &quot;basic&quot; for the 
brain.

Cheers!
Stefan

there was something with when you have made a torrent with azureus 
it only works with the client azureus.

it worked for me.

Check out my solution here:

Also, Grant&#x27;s solution here:

          <div class="email-content">Do you know anything about commutators ?
If you know how to handle commutators on the 3x3, you should be able
to solve anything on any &quot;cube style&quot; puzzle.

Otherwise you can try to adapt some algorithms from the 3x3 on the Megaminx.
R&#x27; U L U&#x27; R U L&#x27; U&#x27;
This will permute 3 corners. You should be able to put all your
corners at the right position with that.
For the orientation you can try to adapt this thing :
L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R

You have to have a straight line in front of view (a corner alone at
the back), and consider that that corner and the 2 adjacent edges are
actually the UB edge on the 3x3.

Just try it :p
Good luck
Gilles.

I found the best way to solve my cube faster was to hand it to Ron or Jessica or Mirek. It 
took 15-20 seconds off my time.
Perhaps not the most practicable way. :  )

Entertaining, sure, but highly unrealistic.

Neither of them would really need to do two OLL&#x27;s...

          <div class="email-content">how fast do you guys solve F2L? how does that compare to the total time it takes you to solve the cube?<br>
   <br>
  right now i&#x27;m working on intuitive F2L, as indicated by my several posts recently... I am starting to get the hang of it, and it is no longer difficult for me.. HOWEVER, it&#x27;s not fast. With my old method, I solved the first layer and used 2 algs to solve the 4 pieces in the 2nd layer. WIth this method, a good F2L takes about 45 seconds(for me). How much practice do you think it will take me such that I can do F2L in less than 45 seconds? I just timed myself 5 times and I did it in around:<br>
   <br>
  2:25<br>
2:20<br>
1:55<br>
2:12<br>
1:50<br>
   <br>
  Anyways, I can see that I&#x27;m getting much better with practice, but I&#x27;m still anxious to get faster so I figured I&#x27;d ask.. plus, Craig B told me that he got the hang of it in 3-4 days, and it&#x27;s taken me longer than that, and I think i&#x27;ve been doing a relatively heavy amount of cubing in the past few days, so I figured I should get it down sooner ^^<br>
   <br>
  Also - although I understand this method, do you think it makes a big enough difference in time to justify memorizing the 41 algs? This method is pretty good and i know it has a potential for being very fast, but assuming I took it slowly (maybe 1 a day, or 4-5 a week or something), I could easily memorize those algs after a month or two.. would that be noticeably faster? It seems to me that having an alg for each case would be significantly faster.<br>
   <br>
  Let me know. <br>
   <br>

   <br>
  ps--ordered cubesmith tiles, got them on today..very nice -_-<br>

The fastest people do it in 8 or 9 on average, and that&#x27;s around 2/3 of
their total solve time.

 No.  Just get better at doing them intuitively.  If you&#x27;re worried about
progress so much and fixated so heavily on taking the easier route just to
get a little better in 2 months, you&#x27;re not going to try to understand why
the algs work as they do.

Just keep at it, and you will see the times drop.  I cubed incredibly
heavily for about two weeks before my times were down to what they were
before learning F2L.  But without it, I never would have gotten sub-30, much

I use that OLL backwards for the mirror case. With backwards I mean 
the way you set up the case e.g. R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;. That&#x27;s my fastest 
alg and I can do it in like 0.6 seconds. I&#x27;ve also done it 10 times in 
9 seconds.

For PLL my fav. is: L&#x27; R U2 L U L&#x27; U2 R U&#x27; L. It&#x27;s my fastest PLL and 
I can do it in 1.3 seconds.

This method is pretty good and i know it has a potential for being 
very fast, but assuming I took it slowly (maybe 1 a day, or 4-5 a 
week or something), I could easily memorize those algs after a month 
or two.. would that be noticeably faster? It seems to me that having 
an alg for each case would be significantly faster.

Hi David!

I suggest that you go thru a few similar algs each day and try to 
memorize them. BUT, as you go thru them you will understand them, 
which will make it easier for you do learn F2L fast. There is a few 
cases that I still have just memorized but I know almost every case 
intuitive, which helps me to use empty slots. So, my suggestion is 
that you look up algs and try to understand how they work, as you 
use them.

My favourite OLL algs are Sune (R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;) and Anti-Sune (R U2
R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;) because they are very easy and fast. And my favourite
PLL is maybe H-permutation (M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2), because it&#x27;s so fast
and very easy to recognize.

          <div class="email-content">Hey David,

LOL...i think you were a little mistaken when I told you 3-4 days.  It
took me 3-4 days, learning from Chris Hardwick, and running through
solves with him, a lot, and I practiced like mad, and didn&#x27;t time my
solves, but rather went really slow through the solve and counted my
moves, trying to recognize the best pair to do at the time, and doing
this got me used to recognizing the case, and then once I knew I was
averaging under 40 moves (easily) and I knew my recognition was
getting better, I started timing myself and by then my times were
probably around 50-60 seconds for F2L...kinda clunky and slow...Now I
average around 20 seconds with F2L, the thing is with F2L intuitive is
that you end up saving a lot of moves, and chances are the intuitive
F2L you are using doesn&#x27;t use empty slots or anything beyond the basic
F2L...Sure, go ahead and learn the algs blindly (or not) either way
you will end up doing more moves cuz you won&#x27;t save the moves using
the empty slots...I could go on, but I won&#x27;t...

I solved the first layer and used 2 algs to solve the 4 pieces in the
2nd layer. WIth this method, a good F2L takes about 45 seconds(for
me). How much practice do you think it will take me such that I can do
F2L in less than 45 seconds? I just timed myself 5 times and I did it

I&#x27;m still anxious to get faster so I figured I&#x27;d ask.. plus, Craig B
told me that he got the hang of it in 3-4 days, and it&#x27;s taken me
longer than that, and I think i&#x27;ve been doing a relatively heavy
amount of cubing in the past few days, so I figured I should get it
down sooner ^^

On many sites he also supposedly can swallow a Rubik&#x27;s Cube and cough 
it up solved.  

Is anyone else skeptical?

          <div class="email-content">Yes there is a trick cube that one &quot;solves with the tounge&quot;. In Steve&#x27;s 
case I actually think he regurgitates a solved one that he swallowed 
previously. The stuff he does is really amazing.

I practice alcohol-induced regurgitating every weekend but so far I 
haven&#x27;t been able to pull out anything fancy ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

Interesting approach, and probably one of the best for a true Domino.
I do not have a Domino, so I use a 3x3x3. This helps indeed because of the stickers on the side. That makes recognition much easier.

Have fun,

Ron

  Hi Ron,

  I do:

  1) D edges
  2) D corners
  3) U corners
  4) U edges

  How long do you need with your method?

  For your step 3, does that mean you look at both sides to determine 
  parity? How long does that recognition take you? I still suck at 
  recognizing my step 4. It&#x27;s so much easier with colors than with 
  numbers... or maybe I&#x27;m just more used to it? Nah, I think recognizing 
  colors is more inherently easier cause it&#x27;s more &quot;basic&quot; for the 
  brain.

  Cheers!
  Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Almost 15 years ago, I saw Stevie Starr while he performed on a stage 
at a county fair in the SF Bay Area. I sat and watched his act from 
the front row, about 10-15 feet away.

The guy is either really doing it, or is one of the best sleight of 
hand artists around (like at the level of people like Ricky Jay).

I&#x27;m still skeptical, but whatever it is it&#x27;s pretty impressive.

<br>
This isn&#x27;t at all related to speedcubing, but this is the easiest way to<br>
send a message to all my speedcubing friends whom I haven&#x27;t yet emailed.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my news is that Peter and I went to Hawaii last week and got<br>
married! As many of you know, we&#x27;ve been engaged for a very long time<br>
(since before Worlds 2003 when many of you first met Peter!) and just<br>
hadn&#x27;t quite gotten around to actually getting married.<br>
<br>
I always thought a tropical island was a good location for getting<br>
married, so that&#x27;s what we did! Here&#x27;s a selection of photos:<br>
http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine-peter-wedding.html<br>
<br>
Just so this email is at least slightly on topic, I was wondering<br>
whether anyone else is married to someone who hasn&#x27;t yet learnt solve<br>
the cube? I&#x27;ve been to many cubing competitions and most of the wives<br>
I&#x27;ve met (the primary cuber in the couple is always the guy) have learnt<br>
to solve. Often not terribly fast (e.g. usually over a minute), but they<br>
do at least solve it. I need to get Peter to learn beyond the F2L so we<br>
can go for the husband + wife record on speedcubing.com! :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">My wife and I learned to solve the cube with a very basic method together
before I started speedcubing.  She never committed any of it to memory, and
has now lost all interest in it.  The cube has become &quot;the enemy&quot; that
steals my attention. :-)

In fact, all I have at home now is one 3x3x3.  All of my other cubes are now
in my desk at work.

This led me to &quot;card throwing&quot;:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_throwing

Quote: &quot;A person adept at the technique can stun, cut or even knock 
out another with a thrown card at distances of up to 30 feet.&quot;

Whoa!!! Maybe we should try knocking out people with our cubes, too? 
Particularly those who brag about having peeled stickers.

Cheers!

That&#x27;s a great idea!  Now I just need to find a way to stick some lead into
my 5x5...

          <div class="email-content">recently i have actually been working very heavily  on F2L. before now i was going purely on intuition that i had developed  from the petrus method but the downside with that is that its not  always optimal and fast so now i have actually gone back and started  memorizing the algorithms. What i recommend you do is you print up a  page and on pretty much every case look at the sheet and see what it  says for it. after that go through the alg and pay attention to what it  does. try and watch how the pieces pair up in each alg and how each alg  effects all the other pieces. some times you can use an algorithm to  solve a pair and move a piece or to out of the F2L or you can breakup  pieces that are matched incorrectly. experimentation can lead to  understanding but there are a lot of tricks that are alot easier  learned than they are to figure out
  
  John,

   right now i&#x27;m working on intuitive F2L, as indicated by my several  posts recently... I am starting to get the hang of it, and it is no  longer difficult for me.. HOWEVER, it&#x27;s not fast. With my old method, I  solved the first layer and used 2 algs to solve the 4 pieces in the 2nd  layer. WIth this method, a good F2L takes about 45 seconds(for me). How  much practice do you think it will take me such that I can do F2L in  less than 45 seconds? I just timed myself 5 times and I did it in  around:
     
    2:25
  2:20
  1:55
  2:12
  1:50
     
    Anyways, I can see that I&#x27;m getting much better with practice,  but I&#x27;m still anxious to get faster so I figured I&#x27;d ask.. plus, Craig  B told me that he got the hang of it in 3-4 days, and it&#x27;s taken me  longer than that, and I think i&#x27;ve been doing a relatively heavy amount  of cubing in the past few days, so I figured I should get it down  sooner ^^
     
    Also - although I understand this method, do you think it makes  a big enough difference in time to justify memorizing the 41 algs? This  method is pretty good and i know it has a potential for being very  fast, but assuming I took it slowly (maybe 1 a day, or 4-5 a week or  something), I could easily memorize those algs after a month or two..  would that be noticeably faster? It seems to me that having an alg for  each case would be significantly faster.
     
    Let me know.

    ps--ordered cubesmith tiles, got them on today..very nice -_-

          <div class="email-content">Hey,<br>
   <br>
  my bday is coming up in a few weeks, and I have decided I want to get some new puzzles... unfortunately I&#x27;m a bit stumped as to which puzzles to ask for.<br>
   <br>
  As of now, I have only the 3x3x3. Which puzzles do you guys find most satisfying? <br>
   <br>
  -revenge cube<br>
  -professor cube<br>
  -2x2x2 cube<br>
  -megaminx<br>
   <br>
  I think I might choose 2 of the above. At the moment I&#x27;m leaning heavily towards getting a revenge cube, simply because in terms of impressing non-cubists, the 4x4x4 would be useless if they have already seen me solve a 5x5x5 -_- I&#x27;m aware that the 4x4x4 is very difficult. I also think a megaminx looks very interesting.<br>
   <br>
  What do you guys recommend?<br>

5x5 would, yet its more complicating than a 3x3, and a megaminx...well <br>
they are just so much fun...and even if you can&#x27;t solve it right away <br>

photos).

My friend replied saying that blogspot.com sites are blocked from her
work, so she wasn&#x27;t sure to what I was referring. Here&#x27;s part of her
email which is pretty funny:

     &quot;I&#x27;m guessing you did one of two things (or maybe both):

     1. got a sub-20 non-lucky solve on the cube
     2. got married&quot;

It&#x27;s pretty funny that she put the cubing guess *first* on the list!! On
that point, I still haven&#x27;t had a non-lucky sub-20s time. Best is
currently 20.12s.

This led me to &quot;card throwing&quot;:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_throwing

Quote: &quot;A person adept at the technique can stun, cut or even knock 
out another with a thrown card at distances of up to 30 feet.&quot;

Whoa!!! Maybe we should try knocking out people with our cubes, too? 
Particularly those who brag about having peeled stickers.

Cheers!

<br>
Did you try to upload your video on GoogleVideo ? They say they have <br>
no filesize limit (see text below ...)<br>
---&gt; https://upload.video.google.com/<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I think there is no filesize limit for gmail adresses <br>
(mail.google.com). If you&#x27;d like to, I can send two invitations to <br>
you, you create two accounts, send the video from one to the other and <br>
give us the username/passwords. I just checked it, a video can be <br>
downloaded from sent mail as well as inbox folders ...<br>
<br>
Just tell us what you think about that, I&#x27;d really like to see this <br>
vid as well ... and the torrent thing is apparently not the optimal <br>
way :)<br>

You&#x27;ve made a great video. Now who will watch it?<br>

Whether you produce hundreds of titles a year or just a few, you can <br>
give your videos the recognition and visibility they deserve by <br>
promoting them on Google - for free. Signing up for the Google Video <br>
Upload Program will connect your work with users who are most likely <br>
to want to view them. <br>
Sign up and upload... <br>

We&#x27;re accepting digital video files of any length and size. Simply <br>
sign up for an account and upload your videos using our Video Uploader <br>
(please be sure you own the rights to the works you upload), and, <br>
pending our approval process and the launch of this new service, we&#x27;ll <br>
include your video in Google Video, where users will be able to <br>
search, preview, purchase and play it. Find out more here. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Eric,

I like the super3x3, I think it is a very fun cube.  I don&#x27;t know
exactly how my PLL and OLL algs flip centers, but I can usually have
an idea if one will flip a side center or not.  Basically what I do is
to solve the F2L while orienting those 5 centers.  Then I usually do
an OLL and either solve edges and then corners with center-safe algs,
or use a PLL and just flip two centers at the end.

I like this for the edge 3 cycle to also preserve centers:
R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U2 F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2 which I do as

R2 d&#x27; r R&#x27; U2 r&#x27; R U2 r R&#x27; U2 r&#x27; R U&#x27; y&#x27; R2 

I think this strategy needs improving though since I hate ending with
two centers flipped the same direction, the only alg I have to solve
that is very slow, I use:
R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U M E&#x27; M&#x27; E R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U E&#x27; M E M&#x27;

I think ideally, if the 3x3x3 supercube was the main event and what
everyone was doing, that probably we would have algs for OLL that
leave the side centers alone, and algs to solve the PLL correctly in
relation to the last face center.

I think that&#x27;s an ambitious method to learn, but probably what
Fridrich would evolve into if people stopped caring about the regular
3x3 cube and moved to the supercube.

Just my $0.02

out the mechanism:

It&#x27;s like a bandaged 3x3x3 inside.  Most of the Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 
develop the issue where one of the three planes of rotation is much 
rougher to twist than the other two, and harder to align.  But the 
Eastsheen turns flawlessly on all three planes.  They are also a 
nice medium size.

I have discovered a truly remarkable algorithm flipping them inside 
out which this margin is too small to contain.

          <div class="email-content">Haha I myself think the 2 Look is too strenuous for memorization at my
level at least. If you want, try the 3 look LL. Basically there are 2
moves to permute the edges (well there&#x27;s actually a 3rd case but you
can combine the 2 moves to solve that case), another 7 for corner
permutations (these are 7 from the 57 when the cross is solved) and
then the 21 orientations. This in my opinion is the best method to
start. It&#x27;s less memorization, and spend some time to really get it
down. After you have it down, you basically already have half of the 2
look down cold. It&#x27;s a good transition method you could say.

          <div class="email-content">Oh yea I always get those two mixed up. Haha because I always think
that orienting is putting something where it&#x27;s suppose to be and
yeeaa. I actually started out with a very very very bad ll method.
Basically you orient the edges with those 2 moves I talked about
earlier, then you permute them. Next you permute the corners (there
are 2 moves, well 1, the other is just a mirror to rotate 3 corners
clockwise/counterclockwise), and orient each individual corner with
like an 8-turn move (total of like 32 turns for 4 corners >.>) such an
unefficient method, but in total you only had to memorize like a total
of 8 things. 4 really if you don&#x27;t count mirrors.

You could also interpret this as CLL/ELL.  I think that this is a good
option.  Many mirrored and inversed cases.  Less cases than OLL/PLL.

And if you get bored of Cross, Pair, Pair, Pair, Pair, CLL, ELL, you
can easily switch to B1, B2, CLL, 6E4C.    ;)

Another nice benefit of this is that the ELL can be solved using only MU
algs, and are incredibly fast.  And yes, Roux is an easy jump to make after
this.  All the cool kids are doing it.

          <div class="email-content">Hello avid cubers!<br>
<br>
We all know and love the humble Rubik&#x27;s cube, but, there comes a <br>
time in any cuber&#x27;s life when we have to relenquish the comfort of <br>
the 3x3 and &#x27;tackle&#x27; the higher order cubes. Progressing from the <br>
3x3 is no major obstacle, since 4x4&#x27;s are still being produced <br>
(albeit at relatively high costs) today. Likewise the 5x5 is still <br>
on the market (touch wood). But beyond that?? I recently stumbled <br>
(yes, in a link following kinda way) upon this site: <br>
www.olympicube.com, which you no doubt may have done yourself. On <br>
the site is made mention to a new method for constructing large <br>
cubes, by a greek inventor. BUT hold your horses, I&#x27;ve yet to <br>
ascertain whether these are to be solved. The 6x6, of which they/he <br>
has a working prototype looks amazing. This post, therefore, is to <br>
ask you (the wider cubing community) whether you know anything more <br>
about these so called &#x27;olympic cubes&#x27;, and whether they CAN be <br>
purchased. If you have any info that is definitive, might you drop <br>
me a message at jonathonh@.....? or, else, post here, and I&#x27;ll <br>
try to come again ;). As an Australian resident, however, I&#x27;m <br>
thinking that these cubes HAVE been marketed, and I&#x27;m just going to <br>
have to wait for a ripple to come my way,<br>
<br>
Cheers! and good cubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">My second post, and inside 10 minutes... <br>
<br>
I recently got a 5x5 cube, and at the moment, can solve it <br>
everytime, but I feel my method isn&#x27;t &#x27;tight&#x27; and elegant enough. <br>
Basically, and as is pretty inuitive, I complete the centers, build <br>
the edge triplets and solve as a 3x3, which requires minimal thought <br>
(and practically 0 extra algs). The &#x27;center solution&#x27; is naturally <br>
slow, so I&#x27;m going talk exclusively about associating the edge <br>
triplets. I&#x27;d like to hear from anyone who has a relatively <br>
EFFICIENT way of avoiding the &#x27;parity&#x27; error (or, more correctly, <br>
when you must swap TWO small edge cubies, instead of three). To <br>
correct this, I simply perform RrU2 five times, which muddles up a <br>
few edges, but yields a cycle of three. This, I find, is incredibly <br>
inelegant. Are there any ways to COMPLETELY avoid this possibility. <br>
I initially thought looking ahead when I had four edges to go <br>
(to &#x27;combine&#x27;) but this does not seem to have any effect. <br>
<br>
So what do you think??<br>

Well.. Maybe you want to try my website anyway... I frequently get e-

works for you too. I highly recommend this tutorial:

Too bad I don&#x27;t live in LA :p... I would do it for free, you know ;).

Well, good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Everybody.  I am going to do a CLL ELL method.  I think I will
like this method, it will be easier looking at 4 cubies per look rathe
r than 8.

PLL isn&#x27;t all that bad, but the OLL will be strenuous.

I am still discouraged a little bit that my F2L moves are so slow.
Are there any tips, I think that I need to really practice getting an
extended cross, and after each extended cross I look at each position.
 As soon as I recognize it I push out the alg 10 times so that I get
used to it by repetition.

A few months back, not exactly sure when, there was a big dicussion on
this group about the 6x6x6.  You can search back in the archives, but
the original topic was:
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/22864
Between about there and:
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/23006

It has not been released yet, and 2 of the world&#x27;s top big cubers (Per
Kristen Fredlund and Frank Morris) are invited to test it out...who
knows when??? No one yet...but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll all be notified of its
release as we ALL want one...Don&#x27;t worry, Australia isn&#x27;t behind in
the times, and even if you were, just order it off the internet like
every other puzzle can be.

          <div class="email-content">2 posts in 10 minutes is nothing...Try 10 posts in 2 minutes

Anyways, for the 5x5 the method you are doing works...and the best
site I can recommend if you want to continue with this method is:
http://www.bigcubes.com

It is a wonderful site, of course there are other methods out there,
but the one you do is on that site, with all of the algorithms.  The
fix you are referring to, I believe I know what it is, but your
description isn&#x27;t 100% clear...
http://img5.imageshack.us/my.php?image=imgp02206rt.jpg
Is that the one??? If so:
do:
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2
It fixes that, without any other effect on the cube.  Other people
will say other things...choose which ever one you like most.

Glad to know I can help...

twistypuzzles forum.
http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2733
There hasn&#x27;t been a post for quite a while though.
Also, somewhere in that pile of posts is another thread where somebody
 talked about how he got to play with one of the prototypes, but
unfortunately I have to go do other things at the moment.  I think the
thread name is &quot;my experience with the 6x6x6&quot; or something along those

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jon,

There absolutely is a way to avoid the parity error, but you&#x27;re not
going to like it.  The only ways I have found to avoid the edge parity
100% of the time are to 1) count the pseudo-edge cycles during
inspection or 2) count the number of inner face quarter turns in your
scrambling alg (which is cheating btw)

As for counting pseudo-cycles basically during inspection you count
the cycles to pair up a wing edge with it&#x27;s partner wing edge, not how
to pair them up correctly.  This is exactly how you do it for the
4x4x4, and since the the 5x5 contains a 4x4 it works there too.  This
is basically like following the cycles of a 3x3x3 cube, so max you
have to follow 12 cycles, but it&#x27;s very hard to locate the full 12
&quot;pieces&quot; and I have found that the fastest I have ever successfully
counted pseudo-cycles is a little over 20 seconds.  I think with a few
months training that maybe this could be done in under 15 seconds most
of the time, and maybe with mastery in under 15 seconds.  The problem
is, it would require most of the 15 second inspection, and you
wouldn&#x27;t be able to plan any of the first steps of your solve, since
you would have been too busy counting pseudo-cycles.  Also, I doubt
the accuracy of this method in a competition setting where nerves
become a factor and you might miss a piece, or miscount the cycle.

Also, yeah your method is populary known as &quot;centers-first&quot;, and is a
good method.  The alg Craig posted is good to fix parity.  There are a
few other ones for the 5x5, but I don&#x27;t know them very well.  There is
one that starts with your (r&#x27; U2)x4 r&#x27; and then moves edges back
though.  Check bigcubes.com for other cool algs.

If you&#x27;re crazy enough to try counting pseudo-cycles I&#x27;ll explain in
depth how to do it, but from my experience it&#x27;s not worth it.

Happy cubing,
Chris

That&#x27;s a horrible way to do it. Only turn the TOP layer 45 degrees. 
Then bend the edge triplet of top layer upwards while bending the 
adjacent layer downwards. Well, that&#x27;s just my opinion.

Oh, and there&#x27;s no need to disassemble it to get lube inside. Just use 
the flexible thin tube that came w the can to get the silicone inside. 
Some turning of the cube will make the silicone distribute itself 
nicely :-) Spray a little from several angles. Do the turning and then 
repeat a few times the very first time the cube is lubed. Later, much 
less lube is needed each time. After a long time and several lube 
sessions it&#x27;s a good idea to wash it all away before lubing. This will 
indeed require to take the cube apart :-)

Have fun!

Or you can re-order your solution so that the error is &quot;caught&quot; early 
and can be fixed using intuitive sequences.  Just match up the 
edges /before/ you do the centres -- or (perhaps better) just after 
you&#x27;ve done the U and D centres.  But I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s 
feasible in solution meant for speed.

          <div class="email-content">sounds like a lot of work to avoid the flip. i can execute that alg in about 4 or 5  seconds, and its not really all that common of an ending.  i find if i do see it happen or that its going to happen when i get to the last couple of edges, i might try this move which flips 2 middle centers at FL and FR.  E&#x27; F U F&#x27; L F&#x27; L&#x27; F E  (number 4 on http://bigcubes.com/5x5x5/lastedges.html is the mirror of this and will also work, i&#x27;ve found its easier for me to do it on the left side instead of the right)
i think there are other endings that are crappier and take more time than the centerflip one, at least for me.  to avoid this completely check out the cage method (Per knows this method well) for solving its, it fixes the edges before all the centers, like how mike said.  hope this helps.

As I was training earlier today (I improved my PB on the 4x4 at<br>

My best time is 0.28 seconds.<br>

Thanx for seeding :-)

Anyone making torrents only working in Azureus should be shot ;-)
Cause it&#x27;s a really bad idea to have a diskintensive java 
application. Try run another java-application (like an applet) while 
dl-ing and ur computer surely is close to non-responsive for other 
apps. Do Sun at all know what multitasking is? ... hehe ...

Ok, this was sidetracking from speedcubing :D

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for your reply Chris! It is quite an honour! (excuse the <br>
spelling...) <br>
<br>
I understand perfectly what you are talking about, but, somehow, I <br>
just don&#x27;t see counting the edge cycles as being very practical - at <br>
all. So, you&#x27;re right, I DON&#x27;T like it ;). There is frankly, too <br>
much opportunity to MISCOUNT/ miss a cycle etc etc. If this TRULY is <br>
the only way to avoid my problem, then the way I treat it might seem <br>
to be the most effective. Craig and your site reference <br>
(www.bigcubes.com) is comprehensive, but I am reluctant to use <br>
algorithms I have not worked out for myself, especially when I can&#x27;t <br>
REALLY see them speeding up the solve that much. Besides, there are <br>
quite a few of the edge algs to rememeber, and at the moment, (since <br>
I can hardly speed solve the 5x5) I just want a more &#x27;elegant&#x27; <br>
method. <br>
<br>
By the way, may I ask what your average is? Mine is quite poor at <br>
the moment (I&#x27;ve had the 5x5 for around a week now). My main failing <br>
is the center solution, which proceeds thusly: solve opposite <br>
faces !! (at the time this was the easiest to do, except the last <br>
pair is a bit &#x27;wishy-washy&#x27;...) <br>
<br>
Again, thanks for the reply, and happy cubing to you!<br>
PS (have you even considered blindfolded solving for this puzzle) ;)<br>

Well, there&#x27;s this rule:
- You may use multiple cubes to aid in your attempt.

Sounds to me like you can scramble 12 cubes and just solve them in a 
row without scrambling. Having someone else do scrambling is in the 
same spirit I&#x27;d say.

          <div class="email-content">Heh, that would be the simple solution :p I&#x27;ll explain as fully as I
can...

The set comes in a big ziploc bag with all the pieces in it loosely,
screws, washers, the whole shebang...And the screws look longer...and
the washers are flat on one side, curved on the other...i put the flat
side against the spring...The edge pieces just look smoother, and the
corner pieces, like the &quot;corner cap&quot; as I&#x27;ll call it, looks like it
has a bit of an opening to it...its not a full piece...

The center caps - uhh...how to explain...ok...Take a white DIY center
cap, add 2 little nobbies on each side, and on 2 opposite sides, make
1 of them longer, and thats what u have, they don&#x27;t stay in place, but
you can still use paper :) (as i did) or glue (don&#x27;t...u&#x27;ll kill ur
cube...)  Anything else??? I&#x27;m trying to help best i can...

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to stop people. Simply reply with a link 
to the database everytime someone asks.

My Rubik&#x27;s 5x5x5 has enough mass and heft that I always thought it 
could do some serious damage if slammed or hurled into someone&#x27;s 
head.

That could make an interesting episode of &quot;Law and Order&quot; - 
competitive cuber murdered by someone else. I can just hear the 
morbid comment the detective would make at the top of the show:

&quot;Now that&#x27;s a puzzle he&#x27;ll never get to solve.&quot;

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to stop people. Simply reply with a link

          <div class="email-content">I have a question about comparing scrambles like this.  Since many 
CFOP solvers start with a white cross, the orientation of the cube at 
the beginning of the scramble will make a difference.  Is it an 
unspoken assumption that you always scramble with white on top and 
green in front (or just white on top)?

In this case, I did scramble that way and I see the easy Xcross for 
white.  I&#x27;m just curious because nobody ever mentions which color 
cross they were going for in these examples.

I always scrambler with yellow on the top.
In competitions, I think the top color is random and the scrambler
executes the scramble  from any angle. But this needs confirmation.

My aim is to try and do the cube blindfolded with no algorithms and<br>
just commutators and conjugates, but I&#x27;m finding this hard at the<br>

I found a couple of them that&#x27;d be good for blindsolving algs, I could<br>

about fridrich, in which case I shall hush.

          <em>From:</em> GameOfDeath2 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Thu, 02 Feb 2006 23:07:51 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content"><br>
This post is rather technical in nature but if you do understand the technicalities the <br>
details are not difficult. It deals with solving sizeable cubes in a canonical way. To alert <br>
you, this post is about infinite cubes. The scrambling is assumed to be a function from <br>
some ordinal into the slice space (including face turns and inner slices). In particular the <br>
scramble might not be finite (so it&#x27;s not part of the group generated by the slices, in <br>
general). The solution described will also often be infinite even if the scramble is not. The <br>
aim is to solve the cube in type alpha where the cube length is of type 1+alpha+n (+1) <br>
+n+alpha*+1.<br>
<br>
Consider a cube of length type 1+alpha + n (+1 if odd) + n +alpha* +1 (where alpha is <br>
some limit ordinal - I&#x27;m not going to try to consider more complicated than that - and <br>
alpha* is the reverse order type of alpha (so n+alpha* is actually the reverse order type of <br>
n) - so the centres are a square of length type alpha + n (+1 if odd) + n + alpha*.<br>
If alpha is 0, this is just a regular cube, but what if it is not? That&#x27;s the case under <br>
discussion here.<br>
We can fix an initial orientation of the scrambled cube by either (in the case of an even <br>
cube) assuming the UFR corner is solved or (in the case of an odd cube) assuming the very <br>
centre squares are solved placed in whatever way we usually would place them - i.e. U at <br>
U, F at F etc.<br>
<br>
It is clear that each centre can be decomposed into pieces 4 of which are easily type <br>
(2n)*alpha=alpha or (2n+1)*alpha=alpha (depending on n being odd or even), 4 of which <br>
are easily typed alpha^2 (going in from the corners) and then canonically reordered in type <br>
alpha and (in the odd case) 4 of type alpha and either (2n)^2 (even case) or (2n+1)^2 (odd <br>
case). <br>
Moreover the edges can be typed either as 2*alpha or 1+2*alpha (i.e. alpha).<br>
Since m+alpha=alpha for all finite m, we can put the centres (2n)^2 or (2n+1)^2 first <br>
without increasing the type and then it is easy to arrange the 8 (or 12) alphas to get <br>
12*alpha=alpha, so that we can type each centre in type alpha and hence the whole in <br>
type 6*alpha=alpha.<br>
Moreover the edges can be typed in 24*alpha or 12=24*alpha=alpha and the corners in <br>
type 8, giving a total typing of 8+2*alpha=alpha. So we can type the entire cube in type <br>
alpha. We can also do it in such a way that the corners all come first and this for each <br>
centre position all the edges that can be reached by producing from its orbit (either 12 or <br>
24 of them) come before that centre position.<br>
We can assume that centre postions (in a particular coordinate) are all consecutive and <br>
ordered according to a particular face dictionary (e.g. U,D,F,B,R,L). e.g. the position in the <br>
U face diagonally next to the UBL piece comes directly before the corresponding position <br>
in the D face (adjacent DFL) which is directly before the one in the F face (adjacent FLU) <br>
etc. - using a net diagram of the cube surface.<br>
Memorize the cube position in type alpha. (You could go for type card(alpha) but the <br>
mapping might not be as easy and some of the canonical aspects may not be preserved.)<br>
Now we proceed to solve the cube by transfinite induction. We are solving ordering on the <br>
positions not the pieces (so the fact that we have lots of pieces that could conceivably go <br>
in the same place is irrelevant).<br>
We start by making sure that the corners are evenly permuted (by using D if necessary). <br>
We can then solve the corners with 3 cycles and orientation moves. If the cube is odd we <br>
can then also do the 12 central most edges in 3 cycles and orientation moves. So assume <br>
all that is done. It takes finite type.<br>
Given a position, we assume all lower positions have been solved. There are two cases:<br>
<br>
1. the current position is solved - and we are done with the stage.<br>
2. the current position is not solved.<br>
If the current position is not solved then there must be another element in its orbit (by <br>
which I mean the orbit of the pieces that can go into this position) which is also not solved <br>
(a later position).<br>
If there are two such other positions then we can certainly apply one of the standard <br>
algorithms for a finite cube (e.g. a 5x5x5) to cycle the 3 pieces in the earliest such <br>
positions, solving the earliest of those positions without changing any of the rest of the <br>
cube and we are done with the stage.<br>
So next we must consider the possibility that there are only two unsolved positions in the <br>
cycle.<br>
If the position is an edge then all the centre positions in the slice containing that edge are <br>
later positions.<br>
Slicing the edge quarter of a turn will disturb either 2 or 3 of the already solved positions <br>
but will reduce things to an even permutation for that orbit so that we can go back to the <br>
earlier elements of the orbit and solve again (this time the whole bunch) in a couple of 3 <br>
cycles. We can choose to slice the edge so that the current position goes into the earlier <br>
position, for definiteness.<br>
So now the problem comes - what if the current position is a centre position.<br>
Since the corners are solved and so are all the edges produced from its orbit.this case <br>
cannot in fact arise. The evenness of the other two implying the eveness of the <br>
permutation of this orbit, so we can&#x27;t possibly arrive in this situation.<br>
Therefore we can always solve the position without disturbing the lower positions (except <br>
for edge slicing and here there is only once choice of slice) and either no higher positions <br>
or a canonical choice of higher positions, using canonical permutations (either 2 earliest <br>
unsolved pieces in a 3-cycle or all the D centre on the first move (in case the corner <br>
permutation is odd) but that is a canonical permutation or of 2-3 higher edges and a <br>
bunch of centres in a slice but again the slice direction has been chosen in a canonical way <br>
and since in the original ordering the centre pieces are arranged in blocks of 6 (each <br>
corresponding to the same position but in each face according to a face dictionary - e.g. <br>
U,D,F,B,R,L) the slice even reorders the centre pieces in a canonical way.<br>
Note each step (plus, if necessary the fixing of the finite number of displaced earlier <br>
positions - in edge slicing - though not in such step the fixing of the later centre <br>
positions) takes only finitely many moves.<br>
Therefore this system will solve the cube in type alpha and because all the distortions <br>
along the way are all canonical, it could even be in principle be used as a useful method <br>
for blindfold cubing.<br>

4d)	Cubes are generally scrambled with the white (or the lightest 
colour) face on top and green (or blue or the darkest face) on the 
front.

Good &quot;astrophysics&quot; v &quot;regular physics&quot; joke by Jay!

I liked the part where Tyson was called Leyan&#x27;s &quot;trainer&quot;. That&#x27;s a 
whole joke video right there:

- Tyson chasing Leyan in a car while Leyan cubes and runs.
- Tyson smacking Leyan with slabs of beef while Leyan is cubing

- Tyson making Leyan drink some sort of nasty blended-up mixture.
- Leyan typing as fast as he can, with Tyson berating him when he

All to the tune of &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot;!

Random question: how much of the Tonight Show segment was &quot;pre-

will make this joke, we&#x27;ll give you the cube and you solve it, then 
we&#x27;ll bring out the lingerie models wearing bras like this and you&#x27;ll 
unhook them, so practice now&quot;. 

Or was there just an outline of events and everything else (jokes, 
interaction) was done &quot;live&quot;?

I understand the Letterman show is very &quot;pre-rehearsed&quot; IE, guests are 
told things like &quot;here&#x27;s questions Dave will ask you, here&#x27;s answers 
you should give, here&#x27;s jokes Dave will make, etc.&quot;

curious,

That&#x27;s a poor method, it can&#x27;t even solve this scramble: U

If the original meaning is using only commutators and conjugates of commutators (etc.) 
then that&#x27;s the same as just using commutators (because conjugates of commutators are 
commutators *) so you just get the commutator subgroup (which happens to be half of the 
group) and it can&#x27;t solve U, as you said.

If it just means using commutators and conjugates (of arbitrary algortihms) then it can be 
solved using just conjugates: (any algorithm is itself conjugated by the identity element) 
but of course that&#x27;s rather trivial.

(* Of course, whether the representation used in the solving looks like a product of 
commutators is another matter.)

Maybe this then: solve only using commutators and (at most once), U.

<br>
I was just watching a movie and saw a cube. After some searching, I <br>
don&#x27;t believe that this has ever been pointed out before. Something <br>
like 30 minutes into the movie &quot;Hitch&quot; is a cube lying on the office <br>
desk of the character played by EvaM. Wonder if this has anything to <br>
do with WillS being part of the cast.<br>
<br>
This is rather brief, and I was supprised (caught it a moment ago) <br>
because I had seen this movie many times before and never saw it <br>
before. Anyone else notice this sighting?<br>
<br>
Hem..., looking forward to watching &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot; when <br>
it comes out (in 10-14 months), which features a cube for more than <br>
a second.<br>
<br>
Totally unrelated, but oddly enough I was sad to see Chris/Tristin <br>
leave on BatG2 tonight. That show is so awesome. Contact me for <br>
episodes, cuz I know lots of ppl are anti-bittorrent for whatever <br>
reason and I have a fast connection. Hem... Tyson/Thais going (last <br>

The explanation they provide is that Ux is a certain number of U turns 
(whether it be U, U&#x27;, or U2) and Ux&#x27; is the inverse of that.  Read the 
paragraph right after and that should clean it up.

It&#x27;s not a rotation as one would guess (after all, x and y generally 
mean rotation)

I just recently graduated from Carolina and have been living in Chapel
Hill, but am not anymore.  However, I&#x27;m only in Raleigh now which is
about a 30 minute drive so not too bad.  Are you in Chapel Hill or
nearby?  Send me a message, maybe we can get together and do some cubing.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a new LL strategy for centers first people to propose and<br>
analyze in this post.  I am trying to come up with new ways to handle<br>
the parities on a 4x4, and am requesting we put our brains to this task.<br>
<br>
Here is the idea, to only have the double parity (meaning do an alg to<br>
fix the orientation parity, then do an alg later in the solve to fix<br>
the permutation parity) 1/8 the time instead of 1/4.  To do this break<br>
the orientation parity cases into 2 groups.<br>
<br>
1 oriented LL edge:<br>
Do either the parity alg or double parity alg leaving a 50-50 chance<br>
to also have PLL parity so to encounter double parity here is a 1/8<br>
chance overall.<br>
<br>
3 oriented LL edges:<br>
Do a COLL alg, now recognizing whether the 3x3 edge groups have the<br>
same parity as the corners is very easy.  So if you have double parity<br>
do the double parity fix pure version, if not do the regular parity<br>
fix pure version.<br>
<br>
So that means only 1/8 the time you do 2 algs.  Now don&#x27;t get excited<br>
yet, this method stinks.<br>
<br>
Here are the times for each LL strategy (for me).  I did an average of<br>
each alg.<br>
<br>
permutation parity fix: <br>
02.34, 02.24, 02.63, (03.28), 02.44, 02.73, 02.68, 02.23, 02.43,<br>
02.90, 02.79, (02.11) = 2.54 average<br>
<br>
orientation parity (speedsolve version - double parity alg):<br>
04.94, 04.47, 05.34, 04.91, 04.65, 05.03, 04.42, 04.45, (04.18),<br>
(05.52), 04.97, 05.29 = 4.85 average<br>
<br>
double parity alg pure version:<br>
06.23, 07.56, (06.02), 08.10, 06.50, (08.24), 08.02, 06.71, 07.64,<br>
07.33, 06.42, 06.24 = 7.07 average<br>
<br>
orientation-parity-only alg pure version<br>
06.06, (05.98), 06.79, 06.75, 06.77, 06.38, (08.66), 06.51, 06.41,<br>
06.66, 07.40, 07.60 = 6.73 average<br>
<br>
So here is the analysis of the extra time spent on average just fixing<br>
parities:<br>
<br>
Conventional method with 1/4 double parity:<br>
<br>
0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.25*4.85 + 0.25*(2.54+4.85) = 3.70 seconds on<br>
average to fix parities.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
and with the new 1/8 double parity method<br>
<br>
0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) + 0.125*(7.07) +<br>
0.125*(6.73) = 3.89 seconds on average spent fixing parities.<br>
<br>
Also solving with the new way I have to do COLL vs. OLL 1/8 the time<br>
which is probably 1 second longer.  So 1/8 second overall.  Making the<br>
3.89 actually 4.02 seconds.<br>
<br>
In order to make this faster than the conventional approach I would<br>
need to solve the pure version double parity alg (x) and the pure<br>
version orientation-parity-only alg (y) in:<br>
<br>
3.70 = 0.25*0 + 0.25*2.54 + 0.125*(4.85+2.54) + 0.125*(4.85) +<br>
0.125*(x) + 0.125*(y) + 0.125<br>
<br>
2.94 = 0.125*(12.24 + x + y)<br>
<br>
11.28 seconds = x + y<br>
<br>
Which means the sum of both pure alg versions has to be 11.28 seconds<br>
or less.<br>
<br>
We can assume that x can be no faster than 4.85 and y can be no faster<br>
than 5.55 which is my average for the speed solve<br>
orientation-parity-only alg (again this analysis is done with my<br>
times, since those are the only available to me right now).<br>
<br>
05.82, 05.38, 05.11, 05.82, 05.54, 05.58, (04.75), (06.07), 05.57,<br>
05.52, 05.74, 05.39 = 5.55 seconds<br>
<br>
So that means there is only a give room of about 0.8 or 0.4 seconds<br>
per alg.  Meaning that my pure version double parity alg can only be<br>
0.4 slower than my speed solve version and same for the<br>
orientation-only-parity algs.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible for me. <br>
So in conclusion again, this method stinks.<br>
<br>
But can we somehow reduce the 1/4 chance to do both parities and, for<br>
me, take 7.39 doing nothing but fixing parities.  I mean come on that<br>
amount of time is ridiculous.  Added on to a solve that would<br>
otherwise have been 55 seconds means that 11.91% of the solve is<br>
fixing parities.  Fixing parities.  That&#x27;s ridiculous, we shouldn&#x27;t<br>
have the standard accept that as ok.<br>
<br>
Can we take anything from this and form a different, better strategy?<br>
 Any ideas?  My only idea so far is to use the COLL case when you have<br>
orientation parity to guess the corner permutation and then compare it<br>
to the edge permutation.  I think that is fairly thought intensive<br>
though, so the amount of decision time required could actually make<br>
that strategy take more time fixing parities on average.  Alright,<br>
well I&#x27;m trying to think of something new, anyone else have ideas?<br>
<br>
Also, should the centers first method be scrapped entirely in favor of<br>
a cage method?  That would allow me flexibility to fix the orientation<br>
parity (the only one!) and also commutators are very easy to come up<br>
with on the fly once you have practice and experience with them.  So<br>
with mastery it seems to me that maybe a cage method is a better<br>
choice in the long run than a centers first method.<br>
<br>
Fixing parity sucks, but the fact that the edge permutation is<br>
completely independent of the rest of the cube (!) is what makes the<br>
4x4 so cool in my opinion :-D<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  If you actually made it to the end of this post congratulations.<br>
 I know it&#x27;s long, but I want to come up with a better way to handle<br>
the 4x4 parities.  Even if it only saves 0.5 second on average, that&#x27;s<br>
still time saved.  Thanks for your time spent reading.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Interesting post, I can see this is consuming your very being at the <br>
moment. (and I fully understand). Firstly, I&#x27;d like to agree with your <br>
comment at the bottom, about the edge permutation (and it being <br>
independent of this rest of the cube) - the 4x4 rocks!<br>
<br>
Anyway, you made mention of a &#x27;cage&#x27; method, which I haven&#x27;t heard of <br>
before. Could this be where you do the centers last? My original <br>
method was just this, but I found it was a bit touch-and-go, however, <br>
doing it this way, I could correct the parity errors (at least the <br>
orientation one, not sure on the other one, my 4x4 is kaputt) before <br>
they occured (and no, this was not elegant). At the time I thought <br>
this method (even if it was &#x27;beginners&#x27;) was awful. A shame to leave <br>
the privacy of my room, so to speak. As the cubes get larger, the <br>
centers first method becomes increasingly applicable (and efficient), <br>
but for the 4x4 is there promise with this cage method I wonder? If <br>
so, I might have to have another look!<br>
<br>
Cheers, happy cubing!<br>

Definitely.  Because you are directly solving more pieces, there is greater
potential for speed.  The resolving to a 3x3 portion of centers first
approaches is very abstract compared to directly solving each piece or group
of pieces.

However, I think a hybrid of the two will be the best in the end.  Maybe I&#x27;m
biased ;), but I see more promise in beginning with two 1x3x4 blocks, then U
corners, then finishing edges/taking care of parities, then solving 4 M
centers.  The speedsolve OLL parity alg for this is 13 moves long, all l/l&#x27;
r and U2.  Finishing the edges is largely in the air, but it can be done any
number of ways.  The way that I found that I use is to pair them up, then
orient, but I think perhaps directly placing 2 at a time may have good
results, as well, as may finishing one slice, then the other.  Either way,
if more people were to use this sort of approach as opposed to centers
first, I&#x27;m sure much progress could be made.

I start with the cube in my hands and as my hands lift off from the 
stackmat I do the turn and stop the timer. I know it can be hard to 
tell if you start turning to early and stop to early, so I did I few 
tries being really careful, and got a 0.18 that I&#x27;m 100% sure is 
correct. I can only do this fast U2 turn with my right index finger. 
With my left index finger I have to do (U U).

HEHE...I couldn&#x27;t apply this but maybe:

Have an alg for the OLL parity, and have an alg for the OLL parity
when it is 3 edges...and then do a COLL case to solve the corners, and
leave the edges to be permuted...The way I do my LL is 4LLL, so I&#x27;ve
never gotten one of the corner PLL parities...i&#x27;m kinda happy about
that...not sure which is faster...cuz if you do: 1 alg for edges
(1,2,3,4) then COLL, then PLL edges (then fix PLL parity if needed) I
think that would be quite fast...

          <div class="email-content">I mean you will need a fast video card (and CPU), due to the high 
bitrate.  A lot pixels are getting thrown on the screen, and it 
sounds like your hardware can&#x27;t keep up.  You could try playing it 
back at 50% size and see if that helps.  I can play it on a 1Ghz 
Pentium M laptop no problem.

The video is so well produced, I actually want a DVD video of it.  
Andy, any chance you could offer to mail it out to folks for $10 
each or something?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve never actually seen anyone playing with one on NUMB3RS, but it could
easily happen.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they used the cube to describe
group theory or something in a future episode.  The 5x5x5 I saw last time
was sitting on a shelf very poorly scrambled and with several sides twisted
45 degrees.  Which makes it look kind of cool but obviously not the way any
cuber would set it down.

Off-topic, but does anyone find it difficult to leave a cube sitting around
scrambled?  I have two 3x3&#x27;s, a 4x4 and a 5x5 on my desk at work, and I
can&#x27;t focus on work if any of them are scrambled.

I think I have my location marked to within a few feet of my house. :)

I forgot to mention that http://www.cubestation.co.uk has a
&quot;Speedcuber Profiles&quot; section that has more listings than either of
these two sites, and it includes location.  Unfortunately, there isn&#x27;t
an index by location.

          <div class="email-content">Craig, thanks for the detailed description.

So the corner caps have been shrunk, further reducing the amount of 
plastic and making the cube potentially even lighter.  Does that 
seem to affect the turning at all?  I can imagine silicone lubricant 
seeping to the interior of the corner pieces now.  But on the other 
hand, there is less surface area in contact so less friction.

Formerly the corner caps (as you call them) had a small tab 
connecting to the &quot;foot&quot; of the corner.  On some cubies this tab is 
so thick that it causes the cube to catch, and must be sanded or 
worn down.  Can you tell if the new corners have this problem?

YES! It&#x27;s terrible. My cubes also scramble themselves all the time 
when I&#x27;m not looking, so I constantly play with them even when I 
really want to do some work. It&#x27;s similar to my drink bottles, somehow 
their content reduces when I&#x27;m not looking, and I don&#x27;t have an 
explanation yet. Of course both for the scrambling issue and the 
drinking issue my friends claim that it&#x27;s unconsciously caused by 
*me*...

It&#x27;s around 23 mins in the 18th or 19th episode of the first season. For
those who know the show well it&#x27;s the one with the &quot;Putrid Soup&quot;.
In the sketch a guy finds a girl and she is so intelligent that she can even
solve the cube. The actress obviously doesn&#x27;t know what she is doing.

Oh.

I&#x27;m thinking that i can just do a U from that position to create even
parity. Then surly that can be solved? What am i misunderstanding?

Commutators involve an even number of quarter turns. If you mean conjugates only of 
commutators then you can only solve cubes requiring an even number of quarter turns to 
solve. Thus you can&#x27;t solve that scramble.
i.e. U cannot be solved using only commutators (and conjugates of commutators).

Stefan&#x27;s post is to point out that restricting yourself in this way doesn&#x27;t allow for that 
position to be solved.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,
to fix the parity I use a method I&#x27;m sure you know but I&#x27;d like to
remember it to you because in any cases you only have to do one parity
alg.

When I&#x27;ve solved the F2L I look if there is a Oll parity or not.
1°) If not you do the OLL and then PLL (with sometimes the PLL parity)

2°) If there is a OLL parity problem, you do an OLL so that only one
edge remains flipped(you can choose the OLL between several of them,
and choose the shortest one). Then you can easily see if there is also
a PLL parity or not, and you do the OLL parity alg or the both parity
alg depending on the situation.

So you have zero or one alg to do. I use this method (like Yuki) since
a long time and it wokrs pretty well. You&#x27;ve almost no break after
little practice. And it seems easier than learning COLL or something else.

What do you think of that?

Olivier

Correct. I&#x27;m just a good nitpicker, that&#x27;s all. And I try to point out 
things indirectly. Actually I wish I had just written &quot;I tried that 
method but strangely couldn&#x27;t get a success rate over 50%&quot;...

          <div class="email-content">on the 3x3 : you only have OLL and PLL.
on the 4x4, you can have 4 cases :
1. OLL + PLL
2. OLL fix + OLL + PLL
3. OLL + PLL fix + PLL
4. OLL fix + OLL + PLL fix + PLL

case 1: no extra alg
case 2 and 3 : one extra alg
case 4 : one extra alg (if it fixes both at the same time, otherwise
you&#x27;ll have to apply an alg for each problem)

This is how you can have 0 or 1 extra alg on the 4x4 LL.

The only problem is that the &#x27;pure version&#x27; algs are much slower 
than the &#x27;speedsolve version&#x27; algs (at least for me).

What I do is this:
If three edges are corrected oriented after F2L, I will flip the 
last edge with a &#x27;speedsolve version&#x27; alg. And then use I COLL 
(except for the S and As orientation), so that I will often have a 
one-look LL after this. If I have a two-look LL, then I have bad 
luck. Of course I also use COLL if four edges are corrected oriented 
after F2L.

A very technical post is rare and nice.
If there&#x27;s a way to make it accessible to people with finite

<br>
I&#x27;m sure most of you remember metronome solving.  Well I recently<br>

<br>
Basically you go to http://www.metronomeonline.com/ and set it to a<br>
tempo.  Then you solve F2L (F2B, 2x2x2, etc..) doing one move on each<br>
click.  You can&#x27;t go faster or slower, and you cannot pause and miss a<br>
beat.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve found that I can do 184 smoothly with no delays maybe 1/10 and I<br>
miss one or two beats between the cross and the first pair, but do the<br>
rest cleanly, maybe half the time.<br>
<br>
Anyway the reason I posted this is that I realized that I rush<br>
waaaaaaay too much during the F2L, which causes lockups and such. <br>
Anyway I just set a 15 second average (not common for me, but also not<br>
that uncommon) of 15.89 seconds.  I tried using my pace from doing F2L<br>
at 184 rather than my usual pace, and had some very nice flowing F2Ls<br>
during the average.<br>
<br>
Try giving it a shot (for the first time, or again).  I think it<br>
helped me to find a better pace for my F2L.  I thought I had F2L<br>
fairly well figured out, but I guess a little more work is always a<br>
good thing ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s a metronome average.  I had it set to 184 and did just F2L on
each solve.

Basically since the F2L averages about 30 moves I am shooting for a 10
second average.  So times around 10 seconds were the ones where I
didn&#x27;t miss a beat, and times above are ones where I missed beats, or
had to do stupid moves like U U&#x27; in order to keep a tempo.

10.97, 15.54, 14.43, 16.07, (18.49), 13.41, 13.99, 10.44, 14.21,
12.74, 10.72, (09.73) = 13.25

The 10.97, 10.44 9.73 were solves where I didn&#x27;t miss a beat at all,
and the 10.72 I did miss a beat after doing Xcross in looking for the
2nd pair, but the shorter move count because of the Xcross made it
still a good solve.

Try it out, it&#x27;s fun to get a solve with no missed beats.

give yourself time to look.  If you&#x27;ve already spotted a pair go for a

So doing in one beat is preferred, but if you need the time to spot a
pair do it in 2.

Uh... is that 15.89 for F2L or for the whole cube?

The 15.89 was for the whole cube.  My LL is very consistent in the <br>
6.25-6.50 range though, so I would say that my F2L averaged about 9.5-<br>
9.6 for that average.  That&#x27;s why I posted, I think the metronome <br>
solving helped me find a better, smoother pacing during my F2L for <br>
that average.  I definitely rushed less and kept things more <br>
consistent it felt like.<br>

server irc.irchat.tv.

There are a couple other places to access the chatroom as well, but you can
also access it with an IRC client if you have one installed.

          <div class="email-content">Maybe I was not very clear, thanks Gilles for your explanation. This
time I will try to be very clear.

My method to solve the 3x3x3 phase on the 4x4x4 is:
 
1) Cross and F2L,
2) OLL,
3) Parity,
4) PLL.
 
I use three algs on step 3:
OLL parity fixer pure [ r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 (r) U2 r U2 l&#x27; (r&#x27;)
B2 r2 ],
PLL parity fixer pure [ r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 ],
Double parity fixer pure [ r2 B2 r&#x27; U2 r&#x27; U2 B2 r&#x27; B2 r B2 r&#x27; B2 r2 B2 ].

          <div class="email-content">In the same idea :

1) Cross and 3 pairs
2) Before inserting last pair (ex : FR) , watch for oll parity
    2a) no parity : insert last pair
    2b) parity : insert last pair with the wrong corner (UFR, not DFR)
and with the FR edge flipped.

3) OLL

4) PLL (think about PLL parity if necessary, by inversing mentaly 2
opposites edges, and inversing colors of the last corner if you come
from 2b )

5) double or simple parity speed algs 

No more algs to learn, just working on recognisation cases.

Frédérick.

          <div class="email-content">Let me first tell something about myself: my best average of 10 is <br>
slightly under 25 secs, my best single solve without luck is 17.84 and <br>
my best lucky solve is around 15 secs. Anyway, today I had this awesome <br>
scramble generated by JNetCube: U&#x27; D B2 D&#x27; B2 D&#x27; F2 D2 B2 F&#x27; L&#x27; R U&#x27; F&#x27; <br>
R&#x27; U R&#x27; L U B&#x27; R2 B F L2 F2, and I managed to solve it in 11.41 secs! <br>
The reconstructed solve is: double x-cross: L U2 R2 U L2, 3rd pair: U2 <br>
y&#x27; R U R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;, 4th pair: L&#x27; U&#x27; L, OLL: F R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;, <br>
PLL: y2 R2 U&#x27;R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R U R U&#x27; R. I think this isn&#x27;t technically a <br>

   <br>
  I&#x27;m currently learning the cube, but am a tad miffed by what the standard defintion of 3 LLL is. I think I do a 3 LLL, which involves making a cross on the LL, then OLL, and then PLL. but after hearing some of you guys I&#x27;m not sure that this is the best way!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Too true Craig, I&#x27;ve just (well around 40mins ago) worked it out, 
and everything&#x27;s sweet ... I just got a wee bit confused there for a 
moment. 5:15-5:30!!! that&#x27;s amazing. Have you lubed your cube (I&#x27;ve 
yet to do this to any of my cubes)? If so, what type of silicone 
spray is best? What is the breakdown for your times for each step 
(assuming you do the centers first...)?

which is 2 moves (there&#x27;s a 3rd when no edges are flipped but you can
do that by combining the 2 moves). Then there are 7 OLL and the
standard 21 PLL. I like it because it&#x27;s a balance between memorization
and efficiency.

The interviewer&#x27;s accent didn&#x27;t sound terribly New Zealand though. He
sounded Australian. I&#x27;m guessing nobody else really noticed this though?
Usually only Australians and New Zealanders can hear the difference, and
we both think our accents are *completely* different! :)

I&#x27;m not sure if I can do that completely but maybe I can describe some of the ideas and 
flesh things out a bit more.

An order on a set S is a relation R such that for any distinct s,t,u in R

not(sRs) (irreflexive condition)
if sRt and tRu then sRu (transitive condition).
(e.g. &lt;)

(This is a strict order; for a weak order the conditions are sRs (reflexive, if sRt and tRs then 
s=t (symmetric) and if SRt and tRu then sRu (transitive). e.g. &lt;=, but we only consider 
strict orders here.)

For instance, in the game of rock, paper, scissors. We can define a relation B (beats) such 
that paperBrock, rockBscissors, scissorsBpaper.
This is not an order. It is irreflexive (we don&#x27;t have things like paper Bpaper) but not 
transitive - whilst paperB rok and rockBscissors, we don&#x27;t have paperBscissors.

The order is total (or linear) if for any s,t either sRt or s=t or tRs. (i.e. you can compare any 
two elements). The usual order on the integers is a total order.

The order is a well-order if it is a total order and any non-empty subset T of S has a least 
element - that is an element m of T such that for each t in T either mRt or m=t. (This 
element is then unique by the conditions above.)

An ordinal is a particular type of well-ordered set (well-ordered by membership) and any 
well-ordered set is (order-)isomorphic to an ordinal.

For instance, any subset of the natural numbers is well-ordered and so is the entire set of 
natural numbers but the set of integers is not well-ordered (it has no least element).
The empty set is an ordinal (with the empty relation being the order) and is commonly 
called 0.
If an ordinal has a maximum element it is a successor ordinal - otherwise it is a limit 
ordinal. Any ordinal looks like alpha+n where alpha is a limit ordinal and n is a finite 
ordinal.
The set of natural numbers is a limit ordinal (the first limit ordinal except 0).

w={0,1,2,3,...}
but there are other subsequent ordinals e.g.
w+1={0,1,2,3,...,w}
and w+w={0,1,2,3,...,w,w+1,w+2,...}=w*2 etc.
And there are still larger ones like w_1 which is far bigger.

Ordinals have curious properties. w+1 is distinct from w (it has a last element) but 1+w is 
actually the same ordinal. Putting 1 element in front of a list of type w, doesn&#x27;t change the 
type (they are order-isomorphic) - e.g. {-1,0,1,2,...} is clearly the same type as {0,1,2,...} 
(just map k to k+1).
Similarly w*2 is bigger than w but 2*w is the same as w.
In {a_{0,0},a_{0,1},a_{1,0},a_{1,1},...} (which is w copies of 2 ({a_{i,0},a_{i,1}})) can be 
mapped to w by taking a_{i,0} to 2i and a_{i,1} to 2i+1 and this is an order-isomorphism.

It is this property that effectively allows us to take an order-type for 1 face-centre and put 
all 6 faces into the same type (as long as such type is a limit and this can always be 
arranged by putting some finite stuff at the start).
You basically use {a_{0,0},a_{0,1},...,a_{0,5},a_{1,0},...} to transfer one to the other (and this 
puts each centre coordinate into blocks of 6 (so you have the same coordinate for each 
centre in turn). Similarly n*alpha=alpha for any finite n>0 (n=1,2,3,...).

Anyway, for any ordinal alpha at least as big as w, the reverse order alpha* is not a well-
order (because you get a subset {...,3,2,1,0} with no least element).
So it will turn out that your centres have strips of type 
alpha+n (+1)+(alpha+n)* for some limit alpha (because I effectively made an assumption 
right at the start that I wasn&#x27;t going to consider anything more complicated.
The +1 would be the case of an odd cube.
(Essentially, the logic here is that because you can rotate the face by a half turn the end of 
strip must be the reverse order of the start. I&#x27;m only looking at getting half way via an 
ordinal so I must have alpha+n(+1)+(alpha+n)*=alpha+n(+1)+n+alpha* (since 
(beta+gamma)*=gamma*+beta* and n*=n).
Including the edges the whole face has strips of type 1+alpha+n(+1)+n+alpha*+1.
Similrly the same type must run both vertically and horizontally because you can do 
quarter turns too.

Thus I can break a centre into pieces:

alpha*alpha n*alpha (1*alpha) n*alpha (alpha*)*alpha

alpha*n n*n (1*n) n*n (alpha*)*n

(alpha*1) (n*1) (1*1) (n*1) (alpha*)*1

alpha*n n*n (1*n) n*n (alpha*)*n

alpha*(alpha*) n*(alpha*) (1*(alpha*)) n*(alpha*) (alpha*)*(alpha*)

And going across all 6 centres we can put these into types like

6*(alpha*alpha) 6*(n*alpha) (6*(1*alpha)) 6*(n*alpha) 6*((alpha*)*alpha)

etc.

As indicated earlier n*alpha=alpha so 6*(n*alpha)=6*alpha=alpha.
Clearly, we can run reverse type on the alpha* to type 6*((alpha*)*alpha) in type 
6*((alpha)*alpha). (This is effectively coming in from the corner.)
Less obviously, we can type alpha*alpha in type alpha and we can even do it in a canonical 
(methodical etc.) way, independent of alpha.
So effectively then 6*((alpha)*alpha) can be typed in type 6*alpha=alpha.
So we get a finite load of chunks that can be typed in type alpha or in a finite type (like 
n*n). Put the finite bunch first to get N+k alpha=alpha.
(We can also do this methodically - putting them in in a particular order - after all, we only 
have finitely many chunks.)
So we get to type all the centres in type alpha. We can also splice things together (the 4 
things that are effectively alpha*alpha etc. to ensure that orbits of 24 centres all come in 
one bunch). (An orbit being just the set of positions a particular piece can occupy. If you 
include orientation this is actually of size 24 for every piece - 8*3 for corners 12*2 for 
centre edges, 24*1 for other edges, 24*1 for non-central centres, 6*4 for centre centres.)
The corners can be typed in type 8; there are only 8 corners.
If the cube is odd, the central edges can be typed in type 12. So the two of these can be 
typed in type 20 (finite). This is going to be put at the start of the order.
The non-central edges can be typed in type 24*n+12*alpha+12*alpha* which is easily 
convertible into type 24*alpha=alpha.
Each orbit (of 24 non-central edges) comes together as a clump.
Since 20+2*alpha=alpha, we can easily put the entire cube into type alpha.
We need to do this carefully, to ensure that each orbit of edges comes before all the centre 
pieces running off from those edges. (But there are only finitely many edges per orbit, so it 
is not too difficult.)
In fact, one could run through this by transfinite induction on the (already ordered in type 
alpha) centres. At stage beta, if the appropriate orbit of edges hasn&#x27;t been put in the 
order, put them in before centre beta. (This can be used to define the well-ordering of the 
edges!) (We can define the order to add the orbit using a lexicographic ordering - there 
are two edge positions per edge to add - two on the edge joining UFR to UFL etc. - and 
each lies nearest to one corner so we can order first by edge and then by nearest corner.)
This, then effectively types the entire cube into type alpha (half a side length, more or 
less).
If the corner permutation is odd, start by using D (this will make that permutation even - 
but it will move some centres, edge pieces around - but it will always do so in a fixed way 
and, moreover, in a canonical way that it easy to 
Find the first non-solved position (NB the corners and central edges are right up front, but 
of course, they might already be solved.)
In the case of corners, central edges, you can orient them in a finite number of moves and 
permute them with 3 cycles in a finite number of moves. (3-cycles, because we made the 
permutation even.)
For a non-solved corner/edge we just cycle the position in question, the position holding 
the piece in question and the least other remaining position. In this way we can 
methodically solve the corners and edges.
Then you simply use transfinite induction as follows.
If the cube is not yet solved, there is a least unsolved position (because we have well-
ordered the positions in type alpha and so the set of unsolved positions is a non-empty 
subset of a well-ordered set and hence has a least element).
Given the next unsolved position, if it is a centre, we must already have solved all the 
edges that can be reached by running to the edge from the centre (in a slice) plus all the 
edges in the orbit of such (by way of setting up the order in that way). This implies that 
the orbit of the centre in question has at least 3 unsolved centres and we can 3-cycle the 
unsolved centre in the position we want to solve, the centre that goes into that position 
and the least other unsolved centre.
Again this takes a finite number of moves.
If on the other hand it is an edge, then gain if possible use a 3-cycle described in the 
same way. Otherwise, there will be only two unsolved edges. In this case we slice the 
position in question - this disturbs 4 edges (including the one in question and some 
already solved ones) - in the direction that takes it to the lesser edge position (for 
definiteness). It also permutes several centres (who appear later in the solving stage) doing 
so in a canonical way (that makes it easier to remember where each has mapped to).
In this event we go back and solve those edges in that orbit again, in order (now using 
only 3-cycles). At most this will take 2 3-cycles (we could be left with 1 3-cycle, a double 
transposition or 1 5-cycle) and so again solving the edge (plus correcting any prior 
disturbed edges) takes only a finite number of moves. All these 3-cycles can be done 
similarly to a 5x5x5 and have definite upper lengths, and there are only a finite number 
(of equivalence classes) of algorithms we need, so each stage will take at most M turns (for 
some M). That means the entire solution can be effected in type M*alpha=alpha.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve just downloaded and am now currently watching the video.

To Andy: You obviously put a lot of effort into editing this all
together. Thanks for making this available to all of us!

To everyone who offered advice on how to get the video: Thanks! I had
never used Torrent or Azureus before so I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing
and wouldn&#x27;t have been able to see it without the tips.

To all cubers: Watching this video made me feel quite reminiscent. :) It
was so great seeing everyone again at Worlds and also meeting some new
faces.

Watching the video also makes me think about all the interesting places
I&#x27;ve been to thanks to speedcubing. &#x27;Outsiders&#x27; might (and do!!) say
&#x27;you guys need to get a life and get out more&#x27;, but ironically, I think
speedcubing does mean we &#x27;get out more&#x27;. Whenever I&#x27;ve travelled
anywhere for a cubing event, I usually stay for a little bit of time
either before/after the competition and do some sightseeing, so I do see
more of the city than just the competition venue. Also, there are places
that I&#x27;ve visited for cubing events that I would not yet have been to
otherwise.

What about everyone else? Are there new cities/countries that you have
visited thanks to speedcubing? :)

Yes. But then you&#x27;re disqualified.

I&#x27;d guess yes. But you&#x27;re obviously not allowed to twist them.

Yes. Inside your head only, though.

Stare at the cube.

  lol<br>
   <br>
  I was talking to some people today, when they saw me cubing, and they were asking me if I knew about this guy who just set the world record. I did know. Then they said &quot;he hasn&#x27;t been able to do it on TV though&quot;. And I explained to them that they&#x27;re right, b/c from what I&#x27;ve heard he got an easy scramble, usually it takes him like 15 seconds.. and they&#x27;re like &quot;no he hasn&#x27;t been able to do it at all yet&quot;.<br>

  Then I realized that they actually thought the spoof was real.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve had several people tell me about &#x27;Leyan Lo&#x27; and how he can&#x27;t actually
solve the cube. Letterman always introduces him as the real thing and never
says otherwise, it makes sense that people would believe him. People who
don&#x27;t know anything about cubing just assume what Letterman is saying is
accurate.

I think Letterman is the real idiot.

          <div class="email-content">I saw the clip too and thought it was pretty stupid. I didn&#x27;t think it
was the least bit funny either. And when watching the guy, he OBVIOUSLY
had no idea what he was doing (well, it was obvious to all of us
anyway!). He&#x27;d do one twist, then undo it, then repeat several times,
then find another move, then undo it, then repeat that one several
times. It was SO lame. It would have looked less unrealistic if he&#x27;d
just randomly scrambled the cube!

  Perhaps other people have noticed some of the same things, maybe everyone will disagree with me... I don&#x27;t know. But, here are a few of my observations which suggest (to me) that the show is (to some degree) scripted/rigged/NOT-real.
   
  1) The &quot;Asides&quot; with the camera -- several times per episode, there will be a clip of one of the contestants alone in a room just talking to the camera. In these sessions, they have said things about how they don&#x27;t like their partner, or they hate another contestant, etc. If the show were for real, nobody would say anything about another person that they didn&#x27;t want the other person to know, beacuse the other person would find out about it. The only way to get around this is if everyone was completely isolated from the outside world, which obviously isn&#x27;t true since, for example, Tyson was able to respond to his email, and (if i remember correctly) attend the Caltech cubing tournament which was during the BATG season.
   
  2) Too dumb -- perhaps I have a skewed perspective, but I don&#x27;t think that, for example, ANYBODY in the US doesn&#x27;t know who John Kerry is. Maybe I&#x27;m completely wrong here, but I found that to be entirely too unrealistic. The same goes for plenty of other questions, etc. Remember that some of the girls have attended college. Perhaps it&#x27;s not the ivy league, but anyone college student would know way more than some of those girls are portrayed as knowing. The same goes for some of the things the guys do. Example: If trying to impress females with your decorating abilities, would anyone actually write &quot;in blood&quot; on the wall? ehh not likely. 
   
  3) Chris incident -- kinda the same as my first reason, but if the show was for real, would anyone actually say &quot;No I don&#x27;t like my beauty&quot;. Furthremore, he lies about it.. he tells her he was trying to flatter the other girl.. BUT, then he tells the camera in private that he just &quot;forgot about the hidden camera&quot; or whatever. If the show was for real, I don&#x27;t think he would have said what he said, and I don&#x27;t think he would have gone out and admitted to lying about it to Tristin. 
   
  4) Camerawork/timing etc -- All of the timing etc is perfect, strange for a reality show. Example:  on the first episode (or the second one, whcihever it was) when they did the competition to &quot;get to change around any 2 teams&quot;... They had everyone on the stairs as Chris was going to announce who they had chosen. &quot;The first team that we picked... was us&quot; &lt;Commercial break right away>. Every commercial break is preceded by a dramatic moment, and there are the same number of dramatic moments in each episode, and they occur in regular increments. Perhaps this is stupid, beacuse I suppose they obviously film a lot more than actually gets onto the show, and consequently perfect timing etc could be achieved by good editing, but to me it still seems like everyhting works out too perfectly in this respect.
   
  5) Nobody would ever be as big an asshole as Chris was. Seriously. It makes the show more exciting when there&#x27;s a badguy.. how would the people who screened the show know that he would end up being such a loser? 
   
  These are just a few of the things I noticed. I&#x27;m sure when I watch the show this week I&#x27;ll be reminded of other things. I&#x27;m sure you will too, if you look for them.
   
  Anyways, perhaps I&#x27;m wrong, but it just seems to me that it&#x27;s not real. Or, maybe i&#x27;m right and i&#x27;m the last person to know this? 
   
  Sorry for rambling on for so long.. lol

First let me say that i love the show, and although I have *never* really

          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well,

1) This show was filmed waaaaay before you are actually seeing it on TV. It
is not live and has undergone significant editing before it has aired on
your television. The individual interviews are just that, individual, and
anything said in there is not played back to the other members in the house.
This is typical of a reality show. People&#x27;s comments will remain private
unless those people decide to tell other members in the house.

2) There are many stupid people in the world and I&#x27;m sure the casting
process involved finding some not-as-bright girls to put on the show. The
guys are suppose to be smart and the girls are suppose to be beautiful...

3) I don&#x27;t find it hard to believe at all. Chris is a jerk and that&#x27;s that.

4) When you have a camera on you for almost 24 hours a day, you&#x27;d be
surprised how much footage can be recorded. Just like any show, the footage
will be edited and formatted for a 30-60 minute block of time for tv
episodes. Editing is easy and necessary. Moments of climax are always placed
before a commercial break so that viewers will continue to watch the show.

5) From what I understand, there was a fairly strong interview process.
Chris would obviously be a good guy to have on the show because he makes it
interesting and creates &#x27;drama&#x27;. People like to watch that stuff.


Obviosiosly any edited show will not reflect exactly what happened... but I
highly doubt any of the people&#x27;s reactions or comments are scripted.

the fat white guy was indeed, not Leyan Lo.  Legally, I don&#x27;t think  
there&#x27;s anything that can be done.  I would have thought that people  
watching TV weren&#x27;t that stupid, but apparently something as obvious as  
that to us is completely missed by the general public.

If we could scare them somehow by threatening to sue, it would be a  
shot in the dark, but maybe they could get some compensation from it?   
I think suing them would cost more, and probably wouldn&#x27;t fly because  
technically, I don&#x27;t think they broke any laws, but I&#x27;m not sure.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Chris,

Yeah... I don&#x27;t really want to respond to this one in public.  I don&#x27;t 
want some private investigator named Simone deSimone coming up behind 
me and capping a bullet in my head.  I know Brandon would be scared 
too.  Well, not really, but still...

I&#x27;ll just say that everything was honest, and I&#x27;m actually kind of 
tired of answering this question.  You might as well go and doubt the 
authenticity of my blindfold solves while you&#x27;re at it, but at the end 
of the day, I know I can solve the cube blindfolded, and I know I can 
do it in under 2-minutes.

The show is honest, it was not rigged.

<br>
Amazing. A TV virgin! Maybe we should have The Talk...<br>
<br>
Reality shows are heavily edited. They have hundreds of hours of  <br>
footage for each episode that they cut down to 45 minutes. The goal  <br>
of the editing is not to report as truthfully as possible what  <br>
happened that day, but to make an as entertaining as possible show.  <br>
This includes directly lying about events, as well as implying events  <br>
and motivations that didn&#x27;t exist. The contestants typically sign  <br>
away any rights to complain about things like this when they take the  <br>
job.<br>
<br>
However, they are typically not faked in a scripted way. That&#x27;s much  <br>
too hard to to, and you need real talented actors and scriptwriters  <br>
to make that work. Part of the motivation for all the &quot;reality&quot; TV  <br>
getting shown is that it&#x27;s very expensive to hire that level of  <br>
acting and writing talent.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;   1) The &quot;Asides&quot; with the camera<br>
<br>
This is very standard. Everyone knows these confessions could end up  <br>
in the final show. But that&#x27;s long after they&#x27;ve left the mansion.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The only way to get around this is if everyone was completely  <br>
&gt; isolated from the outside world, which obviously isn&#x27;t true since,  <br>
&gt; for example, Tyson was able to respond to his email, and (if i  <br>
&gt; remember correctly) attend the Caltech cubing tournament which was  <br>
&gt; during the BATG season.<br>
<br>
The way they did this was they recorded it all in October.<br>
<br>
&gt;   2) Too dumb -- perhaps I have a skewed perspective, but I don&#x27;t  <br>
&gt; think that, for example, ANYBODY in the US doesn&#x27;t know who John  <br>
&gt; Kerry is.<br>
<br>
Yes, you do need to get out more. These people are very much out  <br>
there. It&#x27;s not so much an issue of being dumb (though that helps) as  <br>
of not being interested.<br>
<br>
You know, a lot of people would take your questions here  and wonder  <br>
if anyone could really be that uninformed about reality TV to not  <br>
know it was all prerecorded. The reason you didn&#x27;t know is not that  <br>
you&#x27;re stupid, you just weren&#x27;t keeping up with this field.<br>
<br>
&gt;   4) Camerawork/timing etc -- All of the timing etc is perfect,  <br>
&gt; strange for a reality show.<br>
<br>
Well, it&#x27;s edited over several months by pros. Of course it&#x27;s gonna  <br>
look good.<br>
<br>
&gt;   5) Nobody would ever be as big an asshole as Chris was.  <br>
&gt; Seriously. It makes the show more exciting when there&#x27;s a badguy..  <br>
&gt; how would the people who screened the show know that he would end  <br>
&gt; up being such a loser?<br>
<br>
They make him into an asshole through editing. Maybe he really is  <br>
that big a jerk, but if not, they can very easily make him into one  <br>
through selective editing. It&#x27;s standard reality show fare, you need  <br>
to give the audience someone to root for and against.<br>

  Speedcubing.com lists the new unofficial world record for most cubes <br>

  Cornu.  This is listed as more than Jess Bonde&#x27;s 2000.  But wait...if <br>

What I found more scary was the girl who didn&#x27;t know Baghdad is the 
capitol of Iraq and answered Afghanistan instead. Is that the common 
level of knowledge in USA about what the USA are doing? Or is she just 
really ... uh ... beautiful?

Unless with &quot;editing&quot; you mean they put words in his mouth, I kinda 
disagree. Not just because of how he &quot;interviewed&quot; the other teams in 
the first episode. But also because of his behaviour watching his girl 
in the elimination room when Tyson was thrown out. He partied with 
every correct answer of his girl and even said &quot;sweet&quot; when Tyson&#x27;s 
girl got something wrong. You may do that in private. But not if Tyson 
is sitting right next to you. Unless you&#x27;re a jerk.

Ok, I just realized the possibility that Chris actually said &quot;sweet&quot; 
at another point of time, not as reaction to Thais&#x27; wrong answer. 
Would they do this type of editing? At least they make it look like 
it&#x27;s running parallel by showing both the elimination room and the 
watching room in parallel.

          <div class="email-content">hi, hope this isnt a dumb question, but I am hoping you can help<br>
settle an argument between a friend and I.<br>
<br>
His method of solving the cube is to study it for ~2 minutes, and then<br>
solve in about 40 seconds. I dont know what method he uses.<br>
<br>
My method of solving the cube is to pick the cube up and just start<br>
solving immediately, it takes me about 1 min 30 seconds<br>
to solve using a pretty straightforward method from a 20 year old<br>
Penguin paperback book.<br>
<br>
My argument is, that it takes him about 2 mins 40 to solve the cube,<br>
whereas it takes me about 1 min 30, but he argues he is the fastest,<br>
discounting the studying time and claiming it takes him only 40 seconds.<br>
<br>
In any situation though, whenever we are both simultaneously passed a<br>
cube neither of us has seen before, I always solve before he has even<br>
started twisting.<br>
<br>
so who is fastest?<br>
<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">ok, so the official examination time is about 15
seconds. so you should actually be studying the cube
15 seconds before you start solving. but you have a
raw speed of about 1 min 30 right? right. 

your friend has 15 seconds to study the cube as well.
if he does not start after that, then its his problem.
if he solves the cube in 40 secs after looking at the
cube for 2 mins, then his real score is actually 2
mins 40 secs minus 15 secs which is 2 mins and 25
secs.

you are obviously faster. in a tornament that is. 

hope i answered your question

          <div class="email-content">Well, considering the 15 second inspection time, that you don&#x27;t use,
but he (technically) does, so he takes...2 mins 25 seconds, meaning
you still take less time.

I say you are faster...because studying for 2 minutes isn&#x27;t that
smart, and you&#x27;d never get the time to do that...and what can you look
at for 2 minutes??? Even the best blindfolders don&#x27;t take that long...

Anyway, 15 seconds is the official regulation time.  So, if he were 
in a contest, he&#x27;d get a time of 2:25.  I vote for you.

for all the time.  However, I don&#x27;t know how likely you are to be <br>
successful, especially since it would seem that slander is largely <br>
how comedians make a living.  With something as targeted as what he&#x27;s <br>
done (obviously discrediting a specific individual), though, you may <br>
have a better chance.  Of course, you are also talking about going up <br>
against someone/something with significant financial backing - good <br>
luck!<br>
<br>
Regardless, in the end, any action against Letterman would probably <br>
just be fuel for him to use against you (Leyan).  Perhaps a better <br>
approach would be to try to get Leyan (the real one) some air time - <br>
perhaps even on Letterman&#x27;s show.  Sure, he&#x27;s not likely to repeat <br>
his 11 second performance, but at least he could repair some of the <br>
damage done by the negative publicity provided by Letterman.<br>

          <div class="email-content">wow, thanks for the quick answers guys.<br>
<br>
Im not sure if my amateur method would benefit from 15 seconds study<br>
time, Im not good enough to think moves in advance. I just pick it up<br>
and start making the top layer immediately, without giving much<br>
thought as to what i&#x27;ll be doing after that bit is done :)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll try and find out a bit more about what hes doing, he just looks<br>
at it while holding his fingers on the cube in fixed locations while<br>
looking all around the cube, then he&#x27;ll move his fingers and look for<br>
another 5 seconds, and so on, until eventually he just starts twisting.<br>

&quot;Frankenbiting&quot; to your vocabulary: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/

Though it would be hard to fake that cheering footage. It had to be  
taken at some time during the elimination. And you&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s  
bad sportsmanship. Bad winners are even worse than bad losers.

I don&#x27;t doubt Chris has some rough edges to his personality, but I  
also don&#x27;t doubt that the editors work hard to pick out the few  
minutes of footage each day that will make him look the worst. Or to  
be more precise, will make their show the most interesting.

Or put it this way. They could just as easily have put together a  
show where we would never be having a conversation about how big a  
jerk he may be.

<br>
I&#x27;ve just brought a rubik cube 3x3, but it is so tight<br>
I&#x27;ve seen some speedcubing video and the cubes they use are all very <br>
loose and can be turned extremely smoothly.<br>
<br>
<br>
What&#x27;s wrong with my rubik??<br>
Surely my rubik is the official one, not those low quality $1 or $2 <br>
rubiks.<br>
<br>
Do i need to add lubricant or do other things to make it turn smoothly??<br>

Thank you all for the congratulations...

To Chris: I think I&#x27;ve found a fault with the DIYs...The edges are
bigger than the center pieces (you know how there is an opening on the
one side of the edge) well that can slide over the center, which I
have found can cause pops, and send center caps across the room...But
I still love it :)

To Darren: I used to do LBL, but I had always wanted to do F2L...and
Chris Hardwick taught me in December, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever
since...I don&#x27;t know how fast that F2L on that solve was, but a few
weeks ago I did an F2L average of around 19...but I think I&#x27;m better
than that now...It was just a fast fluid solve, and a 3LLL...

          <div class="email-content">Anssi, do I have to answer?!
They say that my method is mad (but I´m too old to change): The first layer (cross then corners) followed by CLL and then the rest. 
Average number of moves; 56-57, average time (at home) 31-32 s. (But bear in mind that I am almost twice as old as your father).

My best cube is combined from two 25th anniversary cubes. I used it in 
Swedish Open and it&#x27;s still my best.
Rune, what&#x27;s your method and average at home?

          <div class="email-content">Hi, I am the lucky new owner of a couple original 1981 cubes in<br>
apparent mint condition. From reading around I understand they could<br>
make a good speedcubes..<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m surprised by this since they are really stiff. Do I need to<br>
consider replacing any parts (eg. the kernel) or is it just the case<br>
that it needs many hours working in and lubing. I&#x27;d rather not replace<br>
anything unless I have to to keep it original but if I had to then<br>
where should I go to get replacement parts for this type of cube.<br>
<br>
Anyone had trouble removing centre caps from this age of cube?  I<br>
accidentally damaged one of the centre caps to get at the screws. It<br>
seems that the intervening years welded the cap on somewhat. Any tips<br>
for this.<br>
<br>
Finally, I notice that the inside of the centre cubies are flat, not<br>
curved like the  DIY cubes are. Am I right in thinking that flat ones<br>
are more prone to popping (hence the design change) because that<br>
certainly seems to be the case on this cube. Having slightly loosened<br>
the tension and lubricated the first of the cubes It still doesn&#x27;t<br>
move that easily and it pops all the time. It seems my only option is<br>
to tighten the tension again to stop the popping but that means a<br>
stiff cube again. <br>

          <div class="email-content">If you&#x27;ve bought your cube from a shop then it is not the same as the cubes that speedcubers use - even if it is Rubik&#x27;s. Apparently only one in ten shop-bought cubesare suitable for speedcubing. 
   
  The best bet is to buy the DIY black cubes directly from the Rubik&#x27;s website. I&#x27;ve only got the blank 3x3 from rubiks that you have to sticker yourself at the mo, but even that is about twenty times better than my shop bought cube.
   
  Also, you can apparently get RSI from trying speedcube on a bad cube, so be careful.

  Sorry, i am a newbie.

I&#x27;ve just brought a rubik cube 3x3, but it is so tight
I&#x27;ve seen some speedcubing video and the cubes they use are all very 
loose and can be turned extremely smoothly.


What&#x27;s wrong with my rubik??
Surely my rubik is the official one, not those low quality $1 or $2 
rubiks.

Do i need to add lubricant or do other things to make it turn smoothly??

          <div class="email-content">Rubiks.com sells assembly cubes that you can fine-tune to be very good.
They cost about what a store-bought cube would (plus shipping).

&quot;Stickiness&quot; has nothing to do with the cube and everything to do with the
lube.  Use 100% silicone spray.  Try Lowes or Pep Boys or somewhere.  Don&#x27;t
use anything with petroleum in it.

Cubesmith.com has lots of good options for stickers/tiles.

You&#x27;ll need maybe $30 for what I mentioned above.  It&#x27;s not an expensive
hobby, but if you&#x27;re only willing to pay $5, you&#x27;re not going to have a good
cube.

it together wet and give it a day or two before expecting the stickiness to
stop?

My spray seems to work awesome the first time I use it on any cube, but
after the first time the cubes get sticky... sometimes worse than when they
were un-lubed in the first place.

me, that means that he is struggling to maintain his current speed

Compare this to running.  You might say &quot;you would win an official

          <div class="email-content">yea, you need to add lubricant. use silicon spray (not wd-40, that
eats away at the plastic). i personally think the prestone one is
pretty good, and is available at wal-mart in the auto section.

Great article, Lars! It fits in with what I&#x27;ve pretty much known all 
along - that &quot;reality&quot; shows, like all TV shows, are &quot;manipulated&quot; 
(a more appropriate word) for dramatic effect. 

Some friends of mine were on a family &quot;reality&quot; show, &quot;Meet Mister 
Mom&quot; (http://www.nbc.com/Meet_Mister_Mom/). In this show, they take 
two large families where the mom runs the house, send the moms off 
to a spa for a week and give dad and the kids challenges. One 
challenge was a family game of football. My friends clobbered the 
other team (their kids are very athletic) but for the show the game 
became a tie.

There&#x27;s so much footage taken that they can present people and 
situations in whatever manner they wish. BATG was filmed over the 
course of a week or two, so it&#x27;s a small sample of someone&#x27;s 
personality in what I imagine is a stressful situation. You have to 
give credit to Tyson that he continually presents as a good guy in 
the show. (My daughter was sad when Tyson and Thais were 
eliminated). 

Random question for Tyson: My wife commented that &quot;I&#x27;ll bet those 
women never talked to any of the guys again after the show was 
done?&quot; Can you prove her wrong? (I said I&#x27;d bet some ex-contestants 
send email back and forth).

How did you manage to go sub-20? Is your standard deviation very high?

Btw, congrats !

Sapan: Nice to hear from you again, just the other day I was wondering
what happened to you...

Sven: Umm, I average around 26-27 when I&#x27;m warmed up, but I get a lot
of times varying around 20, especially the good and easy solves...I&#x27;ve
gotten quite a bit better in the last month and a half since Chris
Hardwick taught me F2L...I&#x27;m planning on learning PLL soon, and then
OLL, so hopefully these times become more regular...At school today I
got a lot of 22s and 23s and the likes, some faster, some slower...

I decided to open it up.  It&#x27;s great! very smooth with no lubricant.

Someone posted earlier that they use DIY innards with 1981 pieces.
Maybe you could try that.

I think that it is heavier and a little bit bigger... maybe just my

So you don&#x27;t know PLL or OLL and Chris Hardwick just taught you F2L 6 
weeks ago, and you are now hitting sub 20 times, and a lot of 21 and 
22 second solves? Perhaps Chris should be giving his F2L class in 
group settings.  I&#x27;d sign up.  That is pretty good for only knowing 
1/3 of a system.  Congrats.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been working on it a lot in that time period Dave...I know some
OLL and am planning on learning PLL...there are many cubers out there
that average sub-20 with a 3LLL...so...a good solve for me,
reasonably, would be sub-20...

          <div class="email-content">Oh, and I&#x27;ve only hit 1 sub-20 time...and you can ask anyone who
watches me cube (pretty much my family and anyone at school, all of
whom regularly scramble for me...) and they&#x27;ll tell you those are
common times for me...Its just getting more consistent...My times are
still a bit jumpy...

          <div class="email-content">I started learning OLL in August, and PLL shortly thereafter.  I was 
learning both simultaneously for a while.
October 31 I finished learning PLL
November 26 or so (on a Saturday I believe) I finished OLL

Just found a file listing which algs I knew on Oct 30...
35/57 OLL
17/21 PLL

So it took me a month to learn last 22 cases of OLL
I remember it was the 4 G cases that I learned last for PLL

But I still check my list occasionally when I forget a case

Probably more than you cared to hear...:)

          <div class="email-content">You&#x27;ve gotta be sceptical.

Seeing as how your sunday contest average you have a week before your
22.5 average was 34 seconds, plus you three/four look, plus you don&#x27;t
know OLL/PLL. And you always seemed to be around 33 when i was racing
you about a week ago.

Then there was that non-lucky OLL skip you claimed to have.


I&#x27;m not blatently calling you a liar, as you could be telling the
truth. But things like this just make it harder to belive.

Crongratulations, if I&#x27;m mistaken.


In other news: New PB single 16.15 (I had a 16.43 today!) I&#x27;m still
averaging around 21-22 though but..... I&#x27;ve finished learning CMLL!
Including recognition! One look corners, and one look last layer for
me :D. I just gotta get every case recognised and executed under two
seconds. Then I&#x27;ll be sub-20.

Rethinking my non-matching blocks technique :S

          <div class="email-content">Hey Thom,

I understand your reasoning, and since you&#x27;ve shut me out I haven&#x27;t
had the chance to explain...

The time I got the 34 was beacuse:
a) I hadn&#x27;t been cubing for a week(at all) cuz I was studying for
exams and my mom had taken away ALL of my cubes...so I had little
practice...
b) The cube I was using had gone to mush...lockups, it began popping,
it was gooey...probably some other factors...

I don&#x27;t count the 22.53 average as my PB average because it wasn&#x27;t
100% real, I did solves in between (at school...) I did some one
night, then the others another night, and it was a rolling average...I
count my PB average to be about 24 or 25...not sure exact...

Thom, towards the racing thing, look at my previous post about people
who watch me cube often...also about the many other cubers who do a
3LLL and get sub-20 times, I believe Doug Reed to be one of them (or
used to be)

          <div class="email-content">Aww,  c&#x27;mon,  Thom.  I average 26s over a hundred solves and will 
have a few of those sub-20, surely you did too when you were 
averaging in the high 20&#x27;s.  An easy cross with a couple quick F2L 
pairs will take off a lot of non-lucky but easy seconds for us high 
20 guys. I just wish I could average a quick F2L.

So what&#x27;s CMLL?  Is that M not supposed to be there?

Err.. hey, no. I hope you didn&#x27;t read my post as accusing you of 
something. I was actually being playful in your statement that you 
are &quot;planning on learning&quot; PLL and OLL, since you must know some if you 
have use a 3-Look.  I don&#x27;t doubt you hit a sub 20 time.  A very 
efficient F2L can give those results, and practicing it a lot will only 
serve to make those nice solve even nicer.  Keep at it.

          <div class="email-content">You could start by learning the edges-only and corners-only OLL.  I believe
there are only around 12 of those.  I learned them in a week.

You can quickly chain an edge alg and a corner alg to handle OLL with only
two algorithms.  Technically, this is 3LLL, but you can determine which edge
alg and which corner alg you&#x27;re going to use in a single look, so in my mind
it&#x27;s just a slow 2LLL.  Am I wrong?

Then, you can learn the rest of OLL to do corners and edges together in one
algorithm.  I have not yet done this (and am not really looking forward to
it).

It was Canada Post. Supposed to take 30-50 days but took about 3. It&#x27;s
like RUBIK&#x27;s spent the huge postage excess  on some priority air mail
postage option.

Fair enough, but you have to understand why I felt like that in the
first place.

Craig: I really don&#x27;t care anymore :) Good job on the sub-20.

          <div class="email-content">I thought of Lesotho at first, then Vatican of course.

I hesitated about Liechtenstein, but it appears to have a border with 
Switzerland and Germany, same for Andorra (between France and Spain).

Interesting subject.
Btw, do you know with which country France has the longest land border ?

(ok I&#x27;ll just give you the answer : Brasil)

Have fun !
Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Just keep cubing. Just don&#x27;t think too hard about reaching that 
_impossible_ limit. Then u lock up. Keep relaxed and focused. 
Reinforce what u know and work on recognition and flow. Oh, i know u 
know all this already.

Good luck :-)

<br>
I taught him actually how to solve it yesterday.  In two hours he <br>
learned everything he needed to know.<br>
<br>
I taught him a layer by layer method.<br>
<br>
I think I&#x27;ve thought up a new F2L method to teach him though.<br>
<br>
Cross (8 or less moves)<br>
3-move algs for the corners place 3 corners<br>
Use a Key Hole Variation to place three MidLayer edges<br>
3-move Alg for last corner<br>
7 move Alg for last edge<br>
<br>
Orient Edges (6) or (12)<br>
Permute Corners (10 or 20 moves)<br>
Orient Corners (7 or 14)<br>
Orient Edges (14 or 28)<br>
<br>
The max it&#x27;d take to solve the cube using minimal algorithms would be <br>
120 moves which is an easy 2 minute solve for a beginner right?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Greetings.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m new to the group and wanted to get some advice.  I&#x27;ve got a little <br>
bit of knowledge, just enough to be dangerous.  I can more or less <br>
intuitively get the cross and F2L solved.  As far as LL methods, <br>
ultimately, I think COLL + PLL may be a good goal.<br>
<br>
I was planning on starting with PLL algorithms (since I&#x27;d probably <br>
need to know these to start with, even using COLL).  Is this <br>
recommended?<br>
<br>
Also, what is the best way to practice the algorithms?  On a solved <br>
cube?<br>

nice method to start, but at the beginning it&#x27;s rather hard to average 1 <br>
move per second.<br>
though it can be reached pretty fast as soon as you know what to look for.<br>

But it&#x27;s gonna be hard to be very hard with such a method thoug ;-)<br>

&gt; Hey guys, I&#x27;m teaching my teacher how to solve the cube.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I taught him actually how to solve it yesterday.  In two hours he <br>
&gt; learned everything he needed to know.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I taught him a layer by layer method.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I think I&#x27;ve thought up a new F2L method to teach him though.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Cross (8 or less moves)<br>
&gt; 3-move algs for the corners place 3 corners<br>
&gt; Use a Key Hole Variation to place three MidLayer edges<br>
&gt; 3-move Alg for last corner<br>
&gt; 7 move Alg for last edge<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Orient Edges (6) or (12)<br>
&gt; Permute Corners (10 or 20 moves)<br>
&gt; Orient Corners (7 or 14)<br>
&gt; Orient Edges (14 or 28)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The max it&#x27;d take to solve the cube using minimal algorithms would be <br>
&gt; 120 moves which is an easy 2 minute solve for a beginner right?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I taught my girlfriend to solve the F2L the same way you describe. Her LL
only differs in the order of things. I think it makes more sense to teach:

Orient Edges, Orient corners, Permute edges, Permute Corners.

This makes it easy to expand to full OLL and PLL because you can still use
the algs that you learned early on. If you permute the corners without
worrying about their orientation, then those algs will be useless when/if
your teacher decides to learn more OLL and PLL.

My girlfriend averages around 1:30 and doesn&#x27;t really practice...ever...so
2:00 is a reasonable time for this method.

          <div class="email-content">hello all<br>
<br>
i need to do some hardcore cross training (groan!).  i think that it<br>
would really help to have a few hundred 15 move scrambles with<br>
solutions for the cross alone.<br>
<br>
my plan is as follows<br>
<br>
1. generate a load of scrambles out of jnetcube<br>
2. truncate to 15 moves<br>
3. write a little program to calculate the positions and orientations<br>
of the D layer edges for each of the scrambles<br>
4. run these through acube<br>
5. collate the results into a neat file<br>
<br>
obviously if someone already has a load of scrambles and solutions<br>
that would be really cool.<br>
<br>
would anyone else be interested in the resultant file?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think most people start out learning all the PLLs - there are only
21 and they&#x27;re easy to practice, since almost all of them are inverses
of themselves. Start on a solved cube and just keep doing the
algorithm to get the execution down. After you&#x27;ve learned most or all
of them, just do normal solves to work on the recognition.

If vaselina is a petroleum jelly, why is then all silicone spray

is not? I know of course that petroleum is a mix of hydrocarbones

endorsing it as a good lube.

Are there silicone sprays with petroleum in them?  I just checked mine again
and it mentions in the safety warning that it contains &quot;petroleum
distillates&quot;.  Is that bad?!?  I thought I was safe getting anything labeled
&quot;silicone spray&quot;.  That might explain why my cube is acting funny after
using this stuff for the last couple of months.

Second attempt -- sorry, Per, I had completely misunderstood your post.

The vaseline /is/ harmful.  If you use it to loosen a cube (i.e., by 
using its harmful properties!) you should clean it off carefully just 
as soon as the cube is loose enough.  Otherwise the cube will keep 
getting looser.

The &quot;distillates&quot; (used as a solvent in the spray, I believe) are low-
boiling-point liquids that ought to evaporate quickly, leaving only the 
silicone on your cube.

But I don&#x27;t know whether they are always safe in practice, as I have 
only ever used pure silicone -- not from a spraycan.

          <div class="email-content">Let&#x27;s say your top + bottom colors are white + yellow (they might 
not be, just replace white + yellow with your preferred top + bottom 
colors).

Let&#x27;s take a white corner on the white side.  The correct 
orientation, clearly, is white facing upward (assuming white is the 
top side).  What&#x27;s clockwise + what&#x27;s counter-clockwise?  Well, look 
head-on at the corner in question, so you can see all three 
stickers.  See if it&#x27;s twisted once clockwise relative to the 
correct orientation, or counter-clockwise.  If the correct spot for 
white is at 12 o&#x27;clock, then being twisted clockwise means it&#x27;s at 4 
o&#x27;clock, and being twised counter-clockwise is 8 o&#x27;clock.

The same thing goes for yellow corners on the yellow side.

What about white corner on yellow side?  Well, just pretend that the 
yellow center is white and follow the above rules.  And, again, same 
goes for yellow corner on white side.

What about corners with white AND yellow, or corners with neither?  
Er...they don&#x27;t exist (assuming your color scheme has white opposite 
yellow)

Hope this all makes sense; it&#x27;s easy once you get used to it, don&#x27;t 
worry.

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s part of article 5 of the WCA regulations:

Article 5: Puzzle Defects
5a) Puzzle defects are unintentional defects of puzzles (like: 
pieces popping, wires breaking, screws/caps/stickers falling off) 
that make it impossible or harder to solve the puzzle. 
...
**5c) In &#x27;Best of&#x27; and &#x27;Average of 5&#x27; rounds solves with a puzzle 
defect cannot be exchanged by an extra attempt. 
**5d) In &#x27;Mean of 3&#x27; rounds solves with a puzzle defect may be 
exchanged by an extra attempt. 
5d1) There may be maximum 1 extra attempt per round. 
...
5d3) A judge may decide to disqualify a solve or to not award an 
extra attempt, if the competitor&#x27;s puzzle defect is ruled 
intentional, under discretion of the judge.

So, if you&#x27;re in a mean of 3 round (clock, square-1, megaminx), and 
you can pop without looking intentional (heck, if you can pop a 
clock, that&#x27;s something), then go for it!  But, if they suspect 
you...tough luck, DNS and no extra solve.  So, for that reason, it&#x27;s 
really not a good idea to intentionally pop.  Anyway, it&#x27;s dishonest 
to pop intentionally for an extra solve.

And believe me, if you pop your cube intentionally, Mark will go

          <div class="email-content">Vaseline works great initially, but it will destroy your cube after 
a number of years.  I had a great Rubik&#x27;s Game cube that I took out 
after storing it for several years, and it dissolved the central 
burr.  The cube fell apart the second I tried to turn it.  
Fortunately I had another part that I used to rebuild it.  The 
pieces were still okay, but there was a slimy black coating over 
everything before I cleaned it up.

Silicone oil works just as well, and is safer on plastic.

faster it dries, the better.

I never got a response about whether people using silicone spray put their
cube together wet or let it dry first.

U don&#x27;t like ppl from Moldova?

And why would any judge care about intentional popping? It only 
hurts the cuber who did it because it can only serve to spoil a good 
solve and give a worse average or a non-average as a result ;-)

Have fun!

if you take your cube apart, to more or less paint<br>

Oh, &quot;not allowed&quot; again sounds like you&#x27;ll go to jail for it. Or be 
disqualified. Or get a DNF.

But all it means is that you don&#x27;t get an extra attempt for it, right? 
So that you have to and *are allowed* to fix and continue the solve.

Also, since you picked the &quot;average of 5&quot;, does that mean we still get 
extra attempts for &quot;mean of 3&quot; when we pop??

Just ordered a 4x4x4 cube and a megaminx from Mefferts, and I have a few questions. First, the megaminx is listed as a &quot;tiled megaminx&quot;, and the description says it has vinyl stickers. I bought tiles from cubesmith for my 3x3x3 and like them a lot... since this megaminx is &quot;tiled&quot;, does this mean that they won&#x27;t turn to shit and fall off in a month like the rubik&#x27;s stickers? <br>

Also -- I assume the 4x4x4 cube has the same crappy stickers that my 3x3x3 had?<br>

This way, there is only one CP alg to learn, and OC remains the same.

Also, it flows better into the COLL 3 look, which uses fewer algs and allows
fewer moves.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just got back from a sort of cube club type meeting at Duke <br>
University.  I brought about 30 puzzles for people to play with and <br>
in the course of the night successfully taught 6 people how to <br>
solve, and 2-3 others how to solve the F2L.  A few people didn&#x27;t <br>
have time to finish learning, and also Tyson I met a girl there who <br>
said she knew you and Leyan, but sadly I didn&#x27;t catch her name.<br>
<br>
Anyway the method I taught to the people I did teach was Joel van <br>
Noort&#x27;s LL mixed in with my own stuff for F2L (cross + corners + F2L <br>
edges, for which I have a system that is easy to teach/remember but <br>
of course not very speedy).<br>
<br>
Anyway I was very impressed with how easy it is to teach the LL with <br>
commutators, rather than &quot;ok do this sequence, and don&#x27;t ask me how <br>
it works because it&#x27;s &#x27;magic&#x27;&quot;.  I found that the 6 I was able to <br>
teach understood exactly what they were doing for LL, and also they <br>
were all able to remember what they did with minimal reminders from <br>
me after the initial teaching session.  All of the people I taught <br>
simply wanted to learn to solve and weren&#x27;t interested in speed.<br>
<br>
So in concluson, with quite a lot of experience teaching people to <br>
solve the cube, I have to say that Joel&#x27;s commutator LL is the <br>
best/easiest I&#x27;ve ever used.  It will definitely be the method I <br>
teach to people who just want to learn to solve, and aren&#x27;t <br>
interesed in later scaling to a speedier method.<br>
<br>
So Joel, I think your method is great, and will definitely be what I <br>
teach to beginners in the future :-)<br>

FOR OC, sune and antisune are great, because they don&#x27;t mess with the
permutation of the corners.  ALSO it is very important to remember
that you only need to turn the R and U sides of the cube for sune and
antisune.  This is very easy for a beginner.  I teach using RURU&#x27; and
URU&#x27;R&#x27; to do F2l, also 2 gen.

Its harder to learn R&#x27;FRB&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27;RB and its inverse than Sune and
Antisune.  And these algs switch corner positions.


Jason Kovacic



PS;; EVAN, I really like your idea to orient all pieces of cross on
opposite side before insertion.  I now use this method to teach people
the cross (2 people so far)

HELLO ROUX USERS. 

Step 2 is pretty hard, and of step 2 the DR edge is the hardest to
insert. In this step, I usually take care of the DR edge right away,
and then build the 2 CE pairs around it. But If you have 1 or both CE
pairs built already, here are my ALgs for insertion of DR edge.

For Back CE pair already done;
If White/red edge is in the ring put it in UB position
If Red sticker is facing Up, do (UR&#x27;)U&#x27;(R2U)R
If Red sticker is on the B slice, do r&#x27;U&#x27;(RUR)

For Front CE pair already done;
If white/red edge is in the ring, put it in the UF position
If Red sticker is facing Up, do U&#x27; (RU )R2U&#x27;R&#x27;
If Red sticker is on the F slice, do (r UR&#x27;U&#x27;)R&#x27;
  
FOr Both CE pairs already done;

If White/red edge is in the ring put it in DF position.  
IF Red sticker is on the F slice, do (R2U)M&#x27;U&#x27;R2.  
If Red sticker is on D slice, do r&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;(MU)R2


THERE is nothing crazy here, but all of the above algs allow you to
keep your left handed grip on Block 1.

1) Last pair: Piece of cake.<br>
2) The only problem is the 1x2x2. If DR-edge already is in R-layer<br>
with the right orientation, it&#x27;s only a matter of adding a corner-edge<br>
pair. But the &quot;DR first&quot; strategy may be a bit slow, because you have<br>
to check for DR-edge and then find two pieces before starting. I<br>
prefer the &quot;1x1x2 first&quot; technique, because you can assemble 2 pieces<br>
as fast as you solve DR-edge, and then assembling the 1x1x2 and<br>
another edge is like solving a pair, but without any constraint except<br>
preserving the first 1x2x3.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris!

Nice to hear that the method works... Allthough I have to say a few 
things about this... I didn&#x27;t really come up with the method myself. 
I really just combined some existing moves to make a method... And 
Ton Dennebroek was using the same type of ideas to teach beginners 
to solve the cube.

One other thing: People on the internet really don&#x27;t like that 
commutator. I made a simpler method that is easier to follow from 
the webpage. I think my explanation of the commutator method is 
somewhat complicated or something... But because commutators are 
cool, I am now also making a section about them! It will take a 
while to finish it, but it&#x27;s gonna be interesting for both beginners 
and experienced cubers (who don&#x27;t know about commutators).

Happy cubing :),

- Joël

          <div class="email-content">>From what I understand, the vinyl stickers part is a typo.  Only the 6-color
megaminx had vinyl stickers.

You&#x27;ll need to learn 2 more algorithms for solving parity problems with the
4x4x4.  Chris&#x27;s page on speedcubing.com has them.  I was able to get the
rest of it solved just using my 3x3x3 know-how and some creative thinking.
You should then be able to solve the 5x5x5 (and any bigger cube, i think?)
using only what you had to learn for the 4x4x4 and more creative thinking.

This is off-topic, but... I ordered my megaminx from mefferts almost two
weeks ago, and the only notification I got about my order was confirmation
of my paypal transaction.  Does mefferts notify you when your puzzle ships?
Or does it just magically show up at your door one day?  How long does it
usually take people in USA to get shipments from mefferts?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joel,

Looking back at your page I actually did change some stuff.  I read 
your page a while back and liked the idea, but I substituted a 
different corner flip commutator without realizing.

To flip corners I showed them L D2 L&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F to flip the corner 
clockwise and F&#x27; D2 F L D2 L&#x27; to flip counterclockwise.

Other than that I used the same moves you did exactly for the LL.

What made this work so well is that after doing L D2 L&#x27; type moves 
to flip corners, then also using L D2 L&#x27; to move them (I used the L 
reflection, since I prefer LU moves) I could say &quot;and of course that 
should look familiar, we&#x27;re using the same idea as flipping corners 
only we&#x27;re only doing part of the move&quot;.

So all the moves were conjugate manuevers with a D2 in them.  To 
move edges I used your M D2 M&#x27; so again the same form.  Having 
absolutely every step of a similar form (conjuagte with a D2) made 
it very easy for them to memorize.  My only suggestion for the 
method on your site would be to try that commutator for flipping 
corners since it makes everything a conjugate with a D2 move.  The 
repetition helps a lot for helping a beginner remember what to do.

Just my two cents of course, but I found it to work very, very well.

Well thanks Ton and Joel for the idea, I like this commutator LL 
much better than my old way of showing people, and will definitely 
use it in the future.  So thanks again!

Chris

          <div class="email-content">I agree that simplicity is important for a beginner&#x27;s method, but I beleive
that OE PC OC PE isn&#x27;t the simplest.  In my beginners method I teach

One alg for OE          F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;
One alg for OC          R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;
One alg for PC          l&#x27; U R&#x27; D2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R2 *
One alg for OE          F2 U L R&#x27; F2 L&#x27; R U F2 **

*in this case the lowercase l means a double layer turn
**I teach to turn U in the direction that the edge needs to go, so this and
its inverse are learned at the same time, but as only one alg

It is true that this is not a genuine four look last layer, but it has fewer
algs and is easier to teach to a beginner (in my opinion).  From this point
it is easy to add algs in one at a time for each step in working up to a
four look last layer.

Jason, I&#x27;m glad to hear that you found part of my solution helpful.  To be
perfectly fair, most of that beginner solution is the way Tyson taught me to
teach people (I hope that makes sense) with a few changes.
Just my two cents

Until next time, Happy Cubing

That is pretty cool, and I would love to have one for my house. But 
for $500 USD, I had better be able to scramble and then solve the 
thing.  How much would it cost to build one like they had at the 
Championships (and other places, as I have seen in pictures)? Surely 
it would cost less than $500 USD.  Are there specs available for 
that? I would like to build my own if it was fairly straight forward 
with materials that are common to find.

Another page about commutators I made long ago:

And there are many others similar on the web, but I can&#x27;t remember where.

They are probably just trying to avoid paying Rubik&#x27;s royalties or
something.

Very stylish but probably more apropriate for a McDonalds kids playgroung
than to my lving room though. I would have to redecorate everything to make
it fit.

Just another cube/style related thought:
When I bought my first cube my intention was nothing more that decorative. I
just intended to take it out of the box, put it in the shelf and only touch
it again to take the dust off. Solving it was nowhere near my plans. You all
know what happened then...

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I revisited ur page again today Gilles :-)

Why not use : F&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; E2 B U F instead of M S D S&#x27; D2 M&#x27; ??

I think it&#x27;s easier to understand and more in line with what u show 
for the corners. And also the part doing the job is symmetric. So P 
Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; is in fact same as P Q P Q&#x27; which for some will be more 
logical. Well, anyway showing that breaks the spirit of 
commutators ;-)

Umm, by the way. Flipping one edge on U-layer is much faster as R&#x27; 
E&#x27; R2 E2 R&#x27; than using F and E moves. I know the beginner solution 
is not meant for speeding. But even so ... hehe ...

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">Well I got a look at the new 2006 DIY cube.  Craig is right-- these do 
seem to be all-new manufacture.  The corner cap gap is less than 1mm, 
a little smaller than I imagined.  Also the arched centers are no 
longer grafted on to flat centers (look closely at the 2005 centers).  
Instead it all seems to be one molded piece.  Regarding the edges 
catching on the centers-- I did also experience that, but only when 
the caps were still off.  Finally, one other difference is the 
manufacturing code is absent (i.e. M1005B imprinted on one corner cap).

BTW, the white DIY arched centers exist:

Hope they start selling the kits again soon.

Hello AGAIN

MIKE;  didn&#x27;t you tell me that you were going to start solving the
block on the right side? ? ?

BU&#x27;B&#x27; setup:

y RUR&#x27; is fast
U M U (R&#x27;U2R)
I know that this is longer, but It does allow you to keep that grip on
B1.  If this were my last pair, I would probably use the 1st sequence
, leaving F2B on F and B.


MY QUESTION;  IF YOU use COLL or CLL (like mike and i do
respectively), does it really matter if F2B are on L and R?

I see why this would matter if you used CMLL... like Thom.
And I defenitely see why you&#x27;d want F2B on L/R for step 4.

Right now I only have a handful of CLL cases down (maybe 10)
2 of them involve a y rotation during the algorithm.
EX. (B&#x27;RBR) U2 (R&#x27;dRB).  

So should I just not worry about where F2B are at the end of step 2?

What is the quickest way to insert DRF corner if the Red facelet is<br>

<br>
(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)*3 is good for F2L, but too slow for F2B<br>
U (RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)*3 is also good, but not OPTIMAL.<br>

  would i be able to get yours for under $28 (including shipping?)

          <div class="email-content">No, this was a photo from twistypuzzles.com.  But I can see from the 
photo that the caps are identical to the 2006 black DIY caps (with the 
offset small tabs).  Ideally the perfect center would have arches but 
the old style caps (with the thick walls).  But that would consume 
more plastic, so I imagine they always look for ways to manufacture it 
for less.

Practice the F2L algs where the corner is permuted (oriented or

See where the edge and corner pair up.  Then go from there using the

If I place it last, it needs to come off the right face into the

What do you mean ugly? Are you talking about the picture with stickers

Right, you can&#x27;t be sure how much it will go for.
   
  But yes.. do the tiles really stick up like 3 inches above the thing? Geez..  Plus, I dont think I like the colors too much. If it&#x27;s a high quality puzzle, I won&#x27;t complain too much.. I&#x27;m just saying, I like the look of yours a lot more.. 
   
  the picture on mefferts.com is accurate?

          <div class="email-content">Daniel,

If I&#x27;m understanding you correctly, when solving the cross, you 
ensure that one of the corners is in the correct slot (permutated, 
not necessarily oriented).  Then, you leave this slot alone until 
the other 3 are solved.  Is this correct?  Then there are less algs 
to get into a VH LL.

Thanks.

pretty decent at cubing in high school and am now working on lowering<br>
my times.  My best average has been about 24.5 with a best time of<br>
17.99.  Anyway, I can&#x27;t seem to find a cube that is smooth and the<br>
stickers don&#x27;t come off quickly.  If someone could point me to a<br>
reliable speedcube, I&#x27;d really appreciate it.<br>

average F2L time is about 16-17 seconds and I&#x27;m not sure where to<br>
improve from here.  Suggestions for that would be great also.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Popping means that a small piece (cubie) of the cube/puzzle comes 
loose and falls out. Indeed it may really shoot out in some cases. 
With a fairly loose cube it&#x27;s sometimes possible to force such 
popping at will.

Have fun!

You may like x(RU&#x27;r2)U2(RU&#x27;r2)&#x27;x&#x27;.
But I still prefer (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)3 (no slow wrist moves).

  You have other options, such as the Petrus method ( http://lar5.com/cube/ ), which focuses on being most move efficient, or the Roux method ( http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html ) which sort of works from the sides in.. not sure.. dont really know much about that method except that the people who do it seem to like it. 

  There was a post recently (you can check the archives on the site) about a beginner method which some people in the group had been teaching and having success with.. maybe check that out.

          <div class="email-content">Hey, Tyler.  What college?  I live in Des Moines, so that&#x27;s pretty central.
If it&#x27;s not too far from there, maybe we could work out some sort of cube
meeting.

As far as a good cube, the rubiks.com DIY kits are generally recommended as
your best bet, but they are out of stock pretty often.  I got my best
speedcube from Wal-Mart, and have also worked a standard Target cube to be
great, so either of those should do you just fine, provided you&#x27;re willing
to break them in well before lubing.

For F2L, really work on understanding the algs you&#x27;ve learned, intuitive or
otherwise.  But mostly, concentrate on no delays. 
www.metronomeonline.comis a great tool for no pauses.  You might also
try Nate Christie&#x27;s F2L
triggers page.

OLL and PLL is alright, but all the cool kids use other systems. ;P

          <div class="email-content">Wow. I live on the edge of Johnston.  Definitely mention the next time
you&#x27;re heading home for a weekend.  The only other cubers I meet are people
explaining the finer points of sticker removal at work...

Also, definitely work on F2L more.  It&#x27;s easily twice as important as the
LL.  Even with a slow LL, a very good F2L will make your times acceptible.
Try the metronome thing!

www.geocities.com/cubiks_ruber

It&#x27;s bare bones right now, but will eventually hold everything there is a
page for, as well as a BLD page and some other random things.

In fact, the only part of it anywhere near done is the useful bit: the page
on the L5E.

If you have any tips for things like non-matching blocks, C(O)LL, or Roux
solving in general, fire away.  I need material.  If anyone is interested in
running some cases for ACube for VH style algs with the M slice free, let me
know, because I need them like crazy.

          <div class="email-content">My megaminx came yesterday!  Woohoo!  I&#x27;m completely stumped by the LL, but
what fun would it be if I worked it all out the first day?

I have no problem with the colors, but the tiles really do stick up that
high.  The picture may even make them look *thinner* than they are when you
get one in your hands.

Has anybody replaced the current tiles on the mefferts megaminx with the
thin tiles on cubesmith.com?  I&#x27;m afraid to try prying them off without
damaging the cubie [or is it minxie? ;-)] underneath.

          <div class="email-content">I like the Meffert&#x27;s tiles, but something tells me that Cubesmith 
lexan tiles would be awesome on a Megaminx.  I asked Chris L. about 
making some, and he said the only issue would be finding 12 colors of 
lexan.  So maybe that will be added to his product line eventually.

          <div class="email-content">You don&#x27;t HAVE to, but I&#x27;d say it isn&#x27;t the best practise, because
you&#x27;ve gotta get back sometime, anyway.

So I&#x27;d do it before the corners so you get longer time looking at the
case.

After I make the first block though, I made sure I learnt so that I
did no rotations whatsoever (apart from going off at a tangent).

I&#x27;m currently reshuffling my step 2 and trying to find shortcuts. I&#x27;ve
been doing the 1x2x2 - pair and insert for a while now, and I&#x27;m
looking at some alternative things. I don&#x27;t really want to learn F2L
because I like being a pure roux solver :) but I might learn a few of
the tricky ones. It&#x27;s all pretty easy, anyway...

Starting to get really good recognition and execution on CMLL now.
Although, it&#x27;s slowing my non-mathcing block solving down because I
have to learn the new cases to recognise. GOnna learn that big 69
diagram table at some point....

Thanks, 

~Thom

The usual stuff... use softer springs with ground ends, add washers 
under the springs to protect the plastic and make it twist easier, 
adjust screws, flatten a few sharp edges inside (from imperfect 
molding), play with it for a while to wear it in, clean it, polish all 
inside surfaces with 100% silicone oil (i.e. apply with a little piece 
of towel wiping the inside surfaces), adjust screws better, play with 
it again for a while.

Cheers!
Stefan

I got mine here:
http://www.federnshop.com/

I bought a few hundred cause they become *a lot* cheaper then. I&#x27;m 
running out but I&#x27;m gonna buy more again soon, then I could also offer 
little kits for reasonable prices if someone is interested, for 
example for the meffert megaminx and rubik&#x27;s studio 3x3.

Cheers!
Stefan

Weird colour scheme, anyway. Green/blue next to each other. So green
is opposite white. I have a cube where the &#x27;opposite&#x27; colours are next
to each other so looking at both pics and then from the point of the
first one, it&#x27;d be;

F = Red
B = Yellow
U = Blue
D = Orange
L = Green
R = White

Which is similar, only on mine, orange is opposite white.

And I can see two sets of two pieces that are the same.

Fun.

          <div class="email-content">So how many things are actualy wrong with it?

I can see two yellow white edges and two red green blue corners.  You can
tell by the corner in the UFL position that either B or L is white, and by
the corner in the DFR position that either B or D is white (unless that&#x27;s
orange), so then the yellow face on the solved cube should be white.  Five
edges have a yellow sticker.  Is there anything else?

   <br>
  Anyways.. until recently, I used my entire hand to do basically all the moves.. very ineffective. Now, though, I&#x27;im starting to work on using single fingers to do my moves, etc.<br>
   <br>
  My question is how long does it take until I get &quot;good&quot; at this? Furthremore, how would you recommend improving in this area? As of right now, I am just taking my time while doing my algs, and focusing on determining which finger is closest/easiest, etc. If I keep up with that (with no real &quot;method&quot;, just intuitive practice), will I get better?<br>

          <div class="email-content">No, I think the plastic pieces all look the same (well, that Tomy 
Megaminx has &quot;shorter&quot; corners, but my 6-color later Meffert&#x27;s don&#x27;t). 
But let me tell you in my experience the caps of the Megaminxes are 
most often not glued nearly as hard as for example the studio 3x3. 
Just take a thin blade and apply little force, maybe try several 
centers to find an easy one. Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Okay, you&#x27;ve inspired me to take it apart.  The one face is so loose 
I can literally just grab a corner and pull it out.  I see now why 
it&#x27;s so loose.  You know those two opposite posts on the spindle 
that have cylindrical posts?  That would be the top one in this 
photo:

http://tinyurl.com/bvruk

Well, it&#x27;s not screwed all the way in, evidently.  I can pull that 
center out very far compared to all the others:

http://tinyurl.com/7p887

The opposite face with the other cylindrical post barely pulls out 
at all.  So I assume those two faces should be balanced better on 
the screw depth.  The other ten centers that protrude from the 
rectangular posts seem fine-- about 1mm or so.

Now I&#x27;m off to get the pocket knife...

By the way, does your paper insert method work for keeping Megaminx 
center caps on?

Nice picture... reminds me just how beautiful Megaminx is :-)

> Now I&#x27;m off to get the pocket knife...

Good luck! I don&#x27;t see any glue on your pictures, that&#x27;s a good sign 
already. Let us know how far you got and how much force was necessary.

> By the way, does your paper insert method work for keeping Megaminx 
> center caps on?

I think so, but never tried it. Usually the caps stay on just like 
that without me doing anything. Also, the surrounding edges help keep 
it in place because of the angle between center and edges.

Cheers!
Stefan

exactly like them at first.  You may find that you want to change it a
little later.  I know that Dan Knights&#x27; page was helpful to me
initially, but I think it is no longer available.

As of right now, I am just taking my time while doing my algs, and focusing on determining which finger is closest/easiest, etc. If I keep up with that (with no real &quot;method&quot;, just intuitive practice), will I get better?

But still, that&#x27;s awesome.  How many people on this list have tried teaching
a kid to cube?  It seems like their minds would just soak it up, especially
since it&#x27;s so hands-on.

My son is only 2 years old, so it&#x27;s a while before I&#x27;ll be able to teach him
anything, but he just loves playing with the cube.

Yes the video is awesome!  Very cool to see someone that young solving
the cube!

I have started teaching my sister how to cube, she&#x27;s 5 and will be 6
this April.  She likes to help me scramble the cubes I am using when I
am practicing.  Usually she will scramble a bunch of them and ask me
to solve them one at a time.  What I&#x27;ve started doing is only with the
2x2x2 if she asks me to solve it I say that she has to solve one face
first (not one layer).  She is getting very quick at doing this, so
pretty soon I plan on moving up to saying she has to solve one layer
before I&#x27;ll solve the rest.

I really don&#x27;t know of a good way to teach kids to cube, but I figured
I would try this and see how it goes.

Another thing I do a lot with Jade is to scramble the cube (3x3x3)
three moves or so behind my back and have her unscramble it.  She&#x27;s
getting really good at doing these too, though ones with lots of
double turns like R2 U2 R2 still trip her up sometimes.  I try to give
her helpful hints and stuff though so she doesn&#x27;t get frustrated.

If anyone has any ideas of how to teach younger kids to cube please
share.  I&#x27;m totally winging this and just trying something and if it
doesn&#x27;t work scrapping it and trying something different.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">While solving a face seems like an obvious way to work up to solving a
layer, it doesn&#x27;t really help you to understand the cube, does it?  It seems
like solving a 1x2x2 corner or even a 1x2x3 block would be a better first
step.

Careful though... she might turn into a roux solver. ;-D

Except for the kid solving the cube.
I think I do like kids after all. :)

Hey Matt,

I decided to start with the 2x2x2 first though (since it&#x27;s her
favorite of the cubes), which doesn&#x27;t allow for anything fancier than
maybe a 2x1x1 block or something.

The problem I&#x27;ve found is that when it comes to attention span for
little kids you can&#x27;t throw a lot at them at once.  So I figured I
would start small.  Plus for a 2x2x2 solving one face is contained in
solving one layer (or can be contained if you use the same steps every
time, the same idea as teaching a beginner a method for solving the
cross).

Also I was pretty late to develop abstract thinking, and I&#x27;m not
saying she will be too, but I&#x27;ve read about mathematical reasoning and
development in kids and most agree that starting early with abstract
tasks can help kids to develop abstract thinking sooner, but up until
a certain age they don&#x27;t have that type of thinking yet.

I don&#x27;t want to throw too much out at once, since she seems to be
interested and I don&#x27;t want to overwhelm her and scare her away.  I
figured small steps and lots of fun puzzles (undo 3-4 turns scrambles)
to make it also a fun way to hang out would be my approach, though I
am open to any suggestions too.

I&#x27;m not used to teaching kids how to do hard tasks like this, so I&#x27;m
still figuring out what to do as well.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s interesting... the 2x2x2 is my least favorite cube.  Every twist
affects half of the cube!  That&#x27;s too disorienting to me.  At least with
bigger cubes, most of the cube stays stationary while I&#x27;m twisting one
face/slice.

But then again, I never developed a good approach for the 2x2x2.  I just
piece together the bottom layer and then use a few OLL and PLL algorithms (T
perm and Y perm, I think) to fix the top.  It&#x27;s horribly inefficient, but I
don&#x27;t really care since nobody is ever impressed that I can solve it anyway.

30 secs??? My best after 10 minutes was 16.884 secs. But I claim 
playing with trackpad sucks and I&#x27;d be better with a mouse. What&#x27;s 
your record?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Roger,

You might want to try: http://www.cubestation.co.uk/ (click on the 
F2L link on the left side).

And remember: Try to understand how the algorithms work! In some 
cases, if the other F2L pieces are not solved yet, the &#x27;standard&#x27; 
F2L algorithms are not optimal: you can try to find your own 
shortcuts if you understand how the F2L system works. Good luck...!

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Joel.

Right now, when I&#x27;m solving my cross and proceeding to pairing the 
corner/edges, I&#x27;m very slow in finding the necessary pieces around 
the cube.  Does this come with time or are there other tricks I&#x27;m 
missing.

Thanks!

          <div class="email-content">I think this website is pretty good for teaching f2l:

http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01.shtml

it helps you realize what goes into actually doing the f2l rather than
just mindlessly doing it. hopefully it helps.

What&#x27;s the metronome thing?  I&#x27;ve heard several times that going

www.cubesmith.com for all of your sticker needs.  Beats the pants off
Rubik&#x27;s in selection, price, shipping, and durability.

As a good practice tool, use a metronome to choose a slow beat.  Then, force
yourself to do 1 move per beat, and not pause.  Work up to the best speed
you can without any pauses.

I went to school in Johnston, where did you go?


I went to Newton, but most of my family is from Des Moines, and I live there
currently.  When did you graduate?  I&#x27;m class of 2003.

          <div class="email-content">This is very normal.. I remember how hard F2L was for me, when I 
began learning it... F2L is a system that takes quite a lot of time 
to master.. But once you get the hang of it, it allows you to do the

Furthremore, how would you recommend improving in this area? As of
right now, I am just taking my time while doing my algs, and focusing
on determining which finger is closest/easiest, etc. If I keep up with
that (with no real &quot;method&quot;, just intuitive practice), will I get better?

          <div class="email-content">Nathan Christie has some good video clips of various triggers here:

I like these because each video starts slow then speeds up, so you 
can put it on repeat and follow along to practice.  Cool background 
music, too :)

ago.  I graduated 2004, sophomore at U of I now, majoring in math
stuff.  So I just ordered the set of tiles for 4.50 from that site, or
would you recommend the plain stickers from them?  And then I should
get the DIY cube with only the cube (no stickers) from rubiks.com?

          <div class="email-content">Well the corner caps are different.  They don&#x27;t extend all the way 
to the foot anymore.  In the second photo you can see a thin black 
gap (less than 1mm) at the edge of the foot.  On the old DIY kits 
(and 25th Anniv. cubes) the center cap was often &quot;welded&quot; to the 
foot, leaving a tab of plastic that required sanding or filing for 
smooth consistent turning.  These new ones evidently avoid that 
problem.  All 8 corners are perfect out of the box.

And yes, both the edges and corners have thinner walls.  This 
results in the hollow side of the edge catching on the top of the 
center, prior to installing the center caps.  I was a little worried 
about this, but once the caps are on, everything works great.  Also 
the caps stay on easily using your paper insert method.  These caps 
are very much superior to the old DIY center caps, and have a better 
fit.  I&#x27;ll try to get a good photo of the centers posted.

After tightening, the center did not pull out as far.  So presumably 
this would benefit from one of your proposed spring/washer kits?

<br>
So I joined the track team this year.  There&#x27;s an event that runners <br>
like to do.  It&#x27;s called the beer mile and you can find information at <br>
www.beermile.com.  I was wondering what people thought they could do <br>
for a &quot;Cube Mile.&quot;  It&#x27;s the same thing, except in place of drinking a <br>
beer, you solve a cube.  I think towards the end of the season, I could <br>
probably break 6-minutes on the cube mile.  Is anyone up for this?<br>
<br>
So yeah, the rules go, (solve a cube, run a lap) times 4.  The first <br>
lap, you have to start at the mile start line, so you get those extra 9 <br>
meters in on a standard track.  You may solve the cube between the mile <br>
start line and the finish line.  Actually, 6-minutes is probably really <br>
hard.  I know I could definitely do it in 6:20.<br>

Any tips on what to do so that I can start running better? (the main

If you&#x27;re breathing really really hard, then you&#x27;re going too fast.  
Slow down, and run longer instead.

The 42 cube marathon...what do you do if you don&#x27;t have another cuber
to scramble cubes??? Cuz most non-cubers take forever to scramble cubes...

And where did the number 42 come from??? 

And go Brent Morgan...I say less than 20 hours...

I&#x27;ve wanted to do a lot of the UWR, but can&#x27;t cuz I have no fellow
cubers around...

P.S.  Isn&#x27;t it actually because there are 42 kilometers in a marathon?

          <div class="email-content">Yes, the manufacturer does grind them somewhat. Similar to the springs 
in the 3x3 DIY. To improve it one could use sandpaper or a dremel (I 
do use a cheap clone). But whether it&#x27;s good to have it 100% flat is 
not sure. For the current Meffert Megaminx I don&#x27;t, cause I put six 
washers in there anyway and they&#x27;re metal so there&#x27;s no point in 
making them extra flat.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Well, just as long as one does not hold the F face too tightly in the left 
hand grip, one can do F and F&#x27; turns by using the right hand index finger 
and thumb, respectively, to flick the F face.  Cases 10 and 21 at 
http://www.cubewhiz.com/pll.html are good examples of algorithms that only 
use R, U, and F turns where the left hand grip stays the same throughout.

   Subject: [Speed cubing group] 42 Cube Marathon


   What are the rules for the 42 cube Marathon?  Do you just add up solve
   times for 42 consecutive cubes?  Do you preinspect?

     Someone in the WC1982 mov said something about a 42 cube marathon in
   15 minutes.  Thats 21.43sec/cube.   Where did this category come from?
   And did 42 come from Douglas Adams&#x27; book?

   Jason


&quot;&quot;

So you&#x27;re not the only one who thought that...   :)
I still like to think that the cube marathon is based on 42.  A
marathon is like 26 miles...  What the hell is a kilometer anyway?  

just kidding..

That book is one of my favorites, and the movie&#x27;s good too...
They preserved the english accents from the original BCC shorts.

Jason K


PS  How many people here know what a Ford Prefect is ?
PPS isn&#x27;t DEep Cube named after deep thought?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
Please respond to these e-mails in the Caltech group.  It&#x27;ll be easier <br>
for me to keep track of the discussion.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to do a three day US National competition this year with the <br>
first day being optional.  Basically, here&#x27;s the idea:<br>
<br>
Day 1 — Get together, a couple preliminary rounds, just hang out etc.<br>
Day 2 — All preliminary rounds<br>
Day 3 — All final rounds<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to do it in a manner such that if someone cannot make the <br>
first day, it won&#x27;t affect their participation in the competition <br>
whatsoever.  Anyway, I&#x27;m looking at August 18, 19, and 20.  Any <br>
opinions on this?  Unfortunately, I see that some colleges will have <br>
started by then, but hopefully not too many.<br>
<br>
When responding to the practicality and convenience of these dates, <br>
general terms are always appreciated as opposed to individual <br>
preferences, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind hearing individual preferences.  Just <br>
understand that I can&#x27;t honor all individual requests.<br>
<br>
Would people object to something in the middle of the week such as <br>
August 7, 8, 9?  I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s probably not as good.  We can <br>
probably get by on a two day competition if it were just August 5 and <br>
6.  August 5 and 6 are looking pretty nice right now actually.<br>
<br>
Comments?  Please comment in the Caltech group.<br>

I went to wikipedia.org, to check the marathon thing.  Todays feature
article (on the main page) is about Douglas Adams!  Still its obvious
that a 42 cube &quot;marathon&quot; is based on Kilometers in a marathon.

However
 It Turns out that Deep Blue actually was based on Deep thought from
Hitchhiker&#x27;s guide.  In fact, the predecessor to Deep Blue was called
deep Thought.  in the book, Deep thought was the computer that spit
out 42.

here&#x27;s the link

Hi Joel,

thanks, nice to see some more pictures of what was going on when I was 
not yet there. But hey, &quot;Maybe WCA should recognise female cubing 
records&quot;??? Have a look at http://www.nascarjon.us/02.05.06.htm and 
you&#x27;ll see there&#x27;s no need for it :-)

I also watched your average video. I think your start is illegal 
(fingers not on the sensors but in front of them).

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

I have seen Casey&#x27;s results already... :).. But I was just joking 
around, of course.

On the first generation stackmat, I did not have any problems in 
competitions, and I don&#x27;t think there ever was a clear rule about 
how to start (well, not about where to put your hands on the 
timer)... So this is just the way I start :p. Judges never had a 
problem with the way I start in competition, and the way I do it 
when I am at home should be correct if I want to send my records to 
the UWR list. (Because timing with JNetCube (starting with hands 
flat on the table) is also allowed).

Cyou!

Joël.

That&#x27;s cause the judges don&#x27;t know better :-). But you&#x27;ll be in 
trouble if Ron judges you. Well, I guess he&#x27;d just tell you before the 
solve to pull your hands backwards if you started like that.

For the cubes it&#x27;s less important I guess, but for Rubik&#x27;s Magic it 
matters quite a bit, cause picking up the puzzle is a large part of 
the total time. I just say this because the Magic is the reason I 
discussed this with Ron a bit more in detail, but the idea is of 
course valid for all puzzles.

I agree the rules text can be misunderstood. The &quot;fingers touching the 
sensors&quot; means the fingers, not the palm, should be on the sensors. 
This is both for start and end of the solve. Maybe we should just have 
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; pictures in the rules for this, like we have for 
misalignments?

I hope you didn&#x27;t understand it as a mean accusation, it was just 
meant as a warning. I also warned Quinn about it when I saw his Magic 
videos a while ago, so he could practice the legal way. Later Ron was 
his judge for his Magic world record and told him his ending was close 
to illegal (somewhat the middles of his hands stopped the timer I 
think) but alright. So just be aware :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Clarification: this does *not* mean I have something against Quinn&#x27;s 
record, I just meant to say I&#x27;m not dreaming this and Ron is looking 
for it :-)

Here&#x27;s another example that I asked Ron about a while ago:

          <div class="email-content">The caps are glued on, and probably not very easy to remove.  Even if 
you could, it would be useless since the 25th Anniv. centers are 
fastened with rivets (not screws).  So if the cube is too loose, there 
is nothing you can do.  If it&#x27;s tight, just break it in real good by 
using it a lot, and it might turn out okay.  Two of my best cubes are 
anniv. cubes that started out really stiff but became very nice with 
use.

Otherwise, you should get a DIY kit from rubiks.com if you want to 
tune the cube.  The new 2006 ones are all-new manufacture and superior 
(in my opinion) to the 25th anniv. cubes.

This is how they look like so I claim you can push them in deeper:

Hmmm... good point.  I haven&#x27;t actually tried that yet.  I have a 
really loose one that I should try that on.

No. Also, I&#x27;d like to add that this is a rivet I got with one of the 
older DIY kits. I&#x27;m actually only assuming it&#x27;s the same they use in 
normal store cubes. I am not able to get the rivets out of a cube 
(without destroying the kernel).

Cheers!

there are questions like this almost daily here, and i<br>

          <div class="email-content">i can memorize pretty well, i knocked off 10 F2L algorithms today 
and now im just doing lots and lots of solves to get practice and 
inbed them deeper, I learn them usually by a combination of pattern 
tricks like &#x27;prime prime normal prime prime&#x27; or whatever and just 
muscle memory and flow. Any algorithm that i really know theres no 
way i can repeat out the notation to it, its all just the motion of 
my hands and seeing stuff fall in the right way. Now i know i cant 
do 10 a day becuase if I over do it then i&#x27;ll start to loose some 
that i learned at the beginning. Im sure once i get to the LL things 
will slow a bit because i will have to change most of my meathod. 
With the F2L ones its just an addition to my current simple method. 
Thanks for the insight guys.

then learned PLL and then OLL. 
so just wondering... why would one start with the one

actually, my F2L really sucks currently :p really need

and what&#x27;s that prime prime normal prime prime trick
you use? tricks for recognition are nice i guess.

          <div class="email-content">I started with F2L because I think i have the most to gain there, I 
average about 15 sec for the LL so that makes it about 30 for F2L. 
My LL is also a lot more consistant. As far as my memorizing tricks 
goes, for some reason if i auduably remember the turn direction it 
triggers the correct face in my head, so i just think that part and 
the hands do the rest. eventually there is no thinking at all like 
the ones iv been using for a year or more. I tend to have bouts of 
commitment and try to start learning and give up. this time im 
really commited to at least get F2L done and then i can do LL later.

Go steal some plutonium and grin into the observation camera, then 
when they go through the list of students they&#x27;ll skip you cause they 
know you look different.

It reminds me of the &quot;sawing the lady in half&quot; trick. ;)

How about doing a &quot;photofit&quot; cube -- i.e., one where can you manipulate 
the puzzle to make a face that vaguely resembles your favourite 
cuber/politician/serial killer?

Is that your Valentine&#x27;s Day present for her? Hmm, why not make the 
two parts of the same picture lign up? Actually... why not make all 
six faces be parts of one large image, e.g. a straight line of four 
faces being the body of a cuber and then two sidewards for the spread 
arms? I tell you why not: cause I&#x27;ve been spending the last half an 
hour searching for such a pic and didn&#x27;t find one except this one and 
I find her ugly:

&quot;Breaking Dawn was an official selection of the Hollywood Film

Hasbro&#x27;s Rubiks Cube.&quot;

          <div class="email-content">I haven&#x27;t seen the film, so I don&#x27;t understand the connection to 
Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  Therefore I don&#x27;t know why Hasbro would sponsor the 
party.  Reading the reviews of the film, it apparently has a 
complicated plot, so maybe there is some kind of cube analogy there.

Anyone seen it?

          <div class="email-content">I have been practicing making a white/orange 4x3x1 block 1.  Then I
make the yellow/orange block on the opposite side.  Finish up with
CLL.  Kind of like Roux steps 1, 2 , and 3.  

You end up with most of the white and yellow layers finished. 
2 centers, 6 edges, and all 8 corners.  assembled, oriented, and
permuted. 

 I can avg just under a minute for these steps, but I can cut that
down to 45 with practice.  I think that a 30-35sec avg is possible for
these steps with lots and lots of practice.

ANYWAY, I am also interested in learning other methods of solving the
4x4.  I would like to learn the cage method, and M. Akimoto&#x27;s 4x4
method.  There is also a 4x4 method in Waterman&#x27;s booklet, I believe.

Does anyone know a good place to get center moving algs?

I also do two 1x2x3 blocks on L and R, then corners.  Then I pair up the M
and U edges, fixing the OLL parity if it&#x27;s there.  Then I place them and
solve PLL parity, it it&#x27;s there.  After that, you only have the 4 M centers
to fix.

For two blocks and corners, I average something like 48 seconds, but this is
literally the first time I&#x27;ve tried to solve my 4x4 in months.  A good first
two blocks and corners should approach 30 to 35 seconds.

ANYWAY, I am also interested in learning other methods of solving the

I think there is possibly some merit in trying to find a way to directly
place M and U edges in this method.  Doing it in two substeps this way can
be fast, but leads to a lot of half turns and awkward cases.  Perhaps there
is a way to place certain edges, and know a couple of short algs to flip
edges to handle parity.  As is, parity adds at least 4 seconds to a solve,
doing nothing other than flipping edges.  There has to be a nicer way to
accomplish more and faster.

Does anyone know a good place to get center moving algs?


r&#x27; d r U2 r&#x27; d&#x27; r U2

You can build any type of adjacent two swap alg that way.  For block swaps,
you can use a similar principle:

r&#x27; E r U2 r&#x27; E&#x27; r U2

For opposite edges, try M d2 M&#x27; U&#x27; M d2 M&#x27; U, and for opposite edge blocks,
try (r2 u2)*2.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll let Per go into details on this one...but...

I learned a very similar method from him...I modified it
slightly...and I only use it for 5x5...I do:

1. Solve White Center
2. Solve Yellow center
3. Solve White edges
4. Solve White corners
5. Solve middle edges
6. Solve last 4 centers
7. Solve yellow corners
8. Solve yellow edges...

yes you do sometimes get parity...but this method takes VERY few algs...

Per does something like (don&#x27;t take my word on this)

1. Solve white edges
2. Solve white corners
3. Solve middle layer edges
4. Solve yellow corners
5. Solve yellow edges
6. Solve all centers...

I think mine allows for more freedom, but his is apparently faster?!?!
 The reason I do white and yellow centers first is because it allows
much more freedom...And Per&#x27;s parity fix messes up his centers...

3. solve the top layer edges
4. solve the middle layer edges
5. solve bottom layer cornors
6. solve bottomlayer edges
7. solve the remaining centers
          Is it cage method ? Is anyone following the above method? If so what is the best timing ? won&#x27;t we get pairity in this method ?
            Before trying, I like to get your expert opinion. Plz share your experiences with this method.

          <div class="email-content">If you mean &quot;is a wiki&quot; and &quot;contains some information about speedcubing&quot;,
then yes, like that.  But there&#x27;s unnecessary overhead in maintaining the

slow.

I was about to namedrop but I can&#x27;t seem to access my own site at the
moment. :S Can you get on it?

Also, you should be able to use wiki.snkenjoi.com.

Should. In the same way that I should be able to get on the main site.


Off on a tangent: I lost my cube today, my only cube. Hopefully I
should be getting a donation soon though :). So I&#x27;ve been working on
4x4x4 blindsolving with your edges method, stefan. It&#x27;s fun.

  That&#x27;s a brilliant idea. Something I could probably post some competitive times on too, I&#x27;d hope. I&#x27;ve run cross country for four years now, and I&#x27;m doing long distance track this semester. Although I&#x27;m probably quite a bit slower than you guys at solving the cube (anywhere from 30-40 seconds) I think I could make up for it in running.
   
  If I go out and do it sometime, could there be a unofficial section on speedcubing.com for the &quot;Cube Mile&quot;?

  Hey Everyone,

So I joined the track team this year.  There&#x27;s an event that runners 
like to do.  It&#x27;s called the beer mile and you can find information at 
www.beermile.com.  I was wondering what people thought they could do 
for a &quot;Cube Mile.&quot;  It&#x27;s the same thing, except in place of drinking a 
beer, you solve a cube.  I think towards the end of the season, I could 
probably break 6-minutes on the cube mile.  Is anyone up for this?

So yeah, the rules go, (solve a cube, run a lap) times 4.  The first 
lap, you have to start at the mile start line, so you get those extra 9 
meters in on a standard track.  You may solve the cube between the mile 
start line and the finish line.  Actually, 6-minutes is probably really 
hard.  I know I could definitely do it in 6:20.

page... just take a look at the stuff people invented<br>
over the years...<br>
<br>
since we&#x27;re talking about new unofficial categories,<br>
maybe macky could try juggling 3 scrambled cubes, then<br>
switch to juggling 2 while solving the 3rd, repeat<br>
till all are solved... while hopping on 1 leg, singing<br>
a britney spears song...<br>

          <div class="email-content">the way i solve it is pretty straightforward...
1. solve all centers
2. solve all edges
3. solve the remaining 3x3x3 cube (using fridrich)
4. say nasty words because you got parity again

I just did a 2m 1.39s sec using this method (new PB),
but I&#x27;m not very used to the 4x4x4 yet and most of the
time I do 3-look instead of just OLL PLL.

what is the method all you sub 1m 30s cubers use?

That&#x27;s awesome!  Let&#x27;s totally do this.  I&#x27;m not the best runner, but I 
would have the cube time to make up for it, so we might be very close.  
How fast do you think you can run your 400s?  I actually am kind of 
doubtful you could make up your cubing time against me by running.  I 
average around 17 to 20 so let&#x27;s say if I do 20 second solves for the 
cube mile, and I run 72 second 400s, the total per lap is 92 seconds.  
If you solve the cube in 35 seconds on average, 92 - 35 is 57 
seconds... which is pretty quick.  What&#x27;s your mile time?

Well, each of these should be feasible, just not together. I&#x27;ll 
definitely try it blindfolded as soon as I get one, but I won&#x27;t try 
underwater or with feet, both of these would probably harm the cube.

Cheers!

Revenge. I wrote his solution on a piece of paper and memorized it

My best time is like 4 min, I think it could be fast since there&#x27;s
never a pairity issue and there&#x27;s no solve like 3x3x3 step.

Hmmm ... five hours southwest of Dallas sounds pretty close to San 
Antonio. I grew up in San Antonio, went to Keystone School from 5th -
 12th grade and taught myself to cube in my freshman year.

This was way back in 1980/1981, back when you solved Layer-By-Layer, 
turned with your whole hand, and didn&#x27;t lube up the cubes.

Back in the olden days, when there wasn&#x27;t an Internet, you couldn&#x27;t 
Google &quot;rubik&#x27;s cube solution&quot; or visit speedsolving bulletin 
boards, and there were only a couple cube books in the bookstore and 
you were lucky to find them after checking all the bookstores in 
town (when your parents would drive you there).

Back in the olden days, when if you broke a minute with a lucky 
solve you were ecstatic. Rubik&#x27;s Cube contests were &quot;1 run, no pre-
inspection, everyone goes at once, drag race&quot; competitions and the 
winners had times like 68 seconds.

Back in the olden days, when &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible&quot; would show people 
who could solve in 30 or 40 (or even 22.85) seconds and you&#x27;d 
say &quot;Oh My God! How, How, HOW did they do that?!?!?&quot;

You young whippersnappers have it easy :-)

          <div class="email-content">Ah yes, the olden days... I remember them like it was yesterday...<br>
<br>
&gt; This was way back in 1980/1981, back when you solved Layer-By-<br>
Layer, <br>
<br>
Yep, that&#x27;s how I started.  I somehow managed to win first place in <br>
the Peoria, Illinois Ideal Cube-A-Thon (as they were called then) <br>
using nothing but the &quot;keystone&quot; method for the F2L and my cousin&#x27;s <br>
algorithms (see http://tinyurl.com/7o8rt for my original cheat <br>
sheet!)  My 1st place time was 48 seconds!  I later switched to Minh <br>
Thai&#x27;s corners-first method, and have only recently gone back to <br>
trying my hand at LBL.<br>
<br>
&gt; turned with your whole hand, and didn&#x27;t lube up the cubes.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I actually won that first contest with a cheap &quot;Wonderful <br>
Puzzler&quot; clone cube.  No lube, no nothing.  We did have &quot;The Real <br>
Solution&quot; replacement stickers instead of Cubesmith, although you <br>
didn&#x27;t need them back then because the stickers were vinyl to begin <br>
with (even the cheap models).<br>
<br>
&gt; solve you were ecstatic. Rubik&#x27;s Cube contests were &quot;1 run, no pre-<br>
&gt; inspection, everyone goes at once, drag race&quot; competitions and the <br>
&gt; winners had times like 68 seconds.<br>
<br>
I actually liked this format.  There&#x27;s something more dramatic about <br>
watching every solver start simultaneously.  I think they even <br>
played music.  It&#x27;s also obvious who wins (whoever puts their solved <br>
cube down first).  For the competitor, it adds an element of <br>
excitement because you are truly &quot;racing&quot; instead of just setting <br>
times.<br>
<br>
Speaking of times, I think all of us back then would have found the <br>
notion of sub-20 averages positively preposterous!<br>

Try it-- it&#x27;s a lot of fun!  You can win free stickers, even if you&#x27;re

The self-solving cubes offered on eBay are different from those used and 
can easily be recognized as fake cubes. In the clip we see that he uses 
real cubes and we can also see that he is is using the trick described 
earlier by me. He does i very good though.

Again, I&#x27;m really sorry if I was rude.

I think the centers first solution is better, but if you&#x27;re not very

          <em>From:</em> d_funny007 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>

          <em>Date:</em> Thu, 16 Feb 2006 23:33:24 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
A few days ago ChrisH asked me for some quesitons about the exact <br>
edge distributions for the 4x4. I&#x27;d like to report my findings here.<br>
<br>
Due to the rather technical nature of how I obtained these number <br>
(quadruple nested summations and products)..., I omit the details. <br>
Besides I don&#x27;t want to ruin it for ppl who&#x27;d like to solve this <br>
problem on their own.<br>
<br>
For the 3x3, the cross *exact *probabilities on a random cube is:<br>
0    84.43%           160489/190080<br>
1    14.51%           6893/47520<br>
2    1.03%            65/6336<br>
3    0.046%           17/47520<br>
4    (5.26*10^-4)%    1/190080<br>
<br>
For the 4x4, the chances of getting a specific number of solved <br>
edges on a random scramble or after doing centers randomly is:<br>
0    59.38%<br>
1    30.92%<br>
2    8.08%<br>
3    1.41%<br>
4    0.186%<br>
5    0.0198%<br>
6    etc.....<br>
7<br>
8<br>
9<br>
10<br>
11<br>
12<br>
<br>
For the 5x5, .... well you get the idea...<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok it&#x27;s better if you just look at the following pages if you are <br>
intersted in this discrete distribution:<br>
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/3x3_ExactCross.jpg<br>
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/4x4_EdgePairs.jpg<br>
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/5x5_EdgePairs.jpg<br>
<br>
That is Mathematica code, btw (but those functions are certainly not <br>
built in, lol).<br>
<br>
These took me several hours to figure out, the 5x5 probabilites <br>
where based on the other two and easily found after I figured out <br>
the cross stuff...<br>
<br>
Everything adds to 1, so it checks out. I also matched the numbers <br>
to doing it by case count for some base cases so I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s <br>
correct.<br>
<br>
In case you&#x27;re interested there is a great deal of probability <br>
theory involved and what Chris showed me: Inclusion-Exculsion <br>
Principle. Also I had to resort to what I would call &quot;the Theory of <br>
Highly-Generalized Partial-Derangments&quot; (lots of Subfactorials <br>
involved and most math ppl don&#x27;t even know what that is).<br>
<br>
I can show you how I setup the summations if soneone&#x27;s interested. <br>
Plus I can generalized it to NxNxN cubes.<br>
<br>
Tell me if someone already did this, I&#x27;d like to know if I was the <br>
first to bother doing this.<br>

Take the final round competitors, put them through their 5 timing <br>
runs, then while you&#x27;re tabulating results, put them in a &quot;drag race&quot;: <br>
One scramble, no pre-inspection, all start at the same time, first <br>
solve wins. It could be a real crowd pleaser!<br>

&gt; &gt; solve you were ecstatic. Rubik&#x27;s Cube contests were &quot;1 run, no pre-<br>
&gt; &gt; inspection, everyone goes at once, drag race&quot; competitions and the <br>
&gt; &gt; winners had times like 68 seconds.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I actually liked this format.  There&#x27;s something more dramatic about <br>
&gt; watching every solver start simultaneously.  I think they even <br>
&gt; played music.  It&#x27;s also obvious who wins (whoever puts their solved <br>
&gt; cube down first).  For the competitor, it adds an element of <br>
&gt; excitement because you are truly &quot;racing&quot; instead of just setting <br>
&gt; times.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Tyson,

I&#x27;m in Dallas (actually Garland and work in downtown Dallas), but 
probably can&#x27;t help with what you want.  I do a layer solve (see RE 
Dallas &quot;Old School&quot;) and avg 40-45 sec.  I also have a beginner layer 
method that I teach that has only 5 total alg&#x27;s, from layer 2 to 
completion (no inverse etc.) that a beginner can learn and memorize 
in one day (probable avg solve would be around 90 sec, because 
although only 5 total alg for layer 2 and top, they may have to 
repeat the same alg a couple of times for each step).  Yes, not 
efficient, but can be memorized easily in a couple of hours.

Currently trying to learn Fridich/CFOP (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL), but don&#x27;t 
know enough to really teach it...still trying to learn/memorize 
myself.

Like I said, probably not what you are looking for, but let me know 
if I can help out.

Brent

  You shouldn&#x27;t be emailing him to order stickers,  you should be paypaling... unless you have some circumstance, of course, which complicates things.

          <div class="email-content">I agree about the no pre-inspection.  Everyone knows a large part of 
getting your times down is fast recognition or pre-recognition during 
the solve to minimize the times between algorithms, but we currently 
let everyone have 15 seconds to pre-inspect (isn&#x27;t that like 
subtracting a portion of the overall solve time).  

My best single solve, &quot;non-lucky&quot; was 24 sec back in 1983...just 
wondering what it would have been with pre-inspection.

Anyone have thoughts on pre-inspection vs no pre-inspection?

I also like the idea of a head to head, &quot;exibition&quot; for the final 
round competitors, as a time filler...it was more exciting for the 
spectators back then...

If you check the world records there is a separate record for No-
inspection...Some people (mainly non-cubers) think the inspection is 
stupid for 1 of 2 reasons...1:They think it is cheating or 2:The 
don&#x27;t see what you are looking for...So I think the inspection is a 
good thing and if you are hosting a competition and want to do a 
round with no-inspection then go ahead...the Swedish Competitions 
always have them...these competitions probably have the most events

Oh, did you notice the added note? It says:
&quot;** Tyson&#x27;s score sheet is being auctioned off with his approval.&quot;

Is that true?

outside (Now it&#x27;s 30-40 cm of snow which isn&#x27;t the best conditions for

á 72 seconds sounds quite hard to me, with only 20 seconds to catch my

By the way, what&#x27;s your best time for one lap (400 meters)?? I&#x27;ve done
57.8 but I&#x27;m not a runner, I&#x27;m a highjumper, so I think it&#x27;s a quite
good time.

You have to run 400m and solve the cube. You have the option to solve the cub before or during the running (or after the running if you like, but it looks stupid).

I&#x27;m definitely still around.  My &quot;real&quot; job and family keep me very 
busy. So if I missed your email I apologize.  Did you send it to 
chris@cubesmith.com ?

As mentioned by others here the best way to order is with paypal or 
you can mail a payment also.  The details are on my site.

Thanks
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Ok so I&#x27;ve been trying to do this for a long time, and I&#x27;m very happy<br>
to finally have done it!  I finally got a sub-20 average using a 4LLL!<br>
 I know others have already done this (I believe Macky and Lars V. and<br>
I know Dan Knights has done this, and probably others that I don&#x27;t<br>
know about).  So again I&#x27;m not the first by a long shot, but it feels<br>
good to also have done it :-)<br>
<br>
18.24, 19.38, 19.19, (17.56), 19.57, 20.33, 21.60, 23.96, (24.88),<br>
18.03, 17.90, 20.41 = 19.86<br>
<br>
Basically I like to do this as an F2L drill, you&#x27;re allowed to use any<br>
F2L tricks you know (including influencing the LL edges with the last<br>
pair, and no I didn&#x27;t use any ZBF2L).  For the LL I did<br>
<br>
1) orient edges<br>
2) orient corners<br>
3) permute corners<br>
4) permute edges<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t use any algs that permute 2 corners and also two edges, I did<br>
a quarter turn and then permuted corners first and edges second for<br>
those cases.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s fun to try, and feels really good to see your F2L times drop by<br>
trying to get faster this way!  Basically just think of it as a way to<br>
train your F2L.<br>
<br>
Give it a shot!  It&#x27;s fun!<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">In this version of the game, I would run and solve the cube at the same 
time.  In a 400, I am not physically fit enough to sprint all out so I 
could keep it at a pretty fast pace and still be able to move my 
fingers and solve the cube.  After I finish the cube, I could drop it 
and sprint the rest of the way.

3,601, Bob!

But in all seriousness, I&#x27;m certain he&#x27;s going to approach the 4,000 mark.
He&#x27;s doing abou 180 cubes/hour right now, and that would only require about
a 165 cube/hour pace from here out.  As he&#x27;s still going pretty strong, and
is used to doing averages of 500 or more frequently, I imagine he&#x27;ll keep up
a good speed for quite a while.  I&#x27;ll post a definite guess later.  It&#x27;s
handicapping to guess so early.

3,602, Mike! Just to minimize your chance to win the prize :-)

Oh, could someone please tell Brent I&#x27;ll share the prize with him if 
he stops after 3,602 solves? Thanks.

Good call! Even working in binary that still makes 1001110110000000 cubes.
Perhaps a base smaller than 2 is being used, e.g. base cbrt(Gamma^{-1}(1000)-1).

          <div class="email-content">For the guessing, I thought he was just doing 2000 as fast as he
could...not go for 24 hours and see how many he has solved...But if he
goes for the full 24 hours, I&#x27;d say...

24 hours: 3758

2000 Cubes: 14 hours 21 minutes

See how accurate these guesses are when we roll around to the final
counts...

          <div class="email-content">All right, his average has dropped to ~118 cubes/hour after 11 
hours.  That would make 2,832 cubes in 24 hours at this pace.

          <div class="email-content">We&#x27;ve had some discussion about this before I think but I now have a sudoku <br>
cube given to me by my wife.  Its black plastic with number stickers and <br>
comes with a sudoku solution for each face (although I suspect there are <br>
many solutions subject to orientation).  Anyway not wanting to cheat by <br>
looking at the solution I&#x27;m still struggling to solve it!  The orientations <br>
of the corners look as though they should give a big clue to the intended <br>
solution - I guess its still a valid solution if the numbers work but aren&#x27;t <br>
oriented the right way.<br>
<br>
Anyway I haven&#x27;t seen any mention of one on the market so it was a bit of a <br>
surprise.  Anyone else seen any?<br>
<br>

PS Had a quick search before I pressed send and I find at least that hamleys <br>
in London do one called the Sudokube. Its different from mine but same <br>
principle<br>

Last night before the computer was there, I think there were 6 
scrambled cubes in line
Plus one being solved

Don&#x27;t take my word for it though...it was after midnight when I did 
the calculations

          <div class="email-content">Just bite the bullet, man.  I took mine apart and lubed them with the same
silicone spray I use on my 3x3x3 and they&#x27;re both excellent now.  Search
google for &quot;disassemble 4x4x4&quot; and &quot;disassemble 5x5x5&quot; to get directions for
how to safely take them apart and put them back together.

It took me about an hour to put my 5x5x5 back together, so I&#x27;d give yourself
some time.  But they both went from nearly unusable (both made my hands
really ache to even complete a single solve) to awesome.  It&#x27;s definitely
worth it.

Plus, the mechanism for the 4x4x4 is something you really have to see.  I
still have no idea how it works, but it&#x27;s very cool.

Go for it! It would be such a cool number to stop at 3456 ;-)
It&#x27;s such an easy number to remember and maybe someone else will 
have a chance to beat it :-P

But Brent, please keep the cube above the table surface so we know u 
are not simple exchanging with a solved cube there ... haha ...

Best regards,

I&#x27;m just assuming he can keep up with a roughly 30-second average 
given diminishing returns due to awareness and hand condition.

In English English the &quot;and&quot; would be there too, but not in US English. (Not sure about 
American in general (e.g. including Canada).

I think that guess came a bit late in the day!
I&#x27;m kind of curious, given the subject, why not go for 3142. Rounding off to 3 decimal 
places and multippying by 1000 would give 3142.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s such a great achievement. That gives ~27 seconds per cube, but
he didn&#x27;t use all 24 hours, did he?? So his speed must have been
higher than that. Impressive!!

          <div class="email-content">JNetCube works fine on a Mac and you can use it to enter times manually and it will just 
generate a new scramble each time and calculate your average. As with ACube, It also uses 
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) but that should be a standard package in Mac OS X. Is that 
what you use? I don&#x27;t know about OS 9 or earlier versions.

If you want to use ACube, you should open Terminal and change to the directory of 
ACube. Then type the following command:

java -cp ACube3.jar ACube

and off you go. You can also execute the included run.bat from the Terminal but you&#x27;ll 
have to edit it first and remove the trailing @ from the first line.

I hope this helps.

          <div class="email-content">True, though... I think most things &quot;pi&quot; related don&#x27;t usually round... 
gosh, what geeks are we debating the rounding of pi!  With &quot;pi&quot; day, 
it&#x27;s generally on March 14, at 1:59 PM, and well, I guess you could 
carry it out for more decimal places, and in this case as well, 
rounding makes no sense.

We actually had Brent do the F2L on the cube.  Given it&#x27;s a 7 step 
situation, it comes out to about .59... I think?  Eh... I&#x27;m not sure.

          <div class="email-content">We stopped at about 7 PM so he had an hour and a half left, but it&#x27;s 
really not an accurate of how much &quot;time&quot; he used.  He solved 2000 
cubes in about 12 hours and 6 minutes which should give you an idea of 
the rate he was going at for 12 hours... and that was pretty solid with 
only a couple of breaks.  After the 12 hour mark, exhaustion really 
started to play in and by noon the next day, his pace had slowed to 
maybe 100 an hour.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sure, though we could easily check the e-mail archive for the 
answer.  I was actually pretty surprised when people were guessing 4200 
(based on his beginning pace) and other things as well.  I&#x27;ve done this 
race called the KELROF where you have a team of 10 and each person runs 
a mile and you trade off relay style for 24 hours... and towards the 
middle hours, it really feels bad.  I mean... feels REALLY bad... so I 
think my guess would have been for about 3400 to 3500 cubes.

Brent could have done about 3500 to 3700 cubes if he had really wanted, 
but there is a certain amount of pain and discomfort that comes with 
all of this, and without the right motivation, it simply wasn&#x27;t going 
to happen.

Well, I&#x27;ve gone through the guesses, and it looks like the best 
guess (besides that of Tyson, who was right there when he made it) 
goes to...

Chris Pelley!

Well, it was his second out of three guesses, and it was retracted 
eleven minutes later...read.

So, with that in mind, let&#x27;s see who guessed just once and got it 
(almost) right.  And that award goes to...
Rune Wesström!

And, of course, we must mention Thom Kirjava, whose guess of 3458.5 
was the only non-whole number guess.  The actual result was 3141.59, 
so well done in making that guess.  Not the closest guess overall 
(Rune was closer by 1.5 cubes), but it definately deserves honorary 
mention.

Nice job Brent, I&#x27;d die after about 200 cubes.  Well done.  And nice 
job Chris, Thom, and Rune for their outstanding guesses.  And thanks 
to Tyson, Leyan, etc. for facilitating this event.

Pi day is also Albert Einstein&#x27;s birthday.  So you can say you share

Gosh, I knew it! We should&#x27;ve had two people &quot;racing&quot;. Seriously, 
wouldn&#x27;t that increase motivation?

Was it general exhaustion or mainly the hands? One fine day I&#x27;d like 
to try this as well. Gotta get a bit faster before that, though. But 
my hands seem to be alright with lots of cubing, back when I did a 
one-handed 4x4 average I was surprised people wrote in the single 
solve quote that their hands hurt after just one solve...

Oh, here&#x27;s my collection of snapshots including a few new ones:

I have nothing against Thom, but I wouldn´t say he was guessing. He just used a strategy (maybe influenced by a certain scoundrel): Saw my guess, added something and had won, had the right answer been anything between my guess and 3600.
I´m not that proud of my &quot;victory&quot;. It was all too easy to predict a result &lt;3500. Btw. it´s a pity that Brent couldn´t (wouldn´t) fulfil. A logarithmian extrapolation pointed on a value around 3450. On the other hand the road now lies open to a new record for a man with stamina and motivation. Maybe mr Pochmann will be the next?

I&#x27;m a new solver myself, but work on the cross first.  Then work on 
inserting corners and edges to solve the first 2 layers (F2L).  
Cubestation.co.uk  is a good site to start on.  On the left side of 
the webpage, there is a link for a beginner solution.

Ciao.

Most people hold the cross on the bottom the whole solve.  That 
includes making the cross.

Gah... then I&#x27;ll just build a robot who can scramble, verify, and 
count :-). Now *that* would be a cool thing. You&#x27;d throw a solved cube 
into its top, then it verifies the cube is solved and rejects if 
necessary, then it scrambles and spits it out on the bottom. It should 
have a buffer so you work with 2 or more cubes and don&#x27;t have to wait. 
And it counts the solved cubes, or even better, it transmits the solve 
times to a computer and saves that into a file. Whoa... I&#x27;d love to 
have such a thing.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, most people keep it on the D face, AKA &quot;D-Cross.&quot; That way, you
don&#x27;t have to flip the cube over and you can go straight to F2L etc.
not necessarily better.. depends on your own preference: e.g. Jean
Pons solves it on top.

>From Macky&#x27;s site:

Q5:
Will it really make a difference if I put the cross on the bottom /
left instead of on the top?
I don&#x27;t feel like throwing away the eight algorithms I memorized. :(
A5:
I use to do F2L with cross on U-face, but switched to D-face after
getting sub-35. And trust me, it really makes a big difference, as I
got a sub-30 average within a week after making that change.

Here are a the two big advantages of D-cross F2L in speedcubing:
1. You use a lot of U and R moves, which allows you to execute algs
quickly using FSC&#x27;s(Finger Short Cuts). For example, one alg in
U-cross F2L is FDF&#x27;, but using D-cross F2L, it can be done as RUR&#x27; in
about 0.3 second. ( ! ) Dan Knight&#x27;s Speedcubing Page has some good
FSC videos. See how Dan turns the cube using just one finger? That&#x27;s
what you will want to be doing if you want to average sub-20.

2. By using D-cross F2L, you can look for the second corner-edge pair
while you&#x27;re doing the first, third when doing the second and so on,
so that you can turn the whole F2L non-stop. It takes a lot of
practice to be able to do this, and I think it&#x27;s not too much to say
that this non-stop F2L is what separates sub-20 cubers from the rest.
Oh, and yeah, try turning the algs from www.speedcubing.com and then
you can learn the ones that you like.

One more thing: GO SLOWLY ON F2L! This is the best advice anyone can
give you.
If you go too fast, you won&#x27;t be able to see the next corner-edge
pair, so you&#x27;ll have to
stop and search for the next pair, which is definitely not a good
thing in speedcubing.

Do most people solve the cross on bottom from the start now? I
remember it being pretty rare in 2002-3.
