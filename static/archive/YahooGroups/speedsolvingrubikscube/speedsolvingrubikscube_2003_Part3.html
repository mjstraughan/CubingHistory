          <div class="email-content">In the run up to the World Championships, I had my first ever Luckiest Last Layer, that is to say after placing the 4th F2L pair, the entire LL was solved, hence so was the cube (give or take a U turn)<br>
<br>
Then this morning, I have had the next shortest LL case, not once, but twice! That is the T orientation (F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;) and then no Permutation. Is this a lot more likely to occur than a Luckiest Last Layer? For instance, I know that the chance of the LLL is something resembling 1/(216*72) (please correct me if this is wrong), and I also know the probability of the T-orientation is 1/54. Performing the T-orientation also executes the &quot;Arrow&quot; Permutation (Case 15 on my site) which has a probability of 1/18, so presumably for the 6 move LL to occur this has to be at the correct angle when executing the Orientation, which makes the probability 1/(18*4) = 1/72<br>
<br>
So does this make the probability of this particular 6 move LL 1/(54*72) ? Or am I completely wrong (Most likely, I&#x27;m no good at probability theory! Is there some conditional probability stuff going on here?)<br>
<br>
Food for thought! DanH :)<br>
<br>
Note: I realise that there are other 6 move LL&#x27;s concerning the P-shape Orientations, but for now I am only interested in this T-shape Orientation, because it is this case which appeared twice on my cube in a matter of a few solves.<br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s interesting what computers can do: <br>
H. Kociemba&#x27;s &quot;Cube Explorer&quot; found an 18 move sequence that is <br>
equivalent to the scramble algorithm that was used for the first <br>
round at the World Championships: <br>
F2 L2 B2 F2 R&#x27; U L2 R D&#x27; F&#x27; D2 R&#x27; F&#x27; D L&#x27; D L&#x27; F<br>
The program didn&#x27;t indicate that this was optimal, but it did say <br>
that 17 moves was a lower bound.<br>
<br>
By the way, I was super impressed with the interview I read on DanH&#x27;s <br>
web site. Before reading the article, the fewest moves challenge was <br>
a bit of a mystery. I can&#x27;t admit that the mystery is gone, but the <br>
wow-factor has increased!<br>

<br>
Yeah me again, Ive been busy today, just to let you all know that the Speedcuber Profiles Submission form on my website www.cubestation.co.uk is now WORKING and also is IMPROVED<br>
<br>
Thanks to my best friend and technical advisor Craig Vincent, I can now bring you an efficient way of creating/updating your profile, and also an additional feature. Now you can upload your Profile picture directly, by using the Upload box on the form.<br>
<br>
Many more improvements to come, im always working! (I shall also make an upload picture form for the Speedcuber Gallery in a minute or two, so you can upload pictures to the gallery directly also)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Simple solution to your 4 corners twisted problem: double-sune and 
bruno (R&#x27;U2R2UR2UR2U2R&#x27;). DanK/Mirek&#x27;s Z Perm is the way to go, look 
up DanK video on it... so you don&#x27;t end up getting a bad habit of 
the brute force alg.

I&#x27;m going through the same phase, teaching a friend of mine that&#x27;s 
at about 50s. (Just last night planning how to line up the next 8 
PLLs: he knew the 3 edge ones, so I gave him the T and Y to start 
off with... A and V might be the next step).

          <div class="email-content">I would like to suggest two slightly different algorithms for these cases,
then you can make a choice as which ones you like best.

For the &quot;double-sune&quot; case the fast and very easily remembered F (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;
R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) F&#x27; = F (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*3 F&#x27; is a nice algorithm. This is
what I think is an order-2 alg, so do it once and you get the case, do it
twice and you get back to where you started.

For the &quot;bruno&quot;, I would suggest the inverse of Doug&#x27;s algorithm, but this
time there isn&#x27;t that much to choose between them. But when performing R U2
R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R&#x27; - it can all be done in one fluid motion, as there is
more scope for using the left index finger to make the U&#x27; whilst the right
hand is working on the R2&#x27;s Once you get your left and right hands working
in time with each other, this alg can be very fast indeed. The R2 U2 R&#x27; at
the end is quite tough however.

Good Luck in learning them all!

          <div class="email-content">while i really enjoyed the wc2003 event, i&#x27;m happy to hear they are <br>
considering having speedstacks produce a custom rubik&#x27;s timer.  it <br>
sounds like a lot of people liked the cup-stacking timers, but i am <br>
glad to hear that more suitable timers are being considered.  the <br>
cup-stacking timers were better than just using a stopwatch though, <br>
as they provided a consistent framework for timing solutions.<br>
<br>
a couple problems i saw with the cup-stacking timers:<br>
<br>
1.  i saw several contestants push the yellow circles after they <br>
finished their solution and the timer kept running.  this may have <br>
been due to the solver not slapping the yellow spots correctly, but <br>
it happened often enough that i have a hard time believing that so <br>
many people were too unskilled to stop the timer properly.  <br>
<br>
2.  the cube was required to absorb a small impact (from dropping <br>
it) if you wanted to try to get your hands to the yellow spots as <br>
fast as possible.  this small impact can actually rotate the face of <br>
a really loose cube 1/8 turn thus causing your puzzle to be <br>
unsolved.  i saw this heppen to a couple of competitors.<br>

&gt; There is a very simple method that you can solve it with, but not <br>
&gt; quickly. It&#x27;s basically everyone&#x27;s method of solving big cubes. You <br>
&gt; first solve all the centers, then the edges, then only twist the <br>
&gt; outer layers and pretend it&#x27;s a big 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
Not quickly, eh?  That&#x27;s how I solve it, and I was able to take 3rd <br>
at the WC.  Granted, I didn&#x27;t break 3 minutes like Masayuki or David <br>
Wesley, but my personal best to date is 3:10, with a 3:23.97 <br>
average.  I have actually wondered, at times, if Masayuki would be <br>
even faster if he changed to my approach - his method seems to take <br>
quite a few more moves.  It may just be a matter of piece location <br>
time - his method may allow for fewer pauses.<br>
<br>
&gt; There&#x27;s also probably one here: <br>
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/ But I haven&#x27;t checked it <br>

For replacing your broken puzzles, you could go to <br>
http://shoppingcart.Mefferts.com .  I would recommend the EastSheen <br>
4x4x4 (mini-master), and they have several different pyraminx <br>
options.  Note: the fabric side of the textured pyraminx balls up and <br>
pulls off - I&#x27;d say tiled is probably your best bet, though you&#x27;ll <br>
likely have to reglue most of them eventually.  Also, I&#x27;ve always <br>
thought the Pyramorphix, Tetraminx, Skewb Cube, Skewb Diamond, and <br>
Skewb Ultimate looked fun, but I can&#x27;t claim any actual experience <br>
with these puzzles (aside from breifly at the WC).<br>

aren&#x27;t pressure sensitive, but heat sensitive. So pushing with your

Also, the Rubiks timers should have a pad for the cube that is 
pressure sensitive, so you have to pick the cube up and it starts 
then put the cube back and it stops.

fyi...to engineer a change will cost over 50k and they wanted a 50k 
commitment for purchase....
 this would run into the 200k plus range......fyi....

hands on the pads....

and as indicated to change to meet our standards(which by the way

include the manufacturing costs...

either way its now Seventowns issue to deal with.

i think alot of people had fun with the pads..

   A timer unit, using a light and a light sensor to start and stop a
clock when a cube is lifted and replaced from a surface, with the
clock linked to a display, could be fashioned for a great deal less
that $50,000.

   Sometimes people over-engineer. There&#x27;s a story about a dairy owner
who hired a scientist to increase his milk production. After many
thousands of dollars and three months the scientist delivered his
report. It began, &quot;Assume a spherical cow.&quot; :)

          <div class="email-content">true, but the trouble is if the speedstack timer setup isn&#x27;t used, then one
cannot fairly compare times from the previous world championship to the next
one. Thus making the World Record time insignificant.

          <div class="email-content">that&#x27;s too bad-- 50k seems like highway robbery.  if i were 
seventowns i certainly wouldn&#x27;t do it for that cost.  it would be 
hard to think that they could ever sell $50k worth of additional 
rubik&#x27;s cubes as a result of the existence of a specialized timer in 
competitions.

i wonder why it costs so much?  it seems that it should just be a 
matter of not attaching the foam mat to the timer, and instead 
connecting the timer to a small plastic plate with a photo diode or 
something.

          <div class="email-content">I see two general issues that are being discussed:
1. How the timer is started and stopped.
2. How well the timer works when someone does what they&#x27;re supposed 
to do to start and stop it.

Regarding #1, doesn&#x27;t having the time start/stop based on picking up 
and putting down the cube cause trouble if the cube is dropped onto 
the mat or if someone rests their hands on the mat while solving?  
Using the StackMat, you put the cube down and put your hands on the 
spots to indicate you&#x27;re done.  It&#x27;s a more accurate indicator that 
you&#x27;re done than just dropping the cube on the pad.  But having said 
that, I can see there being debate between speedcubers who want these 
timers to record time the absolute fastest way and people who want to 
compromise a tenth of a second to make sure the timer accurately 
interprets the start/stop events.

Regarding #2, I&#x27;ve read the posts about slapping versus pressing, 
using palms vs fingertips, and it occurs to me that there are many 
more cup stacking events than speedcubing events... if we are having 
these problems (I mean if it&#x27;s a big problem for us as a group, 
rather than just a small number of people who aren&#x27;t stopping the 
timer correctly) then the cup stackers must be too.  And the people 
at SpeedStacks are going to have incentive to make the sensors work 
better.  So that&#x27;s a problem that&#x27;s going to work itself out without 
our relatively small group having to do anything about it.

&gt;Using the StackMat, you put the cube down and put your hands on the<br>
&gt;spots to indicate you&#x27;re done.  It&#x27;s a more accurate indicator that<br>
&gt;you&#x27;re done than just dropping the cube on the pad.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think so. It only senses that you have put down both hands <br>
(yes, it can tell if only one hand is touching both sensors), it has <br>
no information on where the cube is. That makes perfect sense in <br>
speedstacking, where you have to leave a stack of cups standing by <br>
itself.<br>
<br>
What bothers me a bit about using it in cubing is that you can touch <br>
the sensors at any time, including before you have let go of the <br>
cube, by using the &quot;heels&quot; of your hands. So you could complete the <br>
final move *after* you&#x27;ve stopped the timer. The way to get the best <br>
legal times is to get as close as possible to this, and it will be <br>
really hard to determine if somebody was near, on or over the border <br>
line.<br>
<br>
I doubt that was a problem in Toronto, since everyone was so new to <br>
the timers, but given time to practice with these things I&#x27;m sure <br>
people will come up with techniques to get as low times as possible <br>
(it&#x27;s what we do!), and it can get pretty ugly.<br>
<br>
I think the 1982 timer was ideal. It starts when you lift the cube, <br>
and stop when you put it down. You can imagine border line scenarios <br>
there too, but it&#x27;s much harder.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS. If anyone thinks they can design a manufacturable cube timer for <br>
way under $50k, *this* is the perfect time to underbid the <br>
speedstacking people! I&#x27;m sure Seven Towns would love to pay less if <br>
they could.<br>

          <div class="email-content">You really reccomend the smaller 4x4x4 over a normal sized one?  I&#x27;ve <br>
had bad experiences with mefferts, but I suppose I&#x27;m willing to give <br>
him one more shot.  The semi-broken pyraminx exploded after I solved <br>
it exactly 1 time from getting it in the mail from him.  I kinda <br>
rigged it back together, but it makes speed pyraminxing out of the <br>
question.  My megaminx also had one of the edges glued to one of the <br>
centers, making certain turns impossible, and it was missing a few <br>
stickers.  And lastly, of the 2 5x5&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ordered from him, 1 was <br>
the wrong color scheme, the other one explodes after about 20 turns, <br>
useless.  The only other thing I&#x27;ve ordered from him was my first <br>
4x4, and admittedly, I dropped that one, before which it worked great.<br>
<br>
So I&quot;m wary.  But everyone says they&#x27;re so good!  At any rate, thanks <br>
very much! I&#x27;ll look into the mini 4x4x4!<br>

They are not a whole lot smaller in size, but they probably weigh <br>
half as much.  To your question, though, the mini 5x5&#x27;s also move <br>
very well.  I think each of the 5x5 event finalists at the WC were <br>
using one of the mini&#x27;s.<br>

Me too, but they were always willing to resolve the issue to my <br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Adam and DanH, and Eric makes a good point about the 
bounce of the cube on the pad altering the angle of a layer. Now I 
think the pads are nearly ideal... Perhaps something like shortening 
the length of the pad since we cubists don&#x27;t need all that space or 
adding some sort of net to catch the cube when we let it hang in the 
air as we slap, may be nice. Now I highly..., highly doubt that it 
would take $50K to re-engineer the timer, but I am no expert in this 
matter. The light-sensitive diode idea does not sound too appealing 
to me at all. Regarding Petrus&#x27;s comments, I think that in anything 
it is quite possible to &quot;cheat the system.&quot; If you think about it, 
the mats are quite similar to what we do at home, with the exception 
of not holding the cube in our hand when we start the timer (or 
hands it you use a countdown), but this would obviously not fly in 
competition standards.

As a final note, stop blaming the timer for those precious 
hundredths of a second... Practice a bit and knot off some tenths! 
Just make a reasonable goal or yourself on what times you can 
get &quot;in that particular setting, using whatever &#x27;official&#x27; timer.&quot; I 
solve the cube in about 23s on an average of 100 consecutive at 
home, my goal was only to break 20 on one solve at WC (came very, 
close btw)... it is typical that in WC environment to be a lot 
slower (oh... don&#x27;t start blaming the lighting and timers) for the 
execption of Grant, who said he was affected differently by the 
pressure/adrenalin of it all.

          <div class="email-content">I think that to be regarded as a master at something you need to not 
just be extremely fast or proficent at something, but to be 
knowledgable at it, to have made some significant contributions to 
the field, to be extremely dedicated in its practice, and to have 
developed your own techniques: i.e. (in our case) algorithms, 
triggers, signature moves if you will, have something out there that 
other people appriciate and add to their own solving.

Just being fast is not enough, but being a big math geek and able to 
converse about the cube in a sophisticated manner helps A LOT.

I could go through and list a bunch (>30) of people (cubists) that I 
regard as masters but then I&#x27;d probably accidently leave someone out 
so I will only indicate one :). As a rule of thumb, the younger one 
is, the less likely he/she is a master, the more likely he/she will 
become a master some day. Because only through age/experience does 
one gain true wisdom (cube wisdom if you will).

   May I recommend an electronic component inside the cube that can
report on it&#x27;s state and a signal processor to receive the signal from
several cubes at once. This could be a standard item to fit any
authentic cube, and it would count from a &quot;go&quot; sound until it sensed
it was solved. This could be backed by videotape. That way the
speedcubist wouldn&#x27;t have to pick up the cube or put it down.

   Additional technical aspect: when the 10 or 15 second inspection
clock begins its countdown the cube is picked up and examined. When
that time is elapsed the run time begins, perhaps preceeded by a
condown, and a horn is sounded and a light flashes on, or something.
The time starts then regardless but will be started sooner with the
completion of a quarter turn, (and the time taken by that turn is also
counted). The cubist is allowed to put the cube down.

   When the cube is solved it sends a signal to the signal processor
which list the time, and the cube, appropriately in competition files
and on a board with other times. The device could also record and
display the moves made to solve the cube.

   Heck, I could spend $50 grand on this easy...

Ahahah, and don&#x27;t forget that the cube must be able to speak at least
english and german ($10 more for the portuguese add-on)! :-)

BTW, maybe you&#x27;ve noticed this:

but there&#x27;s nothing else I can find about this virtual electronic cube...

An interesting idea, but easier said than done I think.<br>
<br>
When does a turn start and end, and what are the tolerances?<br>
Cubists don&#x27;t make _exact_ 1/4 turns. Then there is the <br>
problem of making an 1/8 of a turn and possibly retracting<br>
a move, and also full 180 degree turns.<br>

How about this, I&#x27;d love to work on it, but I don&#x27;t seem to get 
around to it. Maybe three weeks is not enough, but the general idea 
could be used:

Implement a program that can solve a mixed rubiks cube (3x3) using a 
database with several methods, like layer-by-layer, fridrich, petrus, 
you name it.

Then try to make it find the least number of moves, by starting from 
different positions, perhaps backtracking moves to find lucky cases.

You could use a neural network for this also, or genetic programming, 
if your into AI.

Then you could also make a statistical comparison between the 
different methods.

That ought to give you enough work!

you are into AI?? Do you, by any chance, work at the MIT AI lab? If 
so, do you participate in their cube-ins? Iwould like to make myself 
and cube art known ro tthem.

I have parricipated at the WC exhibiting 3d cube art. The first step 
is to solve your design  ccubes. That  ould be achieved by a 
solvibng program, fazt or slow. When that nis done, speedcubists 
reach for anorther unsolved cube. For 3d cube artists, that is the 
first step. Next you have to  put a paattern on cubes by 
conventional (judicious) twiddling, make sure all cubes are properly 
color-synchronized, and stack them together. THAT is rhe program I 
am looking for! I did not solve this using a computer, and don&#x27;t 
have available code for this, otherwise you&#x27;d be hearing about it.

Thank you, computer geniuses out there, for any help.

          <div class="email-content">Here is an idea that will benefit the speedcubing community.  Develop 
a program that can be used to verify that a cube has been scrambled 
properly during competitions.  The program must accept two inputs: 1) 
the colors on the competitor&#x27;s F,U,R,D,L,B faces, and 2)the desired 
scramble pattern.  The output is a picture showing how the faces 
should look following the scramble.  This output would be used by the 
scramblers to ensure that they scrambled the cube properly for each 
and every competitor.

          <div class="email-content">I definitely have a preference for the smaller, lighter, and more 
delicate 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 (I think mine are EastSheen?). Possibly 
because I&#x27;m a girl, and thus have smaller hands than most other 
cubers. I&#x27;ve had a play with the standard size 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes 
which I found too big for me and certainly too heavy. I think I&#x27;d end 
up with a wrist injury if I cubed with those monsters (seriously!)

If you have large hands and strong fingers, you&#x27;d probably prefer the 
standard size. I use slice moves sometimes when solving the 4x4x4 and 
the 5x5x5 and if my hands/fingers were larger then this would be 
quite difficult with my small cubes.

          <div class="email-content">I just discovered the wonderfull world of foot-cubing and it is 
actually quite fun. My best unlucky time is 4:01.55 and if I&#x27;m not 
mistaken, that&#x27;s an unofficial world record! I rarely get above 6 
minutes and have solved no more than 15 cubes with my feet. My 
solution is rather long and I was surprised at my times but my toe 
dexterity is probably better than any cuber since I don&#x27;t wear shoes 
which allows the muscles there to grow strong. The only problem is I 
sometimes get lost in the middle of algorithms and have to stop and 
go through the alg in my head pretending I&#x27;m doing it with my hands. 
It would help if I had another cube in my hands in which to do these 
algs and get the moves down before I do it with my feet but I don&#x27;t 
know if that would be allowed. Do any other foot cubers have any 
usefull tips or technique they use or good adbvice. I would be 
interested to hear any. The surface is quite important the best one 
I could find so far for foot-cubing is a rug. Surfaces too soft make 
very hard to align the faces but ones to hard make it very hard to 
turn them. A soft rug is a good compromise. Maybe this could be made 
into an official event at WC2005. My goal will be to get a sub 3 
minute time which I think is very possibel.
happy cubing,

Hi

How about this, I&#x27;d love to work on it, but I don&#x27;t seem to get 
around to it. Maybe three weeks is not enough, but the general idea 
could be used:

Implement a program that can solve a mixed rubiks cube (3x3) using a 
database with several methods, like layer-by-layer, fridrich, petrus, 
you name it.

Then try to make it find the least number of moves, by starting from 
different positions, perhaps backtracking moves to find lucky cases.

You could use a neural network for this also, or genetic programming, 
if your into AI.

Then you could also make a statistical comparison between the 
different methods.

That ought to give you enough work!

I already did that, except for the color schemes. I am working on

I included the timer just for fun, I usually use my stopwatch.

Have a look at http://utopia.knoware.nl/users/blonkm/cubetimer.htm

Any suggestions on how to implement the color picking?

No I do not work in AI, and yes I have seen your designs, since I was 
in Toronto. I don&#x27;t know what the cube-ins are. Anyway, for your 
designs you don&#x27;t need AI. Just a program that can show cubes in a 
three dimensional pattern. Actually where is the art in programming 
pretty patterns when you can make them yourself? Try werner

maybe my cube javascript can help you checking patterns. (see my next

          <div class="email-content">Great  barefoot CHRIS, you&#x27;re already below my ambitious 5 min goal!

I agree that the first problem foot-cubers encounter is that you can get 
lost in the middle of a sequence. One other problem for me is the slice 
move. I do not true slice moves with my feet. I have to turn each 
opposite faces individually and then rotate the cube. And I do quite a 
lot of slice moves. To avoid the unnecessary cube rotations, I have to 
slightly modifiy the sequences.

I prefer to solve the cube on a rug. But I had no problem to solve it on 
concrete, but that is not healthy for the cube. For speedcubing, a not 
too soft rug is to prefer.

I think that having another cube in your hands, trying things out, 
should not be allowed in competitions. Anyhow, I belive that such an aid 
would help in practising foot-cubing, but I do not think that it helps 
getting faster times when speedcubing.

We can make foot-cubing to be official the next WC. It was &quot;almost&quot; 
official at WC2003.

Yes,  can, and have, cubed in all pretty patterns of my designs. In 
fact, I have done all my designs without use of a computer. But 
people told me that, for them, those designs are not tractable 
without some sort of a computer code, so I am looking for one. :-)
This answer is neither artificial, nor intelligent, but it&#x27;s the 
best one I can give.

I heard tnat professors at MIT stage periodic meetings in which they 
discuss things about the Rubik&#x27;s cube. They call those

          <div class="email-content">Thank you! That was my reasoning, just couldn&#x27;t defend it properly. 
But might I suggest lower-case in bracets, just to create more of a 
distinction for cube rotations - like [r]? Ross and I both use this 
as our notation of choice.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, try http://cs.felk.cvut.cz/~xobitko/ga/

That should get you started on genetic algorihtms. Actually these 
kind of algorithms are nothing more than very fancy search engines. 
But with 43 trillion possible states and some order higher for paths 
to a clean state, you&#x27;d have to have some incredible search 
algorithm. These AI program can never be as good as the Kociemba 
method, which does a full search in various groups.

Now, neural networks are more like pattern recognisers, just like we 
are! They have to be tought in order to get better, and of course 
that would never work as good as brute force. I would suggest against 
neural networks for this specific problem, because using fridrich of 
petrus&#x27; system you only need to look at a few cases in order to find 
a solution to the next step.

I&#x27;d say first try to implement one simple system and a backtracking 
algorithm. That should definitely get you on your way. And of course 
I&#x27;d be very interested to see the results!

          <div class="email-content">Yes, but those &quot;cube-ins&quot; have LONG since faded away... On the 
bright side there are some college cubists now that are starting up 
campus cube clubs in major universities. Hopefully there will be a 
large following at Purdue and my school, U-Mich.

There probably can&#x27;t be more then 5 cubists (&lt;90s) at MIT anyways. 
For most serious students, cubing either doesn&#x27;t seem too appealing, 
isn&#x27;t worth the effort, or think it&#x27;s a waste of time. On the 
contrary, it probably makes you smarter, improves your hand-eye 
coordination, improves reflexes, and is a great application of group 
theory ideas. (I might need statistical data to support some of 
these claims however...)

          <div class="email-content">The probability should be the same.  There are 4 ways for the LL to be done (U, U2, U&#x27;, or no turn) and for that one alg to work there should be the same 4 ways for it to happen.  Either way the pieces have only 1 way to line up relative to each other.

Dan Harris &lt;dan_j_harris@...> wrote:In the run up to the World Championships, I had my first ever Luckiest Last Layer, that is to say after placing the 4th F2L pair, the entire LL was solved, hence so was the cube (give or take a U turn)

Then this morning, I have had the next shortest LL case, not once, but twice! That is the T orientation (F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;) and then no Permutation. Is this a lot more likely to occur than a Luckiest Last Layer? For instance, I know that the chance of the LLL is something resembling 1/(216*72) (please correct me if this is wrong), and I also know the probability of the T-orientation is 1/54. Performing the T-orientation also executes the &quot;Arrow&quot; Permutation (Case 15 on my site) which has a probability of 1/18, so presumably for the 6 move LL to occur this has to be at the correct angle when executing the Orientation, which makes the probability 1/(18*4) = 1/72

So does this make the probability of this particular 6 move LL 1/(54*72) ? Or am I completely wrong (Most likely, I&#x27;m no good at probability theory! Is there some conditional probability stuff going on here?)

Food for thought! DanH :)

Note: I realise that there are other 6 move LL&#x27;s concerning the P-shape Orientations, but for now I am only interested in this T-shape Orientation, because it is this case which appeared twice on my cube in a matter of a few solves.

was a discussion about seeing an unsolved cube within your reach, and

Anyway, that&#x27;s a good point.If you don&#x27;t make the method fit your

then you&#x27;re not a master.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, <br>
<br>
I used regular 4x4 and 5x5 at WC. <br>
I think the matter is not only the size but the mechanics. <br>
More pieces makes more joints. Those makes cube more flabby, <br>
theoretically. <br>
Eastsheen (mini-) 4x4 has more pieces than Rubik&#x27;s and is too flabby <br>
for me to do. <br>
As same as 3x3, flabby cube is not good for speed. <br>
That is (was) one reason why I prefer Rubik&#x27;s 4x4. <br>
However, I was surprised that Eastsheen cubes, which David, Ron and <br>
the othe peoples use, are so nice. (Unfortunately, I have not tried <br>
Grant&#x27;s. )<br>
And I was really really surprised that they don&#x27;t care even color <br>
scheme. <br>
At least they have not restickered ugly purple color stickers. <br>
If they pay some effort to resticker big cube, they might be able to <br>
do much faster. <br>
And I might abuse Eastsheen cubes or the lot was not good. <br>
<br>
Easheen 5x5 has a plastic wall inside. <br>
I think if they make the wall from some kind of metal, it may become <br>
more solid and better. <br>
My mini-5x5 is also flabby and explosive. <br>
Regular 5x5 sometimes causes flipping pop of inner cubbies but I can <br>
fix easily and it is definitely better than explosion! <br>
I don&#x27;t want to collect a hundred of pieces around. <br>
<br>
But I would like to try another mini-4x4 and 5x5 one more time. <br>

Guys, if you think that I wanted to be the only one exhibiting cube

I know Jake&#x27;s art. Since he didn&#x27;t come in person, enjoy his website.

I am not a speed cubist, but I understamnd that the masters in this 
discipline are Jessica Fridrich and Lars Petrus. Anyone else, that 
would satisfy the above ctriterion, that is, developing HIS or HER 
OWN METHOD?

There is a room for masters in other disciplines of cubing, such as 
computer cubing, cube art,  even cube svience. This last discipline 
uses the cube to formulate new scientific and mathematical concepts, 
that have been previously unknown.

Eastsheen cubes look flabby and weak, I agree. Never had problems with
mine, but they always feel like they&#x27;re going to explode.

I&#x27;m not a fast 4^3 cuber so I can&#x27;t speak on this subject, but
sometimes I prefer heavy cubes, and that&#x27;s why I tried to make a heavy
3^3 cube.
I filled the edge parts with putty (don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the right word
- &quot;mastic&quot; in french). It makes the cube twice as heavy (it needs
strong springs).

A lot more inertia, very pleasant. Something you could try if you
haven&#x27;t yet.

Gilles.

&gt; needs strong springs).<br>

Just don&#x27;t get used to your heavy 3x3x3, because this is one of the <br>
things they checked cubes for at the WC...  Perhaps it&#x27;s better to <br>
content with using a &quot;standard&quot; 3x3x3.<br>

          <div class="email-content">my opinion is that in most circumstances, the actual fingers you are 
using isn&#x27;t all that useful to other speed cubers.  for it to be 
complete, you would also need to indicate how the other hand is 
holding the cube.  so it seems that if you want to convey exactly 
how you do an alg, it&#x27;s most accurate to just post a link to a video.

i am in in the process of learning the 57 LL orientation algs.  i&#x27;m 
good enough to know all the basic finger tricks and how to achieve 
economy of motion.  after dissecting an alg and making my own method 
for doing it, i usually check out some of the tutorials that show 
videos of other speedcubers doing it.  80% of the time i like my way 
better-- although sometimes i&#x27;ll scrap what i just did and start 
over with some new ideas from a video.  that doesn&#x27;t mean that 80% 
of the time the other people are slower or worse, it just means that 
we&#x27;re different.

there are times when i just don&#x27;t see a good way to perform an alg, 
and i&#x27;ll check out video&#x27;s for ideas.  i rarely end up doing exactly 
what someone else did though.  if i were stumped on how to perform 
an alg, i don&#x27;t think that a written notation is what i would turn 
to for ideas.  a video just seems much better for this kind of thing.

talking about, would atleast give a lot more info than just an normal notation would, and if 
you have the notation and the video together, it would be easier to comprehend the video, 
even if it&#x27;s really fast.

I would at least greatly improve my understanding about how somwone is performing an 
algo with that notation. at least where fingertricks are involved.

          <div class="email-content">I think that could be pretty cool!<br>
<br>
<br>
My guess is that a more high level notation would be most useful. <br>
That is, instead of describing in detail what each finger does, name <br>
and classify all finger tricks. There can&#x27;t be all that many of them. <br>
20? Depends on how you classify them I guess.<br>
<br>
So instead of {lh}L&#x27; {li}U&#x27; {lh}L (lh = left hand), you&#x27;d write <br>
{ptr}(L&#x27;U&#x27;L), where {ptr} is a code for &quot;push trigger&quot; or whatever <br>
that&#x27;s called.<br>
<br>
You&#x27;d still want the low level notation to explain unusual movements, <br>
I suppose.<br>
<br>
OTOH, the simple grouping of moves would very often be enough to tell <br>
us what tricks to use.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course you&#x27;ll get more info from a video, but with a notation <br>
you&#x27;ll be able to just read something and understand it, rather than <br>
the at least several minutes (if you&#x27;re online) it takes to download <br>
and watch video. Or if you&#x27;re the author, you can just write 15 <br>
characters in an email, instead of the immense hassle of recording a <br>
video and posting it online. Or if you&#x27;re writing down notes by hand <br>
in your cube study notebook... you get the idea.<br>
<br>
Or think of it this way: Sometimes it&#x27;s better to listen to a <br>
recording of speech, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the written language <br>
is not useful also.<br>
<br>
Maybe it won&#x27;t be used a lot. We don&#x27;t talk a lot about such matters. <br>
But then again, maybe one reason for that is that we don&#x27;t have a <br>
language to talk and write about them in?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think that it is already enough to put in () and to have 
distinctintion between something like R2&#x27; and R2. With a bit of 
experiecnce it is VERY easy to recognize what one should do for any 
given trigger. Besides, we perform triggers slightly differently 
amongst ourselves, so it is really up to the executor on how to grip 
and stuff. With even more experience it is not impossible to look at 
a raw algoirthm and parse out the triggers yourself - I do this all 
the time and am writing code to do this automatically for my future 
algorithm database. Lars&#x27;s idea with naming the individual triggers 
might be nice; I do this a bit:
I call (R&#x27;UR&#x27;) flick-towards, (RU&#x27;R) flick-away, hem... a bunch more 
with names too silly to mention here. I&#x27;d like to know what some of 
you out there would name the basic commutator (RU&#x27;R&#x27;U) though.

The problem is basically this: the advanced people don&#x27;t need this 
extra notation, and the beginners may get confused by it. Also I&#x27;d 
find it somewhat annoying to be &#x27;told&#x27; which finger to use.

          <div class="email-content">Most cubers are familiar with the fact that the cube can be in over <br>
43 quintillion positions.  It&#x27;s made me think of several questions...<br>
<br>
1.) A lot of the positions of the cube are the same, but only <br>
differentiate(spelling?) by a simple cube rotation.  If I researched <br>
correctly, in any given scrambled state, there are 11 other <br>
scrambled states that are exactly the same, only different by cube <br>
rotation.  Just a thought anyway, if I&#x27;m wrong please let me know, <br>
because i&#x27;m interested to know.<br>
<br>
2.)now if i&#x27;m right about there being 11 seperate but exact cases <br>
that differ only by rotations, you could divide the 43 quintillion <br>
by 12.  This gives you something over 3.5 quintillion, or <br>
3,500,000,000,000,000,000 different positions.  A rough estimation <br>
on total sales for the rubik&#x27;s cube was a number around 500 <br>
million.  (according to the source i saw)  Next I try to figure in <br>
my minds-eye how many turns are made on the average 3x3 in <br>
it&#x27;s &quot;lifetime&quot;  Cubers like all of us have made thousands of turns, <br>
some people have made hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, i don&#x27;t <br>
know.  But a good lot of people only make a few hundred moves before <br>
destroying their cube, ripping stickers off, etc.  So to be generous <br>
we&#x27;ll say that each of the 500 million cubes sold had on average 500 <br>
turns made on it.  So in total, 250 billion turns made, or <br>
250,000,000,000. Lets just pretend that each turn made represents a <br>
possible position of the 3.5+ quintillion.(un-realistic i know)  <br>
Assuming all the math and assumptions i&#x27;ve made are correct, which <br>
they probably aren&#x27;t, that would mean that we have only got <br>
1/14,000,000 of all possible positions on the cube.  So there are <br>
scrambled states that haven&#x27;t been acheived yet.  And at this rate, <br>
we have a long time before we hit every one of those positions.<br>
<br>
for all of you who attempted following along with my undeveloped, <br>
unorganized, and probably horrible ideas, thanx for reading.  Feel <br>
free to critique my math in any way.<br>

&gt; experiecnce it is VERY easy to recognize what one should do for any <br>
&gt; given trigger.<br>
<br>
Yes, and no.  Sometimes, when people write out an alg, they group <br>
together so many moves, I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible that it could <br>
be a single &quot;finger trick&quot;.  I would say it is far from easy to <br>
decipher these.  For a moment, I&#x27;m going to pick on Peter, since I <br>
knew I could find an example of this on his page.  This is <br>
orientation 06-02 from<br>
http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/AllesFastOrient.html :<br>
(R&#x27;U²RU)(R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;UR) <br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t help but think that this is actually executed something more <br>
like:<br>
(R&#x27;U²)(RU)(R&#x27;U&#x27;RU)(R&#x27;UR)<br>
or<br>
(R&#x27;U²)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RU)(R&#x27;UR)<br>
<br>
Am I wrong, or can you somehow actually string together 6-7 moves <br>
without regripping the cube?  The only situation that I&#x27;ve come <br>
across (that I can think of) where I didn&#x27;t need to regrip the cube <br>
for a move that long was for orientations 31 and 32 (same page).  <br>
Aside from rolling my fingers a little bit to change which hand is <br>
holding the center slice (between R and L), and loosening a little to <br>
allow a held face to turn, I can perform the following without any <br>
grip changes (parenthesis indicate the finger rolls/loosening) :<br>
(R&#x27;U&#x27;R)(L&#x27;B&#x27;LB)(R&#x27;UR)<br>
<br>
&gt; Besides, we perform triggers slightly differently amongst<br>
&gt; ourselves, so it is really up to the executor on how to grip <br>
&gt; and stuff.  With even more experience it is not impossible to look<br>
&gt; at a raw algoirthm and parse out the triggers yourself...<br>
<br>
True, but when learning, it can be extremely helpful to understand <br>
how the alg is performed by someone who is already experienced with <br>
it.<br>
<br>
&gt; The problem is basically this: the advanced people don&#x27;t need this <br>
&gt; extra notation, and the beginners may get confused by it. Also I&#x27;d <br>
&gt; find it somewhat annoying to be &#x27;told&#x27; which finger to use.<br>
<br>
I agree... Though perhaps you should think of it as being told which <br>
finger _they_ use, not which finger _to_ use.<br>

The simplest way for a person to approach it is probably a layer by

figuring it out.

And methinks that it will be a long, long, looooong time before all 
different positions are reached.
Has anyone thought about picture cubes? those have to have the 
centers oriented, so it would create 43 quintillion times 4 to the 
sixth power, I think. But I&#x27;m no math genius, so probably not. But 
it&#x27;s still a LOT bigger, right?

          <div class="email-content">My 2 cents on this notation idea-
I personally love videos and get the ideas for many of my algs from 
watching them. It is just about the best way to show how an alg is 
preformed. I don&#x27;t mind waiting for them to load. I agree many sites 
just put parenthesis around a bunch of letters which means nothing 
to me. I kinda like the idea about assigning names to different 
triggers the same way LarsP does to his algs. There are only so many 
of them and how to preform them could be explained or showed by 
videos like on DanK&#x27;s site. Doug does make a good point about the 
advanced not needing it and the beginners getting confused by it so 
I think the common notation used now accompanied by a *SLOW* video 
is best

centers.  As a regular cube is not the same after applying R L U R&#x27; <br>
L&#x27; U2 R L U R&#x27; L&#x27; U2.  As that algorithm flips the U center 180 <br>
degrees while leaving the rest of the cube untouched.  (this also <br>
makes me wonder about rubik&#x27;s cubes packaging claiming &quot;only one <br>
correct solution&quot;)<br>
<br>
Just thought I&#x27;d throw that in to the discussion, but absolutely mind <br>
numbing, isn&#x27;t it?  I&#x27;m an astronomer so i frequently deal with big <br>
numbers, but the entire visible univers is &quot;only&quot; 28 or so BILLION <br>
Light years across.... which is freaking huge btw.<br>
<br>
Think of this, your average rubik&#x27;s cube is 5.5cm or so across.  If <br>
you had one Rubik&#x27;s cube for each and every possible state of the <br>
rubik&#x27;s cube and lined them all up end to end, the row of cubes (for <br>
the standard belief of 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different <br>
possibilities, taken from www.rubiks.com) would be 251 LIGHT YEARS <br>
long.  The closest star is about 4 light years away.  That means <br>
everything in the picture here: <br>
http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/250lys.html would be closer than <br>
the last cube from us.  That&#x27;s  utterly amazing.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The real size of cube space is approx 4.3x10^19 / 48.<br>
It&#x27;s actually a bit bigger since some positions are more <br>
symmetrical:  901,083,404,981,813,616 <br>
<br>
Symmetries of a cube include all the rotations _and_ reflections,<br>
of which there are 48. <br>
<br>
A picture cube has approximately 8.8*10^22 states, assuming<br>
all 4 orientions of each centre are visible. <br>
<br>
The number of states of the picture cube is exactly 2048 times<br>
larger than for the regular 3x3x3 cube.<br>
<br>
In cube-lovers we talked about C-conjugates and M-conjugates.<br>
I&#x27;m not sure how widespread this notation is, but there are 24 C-conjugates<br>
and 48 M-conjugates for a given cube position. C-Conjugates only include cube <br>
rotations and M-conjugates had both cube rotations and cube reflections. It <br>
makes sense to use the largest symmetry group  possible to reduce the number <br>
of states so one could try to search the <br>
entire tree of positions.<br>

but any fears quickly vanished when I saw the author of the post was 
Mark Longridge. Cube Lovers was a good list.

43 Quintillion does seem like a lot, but it&#x27;s not always the space of 
a problem or puzzle that makes a puzzle good.

Ask a kid to arrange a set of alphabet blocks correctly. There is one 
way to get it right and 26! - 1 way to get it wrong:

403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 - 1 

It&#x27;s a problem with a space that&#x27;s about 10 million times bigger than 
the standard 4.3 quintillion of the rubik&#x27;s cube&#x27;s space!

Imagine the unfortunate librarian who has to rearrange an overturned 
card catalog! (I trust kids who remember Rubik&#x27;s cubes remember card 
catalogs).

          <div class="email-content">Yes, this kinda stuff happened all the time, I find myself waiting 
around 10 minutes in the lobby, then turning in a puzzle to the 
front desk. At one point I lost my cube bag. So I ended up having to 
turn in a very great Studio cube to the lost and found..., it was 
very tight and very smooth caracteristic of those preferred by the 
fastest among us. I hope Chris is talking about the same Clock as 
I&#x27;m thinking about, as I recall we had the documentary people hold 
on to one for a while, since we were in a rush. On Monday I heard 
Ron or someone else of the Dutch group was looking for their 
Clock..., but I didn&#x27;t pay too close attention.

BTW, I must be color blind or something, but can we get a consensus 
on wheather it is red or orange on the wc pins becasuse a) orange 
and pink almost co-inside on many cubes and b) one is right one is 
wrong w.r.t the standard.

course in Modern Alg.). Your lucky to have been a part of the whole 
Cube-Lovers thing. And yes, a bit bigger since some of the highly 
symmetry elements are counted multiple times.

          <div class="email-content">I dont consider myself an expert or a beginner of the cube. i&#x27;ve been cubing
steadily from may now, and my avg have finally crept below 40 sec.
i would consider myself an intermediate cuber, and i think there are a lot
more intermediate cubers, than expert cubers, and maybe even beginner
cubers.
I dont think that intermediate cubers would be confused by this notation.

With a family and 2 small kids and a lot of other hobbies, and an old house
that i&#x27;m beginning to restore, i have not the same amount of time and / or
dedication to the cube as some of the others here, but i still wants to be a
faster cuber, and learn more about the cube. I know that for someone like
me, the extended notation would make it easier to get a grasp of the
different ways an algorithm can be performed, and how some of the faster
cubers perform it without having to spend endless hours playing and
rewinding an video. and some of the fastest cubers dont even have videos on
how they perform their algos. On the other hand, someone might not want to
give away too much about how they do their moves, and ofcourse i can
understand that.

on the other hand, i would love if someone can collect and classify the
different finger tricks. i think lars said something like it being 20
something thricks. i only know and use RU&#x27;R&#x27; and L&#x27;UL, so then i definitely
have a lot to learn.

I agree with grant that it&#x27;s hard to understand how a string of 6 - 8 moves
can be a &quot;trigger&quot;.

and finally i just wanted to use one more example of my (extented thanks
Lars) notation.
i do the RU&#x27;R&#x27; algo this way : {rh}R {li}U&#x27; {rh}R&#x27;, but i think that maybe
most of you would do it like : {rh}R {ri}U&#x27; {rh}R&#x27; ??
to use the right index for the U&#x27; you would have to do a pushing move,
instead of a pulling, and i cant do that fast right now, but i think most
fast cubers can.

ok, just rambling away here, so i thought i would do one more :)

R&#x27;U&#x27;RU could be done like : {rh}R&#x27; {li}U&#x27; {rh}R {ri}U, and this is how i
would do it, but just playing a bit i found:
{rh}R&#x27; {rh}U&#x27; {rt}R {ri}U. this could also go quite fast i think with some
practice, but i&#x27;ve never tried it before.

i guess you experts know all the different ways of doing this, and maybe
both my ways are really stupid, but there are a few other ppl in this group
that are not yet experts and who might find this useful.


Terje

p.s. I dont mean to defend my notation rigorously, it was just an idea i
had, and i can understand that a few of you find it not nessassary, and
maybe even stupid.

          <div class="email-content">First off, you don&#x27;t have to call your idea stupid. It makes great 
sense, it&#x27;s just that due to certain reasons that I mentioned, it 
probably will never become mainstream. It&#x27;s a fairly freash idea 
also, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever heard of it.

Do define your notation properly before using it like in your last 
post; what does {rh} mean? I assume &quot;right-hand&quot; but didn&#x27;t you use 
{w} last time?. There needs to be consistancy here.

Well the way I perform the moves like double-sune that was given as 
an example is to just to each turn separatly but string them along 
fast, no true triggers there. As for the first one Grant mentioned 
(the so-called advanced 3-cycle) is basically strung together in one 
long trigger that is oddly enough more then 4 turns long, which is 
rare, but could be split like so (I think Gilles just mentioned it 
in the Perturs group): (R&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;)R&#x27;U&#x27;((R&#x27;U)(RUR2)). The trigger does 
actaulyl work out all the way through and can therefore be executed 
in something like 1.5s, which I am currently doing in (2.33s, do it 
10 times move the decimal) (still fuzzy about it&#x27;s inverse and 
mirrored inverse)...

R&#x27;U&#x27;RU rarly comes up for me, but I&#x27;d do something like: {rt+ri}R&#x27; 
{rt}U&#x27; {ri+rm}R {ri}U (where rm stands for right middle finger). I 
am getting 0.87s on it right now... that way. Both of your ways for 
it seem a bit awkward for my hands.

My rule-of-thumb for triggers is to never abuse the left index 
finger, use it actively but it works best when used at the end of a 
trigger so that it is being finished by your left hand as your right 
one is starting the next thing (this is tailored to right-handed 
people). I think I use it more activly then most cubists (I can 
already think of a few exceptions (Katsu is amazing with his left-
index finger)). And it is usually the case that my right hand is 
busy doing other stuff (mostly on R and D) and I use my left index 
to trigger U&#x27;. It is necessary to have a good grip on the cube 
during these triggers, so that is a reason why not to abuse the left 
index finger.

But of course you should try to come up with your onw little 
triggers if for nothing else they make your style more unique and 
perhaps more interesting to watch. For instance, I enjoy how Chris 
does his little karate-chop manuever that he does at the end 
sometimes (this is technically {rp}R or {rp}R2, where rp stands for 
right-pinky finger!). I do a few little things like UXU I can 
sometimes trigger as {ri}{xx}{rm}. For example UM&#x27;U I do this way. 
Also I have one move where I go like {rm}F&#x27; {li}R&#x27; (and no there is 
no mistake here, it is one of my signature finishes where the cube 
does a little flurish, way out with just the left hand and the last 
2-3 turns are actaully kinda finished spining / forced by the last 
{li}R&#x27; turn).

But this all gets more into the subject of style then triggers. 
Triggers arise out of your own style, my style is heavy with the M 
and D moves for example.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Grant,

   I haven&#x27;t posted any of my finger tricks before, So here foes my
first. I don&#x27;t have a name for these kind yet. Left thumb on Top
center, left middle finger on Bottom center; R2 B2 R F2 R&#x27; B2 R F2 R.
This is one of many algorithyms where there&#x27;s no need to move the cube
to the other hand or change the grip. Of course, the left hand may
rotate to assist the right in gaining speed.

   Questions and comments are welcome.

Regards,

David J

<br>
Been following the discussions on this forum for a while, but this <br>
is my first post. Been &quot;hooked&quot; on the cube since february. Doing an <br>
old-fashioned layer by layer which is pretty slow. Doing 52 on <br>
average with a 42 non-lucky fastest. Probably going to go for <br>
corners first some day, mostly because i feel it could be fun to not <br>
do Fridrich like most speedcubists seem to do. DanG&#x27;s upcoming <br>
website is also a reson for this. Seems to somekind of a Jess Bonde-<br>
Cornersfirst site ;) .<br>
<br>
Spent most of yesterday reading about blindfolded cubing and <br>
learning some algorithms and by the end of the day I made my first <br>
blindfolded solve on the 2x2x2. Gonna practice som more on the mini-<br>
cube before I go on to the 3x3x3. I&#x27;m also having thoughts of 15 sek <br>
pre-inspection blindfolded speedsolve of the 2x2x2. 15 secs should <br>
be enough for the 2x2x2 with som practice.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll be back with more blindfolded cubing, and some speedsolving <br>
when I have time to look further into corners first.<br>

umm .. i managed to get my algo wrong. i was trying to say RU&#x27;R&#x27;U .. i dont=
 know if it&#x27;s a 
much used combionation of moves, it was just an example. I like the way you=
 use your 
middle finger a lot. i use only my index finger + whole hand, exept for a f=
ew moves with my 
thumb. i guess i need to practice with more fingers.

I do use my left index finger a lot on right hand moves, but i guess it&#x27;s a=
ll about style and 
practice. i alternate and use my left hand just as much as my right in a no=
rmal solve.

I would love to see a video (slow motion) of chris&#x27;s karate-chop pinky styl=

The {rm}F&#x27; {li}R&#x27; would also be fun to watch. cool finish :)

I must say, for having only been addicted since feb, your times 
aren&#x27;t bad at all.  And already having a 2x2 blindfolded under your 
belt is awesome.  15 sec inspection is ambitious (then again, i still 
take 6 or so minutes to memorize a 3x3, and about 2 to memorize the 
2x2).

Hope it works out!

          <div class="email-content">RU&#x27;R&#x27;U is performed {rt}R {rt}U&#x27; {rm}R&#x27; {rm}U. I&#x27;m sure most of the 
fastest right-handers would agree with me on this one, but perhaps 
use {ri} as opposed to {rm}, but that may depend on how low/high you 
hold the cube. It is the fastest of all length 4 triggers I believe. 
I&#x27;m getting about 0.567s on it btw (feeling a bit competitive as 
usual, just wondering who can beat that).

It&#x27;s part of the DanK (and Mirek) Z-Perm manuever that I do all the 
time when I&#x27;m not solving. It is great how awesome that alg is. I 
remember seeing it for the first time almost 4 years ago and how 
amazed I was. In his video he executes it in about 2.7s (though 
maybe not going full speed and he has surely improved a lot since 
then), but I can now execute it in 2.13s! (I&#x27;m sure there are people 
faster then this out there...)

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
   There has been much discussion on the subject of public cubing, <br>
but what of public blindfolded cubing?<br>
I have recently started to attemp blindfolded cubing, and though the <br>
looks while cubing regularly are pretty funny, they don&#x27;t come close <br>
to the ones you get while cubing behind your back!<br>
   If I&#x27;m sitting at a table, I&#x27;ll cube under the table, but if I&#x27;m <br>
sitting on a bench in the hallway or something, waiting for class to <br>
start, I&#x27;ll cube behind my back.  And just today, I went to get a <br>
haircut and cubed under the little sheet thingy they put over you.  <br>
Got really really close, I had all edges correctly oriented and <br>
permuted, but I accidentaly permuted the UFL, DBR, and DBL corners <br>
the wrong direction.  They were oriented though.  Three measly pieces <br>
out of place!<br>
  At any rate, out of maybe 10 or so attempts, I&#x27;ve done 1 right and <br>
had 3 really near misses.  It just takes so much more effort than <br>
regular cubing!<br>
  Anyway, thought I&#x27;d share, and ask if anyone has any tips for <br>
public blindfolded cubing.<br>

Hi Grant,

   Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the hand that&#x27;s holding the cube. I&#x27;m glad
you like the alg!

   The closest I have to an alg that changes neither hand position,
sort of, is swaping the six centers around. (lower case letters mean
middle slices next to the Upper case side.) 

   The alg is r u r&#x27; u&#x27;  Left thumb on UFL corner; left middle finger
on UBL corner; right thumb on DFR corner; right middle finger on DBR
corner. Allow the fingers to overlap the edge cubies, or not, as they
move the center slices, but they never leave the corners.
   The left hand takes the Left side with it (L) when it goes and gets
its center slice, it brings them both back (L&#x27; l&#x27;). At this point the
only change is r. The right hand moves both the Down side and the
center slice (D&#x27; d&#x27;) And returns the Down side leaving the slice
behind (D) this change results in u. The left hand takes the Left side
along when it goes and gets the center slice (L&#x27;) and brings them both
back (L l) this results in r&#x27;. And last, the right hand turns both the
Down side and its slice (D d), and returns the Down side back, (D&#x27;)
which results in u&#x27;.

   With a little practice this can become very fast.

David J

get more reactions than when I do it normaly. It takes more time but

My advice for blindfold beginners is to try and make it as simple as 
possible at the beginning, meaning to do it in the most simplest way 
you can, using a minimal number of algorithems so you wont need to 
remember a lot of things and you will be able to focus on the 
solving.

Hopes this helps.

  It should be in Europe, because so many people are from there. 
  Probably Japan, or somehwere near Sweden, because so many people were 
  from those places. But I heard it might be in London.
  If in Europe, why not Australia? (Instead of Japan).

That was a good response, Rune. I immediately chcked my  message to 
make sre I did not inply Japan is uin Europe. No, mercifully I 
didn&#x27;t. Being a European by origin,  I know rhat Japan is nt there. 

BTW, it could be in Australia. Jasmine, I understand, lives there.

Who should be in charge? Probably a prson, who calls the venue 
country his home. He or she will need to make arrangemenrs that are 
best done by a native. Recall that Dan Gosbee, the organizer of the 
Toronto WC2003, lives in Toronto.

          <div class="email-content">I believe that the best reason to have 2005 in Europe is that the <br>
Cube is from Europe. Who&#x27;s home better to compete in than the cube <br>
itself?!  Budapest Hungary would be the logical location. Not only <br>
would the city be great for the simple fact that it holds such <br>
significance with Erno Rubik, the inventor, but also that Budapest is <br>
a beautiful city with great cultural and historical treasures. <br>
<br>
Two years ago, on my 6-week mad dash across Europe, I stayed in 12 <br>
cities but was sadly unable to visit Budapest. This, I found out, was <br>
very unfortunate since it is such a fun city, I hear. <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, any other city in Europe would be wonderful. This would <br>
allow all of the Americans to finally travel (for those who have <br>
never done so) to this wonderful area of the planet. I believe also <br>
that alot of people in America have always wished to go to Europe and <br>
this could be that oppurtunity which drives them forward in their <br>
dream of travelling abroad. <br>
<br>
London also would be great for the WC. Once again, another city which <br>
I did not visit but wish I had. London is one of the top world <br>
renowned cities with tons of international appeal. The publicity in <br>
this setting could be astonishing, especially with plenty of notice <br>
to the media in advance (1 year should do). Also, the Cube made it&#x27;s <br>
world debut in London at the Toy Expo that was held there in 1980. <br>
London also has great mass transit making for ease of travel to <br>
sightseeing destinations.<br>
<br>
Basically, there should not be too much of a argument against Europe <br>
as a location. Where in Europe definitely will be debated tirelessly, <br>
no doubt.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I dont really care where the next WC is held.  All I care is that it 
will be held somewhere.  I agree with Jason that if it were in 
Europe it would give alot of us from the states a reason to travel 
to Europe.  I think it would be cool to have it in Europe, it would 
make an awesome trip.  Although the cost to Europe will be 
considerible more than was my trip to Toronto.  That would be my 
only reason for wanting it over &#x27;here&#x27; again.  This works both ways 
though, I know it was quite costly for alot of you guys to make it 
to Toronto.....maybe the key is to find a sponsor before 2005:D

1988 when I was last there. And I suspect the Hungarians are still <br>

<br>
London is the most practical location. It&#x27;s English speaking, close <br>
to North America, and has good cheap flight connections to the entire <br>

Europe in this regard.<br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s good to learn that at least one other person besides me has 
taken up seeing eye blindfold cubing.  It was fun to surprise 
everyone with it in Toronto.  It definitely is easier than the 
competition form of blindfold cubing.  It is also a bit more 
spectator friendly, because the audience doesn&#x27;t have to wait while 
you memorize the cube.  There are other more difficult forms of 
seeing eye blindfold that you can learn if you would like to make it 
more challenging.  Please contact me if you are interested.

By the way, a good place to cube (blindfolded or otherwise) is to 
volunteer at the nearest science museum.  That&#x27;s what I have been 
doing weekly since this last January.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Michael and Jim,

   It&#x27;s nice to see that there is interest in seeing-eye blindfold
cubing. I suggested this as an event for Toronto WC2003, but no one
said they wanted it.

   It is probably the best thig you can do before trying straight
blindfold cubing, because you learn to picture what&#x27;s going on a
little bit at a time.

   Also you can practice this over the phone with friends.

   Regards,

   David J

I might have missed the comment on this, but have there been any <br>
attempts at seeing-eye where the solver who is blindfolded is NOT <br>
holding the cube nor turning it at all, but the average everyday <br>
person is answering the questions and doing all the turning, thus <br>
seemingly being the sole participant and potentially feeling as if <br>
they had solely solved it on their own????   <br>
<br>
wow!  that was a long run-on sentence!<br>
<br>
<br>
the comment about solving over the phone spurred this inquiry. Only <br>
one person would have the cube, and the other person would explain <br>
how to turn it based on the questions that they asked and were in <br>
turn answer by the cube holder.<br>
<br>
The only reason I delve so deeply into the matter is that I saw Jim <br>
Mattan explain his seing-eye technique and he was holding the cube <br>
and doing the turning.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, Mr. Mittan explained this to me. It is just a variation 
called &quot;Remote-Control Cubing.&quot; Not nearly as fun as the normal 
seeing-eye version I think, but could be a nifty to do to somebody 
completely new to the cube (they&#x27;ll just go around telling 
everybody &#x27;they&#x27; did it blindfolded :)). I think that the seeing-eye 
one is not great for formal competitions, but may be a great thing 
to do within say two cube buddies... to mix it up. I can see that 
being very competitive in a friendly way.

Anyways, I&#x27;m actually working on a BLD solve right now. I&#x27;m pretty 
new at this but I think I have a good arsenel of algs for it. I am 
down to 2 looks, one for twisting and flipping all pieces and the 
second to permute them.... Finding edge permutation is bit taxing 
though...

<br>
I just posted my new website a little while ago. It&#x27;s brand new, and that means <br>
it&#x27;s not even done yet, but I&#x27;m kind of impatient to get it up, so I have some <br>
stuff, but much more will come within the next few weeks.<br>

The URL is:<br>

Like I said, it&#x27;s not even done so you can expect more tips and my cube log. I <br>
have recorded my times and averages over the past year and one or two <br>
months which I&#x27;ll post so you can see the progress I&#x27;ve made since last year.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Richard, when I first read this I thought you meant that there 
weren&#x27;t any cities in Australia that would be suitable for an 
international competition, but then I realised that you probably 
meant that Australia is so far from the rest of the world that makes 
it not so suitable?

The two largest cities in Australia are Sydney and Melbourne. They 
are both great cities and certainly suitable for such things (Sydney, 
of course, being the home of the last Olympic Games), but they are a 
long distance for anyone else to travel.

I&#x27;ve travelled to Europe and the US and if it&#x27;s as expensive for you 
guys to travel here as it is for me to travel there, then I don&#x27;t 
think many people would come. To give you ballpark figures, 
travelling from Australia to US/Europe in the low season on discount 
economy seats is around AUD$2000 return or more. Travelling in mid-
season on standard economy seats is around AUD$2500-$3000 return, and 
travelling high season on standard economy seats is around $3000-
$3500 return. And that&#x27;s just the airfare, after those many thousands 
of dollars, then there&#x27;s all the other stuff (accommodation, food, 
etc.) On the other hand, the US dollar and the UKPound, are both 
doing pretty well against the Australian dollar which is bad news for 
me :( but good news for all of you if you travel here.

But still, at this sort of cost, I&#x27;m guessing that there wouldn&#x27;t be 
too many people willing to go to Australia?

I&#x27;d be quite happy with RWC2003 being in Europe. It&#x27;s a long way away 
for me (no further than Nth America though) but I&#x27;d certainly try to 
make it. :)

always wanted to go there and the WC would be the perfect excuse. My 
second choice would be Budapest. It is logical because the cube is 
Hungarian. I am also part Hungarian and would love to see the 
amazingly beautifull city. My third choice would be somewhere local 
for me such as Boston because it is cheap. I would like to know who 
would be in charge of organizing WC2005 and deciding this and who 
these rumors came from. Where ever it ends up being held, I&#x27;m sure 
I&#x27;ll be able to make it.

          <div class="email-content">Who would organize  it in Australia? And where in Australia? It is a 
continent, you know, just like Europe or Asia.

Budapest is a capital of Hungary, so we are getting nmore precise. I 
have never been in Budapest, and I would love to visit. Of course, 
the cube is  their national pride. Perhaps tbey may even like ny 
designs. It would probably be good if I were a Hungarian, bt I am 
not. :-)

Mr. Janos Kovacs liked my designs. He preferred the Landry Staircase 
over Vaserely. Lord  know he gave me invaluable help, when the 
organizers  changed the venue and we had to move from the Galaxy 
Room. I am very grateful to him.

In all this flurry of picking up the venue, we neglect to consider 
the sponsors. Without their financial assistance there will be no 
WC205. Lars P. is right. It may be a business decision.

So the next  question is: who will sponsor us? Where is the money 
coming from?

          <div class="email-content">Hi, Peter, I was at the Championships, but we didn&#x27;t talk. I was the 
sole and very worried exhibitor of cube art.
Please be prepared fior a dissappiontment. The fact that somebody 
shows up and identifies himself as being from piblication X does not 
yet mean piblication X will publish anything. Those people probably 
went home, handed  their pieces to their editors, then promptly 
forgot about our existence. That is the way it usually is, son. The 
fact  that we are besotted with the cube does not mean the rest of 
the wqorld is. 

I suggest you glance at speedcubing.com. If anything gets 
published,he will post it and you will see it. Ron will post it 
because he is besotted with the cube, too. And if there is a mention 
of cube art and its sile and foolish exhibitor, do let me know. :-))
Thanks.

          <div class="email-content">hey all,<br>
<br>
    I was wondering, there are so many websites and methods for the <br>
3x3 and 4x4, but what about the 2x2?  Does anyone have a website with <br>
algs or methods for it?  My avg. is aroud 37, and I am using <br>
algorithms from my old 3x3 booklet.  I&#x27;d like to get faster times, <br>
(as all of us do!) so can anyone give me some information?<br>

I can certainly see enough cubing talent in this region (with Japan and<br>

future... Travel cost will always be a problem, but that&#x27;s a good reason<br>
to continue moving the event around the world. For example, if it were<br>
held in Korea, perhaps there would be closer to 100 Koreans<br>
participating instead of zero (Korea has an online speedcubing community<br>

Hmm, maybe if these speedcubing events take off, then the best local<br>

This method is excellent:<br>

	http://www.rubikscuberecord.com/<br>
<br>
Algorithms are few and short. Recognition is quick. Explanation is,<br>
unfortunately, difficult. When he&#x27;s talking about X&#x27;s in step 1, he<br>
means the &quot;X&quot; sticker has either a red or orange colour on it. In step<br>
1, you should treat red and orange as the same colour. Then in step 2,<br>
you should begin to distinguish between red and orange.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Are you doing a proper Lars F2L with early edge orientation? Cuz if 
you are then those numbers seem right, but you just can&#x27;t compare to 
the Fridrich method that way. Since Lars would give you a 
significant advantage at the end. Now if your not doing the proper 
Lars then those numbers are bad, it shouldn&#x27;t take more then 30 
turns (HTM) to do the F2L that way period. The Fridrich F2L is 
supposively 35 moves on average btw.

You speak of OLLs though. So are you transitioning from Lars to 
Fridrich? Or doing a combination of both sort of a &quot;Petrich&quot; as some 
people now call it? Or do you mean the CLLs that retain edge flip 
(step 5+6)?

I don&#x27;t although it shouldn&#x27;t be difficult...

I wrote a timer for the TI-92 if anyone is interested - I don&#x27;t know 
about the other calculators, but TI92 doesn&#x27;t have a clock (not a 
reliable one anyway), so it just needs calibrating with a real timer 
before use - it then works pretty similar to Dan Knights cube timer

mail me privately if you are interested:

I guess one positive aspect of being the only speedcuber in our

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I orient the edges before completing the F2L. It makes the LL

ps. still can&#x27;t find one error-free cube article, but this last one

Hi Peter

The guy was doing an article for the Sunday Supplement but no date was given
as it was on spec rather than commissioned, this fairly frequent for
freelancers and he had worked with them in the past.
If it comes up I&#x27;ll be sure to let you know

Thanks, Hana; but I&#x27;m not disappointed, just curious. I&#x27;m still in 
the DC area in the US for work for a while, and I wanted to make 
sure that if anything was printed I got a copy to mail back to

          <div class="email-content">(sidenote: The hidden meaning of my last post is that I am starting 
to doubt the accuracy of the media in general, as a whole. I don&#x27;t 
count documentaries as media, still waiting to see them and make a 
fair assessment.)


So before making my last post I had to check the net for articles 
featuring myself to be certain. I came across a lot of stuff about 
my idea for an algorithms database. It seems that interest in it 
is &#x27;iffy at best&#x27;, there are few that believe it is doable, and/or 
it doesn&#x27;t appear to be worth it.

So if anybody is truly interested, e-mail me. You are right if you 
think &#x27;I&#x27; can&#x27;t do it, from the start I have asked for help, and as 
a group, this should be on our list of priorities with &quot;getting 
faster&quot; and &quot;wc2005&quot;. Well thrid, I obviously feel it is worth the 
time and effort. As for implementation, yes the front-end will be 
difficult (made a couple attempts, not happy with them), but the 
back-end is like 80% done (all the data populated, will be writing 
scripts to crawl through cubists web sites to assimlate algs for 
more...).

I am taking a relatively light course load this semester and do plan 
on advancing this project further. So I really, really, really, want 
help on this big project of mine (contribute and you can call 
it &#x27;yours&#x27; also :)). I am of course willing to share credit for it 
and only publicized it in its early phase to maintain originality 
points for it. 

OK, so here is what I need: a programmer(s) proficient in VB scripts 
for ASPs who hopefully maintains(-ed) a database-based website, 
someone to tell me it is feasible to tinker around with a &quot;15MB&quot; 
database on a server, someone good with DB stuff (Oracle, SQL, 
etc.), and private server space (can run all sorts of scripts with 
good security and space, ideally off speedcubing.COM). Ideally 
they&#x27;d work for no compensation, but anything reasonable will be 
considered...

Code-wise I need: an advanced records-paging mechanism (something as 
simple as the way search engines have it on the bottom might work), 
an advanced search-engine (hehe, given 3 months to write general one 
last semester for a CS class) tailored to my needs (alg&amp;case stats 
have all been pre-computed), script a dynamic merge of very small 
b/w images to form alg diagrams (lines and arrows, parts I already 
made), buttons to dynamically rotate/mirror/inverse stuff (algs, 
permutation strings, and the diagram), and probably a few more 
things I can&#x27;t think of currently. Yes, I realize this is asking for 
a lot, but why do it if to allow someone to take the idea and make a 
much better one within a month or two... it has to set the bar and 
set it high.

I am putting this here because I know many of you in this group are 
IT professionals and/or have worked with this kinda stuff. (We all 
know I can&#x27;t persuade other CS majors here to do th work..., unless 
I can find a prof willing to take it in a a bit of a reasearch 
project for hired students.)

I really don&#x27;t see practical directions to go currently (kinda 
stuck), so it&#x27;d be nice if someone could point me in the right 
direction. BTW, for those that are interested and just can&#x27;t help, 
it&#x27;s still gona take at least a year more to finish, hopefully I can 
show some of you the beta version. I just know that with the right 
help, we can get this to work and then rarely would we ever have to 
resort to some optimal solver program for LL cases again :). And 
with this help, it&#x27;ll just go through version after version, until 
we get it right, we are happy with it (my standards are kinda high), 
and it is near perfect.

At least I won&#x27;t have to worry about finding beta testers, after 
getting through these initial phases of the operation. Trust me, 
you&#x27;ll like it, I know I get good use out of the stack one sitting 
on my computer. Just imagaine, a few key-strokes and instantly a 
list of like 30 algs (amount depending on the specificallity of the 
search among other things), sortable in any of 3 metrics (might add 
in one more for completeness), complexity-value, trigger-
friendlyness... and a ton of cool stuff some of which I have already 
implemented server-side/back-end that I am keeping secret to suprise 
you all!!!

Let&#x27;s just say, I&#x27;d be shocked if someone can offer an idea for a 
capability I havn&#x27;t considered (difficult/impossible ones I might 
have considered and discarded).

          <div class="email-content">the 2 film companies were:

VS Films producing a documentary/movie about what it took to 
organize the event and to bring the cube back to life...

Second Company was Piper Productions who was shooting a documentary 
and a video for Seventowns.

there were many professional camera&#x27;s there. all spilt between the 2 
film companies....

as to the Magazine article. Its the New York Times magazine and I 
suspect it should be out(if excepted) with the next 2 months...


and yes i am still out of the country on vacation and i know i 
shouldnt be writing.......

looked over Richard&#x27;s Carr method but was again easily confused. <br>
<br>
So first off, before I go too nuts asking for help.  Does anybody know <br>
any other methods that I can look at that will possibly make things <br>
clearer?<br>
<br>
Anyway,  My problem begins after getting the cube into the L2R2F2B2UD <br>
group...I seem to have that down just fine.  After that I have trouble <br>
and it&#x27;s frusterating because he seems to have gone to great length to <br>
make things as clear as possible.  So I get the cube into the <br>
L2R2F2B2UD group and then my next goal is to permute them correct?  I <br>
have no trouble figuring out the numbers and all and I understand how <br>
to move them, but the problem is actually doing it.  This is hard to <br>
explain...suppose I have something like (1357)(28)(46)... am i wrong <br>
in thinking the first thing I&#x27;d want to do is to move 1 to 3 and 3 to <br>
5 and 5 to 1 so i&#x27;m left with (17)(28)(46)?  if that&#x27;s the case, is <br>
the objective to come up with my own series of moves to get 5 into <br>
positon where I can swap it, keep those moves in mind and undo them <br>
after I swap these three pieces?  Also, I don&#x27;t understand the <br>
calculation of the corner twist...I guess I see where he gets the <br>
numbers and how, but i&#x27;m somehow missing its significance.  What if <br>
it&#x27;s nonzero?  <br>
I might be way off on all this but i appreciate your patience and <br>
help...I&#x27;m really aiming immediately for a 2x2x2 solve (which is why <br>
there aren&#x27;t a billion questions about the edges ...yet.  I think this <br>
is just such a different way of thinking than ordinary solving that <br>
i&#x27;m just bogged down in the thoery of it...but i hope I can clear it <br>
up with help.<br>

<br>
I think an algorithm database would be a worthwhile tool to develop.  That <br>
type of database make me think of the pgn viewers that are used for chess <br>
databases.  Since cubing algorithms are virtually &quot;moves&quot; just like chess &quot;moves&quot; in <br>
the database.  I do not see any reason why a database cannot be created for <br>
all the &quot;moves&quot; to solve a Rubik&#x27;s cube.  You may even think of the various <br>
methods as different &quot;openings&quot; like in chess too.  Perhaps such a database would <br>
help cubers prepare for tournaments just like a grandmaster does for chess. <br>
<br>
I will look into these database options further, time permitting, as this is <br>
a very interesting idea.  The interface may actually be made using Macromedia <br>
Flash, as I am proficient with this tool.<br>
<br>
Perhaps more later....<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yep, they are all my puzzles. The photo was actually taken the day 
after the interview as their photographers were all busy elsewhere at 
the time. The journalist asked me how many puzzles I had (30-40, not 
sure exactly) and told me to bring a bagfull the next day for the 
photo. She sounded surprised when I said 30-40 puzzles, so I told her 
that was a pretty small number compared to many other people (eg. 
consider Sandy Thompson&#x27;s collection!). The 4x4x4 and the 3x3x3 I 
used in competition are in the foreground of the pic. :)

Re the geeky comment, I&#x27;m glad you found it funny. :) I reckon that 
*anyone* who admits to being a speedcuber has to admit to being a bit 
of a geek! :)

          <div class="email-content">Doug, do you know anyone (or someone who knows anyone?) who works at 
your local newspaper? If so, give them a call. I&#x27;m sure your 
newspaper would be interested if they knew. Even if you don&#x27;t know 
anyone there, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to call anyway. At worst, they&#x27;ll say 
they&#x27;re not interested in the story, but I reckon chances are that 
they will be interested! :)

By &#x27;all of us&#x27;, I actually meant &#x27;many of us&#x27;. According to lots of 
the early articles, there were around 100 people at RWC and we 
certainly haven&#x27;t seen 100 articles - although I think I&#x27;ve probably 
seen a dozen or so that mention Dan K! :)

See http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aicop (it&#x27;s in the links section).

It&#x27;s a big project and I can&#x27;t finish it by myself so I set it up 
recently. Currently my algorithm list has approx. 60,000 algorithms 
(a little shy of that). The first stage of the AICOP would be to 
increase that to about half a billion (in small stages).

The first few sub-optimal algorithms (a few edge 5-cycles not in the 
above c. 60,000) are already there if anyone wants to optimize a few.

          <div class="email-content"><br>
Blindfold cubing really is easier than people first imagine. For a <br>
2x2x2, what you need to do is first of all orient your corners (you <br>
could do that second but it&#x27;s less to think about doing it first) <br>
and then permute in an orientation preserving way.<br>
<br>
Each corner gets assigned an orientation 0, 1 or 2 depending on how <br>
many times you&#x27;d need to twist it (by 120 degrees) to get the U or D <br>
colour in the U or D face. (Sometimes 2 might be replaced by -1.) In <br>
fact, it is generally easier to think about this geometrically and <br>
work out pairs or triples to twist rather than remember the sequence.<br>
<br>
After orienting you should use 3-cycles to try and place most of the <br>
corners. Use 3-cycles in the U or D face - e.g. RB&#x27;RF2R&#x27;BRF2R2 - to <br>
place things without changing the orientations.You may be left with <br>
two corners to switch. For a 2x2x2, you can just use a move like U <br>
to get to 3-cycles again.<br>
<br>
Of course, there&#x27;s always the other option which would be to use my <br>
slightly more advanced blindfold system (not currently in general <br>
release, though some have seen advance copies of an intermediate <br>
version). This will permute your corners in one go (orientation <br>
preserving too), if they are evenly permuted.<br>
<br>
The cycle method is used by other people. I thought about developing <br>
something like that at one time but went for a work out as you go <br>
along approach. Dror is probably the most famous exponent of this <br>
other method. (Stiff hands&#x27; method.)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, that&#x27;s true. But I did e-mail the Detroit News and one of the 
popular local tv stations before the event (cuz I knew if I failed 
horribly that I wouldn&#x27;t get any attention from them), but I got no 
response at all... I think that interest in the Detroit area is just 
non-existant. I mean there wasn&#x27;t even anything about the wc in 
general. A few times there were full-page spreads about upcomming 
tourist attractions in Toronto, stuff about the good exchange rate 
and recent low prices due to SARS. They list like 40 things going on 
in the city from early Aug to Oct and NOTHING.

But I really don&#x27;t care too much about &quot;me&quot; not getting in, just 
annoyed at media reaserching, or should I say, lack thereof, that 
the WC in general didn&#x27;t get mentioned here (and I know, I checked 
frequently). Hemm... we all were being asked a lot of questions at 
WC that were not opionion-based, stuff they should have known if 
they did (or had people do) the proper reasearch - i.e. going to 
google and typing &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;. I know some of you were bothered 
by the media, I could just ignore it, but when they ask stupid 
questions like who was the last world-record holder? or who invented 
the Cube? etc. I pretty much would then have the urge to walk the 
other direction (facts are not good interview questions, and neither 
is having me predict the future).

Oh, trust me, there are or at least will be 100 articles if you 
count just before the wc also - maybe 20 of which on DanK (he 
deserves it of course). We need to take into account the articles in 
say Japan news papers or even something in Belgium, for which I 
still can&#x27;t find a translator program for (thanks LarsV). All the 
little articles add up, heck 100 is probably an under-estimate and 
probably 0 from my state of Michigan though (there was a local tv 
thing about Jon up north though).


-Doug

ps. sorry about all the lengthy posts I make, I tend to let my 
thoughts wander a bit and need something to do to break up my usual 
routine of spending 3-5 hrs a day writting proofs + 2-3 hrs of &quot;you 
know what....&quot;.
pps. I finally got to the geek quote in your article, I really like 
it, nice and subtle, and will have to use it sometime in front of my 
friends. IMHO you look better with glasses (to intensify the 
geekyness I suppose), I guess with them they could accidently 
capture the reflection of the camera though.

doing the final editing and stuff.

Richard (with the funny pronunciation) is of Very Small Films like 
DanG said (but abbriviated).

Michael: It&#x27;ll take up to a year to finish editing. Richard is doing 
a single 1hr cut and Allan is doing a 1hr cut and a 90min cut. 
Expect Richard&#x27;s to be finished first and IMHO, Allan&#x27;s team is the 
more professional of the 2 and will probably take the time to do 
really good editing esp. since Seven Towns are paying this team to 
do a video for them that they will be selling off rubiks.com.

          <div class="email-content">I can say that in the &quot;olden days&quot; the promotions preceding<br>
the original cube contests of 1981 to 1982 were mostly by<br>
Ideal Toy directly, at least in North America.<br>
<br>
My recollection is that People magazine had a full page ad<br>
for the American Rubik&#x27;s Cube-a-thon contest. Also Games <br>
magazine had a large ad describing all the regional contests<br>
in the U.S. Not sure if Games magazine mentioned WC2003.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t recall much in the way of promotions from newspapers<br>
before the contests occurred in Canada. There was some <br>
media after the fact, and Duc Trinh was mentioned in the<br>
Toronto Star.<br>
<br>
Asked the guy from New York Times magazine what his<br>
take was on cubing and he compared it to a Scrabble<br>
event he covered. <br>
<br>
This cycle was a lot different from 21 years ago when all<br>
the cubists herded into shopping malls. The cube was far<br>
more ubiquitous then but believe it or not I think the media<br>
&quot;got it&quot; a bit more this time around, and understood the cube<br>
was somewhat more than just a toy.<br>
<br>
Cube contests tend to occur in very large cities or areas<br>
with large academic institutions. There wasn&#x27;t any cube<br>
contest in Detroit in 1981 or 1982 as far as I know.<br>
<br>
At least with the internet people who are into the cube will<br>
find out about any contests, and I do think there will be<br>
more in the future.<br>

Just a bit too ambitious for me. Nice to know others out there have 
similar ideas though. But my goal is not to populate thousands and 
thousands of algs now. (I already have close to 8,000 done and will 
have about 10,000 by the time it is finished, more then one alg per 
case, already cornered the market on optimal ones and just need some 
really good sub-optimal ones that can be executed fast, i.e. Ron&#x27;s 
novel idea of 2-generators.) My goal is to make something that can 
be used by dozens of people world-wide, at the same time, and is 
user friendly. Btw, forgot to mention the whole possiblity of user 
accounts to track people&#x27;s preferences (metrics, left/right 
handedness, etc. (Hem, Jess might be some help here)).

To me yours doesn&#x27;t sound all that practical, well perhaps for BLD 
solving. A single collective LL alg db, is an intermediate step to 
all sorts of methods (for example I set up the back-end to easily 
filter and give OLL algs or ELL algs, or the wierd stuff some of the 
advanced are working on like COLL). For this reason, I hope it is of 
general interest to cubists our there.

If I don&#x27;t get help it will fail... And NO, under no circumstances 
will I just zip and post the entire back-end database on the net 
somewhere. It is my intellectual property, at least until someone 
else wants to contribute. Besides, it will be way cooler on the net 
dynamically. I am thinking of a feature where if a user sees 
their &quot;signature alg&quot; or contributes it, then they get to name it! 
Sort of like getting to name comets or newly discovered stars for 
amature astronomers.... I&#x27;ll have some pre-named ones like &quot;Sune,&quot; 
which we all know and love. I&#x27;m sure there are tons of cool ones out 
there waiting to be monopolized by us. I always called the Z-Perm 
alg, &quot;the DanK move&quot; (which I now know to be originated by Mirek). 
Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if in say 10 yrs, some newbee cuber knows an alg 
to be the &quot;&lt;yourname> move&quot;. That would just rock.

Well, the entire cube can be solved with 2 generators. You could try 
to solve the cube optimally like that. I&#x27;m shooting for a more 
standard set of generators.

My method will also be quite user-friendly. It will involve nice 
coding to identify a position to its algorithm.

BLD?
I&#x27;m after a one-step algorithm ultimately, but in the short term 
I&#x27;ll settle for a 3.5 or 4.5 step algorithm.

Fair enough - 10,000 isn&#x27;t too many anyway. I got 7,000 in one day 
so I&#x27;m sure that AICOP will be able to get through some algorithms 
fairly quickly.

I&#x27;m thinking more about names like (237,1053,12523,12485724) or 
something like that - (I haven&#x27;t checked to see if that is a 
consistent name, in the sense that the RIP codes are consistent, as 
I just typed it in but the general idea is there).

I&#x27;m doing it to solve a problem not for any of that other stuff. I 
don&#x27;t cube anymore so there&#x27;s not really any point in my trying to 
get moves named after me.

It&#x27;s closer to one every 12 seconds. I was running about 6 copies of 
CubeExplorer at once and they all had several cubes on the go. I 
have a lot of positions in the 14-16 area and quite a few 12-13 and 
17-18 too. I don&#x27;t have too many over 18 yet but I do have some 19s 
and of course the superflip is 20.

Yes, and there are already very tight bounds established for it in 
at least two diffent metrics. (probably 24 in QTM and 20-21 in HTM) 
I am not too interested in it from the computer science point of 
view, but would be interested in the mathematically rigorous ways of 
finding/proving it, which I don&#x27;t believe has been accomplished yet. 
I suppose you need the CS side to find then the math side to prove. 
But the actual coding of such a thing would be intersesting to see.

What do you mean exactly? A finite union of 2-generators?, then 
depending on how loosely you want it defined, that may be what is 
always done in normal solving, :). I don&#x27;t see how to solve the 
entire cube with two generators.... unless you are talking about two 
really lengthy guys: one that cycles all edges/corners in a certain 
way and one that say orients certain pieces (of course there are 
other ways), so I suppose it is doable. I was really aiming at 2-
generator meaning two adjcent &quot;basic turns&quot; like &lt;U,R>, and that is 
way I mentioned Ron there.

Not sure what you mean. BLD is short for blindfolded, the 
abbriviation has been used by others here, and since you are a 
master of the field I assumed you would understand it. In any case, 
it doesn&#x27;t seem like a &quot;fast&quot; method, that is with respect to 
recognition, I think many of you out there would agree that 
minimizing steps does not always increase speed (current popular 
speed methods are 6-8 steps). Of course it also sounds like you are 
not seeking for speed anymore though.

          <div class="email-content">Oh, come-on! Everybody deserves a one year buffer before being asked 
to divulge information like that. Shesshh..., he is just starting on 
it. Not everyone wants to monopolize methods and seek the perfect 
method like you. At least for me, the goal is to perfect the method 
I use and not at the expense of losing all originality of it. You 
have it great method, keep working on it and possible practice it 
yourself to the point of say sub-30. Which will finally validate 
your method(s). Or convince someone else to adopt it on a trial 
bases.

Besides, it is much more exciting this way. Since you are a man of 
methods, you can apprieciate the competition in this area. I&#x27;m sure 
it took you more then a month to prepare the method(s) showcased on 
your site.

I&#x27;m pretty sure all the fast guys are indeed working on new 
approaches, optimizations, and altering their systems not just their 
rate of execution and recognition. Btw, I am doing this.

&quot;Is it a secret weapon?&quot; I think we all know the answer to this one. 
In these times we all can use an &quot;Ace up our sleeves.&quot;

You probably just wanted another method to analyse intellectually 
and debate with others, which is fine. It&#x27;s just that that came off 
a little method-greedy.

          <div class="email-content">Well, my opinion is that in an average run, you can use lucky times. as i<br>
stated a few days back, with my solving method the chance of me getting a<br>
lucky time is 1 / 4, so in 12 runs, i&#x27;ll get 3 lucky cases on average.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Yes, and there are already very tight bounds established for it in <br>
&gt; at least two diffent metrics. (probably 24 in QTM and 20-21 in HTM) <br>
<br>
Those are only the lower bounds (for QTM it&#x27;s 26 since there is a<br>
position that requires 26 moves; for HTM I believe it&#x27;s still 20<br>
unless someone has recently found a position that requires 21 moves).<br>
 I believe the upper bound for the HTM is 29 (anyone have a solid<br>
reference to this?) and I&#x27;m not sure what the upper bound to the QTM<br>
is (but I vaguely remember 42; again a solid reference would be<br>

The weirdest thing just happened to me while i was trying to set some fast times. suddenly i <br>
found that the cube were in a position that was not possible. not solvable. one of the <br>
corner pieces had the wrong orientation. i must have rotated a corner piece while solving <br>
without getting a pop and without noticing. <br>

have anyone experienced that before ?<br>

          <div class="email-content">yes, thats quite common, especially if your cube is looser, but it happens
on all cubes. You will notice a snap sometimes, thats when it happens.

          <div class="email-content">potentially I guess, but you would have to be able to see what corner
rotation you need to do and why, and you would have to rotate more than one
corner in the correct orientation, so it is very unlikely.

You know I have a large collection of moves that I &quot;invented&quot; for
several solving systems when no computer program was available those
times. But actually this Z permutation I tought Dan K to perform was
not my invention. The move was computer generated and I am not aware
of anybody using it before 1997.
BTW, I am glad you name the permutation move by letter Z we&#x27;ve been
using with Jessica for 20+ years :-).

your wrong..........

richard(french pronounced)is not doing a video for seventowns.....he 
is doing a video for film festivals which is about my adventure 
bringing this puzzle back to competitve life...

Allans video will be out first as they have a deadline from 
seventowns..

seventowns has no control over richards documentary and i am in 
charge of it and i have the final editing decisions....

therefore guys and gals it will be a while before you all see 
anything.

&gt; I think it depends on how many times you get a lucky case. If you <br>
&gt; get five or so, then it won&#x27;t be a realaverage of your time. An <br>
&gt; average is supposed to represent the times you normally get. <br>
&gt; Yesterday I was doing a one handed average of 3, and I got a 41 and <br>
&gt; a 45, making the average 49, while I know I normally average around <br>
&gt; 53.<br>

&gt; Well, my opinion is that in an average run, you can use lucky <br>
&gt; times. as i stated a few days back, with my solving method the<br>
&gt; chance of me getting a lucky time is 1 / 4, so in 12 runs, i&#x27;ll get<br>
&gt; 3 lucky cases on average.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Terje<br>
<br>
Ah, we&#x27;ve finally come back to the discussion of lucky times and <br>
averages.  I personally don&#x27;t tend to put a lot of stock in single <br>
times, but rely more heavily on the average.  As Michael &amp; Terje <br>
already indicated, an average is supposed to be a measurement of your <br>
typical solving - your average.<br>
<br>
That said, if you are getting lucky cases, while taking an average, <br>
as frequently as you normally would, then I would say they should be <br>
kept in there, and averaged in.  If, on the other hand, you would <br>
typically get lucky cases 1/4, but get 2/4 or 3/4 while taking an <br>
average, then that&#x27;s probably a &quot;lucky average&quot;, and should be <br>
discarded, as would normally be done with a single lucky time for the <br>
purpose of comparison against other times.  Just as you would not (or <br>
at least should not) submit a lucky single time to any &quot;high score&quot; <br>
list (such as the UWR on SpeedCubing.com), you shouldn&#x27;t submit an <br>
average that is overly lucky - I suppose you could either drop the <br>
average altogether or drop some lucky cases (to get down to a more <br>
typical number of them).  This is a moot point with things like the <br>
Sunday Contest, where you are only provided enough mixing algs to do <br>
13 scrambles (providing for 1 pop).<br>
<br>
Regardless, I find that sometimes my lucky cases are my slower times, <br>
and some of my best times are not technically lucky (no steps of my <br>
solution skipped).  It&#x27;s these that make me wonder if the definition <br>
of luck (skipping a step of your solution that isn&#x27;t too commonly <br>
skipped) really hits it  - for example, what about when things just <br>
fall together well, even though it doesn&#x27;t cause any steps of your <br>
solution to be skipped?  This is where the definition of luck becomes <br>
questionable.  Even still, I figure when taking an average, it all <br>
averages out in the end.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think that you should include lucky cases in your averages.<br>
<br>
Firstly, you are recording an unofficial average, in which case you <br>
are only approximationg proper test conditions.  Do you put your <br>
cube down after inspection, and then pick it up when the timer <br>
starts?<br>
<br>
Secondly, you don&#x27;t throw out unlucky cases which may also skew your <br>
results.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, the concept of lucky or unlucky is irrelevant in an actual <br>
competition--your time is your time.<br>
<br>
Finally, within the unofficial times, there are 2 accepted versions <br>
of taking an average, one using whole seconds plus .5, or using <br>
100ths of a second and calculating a true average.  Couple this with <br>
the concept of &quot;rolling averages&quot;, and I am left with the impression <br>
that lucky times don&#x27;t seem to be that big of a deal.<br>
<br>
OTOH, if you are trying to get an accurate representation of your <br>
times, and you happen to sneak a lucky case past the fastest and <br>
slowest time elimination, you need to have a general idea of how <br>
frequently your &quot;lucky&quot; cases should happen.  If it happens more <br>
than 10% of the time, then it probably ain&#x27;t lucky.  If it happens <br>
to come up less than 10% of the time, then I would just make a note <br>
of it when posting a record.  <br>
<br>
What constitutes a lucky case is very dependent on the method you <br>
use, and how you choose to define a lucky case.  I use a corners <br>
first method (Guimond) to solve my corners, which requires 3 steps.  <br>
The number of setup moves necessary before step 1 and 2 can vary.  <br>
Frquently, I can skip the 2nd step.  When I finish the L and R face, <br>
and orient the M slice, I have a 1 in 12 chance of direct solving <br>
the M slice.  Furthermore, I can solve 3 edges in one face and <br>
inadvertently solve (I can do this on purpose more often as I get <br>
better) a few edges in the other face.  My lucky cases will be very <br>
differnt than someone who uses an F2L method.  Furthermore, we can <br>
start with the same scramble, and one of us will get a lucky case <br>
while the other won&#x27;t.  <br>
<br>
What would you do if you got a lucky case, were shocked by it, and <br>
therefore flubbed your time?  Would you still count it?<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&quot;Wrong&quot; is such an ugly word. I don&#x27;t like seeing it anywhere in 
this fourm. &quot;Not quite accurate&quot; seems more pleasing.

Yes, I said that Allan&#x27;s team has the association with Seven Towns
(perhaps it was stated awkwardly). I wasn&#x27;t aware of any deadlines, 
but I suppose it is implied since Seven Towns is going with them. 
The focus of Richard&#x27;s piece is narrower, so I expect him to be done 
firset even without deadlines.

You still never said when any of these 2 are expected to be 
finished. Since you mention a deadline, I presume you know what it 
is; care to share?

<br>
&gt; I just got my first Rubik&#x27;s Magic (4x2) today and solved it in an <br>

&gt; solving it considered just solving it from any 4x2 flat state or<br>
&gt; what?<br>
<br>
The records for the magic are done by starting at the unlinked rings <br>
rectangle state to the linked rings state. This makes it different <br>
from most of the other records on speedcubing.com as there is no <br>
thinking necessary - it is the same every time. I won at the world <br>
championships a few weeks ago with a time of 3.06 seconds (which <br>
includes time for picking it up).<br>
<br>
Different scrambled positions take such varying amounts of time to <br>
solve that you cannot reasonably compare one to the other. I would <br>
however like to see a Magic competition some time where every <br>
competitor starts with the same truly scrambled state.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m pretty sure that it is from one state to the other, so 
two &quot;solved&quot; positions as Yaap explained it. It usually goes from 
all 3 rings unlinked to 3 rings linked for the Regular Magic. Any 
position that looks funky with stuff out of line on both sides is 
therefore considered an intermediate position. Of couse making 
complicated looking 3-D shapes are always fun to do once you get 
bored with it...

It is really feasible to have sub-5s times here, I quickly learned a 
solutions to execute in under 15s (conservative estimate, never 
timed myself and don&#x27;t have one). I&#x27;d really like to learn how to 
string one though, but sadly don&#x27;t have the time for such things...

there frequently enough that they know my face by now. Anyway, I <br>
asked how he knew my name and he said he&#x27;d seen the RWC article in <br>

actually know my real name, its hilarious.  Its fun too, cause one of 
my friends brought a picture cube to school and thought i would never 
be able to solve it and i did.  
   But Whoever wrote the article did a pretty good job hunting down 
the info, she even took one of the pictures of me on the web off of 
someones collection of RWC photos!  The only problem was some of the  
stats weren&#x27;t correct.  And they made a super big deal about the 
Rubik&#x27;s magic which most people havent probably heard about.  Oh 
well, thats the joys of being under the limelight.   mmmmmmmm green

  &gt; Yes, and there are already very tight bounds established for it in <br>
  &gt; at least two diffent metrics. (probably 24 in QTM and 20-21 in HTM) <br>
<br>
  Those are only the lower bounds (for QTM it&#x27;s 26 since there is a<br>
  position that requires 26 moves; for HTM I believe it&#x27;s still 20<br>
  unless someone has recently found a position that requires 21 moves).<br>
  I believe the upper bound for the HTM is 29 (anyone have a solid<br>
  reference to this?) and I&#x27;m not sure what the upper bound to the QTM<br>
  is (but I vaguely remember 42; again a solid reference would be<br>
  appreciated).  That&#x27;s still a pretty wide gap between those numbers.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Rune,




They stand for Quarter Turn Metric and Half Turn Metric. They are 
different ways to determine the length of a move sequence. In the QTM 
a quarter turn of a face is counted as one move and a half turn of a 
face is counted as two moves. In the HTM both quarter turns and half 
turns are counted as one move. In both metric systems, slice moves are 
counted as two moves.

That is exactly what you do.

The twist of the corners is always 0, but the twist of the corners 
on the U or the F face may not be 0. Add them together and they 
always make 0. Look on the bottom of the theory page on my site to 
see an actual example. You don&#x27;t really need to know the twist of 
any face, it just might be interesting to know whether you can 
orient all the corners in the U face my just twisting the corners in 
the U face, and thus similarly the same for the D face. If you can 
do that for one then you can do that for the other. The determining 
factor for whether that is possible is that the twist of the corners 
on that face is 0. Anyway, as I said you don&#x27;t really need to know 
this.

The parity of the corners is also information you don&#x27;t need to 
predetermine, as all it informs you is whether yoe will need to do a 
swapping move that involves two corners and two edges at the same 
time, rather than just 3-cycles on corners and 3-cycles on edges. I 
like to determine that information so that I can remember the edges 
in the position that they will be once I have done that 
2corner+2edge swapping move if necessary rather than having to 
change my mental map halfway through solving.

I hope this is helping.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Just wondering if any of you use a system where you always solve <br>
the F2L<br>
&gt; pairs in the same order, like FL, FR, BL, BR.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I tend to just try to find the first one i see and then go for the <br>
next, but<br>
&gt; then i also use a lot of time looking usually.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Terje<br>
<br>
If you are going for speed, then restricting the improvisation in the <br>
F2L by doing them in order can only slow you down. I complete the F2L <br>
in about 20 so I am not an expert on the subject though.<br>
<br>
As for the extended look ahead time, try to do your F2L algorithms a <br>
little slower and look around the cube (physically too, look around <br>
the back of it at first). Another thing that helps is learning the <br>
algorithms with both hands for all four pair placements <br>
(FR/FL/BL/BR). This is a little weird at first, but with a little <br>
practice you&#x27;ll start to see how useful it is.<br>
<br>
I hope there&#x27;s something useful buried in this post. Good luck.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow, thanks for the explanation.  It&#x27;s very helpful to know my 
thinking is correct because it&#x27;s hard to keep moving forward when 
you&#x27;re not even sure you understand what you&#x27;re trying to do.  I think 
I have enough information now to try/practice doing the 2x2x2 and then 
hopefully moving on to the 3x3x3.  Thanks for your help.

swap two pairs of adjacent edges.

In diagrammatic form, it looks like this:

I think you can see why it is called Z, from this diagram.

  The reason I didn&#x27;t know the name &quot;Z permutation&quot; is that I don&#x27;t
use the methods and algorithms posted. I use a different strategy in
most cases, from what is commonly discussed.

  I&#x27;ve always called that the &quot;adjacent pair swap.&quot; What I was asking
for was the particular algorithym that Mirek taught Dan K.

  The alg I&#x27;ve use since 1981 is: r2 D b2 D&#x27; b&#x27; r2 b. (This notation
uses lower case letters for slices.)

  I was just curious about the alg used.

  Thanks,

          <div class="email-content">Wow, 1981, that&#x27;s a lot of cubing experience... But for that same 
reason you should of known about the Z-Perm. Generally I don&#x27;t use 
the mainstream methods either, but I am still aware of them and 
learned many of the techniques and algorithms in other people&#x27;s 
methods so that I can better talk about them and understand what 
others are talking about.

A few years ago when I first heard of the term &quot;Z-Perm&quot; I didn&#x27;t 
like it either, but what else would you call it. Now it sounds cool 
to me. The problem with your &quot;Adjecent Pair Swap&quot; naming is that 
that is really a more broad category of 5 distinct such cases when 
factoring in flip (I know the optimal algs fore each, btw). 

As for the actual algorithm, it is (with the LL on F): [13](RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)
(DR&#x27;D(U&#x27;))(R&#x27;UR)(D2&#x27;F). (Note the D2&#x27; as opposed to D2). I know it 
can be done in 2.1s average (first hand experience, :)).

Very interesting alg you have though (r2Db2D&#x27;b&#x27;r2b), don&#x27;t care for 
the lower case notation for slices, and I&#x27;m curious why you choose 
to identify with the B side instead of the F side (you use b instead 
of f2??). It&#x27;s far superior to any of the brute force once I used to 
use.... I think of this way as the finesse way of doing it, very 
much in the spirit of the H/+ Perm many of the advanced use.

The algorithm is R B&#x27; R&#x27; B F R&#x27; F B&#x27; R&#x27; B R F2 U ... and is usually executed
x&#x27; (R U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U)(D R&#x27; D U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U R)(D2 F)

          <div class="email-content">Hi d_,

   Thanks for the feedback,

   The project that I&#x27;m on is to develop entirely on my own. I don&#x27;t
want to end my project just because people have posted. I don&#x27;t know
how long it will take me to complete the 1200 or so LL algs, and the
other stuff I&#x27;m working on. 

   When I first discovered all the speedcube sites online I looked at
several of them. When I got to the fourth or fifth website I found an
algorithm that I didn&#x27;t know. That algorithm had been developed by a
computer program, and while that&#x27;s of interest, I really do want to
develop this stuff myself.

   Also, the strategies I use for the last level are different, not as
linear as what&#x27;s online. Sometimes I flip over edges while permuting
corners, and flip over corners while permuting edges. Some of what I
do is all over the map. I generally use 1, 2 or 3 looks on the LL. I&#x27;m
almost up to a complete 2 look set of algs, and partway to a one look.
Sometimes I spot the solution to the LL while still solving the F2L.

   For what I&#x27;m doing, learning the algs that other&#x27;s use would
interfere with what I&#x27;m doing.

   As for the name &quot;adjacent edge swap&quot; that&#x27;s just what I call it.
Unlike the notation idea I posted because of its simplicity and its
being less confusing to new cubists, I&#x27;m not suggesting any naming scheme.

   My notation allows for the f, l and d to be used for slices, but a
long time ago I chose to use the b to help keep straight which way was
clockwise on the B side. This makes it easier to relate to algs that I
write down.

   OK, what&#x27;s the H/+ Perm?

          <div class="email-content">Michael Atkinson, possible Lee June Kyo, and I are working on a one 
handed cubing site.  For now it will just a text page with tips and 
hints, but videos of different moves, move-combos, and finger tricks 
are on the way as well.  At the beginning, in my opinion at least, 
to get fast it is best to practice each and every turn R R&#x27; R2 L L&#x27; 
L2 F F&#x27; F2 B B&#x27; B2 D D&#x27; D2 U U&#x27; U2  from a standard grip (thumb on 
front face and middle finger on back face) and just get used to 
doing each move.  From there you can work on using whichever way 
feels best to your hands when doing the moves.  This will help 
increase your speed.  More to come on the one handed cubing site, 
but I would say for now the most important part is to get your hand 
used to manipulating the cube using only one hand.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone - I&#x27;m new here. I&#x27;ve been cubing for about four months <br>
now, and I use the Petrus method. I usually get the first two layers <br>
done in about 38-43 seconds, then the last layer in about 15-20 <br>
seconds more. I only know the basic last layer moves. From watching <br>
some videos, I think I could use a better cube (the one I&#x27;m using is <br>
main brand, one of the new ones, and it has had four months of use <br>
and silicone spray lubricant). I can&#x27;t really do finger tricks with <br>
it because it&#x27;s hard to move with one finger. I need to know if it&#x27;s <br>
worth the money to buy an original Ideal cube off Ebay or if I should <br>
just go with an Oddzon.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m thinking of switching to the Dan Knights method, but I only want <br>
to switch if it would improve my times. And if I do switch, I&#x27;m <br>
thinking about buying his speed solving video at the official site. <br>
http://www.rubikshop.com/cgi-<br>
bin/shop.cgi/SID=1063845788.20578.r/num=vidcls is the link to it, if <br>
you need to see what I&#x27;m talking about. Does anyone know if that&#x27;s a <br>
good video? Or do you think that I&#x27;m being too impatient, and that I <br>
should stick with the Petrus method? Thanks in advance.<br>

You can get quite far by just learning how to execute those few basic<br>
moves very fast.<br>
<br>
This was posted by Gilles Roux on the petrusmethod list recently:<br>
<br>
&gt; PS: I just had a 21.8s average with the basic method, 7 steps, 6<br>
&gt; last-layer sequences (2 for step 5, 1 for step 6, and 3 for step 7).<br>
<br>
It is true that a good cube would help to execute moves fast, and stop<br>
your wrists hurting. But if you just sand down the insides of your<br>
existing cube, wash it, then lubricate it, you&#x27;ll have a good cube.<br>
<br>
But even with a good cube, that probably won&#x27;t make you faster because<br>
most time is wasted looking for pieces, or just thinking of what to do<br>
next. You can improve recognition and response time by just practicing a<br>
single step over and over again. I&#x27;m sure it is possible to get times in<br>
the low 20s without using finger tricks. (Does anyone want to verify<br>
this?)<br>
<br>
Also, try this: time how long it takes to do each step on average, but<br>
excluding thinking time. In other words, we are measuring &quot;execution&quot;<br>
time. For example, for petrus step 2, allow yourself to preinspect and<br>
think up a solution. After you have a plan for solving step 2, then<br>
start the timer. If you add up the execution times for each step, you<br>
should get a total time much less than the time it really takes you to<br>
solve the cube. The difference between these two times tells you how<br>
much time you waste looking for pieces and thinking of what to do next.<br>
<br>
&gt; Or do you think that I&#x27;m being too impatient, and that I <br>
&gt; should stick with the Petrus method? Thanks in advance.<br>
<br>
You&#x27;re already under 60 seconds after only 4 months! That&#x27;s very good,<br>
so I&#x27;d just say you&#x27;re too impatient :-) Maybe you can be under 50<br>
seconds in another month. Learning to do the last layer fast (with a<br>
good cube) can also be a good safety net.<br>

Actually &quot;only cuber&quot; is a fair assestment, it&#x27;s almost like 0-2 in

If there&#x27;s another cuber in my state, I know about it; it&#x27;s

&gt;    Also, the strategies I use for the last level are different, not as<br>
&gt; linear as what&#x27;s online. Sometimes I flip over edges while permuting<br>
&gt; corners, and flip over corners while permuting edges. Some of what I<br>
&gt; do is all over the map.<br>
<br>
This is in my opinion the best way to do things. All over the map!<br>
<br>
And I think by finding all of the algorithms yourself, you have<br>
increased your ability to handle such a method. I have always regretted<br>
turning to the Helmstetter index for the last layer, and now I am<br>
rebuilding those algorithms from scratch, by hand.<br>
<br>
&gt; I generally use 1, 2 or 3 looks on the LL. I&#x27;m<br>
&gt; almost up to a complete 2 look set of algs, and partway to a one look.<br>
&gt; Sometimes I spot the solution to the LL while still solving the F2L.<br>
<br>
Can you do this for the edges and corners simultaneously? I can do it<br>
sometimes for the corners (because my edges are already solved). One<br>
thing I often do as I&#x27;m inserting the last corner on the first layer, if<br>
I see the opportunity, is to change those moves slightly to make another<br>
corner fall into place on the top. Sometimes I get lucky, and the other<br>
3 corners fall into place too.<br>
<br>
The other thing that can happen as you&#x27;re finishing the first two layers<br>
is that by chance you come within 5 or 6 moves of a solved cube. If you<br>
can see it, you can guide the pieces carefully into their home, and skip<br>
the rest of your usual steps. This has happened to me about 3 times this<br>
year. Does it happen to anyone else?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Something that Chris told me once that helped is try to hold the cube 
with as few fingers as possible, and turn the faces with as many as

dropped about 5-10 seconds at least.
Also, how fast can you go two handed? This, of course, makes a 
difference.

          <div class="email-content">Hey, I bought dan knights &quot;the simple solution&quot; video. the video <br>
itself is pretty corny but the sheet that comes with it with all the <br>
algorithms and pictures is what&#x27;s worth the money. I&#x27;ve only had it <br>
for about a month and a half and ive gotten my averages to about 52-<br>
52 seconds. my best is a non lucky 39.75. I use dan knights timer <br>
under that you can get from the files link on this website. I spend <br>
soo much time with my cube though. I put so many hours in a week <br>
with a cube. so it might take you longer to get under a minute <br>
averages but its a cool method. i like it. a lot to memorize though. <br>
i havent even bothered with the f2l yet. i do that the 3 step way. <br>
ive been working on the last layer so i can do it in 2 steps most of <br>
the time. Btw the video will teach you how to read the notation and <br>
stuff if you dont know how, i know when i first saw the notation it <br>
looked pretty confusing and i didnt get it. so yea i reccommend the <br>
video. good luck. if you get it write back and tell me what you <br>

          <div class="email-content">Ryan makes an excellent point. I agree that doing it all yourself is 
the best way to to do things, that is to have a deeper, solidified 
understanding of the cube.

And about Ryan&#x27;s observation: Yes I too notice that, I think it 
occures about as often for me. It happens when I focus in on the LL 
edge flip as I do the final step of my F2L method.

I&#x27;m not quite sure what you mean by &quot;develop&quot;. According to Jessica, 
many algorithms were found by trial-and-error (taking down c/e pairs 
and puting them back in differently), this was especially true in 
the days before fast optimal crunching programs. For me, I got most 
of my algorithms from other sources at the beginning. I did 
some &#x27;developing&#x27; by learning the full effects of those algs 
(usually short and sweet ones) and the effects when applied twice, 
one after the other from different roations/mirrors/inversions. Then 
I went through a phase of batch running optimizer programs to find 
optimal and sub-optimal algs for each detailed case to for a 
particular set (I chose to do CLL and ELL)....

> > OK, what&#x27;s the H/+ Perm?

That would be swaping 2 pairs of edges across/opposite without 
fliping them. Jessica&#x27;s naming scheme gives it as H, while I prefer 
to use the + symbol as it looks similar to the diagram.

> > Some of what I do is all over the map. I generally use 1, 2 or 3 
looks on the LL.

Yes, similarly here... except I&#x27;m more predictable, down to about 
1.8 looks currently... and by looks I mean algs. When and if we ever 
get a universal terminologies page setup as Macky suggested last 
month, that would be one of the things I want, that is people 
shouldn&#x27;t be using &quot;algs&quot; and &quot;looks&quot; interchangably it blurs the 
meaning for the lower level cubists. I can always solve the LL in 
one look... but usually in 2 algs... unless it&#x27;s one of those days 
where I just keep messing up over and over do to poor recognition.

> > For what I&#x27;m doing, learning the algs that other&#x27;s use would
interfere with what I&#x27;m doing.

No, that is a completely unqualified statement. In almost all cases 
our sub-goals overlap to some degree... For example, almost all of 
us have the intermediate LL step. (eh..., obviously not CF 
people :), but even then their later edge fiddling step overlaps 
with my CLL).  Now in this particular case, I doubt you&#x27;ll 
infrequently run into the so-called Z-Perm, I mean come-on! This is 
unless of course you go through an end/near-end step of doing in-
place flips of the edges, lol. That&#x27;d be time-consuming from my 
experience.

So in conclusion, seeing how other people do it is enlightening and 
something that shouldn&#x27;t be avoided forever (you&#x27;ve been cubing for 
over 20yrs David). We&#x27;ll be able to better mutually help each other 
that way...

          <div class="email-content">These 2 posts remind me that I should keep you guys aprised of my 
situation here. One year ago I wanted to form a cube club on my 
campus and had little to no success.

After RWC, I think I need to get one going, esp. with all my friends 
pushing for it. Now I don&#x27;t know if Purdue has one yet, I mean what, 
Justin taught over 60 students how to do it and probably a bit more 
counting the indirects. (Or they have it just unofficially?) So 
Justing might have some advice on this topic. MIT must no longer 
have one after Cube-Lovers died out. I am just in the process of 
formalizing one here at U-Mich.

I&#x27;ve pertty much got all the signatures I need (for purposes of 
officalization and getting funds) and should have that cleared up by 
the end of the week. I&#x27;ll have my other &quot;founding memebers&quot;/cube 
friends put up flyers (like 100s) over the weekend for a mass-
meeting the following Thursday (not sure what time yet). I have 
about 10 friends seriously interested so it won&#x27;t be too lame at 
worst.

But I&#x27;m not sure, do I really want like 200 people showing up or 
just a small geeky-group? (Either way, a few girls wouldn&#x27;t 
hurt, :).) Of course the main issue I&#x27;m concerned with is how do I 
convene it without sounding all arrogant and cube-mighty? I think 
what I&#x27;ll do is have my friends introduce me and I&#x27;ll &quot;just, not 
demonstrate my cubing.&quot; (Wouldn&#x27;t want to intimidate those that 
can&#x27;t even solve it yet; my sub 2-min friends will be impressive 
enough.)

So the root of the confusion is that my fundamental goal 
was &quot;simply&quot; to drum-up interest and awareness on campus about speed-
cubing, but there is some uneasyness about converting a large number 
of people sub 90s. See... some of you may not completely realize it, 
but we are very powerful. Our individual knowledge of the cube might 
seem like nothing to ourselves or compared to that of the collective 
cube community, but we understand the cube well enough to teach 
others how to solve it in under say 90s quite rapidly. I was shocked 
when I got my friend (non-technical major) from no-exp to sub-50s in 
only 5 weeks and some other ones with varying amounts of success due 
to less time spent.

I suppose that the enigma come from the fact that speedcubing is 
externally thought of as an exclusive type of almost elitist society 
(the coolest among all geeks). Of course since we are apart of it, 
we know that we are in actuality very nice people, just look at RWC. 
We all want to help each other and similarly we&#x27;d want to help 
newcommers to the field. It is in some ways better for there to be 
fewer members, it makes us more unique, if you will. But there are 
so many amazing aspect of the cube, I can&#x27;t help but try to share 
with others.

So basically I&#x27;m looking for your takes on the balance of 
exclusivity vs. expanding our community. Any ideas about running 
local/school cube clubs properly would be apprieciated also.

That is, a HT-slice in the QTM is counted as four moves. Quite a lot!

  Hi Rune,




  They stand for Quarter Turn Metric and Half Turn Metric. They are 
  different ways to determine the length of a move sequence. In the QTM 
  a quarter turn of a face is counted as one move and a half turn of a 
  face is counted as two moves. In the HTM both quarter turns and half 
  turns are counted as one move. In both metric systems, slice moves are 
  counted as two moves.

   Yeah, sometimes.

  After I get a better handle on the LL. I intend to work on just that.

  The 2x2x2 is great for developing that and a corner&#x27;s first
appproach. I looked for about six years to find the 2x2x2 cube with no
luck. Local game stores refused to special order anything, I couldn&#x27;t
find it with a 200 mile radius. Ticked me off. Now I have a few,
thanks to the internet.

   That&#x27;s how Jessica works. I don&#x27;t use trial an error. I&#x27;ll show you
what I mean by &quot;develop.&quot;

   For example: I figured that if I moved a slice up, say r, onto the
Up side, and rotated that side 180 degrees, U2, then pulled the slice
back down, r&#x27;, and rotated the Up side back, U2, that I would exchange
3 edge pieces in a line.
   I looked at the possibility, pictured how to do it, did it and it
worked. r U2 r&#x27; U2.  There was no error.
   I figured I could substitute another edge not in that line for one
of those edge pieces in a line, like R2 D&#x27; and that worked. I then
figured I could line them up using the Up side in stead of the Down
side and that worked, and that&#x27;s how I arrived at the alg I use for
swapping three edges on the LL.

   I call that the &quot;opposite edge pair swap&quot;. At first I used an 8
move alg then I developed a 7 move alg.

   I don&#x27;t use &quot;algs&quot; and &quot;looks&quot; to mean the same thing. If often use
one look and two algs because I know what the second algorithm is
going to be.

   The qualification is that it applies to me. I didn&#x27;t make a blanket

Hi all,

Does anyone know what the &quot;S&quot; means in this notation Uï¿½S&#x27;F S F S&#x27;F&#x27;S
F&#x27;Uï¿½ ?

Thanks.

I got it from http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/L1/eptr.htm, it 
is the algorithm number seven from bottom to top

Indeed, as written, it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  It seems that if you <br>
change the U to a D, and the S to and M, it has the desired effect:<br>

D²M&#x27;F M F M&#x27;F&#x27;M F&#x27;D²<br>

I can fully break in an Oddzon cube in no longer then 2 months to 
the same feel as my main cubes.

It&#x27;s all about sitting around and putting a few hundred half turns 
on each face... repeat if necessary. (with lube completely washed 
off)

fasinating topic... The page explains the &#x27;s&#x27; notation but not 
the &#x27;S&#x27; one, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re interchangable. I found that 
page enlightinging though. Thanks to Grant for fixing it to our 
standard notation. I have another algorithm for this case on my web 
site, it uses heavy slicing and is I feel that makes it faster.

Oh and warning, I used the inverted M/M&#x27; notation. I finally caved 
and decided that having standards in this community is more 
important that what I think. I&#x27;m now using the correct M/M&#x27; notation

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan H,

   I have two problems with your notation.

   First it isn&#x27;t intuitive. Below you say the S slice is the layer in
between F and B, which says nothing about the direction of a turn.

   Second it is counter-intuitive. Not only do you use lower case for
the larger movement, you also use one letter to designate moving two
layers, and you do that twice!

   I&#x27;m with Dan G that the simpler, more intuitive notation is the way
to go.

   Why adopt such a clumsy system? Because you&#x27;re used to it? You
would switch in a moment to an alg that was easier, why not a easier
notation?

          <div class="email-content">Hi, <br>
<br>
Although I use slice moves, I often get confused M, S, E. <br>
<br>
M and RL&#x27; does same thing but the center moves with M. <br>
To describe the detail, we had better to have some notations <br>
represent slice moves. <br>
<br>
I would suggest <br>
<br>
M (=M),  W (=M&#x27;), <br>
V (=S), A (=S&#x27;)<br>
&gt; (=E), &lt; (=E&#x27;) ,<br>
instead. <br>
<br>
It is confusing to determine CW or CCW for slices. <br>
<br>
How do you think guys?<br>
Since this is new idea, it may be more confusing. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes Mike, I did almost start a cube clube at my old high school (I switched starting this year as a junior).

          <div class="email-content">Good points all. I just want to add that I don&#x27;t think any <br>
statistician would recommend subjectively classifying your solves <br>
lucky/unlucky as a way to get more representative data. There are two <br>
ways to do that.<br>
<br>
1. Get bigger samples. Averages of 10 are much more respected than <br>
single times, for good reason. If that still doesn&#x27;t get good enough <br>
data, you should increase the sample. Take an average of 25 or 50. We <br>
could get into standard deviation and margin of error here, but let&#x27;s <br>
not...<br>
<br>
2. More sophisticated math. Disregarding off the highest and lowest <br>
times is one way to reduce the influence of freak events. You can <br>
drive that further. If you remove the top and bottom 5 times from a <br>
12 solution run you get the median value, which is often used for <br>
that purpose.<br>
    But then you need to be aware that you&#x27;re measuring something else <br>
than the average does. One cuber can have a lower average than an <br>
other but a higher median. Which one is the better cuber? It <br>
completely depends on your point of view.<br>

&gt;I think that you should include lucky cases in your averages.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Firstly, you are recording an unofficial average, in which case you<br>
&gt;are only approximationg proper test conditions.  Do you put your<br>
&gt;cube down after inspection, and then pick it up when the timer<br>
&gt;starts?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Secondly, you don&#x27;t throw out unlucky cases which may also skew your<br>
&gt;results.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Thirdly, the concept of lucky or unlucky is irrelevant in an actual<br>
&gt;competition--your time is your time.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Finally, within the unofficial times, there are 2 accepted versions<br>
&gt;of taking an average, one using whole seconds plus .5, or using<br>
&gt;100ths of a second and calculating a true average.  Couple this with<br>
&gt;the concept of &quot;rolling averages&quot;, and I am left with the impression<br>
&gt;that lucky times don&#x27;t seem to be that big of a deal.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;OTOH, if you are trying to get an accurate representation of your<br>
&gt;times, and you happen to sneak a lucky case past the fastest and<br>
&gt;slowest time elimination, you need to have a general idea of how<br>
&gt;frequently your &quot;lucky&quot; cases should happen.  If it happens more<br>
&gt;than 10% of the time, then it probably ain&#x27;t lucky.  If it happens<br>
&gt;to come up less than 10% of the time, then I would just make a note<br>
&gt;of it when posting a record. <br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;What constitutes a lucky case is very dependent on the method you<br>
&gt;use, and how you choose to define a lucky case.  I use a corners<br>
&gt;first method (Guimond) to solve my corners, which requires 3 steps. <br>
&gt;The number of setup moves necessary before step 1 and 2 can vary. <br>
&gt;Frquently, I can skip the 2nd step.  When I finish the L and R face,<br>
&gt;and orient the M slice, I have a 1 in 12 chance of direct solving<br>
&gt;the M slice.  Furthermore, I can solve 3 edges in one face and<br>
&gt;inadvertently solve (I can do this on purpose more often as I get<br>
&gt;better) a few edges in the other face.  My lucky cases will be very<br>
&gt;differnt than someone who uses an F2L method.  Furthermore, we can<br>
&gt;start with the same scramble, and one of us will get a lucky case<br>
&gt;while the other won&#x27;t. <br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;What would you do if you got a lucky case, were shocked by it, and<br>
&gt;therefore flubbed your time?  Would you still count it?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Just some thoughts.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody!
Did you hear that 3x3 cube behaves similarily to atoms with their 
electrons? The relationships between electrons and their &quot;spins&quot; 
(flips) are also very much dependent on others. From this point of 
view the QTM is, I think, the most natural metric for this, and not 
only this cube.
I think QTM should be used averywhere as the base to any other 
metrics and comparisons.
In fact since over 20 years I was used to that metric and believe me 
I needed much time to change my habits when I first saw another as 
the base on the internet.
Of course every alg is different, but do you really want to say, that 
there is no difference in time making R and R2? Are you sure?
For those, who are so sure let&#x27;s make a test. All of us know the 
unofficial record of the maximum number of moves made in one minute 
(876 - Nathan Christie). Can anybody do the same number of double 
moves? Can anybody do 438 at least?
The same with slice moves.

I want to suggest that maybe we should use QTM as the base because of 
its nature and, from practical point of view, time needed for making 
double moves and slices.

really great. I was waiting for this event 21 years.<br>
I don&#x27;t want to be bored. To all your earlier messages concerning <br>
RWC2003 I want to add my &quot;trzy grosze&quot; (read: [tchi groshe]; means: <br>
two cents).<br>
I want to thank DanG very much. Thanks to him Wiktoria did not give <br>
up before championships and was with us.<br>
Do you remember that DanG generally is a great speedcuber, not a <br>
judge? Who of you, let&#x27;s say from top twenty speedcubers list, would <br>
be able to SACRIFICE him/her? You better don&#x27;t answer. This is a <br>
rhetorical question.<br>
I want to thank RVB - thanks to him I&#x27;ve got free 4x4 and 5x5 cubes.<br>
Wiktoria thanks you all for your friendship, especially YOU DanH and <br>
DavidW.<br>
Grazyna wants to thank Michal and Wojtek Fulmyk for your company. <br>
Thanks to you Grazyna didn&#x27;t have to remain silent (she doesn&#x27;t speek <br>
English) and could learn much about Toronto and Canada.<br>
I want to thank Katsu - we&#x27;ve got a great day of Monday, when we were <br>
together on NiagaraFalls.<br>
I want to thank Everybody that I don&#x27;t call by name - you all are <br>

          <div class="email-content">All valid points, but what about comparing something like R&#x27;U (or 
even worst RU) to say R2? I think we all know what would happen if 
we timed a repitition of say 100 of each....

What about certain &quot;fractional metrics&quot; from the stand point of 
computer optimization I have had to consider it sometimes. In 
building the back-end of my database, I played around with 
certain &quot;funny-looking&quot; metrics.

For example I made up DTM (D for Doug, so if this looks like 
something someone else already thought of please tell me) where 
something like R2L&#x27; is treated as length 1 for the purposes of 
optimization. This is sort of 2 steps farter in the direction of 
STM. (The intermediate of DTM and STM is something I found on 
Jessica&#x27;s site ATM (A for anti-slice) where R2L&#x27; is 2 and L&#x27;R&#x27; is 
one.) So know I count FIVE &quot;integer&quot; metrics. What about D[x] for x 
an element of closed interval [0,1] (an off set of DTM) where R2L&#x27; 
is 1.5 turns in D[1/2](for the purposes of optimization)? (D[0]==DTM 
D[1]==HTM) These so-called &quot;fractional metrics&quot; generate a lot of 
nifty counting schemes. Now consider a function (let&#x27;s keep it 
simple: polynomial) of these things....

What do you (any of you) think is the best one? Of course this will 
probably depend on one&#x27;s style.

I thought of this stuff over a year ago... man, where has my life 
gone.


-Doug (sitting around for the past 12 hrs locked in my room writing 
proofs. grrr trying to avoid the use of generalized nullspaces in 
proving something about characteristic polynomials of restrictions 
on linear operators to T-invariant subspaces.... :) )

Aside from confusion, it doesn&#x27;t help that people have different 
meanings of these slices (i.e. which slice is represented and which 
direction of movement).

I understand the &lt; and > - the horizontal slice is moved left or 
right.  I would think V and A should correspond to M and M&#x27;, 
respectively, being the &quot;down&quot; or &quot;up&quot; move of the other slice that 
goes through F.  Perhaps for the sake of having something &quot;point&quot;, 
you could use the ^ symbol (Shift+6), instead of A.  M and W leave me 
completely confused, though.

I personally prefer the lower case notation, using lower case to 
indicate slices only.  A turn of the slice between R and L would be 
r, r&#x27;, l or l&#x27;.  I prefer this over using single lower case to 
indicate a slice &amp; face turn, but I suppose that&#x27;s just my personal 
preference.  I suppose one downfall of this notation would be what to 
do when talking about a 5x5x5 cube - it works with a 4x4x4, but not 
anything larger than that.  Opinions?

<br>
I am moving into my accommodation at University this weekend, and so I am going to have trouble with my Internet access and web hosting for a short while.<br>
<br>
I have launched the FMC results for the 12/09/03, but shan&#x27;t be launching a new scramble until I can get online again (probably Monday). My other big problem is finding another host for the website, since my ISP (ntl) won&#x27;t allow me to connect to it&#x27;s ftp space whilst I am not on an ntl connection.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sorry for the inconvenience, but hopefully everything should definitely be back to normal this time next week!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi - I&#x27;m new to the community and many thanks to Chris for letting <br>
me know it exists.<br>
<br>
As a first, but hopefully not last, post I&#x27;d like to congratulate <br>
Chris on breaking my ancient world record for one handed cube <br>
solving.  A phenomenal time and I know it can be hard to hold your <br>
nerve too.<br>
<br>
Its 20 years since I spent any real time on the cube so it seems <br>
pretty unlikely I&#x27;ll be contending to get the record back.  <br>
Nevertheless because Chris kindly took the time and effort to find <br>
me out and let me know it has rekindled my old interest a little so <br>
I hope to keep in touch and follow events from here.<br>
<br>
Its great to see such interest in cubing.  Things have changed a lot <br>
I think since the early 1980&#x27;s.  Can anyone point me in the <br>
direction of the rules you use for speed solving, one handed solving <br>
and behind the back/blindfold solving (we used to distinguish <br>
between these - do you?)?  Do you get some &quot;look&quot; time ahead of <br>
solving in the speed events - and how much &quot;look&quot; time do you get <br>
behind the back?<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Seems like a lot of people think it takes too much time. It does if 
you want to get good, but just to know how to solve it is easy 
enough. You could probably learn how to do it in an hour or so, if 
you used the simplest method.

As far as I know, blindfolded and behind the back are the same. I 
don&#x27;t do blindfolded, though, so I&#x27;m not positive.
And before speed solving, you get 15 seconds to inspect the cube. 
But for the blindfolded, the time starts when you start inspecting 
the cube, then you put the blindfold on while the time is still 
ticking, and solve it.

          <div class="email-content">I was going to buy an Oddzon cube at Target, but they didn&#x27;t have 
one. They did have a Milton Bradley one, which I took out of the 
package to try out. That cube straight out of the package was nearly 
just as good as my old one. Needless to say, I bought it. It actually 
turns faster, but it isn&#x27;t as smooth as my other one. I&#x27;m sure it 
will be perfect once it gets broke in a little and I sand it. It&#x27;s 
probably about as good as an Oddzon, but I&#x27;ve never used an Oddzon so 
I can&#x27;t actually compare them.

Can someone tell me what I should do when the stickers wear off? I 
tried paint on my last one and hated it, then scraped it off a few 
days later. It has tiles on it now, but I don&#x27;t like the feel of it 
with every square being raised up. So hopefully I can find something 
I&#x27;ll like for my new cube.

          <div class="email-content">Definitely the best sticker substitute is vinyl tape. I can&#x27;t find it 
anywhere in my town, but I live in a tiny one. Probably at some 
Wal*Mart you can get some. And from what I&#x27;ve heard, you get enough 
tape for about a million cubes.

          <div class="email-content">#1. Good lube question, not that it really matters since most 
silicone perform about the same.

#2. Lube your cube if it&#x27;s stiff!!

#3. We were informed by other member that they would not be Studio 
cubes BEFORE wc (read the posts). I wasn&#x27;t paying close attention to 
those cubes there, but I&#x27;d doubt were.

Did you find those cube really great? I didn&#x27;t think they were 
fantastic speedcubes, decent enough to use, but nothing that 
absolutely suprised me.

It is a normal Rubik.com cube and not a Rubik&#x27;s Studio cube (they 
have they have the 1980 logo and strong stickers. I gues they used 
the Rubiks.com lubricant, this lubricant does not work well at low or 
high temperatures only at room temperature. It might be that you 
stored to cube in the sun this will have effect on this kind of 
lubricant.
 
You should clean the cube and lubricate it with silicone spray.

I am busy to order Studio Cubes and I hope I can offer them to 
everyone real soon

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody.<br>
I&#x27;ve been asked to give my oppinion on a Rubik&#x27;s cube java<br>
game for <br>
mobile phones made by ikkyou.<br>
Has any of you tried this cube?<br>
<br>
Anyway I wanted to get some oppinions from you about the button <br>
configuration.<br>
You look at the cube from the corner so you can see two sides and the <br>
top.<br>
The back sides are displayed behind the cube.<br>
<br>
In the game the configuration is like this:<br>
You can switch between directions.<br>
But when you set the arrows to clockwise the sides will turn in the <br>
direction you see on the screen, not all clockwise according to our <br>
system.<br>
<br>
1 will make turn L&#x27;<br>
2 will turn the vertical layer next to it in same direction (away <br>
from you)<br>
3 will make turn R<br>
<br>
4 will make turn U<br>
5 will turn horizontal layer same direction<br>
6 will make turn D&#x27;<br>
<br>
7 will make turn F<br>
8 will turn the vertical layer next to it in the same direction <br>
(towards you)<br>
9 will make turn B&#x27;<br>
<br>
*, 0 and # will turn the whole cube<br>
<br>
I think this is a straight forward and categoric way for none-cubers <br>
to do a notation for a screen cube, but for cubers who have a <br>
standardized notation I think it&#x27;s confusing.<br>
I have suggested this:<br>
<br>
When you switch between clockwise and counterclocwise, the sides <br>
should turn the right way according to our notation.<br>
<br>
The buttons:<br>
1 should turn L side<br>
3 should turn B side<br>
7 should turn F side<br>
9 should turn R side<br>
2 should turn U side<br>
8 should turn D side<br>
<br>
All (real) clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the arrows<br>
4, 5 and 6 should turn centerslides (in some order)<br>
*, 0 and # should turn the whole cube (as it is)<br>
<br>
What is your oppinion?<br>
<br>
<br>

cubing. I sometimes do something like that, and my fingers hurt for a

   I bit the bullet and bought a mini 4x4x4 from meffert&#x27;s, despite <br>
my problems in past experience.  I just couldn&#x27;t beat their prices <br>
with the free shipping.  Showed up almost exactly a week later (maybe <br>
6 days, I can&#x27;t remember) and the order was perfect.  Got a mini <br>
4x4x4 and a transparent assembly cube (the girlfriend loves it).  The <br>
mini 4x4 works like a champ, it&#x27;s so light and tiny in my hands, I <br>
love it.  Probably going to order the mini 5x5 next month some time.<br>

after it arrived, my first average on a 2x2 nontheless. And the 
textured pyraminx was pretty good also. The silver stickers keep 
comming off and I&#x27;ve had to just about reglue all of them, as they 
natuarally fall out, though. The red felt side doesn&#x27;t appear to 
actaully be felt or artificial fur but some type of spongy rubber. 
It turns very well though, but I have yet to perfect a good number 
of finger tricks on it. Green and blue arn&#x27;t too easily decernable 
though when I&#x27;m playing it in the dark (always have to use my nails 
and run through in two orthogonal directions).

As with my other puzzles I am always interested in how to take them 
apart incase I want to lube individual pieces and set them out to 
dry before assembly or just to learn about a new mechanism. I&#x27;m sure 
the Eastsheen 2x2 mechanism differs from the regular ones to some 
degree and am curious...., wondering if it&#x27;d be possible to 
incorporate springs into the design to pitch an idea to Mefferts for 
a truly world-class 2x2.

I&#x27;m also hoping there will be an official 2x2x2 competition at the 
next WC. I realize that it is very simple, but then again is the 3x3 
compared to the 4x4 or 5x5... I bet corners first guys like Ron, 
David Allan, Gene, DanG, and Gaétan would ROCK at it aside from of 
course Akimoto. Hemmm...., why in the world did Gaétan from Montreal 
NOT come to WC? This would just add a new dimension to the WC 
experience.... One-handed and blindfolded sure did, we can all 
agree!!!

It was reasoned that the 2x2 was too simple to do as a category or 
that not enough interest was there so I just want to say now, while 
it is early that I&#x27;d love to register for it. Of course hopefully by 
then I&#x27;d be into a ton of other cube/not-quite-cube related things 
and be begging the organizers to spread the event into more than TWO 
days. On second thought, much more than 2...

Just to keep you all updated on my local cube club... I am in the 
process of planning out how to fill a half-hour (was origianlly to 
be an hr) for the mass-meeting, which, due to the amount of 
publicity I have decided to put into it, at least 200 students 
(maybe a few profesors) will show up for. (Hopefully not more since 
the place I reserved won&#x27;t handle more.) Ok..., introductions should 
take 5-10 minutes... but what then? I am new at this type of stuff. 
I certainly can&#x27;t just keep solving the cube for minutes on end, 
actually I hope not to have to solve it at all. I&#x27;ve prepared a 
basic method to pass out, but too bad not everyone owns a cube :(. 
But I still need more ideas (like a speech). So if anyone has got 
ideas for me, I&#x27;m listening.

Oh and also, I think you guys will find this funny. I posted over in 
the &quot;exclusive&quot; 4D cube club and had the following response: &quot;What 
do you mean by RWC?&quot; Omg, that just shows how one of them is living 
in the shadows...

So faith in Meffert&#x27;s is comming back slowly. Oh forgot to mention 
the imperfectly centered stickers, but I didn&#x27;t cae about that too 
much.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, Allan,

I am a cube artist specializing in 3d  cube art. I was the only 
exhibitor at the WC, but that was not my fault. I would have 
*welcomed* other cube artists. Unfortunately, as I found on the web, 
there are two  other sources of cube art, but  they are 2d, not 3d. 
BTW, 2d means two dimensional, or picture-like structures, and  3d 
means three dimensional, or sculpture-like structures. As you might 
expect, 3d cube art is considerably more dificult  than 2d cube art. 
I do not wish to put down people doing 2d art. Some of their work 
is  really beautiful. Bowever, if you want to go 3d, you have  to 
understand conceps that go beyond cubing. I am talking about parity 
pairs and parity-pair induced design symmetries. And of course you 
must solve  the Rubik&#x27;s cube completely. 

I knew it was going to be hard to present those designs. But I never 
imagined that I was going rto be so alone, that there would be no 
one costructing those designs. Yet that is exactly what happened in  
Toronto. Difficult as it is, I am forced to come to a conclusion, 
that at present I am  the only person in the world who does 3d cube 
art.

Did you take a snapshot of those designs? Do you  think you can 
include them in the documentary? Then perhaps somebody can see trhem 
and tell me of others who are doing 3d designs.

Thank you very much.
Hana M. Bizek

I have about 80 Rubik Arxon&#x27;s and Rubiks Studio cubes that I can use 
for speedcubing, 5 of them I use currently for speedcubing

Then I have 4, 4x4x4 that I use for speedcubing and 2 5x5x5 that I 
use for speedcubing

I can not list all the 450 puzzles, for that just look at my site

But I play regular with a speedcube siamese cube, Magaminx, 2 layer

For most other puzzles I solved them once any are now for display.

break easy and sells replacements. I think it comes with 2 of every 
type of piece and a set of stickers. I don&#x27;t want to spend money on 
that right now. Maybe we should just get a Meffert&#x27;s 4x4. They

the mini&#x27;s.  It broke in exactly the same manner as you described.  
It worked really well after regluing once or twice, but after I think 
4 different center pieces broke, the glue just wouldn&#x27;t do it any 
more.  I bought a mini 4x4x4 (eastsheen) from mefferts.  It came 
yesterday and it feels wonderful.  Since I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days 
though, I can&#x27;t comment on durability.  It&#x27;s already got at least 50 
solves on it though. And it&#x27;s smoother than my main 3x3x3 cube.

          <div class="email-content">I can testify to that- I got an Eastsheen 4x4 about a week ago and it&#x27;s
been solved numerous times, and lubed, and it is indeed smoother than my

	I had a 4x4x4 from mefferts from about a year ago, before they
sold 
	the mini&#x27;s.  It broke in exactly the same manner as you
described.  
	It worked really well after regluing once or twice, but after I
think 
	4 different center pieces broke, the glue just wouldn&#x27;t do it
any 
	more.  I bought a mini 4x4x4 (eastsheen) from mefferts.  It came

	yesterday and it feels wonderful.  Since I&#x27;ve only had it for 2
days 
	though, I can&#x27;t comment on durability.  It&#x27;s already got at
least 50 
	solves on it though. And it&#x27;s smoother than my main 3x3x3 cube.

          <div class="email-content">There are a few types of 4x4x4 type differ in Plastic

The inventor is from Peter Sebesteny, this is the 4x4x4 with the ball 
kernel
There is

The Rubik&#x27;s Revenge USA 1982  (Ideal US)
The Rubik&#x27;s Revenge UK 1982    (Ideal UK) 
The Rubik&#x27;s Master Germany 1982
The Rubik&#x27;s.com 2002 

Meffer 4x4x4

And there the Eastheen 4x4x4 with a total different mechanisme

As for the 4x4x4 ball type kernel , the centers is for all types 
very fragile. You should lubricate the Rubik&#x27;s.com 4x4x4 before use 
else the change that you will brake a center piece is bigger. Try not 
to disassemble a new 4x4x4, you probably will damage a center piece. 
Wait until it becomes a bit lose (only the 1982 have a center that 
can be removed with a screw).

An Eastheen cube does not have parts that are fragile while 
speedcubing and are easy to disassemble

I am still testing what 4x4x4 is the best for speedcubing, my current 
evaluation is that for me first the colors of the stickers is the 
most important and secondly the smoothness of the cube. Because the 
stickers of the Rubik&#x27;s 1982 versions cube are very bright and stong 
(they do not wear), this is my current number 1. I will also try an 
Eastheen after I resticker them with bright colors, the orginal 
sticker are of poor quality.

          <div class="email-content">Personally i love the rubiks.com 4x4s, well, at least when they are 
broken in.  The east sheen cubes are spectacular puzzles but they are 
too small, i keep getting my fingers tangled up!  

I can too relate to all the frustration with centers breaking.  I got 
another 4x4 just to swap pieces with.  But really once you get one 
lubbed up, it is great!

          <div class="email-content">When I wrote my book, I said that the reason I used no 4x4x4 in my 
designs was its unavailabilityand high expense, but  ainly  its 
fragility. That was certainly true in those days. Nowadays it is 
available online at rubiks.com and Mefferts, but is still quite 
expensive and fragile, as this iscuzsion shows.

My special problem is parity pairs, but with stickrs available at 
rubiks.com, that is no longer a problem.

Did anyone else, besides Ron, Jessica, Ton and Sandy, tke oyctures 
of my designs? Would you consider putting them on the web? Thank 
you. (Just the designs, without my picture, would be fine.)

Hi Mark,

   I got a tiled 4x4x4 from a seller on ebay named &quot;5x5x5&quot; and it&#x27;s
excellent. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.

   I also use Rubik&#x27;s Game cubes. For those who are interested there&#x27;s
one on ebay now. The last time I recommended Rubik&#x27;s Game cubes I
didn&#x27;t bid on the one on ebay and no one bid on it at all and it went
unsold at $3.00! So if you guys are tired of cubes with stickers, and
ones you can&#x27;t adjust...

I realize the EastSheen cubes feel more fragile/delicate, but I have <br>
yet to hear of anyone breaking one.  Is it just because of the <br>
sound/weight?  I&#x27;ve put a fair amount of use and force into my <br>
EastSheen cubes at times (even dropped them occassionally) without <br>
any problems.<br>

<br>
Mefferts.com sells two different 4x4 cubes - the larger one (normal <br>
size) is just as fragile as the rubiks.com variety.  The EastSheen <br>
cubes are much better IMHO (see above).  I have been very pleased <br>
with mine, and have used them a fair amount over the last 9 months.<br>

I have a couple recommendations for you:<br>
1) Buy a new 4x4x4, and you have a full set of replacement pieces.<br>
2) Make sure the cube is worked in and well lubed before doing much <br>
speedcubing.<br>
3) Don&#x27;t do slice moves - If you need to do a slice, move the slice <br>
with the adjacent face, and then move the face back.  I believe <br>
Masayuki&#x27;s does slices this way, and his approach uses slices fairly <br>
extensively, but he was still fast enough with it to win both the 4x4 <br>
and 5x5 events at the WC.  He (or anyone else) can correct me if I&#x27;m <br>
wrong.<br>

Well if we&#x27;re trying to model how fast a sequence can be done with our
turn metric, we need to introduce context---the moves surrounding that
move.  Otherwise simply saying a half-twist takes longer than a
quarter-twist doesn&#x27;t help much.  What we need is a model of how the
cube is held and where the fingers are at various points---and of
course this is all solver-dependent.

Which is why I like and still use HTM; it&#x27;s the original metric (at
least, the first one I saw) and the simplest.  QTM has some nice
theoretical properties, but to me F+F+ is unnatural; we think of it as
F2.  (The same argument could be made for the slices, but I think it&#x27;s
not as strong an argument there.)

So yes, it would be interesting to try to do a quick improvement of
the metric somehow, maybe by starting with HTM, and then adding some
fractional &quot;shortcuts&quot; (for instance, any sequence of two moves that
can be done as a &quot;fingertrick&quot; counts as only 1.5 moves; any sequence
of three moves that can be done as a &quot;fingertrick&quot; counts two) or
something like that, and use this to help improve the usefulness of
the metric for speedsolvers.

          <div class="email-content">Wow, not even enough center pieces on TWO broken 4x4x4&#x27;s to form a 
complete 4x4x4? That&#x27;s a lot of cube abuse, dropping, and stuff. I 
have had success in gluing center pieces together to fix such cubes, 
just have to use VERY quick drying glue, a lot of it and about 5 
layers of it with sufficent drying time in between. And then I go 
through a sanding process. It would be nice if these companies 
started offering replacement center pieces only...., I think either 
Mefferts or Rubiks.com already offers somthing like this. It is just 
not worth it to me just to buy a brand new cube and use the old one 
for replacement pieces. Also does anyone know the extent of 
compatibility of the different brands (not including the small 
Eastsheen cube of course for obvious reasons)? I know some of you 
out there love to construct 3x3&#x27;s in this manner to find a good 
composite brand cube. Would the same work as well on a 4x4?

I also broke my first 4x4 (Mefferts) only a month after it had 
arrived. So this seems to be a fairly common occurance in our 
community... I wonder what someone like Akimoto does for replacment 
pieces? He&#x27;s probably abused his 4x4&#x27;s more then any of us so 
perhaps he just has like 20 of those guys sitting around, lol. Or he 
moved on to some better solution.

So does anybody have better solutions to this problem then to just 
vent frustration towards it or just give another bad experience?

          <div class="email-content">I have my Rubik&#x27;s Master cube for 20 years, I broke one center on it. 
On the new Rubik&#x27;s.com cube I broke 4 centers, you can prevent this 
not to speedcube on a new cube, break it for in for a while and 
lubricate it. Only after it is a bit lose and lubricated centers 
break will be minimal during speedcubing.

The ball type kernel Meffert/Rubiks you can exchange the centers they 
will fit. 

Since my 4x4x4 are lubriacted after proper break it in when new, I 
did not have any center breaks. Do not try to disassembkle a new 
4x4x4 cube, this is probably when you damage a center (I did!). I 
have learn my lesson only disasseble after proper break, it will 
become a bit lose and the edges can be removed easy, never froce an 
edge out!

<br>
So I finally figured out how to finish the dang Rubik&#x27;s Cube. But I <br>
want more. I want to be able to solve it really really fast. I do it <br>
in some steps... I do the top layer, and match the faces, then I&#x27;ll <br>
finish the middle layer, then I make a cross on the bottom layer and <br>
do the corners. With less than a week of trying to go fast, I&#x27;m at <br>
3:30. What are some tips/other methods you can give me to go faster?<br>
<br>
Also, how do you read algorithms?<br>

there are lots of web sites with algorithms and finger tricks if you 
do a search.  even for a corners-first method, which sounds similar 
to what you&#x27;re doing.

in my opinion, the best off-the-shelf solution that requires very 
little custom algorithm design is the fridrich method, which differs 
from what you&#x27;re doing, so you&#x27;d have to start over again learning 
algs.  but that&#x27;s not necessary if you don&#x27;t want to get sub 20-- 
your method may be fine depending on your goals.

          <div class="email-content">(Almost) All methods should do for sub 1 - min. I use an ordinary sucky layers-first system that takes over 100 moves on average and average 45 secs. So if sub 1 min is your first goal, you could just practice your current method. Lube up your cube and start turning. Remember that looking ahead does MUCH more for your times than fast finger movement.

          <div class="email-content">Last year I bought a 4^3 from Meffert&#x27;s. I think it&#x27;s like old cubes,
built around a ball with screws.
I&#x27;m only celebrating its first birthday, but it really does not look
fragile. Silicon grease (not oil) seems fine for that kind of heavy
cube. A few flying edges while speedcubing, because my method uses too
much slice moves :-)
Meffert&#x27;s only sells Eastsheen cubes now.

          <div class="email-content">SOme of you may remember about similar posts i did a while back on <br>
cube related dreams.  I have have more bizare ones to share and was <br>
wondering if anyone else has nights plagued with cube dreams. <br>
<br>
One of my funnier dreams ( i can laugh now) was a nightmare i had.  I <br>
remember walking up to a candy maching, the big box thing with the <br>
spirals that push out a candy bar or a bag of chips or something, but <br>
this one was filled up with cubes.  Not just 3x3s, but 4x4s 5x5s <br>
6x6x, megaminxs, skewbs, dogics, pyraminx, etc all for a $1.  I reach <br>
into my pocket and pull out one dollar.  I&#x27;m going for a dogic hehehe <br>
put the dollar into the machine and the dollar spits back out.  I try <br>
it again and the stupid machine wouldn&#x27;t take my money!!! <br>
<br>
Another one i had started on a beach.  I was laying in the sun just <br>
relaxing the day away, and the cabana lady who usually carries drinks <br>
to all the sun bathers brought be cube after cube.  It was one of my <br>
best dreams ever.  <br>
<br>
Just last night i had a dream and came up with my own method.  I&#x27;m <br>
going to work on it and see if it is anything good.  So far it is.  <br>
And it is very similar to other methods out there but i will try and <br>
get somewhere with it first before i post it. <br>

Just thought i&#x27;d share a bit of cubing insanity with all of you.  Itd <br>
be cool to hear about other cube dreams people have.  Thanks much<br>

          <div class="email-content">LOL, VERY funny post!!! I used to have these types of dreams, not 
nearly as bizare though. I can cube in my dreames, like visualize 
the cube and generate perfectly random cases in each step, and I 
think I&#x27;m moving my hands the right way to solve it.... and it all 
looks pretty much the same as when I&#x27;m actually cubing, cuz I&#x27;ve 
seen myself do it so many times that I know what it should look like 
in my sleep, hehe.

Don&#x27;t be afraid to share guys.... I&#x27;m sure none of us here are 
psychologists. Then again it doesn&#x27;t take one to tell us were 
obsessed with the cube.

Actaully recently, my dreams have been all math oriented and 
frustrating. Like &quot;Why can&#x27;t I assume these stupid eigenvalues are 
all not equal to zero and then.... linearly independent, 
therefore....but what if it&#x27;s infinite-dimensional....etc.&quot; And I 
just frustrate myself with these sort of things all night. (I&#x27;m sure 
close to 1/3 of you are math people that went through this kinda 
stuff back in college, so I just thought I&#x27;d share....)

Ya those are pretty cool ones you got, Jake. And being ispired by 
them to develop a method is astonishing.

Hemm... I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m a bit offended by that comment. Your 
trivializing the skill of sub-20 cubists and what it takes to get 
there!!! Like &quot;oh ya I could get sub-20, just don&#x27;t want to right 
now,&quot; which is preposterous and an insult to some of us. That&#x27;s 
probably not what you meant, but it&#x27;s an underlying aspect of how 
you worded it. Sub-30 would have been cool, since a lot of practice 
can get a person there.... but for sub-20 it&#x27;s a lot more 
complicated: It takes *TONS* of hard-work, months of practice (I&#x27;d 
say years, but that has been refuted by a few cubists), hardcore 
dedication, and a long list of other stuff. So don&#x27;t just be 
like &quot;get sub-20&quot; without showing a little respect and proper 
connotation.

I&#x27;m not quite there yet, but I know the journey to be long and 
rigorous. You speak of it like it&#x27;s nothing.

several hours before I wake up, so I just remember something

I think you got a message from God, he told you of the best method

I think he just meant that his layer by layer method could get him 
decent speed, but if he wanted to get world class speed (sub 20) he 
would have to learn some more complicated stuff.  I think you took 
that post a little out of context Doug...

          <div class="email-content">I just wanted to suggest instead of

&quot;if you don&#x27;t want to get sub-20&quot;
to read
&quot;unless you are trying to get sub-20&quot;
or
&quot;unless you will be trying to get sub-20&quot;

This difference is subtle. The first places emphasis on &#x27;desire,&#x27; 
the second emphasizes &#x27;effort.&#x27; 

You don&#x27;t always get what you WANT, but you can always TRY.

When I read your post it just seemed weird, like did you choose the 
number 20 because it is like the supreme goal just to exaggerate it 
(what advanced systems can do for a person) OR that as you were 
typing it you had some kind of subconscious trivialization of what 
it takes to become sub-20 because there are so many sub-20 cubists 
out there now??? You could have choose something more reasonable 
like sub-30 or sub-40.

That is all.

more careful of what you post here and how you word it...)

          <div class="email-content">many people use vinyl tape to help this problem.  you can buy a roll of each colour, sissors, and youll be set for life.  you can also paint your cube, athough it might look really bad the first time (same w/ the stickers, but prob. worse) and peel or chip off.  i usually blend these together and apply clear nailpolish to the cube after ive put stickers on it.  this makes the stickers last a bit longer.  the sticker kits for rubiks.com are pretty expensive to my standards, and i dont know wheter they have good stickers in stock or not--they vary a lot. i think you can buy &quot;professional stickers&quot; from them, but they havent responded to my email about a different subject, so i dont know if they would respond to you.
 
  i also cube at lunch on the occaision that i am really bored and have my cube at school, although i might start to  cube a lot at a computer for the pursuit of science.  The stickers&#x27; residue might be tough to get off since theyve been on there for a long time.  I peeled off my stickers as soon as the clear tape annoyed me.  gl w/ the cube!

          <div class="email-content">Ha, I like Jake&#x27;s reply.

I usually have at least one cube in bed with me every night, or set 
it on the nightstand if its corners start poking me too much. And I 
also have that quirk, except the it has to do with how I hope my 
next day will be: refine or carefree. Performing a single algorithm 
over and over after lights out is another thing I like to do.... 
When ever I&#x27;m having trouble with a particular algorithm I just do 
it over and over in bed, usually >400 iterations to get the full 
effect... So it is quite frequent that I fall asleep cubing or start 
to cube in my sleep since it&#x27;s still in my hands (sleep-walking -> 
sleep-cubing :)). It annoys the heck out of my roommates.... Good 
thing this year I live in a single.

Anyways I should be working on my hw. This fourm is the easiest way 
for my to procrastinate (I hide my cubes from myself while doing hw, 
lol). The reason why I&#x27;ve been posting a lot lately is to motivate 
you guys to post, to strike up some controversy also.

The posts here have now become very infrequent for some reason. I 
think it&#x27;s because school hs started for everyone by now. I have 
TONS of interesting topics I could post on, but don&#x27;t care to 
monopolize the board. I mean common, with all the interesting stuff 
that has gone on lately... Someone should have posted on Frank&#x27;s tv 
interview and newspaper article, we had DanK on a national talk 
show, and a few other things...

I think people are just not motivated enough to post. Perhaps 
something can be done about that. Hem... let me do some more 
motivatin&#x27;.

Does anyone other there want a copy of the MOD tv show featuring 
Hardwick and Wesley? I have a copy, just need to level the audio 
properly... I have some backstage clips too. I&#x27;ll get my picture of 
a signed 4x4 by Jessica, she took up every square, notice that here 
name has 4^2 letters. Um... I think I have some cool clips of on the 
spot cubing done by several of the wc competitors that I recorded at 
Toronto, I&#x27;d post those if the respective parties will allow. 
Ya...., most of this I should append to my web site and finally 
update it (it hasn&#x27;t been for 7 weeks now, so it&#x27;s still at the 
under-construction/new phase). I mean common, a piece of the 
podium!!! I know someone is gona want to see a picture of this 
(refering to those that didn&#x27;t go to wc), it&#x27;s signed by all the 
competitors minus a few. Ya, a few more cool things I&#x27;ll keep secret 
for now....

But that&#x27;s reeaally weird, if you can solve it while sleep walking. 
You can now say that you can solve it in your sleep, and actually be

<br>
Just a hint to get a little more speed out of your solve.  <br>
I found this on post 6701.  But, if you solve all but one corner on <br>
the first layer,  using that empty corner it becomes really easy to <br>
place the middle 4 edges. This requires about 4 moves instead of 8.<br>
then place the last corner.<br>

Nobody of us wants to write on paper F+F+ or FF instead of F2!
I suggested earlier to count F2 as 2 moves. For example the alg 
RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27; should be counted as 8 moves, not 7 (or 7.5).
If you think differently then tell me what means &quot;2&quot; in &quot;F2&quot;? I can 
tell you: &quot;TWO QUATTER MOVES&quot;!

Talking about the metrics, which could tell us how much time we need 
on average to solve an alg, I think it may turn out just impossible! 
What about right- and left-hand persons? What about smaller and 
bigger hands and fingers? What about personal predispositions? I am 
afraid everyone of us must make his/her choice of alg.

OOOoooooppss! Broken center! I was very very slow, thinking on a new

I think the main difference between the methods is that Richard <br>
memorizes where the pieces are, applying 3-cycles and adjusting his <br>

          <div class="email-content">Right, I wouldn&#x27;t go for the Fridrich method. I don&#x27;t even use the 
Fridrich method regularly. I&#x27;m sure each of us can devise of easy to 
understand beginner methods, of course I know that this can be 
relative to the person learning it. I know enough of a variety of 
methods to teach people at the beginner to intermediate levels...., 
and know where to tell the advanced cubers where to go find what 
they need for their method.

I think I would teach something that is overlaps a lot with 
mainstream.... start them on the cross. Even though I don&#x27;t start 
off with a cross all the time, I have found it a good mental 
exercise to always do it 7 moves or less HTM there oare only 108 
cases absolutely requiring more 8 turns btw. And then there are a 
variety of ways to do the c/e slots, I&#x27;d usually teach them to do 
corners first, all 4 (I know 3 might be a good idea, but this forces 
them to repetitively use and thus memorize a simple second layer 
edge insertion alg.). Or instead of starting out with cross, they 
can start out with and X, their is a simple first layer edge 
insertion alg, that I think is pretty simple and easy to learn.

Either way, I definately don&#x27;t want them to think that the Fridrich 
is the ONLY way to get fast, like it&#x27;s some standard or something. I 
think beginners should be a little creative about it. Cuz once they 
get on the net and search around that&#x27;s mostly what they&#x27;ll see. Not 
that I&#x27;m saying that there&#x27;s anything wrong with this popular method 
of course.

And for the LL, I&#x27;d teach one of two algs to Permute corners, the 
Sune to orientate them, and soemthing simple to flip edges, and then 
the basic 3-cycle of edges (in that order). Once they get the hang 
of it (people can easily break 1 minute with just this method) then 
I can show them some PLL&#x27;s, namely the T and Y Perm and they can 
switch over to this different 4 look system, similar to the intent 
of DanK&#x27;s basic method (on his video). Then there are only 8 PLLs to 
go (figuring in that they&#x27;d stumble on to brute-force Z-Perm and H/+ 
Perm on their own like meany of us did). Thus we have a 3 look LL 
system good enough for many cubist. Then it is of course c/e pairing 
game time... and we all know how that goes.

Actaully, I refute what you said &quot;the fridrich method isnt the 
easiest one to explain, especially the F2L&quot;, that is actually not 
true. It really does depend on the person, but in general it is that 
the LL step of it is the hardest to explain NOT the F2L. Normally 
people are baffled at making the LL all one color then permuting it 
all while maintaining the orientation.... I know I was when I first 
heard of it.

I like to teach three edges of bottom layer, corners of bottom layer,
position corners of top layer, orient corners of top layer, place
edges of top layer using &quot;keyhole&quot;, place keyhole edge, place and
orient edges of equator.

The reason for this, is that it requires learning the four &quot;algs&quot; for
placing a corner: RUR&#x27;, RU&#x27;R&#x27; and F&#x27;UF F&#x27;U&#x27;F which can then be used
for placing the top corners, positioning the bottom corners and
orienting the bottom corners. 

Then it&#x27;s one easy sequence to place the four following edges, another
similar one for the last edge. And then you just need the easy permute
3 edges on the equator alg and something to do the orienting. (I like
using techniques for orienting which consist of: do a move which
orients one piece but preserves the layer containing the two pieces to
be oriented - replace the oriented piece with the yet-to-be oriented

The corners get solved very quickly: Say you have white on top and
yello w on bottom. First you do 3 or 4 moves, which orient all the
corners with *either* white *or* yellow in facing up or down (rather
as if white and yellow where the same color) - so that max 3 turns is
all you need to have all the corner cubies orientated. Then place all
the corners in their respective layers. Then permute all.

The rest is not explained in great detail...

Okay, when people want to learn &#x27;to solve the Cube&#x27;, you can easily scare them off with wicked finger tricks, algs performed back, etc.  When I show people, I make it as E.A.S.Y...A.S...P.O.S.S.I.B.L.E., because they know nothing of notation, nothing of the Cube (and i mean nothing).  i show them this....<br>
<br>
1) top corners, (2) top edges, (3) middle edges (4) orienting bottom corners (5) placing bottom corners (6) orienting bottom edges (7) solving bottom edges<br>
<br>
Very easy of course, and some of it is so not necessary, but just get total beginners, this is quite as easy as possible, and yes, with great success (im currently in the middle of showing a heap of people right now anyway, yes....)<br>

          <div class="email-content">For a while, my webpage has had no real good explanation of how I do<br>
edge orientation. In reality, steps 1 and 2 are done together, in that<br>
by the time I finish step 1, I try to have step 2 finished also. This<br>
simply involves looking ahead, but you cannot do it without knowing<br>
extensively which different paths you can take.<br>
<br>
I plan to write more about this. But for now, I have rewritten the<br>
standard step 2 page to &quot;explain&quot; how edge orientation works:<br>
<br>
	http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step2.html<br>
<br>
In the future, I plan to write two more pages:<br>
<br>
1. looking ahead as you approach step 2.<br>
2. orienting edges while building the last square of step 1.<br>
<br>
Question: an alternative to steps 2 to 4 is to insert the last F2L pair,<br>
then do a two step last layer. I have not really reduced the number of<br>
looks here. So is my system no faster than existing systems? Well, there<br>
are a number of interesting points about step 2:<br>
<br>
1. it is incredibly quick compared to inserting the last F2L pair.<br>
2. it has instant recognition time.<br>
3. the average algorithm size is 5.71 which turns out to be optimal for<br>
performing the step with just two finger trick macros.<br>
4. step 2 can often be skipped or significantly shortened.<br>
<br>
You could say that step 2 is such a short extension of step 1 that it is<br>
not really a separate look.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Brent brings up a great point!  I have also taught a few people and lately I&#x27;ve been working on teaching my 7th grade discovery class.  I&#x27;ve found the key to really teaching people is making it, as Brent put it &quot;E.A.S.Y...A.S...P.O.S.S.I.B.L.E.&quot;  To add to that a little bit,  I have found some simple key words, phrases and ideas that are rather elementary and easy for beginners to remember.   <br>
<br>
Just to give you an example, when teaching the LL Edges I explain to them that the first thing to remember about ALL the bottom edge moves is that the very first move will be Middle Down.  Emphasizing this idea to them is important because it helps simply all of my LL edge moves.<br>
<br>
An example on how I would teach one of the LL Edge moves:<br>
To remember &quot;basic edge move&quot; just think &quot;1, 2, 1&quot;<br>
What this means is that you go middle down, right once (1), middle up, right twice (2), middle down, right once (1)  and then the move is complete.  But instead of remember all of those words, I simplified it to &quot;1,2,1&quot;  The number of times they need to move right because they can easily remember to alternate middle down then middle up.  So another LL Edge move would be &quot;Snake eyes&quot;  &quot;3 left, 2 right, then basic edge from the correct side&quot;  And once they see how it works they will shorten that to &quot;3, 2&quot;<br>
 <br>
I know this way of teaching may sound a bit complicated and I think I made it sound more confusing than it really is, but it has worked, and worked well at that!  <br>
<br>
If you are interested in knowing how I explain any of my other moves to people feel free to send me an email, I&#x27;d be more than happy to reply.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I like to think that a LBL method is the building block to all 
methods.  Thus making it the most adaptable method out there.  Some 
people out there are just looking to solve the cube, not to solve for 
speed, so they have no use to memorize all those algs.  If a person 
is dedicated and wants to improve, then they can also tweak the LBL 
to whatever speed method they are comfortable with.  Progress at 
first seems slow but having some sort of &quot;knowledge of the cube&quot; 
before they dive into a more serious method definately helps.

I just did a rough timing for step 2. Most cases I can do in under one<br>

second. I assume that is significantly faster than inserting a F2L pair?<br>
I don&#x27;t have first hand experience at being fast with F2L pairs, so I<br>

Up to 5 moves can be done in significantly less than a second. Some 6<br>
move algorithms are very fast. Most can be done in just under a second.<br>
Two of them I cannot do in under a second:<br>
<br>
R&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;UFR and its inverse.<br>
<br>
These both happen to be used in the Fridrich system. Can any of the fast<br>
Fridrich people perform those in under one second?<br>
<br>
Anything longer than 6 moves takes more than a second (for me at least).<br>

When you are trying to teach sometrhing to somebody, knowledge of

I am finally forced to accept the unrhinkable  that I an the oinly

But I think that an easy option would be to teach the person a layer

if they want to learn a faster method you could teach them to pair 
the corner with the edge before they put it there (Fridrich method). 
But there are some people who want to learn a fast method from the

          <div class="email-content">At my high school I taught quite a lot of people how to solve the 
cube and I learned a couple things about it.  First and foremost 
most people tend to not like the concept of an algorithm, they like 
to understand what they&#x27;re doing to the cube and also most people 
I&#x27;ve found don&#x27;t like memorizing algorithms either.  I also agree 
that in teaching beginners you should teach a method that is as easy 
as possible.  The method I teach to people who want to learn is the 
second solution on Mark Jeay&#x27;s solution page.  The reason for this 
is that you can teach it in one session and it requires no algorithm 
learning for the person you&#x27;re teaching.  I teach this method like 
so,

1) solve cross onto bottom face
2) insert 3 corners of the bottom layer
3) insert 3 middle layer edges using the empty corner slot
  - this leaves the F2L solved except for one corner edge pair.
4) orient and place three edges of the top layer using the empty F2L 
slot
5) orient and place middle layer edge and final LL edge using an 
algorithm
  - There are only 3 cases for this step, and I&#x27;ve found that if I 
explain exactly what the algorithms do for each case, rather than 
rattle off moves &quot;do R U2 L, etc.&quot; then most people don&#x27;t treat this 
step like a step that uses algs.
6) position remaining corners using the still empty corner slot.
7) rotate corners
  - this step could be taught by telling them an alg but I usually 
show people how they can take the corner out of the top layer and 
put it back in correctly, then do the same to another corner only 
using the original move backwards and it fixes the cube.  So most 
people don&#x27;t consider this an alg either.

The problem with this method is that it doesn&#x27;t extend easily into 
faster methods, the person has to ditch everything after the cross 
if they want to learn Fridrich for example.  The plus side of 
teaching this way though is that you can do it all in one session 
and that people understand what they&#x27;re doing to the cube and are 
less likely to forget an alg for a step and be unable to continue 
until they can ask you again for the alg.

My two cents,
Chris

just like too say it was really nice meeting all of you at wc3<br>
never met such nice people and been impressed with so much skill in <br>
my life<br>
for the record I was the crazy guy in the black rubiks  cube shirt <br>
with the red montreal hat who asked everyone too sign his shirt.<br>
<br>
i wish i had visited here more often,I would have known who was who <br>
before hand. LIke talking too a guy at sign up named Andy camann. <br>
only too come back home too realize who he was. <br>
<br>
some Fav moments: <br>
<br>
Ron von Bruchem in 1st round going super slow on purpose, never <br>
laughed so hard<br>
Dan knights massive jacket<br>
being filmed with my friend for CUbers (hope i make the cut!)<br>
FREE GIFTS!!! FREE CUBES! (gave away all my 3x3x3 too kids who want <br>
too learn)<br>
meeting dan knights, ron von bruchem, jessica Fridrich, Jess bonde, <br>
Katsu, lars petrus and dan harris . learned so much from there sites <br>
thanks!!		<br>
seeing Cube doctor TOn and his amazing designed cubes<br>
FREE FOOD!<br>
dan harris&#x27;s crazy impersnations<br>
<br>
Worst moments : <br>
not sleeping for nearly 24hours<br>
super exploding cube<br>
forgetting a Pll I&#x27;ve known for months and running around asking <br>
people where jess bonde was so i can remember what the finger tricks <br>
were again<br>
getting too the 1st round late on the 2nd day and hearing my name <br>
called almost imediatly not having solved a cube that day<br>
having too leave early too catch the bus back<br>
<br>
<br>
post wc2<br>
After seeing other cubers cubes and styles I relearned f2l with both <br>
hands mirrored and reversed and with the cross on the left side. <br>
which helped me get sub 20 more often f2l is really the key...<br>
then lost motivation too go any faster and started focusing on one <br>
handed cubing and trying too figure out blind folding cubing and <br>
5x5x5 are a nightmare ahhh!<br>
<br>
i&#x27;ll try and get my wc3 pics up sometime this week<br>

Nice!<br>
<br>
&gt; The problem with this method is that it doesn&#x27;t extend easily into <br>
&gt; faster methods, the person has to ditch everything after the cross <br>
&gt; if they want to learn Fridrich for example.<br>
<br>
I taught a few people recently, and found it is not really too difficult<br>
to extend this to Fridrich. They will probably have figured out that<br>
there are two 3 move algorithms for inserting a corner (with the LL on<br>
the bottom):<br>
<br>
1. R U&#x27; R&#x27;<br>
2. R U R&#x27;<br>
<br>
Remind them of that, and then show them that there are two 3 move<br>
algorithms for inserting an edge:<br>
<br>
1. R U&#x27; R&#x27;<br>
2. R U R&#x27;<br>
<br>
They will probably not be aware of the second one. But once they<br>
understand that these are the same algorithms, demonstrate inserting a<br>
corner and edge simultaneously with each algorithm. All they need to<br>
learn is how to get the corner and edge pieces &quot;aligned&quot; first, and then<br>
apply algorithm 2. (Yes, the initial part of the explanation is just a<br>
trick to make them think &quot;Ah, I see! I think I can do that!&quot; rather than<br>
&quot;Hmm.. it looks too hard&quot;, but it works.)<br>
<br>
Also, I think steps 4 to 7 can be easily extended for speed. My<br>
speedcubing system is almost a direct extension:<br>
<br>
4) orient the top layer edges and place the middle layer edge using the<br>
empty F2L slot<br>
5) insert the last corner while placing the last layer edges<br>
6) orient and permute (simultaneously) the 4 remaining corners<br>

          <div class="email-content">Great job man! Your site is layed out very well and the organization 
of algorithms makes perfect sense, better then how on some sites 
people just number them randomly. The stuff you show on your step 1 
and step 2 are very helpful to my method.... I&#x27;m just taking the 
time to digest everything properly. I&#x27;m sure you put a lot of hard 
work into it, thank you very much.

Curious though, are you a speedcuber? Have you demonstrated this 
method to be a viable speedsolving method? What times do you get 
using it? I sometimes do solves using your method, I come across one 
fo the few step 4 algs I don&#x27;t know and have to revert back to what 
I normally do and then finish with a 3-cycle, H/+ Perm, or Z Perm. 
I&#x27;d just like you to know that &#x27;somebody&#x27;  is practicing your method 
a bit. I&#x27;m getting good results, and your right all 4 of your points 
are valid on your step 2. Recognition time is great in steps 2 and 
3. The method does indeed make for very few moves compared to others 
out there.

I can get sub-30 no problem with it, so I suppose this would help to 
validate your method...?? It does overlap with my method 
significantly, I tend to call mine a Lar&#x27;s Variant but it is 
actually closer to yours then I care to admit to myself. I&#x27;m not TOO 
much of a fan of early Edge Permutation, but it is sometimes worth 
it since many of my CLLs preserve such things. If posssible I still 
tend to side with doing a ZZ manuever to c/e pair it up properly. 
And as always flipping edges when there&#x27;s nothing better to do is a 
good suggestion.

   I think that&#x27;s an excellent way of going about it. When they grasp
that &quot;1,2,1&quot; you have a good opportuninty to introduce the concept of
the algorithm. The first time someone explained algorithm to me they
had it wrong. People here refer to algs often, but does everyone
understand that an alogithm is a sequence that when repeated a certain
number of times times returns to the beginning.

   You can show your friends that repeating the &quot;1,2,1&quot; sequence three
times from a solved cube resuts in a solved cube.

   Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Yes, that is kinda obvious, or should be. Since the size of the cube 
group is of finite size and the order of all elements of the group 
must divide this number, it is clear that repeating a sequence a 
finite number of times will result in the original state.

So this could be anything, the turn R is cyclic order 4, duh... So 
when you say they explained it incorrectly, how did they explain 
it??? Let us judge for ourselves; their are different 
interpretations ont his I am sure and besides, how can someone get 
the definition of a cube algorithm wrong, doesn&#x27;t seem likely to me.

Oh yes, the 1,2,1 thing is something I call some of my algs when 
explaining to friends. I use it for that edge flipping alg and the 
H/+ perm.... Don&#x27;t underestimate the intellect of others....

I was shocked at how fast my friend picked up the fast DanK Z 
Perm... (only took him a few minutes) and actaully he said it was 
quite easy... except for the accidental D&#x27;R at the end instead of 
the intended D2&#x27;F, but even I do that sometimes still. It&#x27;s actually 
quite cool, once you teach somebody what you do in slow motion and 
they can actually perform it, then they see/understand what moves 
you&#x27;re performing. Thus, they tend to apprieciate your finger 
dexerity for what it actaully is.

          <div class="email-content">They are generally aquired from Ton liked off speedcubing.com... 
unless of course you have a friend or relative in or near Hungary. I 
think it is possible to make any cube into a &quot;good speedsolving 
cube,&quot; with the exception of cheap knock-offs and dollar store 
cubes. It does also depend on what your style of cubing is and what 
level your at.

Like if I was just starting to cube I wouldn&#x27;t spend $74 on a Ton 
prepared Arxon cube. I can just as easily get a 12.xxs time on my 
store bought, rubiks.com type cube then a Studio Cube. It just 
depends on how much your willing to wear one in. Just last night 
falling to sleep in bed I put a few thousand turns on a cube I just 
took out of the package, perhaps that&#x27;s the equivalent of a half-
year&#x27;s worth of amature level cubing.... hehe. So I&#x27;ll just do that 
every night until I feel like I don&#x27;t want it too loose or that it 
is starting to pop excessively.

   The concept was exlained to me before the cube was invented.
Algorithm was given to me as a repeated sequence, but more along the
lines of a critcal path in constructing a house, like
Level the land
Dig the holes
Lay the foundation 
build the wall frames
stand them up, etc
   The sequence, being repeated resulted in a new house.

   So when I came to this board I thought algorithm meant something
like a strategy:
on one side put four corners in place
put that side&#x27;s edges in place 
put the middle level edges in place
do the last level corners
do the last level edges

   This was a sequence that being repeated had the same result.

          <div class="email-content">I am sure your version is much better than the one I teach :)  I 
definitely can&#x27;t get 30&#x27;s with it the way I do this method (perhaps 
mine is a much simpler version).  I can average around 50&#x27;s with two 
hands this way with an occasional 40 something time.

I have found though, which is what I meant by my last post, is that 
a very very simplified version of this strategy is a good way to 
teach people who are just starting.  This works since most people 
seem to be able to pick up on it since it allows the learner to 
understand what they&#x27;re doing to the cube more than a layer-by-layer 
method where they learn a few algs for the last layer.

Also don&#x27;t underestimate your one-handed speed, you did hold the 
record for 20 years, which is quite a feat in my opinion :)

          <div class="email-content">Well for the 4x4, you usually pop and edge, CAREFULLY of course and 
never on an overly new 4x4 as Ton recommends. So it just a matter of 
taking one edge piece out; they don&#x27;t go too deep; do this with 
about 40 deg turn on it. Adjust the tention of the screws on the 
sphere while your at it; it makes a big difference for the Meffert&#x27;s 
one, but I think the kernel on my Rubiks.com one is completely glued 
together. For the 5x5, it definately depends on the mechanism.... 
For Meffert&#x27;s I recommend taking out a single non-middle edge piece 
(wear the cube in first of course). For the rubiks.com brand you can 
take out an entire edge triplet at the 45 degree mark just as you 
would for one edge of a 3x3. The problem here is that it goes VERY 
deep so be careful. The Rubiks.com 5x5 is much more flexible in this 
regard and perfromring this feat on a brand new one is alright I 
think/hope.

Hemm... just noticed that I always leave my 4x4 sitting on top of my 
monitor, hehe. The full effect is that if someone walked past my 
room they could instantly see about 15 cubes in plain site, counting 
the Homer Head and Megaminx. That surely draws in some unwanted 
visitors at bad times now and then. Of course if my door was closed 
they would see like 500 worn-out cube stickers, hehe.

As a rule of thumb, all internal points of contact should be lubed 
to some degree.

&quot;My fingers hurt.&quot; YA, RIGHT!!?? I jsut did a re-estimation, it 
seems I put 10,000 turns HTM on my new, &#x27;stiff&#x27; cube last night and 
5,000 tonight (already up again at 2AM to study for tommorrow&#x27;s 
(ops, today&#x27;s) Orgo exam.... yuk...)...... So don&#x27;t tell me YOUR 
finger&#x27;s hurt. I do a fair amount of 4x4 speedsolving also.

&quot;I&#x27;ve only taken apart a 4x4x4, and it&#x27;s basically the same as a  
3x3x3.&quot; &lt;---- What the heck??? UH, NO. But that might depend on your 
pov, there were a few &#x27;other&#x27; viable 4x4 mechanisms inveted that 
post-date the original... &#x27;those&#x27; might be similar to the 3x3 we all 
know and love. A sphere with tracks is hardly the same as a 6 arm 
spider mechanism.

&quot;Just lever up one edge.&quot; &lt;---- Not with a screw driver or key btw.

&quot;But I would advise that you don&#x27;t take it completely apart, because 
it&#x27;s terribly difficult to put it back together. But from what I&#x27;ve 
heard, the mechanics of a 5x5x5 are similar to a 3x3x3. They&#x27;re easy 
to put back together.&quot; &lt;---- That also sounds a bit fishy to me. The 
mechanism (mechanismS should I say) for a 5x5 is simialr to the 3x3. 
But it doesn&#x27;t sound too logical that a 5x5 is easier to assemble 
then a 4x4. I think they are both about the same, the 4x4 easier 
once you get the hang of how the center pieces go in, especially the 
final one. They all go in first before the last few edges at the 
latest. On the contrary, I advise taking it apart and putting it 
back together to learn about hos the mechanism works. I&#x27;s a puzzle 
in itself when your doing it for the first time around. It does get 
a bit annoying eventually, I must point out.

&quot;i think the 4x4 is actually very easy to put back together.&quot; &lt;---- 
Now that&#x27;s the spirit!

&quot;dont take the 5x5 apart, unless you want an hour of fun&quot; &lt;---- a 
bit of an exaggeration of course, but this is partially due to the 
fact that the same parity problems do arise in the 5x5 as the 3x3. 
As for the 4x4, odds are good.... you get a 1/3 chance of having a 
solvable cube once you randomly assemble it. The problem is in the 
possibility of a single corner twist in either direction. Try speed-
assembly, it&#x27;s kinda a nifty thing to do with other cubists. We did 
it at the hotel lobby the last day I was there. Might even been 
added to one of the documentaries for it, :). Man I got beat, LOL. 
No wonder Wesley is so fast at solving, he wastes no time in 
assembly... :).

&quot;just pop a piece out and spray some lube, that should do the 
trick.&quot; &lt;---- Yep, fast and painless. Then scramble fircely and 
repeat until desired. &lt;---- similar to the back of a shampoo 
bottle...

Approaching sub-30 average.<br>

<br>
No, but it&#x27;s good to hear you have gotten sub-30 with it.<br>
<br>
It is kind of fun to guess at the limits for different speed cubing<br>
methods. At the bottom of http://users.rcn.com/rhodee/cubelog.html Andy<br>
suggests that the limit of the Fridrich system may be more like 14.6-15<br>
seconds. I am willing to believe that considering he is very close to 15<br>
seconds just with pure Fridrich.<br>
<br>
If I may dream further,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to believe that my step 2 gives *at least* 0.6 seconds<br>
improvement to the time - maybe 13 point something is possible?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d also like to believe that building my step 1 with squares instead of<br>
corner/edge pairs can give 1-2 seconds improvement. But that&#x27;s the bit<br>
that really needs proving.<br>
<br>
Lars had a great idea with his method: place the pieces in an order that<br>
causes minimal obstruction, and this will inevitably lead to much fewer<br>
moves than Fridrich. But why are the Fridrich people faster? Can I<br>
really gain 1-2 seconds improvement with the Lars principle?<br>
<br>
I had practiced the Fridrich system before, and here is what I liked:<br>
<br>
- forming a cross forces many pieces onto the top layer making them<br>
  easier to find - LESS TIME LOOKING FOR PIECES<br>
- a complete table of F2L cases is supplied - IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREPARE<br>
  FOR ALL CASES - FASTER REACTION TIME<br>
<br>
I think this must be the difference that makes the Fridrich people<br>
faster. So I tried to design a system that could employ the Lars<br>
principle, but spend less time looking for pieces, and find some way to<br>
prepare for all cases.<br>
<br>
* less time looking for pieces *<br>
<br>
After I build one square, I need to look for pieces for building the<br>
next square. With 3 sides free, you can choose among 3 squares to build<br>
in standard Petrus, but among *12* squares in my system. In my view, the<br>
extreme ends are the best - either choose the same square every time<br>
(which requires less looking around), or allow yourself to consider the<br>
whole cube in the picture, and just choose whichever pieces jump out at<br>
you. In other words, I try not to look around too much at this stage,<br>
but just try to recognise any of a number of patterns that I have<br>
programmed myself to see. By now considering any piece in the whole<br>
cube, you can just see a pattern anywhere rather than looking around for<br>
specific pieces.<br>
<br>
I built a fallback plan into this system that is tied with step 2. If I<br>
cannot immediately see any pattern that is good, I just do some easy<br>
moves to orient the edges. After that is done, I look again to see if<br>
there are any good patterns. If not, bad luck, but this generally<br>
increases the chances of finding something without having to look for<br>
it.<br>
<br>
* preparing for all cases *<br>
<br>
I tried to find a way to develop some table similar to Fridrich. This<br>
is difficult because the number of cases is much much greater than<br>
Fridrich&#x27;s. What I came up with was to develop a table of patterns where<br>
a corner/edge pair is already joined, and another table of patterns<br>
where a centre/edge pair is already joined (this one is not finished<br>
yet). By studying those, it is possible to see how to get from any<br>
position to the nearest pattern in the table.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure everyone knows how to solve all of those positions in my<br>
tables. The point is not to teach you how to solve those positions (you<br>
should work that out by yourself!). The point is to display all the<br>
positions side by side so that you can study them, see how many moves<br>
each different pattern takes so that you can calculate which path is the<br>
shortest while your solving, and also just so that you &quot;know&quot; what the<br>
patterns are and can respond quickly to them when you see them.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; I&#x27;m not TOO much of a fan of early Edge Permutation, but it is<br>
&gt; sometimes worth it since many of my CLLs preserve such things.<br>
<br>
Exactly! So many of the very shortest LL algorithms preserve the<br>
positions of the edges. That is one thing I like about step 4. Many of<br>
the optimal algorithms for step 4 are just formed by combining these<br>
short edge preserving algorithms in different ways. That makes<br>
memorisation a great deal easier.<br>

Hey Ryan, you could be much faster.
You know what&#x27;s the problem with you?
You think too much, you&#x27;ll never be a speedcuber!

14.6-15<br>

yes but who know ??...<br>

last year only few speedcubers are able to reach 17&#x27; , and the limits <br>

do sub 17 average , and now they fixed the limit at 14.5 ?!! , it&#x27;s <br>

          <div class="email-content">There where two main speedcube methods used at the WC

A F2L method and variants
A corners first and variants

I saw two main method for speedcubing finger tricks, based on slice 
moves, and based on FRU moves

And there are a lots of variants and mixed methods, what I think is 
important is how fast can you see a pattern,what is the average moves 
needed to solve the cube, are finger tricks possible.

Some thoughts

A very rude method would be a F2L and one method to orientate and 
place the last layer.

A bit less rude is F2L and orientate the edges of the last layer than 
Orientate corners and position the last layer in one method

But for both the above you would need to practice a lot of algoritmes 
and this is not impossible but impractical.

My prediction (gut feeling) is that it is possible to design an 
method with an average of 40 moves and can be solved in 12 seconds at 
average. But for this we would need the input of the speedcubing 
community and a lot of investigation and some theoretical 
calculations. For sure what is needed dedication to practise and the 
talent. I gues that most of the top speedcubers already do the 
investigation and some theoretical calculations, I already know they 
have the talent and the dedication to practise.

But than again a big factor at a competetion will be: how will you 
perform during a competetions? If we look at the WC2003 we see that 
the average was 3 to 6 seconds above the normal performance. I gues 
the main improvement for the top speedcubers will be to train your 
self to perform in competetion. 

If I evaluate myself I conclude, to turn in public you can train and 
it helps a bit. But still I do not perform well in a head-to-head 
competition. I improve the most when I would train in a head-to-head 
speedcube race. I did some fun races with Ron, like the blindsmans 
cube or the Siamese fused cube and that helps a lot.

If I only was twice as fast!

Ton
P.S. I have now the dedication to get to 25 seconds average! It will 
be a long way for me, but I know I can get there.

Doug - could you please use a kinder tone in your responses?  I have <br>

ranting, and I could see your judging, &quot;better/smarter than you&quot; tone <br>

<br>
On your first point, perhaps you have been into cubing for much <br>
longer, and/or your puzzles move more easily.  Isn&#x27;t it possible that <br>
the other person&#x27;s hands truly did hurt, and perhaps even more than <br>
yours?  Just ask Dan Gosbee - he was mixing all the cubes (at least <br>
at first) at the WC, and I know he had sore hands as a result.<br>
<br>
On your second point (which was stated much more harshly than <br>
necessary), I think you missed Michael&#x27;s point - the method for <br>
taking the first piece out is the same on a 4x4x4 and 3x3x3, not the <br>
interior mechanism.  You just turn the U side so that a U edge is <br>
above FR, and pry it out.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree with you on the disassembly of Eastsheen 4x4&#x27;s and 5x5&#x27;s. 
Somehow I forgot about those, mostly because I don&#x27;t have any, but 
one of these day&#x27;s I&#x27;ll get around to it.

&quot;could you please use a kinder tone in your responses?&quot;
Ok, your right, sorry. Most of the time I&#x27;m just kidding. I&#x27;ll try 
to keep it down from now on. These are all only opinions here. With 
few execptions, no one of us can give the definative answer to any 
cube question.... but we can try.

&quot;Isn&#x27;t it possible that the other person&#x27;s hands truly did hurt, and 
perhaps even more than yours?&quot;
Of course, just kidding as usual; it was more of the attitude of 
soccer players comparing sports injuries... More making light of how 
cubing isn&#x27;t usually thought of as something that one gets injured 
from.

&quot;Just ask Dan Gosbee - he was mixing all the cubes (at least at 
first) at the WC, and I know he had sore hands as a result.&quot;
Probably, but that&#x27;s not a typical thing to have to do. I do 
apprieciate all the work he has done for us. I think he was more 
bored out of his mind then sore from scrambling according to what I 
heard. And the focus and concentration involved in getting it right 
100% of the time is exhausting I&#x27;m sure.

 If you give two people the exact same method, one

also odd for me to calculate limitis...because the

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
Just to let you know that I started solving corners first a week <br>
after the WC 2003.<br>
My expectation is that I cannot beat my CFOP (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL) <br>
record with it. I do think that it will give me more experience to <br>
improve my times for more advanced CFOP systems.<br>
<br>
The corners first system I currently use is:<br>
1) first layer (systematically)<br>
2) corners of last layer (algorithms)<br>
3) two edges of last layer (algorithms)<br>
4) last two edges of last layer (algorithms)<br>
5) orient middle layer edges (algorithms)<br>
6) permute middle layer edges (algorithms)<br>
<br>
This is basically the Waterman system without combining step 4 and 5.<br>
For combining these steps you need to learn table 3 and 4 of the <br>
Waterman system. These are tough ones! Slowly I am working my way <br>
through the tables, but it will take me some more time.<br>
<br>
At the moment, exactly one month after starting corners first, my <br>
normal averages are sub 24 seconds, with a best of 23.1 seconds:<br>
20 (29) 25 24 22 20 20 26 23 23 23 (19).<br>
I am finally getting used to keeping the last layer on the right and <br>
finishing off the cube using only R, U and M moves.<br>
I am surprised that using this system I only take on average 10 <br>
slice moves per cube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have been doing corners first solves for fun lately.
 While most of my free cubing time is used for
learning the zb method, I find myself mysteriously
pulled towards the corners first method.  With minimal
practice I have learned to do the corners first in
times almost under 30 seconds.  It is definetly a
method worth looking at for all curious.

          <div class="email-content">Yes I agree. The idea of limits is a bit scary... But I believe that 
in the end the best method will not just be a single one, having the 
flexiblity and algorithms of multiple methods will allow for the 
fastest possible times I think.

This a layer-by-layer approach:

1) L side
2) R side
3) &quot;
4) &quot;
5) M slice

But it takes me about 50 seconds on average....

Are you going to change your main speedcubing method to corners first?

I think that about 4 moves per second is the maximum possible average

average. You can do the math.

Say someone can avrage 14 seconds.  Although that is amazing, it should be possible to bring that down to 13.5 seconds.  From there you can improve to 13 seconds, and so on.  The improvements may be less than .5 seconds (.01 seconds), but from there you can always get that &quot;just a little bit faster&quot;  I don&#x27;t really believe in limits to what the mind can acomplish, I just think we can improve our current capabilities.

So in reply to how fast is possible, I would say that with an incredible amount of practice combined with a very talented cubist and an equally good method, it may be possible to average 7 seconds, or possibly even faster.  I know many of you think &quot;7 seconds, what is this guy thinking?&quot;, but what I want to know is, what is your mental cut off?  Another thing to think about is, how close is what you think is possible for yourself to what you achieve? (for example if you know some people go 15 seconds, but you think you are only capible of 25 seconds, my guess is that your average will be about 25-30 seconds)

          <div class="email-content">i think of it as improving our technology rather than improving ourselves.  at one time, people thought the cube could be solved in a minimum of say, 52 moves.  that is down to like 22.  as we find better ways, like less moves incorporated w/ finger tricks, or better finger tricks not thought of, the possibilities are endless.

I think that about 4 moves per second is the maximum possible average 
while solving, and probably 40 moves is the minimum possible moves to 
average. You can do the math.

I don&#x27;t know god&#x27;s algorithm , and i don&#x27;t understand group theory , 
but in theory the limit could be 6-7 secondes if someone can find

  Hello Ron,<br>
  Could you tell a little bit more about your new approach? <br>
  1. How many moves in average for the first layer?<br>
  2. How many moves for the last corners? (That you should know theoretically)<br>
  3. How many moves in all (approximately in average)?<br>
  4. Do you have a feeling that the dispersion is bigger here than in CFOP?<br>
<br>
  (I´m asking, since this approach resembles mine).<br>
<br>
  Regards<br>

<br>
  Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
  Just to let you know that I started solving corners first a week <br>
  after the WC 2003.<br>
  My expectation is that I cannot beat my CFOP (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL) <br>
  record with it. I do think that it will give me more experience to <br>
  improve my times for more advanced CFOP systems.<br>
<br>
  The corners first system I currently use is:<br>
  1) first layer (systematically)<br>
  2) corners of last layer (algorithms)<br>
  3) two edges of last layer (algorithms)<br>
  4) last two edges of last layer (algorithms)<br>
  5) orient middle layer edges (algorithms)<br>
  6) permute middle layer edges (algorithms)<br>
<br>
  This is basically the Waterman system without combining step 4 and 5.<br>
  For combining these steps you need to learn table 3 and 4 of the <br>
  Waterman system. These are tough ones! Slowly I am working my way <br>
  through the tables, but it will take me some more time.<br>
<br>
  At the moment, exactly one month after starting corners first, my <br>
  normal averages are sub 24 seconds, with a best of 23.1 seconds:<br>
  20 (29) 25 24 22 20 20 26 23 23 23 (19).<br>
  I am finally getting used to keeping the last layer on the right and <br>
  finishing off the cube using only R, U and M moves.<br>
  I am surprised that using this system I only take on average 10 <br>
  slice moves per cube.<br>
<br>
  Anyway: corners first is fun!<br>
<br>
  Have fun,<br>
<br>

Just ask Him!

Some gods are even smarter than computers, they can solve the cube in
5 moves, and with the feet. That&#x27;s called miracles.

          <div class="email-content">It is an Idea, but is it practical?

I do not have 5 speedcubes, most speedcubers have 2 some 3 speedcubes

So I gues this can only be performed using normal cubes.

But with 2 or 3 speedcubes you can think of a small marathon race, 
where you have 1 cube that will be uncovered. While you begin the 
next one is placed on the table, after you finshed your cube will be 
again scrambeld and so on, until 10 cube solves.

The only unpractical is that this will require a speedy scrambler 
since he/she must scramble a specific pattern for a offical contest.

          <div class="email-content">When I first brought up the idea of limits in my cube log on my site, I was <br>
specifically talking about the Fridrich method with no other random <br>
memorized stuff, using ONLY what you know about the cross, F2L, OLL, and <br>
PLL. I don&#x27;t think less than (maybe) 14.1 - 14.4 is possible any time soon. No <br>
extended cross should be used because that&#x27;s not &quot;pure Fridrich&quot;.<br>
<br>
When people talk about limits there will have to be an ultimate method that <br>
has the following criteria:<br>
<br>
1. few steps (a 4-step solution will be faster than an 8-step solution).<br>
2. not too many sequences to learn. (not exactly)<br>
3. allows for little delays between steps<br>
4. every sequence is customized for fastest execution<br>
5. intuition and flexibility with options at the beginning (Heise method follows <br>
that).<br>
6. end steps use specific cases that (should) average about 10 moves. This <br>
allows for the last step or two to be executed in only about 2-2.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
#2 above is not exactly true as some people brought up with the chess <br>
players. When I printed out all of Peter&#x27;s moves for the Fridrich method, I had <br>
10 pages to learn. It took me about two and a half months to learn all that. <br>
How long does it take a chess master to learn 500 pages? How much time <br>
and dedication do you need to learn all that? Few people would ever be able <br>
to do all of that right away. Also, there aren&#x27;t any methods right now that fill up <br>
500 pages. However, with Ryan&#x27;s system, you can average down to 45 moves <br>
and you&#x27;re only required to learn about the same as the Fridrich method <br>
(maybe a little more or less). I see an average of 13 or possibly sub-13 <br>
seconds possible with his system.<br>
<br>
When the subject of limits are discussed, what solving method are you <br>
referring to? There are different methods, and some that haven&#x27;t been <br>
discovered, but in the end, the limits might approach 10 seconds on average.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve had the same problems as well.
 
Second ?: U and u have to do with the notation of the Revenge. On a regular 3x3 you have U(up)D(down)F(front)B(back)r(right)L(left) for denoting the different sides. On the Revenge, there are two layers for each side, so the outer layer is labeled with a capitalized letter, and the inner layer with a lowercase layer. The asterisk for a counterclockwise twist and the 2 for a half twist still apply.
 
Example: Looking at the Revenge from the front, the far left slice would be referred to as &quot;L&quot;, the second from left &quot;l&quot;, the third from left &quot;r&quot;, and the far right one would be &quot;R&quot;. Understand? The same goes for the UD and FB sets. (See below for an illustration)
 
Third ?: First of all, a parity error is something that can never happen on a properly put together 3x3 cube. In the case of the 4x4 ( and all sizes beyond it), in some cases when you put together the centers (or edges) you don&#x27;t match them up correctly, and this messes with the placing of them. An example would be what you have: the two edge pieces that are red that are on the green side and the two pieces that are green that are on the blue side were misplaced when you put together the centers, so you would have to have them switch places for the cube to be solved.
 
First ?: Now to what the algorithm does. You now know how to read the notation, so you should be able to do the algorithm fine. What it does is take the four cubies that are on the top face in the &quot;r&quot; position and switch them with the ones in the &quot;l&quot; position.
Example:
I&#x27;ve labeled the four slices in this illustration. You&#x27;re looking at the cube from the top. The two sets of cubies that are switched are labeled a and b. The rest of the cubies are labeled x.
L l  r  R-> L l  r  R
x a b x -> x b a x
x a b x -> x b a x
x a b x -> x b a x
x a b x -> x b a x
 
I hope this made sense.

	I still have a few questions:
	First, what does all that do?
	Second, what&#x27;s the difference between U and u?
	Also, what&#x27;s a parity problem?
	
	Thanks!

&gt;#2 above is not exactly true as some people brought up with the chess<br>
&gt;players. When I printed out all of Peter&#x27;s moves for the Fridrich<br>
&gt;method, I had<br>
&gt;10 pages to learn. It took me about two and a half months to learn all that.<br>
&gt;How long does it take a chess master to learn 500 pages? How much time<br>
&gt;and dedication do you need to learn all that? Few people would ever be<br>
&gt;able to do all of that right away.<br>
<br>
These guys are very talented full time professionals. It takes them <br>
many years of full time work to learn all that. They don&#x27;t just <br>
memorize moves, but have to understand the ideas behind them, etc. I <br>
could talk chess all day, but I&#x27;m getting off topic. Sorry.<br>
<br>
&gt;Also, there aren&#x27;t any methods right now that fill up 500 pages.<br>
<br>
You could learn all the 1211 optimal final layer algorithms. That <br>
should keep anyone busy for a while...<br>
<br>
Though I&#x27;m not sure that is the best way even if you can put in that <br>
kind of effort. Is it possible to keep 1200 10-14 move sequences so <br>
well practiced that you can execute them in world class speed with <br>
less than a seconds notice? I don&#x27;t know, but I doubt it. I think <br>
there is a better way.<br>

 <br>
If you are extremely devoted to cubing, it is possible to memorize that 1200 some algs for the LL.  If each alg is 10-15 moves, and the cube is turned at 5-6 moves per second (going full speed; no looking ahead needed).  This gives you a 2-2.5ish second LL plus say, two seconds to find the alg.  If you could get your F2L in 7.5 seconds (6 move cross, 6 moves for each CE pair (it is possible) @ 4 moves a second = 7.5 seconds) you would have an average of 9.5-10 seconds. With practice you could turn the cube faster, use less time recognizing LL alg, etc. to get even faster.<br>
 <br>
If you used something similar to ZZ&#x27;s method, you would have to memorize MANY more algs, but could go even faster.<br>
 <br>
A computer takes a very long time to figure out the 21 turn sequence that will solve a fully scrambled cube, but the computer cannot actually think and look ahead at turns.  Therefore the computer is forced to actually see what the cube would look like for each combonation of turns, then figure out which combonation solves the cube.  The human mind is capible of seeing ahead and thinking (i hope)  so it may be possible for someone to use god&#x27;s algorithm.  It has been done on the Pyraminx and 2x2x2 cube.  Then if you could get the algorithm figured out, you should be able to turn the cube at 4-5 turns (almost full speed, some looking ahead) to get an avrage time of less than 5 seconds.<br>
This could also be improved on by getting faster turning possibly up to 7 turns a second (with finger tricks) to get a time of 3 seconds! (assuming the cube dosn&#x27;t break)  This would obviously take a more devoted cubist than I think anyone is, but I think it is theoretically possible.<br>

*** slight technicality - &quot;algorithms for the 1200 some cases of the 
LL&quot; (there are easily 10,000 algs for LL since different algs may 
solve for identical cases even if they are of the same length in the 
choosen metric)

per second (going full speed; no looking ahead needed).  This gives 
you a 2-2.5ish second LL plus say, two seconds to find the alg.
*** Some LL algs are even as short as 6 quarter turns (we all know 
which one that&#x27;d be), but according to my myterious alg 
database &#x27;nice&#x27; LL algs may be as long as 20QTs (for 8 such cases 
solved by L²B²R²F&#x27;D&#x27;FR²DR&#x27;FRD&#x27;B²L², RB²DLBD²RF²R&#x27;DR&#x27;BUBU²B&#x27;,

name a few (not all 8 are present) and show how different algs solve 
for the identical case:)), if you prefer HTM the non-trivial ones 
range from 6 to 16 (luckily only one cases requiring 16HTs, it&#x27;s 
solved by F&#x27;L²BLB&#x27;U²BL&#x27;B&#x27;L²UFU&#x27;RU²R&#x27; in case anyone&#x27;s interested), 
this result&#x27;s the same for STM btw. Oh and sorry about the LL on 
bottom thing, I am still in the habit of doing. When you say find 
the alg, I assume you mean recall it and not look it up on a table.

> If you could get your F2L in 7.5 seconds (6 move cross, 6 moves

you would have an average of 9.5-10 seconds. With practice you could 
turn the cube faster, use less time recognizing LL alg, etc. to get 
even faster.
*** This is of course best case senerio, 7 move cross seems like a 
more conservative estimate, but 6 is possible for c/e pair average 
by picking a good order to do them. From people that practice the 
Fridrich method, that I&#x27;ve talked to, it seems some tend to go for 
sub0optimal ones just to incorporate some good triggers, which I 
think is worth it.


> If you used something similar to ZZ&#x27;s method, you would have to

*** Yep.

*** Not quite true, the very intelligent programs out there can 
kinda see ahead... they have large lookup tables and can detect dead-
end type paths.

theoretically possible.
*** I think 7 turns per second is realistic... Perhaps not sustained 
for too long though.


*** As many people have said, learning a ton of LL algs isn&#x27;t going 
to help with speed much. For me recognition starts to kill my times. 
As for devotion and all that... I am in the proccess, still, of 
learning a high percentage of algs for all LL cases. I know it&#x27;s not 
going to help me much, but at least for me it has novelty value.

          <div class="email-content">My gut reaction is to say that it might not be as efficient but I 
say that only because I am ridiculously biased to the way I do it 
now, since I&#x27;ve done it that way for so long.  When I really think 
about doing it that way though, I think it could be just as fast if 
not faster.  If you memorized all the algs required to do the 2x2x2 
in 10 seconds (just looking at the UWR lists) then as long as you 
had a fast way to build the corners you could do this very quickly.  
Also note that solving by 2x2x2 blocks would make it relatively easy 
to solve a picute 4x4x4 cube.  Plus spinning only two layers all the 
time goes very quickly.  I think this approach could be fast as 
well, as long as you had an elegant way of putting the corners 
together.  My brain is wired for solving into a 3x3x3 but I tried 
this and inefficiently got two 2x2x2 blocks built but my approach 
doesn&#x27;t look to promising, I would definitely have to rethink it.  
One thing I&#x27;m thinking is to build 2x2x1 sections all the way around 
the cube, then solve the sections into 2x2x2 corners, or maybe even 
direct solve the cube out of these 2x2x1 sections.  Anyway I&#x27;m just 
throwing out some ideas, but I think this method with sufficient 
practice could be just as fast as solving into a 3x3x3, if not 
faster since solving as a 2x2x2 will go very quickly with 
specialized algs.

My two cents,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">If it is in a 2x2x2 form it would be faster to solve

To place the edges at the corners is more or less the same as making 
pairs, but this is much harder to see 

The real problem is the centers it would be very hard to see, since 
this looks like a mixed pattern this would require a new method and a 
lot of training.

I gues the best 2x2x2 type method would be a corners first system, 
but this is some thing else as 2x2x2 segments

          <div class="email-content">ok, Now, its the parity problem.  better get used to it.  it happens about every other time. if you still have my penultimate email, you can use that alg to fix it up.  if you dont, go to speedcubing.com/chris go to solving the revenge and go to, i think it was step 3, and it will show a cube with 2 edges flipped.  if you havent tried to solve the LL like a 3x3, do so untill you have everything solved except your flipped edge, and use that alg.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ton,

   It may be a tad impractical to find many excellent cubes for a
competition set up like that, but take what I said as an example.

   This can be done one cube at a time. There are many ways that a
mixed cube can be covered before the start, and it shouldn&#x27;t be too
hard to start the timer as soon as the cube is visible.

   For your scenario it might be easy sometime in the future to have a
computerised scrambling machine.

   Solving the 4x4x4 in 2x2x2 blocks and then solving it as a 2x2x2 is
fun.

   What Ton said is true: it is hard to recognize what you need to
move, but that&#x27;s only at first. Once you&#x27;re used to it that might be a
very fast way to solve it.

   I&#x27;m not into solving it as fast as possible. I like to take my time
and try to get a good handle on it.

          <div class="email-content">I have some doubts now about testing the limits of cubing with this 
method. I went to Jess&#x27; timer and picked a scramble, namely

U B2 F L D&#x27; B L2 D&#x27; U B2 R F&#x27; B2 L&#x27; D U&#x27; L2 R2 D2 
F2 L&#x27; F2 R2 D&#x27; U&#x27;

and began using it over and over for one handed solves. I prefer 
averages of three, so here are a couple averages of three repeating 
this scramble.

(44.07) (34.82) 36.40 43.61 39.15 = 39.72
34.07 (38.75) 37.27 38.64(drop) (32.27) = 36.66

after that my hand starting getting tired since I had done 4-5 warm 
up trials as well so my times started suffering pretty bad.

Anyway I don&#x27;t think this is a good estimate of the limits for one 
handed cubing in that it did help to know what cases were coming up 
next, but I noticed that one handed cubing seems to be all about the 
moves you do. A couple of sections during this solve were 
very &quot;clumbsy&quot; for me using one hand in that I had to reach very far 
across the cube or push faces with my ring finger which is slower 
than being able to pull a face with another finger. Anyway I 
remember my 29.80 solve being none other than &quot;beautiful&quot;. It was 
non lucky but every alg blended right into the next one and there 
were no &quot;clumbsy&quot; sections during the solve. This method only tests 
the pros and cons of one solve, which had I picked a better scramble 
for my hands I could have gotten a much faster average. So I don&#x27;t 
think one scramble can well represent one handed solving.

I then put down the one handed cube and got out my speed cube to 
practice this alg (the same alg and same solution as I used for one 
handed) and did an average. Here is what I got,

Warm up times:
14.55 18.86 16.91 14.32 15.42 13.50 15.86 12.97 12.54 12.77 13.78 
13.87 

The average: 

[13.42 13.18 14.29 (15.43) 13.00 12.93 13.88 13.20 12.24 (11.58) 
12.41 13.99] = 13.25

Again I still doubt this method as a way of testing the limits of 
cubing since this solve had a semi-decent extended cross (8 moves). 
Also the orientation alg was one of my faster ones and the 
permutation alg was the simple three edge cycle. Also I had already 
done this scramble several times for one handed so I was a little 
used to it before I even started doing two handed trials.

I see this method to be exactly like cupstacking. Some sections of 
the solution go really fast and some are not so fast but you have to 
practice to make them fast anyway. This is like cupstacking, the 
down stacking is ridiculously fast, but stacking the 10 pyramid 
takes a lot more time.

So anyway I just want to add that though I think this is a fun 
exercise to do, it does not judge how fast the limits of cubing are 
(1 or 2 handed). If I were to devote all of my practice to the above 
scramble for a year, I could probably get sub-10 or even sub-9 or 
sub-8 second times on a good cube no problem.

Also it depends on the scramble you chose. Mine had an ok extended 
cross and a semi-fast LL, a scramble without a good EC and with a 
slow LL would have yielded a slower average.

My two cents,
Chris

P.S. for those interested my solution was

EC: U&#x27;RD&#x27;RU&#x27;BD&#x27;R&#x27;
F2L: UBU&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27;U2R - F&#x27;U2F - U&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27;LU&#x27;FUF&#x27;
OLL: B&#x27;R&#x27;FR&#x27;F&#x27;RFR&#x27;F&#x27;R2B
PLL: U&#x27;F2ULR&#x27;F2L&#x27;RUF2

47 moves in total

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys,

   Do we get to name all the algorithms that we found on our own? I&#x27;ve
got about 30 that I&#x27;m particularly proud of.

   I know that some of these have been found by, dare I say it,
thousands of people, like &quot;sune.&quot; Having thousands of names wouldn&#x27;t
help. But maybe it would be better than having many of them named
after some computer program.

    Maybe we can code name some of them after, say, the seven dwarves.
For example, the algorithms that solve the corners where two adjacent
corners are upright and the other two adjacent corners are rotated to
where the Up side of the corners face away from each other, we could
name after &quot;Dopey&quot; for being wall-eyed.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   Interesting. I&#x27;ve done this before, but I&#x27;ll try that mix next week
some time...

   That mix can be applied to the cube 24 different ways. How about
trying out the same mix starting with the cube &quot;upside down&quot; from
where you already mixed it.

   Maybe one of those 24 mixes would be a &quot;lucky&quot; mix for you.

   I wonder what percentage of mixes (done the 24 ways) would always
turn out a &quot;lucky&quot; mix for a particular strategy. I don&#x27;t have enough
data to even guess how often this might happen given random mixes, but
the thought is intriguing.

   Hmmm... Maybe if one could solve the cube starting from any color
that they might be able to eventually spot any lucky mix. 

   Anyone else have thuoghts on this? Ryan, Doug, Gilles, Grant,
Simon? Anybody?

   Regards,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
  I&#x27;m in a goofy kinda mood so I thought I&#x27;d post this.  I recently <br>
stumbled across www.bwgen.com .  It&#x27;s some kind of application that <br>
emits specific frequencies to each ear and &quot;melds&quot; them inside your <br>
brain to make it do tricks, like focus better, relax, or take out the <br>
trash.  I know, most likely a lot of bologna.<br>
  So I gave it a shot, put on some headphones and tried cubing to the <br>
(rather annoying) tones it output.  My times went completely in the <br>
gutter.  Whether that was a function of being annoyed, trying too <br>
hard, or what I don&#x27;t know.  Thought I&#x27;d post it in case it actually <br>
DOES end up helping someone.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I know there&#x27;s tons of other algs. But I think most of them are the 
short F2L algs or for corners first. Basically what I was saying is, 
many people learn just the permutation and orientation algorithms, 
and not very many people learn the F2L ones. Well, people memorize 
them just by doing them a lot, not by actually reading them and 
implanting them into your mind.
Of course, the corners first people will probably want to name a lot 
of those ones, but I have no idea how most of those work. So I can&#x27;t 
help there.

          <div class="email-content">I think to be fair you have to pick a top and front color and stick 
with it for the scramble, this should be choosen before the 
scramble. It&#x27;s funny how the WC2003 people asked us about this just 
before they scrambled, just to be argumentative, I asked what 
purpose it held if any, LOL. 1) It really doesn&#x27;t matter; they said 
it had to do with personal preference and/or superstition. 2) They 
only wanted a top color and nothing else so the full orientation of 
the cube is still not well-defined. (Hee, a word I just used like 
1000 times in my math hw..., I like it when others share, hope 
people don&#x27;t mine.)

Ideally the solver picks to solve, say cross on red or something 
different to what they&#x27;re used to (assuming Fridrich method). I am 
at the point where I can go top to bottom or bottom to top, color-
wise, I hope people understant what I mean. So the c/e pairs are the 
same colors just to give an analogy to the mainstream method. I know 
that some day I&#x27;ll be able to do stuff like after the 2x2x3 block in 
Petrus method to go in either of the 2 directions, also an analogy 
to the non-sensical method I use, but this one closer then I care to 
admit.

I can&#x27;t speak for the other methods out there but in mine, I don&#x27;t 
think it matters too much because I already built in enough 
flexibility by choosing 1 of 4. Lars himself I know can go in any of 
the 24 or so different ways so he really optimizes on this. Actaully 
come to think of it, he&#x27;d be the perfect person to answer your 
questions.

There are more methods then the OLL/PLL and Corners First, it&#x27;s just 
better to be more general in your statements. But I agree with you 
on the point that c/e pairing algs shouldn&#x27;t count as true algs,

Not only algs for _solving systems etc._, but even algs for a certain &#x27;cool pattern&#x27; or something (look on fridrich&#x27;s site, there&#x27;s a link to a list of like 9 billion different cube patterns).  i&#x27;m talking like, one of those.  but i guess it&#x27;s all up to me to name it or not.

          <div class="email-content">Finally a simple question with a simple answer. 1) 50-56 is a good 
average number of face turns for speedsolving, and in general the 
faster one tries to go the more turns they will be doing, when one 
goes slower they find more intelligent paths, probabilistically 
speaking. 2) I assume you mean Fridrich F2L and Fridrich LL with OLL 
and PLL? (The term F2L only stands for First 2 Layers, which is a 
very-broad category making the question very complicated to answer.) 
I would say 20. Eh, 20 to 22.

The faster guys tend to be on the low end of these estimates of 
course. And using less orthodox methods may yield even better 
numbers as in my personal system. And exploiting the various 
symmetries of the cube from start to finish will allow for more 
favorable solves. There are a few other types of these heuristics 
that I don&#x27;t care to mention here that would greatly take the number 
down to say 42 FTs easily executable and recognizable by us 
speedcubists.

          <div class="email-content">Just to clearify for those people out there that are out for blood: 
By replying to this post, I am in no ways declearing that I am &quot;one 
of the fast cubers&quot; or in any other ways being egotistical. All I 
ever intend to do is answer any questions posted, in a timely manner 
(and perhaps share a bit about myself whenever appropriate), even 
though I realize I am posting &#x27;way&#x27; too much in the past couple 
weeks. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want to give other people a chance to 
answer questions, others are welcome to correct me, append to it, or 
simply answer the question from scratch.

Ok, so there are various spheres of thought on this type of 
question, i.e. maximum improvement with minimum memorization effort. 
I am not bashing on those attempting this type of stuff, 
it&#x27;s &quot;practical,&quot; but at the same time notice that I used the 
word &quot;improvement&quot; and not &quot;benefit&quot; or &quot;long-term benefit&quot;...

My response would be (the not so important responds) would be that 
depending on the 3-look sytem of course, but I&#x27;ll assume 2 quick OLL 
looks and a quick PLL, I think it is possible to get down to 30s 
flat but probably not too much better.

Now the shocking answer, is that Gilles claims that it is possible 
(he does it) to get sub-25 &quot;easily,&quot; probably like a bit under 23ish 
if I recall correctly from what I read from him (he&#x27;ll be able to 
correct me on this). To reiterate, I am in no ways criticizing his 
opinion (others opinions), it&#x27;s just that I may have my own that 
doesn&#x27;t completely agree with his (someone elses).

          <div class="email-content">As far as I know (or remember), 19.9seconds has been Dan Knights&#x27; 
fastest average for 10 consecutive cubes using a 3looks-LL-method 
for more than one year. 

So Dan himself can probably do it a bit faster now.

And of course, every speedcubist faster than him with should be able 
to do it faster than Dan.

That&#x27;s why I think an average in the 18&#x27;s with a 3 looks LL is 
completely feasible.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Doug for a clear answer to my number of moves question.  (I don&#x27;t know what Fridrich is but I&#x27;ve seen it often enough to realise I need to find out!  I also dont know what OLL and PLL stand for but I guess I&#x27;ll find out if I search for the Fridrich algorithm.)

It seems pretty clear as I thought that if I get my LL down to 20-22 then my own algorithm will come down to 50-55 which sounds about right.  Having picked up a cube about three weeks ago for the first time in years I am down to about 45-50 seconds average so this should help a lot.

I still don&#x27;t know what finger tricks are though - does this just mean quick and easily recognisable moves?

I&#x27;d be interested to know whether the algorithms that the other one-handed cubists use differ at all from the standard speedcubing approach to take into account the limitations (mine don&#x27;t but you guys seem much more sophisticated!).

          <div class="email-content">Just for fun I decided to do a 3-look LL average of 10:

19.97 19.69 20.71 19.10 17.83 (21.66) 21.14 (16.00) 19.11 18.00 19.91 
21.33 => 19.68

So at full speed, the difference between 2-look LL and 3-look LL is 
probably 1-1.5 seconds. The difference in terms of number of moves is 
also only 4.9 moves on average. I also feel that learning the 2-look 
LL only pays off when you can perform _all_ algorithms at full speed. 
So learning a 2-look LL only becomes important when you are already 
sub-30 or maybe even sub-25.

It seems pretty clear as I thought that if I get my LL down to 20-22 then my own algorithm will come down to 50-55 which sounds about right.  Having picked up a cube about three weeks ago for the first time in years I am down to about 45-50 seconds average so this should help a lot.

I still don&#x27;t know what finger tricks are though - does this just mean quick and easily recognisable moves?

I&#x27;d be interested to know whether the algorithms that the other one-handed cubists use differ at all from the standard speedcubing approach to take into account the limitations (mine don&#x27;t but you guys seem much more sophisticated!).

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: A couple of questions


  Finally a simple question with a simple answer. 1) 50-56 is a good 
  average number of face turns for speedsolving, and in general the 
  faster one tries to go the more turns they will be doing, when one 
  goes slower they find more intelligent paths, probabilistically 
  speaking. 2) I assume you mean Fridrich F2L and Fridrich LL with OLL 
  and PLL? (The term F2L only stands for First 2 Layers, which is a 
  very-broad category making the question very complicated to answer.) 
  I would say 20. Eh, 20 to 22.

  The faster guys tend to be on the low end of these estimates of 
  course. And using less orthodox methods may yield even better 
  numbers as in my personal system. And exploiting the various 
  symmetries of the cube from start to finish will allow for more 
  favorable solves. There are a few other types of these heuristics 
  that I don&#x27;t care to mention here that would greatly take the number 
  down to say 42 FTs easily executable and recognizable by us 
  speedcubists.

          <div class="email-content">As far as how my one handed approach differs from my speedcubing 
approach, I can only speak for myself here, the only portion of my 
method that I actually change is the first step.  When doing it one 
handed, and this is something I&#x27;m still working on, I try to always 
use an extended cross approach rather than doing the cross and first 
corner edge pair, I detail this approach at 
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/f2l.html

Most of my changes in my one handed solving are changes in style.  
For example, and this might answer your question about finger 
tricks, I clump different moves together to form one handed finger 
tricks, or the simpler one handed &quot;move combo&quot; version of finger 
tricks.  Basically a finger trick is any group of moves that you can 
clump together into one hand motion by utilizing your fingers.  For 
example a two handed finger trick would be to turn the right face 
once clockwise using a wrist motion, then turn the top face 
counterclockwise once by allowing your thumb to catch the U face 
during the R turn and continue pushing to turn the face.  This 
trigger would be written (RU&#x27;) in brackets to indicate that it is a 
finger shortcut if it were written in notation.  Dan Knight&#x27;s has an 
excellent page describing finger tricks, including videos at 
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints

A one handed true to form finger trick would be to grip the cube 
(left handed since I do it lefty :) ) with your thumb on the front 
face and middle finger on the back face (allow the right and top 
faces to be free to turn).  Now place your index finger on the left 
side sticker of the corner in UBL (the intersection of the Left Back 
and Up faces).  Now push the U face to turn U clockwise one quarter 
turn and once that face lines up again (without stopping the motion 
of your hand) pull the R face to do R&#x27;.  So the trigger is (UR&#x27;) and 
this does two turns all in one hand motion.

Sorry for the side track, but I wanted to answer your question about 
finger tricks as well.

Basically for one handed solving I clump different moves together 
for one hand triggers.  The 3 corner cycle is a good example.  Two 
handed I would perform
(R2 B2) (RFR&#x27;) (B2RF&#x27;R)
clumping lots of moves together.  However the fastest way I&#x27;ve found 
to do this one handed is,
[R2] [B2] R (FR&#x27;) [B2] [RF&#x27;R]

Here the brackets [ and ] mean a move combo (I alternate fingers to 
do the moves, usually between my ring finger and index finger) and 
the parenthesis ( and ) mean a finger trick, i.e. doing all the  
moves listed in one hand motion.  I do all double turns as move 
combos, alternating fingers to flick two quarter turns.

Also for one handed since you are physically limited in speed to 
around 2 moves per second, you are able to look ahead much better 
than during speed solving, where you reach about 3 moves per second 
or faster.  In this respect I change only my style of cubing.  In 
speedcubing, for the first two layers, in order to save time I tend 
to place the first corner edge pair that I see (the fridrich method, 
after completing the cross, places the corner and edge of each slot 
at the same time).  In one handed cubing I will usually try to 
locate all of my options and try to choose the fastest one for one 
handed (usually shortest moves or one where I can use a finger 
trick).  This allows you to perform the solution in slightly fewer 
moves on average (or using faster moves), which helps save your hand 
strength over the course of a solve.

If you&#x27;re learning the Fridrich last layer I would very strongly 
recommend also learning how to do the algs one handed as well.  I 
suggest this only because I had to go through each alg and &quot;relearn&quot; 
them for one handed after I decided to learn to use the method one 
handed.  You would save time to go ahead and learn the method for 
speedcubing and also for one handed if you&#x27;re interested in using 
this method for one handed solves.

Hope this helps some,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">My view seem slightly different than what others seem to think on the <br>
subject.  I used the 4 Look ll for over a year, my average was almost <br>
exactly 30s. That is an average of 50 or so cubes with none discarded <br>
would be 30s +-.5s, pretty exactly.<br>
  I started learning the 3 look ll (OLLE, OLLC, PLL) about a month <br>
and a half ago, and memorized all the necessary algs in about a week <br>
to a week and a half.  My average of 50 or so cubes is now around 26s <br>
+-.5s .   I have knocked off over 3 seconds from my PB average as <br>
well as my avg avg.  And about 2s from my PB solve ever.  And the <br>
times are continuing to drop, though not quite so dramatically.<br>
<br>
I consider myself an average cuber, and I think a 23s average for an <br>
average cuber is entirely within the realm of possibilities using a 3 <br>
look ll. (I get a LOT of 22&#x27;s and the like now).  Below that I don&#x27;t <br>
know if us average people without superhuman dexterity and <br>
recognition can get too much off of that, but I&#x27;d be willing to bet <br>
it&#x27;s possible.  When I hit an avg avg of about 23-24s, I&#x27;ll probably <br>
start learnign all the OLL algs.<br>

          <div class="email-content">So the consensus appears to be that it&#x27;s totally possible to get very 
fast times with a 3-look LL. I&#x27;m glad to hear this because I don&#x27;t 
think I have the commitment at the moment to learn a full 2-look 
LL. ;)

I did 37.9s the other day, which is my best time on the 3x3x3. It 
wasn&#x27;t lucky because there were no steps skipped, it just happened 
that all the LL algs I needed were ones that I liked (there are some 
others that I still find quite awkward to execute).

I think my average is actually somewhere in the 50-60s range though. 
So I guess there&#x27;s still heaps of potential improvement if I practise 
3-look LL solves.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!<br>
<br>
After reading about solving the cube in as few moves as possible i <br>
hav come to the conclusion that there should be 3 different <br>
categories:<br>
<br>
1) Unlimited time with unlimited number of tries<br>
<br>
- One should write down the scrambling algorithm so that it can be <br>
reapplied. One can follow several tracks and also use extra stickers <br>
to mark cubicles  for efficient &quot;algorithm insertion&quot; points. This is <br>
what Mirek Goljan does on the 3x3x3 cube.<br>
<br>
2) One try is allowed, with a few &quot;take-back&quot; moves along the way<br>
<br>
- No extra stickers allowed. One is allowed to take back some moves <br>
along the way if one regrets them. One should not use excessive time: <br>
ie something like 15 minutes on a 3x3x3 and 1 hr on a 4x4x4 cube. <br>
This is the way i solve the 3x3x3 supercube (facecenters must be <br>
correctly oriented)<br>
<br>
3) No take back of moves allowed at all. No extra stickers.<br>
<br>
- This is very strict and does not allow to take back moves made by <br>
mistake. This requires more careful thinking and planning and can <br>
ruin an otherwise god &quot;solution track&quot;. I never follow those rules <br>
myself cause for sure it will ruin my average ;-)<br>
<br>
Anyone has any comments on this?<br>
<br>
By the way this is my first posting here. So hello everyone :-)<br>

&gt;    I wonder what percentage of mixes (done the 24 ways) would always<br>
&gt; turn out a &quot;lucky&quot; mix for a particular strategy. I don&#x27;t have enough<br>
&gt; data to even guess how often this might happen given random mixes, but<br>
&gt; the thought is intriguing.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    Hmmm... Maybe if one could solve the cube starting from any color<br>
&gt; that they might be able to eventually spot any lucky mix. <br>
<br>
Sure, but only for the first X pieces, where X is nowhere near 20 :-)<br>
(For me, X is about 4, but sometimes 6.)<br>
<br>
It seems that most people using the Fridrich system always start on the<br>
same side. I don&#x27;t believe this is necessary. For both Guimond and<br>
Petrus, the act of picking a good side/corner to start with is built<br>
into their systems.<br>
<br>
- For Guimond: pick a side that has exactly 3 corners oriented<br>
  correctly, and start there.<br>
- For Petrus: pick a corner that is already joined with an edge, and<br>
  start there.<br>
<br>
You do not need to look through all 24 symmetries because these good<br>
cases just jump out at you.<br>
<br>
My own opening goes something like this:<br>
<br>
First, pick a good square to start with. Initially, I just hold the<br>
optimal solution for that square in my head (2-4 moves). Then I look for<br>
other pieces that can be easily solved (or are already solved). That<br>
means inserting some moves into the solution (start/middle/end).<br>
<br>
Two options:<br>
<br>
1. the edge to make a 2x2x2 block<br>
2. some other corner/edge pair<br>
<br>
Or sometimes, both. This is made easier by the fact that when you join<br>
two pieces together, you can consider them as one unit. If I get a mix<br>
where there are two corner/edge pairs already joined, it is especially<br>
easy (my system can make use of any corner/edge pair).<br>

frustrating to be inbetween 3 systems.<br>

i useually do a 4 look like this orient endges, position corners, orient corners, position <br>
edges. in my 3 look i will do orient edges, orient corners, permute all.<br>
<br>
if i try the 3 look and after orienting the corners come to an position where i dont know <br>
the alg i&#x27;m kinda stuck. after reading a bit on Dan K&#x27;s intermediate solution page, i saw that <br>
he has a list over the different ways of doing the 4 look, including one that&#x27;s like this :<br>
<br>
31.1: orient edges(6.0),     orient corners(7.9),   position corners(8.3), position edges(8.9)<br>
<br>
Here he gives an average alg length of 8.3 on the position corner. since i can use my usual <br>
algs on the 3 other steps, and if it&#x27;s just a couple of short algs to learn for the position of <br>
the corners, this could be a nice in between solution.<br>
<br>
does anyone know the algs that i need to position the corners on the LL without disturbing <br>
the orientation of the edges and corners ?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree with you that it would be useful if we (all interested) agree 
on specifics of these three categories. Since it is kind of my domain 
you may want to hear my opinion. There it is:
I basically go with your 3 categories as you named them. The first 
and the last have already been here for a while. I do not know what 
is a good time to choose, I only know what is good for me :-). I 
suggest 10 minutes, and if the cube is not solved yet then ... too 
bad. 
It is hard to judge as a third party if the &quot;take-back&quot; moves are 
correctly processed. IMHO, 1 take-back move is just enough. 
It&#x27;s a long time I haven&#x27;t tried this. Has enyone beat my unoficial 
best average 41 moves in category 3?  
Lately, I enjoyed category 1 which is the weekly contest organized by 
Dan Harris. I hope he would resume the contest soon once he adjusts 
his schedule to his new university life. BTW, good luck in classes, 
Harris!

I miss the Sunday Contest too though, would love to see it start up

It&#x27;s my first cube, about six (6) months old. I have just cubed with 
it a lot. One thing that really helps that I had avoided doing prior 
to getting the cube in this state is washing the pieces individual, 
and wiping down all of the gunk off of the core. Then lay all of the 
pieces down and spray one coat of silicon on, let it dry, and spray 
another on. If you can, get some silicone on all of the core&#x27;s inner 
plastic pieces. Be careful not to get silicon in that seam where the 
white core meets the black plastic. Then put it together and be rough 
on it. I like doing the (RU&#x27;R) algoithm with your thumb and being 
very rough on the cube, forcing it and grinding the plastic with the 
plastic itself. Do this on all sides until it feels loose. 

Also I have found that after you lube a cube (a day or so later) if

&gt;    I wonder what percentage of mixes (done the 24 ways) would always<br>
&gt; turn out a &quot;lucky&quot; mix for a particular strategy. I don&#x27;t have<br>
&gt; enough data to even guess how often this might happen given random<br>
&gt; mixes, but the thought is intriguing.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve wondered about this myself.  This is essentially the approach I <br>
take when I do the fewest moves challenge (only actually submitted a <br>
solution once so far, but ...).  I was thinking it&#x27;d be cool to write <br>
up a program that would apply a standard Fridrich method to random <br>
cube states in all 24 directions.  Another thing you could do is try <br>
going through the F2L c/e pairs in the different possible orders.  <br>
Then, you could give the program a bunch of scrambles, and see how it <br>
does.  With 24 cube orientations to start from, plus doing c/e pairs <br>
in all possible paths, you have as many as 24x4x3x2=576 potential <br>
different outcomes.  Surely at least a couple of these have to be <br>
fairly lucky!<br>
<br>
&gt;    Hmmm... Maybe if one could solve the cube starting from any color<br>
&gt; that they might be able to eventually spot any lucky mix. <br>
<br>
I would have to say, I doubt it.  Unless you are able to skip a step <br>
fairly early on in your solution (e.g. putting in 1 or 2 F2L pairs <br>
with the cross), I&#x27;d think that there must be too much that changes <br>
on the cube to be able to tell from the starting position whether you <br>
can skip a later step in your solution.<br>

I posted, and then realized my error... The 24 cube directions takes <br>
into account the first c/e pair (by cube orientation), making it only <br>
24x3x2 = 144.  That still leaves pretty good chances of hitting a <br>

          <div class="email-content">As others have said or hinted at already, if you can get it into a <br>
2x2x2 setup quickly, then the rest should come quickly.  <br>
Unfortunately, in trying this approach so far, I haven&#x27;t found any <br>
good way of getting to that point.  That doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t <br>
one, but I don&#x27;t see it.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way - since the first of the solution would be to <br>
solve the 2x2x2 blocks (surrounding the corners), you are solving the <br>
edges and centers in relation to the corner pieces.  This sounds <br>
remarkably similar to a corners first approach.  Now, granted, the <br>
corners don&#x27;t have to be solved first, or even stay in the same <br>
relationship to each other during the solution, but it&#x27;s pretty much <br>
the same thing.  Chris&#x27; idea of creating 2x2x1 sections sounded <br>
interesting at first, but even with that, you seem to very quickly <br>
get too many separate groups to reasonably keep track of.<br>
<br>
Unless you have incredibly fast fingers/mind, like Masayuki (who uses <br>
somewhat of a corners first approach), you&#x27;re probably better off <br>
using the typical approach of centers first, pair edges, solve like <br>
3x3x3, and fix parity (as needed).<br>
<br>
Another approach I&#x27;ve played with (though more for fun than as a <br>
serious endeavor to find a good solution), is to build a 2x2x2, <br>
extend it to a 2x2x3, then a 2x3x3, then a 3x3x3, then a 3x3x4, etc.  <br>
It&#x27;s just a bit of a mind exercise.<br>

          <div class="email-content">HI Jake,

   Oh that explanation threw me once, too! The &quot;you can&#x27;t swap just
two corners,&quot; and the &quot;you can&#x27;t swap just two edges&quot; rules only need
to be accounted for once.

   The reason is that although you can&#x27;t do either one alone you can
do them together: you can swap two corners and two edges at the same
time. Those two rules are really only one limitation.

   If you were to take the cube apart and physically switch two
corners, put the cube back together, then solve the two corners you
could solve everything else but for two edges. So in that altered
state you can have either two edges out or two corners out, so that
means &quot;two edges out&quot; and &quot;two corners out&quot; are the same thing.
Therefore you only need to account for the &quot;two&quot; limitations once. 

   Also there is a little-known tie-in with the centers.

   In a normal cube you can swap two pairs of centers, but not one
pair, and you can&#x27;t take four centers and move them one side over and
solve the rest of the cube. The second part is the same thing as the
corner/edge swap discussed above.

  Again, take the cube apart and switch two corners, then solve the
two corners.  You now have two edges out. Put those two edges in place
by swapping two second level edges. Leaving the top and bottom centers
alone, move the remaining four centers one side to the right or left,
then you can solve the second layer edges. Instead of having two
corners or two edges out of place you end up with all the corners and
edges correctly placed in relation to one another, but only the top
and bottom centers are in place.

   Good question.

          <div class="email-content">Well, with an avrg of 48, I can&#x27;t really compare either, but here&#x27;s what I found helps:<br>
 <br>
1. Get a half decent cube-You can have a great solving method that only takes 60 turns, but if you plan on breaking 60 seconds, you&#x27;ve got to be able to turn more than 1 turn a second.<br>
2. Don&#x27;t go full speed- If you&#x27;re twisting the cube like mad trying to put in one piece, the cube will &quot;lock up&quot; and you won&#x27;t be able to turn at all and you won&#x27;t be able to see ahead as to what you&#x27;re doing<br>
3. Don&#x27;t just learn the algorithms, but learn how they work too- that way, if you get lost you can pick back up on what you&#x27;re doing and you can optimize the algs to you&#x27;re personal preferences.<br>
4. Learn ALL the algs you can- For the longest time I only knew about 5 algs. (up to 6 or 7 looks on the LL) durring that time I had a best time of about a minute. Now I know about 15 LL algs (3-4 look LL) and my best time has dropped over 20 seconds.<br>
5.  Practice, practice, practice...can&#x27;t get too much practice the more practice you get the faster you go...no way around it.<br>
 <br>
Hope this helps<br>

          <div class="email-content">honestly i wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.  if it were me, then if i didn&#x27;t 
know the algs to finish then i&#x27;d just start a new mix.  not big deal.

but to answer your question, you can visit Jessica&#x27;s page at 
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html and you can 
look at the &quot;A&quot; corner permutation and the &quot;E&quot; corner permutation.  

but unfortunately that&#x27;s not quite enough... since you are permuting 
corners before permuting edges, you have to realize that you may 
need to swap only 2 corners, but there is no way to do this without 
also permuting 2 edges.  so you need to learn 2 other cases 
besides &quot;A&quot; and &quot;E&quot;:  one case for swapping 2 diagonal corners and 
one case for swapping 2 adjacent corners.  i would choose &quot;J&quot; for 2 
adjacent corners and &quot;Y&quot; for 2 diagonal corners.  note that &quot;J&quot; 
and &quot;Y&quot; also swap 2 edges.  this is no big deal because you will 
permute edges in your last step, and so you can ignore this &quot;side 
effect&quot; for now.

of course you need to learn the inverse of &quot;A&quot; too unless you don&#x27;t 
mind doing it twice when needed.  that&#x27;s alot of algs (A, A&#x27;, E, J, 
and Y) just to permute corners, but these are all algs you&#x27;ll need 
to learn anyways to eventually permute everything at once.

switching systems is a pain.  good luck!

Try doing the second pair adjacent instead of opposite.
Here&#x27;s an example.
http://www.oinkleburger.com/Cube/Net/turnlists/show.cgi?
file=ef097a3849742b62d3c48bb0b00a3aa9

All the centres were done at 232 moves and I had to flip parts of 
the single edge too (edges joined at 437 moves) - nothing in this 
particular example is skipped. Centres are most important in terms 
of overall time but the edges are probably where you can slip the 
best moves in.

Better to think of it as (12!*8!)/2 * 2^11 * 3^7.

8.3, are you sure? There are only 3 cases, 2 algs needed:
- Already OK (1/6) {0 moves}
- Swap 2 corners == 3-cycle (2/3) {9 moves} [F&#x27;LF&#x27;R2FL&#x27;F&#x27;R2F2]
- Swap 2 corners, diagonal (1/6) {13 moves} [L&#x27;U&#x27;LF2R&#x27;DRUR2D&#x27;R2U&#x27;F2
for example]
+ Adjust U if needed (3/4) {1 move}

1/6*0 + 2/3*9 + 1/6*13 + 3/4*1 > 8.9

  Hi,<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ve been trying to solve a bigger cube than the 5x5x5, namely the<br>
  7x7x7 because of fewer parity problems than the 6x6x6 and the fact<br>
  that I find oinkleburger cubes difficult enough to visualise, without<br>
  having to work out where the centers should go...<br>
<br>
  I solved the first pair of opposite centers in about 10minutes - then<br>
  the second pair. I get stuck on the third... I can&#x27;t work out what a<br>
  good system should look like... do I do it in rows, or start from the<br>
  middle going out? Any hints would be greatly appreciated...<br>

          <div class="email-content">The formula for the compleet cube
is 

12! x 2^12 * 8!x 3^8

For the edges you have to divide by 2, it is not possible to have one 
edge fliped this is the 12! x 2^11 part

For the corners you have to divide by 3, it is not possible to have 
one corner fliped this is the part 8!x 3^7 part

Then there is a symetry between the edges and corners that is there 
is no odd permutation, if two corners are swaped, then there will be 
two at least edges swaped this is the /2part

Together this means this is you assemble the cube at random
you will have 2 x 3 x 2 = 12 possible outcomes, so at random only 1 
out of 12 you can solve

Just try! you will see the 12 factor

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m going to be the pessimist for a minute... Unfortunately, not <br>
everyone is likely to (or even can for that matter) achieve such fast <br>
times with a 3 look LL (or even at all).  I don&#x27;t mean to be a spoil-<br>
sport, but I feel that some people just don&#x27;t have the ability to get <br>
that fast, whether it is because of a lack of dexterity, memory, or <br>
time to devote to practice and learning.  Granted, some of these can <br>
be overcome by practice, but practice and devotion only go so far.<br>
<br>
With a 3 look LL, try as I might, I was unable to bring my average <br>
consistently below the 30 second barrier.  I was consistently in the <br>
range of 31-33 seconds.  I have resigned myself to the fact (okay, <br>
opinion, I know), that I will not likely ever average much better <br>
than 25 seconds.  Of course, a few years ago, I was convinced that <br>
the same was true about the 90 second barrier, so I realize that this <br>
may not actually be a true limit for me either.<br>
<br>
That said, don&#x27;t give up hope!  I found (back when I had a solid 3 <br>
look LL) that I needed as much as a second for recognition and 3-4 <br>
seconds for execution of each LL alg (4 is probably a little high, <br>
but maybe 3.5).  That means that with a 3 look LL, I would take <br>
between 12 and 15 seconds for the LL.  I haven&#x27;t actually timed the <br>
different parts of a solve lately, but when I was averaging just over <br>
30, using a 3 look LL, that was pretty much where I was; 12-14 <br>
seconds on the LL was pretty normal.  So if each look was taking me 4-<br>
4.5 seconds, it would stand to reason that learning a 2 look LL would <br>
cut 4-4.5 seconds from my time.  Now, I&#x27;m less than 10 cases away <br>
from a 2 look LL, and my most recent average was 27.81.  There may <br>
only be 1-1.5 seconds difference between 2-look and 3-look for <br>
someone who solves in under 20 seconds, but the benefits can be much <br>
greater for someone who takes 30 seconds or more.<br>
<br>
So, can you achieve fast times with a 3-look LL?  Maybe... It all <br>
depends on the person.  Is it worth it to learn all the algs involved <br>
in a 2-look LL?  Again, it all depends on the person.  If doing so <br>
could shave off 5-10% of your time, and you have the time, desire, <br>
and ability to do so, then I&#x27;d say go for it.  If, however, you have <br>
a 3-look LL that takes less than 15 seconds, and you&#x27;re still not <br>
averaging under 40, it&#x27;s probably time to work on the F2L instead.<br>
<br>
Just hang in there... Back when I had a 4-look LL, I didn&#x27;t think I <br>
wanted to spend the time on learning a 2-look LL, either, but now I&#x27;m <br>
almost there, and I&#x27;m thinking about what to work on next!<br>

I crack my knuckles all the time.  I don&#x27;t know why I
started but I know now I can&#x27;t stop.  Not only does it
feel good, it hurts after a while if I don&#x27;t.  If it

          <div class="email-content">I haven&#x27;t been able to read every post in regards to
3-look speeds, so forgive me if I go over something
that&#x27;s already been covered.  If you want to be a fast
cuber, and you are using the fridrichs method, I think
it depends what level you are at.  For example:
If you are using a 4-look and F2L and your times are
averaging over 50 seconds, your LL isn&#x27;t the problem. 
I&#x27;ve not mastered the cube, but I think the F2L is the
most important thing to improve on.  Not only that, it
seems that a lot of people have much room for
improvement in this area too.  I&#x27;ve been able to
achieve 26-27 second averages semi-consistently with a

Does anyone else think it&#x27;s funny (in a cute way) that so many 
newspaper articles use quote marks around words and phrases that are 
part of our everyday language, but obviously are a little strange to 
others? Some examples I can think of 
are &quot;cubers&quot;, &quot;speedcubers&quot;, &quot;lubing the cube&quot; and &quot;finger tricks&quot;. 
It&#x27;s not until I read these things (or hear someone laugh when I talk 
about lubing the cube) that I am reminded that not everyone has these 
terms as part of their everyday vocabulary!

          <div class="email-content">I think you&#x27;re probably right, Grant, when you say that not everyone 
will be able to achieve superfast times with a 3-look LL. 
Superspeedcubers like DanK and LarsV (and others) obviously can, but 
these guys were 1st and 4th at RWC -- so we know that they are both 
*really good cubers*!

There were quite a few replies to my original question (thanks guys!) 
and it was good to learn that the top cubers in the world can indeed 
get sub-20s times with a 3-look LL. It was also nice to know that 
some people average 30s+ with this method. I guess I was really after 
a range of times that different people get with a 3-look LL so the 
replies have been very helpful.

I think I&#x27;ve still got a fair way to go. I&#x27;m not too concerned at the 
moment though because I know that algs usually take a while to firmly 
implant themselves in my head. And I know that I can never perform 
algs at full speed until they move from my short-term memory into my 
subconscious memory. None of the new LL algs I&#x27;ve learnt in the last 
month are in my subconscious memory yet. I&#x27;ve practised them enough 
that I don&#x27;t really have trouble remembering them, but they aren&#x27;t 
yet second nature, I still need to think about them while I&#x27;m 
executing them.

          <div class="email-content">Haha the cube lingo is definately a funny one.  Me and my friend got talking 
one day in a crowded place and some of our non cubing friends try and follow 
our conversations.  One got so confused that he/she said that we made up all 
these words and phrases to make ourselves look smart hehehe.  
I like to think of cubing as a second language.  The notation especially.  Some 
people look at it and say &quot;I think you need to take a spelling class again&quot;  and 
others are like &quot;oh yeah that is the same 3 edgee permutation that i use!&quot;   
Very funny :)

There&#x27;s a different approach you may consider: edges orientation
before the end of F2L (&quot;Petrich&quot;).
- 2x2x3
- 7 edges orientation (about 5 moves)
- 2x3x3 using only 2 sides (very fast)
- LL corners orientation (6 easy algs)
- LL permutation (13 algs)
With this method, I&#x27;ve been sub-20 and my dexterity is not very good,
I think sub-18 is possible.
And you still can switch to standard F2L+OLL+PLL later.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">This is useful feedback Richard. Thanks. I know that my F2L 
definitely needs improvement. On Jessica&#x27;s site there&#x27;s a table which 
says that an average F2L is 35 moves (7 + 4x7), which is about what 
I&#x27;m averaging so I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;ve got the algs roughly right (I 
worked out F2L by myself). However, in the same table it says it&#x27;s 
possible to solve F2L in 10 seconds (2 + 4x2) -- this is the part I&#x27;m 
having trouble with, it&#x27;s taking me much longer than 10s!

With LL, my recognition and execution times were better than with my 
F2L, but since I was using a 4-look (sometimes 5-look) LL, I was just 
using too many moves to solve.

So, I&#x27;m thinking that for now I&#x27;ll focus on practising looking ahead 
during F2L to eliminate time wasted finding the next F2L pair, and 
improve LL by using a 3-look LL instead of 4 or 5-look LL.

          <div class="email-content">I read a long thread about knuckle cracking on the forum on Kam&#x27;s 
website, the guy that does the crazy pen spinning on 
superhandz.com.  Their consensus was that if you crack your knuckles 
it&#x27;s probably not that bad, but if you crack them a lot, expecially 
before performing something that takes dexterity (i.e. spinning a 
pen/doing the cube/ etc.) that you may feel slower and clumbsier if 
you do that thing without cracking your knuckles before hand.  I 
think opinions will always vary about this.  I used to crack my 
knuckles incessantly in elementary school but I stopped before 
middle school and haven&#x27;t done it since.  I don&#x27;t really know if 
it&#x27;s bad or not but the thread on Kam&#x27;s page was interesting to read.

The best advice for the F2L is to slow down until you can do it with 
now delays.  Practice at that speed for a while and then slowly 
build speed without introducing delays.  I find that the F2L goes 
much faster and smoother for me while &quot;going slowly&quot; than if I try 
to go really fast.

me that something better could be built.  i work with design/build <br>
shops who fabricate embedded electronic systems every day, so i was <br>
contemplating building a prototype.<br>
<br>
the issues with the wc timers that i saw were the following: timing <br>
shouldn&#x27;t start when you move your hands before you even pick up the <br>
cube.  you shouldn&#x27;t be required to &quot;drop&quot; the cube for the timing <br>
to end.<br>
<br>
how did the timing devices work at the 1982 championships?<br>
<br>
what physical movement do you think should start and end official <br>
rubik&#x27;s cube solving times?<br>
<br>
i think most would agree that videotaping yourself and counting the <br>
frames between the first twist and the last twist is not a good <br>
representation of your solving time.<br>
<br>
i would also argue that moving your hands off a pair of yellow dots <br>
should not be when timing begins.<br>
<br>
should the presence of the cube on the timing device start/stop the <br>
timing?  it seems to me this is the most logical.  if you go this <br>
route, there are numerous design: 1. mechanical switch measuring the <br>
weight of the cube on a platform, 2. photo diode measuring the <br>
ambient light above the sensor, 3. capacitive proximity sensor, 4. <br>
convergent reflective photoelectric sensor.<br>
<br>

<br>
I basically agree with you. In the Canadian &amp; U.S. contests from 1982 <br>
Ideal Toy used pads with a photo-sensor. Also the WC1982 <br>
had a similar type of device... You pick the <br>
cube up the timer starts, and stops when you put the cube<br>
down.<br>
<br>
At WC2003 some cubists would actually drop the cube <br>
on the floor in an effort to slap their hands down as fast<br>
as possible.<br>
<br>
Even so I&#x27;d say the timers were at least serviceable...<br>
I&#x27;m sure the times were _slightly_ slower with this style<br>
of timer. It&#x27;s a compromise between the big money days<br>
with Ideal paying $$$ for custom timers versus the <br>
current situation with much smaller volumes of cubes<br>
being sold.<br>
<br>
Perhaps there&#x27;s a cheap way to build a better timer.<br>

          <div class="email-content">great.  thanks for the info.

do you have any idea what the pads in 1982 were made of?  was it a 
soft &quot;mouse-pad&quot; with a little hole in it for the photo sensor?  or 
was it a hard plastic platform with a hole in it?

do you think the pad where the cube is placed before/after solving 
should be made of something soft or hard?

          <div class="email-content">I think the best official cube timer would be about the size of a 
mousepad, and you simply pick the cube up to start and put it down to 
stop. A pressure pad or photo sensor would work perfectly.

          <div class="email-content">I was recently contacted by a local newspaper about doing an <br>
interview or Q&amp;A as they call it. So I asked where they heard of me <br>
from and he said he read an article about me in a magazine. So I was <br>
like, WHAT!, when did I ever give such permission? Well I dropped by <br>
a store this morning and picked up an issue of this Asian Pop <br>
Culture magazine based in CA (&quot;GiantRobot&quot; magagzine). It features <br>
an article about 4 cubists Minh Thai, Dan Knights, Jessica Fridrich, <br>
an me (there was quick mention of Wesley also). It was even the <br>
first bullet on the front cover (&quot;Masters of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;)!<br>
<br>
This place e-mailed me one or twice like 4 months ago so I thought <br>
they forgot about it. But to my suprise they ran with it, and some <br>
stuff that I thought was just between me and this guy was in the <br>
article, some of which is exaggerated, some was not how I wanted it <br>
to sound, but whatever. I thought it was a sort of pre-interview <br>
thing for him to draw questions from not that actual interview.<br>
<br>
I decided to take some scans of it and post it for you guys, I <br>
wanted very high resolution (but well compressed) but didn&#x27;t want to <br>
use up our precious file storage space on this fourm... so I <br>
uploaded it to my site. This is also so that the other people like <br>
DanK, JF, and people can keep track of where they have been <br>
mentioned in the media.<br>
<br>
You&#x27;ll find it here at the following precise URL, 4 and 1/2 pages <br>
(the first a Characature of MT, 2.5 of MT and one page on 3 <br>
contemporary cubists), all of suitable quality resolution. BTW they <br>
decided to use me probably because I &#x27;am&#x27; Asian, even though there <br>
are tons of cubers faster then me out there, ops I mean *here*.<br>
<br>
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/GiantRobot/<br>
It&#x27;s just a directory, I didn&#x27;t bother to caption it and stuff <br>
properly. Be sure to get both parts of the link if it splits, since <br>
I havn&#x27;t linked it off my main site (that is painfully under <br>
updated). It&#x27;s a new issue of a magazine so I hope I don&#x27;t get into <br>
trouble by doing this...., lol.<br>

store.... I just head straight for the automotive department. Look 
for the word synthetic and don&#x27;t touch those that read petroleum or 
petroleum-based. I have good sucess at my local K-Marts btw.

Multi-Purpose/General-Purpose is also a good indicator. Hope this 
helps; I wouldn&#x27;t order lube from online if I were you, the shipping 
itself would make it too expensive.

          <div class="email-content">Great site!  I myself have a 112 second average, but today i got a 
97.02 and 106.93, (88 sec personal best) But I use the method thats 
in the book that comes with the cube. - Long way.

I already ordered the 100% silicone spray online and will use it on 
my new 1980 ideal cube. (still stiff)

I want to get into speedcubing but don&#x27;t know where to start. I&#x27;ll 
look at your page more after my exam tomorrow.

          <div class="email-content">Hi evreybody!<br>
I have some kind of a big problem with my cube... I think everybody has already had this problem before, but I haven&#x27;t stop practicing more for more than one month. The cube I use is a very good one (but I don&#x27;t know which type of cube it is), but the colors start to whiten... Can anybody tell me what I can do on my next cube, that I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one every 5 weeks?<br>
An other thing I want to say, is that I live in France, and that most of you guys live in America, in the Netherlands or in some place of Eastern Europe. And I must tell, almost nobody here can do the cube... For example, in my school, I&#x27;m the only one who can even solve it, and I don&#x27;t speak of speedsolving. Ok, that&#x27;s quite impressive for the others to look at me solving it, but I just want to say I find it quite stupid cube hasn&#x27;t become a national &#x27;sport&#x27; here like it seems to be elsewhere... I don&#x27;t even know any French cubist in my area, and I live near Paris... But this isn&#x27;t really interesting, the interesting part of this post was the first one, and I would be glad if anybody could give me some tips...<br>
Thanks,<br>

          <div class="email-content">First of all, I don&#x27;t think the Cube has become a national sport 
anywhere. (Well except maybe Hungary in some point in history for 
economic reasons.) Secondly, there are PLENTY of French cubers, some 
of our fastest are French. Heck, there was even a national 
championship in France over the summer. There is a French version of 
this cube fourm also... (not sure what the name of it is precisely).

I hope that helps.

Oh come on&#x27;, be nice. Or at least quote the lines that bother you so 
that we may judge for ourselves. I havn&#x27;t actually read it all in 
its entirety, but judging from the e-mail interview on the wc site, 
he&#x27;s just trying to give a consevative look at it all and how the 
pressure of competition does indeed cause significantly slower times 
in many cases. I didn&#x27;t notice anything remotely offensive that he 
said in the article (and I pick up on these things, lol). At some 
point he does say that he doesn&#x27;t believe that the cube can be done 
in 20s average in compititon. But that&#x27;s perfectly OK, A) it&#x27;s his 
opionion (he used the word &quot;believe&quot;) and B) it hasn&#x27;t been shown in 
compeitition yet (DanK didn&#x27;t average &lt;20s he did 20.00s ignoring 
the statisical triming), C) this article was written before the WC 
and the article doesn&#x27;t even mention it so MT can freely make such 
statements. The records list we are all used to is called UNOFFICIAL 
for good reasons. But, yes, yes, I am aware that MT should be aware 
of other cubists like JeffV and Pergl among his contemporaries who 
were also amazingly fast that may disprove his claims.

I think it is better this way actually - that people don&#x27;t go up to 
the media and be all like &quot;it&#x27;s possible to average 15s in 
compition&quot; or 10s or 9s.... This makes people respect it more 
perhaps, like it &#x27;does&#x27; take TONS of hardwork even to get to 30s. Ok 
perhaps more respect for the Cube itself then the cubist.

I just see nothing wrong with it all, and I&#x27;m a bit shocked at how 
people could even get offended by it. Of course if &#x27;you&#x27; *can* 
average under 20s (I guess that means a lot of you people here...), 
then that would be more fair that &#x27;they&#x27; be somewhat annoyed. But 
last time I checked you don&#x27;t average under 20..., so I don&#x27;t see 
where your problem is? Is it that he may be out of touch with the 
cubing community now...., according to that article he has a life 
now not revolving around the cube. Many of the faster cubers at wc 
are not active in any online cube community (f.i. Gene) do we 
respect them any less for it?

          <div class="email-content">i don&#x27;t care for the SNAP silicone.  i also tried prestone silicone 
and that&#x27;s not the greatest either (although both are much better 
than nothing).  the problem i had with these is that the propellant 
takes too long to evaporate and your cube is stiff for hours after 
lubricating.

the best i found was from a company called &quot;Castle&quot; and it is 100% 
pure silicone lubricant.  the Castle silicone uses a propellant that 
evaporates almost instantly.  you can literally spray it in the edge-
peice hole, blow in the hole for about a minute, and start cubing.  
with SNAP brand, my cube is usually stiff for hours while the 
propellant evaporates.

i was able to buy the Castle silicon at aubochon&#x27;s hardware store.  
i&#x27;m sure everyone here has their favorite brand of silicone, so this 
is only a suggestion.

  Oh come on&#x27;, be nice. Or at least quote the lines that bother you so 
  that we may judge for ourselves. I havn&#x27;t actually read it all in 
  its entirety, but judging from the e-mail interview on the wc site, 
  he&#x27;s just trying to give a consevative look at it all and how the 
  pressure of competition does indeed cause significantly slower times 
  in many cases. I didn&#x27;t notice anything remotely offensive that he 
  said in the article (and I pick up on these things, lol). At some 
  point he does say that he doesn&#x27;t believe that the cube can be done 
  in 20s average in compititon. But that&#x27;s perfectly OK, A) it&#x27;s his 
  opionion (he used the word &quot;believe&quot;) and B) it hasn&#x27;t been shown in 
  compeitition yet (DanK didn&#x27;t average &lt;20s he did 20.00s ignoring 
  the statisical triming), C) this article was written before the WC 
  Yes, but I´m sure Thai had in mind &lt;20s in one trial, (as in the WC82
  he became champion in that way). So in that sense he &quot;believed&quot; wrong.

  R

   the article doesn&#x27;t even mention it so MT can freely make such 
  statements. The records list we are all used to is called UNOFFICIAL 
  for good reasons. But, yes, yes, I am aware that MT should be aware 
  of other cubists like JeffV and Pergl among his contemporaries who 
  were also amazingly fast that may disprove his claims.

  I think it is better this way actually - that people don&#x27;t go up to 
  the media and be all like &quot;it&#x27;s possible to average 15s in 
  compition&quot; or 10s or 9s.... This makes people respect it more 
  perhaps, like it &#x27;does&#x27; take TONS of hardwork even to get to 30s. Ok 
  perhaps more respect for the Cube itself then the cubist.

  I just see nothing wrong with it all, and I&#x27;m a bit shocked at how 
  people could even get offended by it. Of course if &#x27;you&#x27; *can* 
  average under 20s (I guess that means a lot of you people here...), 
  then that would be more fair that &#x27;they&#x27; be somewhat annoyed. But 
  last time I checked you don&#x27;t average under 20..., so I don&#x27;t see 
  where your problem is? Is it that he may be out of touch with the 
  cubing community now...., according to that article he has a life 
  now not revolving around the cube. Many of the faster cubers at wc 
  are not active in any online cube community (f.i. Gene) do we 
  respect them any less for it?

You just need to make some new stickers... Don&#x27;t worry, this is a very
common problem - expect to have to do *something* to your cube at
least once a week. (découpe du scotch de couleur sur du papier

it, and I don&#x27;t speak of speedsolving. Ok, that&#x27;s quite impressive for

<br>
Just wanted to thank whoever gave me the advice on the 7x7x7 cube -<br>
working with adjacent sides helped - especially when I discovered an<br>
alg with the general property of exchanging any two &quot;center&quot; pieces<br>
(ie any two pieces which belong to two adjacent inner n-2xn-2 center<br>
pieces).<br>
<br>
I was also wondering whether anyone felt like giving me some<br>
competition in the 3x3x2 and 3x2x2 categories...<br>
<br>
You guessed it: my 3x3x3 has reached a plateau and I&#x27;m trying out new<br>
things - strangely, I had a 4 day break and, contrary to many, my<br>
average shot up from 27s to 29s - I&#x27;m back down under 27 again after<br>
two good hour sessions - trouble is, just solving the cube isn&#x27;t good<br>
enough training any more! I&#x27;m on 8s for cross + first pair. If can hit<br>
5s by going a bit slower and finding the  pair quicker, I&#x27;ll be below<br>
25s cool!<br>
<br>
Has anyone who&#x27;s been practicing looking for the next pair while<br>
placing the current pair ever managed to &quot;find&quot; the pair he was<br>
currently placing - and get thouroughly confused, like me?!<br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s not just the brand of silicone that can make a difference. I&#x27;ve 
found that the same brand of silicone applied to different brands of 
cubes will have different results. Silicone always helps, but it 
doesn&#x27;t help as much on some cubes.

I personally prefer to have a very loose/smooth cube, otherwise it 
bothers my wrists. I didn&#x27;t find anyone else with a cube quite like 
mine in Toronto. In fact, several people (including LarsV :) teased 
me about how loose my cube was!  :)

          <div class="email-content">I would say about half the total time should be devoted to F2L half 
to LL, assuming a system with disjoint F2L and LL steps.

I found this to be a good rule of thumb... For three look it should 
be almost the same. This rule starts to break down at sub-20 when 
sometimes it is more like 12s F2L and 8s LL.

          <div class="email-content">Ok,<br>
<br>
This is what I was able to discern from watching the<br>
WC1982 video on Ron van Bruchem&#x27;s site, and also<br>
re-watching the Canadian Championships of 1982:<br>
<br>
There was a white podium with a raised black square<br>
on the top. Cubists had 15 seconds inspection time,<br>
same as in WC2003. A judge, Mr. Sanderson, would<br>
cover the cube with his hand and when he removed<br>
is hand the cubist would pick up the cube and the <br>
timer would start. This was similar to WC2003 but not<br>
exactly the same. <br>
<br>
At the Canadian Championships I found something <br>
very similar, except the timer pad was thicker and <br>
looked like it was made from metal, with the top of<br>
the pad being black. In those days I can&#x27;t recall<br>
anyone using mouse pads, and definitely mouse <br>
pads were not used for the pad timers in 1982.<br>
At the Canadian Championships the judge did not<br>
cover the cube with his hand, the cubist would<br>
simply pick the cube up from the table.<br>
<br>
There was a long red dot matrix display which was connected<br>
to the timer pad by a cable. This was different than<br>
WC2003 since a 7-segment display was used. Actually<br>
I think the 7-segment display is much easier to see,<br>
and easier to film.<br>
<br>
My understanding is that Ideal Toy had the pads <br>
build custom for the North American cube contests,<br>
both for the U.S. and Canada. Of course Ideal Toy<br>
is long gone now, so I am not 100% sure if the<br>
pad had a photo sensor or was pressure sensitive,<br>
but I think there was a small hole in the pad. <br>
<br>
To answer your question about the pad, I think the pad<br>
should be something relatively hard. My recollection <br>
is that the timer pads used in the U.S. and Canada<br>
had a black plastic top. In the Canadian video I could see<br>
that the pad was enclosed by metal, possibly aluminium.<br>
<br>
If someone has a video of the &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible&quot; episodes<br>
from 1981 and 1982 they could possibly confirm if the<br>
timer pads were the same ones which were used in <br>
Canada.<br>

          <div class="email-content">No, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. There are 12 F2L pieces and 8 LL 
pieces... The 12 to 8 ratio (3:2) I gave accidently agrees with this 
more then what yuo said (2:1). I think, however, that it is more 
practical to go with a half-half rule until sub-25, say.

especially if what Doug said is true. Does anyone know the ratio of 
the average number of moves in the F2L and LL? That wouldn&#x27;t be an

Good question. The best I can offer is 35 in F2L vs. 21 in LL 
according to Jessica&#x27;s website.

I find most of the time I use less then 21 in the LL with my CLL/ELL 
approach, except for about 30% of the time I&#x27;m using almost double 
that number. I suppose it averages out. I don&#x27;t think the 35 
estimate is good for the F2L. I am on average able to solve and F2L 
in 2-3 turms less then that using the Fridrich system by choosing 
the order of which edge to place first, second, third, ... and by 
using slant pairing if necessary. And even less using my own system 
when comparing in Slice Count Metric. This is not to say that my 
method is better, my method requires way too much recognition.

Hi All, 

Let me inform that Kyoko Watanabe, who ranks at 4th for 3x3 with feet 
and has 49 sec in average for regular solving (not posted to UWR), 
will appear on internet broadcasting with her friends. You are very 
welcome to join. Please see and leave messages on the board. Thanks. 

You can see her solving video here. 
http://casty.jp/hikarisou/index_guest.php?owner_id=4142

She will be on somewhere in main page on Octber 13th 15:00-22:00 
(GMT+9:00). 
(Oct 13th 2:00-9:00 EST)
Main page is here
http://casty.jp/hikarisou/index_madori.php

In the current video, she says...
&quot;Hello,&quot;
&quot;I am a speedcubist Kyoko Watanabe.&quot; 
&quot;I am going to solve this. &quot;
.....Solving rubik&#x27;s cube.(approx. 58 sec)....
&quot;I will practice to be able to solve much faster.&quot;
&quot;Thanks&quot;

Acutually, this event is her 2nd appearance on the net, but I missed 
the 1st one. So I don&#x27;t know the detail but I believe it must be like 
Jess&#x27;s marathon live streaming video with two way communication via 
message board. 

It may be difficult for you to leave message on that site because you 
need to register yourself in Japanese. So if you could leave messages 
on this board, we can tranfser them to her. Sorry for inconvenience. 
Happy cubing.

Hi Raul, 

Thanks for your visiting to the web site. 
Sorry, I don&#x27;t know why you can&#x27;t. 

It is still open another a few more hours.

Right now your best bet is probably Rubiks.com  

Ton sells really good cubes called &quot;studio&quot; cubes at his site 
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/buy1.htm but he is out of stock right 
now and it might be awhile until he has cubes to sell again.

My best cube for now: A standard Rubik&#x27;s one. Still perfect after far
more than 10000 solvings.
$9 at my local toy store.
But all cubes are not born equal. Maybe you&#x27;ll need to open a few
boxes to find one well balanced (same spring tension everywhere).

Does this mean that new official rubik&#x27;s cubes sold at stores such as target now have PVC stickers instead of the silly paper stickers they pawned off on us for the past couple years?

@Heath: <br>
i know about ton&#x27;s cubes, but as you said they&#x27;re out of stock. and <br>
also buying from rubiks.com isn&#x27;t that a good idea, because the <br>
shipping cost is immense.<br>
<br>
@Michael Atkinson:<br>
but if the stickers are that bad, where can i get new one, let me <br>
guess on rubiks.com? Or is perhaps someone out there who can sell me <br>
some stickers?<br>
<br>
@Gilles:<br>
but i thought, that the new cubes have no springs anymore? or was it <br>
that they have no screws anymore? But if there are no screws how can <br>
i prepare the cube for speedcubing? I loosed the screws on my old one <br>
a bit, so it was a really good cube till it broke.<br>

          <div class="email-content">i think everyone varies on this.  i like the small amount of 
resistance that is caused by room-temperature silicone lubricant.  
some probably like a very slippery cube.

one of my cubes is made of really hard plastic and after you lube 
it, the thing is so slippery it flops all over the place when you&#x27;re 
trying to hold it-- i can hardly use it for speed-cubing.  it&#x27;s not 
worn out (i.e. the corners don&#x27;t rattle), just slippery.  although 
it&#x27;s great for demonstrating to someone how slippery a cube can be 
made.

          <div class="email-content">yes.  but...  there&#x27;s no telling how long it will take the existing 
inventory of cubes with paper stickers to be used up.  so 
eventually, you will find that new cubes use the pvc stickers.  i 
would guess that hasn&#x27;t happened yet because the stickers were just 
redesigned this year.

if you buy stickers-only from rubiks.com, they will definitely be 
the pvc ones, because they used up the last of the remaining paper 
stickers stock at the 2003 championships.  (the people who 
restickered first at the championships got paper stickers, and 
people who waited until later to resticker found the newer pvc 
stickers).

i&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s pretty hard to tell the difference between the 
paper and pvc stickers without touching them.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
For the last three months, I&#x27;ve been trying a significantly different<br>
method (http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html).<br>
<br>
Speeding up was very difficult in the beginning, most of my times<br>
lying in the 40s-50s range. But I was happy, because it&#x27;s good to be a<br>
beginner! :-)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m getting faster now, with a best average of 22.8s, and a best time<br>
of 15s (not &quot;lucky&quot;, but it&#x27;s an outlier, statistically speaking).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve still got a lot to learn (corner algs and others), but it looks<br>
good, so... next milestone for the next three months: 20s (before I<br>
decide to switch to another method, again :-) )<br>
<br>
Happy cubing,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I just wanted to let you all know of something very exciting for everyone. <br>
Disney World is opening a new resort on December 14th, 2003 (Sunday) <br>
called Pop Century. It has 2880 rooms (starting at only $77/night) and the <br>
buildings are each four stories tall. There are sections of this resort that are <br>
dedicated to different pop icons of the 20th century. So far, the 50&#x27;s through <br>
the 90&#x27;s are ready to be opend (they actually have been ready since <br>
February, but because of the economy, Disney is waiting until December to <br>
open it). The 1900&#x27;s thru 40&#x27;s will open eventually. Those buildings are all <br>
built but they need to be decorated. Each building of each decade has <br>
phrases on it (for example, the 50&#x27;s section says stuff like &quot;Be-Bop&quot; and <br>
&quot;Craaazy, Man&quot;) and also larger-than-life size objects. Click on the link to see <br>
what I mean.<br>
<br>
http://images.google.com/images?q=pop+century&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;hl=en<br>
<br>
You will see some large bowling pins. They are 65 ft. tall. There are 9 of them, <br>
and the tenth one is a bowling-pin shaped pool. Next to the pool, the ground <br>
looks like a bowling alley with the same type of wood texture and the arrows <br>
to aim the ball toward the pins. That&#x27;s creative, and the everything from the <br>
decades are somehow shown in each section of the resort.<br>
<br>
If you notice toward the bottom of the link, there is one picture with a 4-story <br>
tall Rubik&#x27;s Cube. What&#x27;s that doing there? That was one of the big icons of <br>
the 80&#x27;s, so Disney &quot;imagineers&quot; (the ones who thought of how to decorate <br>
this place and other resorts and theme parks) thought that they should put up <br>
six giant cubes in the 80&#x27;s section. The first one is totally random and the way <br>
it&#x27;s supposed to be is that as you walk around the building, the cubes <br>
progressively get closer to being solved, and eventually the last cube is <br>
solved. I didn&#x27;t get to check whether the positions of the cubes are possible or <br>
not, but the D faces on the cubes don&#x27;t even exist (they are replaced by stands <br>
to hold up the cubes), but anyway it&#x27;s a creative thing. The cube in that picture <br>
from Pop Century is the solved one and next to it is some kind of phone or <br>
walkie-talkie.<br>
<br>
Last week there was a major press event in Disney World, and they saw the <br>
article of me on rubikschamps.com, and thought they should invite me for this! <br>
I left last Tuesday, and left Saturday afternoon. So Friday morning on the 10th, <br>
I had to be awake at 3:40 a.m. to be at Pop Century by 5 for the morning news <br>
shows. For 7 hours I was busy cubing and answering questions about the <br>
cube. After four hours of sleep, little time to warm up, hands on the cold side, <br>
and some pressure, I was getting times around 16-21 seconds. Not bad. I was <br>
on some local channels in Orlando, Tampa, North Carolina, Wisconsin, <br>
Minnesota, and some other states (I don;t remember since I had too many <br>
interviews!) and one Spanish channel. Since I arrived early (at 4:30) I went all <br>
the way over to see the cubes. It&#x27;s a bit of a long walk (huge resort!) but it was <br>
fun.<br>
<br>
Also during the 3-day event two new attractions opened. At Magic Kingdom, a <br>
new 3D show called Philhar Magic started to play. At Epcot, a new ride called <br>
Mission Space opened. It was open a few days before the press event but on <br>
Thursday night there were some former astronauts from Apollo missions and <br>
NASA who dedicated the ride. For this, Epcot closed early that day to prepare <br>
it for the night. Only guests were allowed to go, and I was one of them. Later, <br>
Sugar Ray and the B-52&#x27;s played a concert but I was busy doing Test Track <br>
(great ride, you all have to do it! I actually have it on tape and might put it on <br>
my site!) The great thing about Mission Space though is that astronauts tried it <br>
out and it &quot;passed the authenticity test&quot; meaning the forces are realistic, just <br>
like astronauts have to go thru in training, but you only stay in one place! <br>
While experiencing some g-forces, a screen plays a movie like you&#x27;re <br>
travelling thru space, and I heard it&#x27;s incredibly realistic. If you&#x27;re prone to <br>
motion sickness, don&#x27;t do it!!! <br>
<br>
I think I&#x27;m talking a little too much now, but soon I will have the whole story <br>
posted on my site with pictures and a few video clips, but if you have any <br>
questions about Pop Century or the trip I went on then email me <br>

Hi Doug, 

Suppose: 
R0=R, Rx=the slice places x th from R. (R1 is the next of R)
U0=U, Uy=the slice places y th from U. (U1 is the next of U)

Rx Uy L U&#x27;y R&#x27;x Uy L&#x27; U&#x27;y [8 moves]

is 3 rotation of centers.[(D Rx Fy) (F Rx Uy) (F Ly Ux)]

You can not swap the two centers. 
But You can do 3-rotation with two same color centers and one another 
color center after placing appropriate position. 

Good luck

   Ideal cubes from the 1980&#x27;s have screws that can be adjusted. There
were a few hundred million of them made and there are lots of them
still around. There are about 10 on ebay right now. And some of them
have never been used.

   The main ones are the big yellow box sealed in celophane, the
carboard tube which is mainly from Britain, and the clear plastic
cylinder with the black base. Be careful with the last because some
pirate versions copied the clear cylinder.

   Also if you are tired of stickers get an Ideal Deluxe cube or the
Rubik&#x27;s Game cube which has plastic tiles. These can be expensive if
their unused, but they are usually still great if you can only get a
used one.

          <div class="email-content">As stated by previous answers only the old 1980 Rubik&#x27;s Cube and the 
new Rubik Studio cube have screws. The advantage of screw is that you 
can adjust the cube to your style of speedcubing. Also it will wear 
down evenly. But there are some adjustments possible for a 
Rubik&#x27;s.com cube see 

http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/makinga.htm

I personally do not use the rubik&#x27;s.com cube, and if we look at the 
top 10 op the WC2003, they did not use a rubik&#x27;s.com cube! Actually 4 
of the top 10 got there cube from me, I prepared two of them for the 
final. 

You will need a speedcube if you want to do finger tricks. If you are 
lucky a rubik&#x27;s.com can work fine, this depends if the tension is 
evenly. Most speedcubers try or just buy 10 cubes, to get a good cube.
But still the current stickers are very bad. 

Than again the stickers will be replaced in the near future with 
stronger ones, the first tests of the new developed stickers where 
very positive.

&gt; Anyone have a good method for solving the last two centers on large <br>
&gt; cubes (6x6x6 or larger)?  I guess I have just been getting lucky <br>
&gt; with the centers on smaller cubes.<br>
<br>
Well, since you asked...  I would bet it&#x27;s not so much that you&#x27;re <br>
getting lucky with the smaller cubes, but that it&#x27;s easier to piece <br>
together rows in the smaller cubes.  Using a row by row approach for <br>
the last two centers, working across from one side to the other, you <br>
can actually get everything that lies on one half, and everything <br>
that is on or outside the diagonals on the other half without using <br>
any algs.  So, on a 6x6x6, you can get these (hopefully this makes <br>
sense):<br>
XXXX<br>
XXX<br>
XXX<br>
XXXX<br>
without algs, leaving just two spaces at most to fill in with algs.  <br>
And actually, you can pre-fill at least one of the spaces, which is <br>
why a 5x5x5 requires no algs.<br>
<br>
I think you&#x27;ll find that it could really add a lot of moves to your <br>
solution if you used an algorithm the whole way through the last two <br>
centers, so, this is what I would recommend - concentrate on one of <br>
the two faces, building it up one row at a time. First, piece <br>
together the rows on one half (without algs, using unsolved rows as a <br>
workspace), finishing with the center row (for odd order cubes).  <br>
Then piece together the rows on the other half as much as possible.  <br>
By &quot;as much as possible&quot;, I mean that you can get anything that is no <br>
closer to the center than the row you are creating.  I think I&#x27;m <br>
making this more confusing than it has to be, but it&#x27;s hard to <br>
explain in words.  Anyway, when you&#x27;ve done as much as possible <br>
without algs, fill in the gaps with an alg, used repetetively.  The <br>
one I use (using the same notation as Masayuki, with the last two <br>
centers on F and R) has the effect of swapping 2 centers, (F Ux Ly) <br>
and (R Ux Fy), though it is actually a rotation of 3 as well.  It is:<br>
<br>
U&#x27;x R&#x27; Dy R Ux R&#x27; D&#x27;y<br>
<br>
This is only 7 moves, with only 4 being slices (though slice turn vs. <br>
face turn is hardly important on computer cubes).  You just have to <br>
make sure the U and D moves are not the same slice.  If they are <br>
(e.g. slice U1 and slice D4 are the same one for a 6x6x6), reverse <br>
the R turns, and it will make it a different D slice move (e.g. Use <br>
D1 instead of D4 or D2 instead of D3).  A nice feature of this alg, <br>
is that if you have multiple pieces in the Ux slice that are lined up <br>
and need to swap between R and F, you can just do multiple D slice <br>
moves (Dy, Dz, etc.), each one corresponding to a pair that gets <br>
swapped.  This isn&#x27;t particularly useful for the 6x6x6, since you can <br>
make sure you only have one gap to fill in, if you do it right.  <br>
However, when you start working with 7x7x7, 8x8x8, and up, this <br>
becomes increasingly useful.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That can happen sometimes. Different brands of silicon react 
differently with different types of plastic and can make a cube 
stiff especially if there is a lot of cube dust on the inside. This 
happened on my old cube and it actually ate away at the plastic. 
What brand did you use?

My cousin just loaned me a square-1 and want to lube it but don&#x27;t 
want to destroy it. Is it easy to take apart and put back togehter? 
If so, how does it come apart?

          <div class="email-content">The Rubiks&#x27;s Arxon is a orginal 1980 with the bright orange. The logo 
on the Rubik&#x27;s Studio cube can wear after a while. On the Arxon this 
does not happen.
Both have strong vinyl stickers that are very strong, srews in the 
center.

For speedcubing there is little difference, but is more a personal 
prefernce, it just feel a bit better.

> Also, how long of a life do the 2003 Studio Cubes have?

This depends you much you play.

It take me more than 6 months before I use a new cube. In three years 
I used 4 speedcubes, I never had to replace the stickers.

          <div class="email-content">Alright, first of all I&#x27;d like to suggest consulting speedcubing.com 
first. (I&#x27;m sure many here would agree with that.)

I do notice some oddness in what you have described though. If you 
consider the cross as a &#x27;no alg&#x27; step, then why are you considering 
the FL conrers to need 1-3 algs? Do you mean &#x27;up to 3 algs&#x27; or &#x27;one 
of 3 actual algs for each of the 3 corners&#x27;? In other words, did you 
mean # of algs that are needed to be memorized for the step in 
question or # of algs that need to be executed in that step? If it 
is the second then you should have 1 for the cross number. 

In general with a method with so many steps, it is typical to run 
into more lucky cases when that step is skipped. But proportionate 
to your overall time, it shouldn&#x27;t affect averages too much and can 
be counted as non-lucky. Assuming these are minor steps you have 
skipped and say a reasonable number of such skips (up to 3 for what 
you do, in my opinion).

So I do suggest reading the &quot;well-accepted&quot; (continually revised if 
necessary) definition of luckyness on speedcubing.com, which seems 
to agree with other site&#x27;s definitions to a good extent. If you are 
then unclear about anything feel free to type up a more descriptive 
question or solve that you find questionable. Come to think of it, I 
should ask around sometimes, to get more interesting conversations 
started but usually just sit down and do the 
mathematical/statistical computations (I am fairly strict about 
these things and not using lucky times in averages.)

An actually solve example would be great for this sort of thing... 
Not to mention shed some light on other people&#x27;s solving methods out 
there.

Wouldn&#x27;t it just be so simple if lucky times were just defined by 
something like times with greater then say 2.5 standar deviations 
away from one&#x27;s average? But NOooooo, we have to be careful about 
such things since it is possible to get a slower then averge but 
still lucky time (i.e. skipped tons of steps but lost a lot of time 
elsewhere) or something in the opposite direction.

the main difference between the various silicones is the 
propellant.  i&#x27;ve found that once the propellant dries, they&#x27;re all 
about the same.  however, some sprays have more silicone and others 
have more propellant, so with a brand that has lots of propellant, 
you have to spray a lot on to get much silicone.

propellants that take a long time to dry leave your cube stiff and 
sticky until the propellant dries.  so faster evaporating propellant 
is better.

i&#x27;ve used three brands of silicone and here is my opinions:
1.  prestone.  not bad, propellant dries relatively quickly and 
there&#x27;s enough silicone so you don&#x27;t have to soak it.
2.  snap.  my least favorite, the propellant takes forever to dry 
and there&#x27;s not much silicone so you have to saturate it to leave 
much silicone behind.
3.  castle.  my favorite, the propellant dries *instantly*, and 
there&#x27;s tons of silicone so a quick spray leaves your cube nice and 
greasy.

of course opinions vary, so your mileage may vary, as they say.

with so many steps in your solution, i would not consider skipping

          <div class="email-content">Ok, due to some interest/requests I&#x27;m going to write up a rough <br>
solution of the 1x1x2 Glidingcube here. If you have no idea what I&#x27;m <br>
talking about then go here: www.glidingcube.com and enjoy you <br>
limited trials, I know I did. Due to the high number of permutations <br>
and I think for the old version, the animations couldn&#x27;t be turned <br>
off so back then an estimate for your solving times would be <br>
whatever you get on a regular cube twice that size in every <br>
dimension say on Oinkleburger; perhaps now it is like 80% of that <br>
time due to no animations switched off.<br>
<br>
First off, I&#x27;d like to say that it is a lot more difficult than it <br>
sounds. After solving the 3x3x3 version about 5 months ago when it <br>
first came out, on the first try and then some 10x10x10s in  <br>
reasonable amount of time I decided to try a 1x1x2 version (after <br>
observing the redundancy of a 1x1x1, lol). Needless to say all of <br>
the 2 sticker swap algs shown on Ping&#x27;s site don&#x27;t work; neither did <br>
my own 2 sticker swap alg. On the other hand, some of you will be <br>
able to solve it no problem, but if you haven&#x27;t done so I think it&#x27;s <br>
a good exercise.<br>
<br>
I worked on the puzzle off&amp;on for about 2 months (dang), going at it <br>
pretty much randomly since I figured the number of permutations to <br>
be very low. So I stooped to figuring it out mathematically. I <br>
thought up most of this through &quot;cube-intuition&quot; then backed it up <br>
with some mathematical reasoning.<br>
<br>
So let&#x27;s get started... First off think of this cube differently <br>
then any other cube - think of it as two (length 6) belts that <br>
intersect at two points (I&#x27;ll call that the top and bottom). This is <br>
of course more of a 15-puzzle interpretation then a mechanical <br>
polyhedron one that we are all accustomed to :). Ok so STEP1, solve <br>
one of these belts, if you can&#x27;t do this then go back to doing the <br>
3x3x3 or higher GC to get the hang of things. Know your preset color <br>
scheme and solve for it (I&#x27;ll assume the U,D faces to contain the <br>
single sticker). Now at most 4 stickers need to permuted.<br>
<br>
MATH:<br>
Ok, forget about doing mechanical turns, none of them are required <br>
(due also by reasoning others have done, but the 1x1x2 might be a <br>
special case) and that any mechanical turn here is the same as a <br>
glide move. There are essentially 2 types of glides, a &quot;short glide&quot; <br>
and &quot;long glide,&quot; each of order 4 and 6 respectively. Since these <br>
are even numbers.... we&#x27;ll call the need to swap two sticker <br>
a &quot;parity problem,&quot; although this can be compensated by swapping two <br>
identical color stickers elsewhere (with in the last 4 stickers). <br>
The unfinished belt can be thought of a hexagon, actually two <br>
overlapping triangles, whose lines indicate swaps that can be made <br>
through a 180 short glide. Connecting opposites to see what can be <br>
swapped by a 180ish long glide. From here plan out what needs to be. <br>
Note that many approaches can be taken, but there will usually be a <br>
simple optimal path to doing this. Any time you swap two stickers <br>
through one of these lines you have to undo it to another two, <br>
typically on the other triangle.<br>
<br>
THE GOAL:<br>
So the main goal could be to separate your colors onto the two <br>
triangles, say each should have 1 color A and 1 color B (hopefully <br>
you didn&#x27;t make preset the color scheme to something like all white, <br>
lol). Once your here that and have no parity problem then it is easy <br>
to see what has to be done (2 short glides, with some conjugation in <br>
there (turning the belt to line up the first swap on say the top <br>
layer, doing the equiv of U2, doing an odd number of glides of the <br>
bad belt, and undoing the U2 there, then post-adjust by getting the <br>
unique top sticker back on the top face.)). To actually do the color <br>
separation use this type of technique (it it officially called <br>
commutation or conjugation) with long glides (basically a length 3 <br>
glide of the solved belt (or where the solved belt was, this should <br>
temporarily swap the top and bottom stickers, but this will be <br>
undone in the techniuqe)).<br>
<br>
FIX PARITY ERRORS:<br>
This is where people usually get stuck on doing, i.e. everything <br>
solved except something like the LU and RU stickers need to be <br>
swapped (observe the difference between this and swapping the LD and <br>
RD stickers, one solves into the proper color scheme and the other <br>
solves into a different color scheme, although some of you won&#x27;t <br>
care as long as it looks like solved... I feel this is like solving <br>
the centers of a normal 4x4 wrong.)<br>
<br>
This is at the heart of the difficulty of this puzzle, mostly due to <br>
its high number of intersections... sort of like how solving the <br>
pyraminx for the first time would seem. So I could list a few ways <br>
of doing this but I think it&#x27;ll be better if I just show you how to <br>
solve the example I gave about swapping LU and RU stickers: <br>
(R3F1R3F5-F3R1F3R5-U2), as an abuse of notation :).... Ok so <br>
something like R3 means that looking from the right side, the belt <br>
that lies on the perimeter should be glided 3 times (in either <br>
direction since it&#x27;s a bit of a 180 analog). So as a result the top <br>
and bottom stickers are interchanged and so are the 4 on the F and B <br>
face.<br>
<br>
I ran out of trials on it, so I&#x27;m not 100% this alg works, but on <br>
paper it should at most leave you with something that looks solved <br>
in but in the wrong color scheme (this is easily fixed btw using <br>
commutation of long glides technique).<br>
<br>
As it turns out swapping the UL and DR stickers can be done by using <br>
180ish long glides to swap UL and DR an in exchange swap top and <br>
bottom stickers. Now the cube can be solved by doing the color <br>
scheme correction (I mentioned 2 ways of doing this above).<br>
<br>
1 correct color scheme, 5 worng ones btw. Solving one belt at a time <br>
reduces this possibility to 1 and 1.<br>

whenever P15 came up, I would also execute P15. (permutation <br>
algorithms from www.speedcubing.com).  As I said, I have been working <br>
just fine with all the algorithms in my head for 2 months now maybe.  <br>
Yet one day I just lost P14.  I had to look it up, I tried for 3 full <br>
days to do it without looking it up and I just kept getting it <br>
wrong.  Now that I&#x27;ve looked it up, all is well, but I still for a <br>
split second want to do P15 when P14 comes up.<br>
<br>
Anyone else have similar experiences?  Just your brain overwrote <br>

          <div class="email-content">Very cool! Let&#x27;s see some more cube publicity!
I checked it all out, but it seems that now it has reached its 
bandwidth limit so for the rest of you out there, you may have to 
wait a day or two to see it.

I want a name tag like that... &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube Expert&quot; :). (Aren&#x27;t we 
all cube experts here...) It is incredeble the types of people you 
met there! Brady Bunch and a Yo-Yo champ, not to mention those 
Disney characters...

I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve had the exact same situation, where I actually <br>
forgot an alg, and replaced it with another.  However, I know that I <br>
occasionally will apply the wrong alg, if there is another one that <br>
starts with similar moves.  For example, I have more than one PLL <br>
case that starts out with U R&#x27; D R2 U&#x27; R D&#x27;, and I know I&#x27;ve <br>
exchanged them in the past.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Glad to know I&#x27;m not the only one.  Over the course of the few days 
where I couldn&#x27;t remember the alg, I made up several new ones that 
worked, but they weren&#x27;t as natural as the one that I used 
originally.  Now, having cubed quite a bit for 2 or so days, I&#x27;m back 
on track and my times have never been better.  Just can&#x27;t wait for my 
cube to get here from Ton though!

          <div class="email-content">Hmmm...speaking about the official rubik&#x27;s Cubes, off the top of my head:

For the USA: 3x3x3 in small white box with black printing US market
made in Hungary, and elsewhere.

For the USA: 3x3x3 in larger yellow box wrapped in celophane - made in
Taiwan, and USA, assembled in Dominican Republic, and elsewhere.

For the USA and the world: 3x3x3 in clear plastic cylinder with the
black base - made in Hungary, amd Hong Kong, and USA, and England and
elsewhere.

For England: 3x3x3 cardboard cylinder - made in England, maybe elsewhere.

For the World: 3x3x3 Deluxe in clear plastic cylinder and as part of
Rubik&#x27;s &quot;Game&quot; or &quot;Challenge&quot; in foot long box made in Korea.

4x4x4 made in Hong Kong and Macau, and maybe Korea. Came in large
cardboard box and in clear plastic cylinder.

   Often there is a sticker on the cube or the box which says where
the cube was made.

          <div class="email-content">One way is to just soak it in water for a while. Or spray the entire 
cube with WD-40, then soak it in water. Or, the ickiest method, is 
just turn the sides a lot. And quickly. The sticky gunk comes off 
the cube and on to your hands.

          <div class="email-content">aaah, the part i despise the most.  use rubbing alcohol.  it may take a while.  somethime when my stickers are falling off, usually white followed by blue, i take off the whole face and i use black.  after a while a cubing, the gunk of that face is magically off, since you just wore it off by getting it stuck to your hands.  or you can jsut put it in water to loosen the gunk, but not all of it will come off.  dont put new stickers on the gunk, they will fall off very fast.

use a solvent like isopropyl alcohol. I asked a chemist about
this and it works fairly well and won&#x27;t hurt the plastic, and it&#x27;s
cheap. I tried the gunk remover they had at the O.S.C. and it
didn&#x27;t work any better. If you really want to do a good job then
take the cube completely apart and clean the individual pieces
with &quot;pure wipes&quot; or a similar non abrasive, low lint product. 
One source is National Paper Products Inc. The reason for
taking the cube apart is that there&#x27;s a risk of getting the 
adhesive inside the cube which is hardly desirable.

Water doesn&#x27;t really break down the adhesive very well.

Ok, let me start off by saying that all of those solutions above 
sound *terrible* in my opinion. Just using water isn&#x27;t going to help 
much and using water AND lube.... common&#x27; any of you remember 
chemistry... hehe. However, using rubbing alcohol like Patrick 
suggested is a good idea, but I personally leave chemical treatments 
as a last resort. (I&#x27;ve done this in the past when it is an extreme 
situation...)

The brute force way of doing it, is to spread it to your hands... 
but it&#x27;ll just spread back so that is not too efficent (I only do it 
when not at home). I think the effective method is to do the 
following (in order):
#1. USE TAPE (preferablly heavy-duty duct tape, the wide stuff 
usually grey or brown... but anytape should do)
#2. OLD T-SHIRT/CLOTH (perhaps spraying it with lube first will 
emulsify it sufficently)
#3. SOAP &amp; WATER (I really don&#x27;t see why the other two responses 
never mentioned SOAP! it&#x27;s quite obvious although a pain to do this 
since you&#x27;ll have to dry the pieces...)
#4. ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (last resort, I suggest washing it was water 
afterwards to get rid of any risdual odor even though it evaporates 
fast.)

I usually rub it on a nearby carpet or similar rough surface. It sort <br>

whatever scrape friendly object is available. Nails, credit cards or <br>
pen knifes. After about three rounds of this I deem it &quot;good enough&quot; <br>
and put on the new stickers.<br>

It&#x27;s one of those things that work fine but you can&#x27;t help thinking <br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, using just water works terribly, but it works. And I use WD-40 
to get sticker gunk off of other stuff, which works very well, which 
is why I use it for the cubes.

Will let the group know as soon as there is something up in mpeg format.

          <div class="email-content">Since I have some cubes at my desk at work, I get many questions <br>
about the cube like is it still available<br>
<br>
Today I met a colleague how saw my cubes<br>
<br>
&quot;can you solve it?&quot; He asked<br>
<br>
Yes in about 30 seconds, I answered<br>
<br>
Then he tells me that 20 year ago when he was 18 his average was 30 <br>
seconds, So I let him solve the cube and let him explain his method. <br>
<br>
His first step was make a white cross, secondly place 3 corners and <br>
use the last corner space to put the three middle edges, place the <br>
last corner after this place the last edge and orientates  the edges <br>
of the last layer, then place the corners and orientate, then place <br>
last layer. From this I could see that with this method 30 seconds is <br>
possible.<br>
<br>
He did not had a speedcube in 1981 and he called speedcubing in <br>
1981,  cubing . He did not participate in a Dutch national <br>
championship in 1981 because on school he was number 4, but during <br>
the contest the cubers performed very bad, and he regrets he did  not <br>
participate. <br>
<br>
We talked a while and he left me with a true speedcubers spirit, &quot; It <br>
is nice to do something completely useless&quot; I answered &quot; at least it <br>
is something that I know that I am good at&quot; He confirmed.<br>
<br>
There are some typical speedcubers facts from his story.<br>
<br>
h Fast speedcubers perform bad in competition<br>
h Compare your self with a top speedcuber and assume every body is <br>
faster<br>
h It is completely useless but fun to do!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Apart from it being nice to know there are still people interested 
from my time (early 80s) the description of the algorithm prompted a 
question I&#x27;ve been meaning to ask for a while:

Assuming a very similar approach (cross, 3 corners and middle edges 
in any order, last top corner, last middle edge, then last face) 
every post I come across on here seems to do edges before corners on 
last layer.  Its a pointless question really since since the best 
current methods seem a lot better but is there some reason why 
people don&#x27;t do corners and then edges?  Or maybe they do and I just 
read the posts on algorithms that happen to do edges first!  I 
always found &quot;edge only&quot; moves very natural so leave them to the 
end.  Used to do about 30 seconds with this and under a minute one 
handed.

Any one-handers out there:  As i start to practice and remember my 
old algorithms I find that my onehanded averages are always double 
my twohanded averages - and when I think about it that probably held 
true 20 years ago too.  This is even though I hardkly ever solve the 
cube twohanded any more.  Interested to hear of other peoples 
correlations.

different new posts, so here they are, all in one post:<br>
<br>
SOLVING METHOD:<br>
  Looking at the solving methods of most speedcubists, it looks like <br>
there are four main catagories: the Fridrich method, ZB&#x27;s method, <br>
the Petrus method, and corners first people.  Is there anyone who <br>
does and F2L with a LL consisting of solving corners (however many <br>
looks, I use 2) then solve edges (I use 1.5 looks, but again dosn&#x27;t <br>
really matter), or am I the only one who does anything like that?<br>
<br>
SCHOLARSHIPS:<br>
  I am currently a junior in high school, so I will be going to <br>
collage fairly soon.  One thing I was wondering, are there any <br>
scholarships for Rubik&#x27;s cubes?  Something tells me that being a <br>
world record holder on the pyraminx and being able to solve the <br>
rubiks cube in less than a minute might appeal to collages, but how <br>
can I turn that into scolarships?<br>
<br>
THIS ANNOYING VIRUS DEBATE:<br>
  This is beyond annoying.  I checked my email today and found about <br>
40 new messages, well over half of them were people arguing and <br>
bickering about this stupid virus debate.  I think it&#x27;s getting old, <br>
anyone else think so?  Please don&#x27;t mis interpret this as me <br>
defending anyone or anything, I am just getting annoyed with a huge <br>
debate topic that has absolutely nothing to do with rubik&#x27;s cubes or <br>
any other puzzle on this message board.  Nobody but the people <br>
involved know all facts, and it is my guess that those involved <br>
don&#x27;t even know absolutely everything.  In my personal opinion, it <br>
should have never even been brought up in the first place.  In my <br>
opinion, speedcubing is one of the very few sports that is extremely <br>
competitive, but friendly at the same time.  The last thing we need <br>
is someone getting mad or holding a grudge against someone else <br>
(especially a personal problem) and then people making a big deal <br>
out of it and taking sides.  I consider every one I have met through <br>
cubing to be one of my friends, and I hate being cought between <br>
friends who are arguing over something.  This is getting really <br>
long, so I&#x27;m going to end it with that.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, what you are refering to is the CLL/ELL thing.

There are 3 people in our community known for such a thing and a few that 
you might not expect. First I consider Guus R. Schultz a pioneer in this LL 
method. The two others are Akimoto and me. (I have recently uploaded my 
CLL and ELL set to my website, check it out.) Others that can effectively 
perform this method include Ron, Gilles (he&#x27;s been working on it for his new 
system), LarsP, and probably a few I forgot to mention. The second listing are 
people that don&#x27;t quite do the exact CLL/ELL thing or that it arises from a non-
Fridrich method, perhaps edges already correctly flipped so that they don&#x27;t 
know all the non-trivial ELL situations or didn&#x27;t quite have a proper F2L as in 
Gilles case (I think he leaves two first layer edges unsolved as an 
intermediate step..... similar to what I sometimes do). The first list of 3 are the 
true CLL/ELL solvers, but I don&#x27;t think Guus R. Schultz is an active cuber 
anymore. Of course this list is by no means complete or totally accurate, but I 
hope it answers one of your posted questions.

Btw, I am happy to be apart of this group of solvers :). (No offense to the 
mainstream method of course.)

Timely because my last post had hidden in it exactly this question.  
I orient corners, positions corners and then finish the edges - 3 
looks.  Worst case when all edges are flipped and one is properly 
placed.  I think its fast enough to get under 30 secs but I doubt 
whether I&#x27;ll get much faster than that with this method.  On the 
other hand i think its fine for onehanded cubing when its easier to 
arrange for for a LL you like while solving the F2Ls.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
I was wondering what you guys/girls are doing after the WC 2003.<br>
<br>
My main goal now is to break 13/14 second averages one day.<br>
<br>
At first I started solving corners first. It took me about a month <br>
to get down to low twenties averages. But I already knew a lot of <br>
the necessary algorithms for the Waterman system. I had the most <br>
problems with solving the first 4 corners. It was hard to visualize <br>
this during the preinspection. After 1 month I decided that I would <br>
never break 15 seconds average with that system or variants of it. <br>
<br>
What I am doing now is trying to solve a 2x2x2 block (Lars Petrus), <br>
and after that complete the cross and continue F2L and LL. This was <br>
also very hard to get used to. I was only solving one of the four <br>
white corners. That was hard too. So then I started practicing only <br>
starting with the white/blue/orange corner. That finally brought me <br>
the understanding of the 2x2x2. What I basically do is connect the <br>
white/blue/orange corner piece to either the white/blue or the <br>
white/orange edge. Then connect the other edge to its center. After <br>
that I connect these two blocks to get a 2x2x1 block. Finally I <br>
solve the 3rd edge and insert the block. Now that I am able to <br>
visualize this during preinspection, I am also trying to solve one <br>
of the three other white corners if that would be easier to solve.<br>
Using this approach I average about 3 to 4 moves fewer than the <br>
basic cross/F2L. So this could well be a second once fluently done.<br>
<br>
The biggest gain should come from removing one step of the solution. <br>
I am sure some of us are going to do this, so if you want to be the <br>
3rd world champion, then expect a lot of competition from <br>
those &quot;crazy&quot; guys learning hundreds of algorithms!<br>
Solving a completely random LL in one step seems almost impossible <br>
to me. There are 1211 different algorithms, NOT including the <br>
mirrored cases, the inverse cases and the mirrored inverse cases. <br>
And these other cases are absolutely not trivial being 12.58 moves <br>
average. And of course it will be hard to remember all algorithms <br>
because of the low occurrences of each case.<br>
That means that for the F2L/LL cubists, you should be able to <br>
influence LL during F2L to have fewer different cases. That is how <br>
in 2001, independently of each other, Zbigniew Zborowski and I came <br>
up with the idea of flipping all LL edges during F2L. We now call <br>
this the Zborowski-Bruchem system. ;-)<br>
To be able to do this you need to learn 306 (INCLUDING mirrored <br>
cases) algorithms for flipping LL edges while solving the last <br>
corner/edge pair of F2L. You could do with fewer if you would be <br>
able to have at most 2 flipped edges BEFORE solving the last <br>
corner/edge pair. Or to always have 0 or 4 flipped edges...<br>
And you need to learn 494 algorithms (INCLUDING mirrored cases) for <br>
solving LL in 1 step, once the LL edges are already solved.<br>
Both Zbigniew and I already have more than 100 LL algorithms <br>
covered. And slowly we are working towards the complete set.<br>
Using no algorithms at all and at top speed I have about 50-60% <br>
cases with no edges flipped in LL. I will also be working on getting <br>
this percentage up.<br>
<br>
If people would be able to manage all this stuff on top speed, then <br>
averages of 12 to 13 seconds are very probable.<br>
<br>
What other ideas do you have?<br>
<br>
At the moment I am working on filtering:<br>
1) the last algorithms for F2L with LL edge flipping<br>
2) the corner algorithms for LL including permuting the edges<br>
The filtering is needed to get a list of like 50 algorithms per <br>
case, down to 2 or 3 algorithms per case, each of those being easy <br>
to execute with finger tricks.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate it if 2 of you would help me finish these lists. <br>
Please send me an e-mail.<br>
<br>
Another thing that has proven to be very important is holding your <br>
nerves during a competition. The pressure during the WC final was <br>
too much for me. Recently during Dutch Cube Day I still had <br>
trembling hands, even though the audience wasn&#x27;t that big.<br>
I have been reading a lot about this subject. According to the books <br>
in the end it all comes down to the fear of <br>
failing/losing/underachieving. I can recommend the book &quot;The inner <br>
game of tennis&quot;. In short it is about two persons inside one tennis <br>
player: the 1st person who is perfect at all strokes, and a 2nd <br>
person who is talking to that 1st person to do this or that this or <br>
that way. You can imagine how that 1st person is feeling. So please <br>
let that 2nd person shut up! The same goes for speedcubing. Your <br>
hands are perfect, you have all algorithms and cases covered. So <br>
don&#x27;t let that 2nd person tell your hands what to do!<br>
I will be working very hard on my nerves for upcoming competitions. <br>
Having said that I already put a lot of pressure on myself <br>
again..... :-(<br>
Be prepared too!<br>
<br>
Last month speedcubing.com had its 200,000th visitor on the site. We <br>
now have had visitors from 143 countries (last added countries are <br>
Syria, Kazakhstan and Uganda).<br>
<br>
This week speedcubing.com will be moved to a new host. Our current <br>
host Henk Kuipers (http://www.opensourcesolutions.nl/) got into too <br>
much trouble with his hosting company, because of the high bandwidth <br>
(18GB per month), even though we have the most popular videos on <br>
different web space. Thanks Henk!<br>
I expect the speed of the site to go down a little. But then again <br>
we are free to grow in size and in bandwidth consumption.<br>
<br>
Have fun to all!<br>
And please stop this stupid virus and Microsoft bashing discussion. <br>
I will remove all new messages about viruses. ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi again friendz,<br>
<br>
I just thought we should add some more cubing stuff...<br>
<br>
In Toronto we already saw some cubists focusing on different <br>
puzzles. I especially admire Grant for his MegaMinx achievements and <br>
Lars V for his Square-1 achievements. We also have Masayuki Akimoto <br>
with his beautiful abilities on 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube, with his own <br>
very interesting system.<br>
Recently we have seen Stefan Pochmann with fantastic averages for <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Clock and Skewb.<br>
<br>
When I meet complete puzzle outsiders they are very attracted to <br>
other puzzles than the 3x3x3 cube. MegaMinx is the most popular <br>
because of its nice shape and colors.<br>
<br>
I would recommend everyone to also learn one of the other puzzles. <br>
Just look at how many algorithms Lars V learned for Square-1. That <br>
requires a lot of dedication, but it sure helped him to become world <br>
champion by a large margin.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi again friends,<br>
<br>
One more idea I had involves certain ways to incorrectly or not <br>
completely solve F2L before starting LL.<br>
<br>
Here is an example. If you look at the OLL cases, there are many <br>
possibilities because there are many different ways how the edge <br>
orientation and corner orientation can be positioned relative to <br>
each other. If you have no edges flipped, then there is only one OLL <br>
case per corner orientation. Same for 4 edges flipped. But if two <br>
connecting edges are flipped, then there 4 different OLL cases per <br>
corner orientation case. For two opposite edges flipped there are 2 <br>
different OLL cases per corner orientation case. So in total you <br>
could have 1+1+4+2 is 8 different cases per corner orientation case <br>
(depending on mirrored cases).<br>
Now suppose that you solved the last corner/edge pair of LL with the <br>
edge flipped in its place. Then there are either 1 or 3 edges <br>
flipped in last layer. And for both cases you have 4 different OLL <br>
cases per corner orientation.<br>
This would actually give more than 57 OLL cases, because you cannot <br>
mirror cases when the number of flipped edges is odd. I also think <br>
that these algorithms will be longer than the normal OLL algorithms, <br>
because you still need to flip the middle layer edge.<br>
Other ideas may be to swap two edges of the cross or to always solve <br>
one first layer corner with a 120 degrees twist.<br>
<br>
Could there be advantageous ways to influence LL by incorrectly or <br>
not completely solving F2L?????<br>
I haven&#x27;t found one. I did find advantages for corners first <br>
systems, where you could have fewer cases to learn if you would have <br>
1 or 3 flipped edges in the middle layer instead of 0, connecting 2, <br>
opposite 2, or 4.<br>
<br>
Maybe someone can prove that this is impossible for layer systems?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello Ron and everybody,<br>
<br>
Along the lines of trying to solve the last layer plus a corner edge <br>
pair in two algorithms (like what you and Zbidniew are approaching), <br>
have you ever thought of (1) doing all five corners first (orient and <br>
permute) and then (2) all five edges (orient and permute)?  <br>
<br>
At first the number of algorithms seems insurmountable.  But the idea <br>
here would be to intelligently use the extra open slots where the <br>
corner-edge pair would go.  If the corner-edge pair belongs in the <br>
DRF spot, and the last layer is on top, and you do the sequence Rd&#x27; <br>
(where d&#x27; is a movement of the bottom two layers) then all <br>
the &#x27;unsolved pieces&#x27; are still in the &#x27;unsolved places.&#x27;  <br>
<br>
In this manner you could greatly increase the usefulness of a single <br>
algorithm.  If C is an algorithm that affects only the last layer and <br>
the DRF corner pair, then you also have the algorithms Rd&#x27;CdR&#x27;, <br>
dR&#x27;CRd&#x27;, F&#x27;dCd&#x27;F, and d&#x27;FCF&#x27;d that also only affect the same pieces <br>
(albeit, some of these may be the same algorithm depending on what C <br>
is).  <br>
<br>
In this way the number of different algorithms needed for step (1) <br>
drops down to around 120 (8-9 move average I think) and the number of <br>
algorithms for step (2) is also just a little over 100  (I think, I <br>
haven&#x27;t rigorously counted these yet...but it should be around 120 <br>
also)......and this includes mirror images AND inverses.<br>
<br>
True, due to those extra &#x27;preparatory&#x27; moves an approach like this <br>
would have a higher average move count for the last pair plus LL <br>
(probably around 4-5 moves) than the Z-B method (or should I say Z-<br>
you method).  But I believe these &#x27;extra moves&#x27; can be done quite <br>
fast and with less than a third of the total algorithms needed for <br>
the Z-B method, I&#x27;ve decided to give this a try......hopefully I&#x27;ll <br>
have more to report in a month or two.<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think.<br>
<br>
Also, I recently switched over to doing a 2x2x2 block at the <br>
beginning instead of the cross too.....blew my mind at first, but now <br>
I really enjoy it.<br>
<br>
Happy cubing,<br>

          <div class="email-content">I took a short break from cubing, but now I&#x27;m doing it again. I was 
inspired to work on my 4x4x4 times, and now I&#x27;ve got myself down to 
an average of 2 minutes 30 seconds. Unfortunately, I still haven&#x27;t 
persuaded myself to learn the single edge-pair orientation algorithm. 
I need to know that before 2005, if I hope to compete. The 5x5x5 
still takes me around 20 minutes, though. :)
Also, I&#x27;ve been working a lot on one handed stuff. My new record is 
32 seconds, and I&#x27;ve lowered my average down to 44.84 seconds. I&#x27;m 
getting a sub-40 time at least once a day now.

Isn&#x27;t that 2x2x2 --> cross that you&#x27;re talking about Chris&#x27;s Extended 
Cross method? I tried that, but I&#x27;m terrible at making the cross. I 
could work on it, but Lars&#x27; method is working fine for me now.

I&#x27;m a corners&#x27; first guy and I&#x27;m also doing it one-handed. I use quite
some slice moves since I do a truly corners&#x27; first, that is

1) top four corners
2) bottom four corners
3) top and bottom edges pairwise
4) middle layer

One-handed, I do the slice moves with my thumb, having the index
finger on the back side of the top layer and the middle finger at the
back side of the bottom layer. It works fine for me, even if I haven&#x27;t
timed my performace lately. I believe I do it one-handed in just under
3 min, without any dedicated practice.

          <div class="email-content">Greetings Duncan,

   I usually solve the LL corners first.  There are only two &quot;wrong&quot;
corner positions - one solved on 6 moves the other in 7 moves, and I
can usually twist the corners in 7 moves, but I&#x27;m slowly approaching
one algorithm per position. I don&#x27;t use the usual F2L solutions that
most people use. I also started cubing in the 80&#x27;s.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

   You asked. > Could there be advantageous ways to influence LL by
incorrectly or not completely solving F2L????? &lt;

   Possibly. For example, if in the usual F2L approach (cross etc) 
you might work out all the possiblilties of placing the fourth corner
in such a way that the LL corners are solved. If this is simplified by
making a small change in the LL before doing it that  would make the
answer a definite yes.

   I can usually get to the LL with only two edges or none flipped over.

   I don&#x27;t use any the more popular strategies for the first two
levels. I don&#x27;t know if anyone would be interested in my system, but
would you be willing to put it up on your page?

   Thanks,

David J

20.5 s
Getting closer... :-)

But I often spend more than 4 secs on the last 4 corners.
Some configurations can be recognized immediately, others are much
difficult to see (3 misoriented corners).

Do you think that analyzing corners should take more time than
permutations for example?

Gilles.

Wow Gilles, this is great! You improved so fast.
What do you think will be the limits of your system? Will it be 
possible, maybe with some additional algorithms, to one day beat 16 
seconds?
How is the number of moves going? On your site you write 48.4 
average. Is this number going down too?
I tried your system several times. Step 1 should be easy after some 
practice (thanks to Lars Petrus). But step 2 seems to be the hardest 
part. Especially because the edges can still be almost anywhere on 
the cube.
Step 3 can be done in under 3 seconds average. Are you already using 
the Waterman way for recognizing the cases? For the 3 misoriented 
corners I always move the top layer to a standard position for 
recognizing AND starting the algorithm. Most of the time I can 
recognize the case while doing that U move. I personally do not use 
optimal algorithms, because the algorithms I use now are the ones 
who do not flip LL edges. This is the first step to learn all 494 
cases.
For step 4 the fastest way may be to solve the last L and R edge in 
one algorithm, and then solve the M layer edges in one algorithm.
The most interesting part of your system is that quite a big part of 
the system is intuitive. For the CFOP system (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL) 
only the cross is completely intuitive. The more algorithms the 
faster you can move. It is very good that you can do 48 partly 
intuitive moves in 20 seconds average.

That sounds like a promising idea.
If you would have one corner already correctly twisted in top layer, 
then you could move that to URB and then do an R move. This would 
give you 4 incorrect corners in LL. And you could use the dirty edge 
at FR (after the R move it is UR).
I tried this several times yesterday and the only problem is to 
quickly recognize the cases. You cannot use the normal Waterman 
recognition system with the sticker colors. It is also hard to 
recognize because two corners (the ones now at FRU and BRU) should 
be twisted differently. F.i. for BRU should not have the top layer 
color on top, but to the back.
You can also use your idea to solve the edges. Especially if one of 
the top layer edges is already solved. Then you can simply do a U 
turn to move it to UR and then do the R move again to leave 4 
unsolved edges in LL. Then you can use ELL moves.
It would be nice if one of the club members (maybe you) could work 
out a complete list of algorithms, or at least find out the number 
of algorithms to learn.


About deleting the club messages on the virus subject.
I am very sorry to have deleted messages that were helping people 
against a possible virus threat. That was not my intention. I did 
want to delete some &quot;virus&quot; messages. But after searching for the 
word &quot;virus&quot; on the club I simply clicked &quot;delete&quot; too early, before 
unselecting most of the neutral messages. My sincere apologies for 
this. Even though these messages were clearly off topic - our topic 
here is cubing - they could have been helpful to people. I never had 
the intention to silence people. You are free to post here and your 
message will be sent to most club members (80%??) by e-mail.
A single warning message like &quot;I had a virus on my computer, so be 
careful when opening messages from me or other cube friends.&quot; would 
have been enough.

I am not sorry for deleting messages that had a personal touch 
against any other club member. If you have a personal problem with 
someone else, then you should solve that problem in a personal way. 
You cannot publish personal messages from someone else to a public 
forum without that person&#x27;s consent. These club messages will stay 
here for a loooong time. So people can even find these messages in 
10 years, and it could really work against you or someone else. F.i. 
if you or he/she would be looking for a job.

If you want me to repost all neutral messages (I have them in my 
club mail folder), then please let me know. If you want me to stop 
being the moderator of this club, then also let me know. In a 
PERSONAL e-mail.

Now back to cubing on this club! There is so much to talk about.
Who has a fantastic new system?
What is everyone doing after the WC?
What kind of tips do you have on controlling nerves during a 
competition?
Who has some good tips on permuting the edges for blindfold solving?

Would US cubists join a possible European championship in august 
2004? What could we do to make it a little more interesting than 
just watching?

Have fun,

Ron

I forgot to finish that thought... the point of the tabbed messages in DeadAIM is that if you already have a window open, and someone IMs you (even with no away message) there won&#x27;t be a new pop-up. If you want, you can IM yourself to ensure that you dont get a pop-up.

Yes, 4s or more is a bit too long to spend on the corners. 
Recognition for this step &#x27;can&#x27; be extrememly fast if not instant. 
This is especially true if you do this by pattern recognition. I 
have a full set of CLLs on my site (converted to jpg so all browers 
can now display it properly) that you may want to check out... about 
half of them are with LL on bottom though (old habits die hard). I 
have it categroized by the purmutaton of the corners first then by 
orientation. This way inverses and mirrors are grouped together. But 
you do have it right, there are indeed 24 cases here (not including 
corners solved). Most of them are quite simple.

Going back to recognition, I think that the way you have it layed 
out on your site is great. It is mainly going to be about practice 
now. Reduce the number of times you have to do a pre-adjust to 
determine the case. I usually pick a corner (preferable one that is 
orientated) and decide if what is diagonally opposite it is what 
should be there (relatively) if so then check if there needs to be a 
diagonal swap of the other two corners. If the opposite corner is 
not in the proper relative position, which direction should it go. 
Then I figure out if it&#x27;s a 3-corner cycle or 2 corner swap 
(although the two are actually equivalent).
As I&#x27;m doing all that, I&#x27;ll of already gotton enough of an imprint 
of the orientations that I&#x27;d of already started the algorithm.
This brings me to another point... 2/3 of the time it is an adjacent 
corner swap. So I actually just assume it will be that before I even 
get there and for the twists I get, start the algorithm that way. I 
stop myself if I find that OH... it was somethign else.... (the time 
I gain making assumptions is outweights the time I lose on average!)
So I already start an algorithm before I finish recognition. Also 
the first turn I try to do during regripping or just before even.
All these little efficencies add up.

But this works out exceptionally well for me since in my method, I 
can start CLL recognition early as I&#x27;m finishing my last step of F2L 
and for some odd reason (perhaps due to other selective 
preprocessing I do) get a significanty greater percentage chance of 
getting Adjacent corner swaps and rarely get No corner swaps (when I 
do get no corners swaped I have a high, say 1/3 chance, of solving 
in one algorithm due to some extensive algorithm sets I know.)
Besides doing CLL recognition I do half of ELL recognition here too. 
I know at least 2 or 3 algs for each CLL case and select an 
appropriate one based on edge flip and the current grip angle (much 
of the time solving an edge symutaneously).

CLL should be about as fast as other steps like OLL or PLL once you 
have mastered it. On average it takes me 3s (my dexterity isn&#x27;t that 
great but I have good recognition for this step) and would take 
someone like Akimoto even less time (on average).

But if you want it to show an accurate record, then you can download

think you can do that, anyway.

Hi Gilles, 

As Doug mentioned, I use CLL-ELL system. 
Since most of the people use OLL-PLL system, I have not had much 
information about CLL. So I had to develop the recognition system by  
myself. 

I am grad to hear from you.

I agree with you that 3 misoriented corners are most tough ones. 
When I started CLL-ELL system, It took about 10 sec for recognition 
of CLL. 
But I can recognize CLL in one second now. 
I don&#x27;t figure out how corners have to move but I use just color 
patterns. 

Cases of 3 misoriented corners. 

#1 Check corner colors on LL. You will see two opponent colors (W-B 
or Y-G in your case) and another color. 

#2-1 two opponent colors locate at adjuscent corners. 
 I normally place the oriented corner at FR or FL
 along with two opponet colors FR BR or FL BL. 
 2-1-1 The oriented corner is FR
	The 1st move is R, the 2nd move you still need to choose 
one of two. 
 2-1-2 The oriented corner is L
	The first move is L, the 2nd move you still need to choose 
one of two. 

#2-2 two opponent colors locate at diagonal corners. 
 I normally place the oriented corner at FR or FL
 along with the other front corner piece has LL color at F. 
 2-2-1 The oriented corner is FR
	The 1st move is L&#x27;, the 2nd move you still need to choose 
one of two. 
 2-2-2 The oriented corner is L
	The first move is R, the 2nd move you still need to choose 
one of two. 

So it is sort of three step recognition but I can start the first 
move before final decision. 
I am working on CLL with or without flipping edges to get easy ELL. 
But I am not going to complete 3 misoriented corners because Sune or 
anti-Sune? is too fast to think edge flipping. 

I hope you will get sub20 soon with your new method.

At the moment I have two ambitions: averaging sub-17 on the 3x3x3 and 
averaging sub-30 on the Square-1.

On the 3x3x3 I have been getting a lot of averages in the 18,0-18,5 
lately, and also some 17,5-18,0 averages. But my F2L averages are 
still 12-13 seconds so if I can improve my looking ahead I can beat 
the 17 second barrier for sure, and maybe even get sub-16, but it will 
require a lot of practice I feel.

As for averaging sub-30 on the Square-1: I have had two sub-30 
averages so far. I have learned a new set of edge algorithms a few 
weeks ago and they&#x27;ve helped me tremendously. My normal averages are 
in the 30-32,5 seconds range. There are still 3 problem edge cases 
that I plan to learn and that should enable me to average sub-30 
consistently with a lot of practice. After that, it&#x27;s up to you guys 
to catch me up ;D

I&#x27;m also contemplating switching to the ZB system. I&#x27;m now 
investigating the possibility to flip edges during F2L without having 
to learn all 125 algorithms that are listed on Zbigniew&#x27;s site. Dan 
Harris and me had a very enlightning conversation about this yesterday 
and I&#x27;m going to post about this subject later.

Cheers,
LarsV

          <div class="email-content">Hello everyone.  Since WC2003 went off so well I think it would be <br>
nice to have more frequent competitions :)  Anyway, I for one have <br>
already made plans to attend the European Championships in 2004, <br>
assuming it is open to non-Europeans :)  Also I would like to say <br>
that I am *very* interested in organizing an Eastern US/Full US <br>
competition.  I will probably try to organize an unofficial <br>
competition at my school (around 12,000 undergrads) to get an idea <br>
of how to do this.  I already had one of the official timers from <br>
speedstacks.com, and I recently ordered a tournament display as <br>
well.  Once that comes in I want to put this unofficial competition <br>
into the works.  Also I would really love to compete if I help <br>
organize a local/eastern/US competition, whatever it turns out to <br>
be.  If I were to hold a competition I would be able to try to <br>
locate a place here in Raleigh, North Carolina which I think would <br>
be an ok location for an eastern competition because it is in the <br>
middle between Florida and Maine, however I am not fixed on trying <br>
to hold it here if I have it.  I am trying to find out the rules for <br>
setting up a competition officially, and I have been in contact with <br>
David Hedley Jones and Dan Gosbee, so I have somewhat of an idea of <br>
what is required.  Would anyone from the US be interested in <br>
attending an official competition?  I am shooting for somewhere <br>
around summer of 2004, so if the competition pulls through we would <br>
probably not be able to attend the European championships, but think <br>
of how cool it would be to have a European and a US competition in <br>
the same year?  This would help considerably for letting people know <br>
about WC2005 if it pulls through also.<br>
<br>
Anyway I think it would be required to have a third party organizer, <br>
though I am still trying to find this information out.  First of all <br>
would anyone be willing to compete in a Eastern US, or US <br>
competition in summer of 2004?  If the competition is only Eastern, <br>
anyone who shows up would of course be able to compete, at least <br>
that is what I would like to plan.  If we get someone to help <br>
organize around the Midwest, then the competition could have a very <br>
central location to everyone and be a full blown US championship.  <br>
If the competition would just be Eastern Regional one then I can <br>
definitely start trying to find a location and hold it here in <br>
Raleigh.<br>
<br>
Also would anyone know who to talk to in order to find an <br>
organizer?  Where is a good place to start?  I wouldn&#x27;t mind <br>
organizing the competition if I can&#x27;t find someone to help out, <br>
though I would rather help as much as I can but find a third party <br>
organizer and still be able to compete.  So if anyone is interested <br>
in competing, or helping organize or anything PLEASE let me know.  <br>
I&#x27;m just trying to see if there is any interest, and if there is I <br>
want to get the ball rolling.  If nothing else I&#x27;ll organize a North <br>
Carolina state-wide competition, which would be easier to set up, <br>
and maybe someone will take the idea and run with it for a US <br>
competition.<br>
<br>
I have one official timer and a tournament display to donate, as <br>
well as my time.  Would anyone else be willing to help set this up, <br>
or be willing to compete?  E-mail me or send a message to this group <br>
if you&#x27;re interested.<br>
<br>
Hope to hear from a lot of you,<br>

make it, just say the word.  I should also have an

Just got back... and we did not succeed in negative time unfortunately.  Our trip took 
positive 4 minutes and 15 seconds (huge accident on Highway 101 forced us to take

mouths!  Anyway... as for the Rubik&#x27;s cube, it took me 59 seconds to solve with a 
horrendous mistake in putting up the cross but I average 40 anyway so I guess it 
could have been worse.  So, if we go by the time, I solved the Rubik&#x27;s Cube in 
negative 59 minutes and 1 second.

          <div class="email-content">Same here, I would love to attend such a thing. By then I&#x27;ll 
probably get an official timer to bring along also. But I also know 
that organizing these types of things is very hard, especially 
without the proper help. A logistical nightmere to say the least.

I know there are a fair number of cubist from the Carolina area and 
you may have enough friends on campus to chip in, so you might have 
the proper resources to get it all going. Just keep me (us) 
posted... I&#x27;ll try to help in any way possible and see if there is 
any interest in my university cube club. Might even get funding for 
a group of students to travel to Raleigh :). Either way once you set 
a date and location, I&#x27;ll get some decent publicity for it.

Oh ya, and make sure it&#x27;s not in hte school year, during finals 
week, etc... Summer is ideal, and I would say sometime in June (just 
to allow for some unforseen delays).

          <div class="email-content">i think it would be cool to have a bunch of regional
championships...like southeast regional championship,
southwest regional championship, etc.  Then have
someone in the central part of the states host a
finals championship.  This way there won&#x27;t be as much
&#x27;extreme&#x27; travel for everyone to be involved in a US
championship in some way.  Maybe the prize for
qualifying for the US finals would be an expense paid
trip.  This of course would take many many more people
to organize, but it would make things a lot more
interesting.  there is the problem of course, that you
wouldn&#x27;t be able to meet up with all the people you&#x27;d
like to see from across the country...I dunno, just my
two cents.

<br>
<br>
  Hello everyone.  Since WC2003 went off so well I think it would be <br>
  nice to have more frequent competitions :)  Anyway, I for one have <br>
  already made plans to attend the European Championships in 2004, <br>
  assuming it is open to non-Europeans :)  Also I would like to say <br>
  that I am *very* interested in organizing an Eastern US/Full US <br>
  competition.  I will probably try to organize an unofficial <br>
  competition at my school (around 12,000 undergrads) to get an idea <br>
  of how to do this.  I already had one of the official timers from <br>
  speedstacks.com, and I recently ordered a tournament display as <br>
  well.  Once that comes in I want to put this unofficial competition <br>
  into the works.  Also I would really love to compete if I help <br>
  organize a local/eastern/US competition, whatever it turns out to <br>
  be.  If I were to hold a competition I would be able to try to <br>
  locate a place here in Raleigh, North Carolina which I think would <br>
  be an ok location for an eastern competition because it is in the <br>
  middle between Florida and Maine, however I am not fixed on trying <br>
  to hold it here if I have it.  I am trying to find out the rules for <br>
  setting up a competition officially, and I have been in contact with <br>
  David Hedley Jones and Dan Gosbee, so I have somewhat of an idea of <br>
  what is required.  Would anyone from the US be interested in <br>
  attending an official competition?  I am shooting for somewhere <br>
  around summer of 2004, so if the competition pulls through we would <br>
  probably not be able to attend the European championships, but think <br>
  of how cool it would be to have a European and a US competition in <br>
  the same year?  This would help considerably for letting people know <br>
  about WC2005 if it pulls through also.<br>
<br>
  Anyway I think it would be required to have a third party organizer, <br>
  though I am still trying to find this information out.  First of all <br>
  would anyone be willing to compete in a Eastern US, or US <br>
  competition in summer of 2004?  If the competition is only Eastern, <br>
  anyone who shows up would of course be able to compete, at least <br>
  that is what I would like to plan.  If we get someone to help <br>
  organize around the Midwest, then the competition could have a very <br>
  central location to everyone and be a full blown US championship.  <br>
  If the competition would just be Eastern Regional one then I can <br>
  definitely start trying to find a location and hold it here in <br>
  Raleigh.<br>
<br>
  Also would anyone know who to talk to in order to find an <br>
  organizer?  Where is a good place to start?  I wouldn&#x27;t mind <br>
  organizing the competition if I can&#x27;t find someone to help out, <br>
  though I would rather help as much as I can but find a third party <br>
  organizer and still be able to compete.  So if anyone is interested <br>
  in competing, or helping organize or anything PLEASE let me know.  <br>
  I&#x27;m just trying to see if there is any interest, and if there is I <br>
  want to get the ball rolling.  If nothing else I&#x27;ll organize a North <br>
  Carolina state-wide competition, which would be easier to set up, <br>
  and maybe someone will take the idea and run with it for a US <br>
  competition.<br>
<br>
  I have one official timer and a tournament display to donate, as <br>
  well as my time.  Would anyone else be willing to help set this up, <br>
  or be willing to compete?  E-mail me or send a message to this group <br>
  if you&#x27;re interested.<br>
<br>
  Hope to hear from a lot of you,<br>

<br>
Maybe there will be enough of a &quot;cube dynamic&quot; for there<br>

          <div class="email-content">That sounds great! I would love to attend a US competition. I think 
organizing them would be easier if someone had carried out that idea 
we were talking about a while ago for an official Rubiks Cube Group. 
But that idea sort of died out.... It seems like no one wants to do 
the work to get one started.
But I would definitely come to a Rubiks Cube competition in the 
summer.

          <div class="email-content">A competition would be really nice. Will you accept  bit of an 
anomaly, such as cubr art? Those of you who have seen me in Toronto, 
will surely testfy that  my 3d designs were made from actual Rubik&#x27;s 
cubes, the same cubes you use for speedcubing. And Ihave to solve 
the cube, only slower. :-)

I also like the idea of the Rubik&#x27;s cube group, a group of cube-
lovers. Agin, it should accept all cube trends, as long as rhey are 
rwlatwd to the Rubik&#x27;s cube.

This is a very fun thing to do, and it doesn&#x27;t really require any<br>

http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step2.html<br>
<br>
This page just focuses on how to efficiently manipulate edge<br>
orientations. You would already be an expert at joining the last<br>
corner/edge pair, this is just a supliment. If you combine the two<br>
skills together, then you could do ZB step 2 intuitively.<br>
<br>
The other thing that you can do is orient some edges before you even get<br>
to this step. It is a matter of knowing how all of your algorithms<br>
affect the edge orientations and learning different algorithms that have<br>
different effects.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yep, you said it... This technique is fantastic. I find myself using 
it more and more frequently.

I&#x27;d like to take this opportunity to thank Zbigniew for his work, 
publishing all the extended c/e pairing algorithms on his site 
(multiple grip angles too!). I printed out the tables and I found 
myself carrying it around everywhere I go the past couple months. 
When ever I see an interesting case that I have a gut feeling has an 
elegant solution to I look it up and practive it a dozen times. If I 
think or recall that teh solution is lengthy I just do my normal 
thing.

All together, if I was actively using it I would raise my EO-
percentage up to about 50%!

Of course, you can do better if you prepare the LL a little first before<br>

<br>
Interesting... How do you intend to make use of this extra corner?<br>
<br>
I would not have seen the use of solving a single corner, but Doug Li&#x27;s<br>
video shows an interesting technique that can make use of it<br>
(http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/videos.html). That is, the last<br>
corner and edge are simultaneously inserted into different slots.<br>
<br>
Of course, 2 extra movements are required to align and restore the D<br>
face, and recognition is a bit more difficult.<br>
<br>
Personally, I find it easier to attach an extra edge onto the 2x2x2<br>
instead of an extra corner (it usually takes just one move after the<br>
2x2x2 without any forward planning, provided that you don&#x27;t mind picking<br>
any colour).<br>
<br>
&gt; The biggest gain should come from removing one step of the solution. <br>
<br>
Right, you remove a step in the LL:<br>
<br>
1. 2x2x2<br>
2. two edges<br>
3. pair<br>
4. pair<br>
5. pair + orient LL edges<br>
6. LL<br>
<br>
6 steps instead of the standard 7 of Fridrich.<br>
<br>
Also, my system:<br>
<br>
1. 2x2x2<br>
2. square<br>
3. square<br>
4. F2L edge + orient LL edges<br>
5. F2L corner + permute LL edges<br>
6. LL<br>
<br>
6 steps. All the optimisation is done in the first two layers.<br>

Hi Ron,

I don&#x27;t post a lot, but I am still an active cuber. I have a new 
personal of 17.96

I think that other speedcubers generally don&#x27;t use less moves than I 
do, they move faster! Am I right in this, guys? I know all Fridrich 
LL algs and a few more.

So I tried to improve my average number of moves per second. 

This is the result of a run (I am a fast counter, so I can count 
during a speedsolve. Is there anyone else who can accurately do 
that?) When I try to turn a lot faster, I end up doing more moves 
because of mistakes I make. OTOH, the result time does improve with 
the number of moves per second. If I&#x27;d be able to go to 3 moves per 
second I would have an average of 20 seconds.

          <div class="email-content">Hi<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t want to brag... But it was a fact at WC2003 that I had <br>
absolutely no problem standing there on the podium.<br>
<br>
Let me consider what I think made this possible for me, and perhaps <br>
help some of you:<br>
<br>
1. I consider cubing a hobby. Becoming a &#x27;champion&#x27; has never been a <br>
goal for me. I set out with a realistic, yet hard goal. I would try <br>
to make it in the top 20. In the end, I didn&#x27;t succeed, because the <br>
competition was very good. But I am one of the few who was able to <br>
set under-average times in both my two rounds. (My best average at <br>
that time was 26, and I had 25 and 24.8 in the contest). Remember <br>
that if you set yourself an impossible goal, you can stay relaxed in <br>
the knowledge that you have nothing to lose, and no chance to win.<br>
<br>
2. I have a lot of experience standing in front of a group, as I used <br>
to be a trainer for five years. I learnt how to prepare standing in <br>
front of an audience. When I started I was very nervous, but I learnt <br>
that having a plan and knowing exactly what to do lets nerves melt <br>
immediately.<br>
<br>
3. I am convinced that no one present would expect me to <br>
perform &#x27;great&#x27; or set any records. I stood there for me, and for no <br>
one else.<br>
<br>
4. Yasmara (my wife) having absolute faith in me, and being there.<br>
<br>
5. Right before the final competition, Jessica, Mirek and us went for <br>
lunch. Now that may seem stupid, but taking your mind off the <br>
competition helps a lot. Eating and drinking makes you comfortable.<br>
<br>
6. Two year of practicing meditation, Aikido and T&#x27;ai Chi. This is <br>
only a small part of staying relaxed, but it means you will become <br>
skilled at controlling your body in extreme situations. <br>
<br>
So my tips are these:<br>
- when you feel you are getting nervous, concentrate on what you <br>
know: you can solve a cube very fast. Breath deep and slow and say to <br>
yourself: &quot;There is no one here. There is just me and my cube. I am <br>
completely relaxed. I will solve this cube lightning fast. I trust in <br>
my skills.&quot;<br>
- wait for a while in this state if you can until you can breath <br>
normally.<br>
- practice performing in front of people. Especially people who <br>
expect great things from you.<br>
- see yourself as the worst cuber of all times. You can only improve <br>
from there and you will always impress yourself. So focus on the guys <br>
who are better then you and say to yourself: &quot;I can never win from <br>
him. All I can do is participate. The result is unimportant.&quot;<br>
- have someone supportive travel with you, or team up with someone to <br>
be your &#x27;support-buddy&#x27;. For this person: remember that <br>
saying &quot;you&#x27;re the best cuber of all times&quot; just makes things worse. <br>
Say things like &quot;we&#x27;re here to have fun. I don&#x27;t care what position <br>
you end up.&quot;<br>
- eat, drink, go to the bathroom, make sure your body feels ok. <br>
- try some form of &#x27;skill&#x27; that could help you, whether it be <br>
hypnotherapy, meditation, guided visualisations, or pep-talks.<br>
- if you&#x27;re well known in the community, then realize that all of us <br>
know about your skill. We have seen your video&#x27;s, your averages in <br>
the sunday contest, we know each other. If you mess up completely in <br>
the competition, remember that everyone still knows your average.<br>
- never ever ever brag about a &#x27;record&#x27; that you never had, that was <br>
actually a lucky case, or a one time event. If necessary, only tell <br>
people your average, and maybe even add a second to not make <br>
expectations too high. Of course, if you feel self assured you can <br>
tell people anything you like.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been putting a lot of thought lately in finding a way to <br>
gradually learn the ZB (Zbigniew-Bruchem) system. This involves <br>
solving the cross, solving 3 F2L pairs, flipping the LL edges while <br>
solving the 4th F2L pair, and finally solving the LL in one. But <br>
nobody just learns all the 799 algorithms required (including <br>
inverted, mirrored and mirrored inverse cases) in one go. As with the <br>
classic F2L/LL system, we have to find a way to start with a <br>
&quot;beginner&#x27;s method&quot; (like the 4-look and 3-look LL) and then slowly <br>
work your way to learning to full set of algorithms (like the full <br>
2-look LL). Ohterwise, even the most dedicated people will find it <br>
very hard to keep themselves motivated when learning this system. <br>
After some discussions with Dan Harris, Dan and I worked out a system <br>
that could very well prove to be the ideal &quot;intermediate method&quot;.<br>
<br>
The way I solve F2L, 95% of the pairs are what I call &quot;pair-insert&quot; <br>
pairs. You do a 3-4 move sequence to pair the corner and edge and <br>
follow it with a 3-4 move sequence to insert it. After the pairing <br>
process, you are always left with two trivial cases: the corner and <br>
edge are either connected in the LL, or they are seperated in such a <br>
way that they can be inserted easily. Now instead of learning ALL <br>
optimal algs for pairing AND inserting the pair and flipping the LL <br>
edges, you could just pair them up the normal way and then do the<br>
edge <br>
flipping while you insert them. This would require learning only 16 <br>
sequences, since there are 8 ways the LL edges can be flipped for<br>
each <br>
of the 2 trivial cases I mentioned. These sequence are also part of <br>
the full ZB system (tables D1 and E2 on Zbigniew&#x27;s site) so you only <br>
learn usefull things. Of course, the more intuitive approach<br>
explained <br>
on Ryan Heise&#x27;s website is just as good. This would average <br>
approximately 10 moves for the final pair.<br>
<br>
Then for solving the LL, you could learn the 42 COLL algorithms<br>
(solve <br>
corners + orientation last layer). Those algorithms are also a subset <br>
of the ZB system, so once again you only learn usefull things. After <br>
that, you are left with either a 3-cycle of edges, the 2-permutation <br>
or the cross permutation of edges, which most speedcubers would <br>
consider to be among their faster algorithms. The average number of <br>
moves for solving the LL this way is approximately 19,5 moves.<br>
<br>
The advantages of this sytem are:<br>
- it&#x27;s a complete system that enables you to solve the cube every <br>
time.<br>
- It averages only slightly more moves as the classic F2L/OLL/PLL <br>
system, but it can certainly be just as fast.<br>
- you already know a small number of algorithms required for the ZB <br>
system.<br>
- you get familiarised with the overall feel and the thinking and <br>
recognition process of the ZB system.<br>
- you only learn usefull things if your long term ambition is to<br>
learn <br>
the ZB system.<br>
<br>
And above all: it&#x27;s fun! I&#x27;ve been practicing it the last couple of <br>
days and it looks as if it can be really fast.<br>

This is cool :-)

Thanks for your very detailed messages, they do help.
I think I didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to others&#x27; extensive surveys.
After all, it really does not seem that hard, give me 2 months!

> What do you think will be the limits of your system? Will it be
possible, maybe with some additional algorithms, to one day beat 16
seconds?

The limits of this approach? Well, I don&#x27;t know exactly, the limit is
where people can&#x27;t go faster. For now it&#x27;s 20.5s, and *I* will never
be able to reach 16s.
&quot;Theoritically&quot; speaking I would say steps1+2=8s (F2L minus 2 pieces),
step3=3s and step4=5s --> 16s.
But my theory says 16s too for F2L+OLL+PLL ;-)

> For step 4 the fastest way may be to solve the last L and R edge in
one algorithm, and then solve the M layer edges in one algorithm.

(Step 4 - Method 4)
Mhhh... Maybe... Maybe not.
Ok, 1 look is impossible, so 2 looks seems good. But I don&#x27;t know how
fast algs for random M pieces can be (ask Minh Thaï?).
(recognition time? dexterity?)
I think that the best solution would not be 1 only technique, but an
hybridation of many, as I&#x27;ve written on my page.
Think of methods as complementary. Some are good in specific
situations, some in others.

Look at my &quot;Step 4 - Method 2&quot;. It may seem a bit difficult, 3
steps... But it is not.
In fact, sub-steps 1 and 2 can make only one, if you slow down to 5
moves/sec during sub-step 1.
UL and UR are easily located while performing the move. They are the
only remaining L and R edges, with bright colors (that&#x27;s why I choose
to put yellow and white on the sides, and white on the right side
makes step 2 easier). Plus, their orientation is constrained at the
end of the sub-step 1 move.
Ok, I may be biased, I like this method because it&#x27;s mine ;-) But most
of all, I like it because it&#x27;s almost completely intuitive, you can
learn it in 10 minutes.
And maybe, if you know some patterns, you can shorten the worst
combined sequences.
(&lt;15 moves...4 moves/sec...)

The hybridation may look like this:
*one*) If UL or UR is solved automagically (chances: 23/144), or if
you can solve one with 1 or 2 moves (?/?) ---> Do &quot;Step 4 - Method 1&quot;.
*two*) If edges orientation is easy, let&#x27;s say 5 moves (chances:
13/32) ---> Do &quot;Step 4 - Method 2&quot;.
*three*) Else ---> Do &quot;Step 4 - Method 4&quot; for example.
*...*)

The problem with multi-methods is decision time (experience is the key).
So here&#x27;s another idea...
At the beginning of step 3, while looking for corners configuration,
you may detect, half consciously, how many misoriented edges you&#x27;ll
have later (3 is perfect) *if* you stick to corners sequences that
don&#x27;t flip edges.
So you can prepare mentaly to perform *two* or completely forget it in
the decision stage.

> How is the number of moves going? On your site you write 48.4
average. Is this number going down too?

45 is not difficult (as with other methods), but of course, not in
speedcubing. I think I&#x27;m slightly above 50, mainly because of too many
(but fast!) UMR moves during step 2. 


By the way, I just updated my site with sexy animated Java cubes and
pictures.

          <div class="email-content">I also wasn&#x27;t too nervous, but I think this is because I have <br>
experience with being in front of people. I do magic. Only close up <br>
magic, though, so I was never in front of that many people. Only <br>
about fifteen or twenty at the most. But it still helped me.<br>
<br>
I also completely agree with your first tip. If you have your mind <br>
set on just doing as well as you can, and trying to do better than <br>
everyone, then you&#x27;ll get much more nervous. You should just cube <br>
like normal and have a good time. It&#x27;s just for fun, not for <br>
competition. (well, it is for competition, but don&#x27;t let your brain <br>
tell you that.)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll be there...preferably with a misc. puzzle catagory (including pyraminx :))  Also with the idea of regonal competitions then a national, I think that it would be good to have both, but not related to each other.  If the regonals were linked to the nationals, it would be less &quot;open&quot; meaning that only the winners of the regonal competitions would &quot;advance&quot; to the national competition.  But, having regonal competitions (independent of national) would still be good becuase they would allow people who couldn&#x27;t travel to still compete.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I can affirm that last idea. I have some friends here at college that do
that anyway (but just for fun) and I find it really helpful in honing my
concentration. One time when there were about seven of us, only two knew
about my &quot;skill&quot;, and it was brought up that I could solve it- during
one of the solves I felt very good about it- even while they were saying
stuff like that. I finished very well- I usually range between 45 and 55
seconds, and that time was my first under 40... 39.90 seconds. I was so
hyped! I was also surprised, since the others were giving the usual
reaction I get when new people watch me, and that is usually pretty
distracting. I know I can do better- my hands shook a lot too :)
My two cents ^-^

I was bored i find it missing. Come to find out the cleaning lady <br>
threw it away with 2 other new cubes and another new one i used for <br>

          <div class="email-content">If you want to hear about RWC 2003, you just need to check out the 
websites of various cubers. I have posted some stuff here:
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksWorldChampionships2003.ht
ml
On my main RWC page I&#x27;ve got links to many other cubers RWC pages so 
you&#x27;ll easily be able to find lots of pics from everyone. :)

Re other methods, the discussion has recently centred around the &quot;ZB 
method&quot;. Ron van Bruchem and Zbigniew Zborowski both independently 
came up with the idea, hence it&#x27;s now referred to as the ZB method. 
If you look at the posts from the last week you&#x27;ll find heaps of 
discussion about this. The key element of the ZB method is that you 
insert 3 of the 4 corner+edge pairs in the F2L, then insert the 4th 
corner+edge pair *and* orient the LL edges at the same time.

>From what I&#x27;ve read so far, the ZB method sounds very interesting. 
However, I&#x27;m currently working on moving to a 3-look LL, so for now 
I&#x27;m just going to focus on learning the rest of the PLL algs!

          <div class="email-content">Some good advice there Michiel. :)

My two main reasons for going to RWC were (i) meet all you wonderful 
cubers and (ii) have fun! As a result, I wasn&#x27;t especially nervous, 
however, I&#x27;m sure I would have been if I had been a serious contender 
for anything. My personal aims were just to achieve good personal 
times, even if those times were *way* behind the top cubers. :) And 
it also meant a lot to me that my fiance, Peter, was with me. :)

          <div class="email-content">Last weekend I was in Melbourne (Australia) visiting a friend. We <br>
went to a cafe where all the waiters/waitresses were wearing black t-<br>
shirts with various images on them. One of them had Rubik&#x27;s cubes on <br>
it. As you can imagine, I was pretty excited when I saw this. :)<br>
<br>
When we were ordering, I asked another waiter if the waitress with <br>
the cube t-shirt could solve the cube. Turns out that she wasn&#x27;t a <br>
cuber. I mentioned that I was and this is why I had been so excited <br>
by the t-shirt.<br>
<br>
My friend then told them that I had just been to RWC. Then, I asked <br>
them if they wanted a demo (I&#x27;m always keen to seize any opportunity <br>
to promote cubing!) and reached over to grab my cube out of my bag. <br>
<br>
They were very surprised that I just happened to have a cube with me. <br>
I told them that all speedcubers carry cubes with them. ;) They <br>
scrambled it for me, and I did a slow solve (65 seconds -- my current <br>
average is 50-55s). By this point, quite a few of the cafe staff had <br>
crowded around our table to watch. They were all very impressed by <br>
the 65s, but I told them it was too slow and got them to scramble <br>
again. The next solve I did 45s, which I was happy with since it&#x27;s <br>
faster than my current average. The waitress with the cube t-shirt <br>
was so impressed that she then gave me her t-shirt!!<br>
<br>
After dinner, my friend and I went to say goodbye to the waitress. <br>
She said she was inspired to learn the cube now and asked me where <br>
she could buy one. I told her and also wrote down some useful cube <br>
websites. :) It was a fun night. :)<br>

It happens to me nearly all the time. Like some others here, I do <br>
close-up magic, and whenever I show something (even if it is just to <br>
one other person) my hands tremble as if I&#x27;m a hundred years old. It <br>
doesn&#x27;t affect my technique much, but it is somewhat distracting. <br>
When cubing it only happens when I&#x27;m trying to show someone a fast <br>
(for me) solve. I think it is due to the adrenaline rush from having <br>
to do a performance, rather than nervousness or fear of failure.<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; This interesting idea is all but new.<br>
<br>
I have been doing this kind of method for about 4 years, ever since I <br>
first glanced Lars&#x27;s site, without looking at its details. I thought <br>
he was doing the edge orientations after solving all but one corner-<br>
edge pair. Since then I&#x27;ve been doing this:<br>
<br>
1. cross<br>
2. 3 corner-edge pairs<br>
3. orient edges<br>
4. last corner-edge pair using turns of only 2 faces<br>
5. last layer in 3 steps.<br>
<br>
I showed this to Ron a few years ago the first few times I met him. <br>
What is new about the ZB method is that the two steps I&#x27;ve numbered 3 <br>
and 4 are combined.<br>
<br>
For me it is far too much work to learn all the move sequences for <br>
this combined step, but I think I might learn a few special cases.<br>
<br>
If I want to get faster, it is more of a priority to get my <br>
recognition time of corner-edge pairs down. Two days ago I set my <br>
personal best at 40 seconds. It was a non-lucky time, but it was <br>
simply the case that the corner-edge pairs were immediately easy to <br>
spot. My usual time at the moment is 55-75 seconds.<br>

I&#x27;m dead serious. Ever since I recently started cubing in public 
lots of cute girls have started talking to me. Or maybe I&#x27;m just 
sexy and those shy ladies finally found an excuse to do it?

Stefan

haha. you are right. the cube is a chick magnet. i am in college and everyone talks to me. i guess it is just a great conversation starter. especially when they see u not looking at it for the last 5 seconds of solving it. and i am sure the ladies love to see how fast ur fingers can move

Andy C &lt;rubiks1938@...> wrote:I think that it&#x27;s also a good thing to make yourself as nervous as possible 
when training, but not when you&#x27;re at the competition.

I went to a summer camp for six weeks, and after that, I had two weeks before 
going to the WC. At camp, I practiced dozens of times each day in front of 
people. Sometimes there were 5 people watching, other times there were 20, 
but usually as people noticed me turning the cube so fast, they came over to 
watch and soon there were over 30 or 40 people watching! The best part 
about the camp was that there was a talent show toward the end of each 
session, and every student and most of the staff would be there watching. 
That comes out to around 600-700 people in the audience. Since I went to the 
camp for both sessions, I got to perform twice on stage under lots of pressure. 
First session I got 18.3 seconds, and 2nd session I got 19 seconds.

I felt that putting myself under high-pressure situations paid off. Even though 
my fastest time in the competition wasn&#x27;t close to my average at the time (time 
was 19.38 s, and my avg. then was 16.3) my studio cube wasn&#x27;t working the 
way I wanted it to (one of the faces was too loose), so I had to use one of the 
rubiks.com cubes  they provided (or whatever brand they were) and that 
slowed me down some since I wasn&#x27;t used to using a stiffer cube.

I think that at the competition, you should always try to think of the event as 
&quot;fun&quot; and not &quot;I&#x27;m here to be competitive.&quot; However, before the competition 
you must expose yourself to as much pressure as possible. I recently found a 
great way to do this. All you need is about 5-10 people watching you, but 
while you&#x27;re solving, have them say stuff like &quot;you suck&quot; &quot;you&#x27;re going slower&quot; 
&quot;you can&#x27;t solve the cube&quot; and other random stuff. I got very nervous once 
when I had some friends do that and got around 25 seconds. This may not 
seem to be helpful, but you will notice that your hands shake a lot when you 
get some people to say those things to you while solving, and also it&#x27;s harder 
to concentrate, so over time, the shake will go away, you&#x27;ll be able to block out 
the distractions in order to concentrate, and you be much faster.

nice enough to let you know: Doing L2B2R2F2 three times will result <br>
in the pattern I call XX and you&#x27;ll easily see why I do.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s of course boring, but you can execute these moves without <br>
changing the grip at all. For this, put your right thumb at the U <br>
center and your right middle finger at the D center. Then place your <br>
left middle finger on top of the ULF corner and your left thumb <br>
below the BLF corner. Now execute the sequence without ever changing <br>
on which stickers your fingers are. Of course the cube as a whole <br>
will be rotated during the process.<br>
<br>
You can also do it in different ways, depending on the direction of <br>
the half turns. If I say A for anticlockwise and C for clockwise <br>
then for wild turning I&#x27;d recommend AACCAACCAACC while ACACACACACAC <br>
looks less interesting.<br>

The talent show was not &quot;competitive&quot; so they weren&#x27;t judging the best acts <br>
and the worst acts.... But mostly everyone at the camp already knew who I <br>
was and what I was going to do on stage so when my name was announced <br>
they all started cheering. I was behind the curtain and the I couldn&#x27;t even hear <br>
the emcee talking into the microphone because the cheering was so loud. <br>
Eventually they all shut up (which was good, since I wanted to solve the cube, <br>
not listen to people clap). I had the same result when I left the stage: everyone <br>
was cheering so that you couldn&#x27;t hear anything else. I did it in 18.3 seconds. <br>
Here is a link to a picture:<br>

The person to my right was timing me. The text below the picture has three <br>

permutation itself does not require an algorithm :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I like to count the PLL as 21, just because each
algorithm needs to be learned seperately, and executed
distinctively.  Not everyone can mirror an alg right
on the spot...not many people that i know can
especially for longer permutations.  Anyway...that&#x27;s
not important to my point.  

I am no &#x27;cube master&#x27;, although the books from the 80s
would say I am :P.  It is important when learning your
PLL to learn fast algs, not just ones that are easy to
remember.  When I first learned PLL I chose my algs
poorly, and I paid dearly, because I had to re-learn
over half of them.  The difference between a poor
permutation LL and a good one can mean seconds!

When picking an PLL alg, or any alg for that matter:
*Pick an alg with triggers in it (ex: (R U R&#x27;) (R U&#x27;)
etc. etc.)  
*Don&#x27;t pick algs that involve too much repositioning
your non-turning hand. 
*If your PLL alg is taking over 4 seconds to execute
you need to work on getting it down or find a better
one.  
did I miss anything? prolly...but i hope this helps
some of you.

here are a few tips to get noticed when cubing in public

* make sure your facing as many people in the room as possible 
(location, location, location!)
*if your at a table make sure to keep the cube up so people can see 
the cube
*dont sit too still, make some arm movements so people will notice 
and look
*when your done with a solve sit the cube on the table and take a 
drink of water or something, so if someone is watching they will 
realize the cube is solved (alot of times if you mix the cube right 
after you solve it people wont notice it was ever solved)
* eye contact! if you notice someone watching you look at them a 
couple times during the solve and make sure to hold the cube up and 
show them after the solve....

theres more, but thats about all i can think of right now..

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s nice from time to time when people ask intelligent questions 
about the cube, or give ya the praise ;).  HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve lately grown 
tired of the standards:

&quot;I used to just peal the stickers off.&quot;  I know we&#x27;re all sick of it.

&quot;So do you have a system?&quot;  Most people get a simple, &quot;Yes, I break 
it up into smaller steps.&quot;  but if someone is really interested (some 
guys I&#x27;ve run into in the math building at college for example) I&#x27;ll 
give them a full explanation and a few websites.  I recently typed up 
a whole solution for a girl who asked about it.  THOSE people are 
refreshing :)

&quot;Have you ever solved that?&quot;  To which I reply &quot;Yeah, once or twice.&quot;

Actually though, just two days ago, I was sitting in a halway cubing, 
timing on my calculator, when after about 20 solves, I stopped to 
take a drink from my bottle of water.  This girl who had been sitting 
across from me the WHOLE TIME said to me while I was holding a SOLVED 
cube, &quot;Have you ever solved that?&quot;  And I just held it up... she 
seemed thoroughly confused.

But anyway, most of the time, I like the attention, and most of the 
time I don&#x27;t mind answering people&#x27;s questions.  And I always try to 
refer people to www.rubiks.dk to see the &quot;really fast guys.&quot;

But, I&#x27;ve never won a t-shirt. Damn.  ;)

Dude, that&#x27;s easy! Just bring it with you and cube during the break <br>
if you have one. Or be there 10 minutes before class and start <br>
cubing. Somebody will notice and talk to you about it (especially if <br>
you don&#x27;t sit in a corner and if you don&#x27;t only stare at the cube <br>
the whole time but look around while cubing and if you stop shortly <br>

way :-)<br>

Happy cubing,

Yo guyz...<br>
Ok, here&#x27;s the facts:<br>
--Someone from my school brought a puzzle that&#x27;s pretty cool.  It&#x27;s not a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, but it&#x27;s globe with only the middle edges turning to north-south and east-west.  2 hemispheres can be solved rather easily, but I&#x27;m afraid I need some algs from a gliding cube to solve the rest?  Also, Ton, do you know which puzzle this is?<br>

Sounds a bit plagiarized (except 7000 taking the place of 120):

&quot;Ideal Toy Company stated on the package of the original Rubik&#x27;s 
cube that there were more than 3 billion possible states the cube 
could attain. This is analogous to McDonald&#x27;s announcing that 
they&#x27;ve sold more than 120 hamburgers. 
-- J.A. Paulos, Innumeracy&quot;

I&#x27;m curious as to why you chose to use McDonald&#x27;s and burgers in the 
quick math that you did and how you estimated the number of burgers 
they had sold.

          <div class="email-content">Oh, hehe, I hadn&#x27;t seen that before.  My girlfriend and her friend 
were over here and I was trying to find a way to describe to them how 
gross an underestimate that was (they&#x27;re NOT math people).  McDonalds 
was the only thing I could think of that has anywhere near a huge 
number of things that people are familiar with.  And on this website: 
http://www.media.mcdonalds.com/secured/company/history/timeline/ it 
says in 1993, they hit the 95 billionth hamburger mark, so by now I 
assume they&#x27;re up around 100 billion.  So I took (3billion/4.3x10^19)
*100 billion, and got 7000 ish.  Did I make an arithmetical mistake?

Sorry if this comparison has been made before, I honestly hadn&#x27;t seen 
it.  Just thought it was an interesting fact...

          <div class="email-content">Hi All, <br>
<br>
I just arranged and uploaded my soliving videos at final of WC2003. <br>
Katsu videotaped and made DVD. (Thanks Katsu)<br>
I made wmv files from the DVD. <br>
He allows me to put videos of my solving 4x4 and 5x5 on my site. <br>
Now they are ready. <br>
So have fun! <br>
Especially, for those who could not join the WC. <br>

<br>
Sooner or later, Katsu may also upload his solving videos. <br>

paint the cube white, then put the stickers on. That would actually 
look pretty cool....
Or you could live with it, even though it does get annoying.

<br>
The FMC is back and has completed one full week of competition all <br>
ready! It&#x27;s back in full force, there are many great solutions, and <br>
lots can be learnt from these guys about how to solve cubes in the <br>
fewest moves possible.<br>
<br>
Just go to www.cubestation.co.uk , and follow the starred link at <br>
the top!<br>
<br>
I will launch a new challenge shortly<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who took part, and I hope we can get even more <br>
participants for the 31/10/03 FMC!<br>
<br>
Keep on cubing! DanH :) - www.cubestation.co.uk<br>

There is the link. He claims these are the best cubes for speed <br>

them?<br>
<br>
What do you think are the best cubes in your experience?<br>
<br>
Also the site mentions the newest cubes from rubiks.com having vinel <br>

the studio cubes are the best in my opinion.  

the rubiks.com stickers aren&#x27;t as good as the studio cubes.....

          <div class="email-content">The studio cubes are definitely the best cubes you can buy. The 
rubiks.com cubes work, but they have terrrrrible stickers and no 
screws to adjust the tension.

dedicated a portion of my website to it:<br>
http://www.geocities.com/rubiks_galaxia/RPmethod.html<br>
Put your mouse over it to get a brief description of whats going on.  <br>
In my haste I haven&#x27;t had a chance to make a quality description...so <br>
please forgive me.  In the end you are left with 70 possible 1-look <br>

different possible orientations...hence...70 1 look algs.  <br>
1. Cross (intuitive)<br>
2. 3 c/e pairs, leaving an empty c/e slot (intuitive)<br>
3. you&#x27;ll make a 2x2x1 block opposite of your empty c/e slot. <br>
(intuitive) <br>
*This will leave you with 7 unpositioned pieces on your cube.  <br>
4. insert last corner/edge pair without ruining the 2x2x1 block you <br>
made in step 3. (I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll need to make algs for this)  <br>
*This is the point in which you are left with your last layer to be <br>
done. only 5 pieces left to deal with.  <br>
5. Orient&amp;permute LL! (i&#x27;ll be generating algs for this)<br>

It is definitely possible! Sounds like a good idea. I have trouble 
with taht 2nd to last step (that you said you need algs for) but I 
get it eventually...pretty much trial and error, I just need to 
figure out how to get it on command! Very nice idea.

On second thought...there may be a problem. The 2nd to last step may 
make it a 2 look at the end! Like you said you will need algorithms, 
and I doubt they will be too small. So you will have well over 70 
algs and still have 2 looks at the end. I&#x27;ll try to figure out the 
different combinations for that step anyway. ;)

the cube themselves. For example, Yasmara (Michiel van der Blonk&#x27;s <br>

cubing family members became interested in learning the cube. Is it <br>
that they wanted to find out what all the fuss was with their puzzle-<br>

and so thought they&#x27;d give it a go? :)<br>

I&#x27;ve certainly been offering to teach Peter (my fiance), but as he&#x27;s <br>
still in the US (and I&#x27;m back in Australia) it hasn&#x27;t quite happened <br>

          <div class="email-content">seems like everything is thought up :( lol.
after some thought i&#x27;ve decided on learning it anyway
as follows:

step 1.)typical fridrichs f2l 
*except for last c/e slot
step 2.)2x2x1 block bottom layer 
*as long as you don&#x27;t break this up, doesn&#x27;t matter
how you go about doing your business.
step 3.) insert last f2l pair 
*can&#x27;t break up the block!
step 4.)orient/permute all

I was thinking how long it will take for each step. i
figured:
step 1: 8.0-9.0 seconds
step 2: 2.5-3.0 seconds
step 3: 2.5-3.0 seconds
step 4: 3.0-3.5 seconds 
total: 16.0-18.5 seconds
i think these are at least semi realistic estimates

So while the idea was brought up already, my approach
seems to be a bit different.  And another difference
is, I&#x27;ll actually be following through with it...I had
some confusion about the math for it, but after all it
is 107 LL algs to learn.  The last c/e pair is also to
be a pain...most likely involving a slew of
algs...I&#x27;ll be doing my best to organize this solution
for anyone who is interested.  Since I&#x27;m going to
&#x27;publish&#x27; this method on my site I think it deserves
an appropriate name...suggestions anyone?

i&#x27;ll decide when i&#x27;m finished whether it was practical
or not. ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hello!<br>
<br>
First, i&#x27;m a french student so excuse my bad English ; i just hope <br>
you&#x27;ll understand me ! :)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve done several functions in CAML (it is a Fench programming <br>
language: see http://caml.inria.fr/ for English support) about the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube ; one of my aim was to know how positions where reached <br>
in n moves exactly (not in less).<br>
I call a move a single quarter turn of one of the 6 faces of the <br>
cube. My computer has got 512 MO of RAM and has a P4-  1,4GHz <br>
Pentium Processor.<br>
I obtained these results in 50 hours of CPU time:<br>
n     pos(n)<br>
0     1<br>
1     12<br>
2     114<br>
3     1,068<br>
4     10,011<br>
5     93,840<br>
6     878,880<br>
7     8,221,632<br>
8     76,843,595<br>
9     717,789,576<br>
<br>
For n=10, with my method, it would take almost a month...<br>
<br>
I used a soft data compression process and several tips, but <br>
basically, my functions use the force of the computer (i don&#x27;t use <br>
IA algorithms like IDA*).<br>
<br>
I made a program to generate isomorphic classes of a position (i <br>
call isomorph of a position a position that is symmetrical, inverse <br>
or the same but with an other orientation of the cube...).<br>
To do this, i used the principe of conjugaison in a group.<br>
I want to know how other people did to generate the positions <br>
isomorphic to another? (according to my definition, a position has <br>
got less or equal than 96 isomorphic positions, including itself!). <br>
Also, a random position (randomly choosen not with random moves, <br>
each position has the same probability to be chosen) has exactly 96 <br>
isomorphic positions (what is not surprising of course).<br>
<br>
I hope someone would be interested in this work ; if someone already <br>
did it, i would be really interested to contact him!<br>
<br>
Least, considering the positions who are there one isomorph position <br>
could help if we assume that there is only one antipode for the <br>
3x3x3 Cube (there are only 8 of such positions, the identity, the <br>
superflip, the Pont Asinum and others). Of course, if the antipode <br>
is not single (what i believe), it won&#x27;t help...<br>

recieved a virus myself from someone i know... MYSELF!!!!  I have <br>
two yahoo accounts and i sometimes send emails from one account to <br>

recieved anything like that under my other account.  I have also <br>
been checking my computer for viruses quite frequently over the big <br>
bout that exploaded a couple weeks ago.  Don&#x27;t worry guys, i dealt <br>
with the matter in a calm way, and i sent the person who &quot;sent&quot; me <br>
the virus an email saying <br>
&quot;i got a virus and it was sent from you.&quot;  <br>
jake<br>

I checked my other account and found the message and i replied, <br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry, I would never send you a virus.  Theres a lot of weird <br>
stuff floatting around but i am sorry and i will scan my computer to <br>
see if there are any viruses present.&quot;<br>
<br>
jake<br>
<br>
So i had my computer screened or whatever, its clean... no dirty <br>
sickies lingering anywhere.  <br>
So I checked my other email and after reading the reply i responded:<br>
<br>
&quot;Don&#x27;t worry Jake, It didn&#x27;t do any harm to my computer because i <br>
scanned the email before i opened it.  I always do that regardless <br>
who sent it to me, because sometimes an unintentional virus is sent <br>
somehow.  Either way, good luck with cubing!&quot;<br>

I went and checked my other account and after reading the message i <br>

Jake<br>

See, maybe i am just insane sending messages back and forth to <br>

Thats the only way to work out a problem.  Blowing up at someone <br>
would not have settled anything, especially in this case...<br>
<br>
But anyway, there were no bugs in my computer anywhere.  SO this <br>
means that someone is hacking in my &quot;oh so dear&quot; yahoo acount, or <br>

I know how to solve it, and I&#x27;m sure at least one other did. There 
were 3 or 4 employees from Kroger who didn&#x27;t know how. We all were 
taught the notation. Dan had to scramble all the 4x4s and 5x5s 
himself because none of the judges knew how.

That makes a lot of sense, but if you weren&#x27;t prepared for it, it can 
be really disorienting.

In the Budapest WC, they didn&#x27;t cover the cubes, so you could keep 
scheming while it lay on the table. Not that I really need(ed) more 
than 5-10 seconds to plan as far ahead as I could use.

          <div class="email-content">Two looks and a 3 cycle:<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m formalising my strategy for the last layer (assuming an F2L that <br>
does not direct the structure of the LL in any way).<br>
<br>
I think of it as a two-and-a-half looks method but that&#x27;s a damn lie <br>
really  its 3 looks but the last is always a simple 3-cycle of <br>
edges.  I&#x27;d be interested if anyone else uses a similar approach <br>
although I know that there are not many people who solve the LL <br>
doing corners then edges.<br>
<br>
Before I summarise it below you might well ask &quot;why?&quot;.  After all <br>
its 3 looks not 2 and it averages between 25 and 30 moves (I <br>
understand others do more like 22).  The main advantages are:<br>
1.	There aren&#x27;t many algorithms to learn (pessimistically up to <br>
30 although I think its more like 20 or less)<br>
2.	Many of the algorithms are what I would call &quot;intuitive&quot;  3-<br>
cycles and 2-pair swaps using conjugation.  At least they seem <br>
intuitive to me but then they are all &quot;hand-made&quot;  that is invented <br>
by me using common sense principles.  Of course this means that <br>
there may be more efficient algorithms to do it using the same <br>
strategy.<br>
3.	I don&#x27;t think the &quot;looks&quot; are very hard to &quot;see&quot;!  Of course <br>
the last look is pretty trivial.<br>
4.	Its an interesting hybrid  I suspect that it might be an <br>
easier stepping stone to the 2-look for some people.<br>
<br>
General 2 and 3 LL Strategy:<br>
1.	Orient corners ensuring that at least one edge is unflipped. <br>
(Up to 12 algorithms here probably a lot less).<br>
2.	Position corners and position one unflipped edge.  (Maybe 4 <br>
or 5 algorithms).<br>
3.	Finish with a 3-cycle of edges. (3 algorithms).<br>
<br>
The eagle-eyed will spot some possibilities that don&#x27;t fit.<br>
Q1. What if corners are already oriented and all edges are flipped?<br>
A1.  Position corners; finish with 2 3-cycles of edges. (still 2 <br>
looks and a 3-cycle).<br>
Q2. If the corners are properly positioned then you can&#x27;t arrange to <br>
finish Q1 with 2 3-cycles if the edges are flipped but properly <br>
positioned can you?<br>
A2.  One extra algorithm for flipping all 4 edges in their proper <br>
positions (my best algorithm for this is 22 moves!).<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t done a proper mathematical count of the number of <br>
algorithms required and I haven&#x27;t systematically worked out the <br>
average or range of numbers of moves required to solve but I think <br>
30 algorithms and 30 moves are both very, very pessimistic.  I do <br>
intend to work it all out properly for my own peace of mind <br>
eventually but if I&#x27;ve reinvented the wheel and anyone else already <br>
knows all this do let me know!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi

After a year of almost constant cubing and after giving up trying to 
get her interested in the cube, she suddenly said: &#x27;OK, teach me now&#x27;.

An important aspect of this was that I told her that anyone could do 
it, and that she needed to learn just a couple of alg&#x27;s and it would 
probably take 3 to 4 days and a little practice to be able to do it 
without the alg&#x27;s on hand.

Of course real speedcubing takes a lot more dedication, and up to now 
that is a far fetched dream. She stopped practicing after reaching 
the 1.30 barrier, and she might take it up when there is a new 
championship.

I myself am at a best average of about 23 seconds, and I have to say 
it gets harder and harder to beat seconds. Ans Jasmine, how about 
both getting a webcam? That would make things a lot easier! Ans you 
get to see each other once in a while.

          <div class="email-content">First, a bit of background about myself.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been a casual cuber since the early 80&#x27;s.  My method of solving the cube was learned from a book, and is quite basic:<br>
<br>
- Solve the top layer (~25 moves)<br>
<br>
- Use a simple algorithm to get all middle layer cubes in place (~25 moves)<br>
<br>
For the last layer, I flip the cube.  Then I<br>
<br>
- Permute the edges<br>
<br>
- Permute the corners<br>
<br>
- Orient the corners<br>
<br>
- Orient the edges.<br>
<br>
I use 5 algorithms (not including inverses which I sometimes use).  It takes me about 50 moves to solve the last layer, and the total solve time is around 110 secs.<br>
<br>
I would like to learn a new method to slash my solve times at least in half.  I have had a look at a few web sites mentioned in this group (speedcubing.com for example), and find the methods, terminology, and number of algorithms intimidating.  Most posts on this group are way above my head.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t believe I could handily retain huge numbers of algorithms.  I guess I would like a method which gives the best &quot;bang for the buck&quot; and minimizes the number of algorithms.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Scott, the method I recommend is possible to get to about 55 
seconds average with a lot of work.  If you really work hard you can 
get sub-50, but it would probably be more efficient to learn a 
faster method if you want times around sub-50.  There are more 
advanced versions of this method, which several people on this group 
use, so you wouldn&#x27;t be without help from others to find ways to 
improve.  The method is Mark Jeay&#x27;s 2nd solution at  
http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm#sol2

In terms of &quot;bang for the buck&quot; this method is great since it is 
overall very intuitive.  There are 3 algorithms you have to learn to 
finish the first two layers, and an algorithm and its inverse to 
learn to rotate the corners.  Since you already rotate corners you 
won&#x27;t have to learn that, so the count is 3 algorithms.  With some 
careful thought over the algorithms they will make sense after 
several reptitions and eventually, after solving with this method 
for a while, they become intuitive as well.  Anyway this method 
works as follows,

1) Solve cross on 1st face (I prefer bottom when using this method)
2) Solve 3 corners of 1st face
3) Use empty corner to place 3 edges of the first two layers (This 
is a simple sequence described on the website and is much faster 
than using an algorithm.  This step is very intuitive.)
4) Orient and place the edges of the top layer and last middle edge 
(this step uses three algorithms to finish off the last two edges, 
though as mentioned earlier they can be understood with some 
practice and repetition.)
5) place all remaining corners (LL corners and the remaing unsolved 
one from the first layer).  This step also uses a simple sequence 
described on the website and is very intuitive.
6) orient corners

There are several people here who use a similar approach, though 
from what I hear I think Mark Jeays&#x27; version might be a little more 
rigid.  I think most people have more advanced practice on step 4, 
and perhaps 5 also, but the method as described on Mark&#x27;s site is 
very easy to learn.  I taught a friend of mine this method and he 
averages around 1:10 to 1:00 with a personal best time of 49 seconds 
last I talked with him.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is the time range you 
are looking for, as methods with a more traditional layer-by-layer 
approach can be slightly faster than this, however in terms of 
fewest number of algs learned for the time it will let you achieve I 
think this method is great.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">I gues not everybody knows me.

I am currently the only one selling the Rubik&#x27;s Studio cubes, I can 
offer them at a low price, because the Rubik&#x27;s Studio was so kind to 
make them available for the speedcubing community via me. I gues I 
was selected because I already provided cubes to many of the top 
speedcubers. So I am realy proud that I actually do bussines with The 
Rubik&#x27;s Studio directly! I actually have a signed invoice from MR 
Erno Rubik!

About the current and future Rubiks.com, I also have contact with 
SevenTowns and I have seen the new prototype Rubik&#x27;s.com. It has 
great stickers, it is more like a fused plastic cover. So in the near 
future the Rubiks.com cube has some major improvements. 

However the advantage of the Rubik&#x27;s studio cubes is that you can 
adjust the tension. But still if you are lucky the Rubik&#x27;s.com cube 
works fine, like the one provided at the WC2003.

          <div class="email-content">Hi

Actually, Scott, there is not a lot to learn.

First, buy or make yourself a perfectly smooth turning cube. Very 
important is that you have to be able to &#x27;cut corners&#x27;. This means, 
that when you make for instance an R turn for 90%, then perform U&#x27;, 
the cube shouldn&#x27;t &#x27;block&#x27; the move. Some amazing cubes can even 
perform the second move when the first one is at 60-70%. You will see 
quite a gap arise as you turn and look inside your cube. This is not 
very healthy for your cube, and it will wear out one day. No pain, no 
gain, alas. Furthermore, your cube should be well-lubed, preferably 
by a silicon based spray. I used to use body lotion myself, and that 
worked too, but it is not very good for your cube, and the inside 
becomes a black greasy smudge. Have a look at Ton&#x27;s page at 
speedcubing.com and read the manual.

The fast speedcubers use these moves and call it a finger trick or 
trigger. Using this you can perform more than 1 move (2, 3 even 4) as 
if it is 1 move.

An important aspect of these tricks is the grip. You should be 
comfortable performing your algs in the most natural grip. You can 
split up your own algs in your own preferred tricks. So, an 8 move 
alg could be converted in 4 tricks for example.

So, you probably get the idea of what I am to suggest. Use these 
tricks and you are on your way. No algorithms needed. This should get 
you under one minute. After that, you can probably get to 40-45 
seconds, and then it gets real hard to improve more.

By that time, start learning alg&#x27;s, there is no other way.


Dan Knights has some explanation and video&#x27;s of this
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/CubeInfo.html
or look at
http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/PetersCubePage.html 

Hope that helps

   I am learning how to speedcube. If all goes well I&#x27;d like to 
compete at the 2005 championships. Right now I use a simple layer by 
layer method that I pieced together from a couple of sites. I am 
learning the Fridrich method LL algs right now.

from every possible angle&quot;

this would be a great time for people to share there f2l tips
my tips are

1.learn the standard 41 f2l but understand how and why they work not 
just the sequeneces. this will also make it easier too remember
and keep your f2l&#x27;s down too using 2 faces R,U or F,U. 

2.Learn too use your right and left handed and also learn the 
reverse and mirror of the f2l so you don&#x27;t have too turn the cube as 
much.

4.Reconize the Patterns my the colors they make on top, that way 
when your doing a reverse sided f2l you don&#x27;t have too always  peak 
over the back side to figure what it is

3.Understand Non Standard F2L, learn all the f2L&#x27;s where 2 pieces 
are in the wrong places,and other short cuts when thers an open 
layer because it will still take around 7- 8 moves to insert 
sometimes even less. and will greatly decrease your Cross too f2l

4.if you have too insert a block thats on the reverse side you 
normally would turn the cube on the X turn it on the Y and and 
insert, this always you too get an overview of the cube and allow 
you too see your next move

hmm anymore people?

Hi, I think that what you say is totally wrong :-)<br>
<br>
You say &quot;learn the standard 41 f2l but understand how and why they work not<br>
<br>
just the sequeneces. this will also make it easier too remember<br>
<br>
and keep your f2l&#x27;s down too using 2 faces R,U or F,U. &quot; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <br>
enough to understand what the alg do. I never learn any &quot;alg&quot; for F2L. They <br>
came to me naturally.It&#x27;s hard to explain. When you say &quot;Reconize the <br>
Patterns &quot;, for me, there is no patterns.I have 2 blocks, then I have to <br>
assemble it then insert.I don&#x27;t recognize &quot;patterns&quot; like you say.<br>
<br>
I think speedcubists shouldn&#x27;t learn F2L &quot;alg&quot; (I know that A.caman learned <br>
this and maybe others). I improved my times faster other cubists because I <br>
didn&#x27;t learn this algs. (Yes A caman improved too really fast but this is an <br>
excetpion) Adam Gehin improved his times better because he didn&#x27;t learn this <br>
F2L algs.<br>

SOrry for my really bad english,<br>

&gt;getting lots of times that I normally only get two or three times a day. So <br>
&gt;anyway for those like me who are slow to<br>
pick<br>
&gt;up on the tricks of getting fast, I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is <br>
&gt;to try to really, really only do RUL (or d or d&#x27;) turns when solving the <br>
&gt;F2L. Also try to only rotate the cube whenever you have to do lots of B or <br>
&gt;F turns, and rotate the cube<br>
so<br>
&gt;the B face becomes the L or R face, then continue doing the alg. Rotate <br>
&gt;only to place the B or F face on R or L when you have<br>
several<br>
&gt;B or F turns coming up. I know you fast people already do this,<br>
but<br>
&gt;I just discovered the value of it and I want to try to emphasize<br>
to<br>
&gt;everyone that it really works.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;My two cents. Sorry for the preaching but I hope it helps, Chris<br>

   There&#x27;s a thing called &quot;spoofing&quot; where the address of the one
sending the email is false. Some viruses spoof. 
   That email virus you got came probably came from a virus that found
*both* of your email addresses in someone else&#x27;s address book.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   I use FRB and RFL the way you use LUR. And I use it for both the
F2L and the LL. There&#x27;s a whole &quot;family&quot; of algorithms which work
easily that way.

   Sometimes stopping and looking at portions of the solve that I
haven&#x27;t been working on have resulted in gains of seconds at a time.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been putting a lot of thought into this question.  &quot;How do I <br>
get faster?&quot;<br>
<br>
I average around 26 seconds. This is with pretty much a standard <br>
fridrich&#x27;s f2l, with the exception of a small handful of zb method <br>
algs i&#x27;ve learned.  I also use a 3 look LL.  I refuse to learn the <br>
OLL right now, seems like I could avoid this all together and still <br>
have a speedy LL.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve also been enthusiastic about a method I mentioned previously.  <br>
One that isn&#x27;t of my own mind, but I think I&#x27;m putting more thought <br>
into its &#x27;potential&#x27;. In case anyone missed my description of it:<br>
*standard f2l, except leave an empty c/e slot*<br>
*create 2x2x1 block in LL*<br>
*insert last f2l pair without breaking up the block<br>
*orient/permute all, 1 step.*<br>
I think it has potential...sometimes.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s been mentioned a few times that the best method for being an <br>
extreme fast cuber would end up not being 1 method, but a clash of <br>
many.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m going to learn the 1-look for my recently <br>
mentioned method, and the 1-look for the zb method.  This is <br>
obviously going to be a long term situation, but in the end I will <br>
have had a lot of fun I think.  Not only that, I&#x27;d take pride in <br>
throughly exploring a method no one has b4.  107 algs to learn total <br>
for my *again* recently mentioned method.  I&#x27;m calling it the lucky <br>
107 method...cuz its kind of catchy.  I already know 7 of them...so <br>
only 100 more! lol<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, you use about 100 moves to solve the cube. I would estimate 
that with that method you can get down to under a minute, but you 
need to get a really well lubed cube.
But if you&#x27;re looking for instant results (Do I sound like a 
commercial?), you need to learn a new method. If you first solve the 
entire first layer then you can&#x27;t do anything else without first 
taking apart the first layer. You take it apart, do something, and 
put it back together. And that&#x27;s very inefficient.

And don&#x27;t let the numbers of algorithms intimidate you. It&#x27;s a lot 
easier than it seems to remember 40+. It seems like your brain 
doesn&#x27;t remember them, but your hands do.

Nice idea Louie, but....people have made other forums for &quot;us&quot; to 
all move to cuz they didnt like the adds before.  and it just didnt 
work.  Sure it would be better without the ads, but they aren&#x27;t 
really that bad.  Its a big pain to totally move the forum....so im 
pretty sure its just gonna stay here...
sorry if i come across in a bad way, i just wanted to let you know 
people have tried b4....

          <div class="email-content">well everyone learns in there own way
to me the standerd 41 f2l is just a template it shows people how and 
why things work. when you understand the WHy you have Power. 
I never personally learned them all theres was no need at a certain 
point. but at no cost should you sit there and drill the same 
sequence over and over 
but too get low times your mind eventually memorizes it..a better 
word would be Automizes the situations. so we feel like theres no 
thought because we&#x27;ve done all the thinking already

I&#x27;ve been doing this 7months and my average is 20s and theses are 
the things that helped me. only real problem i&#x27;m having is 
psychological. I have a habit of looking at the clock when i&#x27;m done 
my f2l, and when it says like 9 or 10s i tend too go too fast, lock 
up and get cube jams making me screw up which is anoying

This makes a lot of sense.  I agree that a new set of algorithms with a new approach are in order.

Which system do you recommend?  Be as specific as you can, as there seem to be a few different ones which use 40+ algorithms.

I would recommend learning the F2L for the first 2 layers,
http://www.speedcubing.com/algorithms.html

and Dan K&#x27;s intermediate top layer method for the last layer.
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Intermediate.html

you could also use the keyhole method for the first 2 layers.

i cant find a link to a good description of the key-hole method, but here is
a post that descibes it, and with some more info.
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/4936

This will give you 65+ avg moves i think, and about 8 algs to learn.

i&#x27;ve averaged around 40 sec with a cross, bottom edges, middle edges, 4 look
LL system, and i&#x27;m not a fast cuber, so i think sub 30 sec avg with this
system is possible. with a F2L or key-hole method for the first 2 layers,
you can easily cut a few more seconds, and then it&#x27;s a question if you are
willing to learn more algs to make it a 3 look LL, or even a 2 look LL.

LL = last layer.

          <div class="email-content"><br>
&gt; I average around 26 seconds. This is with pretty much a standard <br>
&gt; fridrich&#x27;s f2l, with the exception of a small handful of zb method <br>
&gt; algs i&#x27;ve learned.  I also use a 3 look LL.  I refuse to learn the <br>
&gt; OLL right now, seems like I could avoid this all together and still <br>
&gt; have a speedy LL.<br>
<br>
I agree! Learning OLL vs Oedges + Ocorners can only gain you 1s <br>
average - maybe 1.5s. When you think that there are (for me at any <br>
rate) 4 seconds to be won just on reducing the time cross+find first <br>
pair (It should be done in 2s - it takes me 6-7s)<br>
 <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ve also been enthusiastic about a method I mentioned previously.  <br>
&gt; One that isn&#x27;t of my own mind, but I think I&#x27;m putting more thought <br>
&gt; into its &#x27;potential&#x27;. In case anyone missed my description of it:<br>
&gt; *standard f2l, except leave an empty c/e slot*<br>
&gt; *create 2x2x1 block in LL*<br>
&gt; *insert last f2l pair without breaking up the block<br>
&gt; *orient/permute all, 1 step.*<br>
&gt; I think it has potential...sometimes.<br>
<br>
I do <br>
<br>
*leave empty corner slot<br>
*orient edges<br>
*fill slot<br>
*orient corners<br>
*permute all<br>
<br>
I sometimes run into a 2x1x1 block. Although with your method, you do <br>
have 3 &quot;slots&quot; you could potentially fill, two of them involve <br>
convoluted &quot;calculations&quot; for working out the orientations of <br>
remaining pieces (especially if you are a quarter turn out...)<br>
<br>
And working on one slot generates very long solutions if you don&#x27;t <br>
want to break up the 2x2x1. (I just tried with ron&#x27;s cube solver: the <br>
2x1x1 block was solved in 6 moves - but it would have taken me ages <br>
to do it intuitively. I aranged it so I could fill any of three <br>
possible slots and there were no solutions of fewer than 9 moves)<br>
<br>
After that, the great thing about your method is the easy <br>
recognition: there are two sets of positions: those with edges <br>
flipped and those with edges orientated<br>
<br>
there are three orientations for the first corner and three for the <br>
second.<br>
<br>
Then there are three positions for the first corner, two for the <br>
second.<br>
<br>
I would prefer a final solution-set which has fewer orientations and <br>
more permutations, for even better recognition.<br>
<br>
I think a different two step solution starting from the 2x1x1 block <br>
could be more promising: something like orient all, then permute <br>
all... Or even all in one go.<br>
<br>
edge orientations: 4 <br>
corner orientations: 27 (ouch)<br>
corner permutations: 24<br>
edge permutations: 3<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not quite sure how I would define orientation though... oh <br>
well... back to the drawing board<br>

far is cross, then corners, then middle layer edges. But I inserted <br>
the first layer corners correctly, which was a pain if the white <br>
sticker was on the yellow face (took me 5 moves to insert it). Now I <br>
insert the corners in any orientation. Actually I insert them with <br>
wrong orientation on purpose! Not only because it allows me to learn <br>
and practice a few new algorithms but because most of the time <br>
they&#x27;re faster than with a correctly oriented corner. So, after <br>
placing the corners you need one of the first 11 algorithms <br>
displayed here:<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l_crossbottom.html<br>
They&#x27;re short, you probably know two of them already and without <br>
mirroring there are ever fewer.<br>
Almost always I get to a15, a15x, a22 or a22x which are all very <br>
easy and fast.<br>

          <div class="email-content">It is possible to get down to 30 secs with a minimum of algs. I have 
best average of 28 and i never memorised heaps of algs. 

First layer is intuitive. When i preinspect the cube i focus on how 
to solve first layer corners. Then when i start that usually the 
edges &quot;fall naturally&quot; i solve them as i spot them.

The middle layer edges only require a few algs. 2 for normal solving 
of one edge (2 didd orientations) and a few that will solve 2 edges 
in one go (3-cycles !!!) or solve one and remove one &quot;bad&quot; edge from 
the middle layer. This requires some practice to master but very few 
algs.

The last layer i solve by 4 looks. Position corners (2 algs). Then 
orient them (3 algs). For the edges i usually orient them first 
unless i spot only a 3-cycle is required. (3-cycles have to 
become &quot;second nature&quot; if u want to be fast w my method.) To orient 
the edges it takes only 2 algs if 2 are wrongly oriented. If all are 
wrongly oriented it&#x27;s either a 4-flip (1 alg to learn) or u apply 2 3-
cycles. After orienting edges when 2 of them were out of orientation 
there is either a 3-cycle(1 alg) or 2 2-cycles (2 algs).

All this doesn&#x27;t add up many algs except some 3-cycles that u won&#x27;t 
have to memorise when u know how they work ;-) Most of them are 
commutators in group theoretical terms :-)

Happy cubing !!

(hmm ... u probably get too many advices, so u not sure where to 
start ... )

If u like the colors those should be ideal!! Of course it might look 
odd at first when the surfaces are so smooth (as i think they will 
be) or maybe they will be more like meffert tiled cubes. Haven&#x27;t seen

odd at first when the surfaces are so smooth (as i think they will 
be) or maybe they will be more like meffert tiled cubes. Haven&#x27;t seen

And i got the corner-twisting # of algs wrong, should be 5 (forgot 
the 2 cases of twisting 2 corners).

So for this u must be able to perform about 3 moves/sec :-)

Good luck! (If u want i can supply the algs, but they are easy to

Terje,

Thanks for your reply.  I&#x27;m a bit confused.  From what I&#x27;ve read the last few days, F2L over at speedcubing.com shows fully 41 algorithms for the F2L alone (codes a01x through b25x).  Add to that the algs I would need to learn to improve on the LL, how do you come up with 8 algs to learn?  Maybe this is just a terminology problem I&#x27;m having.

Scott

At first it looks like the colors are printed on, but these are 
stickers sheets fused to the surface

I do not know if this cube will be released, SevenTowns have more 
ideas for improving the cube, the main question is how much are we 
willing to pay for a special speedcube version?

          <div class="email-content">basically, you take a razor blade and force it into the center cap 
where it is glued on.  do this on all 4 sides of the center cap, 
then start prying the center cap off with the razor blade.  it 
should eventually pop off.

sometimes you get a hard one and you destroy the center cap in 
trying to remove it.  but i have spare cubes and just use a center 
cap off one of these sacraficial lambs if one breaks apart.

to put the center cap back on, most people generally just re-glue 
it.  or, i use a neodymium magnet solution that i posted a while 
back-- this makes so you can get to your screws without having to 
break super-glue each time.

          <div class="email-content">You can roughly say that the proportion in moves is similar to the 
proportion in time. So about 30 moves or a little less is needed for

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Eric Johanson&quot; &lt;ejohanson@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Tue, 04 Nov 2003 22:40:25 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">i use a 2.5 look LL.  actually its a 2 3/4 look LL because 1/4 of <br>
the time i solve LL in 2 looks and the other 3/4 of the time its 3 <br>
look.  i always permute all in one alg/look.  the other 1 3/4 looks <br>
is for orienting.<br>
<br>
case 1: if there are no edges oriented at beginning of LL, then i <br>
use one of 8 algs (including reflections/inversions) to orient <br>
entire LL in one alg, then permute in one more alg for a total of 2 <br>
algs on the LL.  this only happens 1/8 of the time (i.e. no edges <br>
oriented at start of LL).<br>
<br>
case 2: if all 4 edges are oriented at beginning of LL, then i use <br>
one of 7 algs (including reflections/inversions) to orient LL <br>
corners in one alg, then permute all in one more alg for a total of <br>
2 algs on the LL.  this only happens 1/8 of the time (i.e. all edges <br>
oriented at start of LL).<br>
<br>
case 3: if 2 edges are oriented at beginneing of LL, then i use one <br>
of 2 algs to orient the remaining 2 edges.  the cube then reduces <br>
back to case 2 and i proceed from there resulting in a total of 3 <br>
algs for the LL.  this happens 3/4 times (i.e. 2 edges oriented at <br>
start of LL).<br>
<br>
this may sound confusing but it means i can orient the LL in one alg <br>
1/4 of the time and in 2 algs 3/4 of the time.  and, when it&#x27;s a 2 <br>
alg orientation (2 edges oriented correctly at start of LL), both of <br>
the two algs are pretty quick and short (averaging 6 moves and 8 <br>
moves respectively).<br>
<br>
with this system you only need to learn a total of 17 orientation <br>
algs (this 17 *includes* reflections and inversions) and you can <br>
then orient the LL in a weighted-average of about 13 moves.<br>
<br>
with the standard 2-look LL (1-look OLL) you have to learn 57 OLL <br>
algs and you can orient the LL in an average of about 9 moves.  if <br>
you compare this to my method, you&#x27;re learning 40 additional algs to <br>
shave only 4 moves off your OLL.<br>

          <div class="email-content">practically a standard three look if not for your *no
edges flipped up* orientations.  At any rate, if you
don&#x27;t want to learn 57 algs, your way is probably
good.  Then again I don&#x27;t think the number of algs is
what is so horrible...It&#x27;s really just the time it
takes to learn them.  If you can take the effort to
learn PLL and 17 other orientation algs, then you
definetly have the capacity for a whole 2-look. 
*shrugs*  just the way i see it.

thought to call it that, hehehe.. I intend to slowly work my way down 
to the 2 look ll.  I had a 3 look, now I&#x27;m learning the 8 no 
orientation algs, then I&#x27;ll learn the 15 (i think) algs for when two 
opposite edges are already oriented, then the 28 or so algorithms for 
when two adjacent edges are already oriented.  Just my plan... I 
don&#x27;t know why i felt the need to share it... who are you people?

much worse before I started cubing and they have increased dramatically

          <div class="email-content">I have many people say to me, &quot;Wow! You must be a genius to solve 
that thing!&quot;  and my response ends up being, &quot;No, I solve that thing, 
which has helped me get one step closer to being a genius.&quot;  The cube 
is a great tool for increasing your brain power (or at least 
stimulating it).

Things learned from cubing:
1) Finger dexterity - The comment &quot;How do you move it so fast?&quot; is 
heard quite often.  My fingers have become quite dexterous due to 
cubing.

2) Memorization - I have learned many different techniques of 
memorization from cubing, and I integrate different devices in each 
step.  These techniques can be applied in other aspects of life.

3) Pattern recognition - I was always amazed at how quickly the fast 
cubers could see which algorithms to use, especially for the LL.  
Since I&#x27;ve started to learn them, I can see them a lot quicker now, 
and the idea isn&#x27;t as farfetched.

4) Spatial thinking - Ask any cuber to move cubie X into position Y 
and they will be able to do it in a heartbeat.  Being able to 
manipulate a 3D object to such a vast degree contributes so much to 
spatial thinking in other areas.

5) Thinking outside the box - I remember looking at a cube before 
being able to solve thinking, &quot;Even if I get this whole side white, 
I&#x27;ll mess it up if I try to get another side.&quot;  I still remember the 
day I made the realization that they are 8 corner cubies, 12 edge 
cubies, and 6 center cubies rather than 54 individual stickers.  It 
made a world of difference in my way of viewing the cube.

6) Individual style - Everyone does the cube differently, even if 
they know the same method.  No one style is best for me except my own.

Just a few things I&#x27;ve picked up from the cube.  I&#x27;d like to hear 
what others have to say on this as well.

          <div class="email-content">I agree, there is so much that can be gained from speedcubing.

Yeah I use an avegage of 110 moves and was avging 45 secs with my 
good cube.  I use the method from the simple soulution to the rubik&#x27;s 
cube a book from the 80&#x27;s.I have thrown in a few other algs from the 
Fridrich method for special cases but i wish i hadnt learned it 
because i want to learn the fridrich method but its hard since ive 
been using only about 15 algs for over a year.

enough for memorization. I can memorize numbers over a long period 
of time, so give me a day to memorize the cube and I can solve it 
blindfolded in a week.
And last time I played chess was when I average five minutes on the 
cube, and I sucked. It would be very interesting to see how/if I&#x27;ve 
improved.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Scott

I dont use any algs for the F2L. The F2L is just about finding the matching
corner / edge pair and insert it, it&#x27;s quite a straight forward job, and
quite intuitive. Many like me dont use algs for the F2L, or use their own
algs, including thomas templier that&#x27;s on the top of the 3x3 avg leaderboard
at the moment on speedcubing.com.

The reason for the link was to show what i meant with the F2L.

Terje,

Thanks for your reply.  I&#x27;m a bit confused.  From what I&#x27;ve read the last
few days, F2L over at speedcubing.com shows fully 41 algorithms for the F2L
alone (codes a01x through b25x).  Add to that the algs I would need to learn
to improve on the LL, how do you come up with 8 algs to learn?  Maybe this
is just a terminology problem I&#x27;m having.

Scott

          <div class="email-content">The Rubiks.com cube won&#x27;t be very popular amongst most speedcubists 
unless they make the new one with the &quot;correct&quot; color configuration. 
As i can see from Ton&#x27;s picture (link posted in this forum) it has at 
least white adjacent to yellow. For vintage cubists this is 
sacrelige. One should have: white OPPOSITE yellow, green opposite 
blue, and orange opposite red/brown. And preferrably BOY (clockwise). 
With the new fused tiles restickering will be almost impossible i 
guess. Color arrangement has always been a drawback for most of 
Mefferts cube puzzles also. I have their 5x5x5 professor cube and 
hate the colors !!

          <div class="email-content">Hey! I want  white adjacent to yellow. I hope the opposite clors  
will be darker colors. So my preferred color scheme is bkue-white, 
green-yellow and red-orange, the colors of maximum contrast. Thn I 
can choose opposite faces to dislay dark/light colors, which looks 
more striking. White-yellow face is to blurred, anddoes not 
photograph well.

Before you speedcubists clobber me to deah for beung &#x27;different&#x27;, 
may I offer a compromise? Sell cubes with no stickers, but put the 
stickers next t the cube in the package for the cuber to affix  
himself or herself. This way you can select your preferred color 
scheme and have a nice, smoothly-rotarting speedcube. This last part 
is appreciated by cube artists, too.

          <div class="email-content">I think this looks good too.  Both my 2 and a 3 method and this seem 
to be good staging posts on the way to a full 2 look.  I think its 
amazing how many algorithms you have to add to move from these up to 
the full 2 look.  To get from 2 and a 3-cycle to 2 looks its really 
possible to just add the new algorithms one at a time - each time to 
add a new one you can make use of it to shorten some of the cases.  
I&#x27;m sure this is true with your 2.75 look too.

What&#x27;s intuitive and what&#x27;s not? Difficult question.
Even a basic R move had results I didn&#x27;t expect the first time I
touched the cube.
And now, some speedcubists would say that they use complex LL
algorithms intuitively.

On speedcubing.com, it&#x27;s written: &quot;You must understand the logic and
reasoning behind every single turn you make during the solution&quot;.
( ...whereas sometimes, intuitions are things you can&#x27;t explain... ;-) )

Take a simple Sune: R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2R.
It&#x27;s intuitively easy to see why it does not destroy the F2L (you
bring DBR+BR to U, do a few things, and put them back to their place
at the end). It&#x27;s intuitively easy to know why edges orientation does
not change too (moving only 2 sides). But the effect on corners
orientation is a lot harder. I can see how it works, and why it works
(analyzing the cube state, step by step), but I never would have found
this algorithm when looking specificaly for a 3-corner flip sequence.
I&#x27;m sure a lot of people consider this algorithm as intuitive, because
it looks so simple.

You were talking about writing down an algorithm found intuitively.
I would say that if it&#x27;s &quot;really&quot; intuitive, there&#x27;s no need to write
it down.
You can reinvent it or a similar one at will.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

   As a vintage cubist I must disagree. The colors you use were on a
minority of cubes.

   The old &quot;Official&quot; color scheme has one corner the primary colors,
Red, Blue and Green clockwise, with Orange opposite Red, White
opposite Blue and Yellow opposite Green. Most of the cubes in 1980
were made this way. The Deluxe was made this way, the Rubik&#x27;s
Game/Challenge cube was made this way and the C*4 cube was made this way.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ... maybe this depends on the country where u bought the cube(s). 
I recall from the heydays that here in Norway almost every cube from 
Ideal/Arxon had the color arrangement mentioned by me earlier. Other 
varieties of the cube(s) were quite rare here. So this is the colors 
i&#x27;m used to, and i would never buy a cube in any other &quot;colorometry&quot;, 
at least not for speedcubing :-) I know for sure other colors would 
slow down my solving tremendously. I dun believe anyone can solve a 
cube equally fast regardless of the &quot;colorometry&quot;. If they can i 
would say they have exceptional skills :-)

Maybe we let the experts/collectors here comment on this...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ton,

   I wish Seven Towns would make a few specific changes:

   Why not offer the adjustable screws for a speedcube. That&#x27;s what we
all want, isn&#x27;t it? Put a washer under the screw and you don&#x27;t have
the old problems of sticking and unscrewing.

   How about interchangeable tiles? That way they could market many
different kinds of tiles. Regular, translucent, smooth or patterned;
they could do seasonal motifs, etc. People wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with one
color scheme, and if the tiles are easier to get on and off that would
please those who wish to adjust the screws.

   How about choices between some different strength springs? That
might be asking a bit much.

   Green should be lighter than blue like on the deluxe. I can solve
the Deluxe in half the light needed to solve the present-day cubes,
either from Seven Town&#x27;s of Rubik&#x27;s studio, because the new cube have
blue and green with the same contrast.

   Why not go back to that good plastic used in some of the 1980&#x27;s
cubes, and the Hungarian-made Rubik&#x27;s studio cube, or the thicker,
slicker plastic used in the Deluxe?

Thanks for your ideas, I shall relay your input to Seven Towns. I 
probably will see/speak David from Seven Towns soon. btw the color 
scheme of the prototype was a mistake. And the color scheme of the 
orgnal 1980 version is country specific the USA Ideal are mostly 
White/Blue and the European version White/Yellow. Since 2000 is 
the &quot;BOY&quot; color scheme standard.

I had an experience almost like that the other day.
my PB is 28.14, and i had a very good run and after hitting the space 
bar the clock said 26.2, but then i realized that the cube wasnt 
solved. I had mistaken the PLL alg and done a T instead of the R. That 
also sucked :(

I kinda took a break from cubing for a while..  Alot of important <br>

one of my fingers.  I only picked up the cube once in a while, when I <br>

an average without preinspection, because my previous times were in <br>
the 30&#x27;s.  I was kinda curious if you all take longer breaks from the <br>

for it on my website.  Take care and keep cubing.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Each of the opposite colors are very similar. It owuld probably be 
easier to cube with the white opposite blue cube,  but once you get 
used to one color scheme it&#x27;s hard to switch.
There was one person at the WC that had a weeiird cube, with orange 
opposite blue. Even on the two most common ones, orange is always 
opposite red.

Hi all,<br>
Just another problem;<br>
You are solving the cube in front of a lot of spectators (knowing <br>
nothing about records) and you want of course to make a maximum <br>
impression. If you now solve the cube in one second or so, you are <br>
met as an illusionist or bluffer but not as a cube-solver. If you <br>
solve it in an hour or more, you´ll make very little impression. So <br>
evidently, an optimum does exist.<br>
Where is it??<br>

          <div class="email-content">I gues this subject is realy personal preferece

With the same arguments I think white opposite yellow contracst great 
to all colors. Altough I agree on the orange, this is why I prefer 
the bright orange on the orginal 1980 and the new Rubik&#x27;s Studio 
cubes.

But you can indead improve the contrast, know Katsuyuki Konishi has 
his special color scheme, because he has problems seeing colors. So I 
gues he is the expert on the right contrast needed for optimal 
speedcube recognition

Maybe he can give us some good feedback or ideas.

  Hmm ... maybe this depends on the country where u bought the cube(s). 
  I recall from the heydays that here in Norway almost every cube from 
  Ideal/Arxon had the color arrangement mentioned by me earlier. Other 
  varieties of the cube(s) were quite rare here. So this is the colors 
  i&#x27;m used to, and i would never buy a cube in any other &quot;colorometry&quot;, 
  at least not for speedcubing :-) I know for sure other colors would 
  slow down my solving tremendously. I dun believe anyone can solve a 
  cube equally fast regardless of the &quot;colorometry&quot;. If they can i 
  would say they have exceptional skills :-)

  Maybe we let the experts/collectors here comment on this...

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
I guess that&#x27;s more a personal preference. I am used to cube with a weird color scheme; I use black opposite red, a very bright yellow opposite purple and light blue opposite orange (at the time that&#x27;s more between brown and orange). For me that&#x27;s the best scheme, because I start with black, then it doesn&#x27;t matter for the F2L, but the good thing is that my last layer is very very easy to recognize, as red is really flashy compared to light blue or orange, and that gives you a very easy way to see what orientation you need to do. Yes, I can hear you shouting that&#x27;s not possible to have such a weird cube, but I guess the more flashy, the more easy it is... But I agree with whoever told it before, once you&#x27;re used to a color scheme, that&#x27;s the best for you...<br>

You&#x27;re right, choose the colors your prefer. Instant color
discrimination is very important, and a black side does a great job.

I just hope there&#x27;s not going to be an official color scheme in
competitions, especially because Rubik&#x27;s shop still can&#x27;t sell good
stickers. Yellow looks dark with black plastic under, and orange and
brown are nearly identical. 
Pathetic :-)

I finally decided to use &quot;standard colors&quot;), but:
- flashy yellow, orange and green
- dark blue and red (same brightness, very different chrominance)

          <div class="email-content">The way you see things, I think the optimum should be in the low 30es, but I also think it&#x27;s fine if you solve a cube everybody scrambled before in less than 20 seconds, so nobody can say you&#x27;re cheating, that&#x27;s what I use to do... Except when one of my classmates always switches a few pieces, so that I can&#x27;t solve the cube without taking it apart, so he can say :&#x27;hey, you&#x27;re cheating, I can do it too...&#x27;<br>
Another thing is when you do it in let&#x27;s say 60 or 90 seconds, and when you seem to think about each move you do, everybody says, &quot;he is a genius, he understands each move...&quot;. That works pretty much too...<br>
It depends of who is in front of you: if someone says, you have just read some books, and you have learned solving it that way, so I think you should do it as fast as you can, but if people seem very intersted in it, so you better just solve it as if there was a huge mathematical stuff behind each alg - there is, but I guess you don&#x27;t think about it, do you?- and explain them about the phenomenal number of combinations, God&#x27;s algorithm, etc.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

   Yeah I know that a lot of cubes sold in Europe were your color
scheme, but I was talking about the majority of cubes. If you bought a
Deluxe anywhere in Europe it was the the color schmene I described.

   I have your color scheme on a cube and I pull it out and practice
on it occasionally. It takes a few minutes to get used to it enough,
but it is probably a little slower.

   As for just picking up an altogether different color scheme cube I
probably take two or three times as long as usual. In general I do
that when I want to see how much time looking ahead is saving me.

Hi R,

   I got on a bus with the cube in my hand solved, and someone asked
me &quot;How fast can you solve it?&quot;
   The first time that happened I said. &quot;I can generally beat 50
seconds,&quot; and was not pleased when I goofed and took over a minute.
That didn&#x27;t go over too well. This was a while ago.

   The last time I got on a bus with the cube and someone asked me
&quot;How fast can you solve it?&quot;
   I said a minute. So I went slowly at first.

   First solve 52 seconds,
   Second solve 46 seconds,
   Third solve 38 seconds,
   Fourth solve 32 seconds,
   Fifth solve 26 seconds.
   Each time was a little better than the last, and it went over well.

   In general if you exceed expectations it&#x27;s much better than if you
don&#x27;t.

I would guess that for maximal impact, it might be best if you can 
actually do more than one demonstration.  Assuming you&#x27;re thinking 
that your average is too fast to be believable, start out by solving 
slowly.  Let&#x27;s say you take &lt;30 on average - solve it once in a 
minute or two - explain what you&#x27;re doing as you go, perhaps even 
using more algs than you normally would (e.g. Break up the F2L pairs, 
and do a 4 look or more LL).  Next, go through the same process, but 
don&#x27;t explain it as you go, still taking your time.  Then, speed up 
to full speed, still using that sub-optimal solution.  Finally, show 
your true abilities (or the nervous approximation of it) by using 
your normal method at regular speed.  This could show that it&#x27;s not a 
trick, but a method - and when they see the final speed, it could be 
quite impressive.

I&#x27;m not sure that it follows that an optimum exists. Why is that?

          <div class="email-content">Most people realize that solving it really fast is not a trick, 
especially when they mix it up themselves. People seem to be more 
amazed at the speed I can turn it rather than the time so it might 
be more effective to use a less optimal solution with more moves and 
go really fast. Also, many people from my generation haven&#x27;t really 
played with the cube much and might not even know what it is and how 
complex it is. I&#x27;ve had many people say &quot;I&#x27;ve played with one of 
those for a half hour and still couldn&#x27;t solve it!&quot; and could care 
less that I could solve it. People around 30 seem to be the most 
amazed. Another comment that I get constantly: &quot;Can you solve it 
from any position?&quot;

	Just curious about a few things...
	1. What kind of cube do you use? 
	I use the older studio cube from Ton. It has lasted me over 9
months.
	2. What method do you use? 
	I use a combination at this point. I know several F2L algs, and
use intuition for the rest of the F2L. I use a 4-5 look LL system at
this point, and I have just begun learning the OLL/PLL alg set.
	3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it on the
bottom 
	left top or other? 
	I always have it on top. 
	4. How many algs do you know/use? 
	I probably know about 20-25 at this point. 
	5. Are you still learning algs? 
	Yes, the OLL/PLL set. 
	6. Whats your best avg? 
	My best average is about 52 seconds, with a personal best of
39.9. 
	
	Thanks for your time :)
	Thank you.

          <div class="email-content">1. What kind of cube do you use?

I used an older studio cube from Ton at the WC, and I have some more 
of the newer variety coming in.  In the meantime I&#x27;m using one I 
bought from Wal-mart

2. What method do you use?

Fridrich.  For fun I also came up with a simple corners first method 
and average under a minute with that so far.  I kind of like playing 
around with corners first and might try to improve this method a 
little for fun.  For serious speedcubing I use Fridrich though.

3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it on the bottom 
left top or other?

Bottom

4. How many algs do you know/use?

The 53 used in the Fridrich method, plus around 10-15 extra (I use 
two algs for some cases depending on which angle its at).  And now I 
have about 15-16 ZB algs down (though they come up rarely) so about 
80-90 I&#x27;m guessing? ....

5. Are you still learning algs?

Yes, ZB method.

6. What&#x27;s your best avg?

18.87 seconds

****and if I may be so bold as to add a question,

7. What&#x27;s one of your most memorable cube moments?

For me this would be the first time I showed the cube to one of my 
friends from High School.  I started cubing the summer before 8th 
grade, and cubed absolutely like a maniac (i.e. daily basis) those 
first two years of high school.  Well I never really brought it to 
school since it was just a hobby I had, and just something I enjoyed 
that I did after school.  Well one day, like three years after I 
started, I was hanging out with my friend Amanda and somehow the 
cube came up in conversation, and I remember I mentioned that I 
could solve it.  Well she had known me for three years but never 
knew I could do this.  So I pulled out a cube (I eventually started 
keeping one handy) and she scrambled it and then I solved it in 
front of her.  She totally freaked out!  I mean she absolutely 
couldn&#x27;t believe it.  She then proceeded to scramble it several more 
times, totally not believing that I solved it each time.  After that 
she always poked fun at me for being a crazy cube nerd :)  Though it 
was alright, being good friends and all :)

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I think the maximum impact is a product of impact/unit of time (iut) and time. Or better; the integral of iut over time. For the iut is by no means constant.

  Most people realize that solving it really fast is not a trick,

  be more effective to use a less optimal solution with more moves and

Standard Rubik 3x3x3. 2+ years old. Custom stickers. Silicon spray.

It depends. Faster moves with the cross on the left, but it&#x27;s easier
to see with the cross on the bottom. I&#x27;m not a pro.
On the 2x2x2, I usually don&#x27;t make a cross ;-)

PLL + U-Corners + Varasano + a few useless others = about 50

I don&#x27;t want to. Even worse, I would like to forget all the &quot;magical
algorithms&quot; I know.
If I stop cubing for a few months, I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be able to
remember many algs. I don&#x27;t like this kind of fragile knowledge. And
don&#x27;t you hate things you can&#x27;t understand, even if they make you more
powerful?
So, as much as I can, I&#x27;m trying to find &quot;intuitive&quot;, &quot;logical&quot; moves,
sequences of common macros, obvious commutators/conjugates, etc.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, this is an interesting topic important to me. I am that &quot;weirdo&quot; at wc that had the 
non-standard color-scheme, i.e. blue opposite orange. Once you get used to one 
scheme it just &quot;makes-sense&quot; and is thus hard to have to re-adapt. And of course 
there are many that can actively use and instantly switch between two (or more) 
different color-scheme, which is ideal. In my opinion and from what I have read on 
this topic, the standard plus-yellow scheme is not so great for recognition nor for 
cube-art. Of course those using it probably don&#x27;t think so, but that would be a 
somewhat biased opinion. I say use what-ever you prefer, and that competitions 
should not have any restrictions on this aspect. (Except the obvious one - precisely 6 
distinct colors and 9 of each.... Having an ALL white cube would seriously warrent 
immediate disqualification, LOL.)

As for the &quot;ideal&quot; scheme, I think it is totally up to personal preferance. However, if 
anyone is using or planning on using the scheme seen on my site (my signature 
scheme) I would like to know about it :).

  PS. And as a paradox; An other man solves the cube in an average of 40 secs and the public will faster get bored of him than of you. Hence, the faster you solve the cube, the longer you should go on!

world record time :)&quot; (which was true when I said it). Equivalently somethi=
ng like: &quot;that 
was Xs short of the world record&quot; would be helpful in putting things in pre=
spective for 
those unfamiliar with the field.

In college ,especially around the math department, I definately don&#x27;t want =
to get 
notarity by my cube times; I prefer it to be respect based on my academic r=
ecord :).

          <div class="email-content">>From the viewpoint of a cube artist, you are not weird at all. Any 
color scheme goes, provided it stays fixed throughout the design. 
You could also choose weird colors, say, pink-violet, blue-beige and 
gld-silver colors. I will, however, refuse to do a design, where the 
colors blur and cannot be easily distinguished. My eyesight is 
pretty bad and I need ro see wht I am doing. Next thing I need to 
decide is, which colors are on opposite faces and which are on 
adjacent faces. Opposite and adjacent colors are utually exclusive, 
meaning and opposite color on one cube cannot simultneously be an 
sdjacent color on another cube. This is pretty obvious herem, but to 
the outside world of those, who cannot solve &#x27;that thing&#x27; it has to 
be spelled out.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Fellow Cubers,

First off, it&#x27;s been a while... new members to the community and all, so I would like to 
take this opportunity to introduce myself for those who care... (ok lost cause, lol). My 
name is Doug; I am a college student, and self-proclaimed math-geek.


1. My main cubes are rubiks.com brand, off the shelf (those since then, I have ran 
into some poor quality ones, i.e. unbalenced spring tension on average too loose).

2. I use my own method basically (created 4 years ago, still being perfected) except 
with the use of zero to one step of c/e pairing algorithms that are found everywhere 
but have now become inuitive.... I am also adapting the ZB-technique of c/e pairing 
and taking in various sets of algorithms that do some very specific, fairly advanced 
and obsure things. It is best categorized as a Lars-Varient but it has many forms due 
the steps being modular, that is the steps are not sequencially static. In it&#x27;s extremes 
it essentially becomes either A) the nearly pure lars method with only partial early 
edge orientation or substituting the equivalent ZB stuff with steps 5+6 condensed 
into one, B) Gilles new method (no offence, partly my opinion, partly since my method 
is  bit secret so no one can &#x27;really&#x27; dispute it, and mostly because the algorithms 
overlap A LOT, actually I use a superset of the algorithms he displays on his site.... 
not that I am any faster, lol), or C) Heise&#x27;s method... he has many so the main one on 
his site.... (I stress for the first half of it, since I don&#x27;t always do the edge then corner 
thing replacing this by sub-optimal ZB, but I know most of his final step algs and use 
them actively.) He has a lovely method, I highly suggest reading it in it&#x27;s entirety.

3. Nope rarely start out with a cross, although I am an &quot;adaptive-cubist&quot; so I do this 
when an unplesent situation comes up for my initialization. Oddly, it typically will 
then turn out to be an excellent candidate for the cross and Fridrich F2L, though 
hopefully with ZB improvments (more like improvisions now since I do not know all 
the ZB algs).  I have to resort to cross about 5% of all solves though I&#x27;ve been forcing 
myself to stick with my regular method more often since I am not native to the 
Fridrich F2L and get some undesired hesitations. In that case I would form it on the 
top, then imidiately grip it to the left and just continually rotate the whole cube while 
flicking in each c/e pair, this is usually so fast I overlook any ZB preprocessing 
opportunities, which I fine.

4. I use a fair number of algorithms, so many that it is imparitive that I count in the 
way that groups inverses and mirrors together and not more then one for any 
particular case (considering primary and secondary effects combined). Not even going 
to count any c/e algs, even the involved ZB ones. I don&#x27;t want to take the time to 
count them all but probably respectable even in these ranks. I know more then the 
standard (pure) Fridrich system.... I know all PLLs and multiple c/e algs for most 
cases, some obsure Lars 6+7 ones, and almost all the Lars 5+6 ones.... a full 
complement of optimal OLLs and the fairly rare ELL set. Oh and some really, really 
nasty ones that are short i.e. multiple CLLs so I can OLL+CLL combined for many 
cases, and stuff like swap and twist two corners and swap some two edges of the 
same face. If you notice the massive overlaps, I must say that many are for my own 
novelty purposes only and do not serve to improve my times (actaully increasing them 
typically but allowing for the 15% chance of 1-look/1-alg LL, greatly assisted by ZB 
and some other (secret) preprocessing I tend to do). Actaully, on average it hurts my 
times since I have to do more in-depth recognition phases. My ELL insection pause is 
embarassing for an CLL/ELL cubists, except for the trivial cases.

5. I am very much so, still in the journey of learning new algorithms.... I don&#x27;t imagine 
I&#x27;ll ever stop. Equivallently said: I don&#x27;t imagine myself learning all 1211 LL 
algorithms!.... at least not yet, shall I say :).

6. Ah yes, the golden question.... I don&#x27;t consider it a great judge of a cuber, for the 
record. Things like experience, amount of practice, contribution to the cause, even 
helpfulness to the community or number of people one has taught the fine art should 
be factors in the equation to show the full image. In my opinion (always a useful thing 
to add since it will be less likely people will be offened and instead will tend to add to 
the point.) But just to answer your posed question, I would have to say about 20.5s. 
However, I haven&#x27;t taken an average as of late.... actually the posted unoffical is still 
20.9s or so from 3 months ago if I recall correctly. So that is all to say that there are 
many cubists &quot;slower&quot; then me that I highly respect!

> Thanks for your time :)
Hey, no problem man.

BTW, if anyone is offended by anything I say (like not just &quot;disagree&quot;) here or in the 
future... please just private message or e-mail me... no need to be bitter or &quot;fight fire 
with fire.&quot;

-Doug (Happy Cubing Friends!)

p.s. sorry about the occassional lengthy posts, but I consider a thourgh answer better 
then a very short one. Oh, private message me about that too... if you &#x27;really&#x27; have a 
problem with it, lol.

7. My greatest cube moment?
It happened when I received a persionakl note from Sir Roger 
Penrose, complimenting me on my designs. I sent him a photo of one 
oif my designs with a letter, but expected no reply. To my 
amazement, he responded. To those who don&#x27;t know, Sir Roger Pennrose 
is ne of the world&#x27;s greatest living mathematicians. At thed moiment 
it hit e, if such a person found the time to respond, then the 
design probleem is woth developing and struggling for.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
This post really got some responses!<br>
<br>
&gt; 1. What kind of cube do you use?<br>
Rubiks.com mostly. I have a studio cube, but the rubiks.com one I use <br>
now is more flexible, and I like that. The stickers are the vinyl <br>
crap from rubiks.com, I am still looking for a shop here that sells <br>
me vinyl so I can cut my own.<br>
<br>
&gt; 2. What method do you use?<br>
For speedcubing classic Fridrich, improved with some algs. For fun I <br>
do corners first, or layer by layer.<br>
<br>
&gt; 3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it on the bottom <br>
&gt; left top or other?<br>
Top, then F2L switch to left, then LL switch to bottom<br>
<br>
&gt; 4. How many algs do you know/use?<br>
All Fridrich OLL/PLL, a couple from corners first methods (very <br>
short, intuitive not really algs), and some of my own, that are not <br>
published anywhere as far as I know. I don&#x27;t know to how many that <br>
adds up, and it all depends on mirror/reverse counting, maybe I know <br>
80 to 90 algs. Some are really absurd, like orient and permute edges <br>
and permute corners in one alg. Every 100th cube I get a 1 look last <br>
layer with these. I am interested to know though if this could become <br>
a method for the last layer.<br>
<br>
&gt; 5. Are you still learning algs?<br>
Yep. I am slowly learning CLL algs, that I can use in the corners <br>
first system or in my newest try: <br>
- cross<br>
- F2L 3 pairs<br>
- Orient edges<br>
- Last F2L pair<br>
- CLL<br>
- ELL<br>
<br>
&gt; 6. What&#x27;s your best avg?<br>
23.4, done last week<br>
<br>
&gt; 7. What&#x27;s one of your most memorable cube moments?<br>
Seeing Yasmara (my wife) competing in the Rubiks cube world <br>
championships 2003.<br>

          <div class="email-content">As for the record without looking with a partially mixed cube, a 
beautiful way of demonstrating the phenomenal concentration (memory!)
of certain human beings. This type of performance happens normally 
only once officially. The public has to wait or keep silent a few 
minutes while the cubist concentrates before resolving his cube with 
a blindfold on his eyes, unless the cube had been previously mixed.  
Is a really ramdom state practicable without looking?

No and this way I prefer the record of the speedcubist and the fewest
movements.

His inventor had baptized it &quot;Büvös Kocka&quot; in Hungarian which means 
magic cube.

Do you want calculation? 

How to act alone? No need to drag a tricky witness in my suitcase. 
Whoever mix the cube knows nothing in advance. The risk of error is 
already sufficient. Given the impression that the cube mixed by so 
many people who will be the one that  I shall make without looking?. 
How to proceed with it one second to one exchanges without any other 
visible physical object than the cube?. Without forgetting to use 
the most difficult movements (middle layer), change of axis to be 
fully visible. Without waiting, behind my back, without seeing and 
quickly,  nothing more magic, nothing more beautiful in the eyes of 
the public. Believe me error and boldness are fragile. 

Too magician for the cubist and too cubist for the magician. Am not 
I &quot;Büvös Kocka&quot;? 

I have no excuse for my absence in the championship, I did not break 
to an arm. I imagine myself making a success of my trick in front of 
the world in Toronto. Once motivated, I would have tempted my 
official luck. Faulted and disqualified, a true shame! On the 
contrary maybe I would have succeeded  who knows?. Knowing  where 
the game stops that, is the question. I have already realized my 
dream several times. Sometimes being UNIQUE is worth an official 
record. Believe me I am looking forward to meeting an experienced 
cubist. I wish to have a little fun with my behind-the-back trick in 
front of the public. Version integral USA 2004 with the public.

It takes about 7 years for the best to become an expert in the chess 
game and 1 year to become an expert of the speedcubist.  Learning, 
being young is a trump for performance. However the cube offers a 
variety of record. I did not know one of these two games 20 years 
ago. 

I believe that it is more difficult to estimate a Cubist than a 
chess player. There will always be comparisons. The cube is played 
alone and it is also an incredible visual art! 

My corner method is easy and fast for the rubik&#x27;s cube few 
algorythms, sub 30 sec and good approach for the system 2x2x2.

Je vais vous faire voir un cube fabriqué en aluminium 5x5x5 que Min 
Thai a déjà vu. Sa fabrication interne est différente à ceux 
comercialisés. Il roule comme un rubik&#x27;s cube studio. Je veux rendre 
également honneur à Fridrich sur mon site bientôt! Tout sera en

&gt; 4. How many algs do you know/use?<br>
<br>
23<br>
<br>
This is the interesting one... I have a reasonably good average for<br>
someone who uses few algs...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m fairly intuitive (although I am very poor at working optimal<br>
crosses and 2x2x2 blocks) so once I know how an *sequence of moves*<br>
works, I don&#x27;t consider it to be an alg. I looked at the first layer<br>
&quot;algs&quot; and only use those I can understand. I also have little<br>
difficulty mirroring algs (inverse is too difficult though)<br>
<br>
I know 12 permutation algs (still one left over) and 7 corner<br>
orienting algs.<br>
<br>
I also had to learn 4 algs to finish the last corner-edge pairing<br>
without changing orientation<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t learnt a new alg in ages, but I&#x27;m working on combining sunes<br>
and other algs to do in those cases where my LL can be solved in two 7<br>
move algs vs one 7 move alg and one 12 move alg. <br>
<br>
I also try out different algs which do the same thing to try to get a<br>
 move which is more natural. (I&#x27;ve used 3 different algs for the Y<br>
permutation)<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; 1. What kind of cube do you use?<br>
<br>
1981 Arxon / Ideal Toys<br>
<br>
&gt; 2. What method do you use?<br>
<br>
Cross / F2L / OLL / PLL<br>
<br>
&gt; 3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it on the bottom <br>
&gt; left top or other?<br>
<br>
I start with the cross on the bottom and keep it on the left during <br>
the F2L.<br>
<br>
&gt; 4. How many algs do you know/use?<br>
<br>
5 for F2L, 40 OLL&#x27;s and 13 PLL&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
&gt; 5. Are you still learning algs?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m now learning some simple algorithms for flipping edges during the <br>
F2L and I&#x27;m learning all COLL algorithms that solve the corners while <br>
keeping the edges unflipped (40 cases).<br>
<br>
&gt; 6. Whats your best avg?<br>
<br>
Last week, I broke my record with an average of 16.38. My daily <br>
averages are still in the low 18&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
&gt; 7. Most memorable cube moment.<br>
<br>
The World Championship as a whole, but I&#x27;ll pick one favorite moment. <br>
In the second round, I was one of the last to go on stage because I <br>
had the 4th best time in the first round. This meant the pressure was <br>
right on me because I&#x27;d seen a lot of other cubers set very good times <br>
already (Jess Bonde&#x27;s 16.53 and Ron, Gene, DanK and David Wesley all <br>
had 17.x times).<br>
<br>
I felt very nervous and as a result, I got off to a shaky start: 20.x <br>
and 24.x (my worst time of the championship). On the final cube, my <br>
hands were shaking like a leaf, and I couldn&#x27;t get my hands under <br>
control. I finished the F2L in 15 seconds and - luckily for me - I got <br>
a nasty piece pop where the pieces dropped on the floor. At the same <br>
time, David Allen was standing next to me and he got 16.99.<br>
<br>
At this point I felt very bad inside and my confidence was low, but I <br>
thanked God for another chance. I tried to fill my mind with positive <br>
thoughts, but I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking that I was out of the <br>
championship. On my reattempt I took a long deep breath and started <br>
solving. I did one of my smoothest solves at the WC and finished the <br>
cube in 17.17. I was in the final! I punched my fist in the air and <br>
got a nice applause from the crowd. I went off stage and got <br>
congratulations from everyone.<br>

1. What kind of cube do you use?<br>
  A: 1.5 year old cube I got at wallmart, replaced the stickers using <br>
Gilles&#x27;s method.  Soon to be a studio cube though :)<br>
<br>
2. What method do you use?<br>
  A: Cross, F2L, OLLE, OLLC, PLL<br>
<br>
3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it on the bottom <br>
eft top or other?<br>
  A: I learned all my F2L algs with the cross on top, but in prectice <br>
it ends up on the left while I solve, not intentional, but it <br>
works :).<br>
<br>
4. How many algs do you know/use?<br>
  A:  I KNOW probably around 50, but I actually use about 35 of them <br>
(others are for blindfolded and things like that).<br>
<br>
5. Are you still learning algs?<br>
  A: Absolutely, gotta move to the 2 look LL sometime, eh?<br>
<br>
6. Whats your best avg?<br>
  24.xx, not sure extactly, average average is around 26.5.<br>

OddzOn, bought at my local Target store.  The kind that has the black <br>
plastic pins - bought it probably about 12-16 months ago.<br>
<br>
&gt; 2. What method do you use?<br>

CFOP (Fridrich)<br>
<br>
&gt; 3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it on the bottom <br>

<br>
Build the cross on top (U), do F2L with it on L, and finish things <br>
off with it wherever I need it to be to execute he LL algs.  During <br>
the LL, it&#x27;s usually on D for recognition, at least, but frequently <br>
execution as well.<br>
<br>
&gt; 4. How many algs do you know/use?<br>
<br>
Know/use (119):<br>
- all 41 F2L &quot;algs&quot;<br>
- all 57 OLL algs (Finally!)<br>
- all 21 PLL algs<br>
<br>
Know/don&#x27;t typically use (not many):<br>
- Additional algs for the same situtations, but don&#x27;t typically use <br>
them.<br>
- Additional algs for other approaches, such as corners first or <br>
blindfolded.<br>
<br>
&gt; 5. Are you still learning algs?<br>
<br>
Not at the moment, but I&#x27;m sure I will again some day.  For now, I <br>
need to solidify the algs I already know, and concentrate on <br>
improving my F2L.<br>

<br>
&gt; 1. What kind of cube do you use?<br>

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Per Kristen Fredlund&quot; &lt;aspiring_to_love@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all!<br>
<br>
I just wonder if anyone here is interested in supercubing, ie solving <br>
the cube normally but also orienting the face centers <br>
for &quot;supercubing&quot;. Orientation of the face centers is also called by <br>
mathmatical group theorists as the supergroup of the cube. And normal <br>
solving is then a subgroup of this supergroup. Objected oriented <br>
programmers should also be aware of thie phraseology ;-) <br>
<br>
I am interested in both speedsupercubing and solving the &quot;supercube&quot; <br>
in as few moves as possible. Especially the latter since this is <br>
something i haven&#x27;t found any computer program capable of doing. I <br>
know there are now programs that will ignore parts of the cube and/or <br>
restrict available face turs.<br>
<br>
If there is an interest in this here, should we start another group <br>
or just discuss it here? There is a group for corners-first-cubists, <br>
so there is already more than one group for &quot;cuboids&quot; around the <br>
world w access to the web ;-)<br>
<br>
I also welcome private mail about supercubing if anyone regards it <br>
too specialised for general interest :-)<br>
<br>
Btw, my best average for supercubing is 43.6 secs. And my average in <br>
moves so far is around 53 moves. This is only 10-11 moves more than <br>
Mirek&#x27;s record for normal cubing. I know Ron has done some <br>
supercubing and has achieved under 30 secs in average, but he hasn&#x27;t <br>
posted yet. He doesn&#x27;t wanna spoil all the categories i guess ...<br>

Over the last few weeks I have been doing just that. The Java Cube 
applet on my website has some built-in solvers, and I have been 
adapting it for supercubing. This new version will be appearing on my 
website soon.

The main solver in my applet uses Kociemba&#x27;s algorithm, but with 
smaller tables so it is nowhere near as fast. Adding the centre 
orientations makes it much slower. Instead of about 10-30 seconds for 
a random cube, this now often becomes a minute or two for a random 
supercube.

I&#x27;ve got some optimal results for the subgroups, so I&#x27;ll list them 
below.

Two generator group &lt;U,R>:

u++:   (R&#x27; U R U2 R U2 R&#x27; U2)2       (16,22q)
u++:   (R U R&#x27; U2 R&#x27; U2 R U2)2       (16,22q)
All the sequences can be cyclicly changed by the way, for example the 
first one can be changed to (U R U2 R U2 R&#x27; U2 R&#x27;)2 etc. In this case 
inverses can be used too. There are no others of 16 moves in the two-
generator group.

u-,r-: (R U2 R2 U R2 U2)3         (18,30q)
u+,r-: U R U2 R2 U R2 U2 R U2 R U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R&#x27; U2 R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; (20,30q)

Slice group:
u++,d++:             Ls Us Ls Fs&#x27; Ls&#x27; Us Ls&#x27; Fs    (16,8s)
f++,r++,b++,l++:     Us&#x27; Fs Us Ls Us&#x27; Fs Us Ls     (16,8s)
f-,r-,b+,l+:         Ls Us Fs Ls Fs&#x27; Us&#x27; Ls&#x27; Fs&#x27;   (16,8s)
f-,r-,b+,l+,u++,d++: Fs&#x27; Ls Fs Us2 Ls&#x27; Fs&#x27; Ls     (14,16q,7s)

Square group:
f++,b++:                 R2 F2 R2 Us2 L2 B2 L2 Us2 (10,20q,8s)
f++,r++,b++,l++:         L2 F2 U2 L2 U2 Fs2 U2 L2 D2 F2 R2 Us2 
(14,28q,12s)
f++,r++,b++,l++,u++,d++: L2 U2 F2 U2 R2 F2 D2 F2 L2 U2 F2 D2 L2 F2 D2 
B2 (16,32q)

          <div class="email-content">Yes, colour discrimination is important, but so is opposite colour<br>
identification (eg. opposite colours can be identified during<br>
orientation). If you are trying to identify opposite colours, it helps<br>
to have related opposite colours rather than unrelated opposite colours.<br>
<br>
As an example, consider Petrus step 3. In this step, you need to<br>
orient all edges on the front and top sides simultaneously.<br>
<br>
How do you spot bad edges quickly? (ie. those facing the wrong<br>
direction?)<br>
<br>
If the front side is white, you scan the two faces for white *or* yellow<br>
edges. White/yellow edges facing to the front are good, while<br>
white/yellow edges on the top facing up are bad.<br>
<br>
At the same time, if the top side is green, you scan the two faces for<br>
green *or* blue edges. etc. The closer these colours are, the easier it<br>
is.<br>
<br>
The &quot;plus yellow&quot; colour scheme is ideal here because the opposite<br>
colours can be very easily grouped together in our minds.<br>
<br>
Opposite colour identification is also useful in permutation, although<br>
it may be that those who start with any colour use this style of<br>
thinking more than those who always start with the same colour. I expect<br>
that many of the cross starters who begin with the same colour have<br>
memorised the correct order of the four colours around the cross. When I<br>
form a cross (step 3):<br>
<br>
	http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step3.html<br>
<br>
I may end up with any colour on top. I have not bothered to memorise the<br>
correct order of edges for all 6 possible faces, but I can still permute<br>
the edges without any problems just by observing the order of the front<br>
two faces (eg. F and R) and knowing the opposite colours. From there<br>
it&#x27;s just simple pattern recognition.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jaap!

Yes, that is very interesting. I would still like to see this 
implemented in a true platform-specific language like Delphi for 
windows. So maybe if i get permission from Kociemba i will try to 
implement supercubing in his otherwise superb cube-explorer.

If so i would like to know how u have implemented this in ur applet, 
since u use the same algorithm :-)

And by the way. There is one big annoyance with all java-applets. (At 
least in internet explorer.) Most interactive rubik&#x27;s cube java 
applets will let u maneuvre the cube using the mouse. But when u 
press and hold down the right mousebutton and drag the mousecursor 
outside the applet-area and release the button ... yeeesshh ... 
always page frozen, and it will have to be killed with task manager :-
( Is there any way around this? Any fix/patch available? Can it be 
avoided in the applet-code ??

i thought that seventowns had the rights to the rubik&#x27;s cube name.  
but the article mentions that &quot;winning moves&quot; has the rights to it.  
does anyone know the current story with the rights to the rubik&#x27;s 
cube trademark?

i don&#x27;t take averages that often and i certainly don&#x27;t have a &#x27;best&#x27;

Now that you mention Boston... earlier this year I&#x27;ve been there and <br>
I found a wonderful wonderful shop. They had lots and lots and lots <br>
of Rubik-like puzzles. Lots! Unfortunately the guy in there wasn&#x27;t <br>
the owner and didn&#x27;t let me take a picture :-(<br>
<br>
Does anyone know this shop? I think it&#x27;s in Cambridge <br>
(Massachusetts) on Massachusetts Ave, because I remember passing by <br>
the city hall and internet says it&#x27;s on that street ;-)<br>
<br>
More importantly: Can we maybe collect a list of shops like that <br>
around the world? I&#x27;ve also seen a nice one (though nothing against <br>
the Cambridge one) in the Netherlands (in Delft, city center). Any <br>
others? I&#x27;d like to create a website about this :-)<br>

would be even easier than creating a website (but feel free to create 
a website of course!). In addition to the name and location of the

shop entirely full of puzzles and has lots of Rubiks stuff? Is it a 
puzzle + games shop that has a puzzle section with a limited number 
of Rubik&#x27;s products? Does it sell more unusual puzzles or just the 
standard ones?

Just a few thoughts...

and loads of other non-rubiks puzzles. It&#x27;s basically a hobby shop

          <div class="email-content">Hi Eric,

   This is a good example of how newspapers (and other media) can get
things wrong, if only a little wrong.

   Seven Towns owns the rights, having acquired, for example, Ideal&#x27;s
license. Winning Moves, Hasbro, and Hessport sells them under license
from Seven Towns. I&#x27;m not sure of Rubik&#x27;s Studio, which is owned
directly by Rubik. Most of the cubes are made in China, except for
Rubik&#x27;s Studio which I believe are made in Russia, and packaged by
whichever outfit is marketing it.

It&#x27;s correct, but the bandwidth ran out soon after the posting. I got

Cubie applet so that it can handle face centre orientations, i.e. <br>
solve a supercube.<br>
<br>
Other changes are:<br>
- New Square-1 optimiser, and yet another solving method.<br>
- Added these puzzles: Pyrix, Morph head, Drive Ya Crazy, Trio.<br>
- A script for playing with the Hockey Puck puzzle.<br>
<br>
Let me know if anything doesn&#x27;t work.<br>

          <div class="email-content">wow .. that was awesome to watch :)<br>
<br>
it must be hard to solve with so small hands. I saw on the WC pics, that<br>
someone had a very largs 3x3 cube that several ppl were playing with. I bet<br>
most of them had problems getting good times on it, and that must feel<br>
almost the same as it does for Wictoria solving a regular 3x3 :)<br>
<br>
I have a 4 year old that i&#x27;m trying to get interrested in solving the cube,<br>
so i&#x27;ll show her the video. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Eric.
 
Dave from Seven Towns here. We own (on behalf of  Erno) the trademarks and
copyrights in the cube, the name Rubik/Rubik&#x27;s and it&#x27;s &quot;image&quot;. We are toy
inventors and as such don&#x27;t physically sell anything to customers, therefore
we license the rights to sell cubes to companies such as Winning Moves who
sell the Rubik&#x27;s range on our behalf and with our permission.
 
On another important note where the speedcubing community might help me: 
We are always tracking down the distributors and sellers of &quot;fake&quot; cubes.
This is theft from Mr Rubik and obviously as his representatives we take
this very seriously, the next generation of speedcubers are unlikely to
realise what a great puzzle this is if they first encounter such tacky cubes
! Should anyone see these on sale anywhere it would be a great help if you
could let me know where they are being sold and where they come from
(normally says something like &quot;made in Taiwan&quot; ) with as much detail as
possible, and (if possible) send me a picture. That way we can stop this
happening. 
 
I went to a &quot;Cracker Barrel&quot; restaurant in Florida this year who were
selling fakes, I made such a fuss the manager removed them - it would have
made a great video as I must have looked completely insane !
 
Those of you who make your own variations of cubes please don&#x27;t worry - I&#x27;m
only talking about the cheap and nasty stuff that you see for sale in
stores.
 
My e-mail is davej@... &lt;mailto:davej@...> .
 
Many thanks for your support.
Dave

awesome article.

i thought that seventowns had the rights to the rubik&#x27;s cube name.  
but the article mentions that &quot;winning moves&quot; has the rights to it.  
does anyone know the current story with the rights to the rubik&#x27;s 
cube trademark?

<br>
For a cheap answer... Bandwidth is data transfer - each time someone <br>
loads a webpage or looks at a picture or video on your site, that <br>
uses bandwidth.  Cheap/free web space like geocities frequently has a <br>
fairly low bandwidth limit, so even if you get just a moderate amount <br>
of traffic over a short period of time, it will shut down temporarily.<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s not really much you can do about it, aside from minimizing <br>
the unnecessary content on your site and/or expecting it to go down <br>
temporarily from time to time.  Based on the error message produced <br>
(&quot;Access to this site will be restored within an hour&quot;), it sounds <br>
like they monitor bandwidth usage on an hourly basis, so your site <br>
should be down no longer than 1 hour at a time.<br>

theres webspace and bandwidth. webspace is the amount of file 
storage u have on geocitie&#x27;s servers. this allows u 2 upload photos, 
movies, text, etc.   bandwidth is kind of like monthly allowance of 
website activity. i go through Freewebs, so i get 500mb of bandwidth.
bandwidth is measured by the number of hits u get.a typical website 
is about 50k, thus every hit measures up to 50k. so 2000 hits would 
measure up to 100mb. i dont know how much geocities supplies u, so i 
really couldnt help u in that area.i only have 1 suggestion 2 u: 
DONT USE GEOCITIES!!!!!!!!!  youre probably gonna have 2 increase 
ure bandwidth some how(if the problem is that u r actually out of 
it). i dont know if there is some kind of premium service or 
something with geocities, but if there is, they will for sure offer 
more badnwidth in their package. other than that good luck.

Hi, Dave,
this is Hana the solitary 3d cube designer  here. I am the last 
person in the world, who wants to rob Mr. Rubik of hisgreat 
invention, but.... I need a lot of cubes. At the WC2003 I had 345 
cubes, wqhile the speedcubists actually needed only one. 
Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t paid  10 dollars fror  each sand every 
one of my cubes. Some I got as presents, others I bought at garage 
sales. Qhen the first craze subsided, cubes could be had for as 
little as a dollar apiece. I bought them then, and I wish I bought 
more.  :-(((

I know you at seven towns are not actually selling them, but, 
please, pass this simple rule: increase the quality and decrease the 
price. Charge less for bulk quantities. If a person purchases, say, 
500 cubes, that will cost $5000 + shipping.  If you slash that prce 
un half, that will cost $2500 + shipping. Of course, no one will buy 
500 cubes offhand. so you might go down to 50 cubes. Also, make the 
cubes less stiff.

Finally, Dave - I sent you an email. Do you think you van respond?  
Thank you.

Hana a kostky

          <div class="email-content">Dear Hana

If you only knew what the production cost are of an orginal Rubik&#x27;s 
Cube, than you would not think $10 is to much. The Rubik&#x27;s cube is a 
high quality product, the new Rubiks.com is no longer stiff and the 
future cubes will have strong stickers. Seven Towns is constant busy 
improving the cube.

If you realy need 500 cubes the price will not be as cheap as you 
might think, you have to pay tax and import fees. 500 cubes is a big 
box of about 65 Kg so shipment is not cheap. 

As you might know I have a special arrangement with the Rubiks Studio 
to make the Studio Cube available to the speedcube community. Believe 
me, we (the speedcubing Community) have all the support of Seven 
Towns and the Rubik&#x27;s Studio, and they will help us as long as our 
request are reasonable.

Ton

heres what i do...

when my cube starts to get a little stiff and not running like it 
should (i use a rubiks studio cube that i got from Ton)I take it 
apart, and use an old toothbrush to clean out the old spary, because 
it gets dirty.  I clean off every piece, and get as much as i can 
off the center mechanism.  Then i put it back together, except for 
one edge piece.  and i spray some Silicone spray into it ( i use 
Prestone silicone lubricant..its in a yellow can).  dont spray too 
much though, you dont want it running out the other side.  then pop 
the last piece back in and mix up the cube a bit.  I pop out another 
piece and spray again....piece back in and mix it again...and do 
that maybe one more time.  After i have the silicone worked around 
all the pieces I just have to get it to dry.  I just sort of pull 
the layers apart and blow into the cube..it works pretty good, I do 
that and keep mixing until its nice and smooth again.  then i get a 
damp towel and wipe off the cube so i get the silicone off the 
stickers. 

the thing that takes the longest is cleaning the pieces.
Some people use a spray each piece individually with the cube apart, 
but thats too much work for me, and i think my way works just as 
good.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I agree with Ton and I sympathize with Hana.

I would like to add to this discussion however. Last month I was 
trying to contact several different outlets including rubiks.com for 
bulk purcheses of 100 cubes (that&#x27;s over $1,100 when you include tax 
and frieght!). I don&#x27;t feel that $10 is unreasonable for a good 
quality Rubik&#x27;s cube, of course $9 would be better (they sell for $9 
at my local stores in Hasbro packaging, but $11 on rubiks.com). As 
for quality I do think that they could have that improved. A big 
annoyance I persoanlly have with them is that the parts are not 
always identical, I mean specifically the CORNERS. I do tend to have 
to purchese several cubes and then one or two good ones come out of 
that investment. I was very irritated last month when the last cube 
I prepared didn&#x27;t turn out so great and kept popping, it was 
rediculous and the tension was unbalenced. I immediately check the 
box and it said &quot;Colors and Parts may Vary.&quot; So I&#x27;m like, what the 
heck! The pieces are made from molds, heck the molds are made from 
molds and the drying conditions should be identical. As for colors, 
I don&#x27;t really care... I can always resticker it.

As for the tension, I don&#x27;t agree with Hana (perhaps because I am a 
speedcuber and not an artist)..., the usually tension is fine, not 
too stiff for my initial liking (and I stress initial, good tension 
early means I can wear it in properly). However, they DO need to be 
more balenced, in both tension and maximum distance the layers can 
be pulled apart. Once that is in place I can just wear it in, being 
careful of course not to over do it like my last one. So one thought 
comes to mind: &quot;QUALITY-CONTROL-CHECK!&quot;

So as I was saying about the corner pieces... there are 3 major 
internal surfaces, one of which usually has imperfections due to the 
way it was molded. This is sometiems not level and it comes a bit 
sunken inward or buldging outward; the former is preferred and is 
true for most Studio cubes and my main cubes.

So that is the room for improvment, I think. Now as for 
Trademarks.... I agree that there are some really crappy cubes 
floating around that DON&#x27;T DESERVE TO BARE THE RUBIK&#x27;S NAME and is 
an insult to the inventor. One time someone got me a cube from a 
dollar store (*hint, hint* for Seven Towns to crack down on) and it 
was so rediculously bad... wieghted about 1/4 the normal weight of a 
cube and all the pieces were hollow and the plastic was very thin 
and *britle*. I did end up spending 30-40 hours on it off&amp;on (it had 
a tiled white-blue scheme btw) and made it a decent cube. But at 
first it was like &quot;What did I do to deserve THIS!&quot; So ya, it was 
that bad.

I am promtped by Dave&#x27;s post, and I will surely report any illegal 
cubes I see in stores in the future. On a happier note, you guys 
need to advertise more frequently and widely; I have talked to many 
students around campus that don&#x27;t even think that cubes are still 
being manufactured! (One guy said that he always thought they were 
physically impossible to solve (like the Sam Lloyd 14-15 puzzle 
where there is a built in parity error of the puzzle where you have 
15 tiles sliding around a 4x4 frame).) The Key: &quot;CUBE-EDUCATION,&quot; 
lol.

Oh, ya so once all these problems are worked out (throw in stickers 
since I know people have beef about that one too), then we can talk 
about actaully manufacturing &quot;professional speedcubes.&quot; I&#x27;ll lone 
the manufactures one of mine to re-create the mold, lol. As we all 
saw at WC, cubes have the potential (minus the crappy $1 cubes, lol, 
and that enormously oversized one Heath brought (I think it was 
his)) to be incredibly smooth and make beautiful, crisp sounds. I 
wish they could &quot;bottle that&quot; and make cubes that way from the 
start. No market for it (yet) though (especially considering 
production costs), but I&#x27;d pay like $80 for one of them (and I&#x27;m 
cheap so there will be cubers willing to pay $100 for one so that 
times say 200 per year makes it seem more attainable someday as 
demand increases, hopefully).

All this was not to say that Seven Towns is not busy improving 
cubes. I just think they need an expert like Ton on the inside to 
help them out and give the expert opionions. In the mean while, we 
got Studio cubes :). But something needs to be done with their 
screw/spring assembly, like use screws that are only treaded on the 
bottom like Seven Towns does and add 1-2 mini-washers to it.

-Doug (one of the few sub-25 cubers that still prefer the standard 
rubiks.com brand cubes and not Studio, but yet to try and Arxon)

          <div class="email-content">Whow..., great! I can&#x27;t believe it.... and some of my friends 
thought it was lame, but I&#x27;m a fan of the movies. Wonder what it&#x27;s 
gona be like. It can&#x27;t be about the 0th dimension since that is only 
a point in space. The title probably has no other significance then 
to signify that it is indeed a prequel. Should of posted the URL, 
now I gota search for it....

So I was browsing your pictures site and when I hit the next page it 
just died on me... the freakin&#x27; band width thing is lame. But of 
course you could look at in teh other way: &quot;It is reaching it&#x27;s 
bandwidth limit because you are getting a lot of hits!&quot; I&#x27;m sure 
someone here will mirror the pages at your request. For instance I 
have access to a school server (.edu), which tends to equate to 
unlimited bandwidth which is very cool.

If I am correct, since the unofficial record site was founded by <br>
Chris to aim to beat old official reocord, presenting other official <br>
record may encourage those <br>
who are interested in other categories. <br>
And hopefully this community would expand much bigger. <br>

  I do have a question. If we are to look out for &quot;nonRubiks Cubes&quot;<br>
how can you tell by looking? I can understand if it&#x27;s in a store and <br>
you can see the packaging.<br>
 Now on to another question of the same sort. How can you tell by <br>
looking if a cube is what the buyer says it is. Like on eBay? What<br>
if any, are the signs? Size, color, color placement, logo straight,<br>
logo diagonal. I see all kinds of 1980&#x27;s new in package Rubiks Cubes<br>
sealed. Can they even be real?<br>
 I did buy one that claimed to be a 1980&#x27;s Rubils Cube in the clear <br>
plastic &quot;tube&quot; made by Ideal. But I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s real or not.<br>
It clicks when I turn it and it is real stiff. Is that how they were <br>
made back then? Or do they stiffen up with age? This one was opened<br>
and used just a little.<br>
 Any information would help me a lot. Thank you, Sherree<br>

          <div class="email-content">One of the best ways to find out is if there is a logo on the white 
side. But if there isn&#x27;t, then someone might have restickered it.
You could pop off a center cap, if there are little black things 
instead of cubes, it is a rubiks.com version. Also the color 
orientation: white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and orange 
opposite red are the official colors.
Ton probably knows better ways, these are just my suggestions.

          <div class="email-content">The new cubes all have a logo on it, so this must be easy to see. And 
they must have the standard color scheme white opposite Yelllow 

For the old types, if it is sealed and has the logo on it is is most 
likely original. Cubes from 1978-1979 and some of the 1980 had no 
logo, the logo can wear down on a orginal cube. Normally you see it 
is a 1980 rubik because of the bright orange, but also the other 
sticker colors is a give away, then you can look at the inside at the 
kernel, the orginal have a white kernel. However there are some 
Rubik&#x27;s com cube that looks like a clone cube- have an arched edge 
aand a clear plastic kernel-, but this is a very rare type (David 
Allen uses one). Cubes from before 1980 are very hard to get and are 
very different. Most of the early types are very stiff when new, they 
did not use any lubrication, but you can adjust them because they 
have a screw. If is has lubrication this can be some yellow gel type 
lubricant.

See more on orginal Rubik&#x27;s cube types in my collection for 
identification

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
im new to rubiks, seen fridrich&#x27;s site and her times and i just HAD to get <br>
one...  before now ive maybe touched one once or twice as a really little kid <br>
(im 20 now) after 3-4 hours, i found the 1st layer to be very easy, im <br>
unfortunialty having trouble getting any farther, i just cant get over <br>
breaking the first layer and fixing it later... i actually tried using the <br>
alg&#x27;s in the &quot;hint book&quot; that comes with it (the MB Hasbro cube) i really <br>
like fridrich&#x27;s site and plan to use the &quot;by layers&quot; way of solving...<br>
<br>
I guess im asking is where is a first place to actually get started, i kinda <br>
want to just solve the cube once and then go through it again slowly seeing <br>
how the alg&#x27;s work and understand them more and get used to them.  some of <br>
jessicas site confuses me a little i guess ill have to take a day and read <br>
all the way through it...<br>
<br>
does anyone know a good site for a complete newb to learn how to speed cube <br>
(well not really &quot;speed&quot; with this cube, its pretty stiff right now, i bought <br>
it today)<br>
<br>
but anyway, any help would be more then loved, just really looking for 3sided <br>
pictures to algs, and the steps taken to change everything (i understand the <br>
rubiks step moving code)<br>

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Trademarks


Yes, I agree with Ton and I sympathize with Hana.

I would like to add to this discussion however. Last month I was 
trying to contact several different outlets including rubiks.com for 
bulk purcheses of 100 cubes (that&#x27;s over $1,100 when you include tax 
and frieght!). I don&#x27;t feel that $10 is unreasonable for a good 
quality Rubik&#x27;s cube, of course $9 would be better (they sell for $9 
at my local stores in Hasbro packaging, but $11 on rubiks.com). As 
for quality I do think that they could have that improved. A big 
annoyance I persoanlly have with them is that the parts are not 
always identical, I mean specifically the CORNERS. I do tend to have 
to purchese several cubes and then one or two good ones come out of 
that investment. I was very irritated last month when the last cube 
I prepared didn&#x27;t turn out so great and kept popping, it was 
rediculous and the tension was unbalenced. I immediately check the 
box and it said &quot;Colors and Parts may Vary.&quot; So I&#x27;m like, what the 
heck! The pieces are made from molds, heck the molds are made from 
molds and the drying conditions should be identical. As for colors, 
I don&#x27;t really care... I can always resticker it.

As for the tension, I don&#x27;t agree with Hana (perhaps because I am a 
speedcuber and not an artist)..., the usually tension is fine, not 
too stiff for my initial liking (and I stress initial, good tension 
early means I can wear it in properly). However, they DO need to be 
more balenced, in both tension and maximum distance the layers can 
be pulled apart. Once that is in place I can just wear it in, being 
careful of course not to over do it like my last one. So one thought 
comes to mind: &quot;QUALITY-CONTROL-CHECK!&quot;

So as I was saying about the corner pieces... there are 3 major 
internal surfaces, one of which usually has imperfections due to the 
way it was molded. This is sometiems not level and it comes a bit 
sunken inward or buldging outward; the former is preferred and is 
true for most Studio cubes and my main cubes.

So that is the room for improvment, I think. Now as for 
Trademarks.... I agree that there are some really crappy cubes 
floating around that DON&#x27;T DESERVE TO BARE THE RUBIK&#x27;S NAME and is 
an insult to the inventor. One time someone got me a cube from a 
dollar store (*hint, hint* for Seven Towns to crack down on) and it 
was so rediculously bad... wieghted about 1/4 the normal weight of a 
cube and all the pieces were hollow and the plastic was very thin 
and *britle*. I did end up spending 30-40 hours on it off&amp;on (it had 
a tiled white-blue scheme btw) and made it a decent cube. But at 
first it was like &quot;What did I do to deserve THIS!&quot; So ya, it was 
that bad.

I am promtped by Dave&#x27;s post, and I will surely report any illegal 
cubes I see in stores in the future. On a happier note, you guys 
need to advertise more frequently and widely; I have talked to many 
students around campus that don&#x27;t even think that cubes are still 
being manufactured! (One guy said that he always thought they were 
physically impossible to solve (like the Sam Lloyd 14-15 puzzle 
where there is a built in parity error of the puzzle where you have 
15 tiles sliding around a 4x4 frame).) The Key: &quot;CUBE-EDUCATION,&quot; 
lol.

Oh, ya so once all these problems are worked out (throw in stickers 
since I know people have beef about that one too), then we can talk 
about actaully manufacturing &quot;professional speedcubes.&quot; I&#x27;ll lone 
the manufactures one of mine to re-create the mold, lol. As we all 
saw at WC, cubes have the potential (minus the crappy $1 cubes, lol, 
and that enormously oversized one Heath brought (I think it was 
his)) to be incredibly smooth and make beautiful, crisp sounds. I 
wish they could &quot;bottle that&quot; and make cubes that way from the 
start. No market for it (yet) though (especially considering 
production costs), but I&#x27;d pay like $80 for one of them (and I&#x27;m 
cheap so there will be cubers willing to pay $100 for one so that 
times say 200 per year makes it seem more attainable someday as 
demand increases, hopefully).

All this was not to say that Seven Towns is not busy improving 
cubes. I just think they need an expert like Ton on the inside to 
help them out and give the expert opionions. In the mean while, we 
got Studio cubes :). But something needs to be done with their 
screw/spring assembly, like use screws that are only treaded on the 
bottom like Seven Towns does and add 1-2 mini-washers to it.

-Doug (one of the few sub-25 cubers that still prefer the standard 
rubiks.com brand cubes and not Studio, but yet to try and Arxon)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Sherree,
It can be difficult to tell which are the fakes, I guess that&#x27;s a deliberate
attempt by the manufacturers to confuse people.
The real ones will all have the Rubik&#x27;s logo in the white centre, I have
seen one fake that used what looked like a Rubik&#x27;s logo which makes them
even harder to find.
 
&quot;Good Morning America&quot; did a piece on the championship and they all had fake
cubes ! We are going to get the TV coverage up on the website ASAP.
 
An example of a fake is attached, generally fakes have the wrong colour
scheme and are much cheaper - they mostly use hollow cubies.
Best wishes
Dave

Hi all;
  I do have a question. If we are to look out for &quot;nonRubiks Cubes&quot;
how can you tell by looking? I can understand if it&#x27;s in a store and 
you can see the packaging.
Now on to another question of the same sort. How can you tell by 
looking if a cube is what the buyer says it is. Like on eBay? What
if any, are the signs? Size, color, color placement, logo straight,
logo diagonal. I see all kinds of 1980&#x27;s new in package Rubiks Cubes
sealed. Can they even be real?
I did buy one that claimed to be a 1980&#x27;s Rubils Cube in the clear 
plastic &quot;tube&quot; made by Ideal. But I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s real or not.
It clicks when I turn it and it is real stiff. Is that how they were 
made back then? Or do they stiffen up with age? This one was opened
and used just a little.
Any information would help me a lot. Thank you, Sherree

Hello,

I would just like to remind the group members that such a list of
official records is already existing at.
http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/rubik.html
Records are counted as official if they were achieved in a
championship or done in a public demonstration (for example in a TV
show) and witnessed.

Another technical suggestion from me: better springs. Well, I can&#x27;t 
look at the ones in rubiks.com cubes, but I got some studio cubes. 
The ends of the springs scratch on the screw head on one side 
(doesn&#x27;t matter much) and on the center cubie on the other side 
(does matter). Not only does it scratch into the plastic, the 
springs are also contorted the wrong way. That is, when you turn the 
center cubie then because of the friction the spring puts a force on 
the screw that drives it out. I&#x27;ve had this several times, a center 
pieces falling out this way (together with the adjacent cubes of 
course).

And here&#x27;s a legality question: What about the Meffert 3x3 cubes? 
Did they license it or are their cubes different enough and don&#x27;t 
wear the name &quot;Rubik&quot; or what else allows them to produce/sell their 
cubes?

Well thank you very much both of you.I&#x27;ll go to H&amp;E today and see if

          <div class="email-content">Hey, welcome to the group!

I have a word document with graphics that gives a complete solution 
for beginners, I&#x27;ve been handing it out to all the people who ask at 
school.  Granted it&#x27;s not a very quick method, maybe 1:30 if you&#x27;re 
good, but it has alternate algorithms listed for many of the cases, 
making it possible to get down around 45s or so, I did with it.  As 
for online web resources, Dan Knights, Jessica Fridich, and 
www.speedcubing.com have more algorithms and tips than you&#x27;ll know 
what to do with (my beginner method for the LL is based on Dan 
Knight&#x27;s on his web page, I credit him in the file, hope that&#x27;s ok 
Dan!)

Anyway, anyone here would be happy to help though, and if you want 
the word document, shoot me an e-mail, swedishLF@... .

Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Sherree,

   On ebay, the ones in the boxes which are bright yellow on the
inside and display the cube sideways were made by Ideal in 1980, and
sold mostly in the USA. The majority of them have the original
&quot;Official&quot; color scheme Blue opposite White, Green opposite Yellow and
Red opposite Orange. They were made in a number of places - Hong Kong,
Taiwan, USA - assembled in Dominican Republic, etc, and the plastic
varied in each place over time and there&#x27;s no way to tell that I know of.

  All the screws were adjusted by hand and the workers were all
different. If you can remove the cap and get to the screw you can
adjust it to your liking.

  The clear cylinder was copied. Is there a square indentation on the
top of yours? If it&#x27;s square it probably ideal, if it&#x27;s round it&#x27;s
probably a &quot;Magic Puzzler&quot;. The Ideal versions sometimes have where
they were made, like Hong Kong or Hungary, stamped on the bottom, in
addition to &quot;Ideal Toy Company.&quot;

  Your best bet might be the cardboard tube version made for Britain.
They seem pretty consistant in the good plastic.

  If you twist your cube for a while, take it apart and clean it, then
spray it with a non-oil-based silicone lubricant and let it air dry,
then put it back together, you may find it much better. If you use too
much lube it can be a little tacky at first - then either wear it away
or wipe some of it off. If the plastic on the inner cubies isn&#x27;t flat
some light sanding may help before cleaning and lubing.

Sorry, I should have posted a link, me so dumb... but anyway I was 
reading about Cube Zero awhile back and Kazan was asked to be in Cube 
Zero, but he turned it down.  I think that adding kazan to the cast 
would have made a really interesting character, and would make the 
first one a lot more eerie that kazan had been there before, or maybe 
at least helped desing the number plates hehehe.

Yeah, if anyone would like to that for me thatd be great.  I didnt

          <div class="email-content">There is a cardinal difference between cube artists ans <br>
speedcubists. It is the numberof cubes we are using. Techbically, <br>
speedcubists need only onecube. It  should satisfy all orequisits of <br>
speedcubing, be properly lubricated, have screws and good springs, <br>
anything to aid in competitions. Cube artists appreciate those <br>
qualities, also - make no mistake about that. But one cube is not <br>
enough. We need a lot of cuybes. PS Strictly speaking, this is true <br>
only about multi-cube artists. I am one.<br>
<br>
At theWC on Toronto, my designs gobbbled up 345 cubes. If I were to <br>
sell those dsigns, I would have to charge 3450 dollars, before I <br>
could take any profit for mtself, if we  take each cube at $10 and <br>
do not include shipment. This is a considerable sum of money, and <br>
would makje rhe design quite expensive.<br>
<br>
Second factor is complexity of creating he design, so-called twiddle <br>
and set up fee. Even designs with fewer number of cubes would vary <br>
in price. Take the 270cube design from Toronto. This design is very <br>
easy to construct, so the twiddle fee would be less. Malovicky or <br>
aroslav designs made from same number of cubes would be much more <br>
expensive, because they are cnsiderably harder. I would gladly <br>
diuscuss the twiddle fee with a prospective client so that he or she <br>
knows what he or she is paying for.<br>
<br>
It would be  great, if I could buy my cube directly from the <br>
manufacctrer, bypassing the retailer, who wants his share of the <br>
profit. Of course, there is shipment, also. But for bulk order, <br>
maybe  this, too, could be reduced. Ton is offering the reduction <br>
inshioment, cutting it in half for 4-5 cubes. So, with $10per  <br>
cyube, that would  translate to $75 for 5 cubes. Am I right, Ton? I <br>
am talking about Rubik&#x27;s studio cubes without any prelubing or other <br>
preparation, of course, I know I have to pay extra for that. I am <br>
wondering if ribiks.com dould offer similar reduction for bulk <br>
quantities. That would reduce the cost of the design, because I <br>
would pass the savings to the client. There is ne tghing I noticed <br>
about rubiks.com that I like - they sell a cube with no stickers, <br>
and sell stickers separsateky. Then you can use your own color <br>
scheme or duscuss this with your ckient.<br>
<br>
So, group, what do you say? And don&#x27;t tell me I can set up the <br>
pattern manually without twiddling!! I know that. I also know I <br>
could &#x27;create&#x27; a pattern hsat would not be an element of Rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube froup - and I value my reputation too much for  that!!!!!!!!!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Maybe for bulk Rubik&#x27;s cube the Rubik&#x27;s Promotion cubes is a 
possibility for you. All promotion cubes are made by Intermed 
Asie,but do not sell to end users.

The promotion cube are available at: 


Rubiks.com sell promotion cubes (500 is the mininal amount)

or 

http://www.cubeu.com/ (minimal amount is 250) , I am not sure if this 
site is allowed to sell user designed promotion cubes, this since 
Rubiks.com claims that Intermed Asie is the exclusive partner in the 
premium and promotions business. They normmaly sell offical Rubik&#x27;s 
collegiate cubes.


Maybe this is a possibilty for you. You can even make you own pattern 
on the cube, like some Escher type patterns.  You could make some 
great designs. You can even use the white cube or any other colors. I 
think the price per cube for 500 is much less than $10 per cube.

All depends who many cubes you realy need, are you planning to sell 
some designs?

          <div class="email-content">One thing everyone must realize is that Art of many forms is 
expensive.  Look at the supplies one needs to make a painting, or 
all the work that is done on a movie.  Yes movies are art, and its 
amazing that we can go to our local movie store and buy it for under 
$20.  In your case Hana, you as the artist must also buy supplies, 
being cubes.  AND that is a major problem because they arent cheap 
in a bulk sense.  It would be nice to see a very very good bulk 
price but that would be unfair to the companies as well as the 
manufactors. It becomes a very expensive investment and it would be 
hard to make anything off of cube art unless you have a very wealthy 
person willing to buy your designs.  There really isnt much of 
anything anyone can do.  I&#x27;m sure if you deal with rubiks.com they 
may try and work out some sort of discount, it may not be much, but 
it may only be the best offer you can get.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, rubiks.com will offer a 10% discount on purcheses of 100 
cubes.... 25% on sets of 300! But unless you are willing to buy 300, 
they are actually a bit over priced to begin with when accounting 
for the shipping. ($11 per cube as opposed to the usual $10, I 
actually get $9 at some of my local retail stores.)

One idea is actually to go to the retail stores for a bulk discount. 
(Since rubiks.com is actually a middle-man, where as the retail 
stores are too, but offer can defry the cost of shipping 
significantly.) As for Jake&#x27;s unfairness comment, I don&#x27;t agree. As 
long as both sides are willing, anything goes (provided they arn&#x27;t 
those off brand/illegal ones). The companies do have an incentive to 
sell bulk. I contacted several places and they responded well to my 
propositions last month.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
i bought my cube 2 days ago, solved it tonight, had a friend scramble it up...<br>
(being lame and using the hint book that comes with the thing) i had the whole <br>
thing solved again... almost...<br>
<br>
i have it entirely solved but the problem is between Yellow/Blue/Green...<br>
<br>
on the green side facing the yellow, the middle peice is yellow (and blue on <br>
the yellow side), and on the blue side the same thing... so the yellow center <br>
is sandwhiched between a green and blue edge (the green-yellow and <br>
blue-yellow edge)<br>
<br>
ive tried ron&#x27;s online cube solver and its currently at 700 steps trying to <br>
solve it but has not (min:2 max:20) i think something twitched it or some <br>
shit when i friend was messing with it but i dont know i could be a tard and <br>
this is &quot;common&quot; ?<br>
<br>
and if it did get broken some how could someone tell me/send me instructions <br>
on how to properly take apart my cube and put it back together (the MB Hasbro <br>
kind) i bought it 2 days ago dont want to break it already :-/<br>
<br>
thank you<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi, Ton,
I went to rubiks.com and saw their promotion cube. They are what I 
call picture cubes. Picture cbes are not really suitable for my 
designs, I need regularcubes, like the speedcubists ard usuing.

L also daw the other site. Picture cubes again. Furthermore, they 
cost $1195 without a stsnd and rthe stand can be bought separately 
for #2.95. You get free shipping if you buy 3 cubes with stands. No 
mention is made about promotion cubes.

Do I want to sell my designs? Yes, for two reasons. The first is, of 
course, to make some money.  That is the universal reasoin for 
selling tgings. Second reason is, that I want to get the designs to 
become known to people  at large. And if the seller brings me good 
cbes with easily distinguishable color schemes. I ill charge only 
the twiddle fee. 

Guys, if you can find nice, easy-to-twiddle Rubik&#x27;s cubes, that are 
not picture cubes and that  cost as little as possible iun bulk 
quantities, or promotion cubes.  I&#x27;d appreciate knowing. Thanks a 
lot.

Hana a kostky

          <div class="email-content">Hi Hana

You can also order a regular color based cube, e.g with your own 
logo. However the stickers will be paper based

But I was also thinking about a stripe pattern or a Tartan pattern 
etc you could make many other designs. Maybe even a 
promotional &quot;commercial&quot; design for some company.

I would suggest as many artist do, make some commercial art to fund 
your regular art. Else your investment will be very expensive. 

Maybe you could suggest to sell a promotional &quot;commercial&quot; sculpture 
via Patick Hess (Rubiks.com). 

Success

Wanted to let you know (while we&#x27;re on the subject) that I really 
love my cube.  I&#x27;ve been playing with it non-stop to try to break it 
in and finally adjusted the screws just a bit, pure poetry.  Thank

          <div class="email-content">Yes this is a common thing in genral solving (i.e. not when 
resticted to OLL/PLL type). Your cube is A) not broken, B) your 
friend probaly didn&#x27;t mess it up, and C) this type of parity error 
that transforms a cube into one of the 11 equivalence classes of 
unsolvable positions cannot happen without a piece pop....

The two edge pieces (each edge piece = two &quot;stickers&quot;) you are 
referring to need to be flipped. (if I am reading your post 
correctly)
In that case place your edges on top, i.e. so that your yellow 
center is pointing up :) and one problem edge in front (presumably 
the other would be in the back, but this does not have to be the 
case for this to work). So I&#x27;m going to give the mathematical way of 
approaching this problem:
1. perform a monoflip on the UF edge (call this operation g) that 
fixes everything else on the top layer
2. perform a U^2 (since that is the case you seem to be in)
3. perform g^-1 (do what you did in step 1 backward)
4. post-adjust with U^2
This is a simple little communtator, in mathematics, when you 
consider the cube as a non-abelian group.
My preference for the monoflip to use for step 1 is MD2M&#x27;DMD&#x27;M&#x27; as 
the usual extended Singmaster notation mainstream in the cubist 
community, where M denotes turning the middle slice downward pi/2 
just as the shape of the letter suggests. But that&#x27;s probably becase 
I am accustom to executing center slicing.

BTW, don&#x27;t complain about the little book that came with the 
packaging, this case can be solved by a composition of two of the 
edge algorithms they give (the book will call these sequences).

Hope that helps.... it&#x27;s certainly not the optimal (one of the 100-
200 optimal length 12 in HTM ones) of solving this case but this 
will require little or no memorization.

          <div class="email-content">No, your cube is definately not broken -If Doug&#x27;s post confused you 
which I&#x27;m sure it did(ya lost me at pi/2 ???) a simpler less 
mathematical solution to that problem is here-> 
http://www.ai.sri.com/~cheyer/rubiks/rubiks.html scroll to the 
bottom and do EF-1 with the 2 edges held the way Doug said on the top
with them in the front and back.
hope this helps

          <div class="email-content">I dissagree with that, I think people should learn to do the first 
face the first time by figuring it out for themselves. I don&#x27;t think 
it is beyaond the normal personal&#x27;s intelect/ablitity to do so. As 
for desire level, if they lack passion for it then then don&#x27;t 
deserver to be a cuber. Of course not EVERYONE can do this, but I 
think most people can do this, given some time to fiddle with it. A 
few years ago, when I showed it to my hs tennis team, almost 
everyone who tried could do a face in a reasonable amount of time. 
This also held for the people that I have taught the art.

Now if you meant, first LAYER (there&#x27;s a subtle distinction between 
layer and face), then that&#x27;s a different story. I think that has to 
do with seeing or understanding the mechanism. Once that is out of 
the way, something methodical, like doing all 4 conrers first then 
the 4 edges (this was how I first made it mythodical for myself) or 
doing 4 edges then the 4 corners.... which although makes sense to 
all the cross experts here, may not be the best thing for beginners 
to do.

Come to think of it though, back when I started to be able to get 
part of the cube (before I could solve the whole thing) I did just 
solve piece by piece for a layer, i.e. edge-corner-edge-corner... 
etc. but a bit smarter, expanding on both sides of the &quot;circle.&quot; 
Before I could solve the cube (i.e. memorize even the most basic 
algorithms), I tended to solve a 2x2x3 block, adding a couple 
1x2x2&#x27;s leaving something like Richard decribed in his method 
posting. then I&#x27;d do repetitive moves (now I know to be triggers) 
and see if I could randomly get to solved state (having the last 7 
pieces land in randomly). So b4 I cracked the cube booklet, I could 
typically get down to like 3 unsolved edges surrounding a solved 
corner, then have to mix it up again after examining the marvel for 
a few days. (as a mathy guy, I tried to consider the solvability of 
these close-to-solved positions and come up with some 
generalizations; hoping that I didn&#x27;t get a dud cube like what 
happened to Chris back in the day :) that was stuck in one of the 11 
equivalence classes of mecanically unsolvable positions (NOT 
counting forced corner twists of a loose cube as &#x27;mecanical,&#x27; 
*cough*)).

-Doug (I easily amuse myself with reminiscing of the good-old-
days... when solving sub-2min could impress everybody, now solving 
under 20s can&#x27;t even impress me. Must of been even better in the 
80s. Oh wait, that was the 80s!, better off where I am :).)

          <div class="email-content">My more or less relevant thoughts...<br>
<br>
When I teach people, I tell them to figure out how to do the 2x2x2 by <br>
themselves. I show them some examples and answer questions when <br>
they&#x27;re stuck, but I insist that they figure it out themselves. This <br>
is both because I think they learn better that way, and because I <br>
don&#x27;t know how else to do it...<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s not a problem at all. Almost anyone who is interested enough to <br>
want to learn to solve it, is interested enough to spend an hour or <br>
so figuring it out. People don&#x27;t need to be particularly smart to do <br>
it either.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s not to say that my experiences teaching one method in person <br>
transfer to teaching an other by a written document, just my <br>
experience.<br>
<br>
I usually start with taking the cube apart to show them that it&#x27;s not <br>
made up of 54 independent stickers or 27 little cubes, but 8 corners, <br>
12 edges, and a centerpiece. You can *tell* people the same thing, <br>
and they&#x27;ll nod and smile, but most won&#x27;t *really* get it.<br>
<br>
I wouldn&#x27;t teach beginners starting with the full first layer. It&#x27;s <br>
not a good method, and it&#x27;s not easier to learn than better methods, <br>
so why do it? The only advantage it has is that it&#x27;s the obvious way <br>
that everyone starts. And that makes it even more fun to introduce <br>
people to something different. They get to feel like they&#x27;re learning <br>
&#x27;the secret trick&#x27;.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Great, I had basicly the same ideas  the 3 colorcube , that I use to 
teach children (6-12 years)

See
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Zomer%20Kamp/ZomerKamp.htm

But for young children the letter notation (R F) does not work so I 
changed it in to :

http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Zomer%20Kamp/Zomerkamp_nl.htm

It is  in Dutch but the pictures must be clear even without the text

So in short your document can work if you are about 12 years or 
older, so it depends who old your beginner is. If you want younger 
beginners to understand than you must add more pictures with arrows.

If you have children in your fammily you could &quot;test&quot; your document, 
or maybe a collegue that has children. Thats the way I &quot;tested&quot; my 3-
color solution pages

Succes

A friend of mine just gave me a puzzle as he saw that I was a &#x27;puzzle fan&#x27;... That&#x27;s a strange one, it&#x27;s called hungarian globe, it&#x27;s like a 3D hungarian ring, and it represents the world. I figured out a way to bring pieces to their respective places on 2 of the 3 rings, but I don&#x27;t know how to &quot;orient&quot; them (for example south is pointing to north on some pieces). Also I don&#x27;t really know how to do the 3rd ring... Does anybody know of a good way of solving it? Does any web site exist?<br>
Well, that&#x27;s not really a cube, but it&#x27;s a Rubik&#x27;s like puzzle, I guess it has its place here though...<br>

Hi Zachary,

   Don&#x27;t pull on the corners!

   Turn one side 45 degrees. Pull up on an edge cubie while pushing
down on the sideways edge cubie below it. It should just pop out. If
you need more leverage use a plastic lever like a picnic knife, not a
metal one like a screwdriver.

   Go to Rubiks.com and look at their assembly instructions and pictures.

   I hope this helps,

David J

          <div class="email-content">David,
Way back in the early 80s I &quot;invented/reinvented&quot; the keyhole approach (cross and use an empty middle layer edge/top corner to fill in the others) - I guess lots of people invent this!  Since I started cubing again in September I have come to the conclusion I need to be a lot cleverer about my F2L and I&#x27;ve played about with starting with a 2x2, a 3x2, spotting better ways to use the keyhole etc but I haven&#x27;t found anything I&#x27;m that happy with yet.  As most of my solving is onehanded I keep looking out for ideas that will maybe suit one handed solves even if they arent so optimal for two handed.

Managed a couple of sub 60 second one-handed solves!  Mostly averaging 75-80seconds though.

  Hi Duncan,

     I see you develop your own Last Level algorithms, have you
  considered developing your own approach to the First Two Levels?

Wow you must have a good left hand!  I&#x27;m righthanded and I&#x27;m not much good with my left.<br>
<br>
As for specific algorithms:  I think my strategy is different for onehanded than it would be if I seriously tried to be fast with two.  I tend to move the whole cube around much more to get it into more comfortable positions - this also means that I am looking more continuously than when I use two hands - its easier to be looking for the next move when you are moving the cube with one hand and more slowly.  There are a couple of algorithms where I sometimes add in an extra turn onehanded - for example if I am swapping two pairs of corners in the LL (assuming they are on the U face) I will often (not always!? I dont know why) do R&#x27;UL&#x27;D2LU&#x27;R then do U2 and R&#x27;UL&#x27;D2LU&#x27;R again instead of R&#x27;UL&#x27;D2LU&#x27;R then L&#x27;UR&#x27;D2RU&#x27;L (hope I got that right I don&#x27;t have my cube with me.  I think I do this because I sometimes get confused over my lefts and rights one handed especially if I am moving the whole cube around.  There are a few similar moves.  Also I HATE slices one handed.<br>
<br>
I would be interested to hear what the really fast onehanders have to say.  (Fastest non-fluke time so far is 53 seconds but this was way faster than I usually do).<br>

Maybe that&#x27;s because I have been playing cello for over ten years, I&#x27;ve seen that it helps me a lot while cubing, I can move my fingers much faster. What does Tyson think of it (I guess he was the one who said he plays violin?)?<br>

I don&#x27;t use specific algorithms only for one handed, but if you&#x27;re 
going to seriously get into the one handed, then print out those 
sheets with the algs and relearn them briefly with one hand. Find 
the way that you can turn the faces the fastest.

          <div class="email-content">The first time I solved a cube, I did it all in one night, 8 hours of 
work, using only my own algorithms.  They were crap though :)  I 
couldn&#x27;t have averaged under 2 minutes with that system to save my 
life. (it was a kinda corners first method, but some of the 
algorithms were &quot;controlled mess ups&quot; so that they would fix certain 
problems when I got back to that stage, very inefficient).  After 
that I started looking at other people&#x27;s solutions say Dan K and 
Chris H solving videos and decided I had to learn to do that.  They 
introduced the layer methods on their page, so I went from there.
I did learn the cross and the first layer corners by myself, if you 
can call those algorithms, and I used a very poor algorithm for the 
middle layer edges. Admittedly I did look for the last layer 
algorithms though, and I found a better middle layer edge algorithm 
that I started using.

So I&#x27;d say figure out the cross and at least the first layer by 
yourself if you can (kinda contradictory to my solution I posted, eh 
guys?  I&#x27;ll get around to fixing that, just make a link to the first 
layer section I suppose).  But I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any shame 
in looking up LL algorithms, they can be tough to find on your own.

Just my $.02USD

          <div class="email-content">Well, everybody&#x27;s got to decided this for themself. There are very 
fast people that never worked it all out themsevles before resorting 
to significant resources and there are those that did take the time 
to figure it all out but are now slow, relatively... and vice-versa. 
So it&#x27;s up to you really and it&#x27;s probably about 1:4 on this group 
of the ratio of ppl that figured it all out themself to people that 
just learned algorithms blindly off the net (very rough estimate, 
plz correct me if that doesn&#x27;t seem right). It does take a lot of 
time to figure it out for the first time, some say it&#x27;s worth it, 
others don&#x27;t. Do whatever you feel confortable with :).

But more often then not, ppl use other&#x27;s methods prematurely and 
never did the really hard part and then they wish they had of 
figured it out themselves... they think they could have done so, but 
I guess we&#x27;ll never know. Of cousre taht is not to say that it isn&#x27;t 
a lot of work to go through and do the customizations, which will 
surely have to be done for each individual depending on style, 
handsize, what moves they prefer, etc.... tehn there&#x27;s the practice 
part... I just did about 3 hours worth of practice today for 
instance (to get back down to about 21-23s).

least get used to how the cube moves and how different moves affect 
the pieces. That&#x27;s the most important thing.
I solved the cube myself at first, in about 3 months. I didn&#x27;t really 
think about different algorithms, but I did use a few of them, I 
suppose.

But for the 4x4x4 I made quite a few algs for myself. And I&#x27;m doing 
pretty well, around 2.5 minute average.

i got almost all of it again and again just couldnt get 2 or 3 pieces. then went on the internet and learned a method. playing with it trying to solve it on ur own helped a lot. it was fun sitting there just figuring out how things worked<br>

          <div class="email-content">I know some of you have had some pretty bad piece pops and this one&#x27;s <br>
not much in the way of that, but something very interesting <br>
happened.  I was cubing away and my cube exploded, 7 cubies flew out, <br>
4 corners and 3 edges.  They all landed pretty neatly in a pile, so I <br>
grabbed them and started to re-assemble.  Missing one edge cubie.  I <br>
have torn my corner of the room apart and have not found it.<br>
<br>
Nearest I can conclude this is what happened:<br>
The pop occured very close to the last step in my solution.  I&#x27;d been <br>
cubing for a while and got into the cube zen state, of complete one-<br>
ness with the cube.  So, while positioning this edge, it was going <br>
exactly where I wanted it to, I and I knew exactly where it was.  <br>
This is when it got weird.  Knowing it&#x27;s position exactly made the <br>
cubie rocket out of the cube at a completely indeterminate (but very <br>
high) velocity, this was, nearly as I can tell, due entirely to <br>
Heisenburg&#x27;s Uncertainty principle.  I collapsed part of the cubie&#x27;s <br>
wave function.  So then when I started looking for it, I knew it had <br>
to be at rest, this was my second mistake.  Since I knew exactly how <br>
fast the cubie was moving (not at all) it then became possible for it <br>
to be anywhere in the universe, which is where it has stayed since.<br>
<br>
Or it could be under something, I do kind of need to clean.<br>

surrounded by friends that solve the cube in &lt;40

minor step towards your goal.  &quot;must catch up with

passed them a month ago (roughly) but then Jake caught

<br>
  Maybe that&#x27;s because I have been playing cello for over ten years, I&#x27;ve seen that it helps me a lot while cubing, I can move my fingers much faster. What does Tyson think of it (I guess he was the one who said he plays violin?)?<br>

  Do most people just use algs they can find, and if there able to do an <br>

   The trouble is: E = M C squared not E = M C cubed. This causes the
limitation of the speed of light to invoke strange attractors, which
is often over people&#x27;s heads. Have you looked in the overhead light
fixture?

          <div class="email-content">Good suggestion, I remember something like that happening to me... 
one of my recent piece pops flew at my door making sound.... as I 
was cubing from across the room! (15ft, maybe?)

Of course, I always get those ones were 5-7 pieces just explode into 
the air, and it takes me a while to hunt down the pieces, not to 
mention clean them, then relube.

If it is the case that it landed in a light fixture then, that would 
be *BAD* , especially if it&#x27;s a halogen lamp... but of course if 
that was the case, you&#x27;d of smelled the burning plastic by now :).

We all gota, keep better track of our pops! That&#x27;s the main 
problem... I&#x27;m sure most of use have the reaction time for it. If I 
am standing up and I get a pop, I almost always catch it! (As I am 
finishing the solve left handed, lol. Except for the time when my 
cube really hates me and decides to pop with tremendous velocity 
straight into my EYES!!! good thing I wear glasses :))

          <div class="email-content">I found it under my floor heater behind my 120mm artillary shell 
casing (I use it to keep change).  I was so hoping for some quantum 
physics weirdness!

At any rate, today I was standing in a hall at school, cubing for 
some people and an edge piece popped out right at the end, the cube 
was solved except for that piece.  I got a round of applause for 
shooting out my right hand and snatching the piece out of mid air... 
It was really cool, and would&#x27;ve remained so had a corner not flown 
out while inserting the edge back in.  I was not so lucky as to catch 
this one.
Fun times!

&gt; As I&#x27;m trying to get used to one-handed solving, I have a couple of<br>
&gt; questions to ask. First, it seems to me (I&#x27;m righty) that I can do<br>
&gt; much better with my left hand than with my right hand.<br>
<br>
Actually, this discussion has come up on here before, and I think <br>
that the majority of right handed cubists use their left hand more <br>
effectively for one handed cubing than their right hand, though <br>
obviously not everyone.<br>
<br>
&gt; Does it come from the fact my algs are customized for the right<br>
&gt; hand, and that it&#x27;s easier to move slices on the &#x27;outside&#x27; of the<br>
&gt; hand than on the &#x27;inside&#x27;? Or do I have strange hands ;-)?<br>
<br>
I have conjectured that when you cube with both hands, using your <br>
right hand primarily, it is used for large, sweeping motions, while <br>
the left hand fixes minor alignment problems as you go... This makes <br>
it difficult for the right hand to do everything on it&#x27;s own, because <br>
the smaller, alignment moves are not well practiced.<br>
<br>
&gt; Also what I wanted to know, is if one-handed cubers use specific<br>
&gt; algs, I mean algs you don&#x27;t usually use for normal cubing? or maybe<br>
&gt; another method?<br>
<br>
I use the same approach and algs with two hands as with one, although <br>
some of the algs are not well enough learned, or are too complex, and <br>
I still need to relearn then with just the one hand.<br>

Wow - so many weird piece pops... I guess I&#x27;ll share mine, then.  I <br>
was sitting in my car cubing when an edge popped out, and fell into <br>
the opening around the parking brake lever...  I could see it, but <br>
when I tried to retrieve it (even took apart the console a bit to get <br>
there), it fell further into the car (out of sight), and remains <br>

One day, you should try to propose an algorithm that does not scramble
the cube.
If a competitor says his time is above 0 second, that will prove he does
not respect the rules :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Hana
 
This is just a mistake, there are no plans for a 2005 world championship in
Toronto. The most likely place at the moment is Orlando at the new Pop
Century Resort (See Andy Camann&#x27;s photo&#x27;s), this is because Orlando is
fairly easy to get to and relatively cheap with charter as well as normal
flights from most of the world.
Disney will offer a great deal on accommodation, free passes for their
&quot;worlds&quot; and so on which could make it great fun - it would hopefully be
nice and warm too! However;  nothing has been confirmed yet because its too
early. 
 
Best wishes
Dave

Someone at the WC told me they were going to be at Orlando when you 
said that, but then DanG said that wasn&#x27;t true. And they would 
probably be in Europe.

Like I said nothing is confirmed yet: it might turn out that Disney is
inappropriate (for instance if they try to muscle in on the event - &quot;Disney
World Championship&quot; = yuck, I don&#x27;t think so! )
As soon as some serious plans are made I&#x27;ll let everyone know.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, Dave

&quot;Disney  World Championships&quot; is yucky all right.If they want their 
name to be advertised, it can be done this way: &quot;The World&#x27;s 
Rubik&#x27;sGames Championships  2005 held at Disney Worls in Orlando&quot;. 
For Pete&#x27;s sake, keep everuone&#x27;s name but Rubik&#x27;s out of the title!

I went troi couple of congerences i my lifetime. No two conferences 
dealing with the same topic were held at the same venue 
consecutively.They were held in different cities and sometimes in 
different countries.

I was wondering if Disney World would be interested in my designs. I 
wrote  Anfy an email, askingg for a contact to write to at Disney, 
but he did not respond.  I realize that iy would probably be 
impossible, but there is no harm in trying.

All the best,
Hana a kostky

To provide some additional services I arranged 30 sets of 
replacements stickers for the Rubik&#x27;s Studio cubes. They are strong 
stickers and should last during speedcubing. As soon as I received 
them I will offer them. 

Thanks to the Rubik Studio and Seven Towns for all the support to our 
speedcube community.

Hope to get them soon!

          <div class="email-content">I am also pursuing other means of getting good supply of cubes and 
stickers by directly contacting some of the wholesale distributors 
and manufactures. One of them came back with the price $5.50 per 
cube and another $6.00 per cube, each with a hugh minimum and some 
surcharges. I&#x27;m trying to work with these people to see if I can 
find a good deal to share with everybody here.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dave,

   On ebay and in local shops are a great number of Disney-theme
counterfeit Rubik&#x27;s cubes - Mickey, Minnie, Donald, etc, are all there
in cheap cubes.

  Will you guys take them to court, and ask them to play host or can
you talk them into a whole new marketing plan for their characters,
and *then* have them play most.

Just curious,

David J

   This should read &quot;play host&quot;.

those cubes you re talking about are picture cubes. They are part of 
single-cube-art category. Seven Towns could say that those cubes are 
not really illegal, because thu use specialized stickers. 

Iagre it would be ratrher awkward, if Seven Towns took Disney to 
court, then asked them to host the Championship. This is a possible 
way they could wiggle out of this dilemma.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been trying to learn the stiff hands method for a while now (off <br>
and on working on it) and I&#x27;m beginning with the 2x2x2 cube.  I <br>
understand the orientation of the corners, i can do that easily, and <br>
i completely understand how to write (memorize eventually) the <br>
permutation of the corners. <br>
<br>
The thing is, i don&#x27;t know what it means to write (or memorize) <br>
something like :<br>
<br>
(1)(2468)(37)(5)<br>
<br>
I get that the parity is even, as that is explained on the website. <br>
<br>
I think im supposed to swap the corners in position 3 and 7, but im <br>
not sure.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, what do i do with a thing like (2468) I can&#x27;t swap all of <br>
those... can I? Do i do a bunch of 3 corner cycles or what.<br>
<br>
Can anyone help me, i searched all over, and cant find an explination <br>
of what those grouping actually mean, just how to group them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi David J (and Hana)
 
Seven Towns would not say these are OK - and the stickers would not make a
difference legally,  however as with all of these things the trick is to
find out where they are manufactured and imported. Disney would also have a
case against these people as they would not have been granted rights to use
the images of Mickey and Co.
It&#x27;s all a bit of a headache ! I haven&#x27;t seen any cubes like this for a few
years so I expect they didn&#x27;t sell many and abandoned the manufacturing.
Anyhow we are on the case with a lot of the &quot;big-time&quot; fake- cube people -
will let you know if anything interesting develops. 
Thanks for your interest and help, much appreciated
Dave

          <div class="email-content">I actually don&#x27;t quite agree.  Caltech in Pasadena is governed by an honor code.  
Namely, almost all of our exams are given as take home assignments.  If it says &quot;3 
hours no notes or books,&quot; then the students are expected to time themselves and 
respect the restrictions.

Cubing, most certainly on the internet, is also governed by the honor code.  We 
submit our own personal records to www.speedcubing.com.  We are given the 
priviledge of performing these records in our own homes and our own environment.  
We are not subject to go to an &quot;examination hall&quot; and perform under a proctor or 
anything like that.  The Sunday contest is in the same way... any fool could easily 
make up numbers... but why would anyone do that?  It&#x27;s your own accomplishment... 
and you don&#x27;t win anything.

The honor code must be followed by both parties though.  Putting in something to 
deliberately catch cheaters is not in the spirit of the honor code as I see it.  Likewise, 
to preserve the integrity of cubing, everyone should also follow in the same spirit.

I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t use that method but maybe I can help anyway.
It is possible to do (2 4 6 8) on a 2x2x2 because you can transpose 
corners but if you are ultimately after 3x3x3 (or higher) then 
you&#x27;ll need to be able to do it another way. 
Reading from left to right (permutations are often read right to 
left in mathematics etc.) you get
(2 4 6 8)(3 7)=(2 4 6)(6 8)(3 7)=(2 4 6)(6 8 3)(3 6 7).
Note that (a b)(c d)=(a b c)(c a d), if you read from left to right.

that is excellent! I wouold love such a sschool. I follow a personal

does 3  dimensional cube art. Before Toronto, I would never make sch 
a statement, particularly in view of the fact that I don&#x27;t cinsider 
the procedure *that* hard. But after Toronto, where I was the only 
exhibitor, after searching high and low oin trhe web, and after no 
one, including members of this group, could helo me to find 
somebody, I am forced to make this statement. I know Caltech as one 
of the top schools in the USA. Since yoyu guys are into cubing, can 
you help me find somebody whi does 3d cube art? The website to most 
easily look at is http://cube.misto.cz . Thank you.

          <div class="email-content">Well, thanks for the little bit of help, but im afraid i still dont <br>
understand.  I&#x27;m looking for a really basic answer actually, that <br>
would help me most.  When you group something like (246)(683)(367) <br>
what does that mean.  <br>
<br>
Does that mean to three-cycle corners in position 2, 4, and 6? then <br>
move on to the next group?  I just dont get what the groupings mean.  <br>
<br>
The example solution on the stiffhands&#x27; website is not any help to me <br>
in this department.  For permutating the corners, it doesnt explain <br>
anything.  <br>
Here is the permutation sequence it gives:<br>
 <br>
<br>
 (1357)(2)(48)(6)<br>
<br>
How can i go about solving this?  i cant do a four cycle for corners <br>
in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7... can I?  I dont understand how (in the <br>
example) some stuff, then a 3 corner cycle then the reverse of the <br>
original stuff can make  (1357)(2)(48)(6)  turn into (17)(2)(3)(48)(5)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Happened to me too.  What I did is just put a very very small amount 
of superglue into the screw hole, then tighten the centerpiece as 
much as I wanted.  Once the glue sets, the screws fit much more 
tightly, but still come out or go in when you want them too.  Fixed 
my problems 100% (except now and then I get a violent piece pop, 
almost put out my eye the other day!

I think I read this fix on Ton&#x27;s site or on here somewhere.  Man oh 
man I love that cube!

          <div class="email-content">It took me a while to get the hang of this too, but between stiff <br>
hands and Richard Carr&#x27;s wonderful PDF document, I finally cracked <br>
the blindfolded cubing code.  Heres how I do it:<br>
1. Number the corners.  The numbering scheme that made the most sense <br>
to me was FRU FRD BRU BRD FLU FLD BLU BLD 1-8 respectively.<br>
2. Number the edges, I use FU, BU, RU, LU, 1-4 FR, BR, BL, FL, 5-8, <br>
FD, BD RD LD 9-12<br>
I also always start with the blue as U and the white as F, makes <br>
recongnizing the pieces easier.<br>
<br>
3 Memorize corner orientation as 2 strings of 4 numbers (I started <br>
out trying to convert these into 2 trinary numbers, but that was more <br>
trouble than help.)  I memorize how many clockwise twists they each <br>
need and asign a number 0-2 to them (straight from richard&#x27;s <br>
document) and use his algorithm to orient them.<br>
<br>
4  Memorize the orientation of the corners, that is whichever corners <br>
can be put into their correct place using only FBUD R2 L2 moves, 0 <br>
means no flip 1 means flip.  I memorize as 3 4-bit strings (tried <br>
converting these to 3 binary numbers, more trouble than its worth).  <br>
Use a simple algorithm to flip them.<br>
<br>
5 memorize permutation of corners, this is where you&#x27;re having <br>
trouble.  I start with the piece in position 1 (fru) and say where <br>
does this piece need to go?  If that piece happens to be the piece <br>
that goes in the BRU position, I then move to 3, the sequence becomes <br>
(1, 3... then I look at the piece in position 3 and say where does <br>
that need to go?  lets say it needs to go to position 5 (FLU), the <br>
sequence becomes (1,3,5...)  now lets say piece 5 needs to go to <br>
position 1... I&#x27;m back where I started so the sequence is (1,3,5)  <br>
that means piece in position 1 needs to go to position 3, piece in <br>
position 3 needs to go to position 5, piece in position 5 needs to go <br>
to position 1, then that sequence is done.  A 3-cycle is nice, but it <br>
usually doesn&#x27;t work out very well, usually you get something like:<br>
(1,5,6,7)(3,4,8)(2)  this means 1-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;1, 3-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;3, 2 is <br>
correct. this permutation has a problem: it&#x27;s odd (4-1)+(3-1)+(1-1)<br>
=5), meaning no amount of 3 cycles will get it correct.  So I use an <br>
algorithm that switches 2 corners and 2 edges in these cases, corner <br>
3 becomes corner 5 becomes corner 3 and edge 1 becomes edge 4 becomes <br>
edge 1.  this makes the edge permutation (1,5,4,8,3,6,7)(2)  which <br>
fixes the permutation so that it&#x27;s even (7-1)+(1-1)=6.<br>
<br>
6. memorize edge permutations, taking into account swapped edges if <br>
necessary.  This is done in exactly the same way as the corner <br>
pieces, only if your corners are even, you&#x27;re guaranteed that the <br>
edge permutations are even. if you end up with a cycle that isn&#x27;t a <br>
the swap, then you can do what was mentioned earlier about the <br>
equivalence thingy (don&#x27;t know the technical term)  That is if you <br>
had (1,2,3,4)(5,6) you couldn&#x27;t three cycle your way out of it.  <br>
You&#x27;d have to do (1,2,3)(1,4,5)(1,6,5).<br>
<br>
And thats how I memorize it.<br>
<br>
Then solving it is easy:<br>
Fix the corner orientation using richard&#x27;s algorithm, lacing the <br>
corners they need to be using any moves necessary, flipping them, <br>
then reverse your moves.<br>
Fix the edge orientation placing the edges where they need to be <br>
using any moves necessary, flipping them, then reverse your moves.<br>
Apply the parity fixing algorithm if necessary.<br>
Place the corners by moving them to the locations that the algorithm <br>
operates using ONLY F2 B2 R2 L2 D U moves, apply the algorithm, <br>
reverse your moves<br>
Place the edges by moving them to the locations that the algorithm <br>
operates on using ONLY F B R2 L2 U D moves, apply the algorithm, <br>
reverse your moves.<br>
<br>
Open your eyes and pray.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s how I do it, sorry if the post is long winded, but I&#x27;m bored <br>
and had nothing better to do!  Hope it helps at least a little.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I hope this helps<br>
<br>
&gt; When you group something like (246)(683)(367) <br>
&gt; what does that mean.  <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Does that mean to three-cycle corners in position 2, 4, and 6? then <br>
&gt; move on to the next group?  <br>
<br>
You are correct.  The first part (246) means that you should do a <br>
cycle of the three edges in the positions 2, 4, and 6.  (just make <br>
sure you do it in the right direction, so you aren&#x27;t solving &#x27;(264)&#x27; <br>
instead.....this is the idea of &#x27;clockwise&#x27; <br>
versus &#x27;counterclockwise&#x27;) Then I would move on to (683) and do that <br>
one...<br>
<br>
&gt; Here is the permutation sequence it gives:<br>
&gt;  <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;  (1357)(2)(48)(6)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; How can i go about solving this?  i cant do a four cycle for <br>
corners <br>
&gt; in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7... can I?  <br>
<br>
IF you did know a four cycle of those fours corners then that would <br>
be the optimal thing to do.  But it&#x27;s more difficult to arrange 4 <br>
corners at once in order to use an appropriate algorithm that you <br>
know to cycle these 4 corners.  And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s useful to break <br>
the larger cycles (length 4 or higher) up into 3-cycles (which is <br>
what I think you are having trouble with) because then you have less <br>
pieces to move into place before you do the algorithm, and you&#x27;ll <br>
possibly have less algorithms to memorize too.<br>
<br>
So with (1357)(2)(48)(6), notice that the corners labeled 2 and 6 are <br>
already in their correct places....so how do we take care of the <br>
rest?  I suggest (and I belive this is what Stiff_Hands does) that <br>
you look at the first three numbers that appear and apply that <br>
permutation...that is (135).   Why? you might ask.  because that&#x27;ll  <br>
correct that last two corners of this 3-cycle you are applying (the <br>
corners labeled 3 and 5 in this case...if you&#x27;d like more eveidence <br>
that this&#x27;ll work I suggest trying it a few times, or you could <br>
simulate it by following numbers around on a piece of paper).  So now <br>
with 3 and 5 correct, remove them from the sequence so we have (17)(2)<br>
(48)(6).  To proceed from here I would try to use an algorithm that <br>
swaps two pairs at once and use this on the two pairs that are <br>
left...that is, (17) and (48).<br>
<br>
So the general idea with a long permution, say (12345678), is to <br>
break it up into steps by performing the permutation that correctly <br>
affects the first three numbers, remove the last two numbers of these <br>
three, and repeat as necessary until all pieces of this cylce are <br>
placed or you end up with a single swap.<br>
<br>
So with (123456789) I&#x27;d do (123) first, then I&#x27;ll be left with <br>
(1456789), then I&#x27;d follow up with (145), so I&#x27;ll be left with <br>
(16789), then I&#x27;d perform a (167) so all that&#x27;s left is (189)... and <br>
then I&#x27;d do the (189) to finish it off.<br>
<br>
does that make sense?  <br>
<br>
So we&#x27;ve broken the large permutations down into smaller 3-cycles, <br>
but how does one perform any random 3-cycle? (without having to <br>
memorize an algorithm for every case).  You can do this by just <br>
memorizing one algorithm (say you know (143)....which, you may have <br>
noticed, is also (431) and (314)) and then use this along with <br>
the &#x27;stuff&#x27; and &#x27;stuff inverse&#x27; that Stiff_Hands suggests.  <br>
<br>
How?  Well, say you want to do the 3-cycle (476).  First I would <br>
perform a sequence S, which I would just make up on the fly, that <br>
takes the corner 7 to the spot labeled 3, and the corner 6 to the <br>
spot labeled 1, and keeps corner 4 fixed (along with preserving the <br>
orientation of these three corners, these are the only restrictions I <br>
place on this sequence S that I make up...it can mess everything else <br>
up!).  Then I perform the 3-cycle algorithm I know, (431), which is <br>
now really operating on the corners 4,7, and 6 because they&#x27;re in <br>
those places.  And then I perform S&#x27; (which fixes everything else we <br>
might&#x27;ve messed while performing S, and brings the corners back to <br>
their new respective spots).<br>
<br>
I really hope that helps.<br>

          <div class="email-content">This can happen whan a cube is new, especially when some silicone 
spray will get to the screw. 

Please look at my throuble shooting tips 
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/makinga.htm


In this case I apply a tiny bit of super glue on the end of the 
screw. let it dry, now the screw should fit tight in the kernel

Make sure the glue is dry when you insert the screw!

I do not recommend to put glue in the kernel hole, if it is not dry 
it can spill out and glue the pieces. 

Never put glue in the center pieces,please check the spring and screw 
on any inperfections.

Please contact me if the problem does not resolve with some glue on 
the tip of the screw.

U F2 D&#x27; R2 B2 R2 D F2 U&#x27; L2 (or its inverse depending on which way 
you&#x27;re writing the permutation) is the required algorithm according 
to my notes.
Basically, what you need to do with stiffhands&#x27; method is to fix two 
of the corners in the 4-cycle, like 2 and 4. 
This will leave you (6 8)(3 7). I assume stiffhand&#x27;s method shows 
what to do for a double transposition like this. If not you need to 
use a 3 cycle that uses any 3 of these corners (6,8,3,7). Since 
you&#x27;re not moving 4 corners this will guarantee that one corner is 
solved and will leave a 3-cycle of corners over.

I haven&#x27;t attempted to BLD the 3x3 yet, so maybe my idea isn&#x27;t that <br>
good, but here it is: If you can detect the parity error before <br>
memorizing, then memorize the cube as if you had done an initial U <br>
move (or any other quarter turn, choose the one that fits best into <br>
your system). This should fix the parity, right? Then let this turn <br>
be the very first turn you make.<br>
<br>
The advantage is that you fix it in one move and that you don&#x27;t have <br>
to think about it while solving. The downside of course is that the <br>
memorization step will suffer a bit. But if you always choose the <br>
same first turn then I think you should get used to it quite fast...<br>

   Sometimes lube gets on the screw. In that case wipe the screw
clean, put it back in, take it out, and wipe it again.

   On some cubes, though I haven&#x27;t tried it on a Studio cube, you can
fit a washer under the head of the screw, then it doesn&#x27;t catch on the
plastic.

          <div class="email-content">Well after some MORE procrastination (and I was busy with school <br>
work), I finally have everything set up for my first cube club <br>
meeting here on the University of Michigan campus. I didn&#x27;t go all <br>
out and over advertise like I was going to. Just going to limit it <br>
to primarily my building (&gt;1,000 students) and see how it goes. Took <br>
me long enough to do flyers, prepare handouts, get decent lecture <br>
material, reserve a room, and make a professional looking sign-up <br>
sheet. I am expecting anywhere from 20 to 100 students to show up. <br>
(It&#x27;s a 12,000 student campus, anything half-dececently advertisd <br>
will draw a crowd.) Set it up for Sunday afternoon. It&#x27;ll just be an <br>
hour long (students here are way too busy, esp. in my dorm which <br>
houses the honors students), though I did reserve the place for 3 <br>
hrs just to be safe.<br>
<br>
So I need suggestions!!!! Lots of suggestions. I have a beginners <br>
method outlined, and should have some decent stuff to talk about, <br>
with a dozen members already semi-involved to hold authority. Going <br>
to provide breverages and perhaps food (need $ for that one though), <br>
and I just incase: techno music :). Of course I&#x27;ll have about 20 <br>
puzzles lying around for people to tinker with including &gt;10 backup <br>
3x3 cubes incase people show up cube-less :).<br>
<br>
This is more of a pre-meeting since this semester is ending fast and <br>
the really big meeting should be in the beginning of winter term. <br>
That&#x27;s probably why I decided to restrict it to my building mostly. <br>
(Still anouncing it as a *mass-meeting* to draw people in and <br>
hopefully recurit people to help me in preping subsequent meetings.)<br>
<br>
It may sound like I&#x27;m well prepared for this, but I am still a bit <br>
unsure of it all. Since this fourm is a bit dry lately, I think this <br>
is the perfect time to liven it up. Please, any suggestions are <br>
welcome! (Might have to plan for too little or too many students <br>
showing up.)<br>
<br>
Hopefully, it&#x27;s nothing like: &quot;you should prepare a powerpoint <br>
presentation&quot; (uhh... headaches from last year :)).<br>

<br>
one thing i might suggest is that while you probably shouldnt <br>
speedsolve immediatly, you might want to think about doing a single <br>
speedsolve at the end of the meeting.  this would give everyone an <br>
idea of what is possible with enough practice, and gives a goal to <br>
shoot for.  explain that you aren&#x27;t doing it for intimidation <br>
purposes, but like i said, just as a goal to shoot for.<br>
<br>
along the lines of explanation, you should let them know what they&#x27;re <br>
getting themselves into.  let them know that within a few days they <br>
will be able to solve the cube without any notes.  this piece of <br>
knowledge really surprises people, and gives them more of a short <br>
term goal that is more acheivable to the general public than sub-20.  <br>
also tell them that if they are willing to put in the time and <br>
effort, itll take a year or so to get really fast.  give them <br>
your &quot;cube testimony&quot;.<br>
<br>
you said you already have a beginners solution ready.  just make sure <br>
you tell them the difference between solving one color vs. solving <br>
one layer.  also, don&#x27;t neglect to mention that the centers don&#x27;t <br>
move, no matter how hard you try.<br>
<br>
be prepared to explain things in multiple ways, not just saying the <br>
same thing over and over again.  this is one of the hardest things <br>
about teaching.<br>
<br>
hope this helps.<br>

I was reading them, something just clicked, (obviously with the help <br>
of your responses) and i really understand the permutations now, <br>
althogh not fully.  Im sure i just need to practice doing it with my <br>
eyes open, and i expect to be able to blindfold 2x2 in a few days.<br>
<br>
This is turning out to be much more complicated than I imagined. I <br>
mean, the orientations are straight forward, and easy, but the <br>
permutation of the corners... much more confusing, but you guys have <br>
now given me the confidence that with some practice, im going to do <br>
this in a few days. (I hope the edges aren&#x27;t too complicated... id <br>

          <div class="email-content">My suggestion would be to spend as much of your time there as you 
possibly can in teaching people personally how to solve the cube 
using the beginners method you have outlined.  It is very hard to 
teach several people at once so I recommend teaching one or two 
people how to do it, then letting them move on to show other people 
and then continue on yourself.  Since you already have people that 
are helping you who know how to solve it, then this shouldn&#x27;t be a 
problem.  When I had my cube club back in high school I noticed that 
more people attended when I tried as hard as possible to show as 
many people as possible how to do it.  Then they would spread the 
word to others that it was not only possible, but not that hard to 
learn.  Then more people started coming.

My two cents,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,

   Suppose you have 16 people and eight cubes. Have them all solved
and give one cube to each pair of people. (After you pair them up, of
course.) Have one person take the cube turn around and make one move,
Turn back and hand the cube to his or her partner to undo. Generally
once solved, in the same number of moves (or less), then it&#x27;s the
partner&#x27;s turn.

   After one turn is made and solved successfully by each person in a
pair, two turns are made, then three etc. Give each person maybe three
tries for each &quot;turn.&quot;

   Whoever goes the furthest (number of turns away from solved) wins
and plays the winner of another pair, for a second round. Etcetera and
so forth until there is a single winner.

I&#x27;ll have enough cubes in my collection to spread around... And I 
have already recuruited several people to help out that can solve 
the cube.

I think the problem is planing, I need at least something the first 
5 minutes to hold people&#x27;s attention but not intimadate them. Then 
again I&#x27;ll let my table of puzzles do the talking... and hopefully 
my material will be clear enough though. I guess I gota work on and 
plan out what to say more. My main concern I suppose is to not come 
off arrogant about it.

          <div class="email-content">Hey, my name&#x27;s Tyler Biggs, I&#x27;m 18, and a senior at high school in <br>
Iowa.  I started a cube club shortly after school started this year, <br>
and also shortly after I began cubing, and have taught about 20 <br>
people so far.  I&#x27;ve begun construction on a site devoted to cubing, <br>
and by the end of this semester, I plan to have it completed.  I <br>
haven&#x27;t been cubing terribly long, and am by no means an expert, as <br>
many of you may be, but I&#x27;m learning fast, and suspect I&#x27;ll be <br>
averaging sub-30 within a week or so.  I think I&#x27;ll start posting on <br>
this site regularly, and hope to meet many of you that I&#x27;ve been <br>
reading about for the past months.  And now, to the person who asked <br>
how to get started on the Fridrich method:<br>
<br>
     I&#x27;ve been cubing for about 3 and a half months now, and fully <br>
learned the Fridrich method several weeks ago, so I&#x27;ll tell you how I <br>
would recommend going about it.  I learned all my method via Dan <br>
Harris&#x27;s site, and I recommend it very much for an easy start to it.  <br>
Begin by learning 2 algorithms for orienting edges (opposite edges <br>
and adjacent edges with finger tricks.   Then learn the 7 algorithms <br>
for orienting corners, with finger tricks again.  These 9 algorithms <br>
will be enough for orientation, until you want to sit down and learn <br>
the other 48 or so that are necessary for a 2-look last layer.  Next, <br>
devote a week or so to learning permutations, and their mirrors, <br>
which come to 21 algorithms.  After learning all this, you&#x27;ll have <br>
what they call a 3-look last layer, which is only about 2 seconds <br>
less efficient than a 2-look.  Next, I&#x27;d recommend learning the F2L <br>
with cross on the bottom.  It takes a little while to get used to <br>
these, but you must understand that, nearly every time, you&#x27;re just <br>
putting the edge-corner pair in one of two positions, then 3 moves to <br>
put it in its place.  These can very easily be learned from Peter <br>
Jansen&#x27;s site, as well, but for useful videos, and getting started, <br>
try Dan Harris&#x27;s.  After getting a good handle of the F2L, go back <br>
and learn the other orientations, but this is not terribly <br>
important.  Only 100 days after picking up a cube, I&#x27;m down to about <br>
a 31 second average, and have gotten low 20&#x27;s a few times, and from <br>
what I hear, this is impressive for the amount of time I&#x27;ve been <br>
cubing, especially for learning it all from the internet, no people.  <br>
So good luck, and I hope you get around to learning the entire method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ah yes, Tyler presented an excellent course of action.
I was just gona say that, to start with, it is generally more 
efficent to swap your last two steps, orient edges then permute 
them. This will also be a first step towards OLL/PLL. This will 
force you to learn 3 simple PLLs (if you don&#x27;t know them already) 
and 3 OLLs (you probably won&#x27;t know any of these, I&#x27;m talking about 
the optimal OLLs, not the lengthier OE step you would have usually 
ended with.)

That should be enough to work on for one week. Then you should force 
yourself to do corner twisting as your first step in the LL. 
gradually learn the other 10 PLLs (I suggest starting with the F and 
Y perms). Then you can adjust to a 3 look LL. After that, or even 
before, the F2L should be the priority.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug, how&#x27;s life?

I just want to remind you that you have a tendency to 
sound &#x27;academic&#x27; (which might not be so weird for an academic...)

I have been teaching programming for five years, so here is my humble 
note.

If you intend to explain exactly what the cube is, I&#x27;d like to advise 
you to not throw in TLA&#x27;s (Three Letter Abreviations) without 
properly introducing them first. So don&#x27;t drop OLL, PLL, F2L, after 
at least fifteen minutes of fun and explanation.

Know you audience. 
1)If they are all math students, great, you can talk about 
permutations. If not, you&#x27;d have a hard time even explaining what a 
permutation is, and I prefer calling it &#x27;swapping&#x27;, or &#x27;rotating&#x27;, or 
even &#x27;trading places&#x27; (yes, pun...).
2)If you know some personally, and some not, do NOT treat them 
differently. Act as if everyone is new to you, so the people who 
don&#x27;t know you won&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re not with the in-crowd, and 
should shut up.
3)Improvise depending on the number of people. With ten to twenty 
people you have a group, easily following you in any suggestion. With 
100 people you have a crowd, with its own will. In the latter case, 
you probably won&#x27;t have 100 cubes and you might want to lose the &#x27;try 
it yourself&#x27; option. In that case, have the last part of your session 
available for a walk around &#x27;looking at puzzles&#x27;.

- Try to not stand there and have a &#x27;talk&#x27; as if you are the 
president making a statement. Let people participate, either with or 
without a cube. Ask a lot of questions. If everyone is real quiet, it 
could mean they don&#x27;t understand a word, and are being very polite.

- The pairing is a great idea, for smaller groups, really.

- Make some jokes. The best jokes are when you make a fool of 
yourself. I had the whole group laughing their ass off when I 
completely filled the white board with notes in 3 colors using 
permanent markers. Or when you say: &#x27;You are all here to listen to
a great lecture from the best math student of this university. 
Unfortunately he couldn&#x27;t be here, so you&#x27;ll have to hear it from me.&#x27;

- Never ask &#x27;is that clear to everyone?&#x27; What do you expect? For 
everyone to answer &#x27;yes&#x27;. And don&#x27;t try &#x27;Who doesn&#x27;t get this yet?&#x27; 
(who is the dumb ass here?). Just don&#x27;t ask yes/no questions, and 
don&#x27;t give yes/no answers.

- Breath if you&#x27;re nervous. If you really don&#x27;t know an answer repeat 
after me: &#x27;I don&#x27;t know.&#x27; But continue that with: &#x27;I could check that 
for you&#x27; and make a note.

- Another tip: you could start by disassembling and assembling a 
cube, so people really understand what a cube is actually. Have them 
hold the core in their hands...

- You will have to establish credibility. But: saying that you were 
in the Rubiks Cube World Championship is already enough. And better 
than to say that you are very intelligent is to show it. That&#x27;s a 
tough one, or what Doug? :-D

- Don&#x27;t answer every question in full. Like &#x27;could you outline the 
history of Math and how group theory really works. Oh and also what&#x27;s 
the solution to all permutation puzzles?&#x27; Just be aware of time 
limits, and concentration limits. Apologize for not having the time 
to explain everything, but if you are a pretty girl or get me a new 
car, I&#x27;d be happy to explain it later privately.

- have your &#x27;students&#x27; tell their story. That will also be less 
intimidating and make your show more lively.

- Maybe you could look up the message I posted a while ago about 
Yasmara&#x27;s progress. I wrote down her method, that uses only four 
algorithms. In a nutshell: 
1.FL&#x27;U&#x27;LUF&#x27; to orient edges, 
2.use the Sune (1 or 2 times) to orient corners
Sune=RU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RU2R&#x27;. This is just as a visual help for the next step.
3.RU&#x27;L&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;L to swap 2 corners
4.use the Sune to orient corners 
repeat 3+4 until corner permutation is done
5.use the Sune (2 or 4 times) to permute edges.

Well enough rambling, I could go on for hours, but I won&#x27;t bore you 
to death, or you won&#x27;t be able to attend your own meeting.

Good luck
Michiel

          <div class="email-content">Hi Louie

First the 8 hours is just a indication, when a cube is new I wait 
unitil fine dust appears.

When you lube the cube in 1 edge hole this works fine when the cube 
is already broken in for speedcubing, so for maintance or to add a 
bit more lube. However lubing each cubie and polish it a bit gives 
always the best result, especially when a cube must break in.

I never tried laying them all out and spray, this because you spray 
also the stickers. You better avoid spraying the stickers, the cube 
might become slippery. If you spray each piece you can wipe of the 
lube of the stickers before it is dry. But if you know how to spray 
them laying all out and not spraying the sticker I gues this will 
work fine.

Make no mistake, cube artists MUST be cubists! If you are working 
with designs that use Rubik&#x27;s cube as art medium, you just have to 
be able to solve it.

Since I am a female, I would like to be included among female 
cubers, even if I am not speed cubing. It turns out rhat I am the 
only person in the world who is doing 3d designs. I was the sole 
exhibitor of cube art in Toronto, but I also searched high and low 
on tbe web for 6 years now. I cannot find anybody. Nobody else can, 
either. There were couple of members of this group, who gave me 
websites, but those sites did not do what I am doing. Thanks are due 
to those, who tried to help.

1) Some math to desgin a soliving method
2) Pattern recognition of 100+ patterns
3) Speedy Fingers  

I have found this article: 

http://www.odu.edu/engr/womengineers/bank_8a.htm

This articel states that there are differnce between man and woman in 
Visual-spatial abilities but this could be balanced by changes in 
educational methods. 

So if we believe this article it might be your learning method that 
needs to be changed. Maybe you should focus a bit more in training 
visual-spatial abilities. So what happens to this cubie if I turn 
Right, blindfolded cubing might help to train this. 
E.g. for the cross look at the four edge pieces, close your eyes and 
put them in place, at first 3 edges is fast to learn but for four you 
need some training.

          <div class="email-content">Interesting thoughts Jasmine.  I can think of lots of parallels that either do or don&#x27;t support whatever view you care to take.  Chess for example were there are far more males than females - but then just look at Judit Polgar and her sisters (maybe Jessica is the Polgar of Cubing!).  Mathematics is another interesting area where traditionally there are far more males.  When doing my PhD I was interested to find out from a Portugese student that in Portugal pure mathematics was considered a girls subject.  And then there is soccer - in England soccer is for men and baseball for girls and in the US its the other way about!<br>
<br>
I tend to think that men are more interested but by no means more capable.  I think more men are &quot;obsessive&quot; too so more likely to realise there potential in a discipline such as speedcubing.<br>
<br>
Way back when I taught people how to solve the cube it tended to be more a matter of how interested they were in learning that gender.<br>
<br>
None of the above to be taken too seriously.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That was my question. :-P  So I should spray each cube one by one? 
I&#x27;ll try that, I hope I don&#x27;t mess it up? :)

Where should I look for the fine dust?

Hi Louie, here&#x27;s what I do:
http://grrroux.free.fr/me/me.html
I suppose it depends on the lubricant you can find, or even the
plastic, but when I just remove an edge piece and spray in the hole,
no matter how much lubricant I spray, it never lasts long. I have to
repeat this every hour (100 cubes).
If I do as shown on the pictures (waiting for the liquid to dry up),
every piece is equally lubed, and the cube remains ok for a week.
Be carful, the stickers may suffer (but mine are very strong, and I
don&#x27;t care if they get dirty, they like being washed).

Gilles.

up a cube and start learning, guys seem to *understand* it more 
quickly and more easily than girls. Several guys have pretty much 
learnt the whole cube in 2 lessons, whereas the girls seem to 
struggle with even the first layer after 2 lessons (the way I teach 
F2L to beginners is cross + 1st L corners + 2nd L). In fact, I&#x27;m yet 
to successfully teach a full solution to a girl.

Guess girls have obsessions too. So maybe you have to have an 
obsessive personality to really get into cubing? But I guess that 
much is obvious!

To Assemable take the three different connection pieces and put them 
in one cubie,   all the odd shaped go in the inside. After this is 
put it back, the last piece you twist in place as above. You need a 
bit of force for this.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, well let me first say welcome!  Its always great to have another <br>
cuber here!  Ok, so you are at about two minutes and looking to <br>
reduce your times.  There is a couple of easy things that you can do <br>
that speed your times a lot faster.<br>
1)  Don&#x27;t turn the cube aruond so quick.  When you are looking for a <br>
piece (like a corner), chances are you can find it really quick if <br>
you just slow down.  That might sound strange, but a lot of people <br>
turn the cube looking for a piece really frantically, and that <br>
really does no good to your times.<br>
2)  Ok, nobody likes this one, but practice.  There is no substitute <br>
for experience.  EVER.  Doing the cube over and over and over will <br>
show you its actual inner simplicity.  You&#x27;ll soon learn how a piece <br>
in the back is the one you want, and you didn&#x27;t have to go searching <br>
to get it!<br>
3)  Keep track of your progress.  Print times you have, or write it <br>
on a chart.  That way, when you get discourage (and notice the word <br>
WHEN), you can check and see that you have actually made a lot of <br>
progress.<br>
4)  There are plateaus you will reach, and your times will seem <br>
stuck at specific time for a while.  Just keep practicing, its the <br>
true answer to anything.<br>
5)  Finally, learn the algorithms to the last layer.  Ouch.  That is <br>
the hardest obstacle a lot of cubers have.  Ok, so you don&#x27;t need to <br>
memorize the orientations, but the permutations really do help.<br>
<br>
O yea, and never feel embarrased to ask questions!  That is the <br>
worst thing you could not do, is not ask!<br>

          <div class="email-content">The Petrus method is hard to get used to. What I did when I started 
was go really slowly, without timing, and see how few moves you can 
get. If you can get less than one hundred moves per solve, then it&#x27;s 
easy to get sub-minute. Just practice, a lot.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,

   About 1980 I attended classes in adult-ed called &quot;Mind and
Supermind.&quot; I forget the man&#x27;s name but one speaker went around the
world interviewing people who had great success - Muhammed Ali, the
Houston team who put men on the moon in 1969, Olga Korbut, a blind
marathon runner, and the like.
   He was able to demonstrate that success tended to follow interest
primarily, not any &quot;inborn talent&quot;.

   There is an old debate concerning &quot;nature versus nurture&quot; in
regards to how people performe in life. The basic answer is that given
the same basic talents and equipment that nurture plays a strong role.

   In New York City, several decades ago there was a concerted effort
to find good homes to orphans from around the world. As many of these
were young children there was concern about their placement. To make a
long story short. The tests given the children after a decade showed
that intelligence scores correlated with their upbringing and not
their gene pool, and not their sex.

   It has also been discovered that intelligence is not a fixed
quantity. Your &quot;IQ&quot; can grow.

   There is much more to this.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">So, I&#x27;d call it a success. Not many people showed up (well I under <br>
advertised), but it was still great. Found a few new people that I <br>
didn&#x27;t know had cubes. The meeting was supposed to be from 3-4, but <br>
just ended now (at 7, 4 hours later) because people that were <br>
walking by just kept joining in. I think I was able to teach a bunch <br>
of people how to solve the F2L using basically one algorithm. Some <br>
people I got started on the LL and some I got solving the 2-4x4&#x27;s I <br>
brought along. No one but me dared to touch the 5x5 though :). Some <br>
reason the pyraminx looks intimidating to poeple too (not to mention <br>
the Megaminx). We ran over, and some other group took up the room <br>
(all female) that started getting into the cube (that is until I <br>
showed them a couple solved, one 22s the other 20s, that must have <br>
intimidated them). But apperently a lot of people that were supposed <br>
to come were busy today, and some of my friends was helping somebody <br>
that got into a little basketball accident.<br>
<br>
So the thing is that sometimes I couldn&#x27;t bring myself down to the <br>
level of being able to teach someone a certain step or algorithm..., <br>
but there would be someone there that DID understand that then <br>
disseminated the information downward (might be adifferent person <br>
for each step). So in that was people naturally paried up and taught <br>
each other stuff... so I just went around clearifiying the <br>
procedures.<br>
<br>
I wasn&#x27;t planning on holding another meeting until next semester, <br>
but due to demand, I will have to do one in 2 weeks (next weekend is <br>
Thanksgiving break). And thus *really* advertise and do flyers <br>
properly, basically through out campus, all the bus stops, etc... <br>
(Hopefully this time those studnet governemt candidates won&#x27;t post <br>
on top of all my stuff :).)<br>
<br>
The thought of the day for me is that &quot;People are naturally <br>
curious.&quot; Two decades later, the cube is still as addictive as ever. <br>
Next meeting, the turn out will for sure double!!!<br>

In a way we are.

People during the last two decade have sometimes referred to difficult
issues as &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cubes,&quot; but before that they were sometimes refered
to as Gordian Knots.  Ever hear of a knotty problem?

Hi, Stefan,
I have not invented a new pizzle, but my 3d designs on Rubik&#x27;s cubes 
re rather unique, or so I an told. You may see them in, for example, 
in http://www.design.rubikscube.info orin http://cube.misto.cz . I 
too, would like to benefit from &#x27;inventing&#x27; them.  I would 
appreciate any suggestions.

Were you in WC2003? I exhibited three of my designs.

the Megaminx). We ran over, and some other group took up the room 
(all female) that started getting into the cube (that is until I 
showed them a couple solved, one 22s the other 20s, that must have 
intimidated them). But apperently a lot of people that were supposed

that got into a little basketball accident.

So the thing is that sometimes I couldn&#x27;t bring myself down to the 
level of being able to teach someone a certain step or algorithm..., 
but there would be someone there that DID understand that then 
disseminated the information downward (might be adifferent person 
for each step). So in that was people naturally paried up and taught

I wasn&#x27;t planning on holding another meeting until next semester,

Thanksgiving break). And thus *really* advertise and do flyers 
properly, basically through out campus, all the bus stops, etc... 
(Hopefully this time those studnet governemt candidates won&#x27;t post

The thought of the day for me is that &quot;People are naturally

Next meeting, the turn out will for sure double!!!

<br>
Okay - that&#x27;s what I thought you meant, but I wanted to be sure, <br>
first (rather than confuse things).  There are a couple different <br>
approaches you can take...<br>
<br>
Approach 1 (recommended): Keep all of the edge triplets in the middle <br>
layer (between U and D).  Using the middle edges (the pieces in the <br>
middle of each edge triplet) as reference points (to line up with the <br>
outer edges), turn the cube and or the F, B, R, and L faces (half <br>
turns) so that the upper edge piece on FL, BL, or BR belongs with the <br>
middle edge on FR, and the lower edge on FR doesn&#x27;t.  Turn U and u (U <br>
face and the slice behind it) as needed to bring the outer edge piece <br>
to FR, perform either R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F (fewer moves) or (R U&#x27;) (R&#x27; U) y&#x27; <br>
(R&#x27; U R) (easier, in my opinion), and then reverse the turn to U and <br>
u.  This is actually a 3 cycle of edges.  With some practice, you&#x27;ll <br>
see some tricks to using this more effectively.  If you ever get 2 <br>
triplets that have the right colors, but the middle edge is flipped, <br>
put them in FL and FR, and instead of moving Uu, move the middle <br>
slice only before and after the alg (which has the effect of flipping <br>
FR in place).<br>
<br>
Approach 2: Line up two edge triplets that are still mixed up in FL <br>
and FR, such that a turn of d or u will correctly align a pair.  <br>
Also, put a still scrambled edge triplet on U or D.  Note that this <br>
approach only gets you down to 2 edge triplets remaining - then you <br>
finish it off with the first approach.  Anyways, do the Uu or Dd turn <br>
to line up pieces, replace the triplet with the mixed triplet on U or <br>
D (e.g. R U&#x27; R&#x27; to replace FR with UF), and and reverse the Uu or Dd <br>
turn.  Be sure only to complete triplets and not to tear any apart <br>
that are partially complete.<br>
<br>
The second approach is fewer moves and possibly easier to get your <br>
mind around, but I think it tends to take longer, because your mixed <br>
edge triplets are not always in set places (in the middle layer).  <br>
However, the first approach can take a bit of getting used to, in <br>
order to do it effectively.  Let me know if any of this is unclear... <br>
I could always just write it out plain and simple, giving less <br>
flexibility, and forcing complete algs on you, if you&#x27;d like, but I <br>
think (hope) this should help enough.<br>

Whoah!
That&#x27;s even more impressive than cube art!
That&#x27;s modern art!!!

Nope. I think you&#x27;re the only one in our galaxy.

but there are a few things i cant work out. I solved the cube once, <br>

solved but two of the edges out of 1 of the 3edge triplets were <br>

How much royalties is it for this cube art sculpture?

If it to much I will use them as speedcubes

          <div class="email-content">Great cube zrt, Ton!

I have two small suggestions:
1. Take those cubes out of rtheir boxes.
2. Twiddle some composite patterns on them.
But if you take them out of the boxes, you wull not be able to sell 
them? In that case, ut them back on your sshelf. BTW, are those 
studio cubes?

or I&#x27;ll lose my place and have to start all over. So I really haven&#x27;t <br>

  My question to you guys is, do you have any easy to remember algs <br>
for the last layer. I don&#x27;t care about speed right now, I just want <br>
to be able to solve the cube. <br>
  In the archives awhile back there was  talk of being able to solve <br>
the cube by knowing just four algs. But there was no info as to where <br>
to get the algs. Any help would be a blessing. I&#x27;m struggling here, <br>
having fun but struggling all the same. Please Help!  TIA Sherree<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Sherree,

   The four basic sequences are:
1. Move corners around: R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L
2. Rotate corners: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R
3. Move edges around: F2 U r U2 r&#x27; U F2
4. Flip over two edges: r U r&#x27; U2 r U r&#x27; 

   Lower case letter &quot;r&quot; stands for the middle slice next to the side
indicated by the upper case letter &quot;R,&quot; moved in the same direction. 

   2. 3. and 4. you might need to apply more than once.

Hi Daniel,

   What a perfectly horrible set of algorithms. You have too many
moves moves for almost all of the problems. What you have there seems
to me to be unnecessarily difficult.

  For example, rotating corners are 11 moves at the most. Even using
one alg twice it&#x27;s 14 moves.

   Sorry for the criticism, but that page is scary, and I think it
would put off many first timers.

          <div class="email-content">This is sort of my recap for being gone a little bit<br>
<br>
The Gender Issue:<br>
<br>
im new to cubing so never tought anyone, but i do know that guys are a lot more obsessive and compulsive. take me for example, i seen jessica&#x27;s site from a link off slashdot, seen her do it in 15 seconds and bought one 2 days later, never touching one before then sense i was like maybe 10 (20yo now).<br>
<br>
I could easily seeing the girl questioning the cube for the soul purpose of being interested in the guy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lubing:<br>
<br>
someone sent me a response telling me how to tear apart my cube to lube it, but i for the life of me cant figure out what they were talking about. could someone possible like go into high detail, draw a diagram, make a video :-/ of how im suppose to do this :), ive had my cube for like a week and it sounds like stuff is scrambling around inside like some little peice broke off or something, so i dont want to touch it until i get it lubed....<br>
Thanks in advance<br>
<br>
<br>
Lars Petrus:<br>
<br>
I found your site after reading some of jessica&#x27;s site and really found the F2L approach sort of confusing and always needed help with the second layer (used the hint book that came with it), after i found your site and tried it your way (2x2, 2x2x3, 2x1, 2x3x3) i found getting the first 2 layers very easy and didnt need help with it at all (took me an hour the first time but i got it :)<br>
<br>
If i was ever to teach someone how to cube i would show them your method before any other way, thanks a lot for the site and all the help it has given me (as a n00b)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Hana,

I made the picture after checking a shipment of 60 mint sealed 
Rubik&#x27;s Arxon 1980 versions. 

Thsi stock is for collectors and for speedcubing. Still it will leave 
them sealed else they are no longer collectible items.

Next week I will receive 100 Studio Cubes. Maybe I make a picture of 
this.

Maybe a nice demo event for the future, speedcube three fixed cube 
patterns of 8 cubes. I gues I can do this within 3 minutes. Can you 
do any speedcubing for a fixed pattern? You can learn each fixed 
pattern in at most 26 turns. How fast can you do 26 moves? Might this 
be someting for you?

Ton

          <div class="email-content">Hi, Ton,

Yes, do make that picture and put it here! If you receive 100 Studio 
cubes, then add anorher layer of 6x6 cubes on the borrom, using 91 
cubes in their containers (55+36=91). You couldn&#x27;t do that for your 
Axon shipment, because you only received 60 cubes.

Ton, I don&#x27;t speedcube. I do it differenrly and much more slowly. My 
book tells you how I do it. But my way, alrgough slow, is legal. 
That is, I would never peel the stickers off manually and rearreange 
them manually to creatre a patrtern. It is to rhe credit of this 
group that no one have accused me of doing that, no matter 
how &#x27;humorous&#x27; some members are.

And to the rest of the group: I have bever ckayned thatI oiriginated 
the concept of cybe art! WQhat I have done us to originate three 
dimensional multi-cube art, but not whole cube art! There are other 
trends that I did not formulate, and in which I am not an expert. 
But I would really be interested, how cube art got into cubing. Does 
anyone know?

Hmmm I gues I did not write the rules<br>
<br>
I assumed to start with 8 solved cubes, any fixed pretty pattern can <br>
be made in 26 moves. So you have to learn many fixed pretty pattern, <br>
but this is not that hard.<br>
<br>
So for 8 cubes, 180 seconds/8 = 22.5 seconds per cube with 26 turns.I <br>
gues any one should be able to do this.<br>
<br>
The idea was just a demo event to combine pretty patterns and <br>
speedcubing. So to makes thinks not to difficult you can start with 8 <br>
solved cubes.<br>

You can ask Mirek Gorjan to find the fewest moves for each pretty 
pattern, and twiddle and stack away. But be careful! Unless you 
understand parity pairs you may get stuck.

Working with a set of cubes us not as easy as you might think, 
particularlu if you go three dimensional.

          <div class="email-content">No way, I don&#x27;t think it is lucky at all. Just like some algorithms 
take longer than others, if you happen to come across one that is 6

Yours definitely sounds good to me. What time did you get?

Some people think that if you can&#x27;t reproduce it easily, then it&#x27;s
obviously a lucky solve. Best times *always* are lucky, that&#x27;s why
only averages do mean something.

Anyway, congratulations :-)

if we get one that we say is lucky, we don&#x27;t count the time. Weird.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jasmine :-) I agree with all the other replies. Sometimes 
skipping one algorithm in ur overall method can&#x27;t be considered 
lucky. Even skipping 2 is sometimes not lucky. It all depends on how 
many steps/algorithms that overall method consists of. In my opinion 
there are only poor &quot;scramblings&quot; ;-) In my experience u are bound to 
get &quot;lucky&quot; quite often when the scarmbling was done with only 14-15 
moves. Proper scrambling should be above 20 moves :-) 

>From 29.8 secs there is still a long way to go sub 20 secs. And 
especially so if u are hoping to AVERAGE below 20. I think sometimes 
there is far too much focus on fingertricks and learning heaps of 
algs for one or more particular steps. I often average sub 30 secs on 
average even with a 4LL method. It&#x27;s all about &quot;keeping the flow&quot; as 
u solve the cube. Performing 3 algs can be just as fast as : &quot;1 sec 
to recognize alg 1 + time to perform alg 1 + 1 sec to recognize alg 2 
+ time to perform alg 2&quot;. This is what i mean by flow. You have to 
minimize the time between each algorithm u perform.

Myself i&#x27;m not willing to learn all those algs for a 2LL method. I 
feel happy averaging below 30 with a 4LL, and 99.99% of all ppl are 
amazed by such speeds anyway;-) And i been using the same method of 
solving the cube for 20+ yrs!! Hard to change old habits :-o

Nowadays i&#x27;m more into supercubing, esp minimizing the number of 
moves to solve it. This is very rewarding since i dunno anyone else 
who is also doing that. So far i have manage to average about 52 
moves for supercubing, which is only 10 moves more than the best guys 
do for normal solving. Is is more rewarding to plan ur moves 
carefully than to just &quot;mechanically&quot; reproduce all those algs u 
learnt in order to do a fast normal solve;-)

Anyway ppl still are keen on doing the cube for many different and 
personal reasons. I have been cubing also all those yrs from 1985 to 
2000 of &quot;official global non-cubing&quot; ... hehe :D

Good luck in achieving 25 ... 20 ... :-)

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations Jamine!  It seems to me that as you learn more and more of the OLL algorithms this sort of time will become more of an average - so its not lucky just a peek into the future!<br>
<br>
Having said that I agree with per kristen fredlund - its the flow that counts.  I know I use better algorithms and fewer moves to solve now than I did when i stopped cubing 20 years ago but I am still quite a bit slower and I think i will be for a few more months until it starts to feel more natural.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I was at my parent&#x27;s house last tonight and we were flipping through <br>
some channels.  None of us were paying close attention but all of a <br>
sudden my cubedar went off and I shouted &quot;GO BACK!!!&quot;  My step father <br>
had flitted across the Cartoon Network and I appearantly noticed a <br>
character who looked strikingly similar to &quot;Rubik the amazing Cube&quot; <br>
whom I&#x27;ve only seen in still pictures.  I was wondering what on earth <br>
the old 80&#x27;s cartoon was doing on the cartoon network!  I proceeded <br>
to force the family to watch a few minutes of the show during which <br>
several people (and a robot) solved rubik&#x27;s revenges.  To say the <br>
least my curiosity was piqued.<br>
<br>
I have since discovered that the cartoon show was actually &quot;whatever <br>
Happened to Robot Jones,&quot; a show which I have never heard of.  It did <br>
in fact feature a character &quot;Cubik the amazing Rube.&quot;  but only in <br>
the one episode.  Season 1, Episode 3 &quot;Cube Wars&quot;.  The only <br>
information I have found on it so far is here: <br>
http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/GuidePageServlet/showid-<br>
11350/epid-169139/  But I&#x27;ll keep looking.  I&#x27;d like to see the <br>
complete episode at some point.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

I can answer partially to the square-1 question.
The square-1 is originally Czech invention (Hrsel &amp; Kopsky 
physicians) and went into production in Czech Republic few years ago 
in really good quality with really good plastic stickers (compared to 
the paper-based stickers of other square-1 products) and the name of 
this puzzle is &quot;Cube 21&quot; (not square-1, but that is the only 
difference). There are two variations of &quot;Cube 21&quot;: 6 color and 2 
color (one is silver).
And the best thing is the price: 200,-CZK ~ $7.4 (I think it could be 
more for international sales...)
The worst thing would be the postage prices - I do not have 
experience with it.
Have a look at:

Hope it helps.

Regards,

Josef

<br>
I don&#x27;t have an extra centre piece, but I did experience the same problem (I<br>
guess all 4x4-cubers did).<br>
First I tried superglue, which didn&#x27;t work long. I did however fix my broken<br>
centre piece succesfully:,<br>
the idea is to add some stability to the glued part by having a small piece<br>
of a paperclip melted in the pieces.<br>
When I tried this first I attempted to push them in the plastic but it was<br>
too hard. Making the paperclip hot with a lighter and then creating the hole<br>
in the piece worked for me. Do it for both pieces, make sure the holes<br>
connect.<br>
Cut a small bit (4 millimeter) of the paperclip, put it in one of the<br>
pieces, apply superglue and put the other piece on the other end of the<br>
paperclip.<br>
<br>
http://members.home.nl/heltzel/4x4-centre.gif<br>
<br>
Actually I&#x27;m not sure if there might be better method (replacing the<br>
piece... d&#x27;oh). If you don&#x27;t succeed, make sure:<br>
- The surfaces you&#x27;re glueing together fit, otherwise sand them so they fit.<br>
- The paperclip piece shouldn&#x27;t be too long because then it would do the<br>
opposite (push the pieces away from each other.<br>
<br>
I hope there are other solutions as well, &#x27;cause this is pretty hard.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Good suggestion!... I&#x27;ll have to try that sometime.

I also have a broken center piece... (also blue, like the other 
guy&#x27;s). The last time I tried to repair it, I ended up having to use 
layers and layers of superglue with drying time in between and then 
sanding off the excess. Perhaps adding 1 or 2 metal connectors will 
help strengthen the joint and even make it stronger then before.

I wonder how long it will take for these companies to start making 
very high quality cubes for us. But then again, we&#x27;d be so spoiled 
and have to pay a fortune for them... but they&#x27;d last a lifetime.

Just a survey though... (question for both Louie and Koen:) What 
brand of Rev is it that you have had to repair? I have both a 
rubiks.com one and Meffert&#x27;s brand. Some how it seems that the 
rubiks.com ones are more durable (though my Meffert&#x27;s one turns 
better), and the Meffert&#x27;s one breaks much more often. I think the 
solutions will probably be to aquire a mini-4x4/Eastsheen that are 
much lighter and durable than both of mine.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve just taken up speedcubing (or more accurately, cubing in general)
about two months ago and was wondering where I can find a good Rubik&#x27;s
Revenge cube.  I know I can get them from Meffert&#x27;s and Hessport&#x27;s
Rubik&#x27;s shop online, but I wanted to see what other people say about
them before I drop $25+ on one, especially if quality is a major issue
among different manufacturers (Hessport&#x27;s Rubik&#x27;s shop says that 4x4x4&#x27;s
and 5x5x5&#x27;s are inherently less durable than 3x3x3&#x27;s).  Thanks.

It was in a lot of movies. I think I saw one in The Ring, but I&#x27;m 
not positive. I also saw a unicycle in The Ring, but no one other

          <div class="email-content">I have pants with pockets for a cube, two decks of cards, and 
several coins. Some pants, though, are cargo pants that can hold 
nearly all my cubes (eleven) and nearly half of my decks of cards 
(ten or twenty) and a few bucks in change.
Now I just need pants big enough to hide a tiger, then my magic 
would be complete.... :)

          <div class="email-content">First, learn to do a standard four look last layer if you still 
aren&#x27;t there yet. Orient corners in one alg, orient edges in one 
alg, permute corners in one alg, and permute edges in one alg. Or 
some combination of those. Then once you can do that, learn the 
permutation algs to get to a three look LL. Eventually you might 
want to go to the 2-look, but for now aim for four. Then three.

Drew,

   Less than a week ago I posted this:

 The four basic sequences are:
1. Move corners around: R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L
2. Rotate corners: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R
3. Move edges around: F2 U r U2 r&#x27; U F2
4. Flip over two edges: r U r&#x27; U2 r U r&#x27;

   Lower case letter &quot;r&quot; stands for the middle slice next to the side
indicated by the upper case letter &quot;R,&quot; moved in the same direction.

   2. 3. and 4. you might need to apply more than once.

   I agree with Per Kristen Fredlund that you can beat 30 seconds with
just four algorithms.

I&#x27;m using a four-look method and I average about 1:10.  Pretty slow ;)<br>
but most of it is my F2L method, which I have been looking into<br>
replacing.  Gotta find a more efficient one, right now this is what I<br>
do:<br>
	1. Make a cross on top<br>
	2. Fill in top corners<br>
	3. Fill in edges<br>
I hear most people either use a different method (Petrus?) or place the<br>
corners and the edges simultaneously... anybody have any ideas?  <br>

          <div class="email-content">It is possible to average under 30 seconds with a 4-look LL. But it&#x27;s 
obviously easier with a 3 or 2-look.
But if the problem is in the F2L, that&#x27;s something different. The 
problem with your method is that once the first layer is done, there 
is nothing more that you can do without messing up what you&#x27;ve 
already done. The most popular F2L methods are the Fridrich and the 
Petrus. Fridrich is most popular, though, so it&#x27;s probably easier. I 
use Petrus.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,

   You asked for another method. I don&#x27;t have a website so I might as
well publish it here.

   I guess I need to call it the Salvia method. Here&#x27;s the F2L portion.

First 2 Levels:
1. Place two edge pieces, i.e. one across-the-center-of-one-side pair,
on the middle level, like RF and LF (right front and left front)
2. Place four corners on the first level, (on top)
3. Place the other two edges on the middle level, 
4. place the four edges of the first level; (first level now on bottom)

Some detail:

  1. Place two edge pieces, i.e. one across-the-center pair, on the
middle level, like RF and LF (right front and left front)
       Beginning with an average scramble where no edge pieces are in
place, these can usually be placed at the same time in 3 or 4 moves,
rarely 5.

  2. Place four corners on the first level. (The first level in on top)
       Hold these two edge pieces (and the opposing centers they are
next to) with the thumb and middle finger (I use my left hand) and
feed in (on top) the four corners of the first level. These can
sometimes be done two at a time. Varies greatly - 6 moves is common,
so is 11 moves.

      If I switch my left hand position I need to keep track of where
the two in-place edge pieces are.

   3. Place the other two edges on the middle level. These can usually
be placed at the same time in about 7 or 8 moves. 

   On occasion, where a few moves will place the first four corners,
there is the option of doing step 2 first, that is: four corners
first, then the four middle edge pieces. This can be very fast.

   4. place the four edges of the first level. Often the first level
is now on the bottom.
    I think there may be 1 chance in 4 that one first-level edge piece
is already in place correctly.

   This placement can usually be done two pieces at a time, i.e. one
across -the -center pair at a time. 
   To flip over one edge piece in place takes 7 moves. To flip over
two edge pieces takes 8 moves. (I count a slice as one move)

    I can ususally turn over two LL [last level] edge pieces while
placing the last two first level edge pieces.

Yes, with a minor correction on #2 - the last R should be R&#x27;, so it <br>
should read :<br>
2. Rotate corners: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;<br>
<br>
Also, #3 and #4 will probably have to be intermixed a bit.  #4 flips <br>
two adjacent edges - if none are adjacent, you will need to use #3 <br>
first to put them next to each other.  Also, once all edges are <br>
flipped, you still need to move them around.  The order in which to <br>
use these algs would be as follows (assuming no luck - e.g. all edges <br>
already oriented):<br>
A) Apply #1 once (adjacent pair swap) or twice (diagonal/two pair<br>
     swap)<br>
B) Apply #2 once (rotate 3 clockwise), twice (rotate 3 cc or 2 each<br>
     way) or 3 times (rotate 1 each way)<br>
C) Apply #3 if necessary (Only 2 edges need to flip and are opposite)<br>
D) Apply #4 once (to flip 2 edges) or twice (to flip 4 edges)<br>
E) Apply #3 once (to permute 3 edges clockwise) or twice (all other<br>
     cases)<br>
<br>
Also, if you learn to do #2 both forward (as stated) and backwards (R <br>
U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;), you can always orient corners with 1 or 2 algs <br>
(instead of sometimes 3).  Perhaps you didn&#x27;t need/want this level of <br>
detail, but here it is anyways :-P  Hope it helps!<br>

I t does. Thanks. However, if you want to rotate two opposite 
corners, then you can use the &quot;rube move&quot; instead of 3,4,3. The 
rube move was (partially?) developed by Rubik himself and is 
thus:

r U r U r U2 r&#x27; U r&#x27; U r&#x27; U2

Hold the cube so that both are on top, one in the front, and one in 
the back. r is also interchangeable with r&#x27;, as long as each 
instance is switched, of course. I like this move a lot. It was pretty 
easy to learn, so therefore was the first I remember memorizing 
from an outside source.

Oh, by the way, in #1- 4, which are the cubes that are 
permutated/ orientated in relation to how one holds it?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Grant,

   Thanks for catching my goofs. :)

   Concerning the two piece flip over. I thought I&#x27;d give a simple
sequence that he&#x27;d have to think about a little, rather than a more
complex all-purpose one like: 
   Do R&#x27; u R2 u2 R&#x27; Which flips over the UR edge piece first, and also
messes up the F2L a little, then turn U to any of the other edge
pieces on the LL, then undo the messing up by doing the sequence
backwards: R u2 R2 u R, then what ever U needed to realign the LL.

  I&#x27;m not at all sure why I switched #s 3 and 4 because I do the edge
flipping before the placing

   Regards,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been teaching the cube to a few people recently. I&#x27;ve noticed <br>
that some beginners really struggle with understanding how the pieces <br>
move.<br>
<br>
Before showing a beginner anything on the cube, I talk briefly about <br>
the structure of the cube. I tell them (among other things) that:<br>
* the centres are fixed (although can spin around on their own axis)<br>
* the 8 corners and 12 edges move around the centres<br>
* the centre square defines the colour for the face<br>
<br>
I tell them that if I say &quot;you need to turn the red face 180 degrees&quot; <br>
on their scrambled cube, then it means they need to turn the face <br>
which has a red centre square. Some beginners have no understanding <br>
of what this means and either look at the cube with a confused <br>
expression, or start turning a different coloured face.<br>
<br>
After cubing for so many years, it&#x27;s difficult for me to understand <br>
why so many people have so much trouble understanding what &quot;turn the <br>
red face&quot; or &quot;turn the face with the red centre square&quot; means. Maybe <br>
it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m talking about the cube in terms of colours instead <br>
of F, B, R, L, U, D?? This doesn&#x27;t seem likely I reckon. Given that <br>
newbies aren&#x27;t familiar with cube notation I guessed it would be <br>
easier to say &quot;turn the red face 180 degrees, then turn the orange <br>
face 180 degrees&quot; rather than &quot;do L2 then R2&quot;.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d be interested to hear what other things people have noticed seem <br>
to cause a lot of confusion for beginners?<br>

take the cube apart, it is hard to not understand how it works.<br>
<br>
A lot of people are scared and confused by the cube, and expect to <br>
not be able to understand a thing. They will have very little <br>
confidence and have strong suspicions that they&#x27;ve misunderstood <br>
anything they&#x27;ve heard.<br>
<br>
My other advice is to let people turn the cube themselves as much as <br>
possible, rather than doing it for them. People learn much better by <br>
doing than by watching or being told.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The way I&#x27;m learning the cube right now is by going on line and 
trying different methods. This means I use The FBLRUD method 
in understanding, instead of colors. I first make use of the Lars 
Petrus applets &lt;thanks Lars> to see what the hell is happening, 
then read from the webpage using FBLRUD, occasionally 
glancing back at the applets, then copy parts out of the site and 
print out a sheet. While using the sheet, I constantly make errors 
and have to start over, but eventually become proficient while 
reading. Eventually, I begin to conceptualize what is happening 
and begin to memorize. After much practice, I don&#x27;t need a sheet 
any more and then improve my speed. This way of learning 
worked for me on the first method I used, I&#x27;m going to try it with 
what you all have shown me. The only problem with this is that it 
takes lots of patience, but on the other hand, there is no real fast 
way to learn any method of solving the cube, especially for the 
beginner.

In response to the color-first method: It sounds good for others 
to copy your moves, but then every time one has to hold the cube 
differently, none of the original colors apply. That&#x27;s why the L2 R 
F deal seems to work well, at least for me. Take them through 
each turn slowly so that they learn the notation through practice. 
Once they get that down, their ability to work alone or more 
independantly will greatly improve. Don&#x27;t forget to make it all fun. 
Taking apart the cube was something that I definately enjoyed at 
first.

Yeah, I agree. I initially show them some examples of turns (eg. what 
it means to turn the red clockwise, or turn the L face clockwise) but 
I agree that it&#x27;s better to let them do the turning. 

I&#x27;ve been trying to get them to understand how the cube moves, and 
not just blindly learn algorithms. Especially since I learnt the F2L 
intuitively, not by reading algorithms. I find this more rewarding so 
I encourage people to try and understand the F2L. Although for 
newbies I get them to do the 1st layer intuitively, and show them an 
algorithm for the second layer. When I solve, I do the cross, then 
the 2 c/e pairs. When I&#x27;m teaching newbies I break down the c/e into 
separate components (cross, each of the 1st layer corners, then each 
of the second layer corners).

So, if we start witht he cross (which I do) I&#x27;ll show them what a 
proper cross looks like (so they know what they&#x27;re aiming for), a few 
examples of how to build an arm of the cross, and then some general 
tips. After that I tell them to have a play around and see what they 
can work out on their own.

Some people &#x27;get it&#x27; after this, some people don&#x27;t. Perhaps I will 
pull a cube apart, and see if that helps.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve found that before showing a new cuber anything, it&#x27;s best to <br>
describe how the centers never move, and then show them the inner <br>
cube.  This helps to extricate the newbie from initial confusion that <br>
could make them loose their will to solve the cube.  <br>
<br>
I then teach them the cross, first layer corners. Then show them how <br>
the middle layer works. And teach them to understand it, not just <br>
learn it.  Lastly, i teach them the last layer, at this point i have <br>
a feeling they dont get it and just memorize, so i try to explain how <br>
to make the cross in the last layer by breaking apart and rebuilding <br>
the F2L. <br>
<br>
Afterwords, i teach them corner permutation, simple 2 corner swap, <br>
w/o messing up oriented edges.  <br>
<br>
Then, Corner orientation, consisting of a 4 move sequence twice, then <br>
the counter of this sequence for the other corner.  Then finally, I <br>
teach them just a 3 swap edge permutation because from this you can <br>
solve any edge permution at all in the last layer.<br>

<br>
First off, good luck getting a tiled megaminx.  I&#x27;m pretty sure they <br>
sell them stickered, now.  I got mine with tiles, but that was at <br>
least a couple years ago.  You may want to send them an e-mail, <br>
asking if they would sell you one tiled, or at the very least sell <br>
you a set of tiles.  They probably won&#x27;t give you a tiled megmainx, <br>
but they used to sell sets of tiles for $12 USD.  Beware, that <br>
whether they sell you a stickered or tiled  megaminx, you will almost <br>
definitely have to readhere/replace the originals.<br>
<br>
That aside, unless they have changed the design since I got mine, <br>
they are great puzzles!  It will most likely be very difficult to <br>
move at first, but with love and patience, it will break in nicely.  <br>
The inner mechanics are similar to a 3x3x3 cube, in that there is a <br>
central &quot;spider&quot; axis, albeit 12 legged instead of 6 legged.  Each <br>
leg holds on a center and is spring loaded.  You take it apart the <br>
same way you would a regular cube.  Mine went through a series of <br>
different lubes, but I&#x27;d think that a good silicone lube and some <br>
good break-in time and it should move well in no time at all.<br>

          <div class="email-content">This is pretty much the same solution as I&#x27;ve been teaching recently. 
I decided on doing it this way because it only requires a few 
algorithms, yet it&#x27;s structured in a way that it can easily be 
developed in to a more advanced method if people are keen, eg. by 
doing the c/e pairs in the F2L, or by learning the other LL edge 
permutations (the &#x27;H&#x27; and &#x27;Z&#x27;), or by learning all 7 LL corner 
orientation algs.

The problem with some &#x27;simple&#x27; methods is that they are not scalable -
 to improve your cubing you have to un-learn much of what you know 
and re-learn it in a different way. This is what happened to me when 
I first learnt the cube back in the 80s (before all the zillions of 
fabulous solution websites!). The method I learnt was really quite a 
terrible method and it took a bit of work to un-learn the entrenched 
method and then learn a decent method. (I now do cross, F2L, orient 
LL edges, orient LL corners, permute all.)

Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d want to do that. They do break quite a lot if you 
can go fast but it&#x27;s usually because the wires come out and get 
tangled with the fingers and snap, cut etc. Lubrication would 
presumably only aid them in sliding out. You should be able to go 
much faster before you hit those problems though as 6-7 seconds is 
possible at a fairly deliberate pace. Back in the 80s we&#x27;d hit 2 
seconds and as someone who is quite pedestrian at dexterous puzzles 
I&#x27;d think there are people who can probably go much faster again. My 
advice is to try and work out the way to move your wrists and hands 
in such a way as to trigger the entire solution from start to end - 
it helps if you are flexible - you should find that you can pick up 
a fair bit of speed without endangering the puzzle.

No way! it&#x27;s only 6 colored!? That would ruin the challenge of the 
puzzle.  Is there anywhere where I can buy a 12 colored one.  I&#x27;ll 
have to email the mefferts people again and ask them too.  Otherwise, 
I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d paint it, I&#x27;d be much too scared to ruin the cube.

How does one paint a puzzle? I mean, what are some general 
precautions you take, and will any paint do?  I dont think I&#x27;d do it, 
unless I really couldnt get a 12 colored minx.

<br>
Don&#x27;t be fooled - the 6 color megaminx has some tricks up its <br>
sleeve.  I have a 12 color minx, and not a 6 color, so I&#x27;m not all <br>
that experienced with it, but I could see how the 6 color minx may <br>
actually be harder.  With the 6 color puzzle, you have 2 main factors <br>
that may make it harder with only 1 factor that is to your advantage.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll start with the single advantage - because similar colors are <br>
directly opposite on the puzzle, you have two of each edge piece.  <br>
Therefore, when you&#x27;re looking for an edge, you can use either of the <br>
two - that makes it a little easier (maybe even a lot).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this quality of having duplicate edge pieces creates a <br>
possible parity problem - 50% of the time, you&#x27;ll have to fix the <br>
parity problem by swapping two identical edges (my alg for that is 18 <br>
moves).<br>
<br>
The more difficult obstacle is that you have 2 corners with each <br>
triplet of colors, but the corners are not identical.  Going around <br>
the corners clockwise, if one is Red-Green-Blue, the other would be <br>
Red-Blue-Green.  So, when you&#x27;re looking for corners, you not only <br>
have to identify the correct set of colors, but you also have to make <br>
sure they&#x27;re correctly oriented on the corner.  This makes life very <br>
difficult.<br>
<br>
&gt; Is there anywhere where I can buy a 12 colored one.  I&#x27;ll have to<br>
&gt; email the mefferts people again and ask them too.<br>
<br>
E-mailing Mefferts is probably just about the only way (if they will <br>
even do it), unless you can find someone else who will sell you <br>
theirs.<br>
<br>
&gt; Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d paint it, I&#x27;d be much too scared to<br>
&gt; ruin the cube.<br>
<br>
Yeah - I have a cube that I do test painting on to try out different <br>
ideas.  My main cube is painted, but the edges are pretty sad - <br>
colors overlapping and all.  I&#x27;ve been playing around with using tape <br>
to give it a straight edge, but just can&#x27;t get it quite right.<br>
<br>
&gt; How does one paint a puzzle? I mean, what are some general <br>
&gt; precautions you take, and will any paint do?  I dont think I&#x27;d do<br>
&gt; it, unless I really couldnt get a 12 colored minx.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d recommend nail polish.  Aside from the fact that I&#x27;m not capable <br>
of painting in a straight line, I think it looks really cool.  It has <br>
the texture of smooth tiles, without the possibility of them falling <br>
off.  First, put on enough coats of color (I do 2-4, depending on the <br>
color/brand) to get the color you want.  After that, put on a couple <br>
coats of a clear &quot;hard as nails&quot; enamel to give it a hard finish.  Be <br>
sure to leave plenty of drying time, and once it&#x27;s dry, stick it in <br>
the oven on very low heat (no more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit) for <br>
20 to 30 minutes - this makes the surface even harder once cooled.  <br>
I&#x27;ve been using this cube for months now, and it still looks like new.<br>

I agree that the 12 color is suitable for a contest, but do not think 
the 6 color is easy, there is an extra problem because you can end 
with two pieces switched in this puzzle (because you have the some 
colors on more than one piece)

This odd permutation needs one extra sequence

Actually it&#x27;s an even permutation (odd permutations are impossible 
in the megaminx as it is generated by even permutations (5-cycles)). 
Although it appears to be switching 2 pieces, actually 3 are 
switched (but 2 look the same). A similar situation occurs in the 
centres of a Revenge - you can only do even permutations of the 
centres as they are generated by double transpositions - but you can 
make it appear like you&#x27;re just switching 2 pieces if you do a 3-
cycle where 2 centres have the same colour.

Averag = 23.62

This is my first time to break the 24s barrier!  I never ever thought 
I&#x27;d be anywhere near this low.  I set the cube down for quite a while 
and picked it back up to start learning OLL algorithms.  I presently 
use the 3 look LL and in the cases where all 4 edges need orienting 
or none of the 4 need orienting, I use the 2 look.  Just have felt 
kind of &quot;on&quot; the last few days.  Anyway, I was excited, had to share!

Daniel

Personal best so far is 18.33 btw, but that was set a while back.

I assume that one only paints a few sides at a time so that they 
don&#x27;t get the polish everywhere?... Also, once the cube is dry and 
put in the oven, does the polish stay solid as to not drip-off or 
come off? (My parents would kill me seeing as our oven is 
brand-new)

No, if you know the 3x3x3 basics for the cross of the last layer, and 
the basic moves for the corners you can solve the megaminx by 
intuition

So make the 5 edge pieces position and orientation, position the 
corners and orientate. You will find that these are almost the 3x3x3 
basic moves. If you start with the corners it is much harder.

Sure you will need megaminx-specific algs for speed sloving

I think this should be enough to have a go for the last layer

Have fun

          <div class="email-content">Ton&#x27;s right, most of the algorithms I still used are 3x3x3 <br>
algorithms.  Mostly from the 4 look LL, whith a few exceptions.  <br>
Grant did show me a couple that were far more efficient, but I had <br>
the whole thing solved without knowing any minx-specific algorithms, <br>
quite a few times.<br>
<br>
My order is a little different from what Ton stated though, so I&#x27;ll <br>
mention it real quick:<br>
OLL edges<br>
PLL edges<br>
OLL corners<br>
PLL corners<br>
<br>
It should be noted that the PLL corners method I use does NOT come <br>
from a 3x3x3 but rather it was just intuitive.  If you&#x27;re interested <br>
in specific algorithms, let me know and I&#x27;ll throw out a few, though <br>
as I said, Grant has quite a few useful (speed enhancing) algorithms <br>
that I have yet to learn.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

That latter shape would be a gnomon.

(In this case the parallelogram would be a rectangle.)

I put the cube on a piece of paper, on a cookie sheet.  This should <br>

I would of paid a couple more dollars for it, but thats about it. I 
think the auction was at about $14 with 3 dollars shipping.  It did 
have 2 cubes with it.  If i really want an impossibal i guess i can 
buy a new one for $18.

Im not under 22 a whole lot, but I can get a handful of them a day.  
Getting a time like that doesn&#x27;t really surprise me like it used 
to.  The times i get happy about are the sub 20 ones.

Speaking of computers, maybe someone could help me out here...(if it&#x27;s not too far off topic...)
 
At work today, I was writing a program (ASP) and it called for an &quot;on error resume next&quot; statement.  For some reason, my code would always return an error.  I cut down the code to see where the problem was until i was running this exact code:
 
On error resume next
If err.number&lt;>0 then
  response.write err.number
  response.end
end if
 
I ran the program, and it still returned an error.  Where I had it display &quot;err.number&quot; it said 0.
 
Anyone have any idea what might be going on here?

I would post this.  This isn&#x27;t cube related at all, however it is a <br>
display of the same dedication that I think we put into the cube, <br>
just for something else.  Anyway I was a huge fan of Nintendo when I <br>
was a kid, I was like 8 when I got my first one.  Anyway I was also <br>
a big fan of the Super Mario brothers games.  Well, and I&#x27;m sure <br>
some of you have seen this already, someone beat the Super Mario <br>
Brothers 3 game in 10 minutes and 59 seconds, 11 minutes basically.  <br>
If you search on google.com for the string &quot;mario 11 minutes&quot; you&#x27;ll <br>
find all kinds of websites that have a link to a video of the kid <br>
doing it.<br>
<br>
Anyway here&#x27;s a direct link to a page with the video,<br>
http://ebaumsworld.com/smb3beat.html<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;ve played the game then this video is absolutely amazing to <br>
watch.  If you haven&#x27;t played the game then it&#x27;s just an amazing <br>
display of a guy who&#x27;s really good at a video game.<br>
<br>
So anyway the board has been pretty quiet lately so I thought I&#x27;d <br>
try to liven things up.  This isn&#x27;t exactly cube related, however I <br>
think it sort of relates to cubing in that I&#x27;m sure this guy had to <br>
practice as dedicated as we do for the cube in order to do this.  So <br>
anyway check it out, I think it&#x27;s totaly amazing.<br>

&gt; watch.  If you haven&#x27;t played the game then it&#x27;s just an amazing <br>
&gt; display of a guy who&#x27;s really good at a video game.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So anyway the board has been pretty quiet lately so I thought I&#x27;d <br>
&gt; try to liven things up.  This isn&#x27;t exactly cube related, however I <br>
&gt; think it sort of relates to cubing in that I&#x27;m sure this guy had to <br>
&gt; practice as dedicated as we do for the cube in order to do this.  So <br>
&gt; anyway check it out, I think it&#x27;s totaly amazing.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That just goes to show that the same type of dedication we put forth<br>

The D-pad and the buttons would have to be controlled by the same hand,<br>

That is pretty cool, although, it teaches you that one can learn to 
perfect nearly anything.  I myself have (actually had) a few world 
records in Goldeneye for N64 (facility in particular 00agent) as well 
as Time splitters 2 for the xbox.  I really got into the TS2 game for 
xbox, and began to submit regular world records, although, many of my 
times were deleted and taken off, since i stopped playing a few 
months ago.  Check it out if you want, there are actually World 
record sites for many games:

http://ngc-elites.net/ts2/index.php


my name was The_Great_Moo, however, i was at 18th place at my peak, 
now since many of my times are gone, and many people have gotten 
better, im at 65th...!

anyway, i set a few world records in that, and let me tell you it 
takes absolute perfection.  If i could rubik&#x27;s cube like i can play 
the &quot;bricking it&quot; mini game in TS2, or play goldeneye, perfectdark... 
etc.  , I&#x27;d be around 14 seconds id say, at the point of utter 
perfection. 

It teaches you something though, and competeing in videogames has 
made me more competitive as far as school work, rubik&#x27;s cubing, and 
basically everything, I even have taking out the garbage down to a 
science, since i do it every week.

Now I only have to convince my parents of this fact. (More games 
means better grades! What a wonderful world this is in which we

The cubes we got at the RWC were the new oddzon cubes.  I&#x27;ve got to 
play with 3 or 4 of these from walmart, Most of them turn really 
nicely (one was pretty stiff even after lubing though).  These dont 
have the screws like the Studio cubes, so there is no way to adjust 
the tension.  Since the cubes are alreday fairly loose, I guess that 
means they will wear out faster.

This and the Tetris both seem quite good (I&#x27;ve never played this, so 
I can&#x27;t really compare them though) - but can do these feats match 
Billy Mitchell&#x27;s dedication at Pac-Man?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone I updated my Rubik&#x27;s Revenge solution to correct any <br>
possible confusion about the parity error moves.  I explain that <br>
the &quot;speed solve&quot; version of the move affects the orientation and <br>
permutation of the last layer.  I did not mention or use any <br>
diagrams to show exactly how it affects the U layer, though in my <br>
speed 4x4x4 solving I use that information to decide which edge I <br>
want to flip, just as a hint for any aspiring 4x4x4 solvers :)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of e-mails where people were confused about that <br>
so I finally cleared it up.  Anyway if you&#x27;re still confused on the <br>
parity move and the speed solve verion check out step 3 of my <br>
solution again.<br>

Today I found this web page: http://www.zetagrid.net<br>
Whilst, it is unlikely to help in settling the Riemann Hypothesis <br>
(it can only do so by proving it is false, contrary to most people&#x27;s <br>
expectations), it, like the Great Internet Mersenne Primes Search <br>
(GIMPS) is getting a lot of data on a problem. In this case over a <br>
billion non-trivial zeros of the zeta function are calculated each <br>
day. It seems to me that a similar project could be used for the <br>
cube group, as I have suggested before. For the cube group, there <br>
are only a finite number of elements, whereas the zeta function has <br>
infinitely many zeros, so in principle the cube group is an easier <br>
problem to tackle (and if you know about the Riemann Hypothesis you <br>
will realize that this is a big understatement).<br>

Are we to assume that this was real time? I couldn&#x27;t even see the 
pieces at the top of the screen! I couldn&#x27;t really tell what level 
(s)he go to, did it say on the screen somewhere?

While speaking of Ton&#x27;s cubes, I was wondering whether I 
should get the Rubik Studio 2003 or wait for the Arxon. Is the 
Arxon way better than the Studio? The Arxon isn&#x27;t available from 
Ton until Feb, while the Studio 2003 is available the 15th. If the 
Arxon is only slightly better than the Studio, I&#x27;ll probably go with 
the Studio for now, for obvious reasons. Anybody know any 
details?

          <div class="email-content">This is definitely in real time. I don&#x27;t know what level specifically
this was, but the game he was playing seemed to be a special build. It&#x27;s
probably something up near level 20. (Yeah, I know it only goes to 15.
That&#x27;s just to put it in perspective. I&#x27;ve seen 15 and it&#x27;s much slower.
(i.e. you can actually see the pieces falling in level 15.) You do the
math.

Yes, those are very INSANE. For the first time, I feel inferior in 
the world of speed-stuff. Though I imagine that it isn&#x27;t much more 
difficult than speedcubing, with an equal amount of practice. It 
just looks like it.

Something like that. Although Euclid had shown that there were 
infinitely many primes, their distribution amongst the integers 
(density) was less well known. The number of primes less than or 
equal to x, pi(x), for instance. Various asymptotics like 
pi(x)~x/(ln x) and then later the pi(x)~li(x), where li(x) is the 
logarithmic integral (better) were looked at. The prime number 
theorem established that they were asymptotically correct (in that 
the ratio tends to 1).
The Riemann hypothesis would give a nice bound on the difference (in 
terms of x) so that |pi(x)-li(x)|=O(sqrt(x)ln(x)).
A lot of results are conditional on the Riemann hypothesis. i.e. 
they are of the form, if the Riemann hypothesis is true then ....
The paper in which he published this hypothesis is, I believe, 
actually Riemann&#x27;s only paper in number theory. In that sense, it&#x27;s 
a paper which has had enormous consequences despite being the only 
paper in the field by its author (somewhat like Cohen&#x27;s paper on 
forcing, though the effect of that paper is perhaps even more 
impressive).

There are lots of possible questions. The main one in terms of the 
Rubik&#x27;s cube would be to find the most moves needed to solve it (the 
diameter) or the average number of moves to solve the cube.
This depends on what you count as a move. For instance, if we allow 
any of the quarter turns (but nothing else) to count as 1 move we&#x27;d 
get one answer. If we also allow half turns to count as 1 move we&#x27;d 
get a (probably different) answer. If we allow moves like FB or FB&#x27; 
to count as one move we&#x27;d get yet another answer. If we only allow 
ourselves a minimal generating set (two moves as opposed to the 
usual 6 quarter moves or 12 quarter and half moves) then we&#x27;d get a 
very much larger answer.
Heuristically, the answer if we allow half turns to count as one 
move would appear to be 20, in that no counter-examples are yet 
known. The group is very big though, so it is conceivable there 
might be a position that required 21 moves etc.
So what is sought is just an answer to what&#x27;s the worst case 
scenario - is it 20 or not? (Superflip is 20 moves, so the answer is 
at least 20.)
With a very large number of machines working on the problem, it 
might be possible to lay an attack, even though the numbers are very 
large. If we only want to know the diameter, then we wouldn&#x27;t need 
to know the optimal move for each position. For instance, if we knew 
that every sequence of 21 moves could actually be done in 20 or less 
then we&#x27;d get that the diameter was 20. Thus, lately, for some of 
the algorithms I have looked at, I have not tried to get the optimal 
solution but just tried to see if they could be done in 20 moves or 
not. Equally, one would only need to do this for each equivalence 
class, which would cut down the work a little.
It&#x27;s still a huge problem, but it&#x27;s not any bigger than Zetagrid (at 
least if the Riemann hypothesis is true) or GIMPS.

Please do! With some pressure on the organisers, there will be an

I usually dont have to warm up too much, just a couple solves 
sometimes maybe around 8.  Sometimes i&#x27;ll even get good times right 
off the bat.  If i do 30-40+ solves in one sitting then my times 
start going down. I usually dont just speedsolve that much in one 
sitting.  I&#x27;ll change it up and just go slow through a few solves, 
or look at some new algs.

          <div class="email-content">If I&#x27;m trying to do a fast average attempt (Sunday contest or just 
for practice) I usually do one or two averages before-hand.  So I 
take about 12-24 cubes to get &quot;in the zone.&quot;  It&#x27;s weird though, 
like Heath sometimes I get really amazing times right off the bat, 
but I usually only get one or two followed by very mediocre to slow 
times until I warm up.

Yesterday I celebrated my first successful blindfold solve.  <br>
HURRAY!!!  It was so fun I just had to do it again tonight to prove <br>
to myself that I wasn&#x27;t just dreaming.  My first ever solve took 26 <br>
minutes - 12 minutes to memorize and then 14 minutes to solve.  The <br>
times can be shortened significantly but I was being extra careful <br>
so I didn&#x27;t slip up.<br>
<br>
Corner Orientation: 1102 0122 (3 moves)<br>
Edge Orientation: 1110 1101 1100 (3 moves)<br>
Corner Permutation: 3286 5741  (4 moves)<br>
Edge Permutation: 1 10 6 3  7 11 8 2  5 4 9 12  (6 moves)<br>
<br>
[I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to write anything down in an official <br>
blindfold solve - so I didn&#x27;t.  But I still had it memorized when I <br>
was done so I wrote it down as a souvenir]<br>
<br>
I just love this version of cubing (I first solved the cube in 1983) <br>
and will definately be doing more of it.  It is so fun to slowly <br>
solve the cube in your head with percision moves affecting only 2 or <br>
3 cubies.  My huge respect to those who can solve a 4x4 and even a <br>
5x5 blindfolded.  And DAVID ORSER solving 10 cubes blindfolded in <br>
under 2 hours (as posted on speedcubing.com) is an amazing feat of <br>
concentration and memorization. <br>
<br>
MANY THANKS TO DR CARR for posting his instructions.  My system <br>
varies slightly from his but was definately inspired by and modeled <br>
on his explanations.  I use a different move for the 1/2 corner <br>
orientation and different moves for three edge cycle.  I also edge <br>
cycle in the top/bottom and front/back (instead of top/bottom and <br>
left/right) which affects the edge orientation analysis.)  His <br>
explanation of how to number and memorize the corners and edges was <br>
extremely helpful. <br>
<br>
I found it easiest to learn the solution in stages.  Thus I started <br>
with a 2x2.  When that was easy I wanted to make sure I could do it <br>
without moving any of the edge pieces around so I would then <br>
scramble my cube, visually solve all the edge pieces and then <br>
blindfold solve the 8 corners around them.  When I could do that I <br>
would then visually solve the corners and then practice solving just <br>
the edge pieces blindfolded.  Finally the synthesis of the corners <br>
and edges.  I like to orient all the pieces first (corners and then <br>
edges) then permute the corners then permute the edges.<br>

<br>
This is how my LL has developed:<br>
I started by orienting corners and one edge, position corners and having a 3-cycle of edges to finish.<br>
<br>
Then I moved to orienting (minimum) one corner while finishing the middle layer.  This made the orienting corners and one edge bit easier.<br>
<br>
Then I oriented (minimum) one corner and (minimum) one edge while finishing the middle layer.  This meant that when i oriented corners i already had an edge oriented.  It cut down the algorithms so much that I moved to flipping the last edges at the same time.  In other words I am orienting the LL in one look.  So I might just as well work out the last couple of position algorithms and do a standard Fridrich 2-look!<br>
<br>
The only difference is orienting a corner and edge while I finish the middle layer.  Which cuts down the orientation algorithms to about 30.<br>

That&#x27;s a good question... I go throughout my day just turning my cube <br>

only one hand.  I guess this must be enough of a warm up, though.  I <br>
usually just sit down and start timing, if I decide to do an <br>

do 5-10 warm-up runs for speed first.<br>

          <div class="email-content">It is kind of funny how you can look back at your old
times and be amazed.  My first sunday contest was
around 90 seconds. (a little over a year ago)  Now I&#x27;m
around 24-25 seconds(when I&#x27;m in practice :P)  seems
like the barriers to break for me were:
90 seconds-doesn&#x27;t take much
60 seconds-broken after practice of inefficient method
40 seconds-broken after learning 4-look &amp; f2l
30 seconds-broken after learning 3-look
25 seconds-broken after revising f2l

I&#x27;m not really sure what the next barrier is going to
be.  The closer you get to zero, the closer the
barriers get to each other.  I&#x27;m probably looking at
sub23 next.

Hmmm.... My parents used to have one of those - I&#x27;ll have to see if <br>
they still do and try it.  If I figured it out right, it&#x27;s 127 moves <br>
for 7 discs moved optimally, so that&#x27;d be roughly 3.3 seconds per <br>
move (7 minutes)... Sounds beatable, as long as your posts are well <br>

I guess that&#x27;s confirmation. Soon, you will probably find it fairly

The Duane Cash cubes are some simple modification, I do not know any 
one that got a Duane Cash cube. This because most puzzle 
builder/collectors build there one version. So I have seen these 
puzzles because I builded some of them myself. see 
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Building.htm

My opinion is that the Rubik&#x27;s Triamese Cubes is a nice new puzzle 
with some extra puzzle challenges. These modification are not 
intended for speedcubing, I gues thats the part about fragile. The 
puzzle are builded from orginal Rubiks.com cube so the quality should 
be good.

So If you like to buy a modification I could recommend the Rubik&#x27;s 
Triamese Cube

I sure hope foot cubing will be an official category at the next WC. <br>
More people should try this because IMHO it&#x27;s not that difficult. <br>
The impotant thing is a solution with not very many moves (mine <br>
averages well over 60) and there are many people with better methods <br>
that I think could easily break my record. My current goal is sub 2 <br>
minutes. I think I&#x27;ll solving other puzzles with my feet such as <br>

          <div class="email-content">One of my friends from high school, who I used to cube with a lot, 
had a wooden tower of Hanoi puzzle (I think it was 6 discs).  Anyway 
I remember we used to race eachother on it, though I don&#x27;t remember 
our times.  It&#x27;s kind of easy once you know the routine though, sort 
of like cup stacking in that you do the same thing every time, 
however it was still a lot of fun I thought.  That&#x27;s cool, I didn&#x27;t 
know someone else speed tower of hanoi&#x27;d (wow that&#x27;s the weirdest 
speed-something word I&#x27;ve ever heard/used) :)

Also that&#x27;s a good average for the Cube!  Getting past the 40&#x27;s is 
kind of annoying, at least it was for me, but once you do you 
remember how to do it fairly consistently with a little practice.

Does Petrus also have a method for the Towers of Hanoi? I&#x27;d have 
thought the algorithmic method is the only one to be used for speed. 
I&#x27;m sure you can get back to 7 minutes as 40 seems rather slow.

Of course, really you should play with 64 discs - that&#x27;s the 
classical number. (Of course, with 65 discs the number of moves 
required is closest to the number of positions of the Rubik cube.)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Heath,

   The arched underside to the center cube is part of the new tooling.
That arched Oddzon was simply the new model. This underside arch,
which completes the internal circle, was a design feature from the
very beginning, but only put into production 4 or 5 times.

   The early cubes were hard to turn. I think the underside was
flattened to reduce internal friction, (and I think to save money).
But they pop apart easily.

   As different plastics became available, like the harder, slicker
plastic of the Deluxe, they could make the underside of the center
arched again.

  The new one are pretty good.

   OK.

   The density problem is very cool to chew on. Years ago I looked for
a quick way to test a number to see if it was prime. But I only
briefly approached the density problem, and from the other side, so to
speak.
   Consider all positive integers as points on a short, but very long
graph, starting with the number 2, make it a wave that intersects
every other point, then the number three make a wave intersecting
every third point, then the number 5, then 7 and so forth. I was
looking for the density of the non-prime numbers.
   One useful observation is that perhaps some version of an equation
like 1 - 1/2 - 1/3 - 1/5 could be employed to give the density
directly. Am I making sense?

   For notation I count all moves as one, including slices, and
allowing half turns for computer programs may help simplify scrambling
programs, but mathematically I see the need for quarter turns to be
the standard.

  I know the number of turns needed to reach any position optimally,
using quarter turns, is greater than 17. :^)

  My question is, if you can make any of 12 moves as the first turn,
if you allow duplication then 12 moves is possible for each turn
after... 2 (12 ^ 17) is only slightly larger than the 43 quintilion
possiblilites.  Can you calculate the density of duplicate positions
and find the minimun number of turns to reach every position?

   Why not start with corner positions? Isn&#x27;t the 2x2x2 solved?

   Thanks for answering my questions. I appreciate it.

Hana, if you post the link I&#x27;d probably be able to help a little 
more.  Buffering means your media playback program is gathering data 
onto your local computer. A video file generally has large amount of 
data organized in terms of frames (sort of like film).  If your 
internet connection is slow the program has to buffer a number of 
frames to your local machine before start playing it otherwise the 
movie will look jerky and sound will be out of sync.  Since the 
buffer rans out pretty quickly, the program will have to do something 
like play-buffer-play etc. very annoying.  A better way is to simply 
download (if it&#x27;s allowed) the video file to your machine first then 
play it.  To download using Internet Exporer, right click on the link 
and select Save Target As, follow the instructions you should be able 
to get it.  Hope that helps.

          <div class="email-content">Hmmm... I wasn&#x27;t thinking on something of that large of a scale for now.  Are there 
people around who would be up for just a smaller local type meeting?  If there was 
enough interest, we could make things regular.  I&#x27;m leaving for winter break but I&#x27;ll be 
back in the area in early January so I was thinking maybe a Sunday afternoon in 
January or something?  It&#x27;ll also give me some time to publicize around.

Possibly, if we had enough people and the resources, maybe we could pull off a larger 
type tournament in the summer.  It is an off year afterall... 

And as for the Athenuem... wow... that would be really cool.  I have no idea about how 
to get that place though... it would probably involve a lot of money.

I think there would be more algorithms involved that way.  And 
beginners usually dont want to have to learn very many algs at 
first.  Though when i teach people i  have them orient in 2 looks 
and permute in 2 looks, and they only have to know 4 algs to do 
this.  The only catch is they have to repete the algs a few times in 
some cases.

but yeah, I agree with you. I never really thought about that 
before.  I guess its just easier to understand at first that way 
maybe???

  Related to this does anyone remember were the number of algs for
each pair of 2 look strategies can be found? 

a  1. Permute and orient corners
   2. Permute and orient edges

b  1. Orient corners and edges
   2. Permute corners and edges

c  1. Permute corners and edges 
   2. Orient corners and edges

d  1. Permute corners and orient edges
   2. Permute edges and orient corners

e  1. Permute edges and orient corners

          <div class="email-content">I guess there is maybe a clarity problem too. I guess it&#x27;s easier for a beginner to understand how a simple Sune works, or better said why it works, than for example Fridrich&#x27;s 1st U permutation, which moves much more different faces. So it seems to me (at least it seemed so when I first learned cubing) that the simpler the alg is, the easier it is to understand and to memorize. I think how long it is doesn&#x27;t really matter (unless it&#x27;s &quot;really&quot; long ;-) ), if it&#x27;s still &quot;understandable&quot;. and that&#x27;s why you always have a LL done that way (or any equivalent way) in a beginner&#x27;s method: OE (6 to 10 moves depending on the alg used, but always simple algs), which usually doesn&#x27;t affect corners, but moves edges around, then PE, using Sune (only R and U moves) once or twice, which affects corners position AND orientation, then PC, which affects their orientation but can be done using only U, R and L (for example R L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) and then OC, doing combos of Sune&#x27;s or mirrors or<br>
 whatever... you&#x27;ll also see that a beginner NEVER moves B and D faces for the LL, because he won&#x27;t understand why he should turn these faces (especially the D face) to move pieces on the U face... and the B face is really kind of far from your body, so you have to burn some calories to reach it lol...<br>
Also, I&#x27;ve seen that an alg isn&#x27;t really &#x27;learnable&#x27; without working on finger tricks, especially alg&#x27;s that use every face of the cube. That&#x27;s the case of almost every permutation or orientation alg, so a beginner who isn&#x27;t really sure of the way he holds the cube or turn the faces can easily get lost by all the moves those alg&#x27;s require. And, a beginner hardly knows finger tricks =)...<br>
Am I right, or is what I&#x27;m saying in bad English just totally wrong ?!!!<br>
François<br>

PS: Oh, and BTW there are 2 guys who invented a while ago a very good beginner&#x27;s method, called ZB method... Anyone wants to teach it to some beginner?<br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
&gt;    OK.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    The density problem is very cool to chew on. Years ago I looked <br>
for<br>
&gt; a quick way to test a number to see if it was prime. But I only<br>
&gt; briefly approached the density problem, and from the other side, <br>
so to<br>
&gt; speak.<br>
&gt;    Consider all positive integers as points on a short, but very <br>
long<br>
&gt; graph, starting with the number 2, make it a wave that intersects<br>
&gt; every other point, then the number three make a wave intersecting<br>
&gt; every third point, then the number 5, then 7 and so forth. I was<br>
&gt; looking for the density of the non-prime numbers.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s known as the sieve of Erastosthenes.<br>
<br>
&gt;    One useful observation is that perhaps some version of an <br>
equation<br>
&gt; like 1 - 1/2 - 1/3 - 1/5 could be employed to give the density<br>
&gt; directly. Am I making sense?<br>
<br>
That sum diverges to -infinity. The one in the other post doesn&#x27;t <br>
really work as density either because the sum is not absolutely <br>
convergent, so the order in which terms are added affects the <br>
answer. In fact, since it isn&#x27;t absolutely convergent but only <br>
conditionally convergent, any answer can be achieved by adding in <br>
different orders. Since the density is looking at the limit of <br>
pi(x)/x, there&#x27;s no particular reason to look at adding 1/6 before <br>
subtracting 1/5 etc.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; There are lots of possible questions. The main one in terms of <br>
the <br>
&gt; &gt; Rubik&#x27;s cube would be to find the most moves needed to solve it <br>
(the <br>
&gt; &gt; diameter) or the average number of moves to solve the cube.<br>
&gt; &gt; This depends on what you count as a move. For instance, if we <br>
allow <br>
&gt; &gt; any of the quarter turns (but nothing else) to count as 1 move <br>
we&#x27;d <br>
&gt; &gt; get one answer. If we also allow half turns to count as 1 move <br>
we&#x27;d <br>
&gt; &gt; get a (probably different) answer. If we allow moves like FB or <br>
FB&#x27; <br>
&gt; &gt; to count as one move we&#x27;d get yet another answer. If we only <br>
allow <br>
&gt; &gt; ourselves a minimal generating set (two moves as opposed to the <br>
&gt; &gt; usual 6 quarter moves or 12 quarter and half moves) then we&#x27;d <br>
get a <br>
&gt; &gt; very much larger answer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    For notation I count all moves as one, including slices, and<br>
&gt; allowing half turns for computer programs may help simplify <br>
scrambling<br>
&gt; programs, but mathematically I see the need for quarter turns to be<br>
&gt; the standard.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;   I know the number of turns needed to reach any position <br>
optimally,<br>
&gt; using quarter turns, is greater than 17. :^)<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s also true of half turns. In fact, I have read that <br>
at least half the positions need at least 18 moves (with half turns).<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;   My question is, if you can make any of 12 moves as the first <br>
turn,<br>
&gt; if you allow duplication then 12 moves is possible for each turn<br>
&gt; after... 2 (12 ^ 17) is only slightly larger than the 43 quintilion<br>
&gt; possiblilites.  Can you calculate the density of duplicate <br>
positions<br>
&gt; and find the minimun number of turns to reach every position? <br>
<br>
Well, one thing is that you can discount a lot of things e.g. RR&#x27;, <br>
RLR can be made shorter (or in quarter turns RLR and RRL are the <br>
same at least). So, for instance you can insist that DU never occurs <br>
by replacing by UD etc. Thus 12^17 is very much an overestimate of <br>
the number of positions that can be reached in 17 moves.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    Why not start with corner positions? Isn&#x27;t the 2x2x2 solved?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    Thanks for answering my questions. I appreciate it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; David J<br>
<br>
The 2x2x2 is indeed solved. Of course, moves that solve the 2x2x2 <br>
don&#x27;t necessarily only solve corners in the 3x3x3. For instance, <br>
some corner orientation moves in the 3x3x3 need 18 moves (half turn) <br>
but the 2x2x2 can always be done in 11 moves (half turn).<br>
<br>
(I have got all the optimal algorithms for just orienting corners or <br>
just moving corners (without orientating) though.)<br>

   I wonder how many people have thought of it since he did.

  So that&#x27;s what you call that aspect. HMMM I was hoping that there
might already be a technique for diping into an equation that contains
an infinity, like plugging in a prime and getting a rough idea as to
where the next prime might fall.

   I don&#x27;t quite follow. If 2 takes out every other number and three
takes out every third number, then all the numbers divisible by 6 are
accounted for twice.

   I didn&#x27;t mean unique positions, just positions reached by unique
movement patterns. I&#x27;ve several algs for one corner swap. I know there
is a lot of duplication. Yeah, I know one out of every 12 moves undoes
the previous one.

   How can that be? The most half turns need to move centers around is
4, so 11 + 4 = 15 not 18. What am I missing here? Plus don&#x27;t you have
opportunities in many of those 11 move solves to move a center by
moving the opposite side?

          <div class="email-content">If by original Rubik, you mean that it has the Rubik&#x27;s logo and
everything, then yes, it does.  As far as I could tell, it was (on the
exterior) practically identical to the Toys R Us cube.  That cube had
the Rubik&#x27;s logo as well.

Well, it&#x27;s before twice the current prime. (i.e. for any prime p 
there is a prime q with p&lt;q&lt;2p)

Yes, but if you add things up in a different order you can get a

Some move the edges too? I meant just for solving corners alone when

Not yet - saving them for BCFSSS! I will say this: of the 20160 
orientation preserving corner permutations 636 take the maximum 
number of moves with half turns (16). The first according to the 
numbering scheme I am using is number 1029 which is the product of 
two transpositions and a 3-cycle:
B2 L2 B2 D B2 D&#x27; L2 F2 D L2 D&#x27; F2 U B2 R2 U&#x27; (2 4)(3 8)(5 6 7)

Of the 2187 corner orientations, 32 take the maximum number of moves 
with half turns. (18)
The first one is number 451:

D2 R2 B2 U&#x27; B2 D U B R2 F2 U B2 U2 F R2 B2 U&#x27; F //451

Of course, I&#x27;d prefer to go with quarter turns, but since I&#x27;m using 
Cube Explorer to get my algorithms and it does half turns that&#x27;s 
what I&#x27;m stuck with.

Everyone who can do judo/karate really well seems to be Dan too. At 
first there was just one of them, but then there was the 2nd Dan and 
the 3rd Dan etc.
Of course, there&#x27;s also Dan Inosanto of Jeet Kune Do (etc.) reknown. 
(See for instance the nunchaku duel in Game Of Death.)
Perhaps Dan is a good name for people who can fight well.

I think he already had that (see 8035). Perhaps the problem is with 
the fact that adding things up in different orders can yield 
different results, so that it depends where you add the 1/6 back in 
for instance. (Not specifically the 1/6, but the point is that if 
you take permutations sigma, tau of the summands here then the sums 
sum sigma(n) and sum tau(n) may be different. Indeed, for instance, 
there will be a permutation where they sum to pi, which of course 
can&#x27;t be interpreted as a density. Similarly there will be another 
permutation where they sum to -53+e, which also can&#x27;t be interpreted 
as a density. Also, for some permutations the sum will not converge, 
but will rather diverge and so on. It&#x27;s not the most intuitive of 
results.)

I think he already had that (see 8035). Perhaps the problem is with 
the fact that adding things up in different orders can yield 
different results, so that it depends where you add the 1/6 back in 
for instance. (Not specifically the 1/6, but the point is that if 
you take permutations sigma, tau of the summands here then the sums 
sum sigma(n) and sum tau(n) may be different. Indeed, for instance, 
there will be a permutation where they sum to pi, which of course 
can&#x27;t be interpreted as a density. Similarly there will be another 
permutation where they sum to -53+e, which also can&#x27;t be interpreted 
as a density. Also, for some permutations the sum will not converge, 
but will rather diverge and so on. It&#x27;s not the most intuitive of 
results.)

Ah yes. Good point. I think more on the blindfold side of things 
where the one side doesn&#x27;t affect the other.

GoD2:<br>
<br>
&gt; Can you confirm that it isn&#x27;t as difficult as you thought it was <br>
&gt; going to be?<br>
<br>
<br>
Rob: happily.  (I can tell from your posts that you yourself clearly <br>
already know this).  I think it is well within the reach of the <br>
talent of this board.  I hope I have a simple suggestion that will <br>
make it easier for some people to learn.<br>
<br>
In some ways I think that blindfolding is like learning a forgeign <br>
language.  Let me expand: Generally speaking the most difficult <br>
language for most people to learn is their second.  This is because <br>
few people fully understand how their native tongue really works <br>
until they have a second (3rd, 4th,...) language to compare and <br>
contrast.  Thus when they learn their second language they end up <br>
learning 2 things at once - (a) a new language and (b) how their own <br>
language works.  Similarly with blindfold cubing people are learning <br>
2 things at once: (a) how to keep track of the pieces in their mind <br>
and (b) a different style of solution.  <br>
<br>
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND IT MUCH EASIER TO LEARN if they first <br>
practiced and familiarised themselves with the solution style with <br>
their eyes open before attempting it blindfolded.  That way they <br>
would only have to contend with following the pieces in their mind <br>
along a famiiar route instead of trying to mentally follow the <br>
pieces while learning a new solution.  <br>
<br>
- First learn how to orient all corners to the top and bottom (VERY <br>
EASY).  Then practice moving the corners around without changng any <br>
of the edge pieces.  Then practice orienting all the edge pieces <br>
(again very easy).  Then learn how to manoever the edge pieces <br>
without changing any of the corners.  This method can be learnt and <br>
mastered WITH YOUR EYES OPEN.  Then and only then put the blindfold <br>
on and try to solve it in your head.  Don&#x27;t try to learn this new <br>
method while blindfolded - who would have ever considered learning <br>
how to solve the Petrus or Friedrich technique with their eyes <br>
closed???<br>
<br>
I hope this helps people.  Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t know this while I <br>
was learning it so I had to figure it all out in my head as I went <br>
along, but as they say: &quot;hindsight is 20/20&quot; and it all seems so <br>
obvious to me now.  Hopefully others can learn from my experience <br>
and learn it an easier way!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, the 40 seconds refers to my average.

But the lower you get...the harder it gets to get lower...it&#x27;s
definately a x^2 kind of graph in how hard it is to get better...until
you reach infinity....lol.  Whatever...I know I still have a lot of
work to catch up to you all for the next rubiks WC...when will that be
anyway?

After i finish the PLLs...i only have like 3 to do..but i just keep
pushing it off, I think i may work on transitioning to the Fridrich
method, although, I&#x27;m not sure yet, or I may work on developing some
kind of fridrich/petrus hybrid, because I really like the 2x2x2, and
then i could place the last edge and other two things....or as a 2x2x2
block and an f2l pair or something....actually...i&#x27;m sure it has
probably been done...but we&#x27;ll see.  Anyway, I&#x27;d like to thank Lars
Peturs, Dan Knights, and Jessica Fridrich...my inspirations to get
good at cubing.



//Now that I&#x27;m past all of the thankings and the sentimentality, back
to Tower of Hanoi

I know that&#x27;s a really slow time, I need to work on the algorith
though...I would keep getting lost in the middle of the big stacks,
and undo what i was moving...it&#x27;s a little confusing, because
basically you&#x27;re just trying to think recursively.  I&#x27;m sure I can
beat that...maybe I&quot;ll post it on speedcubing.com....if they let
me...I mean it&#x27;s not quite cubing, and easily beatable...but then I
could be first at something.  I&#x27;m sure that 7 minutes will be easily
beaten though...It&#x27;s just getting the pattern down, cuz it&#x27;s very
intuitive for the first 3, or 4, maybe 5...but after that, it gets
kind of confusing, because you&#x27;re keeping track of 7 things.  Someone
said something about getting the 7 move optimal solution for
3....that&#x27;s pretty easy...but the optimal solution will always be
solution=2^(number of discs) - 1

I&#x27;m curious...how mnay of you out there are computer science
people...and how many are music people...and who are both?

Where y is the time in seconds to solve the cube, and x is the number <br>

formula=36.38  day 399, 32.52 formula=28.64.  Okay, okay it&#x27;s not <br>
exact, but with as scattered as the data points are, it&#x27;s the best <br>
I&#x27;ve come up with yet. Today is around day 530. And the neat thing <br>

predicts a 20 second average, by day 807, a 16s average, by day 2754 <br>
(7.5 years from now) a 1s average... oh wait, that probably isn&#x27;t <br>
right. <br>

          <div class="email-content">An antenna cube would look really cool. It would be simple too make, 
too, just get some sort of foam and carve a cube out of it, then 
paint the sides.
I don&#x27;t know about any cube bumper stickers, though, those might be 
harder to find.

          <div class="email-content">Placed an order some week ago and it just arrived. Had good 
communication regarding items out of stock and so too, so for me it 
was an all good experience.

Btw. I&#x27;ve only played with each puzzle about an hour, and the 
megaminx was an easy solve since it was just like a 3*3*3 cube with 
a few extra corners. Still haven&#x27;t got a clue about the skewb and 
the ultimate skewb though. I guess thats just because it&#x27;s a bit 
different from the rubik puzzles. I won&#x27;t look on Jaap&#x27;s page until 
I&#x27;ve solved them at least once on my own though.

PS. The pyramorphix wasn&#x27;t too hard ;) DS.

I picked up a Canadian Brass CD in Austin a few days ago, and I&#x27;ve been<br>
jamming to that :) I&#x27;ll have to get out my RAtM cd&#x27;s though and try<br>
cubing to that.  Congrats on breaking your PB, I have lots of catching<br>

          <div class="email-content">I just got finished, and my times did go waay down. Listening to 
California Sky by Unwritten Law, I got 23 seconds. 23 is actually my 
average, but as I said before, my fingers are cold and stiff.
The Flight of the Bumblebee gave me 21 seconds, and I think it would 
have been sub-20 if I hadn&#x27;t popped.
With White Noise I got 22, another good time.

So I think that music is definitely connected. It probably just 
clears your mind and lets you focus more.

Oh, and in case anyone&#x27;s wondering, listening to bagpipes I got 35 
seconds. Darn those scotsmen.

          <div class="email-content">I usually just have whatever is playing at the moment though... I must say, sometimes 
the clicking of the spinning of the cube is quite soothing.  Almost like a type of a 
music.

Oh... and if you&#x27;re going to try classical... the Mendelssohn Octet is the way to go.

Cool idea!
If it&#x27;s going to be held at Caltech, I can probably get about 5 guys 
from my middle school and the high school to come and compete.
There are 2 guys averaging around 50, and 2 more sub-60.

          <div class="email-content">Yes their new web forms are not too reliable. To answer the other 
guy&#x27;s question, I have just recieved a new 4x4 from them yesterday. 
It took about 2 weeks to ship. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of 
their Eastsheen 4x4... I just lubed it and set a new PB of 2:23! I&#x27;m 
still looking for the illusive algorithm to fix both parity problems 
symutaneously though. The internal mechanism is quite suprising... I 
took it apart and it broke off into 120 pieces, not counting screws! 
Reassembling it was a bit challenging.

As for their service, I think it&#x27;s always been bad, at least for me. 
But I think it has gotten better this past year.

I&#x27;m very much out of practice but I just did 7 seconds on 
oinkleburger for the edge flip and 3 seconds for switch 2 edges. I 
think with practice and a better mouse a much better time is 
possible.

Assuming you don&#x27;t get either of the above situations not much 
difference. You may have to have a split second to realize that you 
don&#x27;t need to fix anything but other than that it&#x27;s the same puzzle 
so the main issue is that it is easier to break a 4x4x4! I guess I&#x27;m 
probably faster on a 4x4x4 when I get to this stage for two reasons:

1) The centres are bigger so I am less likley to put the cross in 
the wrong order.
2) I can build part of the 3x3x3 up whilst solving the centres.

Another benefit for me is that, since I usually need two 
orientations sometimes, if I need to flip an edge, I can get myself 
to a one step orientation (as there is a choice of edges to flip) 
and so not take up much more time than if I didn&#x27;t have to flip an 
edge but needed to orient in two steps.
It&#x27;s difficult to know what you mean by &quot;modified centers&quot;, so I 
can&#x27;t add much there. Try to flip the edge at the start of the LL 
and switch the edges before PLL (if you need to do these steps).

Not sure if our methods are the same. I&#x27;d guess that on a good day 
on oinkleburger (it&#x27;s been a while since I had one of those) I could 
get the centres solved and edges paired in 35-40 seconds, because 
usually the 3x3x3 on oinkleburger would take me over 30 seconds so 
for a sub-70 solve I&#x27;d probably be in that area.

My guess is that you can probably pick up a bit of time on the 
centres, depending on which way you do them. Which way do you pair 
up the edges? I try to get 3 done at a time for the first 6 and then 
2 at a time for the next 4 (and hope that I don&#x27;t have just 2 left 
as that is a bit more time consuming).

          <div class="email-content">Doug, good to see you getting into the 4x4, it&#x27;s a very fun puzzle!  
I took some averages of my steps, and here&#x27;s what I got.

Centers:
15.73 17.82 27.06 14.17 16.52 21.52 20.97 23.40 19.69 20.63 12.84 
23.87 = 19.43

Edges:
40.65 (27.30) 31.48 38.12 37.22 31.06 45.08 37.92 35.33 40.67 43.06 
(56.12) = 38.06

Solve as a 3x3x3
[39.74(o)] 36.55(-) 32.82(-) 27.57(-) 37.51(p) 33.83(p) 32.40(o) 
37.33(o) 28.72(-) [23.80(-)] 33.66(o) 29.76(p) = 33.02

(p) means I ran into the permutation parity and (o) means I ran into 
the orientation parity.  (-) means a normal 3x3x3 solve.  I had no 
double parities this average.

Personally I find that most of the variation in my times comes from 
the edges step, slowest time 56.12 and fastest 27.30.  I&#x27;m still 
working hard on trying to improve that, but personally that is where 
I lose most of my time.  From your information it seems it takes you 
around 40 seconds to solve the edges, which is what I pull too.  I 
would guess then that you&#x27;re probably losing your time on the 
centers step and segmented 3x3x3 step.  Also around 15 seconds for 
the orientation parity is a lot of time to add when it comes up.  
You might want to try this move for the parity, it is much easier to 
perform quickly.

(R ² r ²) B ² U ² (L l) U ² (R&#x27; r &#x27;) U ² (R r) U ² F ² (R r) F ² 
(L &#x27; l &#x27;) B ² (R ² r ²)
Each pair of moves in parenthesis can be performed at the same time.

I took an average doing this move and I average between 6 and 6.5 
seconds to perform this speed solve move, so maybe this move might 
help.  If you&#x27;re already using this move, then I would just 
recommend finding the fastest way to perform it for your hands.  I 
find it hard to use finger tricks for this move on the 4x4x4, so I 
would recommend mostly using the fastest type wrist turns you can 
find that fit your hands.

To help with solving it as a 3x3x3 I recommend just scrambling it as 
a 3x3x3 and solving it - a lot.  After a while your hands get used 
to the different feel and you start to feel just like your solving a 
3x3x3 when you do it, though of course it is still a bit slower 
because it is harder to trigger faces, at least for me.

Also I&#x27;ve gotten some very fast times on the Eastsheen cubes, but I 
find it a little annoying that they stick if they&#x27;re not really well 
aligned.  It is much easier to perform finger tricks on an Eastsheen 
though.  I&#x27;m still trying to so see which cube I like better, 
rubiks.com or Eastsheen since both seem to have pros and cons.

Anyway, like any cube I would just recommend a lot of practice to 
improve.  I guess just work on getting used to where the centers go, 
so you can do the centers quickly.  Also practice solving the 
centers for fewest moves (no timer) to get used to different 
strategies that help save time.  Then just try to get your hands 
used to doing the 4x4x4 as a 3x3x3 since it moves different than a 
normal 3x3x3.  Just by doing that I think you could easily get under 
2 min on average, not just as a pb.

Good luck to you, and I know you&#x27;ll make it under 2 min.

Happy cubing,
Chris

I suck at the centers, takes me forever, very rare that it&#x27;s under a 
minute
question:
how do you start your centers, do you always start with the same 
color? then do the reverse side etc...or do you just do what you see 
first?

Oh right, both the red/blue/green corner and the centers together <br>

          <div class="email-content">I can assert to this as well. Music helps me concentrate a lot better,
both when I&#x27;m cubing, and while I&#x27;m playing Tetris, pertaining to the
recent posts about it. (I can do it quite well, but nowhere near as good
as that guy in the video ^-^) Often while I&#x27;m listening to certain music
that I particularly enjoy I do both a lot better, and with sometimes
much less thinking than I realize.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m interested in Chris&#x27;s answer to this one, but just as a 
comparison, I start with where ever I see the most of one color 
done. If I see 3 reds together I start there first and plan out how 
to do finsh red while leaving myself in a good situation for the 
opposite color. I do opposite colors together, I find it gives me a 
lot of flexiblity. I can get the first pair of centers in a few 
seconds, and doing the 3rd one is then very easy. I&#x27;m trying to get 
used to the situations for the last center pair.

I think I do it this way because I&#x27;m using a 4x4 with a color scheme 
I&#x27;m not used to... I always was a few seconds thinking about the 
placement of the last two centers relative to the others and still 
occasioanlly make mistakes that I have to fix when I&#x27;m doing the 
cross for the 3x3. And yes, I said CROSS. Not that there&#x27;s anything 
wrong with it, but it&#x27;s just not how I usually solve a 3x3. It seems 
that right after edge pairing, I PANIC and revert to doing a 
Fridrich F2L. That&#x27;s something I need to work on. When I get more 
used to the color scheme, I&#x27;ll probably start doing what Chris does 
and solve centers in such a way that the last two are adjecent to 
each other. If it was my own color-scheme I could do Akimoto&#x27;s 
method on it or at least be more comfortable solving the segmented 
3x3. I have 3 4x4 cubes, and only one I re-schemed. It is currently 
broken.

I want to average under 2:30 with the center/edge/3x3 method first 
then work on Akimoto method again. (Sort of doing what Gilles does 
with being fluent with multiple methods.)

I got a few more days of finals then I can go back to cubing, 
hardcore! I see all these people improving and getting faster then 
me while I have been stuck floating just above 20s for the past 4 
month. (It seems like and eternaty.) I guess my time arn&#x27;t supposed 
to go down when I&#x27;m trying new stuff and learning new algorithms, so 
I&#x27;ve decided to stop doing that for now... I can still improvise a 
good Z-B c/e pairing sometimes without learning all of the algs.

The first item on my to do list is to get sub-30 on solving centers.

Hey Doug (and ther 4x4x4 enthousiasts),<br>
<br>
For both the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 I start with the centers and I start <br>
with the same approach to the centers.  I basically follow CHRIS&#x27; <br>
approach for both 4x4x4 and 5x5x5  [[thanks for the notes on <br>
speedcubing.com Chris]]  and I don&#x27;t claim to have &#x27;invented&#x27; the <br>
following sequence for solving the centers.  In fact, I am sure that <br>
many others out there do something very similar.  I just find that <br>
it works well for me.  Both my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes have <br>
the &#x27;standard&#x27; (?) colour scheme - ie. white/yellow, blue/green, and <br>
red/orange.<br>
<br>
(i) I start with whatever colour happens to be most advantageous<br>
--- For example - WHITE  (but it could be ANY colour)<br>
(ii) I then solve its opposite.  I like this because it still leaves <br>
me a ton of flexibility in the &#x27;middle&#x27; (ie - the u and d slices) of <br>
the cube since I keep my two solved sides on the U and D faces.<br>
--- For example - YELLOW (and ONLY yellow)<br>
(iii) I solve whatever is most avantageous of the remaining four <br>
sets of centers.   *** note of interest - it usually takes me fewer <br>
moves to solve the third center set that it does the second center <br>
set.  This is not really supprising since the second set has a <br>
predetermined colour and location but the third center set takes <br>
advantage of the flexibility of the &#x27;middle&#x27; rows.<br>
--- For example BLUE  (but could equally be GREEN, RED, or ORANGE)<br>
(iv) I then solve one of the two adjacent &#x27;middle&#x27; centers.  To be <br>
totally clear - if my first center is U and its opposite is D.  Let <br>
the third center be F (though it could be held in L,R, or B whatever <br>
you prefer) but if it is in F then the fourth will be either L or R <br>
whichever is easier.  I find this makes the last step easier.  Of <br>
course, there is nothing to prevent you from solving the opposite to <br>
the third center (ie B) but that would mean that when solving the <br>
fifth and sixth centers you are dealing with opposite faces of the <br>
cube.  If your fourth center is adjacent to your third then the <br>
fifth and sixth centers will also be adjacent to each other and I <br>
find that this helps with both recognition and move economy (quarter <br>
turns instead of half turns).  On the 4x4 the centers flow freely <br>
all around the mechanism.  I pause for just a split second at the <br>
start of step (iv) to figure out which colour belongs here (since <br>
you already know U,D,and F it is easy to figure out what belongs in <br>
L or R).  Once this is figured out the fifth and sixth centers are <br>
no-brainers (the opposites of three and four respectively).  If you <br>
solve the fourth opposite the third then you simply postpone this <br>
ESSENTIAL recognition one step.<br>
--- For example - RED (But it could equally be ORANGE)<br>
(v) solve the fifth and sixth centers (simultaneously - obviously)<br>
--- For example - GREEN and ORANGE<br>
<br>
Using this approach I can easily solve the centers between 30 - 35 <br>
secs (and there is definately room for improvement there as I am not <br>
turning my fragile 4x4 at warp speed).  Some notes I took indicate <br>
that this scheme takes me approximately 28 - 34 moves to complete.<br>
<br>
Some center tips that I find useful:<br>
- it is often easier to unite pairs of center cubies and then join 2 <br>
pairs to make a soloved center.<br>
- as you slide your second pair in to complete your first center <br>
have a quick look at its opposite face to see if any cubies are <br>
already correctly placed<br>
- similarly as you slide the second pair of cubies into the third <br>
set of centers see if you can get a headstart on the fourth set.<br>
- I have found no advantage to starting with a particular center <br>
colour.  I do always start my 3x3x3 solves with a white cross to <br>
make F2L recognition easier but since the centers deal with <br>
monocromatic tiles there is no recognition advantage to sarting with <br>
white centers.  By the time I get to solving the 4x4x4 as a 3x3x3 I <br>
do start with a white cross.<br>
<br>
<br>
I find that what slows me down most on the 4x4 and 5x5 is <br>
(FINDING!!!) and uniting those elusive edge pieces.  [[though many <br>
thanks to GRANT for posting some VERY HELPFUL tips for uniting the <br>
9 - 12 edge pairs.  - definately worth a check through the archives <br>
for these if you are interested in 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 times]]<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have also experimented with a different approach to 4x4 centers <br>
but it didn&#x27;t work out so I scrapped it.  Basically, I thought it <br>
may be easier to initially solve the centers into 12 pairs of 2 <br>
center cubies (because this could quickly take maximum advantage of <br>
common colours on adjacent faces) and then unite the relevant pairs <br>
to form 6 centers.  This didn&#x27;t seem work out for me either in terms <br>
of times or number of moves though I don&#x27;t have any specific notes <br>
on this to compare with the notes for the scheme outlined above.  <br>
You probably don&#x27;t want to waste time on this approach so I mention <br>
it more as a precaution than a suggestion (but who knows, maybe <br>
someone can get it to work?)<br>
<br>
<br>
Have fun on the 4x4x4.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
has somebody tried to compare the &quot;centers-edges-3x3x3&quot; approach to <br>
solve the 4x4x4 with the method described by Waterman?<br>
I mean:<br>
1) L-face except for one edge-pair<br>
2) R-corners at once (as for 3x3x3 corners-first method)<br>
3) R-edge-pairs + last L-edge-pair (few short sequences)<br>
4) DF and DB edge-pairs (few short sequences)<br>
5) UF and UB edge-pairs (special sequences)<br>
6) 5 remaining centers (easy 3-cycle and 2-swap sequences)<br>
<br>
The interesting thing is that you need not worry about parity so the <br>
times should be more consistent. Waterman averaged about 90 seconds <br>
using this technique in the time when he was averaging 18 sec. on <br>
3x3x3, so maybe it was even less later.<br>
Has somebody other info about this method and its progress?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I solve the centers very similar to how Rob does it.  First I find 
the opposite center pair that is in the best position to be solved 
quickly.  This is sort of like learning to solve the cross quickly, 
practice a lot (speed and for fewest moves) to find strategies you 
like and this will become automatic.  Then I place the two solved 
centers on U and D and I solve two adjacent centers.  The difference 
though is that I have spent a lot of time memorizing the color 
scheme of my cube, so I don&#x27;t have to take any time to think about 
how to place the centers.  This helps considerably to reduce 
recognition time.  After I get the second pair of centers, I solve 
the last pair of adjacent centers.  Again, having worked on 
memorizing the color scheme and knowing that the last two colors are 
in the same position as the previous two, just interchange the 
opposite colors in my head, then I know where the other centers have 
to go even before I&#x27;m finished with the 2nd pair of centers.  Also I 
recommend practicing all the cases that come up for the last two 
centers for fewest moves (no timer) and try to find the fastest way 
to do each case.  Once you don&#x27;t have to think about what to do for 
each case, and you already know where the colors go before you get 
to that step, then you can blaze through this last part.  The real 
secret for solving the centers quickly, I think, is to reduce 
recognition time.  I think working on this alone will bring you very 
fast center solving times.  I would definitely recommend thoroughly 
memorizing the color scheme of your cube (i.e. what colors are on L 
and R if color X is on U and color Y is on F).  This helps 
considerably for reducing your times.

My $0.02,
Chris

   Why not do the corners first? You could then using them as a guide

   It would have to be, wouldn&#x27;t it?

   Right, the order is important. I though that it could be graphed
and the different projections could be tested.

   OK. I meant disregarding the edges, for a corners-first approach.
Then: Using a computer program you could then look at how the edges
moved while solving the corners, looking for those small adjustments
that could be made during a corner solve which move the edges
appropriately.

   Separately you could take the edges-first approach. What&#x27;s the
fewest number of moves to solve an edge only cube disregarding effects
to the corners? (Like taking the stickers off all the corners.) 
What&#x27;s the fewest number of moves to solve the edges while not
disturbing the corners. (Now the computer can solve it blindfolded! :^)  )

The first one is number 451:

Interesting examples. In both cases, a smaller percentage than I
expected.

Thanks swedish,

   I appreciate the terms.

   Ok... then what ways can you look into such a set other than
graphing and doing it one by one, if you know what I mean.

   Could you, for example, define the highest prime you know  as &quot;nx&quot;
and arrive at (at least) a decent approximation of the union of sets
up to and including &quot;nx&quot; without having to drudge through it step by step?

    Why not add and subtract them in numerical order? That&#x27;s how they
fall naturally.

   As each additional prime occurs you take the measure of it and
compare it to the previous measurements, and make projections. Compare
the projections to the actual values (the next primes) and rank
projection schemes according to their success rates. 

   I relise that this is a lot of work, but that&#x27;s what computers were
invented for, wasn&#x27;t it?

Yes, but it&#x27;s not completely trivial:

What do you mean by &quot;projections could be tested&quot;? What are the

Yes, that could be done - it will give an upper bound, but maybe not 
the best one as it is a method of going to one subgroup fast and 
then solving in that subgroup (much like the 2-stage algorithm 
doesn&#x27;t always get an optimal solution).

That&#x27;s not actually true because for each fraction you&#x27;re actually 
including or excluding an infinite number of numbers.

<br>
&gt;From one post 4007<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; Right, the order is important. I though that it could be graphed<br>
&gt; and the different projections could be tested.<br>
<br>
&gt; What do you mean by &quot;projections could be tested&quot;? What are the<br>
projections and what would the test be?<br>
<br>
and from the next post 4008<br>
<br>
&gt; Why not add and subtract them in numerical order? That&#x27;s how<br>
they fall naturally.<br>
<br>
&gt; That&#x27;s not actually true because for each fraction you&#x27;re actually<br>
including or excluding an infinite number of numbers.<br>
<br>
So you make &quot;one&quot; the unit of infinity;<br>
you graph 1/2<br>
(you add 1/3 and you subtract 1/6)<br>
graph that as a point above 1/2<br>
(you add 1/5 - you subtract 1/10 and 1/15)<br>
graph that etc.<br>
<br>
   The graphed points end up defining a slope. <br>
   Each addition is a prime, the subtractions are a correction for<br>
doubling, so the point on the slope is marked after the corrections.<br>
<br>
   This won&#x27;t converge because it can&#x27;t.<br>
<br>
   There&#x27;s lots of information embedded there and multiple ways to<br>
project where the slope is going, for example, take a running average<br>
of the difference over two or more points, or three or more points, or<br>
more, and graphing them, etc. Several such averages just might<br>
converge. :) Do you see what I mean?<br>

You can&#x27;t really do that. There are strange properties of infinite 
sets - e.g. there are as many even numbers as whole numbers or as 
fractions. Thus you need to be able to define a particular notion of 
density (generally something like the limit of pi(x)/x as 
x->infinity is the sort of thing). For the primes this density 
becomes 0 in the limit (as it is approximately asymptotic to things 
like 1/(ln x)).

Why can&#x27;t it? I haven&#x27;t really given it any thought as to whether it 
can or not - clearly it isn&#x27;t absolutely convergent but you are 
saying that it can&#x27;t converge. If that&#x27;s true then it&#x27;s not really a 
good definition of density (which should be a value in [0,1]).

Surely if it couldn&#x27;t converge the slope couldn&#x27;t be going anywhere!
I assume you want to look at something like a Cesaro sum. I still 
can&#x27;t see why you can add all of your 1/2 and 1/3 before subtracting 
your 1/6.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the updates on Mefferts.

I&#x27;ve been getting a couple of friends hooked on the 4x4x4 and the 
5x5x5. They all want to buy these cubes now and so I suggested 
Mefferts (since that&#x27;s where I bought mine a year ago and it was all 
fine then). I&#x27;ll tell my friends to hold off for a while until this

but I might wait a while too.

Keep us posted! :)

Here it is - I already got a response!  This is from Uwe Meffert <br>
himself:<br>
<br>
&gt; ... the problem lays not with us but the new Visa Secure Gateway<br>
&gt; which to Asia has serious problems.  We can see that up to 80% of<br>
&gt; order payments are being declined but unfortunately it does not<br>
&gt; give details as to from whom or for what so we can not even contact<br>
&gt; them to suggesting to order by email with payment via PayPal to<br>
&gt; Jing Meffert e-mail mpg@... or Faxing me the details to<br>
&gt; (852) 2580-5525 or in two e-mails so that I can arranged to have<br>
&gt; the payment processed by Jetco in Hong Kong.<br>
<br>
So, if you haven&#x27;t ordered yet, and want to, I&#x27;d suggest going to <br>
their store, figuring out what you want, and then paying for it via <br>
paypal, being sure to indicate your order either in a comment with <br>
the payment, or in an additional e-mail to them.  If you already <br>
tried ordering, and aren&#x27;t sure if it worked completely, I&#x27;d <br>
recommend contacting them via e-mail... He replied to me from <br>
mefferts@..., so if you don&#x27;t get a response at the <br>
mpg@... address, try contacting him directly there, instead.<br>

   I know this is a common misunderstanding. All infinities are not
the same size. Those who claim they are have not thought it through.

   Yes, the density changes as the occurances of primes progresses.

   No, the density *never* reaches zero.

   Nothing to converge with, overall. You do want it to give you
something useful at particular points, but you have to go to the next
step an define those points.

   Overall it can&#x27;t be because of the open ended nature of it (the
infinit aspect) but in individual cases it can give a density for that
region of whole numbers.

   If overall the limit is zero, this line can head for the limit
infinitely and it will never arrive.

   Because the sieve will be the wrong size for a region of whole
numbers if you don&#x27;t state it correctly. There is no one density - you
need a means for plugging in specific primes to have a go at the next
prime. The region of the next prime will have a different density of
non-primes than any other prime.

No, you can&#x27;t.

Whilst not all infinities are the same size, all infinite subsets of 
the natural numbers are and they all have the same order type too 
(in the usual well-ordering). I have thought about infinities quite 
a lot actually. I did a Ph.D. in set theory.

No, the density is defined to be the limit, not a succession of 
values.

The density is defined to be the limit and this is 0.

Converge &quot;with&quot; rather than to? Am I to assume you are talking about 
converging with respect to some non-standard topology.

The infinity aspect is not a difficulty though, unless of course you 
are denying the possibility of inductive sets or some other axiom 
for infinite sets, in which case you can&#x27;t even have a set of primes 
anyway.

There are formal definitions of limit though.

I&#x27;d have to disagree in general. Certainly different (contiguous or 
otherwise) subsets will have different densities of primes, but 
that&#x27;s not really what the question at the heart of it is, which is 
to get approximations for pi(x) (or pi(x)/x) for large x.
For instance, since you seem to be going for a density at every 
step - what about {1,2,3,4,5}. You&#x27;d have 1/2+1/3-1/6+1/5 (and 
possibly -1/10-1/15+1/30) for the density of composites if I follow 
you because you have subtracted 1/6 before you added 1/5.

If you still disagree with me in terms of the infinite stuff, can 
you at least tell me from what level you are coming to it so that I 
know what level of formality you are using.

Just ran some stuff in Excel - it is always possible to orient the 
edges (without regard for what happens to their permutation or what 
happens to the corners) in 7 moves (half turn metric).
All but 13 orientations can be done in 6 moves or less. (The 13 are

Is it actually possible to 

a) change some of the middle stuff without the outer stuff (by which 
I mean for the mouse to go over a square say two rows and columns in 
you have to pass your mouse over an outer row or column first)?

b) change the same row/column twice in a row (as indicated) because 
it would seem that you need to be able to move out and in again to 
achieve this (and so get something else done in between).

One thing about puzzles like this is that the order in which you 
apply the moves doesn&#x27;t matter (so I assume you can get around a) 
and b) by doing the inner stuff and then cancelling out, if 
necessary, the outer stuff later on).

As far as I am aware there is no result on the diameter in QTM 
except that it is less than 42 and at least (either) 24 or 26.

You can get a metric where evey position can be solved in 1 if you 
use enough generators. : )

Sorry, I lied.  Actually there are positions that take 10.

The prior number was from a run that didn&#x27;t finish; I thought it had
finished.

My most humble apologies for spreading bad information.

The link (which is not fully underlined on my browser) takes you to 
a &quot;Rubik&#x27;s&quot; page which has a notice on it saying that it has no 
information!  There is a search box there however and if you 
type &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; into the search box it takes you to the relevant 
page.  I am sure that if you entered the whole link it would do the 
same.

Do follow Jaap&#x27;s advice to click the &quot;Optimal Solution&quot; link - a 
learned and interesting article with many references.

I like the bit where it says he hasn&#x27;t been able to learn to solve 
the cube from watching the robot; since it appears to use something 
like Kociemba&#x27;s algorithm, it&#x27;s not a big surprise!

I suppose they would depending on the type of puzzles they have.  I 
think that even with out Rubik to invent it, it would have been 
invented becuase puzzles of this sort all work up to the 3x3 cube 
(basically).  If ETs were to have a sliding type puzzle, that was a 
sqaure, then they&#x27;d prabably move up to a more difficult 3-D version 
of the same puzzle.  Then eventually evolving towards the cube. 

Of course, extraterrestrial intelligent beings may not even be 
composed of cells, or have a brain capable of seeing in 3-D.  They 
could be part of the 7th demension, and not even bother with 3-D 
puzzles.  Although, I have no knowledge to back up my useless 
prognostications about how aliens are.

On a side note, I hope that Aliens invent a 12 color megaminx in 
which they can sell to me, because it seems no one has one here on 
earth anymore...

          <div class="email-content">Hi all, not only for Sunday contest enthusiasts, <br>
<br>
Let me introduce Japanese Sunday Contest. <br>
When Jess started 1st Sunday contest ever, we, Japanese cubists, <br>
started the similar contest organized by Mr. Suehiro Kondo<br>
 who is the pioneer of Japanese speedcubists community. <br>
Since Nov 2001, we have had 99 times of contests. <br>
Here you can see the history of the contests. <br>
(Sorry Japanese only, but you may see the times and numebers at <br>
least.)<br>
http://ksuehiro.hp.infoseek.co.jp/ranking0.htm<br>
<br>
Next week, we will have the 100th contest. <br>
The first contest we had 6 contestants and I won with 24.5 sec in <br>
average. Everybody has practiced a lot and got faster. <br>
Recent competions of Macky and Katsu look like world championship<br>
(you may already know at Frank&#x27;s contest)<br>
 but the level of contestants vary from sub18 to 1 min. <br>
We normally have one regular contest a week<br>
 but this time we are going to have several categories<br>
 like big cubes, average of 100?, blidfold, etc. <br>
To celebrate the 100th, we wish we could have more than 100 <br>
contestants to join <br>
Feel free to join the contest. <br>
We are very happy if you could join. <br>
Please help us and have fun for winter holidays! <br>
I will post the details of the contest in the next week again. <br>
Thanks. <br>
<br>

P.S. Hi Chris and David, Congratulations on your new records<br>
 on big cubes. I will try to catch up with you guys in this winter <br>
holidays again! <br>

Maybe they have a tesseract (4D cube) or something else. Do you 
recall showing me the bottle puzzle in April? Perhaps they have 
something similar but with a Klein bottle. That would be more of a 
hoax puzzle though since you can&#x27;t put things inside of or take 
things out of such a bottle (with it not having an inside or out). 
Also, if they are in 4D (and I&#x27;m not talking about time as a &quot;fourth 
dimension&quot; but a fourth spatial dimension - from the vector space 
point of view, time can&#x27;t be a dimension anyway, unless there is 
negative time) certain puzzles would be perhaps easier. All knots 
are equivalent to the unknot in 4D so puzzles like the Tangle might 
be trivial. (I&#x27;m making a very uninformed statement here as I don&#x27;t 
really know anything about this puzzle and am just inferring from 
it&#x27;s name.)

On a sort of related note:
Did you know (as I found out from a friend who has studied such 
matters) that the shape of the universe can affect the limits of our 
computational ability? Actually, if you saw Horizon last night there 
was something similar to this. As I recall if the universe had some 
shape like a torus or maybe a 2-torus (maybe more generally anything 
with negative genus, but that&#x27;s more of a wild conjecture) then it 
would be possible to do supertasks and do an infinite amount of 
calculation in a finite time (because of differences in time at 
different places). The unfortunate thing is that getting the 
information back from the experiment (e.g. a verification that 
Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture (every even number greater than 2 is a sum of 
two primes) was true (if it is) by testing all the possible sums of 
2 primes) would impart sufficient energy to kill the recipient.
As I recall, the master would send out the slave who would be able 
to perform all these calculations in a finite amount of time and 
then send the information back. Then the master would die instantly, 
but he&#x27;d know (whether GC is true).

In particular, a similar experiment could obtain the diameters of 
all the various cube puzzles.

It&#x27;s Rockman 2 (Megaman) game.
Game is played with an emulator, I find it amazing.
(Video size is 45mb, and 28min55 long)
Player control accuracy is unbelievable, especially on Airman level 
(maybe he use the emulator to slow-down the game ?). He nearly 
doesn&#x27;t get hit, only destroy few ennemy robots and destroy boss in 
no time. My favorite moment is when he has to destroy again the 8

If you find Super Mario video amazing then this video is far more 
amazing :)

(Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve never done a course in knot theory, although I had 
to TA for one as a graduate student.)
A knot is just a continuous function f:[0,1]->R^n for some n 
(usually n=3), such that f[0]=f[1] and the restriction of f to [0,1) 
is injective. (i.e. the image of f is a simple closed curve in R^n.
I suppose then that if one were to look at knots in 2D then because 
of the Jordan curve theorem every knot would be homotopic to a 
circle, i.e. to the unknot. So the only real knot theory in 2D would 
be the Jordan curve theorem (if that even would fall under the 
heading of knot theory).
To answer the first question, I&#x27;m fairly sure that knot theory is 
only non-trivial if n=3. (i.e. every knot is equivalent in R^n if 
n>3.) Therefore, you could just insist on n=3 in the definition, 
because outside of this the theory is uninteresting (modulo the 
result that it is uninteresting!).

Individually, but I was meaning nxnxn for each n, which is infinite.

   I&#x27;d would say that it is possible that the cube would be invented
again, considering that both Erno Rubik and Terutoshi Ishige both
invented the cube at about the same time.

   Like the man who showed up in the patent office with a working
telephone 4 hours after Alexander Graham Bell, at certain points in
history there occurs &quot;an idea whose time has come.&quot;

Congratulations once again to Mirek for winning the 12/12/03 FMC. <br>
See his winning solution, and all the other great solutions on my <br>
FMC page, located at www.cubestation.co.uk<br>
<br>
The 19/12/03 FMC has been launched, and will run for a fortnight. <br>
The results will be posted after the Christmas break, on Friday 2nd <br>
January.<br>
<br>
Lets hope for lots of competitors, and make it your New Years <br>
Resolution to take part in the Fewest Moves Challenge! <br>
<br>
I would like to say thank you to everyone who has taken part this <br>
year, and I hope I can count on your support next year too. It&#x27;s <br>
been great fun running the competition, I hope you&#x27;ve had a good <br>
time taking part too!<br>

usually go for considerably more than a new meffert&#x27;s 6 color,

technology so advanced compared to our own, that it would be almost 
like magic. If you judge by the age of the universe, then the age of 
the Earth, then how long ago we started getting technology (probably 
when we started making civilizations is a good starting point).

Once we suppose they are that intelligent they have to be able to 
manipulate objects (otherwise they would not have a reason to be so 
intelligent). If they can manipulate objects they find a way to 
manipulate things like Rubik&#x27;s cube. Though the cube may differ a lot 
in size from our, it may have its surface or shape adjusted for their 
better grip and most importantly the stickers would not peel off (!) 
like of the cubes we are used to. 
Thus, it doesn&#x27;t matter if they are jelly fish looking or a highly 
organized plasma made of.

This site claims a patent, but I mailed them 5 months ago for the 
number, It is very unlikely that they have a patent, especially for 
the 2x2x2,3x3x3,4x4x4,5x5x5. 

It is also unlikey that they have a working prototype else I would 
expect to see pictures on this site.

However the idea of the pillow shape is possible to make big &quot;cubes&quot;, 
but cubes bigger as 6x6x6 are very hard to make because there are so 
many pieces. Production cost will be very high. So if they want to 
convince me show me a picture of a working 7x7x7

I have always thought that the diametrical point must be symmetric in relation to the opposite point. It seems (to me) very hard to believe that you from a non-symmetric point can do any quarter turn (of twelve), and in all cases come a step closer to the opposite point.

This is an interesting comment---but how symmetric must it be?  The<br>

out of the 48 standard symmetries it is 16-way symmetric, and it is<br>
its own inverse.<br>
<br>
Of course you say &quot;the diametrical point&quot;; why must there be only one?<br>
<br>
In any case, since the number of &quot;highly symmetric&quot; positions is much<br>
much less than the number of positions, it would be interesting to<br>
&quot;solve&quot; all of the positions of highest symmetry just to see what they<br>

Randelshofer pretty pattern collection includes probably most highly<br>

An antipode need not be symmetric, though as you point out, in a way <br>
symmetric positions are more likely to be antipodes than non-<br>
symmetric ones.<br>
<br>
&gt; Of course you say &quot;the diametrical point&quot;; why must there be only<br>
&gt; one?<br>
<br>
Indeed. Most puzzles have several antipodes. Many of the pages on my <br>
site list the number of positions at each distance, and only very <br>
rarely is there a single position at the furtherst distance from <br>
start. However, if there is only one, then it must be symmetric: Any <br>
reflection/rotation of an antipode is also an antipode, so if there <br>
is only one antipode then its reflections/rotations are the same.<br>
<br>
&gt; In any case, since the number of &quot;highly symmetric&quot; positions is<br>
&gt; much much less than the number of positions, it would be<br>
&gt; interesting to &quot;solve&quot; all of the positions of highest symmetry<br>

For me - and quite intutively - the superflip represents the highest symmetri in relation to the null point. If that is true (that it does have the highest symmetri), a bold hypothesis would be that this flip represents the (only) diameter of the cube. Other points of &quot;less symmetri&quot; may very well be local maxima in the system.
(I know, it´s not quite sympathetic to - like Goldbach - make more or less vague conjectures, but after all, they are there for  being proved (or refuted)).

Why is this so hard to believe? Also, in the case of quarter turns 
superflip takes 24 which is less than the move that needed 26 
mentioned earlier in the thread and that position is clearly less 
symmetric than the superflip.
(In terms of the half-turn metric, of course it is conceivable that 
there may be 2 positions A, B that are 1 move away from each other 
and are also both the maximum distance from the solved position. 
Whilst this is not true in the case of quarter turns, the most 
symmetric position isn&#x27;t the most distant in that metric.)

          <div class="email-content">Some of the smaller subgroups have a single antipode:

&lt;T2, D2, F2>  
&lt;T2, D2, F2, B2>

Slice group has 69 antipodes with &quot;q slice turns&quot; so
it might have something in the way of unsymmetric
antipodes. 

But then I&#x27;m not sure how unsymmetric a slice position
can be. It shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to hack something up
to list the number of positions by symmetry level. 

My guess is that it&#x27;s M-level 12 at most (in the slice group).
Might be an idea to define &quot;unsymmetric&quot; as the most 
unsymmetric pattern in a given group.

I&#x27;d like to see an example of a local maxima in the 
full cube group of M-level 48. To the best of my knowledge
there are no known examples.

Howdy!  Help me understand this; is superflip M-level 48, or M-level
1?  If it&#x27;s M-level 48, isn&#x27;t superflip a local maxima in the QTM?

means that that position can be converted into 48 different

So yes, in my notation the superflip is M-level 1. 
The notation is somewhat radical in the sense that a lesser 
number presents greater symmetry.

Here are two examples I just found:

   U+U+F+L+L+F+D-L-D+B-U-L-D-R+D+U+U+R-U-L+D+B+B+

and its inverse.

In QTM, this is of distance 23; all of its 12 neighbors are of
distance 22.  It has no symmetries in M.  Its order is 24.

Here are the shortest inverses of the above sequence followed by U+,
U-, F+, F-, R+, R-, D+, D-, B+, B-, L+, and L-, respectively, so
others don&#x27;t have to verify the 23 distances:

U+F-U+F-D+F-L+L+B+R+B+R-D+R+F+B+L-U+L-B+D-B-

U-F-U+F-D+F-L+L+B+R+B+R-D+R+F+B+L-U+L-B+D-B-

U+R+R+D-R+R+B+D+F+F+D+L-U-B-R+R+F-U+B+R-U+B+

U+R+D+F-R+B+L-F-D-F-B-U+B+R+L+U+R-U-R+F+D+F-

U+U+B-U-R+F+R-F+R-L+D-B+D+R+L+L+D+B+U-D-B-L+

U+F+U+F+R-L-B+B+L-U-L+D-F+L+D-B+D-R+U+R-L-D+

U+F+U-B-U-D+L-D+F-L+L+U+L-F+U+D+R-L+B-D-R+F+

U+F+L+B+U+D-B-U+L-U-R-L+B+R-U+L+F+B-D+L+L+F-

U+U+D-L-U+L+U-F+B-R+L+F+R-B-U-D+B+L-F-B-U+F+

U+U+L+D-R-L-D+L+F+F+B+L-D+F-L+D+F-B+L-D-F-R+

U+F+B-R+L+F-D-R-F-D-R+L+D-B+L+L+D-R+U+F+D-R+

U+U+D-R+B-U+B-R-L-F+U-F+L+F-L+F-U-D+L-B-U-R-

I&#x27;m sure I can find many more in QTM quite easily.

          <div class="email-content">Indeed, and a quick review of some God&#x27;s Algorithm notes
for 3x3x3 corners only shows that at one q turn closer to
start almost all positions are local maxima: 

 2,127,264 positions at 13 q turns.

Distance 23 seems a bountiful place to start. _If_ distance
26 is the farthest away then it seems reasonable that 
there&#x27;s a ton of local maxima at 23, most of that is going 
to be very unsymmetric. 

Cube-lovers might even have an earlier reference, but 
I didn&#x27;t recall any discussions about it. The various God&#x27;s
Algorithm calculations didn&#x27;t include a list of M-symmetry
levels but maybe Jaap or Claude Crepeau knows?

No reason why we can&#x27;t do that for some subgroups.

Your position doesn&#x27;t look very random... is it a 
composite of some sort?

A company called 1&amp;1 Internet Inc. is giving away 3 years of free <br>

that comes with 500MB of space, 6GB/mo. of data transfer (which <br>
stands for lots of viewing of your cube videos :-), and there&#x27;s no <br>

kinda expensive ($29/mo.), but who cares for the next three years, <br>
right?<br>
<br>
You don&#x27;t have to register a domain (you&#x27;ll get something like mine <br>
for free - http://s92306692.onlinehome.us which is currently not <br>
updated at all), but if you want to, that&#x27;s just $6/yr with them.  <br>
&gt;From what I&#x27;ve seen so far, it looks like an excellent deal, and it&#x27;s <br>
just their way of bringing in new business...  If you&#x27;re under 18, <br>
you will need parental permission (see their terms &amp; conditions), but <br>
aside from that you just need a valid e-mail address, phone number, <br>

pages, and I&#x27;ve seen that some big cubes (bigger as 3x3x3) had this 
kind of scheme. Does anybody know of any good reason for that? Just 
wondering...
> F.

All Eastheen cubes have pink instead of orange. I gues this is done 
to prevent trademark violations.

There is only one officical Rubik&#x27;s cube with pink!

As I mentioned previously, I just uploaded algorithms for the 100th <br>
Japanese Speedcubing Sundy Contest.<br>
You can find excel file at file section of this group. <br>
<br>
I also created tables at database section. <br>
You can submit your times there. <br>
That means immediately after you submitted your time, everyone can <br>
see your results. <br>
For the organizer&#x27;s convenience, we use this database. <br>
<br>
Please feel free to join the contests. <br>
There are many categories but may not sufficient for everybody. <br>
Sorry for those who can&#x27;t find the interesting categories. <br>
<br>
Categories: <br>
2x2, 3x3 average of 10 out of 12<br>
4x4 average of 3 out of 5<br>
5x5 middle of 3<br>
3x3 fastest with practices<br>
pyraminx<br>
blind fold for 2x2 and 3x3<br>
Forced cross color average of 5 out of 7<br>
<br>
Deadline is around January 7th, 2004. <br>
<br>
We wish we could see 100s of participants to join. <br>
<br>
Happy cubing, happy holidays, and happy new year. <br>

No cubes here, but I do have a 5x5x5 coming from Meffert&#x27;s in the mail,<br>
along with a Skewb keychain =)  I did, however, get a 64 mb USB pen<br>
drive and the special edition The Two Towers DVD&#x27;s.<br>

I&#x27;m working on a solution page, but it&#x27;s still very much in 
development:

http://lars.studentenweb.org/square1/

I hope to have this page completely finished in a couple of months, 
right now I&#x27;m too busy with my exams. This is the method I used to win 
the world title in August and I now still use it to average 30 
seconds. Jaap&#x27;s puzzle page is also a very good resource for solutions 
methods:

I&#x27;ve had this happen sometimes. Usually I carefully force it, so <br>
that the twists pass through the hinge on to the other side tiles. <br>
After that it is usually fine. It often takes quite a lot of force, <br>
so use a finger between the strings to push it towards the hinge.<br>

Dear Louie,

Grant Tregay posted some excellent tips for uniting the last four 
edge triplets.  Check out post #6266 from Aug 28th.  Good luck 
Louie.  Thanks for sharing the tips Grant I have found them to be 
very useful.

Hi Pete

Good question, since I am a collector I have many sources for 
collectibles that I do not share. I do share sources for new puzzle, 
like Cube21 or any puzzle that can you can buy online. It takes a 
while to get some sources for collectibles, but the Arxon cubes did 
came from 3 sources all from Germany. As for any collectible you can 
get them for a good price if you can wait long enough! 

Hopes this helps a bit
Ton

ï¿½<br>
ï¿½DO YOU WISH THAT WE SHOW UP ?ï¿½<br>
(short version)<br>
Consider this message as a worldwide referendum! And<br>
your answer as a ballot!<br>
<br>
Who are we ?<br>
What in your history seemed ridiculous or improbable<br>
has often become possible, then realised, in<br>
particular in the last fifty years. We are conscious<br>
creatures that some name ï¿½extra-terrestrialsï¿½, even<br>
though reality is subtler.<br>
<br>
There is no fundamental difference between you and us,<br>
save for the experience of certain stages of<br>
evolution. Like most of you, we are in the quest of<br>
the Supreme Being. We have no human representative on<br>
Earth who could guide your decision.<br>
<br>
Why arenï¿½t we visible ?<br>
Structured DEMATERIALISATION and materialisation are<br>
part of new forms of science beyond the apparent<br>
control of matter. That you call ï¿½UFOs, there are<br>
essentially multidimensional manufactured spaceships<br>
that apply these capacities.<br>
ï¿½<br>
For negative multidimensional beings that play a part<br>
in the exercise of power in the shadow of human<br>
oligarchy, discretion is motivated by their will to<br>
keep their existence and seizure unknown.<br>
<br>
For us, discretion is motivated by the respect of the<br>
human free will that people can exercise to manage<br>
their own affairs so that they can reach technical and<br>
spiritual maturity on their own. Humankindï¿½s entrance<br>
into the family of galactic civilisations is greatly<br>
expected.<br>
<br>
We can appear in broad daylight and help you attain<br>
this union. We havenï¿½t done it so far, as too few of<br>
you have genuinely desired it, because of ignorance,<br>
indifference or fear, and because the emergency of the<br>
situation did not justify it. <br>
<br>
Who are you ?<br>
You are the offspring of many traditions that<br>
throughout time have been mutually enriched by each<br>
othersï¿½ contributions. The appearance of your cultures<br>
seems to keep you separated because you substitute it<br>
to your deeper being. Shape is now more important than<br>
the essence of your subtle nature. For the powers in<br>
place, this prevalence of the shape constitutes the<br>
ramparts against any form of jeopardy. <br>
<br>
You are being called on to overcome shape while still<br>
respecting it for its richness and beauty. Peace does<br>
not mean not making war, it consists in becoming what<br>
you are in reality: a same Fraternity.<br>
<br>
What is your situation ?<br>
Your history has never ceased to be marked by<br>
encounters between peoples who had to discover one<br>
another in conditions that were often conflictual.<br>
Earth has now become a village where everyone knows<br>
everyone else but still conflicts persist and threats<br>
of all kinds get worse in duration and intensity. <br>
<br>
Your thoughts and beliefs are modelled after partisan<br>
interests to turn you into slaves while at the same<br>
time giving you the feeling that you are in total<br>
control of your destiny, which in essence is the<br>
reality.<br>
<br>
Ecosystem exhaustion mechanisms have exceeded<br>
irreversible limits. The scarcity of resources and<br>
their unfair distribution - resources which entry<br>
price will rise day after day - will bring about<br>
fratricide fights at a large scale, but also at the<br>
very heart of your cities and countrysides.<br>
<br>
Hatred grows bigger but so does love. That is what<br>
keeps you confident in your ability to find solutions.<br>
But the critical mass is insufficient and a sabotage<br>
work is cleverly being carried out.<br>
<br>
ï¿½Tribes, populations and human nations have always<br>
encountered and interacted with one another. Faced<br>
with the threats weighing upon the human family, it is<br>
perhaps time that a greater interaction occurred. <br>
ï¿½<br>
Who are the ï¿½third partyï¿½ ?<br>
There are two ways to establish a cosmic contact with<br>
another civilisation: via its standing representatives<br>
or directly with individuals without distinction. The<br>
first way entails fights of interests, the second way<br>
brings awareness.<br>
<br>
The first way was chosen by a group of races motivated<br>
by keeping mankind in slavery, thereby controlling<br>
Earth resources, the gene pool and human emotional<br>
energy.<br>
<br>
The second way was chosen by a group of races allied<br>
with the cause of the Spirit of service. <br>
<br>
That is why today individuals are to make this choice<br>
by themselves without any representative interfering.<br>
Peace and reunification of your peoples would be a<br>
first step toward the harmony with civilisations other<br>
than yours.<br>
<br>
That is precisely what those who manipulate you behind<br>
the scenes want to avoid at all cost because, by<br>
dividing, they reign! They also reign over those who<br>
govern you. Their strength comes from their capacity<br>
to distillate mistrust and fear into you. This<br>
considerably harms your very cosmic nature.<br>
Being aware of the priceless value of free will, we<br>
are inviting you to an alternative.<br>
<br>
What can we offer ?<br>
WE CAN offer you a more holistic vision of the<br>
universe and of life, constructive interactions, the<br>
experience of fair and fraternal relationships,<br>
liberating technical knowledge, eradiction of<br>
suffering, controlled exercise of individual powers,<br>
the access to new forms of energy and, finally, a<br>
better comprehension of CONSCIOUSNESS. <br>
<br>
WE CANNOT help you overcome your individual and<br>
collective fears, or bring you laws that you would not<br>
have chosen, work on your own selves, individual and<br>
collective effort to build the world you desire, the<br>
spirit of quest to new skies.<br>
<br>
What would we receive ?<br>
Should you decide that such a contact takes place, we<br>
would rejoice over the safeguarding of fraternal<br>
equilibrium in this region of the universe, fruitful<br>
diplomatic exchanges, and the intense Joy of knowing<br>
that you are united to accomplish what you are capable<br>
of. The feeling of JOY is strongly sought in the<br>
universe for its energy is divine.<br>
<br>
What is the question we ask you ?<br>
ï¿½DO YOU WISH THAT WE SHOW UP ?ï¿½<br>
<br>
How to can you answer this question ?<br>
The truth of soul can be read by telepathy. This is<br>
why you should calmly think about it, in all<br>
conscience. Do not rush to answer. Breathe and let all<br>
the power of your own free will penetrate you. You<br>
only need to give your answer, YES or NO, IMMEDIATELY<br>
AFTER ASKING THE QUESTION ! <br>
<br>
In your own private polling booth of your secret will,<br>
you will determine the future.<br>
<br>
What is the lever effect ?<br>
This decision should be made by the greatest number<br>
among you, even though it might seem like a minority.<br>
This request is one of the most intimate that can be<br>
asked to you.<br>
<br>
If you really want to cling to your beliefs, which is<br>
something that we understand, then say NO. If you do<br>
not know what to choose, do not say YES because of<br>
mere curiosity. <br>
<br>
Your history has plenty of episodes when determined<br>
men and women were able to influence the thread of<br>
events in spite of their small number.<br>
<br>
Just like a small number is enough to take temporal<br>
power on Earth and influence the future of the<br>
majority, a small number of you can radically change<br>
your fate as an answer to the impotence in face of so<br>
much inertia and hurdles ! You can ease the mankindï¿½s<br>
birth to Brotherhood. <br>
<br>
What would be the consequences of a positive decision<br>
?<br>
For us, the immediate consequence of a collective<br>
favourable decision would be the materialisation of<br>
many ships, in your sky and on Earth.<br>
<br>
For you, the direct effect would be the rapid<br>
abandoning of many certitudes and beliefs.<br>
Concretely, you would change the scale of your values<br>
! <br>
<br>
Later on, peaceful and respectful exchanges would be<br>
thus possible if such is your wish. For now, he who is<br>
hungry cannot smile, he who is fearful cannot welcome<br>
us. We are sad to see men, women and children<br>
suffering to such a degree in their flesh and in their<br>
hearts when they bear such an inner light.<br>
<br>
The main difference between your daily prayers to<br>
entities of a strictly spiritual nature and your<br>
current decision is extremely simple :<br>
<br>
we are technically equipped to materialise!<br>
<br>
Why such a historical dilemma ?<br>
We know that ï¿½foreignersï¿½ are considered as enemies as<br>
long as they embody the ï¿½unknownï¿½. In a first stage,<br>
the emotion that our appearance will generate will<br>
strengthen your relationships on a worldwide scale.<br>
<br>
How could you know whether our arrival is the<br>
consequence of your collective choice ? For the simple<br>
reason that we would have otherwise been already there<br>
for a long time at your level of existence ! If we are<br>
not there yet, it is because you have not made such a<br>
decision explicitely.<br>
<br>
How could you be certain that this is not yet another<br>
subtle manoeuvre of the ï¿½third partyï¿½ to better<br>
enslave you ? Because one always more efficiently<br>
fights something that is identified than the contrary.<br>
Whatever, you are the sole judge in your own heart and<br>
soul ! Do you want to see us with your own eyes, or<br>
simply believe what your thinkers say ? That is the<br>
real question!<br>
<br>
ï¿½You are still the architects of your own fate...<br>
<br>
ï¿½DO YOU WISH THAT WE SHOW UP ?ï¿½<br>

familiare because I am jewish, but for Hanuka, the jewish holiday

Maybe because It&#x27;s hard to find a good cube in Israel.
It&#x27;s not so bad, I have a few myself :)

I could be wrong, but I think it has to do with rotating the cube.  I<br>
believe x is rotation with respect to the R face, y is rotation with<br>
respect to the U face, and z is rotation with respect to the F face. For<br>
y&#x27; you would look at the top face and rotate the entire cube<br>
counter-clockwise.<br>

This depends what type of 2x2x2 you have, but for lubrication you can <br>
just spray in the center. But the best result you will get to spray <br>
every piece<br>
<br>
To disassemble a Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 Oddzon type see <br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/2x2x2_dis.JPG<br>
<br>
To disassemble a Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 Ideal 1980 big pocket version<br>
Unscrew three screws in the center and you can remove one corner<br>
see<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/images/Rubik&#x27;s%202x2x2%20balltype%<br>

<br>
The Eastheen is a bit tricky but you must push to teh outside with a <br>
screw driver a little platic clip inside the corne  and the corner <br>
can slide of<br>

          <div class="email-content">I managed to solve those last 2 triplets once, and I think it was <br>
just luck that all 3 ended up in the same triplet then I just <br>
flipped the middle pieces in the triplets.<br>
<br>
Can someone just give me some algorithms that work for the last two? <br>
If you can solve it using the 3x3x3 method you should just know them <br>
off of the top of your head.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
Since Meffert&#x27;s Puzzles and Games seems to have intermittent problems <br>
with their online store (I had some problems a couple years back, as <br>
well as the recent issues), I&#x27;d suggest always using Paypal as <br>
outlined recently in this group.  Since that&#x27;s just paypal + e-mail, <br>
you don&#x27;t have to worry about a messed up payment gateway getting in <br>
the way, like it does on their website.<br>

Seeing as they don&#x27;t charge for shipping (last I knew), it&#x27;s not <br>
surprising that they ship using cheap means (which also means slow).  <br>
I needed something quickly before the WC in August, so I payed for <br>
the expensive shipping, and got it in just a couple of days.  If you <br>
go with the free shipping option, I would expect it to take at least <br>
2-4 weeks, if not as much as 6.. unfortunately :-(<br>

I&#x27;ve gotten to the point of ALMOST being able to solve it every time. <br>
I&#x27;ve slved it about five or six times on my own. I&#x27;ve mostly been <br>
using the technique available at http://lar5.com/cube/index.html It <br>
has worked for me. I thought it would be a good idea to compile a <br>
list of cubing techniques (mostly speed cubing, because of the nature <br>
of the group). This would not only be usful to newies in finding (a) <br>
techniqure(s) that they are comfortable with, but it would be usful <br>
to more advanced users becuase they could find more techniques, tips, <br>
and other people that might be able to help them. If you just post <br>

move the middle layer rather than the top and bottom layers..or the 
left and right sides.

LRU2L&#x27;R&#x27;-B&#x27;F&#x27;U2BF
For the first part, keep the Left layer in the same place (so the U2

moves with your right hand. (&lt;-that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re right-handed...)

          <div class="email-content">Basically. The technique gets me to the 2x2x3, and I can get everything but the edges how I want them when I want them. so to move the edges, I have to move a layer that is part of the 2x2x2 or the 2x2x3. i do what i think i have to do to put it back, but i get confused and ruin it, but don&#x27;t realize it till after a couple moves, and I can&#x27;t can&#x27;t remember what i did, to work backwards to fix it. so i have to start over.<br>

Hallo Mr. Reed,

Thanks for your Email.  

I checked our posting record that we did send your puzzle
order by air on 20th December, 2003 from our Hong kong
office.  Sorry for a few days delay due to the puzzle -Mini
Professor cube was out of stock for a few days.

Normally it needs to take approx. 1-2 weeks from H.K. to
U.S.A.  It may a few days delay during the posting peak
season (for Christmas and New Year holidays).  Hopefully
you are able to receive it shortly.

Wish you have a wonderful, fruitful and joy New Year!
Sincerely
Jing Meffert
I should be getting it any time now =) I can&#x27;t wait.

Doug

Did you see the information I posted recently about 1&amp;1 hosting?  <br>
I&#x27;ve uploaded a bit there (though it&#x27;s not linked to from the main <br>
page, since it&#x27;s just there for test purposes at this point), and <br>
nothing&#x27;s disappeared yet. It&#x27;s free for the next 3 years, and gives <br>
plenty of bandwidth (5-6GB) and space (500MB).  Just go to <br>
http://order.1and1.com .  It&#x27;s a limited time offer (though I noticed <br>
that the deadline has changed from 1/14/04 to 1/21/04 recently), but <br>
I hope this helps.<br>

problems with their online store (I had some problems a couple years 
back, as well as the recent issues), I&#x27;d suggest always using Paypal 
as outlined recently in this group.  Since that&#x27;s just paypal + e-
mail, you don&#x27;t have to worry about a messed up payment gateway 
getting in the way, like it does on their website.
 
Just my $.02

I see you&#x27;re in Houston as well, so 2 weeks should be accurate =)  I&#x27;m<br>
not worried about it any more, but with the problems I&#x27;ve been hearing<br>
about with their online store, I was just kind of worried (even though I<br>
payed with PayPal).  Thanks.<br>

About three months ago I got some puzzles five days after ordering 
them, including a weekend :-) Maybe it&#x27;s easier to ship to Germany? 
I just ordered a couple more puzzles, will let you know what 
happens...

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">I guess that means layer by layer method. Well, if you want to get 
faster, you should probably switch methods. The layer by layer can 
get down under one minute, but not much faster than about 50 seconds.

          <div class="email-content">There is no &#x27;fastest method,&#x27; really. Though I personally think that 
you can get the fastest with the Corners First method. But I also 
think it takes a lot of work to get that fast.

&gt; <br>

Masayuki,<br>
<br>
Thanks for putting this together and including this group, though it <br>
looks like not very many people have participated yet (from this <br>
group).  I did the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 averages, but I&#x27;m confused on the <br>
instructions for the 4x4x4 scramble... <br>
It says &quot;Randomize 4x4 sigle slice movements (B) followed by double <br>
slice movements (C)&quot; - does this mean that I apply the sequence in <br>
column B to just the faces, and then the sequence in column C to the <br>
face and the inner slice?  Or, does it mean to apply the sequence in <br>
B to just the inner slice and then column C to the face and the inner <br>
slice?  Or, does it mean something else?<br>
<br>
Thanks ahead of time for your clarification!<br>

          <div class="email-content">A popular method among many top speedcubers is the Fridrich method 
(or some variation of this). In a nutshell, this method consists of 
the following steps: cross + rest of the F2L + 2 look LL. I don&#x27;t 
know if this method is *the* fastest, but it&#x27;s certainly one of the 
fastest.

The current world champ, Dan Knights, uses this method. So does the 
runner-up world champ, Jessica Fridrich (who devised the method back 
in the 1980s).

Jasmine.

          <div class="email-content">You only need to know the folowing algorithm for this case, it has 
got to be the simplest PLL alg in existence :)

M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2

It is very fast to execute as :

(r2 R2&#x27;) U (r2 R2&#x27;) U2 (r2 R2&#x27;) U (r2 R2&#x27;)

Execute this a few times very slowly to get the idea, your hand never 
needs to relinquish grip of the cube either.

Hope it helps

          <div class="email-content">Yep, this is definitely an excellent PLL alg. Dan showed me this alg
in Toronto and it was very enlightening. :) I had been using a much
more complicated way of solving this case.

Hi Lloyd,

   The method I use is my own. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the &quot;fastest.&quot; 

   First two levels:
   Choose what will be your first level, middle level and last level.
   Place two middle level edges on any one side.
   Place the 4 corners of the first level.
   Place the other two middle level edge pieces.
   Place the 4 first level edge pieces (most often on the bottom.

    There are many options for solving the Last level it shouldn&#x27;t be
too hard to find one of your choosing, or to make one up of your own.

   This takes between 36 and 54 moves on average.

   On occasion I do corners first and that&#x27;s almost as fast time-wise,
which recommends it because I really don&#x27;t practice that method.

   The fastest would be doing all the corners and all the edges at the
same time, but memorizing several quintillion algs is out of the
question! :)

Regards,

David J

Yeah - do something like this...

&lt;HEAD>
   &lt;TITLE>Redirection to my new page&lt;/TITLE>
   &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;REFRESH&quot; CONTENT=&quot;0; URL=domain.com/file.html&quot;>
&lt;/HEAD>

However, it&#x27;s usually a good idea to have a body that says something 
like &quot;if you don&#x27;t get forwarded automatically, click here&quot;, in case 
it doesn&#x27;t work...  Btw, in the &#x27;CONTENT=&quot;0; ...&#x27; stuff, 0 is the 
amount of time, I believe in seconds, before auto redirection.

I understood it to be the first one, so scramble with single outer 
layer turns first, and then double layer turns.

I will post your question on JSCC forum for clarification, and get 
back to you ASAP.
