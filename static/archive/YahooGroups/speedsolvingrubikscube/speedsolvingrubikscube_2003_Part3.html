        In the run up to the World Championships, I had my first ever Luckiest
        Last Layer, that is to say after placing the 4th F2L pair, the entire LL
        was solved, hence so was the cube (give or take a U turn) Then this
        morning, I have had the next shortest LL case, not once, but twice! That
        is the T orientation (F R U R' U' F') and then no Permutation. Is this a
        lot more likely to occur than a Luckiest Last Layer? For instance, I
        know that the chance of the LLL is something resembling 1/(216*72)
        (please correct me if this is wrong), and I also know the probability of
        the T-orientation is 1/54. Performing the T-orientation also executes
        the "Arrow" Permutation (Case 15 on my site) which has a probability of
        1/18, so presumably for the 6 move LL to occur this has to be at the
        correct angle when executing the Orientation, which makes the
        probability 1/(18*4) = 1/72 So does this make the probability of this
        particular 6 move LL 1/(54*72) ? Or am I completely wrong (Most likely,
        I'm no good at probability theory! Is there some conditional probability
        stuff going on here?) Food for thought! DanH :) Note: I realise that
        there are other 6 move LL's concerning the P-shape Orientations, but for
        now I am only interested in this T-shape Orientation, because it is this
        case which appeared twice on my cube in a matter of a few solves.

        It's interesting what computers can do: H. Kociemba's "Cube Explorer"
        found an 18 move sequence that is equivalent to the scramble algorithm
        that was used for the first round at the World Championships: F2 L2 B2
        F2 R' U L2 R D' F' D2 R' F' D L' D L' F The program didn't indicate that
        this was optimal, but it did say that 17 moves was a lower bound. By the
        way, I was super impressed with the interview I read on DanH's web site.
        Before reading the article, the fewest moves challenge was a bit of a
        mystery. I can't admit that the mystery is gone, but the wow-factor has
        increased! Michael Swart

        Hi cubers! Yeah me again, Ive been busy today, just to let you all know
        that the Speedcuber Profiles Submission form on my website
        www.cubestation.co.uk is now WORKING and also is IMPROVED Thanks to my
        best friend and technical advisor Craig Vincent, I can now bring you an
        efficient way of creating/updating your profile, and also an additional
        feature. Now you can upload your Profile picture directly, by using the
        Upload box on the form. Many more improvements to come, im always
        working! (I shall also make an upload picture form for the Speedcuber
        Gallery in a minute or two, so you can upload pictures to the gallery
        directly also) DanH :) [Non-text portions of this message have been

        Simple solution to your 4 corners twisted problem: double-sune and bruno
        (R'U2R2UR2UR2U2R'). DanK/Mirek's Z Perm is the way to go, look up DanK
        video on it... so you don't end up getting a bad habit of the brute
        force alg. I'm going through the same phase, teaching a friend of mine
        that's at about 50s. (Just last night planning how to line up the next 8
        PLLs: he knew the 3 edge ones, so I gave him the T and Y to start off
        with... A and V might be the next step). -Doug --- In

        &gt; Here's where I'm up to at the moment... I've learnt several LL edge
        &gt; algs -- ones that mess with the corners (which doesn't matter if LL
        &gt; edges are oriented first). I already knew several LL edge algs that
        &gt; preserve the corners -- I guess these are useful if the corners are
        &gt; already done when you get to the LL. &gt; &gt; I already know the
        Sune and its mirror (can't imagine there'd be any &gt; cuber who doesn't
        know this alg?!). I've learnt the algs for the &gt; three LL corner
        orientation positions where 2 are corrent and 2 &gt; require twisting.
        Still need to learn the 2 algs for when all 4 &gt; require twisting.
        &gt; &gt; I'm aiming to learn the 13 PLL if my enthusiasm lasts that
        long. In &gt; case it doesn't, I planned the order that I would learn
        the algs. &gt; First I revised the algs that just move the edges since.
        I knew U and &gt; H, but for some reason was a bit iffy with Z. After
        that, I just &gt; ranked them by 'probability of occurrence'. So, of the
        remaining 10, &gt; I've memorised the algs with a frequency of 1/9 or
        greater (A, R, J, &gt; G). So, 7 down, 6 more to go. &gt; &gt; I think I
        need to take a break from new algs and spend some time &gt; getting the
        newly memorised algs firmly planted in my head. I'm &gt; finding that I
        can remember them without a problem, but I'm still &gt; taking a bit of
        time recognising the patterns. I'm not concerned &gt; though because I
        know that practise will fix this! &gt; &gt; Jasmine. &gt; &gt; --- In

        something like this on his site about &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; beginner
        method, an intermediate method and an advanced method. &gt; This &gt;
        &gt; &gt; is actually what I was after. Who else has something like this
        on &gt; &gt; &gt; their site? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll describe the
        beginner and intermediate methods that I once &gt; used. &gt; &gt; They
        are simplications of the Fridrich last layer system. You need &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; first understand how that system works: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html#last &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; This general strategy, orienting first, then permuting, is good
        &gt; because &gt; &gt; it is very easy to recognise the positions
        quickly. But instead of &gt; &gt; orienting all the pieces at once, you
        just orient the edges first, &gt; and &gt; &gt; the corners second. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; BEGINNER METHOD &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, orient the 4
        edges (ie. make a cross). There are only 4 &gt; patterns, &gt; &gt; and
        one algorithm to solve them all! To view this, you need to use a &gt;
        &gt; fixed width font: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- --- -x- -x- &gt; &gt; -x-
        xxx xx- xxx &gt; &gt; --- --- --- -x- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For each
        pattern, apply the algorithm "R'U'F'U F R" and it will &gt; take you
        &gt; &gt; to the next pattern. Eventually you will end up with a cross.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Improvement: notice that if you apply the algorithm
        when you already &gt; &gt; have the cross, you will end up with a line.
        That means that you can &gt; &gt; jump immediately from the 2nd pattern
        to the 4th pattern by &gt; applying the &gt; &gt; algorithm backwards!
        So, this step should take an average of 6 &gt; moves. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Next, orient the corners. There are only 6 patterns apart from &gt;
        solved. &gt; &gt; Look through this complete list, and find all the
        patterns (and &gt; &gt; algorithms) that have a cross already formed:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/orient.html &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; For the case when 3 corners need to be twisted, I recommend the
        &gt; Sune TM &gt; &gt; algorithm from Petrus. See the applet at the
        top/right of his page: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://lar5.com/cube/fas6.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it's useful
        to learn to twist them forwards and backwards: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - R U
        R'U R U2 R' &gt; &gt; - R'U'R U'R'U2 R &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To see that
        done fast, have a look at the quicktime movies at the &gt; bottom &gt;
        &gt; of this page: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://lar5.com/cube/speed.html
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend this algorithm because one of the other
        orientation &gt; cases &gt; &gt; can be solved by just applying this
        algorithm twice. To know which &gt; case &gt; &gt; I'm talking about,
        apply this to a solved cube: RU2R'U'RUR'U'RU'R'. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Now, apply the sune (RUR'URU2R') twice: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUR'URU2R' +
        RUR'URU2R' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notice that the moves in the middle
        cancel out? So you can actually &gt; do: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        RUR'URU'R'URU2R' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is an "optimal" solution.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next, permute the corners (yes, before the edges).
        Most of the time &gt; &gt; there will be a 3 cycle of corners. In this
        case, look at the 4 &gt; sides of &gt; &gt; the last layer. On one of
        the sides, the two last layer corners &gt; will be &gt; &gt; matching in
        colour. Hold those two corners on the back side and do: &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; R'FR' B2 RF'R' B2 R2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now the corners should be
        solved. If you don't find any two corners &gt; that &gt; &gt; match,
        apply the above algorithm and that should result in a &gt; position &gt;
        &gt; where two corners match. Don't worry, this case rarely happens. If
        &gt; you &gt; &gt; want, you can learn a special algorithm for that case
        by picking the &gt; &gt; most attractive one from: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; The "Y" pattern on that page has the desired corner effect. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Next, permute the edges. Again, most of the time, there
        will be a 3 &gt; &gt; cycle of edges. You need to learn to cycle the
        edges forwards and &gt; &gt; backwards: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - R2U
        FB'R2F'BU R2 &gt; &gt; - R2U'FB'R2F'BU'R2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes,
        all 4 edges need to be swapped in opposite pairs. That's &gt; an &gt;
        &gt; easy case, so why not learn it: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RLU2R'L' [U]
        R'L'U2RL &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The [U] means rotate the whole cube from
        the up side, 90 degrees. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's also a rare case
        where all 4 edges need to be swapped in &gt; &gt; adjacent pairs. The
        algorithm's difficult so it's not worth &gt; learning. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; INTERMEDIATE METHOD &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, orient everything
        like the beginner method. Then permute &gt; &gt; everything like the
        full blown Fridrich method. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How can you learn all
        the permutations? See my previous email: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; There, I list which algorithms to learn first, and which
        algorithms &gt; to &gt; &gt; learn last. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ADVANCED
        METHOD &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You already know enough! It is not necessary
        to learn 40 orientation &gt; &gt; algorithms. 6 is enough. Gilles Roux
        proved that it is possible to &gt; &gt; achieve sub-20 times with just
        these 6 orientation algorithms and 13 &gt; &gt; permutation algorithms.
        He used the petrus method for the first two &gt; &gt; layers which gives
        you a cross automatically when you get to the &gt; last &gt; &gt; layer.
        Using that strategy, those extra orientation algorithms are &gt; not
        &gt; &gt; needed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ryan

        I would like to suggest two slightly different algorithms for these
        cases, then you can make a choice as which ones you like best. For the
        "double-sune" case the fast and very easily remembered F (R U R' U' R U
        R' U' R U R' U') F' = F (R U R' U')*3 F' is a nice algorithm. This is
        what I think is an order-2 alg, so do it once and you get the case, do
        it twice and you get back to where you started. For the "bruno", I would
        suggest the inverse of Doug's algorithm, but this time there isn't that
        much to choose between them. But when performing R U2 R2 U' R2 U' R2 U2
        R' - it can all be done in one fluid motion, as there is more scope for
        using the left index finger to make the U' whilst the right hand is
        working on the R2's Once you get your left and right hands working in
        time with each other, this alg can be very fast indeed. The R2 U2 R' at
        the end is quite tough however. Good Luck in learning them all! DanH :)

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's where I'm up to at the moment... I've learnt
        several LL &gt; edge &gt; &gt; algs -- ones that mess with the corners
        (which doesn't matter if &gt; LL &gt; &gt; edges are oriented first). I
        already knew several LL edge algs &gt; that &gt; &gt; preserve the
        corners -- I guess these are useful if the corners &gt; are &gt; &gt;
        already done when you get to the LL. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I already know
        the Sune and its mirror (can't imagine there'd be &gt; any &gt; &gt;
        cuber who doesn't know this alg?!). I've learnt the algs for the &gt;
        &gt; three LL corner orientation positions where 2 are corrent and 2
        &gt; &gt; require twisting. Still need to learn the 2 algs for when all
        4 &gt; &gt; require twisting. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm aiming to learn
        the 13 PLL if my enthusiasm lasts that long. &gt; In &gt; &gt; case it
        doesn't, I planned the order that I would learn the algs. &gt; &gt;
        First I revised the algs that just move the edges since. I knew U &gt;
        and &gt; &gt; H, but for some reason was a bit iffy with Z. After that,
        I just &gt; &gt; ranked them by 'probability of occurrence'. So, of the
        remaining &gt; 10, &gt; &gt; I've memorised the algs with a frequency of
        1/9 or greater (A, R, &gt; J, &gt; &gt; G). So, 7 down, 6 more to go.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I need to take a break from new algs and
        spend some time &gt; &gt; getting the newly memorised algs firmly
        planted in my head. I'm &gt; &gt; finding that I can remember them
        without a problem, but I'm still &gt; &gt; taking a bit of time
        recognising the patterns. I'm not concerned &gt; &gt; though because I
        know that practise will fix this! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jasmine. &gt; &gt;

        that DanK had something like this on his site &gt; about &gt; &gt; a
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginner method, an intermediate method and an
        advanced &gt; method. &gt; &gt; This &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is actually
        what I was after. Who else has something like this &gt; on &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; their site? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll describe the
        beginner and intermediate methods that I once &gt; &gt; used. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; They are simplications of the Fridrich last layer system. You &gt;
        need &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; first understand how that system works:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html#last &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; This general strategy, orienting first, then permuting,
        is good &gt; &gt; because &gt; &gt; &gt; it is very easy to recognise
        the positions quickly. But instead &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; orienting all
        the pieces at once, you just orient the edges &gt; first, &gt; &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the corners second. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        BEGINNER METHOD &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, orient the 4 edges
        (ie. make a cross). There are only 4 &gt; &gt; patterns, &gt; &gt; &gt;
        and one algorithm to solve them all! To view this, you need to &gt; use
        a &gt; &gt; &gt; fixed width font: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- ---
        -x- -x- &gt; &gt; &gt; -x- xxx xx- xxx &gt; &gt; &gt; --- --- --- -x-
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For each pattern, apply the algorithm
        "R'U'F'U F R" and it will &gt; &gt; take you &gt; &gt; &gt; to the next
        pattern. Eventually you will end up with a cross. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Improvement: notice that if you apply the algorithm when you
        &gt; already &gt; &gt; &gt; have the cross, you will end up with a line.
        That means that you &gt; can &gt; &gt; &gt; jump immediately from the
        2nd pattern to the 4th pattern by &gt; &gt; applying the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        algorithm backwards! So, this step should take an average of 6 &gt; &gt;
        moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next, orient the corners. There are
        only 6 patterns apart from &gt; &gt; solved. &gt; &gt; &gt; Look through
        this complete list, and find all the patterns (and &gt; &gt; &gt;
        algorithms) that have a cross already formed: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/orient.html &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the case when 3 corners need to be twisted, I
        recommend the &gt; &gt; Sune TM &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithm from Petrus.
        See the applet at the top/right of his &gt; page: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; http://lar5.com/cube/fas6.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        think it's useful to learn to twist them forwards and &gt; backwards:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - R U R'U R U2 R' &gt; &gt; &gt; - R'U'R
        U'R'U2 R &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To see that done fast, have a
        look at the quicktime movies at &gt; the &gt; &gt; bottom &gt; &gt; &gt;
        of this page: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://lar5.com/cube/speed.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        recommend this algorithm because one of the other orientation &gt; &gt;
        cases &gt; &gt; &gt; can be solved by just applying this algorithm
        twice. To know &gt; which &gt; &gt; case &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm talking
        about, apply this to a solved cube: &gt; RU2R'U'RUR'U'RU'R'. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, apply the sune (RUR'URU2R') twice: &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUR'URU2R' + RUR'URU2R' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Notice that the moves in the middle cancel out? So you can &gt;
        actually &gt; &gt; do: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUR'URU'R'URU2R'
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is an "optimal" solution. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next, permute the corners (yes, before the edges).
        Most of the &gt; time &gt; &gt; &gt; there will be a 3 cycle of corners.
        In this case, look at the 4 &gt; &gt; sides of &gt; &gt; &gt; the last
        layer. On one of the sides, the two last layer corners &gt; &gt; will be
        &gt; &gt; &gt; matching in colour. Hold those two corners on the back
        side and &gt; do: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R'FR' B2 RF'R' B2 R2
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now the corners should be solved. If you
        don't find any two &gt; corners &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; match,
        apply the above algorithm and that should result in a &gt; &gt; position
        &gt; &gt; &gt; where two corners match. Don't worry, this case rarely
        happens. &gt; If &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; want, you can learn a
        special algorithm for that case by picking &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; most
        attractive one from: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; The "Y" pattern on that page has the desired corner
        effect. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next, permute the edges. Again,
        most of the time, there will be &gt; a 3 &gt; &gt; &gt; cycle of edges.
        You need to learn to cycle the edges forwards and &gt; &gt; &gt;
        backwards: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - R2U FB'R2F'BU R2 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; - R2U'FB'R2F'BU'R2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes, all 4
        edges need to be swapped in opposite pairs. &gt; That's &gt; &gt; an
        &gt; &gt; &gt; easy case, so why not learn it: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; RLU2R'L' [U] R'L'U2RL &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The [U] means
        rotate the whole cube from the up side, 90 degrees. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; There's also a rare case where all 4 edges need to be swapped
        in &gt; &gt; &gt; adjacent pairs. The algorithm's difficult so it's not
        worth &gt; &gt; learning. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INTERMEDIATE
        METHOD &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, orient everything like the
        beginner method. Then permute &gt; &gt; &gt; everything like the full
        blown Fridrich method. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How can you learn
        all the permutations? See my previous email: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; c &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There, I list which algorithms to
        learn first, and which &gt; algorithms &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; learn
        last. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ADVANCED METHOD &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; You already know enough! It is not necessary to learn 40 &gt;
        orientation &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms. 6 is enough. Gilles Roux proved
        that it is possible &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; achieve sub-20 times with
        just these 6 orientation algorithms &gt; and 13 &gt; &gt; &gt;
        permutation algorithms. He used the petrus method for the first &gt; two
        &gt; &gt; &gt; layers which gives you a cross automatically when you get
        to the &gt; &gt; last &gt; &gt; &gt; layer. Using that strategy, those
        extra orientation algorithms &gt; are &gt; &gt; not &gt; &gt; &gt;
        needed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ryan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To

        while i really enjoyed the wc2003 event, i'm happy to hear they are
        considering having speedstacks produce a custom rubik's timer. it sounds
        like a lot of people liked the cup-stacking timers, but i am glad to
        hear that more suitable timers are being considered. the cup-stacking
        timers were better than just using a stopwatch though, as they provided
        a consistent framework for timing solutions. a couple problems i saw
        with the cup-stacking timers: 1. i saw several contestants push the
        yellow circles after they finished their solution and the timer kept
        running. this may have been due to the solver not slapping the yellow
        spots correctly, but it happened often enough that i have a hard time
        believing that so many people were too unskilled to stop the timer
        properly. 2. the cube was required to absorb a small impact (from
        dropping it) if you wanted to try to get your hands to the yellow spots
        as fast as possible. this small impact can actually rotate the face of a
        really loose cube 1/8 turn thus causing your puzzle to be unsolved. i
        saw this heppen to a couple of competitors.

        fingers won't provide enough heat, which is why palms work best. Also,
        the Rubiks timers should have a pad for the cube that is pressure
        sensitive, so you have to pick the cube up and it starts then put the
        cube back and it stops. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Dan, A timer unit, using a light and a light sensor to start and stop

        true, but the trouble is if the speedstack timer setup isn't used, then
        one cannot fairly compare times from the previous world championship to
        the next one. Thus making the World Record time insignificant. DanH :)

        that's too bad-- 50k seems like highway robbery. if i were seventowns i
        certainly wouldn't do it for that cost. it would be hard to think that
        they could ever sell $50k worth of additional rubik's cubes as a result
        of the existence of a specialized timer in competitions. i wonder why it
        costs so much? it seems that it should just be a matter of not attaching
        the foam mat to the timer, and instead connecting the timer to a small

        lot of people liked the cup-stacking timers, but i am &gt; &gt; glad to
        hear that more suitable timers are being considered. the &gt; &gt;
        cup-stacking timers were better than just using a stopwatch though, &gt;
        &gt; as they provided a consistent framework for timing solutions. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; a couple problems i saw with the cup-stacking timers:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. i saw several contestants push the yellow circles
        after they &gt; &gt; finished their solution and the timer kept running.
        this may have &gt; &gt; been due to the solver not slapping the yellow
        spots correctly, but &gt; &gt; it happened often enough that i have a
        hard time believing that so &gt; &gt; many people were too unskilled to
        stop the timer properly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. the cube was required to
        absorb a small impact (from dropping &gt; &gt; it) if you wanted to try
        to get your hands to the yellow spots as &gt; &gt; fast as possible.
        this small impact can actually rotate the face &gt; of &gt; &gt; a
        really loose cube 1/8 turn thus causing your puzzle to be &gt; &gt;
        unsolved. i saw this heppen to a couple of competitors.

        I see two general issues that are being discussed: 1. How the timer is
        started and stopped. 2. How well the timer works when someone does what
        they're supposed to do to start and stop it. Regarding #1, doesn't
        having the time start/stop based on picking up and putting down the cube
        cause trouble if the cube is dropped onto the mat or if someone rests
        their hands on the mat while solving? Using the StackMat, you put the
        cube down and put your hands on the spots to indicate you're done. It's
        a more accurate indicator that you're done than just dropping the cube
        on the pad. But having said that, I can see there being debate between
        speedcubers who want these timers to record time the absolute fastest
        way and people who want to compromise a tenth of a second to make sure
        the timer accurately interprets the start/stop events. Regarding #2,
        I've read the posts about slapping versus pressing, using palms vs
        fingertips, and it occurs to me that there are many more cup stacking
        events than speedcubing events... if we are having these problems (I
        mean if it's a big problem for us as a group, rather than just a small
        number of people who aren't stopping the timer correctly) then the cup
        stackers must be too. And the people at SpeedStacks are going to have
        incentive to make the sensors work better. So that's a problem that's
        going to work itself out without our relatively small group having to do
        anything about it. Adam --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; &gt; Also, the Rubiks timers should have a pad for the cube that is

        complete the final move *after* you've stopped the timer. The way to get
        the best legal times is to get as close as possible to this, and it will
        be really hard to determine if somebody was near, on or over the border
        line. I doubt that was a problem in Toronto, since everyone was so new

        was ideal. It starts when you lift the cube, and stop when you put it
        down. You can imagine border line scenarios there too, but it's much
        harder. PS. If anyone thinks they can design a manufacturable cube timer
        for way under $50k, *this* is the perfect time to underbid the

        You really reccomend the smaller 4x4x4 over a normal sized one? I've had
        bad experiences with mefferts, but I suppose I'm willing to give him one
        more shot. The semi-broken pyraminx exploded after I solved it exactly 1
        time from getting it in the mail from him. I kinda rigged it back
        together, but it makes speed pyraminxing out of the question. My
        megaminx also had one of the edges glued to one of the centers, making
        certain turns impossible, and it was missing a few stickers. And lastly,
        of the 2 5x5's I've ordered from him, 1 was the wrong color scheme, the
        other one explodes after about 20 turns, useless. The only other thing
        I've ordered from him was my first 4x4, and admittedly, I dropped that

        They are not a whole lot smaller in size, but they probably weigh half

        I agree with Adam and DanH, and Eric makes a good point about the bounce
        of the cube on the pad altering the angle of a layer. Now I think the
        pads are nearly ideal... Perhaps something like shortening the length of
        the pad since we cubists don't need all that space or adding some sort
        of net to catch the cube when we let it hang in the air as we slap, may
        be nice. Now I highly..., highly doubt that it would take $50K to
        re-engineer the timer, but I am no expert in this matter. The
        light-sensitive diode idea does not sound too appealing to me at all.
        Regarding Petrus's comments, I think that in anything it is quite
        possible to "cheat the system." If you think about it, the mats are
        quite similar to what we do at home, with the exception of not holding
        the cube in our hand when we start the timer (or hands it you use a
        countdown), but this would obviously not fly in competition standards.
        As a final note, stop blaming the timer for those precious hundredths of
        a second... Practice a bit and knot off some tenths! Just make a
        reasonable goal or yourself on what times you can get "in that
        particular setting, using whatever 'official' timer." I solve the cube
        in about 23s on an average of 100 consecutive at home, my goal was only
        to break 20 on one solve at WC (came very, close btw)... it is typical
        that in WC environment to be a lot slower (oh... don't start blaming the
        lighting and timers) for the execption of Grant, who said he was
        affected differently by the pressure/adrenalin of it all. -Doug --- In

        For the exception of Akimoto I believe, but his cubes are VERY well
        broaken in and he is used to fixing pops quickly sort of as a reflex...
        I can't imagine his cube not poping at least twice during each of his
        solves. And btw, Ron prefers the mini-5x5, but likes another brand for
        4x4. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Grant Tregay"

        Agreed, don't expect your new cubes to come in the mail all ready for
        speedcubing and forceful twisting... that's what we have Ton for (Cube

        I think that to be regarded as a master at something you need to not
        just be extremely fast or proficent at something, but to be knowledgable
        at it, to have made some significant contributions to the field, to be
        extremely dedicated in its practice, and to have developed your own
        techniques: i.e. (in our case) algorithms, triggers, signature moves if
        you will, have something out there that other people appriciate and add
        to their own solving. Just being fast is not enough, but being a big
        math geek and able to converse about the cube in a sophisticated manner
        helps A LOT. I could go through and list a bunch (&gt;30) of people
        (cubists) that I regard as masters but then I'd probably accidently
        leave someone out so I will only indicate one :). As a rule of thumb,
        the younger one is, the less likely he/she is a master, the more likely
        he/she will become a master some day. Because only through
        age/experience does one gain true wisdom (cube wisdom if you will).

        Dan, May I recommend an electronic component inside the cube that can
        report on it's state and a signal processor to receive the signal from
        several cubes at once. This could be a standard item to fit any
        authentic cube, and it would count from a "go" sound until it sensed it
        was solved. This could be backed by videotape. That way the speedcubist
        wouldn't have to pick up the cube or put it down. Additional technical
        aspect: when the 10 or 15 second inspection clock begins its countdown
        the cube is picked up and examined. When that time is elapsed the run
        time begins, perhaps preceeded by a condown, and a horn is sounded and a
        light flashes on, or something. The time starts then regardless but will
        be started sooner with the completion of a quarter turn, (and the time
        taken by that turn is also counted). The cubist is allowed to put the
        cube down. When the cube is solved it sends a signal to the signal
        processor which list the time, and the cube, appropriately in
        competition files and on a board with other times. The device could also
        record and display the moves made to solve the cube. Heck, I could spend

        easier said than done I think. When does a turn start and end, and what
        are the tolerances? Cubists don't make _exact_ 1/4 turns. Then there is
        the problem of making an 1/8 of a turn and possibly retracting a move,
        and also full 180 degree turns. The source of power is another
        interesting problem which I tried to solve when trying to make an
        electro-luminescent cube, namely how does one light all the panels? Mark

        That ould be achieved by a solvibng program, fazt or slow. When that nis
        done, speedcubists reach for anorther unsolved cube. For 3d cube
        artists, that is the first step. Next you have to put a paattern on
        cubes by conventional (judicious) twiddling, make sure all cubes are
        properly color-synchronized, and stack them together. THAT is rhe
        program I am looking for! I did not solve this using a computer, and
        don't have available code for this, otherwise you'd be hearing about it.

        Here is an idea that will benefit the speedcubing community. Develop a
        program that can be used to verify that a cube has been scrambled
        properly during competitions. The program must accept two inputs: 1) the
        colors on the competitor's F,U,R,D,L,B faces, and 2)the desired scramble
        pattern. The output is a picture showing how the faces should look
        following the scramble. This output would be used by the scramblers to
        ensure that they scrambled the cube properly for each and every

        I definitely have a preference for the smaller, lighter, and more
        delicate 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 (I think mine are EastSheen?). Possibly because
        I'm a girl, and thus have smaller hands than most other cubers. I've had
        a play with the standard size 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes which I found too
        big for me and certainly too heavy. I think I'd end up with a wrist
        injury if I cubed with those monsters (seriously!) If you have large
        hands and strong fingers, you'd probably prefer the standard size. I use
        slice moves sometimes when solving the 4x4x4 and the 5x5x5 and if my
        hands/fingers were larger then this would be quite difficult with my
        small cubes. Jasmine. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I just discovered the wonderfull world of foot-cubing and it is actually
        quite fun. My best unlucky time is 4:01.55 and if I'm not mistaken,
        that's an unofficial world record! I rarely get above 6 minutes and have
        solved no more than 15 cubes with my feet. My solution is rather long
        and I was surprised at my times but my toe dexterity is probably better
        than any cuber since I don't wear shoes which allows the muscles there
        to grow strong. The only problem is I sometimes get lost in the middle
        of algorithms and have to stop and go through the alg in my head
        pretending I'm doing it with my hands. It would help if I had another
        cube in my hands in which to do these algs and get the moves down before
        I do it with my feet but I don't know if that would be allowed. Do any
        other foot cubers have any usefull tips or technique they use or good
        adbvice. I would be interested to hear any. The surface is quite
        important the best one I could find so far for foot-cubing is a rug.
        Surfaces too soft make very hard to align the faces but ones to hard
        make it very hard to turn them. A soft rug is a good compromise. Maybe
        this could be made into an official event at WC2005. My goal will be to
        get a sub 3 minute time which I think is very possibel. happy cubing,

        doing it two-handed, with one hand, with the other &gt; hand... As I
        remember, I did it only once or twice at that time, and I &gt; didn't

        And the rest &gt; is history... Before I agreed to do it on TV, I had to
        try it again and &gt; this time it took 1/2 h or more, since you easily

        some serious &gt; practice, it should be no problem to beat 5 minutes.

        &gt; &gt; It was the same for me. My first one handed time was around
        eight &gt; &gt; minutes, when I was just joking around. I didn't
        actually plan on &gt; &gt; getting good at it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        think that being fast at the cube has a lot to do with brains, but &gt;
        &gt; if you're a genius but don't have good dexterity, you won't ever be
        &gt; &gt; tremendously good. And vice versa. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW,
        Chris, about the finger tricks you talked about in your last &gt; &gt;
        post. I found out that when I'm actually going quickly one handed, &gt;
        &gt; my hands are never in the right position to use that. They're never
        &gt; &gt; in the right position to use any finger other than my thumb or
        first &gt; &gt; finger. It's probably just a habit I picked up as I
        learned to go &gt; &gt; fast. Did you encounter this? &gt; &gt; &gt;

        have to agree with Grant in that it &gt; &gt; was, &gt; &gt; &gt; for me
        at least, just lots and lots and lots of practice. I &gt; &gt; started
        &gt; &gt; &gt; by just trying to find more efficient ways to do the
        normal moves, &gt; &gt; &gt; clockwise and counter clockwise on each
        face. Then after I felt &gt; &gt; &gt; comfortable with that I came up
        with the "finger tricks" that I &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in my last post
        by simply trying to do moves with my &gt; &gt; &gt; fingers instead of
        always alternating finger/thumb/finger/thumb. &gt; &gt; By &gt; &gt;
        &gt; practicing a lot I also noticed that my times got faster simply
        &gt; &gt; &gt; because my hand was getting stronger. Also by practicing
        a lot, &gt; &gt; &gt; hence making your hand a little stronger, it
        becomes easier to do &gt; &gt; &gt; even more kinds of "finger tricks".
        Then the next step was to &gt; &gt; &gt; practice each OLL and PLL to
        find the fastest ways to do each one &gt; &gt; &gt; with only the use of
        one hand. That also helped to make sure I &gt; &gt; &gt; would get
        "amnesia" less often, a nuisance which still comes up (I &gt; &gt; &gt;
        got one handed amnesia for the OLL of my second solve at the WC). &gt;
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; guess I decided to put a lot of time into it after
        breaking Matt &gt; &gt; &gt; Wilder's time of 48 seconds. I remember
        thinking that it would be &gt; &gt; &gt; almost impossible to get that
        fast, then after practicing off and &gt; &gt; on &gt; &gt; &gt; for a
        while I finally got it! I couldn't believe that I was able &gt; &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; &gt; do it, and each time I set a new record I always noticed
        something &gt; &gt; &gt; else that I could improve on. That started the
        whole snowball &gt; &gt; &gt; effect for my times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I don't think it's so much a question of inherent dexterity
        and &gt; &gt; &gt; visual spacial skill, at least for one handed, but
        more a question &gt; &gt; &gt; of just lots and lots of practice to
        improve your dexterity and &gt; &gt; your &gt; &gt; &gt; hand strength.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's just my two cents. I know its the
        piece of advice that no &gt; &gt; &gt; one likes to hear, but at least
        for one handed it is all about &gt; &gt; lots &gt; &gt; &gt; of
        practice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        In fact, I expected that quite a few people did it with their feet as a
        way of exploring the cube (and one's own ability). Maybe I got this idea
        since I am from the first generation of cube-twisters. I got hold of a
        cube before the hysteria in the beginning of the 80ies and I solved the
        cube myself without instructions. /Anders unipsycho6 wrote: &gt; I sort

        &gt; &gt; when I got tired of doing it two-handed, with one hand, with
        the &gt; other &gt; &gt; hand... As I remember, I did it only once or

        on &gt; &gt; the CityTV Breakfast Television show on the Friday morning.
        And &gt; the rest &gt; &gt; is history... Before I agreed to do it on
        TV, I had to try it &gt; again and &gt; &gt; this time it took 1/2 h or
        more, since you easily get lost in the &gt; &gt; sequences. When I got
        the idea how to work it out, it took less &gt; than 15 &gt; &gt;

        Great barefoot CHRIS, you're already below my ambitious 5 min goal! I
        agree that the first problem foot-cubers encounter is that you can get
        lost in the middle of a sequence. One other problem for me is the slice
        move. I do not true slice moves with my feet. I have to turn each
        opposite faces individually and then rotate the cube. And I do quite a
        lot of slice moves. To avoid the unnecessary cube rotations, I have to
        slightly modifiy the sequences. I prefer to solve the cube on a rug. But
        I had no problem to solve it on concrete, but that is not healthy for
        the cube. For speedcubing, a not too soft rug is to prefer. I think that
        having another cube in your hands, trying things out, should not be
        allowed in competitions. Anyhow, I belive that such an aid would help in
        practising foot-cubing, but I do not think that it helps getting faster
        times when speedcubing. We can make foot-cubing to be official the next
        WC. It was "almost" official at WC2003. /Anders dishwashersafe22 wrote:

        I &gt; sometimes get lost in the middle of algorithms and have to stop
        and &gt; go through the alg in my head pretending I'm doing it with my
        hands. &gt; It would help if I had another cube in my hands in which to
        do these &gt; algs and get the moves down before I do it with my feet

        have any &gt; usefull tips or technique they use or good adbvice. I
        would be &gt; interested to hear any. The surface is quite important the
        best one &gt; I could find so far for foot-cubing is a rug. Surfaces too
        soft make &gt; very hard to align the faces but ones to hard make it
        very hard to &gt; turn them. A soft rug is a good compromise. Maybe this
        could be made &gt; into an official event at WC2005. My goal will be to

        solved the cube with my feet the first time some 20 years or so &gt; ago
        &gt; &gt; when I got tired of doing it two-handed, with one hand, with

        TV, I had to try it &gt; again and &gt; &gt; this time it took 1/2 h or
        more, since you easily get lost in the &gt; &gt; sequences. When I got
        the idea how to work it out, it took less &gt; than 15 &gt; &gt;

        I &gt; solved &gt; &gt; the cube in more than 12 minutes, after
        embarrassing myself for &gt; some &gt; &gt; minute during the placement
        of the last edges. I have only solved &gt; the &gt; &gt; cube with my
        feet 10 time or so. With just a little more practice &gt; I &gt; &gt;
        should be able to do it securely within 10 minutes. With some &gt;

        Ok, try http://cs.felk.cvut.cz/~xobitko/ga/ That should get you started
        on genetic algorihtms. Actually these kind of algorithms are nothing
        more than very fancy search engines. But with 43 trillion possible
        states and some order higher for paths to a clean state, you'd have to
        have some incredible search algorithm. These AI program can never be as
        good as the Kociemba method, which does a full search in various groups.
        Now, neural networks are more like pattern recognisers, just like we
        are! They have to be tought in order to get better, and of course that
        would never work as good as brute force. I would suggest against neural
        networks for this specific problem, because using fridrich of petrus'
        system you only need to look at a few cases in order to find a solution
        to the next step. I'd say first try to implement one simple system and a
        backtracking algorithm. That should definitely get you on your way. And
        of course I'd be very interested to see the results! Michiel --- In

        Yes, but those "cube-ins" have LONG since faded away... On the bright
        side there are some college cubists now that are starting up campus cube
        clubs in major universities. Hopefully there will be a large following
        at Purdue and my school, U-Mich. There probably can't be more then 5
        cubists (&lt;90s) at MIT anyways. For most serious students, cubing
        either doesn't seem too appealing, isn't worth the effort, or think it's
        a waste of time. On the contrary, it probably makes you smarter,

        The probability should be the same. There are 4 ways for the LL to be
        done (U, U2, U', or no turn) and for that one alg to work there should
        be the same 4 ways for it to happen. Either way the pieces have only 1
        way to line up relative to each other. Dan Harris

        or take a U turn) Then this morning, I have had the next shortest LL
        case, not once, but twice! That is the T orientation (F R U R' U' F')
        and then no Permutation. Is this a lot more likely to occur than a
        Luckiest Last Layer? For instance, I know that the chance of the LLL is
        something resembling 1/(216*72) (please correct me if this is wrong),
        and I also know the probability of the T-orientation is 1/54. Performing
        the T-orientation also executes the "Arrow" Permutation (Case 15 on my
        site) which has a probability of 1/18, so presumably for the 6 move LL
        to occur this has to be at the correct angle when executing the
        Orientation, which makes the probability 1/(18*4) = 1/72 So does this
        make the probability of this particular 6 move LL 1/(54*72) ? Or am I
        completely wrong (Most likely, I'm no good at probability theory! Is
        there some conditional probability stuff going on here?) Food for
        thought! DanH :) Note: I realise that there are other 6 move LL's
        concerning the P-shape Orientations, but for now I am only interested in
        this T-shape Orientation, because it is this case which appeared twice
        on my cube in a matter of a few solves. [Non-text portions of this

        I no longer cube corners-first so use very few slice moves now I but can
        do them with my feet. I arch by big toe so the toe and the balls of my
        foot so they lie on the back edge of the BUR &amp; FUR corners and the
        slice can be pulled by the UR edge with the other foot. You need big
        feet and a well lubed cube though. Cube rotations are another problem.
        Maybe I will learn some new algs. Two Generator sequences are easy also.

        you're already below my ambitious 5 min goal! &gt; &gt; I agree that the
        first problem foot-cubers encounter is that you can get &gt; lost in the
        middle of a sequence. One other problem for me is the slice &gt; move. I
        do not true slice moves with my feet. I have to turn each &gt; opposite
        faces individually and then rotate the cube. And I do quite a &gt; lot
        of slice moves. To avoid the unnecessary cube rotations, I have to &gt;
        slightly modifiy the sequences. &gt; &gt; I prefer to solve the cube on
        a rug. But I had no problem to solve it on &gt; concrete, but that is
        not healthy for the cube. For speedcubing, a not &gt; too soft rug is to
        prefer. &gt; &gt; I think that having another cube in your hands, trying
        things out, &gt; should not be allowed in competitions. Anyhow, I belive
        that such an aid &gt; would help in practising foot-cubing, but I do not
        think that it helps &gt; getting faster times when speedcubing. &gt;
        &gt; We can make foot-cubing to be official the next WC. It was "almost"

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I solved the cube with my feet the first time some

        the Friday morning. And &gt; &gt; the rest &gt; &gt; &gt; is history...
        Before I agreed to do it on TV, I had to try it &gt; &gt; again and &gt;
        &gt; &gt; this time it took 1/2 h or more, since you easily get lost in
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; sequences. When I got the idea how to work it out, it

        embarrassing myself for &gt; &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; minute during the
        placement of the last edges. I have only solved &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; cube with my feet 10 time or so. With just a little more practice
        &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; should be able to do it securely within 10
        minutes. With some &gt; &gt; serious &gt; &gt; &gt; practice, it should

        Hi, I used regular 4x4 and 5x5 at WC. I think the matter is not only the
        size but the mechanics. More pieces makes more joints. Those makes cube
        more flabby, theoretically. Eastsheen (mini-) 4x4 has more pieces than
        Rubik's and is too flabby for me to do. As same as 3x3, flabby cube is
        not good for speed. That is (was) one reason why I prefer Rubik's 4x4.
        However, I was surprised that Eastsheen cubes, which David, Ron and the
        othe peoples use, are so nice. (Unfortunately, I have not tried Grant's.
        ) And I was really really surprised that they don't care even color
        scheme. At least they have not restickered ugly purple color stickers.
        If they pay some effort to resticker big cube, they might be able to do
        much faster. And I might abuse Eastsheen cubes or the lot was not good.
        Easheen 5x5 has a plastic wall inside. I think if they make the wall
        from some kind of metal, it may become more solid and better. My
        mini-5x5 is also flabby and explosive. Regular 5x5 sometimes causes
        flipping pop of inner cubbies but I can fix easily and it is definitely
        better than explosion! I don't want to collect a hundred of pieces
        around. But I would like to try another mini-4x4 and 5x5 one more time.

        Sorry, I am notorious for my spelling and typo goofs, and for that
        reason alone, I cannot be a master. :-)) I am not a speed cubist, but I
        understamnd that the masters in this discipline are Jessica Fridrich and
        Lars Petrus. Anyone else, that would satisfy the above ctriterion, that
        is, developing HIS or HER OWN METHOD? There is a room for masters in
        other disciplines of cubing, such as computer cubing, cube art, even
        cube svience. This last discipline uses the cube to formulate new
        scientific and mathematical concepts, that have been previously unknown.

        Akimoto Eastsheen cubes look flabby and weak, I agree. Never had

        I'm not a fast 4^3 cuber so I can't speak on this subject, but sometimes
        I prefer heavy cubes, and that's why I tried to make a heavy 3^3 cube. I
        filled the edge parts with putty (don't know if it's the right word -
        "mastic" in french). It makes the cube twice as heavy (it needs strong
        springs). A lot more inertia, very pleasant. Something you could try if
        you haven't yet. Gilles.

        i have been playing around with an idea lately, and wanteed to air it to
        this crowd. When i see an algorithm like URUR'U'F'U'F it doesnt tell me
        anything about how someone would perform that algo. with a notation like
        U(RUR)'U'(F'U'F) it would tell me that this algo consists of two
        separate finger tricks, but not how they are performed. with a notation
        like : {lt}U {w}R {ri}U {w}R {li}U {w}F' {li}U' {w}F i'm trying to say
        how i perform this algo. w = whole hand. more like 3 fingers, but not a
        singel digit. lt = left thumb li = left index finger ri = right index
        finger etc. now you would have a pretty good idea how i perform that
        algo, and it's probably not the best way of doing it :) Could this be
        interresting tom anyone but me, and / or does anything like this
        notation already exist ? Terje

        my opinion is that in most circumstances, the actual fingers you are
        using isn't all that useful to other speed cubers. for it to be
        complete, you would also need to indicate how the other hand is holding
        the cube. so it seems that if you want to convey exactly how you do an
        alg, it's most accurate to just post a link to a video. i am in in the
        process of learning the 57 LL orientation algs. i'm good enough to know
        all the basic finger tricks and how to achieve economy of motion. after
        dissecting an alg and making my own method for doing it, i usually check
        out some of the tutorials that show videos of other speedcubers doing
        it. 80% of the time i like my way better-- although sometimes i'll scrap
        what i just did and start over with some new ideas from a video. that
        doesn't mean that 80% of the time the other people are slower or worse,
        it just means that we're different. there are times when i just don't
        see a good way to perform an alg, and i'll check out video's for ideas.
        i rarely end up doing exactly what someone else did though. if i were
        stumped on how to perform an alg, i don't think that a written notation
        is what i would turn to for ideas. a video just seems much better for
        this kind of thing. -eric --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I think that could be pretty cool! My guess is that a more high level
        notation would be most useful. That is, instead of describing in detail
        what each finger does, name and classify all finger tricks. There can't
        be all that many of them. 20? Depends on how you classify them I guess.
        So instead of {lh}L' {li}U' {lh}L (lh = left hand), you'd write
        {ptr}(L'U'L), where {ptr} is a code for "push trigger" or whatever
        that's called. You'd still want the low level notation to explain
        unusual movements, I suppose. OTOH, the simple grouping of moves would
        very often be enough to tell us what tricks to use. Of course you'll get
        more info from a video, but with a notation you'll be able to just read
        something and understand it, rather than the at least several minutes
        (if you're online) it takes to download and watch video. Or if you're
        the author, you can just write 15 characters in an email, instead of the
        immense hassle of recording a video and posting it online. Or if you're
        writing down notes by hand in your cube study notebook... you get the
        idea. Or think of it this way: Sometimes it's better to listen to a
        recording of speech, but that doesn't mean that the written language is
        not useful also. Maybe it won't be used a lot. We don't talk a lot about
        such matters. But then again, maybe one reason for that is that we don't
        have a language to talk and write about them in? /Lars At 11:47 +0200

        I think that it is already enough to put in () and to have
        distinctintion between something like R2' and R2. With a bit of
        experiecnce it is VERY easy to recognize what one should do for any
        given trigger. Besides, we perform triggers slightly differently amongst
        ourselves, so it is really up to the executor on how to grip and stuff.
        With even more experience it is not impossible to look at a raw
        algoirthm and parse out the triggers yourself - I do this all the time
        and am writing code to do this automatically for my future algorithm
        database. Lars's idea with naming the individual triggers might be nice;
        I do this a bit: I call (R'UR') flick-towards, (RU'R) flick-away, hem...
        a bunch more with names too silly to mention here. I'd like to know what
        some of you out there would name the basic commutator (RU'R'U) though.
        The problem is basically this: the advanced people don't need this extra
        notation, and the beginners may get confused by it. Also I'd find it
        somewhat annoying to be 'told' which finger to use. -Doug --- In

        Most cubers are familiar with the fact that the cube can be in over 43
        quintillion positions. It's made me think of several questions... 1.) A
        lot of the positions of the cube are the same, but only
        differentiate(spelling?) by a simple cube rotation. If I researched
        correctly, in any given scrambled state, there are 11 other scrambled
        states that are exactly the same, only different by cube rotation. Just
        a thought anyway, if I'm wrong please let me know, because i'm
        interested to know. 2.)now if i'm right about there being 11 seperate
        but exact cases that differ only by rotations, you could divide the 43
        quintillion by 12. This gives you something over 3.5 quintillion, or
        3,500,000,000,000,000,000 different positions. A rough estimation on
        total sales for the rubik's cube was a number around 500 million.
        (according to the source i saw) Next I try to figure in my minds-eye how
        many turns are made on the average 3x3 in it's "lifetime" Cubers like
        all of us have made thousands of turns, some people have made hundreds
        of thousands, maybe millions, i don't know. But a good lot of people
        only make a few hundred moves before destroying their cube, ripping
        stickers off, etc. So to be generous we'll say that each of the 500
        million cubes sold had on average 500 turns made on it. So in total, 250
        billion turns made, or 250,000,000,000. Lets just pretend that each turn
        made represents a possible position of the 3.5+
        quintillion.(un-realistic i know) Assuming all the math and assumptions
        i've made are correct, which they probably aren't, that would mean that
        we have only got 1/14,000,000 of all possible positions on the cube. So
        there are scrambled states that haven't been acheived yet. And at this
        rate, we have a long time before we hit every one of those positions.
        for all of you who attempted following along with my undeveloped,

        Actually, you wouldn't divide the number of positions by 11, you would

        My 2 cents on this notation idea- I personally love videos and get the
        ideas for many of my algs from watching them. It is just about the best
        way to show how an alg is preformed. I don't mind waiting for them to
        load. I agree many sites just put parenthesis around a bunch of letters
        which means nothing to me. I kinda like the idea about assigning names
        to different triggers the same way LarsP does to his algs. There are
        only so many of them and how to preform them could be explained or
        showed by videos like on DanK's site. Doug does make a good point about
        the advanced not needing it and the beginners getting confused by it so
        I think the common notation used now accompanied by a *SLOW* video is

        I always did wonder if that calculation took into account unmarked
        centers. As a regular cube is not the same after applying R L U R' L' U2
        R L U R' L' U2. As that algorithm flips the U center 180 degrees while
        leaving the rest of the cube untouched. (this also makes me wonder about
        rubik's cubes packaging claiming "only one correct solution") Just
        thought I'd throw that in to the discussion, but absolutely mind
        numbing, isn't it? I'm an astronomer so i frequently deal with big
        numbers, but the entire visible univers is "only" 28 or so BILLION Light

        The real size of cube space is approx 4.3x10^19 / 48. It's actually a
        bit bigger since some positions are more symmetrical:
        901,083,404,981,813,616 Symmetries of a cube include all the rotations
        _and_ reflections, of which there are 48. A picture cube has
        approximately 8.8*10^22 states, assuming all 4 orientions of each centre
        are visible. The number of states of the picture cube is exactly 2048
        times larger than for the regular 3x3x3 cube. In cube-lovers we talked
        about C-conjugates and M-conjugates. I'm not sure how widespread this
        notation is, but there are 24 C-conjugates and 48 M-conjugates for a
        given cube position. C-Conjugates only include cube rotations and
        M-conjugates had both cube rotations and cube reflections. It makes
        sense to use the largest symmetry group possible to reduce the number of
        states so one could try to search the entire tree of positions. Mark On

        The calculation doesn't take into account the centers. Here is the
        mathematics of it: http://rubiks.com/cubefacts.html At the very bottom,
        it shows you how the numbers are calculated. The permutation of all

        any fears quickly vanished when I saw the author of the post was Mark
        Longridge. Cube Lovers was a good list. 43 Quintillion does seem like a
        lot, but it's not always the space of a problem or puzzle that makes a
        puzzle good. Ask a kid to arrange a set of alphabet blocks correctly.
        There is one way to get it right and 26! - 1 way to get it wrong:
        403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 - 1 It's a problem with a space
        that's about 10 million times bigger than the standard 4.3 quintillion
        of the rubik's cube's space! Imagine the unfortunate librarian who has

        Yes, this kinda stuff happened all the time, I find myself waiting
        around 10 minutes in the lobby, then turning in a puzzle to the front
        desk. At one point I lost my cube bag. So I ended up having to turn in a
        very great Studio cube to the lost and found..., it was very tight and
        very smooth caracteristic of those preferred by the fastest among us. I
        hope Chris is talking about the same Clock as I'm thinking about, as I
        recall we had the documentary people hold on to one for a while, since
        we were in a rush. On Monday I heard Ron or someone else of the Dutch
        group was looking for their Clock..., but I didn't pay too close
        attention. BTW, I must be color blind or something, but can we get a
        consensus on wheather it is red or orange on the wc pins becasuse a)
        orange and pink almost co-inside on many cubes and b) one is right one

        I dont consider myself an expert or a beginner of the cube. i've been
        cubing steadily from may now, and my avg have finally crept below 40
        sec. i would consider myself an intermediate cuber, and i think there
        are a lot more intermediate cubers, than expert cubers, and maybe even
        beginner cubers. I dont think that intermediate cubers would be confused
        by this notation. With a family and 2 small kids and a lot of other
        hobbies, and an old house that i'm beginning to restore, i have not the
        same amount of time and / or dedication to the cube as some of the
        others here, but i still wants to be a faster cuber, and learn more
        about the cube. I know that for someone like me, the extended notation
        would make it easier to get a grasp of the different ways an algorithm
        can be performed, and how some of the faster cubers perform it without
        having to spend endless hours playing and rewinding an video. and some
        of the fastest cubers dont even have videos on how they perform their
        algos. On the other hand, someone might not want to give away too much
        about how they do their moves, and ofcourse i can understand that. on
        the other hand, i would love if someone can collect and classify the
        different finger tricks. i think lars said something like it being 20
        something thricks. i only know and use RU'R' and L'UL, so then i
        definitely have a lot to learn. I agree with grant that it's hard to
        understand how a string of 6 - 8 moves can be a "trigger". and finally i
        just wanted to use one more example of my (extented thanks Lars)
        notation. i do the RU'R' algo this way : {rh}R {li}U' {rh}R', but i
        think that maybe most of you would do it like : {rh}R {ri}U' {rh}R' ??
        to use the right index for the U' you would have to do a pushing move,
        instead of a pulling, and i cant do that fast right now, but i think
        most fast cubers can. ok, just rambling away here, so i thought i would
        do one more :) R'U'RU could be done like : {rh}R' {li}U' {rh}R {ri}U,
        and this is how i would do it, but just playing a bit i found: {rh}R'
        {rh}U' {rt}R {ri}U. this could also go quite fast i think with some
        practice, but i've never tried it before. i guess you experts know all
        the different ways of doing this, and maybe both my ways are really
        stupid, but there are a few other ppl in this group that are not yet
        experts and who might find this useful. Terje p.s. I dont mean to defend
        my notation rigorously, it was just an idea i had, and i can understand
        that a few of you find it not nessassary, and maybe even stupid. &gt; My
        2 cents on this notation idea- &gt; I personally love videos and get the
        ideas for many of my algs from &gt; watching them. It is just about the
        best way to show how an alg is &gt; preformed. I don't mind waiting for
        them to load. I agree many sites &gt; just put parenthesis around a
        bunch of letters which means nothing &gt; to me. I kinda like the idea
        about assigning names to different &gt; triggers the same way LarsP does
        to his algs. There are only so many &gt; of them and how to preform them
        could be explained or showed by &gt; videos like on DanK's site. Doug
        does make a good point about the &gt; advanced not needing it and the
        beginners getting confused by it so &gt; I think the common notation
        used now accompanied by a *SLOW* video &gt; is best &gt; --barefoot

        say it is far from easy to &gt; decipher these. For a moment, I'm going
        to pick on Peter, since I &gt; knew I could find an example of this on
        his page. This is &gt; orientation 06-02 from &gt;
        http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/AllesFastOrient.html : &gt;
        (R'U√Ø¬ø¬ΩRU)(R'U'RUR'UR) &gt; &gt; I can't help but think that this is
        actually executed something more &gt; like: &gt;
        (R'U√Ø¬ø¬Ω)(RU)(R'U'RU)(R'UR) &gt; or &gt; (R'U√Ø¬ø¬Ω)(RUR'U')(RU)(R'UR) &gt;
        &gt; Am I wrong, or can you somehow actually string together 6-7 moves
        &gt; without regripping the cube? The only situation that I've come &gt;
        across (that I can think of) where I didn't need to regrip the cube &gt;
        for a move that long was for orientations 31 and 32 (same page). &gt;
        Aside from rolling my fingers a little bit to change which hand is &gt;
        holding the center slice (between R and L), and loosening a little to
        &gt; allow a held face to turn, I can perform the following without any
        &gt; grip changes (parenthesis indicate the finger rolls/loosening) :
        &gt; (R'U'R)(L'B'LB)(R'UR) &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, we perform triggers
        slightly differently amongst &gt; &gt; ourselves, so it is really up to
        the executor on how to grip &gt; &gt; and stuff. With even more
        experience it is not impossible to look &gt; &gt; at a raw algoirthm and
        parse out the triggers yourself... &gt; &gt; True, but when learning, it
        can be extremely helpful to understand &gt; how the alg is performed by
        someone who is already experienced with &gt; it. &gt; &gt; &gt; The
        problem is basically this: the advanced people don't need this &gt; &gt;
        extra notation, and the beginners may get confused by it. Also I'd &gt;
        &gt; find it somewhat annoying to be 'told' which finger to use. &gt;
        &gt; I agree... Though perhaps you should think of it as being told
        which &gt; finger _they_ use, not which finger _to_ use. &gt; &gt; -

        First off, you don't have to call your idea stupid. It makes great
        sense, it's just that due to certain reasons that I mentioned, it
        probably will never become mainstream. It's a fairly freash idea also,
        this is the first time I've ever heard of it. Do define your notation
        properly before using it like in your last post; what does {rh} mean? I
        assume "right-hand" but didn't you use {w} last time?. There needs to be
        consistancy here. Well the way I perform the moves like double-sune that
        was given as an example is to just to each turn separatly but string
        them along fast, no true triggers there. As for the first one Grant
        mentioned (the so-called advanced 3-cycle) is basically strung together
        in one long trigger that is oddly enough more then 4 turns long, which
        is rare, but could be split like so (I think Gilles just mentioned it in
        the Perturs group): (R'UR'U')R'U'((R'U)(RUR2)). The trigger does
        actaulyl work out all the way through and can therefore be executed in
        something like 1.5s, which I am currently doing in (2.33s, do it 10
        times move the decimal) (still fuzzy about it's inverse and mirrored
        inverse)... R'U'RU rarly comes up for me, but I'd do something like:
        {rt+ri}R' {rt}U' {ri+rm}R {ri}U (where rm stands for right middle
        finger). I am getting 0.87s on it right now... that way. Both of your
        ways for it seem a bit awkward for my hands. My rule-of-thumb for
        triggers is to never abuse the left index finger, use it actively but it
        works best when used at the end of a trigger so that it is being
        finished by your left hand as your right one is starting the next thing
        (this is tailored to right-handed people). I think I use it more activly
        then most cubists (I can already think of a few exceptions (Katsu is
        amazing with his left- index finger)). And it is usually the case that
        my right hand is busy doing other stuff (mostly on R and D) and I use my
        left index to trigger U'. It is necessary to have a good grip on the
        cube during these triggers, so that is a reason why not to abuse the
        left index finger. But of course you should try to come up with your onw
        little triggers if for nothing else they make your style more unique and
        perhaps more interesting to watch. For instance, I enjoy how Chris does
        his little karate-chop manuever that he does at the end sometimes (this
        is technically {rp}R or {rp}R2, where rp stands for right-pinky
        finger!). I do a few little things like UXU I can sometimes trigger as
        {ri}{xx}{rm}. For example UM'U I do this way. Also I have one move where
        I go like {rm}F' {li}R' (and no there is no mistake here, it is one of
        my signature finishes where the cube does a little flurish, way out with
        just the left hand and the last 2-3 turns are actaully kinda finished
        spining / forced by the last {li}R' turn). But this all gets more into
        the subject of style then triggers. Triggers arise out of your own
        style, my style is heavy with the M and D moves for example. -Doug ---

        my avg have finally crept below 40 sec. &gt; i would consider myself an
        intermediate cuber, and i think there are a lot &gt; more intermediate
        cubers, than expert cubers, and maybe even beginner &gt; cubers. &gt; I
        dont think that intermediate cubers would be confused by this notation.
        &gt; &gt; With a family and 2 small kids and a lot of other hobbies, and
        an old house &gt; that i'm beginning to restore, i have not the same
        amount of time and / or &gt; dedication to the cube as some of the
        others here, but i still wants to be a &gt; faster cuber, and learn more
        about the cube. I know that for someone like &gt; me, the extended
        notation would make it easier to get a grasp of the &gt; different ways
        an algorithm can be performed, and how some of the faster &gt; cubers
        perform it without having to spend endless hours playing and &gt;
        rewinding an video. and some of the fastest cubers dont even have videos
        on &gt; how they perform their algos. On the other hand, someone might
        not want to &gt; give away too much about how they do their moves, and
        ofcourse i can &gt; understand that. &gt; &gt; on the other hand, i
        would love if someone can collect and classify the &gt; different finger
        tricks. i think lars said something like it being 20 &gt; something
        thricks. i only know and use RU'R' and L'UL, so then i definitely &gt;
        have a lot to learn. &gt; &gt; I agree with grant that it's hard to
        understand how a string of 6 - 8 moves &gt; can be a "trigger". &gt;
        &gt; and finally i just wanted to use one more example of my (extented
        thanks &gt; Lars) notation. &gt; i do the RU'R' algo this way : {rh}R
        {li}U' {rh}R', but i think that maybe &gt; most of you would do it like
        : {rh}R {ri}U' {rh}R' ?? &gt; to use the right index for the U' you
        would have to do a pushing move, &gt; instead of a pulling, and i cant
        do that fast right now, but i think most &gt; fast cubers can. &gt; &gt;
        ok, just rambling away here, so i thought i would do one more :) &gt;
        &gt; R'U'RU could be done like : {rh}R' {li}U' {rh}R {ri}U, and this is
        how i &gt; would do it, but just playing a bit i found: &gt; {rh}R'
        {rh}U' {rt}R {ri}U. this could also go quite fast i think with some &gt;
        practice, but i've never tried it before. &gt; &gt; i guess you experts
        know all the different ways of doing this, and maybe &gt; both my ways
        are really stupid, but there are a few other ppl in this group &gt; that
        are not yet experts and who might find this useful. &gt; &gt; &gt; Terje
        &gt; &gt; p.s. I dont mean to defend my notation rigorously, it was just
        an idea i &gt; had, and i can understand that a few of you find it not
        nessassary, and &gt; maybe even stupid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My 2 cents
        on this notation idea- &gt; &gt; I personally love videos and get the
        ideas for many of my algs from &gt; &gt; watching them. It is just about
        the best way to show how an alg is &gt; &gt; preformed. I don't mind
        waiting for them to load. I agree many sites &gt; &gt; just put
        parenthesis around a bunch of letters which means nothing &gt; &gt; to
        me. I kinda like the idea about assigning names to different &gt; &gt;
        triggers the same way LarsP does to his algs. There are only so many
        &gt; &gt; of them and how to preform them could be explained or showed
        by &gt; &gt; videos like on DanK's site. Doug does make a good point
        about the &gt; &gt; advanced not needing it and the beginners getting
        confused by it so &gt; &gt; I think the common notation used now
        accompanied by a *SLOW* video &gt; &gt; is best &gt; &gt; --barefoot

        together 6-7 moves &gt; &gt; without regripping the cube? The only
        situation that I've come &gt; &gt; across (that I can think of) where I
        didn't need to regrip the &gt; cube &gt; &gt; for a move that long was
        for orientations 31 and 32 (same page). &gt; &gt; Aside from rolling my
        fingers a little bit to change which hand is &gt; &gt; holding the
        center slice (between R and L), and loosening a little &gt; to &gt; &gt;
        allow a held face to turn, I can perform the following without any &gt;
        &gt; grip changes (parenthesis indicate the finger rolls/loosening) :
        &gt; &gt; (R'U'R)(L'B'LB)(R'UR) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, we
        perform triggers slightly differently amongst &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves,
        so it is really up to the executor on how to grip &gt; &gt; &gt; and

        I'd &gt; &gt; &gt; find it somewhat annoying to be 'told' which finger

        Hi Grant, I haven't posted any of my finger tricks before, So here foes
        my first. I don't have a name for these kind yet. Left thumb on Top
        center, left middle finger on Bottom center; R2 B2 R F2 R' B2 R F2 R.
        This is one of many algorithyms where there's no need to move the cube
        to the other hand or change the grip. Of course, the left hand may
        rotate to assist the right in gaining speed. Questions and comments are

        Hi all. Been following the discussions on this forum for a while, but
        this is my first post. Been "hooked" on the cube since february. Doing
        an old-fashioned layer by layer which is pretty slow. Doing 52 on
        average with a 42 non-lucky fastest. Probably going to go for corners
        first some day, mostly because i feel it could be fun to not do Fridrich
        like most speedcubists seem to do. DanG's upcoming website is also a
        reson for this. Seems to somekind of a Jess Bonde- Cornersfirst site ;)
        . Spent most of yesterday reading about blindfolded cubing and learning
        some algorithms and by the end of the day I made my first blindfolded
        solve on the 2x2x2. Gonna practice som more on the mini- cube before I
        go on to the 3x3x3. I'm also having thoughts of 15 sek pre-inspection
        blindfolded speedsolve of the 2x2x2. 15 secs should be enough for the
        2x2x2 with som practice. I'll be back with more blindfolded cubing, and
        some speedsolving when I have time to look further into corners first.

        Hey Doug &gt; Do define your notation properly before using it like in
        your last &gt; post; what does {rh} mean? I assume "right-hand" but
        didn't you use &gt; {w} last time?. There needs to be consistancy here.
        Lars (petrus) used the {rh} notation is his early reply, so i adopted
        it. i= t's a better way. &gt; R'U'RU rarly comes up for me, but I'd do
        something like: {rt+ri}R' &gt; {rt}U' {ri+rm}R {ri}U (where rm stands
        for right middle finger). I &gt; am getting 0.87s on it right now...
        that way. Both of your ways for &gt; it seem a bit awkward for my hands.
        &gt; umm .. i managed to get my algo wrong. i was trying to say RU'R'U
        .. i dont= know if it's a much used combionation of moves, it was just
        an example. I like the way you= use your middle finger a lot. i use only
        my index finger + whole hand, exept for a f= ew moves with my thumb. i
        guess i need to practice with more fingers. &gt; My rule-of-thumb for
        triggers is to never abuse the left index &gt; finger, use it actively
        but it works best when used at the end of a &gt; trigger so that it is
        being finished by your left hand as your right &gt; one is starting the
        next thing (this is tailored to right-handed &gt; people). I think I use
        it more activly then most cubists (I can &gt; already think of a few
        exceptions (Katsu is amazing with his left- &gt; index finger)). And it
        is usually the case that my right hand is &gt; busy doing other stuff
        (mostly on R and D) and I use my left index &gt; to trigger U'. It is
        necessary to have a good grip on the cube &gt; during these triggers, so
        that is a reason why not to abuse the left &gt; index finger. &gt; I do
        use my left index finger a lot on right hand moves, but i guess it's a=
        ll about style and practice. i alternate and use my left hand just as
        much as my right in a no= rmal solve. &gt; But of course you should try
        to come up with your onw little &gt; triggers if for nothing else they
        make your style more unique and &gt; perhaps more interesting to watch.
        For instance, I enjoy how Chris &gt; does his little karate-chop
        manuever that he does at the end &gt; sometimes (this is technically
        {rp}R or {rp}R2, where rp stands for &gt; right-pinky finger!). I do a
        few little things like UXU I can &gt; sometimes trigger as {ri}{xx}{rm}.
        For example UM'U I do this way. &gt; Also I have one move where I go
        like {rm}F' {li}R' (and no there is &gt; no mistake here, it is one of
        my signature finishes where the cube &gt; does a little flurish, way out
        with just the left hand and the last &gt; 2-3 turns are actaully kinda
        finished spining / forced by the last &gt; {li}R' turn). &gt; I would
        love to see a video (slow motion) of chris's karate-chop pinky styl= e
        :) The {rm}F' {li}R' would also be fun to watch. cool finish :) &gt; But
        this all gets more into the subject of style then triggers. &gt;
        Triggers arise out of your own style, my style is heavy with the M &gt;
        and D moves for example. &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        amount of time &gt; and / or &gt; &gt; dedication to the cube as some of
        the others here, but i still &gt; wants to be a &gt; &gt; faster cuber,
        and learn more about the cube. I know that for &gt; someone like &gt;
        &gt; me, the extended notation would make it easier to get a grasp of
        &gt; the &gt; &gt; different ways an algorithm can be performed, and how
        some of the &gt; faster &gt; &gt; cubers perform it without having to
        spend endless hours playing and &gt; &gt; rewinding an video. and some
        of the fastest cubers dont even have &gt; videos on &gt; &gt; how they
        perform their algos. On the other hand, someone might not &gt; want to
        &gt; &gt; give away too much about how they do their moves, and ofcourse
        i &gt; can &gt; &gt; understand that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the other
        hand, i would love if someone can collect and &gt; classify the &gt;
        &gt; different finger tricks. i think lars said something like it being
        &gt; 20 &gt; &gt; something thricks. i only know and use RU'R' and L'UL,
        so then i &gt; definitely &gt; &gt; have a lot to learn. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I agree with grant that it's hard to understand how a string of 6 -
        &gt; 8 moves &gt; &gt; can be a "trigger". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and
        finally i just wanted to use one more example of my (extented &gt;
        thanks &gt; &gt; Lars) notation. &gt; &gt; i do the RU'R' algo this way
        : {rh}R {li}U' {rh}R', but i think &gt; that maybe &gt; &gt; most of you
        would do it like : {rh}R {ri}U' {rh}R' ?? &gt; &gt; to use the right
        index for the U' you would have to do a pushing &gt; move, &gt; &gt;
        instead of a pulling, and i cant do that fast right now, but i &gt;
        think most &gt; &gt; fast cubers can. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ok, just
        rambling away here, so i thought i would do one more :) &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; R'U'RU could be done like : {rh}R' {li}U' {rh}R {ri}U, and this is
        &gt; how i &gt; &gt; would do it, but just playing a bit i found: &gt;
        &gt; {rh}R' {rh}U' {rt}R {ri}U. this could also go quite fast i think
        &gt; with some &gt; &gt; practice, but i've never tried it before. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; i guess you experts know all the different ways of doing
        this, and &gt; maybe &gt; &gt; both my ways are really stupid, but there
        are a few other ppl in &gt; this group &gt; &gt; that are not yet
        experts and who might find this useful. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Terje &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p.s. I dont mean to defend my notation
        rigorously, it was just an &gt; idea i &gt; &gt; had, and i can
        understand that a few of you find it not &gt; nessassary, and &gt; &gt;
        maybe even stupid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My 2 cents on this
        notation idea- &gt; &gt; &gt; I personally love videos and get the ideas
        for many of my algs &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; watching them. It is just
        about the best way to show how an alg &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; preformed.
        I don't mind waiting for them to load. I agree many &gt; sites &gt; &gt;
        &gt; just put parenthesis around a bunch of letters which means &gt;
        nothing &gt; &gt; &gt; to me. I kinda like the idea about assigning
        names to different &gt; &gt; &gt; triggers the same way LarsP does to
        his algs. There are only so &gt; many &gt; &gt; &gt; of them and how to
        preform them could be explained or showed by &gt; &gt; &gt; videos like
        on DanK's site. Doug does make a good point about the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        advanced not needing it and the beginners getting confused by it &gt; so
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I think the common notation used now accompanied by a
        *SLOW* &gt; video &gt; &gt; &gt; is best &gt; &gt; &gt; --barefoot CHRIS

        With a bit of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiecnce it is VERY easy to
        recognize what one should do for &gt; &gt; any &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given
        trigger. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and no. Sometimes, when
        people write out an alg, they group &gt; &gt; &gt; together so many
        moves, I don't see how it's possible that it &gt; &gt; could &gt; &gt;
        &gt; be a single "finger trick". I would say it is far from easy to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; decipher these. For a moment, I'm going to pick on Peter,
        since &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; knew I could find an example of this on his
        page. This is &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation 06-02 from &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/AllesFastOrient.html : &gt; &gt; &gt;
        (R'U¬≤RU)(R'U'RUR'UR) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can't help but
        think that this is actually executed something &gt; &gt; more &gt; &gt;
        &gt; like: &gt; &gt; &gt; (R'U¬≤)(RU)(R'U'RU)(R'UR) &gt; &gt; &gt; or
        &gt; &gt; &gt; (R'U¬≤)(RUR'U')(RU)(R'UR) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am
        I wrong, or can you somehow actually string together 6-7 moves &gt; &gt;
        &gt; without regripping the cube? The only situation that I've come &gt;
        &gt; &gt; across (that I can think of) where I didn't need to regrip the
        &gt; &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; for a move that long was for orientations
        31 and 32 (same page). &gt; &gt; &gt; Aside from rolling my fingers a
        little bit to change which hand &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; holding the
        center slice (between R and L), and loosening a &gt; little &gt; &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; &gt; allow a held face to turn, I can perform the following
        without &gt; any &gt; &gt; &gt; grip changes (parenthesis indicate the
        finger rolls/loosening) : &gt; &gt; &gt; (R'U'R)(L'B'LB)(R'UR) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, we perform triggers slightly
        differently amongst &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves, so it is really up to
        the executor on how to grip &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and stuff. With even
        more experience it is not impossible to &gt; &gt; look &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; at a raw algoirthm and parse out the triggers yourself... &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True, but when learning, it can be extremely helpful
        to &gt; understand &gt; &gt; &gt; how the alg is performed by someone
        who is already experienced &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; it. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is basically this: the advanced
        people don't need &gt; &gt; this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra notation, and
        the beginners may get confused by it. Also &gt; &gt; I'd &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; find it somewhat annoying to be 'told' which finger to use. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree... Though perhaps you should think of
        it as being told &gt; &gt; which &gt; &gt; &gt; finger _they_ use, not
        which finger _to_ use. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Grant &gt; &gt;

        RU'R'U is performed {rt}R {rt}U' {rm}R' {rm}U. I'm sure most of the
        fastest right-handers would agree with me on this one, but perhaps use
        {ri} as opposed to {rm}, but that may depend on how low/high you hold
        the cube. It is the fastest of all length 4 triggers I believe. I'm
        getting about 0.567s on it btw (feeling a bit competitive as usual, just
        wondering who can beat that). It's part of the DanK (and Mirek) Z-Perm
        manuever that I do all the time when I'm not solving. It is great how
        awesome that alg is. I remember seeing it for the first time almost 4
        years ago and how amazed I was. In his video he executes it in about
        2.7s (though maybe not going full speed and he has surely improved a lot
        since then), but I can now execute it in 2.13s! (I'm sure there are
        people faster then this out there...) -Doug --- In

        notation properly before using it like in your last &gt; &gt; post; what
        does {rh} mean? I assume "right-hand" but didn't you use &gt; &gt; {w}
        last time?. There needs to be consistancy here. &gt; &gt; Lars (petrus)
        used the {rh} notation is his early reply, so i adopted it. i= &gt; t's
        a better way. &gt; &gt; &gt; R'U'RU rarly comes up for me, but I'd do
        something like: {rt+ri} R' &gt; &gt; {rt}U' {ri+rm}R {ri}U (where rm
        stands for right middle finger). I &gt; &gt; am getting 0.87s on it
        right now... that way. Both of your ways for &gt; &gt; it seem a bit
        awkward for my hands. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; umm .. i managed to get my
        algo wrong. i was trying to say RU'R'U .. i dont= &gt; know if it's a
        &gt; much used combionation of moves, it was just an example. I like the
        way you= &gt; use your &gt; middle finger a lot. i use only my index
        finger + whole hand, exept for a f= &gt; ew moves with my &gt; thumb. i
        guess i need to practice with more fingers. &gt; &gt; &gt; My
        rule-of-thumb for triggers is to never abuse the left index &gt; &gt;
        finger, use it actively but it works best when used at the end of a &gt;
        &gt; trigger so that it is being finished by your left hand as your
        right &gt; &gt; one is starting the next thing (this is tailored to
        right-handed &gt; &gt; people). I think I use it more activly then most
        cubists (I can &gt; &gt; already think of a few exceptions (Katsu is
        amazing with his left- &gt; &gt; index finger)). And it is usually the
        case that my right hand is &gt; &gt; busy doing other stuff (mostly on R
        and D) and I use my left index &gt; &gt; to trigger U'. It is necessary
        to have a good grip on the cube &gt; &gt; during these triggers, so that
        is a reason why not to abuse the left &gt; &gt; index finger. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I do use my left index finger a lot on right hand moves, but i
        guess it's a= &gt; ll about style and &gt; practice. i alternate and use
        my left hand just as much as my right in a no= &gt; rmal solve. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; But of course you should try to come up with your onw little
        &gt; &gt; triggers if for nothing else they make your style more unique
        and &gt; &gt; perhaps more interesting to watch. For instance, I enjoy
        how Chris &gt; &gt; does his little karate-chop manuever that he does at
        the end &gt; &gt; sometimes (this is technically {rp}R or {rp}R2, where
        rp stands for &gt; &gt; right-pinky finger!). I do a few little things
        like UXU I can &gt; &gt; sometimes trigger as {ri}{xx}{rm}. For example
        UM'U I do this way. &gt; &gt; Also I have one move where I go like
        {rm}F' {li}R' (and no there is &gt; &gt; no mistake here, it is one of
        my signature finishes where the cube &gt; &gt; does a little flurish,
        way out with just the left hand and the last &gt; &gt; 2-3 turns are
        actaully kinda finished spining / forced by the last &gt; &gt; {li}R'
        turn). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would love to see a video (slow motion) of
        chris's karate-chop pinky styl= &gt; e :) &gt; The {rm}F' {li}R' would
        also be fun to watch. cool finish :) &gt; &gt; &gt; But this all gets
        more into the subject of style then triggers. &gt; &gt; Triggers arise
        out of your own style, my style is heavy with the M &gt; &gt; and D
        moves for example. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        below 40 sec. &gt; &gt; &gt; i would consider myself an intermediate

        intermediate cubers, than expert cubers, and maybe even &gt; &gt;
        beginner &gt; &gt; &gt; cubers. &gt; &gt; &gt; I dont think that
        intermediate cubers would be confused by this &gt; &gt; notation. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With a family and 2 small kids and a lot of

        beginning to restore, i have not the same amount of time &gt; &gt; and /
        or &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication to the cube as some of the others here, but
        i still &gt; &gt; wants to be a &gt; &gt; &gt; faster cuber, and learn
        more about the cube. I know that for &gt; &gt; someone like &gt; &gt;
        &gt; me, the extended notation would make it easier to get a grasp of
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; different ways an algorithm can be
        performed, and how some of the &gt; &gt; faster &gt; &gt; &gt; cubers
        perform it without having to spend endless hours playing and &gt; &gt;
        &gt; rewinding an video. and some of the fastest cubers dont even have
        &gt; &gt; videos on &gt; &gt; &gt; how they perform their algos. On the
        other hand, someone might not &gt; &gt; want to &gt; &gt; &gt; give away
        too much about how they do their moves, and ofcourse i &gt; &gt; can
        &gt; &gt; &gt; understand that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the
        other hand, i would love if someone can collect and &gt; &gt; classify
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; different finger tricks. i think lars said something
        like it being &gt; &gt; 20 &gt; &gt; &gt; something thricks. i only know
        and use RU'R' and L'UL, so then i &gt; &gt; definitely &gt; &gt; &gt;
        have a lot to learn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with grant
        that it's hard to understand how a string of 6 - &gt; &gt; 8 moves &gt;
        &gt; &gt; can be a "trigger". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and finally
        i just wanted to use one more example of my (extented &gt; &gt; thanks
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Lars) notation. &gt; &gt; &gt; i do the RU'R' algo this
        way : {rh}R {li}U' {rh}R', but i think &gt; &gt; that maybe &gt; &gt;
        &gt; most of you would do it like : {rh}R {ri}U' {rh}R' ?? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; to use the right index for the U' you would have to do a pushing
        &gt; &gt; move, &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of a pulling, and i cant do that
        fast right now, but i &gt; &gt; think most &gt; &gt; &gt; fast cubers
        can. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ok, just rambling away here, so i
        thought i would do one more :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R'U'RU
        could be done like : {rh}R' {li}U' {rh}R {ri}U, and this is &gt; &gt;
        how i &gt; &gt; &gt; would do it, but just playing a bit i found: &gt;
        &gt; &gt; {rh}R' {rh}U' {rt}R {ri}U. this could also go quite fast i
        think &gt; &gt; with some &gt; &gt; &gt; practice, but i've never tried
        it before. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i guess you experts know all
        the different ways of doing this, and &gt; &gt; maybe &gt; &gt; &gt;
        both my ways are really stupid, but there are a few other ppl in &gt;
        &gt; this group &gt; &gt; &gt; that are not yet experts and who might
        find this useful. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Terje
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p.s. I dont mean to defend my notation
        rigorously, it was just an &gt; &gt; idea i &gt; &gt; &gt; had, and i
        can understand that a few of you find it not &gt; &gt; nessassary, and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe even stupid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; My 2 cents on this notation idea- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        personally love videos and get the ideas for many of my algs &gt; &gt;
        from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; watching them. It is just about the best way to
        show how an alg &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preformed. I don't mind
        waiting for them to load. I agree many &gt; &gt; sites &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; just put parenthesis around a bunch of letters which means &gt;
        &gt; nothing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me. I kinda like the idea about
        assigning names to different &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; triggers the same way
        LarsP does to his algs. There are only so &gt; &gt; many &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; of them and how to preform them could be explained or showed by
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; videos like on DanK's site. Doug does make a good
        point about the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advanced not needing it and the
        beginners getting confused by it &gt; &gt; so &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        think the common notation used now accompanied by a *SLOW* &gt; &gt;
        video &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is best &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --barefoot CHRIS

        R2' and R2. With a bit of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiecnce it is
        VERY easy to recognize what one should do for &gt; &gt; &gt; any &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given trigger. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Yes, and no. Sometimes, when people write out an alg, they group
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together so many moves, I don't see how it's
        possible that it &gt; &gt; &gt; could &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be a single
        "finger trick". I would say it is far from easy to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        decipher these. For a moment, I'm going to pick on Peter, since &gt;
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew I could find an example of this on his
        page. This is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation 06-02 from &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/AllesFastOrient.html : &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; (R'U¬≤RU)(R'U'RUR'UR) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        can't help but think that this is actually executed something &gt; &gt;
        &gt; more &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        (R'U¬≤)(RU)(R'U'RU)(R'UR) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        (R'U¬≤)(RUR'U')(RU)(R'UR) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am I
        wrong, or can you somehow actually string together 6-7 moves &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; without regripping the cube? The only situation that I've come
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across (that I can think of) where I didn't need to
        regrip the &gt; &gt; &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a move that long
        was for orientations 31 and 32 (same page). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aside
        from rolling my fingers a little bit to change which hand &gt; &gt; is
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; holding the center slice (between R and L), and
        loosening a &gt; &gt; little &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow
        a held face to turn, I can perform the following without &gt; &gt; any
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grip changes (parenthesis indicate the finger
        rolls/loosening) : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (R'U'R)(L'B'LB)(R'UR) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, we perform triggers slightly
        differently amongst &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves, so it is really
        up to the executor on how to grip &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and stuff.
        With even more experience it is not impossible to &gt; &gt; &gt; look
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at a raw algoirthm and parse out the triggers
        yourself... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True, but when
        learning, it can be extremely helpful to &gt; &gt; understand &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; how the alg is performed by someone who is already experienced
        &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is basically this: the advanced people
        don't need &gt; &gt; &gt; this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra notation,
        and the beginners may get confused by it. Also &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find it somewhat annoying to be 'told' which finger
        to use. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree... Though
        perhaps you should think of it as being told &gt; &gt; &gt; which &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; finger _they_ use, not which finger _to_ use. &gt; &gt;

        Hey all, There has been much discussion on the subject of public cubing,
        but what of public blindfolded cubing? I have recently started to attemp
        blindfolded cubing, and though the looks while cubing regularly are
        pretty funny, they don't come close to the ones you get while cubing
        behind your back! If I'm sitting at a table, I'll cube under the table,
        but if I'm sitting on a bench in the hallway or something, waiting for
        class to start, I'll cube behind my back. And just today, I went to get
        a haircut and cubed under the little sheet thingy they put over you. Got
        really really close, I had all edges correctly oriented and permuted,
        but I accidentaly permuted the UFL, DBR, and DBL corners the wrong
        direction. They were oriented though. Three measly pieces out of place!
        At any rate, out of maybe 10 or so attempts, I've done 1 right and had 3
        really near misses. It just takes so much more effort than regular
        cubing! Anyway, thought I'd share, and ask if anyone has any tips for
        public blindfolded cubing. -Daniel

        Public blindfolded demands a higher level of concentration (at least
        "screening out" your nearby noises and visuals). Tried it today while
        quite drunk... nearly impossible... hard to remember what you just did
        and also hard to remember some algorithms ;) . Quite a challenge...

        B2 R F2 R' B2 R F2 R. &gt; &gt; This is one of many algorithyms where
        there's no need to move the &gt; &gt; cube to the other hand or change
        the grip. Of course, the left hand &gt; &gt; may rotate to assist the
        right in gaining speed. &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt; David, &gt; &gt;
        When you talk about changing grip, you're just talking about the &gt;
        holding hand (left in this case), correct? The point I was trying to
        &gt; make was regarding grip changes in general. If you are saying you
        &gt; can do the above sequence without changing the right hand's grip on
        &gt; the cube, I would love an explanation, because though I can't see
        it, &gt; I'm liking that alg better than the one I use for that
        situation &gt; already, anyways! &gt; &gt; - Grant Hi Grant, Yes, I'm
        talking about the hand that's holding the cube. I'm glad you like the
        alg! The closest I have to an alg that changes neither hand position,
        sort of, is swaping the six centers around. (lower case letters mean
        middle slices next to the Upper case side.) The alg is r u r' u' Left
        thumb on UFL corner; left middle finger on UBL corner; right thumb on
        DFR corner; right middle finger on DBR corner. Allow the fingers to
        overlap the edge cubies, or not, as they move the center slices, but
        they never leave the corners. The left hand takes the Left side with it
        (L) when it goes and gets its center slice, it brings them both back (L'
        l'). At this point the only change is r. The right hand moves both the
        Down side and the center slice (D' d') And returns the Down side leaving
        the slice behind (D) this change results in u. The left hand takes the
        Left side along when it goes and gets the center slice (L') and brings
        them both back (L l) this results in r'. And last, the right hand turns
        both the Down side and its slice (D d), and returns the Down side back,
        (D') which results in u'. With a little practice this can become very
        fast. David J

        I did a couple of publc blindfold cubing on the 3x3x3 and I always get
        more reactions than when I do it normaly. It takes more time but it's
        worth it. I also done a 4x4x4 public blindfold infront of about 5 people
        and it took me more time because they always asked me questions while I
        memorized and it took me a while to remember the cube. My advice for
        blindfold beginners is to try and make it as simple as possible at the
        beginning, meaning to do it in the most simplest way you can, using a
        minimal number of algorithems so you wont need to remember a lot of
        things and you will be able to focus on the solving. Hopes this helps.

        I vote for the next venue in 2005 to be in Europe for the following

        I believe that the best reason to have 2005 in Europe is that the Cube
        is from Europe. Who's home better to compete in than the cube itself?!
        Budapest Hungary would be the logical location. Not only would the city
        be great for the simple fact that it holds such significance with Erno
        Rubik, the inventor, but also that Budapest is a beautiful city with
        great cultural and historical treasures. Two years ago, on my 6-week mad
        dash across Europe, I stayed in 12 cities but was sadly unable to visit
        Budapest. This, I found out, was very unfortunate since it is such a fun
        city, I hear. Nonetheless, any other city in Europe would be wonderful.
        This would allow all of the Americans to finally travel (for those who
        have never done so) to this wonderful area of the planet. I believe also
        that alot of people in America have always wished to go to Europe and
        this could be that oppurtunity which drives them forward in their dream
        of travelling abroad. London also would be great for the WC. Once again,
        another city which I did not visit but wish I had. London is one of the
        top world renowned cities with tons of international appeal. The
        publicity in this setting could be astonishing, especially with plenty
        of notice to the media in advance (1 year should do). Also, the Cube
        made it's world debut in London at the Toy Expo that was held there in
        1980. London also has great mass transit making for ease of travel to
        sightseeing destinations. Basically, there should not be too much of a
        argument against Europe as a location. Where in Europe definitely will
        be debated tirelessly, no doubt. that's what I think. -Jason

        I dont really care where the next WC is held. All I care is that it will
        be held somewhere. I agree with Jason that if it were in Europe it would
        give alot of us from the states a reason to travel to Europe. I think it
        would be cool to have it in Europe, it would make an awesome trip.
        Although the cost to Europe will be considerible more than was my trip
        to Toronto. That would be my only reason for wanting it over 'here'
        again. This works both ways though, I know it was quite costly for alot
        of you guys to make it to Toronto.....maybe the key is to find a sponsor

        Budapest is an awesome city, though I'm sure it's changed a lot since
        1988 when I was last there. And I suspect the Hungarians are still more
        cube obsessed than the average nation. London is the most practical
        location. It's English speaking, close to North America, and has good
        cheap flight connections to the entire planet. OK most major cities do,
        but I *think* London is best in Europe in this regard. It's not going to

        It's good to learn that at least one other person besides me has taken
        up seeing eye blindfold cubing. It was fun to surprise everyone with it
        in Toronto. It definitely is easier than the competition form of
        blindfold cubing. It is also a bit more spectator friendly, because the
        audience doesn't have to wait while you memorize the cube. There are
        other more difficult forms of seeing eye blindfold that you can learn if
        you would like to make it more challenging. Please contact me if you are
        interested. By the way, a good place to cube (blindfolded or otherwise)
        is to volunteer at the nearest science museum. That's what I have been
        doing weekly since this last January. Jim Mittan jmittan@... --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have recently started to attemp blindfolded
        cubing, and &gt; though &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks
        while cubing regularly are pretty funny, they don't come &gt; &gt; &gt;
        close &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the ones you get while cubing behind your
        back! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I'm sitting at a table, I'll cube under the
        table, but &gt; if &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on a
        bench in the hallway or something, waiting for &gt; &gt; class &gt; &gt;
        &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start, I'll cube behind my back. And just
        today, I went to &gt; get &gt; &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; haircut and
        cubed under the little sheet thingy they put over &gt; &gt; &gt; you.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Got really really close, I had all edges correctly
        oriented &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permuted, but I accidentaly
        permuted the UFL, DBR, and DBL &gt; &gt; corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        wrong direction. They were oriented though. Three measly &gt; &gt; &gt;
        pieces &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of place! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At any
        rate, out of maybe 10 or so attempts, I've done 1 &gt; right &gt; &gt;
        &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had 3 really near misses. It just takes so
        much more effort &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular cubing! &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, thought I'd share, and ask if anyone has any tips
        &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public blindfolded cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hello Michael and Jim, It's nice to see that there is interest in
        seeing-eye blindfold cubing. I suggested this as an event for Toronto
        WC2003, but no one said they wanted it. It is probably the best thig you
        can do before trying straight blindfold cubing, because you learn to
        picture what's going on a little bit at a time. Also you can practice
        this over the phone with friends. Regards, David J --- In

        related to seeing-eye blindfold: I might have missed the comment on

        the average everyday person is answering the questions and doing all the

        Yes, Mr. Mittan explained this to me. It is just a variation called
        "Remote-Control Cubing." Not nearly as fun as the normal seeing-eye
        version I think, but could be a nifty to do to somebody completely new
        to the cube (they'll just go around telling everybody 'they' did it
        blindfolded :)). I think that the seeing-eye one is not great for formal
        competitions, but may be a great thing to do within say two cube
        buddies... to mix it up. I can see that being very competitive in a
        friendly way. Anyways, I'm actually working on a BLD solve right now.
        I'm pretty new at this but I think I have a good arsenel of algs for it.
        I am down to 2 looks, one for twisting and flipping all pieces and the
        second to permute them.... Finding edge permutation is bit taxing

        it could be in Australia. Jasmine, I &gt; understand, lives there. &gt;

        Hi everyone, I just posted my new website a little while ago. It's brand
        new, and that means it's not even done yet, but I'm kind of impatient to
        get it up, so I have some stuff, but much more will come within the next
        few weeks. The URL is: http://users.rcn.com/rhodee/ Like I said, it's
        not even done so you can expect more tips and my cube log. I have
        recorded my times and averages over the past year and one or two months
        which I'll post so you can see the progress I've made since last year.
        Have fun, Andy C

        Richard, when I first read this I thought you meant that there weren't
        any cities in Australia that would be suitable for an international
        competition, but then I realised that you probably meant that Australia
        is so far from the rest of the world that makes it not so suitable? The
        two largest cities in Australia are Sydney and Melbourne. They are both
        great cities and certainly suitable for such things (Sydney, of course,
        being the home of the last Olympic Games), but they are a long distance
        for anyone else to travel. I've travelled to Europe and the US and if
        it's as expensive for you guys to travel here as it is for me to travel
        there, then I don't think many people would come. To give you ballpark
        figures, travelling from Australia to US/Europe in the low season on
        discount economy seats is around AUD$2000 return or more. Travelling in
        mid- season on standard economy seats is around AUD$2500-$3000 return,
        and travelling high season on standard economy seats is around $3000-
        $3500 return. And that's just the airfare, after those many thousands of
        dollars, then there's all the other stuff (accommodation, food, etc.) On
        the other hand, the US dollar and the UKPound, are both doing pretty
        well against the Australian dollar which is bad news for me :( but good
        news for all of you if you travel here. But still, at this sort of cost,
        I'm guessing that there wouldn't be too many people willing to go to
        Australia? I'd be quite happy with RWC2003 being in Europe. It's a long
        way away for me (no further than Nth America though) but I'd certainly
        try to make it. :) Jasmine. --- In

        Hi everyone, I've added my cube log since last year and have a few tips
        up. It's not close to being done but it should be in about a week or
        two. Please email me any questions you might have about becoming faster.
        I might add a tip for your question. Any other comments or suggestions

        There's an article in today's Canberra Times about my RWC cubing
        adventures. I've put a digital photo of it on my site:
        http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/rwc2003pages/article.html One
        thing I should mention is that it says I did better than I actually did.
        It was a phone interview so I guess the journalist misheard me. The
        Rubik's Clock was the only event where I ranked highly, but the article
        says I ranked highly in two events. Just wanted to point out this here
        so you don't think I was claiming credit for something I didn't do!
        Speaking of news articles... LarsV, are you going to post an English
        translation of your article? :) Jasmine.

        Personally, I would love to have WC2005 held in Australia. I've always
        wanted to go there and the WC would be the perfect excuse. My second

        because it is cheap. I would like to know who would be in charge of

        Who would organize it in Australia? And where in Australia? It is a
        continent, you know, just like Europe or Asia. Budapest is a capital of
        Hungary, so we are getting nmore precise. I have never been in Budapest,
        and I would love to visit. Of course, the cube is their national pride.
        Perhaps tbey may even like ny designs. It would probably be good if I
        were a Hungarian, bt I am not. :-) Mr. Janos Kovacs liked my designs. He
        preferred the Landry Staircase over Vaserely. Lord know he gave me
        invaluable help, when the organizers changed the venue and we had to
        move from the Galaxy Room. I am very grateful to him. In all this flurry
        of picking up the venue, we neglect to consider the sponsors. Without
        their financial assistance there will be no WC205. Lars P. is right. It
        may be a business decision. So the next question is: who will sponsor
        us? Where is the money coming from? Hana a kostky --- In

        are from there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably Japan, or somehwere
        near Sweden, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because so many people &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; were &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from those places. But I heard it
        might be in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; London. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If in
        Europe, why not Australia? (Instead of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Japan). &gt;

        Hi All, Those of you who were at the Championships in Toronto may
        remember me as jasmine_ellen's fiance. I remember there was a guy who
        said he was from the New York Times Magazine at the Championships. Does
        anyone know whether anything about the Championships was ever published
        in the Magazine? I've been watching it a bit, but not seen anything
        (although I have only looked at the most recent edition in the online

        Hi, Peter, I was at the Championships, but we didn't talk. I was the
        sole and very worried exhibitor of cube art. Please be prepared fior a
        dissappiontment. The fact that somebody shows up and identifies himself
        as being from piblication X does not yet mean piblication X will publish
        anything. Those people probably went home, handed their pieces to their
        editors, then promptly forgot about our existence. That is the way it
        usually is, son. The fact that we are besotted with the cube does not
        mean the rest of the wqorld is. I suggest you glance at speedcubing.com.
        If anything gets published,he will post it and you will see it. Ron will
        post it because he is besotted with the cube, too. And if there is a
        mention of cube art and its sile and foolish exhibitor, do let me know.

        zero (Korea has an online speedcubing community with 2278 members). Hmm,
        maybe if these speedcubing events take off, then the best local

        I hope there will be regional competitions next year, as I think I heard
        rumored. At least an Asian, North American and European regional
        competition. And then the sponsors could choose to pay the travel costs
        for the top three of each or so. I mean, I have been to three
        competitions in my life, and two of them have been world championships.
        Isn't that pretty weird? How many sports work that way? Of course,
        whatever the 'official' people do, nothing stops us from organize some

        My friend came up with a new method, and I've been fooling with it a
        bit. But I think I've heard of someone using this way before. The way it
        works is you get the top layer all but one corner, then you turn the top
        layer using the corner to place all the middle layer edges. The you just
        get the last corner and edge. The LL is like normal, as in any way you
        want to do it. Has anyone heard of this method before? It seems like it
        could be very fast.

        That's what I thought. I'm considering switching, because for some
        reason, I can't build the 2x2x2 cube quickly enough in Lars' method. So
        I'm trying to find a faster way. It's kind of weird, because using Lars'
        method, the F2L takes me around 35-40 moves. But with this new way I can
        do it in about 30-35. So I think it'll be faster. The problem is I can't
        think about it fast enough, so that's what I'm working on. I'll also
        need to memorize the OLL algs, of course. --- In

        Are you doing a proper Lars F2L with early edge orientation? Cuz if you
        are then those numbers seem right, but you just can't compare to the
        Fridrich method that way. Since Lars would give you a significant
        advantage at the end. Now if your not doing the proper Lars then those
        numbers are bad, it shouldn't take more then 30 turns (HTM) to do the
        F2L that way period. The Fridrich F2L is supposively 35 moves on average
        btw. You speak of OLLs though. So are you transitioning from Lars to
        Fridrich? Or doing a combination of both sort of a "Petrich" as some
        people now call it? Or do you mean the CLLs that retain edge flip (step
        5+6)? -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Michael

        Yeah, I orient the edges before completing the F2L. It makes the LL very
        easy, but the entire solution still tkaes me above 60, sometimes 70
        moves. I'm hoping to eventually average between 50 and 60 moves. I'm
        going to change my LL method to Fridrich. But I'm going to use the
        method I was talking about before for the F2L. --- In

        Cuz if &gt; you are then those numbers seem right, but you just can't
        compare to &gt; the Fridrich method that way. Since Lars would give you
        a &gt; significant advantage at the end. Now if your not doing the
        proper &gt; Lars then those numbers are bad, it shouldn't take more then
        30 &gt; turns (HTM) to do the F2L that way period. The Fridrich F2L is
        &gt; supposively 35 moves on average btw. &gt; &gt; You speak of OLLs
        though. So are you transitioning from Lars to &gt; Fridrich? Or doing a
        combination of both sort of a "Petrich" as some &gt; people now call it?
        Or do you mean the CLLs that retain edge flip &gt; (step 5+6)? &gt; &gt;

        weird, because &gt; using &gt; &gt; Lars' method, the F2L takes me
        around 35-40 moves. But with this &gt; new &gt; &gt; way I can do it in
        about 30-35. So I think it'll be faster. The &gt; &gt; problem is I
        can't think about it fast enough, so that's what I'm &gt; &gt; working
        on. &gt; &gt; I'll also need to memorize the OLL algs, of course. &gt;

        Correction, I never got featured in any local article, local tv, school

        This is not to indicate jealous or anything, just a correction to your
        statement that "we all got featured." Actually "only cuber" is a fair
        assestment, it's almost like 0-2 in every state (only counting
        serious(~sub-90s) cubers we know about). If there's another cuber in my

        Pooh, our local papers don't know what a Rubik's cube is. There were
        several of us from the Chicago area, but no articcle about us in either
        Chicago Tribune or Chicago Sun Times. here was Grant Tregay, World

        (sidenote: The hidden meaning of my last post is that I am starting to
        doubt the accuracy of the media in general, as a whole. I don't count
        documentaries as media, still waiting to see them and make a fair
        assessment.) So before making my last post I had to check the net for
        articles featuring myself to be certain. I came across a lot of stuff
        about my idea for an algorithms database. It seems that interest in it
        is 'iffy at best', there are few that believe it is doable, and/or it
        doesn't appear to be worth it. So if anybody is truly interested, e-mail
        me. You are right if you think 'I' can't do it, from the start I have
        asked for help, and as a group, this should be on our list of priorities
        with "getting faster" and "wc2005". Well thrid, I obviously feel it is
        worth the time and effort. As for implementation, yes the front-end will
        be difficult (made a couple attempts, not happy with them), but the
        back-end is like 80% done (all the data populated, will be writing
        scripts to crawl through cubists web sites to assimlate algs for
        more...). I am taking a relatively light course load this semester and
        do plan on advancing this project further. So I really, really, really,
        want help on this big project of mine (contribute and you can call it
        'yours' also :)). I am of course willing to share credit for it and only
        publicized it in its early phase to maintain originality points for it.
        OK, so here is what I need: a programmer(s) proficient in VB scripts for
        ASPs who hopefully maintains(-ed) a database-based website, someone to
        tell me it is feasible to tinker around with a "15MB" database on a
        server, someone good with DB stuff (Oracle, SQL, etc.), and private
        server space (can run all sorts of scripts with good security and space,
        ideally off speedcubing.COM). Ideally they'd work for no compensation,
        but anything reasonable will be considered... Code-wise I need: an
        advanced records-paging mechanism (something as simple as the way search
        engines have it on the bottom might work), an advanced search-engine
        (hehe, given 3 months to write general one last semester for a CS class)
        tailored to my needs (alg&amp;case stats have all been pre-computed),
        script a dynamic merge of very small b/w images to form alg diagrams
        (lines and arrows, parts I already made), buttons to dynamically
        rotate/mirror/inverse stuff (algs, permutation strings, and the
        diagram), and probably a few more things I can't think of currently.
        Yes, I realize this is asking for a lot, but why do it if to allow
        someone to take the idea and make a much better one within a month or
        two... it has to set the bar and set it high. I am putting this here
        because I know many of you in this group are IT professionals and/or
        have worked with this kinda stuff. (We all know I can't persuade other
        CS majors here to do th work..., unless I can find a prof willing to
        take it in a a bit of a reasearch project for hired students.) I really
        don't see practical directions to go currently (kinda stuck), so it'd be
        nice if someone could point me in the right direction. BTW, for those
        that are interested and just can't help, it's still gona take at least a
        year more to finish, hopefully I can show some of you the beta version.
        I just know that with the right help, we can get this to work and then
        rarely would we ever have to resort to some optimal solver program for
        LL cases again :). And with this help, it'll just go through version
        after version, until we get it right, we are happy with it (my standards
        are kinda high), and it is near perfect. At least I won't have to worry
        about finding beta testers, after getting through these initial phases
        of the operation. Trust me, you'll like it, I know I get good use out of
        the stack one sitting on my computer. Just imagaine, a few key-strokes
        and instantly a list of like 30 algs (amount depending on the
        specificallity of the search among other things), sortable in any of 3
        metrics (might add in one more for completeness), complexity-value,
        trigger- friendlyness... and a ton of cool stuff some of which I have
        already implemented server-side/back-end that I am keeping secret to
        suprise you all!!! Let's just say, I'd be shocked if someone can offer
        an idea for a capability I havn't considered (difficult/impossible ones
        I might have considered and discarded). -Doug Li (very enthused, but may

        I've been trying to work my way through the method on stiff_hands
        webpage (http://homepage.ntlworld.com/family.
        hayden/cube/blindfold_frontpage.html) but I'm a bit lost. I also looked
        over Richard's Carr method but was again easily confused. So first off,
        before I go too nuts asking for help. Does anybody know any other
        methods that I can look at that will possibly make things clearer?
        Anyway, My problem begins after getting the cube into the L2R2F2B2UD
        group...I seem to have that down just fine. After that I have trouble
        and it's frusterating because he seems to have gone to great length to
        make things as clear as possible. So I get the cube into the L2R2F2B2UD
        group and then my next goal is to permute them correct? I have no
        trouble figuring out the numbers and all and I understand how to move
        them, but the problem is actually doing it. This is hard to
        explain...suppose I have something like (1357)(28)(46)... am i wrong in
        thinking the first thing I'd want to do is to move 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 and
        5 to 1 so i'm left with (17)(28)(46)? if that's the case, is the
        objective to come up with my own series of moves to get 5 into positon
        where I can swap it, keep those moves in mind and undo them after I swap
        these three pieces? Also, I don't understand the calculation of the
        corner twist...I guess I see where he gets the numbers and how, but i'm
        somehow missing its significance. What if it's nonzero? I might be way
        off on all this but i appreciate your patience and help...I'm really
        aiming immediately for a 2x2x2 solve (which is why there aren't a
        billion questions about the edges ...yet. I think this is just such a
        different way of thinking than ordinary solving that i'm just bogged
        down in the thoery of it...but i hope I can clear it up with help.

        Doug, I think an algorithm database would be a worthwhile tool to
        develop. That type of database make me think of the pgn viewers that are
        used for chess databases. Since cubing algorithms are virtually "moves"
        just like chess "moves" in the database. I do not see any reason why a
        database cannot be created for all the "moves" to solve a Rubik's cube.
        You may even think of the various methods as different "openings" like
        in chess too. Perhaps such a database would help cubers prepare for
        tournaments just like a grandmaster does for chess. I will look into
        these database options further, time permitting, as this is a very
        interesting idea. The interface may actually be made using Macromedia
        Flash, as I am proficient with this tool. Perhaps more later....

        sounded surprised when I said 30-40 puzzles, so I told her that was a

        It's a big project and I can't finish it by myself so I set it up
        recently. Currently my algorithm list has approx. 60,000 algorithms (a
        little shy of that). The first stage of the AICOP would be to increase
        that to about half a billion (in small stages). The first few
        sub-optimal algorithms (a few edge 5-cycles not in the above c. 60,000)
        are already there if anyone wants to optimize a few.

        Blindfold cubing really is easier than people first imagine. For a
        2x2x2, what you need to do is first of all orient your corners (you
        could do that second but it's less to think about doing it first) and
        then permute in an orientation preserving way. Each corner gets assigned
        an orientation 0, 1 or 2 depending on how many times you'd need to twist
        it (by 120 degrees) to get the U or D colour in the U or D face.
        (Sometimes 2 might be replaced by -1.) In fact, it is generally easier
        to think about this geometrically and work out pairs or triples to twist
        rather than remember the sequence. After orienting you should use
        3-cycles to try and place most of the corners. Use 3-cycles in the U or
        D face - e.g. RB'RF2R'BRF2R2 - to place things without changing the
        orientations.You may be left with two corners to switch. For a 2x2x2,
        you can just use a move like U to get to 3-cycles again. Of course,
        there's always the other option which would be to use my slightly more
        advanced blindfold system (not currently in general release, though some
        have seen advance copies of an intermediate version). This will permute
        your corners in one go (orientation preserving too), if they are evenly
        permuted. The cycle method is used by other people. I thought about
        developing something like that at one time but went for a work out as
        you go along approach. Dror is probably the most famous exponent of this
        other method. (Stiff hands' method.)

        Yes, that's true. But I did e-mail the Detroit News and one of the
        popular local tv stations before the event (cuz I knew if I failed
        horribly that I wouldn't get any attention from them), but I got no
        response at all... I think that interest in the Detroit area is just
        non-existant. I mean there wasn't even anything about the wc in general.
        A few times there were full-page spreads about upcomming tourist
        attractions in Toronto, stuff about the good exchange rate and recent
        low prices due to SARS. They list like 40 things going on in the city
        from early Aug to Oct and NOTHING. But I really don't care too much
        about "me" not getting in, just annoyed at media reaserching, or should
        I say, lack thereof, that the WC in general didn't get mentioned here
        (and I know, I checked frequently). Hemm... we all were being asked a
        lot of questions at WC that were not opionion-based, stuff they should
        have known if they did (or had people do) the proper reasearch - i.e.
        going to google and typing "Rubik's Cube". I know some of you were
        bothered by the media, I could just ignore it, but when they ask stupid
        questions like who was the last world-record holder? or who invented the
        Cube? etc. I pretty much would then have the urge to walk the other
        direction (facts are not good interview questions, and neither is having
        me predict the future). Oh, trust me, there are or at least will be 100
        articles if you count just before the wc also - maybe 20 of which on
        DanK (he deserves it of course). We need to take into account the
        articles in say Japan news papers or even something in Belgium, for
        which I still can't find a translator program for (thanks LarsV). All
        the little articles add up, heck 100 is probably an under-estimate and
        probably 0 from my state of Michigan though (there was a local tv thing
        about Jon up north though). -Doug ps. sorry about all the lengthy posts
        I make, I tend to let my thoughts wander a bit and need something to do
        to break up my usual routine of spending 3-5 hrs a day writting proofs +
        2-3 hrs of "you know what....". pps. I finally got to the geek quote in
        your article, I really like it, nice and subtle, and will have to use it
        sometime in front of my friends. IMHO you look better with glasses (to
        intensify the geekyness I suppose), I guess with them they could
        accidently capture the reflection of the camera though. --- In

        Michael: It'll take up to a year to finish editing. Richard is doing a

        Richard's to be finished first and IMHO, Allan's team is the more

        I can say that in the "olden days" the promotions preceding the original
        cube contests of 1981 to 1982 were mostly by Ideal Toy directly, at
        least in North America. My recollection is that People magazine had a
        full page ad for the American Rubik's Cube-a-thon contest. Also Games
        magazine had a large ad describing all the regional contests in the U.S.
        Not sure if Games magazine mentioned WC2003. I don't recall much in the
        way of promotions from newspapers before the contests occurred in
        Canada. There was some media after the fact, and Duc Trinh was mentioned
        in the Toronto Star. Asked the guy from New York Times magazine what his
        take was on cubing and he compared it to a Scrabble event he covered.
        This cycle was a lot different from 21 years ago when all the cubists
        herded into shopping malls. The cube was far more ubiquitous then but
        believe it or not I think the media "got it" a bit more this time
        around, and understood the cube was somewhat more than just a toy. Cube
        contests tend to occur in very large cities or areas with large academic
        institutions. There wasn't any cube contest in Detroit in 1981 or 1982
        as far as I know. At least with the internet people who are into the
        cube will find out about any contests, and I do think there will be more
        in the future. Mark On Monday 15 September 2003 21:25, d_funny007 wrote:
        &gt; Yes, that's true. But I did e-mail the Detroit News and one of the

        just &gt; non-existant. I mean there wasn't even anything about the wc
        in &gt; general. A few times there were full-page spreads about
        upcomming &gt; tourist attractions in Toronto, stuff about the good
        exchange rate &gt; and recent low prices due to SARS. They list like 40

        UHhhhhhh....... ya. Just a bit too ambitious for me. Nice to know others
        out there have similar ideas though. But my goal is not to populate
        thousands and thousands of algs now. (I already have close to 8,000 done
        and will have about 10,000 by the time it is finished, more then one alg
        per case, already cornered the market on optimal ones and just need some
        really good sub-optimal ones that can be executed fast, i.e. Ron's novel
        idea of 2-generators.) My goal is to make something that can be used by
        dozens of people world-wide, at the same time, and is user friendly.
        Btw, forgot to mention the whole possiblity of user accounts to track
        people's preferences (metrics, left/right handedness, etc. (Hem, Jess
        might be some help here)). To me yours doesn't sound all that practical,
        well perhaps for BLD solving. A single collective LL alg db, is an
        intermediate step to all sorts of methods (for example I set up the
        back-end to easily filter and give OLL algs or ELL algs, or the wierd
        stuff some of the advanced are working on like COLL). For this reason, I
        hope it is of general interest to cubists our there. If I don't get help
        it will fail... And NO, under no circumstances will I just zip and post
        the entire back-end database on the net somewhere. It is my intellectual
        property, at least until someone else wants to contribute. Besides, it
        will be way cooler on the net dynamically. I am thinking of a feature
        where if a user sees their "signature alg" or contributes it, then they
        get to name it! Sort of like getting to name comets or newly discovered
        stars for amature astronomers.... I'll have some pre-named ones like
        "Sune," which we all know and love. I'm sure there are tons of cool ones
        out there waiting to be monopolized by us. I always called the Z-Perm
        alg, "the DanK move" (which I now know to be originated by Mirek).
        Wouldn't it be cool if in say 10 yrs, some newbee cuber knows an alg to
        be the "&lt;yourname&gt; move". That would just rock. -Doug Li --- In

        &gt; It's a big project and I can't finish it by myself so I set it up
        &gt; recently. Currently my algorithm list has approx. 60,000 algorithms
        &gt; (a little shy of that). The first stage of the AICOP would be to
        &gt; increase that to about half a billion (in small stages). &gt; &gt;
        The first few sub-optimal algorithms (a few edge 5-cycles not in the

        few.

        &gt; my idea for an algorithms database. It seems that interest in it
        &gt; &gt; &gt; is 'iffy at best', there are few that believe it is
        doable, &gt; and/or &gt; &gt; &gt; it doesn't appear to be worth it.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See
        http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aicop (it's in the links &gt; section).
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's a big project and I can't finish it by myself
        so I set it up &gt; &gt; recently. Currently my algorithm list has
        approx. 60,000 &gt; algorithms &gt; &gt; (a little shy of that). The
        first stage of the AICOP would be to &gt; &gt; increase that to about
        half a billion (in small stages). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The first few
        sub-optimal algorithms (a few edge 5-cycles not in &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        above c. 60,000) are already there if anyone wants to optimize a &gt;
        few.

        It's closer to one every 12 seconds. I was running about 6 copies of
        CubeExplorer at once and they all had several cubes on the go. I have a
        lot of positions in the 14-16 area and quite a few 12-13 and 17-18 too.
        I don't have too many over 18 yet but I do have some 19s and of course
        the superflip is 20.

        cubing really is easier than people first imagine. For &gt; a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 2x2x2, what you need to do is first of all orient your corners &gt;
        &gt; (you &gt; &gt; &gt; could do that second but it's less to think
        about doing it &gt; first) &gt; &gt; &gt; and then permute in an
        orientation preserving way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Each corner
        gets assigned an orientation 0, 1 or 2 depending on &gt; &gt; how &gt;
        &gt; &gt; many times you'd need to twist it (by 120 degrees) to get the
        U &gt; or &gt; &gt; D &gt; &gt; &gt; colour in the U or D face.
        (Sometimes 2 might be replaced by - &gt; 1.) &gt; &gt; In &gt; &gt; &gt;
        fact, it is generally easier to think about this geometrically &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; work out pairs or triples to twist rather than remember
        the &gt; &gt; sequence. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After orienting
        you should use 3-cycles to try and place most of &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; corners. Use 3-cycles in the U or D face - e.g. RB'RF2R'BRF2R2 -
        &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; place things without changing the
        orientations.You may be left &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; two corners
        to switch. For a 2x2x2, you can just use a move like &gt; U &gt; &gt;
        &gt; to get to 3-cycles again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course,
        there's always the other option which would be to use &gt; &gt; my &gt;
        &gt; &gt; slightly more advanced blindfold system (not currently in &gt;
        general &gt; &gt; &gt; release, though some have seen advance copies of
        an intermediate &gt; &gt; &gt; version). This will permute your corners
        in one go (orientation &gt; &gt; &gt; preserving too), if they are
        evenly permuted. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The cycle method is used
        by other people. I thought about &gt; &gt; developing &gt; &gt; &gt;
        something like that at one time but went for a work out as you &gt; go
        &gt; &gt; &gt; along approach. Dror is probably the most famous exponent
        of &gt; this &gt; &gt; &gt; other method. (Stiff hands' method.)

        &gt; &gt; Just a bit too ambitious for me. &gt; &gt; Where's your sense
        of adventure? Aren't you curious about the &gt; diameter of the cube?
        Yes, and there are already very tight bounds established for it in at
        least two diffent metrics. (probably 24 in QTM and 20-21 in HTM) I am
        not too interested in it from the computer science point of view, but
        would be interested in the mathematically rigorous ways of
        finding/proving it, which I don't believe has been accomplished yet. I
        suppose you need the CS side to find then the math side to prove. But
        the actual coding of such a thing would be intersesting to see. &gt;
        &gt; really good sub-optimal ones that can be executed fast, i.e. Ron's
        &gt; &gt; novel idea of 2-generators.) &gt; &gt; Well, the entire cube
        can be solved with 2 generators. You could try &gt; to solve the cube
        optimally like that. I'm shooting for a more &gt; standard set of
        generators. What do you mean exactly? A finite union of 2-generators?,
        then depending on how loosely you want it defined, that may be what is
        always done in normal solving, :). I don't see how to solve the entire
        cube with two generators.... unless you are talking about two really
        lengthy guys: one that cycles all edges/corners in a certain way and one
        that say orients certain pieces (of course there are other ways), so I
        suppose it is doable. I was really aiming at 2- generator meaning two
        adjcent "basic turns" like &lt;U,R&gt;, and that is way I mentioned Ron
        there. &gt; BLD? &gt; I'm after a one-step algorithm ultimately, but in
        the short term &gt; I'll settle for a 3.5 or 4.5 step algorithm. Not
        sure what you mean. BLD is short for blindfolded, the abbriviation has
        been used by others here, and since you are a master of the field I
        assumed you would understand it. In any case, it doesn't seem like a
        "fast" method, that is with respect to recognition, I think many of you
        out there would agree that minimizing steps does not always increase
        speed (current popular speed methods are 6-8 steps). Of course it also
        sounds like you are not seeking for speed anymore though. -Doug

        Not everyone wants to monopolize methods and seek the perfect method
        like you. At least for me, the goal is to perfect the method I use and
        not at the expense of losing all originality of it. You have it great
        method, keep working on it and possible practice it yourself to the
        point of say sub-30. Which will finally validate your method(s). Or
        convince someone else to adopt it on a trial bases. Besides, it is much
        more exciting this way. Since you are a man of methods, you can
        apprieciate the competition in this area. I'm sure it took you more then
        a month to prepare the method(s) showcased on your site. I'm pretty sure
        all the fast guys are indeed working on new approaches, optimizations,
        and altering their systems not just their rate of execution and
        recognition. Btw, I am doing this. "Is it a secret weapon?" I think we
        all know the answer to this one. In these times we all can use an "Ace
        up our sleeves." You probably just wanted another method to analyse
        intellectually and debate with others, which is fine. It's just that
        that came off a little method-greedy. -Doug Li --- In

        Hi everybody, I'm wondering whether I can use lucky cases for average
        records. I thought throwing out the best and worst of the twelve runs is
        intended to make up for chance. But then Jess Bonde told in his opinion
        lucky cases shouldn't even be included in those twelve times in the
        first place and that I should maybe put this subject up here which I now
        do. Opinions? Btw, I'm relatively new to speedcubing and I just don't

        Well, my opinion is that in an average run, you can use lucky times. as
        i stated a few days back, with my solving method the chance of me
        getting a lucky time is 1 / 4, so in 12 runs, i'll get 3 lucky cases on
        average. Terje -----Original Message----- From: stefan_pochmann

        really is easier than people first imagine. For a &gt; 2x2x2, what you
        need to do is first of all orient your corners (you &gt; could do that
        second but it's less to think about doing it first) &gt; and then
        permute in an orientation preserving way. &gt; &gt; Each corner gets
        assigned an orientation 0, 1 or 2 depending on how &gt; many times you'd
        need to twist it (by 120 degrees) to get the U or D &gt; colour in the U
        or D face. (Sometimes 2 might be replaced by -1.) In &gt; fact, it is
        generally easier to think about this geometrically and &gt; work out
        pairs or triples to twist rather than remember the sequence. &gt; &gt;
        After orienting you should use 3-cycles to try and place most of the
        &gt; corners. Use 3-cycles in the U or D face - e.g. RB'RF2R'BRF2R2 - to
        &gt; place things without changing the orientations.You may be left with
        &gt; two corners to switch. For a 2x2x2, you can just use a move like U
        &gt; to get to 3-cycles again. &gt; &gt; Of course, there's always the
        other option which would be to use my &gt; slightly more advanced
        blindfold system (not currently in general &gt; release, though some
        have seen advance copies of an intermediate &gt; version). This will
        permute your corners in one go (orientation &gt; preserving too), if
        they are evenly permuted. &gt; &gt; The cycle method is used by other
        people. I thought about developing &gt; something like that at one time
        but went for a work out as you go &gt; along approach. Dror is probably
        the most famous exponent of this &gt; other method. (Stiff hands'
        method.)

        I think it depends on how many times you get a lucky case. If you get
        five or so, then it won't be a realaverage of your time. An average is
        supposed to represent the times you normally get. Yesterday I was doing
        a one handed average of 3, and I got a 41 and a 45, making the average
        49, while I know I normally average around 53. --- In

        &gt; Yes, and there are already very tight bounds established for it in
        &gt; at least two diffent metrics. (probably 24 in QTM and 20-21 in HTM)
        Those are only the lower bounds (for QTM it's 26 since there is a
        position that requires 26 moves; for HTM I believe it's still 20 unless
        someone has recently found a position that requires 21 moves). I believe
        the upper bound for the HTM is 29 (anyone have a solid reference to
        this?) and I'm not sure what the upper bound to the QTM is (but I
        vaguely remember 42; again a solid reference would be appreciated).
        That's still a pretty wide gap between those numbers.

        potentially I guess, but you would have to be able to see what corner
        rotation you need to do and why, and you would have to rotate more than
        one corner in the correct orientation, so it is very unlikely. DanH :)

        times you normally get. &gt; Yesterday I was doing a one handed average
        of 3, and I got a 41 and &gt; a 45, making the average 49, while I know

        Well, my opinion is that in an average run, you can use lucky &gt;
        times. as i stated a few days back, with my solving method the &gt;
        chance of me getting a lucky time is 1 / 4, so in 12 runs, i'll get &gt;
        3 lucky cases on average. &gt; &gt; Terje Ah, we've finally come back to
        the discussion of lucky times and averages. I personally don't tend to
        put a lot of stock in single times, but rely more heavily on the
        average. As Michael &amp; Terje already indicated, an average is
        supposed to be a measurement of your typical solving - your average.
        That said, if you are getting lucky cases, while taking an average, as
        frequently as you normally would, then I would say they should be kept
        in there, and averaged in. If, on the other hand, you would typically
        get lucky cases 1/4, but get 2/4 or 3/4 while taking an average, then
        that's probably a "lucky average", and should be discarded, as would
        normally be done with a single lucky time for the purpose of comparison
        against other times. Just as you would not (or at least should not)
        submit a lucky single time to any "high score" list (such as the UWR on
        SpeedCubing.com), you shouldn't submit an average that is overly lucky -
        I suppose you could either drop the average altogether or drop some
        lucky cases (to get down to a more typical number of them). This is a
        moot point with things like the Sunday Contest, where you are only
        provided enough mixing algs to do 13 scrambles (providing for 1 pop).
        Regardless, I find that sometimes my lucky cases are my slower times,
        and some of my best times are not technically lucky (no steps of my
        solution skipped). It's these that make me wonder if the definition of
        luck (skipping a step of your solution that isn't too commonly skipped)
        really hits it - for example, what about when things just fall together
        well, even though it doesn't cause any steps of your solution to be
        skipped? This is where the definition of luck becomes questionable. Even
        still, I figure when taking an average, it all averages out in the end.

        I think that you should include lucky cases in your averages. Firstly,
        you are recording an unofficial average, in which case you are only
        approximationg proper test conditions. Do you put your cube down after
        inspection, and then pick it up when the timer starts? Secondly, you
        don't throw out unlucky cases which may also skew your results. Thirdly,
        the concept of lucky or unlucky is irrelevant in an actual
        competition--your time is your time. Finally, within the unofficial
        times, there are 2 accepted versions of taking an average, one using
        whole seconds plus .5, or using 100ths of a second and calculating a
        true average. Couple this with the concept of "rolling averages", and I
        am left with the impression that lucky times don't seem to be that big
        of a deal. OTOH, if you are trying to get an accurate representation of
        your times, and you happen to sneak a lucky case past the fastest and
        slowest time elimination, you need to have a general idea of how
        frequently your "lucky" cases should happen. If it happens more than 10%
        of the time, then it probably ain't lucky. If it happens to come up less
        than 10% of the time, then I would just make a note of it when posting a
        record. What constitutes a lucky case is very dependent on the method
        you use, and how you choose to define a lucky case. I use a corners
        first method (Guimond) to solve my corners, which requires 3 steps. The
        number of setup moves necessary before step 1 and 2 can vary. Frquently,
        I can skip the 2nd step. When I finish the L and R face, and orient the
        M slice, I have a 1 in 12 chance of direct solving the M slice.
        Furthermore, I can solve 3 edges in one face and inadvertently solve (I
        can do this on purpose more often as I get better) a few edges in the
        other face. My lucky cases will be very differnt than someone who uses
        an F2L method. Furthermore, we can start with the same scramble, and one
        of us will get a lucky case while the other won't. What would you do if
        you got a lucky case, were shocked by it, and therefore flubbed your
        time? Would you still count it? Just some thoughts. Lucas

        "Wrong" is such an ugly word. I don't like seeing it anywhere in this
        fourm. "Not quite accurate" seems more pleasing. Yes, I said that
        Allan's team has the association with Seven Towns (perhaps it was stated
        awkwardly). I wasn't aware of any deadlines, but I suppose it is implied
        since Seven Towns is going with them. The focus of Richard's piece is
        narrower, so I expect him to be done firset even without deadlines. You
        still never said when any of these 2 are expected to be finished. Since

        magic are done by starting at the unlinked rings rectangle state to the
        linked rings state. This makes it different from most of the other
        records on speedcubing.com as there is no thinking necessary - it is the
        same every time. I won at the world championships a few weeks ago with a
        time of 3.06 seconds (which includes time for picking it up). Different
        scrambled positions take such varying amounts of time to solve that you
        cannot reasonably compare one to the other. I would however like to see
        a Magic competition some time where every competitor starts with the
        same truly scrambled state. Jaap

        I'm pretty sure that it is from one state to the other, so two "solved"
        positions as Yaap explained it. It usually goes from all 3 rings
        unlinked to 3 rings linked for the Regular Magic. Any position that
        looks funky with stuff out of line on both sides is therefore considered
        an intermediate position. Of couse making complicated looking 3-D shapes
        are always fun to do once you get bored with it... It is really feasible
        to have sub-5s times here, I quickly learned a solutions to execute in
        under 15s (conservative estimate, never timed myself and don't have
        one). I'd really like to learn how to string one though, but sadly don't
        have the time for such things... -Doug --- In

        There's a coffee shop near where I work that I sometimes visit at
        lunchtime. Today when I was in there, the manager said 'hey Jasmine!' I
        was surprised because I'd never told them my name, although I'm there
        frequently enough that they know my face by now. Anyway, I asked how he
        knew my name and he said he'd seen the RWC article in the weekend
        newspaper. He then proceeded to ask me about cubing, so I offered to do
        a solving demo. He seemed very impressed and said he was going try and
        find his cube and bring it in for me to solve. :) Jasmine.

        especially mine. I happen to enjoy stepping &gt; &gt; &gt; through &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solutions frame by frame and see exactly
        what solutions &gt; &gt; they &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pick. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since everyone solved the same position it
        would be &gt; &gt; awesome &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the final and see what different
        solutions &gt; people &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picked. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have I mentioned how

        &gt; Yes, and there are already very tight bounds established for it in
        &gt; at least two diffent metrics. (probably 24 in QTM and 20-21 in HTM)
        Those are only the lower bounds (for QTM it's 26 since there is a
        position that requires 26 moves; for HTM I believe it's still 20 unless
        someone has recently found a position that requires 21 moves). I believe
        the upper bound for the HTM is 29 (anyone have a solid reference to
        this?) and I'm not sure what the upper bound to the QTM is (but I
        vaguely remember 42; again a solid reference would be appreciated).

        Hi Rune, They stand for Quarter Turn Metric and Half Turn Metric. They
        are different ways to determine the length of a move sequence. In the
        QTM a quarter turn of a face is counted as one move and a half turn of a
        face is counted as two moves. In the HTM both quarter turns and half
        turns are counted as one move. In both metric systems, slice moves are
        counted as two moves. LarsV --- In

        is to move 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 and 5 to 1 so i'm left with (17)(28)(46)?
        if that's the case, is the objective to come up with my own series of
        moves to get 5 into positon where I can swap it, keep those moves in
        mind and undo them after I swap these three pieces? That is exactly what
        you do. &gt; Also, I don't understand the &gt; calculation of the corner
        twist...I guess I see where he gets the &gt; numbers and how, but i'm
        somehow missing its significance. What if it's nonzero? The twist of the
        corners is always 0, but the twist of the corners on the U or the F face
        may not be 0. Add them together and they always make 0. Look on the
        bottom of the theory page on my site to see an actual example. You don't
        really need to know the twist of any face, it just might be interesting
        to know whether you can orient all the corners in the U face my just
        twisting the corners in the U face, and thus similarly the same for the
        D face. If you can do that for one then you can do that for the other.
        The determining factor for whether that is possible is that the twist of
        the corners on that face is 0. Anyway, as I said you don't really need
        to know this. The parity of the corners is also information you don't
        need to predetermine, as all it informs you is whether yoe will need to
        do a swapping move that involves two corners and two edges at the same
        time, rather than just 3-cycles on corners and 3-cycles on edges. I like
        to determine that information so that I can remember the edges in the
        position that they will be once I have done that 2corner+2edge swapping
        move if necessary rather than having to change my mental map halfway
        through solving. I hope this is helping. - stiff_hands

        tend to just try to find the first one i see and then go for the next,
        but &gt; then i also use a lot of time looking usually. &gt; &gt; Terje
        If you are going for speed, then restricting the improvisation in the
        F2L by doing them in order can only slow you down. I complete the F2L in
        about 20 so I am not an expert on the subject though. As for the
        extended look ahead time, try to do your F2L algorithms a little slower
        and look around the cube (physically too, look around the back of it at
        first). Another thing that helps is learning the algorithms with both
        hands for all four pair placements (FR/FL/BL/BR). This is a little weird
        at first, but with a little practice you'll start to see how useful it
        is. I hope there's something useful buried in this post. Good luck.

        Wow, thanks for the explanation. It's very helpful to know my thinking
        is correct because it's hard to keep moving forward when you're not even
        sure you understand what you're trying to do. I think I have enough
        information now to try/practice doing the 2x2x2 and then hopefully
        moving on to the 3x3x3. Thanks for your help. Dave --- In

        so i'm left with (17)(28)(46)? if that's the case, is &gt; the objective
        to come up with my own series of moves to get 5 into &gt; positon where
        I can swap it, keep those moves in mind and undo them &gt; after I swap
        these three pieces? &gt; &gt; That is exactly what you do. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Also, I don't understand the &gt; &gt; calculation of the corner
        twist...I guess I see where he gets the &gt; &gt; numbers and how, but
        i'm somehow missing its significance. What &gt; if it's nonzero? &gt;
        &gt; The twist of the corners is always 0, but the twist of the corners
        &gt; on the U or the F face may not be 0. Add them together and they
        &gt; always make 0. Look on the bottom of the theory page on my site to
        &gt; see an actual example. You don't really need to know the twist of
        &gt; any face, it just might be interesting to know whether you can &gt;
        orient all the corners in the U face my just twisting the corners in
        &gt; the U face, and thus similarly the same for the D face. If you can
        &gt; do that for one then you can do that for the other. The determining
        &gt; factor for whether that is possible is that the twist of the
        corners &gt; on that face is 0. Anyway, as I said you don't really need
        to know &gt; this. &gt; &gt; The parity of the corners is also
        information you don't need to &gt; predetermine, as all it informs you
        is whether yoe will need to do a &gt; swapping move that involves two
        corners and two edges at the same &gt; time, rather than just 3-cycles
        on corners and 3-cycles on edges. I &gt; like to determine that
        information so that I can remember the edges &gt; in the position that
        they will be once I have done that &gt; 2corner+2edge swapping move if
        necessary rather than having to &gt; change my mental map halfway
        through solving. &gt; &gt; I hope this is helping. &gt; &gt; -

        Wow, 1981, that's a lot of cubing experience... But for that same reason
        you should of known about the Z-Perm. Generally I don't use the
        mainstream methods either, but I am still aware of them and learned many
        of the techniques and algorithms in other people's methods so that I can
        better talk about them and understand what others are talking about. A
        few years ago when I first heard of the term "Z-Perm" I didn't like it
        either, but what else would you call it. Now it sounds cool to me. The
        problem with your "Adjecent Pair Swap" naming is that that is really a
        more broad category of 5 distinct such cases when factoring in flip (I
        know the optimal algs fore each, btw). As for the actual algorithm, it
        is (with the LL on F): [13](RU'R'U) (DR'D(U'))(R'UR)(D2'F). (Note the
        D2' as opposed to D2). I know it can be done in 2.1s average (first hand
        experience, :)). Very interesting alg you have though (r2Db2D'b'r2b),
        don't care for the lower case notation for slices, and I'm curious why
        you choose to identify with the B side instead of the F side (you use b
        instead of f2??). It's far superior to any of the brute force once I
        used to use.... I think of this way as the finesse way of doing it, very
        much in the spirit of the H/+ Perm many of the advanced use. -Doug ---

        Hi d_, Thanks for the feedback, The project that I'm on is to develop
        entirely on my own. I don't want to end my project just because people
        have posted. I don't know how long it will take me to complete the 1200
        or so LL algs, and the other stuff I'm working on. When I first
        discovered all the speedcube sites online I looked at several of them.
        When I got to the fourth or fifth website I found an algorithm that I
        didn't know. That algorithm had been developed by a computer program,
        and while that's of interest, I really do want to develop this stuff
        myself. Also, the strategies I use for the last level are different, not
        as linear as what's online. Sometimes I flip over edges while permuting
        corners, and flip over corners while permuting edges. Some of what I do
        is all over the map. I generally use 1, 2 or 3 looks on the LL. I'm
        almost up to a complete 2 look set of algs, and partway to a one look.
        Sometimes I spot the solution to the LL while still solving the F2L. For
        what I'm doing, learning the algs that other's use would interfere with
        what I'm doing. As for the name "adjacent edge swap" that's just what I
        call it. Unlike the notation idea I posted because of its simplicity and
        its being less confusing to new cubists, I'm not suggesting any naming
        scheme. My notation allows for the f, l and d to be used for slices, but
        a long time ago I chose to use the b to help keep straight which way was
        clockwise on the B side. This makes it easier to relate to algs that I
        write down. OK, what's the H/+ Perm? David J --- In

        wrote: &gt; Wow, 1981, that's a lot of cubing experience... But for that
        same &gt; reason you should of known about the Z-Perm. Generally I don't
        use &gt; the mainstream methods either, but I am still aware of them and
        &gt; learned many of the techniques and algorithms in other people's
        &gt; methods so that I can better talk about them and understand what
        &gt; others are talking about. &gt; &gt; A few years ago when I first
        heard of the term "Z-Perm" I didn't &gt; like it either, but what else
        would you call it. Now it sounds cool &gt; to me. The problem with your
        "Adjecent Pair Swap" naming is that &gt; that is really a more broad
        category of 5 distinct such cases when &gt; factoring in flip (I know
        the optimal algs fore each, btw). &gt; &gt; As for the actual algorithm,
        it is (with the LL on F): [13](RU'R'U) &gt; (DR'D(U'))(R'UR)(D2'F).
        (Note the D2' as opposed to D2). I know it &gt; can be done in 2.1s
        average (first hand experience, :)). &gt; &gt; Very interesting alg you
        have though (r2Db2D'b'r2b), don't care for &gt; the lower case notation
        for slices, and I'm curious why you choose &gt; to identify with the B
        side instead of the F side (you use b instead &gt; of f2??). It's far
        superior to any of the brute force once I used to &gt; use.... I think
        of this way as the finesse way of doing it, very &gt; much in the spirit
        of the H/+ Perm many of the advanced use. &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Michael Atkinson, possible Lee June Kyo, and I are working on a one
        handed cubing site. For now it will just a text page with tips and
        hints, but videos of different moves, move-combos, and finger tricks are
        on the way as well. At the beginning, in my opinion at least, to get
        fast it is best to practice each and every turn R R' R2 L L' L2 F F' F2
        B B' B2 D D' D2 U U' U2 from a standard grip (thumb on front face and
        middle finger on back face) and just get used to doing each move. From
        there you can work on using whichever way feels best to your hands when
        doing the moves. This will help increase your speed. More to come on the
        one handed cubing site, but I would say for now the most important part
        is to get your hand used to manipulating the cube using only one hand.

        Hi everyone - I'm new here. I've been cubing for about four months now,
        and I use the Petrus method. I usually get the first two layers done in
        about 38-43 seconds, then the last layer in about 15-20 seconds more. I
        only know the basic last layer moves. From watching some videos, I think
        I could use a better cube (the one I'm using is main brand, one of the
        new ones, and it has had four months of use and silicone spray
        lubricant). I can't really do finger tricks with it because it's hard to
        move with one finger. I need to know if it's worth the money to buy an
        original Ideal cube off Ebay or if I should just go with an Oddzon. I'm
        thinking of switching to the Dan Knights method, but I only want to

        - I'm new here. I've been cubing for about four months &gt; now, and I
        use the Petrus method. I usually get the first two layers &gt; done in
        about 38-43 seconds, then the last layer in about 15-20 &gt; seconds
        more. I only know the basic last layer moves. You can get quite far by
        just learning how to execute those few basic moves very fast. This was
        posted by Gilles Roux on the petrusmethod list recently: &gt; PS: I just
        had a 21.8s average with the basic method, 7 steps, 6 &gt; last-layer
        sequences (2 for step 5, 1 for step 6, and 3 for step 7). It is true
        that a good cube would help to execute moves fast, and stop your wrists
        hurting. But if you just sand down the insides of your existing cube,
        wash it, then lubricate it, you'll have a good cube. But even with a
        good cube, that probably won't make you faster because most time is
        wasted looking for pieces, or just thinking of what to do next. You can
        improve recognition and response time by just practicing a single step
        over and over again. I'm sure it is possible to get times in the low 20s
        without using finger tricks. (Does anyone want to verify this?) Also,
        try this: time how long it takes to do each step on average, but
        excluding thinking time. In other words, we are measuring "execution"
        time. For example, for petrus step 2, allow yourself to preinspect and
        think up a solution. After you have a plan for solving step 2, then
        start the timer. If you add up the execution times for each step, you
        should get a total time much less than the time it really takes you to
        solve the cube. The difference between these two times tells you how
        much time you waste looking for pieces and thinking of what to do next.
        &gt; Or do you think that I'm being too impatient, and that I &gt;
        should stick with the Petrus method? Thanks in advance. You're already
        under 60 seconds after only 4 months! That's very good, so I'd just say
        you're too impatient :-) Maybe you can be under 50 seconds in another
        month. Learning to do the last layer fast (with a good cube) can also be
        a good safety net. Ryan

        I'm inserting the last corner on the first layer, if I see the

        finishing the first two layers is that by chance you come within 5 or 6
        moves of a solved cube. If you can see it, you can guide the pieces
        carefully into their home, and skip the rest of your usual steps. This
        has happened to me about 3 times this year. Does it happen to anyone

        Hey, I bought dan knights "the simple solution" video. the video itself
        is pretty corny but the sheet that comes with it with all the algorithms
        and pictures is what's worth the money. I've only had it for about a
        month and a half and ive gotten my averages to about 52- 52 seconds. my
        best is a non lucky 39.75. I use dan knights timer under that you can
        get from the files link on this website. I spend soo much time with my
        cube though. I put so many hours in a week with a cube. so it might take
        you longer to get under a minute averages but its a cool method. i like
        it. a lot to memorize though. i havent even bothered with the f2l yet. i
        do that the 3 step way. ive been working on the last layer so i can do
        it in 2 steps most of the time. Btw the video will teach you how to read
        the notation and stuff if you dont know how, i know when i first saw the
        notation it looked pretty confusing and i didnt get it. so yea i
        reccommend the video. good luck. if you get it write back and tell me
        what you think of it. Adam

        I find that with the basic Petrus Method, the entire 3 look or more LL,
        you can easily get into the 30s or maybe even high 20s. So you should

        Ryan makes an excellent point. I agree that doing it all yourself is the
        best way to to do things, that is to have a deeper, solidified
        understanding of the cube. And about Ryan's observation: Yes I too
        notice that, I think it occures about as often for me. It happens when I
        focus in on the LL edge flip as I do the final step of my F2L method.
        &gt; &gt; When I first discovered all the speedcube sites online I
        looked &gt; &gt; at several of them. When I got to the fourth or fifth
        website I &gt; &gt; found an &gt; &gt; algorithm that I didn't know.
        That algorithm had been developed &gt; &gt; by a computer program, and
        while that's of interest, I really &gt; &gt; do want to develop this
        stuff myself. I'm not quite sure what you mean by "develop". According
        to Jessica, many algorithms were found by trial-and-error (taking down
        c/e pairs and puting them back in differently), this was especially true
        in the days before fast optimal crunching programs. For me, I got most
        of my algorithms from other sources at the beginning. I did some
        'developing' by learning the full effects of those algs (usually short
        and sweet ones) and the effects when applied twice, one after the other
        from different roations/mirrors/inversions. Then I went through a phase
        of batch running optimizer programs to find optimal and sub-optimal algs
        for each detailed case to for a particular set (I chose to do CLL and
        ELL).... &gt; &gt; OK, what's the H/+ Perm? That would be swaping 2
        pairs of edges across/opposite without fliping them. Jessica's naming
        scheme gives it as H, while I prefer to use the + symbol as it looks
        similar to the diagram. &gt; &gt; Some of what I do is all over the map.
        I generally use 1, 2 or 3 looks on the LL. Yes, similarly here... except
        I'm more predictable, down to about 1.8 looks currently... and by looks
        I mean algs. When and if we ever get a universal terminologies page
        setup as Macky suggested last month, that would be one of the things I
        want, that is people shouldn't be using "algs" and "looks"
        interchangably it blurs the meaning for the lower level cubists. I can
        always solve the LL in one look... but usually in 2 algs... unless it's
        one of those days where I just keep messing up over and over do to poor
        recognition. &gt; &gt; For what I'm doing, learning the algs that
        other's use would interfere with what I'm doing. No, that is a
        completely unqualified statement. In almost all cases our sub-goals
        overlap to some degree... For example, almost all of us have the
        intermediate LL step. (eh..., obviously not CF people :), but even then
        their later edge fiddling step overlaps with my CLL). Now in this
        particular case, I doubt you'll infrequently run into the so-called
        Z-Perm, I mean come-on! This is unless of course you go through an
        end/near-end step of doing in- place flips of the edges, lol. That'd be
        time-consuming from my experience. So in conclusion, seeing how other
        people do it is enlightening and something that shouldn't be avoided
        forever (you've been cubing for over 20yrs David). We'll be able to
        better mutually help each other that way... -Doug (that's "DOUG", not

        edges are already solved). One &gt; thing I often do as I'm inserting
        the last corner on the first layer, if &gt; I see the opportunity, is to
        change those moves slightly to make another &gt; corner fall into place
        on the top. Sometimes I get lucky, and the other &gt; 3 corners fall
        into place too. &gt; &gt; The other thing that can happen as you're
        finishing the first two layers &gt; is that by chance you come within 5
        or 6 moves of a solved cube. If you &gt; can see it, you can guide the
        pieces carefully into their home, and skip &gt; the rest of your usual
        steps. This has happened to me about 3 times this &gt; year. Does it
        happen to anyone else? &gt; &gt; Ryan

      <div class="email-content">
        These 2 posts remind me that I should keep you guys aprised of my
        situation here. One year ago I wanted to form a cube club on my campus
        and had little to no success. After RWC, I think I need to get one
        going, esp. with all my friends pushing for it. Now I don't know if
        Purdue has one yet, I mean what, Justin taught over 60 students how to
        do it and probably a bit more counting the indirects. (Or they have it
        just unofficially?) So Justing might have some advice on this topic. MIT
        must no longer have one after Cube-Lovers died out. I am just in the
        process of formalizing one here at U-Mich. I've pertty much got all the
        signatures I need (for purposes of officalization and getting funds) and
        should have that cleared up by the end of the week. I'll have my other
        "founding memebers"/cube friends put up flyers (like 100s) over the
        weekend for a mass- meeting the following Thursday (not sure what time
        yet). I have about 10 friends seriously interested so it won't be too
        lame at worst. But I'm not sure, do I really want like 200 people
        showing up or just a small geeky-group? (Either way, a few girls
        wouldn't hurt, :).) Of course the main issue I'm concerned with is how
        do I convene it without sounding all arrogant and cube-mighty? I think
        what I'll do is have my friends introduce me and I'll "just, not
        demonstrate my cubing." (Wouldn't want to intimidate those that can't
        even solve it yet; my sub 2-min friends will be impressive enough.) So
        the root of the confusion is that my fundamental goal was "simply" to
        drum-up interest and awareness on campus about speed- cubing, but there
        is some uneasyness about converting a large number of people sub 90s.
        See... some of you may not completely realize it, but we are very
        powerful. Our individual knowledge of the cube might seem like nothing
        to ourselves or compared to that of the collective cube community, but
        we understand the cube well enough to teach others how to solve it in
        under say 90s quite rapidly. I was shocked when I got my friend
        (non-technical major) from no-exp to sub-50s in only 5 weeks and some
        other ones with varying amounts of success due to less time spent. I
        suppose that the enigma come from the fact that speedcubing is
        externally thought of as an exclusive type of almost elitist society
        (the coolest among all geeks). Of course since we are apart of it, we
        know that we are in actuality very nice people, just look at RWC. We all
        want to help each other and similarly we'd want to help newcommers to
        the field. It is in some ways better for there to be fewer members, it
        makes us more unique, if you will. But there are so many amazing aspect
        of the cube, I can't help but try to share with others. So basically I'm
        looking for your takes on the balance of exclusivity vs. expanding our
        community. Any ideas about running local/school cube clubs properly
        would be apprieciated also. -Doug --- In

        They are different ways to determine the length of a move sequence. In
        the QTM a quarter turn of a face is counted as one move and a half turn
        of a face is counted as two moves. In the HTM both quarter turns and
        half turns are counted as one move. In both metric systems, slice moves
        are counted as two moves. LarsV --- In

        Re: THE Algorithm Database (long) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and there are
        already very tight bounds established for it in &gt; &gt; at least two
        diffent metrics. (probably 24 in QTM and 20-21 in HTM) &gt; &gt; Those
        are only the lower bounds (for QTM it's 26 since there is a &gt;
        position that requires 26 moves; for HTM I believe it's still 20 &gt;
        unless someone has recently found a position that requires 21 moves).
        &gt; I believe the upper bound for the HTM is 29 (anyone have a solid
        &gt; reference to this?) and I'm not sure what the upper bound to the
        QTM &gt; is (but I vaguely remember 42; again a solid reference would be
        &gt; appreciated). That's still a pretty wide gap between those numbers.

        If you've been using it for 4 months, it's lubed with silicone, and you

        one - I've heard that happens. Well, if it's any consolation, I also
        have an OddzOn cube. Mine is probably about 1 year old, and shows no
        signs of wearing out any time soon (though I don't cube nearly as much
        as most). Got mine for $9 at Target, lubed it (and relubed it when it
        wore down) with silicone, and for that, Jessica Fridrich (2nd at the WC)
        said "This is a nice cube" when she used it for a short time, while we
        were in Toronto - who knows, maybe she was just being nice, but I'd have
        to agree with her. That said, unless quality has gotten worse over the
        last year in general, then I'd say spend the $9 to get a new OddzOn
        cube, and you'll probably get a better one. If not, could you try
        breaking it in some more and/or lube it more thoroughly? - Grant

        develop this stuff myself. &gt; &gt; I'm not quite sure what you mean by
        "develop". According to Jessica, &gt; many algorithms were found by
        trial-and-error (taking down c/e pairs &gt; and puting them back in
        differently), this was especially true in &gt; the days before fast
        optimal crunching programs. For me, I got most &gt; of my algorithms
        from other sources at the beginning. I did &gt; some 'developing' by
        learning the full effects of those algs &gt; (usually short and sweet
        ones) and the effects when applied twice, &gt; one after the other from
        different roations/mirrors/inversions. Then &gt; I went through a phase
        of batch running optimizer programs to find &gt; optimal and sub-optimal
        algs for each detailed case to for a &gt; particular set (I chose to do
        CLL and ELL).... That's how Jessica works. I don't use trial an error.
        I'll show you what I mean by "develop." For example: I figured that if I
        moved a slice up, say r, onto the Up side, and rotated that side 180
        degrees, U2, then pulled the slice back down, r', and rotated the Up
        side back, U2, that I would exchange 3 edge pieces in a line. I looked
        at the possibility, pictured how to do it, did it and it worked. r U2 r'
        U2. There was no error. I figured I could substitute another edge not in
        that line for one of those edge pieces in a line, like R2 D' and that
        worked. I then figured I could line them up using the Up side in stead
        of the Down side and that worked, and that's how I arrived at the alg I
        use for swapping three edges on the LL. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, what's
        the H/+ Perm? &gt; &gt; That would be swaping 2 pairs of edges
        across/opposite without &gt; fliping them. Jessica's naming scheme gives
        it as H, while I prefer &gt; to use the + symbol as it looks similar to
        the diagram. I call that the "opposite edge pair swap". At first I used
        an 8 move alg then I developed a 7 move alg. &gt; &gt; &gt; Some of what
        I do is all over the map. I generally use 1, 2 or 3 &gt; looks on the
        LL. &gt; &gt; Yes, similarly here... except I'm more predictable, down
        to about &gt; 1.8 looks currently... and by looks I mean algs. When and
        if we ever &gt; get a universal terminologies page setup as Macky
        suggested last &gt; month, that would be one of the things I want, that
        is people &gt; shouldn't be using "algs" and "looks" interchangably it
        blurs the &gt; meaning for the lower level cubists. I can always solve
        the LL in &gt; one look... but usually in 2 algs... unless it's one of
        those days &gt; where I just keep messing up over and over do to poor
        recognition. I don't use "algs" and "looks" to mean the same thing. If
        often use one look and two algs because I know what the second algorithm
        is going to be. &gt; &gt; &gt; For what I'm doing, learning the algs
        that other's use would &gt; interfere with what I'm doing. &gt; &gt; No,
        that is a completely unqualified statement. The qualification is that it
        applies to me. I didn't make a blanket statement applting it to
        everyone. &gt; In almost all cases &gt; our sub-goals overlap to some
        degree... For example, almost all of &gt; us have the intermediate LL
        step. (eh..., obviously not CF &gt; people :), but even then their later
        edge fiddling step overlaps &gt; with my CLL). Now in this particular
        case, I doubt you'll &gt; infrequently run into the so-called Z-Perm, I
        mean come-on! This is &gt; unless of course you go through an
        end/near-end step of doing in- &gt; place flips of the edges, lol.
        That'd be time-consuming from my &gt; experience. &gt; &gt; So in
        conclusion, seeing how other people do it is enlightening and &gt;
        something that shouldn't be avoided forever (you've been cubing for &gt;
        over 20yrs David). On and off. I'll get there, no need to rush. &gt;
        We'll be able to better mutually help each other &gt; that way... &gt;

        Correct, that's why I actually prefer STM, but QTM has some theoretical
        value... If you scramble a cube up with an odd number of quarter turns
        then it will always take an odd number of quarter turns to solve and
        similarly for even numbers. -Doug --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and there are already very
        tight bounds established for it &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at
        least two diffent metrics. (probably 24 in QTM and 20- 21 in &gt; HTM)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those are only the lower bounds
        (for QTM it's 26 since there is a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position that
        requires 26 moves; for HTM I believe it's still 20 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        unless someone has recently found a position that requires 21 &gt;
        moves). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe the upper bound for the HTM is 29
        (anyone have a solid &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reference to this?) and I'm not
        sure what the upper bound to the &gt; QTM &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is (but I
        vaguely remember 42; again a solid reference would be &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; appreciated). That's still a pretty wide gap between those &gt;

        But the really trick is of course to break it in without lubing it. I
        can fully break in an Oddzon cube in no longer then 2 months to the same

        I'd say &gt; spend the $9 to get a new OddzOn cube, and you'll probably

        Hi Dan H, I have two problems with your notation. First it isn't
        intuitive. Below you say the S slice is the layer in between F and B,
        which says nothing about the direction of a turn. Second it is
        counter-intuitive. Not only do you use lower case for the larger
        movement, you also use one letter to designate moving two layers, and
        you do that twice! I'm with Dan G that the simpler, more intuitive
        notation is the way to go. Why adopt such a clumsy system? Because
        you're used to it? You would switch in a moment to an alg that was
        easier, why not a easier notation? David J --- In

        Hi, Although I use slice moves, I often get confused M, S, E. M and RL'
        does same thing but the center moves with M. To describe the detail, we
        had better to have some notations represent slice moves. I would suggest
        M (=M), W (=M'), V (=S), A (=S') &gt; (=E), &lt; (=E') , instead. It is
        confusing to determine CW or CCW for slices. How do you think guys?
        Since this is new idea, it may be more confusing. Masayuki Akimoto

        Yes Mike, I did almost start a cube clube at my old high school (I
        switched starting this year as a junior). In one semester I taught about
        6 people or so, and if I were to start a cube Clube there, it would have
        been very successful, because it go to the point when I walked down the
        halls, LOADS of people had the cube, just playing with it (I guess they
        heard of 'some guy' solve it in 20 seconds? {me} lol)... So yeh, one
        person can start a huge cubing community, definately (you have to be
        cool too though, and Doug, I like the idea of not showing off your sub
        25 second solve at first, and to drum up interest, excellent). So now I
        have 2 years to 're-launch' a cube community at this new school, of
        which is college prep, and many are too afraid to 'look dumb' or
        something (the usual reaction), but when you first show people, then
        other people say "if he can learn it, then I CAN LEARN IT!", so yes,
        teaching a few people at first, and having them show the audience it is
        possible is _very_effective (from what i've seen). Doug: YES, HAVE THE
        CUBING COMMUNITY GROW!!! I think 1 out of every 10-20 cubers will even
        be interested in going to a World Championship or tournament, so yeh
        grow the cubing community ASAP. Mike: I was going to start a cubing
        community at my old school, but now that i moved, yes i very much plan
        on it, and is very possible i see.... Brent Michael Atkinson

        Good points all. I just want to add that I don't think any statistician
        would recommend subjectively classifying your solves lucky/unlucky as a
        way to get more representative data. There are two ways to do that. 1.
        Get bigger samples. Averages of 10 are much more respected than single
        times, for good reason. If that still doesn't get good enough data, you
        should increase the sample. Take an average of 25 or 50. We could get
        into standard deviation and margin of error here, but let's not... 2.
        More sophisticated math. Disregarding off the highest and lowest times
        is one way to reduce the influence of freak events. You can drive that
        further. If you remove the top and bottom 5 times from a 12 solution run
        you get the median value, which is often used for that purpose. But then
        you need to be aware that you're measuring something else than the
        average does. One cuber can have a lower average than an other but a
        higher median. Which one is the better cuber? It completely depends on
        your point of view. /Lars At 0:16 +0000 9/17/03, cubacca1972 wrote:
        &gt;I think that you should include lucky cases in your averages. &gt;
        &gt;Firstly, you are recording an unofficial average, in which case you
        &gt;are only approximationg proper test conditions. Do you put your
        &gt;cube down after inspection, and then pick it up when the timer
        &gt;starts? &gt; &gt;Secondly, you don't throw out unlucky cases which
        may also skew your &gt;results. &gt; &gt;Thirdly, the concept of lucky
        or unlucky is irrelevant in an actual &gt;competition--your time is your
        time. &gt; &gt;Finally, within the unofficial times, there are 2
        accepted versions &gt;of taking an average, one using whole seconds plus
        .5, or using &gt;100ths of a second and calculating a true average.
        Couple this with &gt;the concept of "rolling averages", and I am left
        with the impression &gt;that lucky times don't seem to be that big of a
        deal. &gt; &gt;OTOH, if you are trying to get an accurate representation
        of your &gt;times, and you happen to sneak a lucky case past the fastest
        and &gt;slowest time elimination, you need to have a general idea of how
        &gt;frequently your "lucky" cases should happen. If it happens more
        &gt;than 10% of the time, then it probably ain't lucky. If it happens
        &gt;to come up less than 10% of the time, then I would just make a note
        &gt;of it when posting a record. &gt; &gt;What constitutes a lucky case
        is very dependent on the method you &gt;use, and how you choose to
        define a lucky case. I use a corners &gt;first method (Guimond) to solve
        my corners, which requires 3 steps. &gt;The number of setup moves
        necessary before step 1 and 2 can vary. &gt;Frquently, I can skip the
        2nd step. When I finish the L and R face, &gt;and orient the M slice, I
        have a 1 in 12 chance of direct solving &gt;the M slice. Furthermore, I
        can solve 3 edges in one face and &gt;inadvertently solve (I can do this
        on purpose more often as I get &gt;better) a few edges in the other
        face. My lucky cases will be very &gt;differnt than someone who uses an
        F2L method. Furthermore, we can &gt;start with the same scramble, and
        one of us will get a lucky case &gt;while the other won't. &gt; &gt;What
        would you do if you got a lucky case, were shocked by it, and
        &gt;therefore flubbed your time? Would you still count it? &gt; &gt;Just
        some thoughts. &gt; &gt;Lucas &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To unsubscribe

        Hi everybody! Did you hear that 3x3 cube behaves similarily to atoms
        with their electrons? The relationships between electrons and their
        "spins" (flips) are also very much dependent on others. From this point
        of view the QTM is, I think, the most natural metric for this, and not
        only this cube. I think QTM should be used averywhere as the base to any
        other metrics and comparisons. In fact since over 20 years I was used to
        that metric and believe me I needed much time to change my habits when I
        first saw another as the base on the internet. Of course every alg is
        different, but do you really want to say, that there is no difference in
        time making R and R2? Are you sure? For those, who are so sure let's
        make a test. All of us know the unofficial record of the maximum number
        of moves made in one minute (876 - Nathan Christie). Can anybody do the
        same number of double moves? Can anybody do 438 at least? The same with
        slice moves. I want to suggest that maybe we should use QTM as the base
        because of its nature and, from practical point of view, time needed for
        making double moves and slices. zz --- In

        Michal and Wojtek Fulmyk for your company. Thanks to you Grazyna didn't
        have to remain silent (she doesn't speek English) and could learn much
        about Toronto and Canada. I want to thank Katsu - we've got a great day

        All valid points, but what about comparing something like R'U (or even
        worst RU) to say R2? I think we all know what would happen if we timed a
        repitition of say 100 of each.... What about certain "fractional
        metrics" from the stand point of computer optimization I have had to
        consider it sometimes. In building the back-end of my database, I played
        around with certain "funny-looking" metrics. For example I made up DTM
        (D for Doug, so if this looks like something someone else already
        thought of please tell me) where something like R2L' is treated as
        length 1 for the purposes of optimization. This is sort of 2 steps
        farter in the direction of STM. (The intermediate of DTM and STM is
        something I found on Jessica's site ATM (A for anti-slice) where R2L' is
        2 and L'R' is one.) So know I count FIVE "integer" metrics. What about
        D[x] for x an element of closed interval [0,1] (an off set of DTM) where
        R2L' is 1.5 turns in D[1/2](for the purposes of optimization)?
        (D[0]==DTM D[1]==HTM) These so-called "fractional metrics" generate a
        lot of nifty counting schemes. Now consider a function (let's keep it
        simple: polynomial) of these things.... What do you (any of you) think
        is the best one? Of course this will probably depend on one's style. I
        thought of this stuff over a year ago... man, where has my life gone.

        horizontal slice is moved left or right. I would think V and A should
        correspond to M and M', respectively, being the "down" or "up" move of
        the other slice that goes through F. Perhaps for the sake of having
        something "point", you could use the ^ symbol (Shift+6), instead of A. M
        and W leave me completely confused, though. I personally prefer the
        lower case notation, using lower case to indicate slices only. A turn of
        the slice between R and L would be r, r', l or l'. I prefer this over
        using single lower case to indicate a slice &amp; face turn, but I
        suppose that's just my personal preference. I suppose one downfall of
        this notation would be what to do when talking about a 5x5x5 cube - it
        works with a 4x4x4, but not anything larger than that. Opinions? - Grant

        Hi - I'm new to the community and many thanks to Chris for letting me
        know it exists. As a first, but hopefully not last, post I'd like to
        congratulate Chris on breaking my ancient world record for one handed
        cube solving. A phenomenal time and I know it can be hard to hold your
        nerve too. Its 20 years since I spent any real time on the cube so it
        seems pretty unlikely I'll be contending to get the record back.
        Nevertheless because Chris kindly took the time and effort to find me
        out and let me know it has rekindled my old interest a little so I hope
        to keep in touch and follow events from here. Its great to see such
        interest in cubing. Things have changed a lot I think since the early
        1980's. Can anyone point me in the direction of the rules you use for
        speed solving, one handed solving and behind the back/blindfold solving
        (we used to distinguish between these - do you?)? Do you get some "look"
        time ahead of solving in the speed events - and how much "look" time do
        you get behind the back? Best wishes to all Duncan

        Seems like a lot of people think it takes too much time. It does if you

        people or so, and if I were to start a cube Clube there, it &gt; would
        have been very successful, because it got to the point when I &gt;
        walked down the halls, LOADS of people had the cube, just playing &gt;
        with it (I guess they heard of 'some guy' solve it in 20 seconds? &gt;

        definately (you have to be cool too though, and Doug, I like the &gt;
        idea of not showing off your sub 25 second solve at first, and to &gt;
        drum up interest, excellent). So now I have 2 years to 're- launch' &gt;
        a cube community at this new school, of which is college prep, and &gt;
        many are too afraid to 'look dumb' or something (the usual &gt;
        reaction), but when you first show people, then other people say "if
        &gt; he can learn it, then I CAN LEARN IT!", so yes, teaching a few &gt;
        people at first, and having them show the audience it is possible is
        &gt; &gt; _very_effective (from what i've seen). Doug: YES, HAVE THE
        &gt; CUBING COMMUNITY GROW!!! I think 1 out of every 10-20 cubers will
        &gt; even be interested in going to a World Championship or tournament,
        &gt; so yeh grow the cubing community ASAP. Mike: I was going to start a

        Welcome! As far as I know, blindfolded and behind the back are the same.
        I don't do blindfolded, though, so I'm not positive. And before speed
        solving, you get 15 seconds to inspect the cube. But for the
        blindfolded, the time starts when you start inspecting the cube, then
        you put the blindfold on while the time is still ticking, and solve it.

        &gt; &gt; Its 20 years since I spent any real time on the cube so it

        think since the early 1980's. Can anyone point me in the &gt; direction
        of the rules you use for speed solving, one handed solving &gt; and
        behind the back/blindfold solving (we used to distinguish &gt; between
        these - do you?)? Do you get some "look" time ahead of &gt; solving in
        the speed events - and how much "look" time do you get &gt; behind the

        I was going to buy an Oddzon cube at Target, but they didn't have one.
        They did have a Milton Bradley one, which I took out of the package to
        try out. That cube straight out of the package was nearly just as good
        as my old one. Needless to say, I bought it. It actually turns faster,
        but it isn't as smooth as my other one. I'm sure it will be perfect once
        it gets broke in a little and I sand it. It's probably about as good as
        an Oddzon, but I've never used an Oddzon so I can't actually compare
        them. Can someone tell me what I should do when the stickers wear off? I
        tried paint on my last one and hated it, then scraped it off a few days
        later. It has tiles on it now, but I don't like the feel of it with
        every square being raised up. So hopefully I can find something I'll
        like for my new cube. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Definitely the best sticker substitute is vinyl tape. I can't find it
        anywhere in my town, but I live in a tiny one. Probably at some Wal*Mart

        What kind of lube was used on the Rubiks Cube's we got at the WC? I
        don't think it was Silicone, because mine is already really stiff.
        Unless it got wet, or something, But as far as I know it wasn't. And are

        #1. Good lube question, not that it really matters since most silicone
        perform about the same. #2. Lube your cube if it's stiff!! #3. We were
        informed by other member that they would not be Studio cubes BEFORE wc
        (read the posts). I wasn't paying close attention to those cubes there,
        but I'd doubt were. Did you find those cube really great? I didn't think
        they were fantastic speedcubes, decent enough to use, but nothing that

        It is a normal Rubik.com cube and not a Rubik's Studio cube (they have
        they have the 1980 logo and strong stickers. I gues they used the
        Rubiks.com lubricant, this lubricant does not work well at low or high
        temperatures only at room temperature. It might be that you stored to
        cube in the sun this will have effect on this kind of lubricant. You
        should clean the cube and lubricate it with silicone spray. I am busy to
        order Studio Cubes and I hope I can offer them to everyone real soon Ton

        Hi everybody. I've been asked to give my oppinion on a Rubik's cube java
        game for mobile phones made by ikkyou. Has any of you tried this cube?
        Anyway I wanted to get some oppinions from you about the button
        configuration. You look at the cube from the corner so you can see two
        sides and the top. The back sides are displayed behind the cube. In the
        game the configuration is like this: You can switch between directions.
        But when you set the arrows to clockwise the sides will turn in the
        direction you see on the screen, not all clockwise according to our
        system. 1 will make turn L' 2 will turn the vertical layer next to it in
        same direction (away from you) 3 will make turn R 4 will make turn U 5
        will turn horizontal layer same direction 6 will make turn D' 7 will
        make turn F 8 will turn the vertical layer next to it in the same
        direction (towards you) 9 will make turn B' *, 0 and # will turn the
        whole cube I think this is a straight forward and categoric way for
        none-cubers to do a notation for a screen cube, but for cubers who have
        a standardized notation I think it's confusing. I have suggested this:
        When you switch between clockwise and counterclocwise, the sides should
        turn the right way according to our notation. The buttons: 1 should turn
        L side 3 should turn B side 7 should turn F side 9 should turn R side 2
        should turn U side 8 should turn D side All (real) clockwise or
        counterclockwise depending on the arrows 4, 5 and 6 should turn
        centerslides (in some order) *, 0 and # should turn the whole cube (as
        it is) What is your oppinion?

        the water pump in my 89 iroc-z camaro died causing the car to overheat
        and the radiator to explode (literally, there is a hole in the side of

        hands, twisting nuts and bolts with my fingers, and generally being a

        needless to say my fingers got a very strenuous workout. i tried cubing
        that evening (yesterday) and basicly found that i had lost nearly all my

        I think the only thing to do is take a few days or a week off from
        cubing. I sometimes do something like that, and my fingers hurt for a

        (maybe 6 days, I can't remember) and the order was perfect. Got a mini
        4x4x4 and a transparent assembly cube (the girlfriend loves it). The

        Yes, I didn't have too great of faith in them either... but my last
        order (a pyraminx and 2x2), came through perfectly, about a week wait. I
        was very satisifed with their 2x2 and am trying to wear it in a bit more
        but had already set a 10.02s average on it a few days after it arrived,
        my first average on a 2x2 nontheless. And the textured pyraminx was
        pretty good also. The silver stickers keep comming off and I've had to
        just about reglue all of them, as they natuarally fall out, though. The
        red felt side doesn't appear to actaully be felt or artificial fur but
        some type of spongy rubber. It turns very well though, but I have yet to
        perfect a good number of finger tricks on it. Green and blue arn't too
        easily decernable though when I'm playing it in the dark (always have to
        use my nails and run through in two orthogonal directions). As with my
        other puzzles I am always interested in how to take them apart incase I
        want to lube individual pieces and set them out to dry before assembly
        or just to learn about a new mechanism. I'm sure the Eastsheen 2x2
        mechanism differs from the regular ones to some degree and am
        curious...., wondering if it'd be possible to incorporate springs into
        the design to pitch an idea to Mefferts for a truly world-class 2x2. I'm
        also hoping there will be an official 2x2x2 competition at the next WC.
        I realize that it is very simple, but then again is the 3x3 compared to
        the 4x4 or 5x5... I bet corners first guys like Ron, David Allan, Gene,
        DanG, and Ga√©tan would ROCK at it aside from of course Akimoto.
        Hemmm...., why in the world did Ga√©tan from Montreal NOT come to WC?
        This would just add a new dimension to the WC experience.... One-handed
        and blindfolded sure did, we can all agree!!! It was reasoned that the
        2x2 was too simple to do as a category or that not enough interest was
        there so I just want to say now, while it is early that I'd love to
        register for it. Of course hopefully by then I'd be into a ton of other
        cube/not-quite-cube related things and be begging the organizers to
        spread the event into more than TWO days. On second thought, much more
        than 2... Just to keep you all updated on my local cube club... I am in
        the process of planning out how to fill a half-hour (was origianlly to
        be an hr) for the mass-meeting, which, due to the amount of publicity I
        have decided to put into it, at least 200 students (maybe a few
        profesors) will show up for. (Hopefully not more since the place I
        reserved won't handle more.) Ok..., introductions should take 5-10
        minutes... but what then? I am new at this type of stuff. I certainly
        can't just keep solving the cube for minutes on end, actually I hope not
        to have to solve it at all. I've prepared a basic method to pass out,
        but too bad not everyone owns a cube :(. But I still need more ideas
        (like a speech). So if anyone has got ideas for me, I'm listening. Oh
        and also, I think you guys will find this funny. I posted over in the
        "exclusive" 4D cube club and had the following response: "What do you
        mean by RWC?" Omg, that just shows how one of them is living in the
        shadows... So faith in Meffert's is comming back slowly. Oh forgot to
        mention the imperfectly centered stickers, but I didn't cae about that
        too much. -Doug Li (Happy Cubing friends...) --- In

        Hello folks, So, after the competition, myself and my grip Mark, have
        been working on solving the cube. We have downloaded, digested and have
        solved the cube using Jessica's method, however, since I have a
        documentary to make, I really don't have the time to memorize all those
        algorthyms. Mark and I were talking, and we decided to try Lar's method.
        Lars, I like the idea a lot, but those Java applets are pretty cool,
        however I am having difficulty in understanding exactly what moves to do
        to get the edges and corners aligned in the last layer. Maybe I just
        need more time in digesting the process. Anyway, I've been scouring the
        websites, and was wondering if someone can send me a link with the
        relatively few algorthyms to solve the cube. Thanks Allan mail@... Ps.
        We should have a trailer up for the doc in about 2-3 weeks time. I'll
        post a note here when we get there.

        Hi, Allan, I am a cube artist specializing in 3d cube art. I was the
        only exhibitor at the WC, but that was not my fault. I would have
        *welcomed* other cube artists. Unfortunately, as I found on the web,
        there are two other sources of cube art, but they are 2d, not 3d. BTW,
        2d means two dimensional, or picture-like structures, and 3d means three
        dimensional, or sculpture-like structures. As you might expect, 3d cube
        art is considerably more dificult than 2d cube art. I do not wish to put
        down people doing 2d art. Some of their work is really beautiful.
        Bowever, if you want to go 3d, you have to understand conceps that go
        beyond cubing. I am talking about parity pairs and parity-pair induced
        design symmetries. And of course you must solve the Rubik's cube
        completely. I knew it was going to be hard to present those designs. But
        I never imagined that I was going rto be so alone, that there would be
        no one costructing those designs. Yet that is exactly what happened in
        Toronto. Difficult as it is, I am forced to come to a conclusion, that
        at present I am the only person in the world who does 3d cube art. Did
        you take a snapshot of those designs? Do you think you can include them
        in the documentary? Then perhaps somebody can see trhem and tell me of
        others who are doing 3d designs. Thank you very much. Hana M. Bizek ---

        cube using Jessica's &gt; method, however, since I have a documentary to
        make, I really don't &gt; have the time to memorize all those
        algorthyms. &gt; &gt; Mark and I were talking, and we decided to try
        Lar's method. &gt; &gt; Lars, I like the idea a lot, but those Java
        applets are pretty cool, &gt; however I am having difficulty in
        understanding exactly what moves to &gt; do to get the edges and corners
        aligned in the last layer. Maybe I &gt; just need more time in digesting
        the process. &gt; &gt; Anyway, I've been scouring the websites, and was
        wondering if someone &gt; can send me a link with the relatively few
        algorthyms to solve the &gt; cube. &gt; &gt; Thanks &gt; &gt; Allan &gt;
        &gt; mail@a... &gt; &gt; Ps. We should have a trailer up for the doc in

        i was turning a mid-left layer by itsself when the cubie i was pushing
        on just popped out and a center piece too. i dunno if you've seen the
        center pieces to the 4x4x4 but they have little stems coming down that
        fit into the grooves of the mechanism. well the little stem broke off. i
        super glued it and got the cube back together after about an hour of
        workin on it. then the next day the same thing happened and a completely
        different center piece broke. Should i get one from a different company

        The same exact thing happened to me although I had the cube for about a
        week. The center pieces are really fragile. I tried gluing it twice with
        the strongest epoxy I had but it just broke a few moves after I put it
        back in my cube. Rubik's does warn that they break easy and sells
        replacements. I think it comes with 2 of every type of piece and a set
        of stickers. I don't want to spend money on that right now. Maybe we
        should just get a Meffert's 4x4. They consensus is that are good. Are
        they much more durable than Rubik's brand? --barefoot Chris --- In

        I had a 4x4x4 from mefferts from about a year ago, before they sold the
        mini's. It broke in exactly the same manner as you described. It worked
        really well after regluing once or twice, but after I think 4 different
        center pieces broke, the glue just wouldn't do it any more. I bought a

        jelly on it a _long_ time ago, and it does rattle a bit. Whatever
        plastic they used must have been pretty decent. One of the blue stickers
        said "Made in Hong Kong". On the other hand I didn't work it as much as
        a 3x3x3 cube, but all things considered the Ideal Toy manufacturing was
        excellent. To this day I still use Rubik's Game cubes (old-new stock).

        There are a few types of 4x4x4 type differ in Plastic The inventor is
        from Peter Sebesteny, this is the 4x4x4 with the ball kernel There is
        The Rubik's Revenge USA 1982 (Ideal US) The Rubik's Revenge UK 1982
        (Ideal UK) The Rubik's Master Germany 1982 The Rubik's.com 2002 Meffer
        4x4x4 And there the Eastheen 4x4x4 with a total different mechanisme As
        for the 4x4x4 ball type kernel , the centers is for all types very
        fragile. You should lubricate the Rubik's.com 4x4x4 before use else the
        change that you will brake a center piece is bigger. Try not to
        disassemble a new 4x4x4, you probably will damage a center piece. Wait
        until it becomes a bit lose (only the 1982 have a center that can be
        removed with a screw). An Eastheen cube does not have parts that are
        fragile while speedcubing and are easy to disassemble I am still testing
        what 4x4x4 is the best for speedcubing, my current evaluation is that
        for me first the colors of the stickers is the most important and
        secondly the smoothness of the cube. Because the stickers of the Rubik's
        1982 versions cube are very bright and stong (they do not wear), this is
        my current number 1. I will also try an Eastheen after I resticker them
        with bright colors, the orginal sticker are of poor quality. Ton --- In

        When I wrote my book, I said that the reason I used no 4x4x4 in my
        designs was its unavailabilityand high expense, but ainly its fragility.
        That was certainly true in those days. Nowadays it is available online
        at rubiks.com and Mefferts, but is still quite expensive and fragile, as
        this iscuzsion shows. My special problem is parity pairs, but with
        stickrs available at rubiks.com, that is no longer a problem. Did anyone
        else, besides Ron, Jessica, Ton and Sandy, tke oyctures of my designs?
        Would you consider putting them on the web? Thank you. (Just the

        2) Make sure the cube is worked in and well lubed before doing much
        speedcubing. 3) Don't do slice moves - If you need to do a slice, move
        the slice with the adjacent face, and then move the face back. I believe
        Masayuki's does slices this way, and his approach uses slices fairly
        extensively, but he was still fast enough with it to win both the 4x4
        and 5x5 events at the WC. He (or anyone else) can correct me if I'm

        comparing something like R'U (or &gt; even worst RU) to say R2? I think
        we all know what would happen if &gt; we timed a repitition of say 100
        of each.... Well if we're trying to model how fast a sequence can be
        done with our turn metric, we need to introduce context---the moves
        surrounding that move. Otherwise simply saying a half-twist takes longer
        than a quarter-twist doesn't help much. What we need is a model of how
        the cube is held and where the fingers are at various points---and of
        course this is all solver-dependent. Which is why I like and still use
        HTM; it's the original metric (at least, the first one I saw) and the
        simplest. QTM has some nice theoretical properties, but to me F+F+ is
        unnatural; we think of it as F2. (The same argument could be made for
        the slices, but I think it's not as strong an argument there.) So yes,
        it would be interesting to try to do a quick improvement of the metric
        somehow, maybe by starting with HTM, and then adding some fractional
        "shortcuts" (for instance, any sequence of two moves that can be done as
        a "fingertrick" counts as only 1.5 moves; any sequence of three moves
        that can be done as a "fingertrick" counts two) or something like that,
        and use this to help improve the usefulness of the metric for
        speedsolvers.

        had success in gluing center pieces together to fix such cubes, just

        I have my Rubik's Master cube for 20 years, I broke one center on it. On
        the new Rubik's.com cube I broke 4 centers, you can prevent this not to
        speedcube on a new cube, break it for in for a while and lubricate it.
        Only after it is a bit lose and lubricated centers break will be minimal
        during speedcubing. The ball type kernel Meffert/Rubiks you can exchange
        the centers they will fit. Since my 4x4x4 are lubriacted after proper
        break it in when new, I did not have any center breaks. Do not try to
        disassembkle a new 4x4x4 cube, this is probably when you damage a center
        (I did!). I have learn my lesson only disasseble after proper break, it
        will become a bit lose and the edges can be removed easy, never froce an
        edge out! Ton --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, d_funny007

        &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        broke. i was turning a mid-left layer by itsself when the &gt; &gt;
        cubie &gt; &gt; &gt; i &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was pushing on just
        popped out and a center piece too. i &gt; &gt; dunno &gt; &gt; &gt; if
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you've seen the center pieces to the 4x4x4
        but they have &gt; &gt; little &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stems
        coming down that fit into the grooves of the &gt; &gt; mechanism. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; well &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the little stem broke
        off. i super glued it and got the &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; back &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together after about an hour of workin on it.
        then the &gt; next &gt; &gt; day &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same thing happened and a completely different
        center &gt; piece &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; broke. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Should i get one from a different company or what? or try &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; &gt; get &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubiks.com to get me a
        new one? I mean this really sucks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ADAM

        Hi everyone- So I finally figured out how to finish the dang Rubik's
        Cube. But I want more. I want to be able to solve it really really fast.
        I do it in some steps... I do the top layer, and match the faces, then
        I'll finish the middle layer, then I make a cross on the bottom layer
        and do the corners. With less than a week of trying to go fast, I'm at
        3:30. What are some tips/other methods you can give me to go faster?
        Also, how do you read algorithms? Thanks!

        well you really should provide more info for proper guidance. are you
        looking to solve in under 30 seconds? or just get to under a minute?
        there are lots of web sites with algorithms and finger tricks if you do
        a search. even for a corners-first method, which sounds similar to what
        you're doing. in my opinion, the best off-the-shelf solution that
        requires very little custom algorithm design is the fridrich method,
        which differs from what you're doing, so you'd have to start over again
        learning algs. but that's not necessary if you don't want to get sub

        (Almost) All methods should do for sub 1 - min. I use an ordinary sucky
        layers-first system that takes over 100 moves on average and average 45
        secs. So if sub 1 min is your first goal, you could just practice your
        current method. Lube up your cube and start turning. Remember that
        looking ahead does MUCH more for your times than fast finger movement.

        Last year I bought a 4^3 from Meffert's. I think it's like old cubes,
        built around a ball with screws. I'm only celebrating its first
        birthday, but it really does not look fragile. Silicon grease (not oil)
        seems fine for that kind of heavy cube. A few flying edges while
        speedcubing, because my method uses too much slice moves :-) Meffert's
        only sells Eastsheen cubes now. --- In

        SOme of you may remember about similar posts i did a while back on cube
        related dreams. I have have more bizare ones to share and was wondering
        if anyone else has nights plagued with cube dreams. One of my funnier
        dreams ( i can laugh now) was a nightmare i had. I remember walking up
        to a candy maching, the big box thing with the spirals that push out a
        candy bar or a bag of chips or something, but this one was filled up
        with cubes. Not just 3x3s, but 4x4s 5x5s 6x6x, megaminxs, skewbs,
        dogics, pyraminx, etc all for a $1. I reach into my pocket and pull out
        one dollar. I'm going for a dogic hehehe put the dollar into the machine
        and the dollar spits back out. I try it again and the stupid machine
        wouldn't take my money!!! Another one i had started on a beach. I was
        laying in the sun just relaxing the day away, and the cabana lady who
        usually carries drinks to all the sun bathers brought be cube after
        cube. It was one of my best dreams ever. Just last night i had a dream
        and came up with my own method. I'm going to work on it and see if it is
        anything good. So far it is. And it is very similar to other methods out
        there but i will try and get somewhere with it first before i post it.
        Just thought i'd share a bit of cubing insanity with all of you. Itd be
        cool to hear about other cube dreams people have. Thanks much Jake

        LOL, VERY funny post!!! I used to have these types of dreams, not nearly
        as bizare though. I can cube in my dreames, like visualize the cube and
        generate perfectly random cases in each step, and I think I'm moving my
        hands the right way to solve it.... and it all looks pretty much the
        same as when I'm actually cubing, cuz I've seen myself do it so many
        times that I know what it should look like in my sleep, hehe. Don't be
        afraid to share guys.... I'm sure none of us here are psychologists.
        Then again it doesn't take one to tell us were obsessed with the cube.
        Actaully recently, my dreams have been all math oriented and
        frustrating. Like "Why can't I assume these stupid eigenvalues are all
        not equal to zero and then.... linearly independent, therefore....but
        what if it's infinite-dimensional....etc." And I just frustrate myself
        with these sort of things all night. (I'm sure close to 1/3 of you are
        math people that went through this kinda stuff back in college, so I
        just thought I'd share....) Ya those are pretty cool ones you got, Jake.
        And being ispired by them to develop a method is astonishing. -Doug ---

        trivializing the skill of sub-20 cubists and what it takes to get
        there!!! Like "oh ya I could get sub-20, just don't want to right now,"
        which is preposterous and an insult to some of us. That's probably not
        what you meant, but it's an underlying aspect of how you worded it.
        Sub-30 would have been cool, since a lot of practice can get a person
        there.... but for sub-20 it's a lot more complicated: It takes *TONS* of
        hard-work, months of practice (I'd say years, but that has been refuted
        by a few cubists), hardcore dedication, and a long list of other stuff.
        So don't just be like "get sub-20" without showing a little respect and
        proper connotation. I'm not quite there yet, but I know the journey to
        be long and rigorous. You speak of it like it's nothing. -Doug

        i currently use a method where i get 4 corners on one side then 4 on the
        opposite side then match the other corners up fill in the 2 sides then
        do the middle. when i learned how to do it i did not memorize all the
        moves but i am about a sub 40 now. i would like to know if anybody knew
        of good sites with moves for this method. would like to get my average
        down and am sure i could do it if i would have learned all the moves. i
        am using a rubiks.com rubiks cube it is pretty loose and lubed with

        Thanks much. It is so funny, i was talking with my friend today about my
        "dream method" and he said that I need some serious counsling. Haha
        perhaps so but I'm having fun. You aren't truly obsessed untill you

        I've had cube dreams before, but for some reason I can never remember
        exactly what happens in my dreams. I think my dreams finish several
        hours before I wake up, so I just remember something happening and I
        remember generally the plot of the dream. But I can never remember the
        whole thing. That's weird. I think you got a message from God, he told
        you of the best method that is so far unknown. One time I got a message
        from God while I was unicycling. It was pretty cool. --- In

        I just wanted to suggest instead of "if you don't want to get sub-20" to
        read "unless you are trying to get sub-20" or "unless you will be trying
        to get sub-20" This difference is subtle. The first places emphasis on
        'desire,' the second emphasizes 'effort.' You don't always get what you
        WANT, but you can always TRY. When I read your post it just seemed
        weird, like did you choose the number 20 because it is like the supreme
        goal just to exaggerate it (what advanced systems can do for a person)
        OR that as you were typing it you had some kind of subconscious
        trivialization of what it takes to become sub-20 because there are so
        many sub-20 cubists out there now??? You could have choose something
        more reasonable like sub-30 or sub-40. That is all. -Doug (not really

        until i quit running to get a job instead. But i was trying to get ppl
        to donate money to get me a 5x5x5 cube. The coach said he'd give me
        money if i could solve my 3x3x3 in under a minute. I had to do it in
        front of the whole team which was like 50 ppl. i go to a big school.
        They were all pretty into it and thought it was cool. I did it under a

        many people use vinyl tape to help this problem. you can buy a roll of
        each colour, sissors, and youll be set for life. you can also paint your
        cube, athough it might look really bad the first time (same w/ the
        stickers, but prob. worse) and peel or chip off. i usually blend these
        together and apply clear nailpolish to the cube after ive put stickers
        on it. this makes the stickers last a bit longer. the sticker kits for
        rubiks.com are pretty expensive to my standards, and i dont know wheter
        they have good stickers in stock or not--they vary a lot. i think you
        can buy "professional stickers" from them, but they havent responded to
        my email about a different subject, so i dont know if they would respond
        to you. i also cube at lunch on the occaision that i am really bored and
        have my cube at school, although i might start to cube a lot at a
        computer for the pursuit of science. The stickers' residue might be
        tough to get off since theyve been on there for a long time. I peeled
        off my stickers as soon as the clear tape annoyed me. gl w/ the cube!

        this cube dream thread is the perfect intro to what i was going to post
        tonight. the other night i went to sleep with my cube on the table
        beside my bed (why didn't you sleep in the bed?....nevermind), and i
        left the cube unsolved. i've posted before asking how people leave their
        cubes, and i know i left mine unsolved because of this "thing" i
        do...depending on how i felt the day went, is how i leave it...hectic
        days = unsolved cube. we all have our quirks. anyway, when i woke up,
        the cube was solved. now i know my dog didn't do it, and my wife has
        ZERO interest in "the damn thing", so i know she didn't do it. so my
        only explanation is that i did it at some point during the night. i do
        have a history of sleep-activity (walking, talking, writing, etc) so
        it's not out of the question. sadly, there's no way of knowing how long
        it took...or else i'd post it on the speedcubing.com records ;-) anyone
        else ever done this? MTP

        Ha, I like Jake's reply. I usually have at least one cube in bed with me
        every night, or set it on the nightstand if its corners start poking me
        too much. And I also have that quirk, except the it has to do with how I
        hope my next day will be: refine or carefree. Performing a single
        algorithm over and over after lights out is another thing I like to
        do.... When ever I'm having trouble with a particular algorithm I just
        do it over and over in bed, usually &gt;400 iterations to get the full
        effect... So it is quite frequent that I fall asleep cubing or start to
        cube in my sleep since it's still in my hands (sleep-walking -&gt;
        sleep-cubing :)). It annoys the heck out of my roommates.... Good thing
        this year I live in a single. Anyways I should be working on my hw. This
        fourm is the easiest way for my to procrastinate (I hide my cubes from
        myself while doing hw, lol). The reason why I've been posting a lot
        lately is to motivate you guys to post, to strike up some controversy
        also. The posts here have now become very infrequent for some reason. I
        think it's because school hs started for everyone by now. I have TONS of
        interesting topics I could post on, but don't care to monopolize the
        board. I mean common, with all the interesting stuff that has gone on
        lately... Someone should have posted on Frank's tv interview and
        newspaper article, we had DanK on a national talk show, and a few other
        things... I think people are just not motivated enough to post. Perhaps
        something can be done about that. Hem... let me do some more motivatin'.
        Does anyone other there want a copy of the MOD tv show featuring
        Hardwick and Wesley? I have a copy, just need to level the audio
        properly... I have some backstage clips too. I'll get my picture of a
        signed 4x4 by Jessica, she took up every square, notice that here name
        has 4^2 letters. Um... I think I have some cool clips of on the spot
        cubing done by several of the wc competitors that I recorded at Toronto,
        I'd post those if the respective parties will allow. Ya...., most of
        this I should append to my web site and finally update it (it hasn't
        been for 7 weeks now, so it's still at the under-construction/new
        phase). I mean common, a piece of the podium!!! I know someone is gona
        want to see a picture of this (refering to those that didn't go to wc),
        it's signed by all the competitors minus a few. Ya, a few more cool
        things I'll keep secret for now.... -Doug (Happy Cubing, all) --- In

        Hey, Just a hint to get a little more speed out of your solve. I found
        this on post 6701. But, if you solve all but one corner on the first
        layer, using that empty corner it becomes really easy to place the
        middle 4 edges. This requires about 4 moves instead of 8. then place the
        last corner. Fox

        metrics about which we are all talking about: 1. metrics that estimates
        the time of solving the cube, suppose 1.5 moves for F2. 2. metrics that
        says nothing about the time we need to make the algorithm, only prepares
        a kind of theoretical base. &gt; Which is why I like and still use HTM;
        it's the original metric (at &gt; least, the first one I saw) and the
        simplest. QTM has some nice &gt; theoretical properties, but to me F+F+
        is unnatural; we think of it as &gt; F2. (The same argument could be
        made for the slices, but I think it's &gt; not as strong an argument
        there.) Nobody of us wants to write on paper F+F+ or FF instead of F2! I
        suggested earlier to count F2 as 2 moves. For example the alg RUR'URU2R'
        should be counted as 8 moves, not 7 (or 7.5). If you think differently
        then tell me what means "2" in "F2"? I can tell you: "TWO QUATTER
        MOVES"! &gt; &gt; So yes, it would be interesting to try to do a quick
        improvement of &gt; the metric somehow, maybe by starting with HTM, and
        then adding some &gt; fractional "shortcuts" (for instance, any sequence
        of two moves that &gt; can be done as a "fingertrick" counts as only 1.5
        moves; any sequence &gt; of three moves that can be done as a
        "fingertrick" counts two) or &gt; something like that, and use this to
        help improve the usefulness of &gt; the metric for speedsolvers. Talking
        about the metrics, which could tell us how much time we need on average
        to solve an alg, I think it may turn out just impossible! What about
        right- and left-hand persons? What about smaller and bigger hands and
        fingers? What about personal predispositions? I am afraid everyone of us
        must make his/her choice of alg. zz

        Right, I wouldn't go for the Fridrich method. I don't even use the
        Fridrich method regularly. I'm sure each of us can devise of easy to
        understand beginner methods, of course I know that this can be relative
        to the person learning it. I know enough of a variety of methods to
        teach people at the beginner to intermediate levels...., and know where
        to tell the advanced cubers where to go find what they need for their
        method. I think I would teach something that is overlaps a lot with
        mainstream.... start them on the cross. Even though I don't start off
        with a cross all the time, I have found it a good mental exercise to
        always do it 7 moves or less HTM there oare only 108 cases absolutely
        requiring more 8 turns btw. And then there are a variety of ways to do
        the c/e slots, I'd usually teach them to do corners first, all 4 (I know
        3 might be a good idea, but this forces them to repetitively use and
        thus memorize a simple second layer edge insertion alg.). Or instead of
        starting out with cross, they can start out with and X, their is a
        simple first layer edge insertion alg, that I think is pretty simple and
        easy to learn. Either way, I definately don't want them to think that
        the Fridrich is the ONLY way to get fast, like it's some standard or
        something. I think beginners should be a little creative about it. Cuz
        once they get on the net and search around that's mostly what they'll
        see. Not that I'm saying that there's anything wrong with this popular
        method of course. And for the LL, I'd teach one of two algs to Permute
        corners, the Sune to orientate them, and soemthing simple to flip edges,
        and then the basic 3-cycle of edges (in that order). Once they get the
        hang of it (people can easily break 1 minute with just this method) then
        I can show them some PLL's, namely the T and Y Perm and they can switch
        over to this different 4 look system, similar to the intent of DanK's
        basic method (on his video). Then there are only 8 PLLs to go (figuring
        in that they'd stumble on to brute-force Z-Perm and H/+ Perm on their
        own like meany of us did). Thus we have a 3 look LL system good enough
        for many cubist. Then it is of course c/e pairing game time... and we
        all know how that goes. Actaully, I refute what you said "the fridrich
        method isnt the easiest one to explain, especially the F2L", that is
        actually not true. It really does depend on the person, but in general
        it is that the LL step of it is the hardest to explain NOT the F2L.
        Normally people are baffled at making the LL all one color then
        permuting it all while maintaining the orientation.... I know I was when
        I first heard of it. -Doug --- In

        I like to teach three edges of bottom layer, corners of bottom layer,
        position corners of top layer, orient corners of top layer, place edges
        of top layer using "keyhole", place keyhole edge, place and orient edges
        of equator. The reason for this, is that it requires learning the four
        "algs" for placing a corner: RUR', RU'R' and F'UF F'U'F which can then
        be used for placing the top corners, positioning the bottom corners and
        orienting the bottom corners. Then it's one easy sequence to place the
        four following edges, another similar one for the last edge. And then
        you just need the easy permute 3 edges on the equator alg and something
        to do the orienting. (I like using techniques for orienting which
        consist of: do a move which orients one piece but preserves the layer
        containing the two pieces to be oriented - replace the oriented piece
        with the yet-to-be oriented piece - reverse the move) Greg &gt; --- In

        because they know nothing of notation, nothing of the Cube (and i mean
        nothing). i show them this.... 1) top corners, (2) top edges, (3) middle
        edges (4) orienting bottom corners (5) placing bottom corners (6)
        orienting bottom edges (7) solving bottom edges Very easy of course, and
        some of it is so not necessary, but just get total beginners, this is
        quite as easy as possible, and yes, with great success (im currently in

        solves that morning and then some solves yestarday. I decided to do a
        time solve, and my first one was under a minute with no lucky steps. It
        was 54 seconds. So already I'm seeing some results. I'm hoping to get it

        For a while, my webpage has had no real good explanation of how I do
        edge orientation. In reality, steps 1 and 2 are done together, in that
        by the time I finish step 1, I try to have step 2 finished also. This
        simply involves looking ahead, but you cannot do it without knowing
        extensively which different paths you can take. I plan to write more
        about this. But for now, I have rewritten the standard step 2 page to
        "explain" how edge orientation works:
        http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step2.html In the future, I
        plan to write two more pages: 1. looking ahead as you approach step 2.
        2. orienting edges while building the last square of step 1. Question:
        an alternative to steps 2 to 4 is to insert the last F2L pair, then do a
        two step last layer. I have not really reduced the number of looks here.
        So is my system no faster than existing systems? Well, there are a
        number of interesting points about step 2: 1. it is incredibly quick
        compared to inserting the last F2L pair. 2. it has instant recognition
        time. 3. the average algorithm size is 5.71 which turns out to be
        optimal for performing the step with just two finger trick macros. 4.
        step 2 can often be skipped or significantly shortened. You could say
        that step 2 is such a short extension of step 1 that it is not really a
        separate look. Ryan

        Brent brings up a great point! I have also taught a few people and
        lately I've been working on teaching my 7th grade discovery class. I've
        found the key to really teaching people is making it, as Brent put it
        "E.A.S.Y...A.S...P.O.S.S.I.B.L.E." To add to that a little bit, I have
        found some simple key words, phrases and ideas that are rather
        elementary and easy for beginners to remember. Just to give you an
        example, when teaching the LL Edges I explain to them that the first
        thing to remember about ALL the bottom edge moves is that the very first
        move will be Middle Down. Emphasizing this idea to them is important
        because it helps simply all of my LL edge moves. An example on how I
        would teach one of the LL Edge moves: To remember "basic edge move" just
        think "1, 2, 1" What this means is that you go middle down, right once
        (1), middle up, right twice (2), middle down, right once (1) and then
        the move is complete. But instead of remember all of those words, I
        simplified it to "1,2,1" The number of times they need to move right
        because they can easily remember to alternate middle down then middle
        up. So another LL Edge move would be "Snake eyes" "3 left, 2 right, then
        basic edge from the correct side" And once they see how it works they
        will shorten that to "3, 2" I know this way of teaching may sound a bit
        complicated and I think I made it sound more confusing than it really
        is, but it has worked, and worked well at that! If you are interested in
        knowing how I explain any of my other moves to people feel free to send
        me an email, I'd be more than happy to reply. Justin Vining viningjc@...

        I like to start off by showing them that they need to memorize only four
        algorithms. I show them what the algorithms are, and they see how simple
        it actually is. Then once they learn that method, you can usually tell
        if they're one who wants to become a speedcuber, at which point you
        could teach them a faster method. Most people, though, just want to be
        able to solve it. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Brent

        I've taught two people your method, and one of those people taught
        another one. I think the problem is it's fairly hard to understand if
        it's someone who has never dealed with the cube before. But I agree that
        it is easier to show someone in person. But I think that an easy option
        would be to teach the person a layer by layer method at first, with the
        cross on top and everything, then if they want to learn a faster method
        you could teach them to pair the corner with the edge before they put it
        there (Fridrich method). But there are some people who want to learn a
        fast method from the start, in which case you should teach them

      <div class="email-content">
        At my high school I taught quite a lot of people how to solve the cube
        and I learned a couple things about it. First and foremost most people
        tend to not like the concept of an algorithm, they like to understand
        what they're doing to the cube and also most people I've found don't
        like memorizing algorithms either. I also agree that in teaching
        beginners you should teach a method that is as easy as possible. The
        method I teach to people who want to learn is the second solution on
        Mark Jeay's solution page. The reason for this is that you can teach it
        in one session and it requires no algorithm learning for the person
        you're teaching. I teach this method like so, 1) solve cross onto bottom
        face 2) insert 3 corners of the bottom layer 3) insert 3 middle layer
        edges using the empty corner slot - this leaves the F2L solved except
        for one corner edge pair. 4) orient and place three edges of the top
        layer using the empty F2L slot 5) orient and place middle layer edge and
        final LL edge using an algorithm - There are only 3 cases for this step,
        and I've found that if I explain exactly what the algorithms do for each
        case, rather than rattle off moves "do R U2 L, etc." then most people
        don't treat this step like a step that uses algs. 6) position remaining
        corners using the still empty corner slot. 7) rotate corners - this step
        could be taught by telling them an alg but I usually show people how
        they can take the corner out of the top layer and put it back in
        correctly, then do the same to another corner only using the original
        move backwards and it fixes the cube. So most people don't consider this
        an alg either. The problem with this method is that it doesn't extend
        easily into faster methods, the person has to ditch everything after the
        cross if they want to learn Fridrich for example. The plus side of
        teaching this way though is that you can do it all in one session and
        that people understand what they're doing to the cube and are less
        likely to forget an alg for a step and be unable to continue until they
        can ask you again for the alg. My two cents, Chris --- In

        1st post Better late than never! just like too say it was really nice
        meeting all of you at wc3 never met such nice people and been impressed
        with so much skill in my life for the record I was the crazy guy in the
        black rubiks cube shirt with the red montreal hat who asked everyone too
        sign his shirt. i wish i had visited here more often,I would have known
        who was who before hand. LIke talking too a guy at sign up named Andy
        camann. only too come back home too realize who he was. some Fav
        moments: Ron von Bruchem in 1st round going super slow on purpose, never
        laughed so hard Dan knights massive jacket being filmed with my friend
        for CUbers (hope i make the cut!) FREE GIFTS!!! FREE CUBES! (gave away
        all my 3x3x3 too kids who want too learn) meeting dan knights, ron von
        bruchem, jessica Fridrich, Jess bonde, Katsu, lars petrus and dan harris
        . learned so much from there sites thanks!! seeing Cube doctor TOn and
        his amazing designed cubes FREE FOOD! dan harris's crazy impersnations
        Worst moments : not sleeping for nearly 24hours super exploding cube
        forgetting a Pll I've known for months and running around asking people
        where jess bonde was so i can remember what the finger tricks were again
        getting too the 1st round late on the 2nd day and hearing my name called
        almost imediatly not having solved a cube that day having too leave
        early too catch the bus back post wc2 After seeing other cubers cubes
        and styles I relearned f2l with both hands mirrored and reversed and
        with the cross on the left side. which helped me get sub 20 more often
        f2l is really the key... then lost motivation too go any faster and
        started focusing on one handed cubing and trying too figure out blind
        folding cubing and 5x5x5 are a nightmare ahhh! i'll try and get my wc3
        pics up sometime this week

        difficult to extend this to Fridrich. They will probably have figured
        out that there are two 3 move algorithms for inserting a corner (with
        the LL on the bottom): 1. R U' R' 2. R U R' Remind them of that, and
        then show them that there are two 3 move algorithms for inserting an
        edge: 1. R U' R' 2. R U R' They will probably not be aware of the second
        one. But once they understand that these are the same algorithms,
        demonstrate inserting a corner and edge simultaneously with each
        algorithm. All they need to learn is how to get the corner and edge
        pieces "aligned" first, and then apply algorithm 2. (Yes, the initial
        part of the explanation is just a trick to make them think "Ah, I see! I
        think I can do that!" rather than "Hmm.. it looks too hard", but it
        works.) Also, I think steps 4 to 7 can be easily extended for speed. My
        speedcubing system is almost a direct extension: 4) orient the top layer
        edges and place the middle layer edge using the empty F2L slot 5) insert
        the last corner while placing the last layer edges 6) orient and permute
        (simultaneously) the 4 remaining corners Ryan

        Great job man! Your site is layed out very well and the organization of
        algorithms makes perfect sense, better then how on some sites people
        just number them randomly. The stuff you show on your step 1 and step 2
        are very helpful to my method.... I'm just taking the time to digest
        everything properly. I'm sure you put a lot of hard work into it, thank
        you very much. Curious though, are you a speedcuber? Have you
        demonstrated this method to be a viable speedsolving method? What times
        do you get using it? I sometimes do solves using your method, I come
        across one fo the few step 4 algs I don't know and have to revert back
        to what I normally do and then finish with a 3-cycle, H/+ Perm, or Z
        Perm. I'd just like you to know that 'somebody' is practicing your
        method a bit. I'm getting good results, and your right all 4 of your
        points are valid on your step 2. Recognition time is great in steps 2
        and 3. The method does indeed make for very few moves compared to others
        out there. I can get sub-30 no problem with it, so I suppose this would
        help to validate your method...?? It does overlap with my method
        significantly, I tend to call mine a Lar's Variant but it is actually
        closer to yours then I care to admit to myself. I'm not TOO much of a
        fan of early Edge Permutation, but it is sometimes worth it since many
        of my CLLs preserve such things. If posssible I still tend to side with
        doing a ZZ manuever to c/e pair it up properly. And as always flipping
        edges when there's nothing better to do is a good suggestion. -Doug ---

        you approach step 2. &gt; 2. orienting edges while building the last
        square of step 1. &gt; &gt; Question: an alternative to steps 2 to 4 is
        to insert the last F2L pair, &gt; then do a two step last layer. I have
        not really reduced the number of &gt; looks here. So is my system no
        faster than existing systems? Well, there &gt; are a number of
        interesting points about step 2: &gt; &gt; 1. it is incredibly quick
        compared to inserting the last F2L pair. &gt; 2. it has instant
        recognition time. &gt; 3. the average algorithm size is 5.71 which turns
        out to be optimal for &gt; performing the step with just two finger
        trick macros. &gt; 4. step 2 can often be skipped or significantly
        shortened. &gt; &gt; You could say that step 2 is such a short extension
        of step 1 that it is &gt; not really a separate look. &gt; &gt; Ryan

        learned so much from there sites &gt; thanks!! &gt; seeing Cube doctor
        TOn and his amazing designed cubes &gt; FREE FOOD! &gt; dan harris's
        crazy impersnations &gt; &gt; Worst moments : &gt; not sleeping for
        nearly 24hours &gt; super exploding cube &gt; forgetting a Pll I've
        known for months and running around asking &gt; people where jess bonde
        was so i can remember what the finger tricks &gt; were again &gt;
        getting too the 1st round late on the 2nd day and hearing my name &gt;
        called almost imediatly not having solved a cube that day &gt; having
        too leave early too catch the bus back &gt; &gt; &gt; post wc2 &gt;
        After seeing other cubers cubes and styles I relearned f2l with both
        &gt; hands mirrored and reversed and with the cross on the left side.
        &gt; which helped me get sub 20 more often f2l is really the key... &gt;
        then lost motivation too go any faster and started focusing on one &gt;
        handed cubing and trying too figure out blind folding cubing and &gt;
        5x5x5 are a nightmare ahhh! &gt; &gt; i'll try and get my wc3 pics up
        sometime this week

        Hi Justin, I think that's an excellent way of going about it. When they
        grasp that "1,2,1" you have a good opportuninty to introduce the concept
        of the algorithm. The first time someone explained algorithm to me they
        had it wrong. People here refer to algs often, but does everyone
        understand that an alogithm is a sequence that when repeated a certain
        number of times times returns to the beginning. You can show your
        friends that repeating the "1,2,1" sequence three times from a solved
        cube resuts in a solved cube. Regards, David J --- In

        also taught a few people and lately I've been working on teaching my 7th
        grade discovery class. I've found the key to really teaching people is
        making it, as Brent put it "E.A.S.Y...A.S...P.O.S.S.I.B.L.E." To add to
        that a little bit, I have found some simple key words, phrases and ideas
        that are rather elementary and easy for beginners to remember. &gt; &gt;
        Just to give you an example, when teaching the LL Edges I explain to
        them that the first thing to remember about ALL the bottom edge moves is
        that the very first move will be Middle Down. Emphasizing this idea to
        them is important because it helps simply all of my LL edge moves. &gt;
        &gt; An example on how I would teach one of the LL Edge moves: &gt; To
        remember "basic edge move" just think "1, 2, 1" &gt; What this means is
        that you go middle down, right once (1), middle up, right twice (2),
        middle down, right once (1) and then the move is complete. But instead
        of remember all of those words, I simplified it to "1,2,1" The number of
        times they need to move right because they can easily remember to
        alternate middle down then middle up. So another LL Edge move would be
        "Snake eyes" "3 left, 2 right, then basic edge from the correct side"
        And once they see how it works they will shorten that to "3, 2" &gt;
        &gt; I know this way of teaching may sound a bit complicated and I think
        I made it sound more confusing than it really is, but it has worked, and
        worked well at that! &gt; &gt; If you are interested in knowing how I
        explain any of my other moves to people feel free to send me an email,
        I'd be more than happy to reply. &gt; &gt; Justin Vining &gt;

        This is the method I have always used (for the last 20 years!) - with a
        few little tricks here and there I guess but mostly thats just being
        aware and cutting corners while you are solving. I used to solve in
        about 30 secs average which isn't too slow although not fast by modern
        standards. More to the point its this algorithm I used to break the
        one-handed record back then. I guess all this discussion about
        algorithms is making me realise that I ought to try to improve my
        algorithm if I'm ever going to get back to the sort of level you guys
        solve at (especially one-handed). I can see that Chris is not going to

        that it doesn't extend easily into &gt; &gt; faster methods, the person
        has to ditch everything after the cross &gt; &gt; if they want to learn
        Fridrich for example. &gt; &gt; I taught a few people recently, and
        found it is not really too difficult &gt; to extend this to Fridrich.
        They will probably have figured out that &gt; there are two 3 move
        algorithms for inserting a corner (with the LL on &gt; the bottom): &gt;
        &gt; 1. R U' R' &gt; 2. R U R' &gt; &gt; Remind them of that, and then
        show them that there are two 3 move &gt; algorithms for inserting an
        edge: &gt; &gt; 1. R U' R' &gt; 2. R U R' &gt; &gt; They will probably
        not be aware of the second one. But once they &gt; understand that these
        are the same algorithms, demonstrate inserting a &gt; corner and edge
        simultaneously with each algorithm. All they need to &gt; learn is how
        to get the corner and edge pieces "aligned" first, and then &gt; apply
        algorithm 2. (Yes, the initial part of the explanation is just a &gt;
        trick to make them think "Ah, I see! I think I can do that!" rather than
        &gt; "Hmm.. it looks too hard", but it works.) &gt; &gt; Also, I think
        steps 4 to 7 can be easily extended for speed. My &gt; speedcubing
        system is almost a direct extension: &gt; &gt; 4) orient the top layer
        edges and place the middle layer edge using the &gt; empty F2L slot &gt;
        5) insert the last corner while placing the last layer edges &gt; 6)
        orient and permute (simultaneously) the 4 remaining corners &gt; &gt;

        Yes, that is kinda obvious, or should be. Since the size of the cube
        group is of finite size and the order of all elements of the group must
        divide this number, it is clear that repeating a sequence a finite
        number of times will result in the original state. So this could be
        anything, the turn R is cyclic order 4, duh... So when you say they
        explained it incorrectly, how did they explain it??? Let us judge for
        ourselves; their are different interpretations ont his I am sure and
        besides, how can someone get the definition of a cube algorithm wrong,
        doesn't seem likely to me. Oh yes, the 1,2,1 thing is something I call
        some of my algs when explaining to friends. I use it for that edge
        flipping alg and the H/+ perm.... Don't underestimate the intellect of
        others.... I was shocked at how fast my friend picked up the fast DanK Z
        Perm... (only took him a few minutes) and actaully he said it was quite
        easy... except for the accidental D'R at the end instead of the intended
        D2'F, but even I do that sometimes still. It's actually quite cool, once
        you teach somebody what you do in slow motion and they can actually
        perform it, then they see/understand what moves you're performing. Thus,
        they tend to apprieciate your finger dexerity for what it actaully is.

        They are generally aquired from Ton liked off speedcubing.com... unless
        of course you have a friend or relative in or near Hungary. I think it
        is possible to make any cube into a "good speedsolving cube," with the
        exception of cheap knock-offs and dollar store cubes. It does also
        depend on what your style of cubing is and what level your at. Like if I
        was just starting to cube I wouldn't spend $74 on a Ton prepared Arxon
        cube. I can just as easily get a 12.xxs time on my store bought,
        rubiks.com type cube then a Studio Cube. It just depends on how much
        your willing to wear one in. Just last night falling to sleep in bed I
        put a few thousand turns on a cube I just took out of the package,
        perhaps that's the equivalent of a half- year's worth of amature level

        &lt; The concept was exlained to me before the cube was invented.
        Algorithm was given to me as a repeated sequence, but more along the
        lines of a critcal path in constructing a house, like Level the land Dig
        the holes Lay the foundation build the wall frames stand them up, etc
        The sequence, being repeated resulted in a new house. So when I came to
        this board I thought algorithm meant something like a strategy: on one
        side put four corners in place put that side's edges in place put the
        middle level edges in place do the last level corners do the last level
        edges This was a sequence that being repeated had the same result. David

        result in the original state. &gt; &gt; So this could be anything, the
        turn R is cyclic order 4, duh... So &gt; when you say they explained it
        incorrectly, how did they explain &gt; it??? Let us judge for ourselves;
        their are different &gt; interpretations ont his I am sure and besides,
        how can someone get &gt; the definition of a cube algorithm wrong,
        doesn't seem likely to me. &gt; &gt; Oh yes, the 1,2,1 thing is
        something I call some of my algs when &gt; explaining to friends. I use
        it for that edge flipping alg and the &gt; H/+ perm.... Don't
        underestimate the intellect of others.... &gt; &gt; I was shocked at how
        fast my friend picked up the fast DanK Z &gt; Perm... (only took him a
        few minutes) and actaully he said it was &gt; quite easy... except for
        the accidental D'R at the end instead of &gt; the intended D2'F, but
        even I do that sometimes still. It's actually &gt; quite cool, once you
        teach somebody what you do in slow motion and &gt; they can actually
        perform it, then they see/understand what moves &gt; you're performing.
        Thus, they tend to apprieciate your finger &gt; dexerity for what it
        actaully is. &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        I think that's an excellent way of going about it. When they &gt; grasp
        &gt; &gt; that "1,2,1" you have a good opportuninty to introduce the
        concept &gt; of &gt; &gt; the algorithm. The first time someone
        explained algorithm to me &gt; they &gt; &gt; had it wrong. People here
        refer to algs often, but does everyone &gt; &gt; understand that an
        alogithm is a sequence that when repeated a &gt; certain &gt; &gt;
        number of times times returns to the beginning. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You
        can show your friends that repeating the "1,2,1" sequence &gt; three

        Hi everybody, I fixed the ending to my video so now you can see it. I
        had a cycle of 3 edges (they needed to be moved around clockwise). That
        is basically my fastest permutation. Enjoy the video now that you can
        see the whole thing! Also I made the video smaller and now the quality

        I am sure your version is much better than the one I teach :) I
        definitely can't get 30's with it the way I do this method (perhaps mine
        is a much simpler version). I can average around 50's with two hands
        this way with an occasional 40 something time. I have found though,
        which is what I meant by my last post, is that a very very simplified
        version of this strategy is a good way to teach people who are just
        starting. This works since most people seem to be able to pick up on it
        since it allows the learner to understand what they're doing to the cube
        more than a layer-by-layer method where they learn a few algs for the
        last layer. Also don't underestimate your one-handed speed, you did hold
        the record for 20 years, which is quite a feat in my opinion :) Chris

        &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem with this method is that it doesn't extend
        easily &gt; into &gt; &gt; &gt; faster methods, the person has to ditch
        everything after the &gt; cross &gt; &gt; &gt; if they want to learn
        Fridrich for example. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I taught a few people
        recently, and found it is not really too &gt; difficult &gt; &gt; to
        extend this to Fridrich. They will probably have figured out &gt; that
        &gt; &gt; there are two 3 move algorithms for inserting a corner (with
        the &gt; LL on &gt; &gt; the bottom): &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. R U' R'
        &gt; &gt; 2. R U R' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remind them of that, and then
        show them that there are two 3 move &gt; &gt; algorithms for inserting
        an edge: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. R U' R' &gt; &gt; 2. R U R' &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; They will probably not be aware of the second one. But once
        they &gt; &gt; understand that these are the same algorithms,
        demonstrate &gt; inserting a &gt; &gt; corner and edge simultaneously
        with each algorithm. All they need &gt; to &gt; &gt; learn is how to get
        the corner and edge pieces "aligned" first, &gt; and then &gt; &gt;
        apply algorithm 2. (Yes, the initial part of the explanation is &gt;
        just a &gt; &gt; trick to make them think "Ah, I see! I think I can do
        that!" &gt; rather than &gt; &gt; "Hmm.. it looks too hard", but it
        works.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I think steps 4 to 7 can be easily
        extended for speed. My &gt; &gt; speedcubing system is almost a direct
        extension: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) orient the top layer edges and place
        the middle layer edge &gt; using the &gt; &gt; empty F2L slot &gt; &gt;
        5) insert the last corner while placing the last layer edges &gt; &gt;
        6) orient and permute (simultaneously) the 4 remaining corners &gt; &gt;

        Well for the 4x4, you usually pop and edge, CAREFULLY of course and
        never on an overly new 4x4 as Ton recommends. So it just a matter of
        taking one edge piece out; they don't go too deep; do this with about 40
        deg turn on it. Adjust the tention of the screws on the sphere while
        your at it; it makes a big difference for the Meffert's one, but I think
        the kernel on my Rubiks.com one is completely glued together. For the
        5x5, it definately depends on the mechanism.... For Meffert's I
        recommend taking out a single non-middle edge piece (wear the cube in
        first of course). For the rubiks.com brand you can take out an entire
        edge triplet at the 45 degree mark just as you would for one edge of a
        3x3. The problem here is that it goes VERY deep so be careful. The
        Rubiks.com 5x5 is much more flexible in this regard and perfromring this
        feat on a brand new one is alright I think/hope. Hemm... just noticed
        that I always leave my 4x4 sitting on top of my monitor, hehe. The full
        effect is that if someone walked past my room they could instantly see
        about 15 cubes in plain site, counting the Homer Head and Megaminx. That
        surely draws in some unwanted visitors at bad times now and then. Of
        course if my door was closed they would see like 500 worn-out cube
        stickers, hehe. As a rule of thumb, all internal points of contact
        should be lubed to some degree. "My fingers hurt." YA, RIGHT!!?? I jsut
        did a re-estimation, it seems I put 10,000 turns HTM on my new, 'stiff'
        cube last night and 5,000 tonight (already up again at 2AM to study for
        tommorrow's (ops, today's) Orgo exam.... yuk...)...... So don't tell me
        YOUR finger's hurt. I do a fair amount of 4x4 speedsolving also. "I've
        only taken apart a 4x4x4, and it's basically the same as a 3x3x3."
        &lt;---- What the heck??? UH, NO. But that might depend on your pov,
        there were a few 'other' viable 4x4 mechanisms inveted that post-date
        the original... 'those' might be similar to the 3x3 we all know and
        love. A sphere with tracks is hardly the same as a 6 arm spider
        mechanism. "Just lever up one edge." &lt;---- Not with a screw driver or
        key btw. "But I would advise that you don't take it completely apart,
        because it's terribly difficult to put it back together. But from what
        I've heard, the mechanics of a 5x5x5 are similar to a 3x3x3. They're
        easy to put back together." &lt;---- That also sounds a bit fishy to me.
        The mechanism (mechanismS should I say) for a 5x5 is simialr to the 3x3.
        But it doesn't sound too logical that a 5x5 is easier to assemble then a
        4x4. I think they are both about the same, the 4x4 easier once you get
        the hang of how the center pieces go in, especially the final one. They
        all go in first before the last few edges at the latest. On the
        contrary, I advise taking it apart and putting it back together to learn
        about hos the mechanism works. I's a puzzle in itself when your doing it
        for the first time around. It does get a bit annoying eventually, I must
        point out. "i think the 4x4 is actually very easy to put back together."
        &lt;---- Now that's the spirit! "dont take the 5x5 apart, unless you
        want an hour of fun" &lt;---- a bit of an exaggeration of course, but
        this is partially due to the fact that the same parity problems do arise
        in the 5x5 as the 3x3. As for the 4x4, odds are good.... you get a 1/3
        chance of having a solvable cube once you randomly assemble it. The
        problem is in the possibility of a single corner twist in either
        direction. Try speed- assembly, it's kinda a nifty thing to do with
        other cubists. We did it at the hotel lobby the last day I was there.
        Might even been added to one of the documentaries for it, :). Man I got
        beat, LOL. No wonder Wesley is so fast at solving, he wastes no time in
        assembly... :). "just pop a piece out and spray some lube, that should
        do the trick." &lt;---- Yep, fast and painless. Then scramble fircely
        and repeat until desired. &lt;---- similar to the back of a shampoo
        bottle... -Doug (Happy Cubing people) --- In

        speedsolving method? No, but it's good to hear you have gotten sub-30
        with it. It is kind of fun to guess at the limits for different speed
        cubing methods. At the bottom of
        http://users.rcn.com/rhodee/cubelog.html Andy suggests that the limit of
        the Fridrich system may be more like 14.6-15 seconds. I am willing to
        believe that considering he is very close to 15 seconds just with pure
        Fridrich. If I may dream further, I'd like to believe that my step 2
        gives *at least* 0.6 seconds improvement to the time - maybe 13 point
        something is possible? I'd also like to believe that building my step 1
        with squares instead of corner/edge pairs can give 1-2 seconds
        improvement. But that's the bit that really needs proving. Lars had a
        great idea with his method: place the pieces in an order that causes
        minimal obstruction, and this will inevitably lead to much fewer moves
        than Fridrich. But why are the Fridrich people faster? Can I really gain
        1-2 seconds improvement with the Lars principle? I had practiced the
        Fridrich system before, and here is what I liked: - forming a cross
        forces many pieces onto the top layer making them easier to find - LESS
        TIME LOOKING FOR PIECES - a complete table of F2L cases is supplied - IT
        IS POSSIBLE TO PREPARE FOR ALL CASES - FASTER REACTION TIME I think this
        must be the difference that makes the Fridrich people faster. So I tried
        to design a system that could employ the Lars principle, but spend less
        time looking for pieces, and find some way to prepare for all cases. *
        less time looking for pieces * After I build one square, I need to look
        for pieces for building the next square. With 3 sides free, you can
        choose among 3 squares to build in standard Petrus, but among *12*
        squares in my system. In my view, the extreme ends are the best - either
        choose the same square every time (which requires less looking around),
        or allow yourself to consider the whole cube in the picture, and just
        choose whichever pieces jump out at you. In other words, I try not to
        look around too much at this stage, but just try to recognise any of a
        number of patterns that I have programmed myself to see. By now
        considering any piece in the whole cube, you can just see a pattern
        anywhere rather than looking around for specific pieces. I built a
        fallback plan into this system that is tied with step 2. If I cannot
        immediately see any pattern that is good, I just do some easy moves to
        orient the edges. After that is done, I look again to see if there are
        any good patterns. If not, bad luck, but this generally increases the
        chances of finding something without having to look for it. * preparing
        for all cases * I tried to find a way to develop some table similar to
        Fridrich. This is difficult because the number of cases is much much
        greater than Fridrich's. What I came up with was to develop a table of
        patterns where a corner/edge pair is already joined, and another table
        of patterns where a centre/edge pair is already joined (this one is not
        finished yet). By studying those, it is possible to see how to get from
        any position to the nearest pattern in the table. I'm sure everyone
        knows how to solve all of those positions in my tables. The point is not
        to teach you how to solve those positions (you should work that out by
        yourself!). The point is to display all the positions side by side so
        that you can study them, see how many moves each different pattern takes
        so that you can calculate which path is the shortest while your solving,
        and also just so that you "know" what the patterns are and can respond
        quickly to them when you see them. &gt; I'm not TOO much of a fan of
        early Edge Permutation, but it is &gt; sometimes worth it since many of
        my CLLs preserve such things. Exactly! So many of the very shortest LL
        algorithms preserve the positions of the edges. That is one thing I like
        about step 4. Many of the optimal algorithms for step 4 are just formed
        by combining these short edge preserving algorithms in different ways.
        That makes memorisation a great deal easier. Ryan

        There where two main speedcube methods used at the WC A F2L method and
        variants A corners first and variants I saw two main method for
        speedcubing finger tricks, based on slice moves, and based on FRU moves
        And there are a lots of variants and mixed methods, what I think is
        important is how fast can you see a pattern,what is the average moves
        needed to solve the cube, are finger tricks possible. Some thoughts A
        very rude method would be a F2L and one method to orientate and place
        the last layer. A bit less rude is F2L and orientate the edges of the
        last layer than Orientate corners and position the last layer in one
        method But for both the above you would need to practice a lot of
        algoritmes and this is not impossible but impractical. My prediction
        (gut feeling) is that it is possible to design an method with an average
        of 40 moves and can be solved in 12 seconds at average. But for this we
        would need the input of the speedcubing community and a lot of
        investigation and some theoretical calculations. For sure what is needed
        dedication to practise and the talent. I gues that most of the top
        speedcubers already do the investigation and some theoretical
        calculations, I already know they have the talent and the dedication to
        practise. But than again a big factor at a competetion will be: how will
        you perform during a competetions? If we look at the WC2003 we see that
        the average was 3 to 6 seconds above the normal performance. I gues the
        main improvement for the top speedcubers will be to train your self to
        perform in competetion. If I evaluate myself I conclude, to turn in
        public you can train and it helps a bit. But still I do not perform well
        in a head-to-head competition. I improve the most when I would train in
        a head-to-head speedcube race. I did some fun races with Ron, like the
        blindsmans cube or the Siamese fused cube and that helps a lot. If I
        only was twice as fast! Ton P.S. I have now the dedication to get to 25
        seconds average! It will be a long way for me, but I know I can get
        there. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, nviennefr

        I agree with you on the disassembly of Eastsheen 4x4's and 5x5's.
        Somehow I forgot about those, mostly because I don't have any, but one
        of these day's I'll get around to it. "could you please use a kinder
        tone in your responses?" Ok, your right, sorry. Most of the time I'm
        just kidding. I'll try to keep it down from now on. These are all only
        opinions here. With few execptions, no one of us can give the definative
        answer to any cube question.... but we can try. "Isn't it possible that
        the other person's hands truly did hurt, and perhaps even more than

        soccer players comparing sports injuries... More making light of how
        cubing isn't usually thought of as something that one gets injured from.
        "Just ask Dan Gosbee - he was mixing all the cubes (at least at first)

        that's not a typical thing to have to do. I do apprieciate all the work

        It's really difficult to put a finger on it all, considering everyones

        &gt; community and a lot of investigation and some &gt; theoretical &gt;
        calculations. For sure what is needed dedication to &gt; practise and
        the &gt; talent. I gues that most of the top speedcubers &gt; already do
        the &gt; investigation and some theoretical calculations, I &gt; already
        know they &gt; have the talent and the dedication to practise. &gt; &gt;
        But than again a big factor at a competetion will &gt; be: how will you
        &gt; perform during a competetions? If we look at the &gt; WC2003 we see
        that &gt; the average was 3 to 6 seconds above the normal &gt;
        performance. I gues &gt; the main improvement for the top speedcubers
        will be &gt; to train your &gt; self to perform in competetion. &gt;
        &gt; If I evaluate myself I conclude, to turn in public &gt; you can
        train and &gt; it helps a bit. But still I do not perform well in a &gt;
        head-to-head &gt; competition. I improve the most when I would train
        &gt; in a head-to-head &gt; speedcube race. I did some fun races with
        Ron, like &gt; the blindsmans &gt; cube or the Siamese fused cube and
        that helps a lot. &gt; &gt; If I only was twice as fast! &gt; &gt; Ton
        &gt; P.S. I have now the dedication to get to 25 seconds &gt; average!
        It will &gt; be a long way for me, but I know I can get there. &gt; &gt;

        Hi friendz, Just to let you know that I started solving corners first a
        week after the WC 2003. My expectation is that I cannot beat my CFOP
        (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL) record with it. I do think that it will give me more
        experience to improve my times for more advanced CFOP systems. The
        corners first system I currently use is: 1) first layer (systematically)
        2) corners of last layer (algorithms) 3) two edges of last layer
        (algorithms) 4) last two edges of last layer (algorithms) 5) orient
        middle layer edges (algorithms) 6) permute middle layer edges
        (algorithms) This is basically the Waterman system without combining
        step 4 and 5. For combining these steps you need to learn table 3 and 4
        of the Waterman system. These are tough ones! Slowly I am working my way
        through the tables, but it will take me some more time. At the moment,
        exactly one month after starting corners first, my normal averages are
        sub 24 seconds, with a best of 23.1 seconds: 20 (29) 25 24 22 20 20 26
        23 23 23 (19). I am finally getting used to keeping the last layer on
        the right and finishing off the cube using only R, U and M moves. I am
        surprised that using this system I only take on average 10 slice moves
        per cube. Anyway: corners first is fun! Have fun, Ron

        I have been doing corners first solves for fun lately. While most of my
        free cubing time is used for learning the zb method, I find myself
        mysteriously pulled towards the corners first method. With minimal
        practice I have learned to do the corners first in times almost under 30
        seconds. It is definetly a method worth looking at for all curious.

        Yes I agree. The idea of limits is a bit scary... But I believe that in
        the end the best method will not just be a single one, having the
        flexiblity and algorithms of multiple methods will allow for the fastest
        possible times I think. -Doug --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I saw two main method for speedcubing finger tricks,

        method to &gt; &gt; orientate and &gt; &gt; place the last layer. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; A bit less rude is F2L and orientate the edges of &gt;

        and this is not impossible but impractical. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My
        prediction (gut feeling) is that it is possible &gt; &gt; to design an
        &gt; &gt; method with an average of 40 moves and can be solved &gt; &gt;
        in 12 seconds at &gt; &gt; average. But for this we would need the input

        and 5. &gt; For combining these steps you need to learn table 3 and 4 of
        the &gt; Waterman system. These are tough ones! Slowly I am working my
        way &gt; through the tables, but it will take me some more time. &gt;
        &gt; At the moment, exactly one month after starting corners first, my
        &gt; normal averages are sub 24 seconds, with a best of 23.1 seconds:
        &gt; 20 (29) 25 24 22 20 20 26 23 23 23 (19). &gt; I am finally getting
        used to keeping the last layer on the right and &gt; finishing off the
        cube using only R, U and M moves. &gt; I am surprised that using this
        system I only take on average 10 &gt; slice moves per cube. &gt; &gt;
        Anyway: corners first is fun! &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt; &gt; Ron &gt;

        Does anyone know what David Allen's average time is? I heard someone say
        that he averaged 14 seconds, but I dunno. That's the fastest time we
        know of. I think that about 4 moves per second is the maximum possible
        average while solving, and probably 40 moves is the minimum possible
        moves to average. You can do the math. --- In

        This reminds me of a post I made a while back. My (modified) theory is
        that there are only the phisical limits of the cube. Say someone can
        avrage 14 seconds. Although that is amazing, it should be possible to
        bring that down to 13.5 seconds. From there you can improve to 13
        seconds, and so on. The improvements may be less than .5 seconds (.01
        seconds), but from there you can always get that "just a little bit
        faster" I don't really believe in limits to what the mind can acomplish,
        I just think we can improve our current capabilities. So in reply to how
        fast is possible, I would say that with an incredible amount of practice
        combined with a very talented cubist and an equally good method, it may
        be possible to average 7 seconds, or possibly even faster. I know many
        of you think "7 seconds, what is this guy thinking?", but what I want to
        know is, what is your mental cut off? Another thing to think about is,
        how close is what you think is possible for yourself to what you
        achieve? (for example if you know some people go 15 seconds, but you
        think you are only capible of 25 seconds, my guess is that your average
        will be about 25-30 seconds) Just my thoughts, 4 |\| ]) `/ |3 (andy b)

        i think of it as improving our technology rather than improving
        ourselves. at one time, people thought the cube could be solved in a
        minimum of say, 52 moves. that is down to like 22. as we find better
        ways, like less moves incorporated w/ finger tricks, or better finger
        tricks not thought of, the possibilities are endless. Pyraminx Master

        I'd have to agree with your reference to chess players. At the beginning

        lecture one night as GM Golden went through lines of the English
        Opening. They memorize these openings/defenses and all their variations.
        And when you play at a professional level, you need to be familiar with
        ALL the variations, mainlines, etc. In the MCO, (modern chess openings)
        &lt;&lt;book) there is 400-500 pages of openings...If anyone ever

        However, chess is much more capable of applying algorithms, because
        physically, you have to train your fingers a certain way, and it's just
        different for the cube. besides, if anyone takesthe time to learn
        thousands of algs to average under 10, i will feel sorry for them,
        because we all gotta be happy and have fun in our lives..sometime ;)

        I touched base with the idea of actually being able to execute all
        learned algs...which obviously would be no easy endeavor. And
        besides...fun is a perception thing...someone might actually have fun
        learning 10000 algs...i dunno -Richard --- Brent Morgan

        Help! I've been able to solve the rubik's revenge a few times. I used
        the method where you build the centers and then connect the edge pairs.
        Then I solve it as if it was a 3x3 rubik's cube. However, I tried it
        this time and on the last step I got this wierd edge permutation where
        the orange is in the red, the red is in the green, the green is in the
        blue, and the blue is in the orange! I don't know an algorithm for that.

        Hello Ron, Could you tell a little bit more about your new approach? 1.
        How many moves in average for the first layer? 2. How many moves for the
        last corners? (That you should know theoretically) 3. How many moves in
        all (approximately in average)? 4. Do you have a feeling that the
        dispersion is bigger here than in CFOP? (I¬¥m asking, since this approach
        resembles mine). Regards Rune Hi friendz, Just to let you know that I
        started solving corners first a week after the WC 2003. My expectation
        is that I cannot beat my CFOP (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL) record with it. I do
        think that it will give me more experience to improve my times for more
        advanced CFOP systems. The corners first system I currently use is: 1)
        first layer (systematically) 2) corners of last layer (algorithms) 3)
        two edges of last layer (algorithms) 4) last two edges of last layer
        (algorithms) 5) orient middle layer edges (algorithms) 6) permute middle
        layer edges (algorithms) This is basically the Waterman system without
        combining step 4 and 5. For combining these steps you need to learn
        table 3 and 4 of the Waterman system. These are tough ones! Slowly I am
        working my way through the tables, but it will take me some more time.
        At the moment, exactly one month after starting corners first, my normal
        averages are sub 24 seconds, with a best of 23.1 seconds: 20 (29) 25 24
        22 20 20 26 23 23 23 (19). I am finally getting used to keeping the last
        layer on the right and finishing off the cube using only R, U and M
        moves. I am surprised that using this system I only take on average 10
        slice moves per cube. Anyway: corners first is fun! Have fun, Ron

        no, its more of a thistlewaite approach. Its about 70-80 moves per

        Hi Guys, A lot of what has been discussed here in terms of getting
        faster has to do with looking ahead. But so far in contests people are
        given 15 seconds of free look-ahead time. I think that this
        pre-inspection time should be counted. *Then* talk about who is fastest.
        If half the game is free it takes away something important. Why not
        contests where 5 or 10 or 12 cubes are uncovered at once; you have at it
        and whoever is done first wins, plus a quick time win for the quickest
        from the end of one cube to the end of the next. I know some may not
        like this, but I think counting the entire time is fair. David J

        It is an Idea, but is it practical? I do not have 5 speedcubes, most
        speedcubers have 2 some 3 speedcubes So I gues this can only be
        performed using normal cubes. But with 2 or 3 speedcubes you can think
        of a small marathon race, where you have 1 cube that will be uncovered.
        While you begin the next one is placed on the table, after you finshed
        your cube will be again scrambeld and so on, until 10 cube solves. The
        only unpractical is that this will require a speedy scrambler since
        he/she must scramble a specific pattern for a offical contest. Ton ---

        When I first brought up the idea of limits in my cube log on my site, I
        was specifically talking about the Fridrich method with no other random
        memorized stuff, using ONLY what you know about the cross, F2L, OLL, and
        PLL. I don't think less than (maybe) 14.1 - 14.4 is possible any time
        soon. No extended cross should be used because that's not "pure
        Fridrich". When people talk about limits there will have to be an
        ultimate method that has the following criteria: 1. few steps (a 4-step
        solution will be faster than an 8-step solution). 2. not too many
        sequences to learn. (not exactly) 3. allows for little delays between
        steps 4. every sequence is customized for fastest execution 5. intuition
        and flexibility with options at the beginning (Heise method follows
        that). 6. end steps use specific cases that (should) average about 10
        moves. This allows for the last step or two to be executed in only about
        2-2.5 seconds. #2 above is not exactly true as some people brought up
        with the chess players. When I printed out all of Peter's moves for the
        Fridrich method, I had 10 pages to learn. It took me about two and a
        half months to learn all that. How long does it take a chess master to
        learn 500 pages? How much time and dedication do you need to learn all
        that? Few people would ever be able to do all of that right away. Also,
        there aren't any methods right now that fill up 500 pages. However, with
        Ryan's system, you can average down to 45 moves and you're only required
        to learn about the same as the Fridrich method (maybe a little more or
        less). I see an average of 13 or possibly sub-13 seconds possible with
        his system. When the subject of limits are discussed, what solving
        method are you referring to? There are different methods, and some that
        haven't been discovered, but in the end, the limits might approach 10
        seconds on average. Andy http://users.rcn.com/rhodee/cube.html

        I've had the same problems as well. Second ?: U and u have to do with
        the notation of the Revenge. On a regular 3x3 you have
        U(up)D(down)F(front)B(back)r(right)L(left) for denoting the different
        sides. On the Revenge, there are two layers for each side, so the outer
        layer is labeled with a capitalized letter, and the inner layer with a
        lowercase layer. The asterisk for a counterclockwise twist and the 2 for
        a half twist still apply. Example: Looking at the Revenge from the
        front, the far left slice would be referred to as "L", the second from
        left "l", the third from left "r", and the far right one would be "R".
        Understand? The same goes for the UD and FB sets. (See below for an
        illustration) Third ?: First of all, a parity error is something that
        can never happen on a properly put together 3x3 cube. In the case of the
        4x4 ( and all sizes beyond it), in some cases when you put together the
        centers (or edges) you don't match them up correctly, and this messes
        with the placing of them. An example would be what you have: the two
        edge pieces that are red that are on the green side and the two pieces
        that are green that are on the blue side were misplaced when you put
        together the centers, so you would have to have them switch places for

        regular 3x3 you have U(up)D(down)F(front)B(back)r(right)L(left) &gt; for
        denoting the different sides. On the Revenge, there are two &gt; layers
        for each side, so the outer layer is labeled with a &gt; capitalized
        letter, and the inner layer with a lowercase layer. The &gt; asterisk
        for a counterclockwise twist and the 2 for a half twist &gt; still
        apply. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Example: Looking at the Revenge from the
        front, the far left slice &gt; would be referred to as "L", the second
        from left "l", the third &gt; from left "r", and the far right one would
        be "R". Understand? The &gt; same goes for the UD and FB sets. (See
        below for an illustration) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Third ?: First of all, a
        parity error is something that can never &gt; happen on a properly put
        together 3x3 cube. In the case of the 4x4 ( &gt; and all sizes beyond
        it), in some cases when you put together the &gt; centers (or edges) you
        don't match them up correctly, and this &gt; messes with the placing of
        them. An example would be what you have: &gt; the two edge pieces that
        are red that are on the green side and the &gt; two pieces that are
        green that are on the blue side were misplaced &gt; when you put
        together the centers, so you would have to have them &gt; switch places
        for the cube to be solved. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First ?: Now to what the
        algorithm does. You now know how to read &gt; the notation, so you
        should be able to do the algorithm fine. What &gt; it does is take the
        four cubies that are on the top face in the "r" &gt; position and switch
        them with the ones in the "l" position. &gt; &gt; Example: &gt; &gt;
        I've labeled the four slices in this illustration. You're looking &gt;
        at the cube from the top. The two sets of cubies that are switched &gt;
        are labeled a and b. The rest of the cubies are labeled x. &gt; &gt; L l
        r R-&gt; L l r R &gt; &gt; x a b x -&gt; x b a x &gt; &gt; x a b x -&gt;
        x b a x &gt; &gt; x a b x -&gt; x b a x &gt; &gt; x a b x -&gt; x b a x

        Hi all it's me...again If you are extremely devoted to cubing, it is
        possible to memorize that 1200 some algs for the LL. If each alg is
        10-15 moves, and the cube is turned at 5-6 moves per second (going full
        speed; no looking ahead needed). This gives you a 2-2.5ish second LL
        plus say, two seconds to find the alg. If you could get your F2L in 7.5
        seconds (6 move cross, 6 moves for each CE pair (it is possible) @ 4
        moves a second = 7.5 seconds) you would have an average of 9.5-10
        seconds. With practice you could turn the cube faster, use less time
        recognizing LL alg, etc. to get even faster. If you used something
        similar to ZZ's method, you would have to memorize MANY more algs, but
        could go even faster. A computer takes a very long time to figure out
        the 21 turn sequence that will solve a fully scrambled cube, but the
        computer cannot actually think and look ahead at turns. Therefore the
        computer is forced to actually see what the cube would look like for
        each combonation of turns, then figure out which combonation solves the
        cube. The human mind is capible of seeing ahead and thinking (i hope) so
        it may be possible for someone to use god's algorithm. It has been done
        on the Pyraminx and 2x2x2 cube. Then if you could get the algorithm
        figured out, you should be able to turn the cube at 4-5 turns (almost
        full speed, some looking ahead) to get an avrage time of less than 5
        seconds. This could also be improved on by getting faster turning
        possibly up to 7 turns a second (with finger tricks) to get a time of 3
        seconds! (assuming the cube dosn't break) This would obviously take a
        more devoted cubist than I think anyone is, but I think it is
        theoretically possible. 4 |\| ]) `/ |3 Yahoo! Groups

        name a few (not all 8 are present) and show how different algs solve for
        the identical case:)), if you prefer HTM the non-trivial ones range from
        6 to 16 (luckily only one cases requiring 16HTs, it's solved by
        F'L¬≤BLB'U¬≤BL'B'L¬≤UFU'RU¬≤R' in case anyone's interested), this result's
        the same for STM btw. Oh and sorry about the LL on bottom thing, I am
        still in the habit of doing. When you say find the alg, I assume you
        mean recall it and not look it up on a table. &gt; If you could get your
        F2L in 7.5 seconds (6 move cross, 6 moves for each CE pair (it is
        possible) @ 4 moves a second = 7.5 seconds) you would have an average of
        9.5-10 seconds. With practice you could turn the cube faster, use less
        time recognizing LL alg, etc. to get even faster. *** This is of course
        best case senerio, 7 move cross seems like a more conservative estimate,
        but 6 is possible for c/e pair average by picking a good order to do
        them. From people that practice the Fridrich method, that I've talked
        to, it seems some tend to go for sub0optimal ones just to incorporate
        some good triggers, which I think is worth it. &gt; If you used
        something similar to ZZ's method, you would have to memorize MANY more
        algs, but could go even faster. *** Yep. &gt; A computer takes a very
        long time to figure out the 21 turn sequence that will solve a fully
        scrambled cube, but the computer cannot actually think and look ahead at
        turns. *** Not quite true, the very intelligent programs out there can
        kinda see ahead... they have large lookup tables and can detect dead-
        end type paths. &gt; This could also be improved on by getting faster
        turning possibly up to 7 turns a second (with finger tricks) to get a
        time of 3 seconds! (assuming the cube dosn't break) This would obviously
        take a more devoted cubist than I think anyone is, but I think it is
        theoretically possible. *** I think 7 turns per second is realistic...
        Perhaps not sustained for too long though. *** As many people have said,
        learning a ton of LL algs isn't going to help with speed much. For me
        recognition starts to kill my times. As for devotion and all that... I
        am in the proccess, still, of learning a high percentage of algs for all
        LL cases. I know it's not going to help me much, but at least for me it
        has novelty value. -Doug Li

        I found your reference of extended cross not being "pure fridrichs".
        While I don't know what your definition of pure is, I do assume EC to be
        just as pure as anything else. It's just combining steps between cross
        and your first f2l pair...An intuitive action that combines steps should
        not make a method any more or less "pure" than others. And since no one
        has or will ever find the "ultimate solution" it may not be fair to lay
        down any criteria at all. -Richard --- Andy C &lt;rubiks1938@...&gt;
        wrote: &gt; When I first brought up the idea of limits in my &gt; cube
        log on my site, I was &gt; specifically talking about the Fridrich

        you know about the &gt; cross, F2L, OLL, and &gt; PLL. I don't think
        less than (maybe) 14.1 - 14.4 is &gt; possible any time soon. No &gt;
        extended cross should be used because that's not &gt; "pure Fridrich".
        &gt; &gt; When people talk about limits there will have to be &gt; an
        ultimate method that &gt; has the following criteria: &gt; &gt; 1. few
        steps (a 4-step solution will be faster than &gt; an 8-step solution).
        &gt; 2. not too many sequences to learn. (not exactly) &gt; 3. allows
        for little delays between steps &gt; 4. every sequence is customized for
        fastest &gt; execution &gt; 5. intuition and flexibility with options at
        the &gt; beginning (Heise method follows &gt; that). &gt; 6. end steps
        use specific cases that (should) &gt; average about 10 moves. This &gt;
        allows for the last step or two to be executed in &gt; only about 2-2.5
        seconds. &gt; &gt; #2 above is not exactly true as some people brought
        &gt; up with the chess &gt; players. When I printed out all of Peter's
        moves for &gt; the Fridrich method, I had &gt; 10 pages to learn. It
        took me about two and a half &gt; months to learn all that. &gt; How
        long does it take a chess master to learn 500 &gt; pages? How much time
        &gt; and dedication do you need to learn all that? Few &gt; people would
        ever be able &gt; to do all of that right away. Also, there aren't any
        &gt; methods right now that fill up &gt; 500 pages. However, with Ryan's
        system, you can &gt; average down to 45 moves &gt; and you're only
        required to learn about the same as &gt; the Fridrich method &gt; (maybe
        a little more or less). I see an average of &gt; 13 or possibly sub-13
        &gt; seconds possible with his system. &gt; &gt; When the subject of
        limits are discussed, what &gt; solving method are you &gt; referring
        to? There are different methods, and some &gt; that haven't been &gt;

        &gt; forced to actually see what the cube would look like &gt; for each
        combonation of turns, then figure out which &gt; combonation solves the
        cube. The human mind is &gt; capible of seeing ahead and thinking (i
        hope) so it &gt; may be possible for someone to use god's algorithm.
        &gt; It has been done on the Pyraminx and 2x2x2 cube. &gt; Then if you

        My gut reaction is to say that it might not be as efficient but I say
        that only because I am ridiculously biased to the way I do it now, since
        I've done it that way for so long. When I really think about doing it
        that way though, I think it could be just as fast if not faster. If you
        memorized all the algs required to do the 2x2x2 in 10 seconds (just
        looking at the UWR lists) then as long as you had a fast way to build
        the corners you could do this very quickly. Also note that solving by
        2x2x2 blocks would make it relatively easy to solve a picute 4x4x4 cube.
        Plus spinning only two layers all the time goes very quickly. I think
        this approach could be fast as well, as long as you had an elegant way
        of putting the corners together. My brain is wired for solving into a
        3x3x3 but I tried this and inefficiently got two 2x2x2 blocks built but
        my approach doesn't look to promising, I would definitely have to
        rethink it. One thing I'm thinking is to build 2x2x1 sections all the
        way around the cube, then solve the sections into 2x2x2 corners, or
        maybe even direct solve the cube out of these 2x2x1 sections. Anyway I'm
        just throwing out some ideas, but I think this method with sufficient
        practice could be just as fast as solving into a 3x3x3, if not faster
        since solving as a 2x2x2 will go very quickly with specialized algs. My

        If it is in a 2x2x2 form it would be faster to solve To place the edges
        at the corners is more or less the same as making pairs, but this is
        much harder to see The real problem is the centers it would be very hard

        different ways to solve the cube using the same algo, i found a way that
        gave me an about average solve. no lucky cases, but no unlucky either.
        After like just 5 solves i managed a time of 25 sec, and i would think
        estimate that i would get close to 20 seconds after more practice. my
        average at the moment is about 41, with my best average at 38.8 This
        would indicate that i waste over 15 seconds, maily looking for F2L

        ok, Now, its the parity problem. better get used to it. it happens about

        Hi Ton, It may be a tad impractical to find many excellent cubes for a
        competition set up like that, but take what I said as an example. This
        can be done one cube at a time. There are many ways that a mixed cube
        can be covered before the start, and it shouldn't be too hard to start
        the timer as soon as the cube is visible. For your scenario it might be
        easy sometime in the future to have a computerised scrambling machine.

        cubes. &gt; &gt; But with 2 or 3 speedcubes you can think of a small

        your cube will be &gt; again scrambeld and so on, until 10 cube solves.
        &gt; &gt; The only unpractical is that this will require a speedy

        I have some doubts now about testing the limits of cubing with this
        method. I went to Jess' timer and picked a scramble, namely U B2 F L D'
        B L2 D' U B2 R F' B2 L' D U' L2 R2 D2 F2 L' F2 R2 D' U' and began using
        it over and over for one handed solves. I prefer averages of three, so
        here are a couple averages of three repeating this scramble. (44.07)
        (34.82) 36.40 43.61 39.15 = 39.72 34.07 (38.75) 37.27 38.64(drop)
        (32.27) = 36.66 after that my hand starting getting tired since I had
        done 4-5 warm up trials as well so my times started suffering pretty
        bad. Anyway I don't think this is a good estimate of the limits for one
        handed cubing in that it did help to know what cases were coming up
        next, but I noticed that one handed cubing seems to be all about the
        moves you do. A couple of sections during this solve were very "clumbsy"
        for me using one hand in that I had to reach very far across the cube or
        push faces with my ring finger which is slower than being able to pull a
        face with another finger. Anyway I remember my 29.80 solve being none
        other than "beautiful". It was non lucky but every alg blended right
        into the next one and there were no "clumbsy" sections during the solve.
        This method only tests the pros and cons of one solve, which had I
        picked a better scramble for my hands I could have gotten a much faster
        average. So I don't think one scramble can well represent one handed
        solving. I then put down the one handed cube and got out my speed cube
        to practice this alg (the same alg and same solution as I used for one
        handed) and did an average. Here is what I got, Warm up times: 14.55
        18.86 16.91 14.32 15.42 13.50 15.86 12.97 12.54 12.77 13.78 13.87 The
        average: [13.42 13.18 14.29 (15.43) 13.00 12.93 13.88 13.20 12.24
        (11.58) 12.41 13.99] = 13.25 Again I still doubt this method as a way of
        testing the limits of cubing since this solve had a semi-decent extended
        cross (8 moves). Also the orientation alg was one of my faster ones and
        the permutation alg was the simple three edge cycle. Also I had already
        done this scramble several times for one handed so I was a little used
        to it before I even started doing two handed trials. I see this method
        to be exactly like cupstacking. Some sections of the solution go really
        fast and some are not so fast but you have to practice to make them fast
        anyway. This is like cupstacking, the down stacking is ridiculously
        fast, but stacking the 10 pyramid takes a lot more time. So anyway I
        just want to add that though I think this is a fun exercise to do, it
        does not judge how fast the limits of cubing are (1 or 2 handed). If I
        were to devote all of my practice to the above scramble for a year, I
        could probably get sub-10 or even sub-9 or sub-8 second times on a good
        cube no problem. Also it depends on the scramble you chose. Mine had an
        ok extended cross and a semi-fast LL, a scramble without a good EC and
        with a slow LL would have yielded a slower average. My two cents, Chris
        P.S. for those interested my solution was EC: U'RD'RU'BD'R' F2L:
        UBU'B'R'U2R - F'U2F - U'L'U'LU'FUF' OLL: B'R'FR'F'RFR'F'R2B PLL:

        Hi Guys, Do we get to name all the algorithms that we found on our own?
        I've got about 30 that I'm particularly proud of. I know that some of
        these have been found by, dare I say it, thousands of people, like
        "sune." Having thousands of names wouldn't help. But maybe it would be
        better than having many of them named after some computer program. Maybe
        we can code name some of them after, say, the seven dwarves. For
        example, the algorithms that solve the corners where two adjacent
        corners are upright and the other two adjacent corners are rotated to
        where the Up side of the corners face away from each other, we could
        name after "Dopey" for being wall-eyed. David J --- In

        Hi Chris, Interesting. I've done this before, but I'll try that mix next
        week some time... That mix can be applied to the cube 24 different ways.
        How about trying out the same mix starting with the cube "upside down"
        from where you already mixed it. Maybe one of those 24 mixes would be a
        "lucky" mix for you. I wonder what percentage of mixes (done the 24
        ways) would always turn out a "lucky" mix for a particular strategy. I
        don't have enough data to even guess how often this might happen given
        random mixes, but the thought is intriguing. Hmmm... Maybe if one could
        solve the cube starting from any color that they might be able to
        eventually spot any lucky mix. Anyone else have thuoghts on this? Ryan,
        Doug, Gilles, Grant, Simon? Anybody? Regards, David J --- In

        mixed it. Maybe one of those 24 mixes would be a "lucky" mix for you. I
        wonder what percentage of mixes (done the 24 ways) would always turn out
        a "lucky" mix for a particular strategy. I don't have enough data to
        even guess how often this might happen given random mixes, but the
        thought is intriguing. Hmmm... Maybe if one could solve the cube
        starting from any color that they might be able to eventually spot any
        lucky mix. Anyone else have thuoghts on this? Ryan, Doug, Gilles, Grant,

        F2 L' F2 R2 D' U' &gt; &gt; and began using it over and over for one
        handed solves. I prefer &gt; averages of three, so here are a couple
        averages of three repeating &gt; this scramble. &gt; &gt; (44.07)
        (34.82) 36.40 43.61 39.15 = 39.72 &gt; 34.07 (38.75) 37.27 38.64(drop)
        (32.27) = 36.66 &gt; &gt; after that my hand starting getting tired
        since I had done 4-5 warm &gt; up trials as well so my times started
        suffering pretty bad. &gt; &gt; Anyway I don't think this is a good
        estimate of the limits for one &gt; handed cubing in that it did help to
        know what cases were coming up &gt; next, but I noticed that one handed
        cubing seems to be all about the &gt; moves you do. A couple of sections
        during this solve were &gt; very "clumbsy" for me using one hand in that
        I had to reach very far &gt; across the cube or push faces with my ring
        finger which is slower &gt; than being able to pull a face with another
        finger. Anyway I &gt; remember my 29.80 solve being none other than
        "beautiful". It was &gt; non lucky but every alg blended right into the
        next one and there &gt; were no "clumbsy" sections during the solve.
        This method only tests &gt; the pros and cons of one solve, which had I
        picked a better scramble &gt; for my hands I could have gotten a much
        faster average. So I don't &gt; think one scramble can well represent
        one handed solving. &gt; &gt; I then put down the one handed cube and
        got out my speed cube to &gt; practice this alg (the same alg and same
        solution as I used for one &gt; handed) and did an average. Here is what
        I got, &gt; &gt; Warm up times: &gt; 14.55 18.86 16.91 14.32 15.42 13.50
        15.86 12.97 12.54 12.77 13.78 &gt; 13.87 &gt; &gt; The average: &gt;
        &gt; [13.42 13.18 14.29 (15.43) 13.00 12.93 13.88 13.20 12.24 (11.58)
        &gt; 12.41 13.99] = 13.25 &gt; &gt; Again I still doubt this method as a
        way of testing the limits of &gt; cubing since this solve had a
        semi-decent extended cross (8 moves). &gt; Also the orientation alg was
        one of my faster ones and the &gt; permutation alg was the simple three
        edge cycle. Also I had already &gt; done this scramble several times for
        one handed so I was a little &gt; used to it before I even started doing
        two handed trials. &gt; &gt; I see this method to be exactly like
        cupstacking. Some sections of &gt; the solution go really fast and some
        are not so fast but you have to &gt; practice to make them fast anyway.
        This is like cupstacking, the &gt; down stacking is ridiculously fast,
        but stacking the 10 pyramid &gt; takes a lot more time. &gt; &gt; So
        anyway I just want to add that though I think this is a fun &gt;
        exercise to do, it does not judge how fast the limits of cubing are &gt;
        (1 or 2 handed). If I were to devote all of my practice to the above
        &gt; scramble for a year, I could probably get sub-10 or even sub-9 or
        &gt; sub-8 second times on a good cube no problem. &gt; &gt; Also it
        depends on the scramble you chose. Mine had an ok extended &gt; cross
        and a semi-fast LL, a scramble without a good EC and with a &gt; slow LL
        would have yielded a slower average. &gt; &gt; My two cents, &gt; Chris
        &gt; &gt; P.S. for those interested my solution was &gt; &gt; EC:
        U'RD'RU'BD'R' &gt; F2L: UBU'B'R'U2R - F'U2F - U'L'U'LU'FUF' &gt; OLL:
        B'R'FR'F'RFR'F'R2B &gt; PLL: U'F2ULR'F2L'RUF2 &gt; &gt; 47 moves in

        Hey all, I'm in a goofy kinda mood so I thought I'd post this. I
        recently stumbled across www.bwgen.com . It's some kind of application
        that emits specific frequencies to each ear and "melds" them inside your
        brain to make it do tricks, like focus better, relax, or take out the
        trash. I know, most likely a lot of bologna. So I gave it a shot, put on
        some headphones and tried cubing to the (rather annoying) tones it
        output. My times went completely in the gutter. Whether that was a
        function of being annoyed, trying too hard, or what I don't know.
        Thought I'd post it in case it actually DOES end up helping someone.

        never comes down to an argument or struggle for who gets what
        alg/credit... then again, in math a lot of theorems have 2-4 names

        I know there's tons of other algs. But I think most of them are the
        short F2L algs or for corners first. Basically what I was saying is,
        many people learn just the permutation and orientation algorithms, and
        not very many people learn the F2L ones. Well, people memorize them just
        by doing them a lot, not by actually reading them and implanting them
        into your mind. Of course, the corners first people will probably want
        to name a lot of those ones, but I have no idea how most of those work.

        I think to be fair you have to pick a top and front color and stick with
        it for the scramble, this should be choosen before the scramble. It's
        funny how the WC2003 people asked us about this just before they
        scrambled, just to be argumentative, I asked what purpose it held if
        any, LOL. 1) It really doesn't matter; they said it had to do with
        personal preference and/or superstition. 2) They only wanted a top color
        and nothing else so the full orientation of the cube is still not
        well-defined. (Hee, a word I just used like 1000 times in my math hw...,
        I like it when others share, hope people don't mine.) Ideally the solver
        picks to solve, say cross on red or something different to what they're
        used to (assuming Fridrich method). I am at the point where I can go top
        to bottom or bottom to top, color- wise, I hope people understant what I
        mean. So the c/e pairs are the same colors just to give an analogy to
        the mainstream method. I know that some day I'll be able to do stuff
        like after the 2x2x3 block in Petrus method to go in either of the 2
        directions, also an analogy to the non-sensical method I use, but this
        one closer then I care to admit. I can't speak for the other methods out
        there but in mine, I don't think it matters too much because I already
        built in enough flexibility by choosing 1 of 4. Lars himself I know can
        go in any of the 24 or so different ways so he really optimizes on this.

        using it over and over for one handed solves. I prefer &gt; &gt;
        averages of three, so here are a couple averages of three repeating &gt;
        &gt; this scramble. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (44.07) (34.82) 36.40 43.61
        39.15 = 39.72 &gt; &gt; 34.07 (38.75) 37.27 38.64(drop) (32.27) = 36.66
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after that my hand starting getting tired since I
        had done 4-5 warm &gt; &gt; up trials as well so my times started
        suffering pretty bad. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway I don't think this is a
        good estimate of the limits for one &gt; &gt; handed cubing in that it
        did help to know what cases were coming up &gt; &gt; next, but I noticed
        that one handed cubing seems to be all about the &gt; &gt; moves you do.
        A couple of sections during this solve were &gt; &gt; very "clumbsy" for
        me using one hand in that I had to reach very far &gt; &gt; across the
        cube or push faces with my ring finger which is slower &gt; &gt; than
        being able to pull a face with another finger. Anyway I &gt; &gt;
        remember my 29.80 solve being none other than "beautiful". It was &gt;
        &gt; non lucky but every alg blended right into the next one and there
        &gt; &gt; were no "clumbsy" sections during the solve. This method only
        tests &gt; &gt; the pros and cons of one solve, which had I picked a
        better scramble &gt; &gt; for my hands I could have gotten a much faster
        average. So I don't &gt; &gt; think one scramble can well represent one
        handed solving. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I then put down the one handed cube
        and got out my speed cube to &gt; &gt; practice this alg (the same alg
        and same solution as I used for one &gt; &gt; handed) and did an
        average. Here is what I got, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warm up times: &gt;
        &gt; 14.55 18.86 16.91 14.32 15.42 13.50 15.86 12.97 12.54 12.77 13.78
        &gt; &gt; 13.87 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The average: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        [13.42 13.18 14.29 (15.43) 13.00 12.93 13.88 13.20 12.24 (11.58) &gt;
        &gt; 12.41 13.99] = 13.25 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again I still doubt this
        method as a way of testing the limits of &gt; &gt; cubing since this
        solve had a semi-decent extended cross (8 moves). &gt; &gt; Also the
        orientation alg was one of my faster ones and the &gt; &gt; permutation
        alg was the simple three edge cycle. Also I had already &gt; &gt; done
        this scramble several times for one handed so I was a little &gt; &gt;
        used to it before I even started doing two handed trials. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I see this method to be exactly like cupstacking. Some sections of
        &gt; &gt; the solution go really fast and some are not so fast but you
        have to &gt; &gt; practice to make them fast anyway. This is like
        cupstacking, the &gt; &gt; down stacking is ridiculously fast, but
        stacking the 10 pyramid &gt; &gt; takes a lot more time. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So anyway I just want to add that though I think this is a fun &gt;
        &gt; exercise to do, it does not judge how fast the limits of cubing are
        &gt; &gt; (1 or 2 handed). If I were to devote all of my practice to the
        above &gt; &gt; scramble for a year, I could probably get sub-10 or even
        sub-9 or &gt; &gt; sub-8 second times on a good cube no problem. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Also it depends on the scramble you chose. Mine had an ok
        extended &gt; &gt; cross and a semi-fast LL, a scramble without a good
        EC and with a &gt; &gt; slow LL would have yielded a slower average.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My two cents, &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        P.S. for those interested my solution was &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EC:
        U'RD'RU'BD'R' &gt; &gt; F2L: UBU'B'R'U2R - F'U2F - U'L'U'LU'FUF' &gt;
        &gt; OLL: B'R'FR'F'RFR'F'R2B &gt; &gt; PLL: U'F2ULR'F2L'RUF2 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; 47 moves in total

        Can someone explain what is meant by finger tricks? Maybe if I search
        the archive I can find the answer to the next ones but it would be nice
        if someone has the answers to hand: 1. What is an good average number of
        turns for a speed solving algorithm? 2. If you use a F2L method what is
        a good average number of turns for the LL. For my algorithm the answer
        to 1 is between 65 and 70 and the answer to 2 is around 35. Would like

        I was wondering what sort of times are possible with a 3-look LL

        that he achieved pretty fast times with that method, but I thought it

        Finally a simple question with a simple answer. 1) 50-56 is a good
        average number of face turns for speedsolving, and in general the faster
        one tries to go the more turns they will be doing, when one goes slower
        they find more intelligent paths, probabilistically speaking. 2) I
        assume you mean Fridrich F2L and Fridrich LL with OLL and PLL? (The term
        F2L only stands for First 2 Layers, which is a very-broad category
        making the question very complicated to answer.) I would say 20. Eh, 20
        to 22. The faster guys tend to be on the low end of these estimates of
        course. And using less orthodox methods may yield even better numbers as
        in my personal system. And exploiting the various symmetries of the cube
        from start to finish will allow for more favorable solves. There are a
        few other types of these heuristics that I don't care to mention here
        that would greatly take the number down to say 42 FTs easily executable
        and recognizable by us speedcubists. -Doug Li --- In

        Just to clearify for those people out there that are out for blood: By
        replying to this post, I am in no ways declearing that I am "one of the
        fast cubers" or in any other ways being egotistical. All I ever intend
        to do is answer any questions posted, in a timely manner (and perhaps
        share a bit about myself whenever appropriate), even though I realize I
        am posting 'way' too much in the past couple weeks. It's not that I
        don't want to give other people a chance to answer questions, others are
        welcome to correct me, append to it, or simply answer the question from
        scratch. Ok, so there are various spheres of thought on this type of
        question, i.e. maximum improvement with minimum memorization effort. I
        am not bashing on those attempting this type of stuff, it's "practical,"
        but at the same time notice that I used the word "improvement" and not
        "benefit" or "long-term benefit"... My response would be (the not so
        important responds) would be that depending on the 3-look sytem of
        course, but I'll assume 2 quick OLL looks and a quick PLL, I think it is
        possible to get down to 30s flat but probably not too much better. Now
        the shocking answer, is that Gilles claims that it is possible (he does
        it) to get sub-25 "easily," probably like a bit under 23ish if I recall
        correctly from what I read from him (he'll be able to correct me on
        this). To reiterate, I am in no ways criticizing his opinion (others
        opinions), it's just that I may have my own that doesn't completely
        agree with his (someone elses). -Doug Li (sorry again to those people

        As far as I know (or remember), 19.9seconds has been Dan Knights'
        fastest average for 10 consecutive cubes using a 3looks-LL-method for
        more than one year. So Dan himself can probably do it a bit faster now.
        And of course, every speedcubist faster than him with should be able to
        do it faster than Dan. That's why I think an average in the 18's with a
        3 looks LL is completely feasible. --- In

        Thanks Doug for a clear answer to my number of moves question. (I don't
        know what Fridrich is but I've seen it often enough to realise I need to
        find out! I also dont know what OLL and PLL stand for but I guess I'll
        find out if I search for the Fridrich algorithm.) It seems pretty clear
        as I thought that if I get my LL down to 20-22 then my own algorithm
        will come down to 50-55 which sounds about right. Having picked up a
        cube about three weeks ago for the first time in years I am down to
        about 45-50 seconds average so this should help a lot. I still don't
        know what finger tricks are though - does this just mean quick and
        easily recognisable moves? I'd be interested to know whether the
        algorithms that the other one-handed cubists use differ at all from the
        standard speedcubing approach to take into account the limitations (mine
        don't but you guys seem much more sophisticated!). Duncan ----- Original

        Just for fun I decided to do a 3-look LL average of 10: 19.97 19.69
        20.71 19.10 17.83 (21.66) 21.14 (16.00) 19.11 18.00 19.91 21.33 =&gt;
        19.68 So at full speed, the difference between 2-look LL and 3-look LL
        is probably 1-1.5 seconds. The difference in terms of number of moves is
        also only 4.9 moves on average. I also feel that learning the 2-look LL
        only pays off when you can perform _all_ algorithms at full speed. So
        learning a 2-look LL only becomes important when you are already sub-30
        or maybe even sub-25. LarsV --- In

        couple of questions Finally a simple question with a simple answer. 1)
        50-56 is a good average number of face turns for speedsolving, and in
        general the faster one tries to go the more turns they will be doing,
        when one goes slower they find more intelligent paths, probabilistically
        speaking. 2) I assume you mean Fridrich F2L and Fridrich LL with OLL and
        PLL? (The term F2L only stands for First 2 Layers, which is a very-broad
        category making the question very complicated to answer.) I would say
        20. Eh, 20 to 22. The faster guys tend to be on the low end of these
        estimates of course. And using less orthodox methods may yield even
        better numbers as in my personal system. And exploiting the various
        symmetries of the cube from start to finish will allow for more
        favorable solves. There are a few other types of these heuristics that I

        As far as how my one handed approach differs from my speedcubing
        approach, I can only speak for myself here, the only portion of my
        method that I actually change is the first step. When doing it one
        handed, and this is something I'm still working on, I try to always use
        an extended cross approach rather than doing the cross and first corner
        edge pair, I detail this approach at
        http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/f2l.html Most of my changes in my one
        handed solving are changes in style. For example, and this might answer
        your question about finger tricks, I clump different moves together to
        form one handed finger tricks, or the simpler one handed "move combo"
        version of finger tricks. Basically a finger trick is any group of moves
        that you can clump together into one hand motion by utilizing your
        fingers. For example a two handed finger trick would be to turn the
        right face once clockwise using a wrist motion, then turn the top face
        counterclockwise once by allowing your thumb to catch the U face during
        the R turn and continue pushing to turn the face. This trigger would be
        written (RU') in brackets to indicate that it is a finger shortcut if it
        were written in notation. Dan Knight's has an excellent page describing
        finger tricks, including videos at
        http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints A one
        handed true to form finger trick would be to grip the cube (left handed
        since I do it lefty :) ) with your thumb on the front face and middle
        finger on the back face (allow the right and top faces to be free to
        turn). Now place your index finger on the left side sticker of the
        corner in UBL (the intersection of the Left Back and Up faces). Now push
        the U face to turn U clockwise one quarter turn and once that face lines
        up again (without stopping the motion of your hand) pull the R face to
        do R'. So the trigger is (UR') and this does two turns all in one hand
        motion. Sorry for the side track, but I wanted to answer your question
        about finger tricks as well. Basically for one handed solving I clump
        different moves together for one hand triggers. The 3 corner cycle is a
        good example. Two handed I would perform (R2 B2) (RFR') (B2RF'R)
        clumping lots of moves together. However the fastest way I've found to
        do this one handed is, [R2] [B2] R (FR') [B2] [RF'R] Here the brackets [
        and ] mean a move combo (I alternate fingers to do the moves, usually
        between my ring finger and index finger) and the parenthesis ( and )
        mean a finger trick, i.e. doing all the moves listed in one hand motion.
        I do all double turns as move combos, alternating fingers to flick two
        quarter turns. Also for one handed since you are physically limited in
        speed to around 2 moves per second, you are able to look ahead much
        better than during speed solving, where you reach about 3 moves per
        second or faster. In this respect I change only my style of cubing. In
        speedcubing, for the first two layers, in order to save time I tend to
        place the first corner edge pair that I see (the fridrich method, after
        completing the cross, places the corner and edge of each slot at the
        same time). In one handed cubing I will usually try to locate all of my
        options and try to choose the fastest one for one handed (usually
        shortest moves or one where I can use a finger trick). This allows you
        to perform the solution in slightly fewer moves on average (or using
        faster moves), which helps save your hand strength over the course of a
        solve. If you're learning the Fridrich last layer I would very strongly
        recommend also learning how to do the algs one handed as well. I suggest
        this only because I had to go through each alg and "relearn" them for
        one handed after I decided to learn to use the method one handed. You
        would save time to go ahead and learn the method for speedcubing and
        also for one handed if you're interested in using this method for one
        handed solves. Hope this helps some, Chris --- In

        My view seem slightly different than what others seem to think on the
        subject. I used the 4 Look ll for over a year, my average was almost
        exactly 30s. That is an average of 50 or so cubes with none discarded
        would be 30s +-.5s, pretty exactly. I started learning the 3 look ll
        (OLLE, OLLC, PLL) about a month and a half ago, and memorized all the
        necessary algs in about a week to a week and a half. My average of 50 or
        so cubes is now around 26s +-.5s . I have knocked off over 3 seconds
        from my PB average as well as my avg avg. And about 2s from my PB solve
        ever. And the times are continuing to drop, though not quite so
        dramatically. I consider myself an average cuber, and I think a 23s
        average for an average cuber is entirely within the realm of
        possibilities using a 3 look ll. (I get a LOT of 22's and the like now).
        Below that I don't know if us average people without superhuman
        dexterity and recognition can get too much off of that, but I'd be
        willing to bet it's possible. When I hit an avg avg of about 23-24s,
        I'll probably start learnign all the OLL algs. Hope that helps! Daniel

        I got down to sub-25's with 3-Look LL before I switched to 2-look. In

        So the consensus appears to be that it's totally possible to get very
        fast times with a 3-look LL. I'm glad to hear this because I don't think
        I have the commitment at the moment to learn a full 2-look LL. ;) I did
        37.9s the other day, which is my best time on the 3x3x3. It wasn't lucky
        because there were no steps skipped, it just happened that all the LL
        algs I needed were ones that I liked (there are some others that I still
        find quite awkward to execute). I think my average is actually somewhere
        in the 50-60s range though. So I guess there's still heaps of potential
        improvement if I practise 3-look LL solves. Jasmine. --- In

        full speed, the difference between 2-look LL and 3-look LL is &gt;
        probably 1-1.5 seconds. The difference in terms of number of moves is
        &gt; also only 4.9 moves on average. I also feel that learning the 2-
        look &gt; LL only pays off when you can perform _all_ algorithms at full
        speed. &gt; So learning a 2-look LL only becomes important when you are
        already &gt; sub-30 or maybe even sub-25. &gt; &gt; LarsV &gt; &gt; ---

        are certainly not yet in my &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subconscious memory, but

        Hey! After reading about solving the cube in as few moves as possible i
        hav come to the conclusion that there should be 3 different categories:
        1) Unlimited time with unlimited number of tries - One should write down
        the scrambling algorithm so that it can be reapplied. One can follow
        several tracks and also use extra stickers to mark cubicles for
        efficient "algorithm insertion" points. This is what Mirek Goljan does
        on the 3x3x3 cube. 2) One try is allowed, with a few "take-back" moves
        along the way - No extra stickers allowed. One is allowed to take back
        some moves along the way if one regrets them. One should not use
        excessive time: ie something like 15 minutes on a 3x3x3 and 1 hr on a
        4x4x4 cube. This is the way i solve the 3x3x3 supercube (facecenters
        must be correctly oriented) 3) No take back of moves allowed at all. No
        extra stickers. - This is very strict and does not allow to take back
        moves made by mistake. This requires more careful thinking and planning
        and can ruin an otherwise god "solution track". I never follow those
        rules myself cause for sure it will ruin my average ;-) Anyone has any
        comments on this? By the way this is my first posting here. So hello
        everyone :-) --Per Kristen-- (from Norway, 38 yrs old)

        &gt; data to even guess how often this might happen given random mixes,
        but &gt; the thought is intriguing. &gt; &gt; Hmmm... Maybe if one could
        solve the cube starting from any color &gt; that they might be able to
        eventually spot any lucky mix. Sure, but only for the first X pieces,
        where X is nowhere near 20 :-) (For me, X is about 4, but sometimes 6.)
        It seems that most people using the Fridrich system always start on the
        same side. I don't believe this is necessary. For both Guimond and
        Petrus, the act of picking a good side/corner to start with is built
        into their systems. - For Guimond: pick a side that has exactly 3
        corners oriented correctly, and start there. - For Petrus: pick a corner
        that is already joined with an edge, and start there. You do not need to
        look through all 24 symmetries because these good cases just jump out at
        you. My own opening goes something like this: First, pick a good square
        to start with. Initially, I just hold the optimal solution for that
        square in my head (2-4 moves). Then I look for other pieces that can be
        easily solved (or are already solved). That means inserting some moves
        into the solution (start/middle/end). Two options: 1. the edge to make a
        2x2x2 block 2. some other corner/edge pair Or sometimes, both. This is
        made easier by the fact that when you join two pieces together, you can
        consider them as one unit. If I get a mix where there are two
        corner/edge pairs already joined, it is especially easy (my system can
        make use of any corner/edge pair). Ryan

        I'm trying to convert to a 3 look LL, but i'm taking my time learning
        new algs, and it's a bit frustrating to be inbetween 3 systems. i
        useually do a 4 look like this orient endges, position corners, orient
        corners, position edges. in my 3 look i will do orient edges, orient
        corners, permute all. if i try the 3 look and after orienting the
        corners come to an position where i dont know the alg i'm kinda stuck.
        after reading a bit on Dan K's intermediate solution page, i saw that he
        has a list over the different ways of doing the 4 look, including one
        that's like this : 31.1: orient edges(6.0), orient corners(7.9),
        position corners(8.3), position edges(8.9) Here he gives an average alg
        length of 8.3 on the position corner. since i can use my usual algs on
        the 3 other steps, and if it's just a couple of short algs to learn for
        the position of the corners, this could be a nice in between solution.
        does anyone know the algs that i need to position the corners on the LL
        without disturbing the orientation of the edges and corners ? Terje

        may want to hear my opinion. There it is: I basically go with your 3
        categories as you named them. The first and the last have already been
        here for a while. I do not know what is a good time to choose, I only
        know what is good for me :-). I suggest 10 minutes, and if the cube is
        not solved yet then ... too bad. It is hard to judge as a third party if
        the "take-back" moves are correctly processed. IMHO, 1 take-back move is
        just enough. It's a long time I haven't tried this. Has enyone beat my
        unoficial best average 41 moves in category 3? Lately, I enjoyed
        category 1 which is the weekly contest organized by Dan Harris. I hope
        he would resume the contest soon once he adjusts his schedule to his new
        university life. BTW, good luck in classes, Harris! Mirek --- In

        about solving the cube in as few moves as possible i &gt; hav come to
        the conclusion that there should be 3 different &gt; categories: &gt;
        &gt; 1) Unlimited time with unlimited number of tries &gt; &gt; - One
        should write down the scrambling algorithm so that it can be &gt;
        reapplied. One can follow several tracks and also use extra stickers
        &gt; to mark cubicles for efficient "algorithm insertion" points. This
        is &gt; what Mirek Goljan does on the 3x3x3 cube. &gt; &gt; 2) One try
        is allowed, with a few "take-back" moves along the way &gt; &gt; - No
        extra stickers allowed. One is allowed to take back some moves &gt;
        along the way if one regrets them. One should not use excessive time:
        &gt; ie something like 15 minutes on a 3x3x3 and 1 hr on a 4x4x4 cube.
        &gt; This is the way i solve the 3x3x3 supercube (facecenters must be
        &gt; correctly oriented) &gt; &gt; 3) No take back of moves allowed at
        all. No extra stickers. &gt; &gt; - This is very strict and does not
        allow to take back moves made by &gt; mistake. This requires more
        careful thinking and planning and can &gt; ruin an otherwise god
        "solution track". I never follow those rules &gt; myself cause for sure
        it will ruin my average ;-) &gt; &gt; Anyone has any comments on this?

        doing prior to getting the cube in this state is washing the pieces
        individual, and wiping down all of the gunk off of the core. Then lay
        all of the pieces down and spray one coat of silicon on, let it dry, and
        spray another on. If you can, get some silicone on all of the core's
        inner plastic pieces. Be careful not to get silicon in that seam where
        the white core meets the black plastic. Then put it together and be
        rough on it. I like doing the (RU'R) algoithm with your thumb and being
        very rough on the cube, forcing it and grinding the plastic with the
        plastic itself. Do this on all sides until it feels loose. Also I have
        found that after you lube a cube (a day or so later) if you leave it in
        the hot sun (a car dashboard) for several hours it seems to make it
        better. Perform your fastest algorithms very roughly on all combinations
        of sides over and over and it will get fast quick. -N8

        I've wondered about this myself. This is essentially the approach I take
        when I do the fewest moves challenge (only actually submitted a solution
        once so far, but ...). I was thinking it'd be cool to write up a program
        that would apply a standard Fridrich method to random cube states in all
        24 directions. Another thing you could do is try going through the F2L
        c/e pairs in the different possible orders. Then, you could give the
        program a bunch of scrambles, and see how it does. With 24 cube
        orientations to start from, plus doing c/e pairs in all possible paths,
        you have as many as 24x4x3x2=576 potential different outcomes. Surely at
        least a couple of these have to be fairly lucky! &gt; Hmmm... Maybe if
        one could solve the cube starting from any color &gt; that they might be
        able to eventually spot any lucky mix. I would have to say, I doubt it.
        Unless you are able to skip a step fairly early on in your solution
        (e.g. putting in 1 or 2 F2L pairs with the cross), I'd think that there
        must be too much that changes on the cube to be able to tell from the
        starting position whether you can skip a later step in your solution. -

        As others have said or hinted at already, if you can get it into a 2x2x2
        setup quickly, then the rest should come quickly. Unfortunately, in
        trying this approach so far, I haven't found any good way of getting to
        that point. That doesn't mean there isn't one, but I don't see it. Think
        of it this way - since the first of the solution would be to solve the
        2x2x2 blocks (surrounding the corners), you are solving the edges and
        centers in relation to the corner pieces. This sounds remarkably similar
        to a corners first approach. Now, granted, the corners don't have to be
        solved first, or even stay in the same relationship to each other during
        the solution, but it's pretty much the same thing. Chris' idea of
        creating 2x2x1 sections sounded interesting at first, but even with
        that, you seem to very quickly get too many separate groups to
        reasonably keep track of. Unless you have incredibly fast fingers/mind,
        like Masayuki (who uses somewhat of a corners first approach), you're
        probably better off using the typical approach of centers first, pair
        edges, solve like 3x3x3, and fix parity (as needed). Another approach
        I've played with (though more for fun than as a serious endeavor to find
        a good solution), is to build a 2x2x2, extend it to a 2x2x3, then a
        2x3x3, then a 3x3x3, then a 3x3x4, etc. It's just a bit of a mind
        exercise. - Grant --- Ton wrote: &gt; If it is in a 2x2x2 form it would
        be faster to solve [snip] &gt; The real problem is the centers it would
        be very hard to see, since &gt; this looks like a mixed pattern this
        would require a new method and a &gt; lot of training. &gt; &gt; I guess
        the best 2x2x2 type method would be a corners first system, &gt; but
        this is some thing else as 2x2x2 segments --- Chris wrote: &gt; My gut

        [snip] &gt; One thing I'm thinking is to build 2x2x1 sections all the

        idea, but could anyone &gt; out there help me rationalize this properly?
        I also wonder if &gt; anyone has tried solving the 4x4 in this manner.

        noticed is that they didn't divide the corner part by 2 because you cant

        HI Jake, Oh that explanation threw me once, too! The "you can't swap
        just two corners," and the "you can't swap just two edges" rules only
        need to be accounted for once. The reason is that although you can't do
        either one alone you can do them together: you can swap two corners and
        two edges at the same time. Those two rules are really only one
        limitation. If you were to take the cube apart and physically switch two
        corners, put the cube back together, then solve the two corners you
        could solve everything else but for two edges. So in that altered state
        you can have either two edges out or two corners out, so that means "two
        edges out" and "two corners out" are the same thing. Therefore you only
        need to account for the "two" limitations once. Also there is a
        little-known tie-in with the centers. In a normal cube you can swap two
        pairs of centers, but not one pair, and you can't take four centers and
        move them one side over and solve the rest of the cube. The second part
        is the same thing as the corner/edge swap discussed above. Again, take
        the cube apart and switch two corners, then solve the two corners. You
        now have two edges out. Put those two edges in place by swapping two
        second level edges. Leaving the top and bottom centers alone, move the
        remaining four centers one side to the right or left, then you can solve
        the second layer edges. Instead of having two corners or two edges out
        of place you end up with all the corners and edges correctly placed in
        relation to one another, but only the top and bottom centers are in
        place. Good question. David J --- In

        Well, with an avrg of 48, I can't really compare either, but here's what
        I found helps: 1. Get a half decent cube-You can have a great solving
        method that only takes 60 turns, but if you plan on breaking 60 seconds,
        you've got to be able to turn more than 1 turn a second. 2. Don't go
        full speed- If you're twisting the cube like mad trying to put in one
        piece, the cube will "lock up" and you won't be able to turn at all and
        you won't be able to see ahead as to what you're doing 3. Don't just
        learn the algorithms, but learn how they work too- that way, if you get
        lost you can pick back up on what you're doing and you can optimize the
        algs to you're personal preferences. 4. Learn ALL the algs you can- For
        the longest time I only knew about 5 algs. (up to 6 or 7 looks on the
        LL) durring that time I had a best time of about a minute. Now I know
        about 15 LL algs (3-4 look LL) and my best time has dropped over 20
        seconds. 5. Practice, practice, practice...can't get too much practice
        the more practice you get the faster you go...no way around it. Hope
        this helps ~4|\|])`/ |3 lieberz2@... wrote: Anybody wanna give me some

        honestly i wouldn't worry about it. if it were me, then if i didn't know
        the algs to finish then i'd just start a new mix. not big deal. but to
        answer your question, you can visit Jessica's page at
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html and you can look
        at the "A" corner permutation and the "E" corner permutation. but
        unfortunately that's not quite enough... since you are permuting corners
        before permuting edges, you have to realize that you may need to swap
        only 2 corners, but there is no way to do this without also permuting 2
        edges. so you need to learn 2 other cases besides "A" and "E": one case
        for swapping 2 diagonal corners and one case for swapping 2 adjacent
        corners. i would choose "J" for 2 adjacent corners and "Y" for 2
        diagonal corners. note that "J" and "Y" also swap 2 edges. this is no
        big deal because you will permute edges in your last step, and so you
        can ignore this "side effect" for now. of course you need to learn the
        inverse of "A" too unless you don't mind doing it twice when needed.
        that's alot of algs (A, A', E, J, and Y) just to permute corners, but
        these are all algs you'll need to learn anyways to eventually permute
        everything at once. switching systems is a pain. good luck! -eric --- In

        The formula for the compleet cube is 12! x 2^12 * 8!x 3^8 For the edges
        you have to divide by 2, it is not possible to have one edge fliped this
        is the 12! x 2^11 part For the corners you have to divide by 3, it is
        not possible to have one corner fliped this is the part 8!x 3^7 part
        Then there is a symetry between the edges and corners that is there is
        no odd permutation, if two corners are swaped, then there will be two at
        least edges swaped this is the /2part Together this means this is you
        assemble the cube at random you will have 2 x 3 x 2 = 12 possible
        outcomes, so at random only 1 out of 12 you can solve Just try! you will

        I'm going to be the pessimist for a minute... Unfortunately, not
        everyone is likely to (or even can for that matter) achieve such fast
        times with a 3 look LL (or even at all). I don't mean to be a spoil-
        sport, but I feel that some people just don't have the ability to get
        that fast, whether it is because of a lack of dexterity, memory, or time
        to devote to practice and learning. Granted, some of these can be
        overcome by practice, but practice and devotion only go so far. With a 3
        look LL, try as I might, I was unable to bring my average consistently
        below the 30 second barrier. I was consistently in the range of 31-33
        seconds. I have resigned myself to the fact (okay, opinion, I know),
        that I will not likely ever average much better than 25 seconds. Of
        course, a few years ago, I was convinced that the same was true about
        the 90 second barrier, so I realize that this may not actually be a true
        limit for me either. That said, don't give up hope! I found (back when I
        had a solid 3 look LL) that I needed as much as a second for recognition
        and 3-4 seconds for execution of each LL alg (4 is probably a little
        high, but maybe 3.5). That means that with a 3 look LL, I would take
        between 12 and 15 seconds for the LL. I haven't actually timed the
        different parts of a solve lately, but when I was averaging just over
        30, using a 3 look LL, that was pretty much where I was; 12-14 seconds
        on the LL was pretty normal. So if each look was taking me 4- 4.5
        seconds, it would stand to reason that learning a 2 look LL would cut
        4-4.5 seconds from my time. Now, I'm less than 10 cases away from a 2
        look LL, and my most recent average was 27.81. There may only be 1-1.5
        seconds difference between 2-look and 3-look for someone who solves in
        under 20 seconds, but the benefits can be much greater for someone who
        takes 30 seconds or more. So, can you achieve fast times with a 3-look
        LL? Maybe... It all depends on the person. Is it worth it to learn all
        the algs involved in a 2-look LL? Again, it all depends on the person.
        If doing so could shave off 5-10% of your time, and you have the time,
        desire, and ability to do so, then I'd say go for it. If, however, you
        have a 3-look LL that takes less than 15 seconds, and you're still not
        averaging under 40, it's probably time to work on the F2L instead. Just
        hang in there... Back when I had a 4-look LL, I didn't think I wanted to
        spend the time on learning a 2-look LL, either, but now I'm almost
        there, and I'm thinking about what to work on next! - Grant --- Jasmine

        I haven't been able to read every post in regards to 3-look speeds, so
        forgive me if I go over something that's already been covered. If you
        want to be a fast cuber, and you are using the fridrichs method, I think
        it depends what level you are at. For example: If you are using a 4-look
        and F2L and your times are averaging over 50 seconds, your LL isn't the
        problem. I've not mastered the cube, but I think the F2L is the most
        important thing to improve on. Not only that, it seems that a lot of
        people have much room for improvement in this area too. I've been able
        to achieve 26-27 second averages semi-consistently with a 3-look. I'm
        not too concerned about my LL until my F2L is faster. my 2 cents..thnx

        Thanks for posting these articles Grant. Does anyone else think it's
        funny (in a cute way) that so many newspaper articles use quote marks
        around words and phrases that are part of our everyday language, but
        obviously are a little strange to others? Some examples I can think of
        are "cubers", "speedcubers", "lubing the cube" and "finger tricks". It's
        not until I read these things (or hear someone laugh when I talk about
        lubing the cube) that I am reminded that not everyone has these terms as
        part of their everyday vocabulary! Jasmine. --- In

        I think you're probably right, Grant, when you say that not everyone
        will be able to achieve superfast times with a 3-look LL.
        Superspeedcubers like DanK and LarsV (and others) obviously can, but
        these guys were 1st and 4th at RWC -- so we know that they are both
        *really good cubers*! There were quite a few replies to my original
        question (thanks guys!) and it was good to learn that the top cubers in
        the world can indeed get sub-20s times with a 3-look LL. It was also
        nice to know that some people average 30s+ with this method. I guess I
        was really after a range of times that different people get with a
        3-look LL so the replies have been very helpful. I think I've still got
        a fair way to go. I'm not too concerned at the moment though because I
        know that algs usually take a while to firmly implant themselves in my
        head. And I know that I can never perform algs at full speed until they
        move from my short-term memory into my subconscious memory. None of the
        new LL algs I've learnt in the last month are in my subconscious memory
        yet. I've practised them enough that I don't really have trouble
        remembering them, but they aren't yet second nature, I still need to
        think about them while I'm executing them. Jasmine. --- In

        minute... Unfortunately, not &gt; everyone is likely to (or even can for

        all). I don't mean to be a spoil- &gt; sport, but I feel that some
        people just don't have the ability to get &gt; that fast, whether it is
        because of a lack of dexterity, memory, or &gt; time to devote to
        practice and learning. Granted, some of these can &gt; be overcome by
        practice, but practice and devotion only go so far. &gt; &gt; With a 3
        look LL, try as I might, I was unable to bring my average &gt;
        consistently below the 30 second barrier. I was consistently in the &gt;
        range of 31-33 seconds. I have resigned myself to the fact (okay, &gt;
        opinion, I know), that I will not likely ever average much better &gt;
        than 25 seconds. Of course, a few years ago, I was convinced that &gt;
        the same was true about the 90 second barrier, so I realize that this
        &gt; may not actually be a true limit for me either. &gt; &gt; That
        said, don't give up hope! I found (back when I had a solid 3 &gt; look
        LL) that I needed as much as a second for recognition and 3-4 &gt;
        seconds for execution of each LL alg (4 is probably a little high, &gt;
        but maybe 3.5). That means that with a 3 look LL, I would take &gt;
        between 12 and 15 seconds for the LL. I haven't actually timed the &gt;
        different parts of a solve lately, but when I was averaging just over
        &gt; 30, using a 3 look LL, that was pretty much where I was; 12-14 &gt;
        seconds on the LL was pretty normal. So if each look was taking me 4-
        &gt; 4.5 seconds, it would stand to reason that learning a 2 look LL
        would &gt; cut 4-4.5 seconds from my time. Now, I'm less than 10 cases
        away &gt; from a 2 look LL, and my most recent average was 27.81. There
        may &gt; only be 1-1.5 seconds difference between 2-look and 3-look for
        &gt; someone who solves in under 20 seconds, but the benefits can be
        much &gt; greater for someone who takes 30 seconds or more. &gt; &gt;
        So, can you achieve fast times with a 3-look LL? Maybe... It all &gt;
        depends on the person. Is it worth it to learn all the algs involved
        &gt; in a 2-look LL? Again, it all depends on the person. If doing so
        &gt; could shave off 5-10% of your time, and you have the time, desire,
        &gt; and ability to do so, then I'd say go for it. If, however, you have
        &gt; a 3-look LL that takes less than 15 seconds, and you're still not
        &gt; averaging under 40, it's probably time to work on the F2L instead.
        &gt; &gt; Just hang in there... Back when I had a 4-look LL, I didn't
        think I &gt; wanted to spend the time on learning a 2-look LL, either,
        but now I'm &gt; almost there, and I'm thinking about what to work on
        next! &gt; &gt; - Grant &gt; &gt; --- Jasmine wrote: &gt; &gt; So the

        Haha the cube lingo is definately a funny one. Me and my friend got
        talking one day in a crowded place and some of our non cubing friends
        try and follow our conversations. One got so confused that he/she said
        that we made up all these words and phrases to make ourselves look smart
        hehehe. I like to think of cubing as a second language. The notation
        especially. Some people look at it and say "I think you need to take a

        edges orientation before the end of F2L ("Petrich"). - 2x2x3 - 7 edges
        orientation (about 5 moves) - 2x3x3 using only 2 sides (very fast) - LL
        corners orientation (6 easy algs) - LL permutation (13 algs) With this
        method, I've been sub-20 and my dexterity is not very good, I think
        sub-18 is possible. And you still can switch to standard F2L+OLL+PLL
        later. Gilles.

        This is useful feedback Richard. Thanks. I know that my F2L definitely
        needs improvement. On Jessica's site there's a table which says that an
        average F2L is 35 moves (7 + 4x7), which is about what I'm averaging so
        I'm assuming I've got the algs roughly right (I worked out F2L by
        myself). However, in the same table it says it's possible to solve F2L
        in 10 seconds (2 + 4x2) -- this is the part I'm having trouble with,
        it's taking me much longer than 10s! With LL, my recognition and
        execution times were better than with my F2L, but since I was using a
        4-look (sometimes 5-look) LL, I was just using too many moves to solve.
        So, I'm thinking that for now I'll focus on practising looking ahead
        during F2L to eliminate time wasted finding the next F2L pair, and
        improve LL by using a 3-look LL instead of 4 or 5-look LL. Jasmine. ---

        I read a long thread about knuckle cracking on the forum on Kam's
        website, the guy that does the crazy pen spinning on superhandz.com.
        Their consensus was that if you crack your knuckles it's probably not
        that bad, but if you crack them a lot, expecially before performing
        something that takes dexterity (i.e. spinning a pen/doing the cube/
        etc.) that you may feel slower and clumbsier if you do that thing
        without cracking your knuckles before hand. I think opinions will always
        vary about this. I used to crack my knuckles incessantly in elementary
        school but I stopped before middle school and haven't done it since. I
        don't really know if it's bad or not but the thread on Kam's page was
        interesting to read. Chris --- In

        Thanks. I know that my F2L &gt; definitely needs improvement. On
        Jessica's site there's a table which &gt; says that an average F2L is 35
        moves (7 + 4x7), which is about what &gt; I'm averaging so I'm assuming
        I've got the algs roughly right (I &gt; worked out F2L by myself).
        However, in the same table it says it's &gt; possible to solve F2L in 10
        seconds (2 + 4x2) -- this is the part I'm &gt; having trouble with, it's
        taking me much longer than 10s! &gt; &gt; With LL, my recognition and
        execution times were better than with my &gt; F2L, but since I was using
        a 4-look (sometimes 5-look) LL, I was just &gt; using too many moves to
        solve. &gt; &gt; So, I'm thinking that for now I'll focus on practising
        looking ahead &gt; during F2L to eliminate time wasted finding the next
        F2L pair, and &gt; improve LL by using a 3-look LL instead of 4 or
        5-look LL. &gt; &gt; Jasmine. The best advice for the F2L is to slow
        down until you can do it with now delays. Practice at that speed for a
        while and then slowly build speed without introducing delays. I find
        that the F2L goes much faster and smoother for me while "going slowly"
        than if I try to go really fast. Jon

        i was thinking about the timing devices from the world championships,
        and while i thought they were adequate, it seems to me that something
        better could be built. i work with design/build shops who fabricate
        embedded electronic systems every day, so i was contemplating building a
        prototype. the issues with the wc timers that i saw were the following:
        timing shouldn't start when you move your hands before you even pick up
        the cube. you shouldn't be required to "drop" the cube for the timing to
        end. how did the timing devices work at the 1982 championships? what
        physical movement do you think should start and end official rubik's
        cube solving times? i think most would agree that videotaping yourself
        and counting the frames between the first twist and the last twist is
        not a good representation of your solving time. i would also argue that
        moving your hands off a pair of yellow dots should not be when timing
        begins. should the presence of the cube on the timing device start/stop
        the timing? it seems to me this is the most logical. if you go this
        route, there are numerous design: 1. mechanical switch measuring the
        weight of the cube on a platform, 2. photo diode measuring the ambient
        light above the sensor, 3. capacitive proximity sensor, 4. convergent
        reflective photoelectric sensor. if you have opinions, please share
        them.

        Hi Eric, I basically agree with you. In the Canadian &amp; U.S. contests
        from 1982 Ideal Toy used pads with a photo-sensor. Also the WC1982 had a
        similar type of device... You pick the cube up the timer starts, and
        stops when you put the cube down. At WC2003 some cubists would actually
        drop the cube on the floor in an effort to slap their hands down as fast
        as possible. Even so I'd say the timers were at least serviceable... I'm
        sure the times were _slightly_ slower with this style of timer. It's a
        compromise between the big money days with Ideal paying $$$ for custom
        timers versus the current situation with much smaller volumes of cubes
        being sold. Perhaps there's a cheap way to build a better timer. Mark On

        great. thanks for the info. do you have any idea what the pads in 1982
        were made of? was it a soft "mouse-pad" with a little hole in it for the
        photo sensor? or was it a hard plastic platform with a hole in it? do

        I was recently contacted by a local newspaper about doing an interview
        or Q&amp;A as they call it. So I asked where they heard of me from and
        he said he read an article about me in a magazine. So I was like, WHAT!,
        when did I ever give such permission? Well I dropped by a store this
        morning and picked up an issue of this Asian Pop Culture magazine based
        in CA ("GiantRobot" magagzine). It features an article about 4 cubists
        Minh Thai, Dan Knights, Jessica Fridrich, an me (there was quick mention
        of Wesley also). It was even the first bullet on the front cover
        ("Masters of the Rubik's Cube")! This place e-mailed me one or twice
        like 4 months ago so I thought they forgot about it. But to my suprise
        they ran with it, and some stuff that I thought was just between me and
        this guy was in the article, some of which is exaggerated, some was not
        how I wanted it to sound, but whatever. I thought it was a sort of
        pre-interview thing for him to draw questions from not that actual
        interview. I decided to take some scans of it and post it for you guys,
        I wanted very high resolution (but well compressed) but didn't want to
        use up our precious file storage space on this fourm... so I uploaded it
        to my site. This is also so that the other people like DanK, JF, and
        people can keep track of where they have been mentioned in the media.
        You'll find it here at the following precise URL, 4 and 1/2 pages (the
        first a Characature of MT, 2.5 of MT and one page on 3 contemporary
        cubists), all of suitable quality resolution. BTW they decided to use me
        probably because I 'am' Asian, even though there are tons of cubers
        faster then me out there, ops I mean *here*.
        http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/GiantRobot/ It's just a directory, I
        didn't bother to caption it and stuff properly. Be sure to get both
        parts of the link if it splits, since I havn't linked it off my main
        site (that is painfully under updated). It's a new issue of a magazine

        Hem... I'm usually able to find good lube at any convenience store.... I
        just head straight for the automotive department. Look for the word
        synthetic and don't touch those that read petroleum or petroleum-based.
        I have good sucess at my local K-Marts btw.
        Multi-Purpose/General-Purpose is also a good indicator. Hope this helps;
        I wouldn't order lube from online if I were you, the shipping itself
        would make it too expensive. -Doug --- In

        Great site! I myself have a 112 second average, but today i got a 97.02

        Nice article. Seeing Jeff Varasano in that group pic really brings back
        memories. Unfortunately I never got to met Jeff, but it was the Varasano

        Hi evreybody! I have some kind of a big problem with my cube... I think
        everybody has already had this problem before, but I haven't stop
        practicing more for more than one month. The cube I use is a very good
        one (but I don't know which type of cube it is), but the colors start to
        whiten... Can anybody tell me what I can do on my next cube, that I
        don't have to buy a new one every 5 weeks? An other thing I want to say,
        is that I live in France, and that most of you guys live in America, in
        the Netherlands or in some place of Eastern Europe. And I must tell,
        almost nobody here can do the cube... For example, in my school, I'm the
        only one who can even solve it, and I don't speak of speedsolving. Ok,
        that's quite impressive for the others to look at me solving it, but I
        just want to say I find it quite stupid cube hasn't become a national
        'sport' here like it seems to be elsewhere... I don't even know any
        French cubist in my area, and I live near Paris... But this isn't really
        interesting, the interesting part of this post was the first one, and I
        would be glad if anybody could give me some tips... Thanks, Fran√ßois

        First of all, I don't think the Cube has become a national sport
        anywhere. (Well except maybe Hungary in some point in history for
        economic reasons.) Secondly, there are PLENTY of French cubers, some of
        our fastest are French. Heck, there was even a national championship in
        France over the summer. There is a French version of this cube fourm
        also... (not sure what the name of it is precisely). I hope that helps.

        quote the lines that bother you so that we may judge for ourselves. I
        havn't actually read it all in its entirety, but judging from the e-mail
        interview on the wc site, he's just trying to give a consevative look at
        it all and how the pressure of competition does indeed cause
        significantly slower times in many cases. I didn't notice anything
        remotely offensive that he said in the article (and I pick up on these
        things, lol). At some point he does say that he doesn't believe that the
        cube can be done in 20s average in compititon. But that's perfectly OK,
        A) it's his opionion (he used the word "believe") and B) it hasn't been
        shown in compeitition yet (DanK didn't average &lt;20s he did 20.00s
        ignoring the statisical triming), C) this article was written before the
        WC and the article doesn't even mention it so MT can freely make such
        statements. The records list we are all used to is called UNOFFICIAL for
        good reasons. But, yes, yes, I am aware that MT should be aware of other
        cubists like JeffV and Pergl among his contemporaries who were also
        amazingly fast that may disprove his claims. I think it is better this
        way actually - that people don't go up to the media and be all like
        "it's possible to average 15s in compition" or 10s or 9s.... This makes

        i don't care for the SNAP silicone. i also tried prestone silicone and
        that's not the greatest either (although both are much better than
        nothing). the problem i had with these is that the propellant takes too
        long to evaporate and your cube is stiff for hours after lubricating.
        the best i found was from a company called "Castle" and it is 100% pure
        silicone lubricant. the Castle silicone uses a propellant that
        evaporates almost instantly. you can literally spray it in the edge-
        peice hole, blow in the hole for about a minute, and start cubing. with
        SNAP brand, my cube is usually stiff for hours while the propellant
        evaporates. i was able to buy the Castle silicon at aubochon's hardware
        store. i'm sure everyone here has their favorite brand of silicone, so
        this is only a suggestion. --- In

        can see her solving video here.
        http://casty.jp/hikarisou/index_guest.php?owner_id=4142 She will be on
        somewhere in main page on Octber 13th 15:00-22:00 (GMT+9:00). (Oct 13th
        2:00-9:00 EST) Main page is here
        http://casty.jp/hikarisou/index_madori.php In the current video, she
        says... "Hello," "I am a speedcubist Kyoko Watanabe." "I am going to
        solve this. " .....Solving rubik's cube.(approx. 58 sec).... "I will
        practice to be able to solve much faster." "Thanks" Acutually, this
        event is her 2nd appearance on the net, but I missed the 1st one. So I
        don't know the detail but I believe it must be like Jess's marathon live

        Hi all Just wanted to thank whoever gave me the advice on the 7x7x7 cube
        - working with adjacent sides helped - especially when I discovered an
        alg with the general property of exchanging any two "center" pieces (ie
        any two pieces which belong to two adjacent inner n-2xn-2 center
        pieces). I was also wondering whether anyone felt like giving me some
        competition in the 3x3x2 and 3x2x2 categories... You guessed it: my
        3x3x3 has reached a plateau and I'm trying out new things - strangely, I
        had a 4 day break and, contrary to many, my average shot up from 27s to
        29s - I'm back down under 27 again after two good hour sessions -
        trouble is, just solving the cube isn't good enough training any more!
        I'm on 8s for cross + first pair. If can hit 5s by going a bit slower
        and finding the pair quicker, I'll be below 25s cool! Has anyone who's
        been practicing looking for the next pair while placing the current pair
        ever managed to "find" the pair he was currently placing - and get
        thouroughly confused, like me?! Enough babble from me seeya Greg

        Pretty much the only silicone i've used is Prestone brand. But i think
        it works pretty good, it only takes maybe 5 minutes for it to dry.
        Sometimes i just keep mixing the cube and that helps it dry, or pop out
        a piece and blow into the cube. Walmart around here always has some. it
        should be back by the tools in the section with the other aerosol stuff.
        if you cant find it then you can always ask somebody... I want to know

        It's not just the brand of silicone that can make a difference. I've
        found that the same brand of silicone applied to different brands of
        cubes will have different results. Silicone always helps, but it doesn't
        help as much on some cubes. I personally prefer to have a very
        loose/smooth cube, otherwise it bothers my wrists. I didn't find anyone
        else with a cube quite like mine in Toronto. In fact, several people
        (including LarsV :) teased me about how loose my cube was! :) Jasmine.

        I would say about half the total time should be devoted to F2L half to
        LL, assuming a system with disjoint F2L and LL steps. I found this to be
        a good rule of thumb... For three look it should be almost the same.
        This rule starts to break down at sub-20 when sometimes it is more like
        12s F2L and 8s LL. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Ok, This is what I was able to discern from watching the WC1982 video on
        Ron van Bruchem's site, and also re-watching the Canadian Championships
        of 1982: There was a white podium with a raised black square on the top.
        Cubists had 15 seconds inspection time, same as in WC2003. A judge, Mr.
        Sanderson, would cover the cube with his hand and when he removed is
        hand the cubist would pick up the cube and the timer would start. This
        was similar to WC2003 but not exactly the same. At the Canadian
        Championships I found something very similar, except the timer pad was
        thicker and looked like it was made from metal, with the top of the pad
        being black. In those days I can't recall anyone using mouse pads, and
        definitely mouse pads were not used for the pad timers in 1982. At the
        Canadian Championships the judge did not cover the cube with his hand,
        the cubist would simply pick the cube up from the table. There was a
        long red dot matrix display which was connected to the timer pad by a
        cable. This was different than WC2003 since a 7-segment display was
        used. Actually I think the 7-segment display is much easier to see, and
        easier to film. My understanding is that Ideal Toy had the pads build
        custom for the North American cube contests, both for the U.S. and
        Canada. Of course Ideal Toy is long gone now, so I am not 100% sure if
        the pad had a photo sensor or was pressure sensitive, but I think there
        was a small hole in the pad. To answer your question about the pad, I
        think the pad should be something relatively hard. My recollection is
        that the timer pads used in the U.S. and Canada had a black plastic top.
        In the Canadian video I could see that the pad was enclosed by metal,
        possibly aluminium. If someone has a video of the "That's Incredible"
        episodes from 1981 and 1982 they could possibly confirm if the timer
        pads were the same ones which were used in Canada. Mark On Thursday 09

        info. &gt; &gt; do you have any idea what the pads in 1982 were made of?

        sensor? or &gt; was it a hard plastic platform with a hole in it? &gt;
        &gt; do you think the pad where the cube is placed before/after solving

        No, that doesn't make sense. There are 12 F2L pieces and 8 LL pieces...
        The 12 to 8 ratio (3:2) I gave accidently agrees with this more then

        For a sub-20 cuber, 10 seconds are spent for the F2L and 7 for the LL.
        That's only an average with the Fridrich method, and assuming you use a
        2-look LL. In my case (since I'm 15.4 seconds) the F2L takes about
        9.4-9.5 seconds and the LL takes 6 or just under that. That's about a
        3:2 ratio for time spent on the F2L to the time spent on the LL. It does

        Jessica's website. I find most of the time I use less then 21 in the LL
        with my CLL/ELL approach, except for about 30% of the time I'm using
        almost double that number. I suppose it averages out. I don't think the
        35 estimate is good for the F2L. I am on average able to solve and F2L
        in 2-3 turms less then that using the Fridrich system by choosing the
        order of which edge to place first, second, third, ... and by using
        slant pairing if necessary. And even less using my own system when
        comparing in Slice Count Metric. This is not to say that my method is
        better, my method requires way too much recognition. -Doug

        About a week ago I was contacted by Seven Towns, asking if they could
        pass on my email address to the Australian distributor of Rubik's
        puzzles as they were interested in talking to speedcubers in Australia
        as part of their marketing campaign. Of course I said yes, and that I
        was very happy to be involved in promoting cubing in Australia! I heard
        back from the Australian distributor today and they asked if I knew
        other speedcubers in Australia who'd also be interested. I don't think
        they have a specific plan of what they might want from us yet, but I
        guess they're working on it. And it might depend on how many Australia
        speedcubers they can find. Anyway, I know there aren't many Australians
        in this group, but I there are a few (eg. Ryan H). Email me if you are
        interested and I'll pass on your details. Jasmine.

        was able to discern from watching the &gt; WC1982 video on Ron van
        Bruchem's site, and also &gt; re-watching the Canadian Championships of
        1982: &gt; &gt; There was a white podium with a raised black square &gt;
        on the top. Cubists had 15 seconds inspection time, &gt; same as in
        WC2003. A judge, Mr. Sanderson, would &gt; cover the cube with his hand
        and when he removed &gt; is hand the cubist would pick up the cube and
        the &gt; timer would start. This was similar to WC2003 but not &gt;
        exactly the same. &gt; &gt; At the Canadian Championships I found
        something &gt; very similar, except the timer pad was thicker and &gt;
        looked like it was made from metal, with the top of &gt; the pad being
        black. In those days I can't recall &gt; anyone using mouse pads, and
        definitely mouse &gt; pads were not used for the pad timers in 1982.
        &gt; At the Canadian Championships the judge did not &gt; cover the cube
        with his hand, the cubist would &gt; simply pick the cube up from the
        table. &gt; &gt; There was a long red dot matrix display which was
        connected &gt; to the timer pad by a cable. This was different than &gt;
        WC2003 since a 7-segment display was used. Actually &gt; I think the
        7-segment display is much easier to see, &gt; and easier to film. &gt;
        &gt; My understanding is that Ideal Toy had the pads &gt; build custom
        for the North American cube contests, &gt; both for the U.S. and Canada.
        Of course Ideal Toy &gt; is long gone now, so I am not 100% sure if the
        &gt; pad had a photo sensor or was pressure sensitive, &gt; but I think
        there was a small hole in the pad. &gt; &gt; To answer your question
        about the pad, I think the pad &gt; should be something relatively hard.
        My recollection &gt; is that the timer pads used in the U.S. and Canada
        &gt; had a black plastic top. In the Canadian video I could see &gt;
        that the pad was enclosed by metal, possibly aluminium. &gt; &gt; If
        someone has a video of the "That's Incredible" episodes &gt; from 1981
        and 1982 they could possibly confirm if the &gt; timer pads were the
        same ones which were used in &gt; Canada. &gt; &gt; Mark &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Does the temperature of a cube affect how well it performs? It's gotten
        colder lately, and I've found that my cube has gotten stiffer. I did a
        sort of experiment, and put my speedcube in the freezer. It didn't

        thanks for your answers. @Heath: i know about ton's cubes, but as you
        said they're out of stock. and also buying from rubiks.com isn't that a
        good idea, because the shipping cost is immense. @Michael Atkinson: but
        if the stickers are that bad, where can i get new one, let me guess on
        rubiks.com? Or is perhaps someone out there who can sell me some
        stickers? @Gilles: but i thought, that the new cubes have no springs
        anymore? or was it that they have no screws anymore? But if there are no
        screws how can i prepare the cube for speedcubing? I loosed the screws
        on my old one a bit, so it was a really good cube till it broke.

        i think everyone varies on this. i like the small amount of resistance
        that is caused by room-temperature silicone lubricant. some probably
        like a very slippery cube. one of my cubes is made of really hard
        plastic and after you lube it, the thing is so slippery it flops all
        over the place when you're trying to hold it-- i can hardly use it for
        speed-cubing. it's not worn out (i.e. the corners don't rattle), just
        slippery. although it's great for demonstrating to someone how slippery
        a cube can be made. -eric --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        yes. but... there's no telling how long it will take the existing
        inventory of cubes with paper stickers to be used up. so eventually, you
        will find that new cubes use the pvc stickers. i would guess that hasn't
        happened yet because the stickers were just redesigned this year. if you
        buy stickers-only from rubiks.com, they will definitely be the pvc ones,
        because they used up the last of the remaining paper stickers stock at
        the 2003 championships. (the people who restickered first at the
        championships got paper stickers, and people who waited until later to
        resticker found the newer pvc stickers). i've found that it's pretty
        hard to tell the difference between the paper and pvc stickers without
        touching them. -eric --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi, For the last three months, I've been trying a significantly
        different method (http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html). Speeding up
        was very difficult in the beginning, most of my times lying in the
        40s-50s range. But I was happy, because it's good to be a beginner! :-)
        I'm getting faster now, with a best average of 22.8s, and a best time of
        15s (not "lucky", but it's an outlier, statistically speaking). I've
        still got a lot to learn (corner algs and others), but it looks good,
        so... next milestone for the next three months: 20s (before I decide to
        switch to another method, again :-) ) Happy cubing, Gilles.

        Hi everyone, I just wanted to let you all know of something very
        exciting for everyone. Disney World is opening a new resort on December
        14th, 2003 (Sunday) called Pop Century. It has 2880 rooms (starting at
        only $77/night) and the buildings are each four stories tall. There are
        sections of this resort that are dedicated to different pop icons of the
        20th century. So far, the 50's through the 90's are ready to be opend
        (they actually have been ready since February, but because of the
        economy, Disney is waiting until December to open it). The 1900's thru
        40's will open eventually. Those buildings are all built but they need
        to be decorated. Each building of each decade has phrases on it (for
        example, the 50's section says stuff like "Be-Bop" and "Craaazy, Man")
        and also larger-than-life size objects. Click on the link to see what I
        mean.
        http://images.google.com/images?q=pop+century&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;hl=en
        You will see some large bowling pins. They are 65 ft. tall. There are 9
        of them, and the tenth one is a bowling-pin shaped pool. Next to the
        pool, the ground looks like a bowling alley with the same type of wood
        texture and the arrows to aim the ball toward the pins. That's creative,
        and the everything from the decades are somehow shown in each section of
        the resort. If you notice toward the bottom of the link, there is one
        picture with a 4-story tall Rubik's Cube. What's that doing there? That
        was one of the big icons of the 80's, so Disney "imagineers" (the ones
        who thought of how to decorate this place and other resorts and theme
        parks) thought that they should put up six giant cubes in the 80's
        section. The first one is totally random and the way it's supposed to be
        is that as you walk around the building, the cubes progressively get
        closer to being solved, and eventually the last cube is solved. I didn't
        get to check whether the positions of the cubes are possible or not, but
        the D faces on the cubes don't even exist (they are replaced by stands
        to hold up the cubes), but anyway it's a creative thing. The cube in
        that picture from Pop Century is the solved one and next to it is some
        kind of phone or walkie-talkie. Last week there was a major press event
        in Disney World, and they saw the article of me on rubikschamps.com, and
        thought they should invite me for this! I left last Tuesday, and left
        Saturday afternoon. So Friday morning on the 10th, I had to be awake at
        3:40 a.m. to be at Pop Century by 5 for the morning news shows. For 7
        hours I was busy cubing and answering questions about the cube. After
        four hours of sleep, little time to warm up, hands on the cold side, and
        some pressure, I was getting times around 16-21 seconds. Not bad. I was
        on some local channels in Orlando, Tampa, North Carolina, Wisconsin,
        Minnesota, and some other states (I don;t remember since I had too many
        interviews!) and one Spanish channel. Since I arrived early (at 4:30) I
        went all the way over to see the cubes. It's a bit of a long walk (huge
        resort!) but it was fun. Also during the 3-day event two new attractions
        opened. At Magic Kingdom, a new 3D show called Philhar Magic started to
        play. At Epcot, a new ride called Mission Space opened. It was open a
        few days before the press event but on Thursday night there were some
        former astronauts from Apollo missions and NASA who dedicated the ride.
        For this, Epcot closed early that day to prepare it for the night. Only
        guests were allowed to go, and I was one of them. Later, Sugar Ray and
        the B-52's played a concert but I was busy doing Test Track (great ride,
        you all have to do it! I actually have it on tape and might put it on my
        site!) The great thing about Mission Space though is that astronauts
        tried it out and it "passed the authenticity test" meaning the forces
        are realistic, just like astronauts have to go thru in training, but you
        only stay in one place! While experiencing some g-forces, a screen plays
        a movie like you're travelling thru space, and I heard it's incredibly
        realistic. If you're prone to motion sickness, don't do it!!! I think
        I'm talking a little too much now, but soon I will have the whole story
        posted on my site with pictures and a few video clips, but if you have
        any questions about Pop Century or the trip I went on then email me
        (rubiks1938@...) and I'll respond. Andy

        Ideal cubes from the 1980's have screws that can be adjusted. There were
        a few hundred million of them made and there are lots of them still
        around. There are about 10 on ebay right now. And some of them have
        never been used. The main ones are the big yellow box sealed in
        celophane, the carboard tube which is mainly from Britain, and the clear
        plastic cylinder with the black base. Be careful with the last because
        some pirate versions copied the clear cylinder. Also if you are tired of
        stickers get an Ideal Deluxe cube or the Rubik's Game cube which has
        plastic tiles. These can be expensive if their unused, but they are
        usually still great if you can only get a used one. David J

        As stated by previous answers only the old 1980 Rubik's Cube and the new
        Rubik Studio cube have screws. The advantage of screw is that you can
        adjust the cube to your style of speedcubing. Also it will wear down
        evenly. But there are some adjustments possible for a Rubik's.com cube
        see http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/makinga.htm I personally do not use
        the rubik's.com cube, and if we look at the top 10 op the WC2003, they
        did not use a rubik's.com cube! Actually 4 of the top 10 got there cube
        from me, I prepared two of them for the final. You will need a speedcube
        if you want to do finger tricks. If you are lucky a rubik's.com can work
        fine, this depends if the tension is evenly. Most speedcubers try or
        just buy 10 cubes, to get a good cube. But still the current stickers
        are very bad. Than again the stickers will be replaced in the near
        future with stronger ones, the first tests of the new developed stickers
        where very positive. Ton --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        last two centers on large &gt; cubes (6x6x6 or larger)? I guess I have
        just been getting lucky &gt; with the centers on smaller cubes. Well,
        since you asked... I would bet it's not so much that you're getting
        lucky with the smaller cubes, but that it's easier to piece together
        rows in the smaller cubes. Using a row by row approach for the last two
        centers, working across from one side to the other, you can actually get
        everything that lies on one half, and everything that is on or outside
        the diagonals on the other half without using any algs. So, on a 6x6x6,
        you can get these (hopefully this makes sense): XXXX XXX XXX XXXX
        without algs, leaving just two spaces at most to fill in with algs. And
        actually, you can pre-fill at least one of the spaces, which is why a
        5x5x5 requires no algs. I think you'll find that it could really add a
        lot of moves to your solution if you used an algorithm the whole way
        through the last two centers, so, this is what I would recommend -
        concentrate on one of the two faces, building it up one row at a time.
        First, piece together the rows on one half (without algs, using unsolved
        rows as a workspace), finishing with the center row (for odd order
        cubes). Then piece together the rows on the other half as much as
        possible. By "as much as possible", I mean that you can get anything
        that is no closer to the center than the row you are creating. I think
        I'm making this more confusing than it has to be, but it's hard to
        explain in words. Anyway, when you've done as much as possible without
        algs, fill in the gaps with an alg, used repetetively. The one I use
        (using the same notation as Masayuki, with the last two centers on F and
        R) has the effect of swapping 2 centers, (F Ux Ly) and (R Ux Fy), though
        it is actually a rotation of 3 as well. It is: U'x R' Dy R Ux R' D'y
        This is only 7 moves, with only 4 being slices (though slice turn vs.
        face turn is hardly important on computer cubes). You just have to make
        sure the U and D moves are not the same slice. If they are (e.g. slice
        U1 and slice D4 are the same one for a 6x6x6), reverse the R turns, and
        it will make it a different D slice move (e.g. Use D1 instead of D4 or
        D2 instead of D3). A nice feature of this alg, is that if you have
        multiple pieces in the Ux slice that are lined up and need to swap
        between R and F, you can just do multiple D slice moves (Dy, Dz, etc.),
        each one corresponding to a pair that gets swapped. This isn't
        particularly useful for the 6x6x6, since you can make sure you only have
        one gap to fill in, if you do it right. However, when you start working
        with 7x7x7, 8x8x8, and up, this becomes increasingly useful. ---

        That can happen sometimes. Different brands of silicon react differently
        with different types of plastic and can make a cube stiff especially if
        there is a lot of cube dust on the inside. This happened on my old cube
        and it actually ate away at the plastic. What brand did you use? My

        The Rubiks's Arxon is a orginal 1980 with the bright orange. The logo on
        the Rubik's Studio cube can wear after a while. On the Arxon this does
        not happen. Both have strong vinyl stickers that are very strong, srews
        in the center. For speedcubing there is little difference, but is more a
        personal prefernce, it just feel a bit better. &gt; Also, how long of a
        life do the 2003 Studio Cubes have? This depends you much you play. It
        take me more than 6 months before I use a new cube. In three years I
        used 4 speedcubes, I never had to replace the stickers. Ton --- In

        I went back to the hardware store today and bought a different brand of
        silicone spray. I tried it on an old crappy cube (in case it stuffed up
        the cube again) and it seemed okay. I sprayed a little on my Square-1,

        I don't know if Snap is better than Prestone or not, but I do know that
        the Rubiks.com lube kits are EVIL. I mean, they just don't work very
        well. They last for about a week before you have to re-apply it, and if
        you leave it somewhere hot then it gets extremely stiff. But with
        regular silicone spray, if you leave it somewhere hot, it gets extremely

        because of the the dodgy &gt; &gt; spray &gt; &gt; &gt; I bought
        yesterday. :( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also bought a packet of

        Alright, first of all I'd like to suggest consulting speedcubing.com
        first. (I'm sure many here would agree with that.) I do notice some
        oddness in what you have described though. If you consider the cross as
        a 'no alg' step, then why are you considering the FL conrers to need 1-3
        algs? Do you mean 'up to 3 algs' or 'one of 3 actual algs for each of
        the 3 corners'? In other words, did you mean # of algs that are needed
        to be memorized for the step in question or # of algs that need to be
        executed in that step? If it is the second then you should have 1 for
        the cross number. In general with a method with so many steps, it is
        typical to run into more lucky cases when that step is skipped. But
        proportionate to your overall time, it shouldn't affect averages too
        much and can be counted as non-lucky. Assuming these are minor steps you
        have skipped and say a reasonable number of such skips (up to 3 for what
        you do, in my opinion). So I do suggest reading the "well-accepted"
        (continually revised if necessary) definition of luckyness on
        speedcubing.com, which seems to agree with other site's definitions to a
        good extent. If you are then unclear about anything feel free to type up
        a more descriptive question or solve that you find questionable. Come to
        think of it, I should ask around sometimes, to get more interesting
        conversations started but usually just sit down and do the
        mathematical/statistical computations (I am fairly strict about these
        things and not using lucky times in averages.) An actually solve example
        would be great for this sort of thing... Not to mention shed some light
        on other people's solving methods out there. Wouldn't it just be so
        simple if lucky times were just defined by something like times with
        greater then say 2.5 standar deviations away from one's average? But
        NOooooo, we have to be careful about such things since it is possible to
        get a slower then averge but still lucky time (i.e. skipped tons of
        steps but lost a lot of time elsewhere) or something in the opposite
        direction. -Doug Li --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        they're all about the same. however, some sprays have more silicone and
        others have more propellant, so with a brand that has lots of
        propellant, you have to spray a lot on to get much silicone. propellants
        that take a long time to dry leave your cube stiff and sticky until the
        propellant dries. so faster evaporating propellant is better. i've used
        three brands of silicone and here is my opinions: 1. prestone. not bad,
        propellant dries relatively quickly and there's enough silicone so you
        don't have to soak it. 2. snap. my least favorite, the propellant takes
        forever to dry and there's not much silicone so you have to saturate it
        to leave much silicone behind. 3. castle. my favorite, the propellant
        dries *instantly*, and there's tons of silicone so a quick spray leaves
        your cube nice and greasy. of course opinions vary, so your mileage may
        vary, as they say. -eric

      <div class="email-content">
        Ok, due to some interest/requests I'm going to write up a rough solution
        of the 1x1x2 Glidingcube here. If you have no idea what I'm talking
        about then go here: www.glidingcube.com and enjoy you limited trials, I
        know I did. Due to the high number of permutations and I think for the
        old version, the animations couldn't be turned off so back then an
        estimate for your solving times would be whatever you get on a regular
        cube twice that size in every dimension say on Oinkleburger; perhaps now
        it is like 80% of that time due to no animations switched off. First
        off, I'd like to say that it is a lot more difficult than it sounds.
        After solving the 3x3x3 version about 5 months ago when it first came
        out, on the first try and then some 10x10x10s in reasonable amount of
        time I decided to try a 1x1x2 version (after observing the redundancy of
        a 1x1x1, lol). Needless to say all of the 2 sticker swap algs shown on
        Ping's site don't work; neither did my own 2 sticker swap alg. On the
        other hand, some of you will be able to solve it no problem, but if you
        haven't done so I think it's a good exercise. I worked on the puzzle
        off&amp;on for about 2 months (dang), going at it pretty much randomly
        since I figured the number of permutations to be very low. So I stooped
        to figuring it out mathematically. I thought up most of this through
        "cube-intuition" then backed it up with some mathematical reasoning. So
        let's get started... First off think of this cube differently then any
        other cube - think of it as two (length 6) belts that intersect at two
        points (I'll call that the top and bottom). This is of course more of a
        15-puzzle interpretation then a mechanical polyhedron one that we are
        all accustomed to :). Ok so STEP1, solve one of these belts, if you
        can't do this then go back to doing the 3x3x3 or higher GC to get the
        hang of things. Know your preset color scheme and solve for it (I'll
        assume the U,D faces to contain the single sticker). Now at most 4
        stickers need to permuted. MATH: Ok, forget about doing mechanical
        turns, none of them are required (due also by reasoning others have
        done, but the 1x1x2 might be a special case) and that any mechanical
        turn here is the same as a glide move. There are essentially 2 types of
        glides, a "short glide" and "long glide," each of order 4 and 6
        respectively. Since these are even numbers.... we'll call the need to
        swap two sticker a "parity problem," although this can be compensated by
        swapping two identical color stickers elsewhere (with in the last 4
        stickers). The unfinished belt can be thought of a hexagon, actually two
        overlapping triangles, whose lines indicate swaps that can be made
        through a 180 short glide. Connecting opposites to see what can be
        swapped by a 180ish long glide. From here plan out what needs to be.
        Note that many approaches can be taken, but there will usually be a
        simple optimal path to doing this. Any time you swap two stickers
        through one of these lines you have to undo it to another two, typically
        on the other triangle. THE GOAL: So the main goal could be to separate
        your colors onto the two triangles, say each should have 1 color A and 1
        color B (hopefully you didn't make preset the color scheme to something
        like all white, lol). Once your here that and have no parity problem
        then it is easy to see what has to be done (2 short glides, with some
        conjugation in there (turning the belt to line up the first swap on say
        the top layer, doing the equiv of U2, doing an odd number of glides of
        the bad belt, and undoing the U2 there, then post-adjust by getting the
        unique top sticker back on the top face.)). To actually do the color
        separation use this type of technique (it it officially called
        commutation or conjugation) with long glides (basically a length 3 glide
        of the solved belt (or where the solved belt was, this should
        temporarily swap the top and bottom stickers, but this will be undone in
        the techniuqe)). FIX PARITY ERRORS: This is where people usually get
        stuck on doing, i.e. everything solved except something like the LU and
        RU stickers need to be swapped (observe the difference between this and
        swapping the LD and RD stickers, one solves into the proper color scheme
        and the other solves into a different color scheme, although some of you
        won't care as long as it looks like solved... I feel this is like
        solving the centers of a normal 4x4 wrong.) This is at the heart of the
        difficulty of this puzzle, mostly due to its high number of
        intersections... sort of like how solving the pyraminx for the first
        time would seem. So I could list a few ways of doing this but I think
        it'll be better if I just show you how to solve the example I gave about
        swapping LU and RU stickers: (R3F1R3F5-F3R1F3R5-U2), as an abuse of
        notation :).... Ok so something like R3 means that looking from the
        right side, the belt that lies on the perimeter should be glided 3 times
        (in either direction since it's a bit of a 180 analog). So as a result
        the top and bottom stickers are interchanged and so are the 4 on the F
        and B face. I ran out of trials on it, so I'm not 100% this alg works,
        but on paper it should at most leave you with something that looks
        solved in but in the wrong color scheme (this is easily fixed btw using
        commutation of long glides technique). As it turns out swapping the UL
        and DR stickers can be done by using 180ish long glides to swap UL and
        DR an in exchange swap top and bottom stickers. Now the cube can be
        solved by doing the color scheme correction (I mentioned 2 ways of doing
        this above). 1 correct color scheme, 5 worng ones btw. Solving one belt
        at a time reduces this possibility to 1 and 1. -Doug Li

        Hey all, I moved to the 3 look LL a few months ago and have been working
        just fine with it no worries. Then for the last 4 days or so, I
        completely forgot an algorithm... Not so much forgot it as replaced it
        with another. That is whenever situation P14 came up, I would execute
        P15 and whenever P15 came up, I would also execute P15. (permutation
        algorithms from www.speedcubing.com). As I said, I have been working
        just fine with all the algorithms in my head for 2 months now maybe. Yet
        one day I just lost P14. I had to look it up, I tried for 3 full days to
        do it without looking it up and I just kept getting it wrong. Now that
        I've looked it up, all is well, but I still for a split second want to
        do P15 when P14 comes up. Anyone else have similar experiences? Just
        your brain overwrote something without telling you? Thought it was
        weird, would like some insight.

        Very cool! Let's see some more cube publicity! I checked it all out, but
        it seems that now it has reached its bandwidth limit so for the rest of
        you out there, you may have to wait a day or two to see it. I want a
        name tag like that... "Rubik's Cube Expert" :). (Aren't we all cube

        Glad to know I'm not the only one. Over the course of the few days where
        I couldn't remember the alg, I made up several new ones that worked, but
        they weren't as natural as the one that I used originally. Now, having
        cubed quite a bit for 2 or so days, I'm back on track and my times have

        in clear plastic cylinder and as part of Rubik's "Game" or "Challenge"
        in foot long box made in Korea. 4x4x4 made in Hong Kong and Macau, and

        aaah, the part i despise the most. use rubbing alcohol. it may take a
        while. somethime when my stickers are falling off, usually white
        followed by blue, i take off the whole face and i use black. after a
        while a cubing, the gunk of that face is magically off, since you just
        wore it off by getting it stuck to your hands. or you can jsut put it in
        water to loosen the gunk, but not all of it will come off. dont put new
        stickers on the gunk, they will fall off very fast. c4r7

        Take it from someone who has done this hundreds of times... use a
        solvent like isopropyl alcohol. I asked a chemist about this and it
        works fairly well and won't hurt the plastic, and it's cheap. I tried
        the gunk remover they had at the O.S.C. and it didn't work any better.
        If you really want to do a good job then take the cube completely apart
        and clean the individual pieces with "pure wipes" or a similar non
        abrasive, low lint product. One source is National Paper Products Inc.
        The reason for taking the cube apart is that there's a risk of getting
        the adhesive inside the cube which is hardly desirable. Water doesn't
        really break down the adhesive very well. Mark On Tuesday 21 October

        Good question, I'm cure we've all ran into this type of problem at one
        time or another. Atkinson wrote: &gt; One way is to just soak it in

        much and using water AND lube.... common' any of you remember

        is a good idea, but I personally leave chemical treatments as a last
        resort. (I've done this in the past when it is an extreme situation...)
        The brute force way of doing it, is to spread it to your hands... but
        it'll just spread back so that is not too efficent (I only do it when
        not at home). I think the effective method is to do the following (in
        order): #1. USE TAPE (preferablly heavy-duty duct tape, the wide stuff
        usually grey or brown... but anytape should do) #2. OLD T-SHIRT/CLOTH
        (perhaps spraying it with lube first will emulsify it sufficently) #3.
        SOAP &amp; WATER (I really don't see why the other two responses never
        mentioned SOAP! it's quite obvious although a pain to do this since
        you'll have to dry the pieces...) #4. ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (last resort, I
        suggest washing it was water afterwards to get rid of any risdual odor
        even though it evaporates fast.) -Doug Li (Happy Cubing People!) --- In

        Since I have some cubes at my desk at work, I get many questions about
        the cube like is it still available Today I met a colleague how saw my
        cubes "can you solve it?" He asked Yes in about 30 seconds, I answered
        Then he tells me that 20 year ago when he was 18 his average was 30
        seconds, So I let him solve the cube and let him explain his method. His
        first step was make a white cross, secondly place 3 corners and use the
        last corner space to put the three middle edges, place the last corner
        after this place the last edge and orientates the edges of the last
        layer, then place the corners and orientate, then place last layer. From
        this I could see that with this method 30 seconds is possible. He did
        not had a speedcube in 1981 and he called speedcubing in 1981, cubing .
        He did not participate in a Dutch national championship in 1981 because
        on school he was number 4, but during the contest the cubers performed
        very bad, and he regrets he did not participate. We talked a while and
        he left me with a true speedcubers spirit, " It is nice to do something
        completely useless" I answered " at least it is something that I know
        that I am good at" He confirmed. There are some typical speedcubers
        facts from his story. ¬Ñh Fast speedcubers perform bad in competition ¬Ñh
        Compare your self with a top speedcuber and assume every body is faster
        ¬Ñh It is completely useless but fun to do! Ton

        Apart from it being nice to know there are still people interested from
        my time (early 80s) the description of the algorithm prompted a question
        I've been meaning to ask for a while: Assuming a very similar approach
        (cross, 3 corners and middle edges in any order, last top corner, last
        middle edge, then last face) every post I come across on here seems to
        do edges before corners on last layer. Its a pointless question really
        since since the best current methods seem a lot better but is there some
        reason why people don't do corners and then edges? Or maybe they do and
        I just read the posts on algorithms that happen to do edges first! I
        always found "edge only" moves very natural so leave them to the end.
        Used to do about 30 seconds with this and under a minute one handed. Any
        one-handers out there: As i start to practice and remember my old
        algorithms I find that my onehanded averages are always double my
        twohanded averages - and when I think about it that probably held true
        20 years ago too. This is even though I hardkly ever solve the cube
        twohanded any more. Interested to hear of other peoples correlations.

        I didn't want to clutter up the board with three completely different
        new posts, so here they are, all in one post: SOLVING METHOD: Looking at
        the solving methods of most speedcubists, it looks like there are four
        main catagories: the Fridrich method, ZB's method, the Petrus method,
        and corners first people. Is there anyone who does and F2L with a LL
        consisting of solving corners (however many looks, I use 2) then solve
        edges (I use 1.5 looks, but again dosn't really matter), or am I the
        only one who does anything like that? SCHOLARSHIPS: I am currently a
        junior in high school, so I will be going to collage fairly soon. One
        thing I was wondering, are there any scholarships for Rubik's cubes?
        Something tells me that being a world record holder on the pyraminx and
        being able to solve the rubiks cube in less than a minute might appeal
        to collages, but how can I turn that into scolarships? THIS ANNOYING
        VIRUS DEBATE: This is beyond annoying. I checked my email today and
        found about 40 new messages, well over half of them were people arguing
        and bickering about this stupid virus debate. I think it's getting old,
        anyone else think so? Please don't mis interpret this as me defending
        anyone or anything, I am just getting annoyed with a huge debate topic
        that has absolutely nothing to do with rubik's cubes or any other puzzle
        on this message board. Nobody but the people involved know all facts,
        and it is my guess that those involved don't even know absolutely
        everything. In my personal opinion, it should have never even been
        brought up in the first place. In my opinion, speedcubing is one of the
        very few sports that is extremely competitive, but friendly at the same
        time. The last thing we need is someone getting mad or holding a grudge
        against someone else (especially a personal problem) and then people
        making a big deal out of it and taking sides. I consider every one I
        have met through cubing to be one of my friends, and I hate being cought
        between friends who are arguing over something. This is getting really
        long, so I'm going to end it with that. OK, that is all. Please reply to
        any/all of the topics in this

        rubik's cubes or any other puzzle on this message board. Nobody but the
        people involved know all facts, and it is my guess that those involved
        don't even know absolutely everything. In my personal opinion, it should
        have never even been brought up in the first place. In my opinion,
        speedcubing is one of the very few sports that is extremely competitive,
        but friendly at the same time. The last thing we need is someone getting
        mad or holding a grudge against someone else (especially a personal
        problem) and then people making a big deal out of it and taking sides. I
        consider every one I have met through cubing to be one of my friends,

        Yes, what you are refering to is the CLL/ELL thing. There are 3 people
        in our community known for such a thing and a few that you might not
        expect. First I consider Guus R. Schultz a pioneer in this LL method.
        The two others are Akimoto and me. (I have recently uploaded my CLL and
        ELL set to my website, check it out.) Others that can effectively
        perform this method include Ron, Gilles (he's been working on it for his
        new system), LarsP, and probably a few I forgot to mention. The second
        listing are people that don't quite do the exact CLL/ELL thing or that
        it arises from a non- Fridrich method, perhaps edges already correctly
        flipped so that they don't know all the non-trivial ELL situations or
        didn't quite have a proper F2L as in Gilles case (I think he leaves two
        first layer edges unsolved as an intermediate step..... similar to what
        I sometimes do). The first list of 3 are the true CLL/ELL solvers, but I
        don't think Guus R. Schultz is an active cuber anymore. Of course this
        list is by no means complete or totally accurate, but I hope it answers
        one of your posted questions. Btw, I am happy to be apart of this group
        of solvers :). (No offense to the mainstream method of course.) -Doug Li

        Corners first LL Timely because my last post had hidden in it exactly
        this question. I orient corners, positions corners and then finish the
        edges - 3 looks. Worst case when all edges are flipped and one is
        properly placed. I think its fast enough to get under 30 secs but I
        doubt whether I'll get much faster than that with this method. On the
        other hand i think its fine for onehanded cubing when its easier to
        arrange for for a LL you like while solving the F2Ls. Duncan --- In

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi friendz, I was wondering what you guys/girls are doing after the WC
        2003. My main goal now is to break 13/14 second averages one day. At
        first I started solving corners first. It took me about a month to get
        down to low twenties averages. But I already knew a lot of the necessary
        algorithms for the Waterman system. I had the most problems with solving
        the first 4 corners. It was hard to visualize this during the
        preinspection. After 1 month I decided that I would never break 15
        seconds average with that system or variants of it. What I am doing now
        is trying to solve a 2x2x2 block (Lars Petrus), and after that complete
        the cross and continue F2L and LL. This was also very hard to get used
        to. I was only solving one of the four white corners. That was hard too.
        So then I started practicing only starting with the white/blue/orange
        corner. That finally brought me the understanding of the 2x2x2. What I
        basically do is connect the white/blue/orange corner piece to either the
        white/blue or the white/orange edge. Then connect the other edge to its
        center. After that I connect these two blocks to get a 2x2x1 block.
        Finally I solve the 3rd edge and insert the block. Now that I am able to
        visualize this during preinspection, I am also trying to solve one of
        the three other white corners if that would be easier to solve. Using
        this approach I average about 3 to 4 moves fewer than the basic
        cross/F2L. So this could well be a second once fluently done. The
        biggest gain should come from removing one step of the solution. I am
        sure some of us are going to do this, so if you want to be the 3rd world
        champion, then expect a lot of competition from those "crazy" guys
        learning hundreds of algorithms! Solving a completely random LL in one
        step seems almost impossible to me. There are 1211 different algorithms,
        NOT including the mirrored cases, the inverse cases and the mirrored
        inverse cases. And these other cases are absolutely not trivial being
        12.58 moves average. And of course it will be hard to remember all
        algorithms because of the low occurrences of each case. That means that
        for the F2L/LL cubists, you should be able to influence LL during F2L to
        have fewer different cases. That is how in 2001, independently of each
        other, Zbigniew Zborowski and I came up with the idea of flipping all LL
        edges during F2L. We now call this the Zborowski-Bruchem system. ;-) To
        be able to do this you need to learn 306 (INCLUDING mirrored cases)
        algorithms for flipping LL edges while solving the last corner/edge pair
        of F2L. You could do with fewer if you would be able to have at most 2
        flipped edges BEFORE solving the last corner/edge pair. Or to always
        have 0 or 4 flipped edges... And you need to learn 494 algorithms
        (INCLUDING mirrored cases) for solving LL in 1 step, once the LL edges
        are already solved. Both Zbigniew and I already have more than 100 LL
        algorithms covered. And slowly we are working towards the complete set.
        Using no algorithms at all and at top speed I have about 50-60% cases
        with no edges flipped in LL. I will also be working on getting this
        percentage up. If people would be able to manage all this stuff on top
        speed, then averages of 12 to 13 seconds are very probable. What other
        ideas do you have? At the moment I am working on filtering: 1) the last
        algorithms for F2L with LL edge flipping 2) the corner algorithms for LL
        including permuting the edges The filtering is needed to get a list of
        like 50 algorithms per case, down to 2 or 3 algorithms per case, each of
        those being easy to execute with finger tricks. I would appreciate it if
        2 of you would help me finish these lists. Please send me an e-mail.
        Another thing that has proven to be very important is holding your
        nerves during a competition. The pressure during the WC final was too
        much for me. Recently during Dutch Cube Day I still had trembling hands,
        even though the audience wasn't that big. I have been reading a lot
        about this subject. According to the books in the end it all comes down
        to the fear of failing/losing/underachieving. I can recommend the book
        "The inner game of tennis". In short it is about two persons inside one
        tennis player: the 1st person who is perfect at all strokes, and a 2nd
        person who is talking to that 1st person to do this or that this or that
        way. You can imagine how that 1st person is feeling. So please let that
        2nd person shut up! The same goes for speedcubing. Your hands are
        perfect, you have all algorithms and cases covered. So don't let that
        2nd person tell your hands what to do! I will be working very hard on my
        nerves for upcoming competitions. Having said that I already put a lot
        of pressure on myself again..... :-( Be prepared too! Last month
        speedcubing.com had its 200,000th visitor on the site. We now have had
        visitors from 143 countries (last added countries are Syria, Kazakhstan
        and Uganda). This week speedcubing.com will be moved to a new host. Our
        current host Henk Kuipers (http://www.opensourcesolutions.nl/) got into
        too much trouble with his hosting company, because of the high bandwidth
        (18GB per month), even though we have the most popular videos on
        different web space. Thanks Henk! I expect the speed of the site to go
        down a little. But then again we are free to grow in size and in
        bandwidth consumption. Have fun to all! And please stop this stupid
        virus and Microsoft bashing discussion. I will remove all new messages
        about viruses. ;-) Ron http://www.speedcubing.com

        Hi again friendz, I just thought we should add some more cubing stuff...
        In Toronto we already saw some cubists focusing on different puzzles. I
        especially admire Grant for his MegaMinx achievements and Lars V for his
        Square-1 achievements. We also have Masayuki Akimoto with his beautiful
        abilities on 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube, with his own very interesting system.
        Recently we have seen Stefan Pochmann with fantastic averages for
        Rubik's Clock and Skewb. When I meet complete puzzle outsiders they are
        very attracted to other puzzles than the 3x3x3 cube. MegaMinx is the
        most popular because of its nice shape and colors. I would recommend
        everyone to also learn one of the other puzzles. Just look at how many
        algorithms Lars V learned for Square-1. That requires a lot of
        dedication, but it sure helped him to become world champion by a large
        margin. Have fun, Ron http://www.speedcubing.com

        Hi again friends, One more idea I had involves certain ways to
        incorrectly or not completely solve F2L before starting LL. Here is an
        example. If you look at the OLL cases, there are many possibilities
        because there are many different ways how the edge orientation and
        corner orientation can be positioned relative to each other. If you have
        no edges flipped, then there is only one OLL case per corner
        orientation. Same for 4 edges flipped. But if two connecting edges are
        flipped, then there 4 different OLL cases per corner orientation case.
        For two opposite edges flipped there are 2 different OLL cases per
        corner orientation case. So in total you could have 1+1+4+2 is 8
        different cases per corner orientation case (depending on mirrored
        cases). Now suppose that you solved the last corner/edge pair of LL with
        the edge flipped in its place. Then there are either 1 or 3 edges
        flipped in last layer. And for both cases you have 4 different OLL cases
        per corner orientation. This would actually give more than 57 OLL cases,
        because you cannot mirror cases when the number of flipped edges is odd.
        I also think that these algorithms will be longer than the normal OLL
        algorithms, because you still need to flip the middle layer edge. Other
        ideas may be to swap two edges of the cross or to always solve one first
        layer corner with a 120 degrees twist. Could there be advantageous ways
        to influence LL by incorrectly or not completely solving F2L????? I
        haven't found one. I did find advantages for corners first systems,
        where you could have fewer cases to learn if you would have 1 or 3
        flipped edges in the middle layer instead of 0, connecting 2, opposite
        2, or 4. Maybe someone can prove that this is impossible for layer
        systems? Have fun, Ron http://www.speedcubing.com

        Hello Ron and everybody, Along the lines of trying to solve the last
        layer plus a corner edge pair in two algorithms (like what you and
        Zbidniew are approaching), have you ever thought of (1) doing all five
        corners first (orient and permute) and then (2) all five edges (orient
        and permute)? At first the number of algorithms seems insurmountable.
        But the idea here would be to intelligently use the extra open slots
        where the corner-edge pair would go. If the corner-edge pair belongs in
        the DRF spot, and the last layer is on top, and you do the sequence Rd'
        (where d' is a movement of the bottom two layers) then all the 'unsolved
        pieces' are still in the 'unsolved places.' In this manner you could
        greatly increase the usefulness of a single algorithm. If C is an
        algorithm that affects only the last layer and the DRF corner pair, then
        you also have the algorithms Rd'CdR', dR'CRd', F'dCd'F, and d'FCF'd that
        also only affect the same pieces (albeit, some of these may be the same
        algorithm depending on what C is). In this way the number of different
        algorithms needed for step (1) drops down to around 120 (8-9 move
        average I think) and the number of algorithms for step (2) is also just
        a little over 100 (I think, I haven't rigorously counted these yet...but
        it should be around 120 also)......and this includes mirror images AND
        inverses. True, due to those extra 'preparatory' moves an approach like
        this would have a higher average move count for the last pair plus LL
        (probably around 4-5 moves) than the Z-B method (or should I say Z- you
        method). But I believe these 'extra moves' can be done quite fast and
        with less than a third of the total algorithms needed for the Z-B
        method, I've decided to give this a try......hopefully I'll have more to
        report in a month or two. Tell me what you think. Also, I recently
        switched over to doing a 2x2x2 block at the beginning instead of the
        cross too.....blew my mind at first, but now I really enjoy it. Happy
        cubing, Jake E.

        I took a short break from cubing, but now I'm doing it again. I was
        inspired to work on my 4x4x4 times, and now I've got myself down to an
        average of 2 minutes 30 seconds. Unfortunately, I still haven't
        persuaded myself to learn the single edge-pair orientation algorithm. I
        need to know that before 2005, if I hope to compete. The 5x5x5 still
        takes me around 20 minutes, though. :) Also, I've been working a lot on
        one handed stuff. My new record is 32 seconds, and I've lowered my
        average down to 44.84 seconds. I'm getting a sub-40 time at least once a
        day now. Isn't that 2x2x2 --&gt; cross that you're talking about Chris's
        Extended Cross method? I tried that, but I'm terrible at making the
        cross. I could work on it, but Lars' method is working fine for me now.

        wrote: &gt; Hi friendz, &gt; &gt; I was wondering what you guys/girls
        are doing after the WC 2003. &gt; &gt; My main goal now is to break
        13/14 second averages one day. &gt; &gt; At first I started solving
        corners first. It took me about a month &gt; to get down to low twenties
        averages. But I already knew a lot of &gt; the necessary algorithms for
        the Waterman system. I had the most &gt; problems with solving the first
        4 corners. It was hard to visualize &gt; this during the preinspection.
        After 1 month I decided that I would &gt; never break 15 seconds average
        with that system or variants of it. &gt; &gt; What I am doing now is
        trying to solve a 2x2x2 block (Lars Petrus), &gt; and after that
        complete the cross and continue F2L and LL. This was &gt; also very hard
        to get used to. I was only solving one of the four &gt; white corners.
        That was hard too. So then I started practicing only &gt; starting with
        the white/blue/orange corner. That finally brought me &gt; the
        understanding of the 2x2x2. What I basically do is connect the &gt;
        white/blue/orange corner piece to either the white/blue or the &gt;
        white/orange edge. Then connect the other edge to its center. After &gt;
        that I connect these two blocks to get a 2x2x1 block. Finally I &gt;
        solve the 3rd edge and insert the block. Now that I am able to &gt;
        visualize this during preinspection, I am also trying to solve one &gt;
        of the three other white corners if that would be easier to solve. &gt;
        Using this approach I average about 3 to 4 moves fewer than the &gt;
        basic cross/F2L. So this could well be a second once fluently done. &gt;
        &gt; The biggest gain should come from removing one step of the
        solution. &gt; I am sure some of us are going to do this, so if you want
        to be the &gt; 3rd world champion, then expect a lot of competition from
        &gt; those "crazy" guys learning hundreds of algorithms! &gt; Solving a
        completely random LL in one step seems almost impossible &gt; to me.
        There are 1211 different algorithms, NOT including the &gt; mirrored
        cases, the inverse cases and the mirrored inverse cases. &gt; And these
        other cases are absolutely not trivial being 12.58 moves &gt; average.
        And of course it will be hard to remember all algorithms &gt; because of
        the low occurrences of each case. &gt; That means that for the F2L/LL
        cubists, you should be able to &gt; influence LL during F2L to have
        fewer different cases. That is how &gt; in 2001, independently of each
        other, Zbigniew Zborowski and I came &gt; up with the idea of flipping
        all LL edges during F2L. We now call &gt; this the Zborowski-Bruchem
        system. ;-) &gt; To be able to do this you need to learn 306 (INCLUDING
        mirrored &gt; cases) algorithms for flipping LL edges while solving the
        last &gt; corner/edge pair of F2L. You could do with fewer if you would
        be &gt; able to have at most 2 flipped edges BEFORE solving the last
        &gt; corner/edge pair. Or to always have 0 or 4 flipped edges... &gt;
        And you need to learn 494 algorithms (INCLUDING mirrored cases) for &gt;
        solving LL in 1 step, once the LL edges are already solved. &gt; Both
        Zbigniew and I already have more than 100 LL algorithms &gt; covered.
        And slowly we are working towards the complete set. &gt; Using no
        algorithms at all and at top speed I have about 50-60% &gt; cases with
        no edges flipped in LL. I will also be working on getting &gt; this
        percentage up. &gt; &gt; If people would be able to manage all this
        stuff on top speed, then &gt; averages of 12 to 13 seconds are very
        probable. &gt; &gt; What other ideas do you have? &gt; &gt; At the
        moment I am working on filtering: &gt; 1) the last algorithms for F2L
        with LL edge flipping &gt; 2) the corner algorithms for LL including
        permuting the edges &gt; The filtering is needed to get a list of like
        50 algorithms per &gt; case, down to 2 or 3 algorithms per case, each of
        those being easy &gt; to execute with finger tricks. &gt; &gt; I would
        appreciate it if 2 of you would help me finish these lists. &gt; Please
        send me an e-mail. &gt; &gt; Another thing that has proven to be very
        important is holding your &gt; nerves during a competition. The pressure
        during the WC final was &gt; too much for me. Recently during Dutch Cube
        Day I still had &gt; trembling hands, even though the audience wasn't
        that big. &gt; I have been reading a lot about this subject. According
        to the books &gt; in the end it all comes down to the fear of &gt;
        failing/losing/underachieving. I can recommend the book "The inner &gt;
        game of tennis". In short it is about two persons inside one tennis &gt;
        player: the 1st person who is perfect at all strokes, and a 2nd &gt;
        person who is talking to that 1st person to do this or that this or &gt;
        that way. You can imagine how that 1st person is feeling. So please &gt;
        let that 2nd person shut up! The same goes for speedcubing. Your &gt;
        hands are perfect, you have all algorithms and cases covered. So &gt;

        &gt; &gt; This week speedcubing.com will be moved to a new host. Our
        current &gt; host Henk Kuipers (http://www.opensourcesolutions.nl/) got
        into too &gt; much trouble with his hosting company, because of the high
        bandwidth &gt; (18GB per month), even though we have the most popular
        videos on &gt; different web space. Thanks Henk! &gt; I expect the speed
        of the site to go down a little. But then again &gt; we are free to grow
        in size and in bandwidth consumption. &gt; &gt; Have fun to all! &gt;

        I'm a corners' first guy and I'm also doing it one-handed. I use quite
        some slice moves since I do a truly corners' first, that is 1) top four
        corners 2) bottom four corners 3) top and bottom edges pairwise 4)
        middle layer One-handed, I do the slice moves with my thumb, having the
        index finger on the back side of the top layer and the middle finger at
        the back side of the bottom layer. It works fine for me, even if I
        haven't timed my performace lately. I believe I do it one-handed in just

        Greetings Duncan, I usually solve the LL corners first. There are only
        two "wrong" corner positions - one solved on 6 moves the other in 7
        moves, and I can usually twist the corners in 7 moves, but I'm slowly
        approaching one algorithm per position. I don't use the usual F2L
        solutions that most people use. I also started cubing in the 80's. David

        since since the best &gt; current methods seem a lot better but is there
        some reason why &gt; people don't do corners and then edges? Or maybe
        they do and I just &gt; read the posts on algorithms that happen to do
        edges first! I &gt; always found "edge only" moves very natural so leave
        them to the &gt; end. Used to do about 30 seconds with this and under a
        minute one &gt; handed. &gt; &gt; Any one-handers out there: As i start
        to practice and remember my &gt; old algorithms I find that my onehanded
        averages are always double &gt; my twohanded averages - and when I think
        about it that probably held &gt; true 20 years ago too. This is even

        Hi Ron, You asked. &gt; Could there be advantageous ways to influence LL
        by incorrectly or not completely solving F2L????? &lt; Possibly. For
        example, if in the usual F2L approach (cross etc) you might work out all
        the possiblilties of placing the fourth corner in such a way that the LL
        corners are solved. If this is simplified by making a small change in
        the LL before doing it that would make the answer a definite yes. I can
        usually get to the LL with only two edges or none flipped over. I don't
        use any the more popular strategies for the first two levels. I don't
        know if anyone would be interested in my system, but would you be
        willing to put it up on your page? Thanks, David J --- In

        &gt; Hi again friends, &gt; &gt; One more idea I had involves certain
        ways to incorrectly or not &gt; completely solve F2L before starting LL.
        &gt; &gt; Here is an example. If you look at the OLL cases, there are
        many &gt; possibilities because there are many different ways how the
        edge &gt; orientation and corner orientation can be positioned relative
        to &gt; each other. If you have no edges flipped, then there is only one
        OLL &gt; case per corner orientation. Same for 4 edges flipped. But if
        two &gt; connecting edges are flipped, then there 4 different OLL cases
        per &gt; corner orientation case. For two opposite edges flipped there
        are 2 &gt; different OLL cases per corner orientation case. So in total
        you &gt; could have 1+1+4+2 is 8 different cases per corner orientation
        case &gt; (depending on mirrored cases). &gt; Now suppose that you
        solved the last corner/edge pair of LL with the &gt; edge flipped in its
        place. Then there are either 1 or 3 edges &gt; flipped in last layer.
        And for both cases you have 4 different OLL &gt; cases per corner
        orientation. &gt; This would actually give more than 57 OLL cases,
        because you cannot &gt; mirror cases when the number of flipped edges is
        odd. I also think &gt; that these algorithms will be longer than the
        normal OLL algorithms, &gt; because you still need to flip the middle
        layer edge. &gt; Other ideas may be to swap two edges of the cross or to
        always solve &gt; one first layer corner with a 120 degrees twist. &gt;
        &gt; Could there be advantageous ways to influence LL by incorrectly or
        &gt; not completely solving F2L????? &gt; I haven't found one. I did
        find advantages for corners first &gt; systems, where you could have
        fewer cases to learn if you would have &gt; 1 or 3 flipped edges in the
        middle layer instead of 0, connecting 2, &gt; opposite 2, or 4. &gt;
        &gt; Maybe someone can prove that this is impossible for layer systems?

        :-) &gt; &gt; I'm getting faster now, with a best average of 22.8s, and
        a best time &gt; of 15s (not "lucky", but it's an outlier, statistically

        But I often spend more than 4 secs on the last 4 corners. Some
        configurations can be recognized immediately, others are much difficult
        to see (3 misoriented corners). Do you think that analyzing corners
        should take more time than permutations for example? Gilles.

        I have a few of those. It's a clone from the 80's, made in Taiwan. It
        has spring tension and adjustable screws, but at least the ones I have
        are very loose and not god at all for speedcubing. The stickers are of
        great quality though. /Gustav ----- Original Message ----- From: c4r7

        been trying a significantly &gt; different method

        learn (corner algs and others), but it &gt; looks good, so... next
        milestone for the next three months: 20s AND &gt; 20.5 s &gt; Getting
        closer... :-) Wow Gilles, this is great! You improved so fast. What do
        you think will be the limits of your system? Will it be possible, maybe
        with some additional algorithms, to one day beat 16 seconds? How is the
        number of moves going? On your site you write 48.4 average. Is this
        number going down too? I tried your system several times. Step 1 should
        be easy after some practice (thanks to Lars Petrus). But step 2 seems to
        be the hardest part. Especially because the edges can still be almost
        anywhere on the cube. Step 3 can be done in under 3 seconds average. Are
        you already using the Waterman way for recognizing the cases? For the 3
        misoriented corners I always move the top layer to a standard position
        for recognizing AND starting the algorithm. Most of the time I can
        recognize the case while doing that U move. I personally do not use
        optimal algorithms, because the algorithms I use now are the ones who do
        not flip LL edges. This is the first step to learn all 494 cases. For
        step 4 the fastest way may be to solve the last L and R edge in one
        algorithm, and then solve the M layer edges in one algorithm. The most
        interesting part of your system is that quite a big part of the system
        is intuitive. For the CFOP system (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL) only the cross is
        completely intuitive. The more algorithms the faster you can move. It is
        very good that you can do 48 partly intuitive moves in 20 seconds
        average. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "vinjuran_7"
        &lt;vinjuran@e...&gt; wrote: &gt; Along the lines of trying to solve the
        last layer plus a corner &gt; edge pair in two algorithms (like what you
        and Zbigniew are &gt; approaching), have you ever thought of (1) doing
        all five corners &gt; first (orient and permute) and then (2) all five
        edges (orient and &gt; permute)? &gt; &gt; At first the number of
        algorithms seems insurmountable. But the &gt; idea here would be to
        intelligently use the extra open slots where &gt; the corner-edge pair
        would go. If the corner-edge pair belongs in &gt; the DRF spot, and the
        last layer is on top, and you do the &gt; sequence Rd' (where d' is a
        movement of the bottom two layers) &gt; then all the 'unsolved pieces'
        are still in the 'unsolved &gt; places.' That sounds like a promising
        idea. If you would have one corner already correctly twisted in top
        layer, then you could move that to URB and then do an R move. This would
        give you 4 incorrect corners in LL. And you could use the dirty edge at
        FR (after the R move it is UR). I tried this several times yesterday and
        the only problem is to quickly recognize the cases. You cannot use the
        normal Waterman recognition system with the sticker colors. It is also
        hard to recognize because two corners (the ones now at FRU and BRU)
        should be twisted differently. F.i. for BRU should not have the top
        layer color on top, but to the back. You can also use your idea to solve
        the edges. Especially if one of the top layer edges is already solved.
        Then you can simply do a U turn to move it to UR and then do the R move
        again to leave 4 unsolved edges in LL. Then you can use ELL moves. It
        would be nice if one of the club members (maybe you) could work out a
        complete list of algorithms, or at least find out the number of
        algorithms to learn. About deleting the club messages on the virus
        subject. I am very sorry to have deleted messages that were helping
        people against a possible virus threat. That was not my intention. I did
        want to delete some "virus" messages. But after searching for the word
        "virus" on the club I simply clicked "delete" too early, before
        unselecting most of the neutral messages. My sincere apologies for this.
        Even though these messages were clearly off topic - our topic here is
        cubing - they could have been helpful to people. I never had the
        intention to silence people. You are free to post here and your message
        will be sent to most club members (80%??) by e-mail. A single warning
        message like "I had a virus on my computer, so be careful when opening
        messages from me or other cube friends." would have been enough. I am
        not sorry for deleting messages that had a personal touch against any
        other club member. If you have a personal problem with someone else,
        then you should solve that problem in a personal way. You cannot publish
        personal messages from someone else to a public forum without that
        person's consent. These club messages will stay here for a loooong time.
        So people can even find these messages in 10 years, and it could really
        work against you or someone else. F.i. if you or he/she would be looking
        for a job. If you want me to repost all neutral messages (I have them in
        my club mail folder), then please let me know. If you want me to stop
        being the moderator of this club, then also let me know. In a PERSONAL
        e-mail. Now back to cubing on this club! There is so much to talk about.
        Who has a fantastic new system? What is everyone doing after the WC?
        What kind of tips do you have on controlling nerves during a
        competition? Who has some good tips on permuting the edges for blindfold
        solving? Would US cubists join a possible European championship in
        august 2004? What could we do to make it a little more interesting than
        just watching? Have fun, Ron

        I do have one myself, but I must say, that isn't a really good cube... I
        t broke after 2 weeks of "normal" use... The only tyhing I know is that
        the stickers are very good. The main other problem, with fragility, is
        that this cube is really stiff, even any Silicon lube doesn't help.
        Maybe it was just mine, I don't know... If you want, I can scan and

        &gt; But I often spend more than 4 secs on the last 4 corners. &gt; Some
        configurations can be recognized immediately, others are much &gt;
        difficult to see (3 misoriented corners). Yes, 4s or more is a bit too
        long to spend on the corners. Recognition for this step 'can' be

        die hard). I have it categroized by the purmutaton of the corners first
        then by orientation. This way inverses and mirrors are grouped together.
        But you do have it right, there are indeed 24 cases here (not including
        corners solved). Most of them are quite simple. Going back to
        recognition, I think that the way you have it layed out on your site is
        great. It is mainly going to be about practice now. Reduce the number of
        times you have to do a pre-adjust to determine the case. I usually pick
        a corner (preferable one that is orientated) and decide if what is
        diagonally opposite it is what should be there (relatively) if so then
        check if there needs to be a diagonal swap of the other two corners. If
        the opposite corner is not in the proper relative position, which
        direction should it go. Then I figure out if it's a 3-corner cycle or 2
        corner swap (although the two are actually equivalent). As I'm doing all
        that, I'll of already gotton enough of an imprint of the orientations
        that I'd of already started the algorithm. This brings me to another
        point... 2/3 of the time it is an adjacent corner swap. So I actually
        just assume it will be that before I even get there and for the twists I
        get, start the algorithm that way. I stop myself if I find that OH... it
        was somethign else.... (the time I gain making assumptions is outweights
        the time I lose on average!) So I already start an algorithm before I
        finish recognition. Also the first turn I try to do during regripping or
        just before even. All these little efficencies add up. But this works
        out exceptionally well for me since in my method, I can start CLL
        recognition early as I'm finishing my last step of F2L and for some odd
        reason (perhaps due to other selective preprocessing I do) get a
        significanty greater percentage chance of getting Adjacent corner swaps
        and rarely get No corner swaps (when I do get no corners swaped I have a
        high, say 1/3 chance, of solving in one algorithm due to some extensive
        algorithm sets I know.) Besides doing CLL recognition I do half of ELL
        recognition here too. I know at least 2 or 3 algs for each CLL case and
        select an appropriate one based on edge flip and the current grip angle
        (much of the time solving an edge symutaneously). &gt; Do you think that
        analyzing corners should take more time than &gt; permutations for
        example? CLL should be about as fast as other steps like OLL or PLL once
        you have mastered it. On average it takes me 3s (my dexterity isn't that
        great but I have good recognition for this step) and would take someone
        like Akimoto even less time (on average). -Doug Li www.umich.edu/~dlli

        Speeding up was very difficult in the beginning, most of my times &gt;
        &gt; lying in the 40s-50s range. But I was happy, because it's good to
        be a &gt; &gt; beginner! :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm getting faster now,
        with a best average of 22.8s, and a best time &gt; &gt; of 15s (not
        "lucky", but it's an outlier, statistically speaking). &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I've still got a lot to learn (corner algs and others), but it
        looks &gt; &gt; good, so... next milestone for the next three months:
        20s (before I &gt; &gt; decide to switch to another method, again :-) )
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy cubing, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gilles. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 20.5 s &gt; Getting closer... :-) &gt; &gt; But I often spend more
        than 4 secs on the last 4 corners. &gt; Some configurations can be
        recognized immediately, others are much &gt; difficult to see (3
        misoriented corners). &gt; &gt; Do you think that analyzing corners
        should take more time than &gt; permutations for example? &gt; &gt;

        Hey everyone, I'm a student at Caltech and tonight's the night where we
        do our "Negative Time Tommy's Run." The object of this is to leave
        Caltech, go to Tommy's (in downtown LA) and get back before we left.
        Naturally, there's only one day of the year you can do this and today's
        the day. When 2 AM becomes 1 AM because daylight savings ends... pretty
        much if you leave after 1 AM and get back within an hour, you win. This
        is my first time attempting this but I estimate it's about a 20-25
        minute drive away so naturally it's not easy. Furthermore, some of the
        really hardcore people try what's called the "Triple Threat" meaning you
        go and eat the cheese burger with extra chili, hot dog with extra chili,
        and tamale with extra chili and still get back before you left. Of
        course, if one times themselves solving a Rubik's Cube, negative time
        speed solving is also possible. Of course, you've only got one shot at
        this every year... you'd have to start at 1:59.59. So it's just a
        Caltech quirk... I thought I'd apply it to the Rubik's cube. It's 12:47
        AM... almost time to leave. I'll have to try and get some negative time
        Rubik's Cube results published somewhere in Caltech. Anyway... here we

        Hey all, Just got back... and we did not succeed in negative time
        unfortunately. Our trip took positive 4 minutes and 15 seconds (huge
        accident on Highway 101 forced us to take an alternate route) It's not
        my fault the other four people were busy stuffing their mouths!
        Anyway... as for the Rubik's cube, it took me 59 seconds to solve with a
        horrendous mistake in putting up the cross but I average 40 anyway so I
        guess it could have been worse. So, if we go by the time, I solved the

        of the people use OLL-PLL system, I have not had much information about
        CLL. So I had to develop the recognition system by myself. I am grad to
        hear from you. &gt;But I often spend more than 4 secs on the last 4
        corners. &gt;Some configurations can be recognized immediately, others
        are much &gt;difficult to see (3 misoriented corners). I agree with you
        that 3 misoriented corners are most tough ones. When I started CLL-ELL
        system, It took about 10 sec for recognition of CLL. But I can recognize
        CLL in one second now. I don't figure out how corners have to move but I
        use just color patterns. Cases of 3 misoriented corners. #1 Check corner
        colors on LL. You will see two opponent colors (W-B or Y-G in your case)
        and another color. #2-1 two opponent colors locate at adjuscent corners.
        I normally place the oriented corner at FR or FL along with two opponet
        colors FR BR or FL BL. 2-1-1 The oriented corner is FR The 1st move is
        R, the 2nd move you still need to choose one of two. 2-1-2 The oriented
        corner is L The first move is L, the 2nd move you still need to choose
        one of two. #2-2 two opponent colors locate at diagonal corners. I
        normally place the oriented corner at FR or FL along with the other
        front corner piece has LL color at F. 2-2-1 The oriented corner is FR
        The 1st move is L', the 2nd move you still need to choose one of two.
        2-2-2 The oriented corner is L The first move is R, the 2nd move you
        still need to choose one of two. So it is sort of three step recognition
        but I can start the first move before final decision. I am working on
        CLL with or without flipping edges to get easy ELL. But I am not going
        to complete 3 misoriented corners because Sune or anti-Sune? is too fast
        to think edge flipping. I hope you will get sub20 soon with your new
        method. Masayuki Akimoto

        are doing after the WC 2003. At the moment I have two ambitions:
        averaging sub-17 on the 3x3x3 and averaging sub-30 on the Square-1. On
        the 3x3x3 I have been getting a lot of averages in the 18,0-18,5 lately,
        and also some 17,5-18,0 averages. But my F2L averages are still 12-13
        seconds so if I can improve my looking ahead I can beat the 17 second
        barrier for sure, and maybe even get sub-16, but it will require a lot
        of practice I feel. As for averaging sub-30 on the Square-1: I have had
        two sub-30 averages so far. I have learned a new set of edge algorithms
        a few weeks ago and they've helped me tremendously. My normal averages
        are in the 30-32,5 seconds range. There are still 3 problem edge cases
        that I plan to learn and that should enable me to average sub-30
        consistently with a lot of practice. After that, it's up to you guys to
        catch me up ;D I'm also contemplating switching to the ZB system. I'm
        now investigating the possibility to flip edges during F2L without
        having to learn all 125 algorithms that are listed on Zbigniew's site.
        Dan Harris and me had a very enlightning conversation about this
        yesterday and I'm going to post about this subject later. Cheers, LarsV

        Hello everyone. Since WC2003 went off so well I think it would be nice
        to have more frequent competitions :) Anyway, I for one have already
        made plans to attend the European Championships in 2004, assuming it is
        open to non-Europeans :) Also I would like to say that I am *very*
        interested in organizing an Eastern US/Full US competition. I will
        probably try to organize an unofficial competition at my school (around
        12,000 undergrads) to get an idea of how to do this. I already had one
        of the official timers from speedstacks.com, and I recently ordered a
        tournament display as well. Once that comes in I want to put this
        unofficial competition into the works. Also I would really love to
        compete if I help organize a local/eastern/US competition, whatever it
        turns out to be. If I were to hold a competition I would be able to try
        to locate a place here in Raleigh, North Carolina which I think would be
        an ok location for an eastern competition because it is in the middle
        between Florida and Maine, however I am not fixed on trying to hold it
        here if I have it. I am trying to find out the rules for setting up a
        competition officially, and I have been in contact with David Hedley
        Jones and Dan Gosbee, so I have somewhat of an idea of what is required.
        Would anyone from the US be interested in attending an official
        competition? I am shooting for somewhere around summer of 2004, so if
        the competition pulls through we would probably not be able to attend
        the European championships, but think of how cool it would be to have a
        European and a US competition in the same year? This would help
        considerably for letting people know about WC2005 if it pulls through
        also. Anyway I think it would be required to have a third party
        organizer, though I am still trying to find this information out. First
        of all would anyone be willing to compete in a Eastern US, or US
        competition in summer of 2004? If the competition is only Eastern,
        anyone who shows up would of course be able to compete, at least that is
        what I would like to plan. If we get someone to help organize around the
        Midwest, then the competition could have a very central location to
        everyone and be a full blown US championship. If the competition would
        just be Eastern Regional one then I can definitely start trying to find
        a location and hold it here in Raleigh. Also would anyone know who to
        talk to in order to find an organizer? Where is a good place to start? I
        wouldn't mind organizing the competition if I can't find someone to help
        out, though I would rather help as much as I can but find a third party
        organizer and still be able to compete. So if anyone is interested in
        competing, or helping organize or anything PLEASE let me know. I'm just
        trying to see if there is any interest, and if there is I want to get
        the ball rolling. If nothing else I'll organize a North Carolina
        state-wide competition, which would be easier to set up, and maybe
        someone will take the idea and run with it for a US competition. I have
        one official timer and a tournament display to donate, as well as my
        time. Would anyone else be willing to help set this up, or be willing to
        compete? E-mail me or send a message to this group if you're interested.
        Hope to hear from a lot of you, Chris

        I think this idea of a 2004 US championship is wonderful. And after
        seeing the very long distances people traveled for RWC 03', i think
        people would come from anywhere in the country, and go anywhere, just to
        participate. Have it anywhere in the states and I'll make it, just say
        the word. I should also have an 'official' timer by then, which i would
        be more than willing to donate for the length of the competition.

        Raleigh. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also would anyone know who to talk to in
        order to &gt; &gt; find an &gt; &gt; organizer? Where is a good place to
        start? I &gt; &gt; wouldn't mind &gt; &gt; organizing the competition if
        I can't find someone &gt; &gt; to help out, &gt; &gt; though I would
        rather help as much as I can but find &gt; &gt; a third party &gt; &gt;
        organizer and still be able to compete. So if &gt; &gt; anyone is
        interested &gt; &gt; in competing, or helping organize or anything
        PLEASE &gt; &gt; let me know. &gt; &gt; I'm just trying to see if there
        is any interest, and &gt; &gt; if there is I &gt; &gt; want to get the
        ball rolling. If nothing else I'll &gt; &gt; organize a North &gt; &gt;
        Carolina state-wide competition, which would be &gt; &gt; easier to set
        up, &gt; &gt; and maybe someone will take the idea and run with it &gt;
        &gt; for a US &gt; &gt; competition. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have one
        official timer and a tournament display &gt; &gt; to donate, as &gt;
        &gt; well as my time. Would anyone else be willing to &gt; &gt; help set
        this up, &gt; &gt; or be willing to compete? E-mail me or send a &gt;
        &gt; message to this group &gt; &gt; if you're interested. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Hope to hear from a lot of you, &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Same here, I would love to attend such a thing. By then I'll probably
        get an official timer to bring along also. But I also know that
        organizing these types of things is very hard, especially without the
        proper help. A logistical nightmere to say the least. I know there are a
        fair number of cubist from the Carolina area and you may have enough
        friends on campus to chip in, so you might have the proper resources to
        get it all going. Just keep me (us) posted... I'll try to help in any
        way possible and see if there is any interest in my university cube
        club. Might even get funding for a group of students to travel to
        Raleigh :). Either way once you set a date and location, I'll get some
        decent publicity for it. Oh ya, and make sure it's not in hte school
        year, during finals week, etc... Summer is ideal, and I would say
        sometime in June (just to allow for some unforseen delays). -Doug --- In

        attending an official competition? I am shooting for somewhere &gt;
        around summer of 2004, so if the competition pulls through we would &gt;
        probably not be able to attend the European championships, but think
        &gt; of how cool it would be to have a European and a US competition in
        &gt; the same year? This would help considerably for letting people know
        &gt; about WC2005 if it pulls through also. &gt; &gt; Anyway I think it
        would be required to have a third party organizer, &gt; though I am
        still trying to find this information out. First of all &gt; would
        anyone be willing to compete in a Eastern US, or US &gt; competition in
        summer of 2004? If the competition is only Eastern, &gt; anyone who
        shows up would of course be able to compete, at least &gt; that is what
        I would like to plan. If we get someone to help &gt; organize around the
        Midwest, then the competition could have a very &gt; central location to

        I very much enjoyed the Toronto championships and would go anywhere in
        the states to go to an official US Championship. Although seeing as
        Toronto is kind of on the east it would be nice if it was on the west
        like in LA or in the OC (Orange County). lol that would mean a 15min

        i think it would be cool to have a bunch of regional
        championships...like southeast regional championship, southwest regional
        championship, etc. Then have someone in the central part of the states
        host a finals championship. This way there won't be as much 'extreme'
        travel for everyone to be involved in a US championship in some way.
        Maybe the prize for qualifying for the US finals would be an expense
        paid trip. This of course would take many many more people to organize,
        but it would make things a lot more interesting. there is the problem of
        course, that you wouldn't be able to meet up with all the people you'd
        like to see from across the country...I dunno, just my two cents.

        What an exciting idea! I am in Wilmington, and I would certainly be
        willing to attend and help. I would particularly be interested in

        Ok, my first question is "Are these competitions going to be open or
        closed?". For example, can Canadians enter the U.S. competition, or can
        Non-Europeans enter the European competition, etc. Maybe there will be
        enough of a "cube dynamic" for there to be a Canadian championships, but

        That sounds great! I would love to attend a US competition. I think
        organizing them would be easier if someone had carried out that idea we

        A competition would be really nice. Will you accept bit of an anomaly,
        such as cubr art? Those of you who have seen me in Toronto, will surely
        testfy that my 3d designs were made from actual Rubik's cubes, the same
        cubes you use for speedcubing. And Ihave to solve the cube, only slower.
        :-) I also like the idea of the Rubik's cube group, a group of cube-
        lovers. Agin, it should accept all cube trends, as long as rhey are
        rwlatwd to the Rubik's cube. Hana a kostky --- In

        interested in organizing an Eastern US/Full US &gt; &gt; competition. I
        will probably try to organize an unofficial &gt; &gt; competition at my
        school (around 12,000 undergrads) to get an idea &gt; &gt; of how to do
        this. I already had one of the official timers from &gt; &gt;
        speedstacks.com, and I recently ordered a tournament display as &gt;
        &gt; well. Once that comes in I want to put this unofficial &gt;
        competition &gt; &gt; into the works. Also I would really love to
        compete if I help &gt; &gt; organize a local/eastern/US competition,
        whatever it turns out to &gt; &gt; be. If I were to hold a competition I
        would be able to try to &gt; &gt; locate a place here in Raleigh, North
        Carolina which I think would &gt; &gt; be an ok location for an eastern
        competition because it is in the &gt; &gt; middle between Florida and
        Maine, however I am not fixed on trying &gt; &gt; to hold it here if I
        have it. I am trying to find out the rules &gt; for &gt; &gt; setting up
        a competition officially, and I have been in contact &gt; with &gt; &gt;
        David Hedley Jones and Dan Gosbee, so I have somewhat of an idea &gt; of
        &gt; &gt; what is required. Would anyone from the US be interested in
        &gt; &gt; attending an official competition? I am shooting for somewhere
        &gt; &gt; around summer of 2004, so if the competition pulls through we
        &gt; would &gt; &gt; probably not be able to attend the European
        championships, but &gt; think &gt; &gt; of how cool it would be to have
        a European and a US competition in &gt; &gt; the same year? This would
        help considerably for letting people &gt; know &gt; &gt; about WC2005 if
        it pulls through also. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway I think it would be
        required to have a third party &gt; organizer, &gt; &gt; though I am
        still trying to find this information out. First of &gt; all &gt; &gt;
        would anyone be willing to compete in a Eastern US, or US &gt; &gt;
        competition in summer of 2004? If the competition is only &gt; Eastern,
        &gt; &gt; anyone who shows up would of course be able to compete, at
        least &gt; &gt; that is what I would like to plan. If we get someone to
        help &gt; &gt; organize around the Midwest, then the competition could
        have a &gt; very &gt; &gt; central location to everyone and be a full
        blown US championship. &gt; &gt; If the competition would just be
        Eastern Regional one then I can &gt; &gt; definitely start trying to
        find a location and hold it here in &gt; &gt; Raleigh. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Also would anyone know who to talk to in order to find an &gt; &gt;
        organizer? Where is a good place to start? I wouldn't mind &gt; &gt;
        organizing the competition if I can't find someone to help out, &gt;
        &gt; though I would rather help as much as I can but find a third party
        &gt; &gt; organizer and still be able to compete. So if anyone is &gt;
        interested &gt; &gt; in competing, or helping organize or anything
        PLEASE let me know. &gt; &gt; I'm just trying to see if there is any
        interest, and if there is I &gt; &gt; want to get the ball rolling. If
        nothing else I'll organize a &gt; North &gt; &gt; Carolina state-wide
        competition, which would be easier to set up, &gt; &gt; and maybe
        someone will take the idea and run with it for a US &gt; &gt;
        competition. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have one official timer and a
        tournament display to donate, as &gt; &gt; well as my time. Would anyone
        else be willing to help set this &gt; up, &gt; &gt; or be willing to
        compete? E-mail me or send a message to this &gt; group &gt; &gt; if
        you're interested. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope to hear from a lot of you,

        corner of top layer E: last three corners of top layer His LL system is
        also interesting. I am yet to find any other LL system that is more
        efficient than his (apart from learning 1211 algorithms). Of course, you
        can do better if you prepare the LL a little first before getting there,
        but I'd say Tony's is the most efficient that does not require LL
        preparation. &gt; After that I connect these two blocks to get a 2x2x1
        block. Finally I &gt; solve the 3rd edge and insert the block. Now that
        I am able to &gt; visualize this during preinspection, I am also trying
        to solve one of &gt; the three other white corners if that would be
        easier to solve. Interesting... How do you intend to make use of this
        extra corner? I would not have seen the use of solving a single corner,
        but Doug Li's video shows an interesting technique that can make use of
        it (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/videos.html). That is, the last
        corner and edge are simultaneously inserted into different slots. Of
        course, 2 extra movements are required to align and restore the D face,
        and recognition is a bit more difficult. Personally, I find it easier to
        attach an extra edge onto the 2x2x2 instead of an extra corner (it
        usually takes just one move after the 2x2x2 without any forward
        planning, provided that you don't mind picking any colour). &gt; The
        biggest gain should come from removing one step of the solution. Right,
        you remove a step in the LL: 1. 2x2x2 2. two edges 3. pair 4. pair 5.
        pair + orient LL edges 6. LL 6 steps instead of the standard 7 of
        Fridrich. Also, my system: 1. 2x2x2 2. square 3. square 4. F2L edge +
        orient LL edges 5. F2L corner + permute LL edges 6. LL 6 steps. All the
        optimisation is done in the first two layers. Ryan

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi I don't want to brag... But it was a fact at WC2003 that I had
        absolutely no problem standing there on the podium. Let me consider what
        I think made this possible for me, and perhaps help some of you: 1. I
        consider cubing a hobby. Becoming a 'champion' has never been a goal for
        me. I set out with a realistic, yet hard goal. I would try to make it in
        the top 20. In the end, I didn't succeed, because the competition was
        very good. But I am one of the few who was able to set under-average
        times in both my two rounds. (My best average at that time was 26, and I
        had 25 and 24.8 in the contest). Remember that if you set yourself an
        impossible goal, you can stay relaxed in the knowledge that you have
        nothing to lose, and no chance to win. 2. I have a lot of experience
        standing in front of a group, as I used to be a trainer for five years.
        I learnt how to prepare standing in front of an audience. When I started
        I was very nervous, but I learnt that having a plan and knowing exactly
        what to do lets nerves melt immediately. 3. I am convinced that no one
        present would expect me to perform 'great' or set any records. I stood
        there for me, and for no one else. 4. Yasmara (my wife) having absolute
        faith in me, and being there. 5. Right before the final competition,
        Jessica, Mirek and us went for lunch. Now that may seem stupid, but
        taking your mind off the competition helps a lot. Eating and drinking
        makes you comfortable. 6. Two year of practicing meditation, Aikido and
        T'ai Chi. This is only a small part of staying relaxed, but it means you
        will become skilled at controlling your body in extreme situations. So
        my tips are these: - when you feel you are getting nervous, concentrate
        on what you know: you can solve a cube very fast. Breath deep and slow
        and say to yourself: "There is no one here. There is just me and my
        cube. I am completely relaxed. I will solve this cube lightning fast. I
        trust in my skills." - wait for a while in this state if you can until
        you can breath normally. - practice performing in front of people.
        Especially people who expect great things from you. - see yourself as
        the worst cuber of all times. You can only improve from there and you
        will always impress yourself. So focus on the guys who are better then
        you and say to yourself: "I can never win from him. All I can do is
        participate. The result is unimportant." - have someone supportive
        travel with you, or team up with someone to be your 'support-buddy'. For
        this person: remember that saying "you're the best cuber of all times"
        just makes things worse. Say things like "we're here to have fun. I
        don't care what position you end up." - eat, drink, go to the bathroom,
        make sure your body feels ok. - try some form of 'skill' that could help
        you, whether it be hypnotherapy, meditation, guided visualisations, or
        pep-talks. - if you're well known in the community, then realize that
        all of us know about your skill. We have seen your video's, your
        averages in the sunday contest, we know each other. If you mess up
        completely in the competition, remember that everyone still knows your
        average. - never ever ever brag about a 'record' that you never had,
        that was actually a lucky case, or a one time event. If necessary, only
        tell people your average, and maybe even add a second to not make
        expectations too high. Of course, if you feel self assured you can tell
        people anything you like. Hope that helps Michiel

        Hi, I've been putting a lot of thought lately in finding a way to
        gradually learn the ZB (Zbigniew-Bruchem) system. This involves solving
        the cross, solving 3 F2L pairs, flipping the LL edges while solving the
        4th F2L pair, and finally solving the LL in one. But nobody just learns
        all the 799 algorithms required (including inverted, mirrored and
        mirrored inverse cases) in one go. As with the classic F2L/LL system, we
        have to find a way to start with a "beginner's method" (like the 4-look
        and 3-look LL) and then slowly work your way to learning to full set of
        algorithms (like the full 2-look LL). Ohterwise, even the most dedicated
        people will find it very hard to keep themselves motivated when learning
        this system. After some discussions with Dan Harris, Dan and I worked
        out a system that could very well prove to be the ideal "intermediate
        method". The way I solve F2L, 95% of the pairs are what I call
        "pair-insert" pairs. You do a 3-4 move sequence to pair the corner and
        edge and follow it with a 3-4 move sequence to insert it. After the
        pairing process, you are always left with two trivial cases: the corner
        and edge are either connected in the LL, or they are seperated in such a
        way that they can be inserted easily. Now instead of learning ALL
        optimal algs for pairing AND inserting the pair and flipping the LL
        edges, you could just pair them up the normal way and then do the edge
        flipping while you insert them. This would require learning only 16
        sequences, since there are 8 ways the LL edges can be flipped for each
        of the 2 trivial cases I mentioned. These sequence are also part of the
        full ZB system (tables D1 and E2 on Zbigniew's site) so you only learn
        usefull things. Of course, the more intuitive approach explained on Ryan
        Heise's website is just as good. This would average approximately 10
        moves for the final pair. Then for solving the LL, you could learn the
        42 COLL algorithms (solve corners + orientation last layer). Those
        algorithms are also a subset of the ZB system, so once again you only
        learn usefull things. After that, you are left with either a 3-cycle of
        edges, the 2-permutation or the cross permutation of edges, which most
        speedcubers would consider to be among their faster algorithms. The
        average number of moves for solving the LL this way is approximately
        19,5 moves. The advantages of this sytem are: - it's a complete system
        that enables you to solve the cube every time. - It averages only
        slightly more moves as the classic F2L/OLL/PLL system, but it can
        certainly be just as fast. - you already know a small number of
        algorithms required for the ZB system. - you get familiarised with the
        overall feel and the thinking and recognition process of the ZB system.
        - you only learn usefull things if your long term ambition is to learn
        the ZB system. And above all: it's fun! I've been practicing it the last
        couple of days and it looks as if it can be really fast. LarsV

        Ask a question, and answers come from Netherlands, USA, and Japan. This
        is cool :-) Thanks for your very detailed messages, they do help. I
        think I didn't pay enough attention to others' extensive surveys. After
        all, it really does not seem that hard, give me 2 months! &gt; What do
        you think will be the limits of your system? Will it be possible, maybe
        with some additional algorithms, to one day beat 16 seconds? The limits
        of this approach? Well, I don't know exactly, the limit is where people
        can't go faster. For now it's 20.5s, and *I* will never be able to reach
        16s. "Theoritically" speaking I would say steps1+2=8s (F2L minus 2
        pieces), step3=3s and step4=5s --&gt; 16s. But my theory says 16s too
        for F2L+OLL+PLL ;-) &gt; For step 4 the fastest way may be to solve the
        last L and R edge in one algorithm, and then solve the M layer edges in
        one algorithm. (Step 4 - Method 4) Mhhh... Maybe... Maybe not. Ok, 1
        look is impossible, so 2 looks seems good. But I don't know how fast
        algs for random M pieces can be (ask Minh Tha√Ø?). (recognition time?
        dexterity?) I think that the best solution would not be 1 only
        technique, but an hybridation of many, as I've written on my page. Think
        of methods as complementary. Some are good in specific situations, some
        in others. Look at my "Step 4 - Method 2". It may seem a bit difficult,
        3 steps... But it is not. In fact, sub-steps 1 and 2 can make only one,
        if you slow down to 5 moves/sec during sub-step 1. UL and UR are easily
        located while performing the move. They are the only remaining L and R
        edges, with bright colors (that's why I choose to put yellow and white
        on the sides, and white on the right side makes step 2 easier). Plus,
        their orientation is constrained at the end of the sub-step 1 move. Ok,
        I may be biased, I like this method because it's mine ;-) But most of
        all, I like it because it's almost completely intuitive, you can learn
        it in 10 minutes. And maybe, if you know some patterns, you can shorten
        the worst combined sequences. (&lt;15 moves...4 moves/sec...) The
        hybridation may look like this: *one*) If UL or UR is solved
        automagically (chances: 23/144), or if you can solve one with 1 or 2
        moves (?/?) ---&gt; Do "Step 4 - Method 1". *two*) If edges orientation
        is easy, let's say 5 moves (chances: 13/32) ---&gt; Do "Step 4 - Method
        2". *three*) Else ---&gt; Do "Step 4 - Method 4" for example. *...*) The
        problem with multi-methods is decision time (experience is the key). So
        here's another idea... At the beginning of step 3, while looking for
        corners configuration, you may detect, half consciously, how many
        misoriented edges you'll have later (3 is perfect) *if* you stick to
        corners sequences that don't flip edges. So you can prepare mentaly to
        perform *two* or completely forget it in the decision stage. &gt; How is
        the number of moves going? On your site you write 48.4 average. Is this
        number going down too? 45 is not difficult (as with other methods), but
        of course, not in speedcubing. I think I'm slightly above 50, mainly
        because of too many (but fast!) UMR moves during step 2. By the way, I
        just updated my site with sexy animated Java cubes and pictures. Gilles

        I also wasn't too nervous, but I think this is because I have experience
        with being in front of people. I do magic. Only close up magic, though,
        so I was never in front of that many people. Only about fifteen or
        twenty at the most. But it still helped me. I also completely agree with
        your first tip. If you have your mind set on just doing as well as you
        can, and trying to do better than everyone, then you'll get much more
        nervous. You should just cube like normal and have a good time. It's
        just for fun, not for competition. (well, it is for competition, but
        don't let your brain tell you that.)

        I think that it's also a good thing to make yourself as nervous as
        possible when training, but not when you're at the competition. I went
        to a summer camp for six weeks, and after that, I had two weeks before
        going to the WC. At camp, I practiced dozens of times each day in front
        of people. Sometimes there were 5 people watching, other times there
        were 20, but usually as people noticed me turning the cube so fast, they
        came over to watch and soon there were over 30 or 40 people watching!
        The best part about the camp was that there was a talent show toward the
        end of each session, and every student and most of the staff would be
        there watching. That comes out to around 600-700 people in the audience.
        Since I went to the camp for both sessions, I got to perform twice on
        stage under lots of pressure. First session I got 18.3 seconds, and 2nd
        session I got 19 seconds. I felt that putting myself under high-pressure
        situations paid off. Even though my fastest time in the competition
        wasn't close to my average at the time (time was 19.38 s, and my avg.
        then was 16.3) my studio cube wasn't working the way I wanted it to (one
        of the faces was too loose), so I had to use one of the rubiks.com cubes
        they provided (or whatever brand they were) and that slowed me down some
        since I wasn't used to using a stiffer cube. I think that at the
        competition, you should always try to think of the event as "fun" and
        not "I'm here to be competitive." However, before the competition you
        must expose yourself to as much pressure as possible. I recently found a
        great way to do this. All you need is about 5-10 people watching you,
        but while you're solving, have them say stuff like "you suck" "you're
        going slower" "you can't solve the cube" and other random stuff. I got
        very nervous once when I had some friends do that and got around 25
        seconds. This may not seem to be helpful, but you will notice that your
        hands shake a lot when you get some people to say those things to you
        while solving, and also it's harder to concentrate, so over time, the
        shake will go away, you'll be able to block out the distractions in
        order to concentrate, and you be much faster. Andy

        I can affirm that last idea. I have some friends here at college that do
        that anyway (but just for fun) and I find it really helpful in honing my
        concentration. One time when there were about seven of us, only two knew
        about my "skill", and it was brought up that I could solve it- during
        one of the solves I felt very good about it- even while they were saying
        stuff like that. I finished very well- I usually range between 45 and 55
        seconds, and that time was my first under 40... 39.90 seconds. I was so
        hyped! I was also surprised, since the others were giving the usual
        reaction I get when new people watch me, and that is usually pretty
        distracting. I know I can do better- my hands shook a lot too :) My two
        cents ^-^ CMG -----Original Message----- From: Andy C

        About nerves braking I think that it's also a good thing to make
        yourself as nervous as possible when training, but not when you're at
        the competition. I went to a summer camp for six weeks, and after that,
        I had two weeks before going to the WC. At camp, I practiced dozens of
        times each day in front of people. Sometimes there were 5 people
        watching, other times there were 20, but usually as people noticed me
        turning the cube so fast, they came over to watch and soon there were
        over 30 or 40 people watching! The best part about the camp was that
        there was a talent show toward the end of each session, and every
        student and most of the staff would be there watching. That comes out to
        around 600-700 people in the audience. Since I went to the camp for both
        sessions, I got to perform twice on stage under lots of pressure. First
        session I got 18.3 seconds, and 2nd session I got 19 seconds. I felt
        that putting myself under high-pressure situations paid off. Even though
        my fastest time in the competition wasn't close to my average at the
        time (time was 19.38 s, and my avg. then was 16.3) my studio cube wasn't
        working the way I wanted it to (one of the faces was too loose), so I
        had to use one of the rubiks.com cubes they provided (or whatever brand
        they were) and that slowed me down some since I wasn't used to using a
        stiffer cube. I think that at the competition, you should always try to
        think of the event as "fun" and not "I'm here to be competitive."
        However, before the competition you must expose yourself to as much
        pressure as possible. I recently found a great way to do this. All you
        need is about 5-10 people watching you, but while you're solving, have
        them say stuff like "you suck" "you're going slower" "you can't solve
        the cube" and other random stuff. I got very nervous once when I had
        some friends do that and got around 25 seconds. This may not seem to be
        helpful, but you will notice that your hands shake a lot when you get
        some people to say those things to you while solving, and also it's
        harder to concentrate, so over time, the shake will go away, you'll be
        able to block out the distractions in order to concentrate, and you be
        much faster. Andy http://users.rcn.com/rhodee/cube.html Yahoo! Groups

        If you want to hear about RWC 2003, you just need to check out the
        websites of various cubers. I have posted some stuff here:
        http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksWorldChampionships2003.ht
        ml On my main RWC page I've got links to many other cubers RWC pages so
        you'll easily be able to find lots of pics from everyone. :) Re other
        methods, the discussion has recently centred around the "ZB method". Ron
        van Bruchem and Zbigniew Zborowski both independently came up with the
        idea, hence it's now referred to as the ZB method. If you look at the
        posts from the last week you'll find heaps of discussion about this. The
        key element of the ZB method is that you insert 3 of the 4 corner+edge
        pairs in the F2L, then insert the 4th corner+edge pair *and* orient the
        LL edges at the same time. &gt;From what I've read so far, the ZB method
        sounds very interesting. However, I'm currently working on moving to a
        3-look LL, so for now I'm just going to focus on learning the rest of
        the PLL algs! Jasmine. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Some good advice there Michiel. :) My two main reasons for going to RWC
        were (i) meet all you wonderful cubers and (ii) have fun! As a result, I
        wasn't especially nervous, however, I'm sure I would have been if I had
        been a serious contender for anything. My personal aims were just to
        achieve good personal times, even if those times were *way* behind the
        top cubers. :) And it also meant a lot to me that my fiance, Peter, was
        with me. :) Jasmine. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; I don't want to brag... But it was a fact at WC2003 that I had &gt;
        absolutely no problem standing there on the podium. &gt; &gt; Let me
        consider what I think made this possible for me, and perhaps &gt; help
        some of you: &gt; &gt; 1. I consider cubing a hobby. Becoming a
        'champion' has never been a &gt; goal for me. I set out with a
        realistic, yet hard goal. I would try &gt; to make it in the top 20. In
        the end, I didn't succeed, because the &gt; competition was very good.
        But I am one of the few who was able to &gt; set under-average times in
        both my two rounds. (My best average at &gt; that time was 26, and I had
        25 and 24.8 in the contest). Remember &gt; that if you set yourself an
        impossible goal, you can stay relaxed in &gt; the knowledge that you
        have nothing to lose, and no chance to win. &gt; &gt; 2. I have a lot of
        experience standing in front of a group, as I used &gt; to be a trainer
        for five years. I learnt how to prepare standing in &gt; front of an
        audience. When I started I was very nervous, but I learnt &gt; that
        having a plan and knowing exactly what to do lets nerves melt &gt;
        immediately. &gt; &gt; 3. I am convinced that no one present would
        expect me to &gt; perform 'great' or set any records. I stood there for
        me, and for no &gt; one else. &gt; &gt; 4. Yasmara (my wife) having
        absolute faith in me, and being there. &gt; &gt; 5. Right before the
        final competition, Jessica, Mirek and us went for &gt; lunch. Now that
        may seem stupid, but taking your mind off the &gt; competition helps a
        lot. Eating and drinking makes you comfortable. &gt; &gt; 6. Two year of
        practicing meditation, Aikido and T'ai Chi. This is &gt; only a small
        part of staying relaxed, but it means you will become &gt; skilled at
        controlling your body in extreme situations. &gt; &gt; So my tips are
        these: &gt; - when you feel you are getting nervous, concentrate on what
        you &gt; know: you can solve a cube very fast. Breath deep and slow and
        say to &gt; yourself: "There is no one here. There is just me and my
        cube. I am &gt; completely relaxed. I will solve this cube lightning
        fast. I trust in &gt; my skills." &gt; - wait for a while in this state
        if you can until you can breath &gt; normally. &gt; - practice
        performing in front of people. Especially people who &gt; expect great
        things from you. &gt; - see yourself as the worst cuber of all times.
        You can only improve &gt; from there and you will always impress
        yourself. So focus on the guys &gt; who are better then you and say to
        yourself: "I can never win from &gt; him. All I can do is participate.
        The result is unimportant." &gt; - have someone supportive travel with
        you, or team up with someone to &gt; be your 'support-buddy'. For this
        person: remember that &gt; saying "you're the best cuber of all times"
        just makes things worse. &gt; Say things like "we're here to have fun. I
        don't care what position &gt; you end up." &gt; - eat, drink, go to the
        bathroom, make sure your body feels ok. &gt; - try some form of 'skill'
        that could help you, whether it be &gt; hypnotherapy, meditation, guided
        visualisations, or pep-talks. &gt; - if you're well known in the
        community, then realize that all of us &gt; know about your skill. We
        have seen your video's, your averages in &gt; the sunday contest, we
        know each other. If you mess up completely in &gt; the competition,
        remember that everyone still knows your average. &gt; - never ever ever
        brag about a 'record' that you never had, that was &gt; actually a lucky
        case, or a one time event. If necessary, only tell &gt; people your
        average, and maybe even add a second to not make &gt; expectations too
        high. Of course, if you feel self assured you can &gt; tell people
        anything you like. &gt; &gt; Hope that helps &gt; &gt; Michiel

        Last weekend I was in Melbourne (Australia) visiting a friend. We went
        to a cafe where all the waiters/waitresses were wearing black t- shirts
        with various images on them. One of them had Rubik's cubes on it. As you
        can imagine, I was pretty excited when I saw this. :) When we were
        ordering, I asked another waiter if the waitress with the cube t-shirt
        could solve the cube. Turns out that she wasn't a cuber. I mentioned
        that I was and this is why I had been so excited by the t-shirt. My
        friend then told them that I had just been to RWC. Then, I asked them if
        they wanted a demo (I'm always keen to seize any opportunity to promote
        cubing!) and reached over to grab my cube out of my bag. They were very
        surprised that I just happened to have a cube with me. I told them that
        all speedcubers carry cubes with them. ;) They scrambled it for me, and
        I did a slow solve (65 seconds -- my current average is 50-55s). By this
        point, quite a few of the cafe staff had crowded around our table to
        watch. They were all very impressed by the 65s, but I told them it was
        too slow and got them to scramble again. The next solve I did 45s, which
        I was happy with since it's faster than my current average. The waitress
        with the cube t-shirt was so impressed that she then gave me her
        t-shirt!! After dinner, my friend and I went to say goodbye to the
        waitress. She said she was inspired to learn the cube now and asked me
        where she could buy one. I told her and also wrote down some useful cube
        websites. :) It was a fun night. :) Jasmine.

        my brain didn't feel nervous, nor did my body as a whole, however, my
        hands appeared to be nervous. I don't tend to get nervous often and I'm
        pretty comfortable with the idea of cubing in public. It was kinda weird
        because usually if I'm nervous, then my whole body feels nervous, but
        this time it was just my hands. My hands were shaking during the solve,
        even though the rest of my body felt reasonably calm. Does this happen

        The method, not the man (well, both I hope). Ok, recently, everybody's
        talking about orienting the last 4 edges when solving the last F2L pair,
        in order to finish the cube in 1 sequence: corners + edges permutation
        (ZeeBee method). This interesting idea is all but new. Remember...
        Petrus' method. Steps 1+2+3+4 achieve the same result, and Helmstetter's
        sequences (http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/solutions_567.html)
        give all the solutions. Step 1=2s (2x2x2 or cross, same complexity) Step
        2=3s Step 3=2s (5 moves) Step 4=4s (2-side fingertricks) Gilles. PS:
        Seriously, you really want to learn 177 sequences + inv. + sym. ??? :-)

        only happens when I'm trying to show someone a fast (for me) solve. I
        think it is due to the adrenaline rush from having to do a performance,
        rather than nervousness or fear of failure. Jaap

        been doing this kind of method for about 4 years, ever since I first
        glanced Lars's site, without looking at its details. I thought he was
        doing the edge orientations after solving all but one corner- edge pair.
        Since then I've been doing this: 1. cross 2. 3 corner-edge pairs 3.
        orient edges 4. last corner-edge pair using turns of only 2 faces 5.
        last layer in 3 steps. I showed this to Ron a few years ago the first
        few times I met him. What is new about the ZB method is that the two
        steps I've numbered 3 and 4 are combined. For me it is far too much work
        to learn all the move sequences for this combined step, but I think I
        might learn a few special cases. If I want to get faster, it is more of
        a priority to get my recognition time of corner-edge pairs down. Two
        days ago I set my personal best at 40 seconds. It was a non-lucky time,
        but it was simply the case that the corner-edge pairs were immediately
        easy to spot. My usual time at the moment is 55-75 seconds. Jaap

        I don't really have much cubing experience but when I play auditions on
        the violin, my hands used to shake quite a lot. Actually, even my legs
        would shake just due to nervousnes. However, after 12 years of being in
        a youth orchestra and facing around 2 auditions a year, it doesn't
        really happen anymore. I think just practice cubing in public will
        eventually calm everything down. -Tyson --- In

        yourself as nervous as possible when training, but not when you're at
        the competition. I went to a summer camp for six weeks, and after that,
        I had two weeks before going to the WC. At camp, I practiced dozens of
        times each day in front of people. Sometimes there were 5 people
        watching, other times there were 20, but usually as people noticed me
        turning the cube so fast, they came over to watch and soon there were
        over 30 or 40 people watching! The best part about the camp was that
        there was a talent show toward the end of each session, and every
        student and most of the staff would be there watching. That comes out to
        around 600-700 people in the audience. Since I went to the camp for both
        sessions, I got to perform twice on stage under lots of pressure. First
        session I got 18.3 seconds, and 2nd session I got 19 seconds. I felt
        that putting myself under high-pressure situations paid off. Even though
        my fastest time in the competition wasn't close to my average at the
        time (time was 19.38 s, and my avg. then was 16.3) my studio cube wasn't
        working the way I wanted it to (one of the faces was too loose), so I
        had to use one of the rubiks.com cubes they provided (or whatever brand
        they were) and that slowed me down some since I wasn't used to using a
        stiffer cube. I think that at the competition, you should always try to
        think of the event as "fun" and not "I'm here to be competitive."
        However, before the competition you must expose yourself to as much
        pressure as possible. I recently found a great way to do this. All you
        need is about 5-10 people watching you, but while you're solving, have
        them say stuff like "you suck" "you're going slower" "you can't solve
        the cube" and other random stuff. I got very nervous once when I had
        some friends do that and got around 25 seconds. This may not seem to be
        helpful, but you will notice that your hands shake a lot when you get
        some people to say those things to you while solving, and also it's
        harder to concentrate, so over time, the shake will go away, you'll be
        able to block out the distractions in order to concentrate, and you be
        much faster. Andy http://users.rcn.com/rhodee/cube.html Yahoo! Groups

        Maybe in addition to cubing in front of people it could help to race
        against them, for example let them count to 100 and claim you'll have
        the cube finished before they are done. That way it becomes a
        competition, you might be distracted by the numbers and watchers might
        have more fun because they're actively involved. Also, I'm currently
        speedassembling the 3x3 and I can tell you that I'm super nervous every
        time. My hands start shaking, I make mistakes. Even in my own bedroom. I
        just can't seem to calm down... of course I rush way too much, but then
        again I think I have to if I want to get better times ;-) Cheers! Stefan

        I'm sure somebody found this before, but I just did and think it's nice
        enough to let you know: Doing L2B2R2F2 three times will result in the
        pattern I call XX and you'll easily see why I do. That's of course
        boring, but you can execute these moves without changing the grip at
        all. For this, put your right thumb at the U center and your right
        middle finger at the D center. Then place your left middle finger on top
        of the ULF corner and your left thumb below the BLF corner. Now execute
        the sequence without ever changing on which stickers your fingers are.
        Of course the cube as a whole will be rotated during the process. You
        can also do it in different ways, depending on the direction of the half
        turns. If I say A for anticlockwise and C for clockwise then for wild
        turning I'd recommend AACCAACCAACC while ACACACACACAC looks less
        interesting. Cheers! Stefan

        &gt; andy, please tell me that you won that talent show :D The talent
        show was not "competitive" so they weren't judging the best acts and the
        worst acts.... But mostly everyone at the camp already knew who I was
        and what I was going to do on stage so when my name was announced they
        all started cheering. I was behind the curtain and the I couldn't even
        hear the emcee talking into the microphone because the cheering was so
        loud. Eventually they all shut up (which was good, since I wanted to
        solve the cube, not listen to people clap). I had the same result when I
        left the stage: everyone was cheering so that you couldn't hear anything
        else. I did it in 18.3 seconds. Here is a link to a picture:
        http://www.explo.org/eni/daily_photos/dp_718_6.shtml The person to my
        right was timing me. The text below the picture has three errors: "
        solves it almost 20 times a day" should be "solves it over 100 times a
        day," "hopes to go to the wc" should be "is going to the wc," and "go to
        the wc this fall" should be "go to the wc this summer." It was cool to
        solve the cube on stage though. Andy

        I am looking for information on the web describing the Waterman system.
        So far, I have found this page:
        http://homepage.ntlworld.com/angela.hayden/cube/update_014.html which is
        very good, but unfortunately it does not cover everything. I would
        really like to find out information such as: 1. how many algorithms
        required for each step + algorithm length 2. the actual algorithm tables
        3. the Waterman recognition technique Ron mentioned earlier etc.. Also,
        I heard the Waterman system includes ways to take advantage of
        unfortunate situations. I am very interested in this. If someone can
        point me to some information, I'd be very grateful. btw, I started
        designing a new corners first method a few months ago just for fun. I'm
        not planning to actually use it, but I just want to explore some of the
        ideas I have floating in my head, and see how low I can get the number
        of moves. Maybe it's also useful to know more than one way to solve the
        cube. Ryan

        I like to count the PLL as 21, just because each algorithm needs to be
        learned seperately, and executed distinctively. Not everyone can mirror
        an alg right on the spot...not many people that i know can especially
        for longer permutations. Anyway...that's not important to my point. I am
        no 'cube master', although the books from the 80s would say I am :P. It
        is important when learning your PLL to learn fast algs, not just ones
        that are easy to remember. When I first learned PLL I chose my algs
        poorly, and I paid dearly, because I had to re-learn over half of them.
        The difference between a poor permutation LL and a good one can mean
        seconds! When picking an PLL alg, or any alg for that matter: *Pick an
        alg with triggers in it (ex: (R U R') (R U') etc. etc.) *Don't pick algs
        that involve too much repositioning your non-turning hand. *If your PLL
        alg is taking over 4 seconds to execute you need to work on getting it
        down or find a better one. did I miss anything? prolly...but i hope this
        helps some of you. -Richard --- Sam Fontana &lt;robot8387@...&gt; wrote:

        45s, which I was happy with since it's &gt; faster than my current

        that's awesome that people got excited about your cubing. i wish i could
        have such luck! that never seems to happen for me for some reason. i've
        cubed in numerous times in public places like airports, restaurants and
        the like, but no one ever seems to give a crap. the most i've ever
        gotten was a comment like "hey my daughter can solve it too..." or
        something similar. when i tape myself and view myself, it really doesn't
        look that impressive when i solve. my best recent average is 32 and i
        almost always solve in less than 60 moves, so 2 turns per second doesn't
        look all that impressive to an onlooker. plus i'm a guy and i don't look
        very approachable and i live in new hampshire USA and we're a bunch of

        I uploaded an updated version of the 89 timer. The old one seemed to
        count to slowly, making the times about 1 second less than they should
        be per 30 s. I also fixed the bug that made the scrambling algorithm do

        make sure your facing as many people in the room as possible (location,
        location, location!) *if your at a table make sure to keep the cube up
        so people can see the cube *dont sit too still, make some arm movements
        so people will notice and look *when your done with a solve sit the cube
        on the table and take a drink of water or something, so if someone is
        watching they will realize the cube is solved (alot of times if you mix
        the cube right after you solve it people wont notice it was ever solved)
        * eye contact! if you notice someone watching you look at them a couple
        times during the solve and make sure to hold the cube up and show them
        after the solve.... theres more, but thats about all i can think of
        right now.. -heath

        It's nice from time to time when people ask intelligent questions about
        the cube, or give ya the praise ;). HOWEVER, I've lately grown tired of
        the standards: "I used to just peal the stickers off." I know we're all
        sick of it. "So do you have a system?" Most people get a simple, "Yes, I
        break it up into smaller steps." but if someone is really interested
        (some guys I've run into in the math building at college for example)
        I'll give them a full explanation and a few websites. I recently typed
        up a whole solution for a girl who asked about it. THOSE people are
        refreshing :) "Have you ever solved that?" To which I reply "Yeah, once
        or twice." Actually though, just two days ago, I was sitting in a halway
        cubing, timing on my calculator, when after about 20 solves, I stopped
        to take a drink from my bottle of water. This girl who had been sitting
        across from me the WHOLE TIME said to me while I was holding a SOLVED
        cube, "Have you ever solved that?" And I just held it up... she seemed
        thoroughly confused. But anyway, most of the time, I like the attention,
        and most of the time I don't mind answering people's questions. And I
        always try to refer people to www.rubiks.dk to see the "really fast
        guys." But, I've never won a t-shirt. Damn. ;) Daniel --- In

        Hey all, I was looking at the old packaged cubes on E-bay the other day,
        and I noticed the ones in the boxes with the clear plastic over them say
        "Over 3 billion combinations" I did some quick math and found that this
        is like McDonalds putting on their signs "Over 7 thousand burgers sold"
        Even though they're up around 100 billion now. The number of
        combinations never ceases to amaze me. Also, I'm in a discrete
        mathematics class and we're doing permutations and combinations, I wish
        I could find a way to casually drop the cube into the discussion :)

        minutes before class and start cubing. Somebody will notice and talk to
        you about it (especially if you don't sit in a corner and if you don't

        Hey Allan, definitely exciting news about the trailer, I know a lot of
        us are really ready to see it :) Also that's awesome that you've gotten
        into the cube! If you catch the speedcubing bug and want to get faster
        then always feel free to post any questions here. Happy cubing, Chris

        Yo guyz... Ok, here's the facts: --Someone from my school brought a
        puzzle that's pretty cool. It's not a Rubik's Cube, but it's globe with
        only the middle edges turning to north-south and east-west. 2
        hemispheres can be solved rather easily, but I'm afraid I need some algs
        from a gliding cube to solve the rest? Also, Ton, do you know which
        puzzle this is? Bm :) --Brent --------------------------------- Do you

        Oh, hehe, I hadn't seen that before. My girlfriend and her friend were
        over here and I was trying to find a way to describe to them how gross
        an underestimate that was (they're NOT math people). McDonalds was the
        only thing I could think of that has anywhere near a huge number of
        things that people are familiar with. And on this website:
        http://www.media.mcdonalds.com/secured/company/history/timeline/ it says
        in 1993, they hit the 95 billionth hamburger mark, so by now I assume
        they're up around 100 billion. So I took (3billion/4.3x10^19) *100
        billion, and got 7000 ish. Did I make an arithmetical mistake? Sorry if
        this comparison has been made before, I honestly hadn't seen it. Just

        The 2x2x2 is quite complex. Congratulations on putting most of it

        I know what you mean. You could put white stickers under it first. Or
        paint the cube white, then put the stickers on. That would actually look
        pretty cool.... Or you could live with it, even though it does get
        annoying. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Gilles Roux"

        Hey guys and girls, The FMC is back and has completed one full week of
        competition all ready! It's back in full force, there are many great
        solutions, and lots can be learnt from these guys about how to solve
        cubes in the fewest moves possible. Just go to www.cubestation.co.uk ,
        and follow the starred link at the top! I will launch a new challenge
        shortly Thanks to everyone who took part, and I hope we can get even
        more participants for the 31/10/03 FMC! Keep on cubing! DanH :) -

        was too slow and got them to scramble &gt; again. The next solve I did
        45s, which I was happy with since it's &gt; faster than my current

        &gt; want to get the ball rolling. I am definitly interested in any type
        of cubing competition. It was unfortunate that I couldn't attend the
        WC2003, everyone I know will tell you that I wish I could have been
        there. I live in Maryland, and attend the University of Maryland, so
        I'll do East Coast, National, anything! Keep me updated on any
        developments on that. On a side note, are there any Maryland cubers on
        here? I would love to meet other speedcubers(speedcubists?) in person.

        it a 2 look at the end! Like you said you will need algorithms, and I
        doubt they will be too small. So you will have well over 70 algs and
        still have 2 looks at the end. I'll try to figure out the different
        combinations for that step anyway. ;)

        At RWC2003 I met several spouses/relatives of cubers who had learnt the
        cube themselves. For example, Yasmara (Michiel van der Blonk's wife),
        Betty (Grant Tregay's wife), Elizabeth (Dan Knights' sister) and
        Wiktoria (Zbigniew's daughter). I was just curious how these cubing
        family members became interested in learning the cube. Is it that they
        wanted to find out what all the fuss was with their puzzle- obsessed
        relatives? :) Or maybe because they had such expert tutors and so
        thought they'd give it a go? :) I've certainly been offering to teach
        Peter (my fiance), but as he's still in the US (and I'm back in
        Australia) it hasn't quite happened yet. Although we did do a long
        distance solve once (he had the scrambled cube in the US, I was on the
        phone in Australia describing algs over the phone). That was fun. :)

        seems like everything is thought up :( lol. after some thought i've
        decided on learning it anyway as follows: step 1.)typical fridrichs f2l
        *except for last c/e slot step 2.)2x2x1 block bottom layer *as long as
        you don't break this up, doesn't matter how you go about doing your
        business. step 3.) insert last f2l pair *can't break up the block! step
        4.)orient/permute all I was thinking how long it will take for each
        step. i figured: step 1: 8.0-9.0 seconds step 2: 2.5-3.0 seconds step 3:
        2.5-3.0 seconds step 4: 3.0-3.5 seconds total: 16.0-18.5 seconds i think
        these are at least semi realistic estimates So while the idea was
        brought up already, my approach seems to be a bit different. And another
        difference is, I'll actually be following through with it...I had some
        confusion about the math for it, but after all it is 107 LL algs to
        learn. The last c/e pair is also to be a pain...most likely involving a
        slew of algs...I'll be doing my best to organize this solution for
        anyone who is interested. Since I'm going to 'publish' this method on my
        site I think it deserves an appropriate name...suggestions anyone? i'll
        decide when i'm finished whether it was practical or not. ;) -Richard

        Hey, i just wonder how u guys "make" algs. I know that it is easy to use
        Cube Explorer to find short optimal algorithms once u specify fully the
        initial state of the cube and the desired goal-state. But what if u want
        to ignore parts of the cube. Like when ur algs are not final step algs.
        Are there similar programs that will let u ignore parts of the cube? Of
        course one can search for those algs manually also, which is tedious and
        u will usually not find all the ones u are looking for. Similarly one
        can come up with algs that are faster to perform even though they don't
        have the minimum number of moves. Are there programs who can do this? It
        could for instance print out all the move-sequences as it finds them and
        then u select the most convenient urself. Or u can specify u want to
        limit urself to moving only a certain number of layers etc etc. Any info
        on this is useful insight!! Thank u guys (and girls)!! --Per K.--

        Hello! First, i'm a french student so excuse my bad English ; i just
        hope you'll understand me ! :) I've done several functions in CAML (it
        is a Fench programming language: see http://caml.inria.fr/ for English
        support) about the Rubik's Cube ; one of my aim was to know how
        positions where reached in n moves exactly (not in less). I call a move
        a single quarter turn of one of the 6 faces of the cube. My computer has
        got 512 MO of RAM and has a P4- 1,4GHz Pentium Processor. I obtained
        these results in 50 hours of CPU time: n pos(n) 0 1 1 12 2 114 3 1,068 4
        10,011 5 93,840 6 878,880 7 8,221,632 8 76,843,595 9 717,789,576 For
        n=10, with my method, it would take almost a month... I used a soft data
        compression process and several tips, but basically, my functions use
        the force of the computer (i don't use IA algorithms like IDA*). I made
        a program to generate isomorphic classes of a position (i call isomorph
        of a position a position that is symmetrical, inverse or the same but
        with an other orientation of the cube...). To do this, i used the
        principe of conjugaison in a group. I want to know how other people did
        to generate the positions isomorphic to another? (according to my
        definition, a position has got less or equal than 96 isomorphic
        positions, including itself!). Also, a random position (randomly choosen
        not with random moves, each position has the same probability to be
        chosen) has exactly 96 isomorphic positions (what is not surprising of
        course). I hope someone would be interested in this work ; if someone
        already did it, i would be really interested to contact him! Least,
        considering the positions who are there one isomorph position could help
        if we assume that there is only one antipode for the 3x3x3 Cube (there
        are only 8 of such positions, the identity, the superflip, the Pont
        Asinum and others). Of course, if the antipode is not single (what i
        believe), it won't help... Regards. Boris

        Just to show how stupid this whole virus thing is, this past week i
        recieved a virus myself from someone i know... MYSELF!!!! I have two
        yahoo accounts and i sometimes send emails from one account to another.
        But this one was strange. I never sent anything or recieved anything
        like that under my other account. I have also been checking my computer
        for viruses quite frequently over the big bout that exploaded a couple
        weeks ago. Don't worry guys, i dealt with the matter in a calm way, and
        i sent the person who "sent" me the virus an email saying "i got a virus
        and it was sent from you." jake I checked my other account and found the
        message and i replied, "I am sorry, I would never send you a virus.
        Theres a lot of weird stuff floatting around but i am sorry and i will
        scan my computer to see if there are any viruses present." jake So i had
        my computer screened or whatever, its clean... no dirty sickies
        lingering anywhere. So I checked my other email and after reading the
        reply i responded: "Don't worry Jake, It didn't do any harm to my
        computer because i scanned the email before i opened it. I always do
        that regardless who sent it to me, because sometimes an unintentional
        virus is sent somehow. Either way, good luck with cubing!" Jake I went
        and checked my other account and after reading the message i replied:
        "thanks for being a good sport about this mess, i am truly sorry, and i
        am glad that no harm came to you computer. " Jake See, maybe i am just
        insane sending messages back and forth to myself, but i dealt with the
        situation in the best way i could. Thats the only way to work out a
        problem. Blowing up at someone would not have settled anything,
        especially in this case... But anyway, there were no bugs in my computer
        anywhere. SO this means that someone is hacking in my "oh so dear" yahoo
        acount, or something else. I am not a techy poopy genius but i think its
        just dumb to blame someone 100% over something they cant control. Jake

        Also, after the 15 seconds, they covered the cube with their hands. That
        makes a lot of sense, but if you weren't prepared for it, it can be
        really disorienting. In the Budapest WC, they didn't cover the cubes, so
        you could keep scheming while it lay on the table. Not that I really

        This might extend to corners first and other methods too, but I guess it
        mainly applies to people who use an F2L approach. Tonight I had an
        amazing night on the cube and I just wanted to share some insight in
        case it would help others. I'm sure all of you consistent sub-20ers do
        this even when you're sleep deprived with both hands behind your back
        and underwater, but I just recently discovered the value of this and
        wanted to try to let others know. Anyway, tonight I took 3 averages on
        the cube. Two of which were sub-20, which I haven't pulled off in a
        while, and the other was only a couple hundredths of a second away. I
        did this by concentrating really hard on doing moves that only used RUL
        turns. I mean I REALLY concentrated hard on only trying to do RUL (or d
        or d') turns ONLY during the F2L. When I "got into the zone" of thinking
        this way, I found myself solving what felt to me to be extremely slowly,
        and I was concentrating so hard on only turning those three faces that I
        almost forgot that I was trying to speed solve and the usual nervousness
        from trying to "go fast yet slow yet not rotate the cube yet find good
        c/e pairs" etc. went away. I found myself getting lots of times that I
        normally only get two or three times a day. So anyway for those like me
        who are slow to pick up on the tricks of getting fast, I can't stress
        enough how important it is to try to really, really only do RUL (or d or
        d') turns when solving the F2L. Also try to only rotate the cube
        whenever you have to do lots of B or F turns, and rotate the cube so the
        B face becomes the L or R face, then continue doing the alg. Rotate only
        to place the B or F face on R or L when you have several B or F turns
        coming up. I know you fast people already do this, but I just discovered
        the value of it and I want to try to emphasize to everyone that it
        really works. My two cents. Sorry for the preaching but I hope it helps,

        Two looks and a 3 cycle: I'm formalising my strategy for the last layer
        (assuming an F2L that does not direct the structure of the LL in any
        way). I think of it as a two-and-a-half looks method but that's a damn
        lie really ¬ñ its 3 looks but the last is always a simple 3-cycle of
        edges. I'd be interested if anyone else uses a similar approach although
        I know that there are not many people who solve the LL doing corners
        then edges. Before I summarise it below you might well ask "why?". After
        all its 3 looks not 2 and it averages between 25 and 30 moves (I
        understand others do more like 22). The main advantages are: 1. There
        aren't many algorithms to learn (pessimistically up to 30 although I
        think its more like 20 or less) 2. Many of the algorithms are what I
        would call "intuitive" ¬ñ 3- cycles and 2-pair swaps using conjugation. At
        least they seem intuitive to me but then they are all "hand-made" ¬ñ that
        is invented by me using common sense principles. Of course this means
        that there may be more efficient algorithms to do it using the same
        strategy. 3. I don't think the "looks" are very hard to "see"! Of course
        the last look is pretty trivial. 4. Its an interesting hybrid ¬ñ I suspect
        that it might be an easier stepping stone to the 2-look for some people.
        General 2 and 3 LL Strategy: 1. Orient corners ensuring that at least
        one edge is unflipped. (Up to 12 algorithms here probably a lot less).
        2. Position corners and position one unflipped edge. (Maybe 4 or 5
        algorithms). 3. Finish with a 3-cycle of edges. (3 algorithms). The
        eagle-eyed will spot some possibilities that don't fit. Q1. What if
        corners are already oriented and all edges are flipped? A1. Position
        corners; finish with 2 3-cycles of edges. (still 2 looks and a 3-cycle).
        Q2. If the corners are properly positioned then you can't arrange to
        finish Q1 with 2 3-cycles if the edges are flipped but properly
        positioned can you? A2. One extra algorithm for flipping all 4 edges in
        their proper positions (my best algorithm for this is 22 moves!). I
        haven't done a proper mathematical count of the number of algorithms
        required and I haven't systematically worked out the average or range of
        numbers of moves required to solve but I think 30 algorithms and 30
        moves are both very, very pessimistic. I do intend to work it all out
        properly for my own peace of mind eventually but if I've reinvented the
        wheel and anyone else already knows all this do let me know! Duncan

        help others. I'm sure all of you &gt; consistent sub-20ers do this even
        when you're sleep deprived with &gt; both hands behind your back and
        underwater, but I just recently &gt; discovered the value of this and
        wanted to try to let others know. &gt; Anyway, tonight I took 3 averages
        on the cube. Two of which were &gt; sub-20, which I haven't pulled off
        in a while, and the other was &gt; only a couple hundredths of a second
        away. I did this by &gt; concentrating really hard on doing moves that
        only used RUL turns. &gt; I mean I REALLY concentrated hard on only
        trying to do RUL (or d or &gt; d') turns ONLY during the F2L. When I
        "got into the zone" of &gt; thinking this way, I found myself solving
        what felt to me to be &gt; extremely slowly, and I was concentrating so
        hard on only turning &gt; those three faces that I almost forgot that I
        was trying to speed &gt; solve and the usual nervousness from trying to
        "go fast yet slow yet &gt; not rotate the cube yet find good c/e pairs"
        etc. went away. I &gt; found myself getting lots of times that I
        normally only get two or &gt; three times a day. So anyway for those
        like me who are slow to pick &gt; up on the tricks of getting fast, I
        can't stress enough how &gt; important it is to try to really, really
        only do RUL (or d or d') &gt; turns when solving the F2L. Also try to
        only rotate the cube &gt; whenever you have to do lots of B or F turns,
        and rotate the cube so &gt; the B face becomes the L or R face, then
        continue doing the alg. &gt; Rotate only to place the B or F face on R
        or L when you have several &gt; B or F turns coming up. I know you fast
        people already do this, but &gt; I just discovered the value of it and I
        want to try to emphasize to &gt; everyone that it really works. &gt;
        &gt; My two cents. Sorry for the preaching but I hope it helps, &gt;

        Hi After a year of almost constant cubing and after giving up trying to
        get her interested in the cube, she suddenly said: 'OK, teach me now'.
        An important aspect of this was that I told her that anyone could do it,
        and that she needed to learn just a couple of alg's and it would
        probably take 3 to 4 days and a little practice to be able to do it
        without the alg's on hand. Of course real speedcubing takes a lot more
        dedication, and up to now that is a far fetched dream. She stopped
        practicing after reaching the 1.30 barrier, and she might take it up
        when there is a new championship. I myself am at a best average of about
        23 seconds, and I have to say it gets harder and harder to beat seconds.
        Ans Jasmine, how about both getting a webcam? That would make things a
        lot easier! Ans you get to see each other once in a while. bye Michiel

        First, a bit of background about myself. I've been a casual cuber since
        the early 80's. My method of solving the cube was learned from a book,
        and is quite basic: - Solve the top layer (~25 moves) - Use a simple
        algorithm to get all middle layer cubes in place (~25 moves) For the
        last layer, I flip the cube. Then I - Permute the edges - Permute the
        corners - Orient the corners - Orient the edges. I use 5 algorithms (not
        including inverses which I sometimes use). It takes me about 50 moves to
        solve the last layer, and the total solve time is around 110 secs. I
        would like to learn a new method to slash my solve times at least in
        half. I have had a look at a few web sites mentioned in this group
        (speedcubing.com for example), and find the methods, terminology, and
        number of algorithms intimidating. Most posts on this group are way
        above my head. I don't believe I could handily retain huge numbers of
        algorithms. I guess I would like a method which gives the best "bang for
        the buck" and minimizes the number of algorithms. Can someone recommend
        a web site with more of a tutorial approach which will suit my needs?

        Hey Scott, the method I recommend is possible to get to about 55 seconds
        average with a lot of work. If you really work hard you can get sub-50,
        but it would probably be more efficient to learn a faster method if you
        want times around sub-50. There are more advanced versions of this
        method, which several people on this group use, so you wouldn't be
        without help from others to find ways to improve. The method is Mark
        Jeay's 2nd solution at http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm#sol2 In terms of
        "bang for the buck" this method is great since it is overall very
        intuitive. There are 3 algorithms you have to learn to finish the first
        two layers, and an algorithm and its inverse to learn to rotate the
        corners. Since you already rotate corners you won't have to learn that,
        so the count is 3 algorithms. With some careful thought over the
        algorithms they will make sense after several reptitions and eventually,
        after solving with this method for a while, they become intuitive as
        well. Anyway this method works as follows, 1) Solve cross on 1st face (I
        prefer bottom when using this method) 2) Solve 3 corners of 1st face 3)
        Use empty corner to place 3 edges of the first two layers (This is a
        simple sequence described on the website and is much faster than using
        an algorithm. This step is very intuitive.) 4) Orient and place the
        edges of the top layer and last middle edge (this step uses three
        algorithms to finish off the last two edges, though as mentioned earlier
        they can be understood with some practice and repetition.) 5) place all
        remaining corners (LL corners and the remaing unsolved one from the
        first layer). This step also uses a simple sequence described on the
        website and is very intuitive. 6) orient corners There are several
        people here who use a similar approach, though from what I hear I think
        Mark Jeays' version might be a little more rigid. I think most people
        have more advanced practice on step 4, and perhaps 5 also, but the
        method as described on Mark's site is very easy to learn. I taught a
        friend of mine this method and he averages around 1:10 to 1:00 with a
        personal best time of 49 seconds last I talked with him. I'm not sure if
        this is the time range you are looking for, as methods with a more
        traditional layer-by-layer approach can be slightly faster than this,
        however in terms of fewest number of algs learned for the time it will
        let you achieve I think this method is great. Hope this helps, Chris ---

        I gues not everybody knows me. I am currently the only one selling the

        Rubik's Studio was so kind to make them available for the speedcubing
        community via me. I gues I was selected because I already provided cubes
        to many of the top speedcubers. So I am realy proud that I actually do
        bussines with The Rubik's Studio directly! I actually have a signed
        invoice from MR Erno Rubik! About the current and future Rubiks.com, I
        also have contact with SevenTowns and I have seen the new prototype
        Rubik's.com. It has great stickers, it is more like a fused plastic

        Hi Actually, Scott, there is not a lot to learn. First, buy or make
        yourself a perfectly smooth turning cube. Very important is that you
        have to be able to 'cut corners'. This means, that when you make for
        instance an R turn for 90%, then perform U', the cube shouldn't 'block'
        the move. Some amazing cubes can even perform the second move when the
        first one is at 60-70%. You will see quite a gap arise as you turn and
        look inside your cube. This is not very healthy for your cube, and it
        will wear out one day. No pain, no gain, alas. Furthermore, your cube
        should be well-lubed, preferably by a silicon based spray. I used to use
        body lotion myself, and that worked too, but it is not very good for
        your cube, and the inside becomes a black greasy smudge. Have a look at
        Ton's page at speedcubing.com and read the manual. The fast speedcubers
        use these moves and call it a finger trick or trigger. Using this you
        can perform more than 1 move (2, 3 even 4) as if it is 1 move. An
        important aspect of these tricks is the grip. You should be comfortable
        performing your algs in the most natural grip. You can split up your own
        algs in your own preferred tricks. So, an 8 move alg could be converted
        in 4 tricks for example. So, you probably get the idea of what I am to
        suggest. Use these tricks and you are on your way. No algorithms needed.
        This should get you under one minute. After that, you can probably get
        to 40-45 seconds, and then it gets real hard to improve more. By that
        time, start learning alg's, there is no other way. Dan Knights has some
        explanation and video's of this
        http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/CubeInfo.html or look at
        http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/PetersCubePage.html Hope that helps

        this is so true, I started doing this right after the worlds when i saw
        some guys cubing and saying to myself "man theses guys know f2l from
        every possible angle" this would be a great time for people to share
        there f2l tips my tips are 1.learn the standard 41 f2l but understand
        how and why they work not just the sequeneces. this will also make it
        easier too remember and keep your f2l's down too using 2 faces R,U or
        F,U. 2.Learn too use your right and left handed and also learn the
        reverse and mirror of the f2l so you don't have too turn the cube as
        much. 4.Reconize the Patterns my the colors they make on top, that way
        when your doing a reverse sided f2l you don't have too always peak over
        the back side to figure what it is 3.Understand Non Standard F2L, learn
        all the f2L's where 2 pieces are in the wrong places,and other short
        cuts when thers an open layer because it will still take around 7- 8
        moves to insert sometimes even less. and will greatly decrease your
        Cross too f2l 4.if you have too insert a block thats on the reverse side
        you normally would turn the cube on the X turn it on the Y and and
        insert, this always you too get an overview of the cube and allow you
        too see your next move hmm anymore people? --- In

        turns when solving the F2L. Also try to only rotate the cube &gt;
        whenever you have to do lots of B or F turns, and rotate the cube so
        &gt; the B face becomes the L or R face, then continue doing the alg.
        &gt; Rotate only to place the B or F face on R or L when you have

        Hi, I think that what you say is totally wrong :-) You say "learn the
        standard 41 f2l but understand how and why they work not just the
        sequeneces. this will also make it easier too remember and keep your
        f2l's down too using 2 faces R,U or F,U. " I don't think it's enough to
        understand what the alg do. I never learn any "alg" for F2L. They came
        to me naturally.It's hard to explain. When you say "Reconize the
        Patterns ", for me, there is no patterns.I have 2 blocks, then I have to
        assemble it then insert.I don't recognize "patterns" like you say. I
        think speedcubists shouldn't learn F2L "alg" (I know that A.caman
        learned this and maybe others). I improved my times faster other cubists
        because I didn't learn this algs. (Yes A caman improved too really fast
        but this is an excetpion) Adam Gehin improved his times better because
        he didn't learn this F2L algs. SOrry for my really bad english, Happy

        Hi Chris, I use FRB and RFL the way you use LUR. And I use it for both

        I've been putting a lot of thought into this question. "How do I get
        faster?" I average around 26 seconds. This is with pretty much a
        standard fridrich's f2l, with the exception of a small handful of zb
        method algs i've learned. I also use a 3 look LL. I refuse to learn the
        OLL right now, seems like I could avoid this all together and still have
        a speedy LL. I've also been enthusiastic about a method I mentioned
        previously. One that isn't of my own mind, but I think I'm putting more
        thought into its 'potential'. In case anyone missed my description of
        it: *standard f2l, except leave an empty c/e slot* *create 2x2x1 block
        in LL* *insert last f2l pair without breaking up the block
        *orient/permute all, 1 step.* I think it has potential...sometimes. It's
        been mentioned a few times that the best method for being an extreme
        fast cuber would end up not being 1 method, but a clash of many. That's
        why I'm going to learn the 1-look for my recently mentioned method, and
        the 1-look for the zb method. This is obviously going to be a long term
        situation, but in the end I will have had a lot of fun I think. Not only
        that, I'd take pride in throughly exploring a method no one has b4. 107
        algs to learn total for my *again* recently mentioned method. I'm
        calling it the lucky 107 method...cuz its kind of catchy. I already know
        7 of them...so only 100 more! lol -Richard

        Well, you use about 100 moves to solve the cube. I would estimate that
        with that method you can get down to under a minute, but you need to get
        a really well lubed cube. But if you're looking for instant results (Do
        I sound like a commercial?), you need to learn a new method. If you
        first solve the entire first layer then you can't do anything else
        without first taking apart the first layer. You take it apart, do
        something, and put it back together. And that's very inefficient. And
        don't let the numbers of algorithms intimidate you. It's a lot easier
        than it seems to remember 40+. It seems like your brain doesn't remember
        them, but your hands do. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        about myself. &gt; &gt; I've been a casual cuber since the early 80's.
        My method of solving the cube was learned from a book, and is quite
        basic: &gt; &gt; - Solve the top layer (~25 moves) &gt; &gt; - Use a
        simple algorithm to get all middle layer cubes in place (~25 moves) &gt;
        &gt; For the last layer, I flip the cube. Then I &gt; &gt; - Permute the
        edges &gt; &gt; - Permute the corners &gt; &gt; - Orient the corners
        &gt; &gt; - Orient the edges. &gt; &gt; I use 5 algorithms (not
        including inverses which I sometimes use). It takes me about 50 moves to
        solve the last layer, and the total solve time is around 110 secs. &gt;
        &gt; I would like to learn a new method to slash my solve times at least
        in half. I have had a look at a few web sites mentioned in this group
        (speedcubing.com for example), and find the methods, terminology, and
        number of algorithms intimidating. Most posts on this group are way
        above my head. &gt; &gt; I don't believe I could handily retain huge
        numbers of algorithms. I guess I would like a method which gives the
        best "bang for the buck" and minimizes the number of algorithms. &gt;
        &gt; Can someone recommend a web site with more of a tutorial approach
        which will suit my needs? &gt; &gt; Thanks for reading. &gt; &gt; Scott

        I use about 100 moves and I average under a minute, my cube isn't that

        something, and &gt; put it back together. And that's very inefficient.

        quite basic: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Solve the top layer (~25 moves) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; - Use a simple algorithm to get all middle layer cubes in
        place &gt; (~25 moves) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the last layer, I flip
        the cube. Then I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Permute the edges &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; - Permute the corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Orient the corners &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; - Orient the edges. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I use 5
        algorithms (not including inverses which I sometimes &gt; use). It takes
        me about 50 moves to solve the last layer, and the &gt; total solve time
        is around 110 secs. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to learn a new
        method to slash my solve times at &gt; least in half. I have had a look
        at a few web sites mentioned in &gt; this group (speedcubing.com for
        example), and find the methods, &gt; terminology, and number of
        algorithms intimidating. Most posts on &gt; this group are way above my
        head. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe I could handily retain huge
        numbers of &gt; algorithms. I guess I would like a method which gives
        the &gt; best "bang for the buck" and minimizes the number of
        algorithms. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone recommend a web site with
        more of a tutorial approach &gt; which will suit my needs? &gt; &gt;

        well everyone learns in there own way to me the standerd 41 f2l is just
        a template it shows people how and why things work. when you understand
        the WHy you have Power. I never personally learned them all theres was
        no need at a certain point. but at no cost should you sit there and
        drill the same sequence over and over but too get low times your mind
        eventually memorizes it..a better word would be Automizes the
        situations. so we feel like theres no thought because we've done all the
        thinking already I've been doing this 7months and my average is 20s and
        theses are the things that helped me. only real problem i'm having is
        psychological. I have a habit of looking at the clock when i'm done my
        f2l, and when it says like 9 or 10s i tend too go too fast, lock up and
        get cube jams making me screw up which is anoying --- In

        2003 21:20:45 -0000 &gt; this is so true, I started doing this right
        after the worlds when i &gt; saw some guys cubing and saying to myself
        "man theses guys know f2l &gt; from every possible angle" &gt; this
        would be a great time for people to share there f2l tips &gt; my tips
        are &gt; 1.learn the standard 41 f2l but understand how and why they
        work not &gt; just the sequeneces. this will also make it easier too
        remember &gt; and keep your f2l's down too using 2 faces R,U or F,U.
        &gt; 2.Learn too use your right and left handed and also learn the &gt;
        reverse and mirror of the f2l so you don't have too turn the cube as
        &gt; much. &gt; 4.Reconize the Patterns my the colors they make on top,
        that way &gt; when your doing a reverse sided f2l you don't have too
        always peak &gt; over the back side to figure what it is &gt;
        3.Understand Non Standard F2L, learn all the f2L's where 2 pieces &gt;
        are in the wrong places,and other short cuts when thers an open &gt;
        layer because it will still take around 7- 8 moves to insert &gt;
        sometimes even less. and will greatly decrease your Cross too f2l &gt;
        4.if you have too insert a block thats on the reverse side you &gt;
        normally would turn the cube on the X turn it on the Y and and &gt;
        insert, this always you too get an overview of the cube and allow &gt;
        you too see your next move &gt; hmm anymore people? &gt; --- In

        &gt;This might extend to corners first and other methods too, but I
        guess it &gt; &gt;mainly applies to people who use an F2L approach. &gt;
        Tonight &gt; &gt;I had an amazing night on the cube and I just wanted to
        share some insight &gt; &gt;in case it would help others. I'm sure all
        of you consistent sub- 20ers do &gt; &gt;this even when you're sleep
        deprived with both hands behind your back and &gt; &gt;underwater, but I
        just recently discovered the value of this and wanted to &gt; &gt;try to
        let others &gt; know. &gt; &gt;Anyway, tonight I took 3 averages on the
        cube. Two of which were sub-20, &gt; &gt;which I haven't pulled off in a
        while, and the other was only a couple &gt; &gt;hundredths of a second
        away. I did this by concentrating really hard on &gt; &gt;doing moves
        that only used RUL &gt; turns. &gt; &gt;I mean I REALLY concentrated
        hard on only trying to do RUL (or d &gt; or &gt; &gt;d') turns ONLY
        during the F2L. When I "got into the zone" of thinking this &gt;
        &gt;way, I found myself solving what felt to me to be extremely slowly,
        and I &gt; &gt;was concentrating so hard on only turning those three
        faces that I almost &gt; &gt;forgot that I was trying to speed solve and
        the usual nervousness from &gt; &gt;trying to "go fast yet slow &gt; yet
        &gt; &gt;not rotate the cube yet find good c/e pairs" etc. went away. I
        found myself &gt; &gt;getting lots of times that I normally only get two
        or three times a day. So &gt; &gt;anyway for those like me who are slow
        to &gt; pick &gt; &gt;up on the tricks of getting fast, I can't stress
        enough how important it is &gt; &gt;to try to really, really only do RUL
        (or d or d') turns when solving the &gt; &gt;F2L. Also try to only
        rotate the cube whenever you have to do lots of B or &gt; &gt;F turns,
        and rotate the cube &gt; so &gt; &gt;the B face becomes the L or R face,
        then continue doing the alg. Rotate &gt; &gt;only to place the B or F
        face on R or L when you have &gt; several &gt; &gt;B or F turns coming
        up. I know you fast people already do this, &gt; but &gt; &gt;I just
        discovered the value of it and I want to try to emphasize &gt; to &gt;
        &gt;everyone that it really works. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;My two cents.
        Sorry for the preaching but I hope it helps, Chris &gt; &gt;

        If you don't feel like memorizing a ton of algorithms, then I think the
        best one is the Petrus method(lar5.com/cube). At the last layer, all of
        the edges are already correctly oriented, so you only need to memorize
        about 30 for a two look last layer. And only about 15 for a two look.
        But if you've decided to memorize a few more, then you could learn
        either the Fridrich Method or the corners first. Both of those are very
        fast. A website about corners first will be going up soon, hopefully....

        Nah, no REAL point in changing. This works fine. I just like forum
        environments better. Plus if we used a forum, thene there could be a
        board for 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, one handed, different methods, etc. It
        would be more organized, I guess is what I'm saying. --- In

        Hey Scott I would recommend learning the F2L for the first 2 layers,

        layer method for the last layer.
        http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Intermediate.html you could
        also use the keyhole method for the first 2 layers. i cant find a link

        will give you 65+ avg moves i think, and about 8 algs to learn. i've
        averaged around 40 sec with a cross, bottom edges, middle edges, 4 look
        LL system, and i'm not a fast cuber, so i think sub 30 sec avg with this
        system is possible. with a F2L or key-hole method for the first 2
        layers, you can easily cut a few more seconds, and then it's a question
        if you are willing to learn more algs to make it a 3 look LL, or even a
        2 look LL. LL = last layer. Terje Kristensen -----Original Message-----

        &gt; I average around 26 seconds. This is with pretty much a standard
        &gt; fridrich's f2l, with the exception of a small handful of zb method
        &gt; algs i've learned. I also use a 3 look LL. I refuse to learn the
        &gt; OLL right now, seems like I could avoid this all together and still
        &gt; have a speedy LL. I agree! Learning OLL vs Oedges + Ocorners can
        only gain you 1s average - maybe 1.5s. When you think that there are
        (for me at any rate) 4 seconds to be won just on reducing the time
        cross+find first pair (It should be done in 2s - it takes me 6-7s) &gt;
        I've also been enthusiastic about a method I mentioned previously. &gt;
        One that isn't of my own mind, but I think I'm putting more thought &gt;
        into its 'potential'. In case anyone missed my description of it: &gt;
        *standard f2l, except leave an empty c/e slot* &gt; *create 2x2x1 block
        in LL* &gt; *insert last f2l pair without breaking up the block &gt;
        *orient/permute all, 1 step.* &gt; I think it has potential...sometimes.
        I do *leave empty corner slot *orient edges *fill slot *orient corners
        *permute all I sometimes run into a 2x1x1 block. Although with your
        method, you do have 3 "slots" you could potentially fill, two of them
        involve convoluted "calculations" for working out the orientations of
        remaining pieces (especially if you are a quarter turn out...) And
        working on one slot generates very long solutions if you don't want to
        break up the 2x2x1. (I just tried with ron's cube solver: the 2x1x1
        block was solved in 6 moves - but it would have taken me ages to do it
        intuitively. I aranged it so I could fill any of three possible slots
        and there were no solutions of fewer than 9 moves) After that, the great
        thing about your method is the easy recognition: there are two sets of
        positions: those with edges flipped and those with edges orientated
        there are three orientations for the first corner and three for the
        second. Then there are three positions for the first corner, two for the
        second. I would prefer a final solution-set which has fewer orientations
        and more permutations, for even better recognition. I think a different
        two step solution starting from the 2x1x1 block could be more promising:
        something like orient all, then permute all... Or even all in one go.
        edge orientations: 4 corner orientations: 27 (ouch) corner permutations:
        24 edge permutations: 3 I'm not quite sure how I would define
        orientation though... oh well... back to the drawing board

        &gt; I would recommend learning the F2L for the first 2 layers, &gt;
        http://www.speedcubing.com/algorithms.html I started learning them
        yesterday (well, actually Peter's versions) and noticed that I could
        first learn a few. What I've been doing so far is cross, then corners,
        then middle layer edges. But I inserted the first layer corners
        correctly, which was a pain if the white sticker was on the yellow face
        (took me 5 moves to insert it). Now I insert the corners in any
        orientation. Actually I insert them with wrong orientation on purpose!
        Not only because it allows me to learn and practice a few new algorithms
        but because most of the time they're faster than with a correctly
        oriented corner. So, after placing the corners you need one of the first
        11 algorithms displayed here:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l_crossbottom.html They're short, you
        probably know two of them already and without mirroring there are ever
        fewer. Almost always I get to a15, a15x, a22 or a22x which are all very
        easy and fast. Stefan

        There is the link. He claims these are the best cubes for speed &gt;
        &gt; &gt; cubing. Did you notice these being good cubes, anyone who
        bought &gt; &gt; &gt; them? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you
        think are the best cubes in your experience? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Also the site mentions the newest cubes from rubiks.com having &gt;
        &gt; vinel &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers, does that mean they hold up better

        It is possible to get down to 30 secs with a minimum of algs. I have
        best average of 28 and i never memorised heaps of algs. First layer is
        intuitive. When i preinspect the cube i focus on how to solve first
        layer corners. Then when i start that usually the edges "fall naturally"
        i solve them as i spot them. The middle layer edges only require a few
        algs. 2 for normal solving of one edge (2 didd orientations) and a few
        that will solve 2 edges in one go (3-cycles !!!) or solve one and remove
        one "bad" edge from the middle layer. This requires some practice to
        master but very few algs. The last layer i solve by 4 looks. Position
        corners (2 algs). Then orient them (3 algs). For the edges i usually
        orient them first unless i spot only a 3-cycle is required. (3-cycles
        have to become "second nature" if u want to be fast w my method.) To
        orient the edges it takes only 2 algs if 2 are wrongly oriented. If all
        are wrongly oriented it's either a 4-flip (1 alg to learn) or u apply 2
        3- cycles. After orienting edges when 2 of them were out of orientation
        there is either a 3-cycle(1 alg) or 2 2-cycles (2 algs). All this
        doesn't add up many algs except some 3-cycles that u won't have to
        memorise when u know how they work ;-) Most of them are commutators in
        group theoretical terms :-) Happy cubing !! (hmm ... u probably get too

        &gt; &gt; There is the link. He claims these are the best cubes for &gt;
        speed &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing. Did you notice these being good cubes,

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think are the best cubes in your
        experience? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also the site
        mentions the newest cubes from rubiks.com having &gt; &gt; &gt; vinel
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers, does that mean they hold up better like
        the 80's &gt; cubes &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from Ideal do? &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hmm ... i have never tried to work out an average. My times vary a lot.
        From 20 up to 36 secs. I guess about 1/4th to 1/3rd of the time is spent
        on the first layer. About 1/3rd on the middle layer. And the rest on the
        last layer. 80-90 moves in total?? And i got the corner-twisting # of
        algs wrong, should be 5 (forgot the 2 cases of twisting 2 corners). So
        for this u must be able to perform about 3 moves/sec :-) Good luck! (If
        u want i can supply the algs, but they are easy to find many familiar
        places on the web, try www.speedcubing.com and it's links first) &gt;

        up to speed &gt; &gt; &gt; It is possible to get down to 30 secs with a
        minimum of algs. I have &gt; best average of 28 and i never memorised
        heaps of algs. &gt; &gt; First layer is intuitive. When i preinspect the
        cube i focus on how &gt; to solve first layer corners. Then when i start
        that usually the &gt; edges "fall naturally" i solve them as i spot
        them. &gt; &gt; The middle layer edges only require a few algs. 2 for
        normal solving &gt; of one edge (2 didd orientations) and a few that
        will solve 2 edges &gt; in one go (3-cycles !!!) or solve one and remove
        one "bad" edge from &gt; the middle layer. This requires some practice
        to master but very few &gt; algs. &gt; &gt; The last layer i solve by 4
        looks. Position corners (2 algs). Then &gt; orient them (3 algs). For
        the edges i usually orient them first &gt; unless i spot only a 3-cycle
        is required. (3-cycles have to &gt; become "second nature" if u want to
        be fast w my method.) To orient &gt; the edges it takes only 2 algs if 2
        are wrongly oriented. If all are &gt; wrongly oriented it's either a
        4-flip (1 alg to learn) or u apply 2 3- &gt; cycles. After orienting
        edges when 2 of them were out of orientation &gt; there is either a
        3-cycle(1 alg) or 2 2-cycles (2 algs). &gt; &gt; All this doesn't add up
        many algs except some 3-cycles that u won't &gt; have to memorise when u
        know how they work ;-) Most of them are &gt; commutators in group
        theoretical terms :-) &gt; &gt; Happy cubing !! &gt; &gt; (hmm ... u
        probably get too many advices, so u not sure where to &gt; start ... )

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, Scott, there is not a lot to learn. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; First, buy or make yourself a perfectly smooth turning cube.
        Very &gt; &gt; important is that you have to be able to 'cut corners'.
        This means, &gt; &gt; that when you make for instance an R turn for 90%,
        then perform U', &gt; &gt; the cube shouldn't 'block' the move. Some
        amazing cubes can even &gt; &gt; perform the second move when the first
        one is at 60-70%. You will &gt; see &gt; &gt; quite a gap arise as you
        turn and look inside your cube. This is &gt; not &gt; &gt; very healthy
        for your cube, and it will wear out one day. No pain, &gt; no &gt; &gt;
        gain, alas. Furthermore, your cube should be well-lubed, preferably &gt;
        &gt; by a silicon based spray. I used to use body lotion myself, and
        &gt; that &gt; &gt; worked too, but it is not very good for your cube,
        and the inside &gt; &gt; becomes a black greasy smudge. Have a look at
        Ton's page at &gt; &gt; speedcubing.com and read the manual. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; The fast speedcubers use these moves and call it a finger
        trick or &gt; &gt; trigger. Using this you can perform more than 1 move
        (2, 3 even 4) &gt; as &gt; &gt; if it is 1 move. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An
        important aspect of these tricks is the grip. You should be &gt; &gt;
        comfortable performing your algs in the most natural grip. You can &gt;
        &gt; split up your own algs in your own preferred tricks. So, an 8 move
        &gt; &gt; alg could be converted in 4 tricks for example. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So, you probably get the idea of what I am to suggest. Use these
        &gt; &gt; tricks and you are on your way. No algorithms needed. This
        should &gt; get &gt; &gt; you under one minute. After that, you can
        probably get to 40-45 &gt; &gt; seconds, and then it gets real hard to
        improve more. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By that time, start learning alg's,
        there is no other way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dan Knights has
        some explanation and video's of this &gt; &gt;

        about myself. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been a casual cuber
        since the early 80's. My method of &gt; &gt; solving the cube was
        learned from a book, and is quite basic: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -
        Solve the top layer (~25 moves) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Use a
        simple algorithm to get all middle layer cubes in place &gt; &gt; (~25
        moves) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the last layer, I flip the
        cube. Then I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Permute the edges &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Permute the corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        - Orient the corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Orient the edges.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I use 5 algorithms (not including inverses
        which I sometimes &gt; use). &gt; &gt; It takes me about 50 moves to
        solve the last layer, and the total &gt; &gt; solve time is around 110
        secs. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to learn a new method
        to slash my solve times at &gt; least &gt; &gt; in half. I have had a
        look at a few web sites mentioned in this &gt; &gt; group
        (speedcubing.com for example), and find the methods, &gt; &gt;
        terminology, and number of algorithms intimidating. Most posts on &gt;
        &gt; this group are way above my head. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        don't believe I could handily retain huge numbers of &gt; algorithms.
        &gt; &gt; I guess I would like a method which gives the best "bang for
        the &gt; &gt; buck" and minimizes the number of algorithms. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone recommend a web site with more of a
        tutorial approach &gt; &gt; which will suit my needs? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for reading. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scott

        algorithms for the F2L alone (codes a01x through b25x). Add to that the

        cubes for &gt; &gt; speed &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing. Did you
        notice these being good cubes, anyone who &gt; &gt; bought &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; them? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        What do you think are the best cubes in your experience? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also the site mentions the newest
        cubes from rubiks.com &gt; having &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vinel &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers, does that mean they hold up better like the
        80's &gt; &gt; cubes &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from Ideal do? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for answering all of my

        lot. From 20 up to 36 secs. I guess about 1/4th to 1/3rd of the time is
        spent on the first layer. About 1/3rd on the middle layer. And the rest
        on the last layer. 80-90 moves in total?? And i got the corner-twisting
        # of algs wrong, should be 5 (forgot the 2 cases of twisting 2 corners).
        So for this u must be able to perform about 3 moves/sec :-) Good luck!
        (If u want i can supply the algs, but they are easy to find many

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, Scott, there is not a lot to learn. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; First, buy or make yourself a perfectly smooth turning cube.
        Very &gt; &gt; important is that you have to be able to 'cut corners'.
        This means, &gt; &gt; that when you make for instance an R turn for 90%,
        then perform U', &gt; &gt; the cube shouldn't 'block' the move. Some
        amazing cubes can even &gt; &gt; perform the second move when the first
        one is at 60-70%. You will &gt; see &gt; &gt; quite a gap arise as you
        turn and look inside your cube. This is &gt; not &gt; &gt; very healthy
        for your cube, and it will wear out one day. No pain, &gt; no &gt; &gt;
        gain, alas. Furthermore, your cube should be well-lubed, preferably &gt;
        &gt; by a silicon based spray. I used to use body lotion myself, and
        &gt; that &gt; &gt; worked too, but it is not very good for your cube,
        and the inside &gt; &gt; becomes a black greasy smudge. Have a look at
        Ton's page at &gt; &gt; speedcubing.com and read the manual. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; The fast speedcubers use these moves and call it a finger
        trick or &gt; &gt; trigger. Using this you can perform more than 1 move
        (2, 3 even 4) &gt; as &gt; &gt; if it is 1 move. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An
        important aspect of these tricks is the grip. You should be &gt; &gt;
        comfortable performing your algs in the most natural grip. You can &gt;
        &gt; split up your own algs in your own preferred tricks. So, an 8 move
        &gt; &gt; alg could be converted in 4 tricks for example. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So, you probably get the idea of what I am to suggest. Use these
        &gt; &gt; tricks and you are on your way. No algorithms needed. This
        should &gt; get &gt; &gt; you under one minute. After that, you can
        probably get to 40-45 &gt; &gt; seconds, and then it gets real hard to
        improve more. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By that time, start learning alg's,
        there is no other way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dan Knights has
        some explanation and video's of this &gt; &gt;

        about myself. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been a casual cuber
        since the early 80's. My method of &gt; &gt; solving the cube was
        learned from a book, and is quite basic: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -
        Solve the top layer (~25 moves) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Use a
        simple algorithm to get all middle layer cubes in place &gt; &gt; (~25
        moves) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the last layer, I flip the
        cube. Then I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Permute the edges &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Permute the corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        - Orient the corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Orient the edges.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I use 5 algorithms (not including inverses
        which I sometimes &gt; use). &gt; &gt; It takes me about 50 moves to
        solve the last layer, and the total &gt; &gt; solve time is around 110
        secs. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to learn a new method
        to slash my solve times at &gt; least &gt; &gt; in half. I have had a
        look at a few web sites mentioned in this &gt; &gt; group
        (speedcubing.com for example), and find the methods, &gt; &gt;
        terminology, and number of algorithms intimidating. Most posts on &gt;
        &gt; this group are way above my head. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        don't believe I could handily retain huge numbers of &gt; algorithms.
        &gt; &gt; I guess I would like a method which gives the best "bang for
        the &gt; &gt; buck" and minimizes the number of algorithms. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone recommend a web site with more of a
        tutorial approach &gt; &gt; which will suit my needs? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for reading. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scott

        basically, you take a razor blade and force it into the center cap where
        it is glued on. do this on all 4 sides of the center cap, then start
        prying the center cap off with the razor blade. it should eventually pop
        off. sometimes you get a hard one and you destroy the center cap in
        trying to remove it. but i have spare cubes and just use a center cap
        off one of these sacraficial lambs if one breaks apart. to put the
        center cap back on, most people generally just re-glue it. or, i use a
        neodymium magnet solution that i posted a while back-- this makes so you
        can get to your screws without having to break super-glue each time.

        You can roughly say that the proportion in moves is similar to the
        proportion in time. So about 30 moves or a little less is needed for the
        first layer. Only with extensive tables can u really calculate a proper
        average ;-) Or do the counting (boring) while solving :-) &gt; --- In

        bit of background about myself. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I've been a casual cuber since the early 80's. My method of &gt; &gt;
        &gt; solving the cube was learned from a book, and is quite basic: &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Solve the top layer (~25 moves)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Use a simple algorithm to get
        all middle layer cubes in &gt; place &gt; &gt; &gt; (~25 moves) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the last layer, I flip the cube.
        Then I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Permute the edges &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Permute the corners &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Orient the corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; - Orient the edges. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I use 5 algorithms (not including inverses which I sometimes &gt;
        &gt; use). &gt; &gt; &gt; It takes me about 50 moves to solve the last
        layer, and the &gt; total &gt; &gt; &gt; solve time is around 110 secs.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to learn a new
        method to slash my solve times at &gt; &gt; least &gt; &gt; &gt; in
        half. I have had a look at a few web sites mentioned in &gt; this &gt;
        &gt; &gt; group (speedcubing.com for example), and find the methods,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; terminology, and number of algorithms intimidating. Most
        posts &gt; on &gt; &gt; &gt; this group are way above my head. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe I could handily retain
        huge numbers of &gt; &gt; algorithms. &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I would
        like a method which gives the best "bang for &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        buck" and minimizes the number of algorithms. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone recommend a web site with more of a tutorial
        &gt; approach &gt; &gt; &gt; which will suit my needs? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for reading. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        i use a 2.5 look LL. actually its a 2 3/4 look LL because 1/4 of the
        time i solve LL in 2 looks and the other 3/4 of the time its 3 look. i
        always permute all in one alg/look. the other 1 3/4 looks is for
        orienting. case 1: if there are no edges oriented at beginning of LL,
        then i use one of 8 algs (including reflections/inversions) to orient
        entire LL in one alg, then permute in one more alg for a total of 2 algs
        on the LL. this only happens 1/8 of the time (i.e. no edges oriented at
        start of LL). case 2: if all 4 edges are oriented at beginning of LL,
        then i use one of 7 algs (including reflections/inversions) to orient LL
        corners in one alg, then permute all in one more alg for a total of 2
        algs on the LL. this only happens 1/8 of the time (i.e. all edges
        oriented at start of LL). case 3: if 2 edges are oriented at beginneing
        of LL, then i use one of 2 algs to orient the remaining 2 edges. the
        cube then reduces back to case 2 and i proceed from there resulting in a
        total of 3 algs for the LL. this happens 3/4 times (i.e. 2 edges
        oriented at start of LL). this may sound confusing but it means i can
        orient the LL in one alg 1/4 of the time and in 2 algs 3/4 of the time.
        and, when it's a 2 alg orientation (2 edges oriented correctly at start
        of LL), both of the two algs are pretty quick and short (averaging 6
        moves and 8 moves respectively). with this system you only need to learn
        a total of 17 orientation algs (this 17 *includes* reflections and
        inversions) and you can then orient the LL in a weighted-average of
        about 13 moves. with the standard 2-look LL (1-look OLL) you have to
        learn 57 OLL algs and you can orient the LL in an average of about 9
        moves. if you compare this to my method, you're learning 40 additional
        algs to shave only 4 moves off your OLL.

        practically a standard three look if not for your *no edges flipped up*

        I've noticed two big things- hand dexterity and recognition. Both were
        much worse before I started cubing and they have increased dramatically
        over the last year. I have also noticed better memorization, although I

        you move it so fast?" is heard quite often. My fingers have become quite
        dexterous due to cubing. 2) Memorization - I have learned many different
        techniques of memorization from cubing, and I integrate different
        devices in each step. These techniques can be applied in other aspects
        of life. 3) Pattern recognition - I was always amazed at how quickly the
        fast cubers could see which algorithms to use, especially for the LL.
        Since I've started to learn them, I can see them a lot quicker now, and
        the idea isn't as farfetched. 4) Spatial thinking - Ask any cuber to
        move cubie X into position Y and they will be able to do it in a
        heartbeat. Being able to manipulate a 3D object to such a vast degree
        contributes so much to spatial thinking in other areas. 5) Thinking
        outside the box - I remember looking at a cube before being able to
        solve thinking, "Even if I get this whole side white, I'll mess it up if
        I try to get another side." I still remember the day I made the
        realization that they are 8 corner cubies, 12 edge cubies, and 6 center
        cubies rather than 54 individual stickers. It made a world of difference
        in my way of viewing the cube. 6) Individual style - Everyone does the
        cube differently, even if they know the same method. No one style is
        best for me except my own. Just a few things I've picked up from the
        cube. I'd like to hear what others have to say on this as well. -Chris

        enough for memorization. I can memorize numbers over a long period of

        I am honered, but Seventows has some ideas to make a new mechanisme for
        speedcubing, also the fact that the handmade prototype fused stickers
        turns very good when new. I conclude that a rubiks.com can be a good
        speedcube in the future, but this is only if they always make the
        tension of the pins the same. Maybe a DIY kit of the Rubik's com cube in
        all it parts might be a good idea for now, the only problem is how to
        insert the pins , you need a vice to insert the pins. Ton --- In

        Hey Scott I dont use any algs for the F2L. The F2L is just about finding
        the matching corner / edge pair and insert it, it's quite a straight
        forward job, and quite intuitive. Many like me dont use algs for the
        F2L, or use their own algs, including thomas templier that's on the top
        of the 3x3 avg leaderboard at the moment on speedcubing.com. The reason
        for the link was to show what i meant with the F2L. Terje Kristensen

        learn. Terje, Thanks for your reply. I'm a bit confused. From what I've
        read the last few days, F2L over at speedcubing.com shows fully 41
        algorithms for the F2L alone (codes a01x through b25x). Add to that the
        algs I would need to learn to improve on the LL, how do you come up with
        8 algs to learn? Maybe this is just a terminology problem I'm having.

        The Rubiks.com cube won't be very popular amongst most speedcubists

        Hey! I want white adjacent to yellow. I hope the opposite clors will be
        darker colors. So my preferred color scheme is bkue-white, green-yellow
        and red-orange, the colors of maximum contrast. Thn I can choose
        opposite faces to dislay dark/light colors, which looks more striking.
        White-yellow face is to blurred, anddoes not photograph well. Before you
        speedcubists clobber me to deah for beung 'different', may I offer a
        compromise? Sell cubes with no stickers, but put the stickers next t the
        cube in the package for the cuber to affix himself or herself. This way
        you can select your preferred color scheme and have a nice,

        I think this looks good too. Both my 2 and a 3 method and this seem to
        be good staging posts on the way to a full 2 look. I think its amazing
        how many algorithms you have to add to move from these up to the full 2
        look. To get from 2 and a 3-cycle to 2 looks its really possible to just
        add the new algorithms one at a time - each time to add a new one you
        can make use of it to shorten some of the cases. I'm sure this is true

        actually its a 2 3/4 look LL because 1/4 of &gt; the time i solve LL in
        2 looks and the other 3/4 of the time its 3 &gt; look. i always permute
        all in one alg/look. the other 1 3/4 looks &gt; is for orienting. &gt;
        &gt; case 1: if there are no edges oriented at beginning of LL, then i
        &gt; use one of 8 algs (including reflections/inversions) to orient &gt;
        entire LL in one alg, then permute in one more alg for a total of 2 &gt;
        algs on the LL. this only happens 1/8 of the time (i.e. no edges &gt;
        oriented at start of LL). &gt; &gt; case 2: if all 4 edges are oriented
        at beginning of LL, then i use &gt; one of 7 algs (including
        reflections/inversions) to orient LL &gt; corners in one alg, then
        permute all in one more alg for a total of &gt; 2 algs on the LL. this
        only happens 1/8 of the time (i.e. all edges &gt; oriented at start of
        LL). &gt; &gt; case 3: if 2 edges are oriented at beginneing of LL, then
        i use one &gt; of 2 algs to orient the remaining 2 edges. the cube then
        reduces &gt; back to case 2 and i proceed from there resulting in a
        total of 3 &gt; algs for the LL. this happens 3/4 times (i.e. 2 edges
        oriented at &gt; start of LL). &gt; &gt; this may sound confusing but it
        means i can orient the LL in one alg &gt; 1/4 of the time and in 2 algs
        3/4 of the time. and, when it's a 2 &gt; alg orientation (2 edges
        oriented correctly at start of LL), both of &gt; the two algs are pretty
        quick and short (averaging 6 moves and 8 &gt; moves respectively). &gt;
        &gt; with this system you only need to learn a total of 17 orientation
        &gt; algs (this 17 *includes* reflections and inversions) and you can
        &gt; then orient the LL in a weighted-average of about 13 moves. &gt;
        &gt; with the standard 2-look LL (1-look OLL) you have to learn 57 OLL
        &gt; algs and you can orient the LL in an average of about 9 moves. if
        &gt; you compare this to my method, you're learning 40 additional algs
        to &gt; shave only 4 moves off your OLL.

        results I didn't expect the first time I touched the cube. And now, some
        speedcubists would say that they use complex LL algorithms intuitively.
        On speedcubing.com, it's written: "You must understand the logic and
        reasoning behind every single turn you make during the solution". (
        ...whereas sometimes, intuitions are things you can't explain... ;-) )
        Take a simple Sune: R'U'RU'R'U2R. It's intuitively easy to see why it
        does not destroy the F2L (you bring DBR+BR to U, do a few things, and
        put them back to their place at the end). It's intuitively easy to know
        why edges orientation does not change too (moving only 2 sides). But the
        effect on corners orientation is a lot harder. I can see how it works,
        and why it works (analyzing the cube state, step by step), but I never
        would have found this algorithm when looking specificaly for a 3-corner
        flip sequence. I'm sure a lot of people consider this algorithm as
        intuitive, because it looks so simple. You were talking about writing
        down an algorithm found intuitively. I would say that if it's "really"
        intuitive, there's no need to write it down. You can reinvent it or a
        similar one at will. Gilles.

        Hi Per, As a vintage cubist I must disagree. The colors you use were on
        a minority of cubes. The old "Official" color scheme has one corner the
        primary colors, Red, Blue and Green clockwise, with Orange opposite Red,
        White opposite Blue and Yellow opposite Green. Most of the cubes in 1980
        were made this way. The Deluxe was made this way, the Rubik's
        Game/Challenge cube was made this way and the C*4 cube was made this
        way. David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Per Kristen

        Hmm ... maybe this depends on the country where u bought the cube(s). I
        recall from the heydays that here in Norway almost every cube from
        Ideal/Arxon had the color arrangement mentioned by me earlier. Other
        varieties of the cube(s) were quite rare here. So this is the colors i'm
        used to, and i would never buy a cube in any other "colorometry", at
        least not for speedcubing :-) I know for sure other colors would slow
        down my solving tremendously. I dun believe anyone can solve a cube
        equally fast regardless of the "colorometry". If they can i would say
        they have exceptional skills :-) Maybe we let the experts/collectors
        here comment on this... &gt; --- In

        Hi Ton, I wish Seven Towns would make a few specific changes: Why not
        offer the adjustable screws for a speedcube. That's what we all want,
        isn't it? Put a washer under the screw and you don't have the old
        problems of sticking and unscrewing. How about interchangeable tiles?
        That way they could market many different kinds of tiles. Regular,
        translucent, smooth or patterned; they could do seasonal motifs, etc.
        People wouldn't be stuck with one color scheme, and if the tiles are
        easier to get on and off that would please those who wish to adjust the
        screws. How about choices between some different strength springs? That
        might be asking a bit much. Green should be lighter than blue like on
        the deluxe. I can solve the Deluxe in half the light needed to solve the
        present-day cubes, either from Seven Town's of Rubik's studio, because
        the new cube have blue and green with the same contrast. Why not go back
        to that good plastic used in some of the 1980's cubes, and the
        Hungarian-made Rubik's studio cube, or the thicker, slicker plastic used
        in the Deluxe? David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        A couple years ago i struggled and bounced from cube to cube trying to
        find the best for speedcubing. I used a wonderful puzzler cube for the
        longest time and it was way to loose so that kind of started the search.
        I still think the Rubiks.com cubes are very good for speedcubing. They
        do require the most work to make a decent speedcube out of. Breaking in
        one of those takes a while but when it is all nice and smooth,
        ahhhhhhhhhh. The studio cubes are excellent for speedcubing as well, but
        they seem too soft or something. I dunno maybe i'm just to used to other
        cubes. I do like the idea of a DIY speedcube kit from rubiks.com, but
        half of the fun is breaking in the cube. No two speedcubes are the same!

        Last night I was doing an average. It was turning out to be a good
        average and I was thinkin I might be able to beat my personal best for a
        single solve. Right after i started thinking about it i got a 19.xx
        time, (PB is 18.65) which the 19 wasn't too surprising because i get
        them every once in awhile. Then just two solves later I get a time that
        beats my PB! only problem is, i missed the space bar so i had some extra

        the color scheme of the prototype was a mistake. And the color scheme of
        the orgnal 1980 version is country specific the USA Ideal are mostly
        White/Blue and the European version White/Yellow. Since 2000 is the

        Hey Everyone, I kinda took a break from cubing for a while.. Alot of
        important business to handle and I was also starting to develop an odd
        pain in one of my fingers. I only picked up the cube once in a while,
        when I signed on and would talk with fellow cubists. Yesterday, I had a
        serious urge to cube, so I did an average and got 18.94. I also took an
        average without preinspection, because my previous times were in the
        30's. I was kinda curious if you all take longer breaks from the cube
        and come back to find that you were faster, slower, or the same as you
        were the last time you were serious about it. I am also going to hold a
        Sunday contest this weekend, for all of you who are interested. Nothing
        too fancy, but you will be able to find a link for it on my website.
        Take care and keep cubing. Frank www.gsconline.tk

        While the subject of color schemes is up, I wanted to share my thoughts.
        Most people probably use the standard white opp yellow scheme (icluding
        me) but I think the contrasting white opp blue color scheme would be
        easier to cube with. Why? because with the standard color scheme (like
        Hana was saying), the opposite colors are a similar shade. This messes
        me up a lot during the F2L. I will mistake the blue-orange edge for the
        green-orange edge because blue and green are both dark colors. If the
        color scheme was the white opp blue one, recognition would be easier and
        faster becasue both dark colors would be on the same edge cubie. It
        would be eay to differentiate between the 2 becasue they are bordering
        each other and no two cubies would look similar. Does anyone agree wit
        me? or understand what I am saying? I would switch to this color scheme
        but I am already used to using the standard one. Thoughts? -barefoot

        Each of the opposite colors are very similar. It owuld probably be
        easier to cube with the white opposite blue cube, but once you get used
        to one color scheme it's hard to switch. There was one person at the WC
        that had a weeiird cube, with orange opposite blue. Even on the two most

        Hi all, Just another problem; You are solving the cube in front of a lot
        of spectators (knowing nothing about records) and you want of course to
        make a maximum impression. If you now solve the cube in one second or
        so, you are met as an illusionist or bluffer but not as a cube-solver.
        If you solve it in an hour or more, you¬¥ll make very little impression.
        So evidently, an optimum does exist. Where is it?? R

        I gues this subject is realy personal preferece With the same arguments
        I think white opposite yellow contracst great to all colors. Altough I
        agree on the orange, this is why I prefer the bright orange on the
        orginal 1980 and the new Rubik's Studio cubes. But you can indead
        improve the contrast, know Katsuyuki Konishi has his special color
        scheme, because he has problems seeing colors. So I gues he is the
        expert on the right contrast needed for optimal speedcube recognition

        Hi all, I guess that's more a personal preference. I am used to cube
        with a weird color scheme; I use black opposite red, a very bright
        yellow opposite purple and light blue opposite orange (at the time
        that's more between brown and orange). For me that's the best scheme,
        because I start with black, then it doesn't matter for the F2L, but the
        good thing is that my last layer is very very easy to recognize, as red
        is really flashy compared to light blue or orange, and that gives you a
        very easy way to see what orientation you need to do. Yes, I can hear
        you shouting that's not possible to have such a weird cube, but I guess
        the more flashy, the more easy it is... But I agree with whoever told it
        before, once you're used to a color scheme, that's the best for you...

        F. &gt; You're right, choose the colors your prefer. Instant color
        discrimination is very important, and a black side does a great job. I
        just hope there's not going to be an official color scheme in
        competitions, especially because Rubik's shop still can't sell good
        stickers. Yellow looks dark with black plastic under, and orange and
        brown are nearly identical. Pathetic :-) I finally decided to use
        "standard colors"), but: - flashy yellow, orange and green - dark blue
        and red (same brightness, very different chrominance) Gilles.

        The way you see things, I think the optimum should be in the low 30es,
        but I also think it's fine if you solve a cube everybody scrambled
        before in less than 20 seconds, so nobody can say you're cheating,
        that's what I use to do... Except when one of my classmates always
        switches a few pieces, so that I can't solve the cube without taking it
        apart, so he can say :'hey, you're cheating, I can do it too...' Another
        thing is when you do it in let's say 60 or 90 seconds, and when you seem
        to think about each move you do, everybody says, "he is a genius, he
        understands each move...". That works pretty much too... It depends of
        who is in front of you: if someone says, you have just read some books,
        and you have learned solving it that way, so I think you should do it as
        fast as you can, but if people seem very intersted in it, so you better
        just solve it as if there was a huge mathematical stuff behind each alg
        - there is, but I guess you don't think about it, do you?- and explain
        them about the phenomenal number of combinations, God's algorithm, etc.

        have your color scheme on a cube and I pull it out and practice on it
        occasionally. It takes a few minutes to get used to it enough, but it is
        probably a little slower. As for just picking up an altogether different
        color scheme cube I probably take two or three times as long as usual.

        was a while ago. The last time I got on a bus with the cube and someone
        asked me "How fast can you solve it?" I said a minute. So I went slowly
        at first. First solve 52 seconds, Second solve 46 seconds, Third solve
        38 seconds, Fourth solve 32 seconds, Fifth solve 26 seconds. Each time
        was a little better than the last, and it went over well. In general if

        Most people realize that solving it really fast is not a trick,
        especially when they mix it up themselves. People seem to be more amazed
        at the speed I can turn it rather than the time so it might be more
        effective to use a less optimal solution with more moves and go really
        fast. Also, many people from my generation haven't really played with
        the cube much and might not even know what it is and how complex it is.
        I've had many people say "I've played with one of those for a half hour
        and still couldn't solve it!" and could care less that I could solve it.
        People around 30 seem to be the most amazed. Another comment that I get
        constantly: "Can you solve it from any position?" --barefoot Chris &gt;

        Little Survey Just curious about a few things... 1. What kind of cube do
        you use? I use the older studio cube from Ton. It has lasted me over 9
        months. 2. What method do you use? I use a combination at this point. I
        know several F2L algs, and use intuition for the rest of the F2L. I use
        a 4-5 look LL system at this point, and I have just begun learning the
        OLL/PLL alg set. 3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it
        on the bottom left top or other? I always have it on top. 4. How many
        algs do you know/use? I probably know about 20-25 at this point. 5. Are
        you still learning algs? Yes, the OLL/PLL set. 6. Whats your best avg?
        My best average is about 52 seconds, with a personal best of 39.9.

        1. What kind of cube do you use? I used an older studio cube from Ton at
        the WC, and I have some more of the newer variety coming in. In the
        meantime I'm using one I bought from Wal-mart 2. What method do you use?
        Fridrich. For fun I also came up with a simple corners first method and
        average under a minute with that so far. I kind of like playing around
        with corners first and might try to improve this method a little for
        fun. For serious speedcubing I use Fridrich though. 3. If you start out
        with a cross do you start with it on the bottom left top or other?
        Bottom 4. How many algs do you know/use? The 53 used in the Fridrich
        method, plus around 10-15 extra (I use two algs for some cases depending
        on which angle its at). And now I have about 15-16 ZB algs down (though
        they come up rarely) so about 80-90 I'm guessing? .... 5. Are you still
        learning algs? Yes, ZB method. 6. What's your best avg? 18.87 seconds
        ****and if I may be so bold as to add a question, 7. What's one of your
        most memorable cube moments? For me this would be the first time I
        showed the cube to one of my friends from High School. I started cubing
        the summer before 8th grade, and cubed absolutely like a maniac (i.e.
        daily basis) those first two years of high school. Well I never really
        brought it to school since it was just a hobby I had, and just something
        I enjoyed that I did after school. Well one day, like three years after
        I started, I was hanging out with my friend Amanda and somehow the cube
        came up in conversation, and I remember I mentioned that I could solve
        it. Well she had known me for three years but never knew I could do
        this. So I pulled out a cube (I eventually started keeping one handy)
        and she scrambled it and then I solved it in front of her. She totally
        freaked out! I mean she absolutely couldn't believe it. She then
        proceeded to scramble it several more times, totally not believing that
        I solved it each time. After that she always poked fun at me for being a
        crazy cube nerd :) Though it was alright, being good friends and all :)

        Yes, I think the maximum impact is a product of impact/unit of time
        (iut) and time. Or better; the integral of iut over time. For the iut is
        by no means constant. It starts with a max value and then falls
        (continuosly?) and will eventually go under zero, (when the public is
        starting getting bored). So if you hypothetically can solve the cube in
        seven seconds, you shall go on with this speed and solve it exactly in
        that critical zero point. And it may very well be so, that this point
        lies far above one minute! Metaphysics? R To:

        know what it is and how complex it is. I've had many people say "I've
        played with one of those for a half hour and still couldn't solve it!"

        &gt; Hi all, &gt; &gt; Just another problem; &gt; &gt; You are solving
        the cube in front of a lot of spectators (knowing &gt; &gt; nothing
        about records) and you want of course to make a maximum &gt; &gt;
        impression. If you now solve the cube in one second or so, you are &gt;
        &gt; met as an illusionist or bluffer but not as a cube-solver. If you
        &gt; &gt; solve it in an hour or more, you¬¥ll make very little
        impression. So &gt; &gt; evidently, an optimum does exist. &gt; &gt;
        Where is it?? &gt; &gt; I would guess that for maximal impact, it might
        be best if you can &gt; actually do more than one demonstration.
        Assuming you're thinking &gt; that your average is too fast to be
        believable, start out by solving &gt; slowly. Let's say you take &lt;30
        on average - solve it once in a &gt; minute or two - explain what you're
        doing as you go, perhaps even &gt; using more algs than you normally
        would (e.g. Break up the F2L pairs, &gt; and do a 4 look or more LL).
        Next, go through the same process, but &gt; don't explain it as you go,
        still taking your time. Then, speed up &gt; to full speed, still using
        that sub-optimal solution. Finally, show &gt; your true abilities (or
        the nervous approximation of it) by using &gt; your normal method at
        regular speed. This could show that it's not a &gt; trick, but a method
        - and when they see the final speed, it could be &gt; quite impressive.

        Hi, this is an interesting topic important to me. I am that "weirdo" at
        wc that had the non-standard color-scheme, i.e. blue opposite orange.
        Once you get used to one scheme it just "makes-sense" and is thus hard
        to have to re-adapt. And of course there are many that can actively use
        and instantly switch between two (or more) different color-scheme, which
        is ideal. In my opinion and from what I have read on this topic, the
        standard plus-yellow scheme is not so great for recognition nor for
        cube-art. Of course those using it probably don't think so, but that
        would be a somewhat biased opinion. I say use what-ever you prefer, and
        that competitions should not have any restrictions on this aspect.
        (Except the obvious one - precisely 6 distinct colors and 9 of each....
        Having an ALL white cube would seriously warrent immediate
        disqualification, LOL.) As for the "ideal" scheme, I think it is totally
        up to personal preferance. However, if anyone is using or planning on
        using the scheme seen on my site (my signature scheme) I would like to

        same edge cubie. It would be eay to &gt; differentiate between the 2

        maximum impact is a product of impact/unit of time (iut) and time. Or
        better; the integral of iut over time. For the iut is by no means
        constant. It starts with a max value and then falls (continuosly?) and
        will eventually go under zero, (when the public is starting getting
        bored). So if you hypothetically can solve the cube in seven seconds,
        you shall go on with this speed and solve it exactly in that critical
        zero point. And it may very well be so, that this point lies far above
        one minute! Metaphysics? R PS. And as a paradox; An other man solves the
        cube in an average of 40 secs and the public will faster get bored of
        him than of you. Hence, the faster you solve the cube, the longer you
        should go on! To: speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com Sent: Thursday,

        people realize that solving it really fast is not a trick, especially
        when they mix it up themselves. People seem to be more amazed at the
        speed I can turn it rather than the time so it might be more effective
        to use a less optimal solution with more moves and go really fast. Also,
        many people from my generation haven't really played with the cube much
        and might not even know what it is and how complex it is. I've had many
        people say "I've played with one of those for a half hour and still
        couldn't solve it!" and could care less that I could solve it. People
        around 30 seem to be the most amazed. Another comment that I get
        constantly: "Can you solve it from any position?" --barefoot Chris &gt;

        &gt;From the viewpoint of a cube artist, you are not weird at all. Any
        color scheme goes, provided it stays fixed throughout the design. You
        could also choose weird colors, say, pink-violet, blue-beige and
        gld-silver colors. I will, however, refuse to do a design, where the
        colors blur and cannot be easily distinguished. My eyesight is pretty
        bad and I need ro see wht I am doing. Next thing I need to decide is,
        which colors are on opposite faces and which are on adjacent faces.
        Opposite and adjacent colors are utually exclusive, meaning and opposite
        color on one cube cannot simultneously be an sdjacent color on another
        cube. This is pretty obvious herem, but to the outside world of those,
        who cannot solve 'that thing' it has to be spelled out. Hana a kostky

        Hi Fellow Cubers, First off, it's been a while... new members to the
        community and all, so I would like to take this opportunity to introduce
        myself for those who care... (ok lost cause, lol). My name is Doug; I am
        a college student, and self-proclaimed math-geek. 1. My main cubes are
        rubiks.com brand, off the shelf (those since then, I have ran into some
        poor quality ones, i.e. unbalenced spring tension on average too loose).
        2. I use my own method basically (created 4 years ago, still being
        perfected) except with the use of zero to one step of c/e pairing
        algorithms that are found everywhere but have now become inuitive.... I
        am also adapting the ZB-technique of c/e pairing and taking in various
        sets of algorithms that do some very specific, fairly advanced and
        obsure things. It is best categorized as a Lars-Varient but it has many
        forms due the steps being modular, that is the steps are not
        sequencially static. In it's extremes it essentially becomes either A)
        the nearly pure lars method with only partial early edge orientation or
        substituting the equivalent ZB stuff with steps 5+6 condensed into one,
        B) Gilles new method (no offence, partly my opinion, partly since my
        method is bit secret so no one can 'really' dispute it, and mostly
        because the algorithms overlap A LOT, actually I use a superset of the
        algorithms he displays on his site.... not that I am any faster, lol),
        or C) Heise's method... he has many so the main one on his site.... (I
        stress for the first half of it, since I don't always do the edge then
        corner thing replacing this by sub-optimal ZB, but I know most of his
        final step algs and use them actively.) He has a lovely method, I highly
        suggest reading it in it's entirety. 3. Nope rarely start out with a
        cross, although I am an "adaptive-cubist" so I do this when an unplesent
        situation comes up for my initialization. Oddly, it typically will then
        turn out to be an excellent candidate for the cross and Fridrich F2L,
        though hopefully with ZB improvments (more like improvisions now since I
        do not know all the ZB algs). I have to resort to cross about 5% of all
        solves though I've been forcing myself to stick with my regular method
        more often since I am not native to the Fridrich F2L and get some
        undesired hesitations. In that case I would form it on the top, then
        imidiately grip it to the left and just continually rotate the whole
        cube while flicking in each c/e pair, this is usually so fast I overlook
        any ZB preprocessing opportunities, which I fine. 4. I use a fair number
        of algorithms, so many that it is imparitive that I count in the way
        that groups inverses and mirrors together and not more then one for any
        particular case (considering primary and secondary effects combined).
        Not even going to count any c/e algs, even the involved ZB ones. I don't
        want to take the time to count them all but probably respectable even in
        these ranks. I know more then the standard (pure) Fridrich system.... I
        know all PLLs and multiple c/e algs for most cases, some obsure Lars 6+7
        ones, and almost all the Lars 5+6 ones.... a full complement of optimal
        OLLs and the fairly rare ELL set. Oh and some really, really nasty ones
        that are short i.e. multiple CLLs so I can OLL+CLL combined for many
        cases, and stuff like swap and twist two corners and swap some two edges
        of the same face. If you notice the massive overlaps, I must say that
        many are for my own novelty purposes only and do not serve to improve my
        times (actaully increasing them typically but allowing for the 15%
        chance of 1-look/1-alg LL, greatly assisted by ZB and some other
        (secret) preprocessing I tend to do). Actaully, on average it hurts my
        times since I have to do more in-depth recognition phases. My ELL
        insection pause is embarassing for an CLL/ELL cubists, except for the
        trivial cases. 5. I am very much so, still in the journey of learning
        new algorithms.... I don't imagine I'll ever stop. Equivallently said: I
        don't imagine myself learning all 1211 LL algorithms!.... at least not
        yet, shall I say :). 6. Ah yes, the golden question.... I don't consider
        it a great judge of a cuber, for the record. Things like experience,
        amount of practice, contribution to the cause, even helpfulness to the
        community or number of people one has taught the fine art should be
        factors in the equation to show the full image. In my opinion (always a
        useful thing to add since it will be less likely people will be offened
        and instead will tend to add to the point.) But just to answer your
        posed question, I would have to say about 20.5s. However, I haven't
        taken an average as of late.... actually the posted unoffical is still
        20.9s or so from 3 months ago if I recall correctly. So that is all to
        say that there are many cubists "slower" then me that I highly respect!
        &gt; Thanks for your time :) Hey, no problem man. BTW, if anyone is
        offended by anything I say (like not just "disagree") here or in the
        future... please just private message or e-mail me... no need to be
        bitter or "fight fire with fire." -Doug (Happy Cubing Friends!) p.s.
        sorry about the occassional lengthy posts, but I consider a thourgh
        answer better then a very short one. Oh, private message me about that
        too... if you 'really' have a problem with it, lol. --- In

        Hi, This post really got some responses! &gt; 1. What kind of cube do
        you use? Rubiks.com mostly. I have a studio cube, but the rubiks.com one
        I use now is more flexible, and I like that. The stickers are the vinyl
        crap from rubiks.com, I am still looking for a shop here that sells me
        vinyl so I can cut my own. &gt; 2. What method do you use? For
        speedcubing classic Fridrich, improved with some algs. For fun I do
        corners first, or layer by layer. &gt; 3. If you start out with a cross
        do you start with it on the bottom &gt; left top or other? Top, then F2L
        switch to left, then LL switch to bottom &gt; 4. How many algs do you
        know/use? All Fridrich OLL/PLL, a couple from corners first methods
        (very short, intuitive not really algs), and some of my own, that are
        not published anywhere as far as I know. I don't know to how many that
        adds up, and it all depends on mirror/reverse counting, maybe I know 80
        to 90 algs. Some are really absurd, like orient and permute edges and
        permute corners in one alg. Every 100th cube I get a 1 look last layer
        with these. I am interested to know though if this could become a method
        for the last layer. &gt; 5. Are you still learning algs? Yep. I am
        slowly learning CLL algs, that I can use in the corners first system or
        in my newest try: - cross - F2L 3 pairs - Orient edges - Last F2L pair -
        CLL - ELL &gt; 6. What's your best avg? 23.4, done last week &gt; 7.
        What's one of your most memorable cube moments? Seeing Yasmara (my wife)
        competing in the Rubiks cube world championships 2003. Michiel

        As for the record without looking with a partially mixed cube, a
        beautiful way of demonstrating the phenomenal concentration (memory!) of
        certain human beings. This type of performance happens normally only
        once officially. The public has to wait or keep silent a few minutes
        while the cubist concentrates before resolving his cube with a blindfold
        on his eyes, unless the cube had been previously mixed. Is a really
        ramdom state practicable without looking? No and this way I prefer the
        record of the speedcubist and the fewest movements. His inventor had
        baptized it "B√ºv√∂s Kocka" in Hungarian which means magic cube. Do you
        want calculation? How to act alone? No need to drag a tricky witness in
        my suitcase. Whoever mix the cube knows nothing in advance. The risk of
        error is already sufficient. Given the impression that the cube mixed by
        so many people who will be the one that I shall make without looking?.
        How to proceed with it one second to one exchanges without any other
        visible physical object than the cube?. Without forgetting to use the
        most difficult movements (middle layer), change of axis to be fully
        visible. Without waiting, behind my back, without seeing and quickly,
        nothing more magic, nothing more beautiful in the eyes of the public.
        Believe me error and boldness are fragile. Too magician for the cubist
        and too cubist for the magician. Am not I "B√ºv√∂s Kocka"? I have no
        excuse for my absence in the championship, I did not break to an arm. I
        imagine myself making a success of my trick in front of the world in
        Toronto. Once motivated, I would have tempted my official luck. Faulted
        and disqualified, a true shame! On the contrary maybe I would have
        succeeded who knows?. Knowing where the game stops that, is the
        question. I have already realized my dream several times. Sometimes
        being UNIQUE is worth an official record. Believe me I am looking
        forward to meeting an experienced cubist. I wish to have a little fun
        with my behind-the-back trick in front of the public. Version integral
        USA 2004 with the public. It takes about 7 years for the best to become
        an expert in the chess game and 1 year to become an expert of the
        speedcubist. Learning, being young is a trump for performance. However
        the cube offers a variety of record. I did not know one of these two
        games 20 years ago. I believe that it is more difficult to estimate a
        Cubist than a chess player. There will always be comparisons. The cube
        is played alone and it is also an incredible visual art! My corner
        method is easy and fast for the rubik's cube few algorythms, sub 30 sec
        and good approach for the system 2x2x2.

        &gt; 2. What method do you use? Fridrich with pre-emptive orientation of
        edges followed by placing the last pair, orienting corners and permute
        all. &gt; 3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it on the
        bottom &gt; left top or other? I still do the cross on top and then flip
        the cube over for the rest of the solve - I estimate cutting 2s off my
        time when I learn to do the cross on the bottom. &gt; 4. How many algs
        do you know/use? 23 This is the interesting one... I have a reasonably
        good average for someone who uses few algs... I'm fairly intuitive
        (although I am very poor at working optimal crosses and 2x2x2 blocks) so
        once I know how an *sequence of moves* works, I don't consider it to be
        an alg. I looked at the first layer "algs" and only use those I can
        understand. I also have little difficulty mirroring algs (inverse is too
        difficult though) I know 12 permutation algs (still one left over) and 7
        corner orienting algs. I also had to learn 4 algs to finish the last
        corner-edge pairing without changing orientation I haven't learnt a new
        alg in ages, but I'm working on combining sunes and other algs to do in
        those cases where my LL can be solved in two 7 move algs vs one 7 move
        alg and one 12 move alg. I also try out different algs which do the same
        thing to try to get a move which is more natural. (I've used 3 different
        algs for the Y permutation) &gt; 6. Whats your best avg? 24.2s

        7. Most memorable cube moment. The World Championship as a whole, but
        I'll pick one favorite moment. In the second round, I was one of the
        last to go on stage because I had the 4th best time in the first round.
        This meant the pressure was right on me because I'd seen a lot of other
        cubers set very good times already (Jess Bonde's 16.53 and Ron, Gene,
        DanK and David Wesley all had 17.x times). I felt very nervous and as a
        result, I got off to a shaky start: 20.x and 24.x (my worst time of the
        championship). On the final cube, my hands were shaking like a leaf, and
        I couldn't get my hands under control. I finished the F2L in 15 seconds
        and - luckily for me - I got a nasty piece pop where the pieces dropped
        on the floor. At the same time, David Allen was standing next to me and
        he got 16.99. At this point I felt very bad inside and my confidence was
        low, but I thanked God for another chance. I tried to fill my mind with
        positive thoughts, but I couldn't stop thinking that I was out of the
        championship. On my reattempt I took a long deep breath and started
        solving. I did one of my smoothest solves at the WC and finished the
        cube in 17.17. I was in the final! I punched my fist in the air and got
        a nice applause from the crowd. I went off stage and got congratulations
        from everyone. LarsV

        Hi Sam, &gt; 1. What kind of cube do you use? I use the Ideal Deluxe
        cubes mostly. I also use the Rubik's game cube, and a few Ideal cubes
        from 1980 made in England, Hungary, and Hong Kong. &gt; 2. What method
        do you use? I use my own method. I don't know if anyone's interested in
        knowing it. &gt; 3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it
        on the bottom &gt; left top or other? Don't use the cross. &gt; 4. How
        many algs do you know/use? Somewhere between 200 and 300. Haven't
        finished my inventory. I use almost all of them regularly. &gt; 5. Are
        you still learning algs? If you mean learning others. No. All the algs I
        use are my own. Am I still developing algs? Yes, all the time. &gt; 6.
        Whats your best avg? A tick over 30 seconds at the moment. &gt; 7. best
        cubing moment? The first time I solved it. &gt; Thanks for your time :)
        You're welcome. Thanks for asking. :) David J

        Hey all! I just wonder if anyone here is interested in supercubing, ie
        solving the cube normally but also orienting the face centers for
        "supercubing". Orientation of the face centers is also called by
        mathmatical group theorists as the supergroup of the cube. And normal
        solving is then a subgroup of this supergroup. Objected oriented
        programmers should also be aware of thie phraseology ;-) I am interested
        in both speedsupercubing and solving the "supercube" in as few moves as
        possible. Especially the latter since this is something i haven't found
        any computer program capable of doing. I know there are now programs
        that will ignore parts of the cube and/or restrict available face turs.
        If there is an interest in this here, should we start another group or
        just discuss it here? There is a group for corners-first-cubists, so
        there is already more than one group for "cuboids" around the world w
        access to the web ;-) I also welcome private mail about supercubing if
        anyone regards it too specialised for general interest :-) Btw, my best
        average for supercubing is 43.6 secs. And my average in moves so far is
        around 53 moves. This is only 10-11 moves more than Mirek's record for
        normal cubing. I know Ron has done some supercubing and has achieved
        under 30 secs in average, but he hasn't posted yet. He doesn't wanna
        spoil all the categories i guess ...

        First off, it's been a while... new members to the &gt; community and
        all, so I would like to &gt; take this opportunity to introduce myself
        for those &gt; who care... (ok lost cause, lol). My &gt; name is Doug; I
        am a college student, and &gt; self-proclaimed math-geek. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        1. My main cubes are rubiks.com brand, off the shelf &gt; (those since
        then, I have ran &gt; into some poor quality ones, i.e. unbalenced
        spring &gt; tension on average too loose). &gt; &gt; 2. I use my own
        method basically (created 4 years &gt; ago, still being perfected)
        except &gt; with the use of zero to one step of c/e pairing &gt;
        algorithms that are found everywhere &gt; but have now become
        inuitive.... I am also adapting &gt; the ZB-technique of c/e pairing
        &gt; and taking in various sets of algorithms that do &gt; some very
        specific, fairly advanced &gt; and obsure things. It is best categorized
        as a &gt; Lars-Varient but it has many forms due &gt; the steps being
        modular, that is the steps are not &gt; sequencially static. In it's
        extremes &gt; it essentially becomes either A) the nearly pure &gt; lars
        method with only partial early &gt; edge orientation or substituting the
        equivalent ZB &gt; stuff with steps 5+6 condensed &gt; into one, B)
        Gilles new method (no offence, partly &gt; my opinion, partly since my
        method &gt; is bit secret so no one can 'really' dispute it, &gt; and
        mostly because the algorithms &gt; overlap A LOT, actually I use a
        superset of the &gt; algorithms he displays on his site.... &gt; not
        that I am any faster, lol), or C) Heise's &gt; method... he has many so
        the main one on &gt; his site.... (I stress for the first half of it,
        &gt; since I don't always do the edge then corner &gt; thing replacing
        this by sub-optimal ZB, but I know &gt; most of his final step algs and
        use &gt; them actively.) He has a lovely method, I highly &gt; suggest
        reading it in it's entirety. &gt; &gt; 3. Nope rarely start out with a
        cross, although I am &gt; an "adaptive-cubist" so I do this &gt; when an
        unplesent situation comes up for my &gt; initialization. Oddly, it
        typically will &gt; then turn out to be an excellent candidate for the
        &gt; cross and Fridrich F2L, though &gt; hopefully with ZB improvments
        (more like &gt; improvisions now since I do not know all &gt; the ZB
        algs). I have to resort to cross about 5% of &gt; all solves though I've
        been forcing &gt; myself to stick with my regular method more often &gt;
        since I am not native to the &gt; Fridrich F2L and get some undesired
        hesitations. In &gt; that case I would form it on the &gt; top, then
        imidiately grip it to the left and just &gt; continually rotate the
        whole cube while &gt; flicking in each c/e pair, this is usually so fast
        I &gt; overlook any ZB preprocessing &gt; opportunities, which I fine.
        &gt; &gt; 4. I use a fair number of algorithms, so many that &gt; it is
        imparitive that I count in the &gt; way that groups inverses and mirrors
        together and &gt; not more then one for any &gt; particular case
        (considering primary and secondary &gt; effects combined). Not even
        going &gt; to count any c/e algs, even the involved ZB ones. I &gt;
        don't want to take the time to &gt; count them all but probably
        respectable even in &gt; these ranks. I know more then the &gt; standard
        (pure) Fridrich system.... I know all PLLs &gt; and multiple c/e algs
        for most &gt; cases, some obsure Lars 6+7 ones, and almost all the &gt;
        Lars 5+6 ones.... a full &gt; complement of optimal OLLs and the fairly
        rare ELL &gt; set. Oh and some really, really &gt; nasty ones that are
        short i.e. multiple CLLs so I &gt; can OLL+CLL combined for many &gt;
        cases, and stuff like swap and twist two corners and &gt; swap some two
        edges of the &gt; same face. If you notice the massive overlaps, I &gt;
        must say that many are for my own &gt; novelty purposes only and do not
        serve to improve my &gt; times (actaully increasing them &gt; typically
        but allowing for the 15% chance of &gt; 1-look/1-alg LL, greatly
        assisted by ZB &gt; and some other (secret) preprocessing I tend to do).
        &gt; Actaully, on average it hurts my &gt; times since I have to do more
        in-depth recognition &gt; phases. My ELL insection pause is &gt;
        embarassing for an CLL/ELL cubists, except for the &gt; trivial cases.
        &gt; &gt; 5. I am very much so, still in the journey of &gt; learning
        new algorithms.... I don't imagine &gt; I'll ever stop. Equivallently
        said: I don't imagine &gt; myself learning all 1211 LL &gt;
        algorithms!.... at least not yet, shall I say :). &gt; &gt; 6. Ah yes,
        the golden question.... I don't consider &gt; it a great judge of a
        cuber, for the &gt; record. Things like experience, amount of practice,
        &gt; contribution to the cause, even &gt; helpfulness to the community
        or number of people one &gt; has taught the fine art should &gt; be
        factors in the equation to show the full image. &gt; In my opinion
        (always a useful thing &gt; to add since it will be less likely people
        will be &gt; offened and instead will tend to add to &gt; the point.)
        But just to answer your posed question, &gt; I would have to say about
        20.5s. &gt; However, I haven't taken an average as of late.... &gt;
        actually the posted unoffical is still &gt; 20.9s or so from 3 months
        ago if I recall correctly. &gt; So that is all to say that there are
        &gt; many cubists "slower" then me that I highly respect! &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Thanks for your time :) &gt; Hey, no problem man. &gt; &gt; BTW, if
        anyone is offended by anything I say (like &gt; not just "disagree")
        here or in the &gt; future... please just private message or e-mail &gt;
        me... no need to be bitter or "fight fire &gt; with fire." &gt; &gt;
        -Doug (Happy Cubing Friends!) &gt; &gt; p.s. sorry about the occassional
        lengthy posts, but &gt; I consider a thourgh answer better &gt; then a
        very short one. Oh, private message me about &gt; that too... if you
        'really' have a &gt; problem with it, lol. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        orient&amp;position edges with 1-2 algs. 4. (no F2L algs) LL: 7 corner
        orientations, 2 corner position, 15(ish) edge algs 5. Always-right now
        working on the final 15 edge algs for a full 3 look LL, then going to
        start working on a 2 look (ll corners, ll edges) 6. Best avg. is a
        horribly slow (comparativly speaking) 47 ish. 7. (chris's question- best

        I've found out that i do my best cubing on days when im in a good mood.
        When I cube I think about everything thats goin on. I dont really just
        sit there and focus on the cube, my mind just starts thinking. If its
        been a bad day or theres something thats been frustrating me, then i get
        frustrated when im cubing and my times suck. But when its been a good
        day it seems like i can look ahead alot better and the moves just work
        alot smoother.... does this happen to anyone else? -heath

        found any computer program capable of doing. Over the last few weeks I
        have been doing just that. The Java Cube applet on my website has some
        built-in solvers, and I have been adapting it for supercubing. This new
        version will be appearing on my website soon. The main solver in my
        applet uses Kociemba's algorithm, but with smaller tables so it is
        nowhere near as fast. Adding the centre orientations makes it much
        slower. Instead of about 10-30 seconds for a random cube, this now often
        becomes a minute or two for a random supercube. I've got some optimal
        results for the subgroups, so I'll list them below. Two generator group
        &lt;U,R&gt;: u++: (R' U R U2 R U2 R' U2)2 (16,22q) u++: (R U R' U2 R' U2
        R U2)2 (16,22q) All the sequences can be cyclicly changed by the way,
        for example the first one can be changed to (U R U2 R U2 R' U2 R')2 etc.
        In this case inverses can be used too. There are no others of 16 moves
        in the two- generator group. u-,r-: (R U2 R2 U R2 U2)3 (18,30q) u+,r-: U

        Yes, colour discrimination is important, but so is opposite colour
        identification (eg. opposite colours can be identified during
        orientation). If you are trying to identify opposite colours, it helps
        to have related opposite colours rather than unrelated opposite colours.
        As an example, consider Petrus step 3. In this step, you need to orient
        all edges on the front and top sides simultaneously. How do you spot bad
        edges quickly? (ie. those facing the wrong direction?) If the front side
        is white, you scan the two faces for white *or* yellow edges.
        White/yellow edges facing to the front are good, while white/yellow
        edges on the top facing up are bad. At the same time, if the top side is
        green, you scan the two faces for green *or* blue edges. etc. The closer
        these colours are, the easier it is. The "plus yellow" colour scheme is
        ideal here because the opposite colours can be very easily grouped
        together in our minds. Opposite colour identification is also useful in
        permutation, although it may be that those who start with any colour use
        this style of thinking more than those who always start with the same
        colour. I expect that many of the cross starters who begin with the same
        colour have memorised the correct order of the four colours around the
        cross. When I form a cross (step 3):
        http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step3.html I may end up with
        any colour on top. I have not bothered to memorise the correct order of
        edges for all 6 possible faces, but I can still permute the edges
        without any problems just by observing the order of the front two faces
        (eg. F and R) and knowing the opposite colours. From there it's just
        simple pattern recognition. Ryan

        Hi Jaap! Yes, that is very interesting. I would still like to see this
        implemented in a true platform-specific language like Delphi for
        windows. So maybe if i get permission from Kociemba i will try to
        implement supercubing in his otherwise superb cube-explorer. If so i
        would like to know how u have implemented this in ur applet, since u use
        the same algorithm :-) And by the way. There is one big annoyance with
        all java-applets. (At least in internet explorer.) Most interactive
        rubik's cube java applets will let u maneuvre the cube using the mouse.
        But when u press and hold down the right mousebutton and drag the
        mousecursor outside the applet-area and release the button ... yeeesshh
        ... always page frozen, and it will have to be killed with task manager
        :- ( Is there any way around this? Any fix/patch available? Can it be
        avoided in the applet-code ?? &gt; --- In

        attempt.... 18.6s &gt; for some= &gt; &gt; freshmen.... &gt; &gt;
        sometimes I do a 31s in front of a crowd and just put it away (my &gt;
        frined th= &gt; &gt; en &gt; &gt; comments I am having a bad day or I
        just say I need some more &gt; practice)... = &gt; &gt; I think I'm &gt;
        &gt; just too busy or in a rush most of the time to do these types of
        &gt; preformanc= &gt; &gt; es. I do of &gt; &gt; course get invited to
        more random parties that way.... those which &gt; I'm not = &gt; &gt; to
        into (i.e. &gt; &gt; alcohol present) and then I get to be a "clown" for
        a couple &gt; hours, which i= &gt; &gt; s stupid. &gt; &gt; Speedcubing
        should be thought of not as recreation (well perhaps &gt; to some de=
        &gt; &gt; gree) &gt; &gt; but moreso as a serious professional skill.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is not to say that I don't show people when
        they come &gt; specifically to = &gt; &gt; my room.... &gt; &gt; that's
        ideal heck even when I'm busy... especially if it's a cute &gt; girl :)
        o= &gt; &gt; r group of them. &gt; &gt; Actually I have about 400 worn
        out stickers on my door to attract &gt; and welco= &gt; &gt; me such
        &gt; &gt; things..... In THIS case, impressing people comes at a
        free-be... &gt; or I come= &gt; &gt; accross as &gt; &gt; an obsessed
        person, lol. They come in to see about 20 cubes in &gt; plane sight =
        &gt; &gt; (small &gt; &gt; room) counting non-cubical and a giant 3ft
        cube on my wall not to &gt; mention l= &gt; &gt; ube. I do &gt; &gt; a
        typical 21s-ish solve. If they are a good audience they ask for &gt; and
        I exp= &gt; &gt; lain in depth &gt; &gt; what it is I am actaully doing
        step by step. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But in general I do agree that Grant's
        approach would be the ideal &gt; way of g= &gt; &gt; oing about &gt;
        &gt; this. But I'd like to add something...., if it is someone that you
        &gt; feel com= &gt; &gt; fortable with &gt; &gt; being honest with I
        usually say something like: "so that was a &gt; solve at aro= &gt; &gt;
        und the &gt; &gt; world record time :)" (which was true when I said it).
        &gt; Equivalently somethi= &gt; &gt; ng like: "that &gt; &gt; was Xs
        short of the world record" would be helpful in putting &gt; things in
        pre= &gt; &gt; spective for &gt; &gt; those unfamiliar with the field.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In college ,especially around the math department, I
        definately &gt; don't want = &gt; &gt; to get &gt; &gt; notarity by my
        cube times; I prefer it to be respect based on my &gt; academic r= &gt;
        &gt; ecord :). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Hi all, &gt; &gt; &gt; Just another problem; &gt; &gt; &gt; You are
        solving the cube in front of a lot of spectators &gt; (knowing &gt; &gt;
        &gt; nothing about records) and you want of course to make a maximum
        &gt; &gt; &gt; impression. If you now solve the cube in one second or
        so, you &gt; are &gt; &gt; &gt; met as an illusionist or bluffer but not
        as a cube-solver. If &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; solve it in an hour or
        more, you¬¥ll make very little impression. &gt; So &gt; &gt; &gt;
        evidently, an optimum does exist. &gt; &gt; &gt; Where is it?? &gt; &gt;

        &gt; 1. What kind of cube do you use? 1980 ideal (made in hungary) and
        2002 rubik's studio &gt; 2. What method do you use? basic cross, f2l, LL
        &gt; 3. If you start out with a cross do you start with it on the &gt;
        bottom left top or other? cross on bottom &gt; 4. How many algs do you
        know/use? 38 LL algs (i consider an 'alg' a sequence of moves for which
        i use a unique and exact same set of wrist/finger flexions every time)
        &gt; 5. Are you still learning algs? yes, i am learning the remaining 40
        algs necessary for a full 2 look LL &gt; 6. Whats your best avg? i don't
        take averages that often and i certainly don't have a 'best' average.
        after warm up, i generally solve in around 32-34 seconds nowadays and
        it's dropping slowly but surely. i'm consistent if nothing else; i
        almost never get times below 30 or above 37. &gt; Thanks for your time

        Hi Eric, This is a good example of how newspapers (and other media) can
        get things wrong, if only a little wrong. Seven Towns owns the rights,
        having acquired, for example, Ideal's license. Winning Moves, Hasbro,
        and Hessport sells them under license from Seven Towns. I'm not sure of
        Rubik's Studio, which is owned directly by Rubik. Most of the cubes are
        made in China, except for Rubik's Studio which I believe are made in
        Russia, and packaged by whichever outfit is marketing it. David J --- In

        that I have now adapted the Cubie applet so that it can handle face
        centre orientations, i.e. solve a supercube. Other changes are: - New
        Square-1 optimiser, and yet another solving method. - Added these
        puzzles: Pyrix, Morph head, Drive Ya Crazy, Trio. - A script for playing
        with the Hockey Puck puzzle. Let me know if anything doesn't work. Jaap

        wow .. that was awesome to watch :) it must be hard to solve with so
        small hands. I saw on the WC pics, that someone had a very largs 3x3
        cube that several ppl were playing with. I bet most of them had problems
        getting good times on it, and that must feel almost the same as it does
        for Wictoria solving a regular 3x3 :) I have a 4 year old that i'm

        Hi Eric. Dave from Seven Towns here. We own (on behalf of Erno) the
        trademarks and copyrights in the cube, the name Rubik/Rubik's and it's
        "image". We are toy inventors and as such don't physically sell anything
        to customers, therefore we license the rights to sell cubes to companies
        such as Winning Moves who sell the Rubik's range on our behalf and with
        our permission. On another important note where the speedcubing
        community might help me: We are always tracking down the distributors
        and sellers of "fake" cubes. This is theft from Mr Rubik and obviously
        as his representatives we take this very seriously, the next generation
        of speedcubers are unlikely to realise what a great puzzle this is if
        they first encounter such tacky cubes ! Should anyone see these on sale
        anywhere it would be a great help if you could let me know where they
        are being sold and where they come from (normally says something like
        "made in Taiwan" ) with as much detail as possible, and (if possible)
        send me a picture. That way we can stop this happening. I went to a
        "Cracker Barrel" restaurant in Florida this year who were selling fakes,
        I made such a fuss the manager removed them - it would have made a great
        video as I must have looked completely insane ! Those of you who make
        your own variations of cubes please don't worry - I'm only talking about
        the cheap and nasty stuff that you see for sale in stores. My e-mail is
        davej@... &lt;mailto:davej@...&gt; . Many thanks for your support. Dave

        j_rueth wrote: &gt; eh shoot. I'm sorry, i'm new to the whole website
        thing, but what &gt; is a bandwidth and how can get my site back up? For
        a cheap answer... Bandwidth is data transfer - each time someone loads a
        webpage or looks at a picture or video on your site, that uses
        bandwidth. Cheap/free web space like geocities frequently has a fairly
        low bandwidth limit, so even if you get just a moderate amount of
        traffic over a short period of time, it will shut down temporarily.
        There's not really much you can do about it, aside from minimizing the
        unnecessary content on your site and/or expecting it to go down
        temporarily from time to time. Based on the error message produced
        ("Access to this site will be restored within an hour"), it sounds like
        they monitor bandwidth usage on an hourly basis, so your site should be
        down no longer than 1 hour at a time. - Grant

        lars@l... http://lar5.com theres webspace and bandwidth. webspace is the
        amount of file storage u have on geocitie's servers. this allows u 2
        upload photos, movies, text, etc. bandwidth is kind of like monthly
        allowance of website activity. i go through Freewebs, so i get 500mb of
        bandwidth. bandwidth is measured by the number of hits u get.a typical
        website is about 50k, thus every hit measures up to 50k. so 2000 hits
        would measure up to 100mb. i dont know how much geocities supplies u, so
        i really couldnt help u in that area.i only have 1 suggestion 2 u: DONT
        USE GEOCITIES!!!!!!!!! youre probably gonna have 2 increase ure
        bandwidth some how(if the problem is that u r actually out of it). i
        dont know if there is some kind of premium service or something with
        geocities, but if there is, they will for sure offer more badnwidth in
        their package. other than that good luck.

        Hi, Dave, this is Hana the solitary 3d cube designer here. I am the last
        person in the world, who wants to rob Mr. Rubik of hisgreat invention,
        but.... I need a lot of cubes. At the WC2003 I had 345 cubes, wqhile the
        speedcubists actually needed only one. Needless to say, I haven't paid
        10 dollars fror each sand every one of my cubes. Some I got as presents,
        others I bought at garage sales. Qhen the first craze subsided, cubes
        could be had for as little as a dollar apiece. I bought them then, and I
        wish I bought more. :-((( I know you at seven towns are not actually
        selling them, but, please, pass this simple rule: increase the quality
        and decrease the price. Charge less for bulk quantities. If a person
        purchases, say, 500 cubes, that will cost $5000 + shipping. If you slash
        that prce un half, that will cost $2500 + shipping. Of course, no one
        will buy 500 cubes offhand. so you might go down to 50 cubes. Also, make
        the cubes less stiff. Finally, Dave - I sent you an email. Do you think
        you van respond? Thank you. Hana a kostky --- In

        Dear Hana If you only knew what the production cost are of an orginal
        Rubik's Cube, than you would not think $10 is to much. The Rubik's cube
        is a high quality product, the new Rubiks.com is no longer stiff and the
        future cubes will have strong stickers. Seven Towns is constant busy
        improving the cube. If you realy need 500 cubes the price will not be as
        cheap as you might think, you have to pay tax and import fees. 500 cubes
        is a big box of about 65 Kg so shipment is not cheap. As you might know
        I have a special arrangement with the Rubiks Studio to make the Studio
        Cube available to the speedcube community. Believe me, we (the
        speedcubing Community) have all the support of Seven Towns and the
        Rubik's Studio, and they will help us as long as our request are
        reasonable. Ton --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Hana M.

        I haven't paid 10 dollars fror each sand every &gt; one of my cubes.
        Some I got as presents, others I bought at garage &gt; sales. Qhen the
        first craze subsided, cubes could be had for as &gt; little as a dollar
        apiece. I bought them then, and I wish I bought &gt; more. :-((( &gt;
        &gt; I know you at seven towns are not actually selling them, but, &gt;
        please, pass this simple rule: increase the quality and decrease the
        &gt; price. Charge less for bulk quantities. If a person purchases, say,
        &gt; 500 cubes, that will cost $5000 + shipping. If you slash that prce
        &gt; un half, that will cost $2500 + shipping. Of course, no one will
        buy &gt; 500 cubes offhand. so you might go down to 50 cubes. Also, make
        the &gt; cubes less stiff. &gt; &gt; Finally, Dave - I sent you an
        email. Do you think you van respond? &gt; Thank you. &gt; &gt; Hana a

        speedcubing community might &gt; help me: &gt; &gt; We are always
        tracking down the distributors and sellers of "fake" &gt; cubes. &gt;
        &gt; This is theft from Mr Rubik and obviously as his representatives
        &gt; we take &gt; &gt; this very seriously, the next generation of
        speedcubers are &gt; unlikely to &gt; &gt; realise what a great puzzle
        this is if they first encounter such &gt; tacky cubes &gt; &gt; ! Should
        anyone see these on sale anywhere it would be a great &gt; help if you
        &gt; &gt; could let me know where they are being sold and where they
        come &gt; from &gt; &gt; (normally says something like "made in Taiwan"
        ) with as much &gt; detail as &gt; &gt; possible, and (if possible) send
        me a picture. That way we can &gt; stop this &gt; &gt; happening. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I went to a "Cracker Barrel" restaurant in Florida this
        year who &gt; were &gt; &gt; selling fakes, I made such a fuss the

        Thank You heres what i do... when my cube starts to get a little stiff
        and not running like it should (i use a rubiks studio cube that i got
        from Ton)I take it apart, and use an old toothbrush to clean out the old
        spary, because it gets dirty. I clean off every piece, and get as much
        as i can off the center mechanism. Then i put it back together, except
        for one edge piece. and i spray some Silicone spray into it ( i use
        Prestone silicone lubricant..its in a yellow can). dont spray too much
        though, you dont want it running out the other side. then pop the last
        piece back in and mix up the cube a bit. I pop out another piece and
        spray again....piece back in and mix it again...and do that maybe one
        more time. After i have the silicone worked around all the pieces I just
        have to get it to dry. I just sort of pull the layers apart and blow
        into the cube..it works pretty good, I do that and keep mixing until its
        nice and smooth again. then i get a damp towel and wipe off the cube so
        i get the silicone off the stickers. the thing that takes the longest is
        cleaning the pieces. Some people use a spray each piece individually
        with the cube apart, but thats too much work for me, and i think my way
        works just as good. -heath

        Hi Jake, I noticed that the included images are in fact much larger than
        they are shown. Since you don't even link to them, I'd suggest you scale
        down your pics and include those then. This will save a lot of bandwidth
        and will also look better, since real graphics programs do nicer scaling
        than web browers. Cheers! Stefan

        Yes, I agree with Ton and I sympathize with Hana. I would like to add to
        this discussion however. Last month I was trying to contact several
        different outlets including rubiks.com for bulk purcheses of 100 cubes
        (that's over $1,100 when you include tax and frieght!). I don't feel
        that $10 is unreasonable for a good quality Rubik's cube, of course $9
        would be better (they sell for $9 at my local stores in Hasbro
        packaging, but $11 on rubiks.com). As for quality I do think that they
        could have that improved. A big annoyance I persoanlly have with them is
        that the parts are not always identical, I mean specifically the
        CORNERS. I do tend to have to purchese several cubes and then one or two
        good ones come out of that investment. I was very irritated last month
        when the last cube I prepared didn't turn out so great and kept popping,
        it was rediculous and the tension was unbalenced. I immediately check
        the box and it said "Colors and Parts may Vary." So I'm like, what the
        heck! The pieces are made from molds, heck the molds are made from molds
        and the drying conditions should be identical. As for colors, I don't
        really care... I can always resticker it. As for the tension, I don't
        agree with Hana (perhaps because I am a speedcuber and not an
        artist)..., the usually tension is fine, not too stiff for my initial
        liking (and I stress initial, good tension early means I can wear it in
        properly). However, they DO need to be more balenced, in both tension
        and maximum distance the layers can be pulled apart. Once that is in
        place I can just wear it in, being careful of course not to over do it
        like my last one. So one thought comes to mind: "QUALITY-CONTROL-CHECK!"
        So as I was saying about the corner pieces... there are 3 major internal
        surfaces, one of which usually has imperfections due to the way it was
        molded. This is sometiems not level and it comes a bit sunken inward or
        buldging outward; the former is preferred and is true for most Studio
        cubes and my main cubes. So that is the room for improvment, I think.
        Now as for Trademarks.... I agree that there are some really crappy
        cubes floating around that DON'T DESERVE TO BARE THE RUBIK'S NAME and is
        an insult to the inventor. One time someone got me a cube from a dollar
        store (*hint, hint* for Seven Towns to crack down on) and it was so
        rediculously bad... wieghted about 1/4 the normal weight of a cube and
        all the pieces were hollow and the plastic was very thin and *britle*. I
        did end up spending 30-40 hours on it off&amp;on (it had a tiled
        white-blue scheme btw) and made it a decent cube. But at first it was
        like "What did I do to deserve THIS!" So ya, it was that bad. I am
        promtped by Dave's post, and I will surely report any illegal cubes I
        see in stores in the future. On a happier note, you guys need to
        advertise more frequently and widely; I have talked to many students
        around campus that don't even think that cubes are still being
        manufactured! (One guy said that he always thought they were physically
        impossible to solve (like the Sam Lloyd 14-15 puzzle where there is a
        built in parity error of the puzzle where you have 15 tiles sliding
        around a 4x4 frame).) The Key: "CUBE-EDUCATION," lol. Oh, ya so once all
        these problems are worked out (throw in stickers since I know people
        have beef about that one too), then we can talk about actaully
        manufacturing "professional speedcubes." I'll lone the manufactures one
        of mine to re-create the mold, lol. As we all saw at WC, cubes have the
        potential (minus the crappy $1 cubes, lol, and that enormously oversized
        one Heath brought (I think it was his)) to be incredibly smooth and make
        beautiful, crisp sounds. I wish they could "bottle that" and make cubes
        that way from the start. No market for it (yet) though (especially
        considering production costs), but I'd pay like $80 for one of them (and
        I'm cheap so there will be cubers willing to pay $100 for one so that
        times say 200 per year makes it seem more attainable someday as demand
        increases, hopefully). All this was not to say that Seven Towns is not
        busy improving cubes. I just think they need an expert like Ton on the
        inside to help them out and give the expert opionions. In the mean
        while, we got Studio cubes :). But something needs to be done with their
        screw/spring assembly, like use screws that are only treaded on the
        bottom like Seven Towns does and add 1-2 mini-washers to it. -Doug (one

        the last &gt; &gt; person in the world, who wants to rob Mr. Rubik of
        hisgreat &gt; &gt; invention, but.... I need a lot of cubes. At the
        WC2003 I had 345 &gt; &gt; cubes, wqhile the speedcubists actually
        needed only one. &gt; &gt; Needless to say, I haven't paid 10 dollars
        fror each sand every &gt; &gt; one of my cubes. Some I got as presents,
        others I bought at garage &gt; &gt; sales. Qhen the first craze
        subsided, cubes could be had for as &gt; &gt; little as a dollar apiece.
        I bought them then, and I wish I bought &gt; &gt; more. :-((( &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I know you at seven towns are not actually selling them, but,
        &gt; &gt; please, pass this simple rule: increase the quality and
        decrease &gt; the &gt; &gt; price. Charge less for bulk quantities. If a
        person purchases, say, &gt; &gt; 500 cubes, that will cost $5000 +
        shipping. If you slash that prce &gt; &gt; un half, that will cost $2500
        + shipping. Of course, no one will &gt; buy &gt; &gt; 500 cubes offhand.
        so you might go down to 50 cubes. Also, make the &gt; &gt; cubes less
        stiff. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Dave - I sent you an email. Do you

        detail as &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and (if possible) send me a picture.

        I think it would make sense to just have one per category (the fastest
        officially, if it was a category at wc). Of course then the offical
        record holder will then probably have two entries in the given list, but
        that's ok. Use a different color though, I'd like to see Jess Bonde's

        background like you did for Minh Thai's a long time ago would be fine.

        Me, either. If I am correct, since the unofficial record site was
        founded by Chris to aim to beat old official reocord, presenting other
        official record may encourage those who are interested in other
        categories. And hopefully this community would expand much bigger.

        Hi all; I do have a question. If we are to look out for "nonRubiks
        Cubes" how can you tell by looking? I can understand if it's in a store
        and you can see the packaging. Now on to another question of the same
        sort. How can you tell by looking if a cube is what the buyer says it
        is. Like on eBay? What if any, are the signs? Size, color, color
        placement, logo straight, logo diagonal. I see all kinds of 1980's new
        in package Rubiks Cubes sealed. Can they even be real? I did buy one
        that claimed to be a 1980's Rubils Cube in the clear plastic "tube" made
        by Ideal. But I can't tell if it's real or not. It clicks when I turn it
        and it is real stiff. Is that how they were made back then? Or do they
        stiffen up with age? This one was opened and used just a little. Any
        information would help me a lot. Thank you, Sherree

        One of the best ways to find out is if there is a logo on the white
        side. But if there isn't, then someone might have restickered it. You
        could pop off a center cap, if there are little black things instead of

        The new cubes all have a logo on it, so this must be easy to see. And
        they must have the standard color scheme white opposite Yelllow For the
        old types, if it is sealed and has the logo on it is is most likely
        original. Cubes from 1978-1979 and some of the 1980 had no logo, the
        logo can wear down on a orginal cube. Normally you see it is a 1980
        rubik because of the bright orange, but also the other sticker colors is
        a give away, then you can look at the inside at the kernel, the orginal
        have a white kernel. However there are some Rubik's com cube that looks
        like a clone cube- have an arched edge aand a clear plastic kernel-, but
        this is a very rare type (David Allen uses one). Cubes from before 1980
        are very hard to get and are very different. Most of the early types are
        very stiff when new, they did not use any lubrication, but you can
        adjust them because they have a screw. If is has lubrication this can be
        some yellow gel type lubricant. See more on orginal Rubik's cube types

        Hi, im new to rubiks, seen fridrich's site and her times and i just HAD
        to get one... before now ive maybe touched one once or twice as a really
        little kid (im 20 now) after 3-4 hours, i found the 1st layer to be very
        easy, im unfortunialty having trouble getting any farther, i just cant
        get over breaking the first layer and fixing it later... i actually
        tried using the alg's in the "hint book" that comes with it (the MB
        Hasbro cube) i really like fridrich's site and plan to use the "by
        layers" way of solving... I guess im asking is where is a first place to
        actually get started, i kinda want to just solve the cube once and then
        go through it again slowly seeing how the alg's work and understand them
        more and get used to them. some of jessicas site confuses me a little i
        guess ill have to take a day and read all the way through it... does
        anyone know a good site for a complete newb to learn how to speed cube
        (well not really "speed" with this cube, its pretty stiff right now, i
        bought it today) but anyway, any help would be more then loved, just
        really looking for 3sided pictures to algs, and the steps taken to
        change everything (i understand the rubiks step moving code) - Zachery

        speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re:
        Trademarks Yes, I agree with Ton and I sympathize with Hana. I would
        like to add to this discussion however. Last month I was trying to
        contact several different outlets including rubiks.com for bulk
        purcheses of 100 cubes (that's over $1,100 when you include tax and
        frieght!). I don't feel that $10 is unreasonable for a good quality
        Rubik's cube, of course $9 would be better (they sell for $9 at my local
        stores in Hasbro packaging, but $11 on rubiks.com). As for quality I do
        think that they could have that improved. A big annoyance I persoanlly
        have with them is that the parts are not always identical, I mean
        specifically the CORNERS. I do tend to have to purchese several cubes
        and then one or two good ones come out of that investment. I was very
        irritated last month when the last cube I prepared didn't turn out so
        great and kept popping, it was rediculous and the tension was
        unbalenced. I immediately check the box and it said "Colors and Parts
        may Vary." So I'm like, what the heck! The pieces are made from molds,
        heck the molds are made from molds and the drying conditions should be
        identical. As for colors, I don't really care... I can always resticker
        it. As for the tension, I don't agree with Hana (perhaps because I am a
        speedcuber and not an artist)..., the usually tension is fine, not too
        stiff for my initial liking (and I stress initial, good tension early
        means I can wear it in properly). However, they DO need to be more
        balenced, in both tension and maximum distance the layers can be pulled
        apart. Once that is in place I can just wear it in, being careful of
        course not to over do it like my last one. So one thought comes to mind:
        "QUALITY-CONTROL-CHECK!" So as I was saying about the corner pieces...
        there are 3 major internal surfaces, one of which usually has
        imperfections due to the way it was molded. This is sometiems not level
        and it comes a bit sunken inward or buldging outward; the former is
        preferred and is true for most Studio cubes and my main cubes. So that
        is the room for improvment, I think. Now as for Trademarks.... I agree
        that there are some really crappy cubes floating around that DON'T
        DESERVE TO BARE THE RUBIK'S NAME and is an insult to the inventor. One
        time someone got me a cube from a dollar store (*hint, hint* for Seven
        Towns to crack down on) and it was so rediculously bad... wieghted about
        1/4 the normal weight of a cube and all the pieces were hollow and the
        plastic was very thin and *britle*. I did end up spending 30-40 hours on
        it off&amp;on (it had a tiled white-blue scheme btw) and made it a
        decent cube. But at first it was like "What did I do to deserve THIS!"
        So ya, it was that bad. I am promtped by Dave's post, and I will surely
        report any illegal cubes I see in stores in the future. On a happier
        note, you guys need to advertise more frequently and widely; I have
        talked to many students around campus that don't even think that cubes
        are still being manufactured! (One guy said that he always thought they
        were physically impossible to solve (like the Sam Lloyd 14-15 puzzle
        where there is a built in parity error of the puzzle where you have 15
        tiles sliding around a 4x4 frame).) The Key: "CUBE-EDUCATION," lol. Oh,
        ya so once all these problems are worked out (throw in stickers since I
        know people have beef about that one too), then we can talk about
        actaully manufacturing "professional speedcubes." I'll lone the
        manufactures one of mine to re-create the mold, lol. As we all saw at
        WC, cubes have the potential (minus the crappy $1 cubes, lol, and that
        enormously oversized one Heath brought (I think it was his)) to be
        incredibly smooth and make beautiful, crisp sounds. I wish they could
        "bottle that" and make cubes that way from the start. No market for it
        (yet) though (especially considering production costs), but I'd pay like
        $80 for one of them (and I'm cheap so there will be cubers willing to
        pay $100 for one so that times say 200 per year makes it seem more
        attainable someday as demand increases, hopefully). All this was not to
        say that Seven Towns is not busy improving cubes. I just think they need
        an expert like Ton on the inside to help them out and give the expert
        opionions. In the mean while, we got Studio cubes :). But something
        needs to be done with their screw/spring assembly, like use screws that
        are only treaded on the bottom like Seven Towns does and add 1-2
        mini-washers to it. -Doug (one of the few sub-25 cubers that still

        Needless to say, I haven't paid 10 dollars fror each sand every &gt;

        &gt; &gt; sales. Qhen the first craze subsided, cubes could be had for
        as &gt; &gt; little as a dollar apiece. I bought them then, and I wish I
        bought &gt; &gt; more. :-((( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know you at seven
        towns are not actually selling them, but, &gt; &gt; please, pass this
        simple rule: increase the quality and decrease &gt; the &gt; &gt; price.
        Charge less for bulk quantities. If a person purchases, say, &gt; &gt;
        500 cubes, that will cost $5000 + shipping. If you slash that prce &gt;
        &gt; un half, that will cost $2500 + shipping. Of course, no one will
        &gt; buy &gt; &gt; 500 cubes offhand. so you might go down to 50 cubes.
        Also, make the &gt; &gt; cubes less stiff. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally,

        (normally says something like "made in Taiwan" ) with as much &gt; &gt;
        detail as &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and (if possible) send me a picture.
        That way we can &gt; &gt; stop this &gt; &gt; &gt; happening. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went to a "Cracker Barrel" restaurant in Florida
        this year who &gt; &gt; were &gt; &gt; &gt; selling fakes, I made such a
        fuss the manager removed them - it &gt; &gt; would have &gt; &gt; &gt;
        made a great video as I must have looked completely insane ! &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those of you who make your own variations of cubes
        please don't &gt; &gt; worry - I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; only talking about the
        cheap and nasty stuff that you see for &gt; sale &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt;
        &gt; stores. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My e-mail is davej@s...

        Hi Sherree, It can be difficult to tell which are the fakes, I guess
        that's a deliberate attempt by the manufacturers to confuse people. The
        real ones will all have the Rubik's logo in the white centre, I have
        seen one fake that used what looked like a Rubik's logo which makes them
        even harder to find. "Good Morning America" did a piece on the
        championship and they all had fake cubes ! We are going to get the TV
        coverage up on the website ASAP. An example of a fake is attached,
        generally fakes have the wrong colour scheme and are much cheaper - they
        mostly use hollow cubies. Best wishes Dave -----Original Message-----

        Phoney cubes Hi all; I do have a question. If we are to look out for
        "nonRubiks Cubes" how can you tell by looking? I can understand if it's
        in a store and you can see the packaging. Now on to another question of
        the same sort. How can you tell by looking if a cube is what the buyer
        says it is. Like on eBay? What if any, are the signs? Size, color, color
        placement, logo straight, logo diagonal. I see all kinds of 1980's new
        in package Rubiks Cubes sealed. Can they even be real? I did buy one
        that claimed to be a 1980's Rubils Cube in the clear plastic "tube" made
        by Ideal. But I can't tell if it's real or not. It clicks when I turn it
        and it is real stiff. Is that how they were made back then? Or do they
        stiffen up with age? This one was opened and used just a little. Any
        information would help me a lot. Thank you, Sherree Yahoo! Groups

        Another technical suggestion from me: better springs. Well, I can't look
        at the ones in rubiks.com cubes, but I got some studio cubes. The ends
        of the springs scratch on the screw head on one side (doesn't matter
        much) and on the center cubie on the other side (does matter). Not only
        does it scratch into the plastic, the springs are also contorted the
        wrong way. That is, when you turn the center cubie then because of the
        friction the spring puts a force on the screw that drives it out. I've
        had this several times, a center pieces falling out this way (together
        with the adjacent cubes of course). And here's a legality question: What
        about the Meffert 3x3 cubes? Did they license it or are their cubes
        different enough and don't wear the name "Rubik" or what else allows
        them to produce/sell their cubes? Stefan

        Hey, welcome to the group! I have a word document with graphics that
        gives a complete solution for beginners, I've been handing it out to all
        the people who ask at school. Granted it's not a very quick method,
        maybe 1:30 if you're good, but it has alternate algorithms listed for
        many of the cases, making it possible to get down around 45s or so, I
        did with it. As for online web resources, Dan Knights, Jessica Fridich,
        and www.speedcubing.com have more algorithms and tips than you'll know
        what to do with (my beginner method for the LL is based on Dan Knight's
        on his web page, I credit him in the file, hope that's ok Dan!) Anyway,
        anyone here would be happy to help though, and if you want the word
        document, shoot me an e-mail, swedishLF@... . Good luck! Daniel --- In

        a place in the unofficial records lists for the official records, for
        the sake of immediate comparison. That way, if all you're looking for
        are 3x3x3 records, you can look at the unofficial 3x3x3 list, with a
        highlighted entry for the official record, and you've got it... Makes
        sense, right? Just my thoughts. - Grant

        Hi Sherree, On ebay, the ones in the boxes which are bright yellow on
        the inside and display the cube sideways were made by Ideal in 1980, and
        sold mostly in the USA. The majority of them have the original
        "Official" color scheme Blue opposite White, Green opposite Yellow and
        Red opposite Orange. They were made in a number of places - Hong Kong,
        Taiwan, USA - assembled in Dominican Republic, etc, and the plastic
        varied in each place over time and there's no way to tell that I know
        of. All the screws were adjusted by hand and the workers were all
        different. If you can remove the cap and get to the screw you can adjust
        it to your liking. The clear cylinder was copied. Is there a square
        indentation on the top of yours? If it's square it probably ideal, if
        it's round it's probably a "Magic Puzzler". The Ideal versions sometimes
        have where they were made, like Hong Kong or Hungary, stamped on the
        bottom, in addition to "Ideal Toy Company." Your best bet might be the
        cardboard tube version made for Britain. They seem pretty consistant in
        the good plastic. If you twist your cube for a while, take it apart and
        clean it, then spray it with a non-oil-based silicone lubricant and let
        it air dry, then put it back together, you may find it much better. If
        you use too much lube it can be a little tacky at first - then either
        wear it away or wipe some of it off. If the plastic on the inner cubies
        isn't flat some light sanding may help before cleaning and lubing. David

        There is a cardinal difference between cube artists ans speedcubists. It
        is the numberof cubes we are using. Techbically, speedcubists need only
        onecube. It should satisfy all orequisits of speedcubing, be properly
        lubricated, have screws and good springs, anything to aid in
        competitions. Cube artists appreciate those qualities, also - make no
        mistake about that. But one cube is not enough. We need a lot of cuybes.
        PS Strictly speaking, this is true only about multi-cube artists. I am
        one. At theWC on Toronto, my designs gobbbled up 345 cubes. If I were to
        sell those dsigns, I would have to charge 3450 dollars, before I could
        take any profit for mtself, if we take each cube at $10 and do not
        include shipment. This is a considerable sum of money, and would makje
        rhe design quite expensive. Second factor is complexity of creating he
        design, so-called twiddle and set up fee. Even designs with fewer number
        of cubes would vary in price. Take the 270cube design from Toronto. This
        design is very easy to construct, so the twiddle fee would be less.
        Malovicky or aroslav designs made from same number of cubes would be
        much more expensive, because they are cnsiderably harder. I would gladly
        diuscuss the twiddle fee with a prospective client so that he or she
        knows what he or she is paying for. It would be great, if I could buy my
        cube directly from the manufacctrer, bypassing the retailer, who wants
        his share of the profit. Of course, there is shipment, also. But for
        bulk order, maybe this, too, could be reduced. Ton is offering the
        reduction inshioment, cutting it in half for 4-5 cubes. So, with $10per
        cyube, that would translate to $75 for 5 cubes. Am I right, Ton? I am
        talking about Rubik's studio cubes without any prelubing or other
        preparation, of course, I know I have to pay extra for that. I am
        wondering if ribiks.com dould offer similar reduction for bulk
        quantities. That would reduce the cost of the design, because I would
        pass the savings to the client. There is ne tghing I noticed about
        rubiks.com that I like - they sell a cube with no stickers, and sell
        stickers separsateky. Then you can use your own color scheme or duscuss
        this with your ckient. So, group, what do you say? And don't tell me I
        can set up the pattern manually without twiddling!! I know that. I also
        know I could 'create' a pattern hsat would not be an element of Rubik's
        cube froup - and I value my reputation too much for that!!!!!!!!!! Hana

        Maybe for bulk Rubik's cube the Rubik's Promotion cubes is a possibility
        for you. All promotion cubes are made by Intermed Asie,but do not sell
        to end users. The promotion cube are available at: Rubiks.com sell
        promotion cubes (500 is the mininal amount) or http://www.cubeu.com/
        (minimal amount is 250) , I am not sure if this site is allowed to sell
        user designed promotion cubes, this since Rubiks.com claims that
        Intermed Asie is the exclusive partner in the premium and promotions
        business. They normmaly sell offical Rubik's collegiate cubes. Maybe
        this is a possibilty for you. You can even make you own pattern on the
        cube, like some Escher type patterns. You could make some great designs.
        You can even use the white cube or any other colors. I think the price
        per cube for 500 is much less than $10 per cube. All depends who many
        cubes you realy need, are you planning to sell some designs? Ton --- In

        One thing everyone must realize is that Art of many forms is expensive.
        Look at the supplies one needs to make a painting, or all the work that
        is done on a movie. Yes movies are art, and its amazing that we can go
        to our local movie store and buy it for under $20. In your case Hana,
        you as the artist must also buy supplies, being cubes. AND that is a
        major problem because they arent cheap in a bulk sense. It would be nice
        to see a very very good bulk price but that would be unfair to the
        companies as well as the manufactors. It becomes a very expensive
        investment and it would be hard to make anything off of cube art unless
        you have a very wealthy person willing to buy your designs. There really
        isnt much of anything anyone can do. I'm sure if you deal with
        rubiks.com they may try and work out some sort of discount, it may not
        be much, but it may only be the best offer you can get. Jake --- In

        that. But one cube is not &gt; enough. We need a lot of cuybes. PS
        Strictly speaking, this is true &gt; only about multi-cube artists. I am
        one. &gt; &gt; At theWC on Toronto, my designs gobbbled up 345 cubes. If
        I were to &gt; sell those dsigns, I would have to charge 3450 dollars,
        before I &gt; could take any profit for mtself, if we take each cube at
        $10 and &gt; do not include shipment. This is a considerable sum of
        money, and &gt; would makje rhe design quite expensive. &gt; &gt; Second
        factor is complexity of creating he design, so-called twiddle &gt; and
        set up fee. Even designs with fewer number of cubes would vary &gt; in
        price. Take the 270cube design from Toronto. This design is very &gt;
        easy to construct, so the twiddle fee would be less. Malovicky or &gt;
        aroslav designs made from same number of cubes would be much more &gt;
        expensive, because they are cnsiderably harder. I would gladly &gt;
        diuscuss the twiddle fee with a prospective client so that he or she
        &gt; knows what he or she is paying for. &gt; &gt; It would be great, if
        I could buy my cube directly from the &gt; manufacctrer, bypassing the
        retailer, who wants his share of the &gt; profit. Of course, there is
        shipment, also. But for bulk order, &gt; maybe this, too, could be
        reduced. Ton is offering the reduction &gt; inshioment, cutting it in
        half for 4-5 cubes. So, with $10per &gt; cyube, that would translate to
        $75 for 5 cubes. Am I right, Ton? I &gt; am talking about Rubik's studio
        cubes without any prelubing or other &gt; preparation, of course, I know
        I have to pay extra for that. I am &gt; wondering if ribiks.com dould
        offer similar reduction for bulk &gt; quantities. That would reduce the
        cost of the design, because I &gt; would pass the savings to the client.
        There is ne tghing I noticed &gt; about rubiks.com that I like - they
        sell a cube with no stickers, &gt; and sell stickers separsateky. Then
        you can use your own color &gt; scheme or duscuss this with your ckient.
        &gt; &gt; So, group, what do you say? And don't tell me I can set up the
        &gt; pattern manually without twiddling!! I know that. I also know I
        &gt; could 'create' a pattern hsat would not be an element of Rubik's

        Yes, rubiks.com will offer a 10% discount on purcheses of 100 cubes....
        25% on sets of 300! But unless you are willing to buy 300, they are
        actually a bit over priced to begin with when accounting for the
        shipping. ($11 per cube as opposed to the usual $10, I actually get $9
        at some of my local retail stores.) One idea is actually to go to the
        retail stores for a bulk discount. (Since rubiks.com is actually a
        middle-man, where as the retail stores are too, but offer can defry the
        cost of shipping significantly.) As for Jake's unfairness comment, I
        don't agree. As long as both sides are willing, anything goes (provided
        they arn't those off brand/illegal ones). The companies do have an
        incentive to sell bulk. I contacted several places and they responded
        well to my propositions last month. -Doug --- In

        Hi, i bought my cube 2 days ago, solved it tonight, had a friend
        scramble it up... (being lame and using the hint book that comes with
        the thing) i had the whole thing solved again... almost... i have it
        entirely solved but the problem is between Yellow/Blue/Green... on the
        green side facing the yellow, the middle peice is yellow (and blue on
        the yellow side), and on the blue side the same thing... so the yellow
        center is sandwhiched between a green and blue edge (the green-yellow
        and blue-yellow edge) ive tried ron's online cube solver and its
        currently at 700 steps trying to solve it but has not (min:2 max:20) i
        think something twitched it or some shit when i friend was messing with
        it but i dont know i could be a tard and this is "common" ? and if it
        did get broken some how could someone tell me/send me instructions on
        how to properly take apart my cube and put it back together (the MB
        Hasbro kind) i bought it 2 days ago dont want to break it already :-/
        thank you - Zachery

        logo straight, &gt; logo diagonal. I see all kinds of 1980's new in

        "tube" made by Ideal. But I can't tell if it's real or not. &gt; It
        clicks when I turn it and it is real stiff. Is that how they were &gt;

        Hi, Ton, I went to rubiks.com and saw their promotion cube. They are
        what I call picture cubes. Picture cbes are not really suitable for my
        designs, I need regularcubes, like the speedcubists ard usuing. L also
        daw the other site. Picture cubes again. Furthermore, they cost $1195
        without a stsnd and rthe stand can be bought separately for #2.95. You
        get free shipping if you buy 3 cubes with stands. No mention is made
        about promotion cubes. Do I want to sell my designs? Yes, for two
        reasons. The first is, of course, to make some money. That is the
        universal reasoin for selling tgings. Second reason is, that I want to
        get the designs to become known to people at large. And if the seller
        brings me good cbes with easily distinguishable color schemes. I ill
        charge only the twiddle fee. Guys, if you can find nice, easy-to-twiddle
        Rubik's cubes, that are not picture cubes and that cost as little as
        possible iun bulk quantities, or promotion cubes. I'd appreciate
        knowing. Thanks a lot. Hana a kostky --- In

        for you. You can even make you own pattern &gt; on the cube, like some
        Escher type patterns. You could make some &gt; great designs. You can
        even use the white cube or any other colors. I &gt; think the price per
        cube for 500 is much less than $10 per cube. &gt; &gt; All depends who
        many cubes you realy need, are you planning to sell &gt; some designs?

        &gt; enough. We need a lot of cuybes. PS Strictly speaking, this is true
        &gt; &gt; only about multi-cube artists. I am one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        At theWC on Toronto, my designs gobbbled up 345 cubes. If I were to &gt;
        &gt; sell those dsigns, I would have to charge 3450 dollars, before I
        &gt; &gt; could take any profit for mtself, if we take each cube at $10
        and &gt; &gt; do not include shipment. This is a considerable sum of
        money, and &gt; &gt; would makje rhe design quite expensive. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Second factor is complexity of creating he design, so-called
        &gt; twiddle &gt; &gt; and set up fee. Even designs with fewer number of
        cubes would vary &gt; &gt; in price. Take the 270cube design from
        Toronto. This design is very &gt; &gt; easy to construct, so the twiddle
        fee would be less. Malovicky or &gt; &gt; aroslav designs made from same
        number of cubes would be much more &gt; &gt; expensive, because they are
        cnsiderably harder. I would gladly &gt; &gt; diuscuss the twiddle fee
        with a prospective client so that he or &gt; she &gt; &gt; knows what he
        or she is paying for. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It would be great, if I could
        buy my cube directly from the &gt; &gt; manufacctrer, bypassing the
        retailer, who wants his share of the &gt; &gt; profit. Of course, there
        is shipment, also. But for bulk order, &gt; &gt; maybe this, too, could
        be reduced. Ton is offering the reduction &gt; &gt; inshioment, cutting
        it in half for 4-5 cubes. So, with $10per &gt; &gt; cyube, that would
        translate to $75 for 5 cubes. Am I right, Ton? I &gt; &gt; am talking
        about Rubik's studio cubes without any prelubing or &gt; other &gt; &gt;
        preparation, of course, I know I have to pay extra for that. I am &gt;
        &gt; wondering if ribiks.com dould offer similar reduction for bulk &gt;
        &gt; quantities. That would reduce the cost of the design, because I
        &gt; &gt; would pass the savings to the client. There is ne tghing I
        noticed &gt; &gt; about rubiks.com that I like - they sell a cube with
        no stickers, &gt; &gt; and sell stickers separsateky. Then you can use
        your own color &gt; &gt; scheme or duscuss this with your ckient. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; So, group, what do you say? And don't tell me I can set
        up the &gt; &gt; pattern manually without twiddling!! I know that. I
        also know I &gt; &gt; could 'create' a pattern hsat would not be an
        element of Rubik's &gt; &gt; cube froup - and I value my reputation too

        Hi Hana You can also order a regular color based cube, e.g with your own
        logo. However the stickers will be paper based But I was also thinking
        about a stripe pattern or a Tartan pattern etc you could make many other
        designs. Maybe even a promotional "commercial" design for some company.
        I would suggest as many artist do, make some commercial art to fund your
        regular art. Else your investment will be very expensive. Maybe you
        could suggest to sell a promotional "commercial" sculpture via Patick
        Hess (Rubiks.com). Success Ton --- In

        Yes this is a common thing in genral solving (i.e. not when resticted to
        OLL/PLL type). Your cube is A) not broken, B) your friend probaly didn't
        mess it up, and C) this type of parity error that transforms a cube into
        one of the 11 equivalence classes of unsolvable positions cannot happen
        without a piece pop.... The two edge pieces (each edge piece = two
        "stickers") you are referring to need to be flipped. (if I am reading
        your post correctly) In that case place your edges on top, i.e. so that
        your yellow center is pointing up :) and one problem edge in front
        (presumably the other would be in the back, but this does not have to be
        the case for this to work). So I'm going to give the mathematical way of
        approaching this problem: 1. perform a monoflip on the UF edge (call
        this operation g) that fixes everything else on the top layer 2. perform
        a U^2 (since that is the case you seem to be in) 3. perform g^-1 (do
        what you did in step 1 backward) 4. post-adjust with U^2 This is a
        simple little communtator, in mathematics, when you consider the cube as
        a non-abelian group. My preference for the monoflip to use for step 1 is
        MD2M'DMD'M' as the usual extended Singmaster notation mainstream in the
        cubist community, where M denotes turning the middle slice downward pi/2
        just as the shape of the letter suggests. But that's probably becase I
        am accustom to executing center slicing. BTW, don't complain about the
        little book that came with the packaging, this case can be solved by a
        composition of two of the edge algorithms they give (the book will call
        these sequences). Hope that helps.... it's certainly not the optimal
        (one of the 100- 200 optimal length 12 in HTM ones) of solving this case
        but this will require little or no memorization. -Doug Li --- In

        No, your cube is definately not broken -If Doug's post confused you
        which I'm sure it did(ya lost me at pi/2 ???) a simpler less
        mathematical solution to that problem is here-&gt;
        http://www.ai.sri.com/~cheyer/rubiks/rubiks.html scroll to the bottom
        and do EF-1 with the 2 edges held the way Doug said on the top with them

        &gt; that transforms a cube into one of the 11 equivalence classes of
        &gt; unsolvable positions cannot happen without a piece pop.... &gt;
        &gt; The two edge pieces (each edge piece = two "stickers") you are &gt;
        referring to need to be flipped. (if I am reading your post &gt;
        correctly) &gt; In that case place your edges on top, i.e. so that your
        yellow &gt; center is pointing up :) and one problem edge in front
        (presumably &gt; the other would be in the back, but this does not have
        to be the &gt; case for this to work). So I'm going to give the
        mathematical way of &gt; approaching this problem: &gt; 1. perform a
        monoflip on the UF edge (call this operation g) that &gt; fixes
        everything else on the top layer &gt; 2. perform a U^2 (since that is
        the case you seem to be in) &gt; 3. perform g^-1 (do what you did in
        step 1 backward) &gt; 4. post-adjust with U^2 &gt; This is a simple
        little communtator, in mathematics, when you &gt; consider the cube as a
        non-abelian group. &gt; My preference for the monoflip to use for step 1
        is MD2M'DMD'M' as &gt; the usual extended Singmaster notation mainstream
        in the cubist &gt; community, where M denotes turning the middle slice
        downward pi/2 &gt; just as the shape of the letter suggests. But that's
        probably becase &gt; I am accustom to executing center slicing. &gt;
        &gt; BTW, don't complain about the little book that came with the &gt;
        packaging, this case can be solved by a composition of two of the &gt;
        edge algorithms they give (the book will call these sequences). &gt;
        &gt; Hope that helps.... it's certainly not the optimal (one of the 100-
        &gt; 200 optimal length 12 in HTM ones) of solving this case but this
        &gt; will require little or no memorization. &gt; &gt; -Doug Li &gt;

        I dissagree with that, I think people should learn to do the first face
        the first time by figuring it out for themselves. I don't think it is
        beyaond the normal personal's intelect/ablitity to do so. As for desire
        level, if they lack passion for it then then don't deserver to be a
        cuber. Of course not EVERYONE can do this, but I think most people can
        do this, given some time to fiddle with it. A few years ago, when I
        showed it to my hs tennis team, almost everyone who tried could do a
        face in a reasonable amount of time. This also held for the people that
        I have taught the art. Now if you meant, first LAYER (there's a subtle
        distinction between layer and face), then that's a different story. I
        think that has to do with seeing or understanding the mechanism. Once
        that is out of the way, something methodical, like doing all 4 conrers
        first then the 4 edges (this was how I first made it mythodical for
        myself) or doing 4 edges then the 4 corners.... which although makes
        sense to all the cross experts here, may not be the best thing for
        beginners to do. Come to think of it though, back when I started to be
        able to get part of the cube (before I could solve the whole thing) I
        did just solve piece by piece for a layer, i.e.
        edge-corner-edge-corner... etc. but a bit smarter, expanding on both
        sides of the "circle." Before I could solve the cube (i.e. memorize even
        the most basic algorithms), I tended to solve a 2x2x3 block, adding a
        couple 1x2x2's leaving something like Richard decribed in his method
        posting. then I'd do repetitive moves (now I know to be triggers) and
        see if I could randomly get to solved state (having the last 7 pieces
        land in randomly). So b4 I cracked the cube booklet, I could typically
        get down to like 3 unsolved edges surrounding a solved corner, then have
        to mix it up again after examining the marvel for a few days. (as a
        mathy guy, I tried to consider the solvability of these close-to-solved
        positions and come up with some generalizations; hoping that I didn't
        get a dud cube like what happened to Chris back in the day :) that was
        stuck in one of the 11 equivalence classes of mecanically unsolvable
        positions (NOT counting forced corner twists of a loose cube as
        'mecanical,' *cough*)). -Doug (I easily amuse myself with reminiscing of
        the good-old- days... when solving sub-2min could impress everybody, now
        solving under 20s can't even impress me. Must of been even better in the
        80s. Oh wait, that was the 80s!, better off where I am :).) --- In

        My more or less relevant thoughts... When I teach people, I tell them to
        figure out how to do the 2x2x2 by themselves. I show them some examples
        and answer questions when they're stuck, but I insist that they figure
        it out themselves. This is both because I think they learn better that
        way, and because I don't know how else to do it... It's not a problem at
        all. Almost anyone who is interested enough to want to learn to solve
        it, is interested enough to spend an hour or so figuring it out. People
        don't need to be particularly smart to do it either. That's not to say
        that my experiences teaching one method in person transfer to teaching
        an other by a written document, just my experience. I usually start with
        taking the cube apart to show them that it's not made up of 54
        independent stickers or 27 little cubes, but 8 corners, 12 edges, and a
        centerpiece. You can *tell* people the same thing, and they'll nod and
        smile, but most won't *really* get it. I wouldn't teach beginners
        starting with the full first layer. It's not a good method, and it's not
        easier to learn than better methods, so why do it? The only advantage it
        has is that it's the obvious way that everyone starts. And that makes it
        even more fun to introduce people to something different. They get to
        feel like they're learning 'the secret trick'. -- "They say the grass is

        Great, I had basicly the same ideas the 3 colorcube , that I use to
        teach children (6-12 years) See
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Zomer%20Kamp/ZomerKamp.htm But for young
        children the letter notation (R F) does not work so I changed it in to :
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Zomer%20Kamp/Zomerkamp_nl.htm It is in
        Dutch but the pictures must be clear even without the text So in short
        your document can work if you are about 12 years or older, so it depends
        who old your beginner is. If you want younger beginners to understand
        than you must add more pictures with arrows. If you have children in
        your fammily you could "test" your document, or maybe a collegue that
        has children. Thats the way I "tested" my 3- color solution pages Succes

        Hey all, A friend of mine just gave me a puzzle as he saw that I was a
        'puzzle fan'... That's a strange one, it's called hungarian globe, it's
        like a 3D hungarian ring, and it represents the world. I figured out a
        way to bring pieces to their respective places on 2 of the 3 rings, but
        I don't know how to "orient" them (for example south is pointing to
        north on some pieces). Also I don't really know how to do the 3rd
        ring... Does anybody know of a good way of solving it? Does any web site
        exist? Well, that's not really a cube, but it's a Rubik's like puzzle, I
        guess it has its place here though... thanks F.

        Zachary, Don't pull on the corners! Turn one side 45 degrees. Pull up on
        an edge cubie while pushing down on the sideways edge cubie below it. It
        should just pop out. If you need more leverage use a plastic lever like
        a picnic knife, not a metal one like a screwdriver. Go to Rubiks.com and
        look at their assembly instructions and pictures. I hope this helps,

        David, Way back in the early 80s I "invented/reinvented" the keyhole
        approach (cross and use an empty middle layer edge/top corner to fill in
        the others) - I guess lots of people invent this! Since I started cubing
        again in September I have come to the conclusion I need to be a lot
        cleverer about my F2L and I've played about with starting with a 2x2, a
        3x2, spotting better ways to use the keyhole etc but I haven't found
        anything I'm that happy with yet. As most of my solving is onehanded I
        keep looking out for ideas that will maybe suit one handed solves even
        if they arent so optimal for two handed. Managed a couple of sub 60
        second one-handed solves! Mostly averaging 75-80seconds though. Duncan

        Francois, Wow you must have a good left hand! I'm righthanded and I'm
        not much good with my left. As for specific algorithms: I think my
        strategy is different for onehanded than it would be if I seriously
        tried to be fast with two. I tend to move the whole cube around much
        more to get it into more comfortable positions - this also means that I
        am looking more continuously than when I use two hands - its easier to
        be looking for the next move when you are moving the cube with one hand
        and more slowly. There are a couple of algorithms where I sometimes add
        in an extra turn onehanded - for example if I am swapping two pairs of
        corners in the LL (assuming they are on the U face) I will often (not
        always!? I dont know why) do R'UL'D2LU'R then do U2 and R'UL'D2LU'R
        again instead of R'UL'D2LU'R then L'UR'D2RU'L (hope I got that right I
        don't have my cube with me. I think I do this because I sometimes get
        confused over my lefts and rights one handed especially if I am moving
        the whole cube around. There are a few similar moves. Also I HATE slices
        one handed. I would be interested to hear what the really fast
        onehanders have to say. (Fastest non-fluke time so far is 53 seconds but
        this was way faster than I usually do). Duncan ----- Original Message

        November where there will be an 80's memorabilia fair (much Rubik's
        stuff to be had?!). The website for the event is
        http://www.memorabilia.co.uk/ This is an excellent opportunity for all
        us cubers in the UK to get to know each other, I'm sure there are more
        of us than we realise! So if you're interested, or would like more
        information, please drop me a line at cubestation@... I look forward to
        meeting you all! DanH :)

        Heh, do very many people use custom algorithms? ive had my cube for like
        3 days trying to learn algorithms online, but i feel kinda bad cause im
        not actually "working" to solve the cube, and i dont want to take 4
        months to solve the cube my first time. Do most people just use algs
        they can find, and if there able to do an algorithm thats faster then do

        The first time I solved a cube, I did it all in one night, 8 hours of
        work, using only my own algorithms. They were crap though :) I couldn't
        have averaged under 2 minutes with that system to save my life. (it was
        a kinda corners first method, but some of the algorithms were
        "controlled mess ups" so that they would fix certain problems when I got
        back to that stage, very inefficient). After that I started looking at
        other people's solutions say Dan K and Chris H solving videos and
        decided I had to learn to do that. They introduced the layer methods on
        their page, so I went from there. I did learn the cross and the first
        layer corners by myself, if you can call those algorithms, and I used a
        very poor algorithm for the middle layer edges. Admittedly I did look
        for the last layer algorithms though, and I found a better middle layer
        edge algorithm that I started using. So I'd say figure out the cross and
        at least the first layer by yourself if you can (kinda contradictory to
        my solution I posted, eh guys? I'll get around to fixing that, just make
        a link to the first layer section I suppose). But I really don't think
        there's any shame in looking up LL algorithms, they can be tough to find
        on your own. Just my $.02USD Daniel Hayes --- In

        Well, everybody's got to decided this for themself. There are very fast
        people that never worked it all out themsevles before resorting to
        significant resources and there are those that did take the time to
        figure it all out but are now slow, relatively... and vice-versa. So
        it's up to you really and it's probably about 1:4 on this group of the
        ratio of ppl that figured it all out themself to people that just
        learned algorithms blindly off the net (very rough estimate, plz correct
        me if that doesn't seem right). It does take a lot of time to figure it
        out for the first time, some say it's worth it, others don't. Do
        whatever you feel confortable with :). But more often then not, ppl use
        other's methods prematurely and never did the really hard part and then
        they wish they had of figured it out themselves... they think they could
        have done so, but I guess we'll never know. Of cousre taht is not to say
        that it isn't a lot of work to go through and do the customizations,
        which will surely have to be done for each individual depending on
        style, handsize, what moves they prefer, etc.... tehn there's the
        practice part... I just did about 3 hours worth of practice today for
        instance (to get back down to about 21-23s). -Doug Li --- In

        Rather than looking up a solution at first, just fiddle with it. Maybe
        you won't be able to solve it the first time, but you could at least get
        used to how the cube moves and how different moves affect the pieces.
        That's the most important thing. I solved the cube myself at first, in
        about 3 months. I didn't really think about different algorithms, but I
        did use a few of them, I suppose. But for the 4x4x4 I made quite a few
        algs for myself. And I'm doing pretty well, around 2.5 minute average.

        I know some of you have had some pretty bad piece pops and this one's
        not much in the way of that, but something very interesting happened. I
        was cubing away and my cube exploded, 7 cubies flew out, 4 corners and 3
        edges. They all landed pretty neatly in a pile, so I grabbed them and
        started to re-assemble. Missing one edge cubie. I have torn my corner of
        the room apart and have not found it. Nearest I can conclude this is
        what happened: The pop occured very close to the last step in my
        solution. I'd been cubing for a while and got into the cube zen state,
        of complete one- ness with the cube. So, while positioning this edge, it
        was going exactly where I wanted it to, I and I knew exactly where it
        was. This is when it got weird. Knowing it's position exactly made the
        cubie rocket out of the cube at a completely indeterminate (but very
        high) velocity, this was, nearly as I can tell, due entirely to
        Heisenburg's Uncertainty principle. I collapsed part of the cubie's wave
        function. So then when I started looking for it, I knew it had to be at
        rest, this was my second mistake. Since I knew exactly how fast the
        cubie was moving (not at all) it then became possible for it to be
        anywhere in the universe, which is where it has stayed since. Or it
        could be under something, I do kind of need to clean. -Daniel

        I've never felt guilt or shame in learning algs from friends and online.
        I think it is because I never saw 'just' solving the cube was good
        enough. When you're surrounded by friends that solve the cube in &lt;40
        seconds, solving the cube regardless of time is only a minor step
        towards your goal. "must catch up with friends" is all I heard for a
        long time. I finally passed them a month ago (roughly) but then Jake
        caught back up. It's an interesting thing, that friends can help each
        other improve that way thru friendly competition. -Richard --- Michael

        learn algorithms online, but i feel kinda bad cause im not actually
        "working" to solve the cube, and i dont want to take 4 months to solve
        the cube my first time. Do most people just use algs they can find, and
        if there able to do an algorithm thats faster then do that... I guess i
        dont really know where im going with this :-/ is it 'ok' to feel bad
        about not solving the cube completely on your own? - Zachery Yahoo!

        Daniel, The trouble is: E = M C squared not E = M C cubed. This causes

        Good suggestion, I remember something like that happening to me... one

        from across the room! (15ft, maybe?) Of course, I always get those ones
        were 5-7 pieces just explode into the air, and it takes me a while to
        hunt down the pieces, not to mention clean them, then relube. If it is
        the case that it landed in a light fixture then, that would be *BAD* ,
        especially if it's a halogen lamp... but of course if that was the case,
        you'd of smelled the burning plastic by now :). We all gota, keep better
        track of our pops! That's the main problem... I'm sure most of use have
        the reaction time for it. If I am standing up and I get a pop, I almost
        always catch it! (As I am finishing the solve left handed, lol. Except
        for the time when my cube really hates me and decides to pop with
        tremendous velocity straight into my EYES!!! good thing I wear glasses

        I found it under my floor heater behind my 120mm artillary shell casing
        (I use it to keep change). I was so hoping for some quantum physics
        weirdness! At any rate, today I was standing in a hall at school, cubing
        for some people and an edge piece popped out right at the end, the cube
        was solved except for that piece. I got a round of applause for shooting
        out my right hand and snatching the piece out of mid air... It was
        really cool, and would've remained so had a corner not flown out while
        inserting the edge back in. I was not so lucky as to catch this one. Fun

        &gt; I'd &gt; &gt; been &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubing for a while and got
        into the cube zen state, of &gt; complete &gt; &gt; one- &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ness with the cube. So, while positioning this edge, it was &gt;
        &gt; going &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly where I wanted it to, I and I
        knew exactly where it &gt; &gt; was. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is when it

        &gt; &gt; cubie rocket out of the cube at a completely indeterminate

        looking for it, I knew &gt; it &gt; &gt; had &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be
        at rest, this was my second mistake. Since I knew &gt; exactly &gt; &gt;
        how &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fast the cubie was moving (not at all) it then
        became possible &gt; &gt; for it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be anywhere in

        solving, I have a couple of &gt; questions to ask. First, it seems to me
        (I'm righty) that I can do &gt; much better with my left hand than with
        my right hand. Actually, this discussion has come up on here before, and
        I think that the majority of right handed cubists use their left hand
        more effectively for one handed cubing than their right hand, though
        obviously not everyone. &gt; Does it come from the fact my algs are
        customized for the right &gt; hand, and that it's easier to move slices
        on the 'outside' of the &gt; hand than on the 'inside'? Or do I have
        strange hands ;-)? I have conjectured that when you cube with both
        hands, using your right hand primarily, it is used for large, sweeping
        motions, while the left hand fixes minor alignment problems as you go...
        This makes it difficult for the right hand to do everything on it's own,
        because the smaller, alignment moves are not well practiced. &gt; Also
        what I wanted to know, is if one-handed cubers use specific &gt; algs, I
        mean algs you don't usually use for normal cubing? or maybe &gt; another
        method? I use the same approach and algs with two hands as with one,
        although some of the algs are not well enough learned, or are too
        complex, and I still need to relearn then with just the one hand. -

        I think my cubies actually crawl away and hide after I pop them. I would
        too if I were turned around and scraped up by pieces of palstic all day

        Hi Hana This is just a mistake, there are no plans for a 2005 world
        championship in Toronto. The most likely place at the moment is Orlando
        at the new Pop Century Resort (See Andy Camann's photo's), this is
        because Orlando is fairly easy to get to and relatively cheap with
        charter as well as normal flights from most of the world. Disney will
        offer a great deal on accommodation, free passes for their "worlds" and
        so on which could make it great fun - it would hopefully be nice and
        warm too! However; nothing has been confirmed yet because its too early.

        Hi, Dave "Disney World Championships" is yucky all right.If they want
        their name to be advertised, it can be done this way: "The World's
        Rubik'sGames Championships 2005 held at Disney Worls in Orlando". For
        Pete's sake, keep everuone's name but Rubik's out of the title! I went
        troi couple of congerences i my lifetime. No two conferences dealing
        with the same topic were held at the same venue consecutively.They were
        held in different cities and sometimes in different countries. I was
        wondering if Disney World would be interested in my designs. I wrote
        Anfy an email, askingg for a contact to write to at Disney, but he did
        not respond. I realize that iy would probably be impossible, but there
        is no harm in trying. All the best, Hana a kostky --- In

        I am also pursuing other means of getting good supply of cubes and
        stickers by directly contacting some of the wholesale distributors and
        manufactures. One of them came back with the price $5.50 per cube and
        another $6.00 per cube, each with a hugh minimum and some surcharges.
        I'm trying to work with these people to see if I can find a good deal to

        Hi Dave, On ebay and in local shops are a great number of Disney-theme
        counterfeit Rubik's cubes - Mickey, Minnie, Donald, etc, are all there
        in cheap cubes. Will you guys take them to court, and ask them to play
        host or can you talk them into a whole new marketing plan for their
        characters, and *then* have them play most. Just curious, David J --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello, group, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        just returned from speedcubiung.com.There is another nice &gt; article
        &gt; &gt; &gt; featuring Mt. Holland this time. As i was skimming this
        piece of &gt; &gt; &gt; literature, an item caught my eye. They say
        WC2005 will be held &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; Toronto. &gt; &gt; &gt; Mind
        you, I have nothing against the city of Toronto. It is a &gt; nice &gt;
        &gt; &gt; city with warm, hospitable people. But again? Tne same venue?
        I &gt; &gt; &gt; thought there was a discussion about the site of the
        next WC, &gt; but &gt; &gt; &gt; nothing definite was decided. It seems
        that the media always &gt; know &gt; &gt; &gt; first. :-) &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi, David J, those cubes you re talking about are picture cubes. They
        are part of single-cube-art category. Seven Towns could say that those
        cubes are not really illegal, because thu use specialized stickers.
        Iagre it would be ratrher awkward, if Seven Towns took Disney to court,
        then asked them to host the Championship. This is a possible way they
        could wiggle out of this dilemma. Just my 2 koruny (Czech currency, son

        Hey everyone, I've been trying to learn the stiff hands method for a
        while now (off and on working on it) and I'm beginning with the 2x2x2
        cube. I understand the orientation of the corners, i can do that easily,
        and i completely understand how to write (memorize eventually) the
        permutation of the corners. The thing is, i don't know what it means to
        write (or memorize) something like : (1)(2468)(37)(5) I get that the
        parity is even, as that is explained on the website. I think im supposed
        to swap the corners in position 3 and 7, but im not sure. Anyway, what
        do i do with a thing like (2468) I can't swap all of those... can I? Do
        i do a bunch of 3 corner cycles or what. Can anyone help me, i searched
        all over, and cant find an explination of what those grouping actually
        mean, just how to group them. Thanks a lot, ferret

        Hi David J (and Hana) Seven Towns would not say these are OK - and the
        stickers would not make a difference legally, however as with all of
        these things the trick is to find out where they are manufactured and
        imported. Disney would also have a case against these people as they
        would not have been granted rights to use the images of Mickey and Co.
        It's all a bit of a headache ! I haven't seen any cubes like this for a
        few years so I expect they didn't sell many and abandoned the
        manufacturing. Anyhow we are on the case with a lot of the "big-time"
        fake- cube people - will let you know if anything interesting develops.
        Thanks for your interest and help, much appreciated Dave -----Original

        [Speed cubing group] Re: Championships OOPS Hi, David J, those cubes you
        re talking about are picture cubes. They are part of single-cube-art
        category. Seven Towns could say that those cubes are not really illegal,
        because thu use specialized stickers. Iagre it would be ratrher awkward,
        if Seven Towns took Disney to court, then asked them to host the
        Championship. This is a possible way they could wiggle out of this
        dilemma. Just my 2 koruny (Czech currency, son to be replaced by euros.)

        I actually don't quite agree. Caltech in Pasadena is governed by an
        honor code. Namely, almost all of our exams are given as take home
        assignments. If it says "3 hours no notes or books," then the students
        are expected to time themselves and respect the restrictions. Cubing,
        most certainly on the internet, is also governed by the honor code. We
        submit our own personal records to www.speedcubing.com. We are given the
        priviledge of performing these records in our own homes and our own
        environment. We are not subject to go to an "examination hall" and
        perform under a proctor or anything like that. The Sunday contest is in
        the same way... any fool could easily make up numbers... but why would
        anyone do that? It's your own accomplishment... and you don't win
        anything. The honor code must be followed by both parties though.
        Putting in something to deliberately catch cheaters is not in the spirit
        of the honor code as I see it. Likewise, to preserve the integrity of
        cubing, everyone should also follow in the same spirit. -Tyson --- In

        completely understand how to write (memorize eventually) the &gt;

        (1)(2468)(37)(5) &gt; &gt; I get that the parity is even, as that is
        explained on the website. &gt; &gt; I think im supposed to swap the
        corners in position 3 and 7, but im &gt; not sure. &gt; &gt; Anyway,
        what do i do with a thing like (2468) I can't swap all of &gt; those...
        can I? Do i do a bunch of 3 corner cycles or what. &gt; &gt; Can anyone

        Thanks a lot, &gt; &gt; ferret I'm afraid I don't use that method but
        maybe I can help anyway. It is possible to do (2 4 6 8) on a 2x2x2
        because you can transpose corners but if you are ultimately after 3x3x3
        (or higher) then you'll need to be able to do it another way. Reading
        from left to right (permutations are often read right to left in
        mathematics etc.) you get (2 4 6 8)(3 7)=(2 4 6)(6 8)(3 7)=(2 4 6)(6 8
        3)(3 6 7). Note that (a b)(c d)=(a b c)(c a d), if you read from left to
        right.

        cube in 51s (I use Waterman's method). It was really bad for me: the
        stress was too big and I had to solve the first layer twice. I think I
        forgot half of algorithms (I was not able to do corner permutation and
        orientation in one step - normally I do). However the audience was
        really amazed (especially by some fingertricks - I think - I had no time
        to watch the people and lots of spotlights blocked my eyes) and chose me

        Well, thanks for the little bit of help, but im afraid i still dont
        understand. I'm looking for a really basic answer actually, that would
        help me most. When you group something like (246)(683)(367) what does
        that mean. Does that mean to three-cycle corners in position 2, 4, and
        6? then move on to the next group? I just dont get what the groupings
        mean. The example solution on the stiffhands' website is not any help to
        me in this department. For permutating the corners, it doesnt explain
        anything. Here is the permutation sequence it gives: (1357)(2)(48)(6)
        How can i go about solving this? i cant do a four cycle for corners in
        positions 1, 3, 5, and 7... can I? I dont understand how (in the
        example) some stuff, then a 3 corner cycle then the reverse of the
        original stuff can make (1357)(2)(48)(6) turn into (17)(2)(3)(48)(5)
        (6). Can anyone help me by explaining this? &gt; I'm afraid I don't use
        that method but maybe I can help anyway. &gt; It is possible to do (2 4
        6 8) on a 2x2x2 because you can transpose &gt; corners but if you are
        ultimately after 3x3x3 (or higher) then &gt; you'll need to be able to
        do it another way. &gt; Reading from left to right (permutations are
        often read right to &gt; left in mathematics etc.) you get &gt; (2 4 6
        8)(3 7)=(2 4 6)(6 8)(3 7)=(2 4 6)(6 8 3)(3 6 7). &gt; Note that (a b)(c
        d)=(a b c)(c a d), if you read from left to right.

        superglue into the screw hole, then tighten the centerpiece as much as I
        wanted. Once the glue sets, the screws fit much more tightly, but still
        come out or go in when you want them too. Fixed my problems 100% (except

        It took me a while to get the hang of this too, but between stiff hands
        and Richard Carr's wonderful PDF document, I finally cracked the
        blindfolded cubing code. Heres how I do it: 1. Number the corners. The
        numbering scheme that made the most sense to me was FRU FRD BRU BRD FLU
        FLD BLU BLD 1-8 respectively. 2. Number the edges, I use FU, BU, RU, LU,
        1-4 FR, BR, BL, FL, 5-8, FD, BD RD LD 9-12 I also always start with the
        blue as U and the white as F, makes recongnizing the pieces easier. 3
        Memorize corner orientation as 2 strings of 4 numbers (I started out
        trying to convert these into 2 trinary numbers, but that was more
        trouble than help.) I memorize how many clockwise twists they each need
        and asign a number 0-2 to them (straight from richard's document) and
        use his algorithm to orient them. 4 Memorize the orientation of the
        corners, that is whichever corners can be put into their correct place
        using only FBUD R2 L2 moves, 0 means no flip 1 means flip. I memorize as
        3 4-bit strings (tried converting these to 3 binary numbers, more
        trouble than its worth). Use a simple algorithm to flip them. 5 memorize
        permutation of corners, this is where you're having trouble. I start
        with the piece in position 1 (fru) and say where does this piece need to
        go? If that piece happens to be the piece that goes in the BRU position,
        I then move to 3, the sequence becomes (1, 3... then I look at the piece
        in position 3 and say where does that need to go? lets say it needs to
        go to position 5 (FLU), the sequence becomes (1,3,5...) now lets say
        piece 5 needs to go to position 1... I'm back where I started so the
        sequence is (1,3,5) that means piece in position 1 needs to go to
        position 3, piece in position 3 needs to go to position 5, piece in
        position 5 needs to go to position 1, then that sequence is done. A
        3-cycle is nice, but it usually doesn't work out very well, usually you
        get something like: (1,5,6,7)(3,4,8)(2) this means
        1-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;1, 3-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;3, 2 is correct. this
        permutation has a problem: it's odd (4-1)+(3-1)+(1-1) =5), meaning no
        amount of 3 cycles will get it correct. So I use an algorithm that
        switches 2 corners and 2 edges in these cases, corner 3 becomes corner 5
        becomes corner 3 and edge 1 becomes edge 4 becomes edge 1. this makes
        the edge permutation (1,5,4,8,3,6,7)(2) which fixes the permutation so
        that it's even (7-1)+(1-1)=6. 6. memorize edge permutations, taking into
        account swapped edges if necessary. This is done in exactly the same way
        as the corner pieces, only if your corners are even, you're guaranteed
        that the edge permutations are even. if you end up with a cycle that
        isn't a the swap, then you can do what was mentioned earlier about the
        equivalence thingy (don't know the technical term) That is if you had
        (1,2,3,4)(5,6) you couldn't three cycle your way out of it. You'd have
        to do (1,2,3)(1,4,5)(1,6,5). And thats how I memorize it. Then solving
        it is easy: Fix the corner orientation using richard's algorithm, lacing
        the corners they need to be using any moves necessary, flipping them,
        then reverse your moves. Fix the edge orientation placing the edges
        where they need to be using any moves necessary, flipping them, then
        reverse your moves. Apply the parity fixing algorithm if necessary.
        Place the corners by moving them to the locations that the algorithm
        operates using ONLY F2 B2 R2 L2 D U moves, apply the algorithm, reverse
        your moves Place the edges by moving them to the locations that the
        algorithm operates on using ONLY F B R2 L2 U D moves, apply the
        algorithm, reverse your moves. Open your eyes and pray. That's how I do
        it, sorry if the post is long winded, but I'm bored and had nothing
        better to do! Hope it helps at least a little. Daniel

        I hope this helps &gt; When you group something like (246)(683)(367)
        &gt; what does that mean. &gt; &gt; Does that mean to three-cycle
        corners in position 2, 4, and 6? then &gt; move on to the next group?
        You are correct. The first part (246) means that you should do a cycle
        of the three edges in the positions 2, 4, and 6. (just make sure you do
        it in the right direction, so you aren't solving '(264)'
        instead.....this is the idea of 'clockwise' versus 'counterclockwise')
        Then I would move on to (683) and do that one... &gt; Here is the
        permutation sequence it gives: &gt; &gt; &gt; (1357)(2)(48)(6) &gt; &gt;
        How can i go about solving this? i cant do a four cycle for corners &gt;
        in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7... can I? IF you did know a four cycle of
        those fours corners then that would be the optimal thing to do. But it's
        more difficult to arrange 4 corners at once in order to use an
        appropriate algorithm that you know to cycle these 4 corners. And that's
        why it's useful to break the larger cycles (length 4 or higher) up into
        3-cycles (which is what I think you are having trouble with) because
        then you have less pieces to move into place before you do the
        algorithm, and you'll possibly have less algorithms to memorize too. So
        with (1357)(2)(48)(6), notice that the corners labeled 2 and 6 are
        already in their correct places....so how do we take care of the rest? I
        suggest (and I belive this is what Stiff_Hands does) that you look at
        the first three numbers that appear and apply that permutation...that is
        (135). Why? you might ask. because that'll correct that last two corners
        of this 3-cycle you are applying (the corners labeled 3 and 5 in this
        case...if you'd like more eveidence that this'll work I suggest trying
        it a few times, or you could simulate it by following numbers around on
        a piece of paper). So now with 3 and 5 correct, remove them from the
        sequence so we have (17)(2) (48)(6). To proceed from here I would try to
        use an algorithm that swaps two pairs at once and use this on the two
        pairs that are left...that is, (17) and (48). So the general idea with a
        long permution, say (12345678), is to break it up into steps by
        performing the permutation that correctly affects the first three
        numbers, remove the last two numbers of these three, and repeat as
        necessary until all pieces of this cylce are placed or you end up with a
        single swap. So with (123456789) I'd do (123) first, then I'll be left
        with (1456789), then I'd follow up with (145), so I'll be left with
        (16789), then I'd perform a (167) so all that's left is (189)... and
        then I'd do the (189) to finish it off. does that make sense? So we've
        broken the large permutations down into smaller 3-cycles, but how does
        one perform any random 3-cycle? (without having to memorize an algorithm
        for every case). You can do this by just memorizing one algorithm (say
        you know (143)....which, you may have noticed, is also (431) and (314))
        and then use this along with the 'stuff' and 'stuff inverse' that
        Stiff_Hands suggests. How? Well, say you want to do the 3-cycle (476).
        First I would perform a sequence S, which I would just make up on the
        fly, that takes the corner 7 to the spot labeled 3, and the corner 6 to
        the spot labeled 1, and keeps corner 4 fixed (along with preserving the
        orientation of these three corners, these are the only restrictions I
        place on this sequence S that I make up...it can mess everything else
        up!). Then I perform the 3-cycle algorithm I know, (431), which is now
        really operating on the corners 4,7, and 6 because they're in those
        places. And then I perform S' (which fixes everything else we might've
        messed while performing S, and brings the corners back to their new
        respective spots). I really hope that helps. Happy blindfolding, Jake E.

      <div class="email-content">
        Well after some MORE procrastination (and I was busy with school work),
        I finally have everything set up for my first cube club meeting here on
        the University of Michigan campus. I didn't go all out and over
        advertise like I was going to. Just going to limit it to primarily my
        building (&gt;1,000 students) and see how it goes. Took me long enough
        to do flyers, prepare handouts, get decent lecture material, reserve a
        room, and make a professional looking sign-up sheet. I am expecting
        anywhere from 20 to 100 students to show up. (It's a 12,000 student
        campus, anything half-dececently advertisd will draw a crowd.) Set it up
        for Sunday afternoon. It'll just be an hour long (students here are way
        too busy, esp. in my dorm which houses the honors students), though I
        did reserve the place for 3 hrs just to be safe. So I need
        suggestions!!!! Lots of suggestions. I have a beginners method outlined,
        and should have some decent stuff to talk about, with a dozen members
        already semi-involved to hold authority. Going to provide breverages and
        perhaps food (need $ for that one though), and I just incase: techno
        music :). Of course I'll have about 20 puzzles lying around for people
        to tinker with including &gt;10 backup 3x3 cubes incase people show up
        cube-less :). This is more of a pre-meeting since this semester is
        ending fast and the really big meeting should be in the beginning of
        winter term. That's probably why I decided to restrict it to my building
        mostly. (Still anouncing it as a *mass-meeting* to draw people in and
        hopefully recurit people to help me in preping subsequent meetings.) It
        may sound like I'm well prepared for this, but I am still a bit unsure
        of it all. Since this fourm is a bit dry lately, I think this is the
        perfect time to liven it up. Please, any suggestions are welcome! (Might
        have to plan for too little or too many students showing up.) Hopefully,
        it's nothing like: "you should prepare a powerpoint presentation"
        (uhh... headaches from last year :)). -Doug Li (off to thrusday math
        club...) p.s. I'll try hard to avoid speedsolving myself; I've been
        warned that I intimadate more people away that way, lol. "So that was
        about 18s, YOUR TURN!" I have enough helpers I taught to preform
        sub-2min solves that should be impressive enough.

        enough practice, and gives a goal to shoot for. explain that you aren't
        doing it for intimidation purposes, but like i said, just as a goal to
        shoot for. along the lines of explanation, you should let them know what
        they're getting themselves into. let them know that within a few days
        they will be able to solve the cube without any notes. this piece of
        knowledge really surprises people, and gives them more of a short term
        goal that is more acheivable to the general public than sub-20. also
        tell them that if they are willing to put in the time and effort, itll
        take a year or so to get really fast. give them your "cube testimony".
        you said you already have a beginners solution ready. just make sure you
        tell them the difference between solving one color vs. solving one
        layer. also, don't neglect to mention that the centers don't move, no
        matter how hard you try. be prepared to explain things in multiple ways,
        not just saying the same thing over and over again. this is one of the
        hardest things about teaching. hope this helps. -Chris Parlette p.s.

        Hey, guys, thanks a lot for all of the informative responses. While I
        was reading them, something just clicked, (obviously with the help of
        your responses) and i really understand the permutations now, althogh
        not fully. Im sure i just need to practice doing it with my eyes open,
        and i expect to be able to blindfold 2x2 in a few days. This is turning
        out to be much more complicated than I imagined. I mean, the
        orientations are straight forward, and easy, but the permutation of the
        corners... much more confusing, but you guys have now given me the
        confidence that with some practice, im going to do this in a few days.
        (I hope the edges aren't too complicated... id like to learn 3x3 bf
        eventually... Thanks for everything, and I'll post back if I have some
        questions in the next few days. Thanks again, Ferret

        My suggestion would be to spend as much of your time there as you
        possibly can in teaching people personally how to solve the cube using
        the beginners method you have outlined. It is very hard to teach several
        people at once so I recommend teaching one or two people how to do it,
        then letting them move on to show other people and then continue on
        yourself. Since you already have people that are helping you who know
        how to solve it, then this shouldn't be a problem. When I had my cube
        club back in high school I noticed that more people attended when I
        tried as hard as possible to show as many people as possible how to do
        it. Then they would spread the word to others that it was not only
        possible, but not that hard to learn. Then more people started coming.

        Hi Doug, Suppose you have 16 people and eight cubes. Have them all
        solved and give one cube to each pair of people. (After you pair them
        up, of course.) Have one person take the cube turn around and make one
        move, Turn back and hand the cube to his or her partner to undo.
        Generally once solved, in the same number of moves (or less), then it's
        the partner's turn. After one turn is made and solved successfully by
        each person in a pair, two turns are made, then three etc. Give each
        person maybe three tries for each "turn." Whoever goes the furthest
        (number of turns away from solved) wins and plays the winner of another
        pair, for a second round. Etcetera and so forth until there is a single
        winner. David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        That's a great suggestion for the regular meetings... but I think I'll
        have enough cubes in my collection to spread around... And I have
        already recuruited several people to help out that can solve the cube. I

        &gt; &gt; me long enough to do flyers, prepare handouts, get decent
        lecture &gt; &gt; material, reserve a room, and make a professional
        looking sign- up &gt; &gt; sheet. I am expecting anywhere from 20 to 100
        students to show up. &gt; &gt; (It's a 12,000 student campus, anything
        half-dececently advertisd &gt; &gt; will draw a crowd.) Set it up for
        Sunday afternoon. It'll just be an &gt; &gt; hour long (students here
        are way too busy, esp. in my dorm which &gt; &gt; houses the honors
        students), though I did reserve the place for 3 &gt; &gt; hrs just to be
        safe. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I need suggestions!!!! Lots of suggestions.
        I have a beginners &gt; &gt; method outlined, and should have some
        decent stuff to talk about, &gt; &gt; with a dozen members already
        semi-involved to hold authority. Going &gt; &gt; to provide breverages
        and perhaps food (need $ for that one though), &gt; &gt; and I just
        incase: techno music :). Of course I'll have about 20 &gt; &gt; puzzles
        lying around for people to tinker with including &gt;10 backup &gt; &gt;
        3x3 cubes incase people show up cube-less :). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
        is more of a pre-meeting since this semester is ending fast and &gt;
        &gt; the really big meeting should be in the beginning of winter term.
        &gt; &gt; That's probably why I decided to restrict it to my building
        mostly. &gt; &gt; (Still anouncing it as a *mass-meeting* to draw people
        in and &gt; &gt; hopefully recurit people to help me in preping
        subsequent meetings.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It may sound like I'm well
        prepared for this, but I am still a bit &gt; &gt; unsure of it all.
        Since this fourm is a bit dry lately, I think this &gt; &gt; is the
        perfect time to liven it up. Please, any suggestions are &gt; &gt;
        welcome! (Might have to plan for too little or too many students &gt;
        &gt; showing up.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully, it's nothing like: "you
        should prepare a powerpoint &gt; &gt; presentation" (uhh... headaches
        from last year :)). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug Li (off to thrusday math
        club...) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p.s. I'll try hard to avoid speedsolving
        myself; I've been warned &gt; &gt; that I intimadate more people away
        that way, lol. "So that was about &gt; &gt; 18s, YOUR TURN!" I have
        enough helpers I taught to preform sub- 2min &gt; &gt; solves that
        should be impressive enough.

        Hey, my name's Tyler Biggs, I'm 18, and a senior at high school in Iowa.
        I started a cube club shortly after school started this year, and also
        shortly after I began cubing, and have taught about 20 people so far.
        I've begun construction on a site devoted to cubing, and by the end of
        this semester, I plan to have it completed. I haven't been cubing
        terribly long, and am by no means an expert, as many of you may be, but
        I'm learning fast, and suspect I'll be averaging sub-30 within a week or
        so. I think I'll start posting on this site regularly, and hope to meet
        many of you that I've been reading about for the past months. And now,
        to the person who asked how to get started on the Fridrich method: I've
        been cubing for about 3 and a half months now, and fully learned the
        Fridrich method several weeks ago, so I'll tell you how I would
        recommend going about it. I learned all my method via Dan Harris's site,
        and I recommend it very much for an easy start to it. Begin by learning
        2 algorithms for orienting edges (opposite edges and adjacent edges with
        finger tricks. Then learn the 7 algorithms for orienting corners, with
        finger tricks again. These 9 algorithms will be enough for orientation,
        until you want to sit down and learn the other 48 or so that are
        necessary for a 2-look last layer. Next, devote a week or so to learning
        permutations, and their mirrors, which come to 21 algorithms. After
        learning all this, you'll have what they call a 3-look last layer, which
        is only about 2 seconds less efficient than a 2-look. Next, I'd
        recommend learning the F2L with cross on the bottom. It takes a little
        while to get used to these, but you must understand that, nearly every
        time, you're just putting the edge-corner pair in one of two positions,
        then 3 moves to put it in its place. These can very easily be learned
        from Peter Jansen's site, as well, but for useful videos, and getting
        started, try Dan Harris's. After getting a good handle of the F2L, go
        back and learn the other orientations, but this is not terribly
        important. Only 100 days after picking up a cube, I'm down to about a 31
        second average, and have gotten low 20's a few times, and from what I
        hear, this is impressive for the amount of time I've been cubing,
        especially for learning it all from the internet, no people. So good
        luck, and I hope you get around to learning the entire method.

        Ah yes, Tyler presented an excellent course of action. I was just gona
        say that, to start with, it is generally more efficent to swap your last
        two steps, orient edges then permute them. This will also be a first
        step towards OLL/PLL. This will force you to learn 3 simple PLLs (if you
        don't know them already) and 3 OLLs (you probably won't know any of
        these, I'm talking about the optimal OLLs, not the lengthier OE step you
        would have usually ended with.) That should be enough to work on for one
        week. Then you should force yourself to do corner twisting as your first
        step in the LL. gradually learn the other 10 PLLs (I suggest starting
        with the F and Y perms). Then you can adjust to a 3 look LL. After that,
        or even before, the F2L should be the priority. -Doug --- In

        Hi Doug, how's life? I just want to remind you that you have a tendency
        to sound 'academic' (which might not be so weird for an academic...) I
        have been teaching programming for five years, so here is my humble
        note. If you intend to explain exactly what the cube is, I'd like to
        advise you to not throw in TLA's (Three Letter Abreviations) without
        properly introducing them first. So don't drop OLL, PLL, F2L, after at
        least fifteen minutes of fun and explanation. Know you audience. 1)If
        they are all math students, great, you can talk about permutations. If
        not, you'd have a hard time even explaining what a permutation is, and I
        prefer calling it 'swapping', or 'rotating', or even 'trading places'
        (yes, pun...). 2)If you know some personally, and some not, do NOT treat
        them differently. Act as if everyone is new to you, so the people who
        don't know you won't feel like they're not with the in-crowd, and should
        shut up. 3)Improvise depending on the number of people. With ten to
        twenty people you have a group, easily following you in any suggestion.
        With 100 people you have a crowd, with its own will. In the latter case,
        you probably won't have 100 cubes and you might want to lose the 'try it
        yourself' option. In that case, have the last part of your session
        available for a walk around 'looking at puzzles'. - Try to not stand
        there and have a 'talk' as if you are the president making a statement.
        Let people participate, either with or without a cube. Ask a lot of
        questions. If everyone is real quiet, it could mean they don't
        understand a word, and are being very polite. - The pairing is a great
        idea, for smaller groups, really. - Make some jokes. The best jokes are
        when you make a fool of yourself. I had the whole group laughing their
        ass off when I completely filled the white board with notes in 3 colors
        using permanent markers. Or when you say: 'You are all here to listen to
        a great lecture from the best math student of this university.
        Unfortunately he couldn't be here, so you'll have to hear it from me.' -
        Never ask 'is that clear to everyone?' What do you expect? For everyone
        to answer 'yes'. And don't try 'Who doesn't get this yet?' (who is the
        dumb ass here?). Just don't ask yes/no questions, and don't give yes/no
        answers. - Breath if you're nervous. If you really don't know an answer
        repeat after me: 'I don't know.' But continue that with: 'I could check
        that for you' and make a note. - Another tip: you could start by
        disassembling and assembling a cube, so people really understand what a
        cube is actually. Have them hold the core in their hands... - You will
        have to establish credibility. But: saying that you were in the Rubiks
        Cube World Championship is already enough. And better than to say that
        you are very intelligent is to show it. That's a tough one, or what
        Doug? :-D - Don't answer every question in full. Like 'could you outline
        the history of Math and how group theory really works. Oh and also
        what's the solution to all permutation puzzles?' Just be aware of time
        limits, and concentration limits. Apologize for not having the time to
        explain everything, but if you are a pretty girl or get me a new car,
        I'd be happy to explain it later privately. - have your 'students' tell
        their story. That will also be less intimidating and make your show more
        lively. - Maybe you could look up the message I posted a while ago about
        Yasmara's progress. I wrote down her method, that uses only four
        algorithms. In a nutshell: 1.FL'U'LUF' to orient edges, 2.use the Sune
        (1 or 2 times) to orient corners Sune=RU'R'U'RU2R'. This is just as a
        visual help for the next step. 3.RU'L'UR'U'L to swap 2 corners 4.use the
        Sune to orient corners repeat 3+4 until corner permutation is done 5.use
        the Sune (2 or 4 times) to permute edges. Well enough rambling, I could
        go on for hours, but I won't bore you to death, or you won't be able to
        attend your own meeting. Good luck Michiel --- In

        answers. &gt; &gt; - Breath if you're nervous. If you really don't know
        an answer repeat &gt; after me: 'I don't know.' But continue that with:
        'I could check that &gt; for you' and make a note. &gt; &gt; - Another
        tip: you could start by disassembling and assembling a &gt; cube, so
        people really understand what a cube is actually. Have them &gt; hold
        the core in their hands... &gt; &gt; - You will have to establish
        credibility. But: saying that you were &gt; in the Rubiks Cube World
        Championship is already enough. And better &gt; than to say that you are
        very intelligent is to show it. That's a &gt; tough one, or what Doug?
        :-D &gt; &gt; - Don't answer every question in full. Like 'could you
        outline the &gt; history of Math and how group theory really works. Oh
        and also what's &gt; the solution to all permutation puzzles?' Just be
        aware of time &gt; limits, and concentration limits. Apologize for not
        having the time &gt; to explain everything, but if you are a pretty girl
        or get me a new &gt; car, I'd be happy to explain it later privately.
        &gt; &gt; - have your 'students' tell their story. That will also be
        less &gt; intimidating and make your show more lively. &gt; &gt; - Maybe
        you could look up the message I posted a while ago about &gt; Yasmara's
        progress. I wrote down her method, that uses only four &gt; algorithms.
        In a nutshell: &gt; 1.FL'U'LUF' to orient edges, &gt; 2.use the Sune (1
        or 2 times) to orient corners &gt; Sune=RU'R'U'RU2R'. This is just as a
        visual help for the next step. &gt; 3.RU'L'UR'U'L to swap 2 corners &gt;
        4.use the Sune to orient corners &gt; repeat 3+4 until corner
        permutation is done &gt; 5.use the Sune (2 or 4 times) to permute edges.
        &gt; &gt; Well enough rambling, I could go on for hours, but I won't
        bore you &gt; to death, or you won't be able to attend your own meeting.

        I've been teaching a few more people recently and I'm becoming more

        Hi Louie First the 8 hours is just a indication, when a cube is new I
        wait unitil fine dust appears. When you lube the cube in 1 edge hole
        this works fine when the cube is already broken in for speedcubing, so
        for maintance or to add a bit more lube. However lubing each cubie and
        polish it a bit gives always the best result, especially when a cube
        must break in. I never tried laying them all out and spray, this because
        you spray also the stickers. You better avoid spraying the stickers, the
        cube might become slippery. If you spray each piece you can wipe of the
        lube of the stickers before it is dry. But if you know how to spray them
        laying all out and not spraying the sticker I gues this will work fine.

        There is also Betty tregay, wife af Grant Tregay and mysewlf. :-) Make

        solve it. Since I am a female, I would like to be included among female
        cubers, even if I am not speed cubing. It turns out rhat I am the only
        person in the world who is doing 3d designs. I was the sole exhibitor of

        So if we believe this article it might be your learning method that

        Interesting thoughts Jasmine. I can think of lots of parallels that
        either do or don't support whatever view you care to take. Chess for
        example were there are far more males than females - but then just look
        at Judit Polgar and her sisters (maybe Jessica is the Polgar of
        Cubing!). Mathematics is another interesting area where traditionally
        there are far more males. When doing my PhD I was interested to find out
        from a Portugese student that in Portugal pure mathematics was
        considered a girls subject. And then there is soccer - in England soccer
        is for men and baseball for girls and in the US its the other way about!
        I tend to think that men are more interested but by no means more
        capable. I think more men are "obsessive" too so more likely to realise
        there potential in a discipline such as speedcubing. Way back when I
        taught people how to solve the cube it tended to be more a matter of how
        interested they were in learning that gender. None of the above to be
        taken too seriously. Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From:

        I hadn't really thought of it until just now, but in my cubing career,
        I've personally taught no fewer than 4 Women (and am presently working
        with one more) and I have only personally taught 1 man, and he gave up
        half way through... This appears to be the anomoly, but I find women in
        general are much more curious about the cube. There are 3 guys I see
        weekly that love to watch, but don't want to learn, and there's probably
        10 girls I've run into that asked for a solution. Odd...

        here's what I do: http://grrroux.free.fr/me/me.html I suppose it depends
        on the lubricant you can find, or even the plastic, but when I just
        remove an edge piece and spray in the hole, no matter how much lubricant
        I spray, it never lasts long. I have to repeat this every hour (100
        cubes). If I do as shown on the pictures (waiting for the liquid to dry
        up), every piece is equally lubed, and the cube remains ok for a week.
        Be carful, the stickers may suffer (but mine are very strong, and I
        don't care if they get dirty, they like being washed). Gilles.

        Of the people I've started to teach, there's been roughly equal numbers

        initially more likely to pick up a cube (although perhaps this is true
        anyway). What I really meant is that once they do pick up a cube and
        start learning, guys seem to *understand* it more quickly and more
        easily than girls. Several guys have pretty much learnt the whole cube
        in 2 lessons, whereas the girls seem to struggle with even the first

        Ok, well let me first say welcome! Its always great to have another
        cuber here! Ok, so you are at about two minutes and looking to reduce
        your times. There is a couple of easy things that you can do that speed
        your times a lot faster. 1) Don't turn the cube aruond so quick. When
        you are looking for a piece (like a corner), chances are you can find it
        really quick if you just slow down. That might sound strange, but a lot
        of people turn the cube looking for a piece really frantically, and that
        really does no good to your times. 2) Ok, nobody likes this one, but
        practice. There is no substitute for experience. EVER. Doing the cube
        over and over and over will show you its actual inner simplicity. You'll
        soon learn how a piece in the back is the one you want, and you didn't
        have to go searching to get it! 3) Keep track of your progress. Print
        times you have, or write it on a chart. That way, when you get
        discourage (and notice the word WHEN), you can check and see that you
        have actually made a lot of progress. 4) There are plateaus you will
        reach, and your times will seem stuck at specific time for a while. Just
        keep practicing, its the true answer to anything. 5) Finally, learn the
        algorithms to the last layer. Ouch. That is the hardest obstacle a lot
        of cubers have. Ok, so you don't need to memorize the orientations, but
        the permutations really do help. O yea, and never feel embarrased to ask
        questions! That is the worst thing you could not do, is not ask!

        The Petrus method is hard to get used to. What I did when I started was
        go really slowly, without timing, and see how few moves you can get. If
        you can get less than one hundred moves per solve, then it's easy to get
        sub-minute. Just practice, a lot. --- In

        Hi Everyone, About 1980 I attended classes in adult-ed called "Mind and
        Supermind." I forget the man's name but one speaker went around the
        world interviewing people who had great success - Muhammed Ali, the
        Houston team who put men on the moon in 1969, Olga Korbut, a blind
        marathon runner, and the like. He was able to demonstrate that success
        tended to follow interest primarily, not any "inborn talent". There is
        an old debate concerning "nature versus nurture" in regards to how
        people performe in life. The basic answer is that given the same basic
        talents and equipment that nurture plays a strong role. In New York
        City, several decades ago there was a concerted effort to find good
        homes to orphans from around the world. As many of these were young
        children there was concern about their placement. To make a long story
        short. The tests given the children after a decade showed that
        intelligence scores correlated with their upbringing and not their gene
        pool, and not their sex. It has also been discovered that intelligence
        is not a fixed quantity. Your "IQ" can grow. There is much more to this.

        So, I'd call it a success. Not many people showed up (well I under
        advertised), but it was still great. Found a few new people that I
        didn't know had cubes. The meeting was supposed to be from 3-4, but just
        ended now (at 7, 4 hours later) because people that were walking by just
        kept joining in. I think I was able to teach a bunch of people how to
        solve the F2L using basically one algorithm. Some people I got started
        on the LL and some I got solving the 2-4x4's I brought along. No one but
        me dared to touch the 5x5 though :). Some reason the pyraminx looks
        intimidating to poeple too (not to mention the Megaminx). We ran over,
        and some other group took up the room (all female) that started getting
        into the cube (that is until I showed them a couple solved, one 22s the
        other 20s, that must have intimidated them). But apperently a lot of
        people that were supposed to come were busy today, and some of my
        friends was helping somebody that got into a little basketball accident.
        So the thing is that sometimes I couldn't bring myself down to the level
        of being able to teach someone a certain step or algorithm..., but there
        would be someone there that DID understand that then disseminated the
        information downward (might be adifferent person for each step). So in
        that was people naturally paried up and taught each other stuff... so I
        just went around clearifiying the procedures. I wasn't planning on
        holding another meeting until next semester, but due to demand, I will
        have to do one in 2 weeks (next weekend is Thanksgiving break). And thus
        *really* advertise and do flyers properly, basically through out campus,
        all the bus stops, etc... (Hopefully this time those studnet governemt
        candidates won't post on top of all my stuff :).) The thought of the day
        for me is that "People are naturally curious." Two decades later, the
        cube is still as addictive as ever. Next meeting, the turn out will for
        sure double!!! -Doug Li

        Hi, Stefan, I have not invented a new pizzle, but my 3d designs on
        Rubik's cubes re rather unique, or so I an told. You may see them in,
        for example, in http://www.design.rubikscube.info orin
        http://cube.misto.cz . I too, would like to benefit from 'inventing'
        them. I would appreciate any suggestions. Were you in WC2003? I
        exhibited three of my designs. Hana a kostky --- In

        Hi everyone, I'm a bit curious on how the whole timing procedure for the
        world championships worked. I hear they used the Stackmat Timer used in
        cup stacking. Does that mean competitors start with their hands on the
        two dark circles? When does timing begin? When one/two hands leaves the
        dark circle? When does timing stop? When both hands hit the circles
        again or is putting the Rubik's cube on the pad enough? -Tyson

        first you get to look at the cube for 15 seconds, a judge times that
        with a stopwatch, then you put the cube down. The judge covers the cube
        with their hands so you cant see it. Place your hands one two circles
        and the judge says when to go, and you grab the cube and sovlve. Time

        Sorry about that. I solved the centers, then I got 8 edge triplets out
        of the 12. So I have 4 on the top layer, and 4 on the bottom layer. I
        know a few easy algorithms to do this on the 4x4x4 (put the remining

        centers, then I got 8 edge triplets out of the 12. Okay - that's what I
        thought you meant, but I wanted to be sure, first (rather than confuse
        things). There are a couple different approaches you can take...
        Approach 1 (recommended): Keep all of the edge triplets in the middle
        layer (between U and D). Using the middle edges (the pieces in the
        middle of each edge triplet) as reference points (to line up with the
        outer edges), turn the cube and or the F, B, R, and L faces (half turns)
        so that the upper edge piece on FL, BL, or BR belongs with the middle
        edge on FR, and the lower edge on FR doesn't. Turn U and u (U face and
        the slice behind it) as needed to bring the outer edge piece to FR,
        perform either R F' U R' F (fewer moves) or (R U') (R' U) y' (R' U R)
        (easier, in my opinion), and then reverse the turn to U and u. This is
        actually a 3 cycle of edges. With some practice, you'll see some tricks
        to using this more effectively. If you ever get 2 triplets that have the
        right colors, but the middle edge is flipped, put them in FL and FR, and
        instead of moving Uu, move the middle slice only before and after the
        alg (which has the effect of flipping FR in place). Approach 2: Line up
        two edge triplets that are still mixed up in FL and FR, such that a turn
        of d or u will correctly align a pair. Also, put a still scrambled edge
        triplet on U or D. Note that this approach only gets you down to 2 edge
        triplets remaining - then you finish it off with the first approach.
        Anyways, do the Uu or Dd turn to line up pieces, replace the triplet
        with the mixed triplet on U or D (e.g. R U' R' to replace FR with UF),
        and and reverse the Uu or Dd turn. Be sure only to complete triplets and
        not to tear any apart that are partially complete. The second approach
        is fewer moves and possibly easier to get your mind around, but I think
        it tends to take longer, because your mixed edge triplets are not always
        in set places (in the middle layer). However, the first approach can
        take a bit of getting used to, in order to do it effectively. Let me
        know if any of this is unclear... I could always just write it out plain
        and simple, giving less flexibility, and forcing complete algs on you,
        if you'd like, but I think (hope) this should help enough. - Grant

        It's exactly the same as when you have a seeming parity error (the one
        with the single flipped edge) on a 4x4x4. You can use the exact same
        algorithm you would use in that case on the 4x4x4. I think I use an

        A while ago somebody suggested that in order to make people aware of
        your ability to solve the cube you shouldn't rescramble immediately
        after solving but instead wait a bit so that people have the chance to
        see you did it. Here's an improvement: Solve several puzzles in a row,
        i.e. scramble your cube, your pyraminx and your skewb (or whatever),
        then inspect them, then solve them, measuring the total solving time.
        This way the puzzles will lie around solved for a while and it will even
        look natural. Nobody can say "what's that artificial break? damn
        braggart!". Also, notice that it only gives the *puzzles* a break, not
        yourself, so you don't waste precious practice time ;-) Cheers! Stefan

        sure, &gt; first (rather than confuse things). There are a couple
        different &gt; approaches you can take... &gt; &gt; Approach 1
        (recommended): Keep all of the edge triplets in the middle &gt; layer
        (between U and D). Using the middle edges (the pieces in the &gt; middle
        of each edge triplet) as reference points (to line up with the &gt;
        outer edges), turn the cube and or the F, B, R, and L faces (half &gt;
        turns) so that the upper edge piece on FL, BL, or BR belongs with the
        &gt; middle edge on FR, and the lower edge on FR doesn't. Turn U and u
        (U &gt; face and the slice behind it) as needed to bring the outer edge
        piece &gt; to FR, perform either R F' U R' F (fewer moves) or (R U') (R'
        U) y' &gt; (R' U R) (easier, in my opinion), and then reverse the turn
        to U and &gt; u. This is actually a 3 cycle of edges. With some
        practice, you'll &gt; see some tricks to using this more effectively. If
        you ever get 2 &gt; triplets that have the right colors, but the middle
        edge is flipped, &gt; put them in FL and FR, and instead of moving Uu,
        move the middle &gt; slice only before and after the alg (which has the
        effect of flipping &gt; FR in place). &gt; &gt; Approach 2: Line up two
        edge triplets that are still mixed up in FL &gt; and FR, such that a
        turn of d or u will correctly align a pair. &gt; Also, put a still
        scrambled edge triplet on U or D. Note that this &gt; approach only gets
        you down to 2 edge triplets remaining - then you &gt; finish it off with
        the first approach. Anyways, do the Uu or Dd turn &gt; to line up
        pieces, replace the triplet with the mixed triplet on U or &gt; D (e.g.
        R U' R' to replace FR with UF), and and reverse the Uu or Dd &gt; turn.
        Be sure only to complete triplets and not to tear any apart &gt; that
        are partially complete. &gt; &gt; The second approach is fewer moves and
        possibly easier to get your &gt; mind around, but I think it tends to
        take longer, because your mixed &gt; edge triplets are not always in set
        places (in the middle layer). &gt; However, the first approach can take
        a bit of getting used to, in &gt; order to do it effectively. Let me
        know if any of this is unclear... &gt; I could always just write it out
        plain and simple, giving less &gt; flexibility, and forcing complete
        algs on you, if you'd like, but I &gt; think (hope) this should help
        enough. &gt; &gt; - Grant

        have too many moves moves for almost all of the problems. What you have
        there seems to me to be unnecessarily difficult. For example, rotating
        corners are 11 moves at the most. Even using one alg twice it's 14
        moves. Sorry for the criticism, but that page is scary, and I think it

        This is sort of my recap for being gone a little bit The Gender Issue:
        im new to cubing so never tought anyone, but i do know that guys are a
        lot more obsessive and compulsive. take me for example, i seen jessica's
        site from a link off slashdot, seen her do it in 15 seconds and bought
        one 2 days later, never touching one before then sense i was like maybe
        10 (20yo now). I could easily seeing the girl questioning the cube for
        the soul purpose of being interested in the guy. Lubing: someone sent me
        a response telling me how to tear apart my cube to lube it, but i for
        the life of me cant figure out what they were talking about. could
        someone possible like go into high detail, draw a diagram, make a video
        :-/ of how im suppose to do this :), ive had my cube for like a week and
        it sounds like stuff is scrambling around inside like some little peice
        broke off or something, so i dont want to touch it until i get it
        lubed.... Thanks in advance Lars Petrus: I found your site after reading
        some of jessica's site and really found the F2L approach sort of
        confusing and always needed help with the second layer (used the hint
        book that came with it), after i found your site and tried it your way
        (2x2, 2x2x3, 2x1, 2x3x3) i found getting the first 2 layers very easy
        and didnt need help with it at all (took me an hour the first time but i
        got it :) If i was ever to teach someone how to cube i would show them
        your method before any other way, thanks a lot for the site and all the

        Hi, Ton, Yes, do make that picture and put it here! If you receive 100
        Studio cubes, then add anorher layer of 6x6 cubes on the borrom, using
        91 cubes in their containers (55+36=91). You couldn't do that for your

        speedcube. I do it differenrly and much more slowly. My book tells you
        how I do it. But my way, alrgough slow, is legal. That is, I would never
        peel the stickers off manually and rearreange them manually to creatre a
        patrtern. It is to rhe credit of this group that no one have accused me
        of doing that, no matter how 'humorous' some members are. And to the

        cybe art! WQhat I have done us to originate three dimensional multi-cube
        art, but not whole cube art! There are other trends that I did not

        &gt; &gt; I made the picture after checking a shipment of 60 mint sealed
        &gt; &gt; Rubik's Arxon 1980 versions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thsi stock is
        for collectors and for speedcubing. Still it will &gt; leave &gt; &gt;
        them sealed else they are no longer collectible items. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Next week I will receive 100 Studio Cubes. Maybe I make a picture
        &gt; of &gt; &gt; this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe a nice demo event for
        the future, speedcube three fixed cube &gt; &gt; patterns of 8 cubes. I
        gues I can do this within 3 minutes. Can &gt; you &gt; &gt; do any
        speedcubing for a fixed pattern? You can learn each fixed &gt; &gt;
        pattern in at most 26 turns. How fast can you do 26 moves? &gt; Are you
        sure about this? &gt; Hmmm I gues I did not write the rules I assumed to
        start with 8 solved cubes, any fixed pretty pattern can be made in 26
        moves. So you have to learn many fixed pretty pattern, but this is not
        that hard. So for 8 cubes, 180 seconds/8 = 22.5 seconds per cube with 26
        turns.I gues any one should be able to do this. The idea was just a demo
        event to combine pretty patterns and speedcubing. So to makes thinks not
        to difficult you can start with 8 solved cubes. Ton

        Great idea, Michael! You can ask Mirek Gorjan to find the fewest moves
        for each pretty pattern, and twiddle and stack away. But be careful!

        I just got a new best personal time for a 3x3x3 single solve and I
        wanted to get people's opinion of whether it was lucky or not. Here's my
        situation... I've been slowly learning PLL algs and I know a few OLL
        algs. When I do the LL, I use anything from 2 looks to 4 looks, most
        often 3-looks. I just did a solve with a 2-look LL and it was a personal
        best. My reasons for thinking it might be a lucky solve is because most
        of the time I do the LL in 3-looks. My reason for thinking that it
        wasn't lucky is because there are a few OLL situations that I know which
        means when they come up I can orient the whole LL in 1 alg instead of 2.
        My feeling is that it wasn't a 'lucky' solve because the 2-look LL was
        only possible because I had learnt the OLL alg for that particular OLL
        case. What do people think? Jasmine.

        No way, I don't think it is lucky at all. Just like some algorithms take
        longer than others, if you happen to come across one that is 6 instead
        of 8 moves, that isn't skipping a step, and it isn't considered lucky at
        all. Also according to Jess Fridrich you have to skip more than one step
        of your solution for it to be a lucky case. Yours definitely sounds good

        Hey Jasmine :-) I agree with all the other replies. Sometimes skipping
        one algorithm in ur overall method can't be considered lucky. Even
        skipping 2 is sometimes not lucky. It all depends on how many
        steps/algorithms that overall method consists of. In my opinion there
        are only poor "scramblings" ;-) In my experience u are bound to get
        "lucky" quite often when the scarmbling was done with only 14-15 moves.
        Proper scrambling should be above 20 moves :-) &gt;From 29.8 secs there
        is still a long way to go sub 20 secs. And especially so if u are hoping
        to AVERAGE below 20. I think sometimes there is far too much focus on
        fingertricks and learning heaps of algs for one or more particular
        steps. I often average sub 30 secs on average even with a 4LL method.
        It's all about "keeping the flow" as u solve the cube. Performing 3 algs
        can be just as fast as : "1 sec to recognize alg 1 + time to perform alg
        1 + 1 sec to recognize alg 2 + time to perform alg 2". This is what i
        mean by flow. You have to minimize the time between each algorithm u
        perform. Myself i'm not willing to learn all those algs for a 2LL
        method. I feel happy averaging below 30 with a 4LL, and 99.99% of all
        ppl are amazed by such speeds anyway;-) And i been using the same method
        of solving the cube for 20+ yrs!! Hard to change old habits :-o Nowadays
        i'm more into supercubing, esp minimizing the number of moves to solve
        it. This is very rewarding since i dunno anyone else who is also doing
        that. So far i have manage to average about 52 moves for supercubing,
        which is only 10 moves more than the best guys do for normal solving. Is
        is more rewarding to plan ur moves carefully than to just "mechanically"
        reproduce all those algs u learnt in order to do a fast normal solve;-)
        Anyway ppl still are keen on doing the cube for many different and
        personal reasons. I have been cubing also all those yrs from 1985 to
        2000 of "official global non-cubing" ... hehe :D Good luck in achieving
        25 ... 20 ... :-) &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        8 moves, that isn't skipping a step, and it isn't &gt; &gt; considered

        Congratulations Jamine! It seems to me that as you learn more and more
        of the OLL algorithms this sort of time will become more of an average -
        so its not lucky just a peek into the future! Having said that I agree
        with per kristen fredlund - its the flow that counts. I know I use
        better algorithms and fewer moves to solve now than I did when i stopped
        cubing 20 years ago but I am still quite a bit slower and I think i will
        be for a few more months until it starts to feel more natural. Duncan

        I was at my parent's house last tonight and we were flipping through
        some channels. None of us were paying close attention but all of a
        sudden my cubedar went off and I shouted "GO BACK!!!" My step father had
        flitted across the Cartoon Network and I appearantly noticed a character
        who looked strikingly similar to "Rubik the amazing Cube" whom I've only
        seen in still pictures. I was wondering what on earth the old 80's
        cartoon was doing on the cartoon network! I proceeded to force the
        family to watch a few minutes of the show during which several people
        (and a robot) solved rubik's revenges. To say the least my curiosity was
        piqued. I have since discovered that the cartoon show was actually
        "whatever Happened to Robot Jones," a show which I have never heard of.
        It did in fact feature a character "Cubik the amazing Rube." but only in
        the one episode. Season 1, Episode 3 "Cube Wars". The only information I
        have found on it so far is here:
        http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/GuidePageServlet/showid-
        11350/epid-169139/ But I'll keep looking. I'd like to see the complete
        episode at some point. Thought you all might be interested!

        Hello, I can answer partially to the square-1 question. The square-1 is
        originally Czech invention (Hrsel &amp; Kopsky physicians) and went into
        production in Czech Republic few years ago in really good quality with
        really good plastic stickers (compared to the paper-based stickers of
        other square-1 products) and the name of this puzzle is "Cube 21" (not
        square-1, but that is the only difference). There are two variations of
        "Cube 21": 6 color and 2 color (one is silver). And the best thing is
        the price: 200,-CZK ~ $7.4 (I think it could be more for international
        sales...) The worst thing would be the postage prices - I do not have
        experience with it. Have a look at:

        Hey Louie, I don't have an extra centre piece, but I did experience the
        same problem (I guess all 4x4-cubers did). First I tried superglue,
        which didn't work long. I did however fix my broken centre piece
        succesfully:, the idea is to add some stability to the glued part by
        having a small piece of a paperclip melted in the pieces. When I tried
        this first I attempted to push them in the plastic but it was too hard.
        Making the paperclip hot with a lighter and then creating the hole in
        the piece worked for me. Do it for both pieces, make sure the holes
        connect. Cut a small bit (4 millimeter) of the paperclip, put it in one
        of the pieces, apply superglue and put the other piece on the other end
        of the paperclip. http://members.home.nl/heltzel/4x4-centre.gif Actually
        I'm not sure if there might be better method (replacing the piece...
        d'oh). If you don't succeed, make sure: - The surfaces you're glueing
        together fit, otherwise sand them so they fit. - The paperclip piece
        shouldn't be too long because then it would do the opposite (push the
        pieces away from each other. I hope there are other solutions as well,
        'cause this is pretty hard. Greets, Koen Heltzel

        center piece... (also blue, like the other guy's). The last time I tried
        to repair it, I ended up having to use layers and layers of superglue
        with drying time in between and then sanding off the excess. Perhaps
        adding 1 or 2 metal connectors will help strengthen the joint and even
        make it stronger then before. I wonder how long it will take for these
        companies to start making very high quality cubes for us. But then
        again, we'd be so spoiled and have to pay a fortune for them... but
        they'd last a lifetime. Just a survey though... (question for both Louie
        and Koen:) What brand of Rev is it that you have had to repair? I have
        both a rubiks.com one and Meffert's brand. Some how it seems that the
        rubiks.com ones are more durable (though my Meffert's one turns better),
        and the Meffert's one breaks much more often. I think the solutions will
        probably be to aquire a mini-4x4/Eastsheen that are much lighter and
        durable than both of mine. -Doug --- In

        piece shouldn't be too long because then it would do the &gt; opposite

        I've just taken up speedcubing (or more accurately, cubing in general)
        about two months ago and was wondering where I can find a good Rubik's
        Revenge cube. I know I can get them from Meffert's and Hessport's
        Rubik's shop online, but I wanted to see what other people say about
        them before I drop $25+ on one, especially if quality is a major issue
        among different manufacturers (Hessport's Rubik's shop says that 4x4x4's
        and 5x5x5's are inherently less durable than 3x3x3's). Thanks. Doug On

        I used the Hesseport version and the Eastsheen version (the mini one
        from mefferts). The hesseport one broke more times than I can count in
        the manner described here. The Eastsheen is very loose though, and seems
        pretty sturdy, though it's not very open to misaligned turning. I'll
        probably get an eastsheen 5x5 sometime soon.

        similar idea about pants as me - pants must have pockets big enough to
        hold at least one cube, or they are not worth buying... Well, on that
        note... I have to say I'm quite happy with my new pants! They're cargo
        pants with a pocket on each leg big enough that, aside from the weight
        of the puzzles knocking around my knees, I could probably carry around
        one of each size cube (2x2 - 5x5), my megaminx (of course), and another
        couple of puzzles all at once, just for fun. The pockets are wide enough
        that I could probably even fit two of the larger 5x5x5 cubes
        side-by-side without difficulty... Also, they are at least 2 puzzle-rows
        deep, if not 3!! :-D - Grant

        I have pants with pockets for a cube, two decks of cards, and several
        coins. Some pants, though, are cargo pants that can hold nearly all my
        cubes (eleven) and nearly half of my decks of cards (ten or twenty) and

        I hate to be redundant in the case that this question has been asked
        here before, but would like to know of a good way to solve the last
        layer. I have seens solutions that require the memorization of over 53
        algorithims, which is not my style. Others have previous requirements of
        the third layer's state. If the layer by layer tack is a bad one, I
        wonder if any of you could be so kind as to point me towards a better
        algorithm, because the one I currently use is pretty slow and requires
        too many moves. The one I use now doesn't involve the second layer, but
        uses algorithms to solve the bottom, which require too many moves, and
        then solves the middle. Thanks, I hope you guys can help me.

        First, learn to do a standard four look last layer if you still aren't
        there yet. Orient corners in one alg, orient edges in one alg, permute
        corners in one alg, and permute edges in one alg. Or some combination of
        those. Then once you can do that, learn the permutation algs to get to a
        three look LL. Eventually you might want to go to the 2-look, but for
        now aim for four. Then three. --- In

        I'm just curious are you going to speed cube or are you just looking for
        a easyer solution? I think we've been forcing speed cubing on people
        latly that are just looking for an easy solution. I used a sulotion that
        only required 5 algorithms for the ll since the f2l can be intuitive or
        easily learned. With those algs and a few other that i develop with
        those and like 2 from the fridrich methods i could average 45 secs. I
        dont have the time to make a soulution page or anything since i can only
        get on a few times a week and even then its not for long but i maybe
        able to draw somthing up at home and get it on line some how i think its
        a lot easyer that what ive seen so far in my opinion but thats just me.

        sequences are: 1. Move corners around: R U' L' U R' U' L 2. Rotate
        corners: R U R' U R U2 R 3. Move edges around: F2 U r U2 r' U F2 4. Flip
        over two edges: r U r' U2 r U r' Lower case letter "r" stands for the
        middle slice next to the side indicated by the upper case letter "R,"
        moved in the same direction. 2. 3. and 4. you might need to apply more
        than once. I agree with Per Kristen Fredlund that you can beat 30
        seconds with just four algorithms. David J

        Pretty slow ;) but most of it is my F2L method, which I have been

        is what I do: 1. Make a cross on top 2. Fill in top corners 3. Fill in
        edges I hear most people either use a different method (Petrus?) or

        It is possible to average under 30 seconds with a 4-look LL. But it's
        obviously easier with a 3 or 2-look. But if the problem is in the F2L,
        that's something different. The problem with your method is that once
        the first layer is done, there is nothing more that you can do without
        messing up what you've already done. The most popular F2L methods are
        the Fridrich and the Petrus. Fridrich is most popular, though, so it's
        probably easier. I use Petrus. --- In

        I don't think that F2L is that slow. You can easily get under 45 seconds
        with it. Especially if you dont worry whether all the corners go in

        Hi Doug, You asked for another method. I don't have a website so I might
        as well publish it here. I guess I need to call it the Salvia method.
        Here's the F2L portion. First 2 Levels: 1. Place two edge pieces, i.e.
        one across-the-center-of-one-side pair, on the middle level, like RF and
        LF (right front and left front) 2. Place four corners on the first
        level, (on top) 3. Place the other two edges on the middle level, 4.
        place the four edges of the first level; (first level now on bottom)
        Some detail: 1. Place two edge pieces, i.e. one across-the-center pair,
        on the middle level, like RF and LF (right front and left front)
        Beginning with an average scramble where no edge pieces are in place,
        these can usually be placed at the same time in 3 or 4 moves, rarely 5.
        2. Place four corners on the first level. (The first level in on top)
        Hold these two edge pieces (and the opposing centers they are next to)
        with the thumb and middle finger (I use my left hand) and feed in (on
        top) the four corners of the first level. These can sometimes be done
        two at a time. Varies greatly - 6 moves is common, so is 11 moves. If I
        switch my left hand position I need to keep track of where the two
        in-place edge pieces are. 3. Place the other two edges on the middle
        level. These can usually be placed at the same time in about 7 or 8
        moves. On occasion, where a few moves will place the first four corners,
        there is the option of doing step 2 first, that is: four corners first,
        then the four middle edge pieces. This can be very fast. 4. place the
        four edges of the first level. Often the first level is now on the
        bottom. I think there may be 1 chance in 4 that one first-level edge
        piece is already in place correctly. This placement can usually be done
        two pieces at a time, i.e. one across -the -center pair at a time. To
        flip over one edge piece in place takes 7 moves. To flip over two edge
        pieces takes 8 moves. (I count a slice as one move) I can ususally turn
        over two LL [last level] edge pieces while placing the last two first
        level edge pieces. David J Salvia --- In

        up? Yes, with a minor correction on #2 - the last R should be R', so it
        should read : 2. Rotate corners: R U R' U R U2 R' Also, #3 and #4 will
        probably have to be intermixed a bit. #4 flips two adjacent edges - if
        none are adjacent, you will need to use #3 first to put them next to
        each other. Also, once all edges are flipped, you still need to move
        them around. The order in which to use these algs would be as follows
        (assuming no luck - e.g. all edges already oriented): A) Apply #1 once
        (adjacent pair swap) or twice (diagonal/two pair swap) B) Apply #2 once
        (rotate 3 clockwise), twice (rotate 3 cc or 2 each way) or 3 times
        (rotate 1 each way) C) Apply #3 if necessary (Only 2 edges need to flip
        and are opposite) D) Apply #4 once (to flip 2 edges) or twice (to flip 4
        edges) E) Apply #3 once (to permute 3 edges clockwise) or twice (all
        other cases) Also, if you learn to do #2 both forward (as stated) and
        backwards (R U2 R' U' R U' R'), you can always orient corners with 1 or
        2 algs (instead of sometimes 3). Perhaps you didn't need/want this level
        of detail, but here it is anyways :-P Hope it helps! - Grant

        is anyways :-P Hope it helps! &gt; &gt; - Grant I t does. Thanks.
        However, if you want to rotate two opposite corners, then you can use
        the "rube move" instead of 3,4,3. The rube move was (partially?)
        developed by Rubik himself and is thus: r U r U r U2 r' U r' U r' U2
        Hold the cube so that both are on top, one in the front, and one in the
        back. r is also interchangeable with r', as long as each instance is
        switched, of course. I like this move a lot. It was pretty easy to
        learn, so therefore was the first I remember memorizing from an outside
        source. Oh, by the way, in #1- 4, which are the cubes that are
        permutated/ orientated in relation to how one holds it?

        Hi Grant, Thanks for catching my goofs. :) Concerning the two piece flip
        over. I thought I'd give a simple sequence that he'd have to think about
        a little, rather than a more complex all-purpose one like: Do R' u R2 u2
        R' Which flips over the UR edge piece first, and also messes up the F2L
        a little, then turn U to any of the other edge pieces on the LL, then
        undo the messing up by doing the sequence backwards: R u2 R2 u R, then
        what ever U needed to realign the LL. I'm not at all sure why I switched
        #s 3 and 4 because I do the edge flipping before the placing Regards,

        I've been teaching the cube to a few people recently. I've noticed that
        some beginners really struggle with understanding how the pieces move.
        Before showing a beginner anything on the cube, I talk briefly about the
        structure of the cube. I tell them (among other things) that: * the
        centres are fixed (although can spin around on their own axis) * the 8
        corners and 12 edges move around the centres * the centre square defines
        the colour for the face I tell them that if I say "you need to turn the
        red face 180 degrees" on their scrambled cube, then it means they need
        to turn the face which has a red centre square. Some beginners have no
        understanding of what this means and either look at the cube with a
        confused expression, or start turning a different coloured face. After
        cubing for so many years, it's difficult for me to understand why so
        many people have so much trouble understanding what "turn the red face"
        or "turn the face with the red centre square" means. Maybe it's because
        I'm talking about the cube in terms of colours instead of F, B, R, L, U,
        D?? This doesn't seem likely I reckon. Given that newbies aren't
        familiar with cube notation I guessed it would be easier to say "turn
        the red face 180 degrees, then turn the orange face 180 degrees" rather
        than "do L2 then R2". I'd be interested to hear what other things people
        have noticed seem to cause a lot of confusion for beginners? Jasmine.

        They will have very little confidence and have strong suspicions that
        they've misunderstood anything they've heard. My other advice is to let
        people turn the cube themselves as much as possible, rather than doing

        The way I'm learning the cube right now is by going on line and trying
        different methods. This means I use The FBLRUD method in understanding,
        instead of colors. I first make use of the Lars Petrus applets
        &lt;thanks Lars&gt; to see what the hell is happening, then read from
        the webpage using FBLRUD, occasionally glancing back at the applets,
        then copy parts out of the site and print out a sheet. While using the
        sheet, I constantly make errors and have to start over, but eventually
        become proficient while reading. Eventually, I begin to conceptualize
        what is happening and begin to memorize. After much practice, I don't
        need a sheet any more and then improve my speed. This way of learning
        worked for me on the first method I used, I'm going to try it with what
        you all have shown me. The only problem with this is that it takes lots
        of patience, but on the other hand, there is no real fast way to learn
        any method of solving the cube, especially for the beginner. In response
        to the color-first method: It sounds good for others to copy your moves,
        but then every time one has to hold the cube differently, none of the
        original colors apply. That's why the L2 R F deal seems to work well, at
        least for me. Take them through each turn slowly so that they learn the
        notation through practice. Once they get that down, their ability to
        work alone or more independantly will greatly improve. Don't forget to
        make it all fun. Taking apart the cube was something that I definately
        enjoyed at first. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Grant

        I've noticed &gt; &gt;that some beginners really struggle with

        showing a beginner anything on the cube, I talk briefly about &gt;
        &gt;the structure of the cube. I tell them (among other things) that:
        &gt; &gt;* the centres are fixed (although can spin around on their own
        axis) &gt; &gt;* the 8 corners and 12 edges move around the centres &gt;
        &gt;* the centre square defines the colour for the face &gt; &gt; I find
        that showing it works better than talking about it. If you &gt; take the
        cube apart, it is hard to not understand how it works. &gt; &gt; A lot
        of people are scared and confused by the cube, and expect to &gt; not be
        able to understand a thing. They will have very little &gt; confidence
        and have strong suspicions that they've misunderstood &gt; anything
        they've heard. &gt; &gt; My other advice is to let people turn the cube
        themselves as much as &gt; possible, rather than doing it for them.
        People learn much better by &gt; doing than by watching or being told.
        Yeah, I agree. I initially show them some examples of turns (eg. what it
        means to turn the red clockwise, or turn the L face clockwise) but I
        agree that it's better to let them do the turning. I've been trying to
        get them to understand how the cube moves, and not just blindly learn
        algorithms. Especially since I learnt the F2L intuitively, not by
        reading algorithms. I find this more rewarding so I encourage people to
        try and understand the F2L. Although for newbies I get them to do the
        1st layer intuitively, and show them an algorithm for the second layer.
        When I solve, I do the cross, then the 2 c/e pairs. When I'm teaching
        newbies I break down the c/e into separate components (cross, each of
        the 1st layer corners, then each of the second layer corners). So, if we
        start witht he cross (which I do) I'll show them what a proper cross
        looks like (so they know what they're aiming for), a few examples of how
        to build an arm of the cross, and then some general tips. After that I
        tell them to have a play around and see what they can work out on their
        own. Some people 'get it' after this, some people don't. Perhaps I will
        pull a cube apart, and see if that helps. Jasmine.

        Hi everyone, I've decided to purchase a megaminx, most likely from

        I don't really know how it works, but how easily will this minx turn? I
        believe I'll get a tiled one for the reason that I do not want to buy
        replacement stickers. Is mefferts the only company that make a megaminx?
        I have one more question if anyone knows the answer to. There is a 9.00$
        eastsheen 2x2 at mefferts.com, and at puzzle-shop.de the 2x2 cubes are
        only about 4 dollars after the euro conversion. I believe that both of
        these are eastsheens, but is the 4 dollar one smaller? How does the
        smaller eastsheen 2x2 compare with the larger one? Thanks for you help,

        I've found that before showing a new cuber anything, it's best to
        describe how the centers never move, and then show them the inner cube.
        This helps to extricate the newbie from initial confusion that could
        make them loose their will to solve the cube. I then teach them the
        cross, first layer corners. Then show them how the middle layer works.
        And teach them to understand it, not just learn it. Lastly, i teach them
        the last layer, at this point i have a feeling they dont get it and just
        memorize, so i try to explain how to make the cross in the last layer by
        breaking apart and rebuilding the F2L. Afterwords, i teach them corner
        permutation, simple 2 corner swap, w/o messing up oriented edges. Then,
        Corner orientation, consisting of a 4 move sequence twice, then the
        counter of this sequence for the other corner. Then finally, I teach
        them just a 3 swap edge permutation because from this you can solve any
        edge permution at all in the last layer.

        luck getting a tiled megaminx. I'm pretty sure they sell them stickered,
        now. I got mine with tiles, but that was at least a couple years ago.
        You may want to send them an e-mail, asking if they would sell you one
        tiled, or at the very least sell you a set of tiles. They probably won't
        give you a tiled megmainx, but they used to sell sets of tiles for $12
        USD. Beware, that whether they sell you a stickered or tiled megaminx,
        you will almost definitely have to readhere/replace the originals. That
        aside, unless they have changed the design since I got mine, they are
        great puzzles! It will most likely be very difficult to move at first,
        but with love and patience, it will break in nicely. The inner mechanics
        are similar to a 3x3x3 cube, in that there is a central "spider" axis,
        albeit 12 legged instead of 6 legged. Each leg holds on a center and is
        spring loaded. You take it apart the same way you would a regular cube.
        Mine went through a series of different lubes, but I'd think that a good
        silicone lube and some good break-in time and it should move well in no
        time at all. - Grant

        This is pretty much the same solution as I've been teaching recently. I
        decided on doing it this way because it only requires a few algorithms,
        yet it's structured in a way that it can easily be developed in to a
        more advanced method if people are keen, eg. by doing the c/e pairs in
        the F2L, or by learning the other LL edge permutations (the 'H' and
        'Z'), or by learning all 7 LL corner orientation algs. The problem with
        some 'simple' methods is that they are not scalable - to improve your
        cubing you have to un-learn much of what you know and re-learn it in a
        different way. This is what happened to me when I first learnt the cube
        back in the 80s (before all the zillions of fabulous solution
        websites!). The method I learnt was really quite a terrible method and
        it took a bit of work to un-learn the entrenched method and then learn a
        decent method. (I now do cross, F2L, orient LL edges, orient LL corners,
        permute all.) Jasmine. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        works. And teach them to understand it, not just &gt; learn it. Lastly,
        i teach them the last layer, at this point i have &gt; a feeling they
        dont get it and just memorize, so i try to explain how &gt; to make the
        cross in the last layer by breaking apart and rebuilding &gt; the F2L.
        &gt; &gt; Afterwords, i teach them corner permutation, simple 2 corner
        swap, &gt; w/o messing up oriented edges. &gt; &gt; Then, Corner
        orientation, consisting of a 4 move sequence twice, then &gt; the
        counter of this sequence for the other corner. Then finally, I &gt;
        teach them just a 3 swap edge permutation because from this you can &gt;
        solve any edge permution at all in the last layer.

        They do break quite a lot if you can go fast but it's usually because
        the wires come out and get tangled with the fingers and snap, cut etc.
        Lubrication would presumably only aid them in sliding out. You should be
        able to go much faster before you hit those problems though as 6-7
        seconds is possible at a fairly deliberate pace. Back in the 80s we'd
        hit 2 seconds and as someone who is quite pedestrian at dexterous
        puzzles I'd think there are people who can probably go much faster
        again. My advice is to try and work out the way to move your wrists and
        hands in such a way as to trigger the entire solution from start to end
        - it helps if you are flexible - you should find that you can pick up a
        fair bit of speed without endangering the puzzle. &gt; --- In

        wrote: &gt; No way! it's only 6 colored!? That would ruin the challenge
        of the &gt; puzzle. Don't be fooled - the 6 color megaminx has some
        tricks up its sleeve. I have a 12 color minx, and not a 6 color, so I'm
        not all that experienced with it, but I could see how the 6 color minx
        may actually be harder. With the 6 color puzzle, you have 2 main factors
        that may make it harder with only 1 factor that is to your advantage.
        I'll start with the single advantage - because similar colors are
        directly opposite on the puzzle, you have two of each edge piece.
        Therefore, when you're looking for an edge, you can use either of the
        two - that makes it a little easier (maybe even a lot). Unfortunately,
        this quality of having duplicate edge pieces creates a possible parity
        problem - 50% of the time, you'll have to fix the parity problem by
        swapping two identical edges (my alg for that is 18 moves). The more
        difficult obstacle is that you have 2 corners with each triplet of
        colors, but the corners are not identical. Going around the corners
        clockwise, if one is Red-Green-Blue, the other would be Red-Blue-Green.
        So, when you're looking for corners, you not only have to identify the
        correct set of colors, but you also have to make sure they're correctly
        oriented on the corner. This makes life very difficult. &gt; Is there
        anywhere where I can buy a 12 colored one. I'll have to &gt; email the
        mefferts people again and ask them too. E-mailing Mefferts is probably
        just about the only way (if they will even do it), unless you can find
        someone else who will sell you theirs. &gt; Otherwise, I don't think I'd
        paint it, I'd be much too scared to &gt; ruin the cube. Yeah - I have a
        cube that I do test painting on to try out different ideas. My main cube
        is painted, but the edges are pretty sad - colors overlapping and all.
        I've been playing around with using tape to give it a straight edge, but
        just can't get it quite right. &gt; How does one paint a puzzle? I mean,
        what are some general &gt; precautions you take, and will any paint do?
        I dont think I'd do &gt; it, unless I really couldnt get a 12 colored
        minx. I'd recommend nail polish. Aside from the fact that I'm not
        capable of painting in a straight line, I think it looks really cool. It
        has the texture of smooth tiles, without the possibility of them falling
        off. First, put on enough coats of color (I do 2-4, depending on the
        color/brand) to get the color you want. After that, put on a couple
        coats of a clear "hard as nails" enamel to give it a hard finish. Be
        sure to leave plenty of drying time, and once it's dry, stick it in the
        oven on very low heat (no more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 to 30
        minutes - this makes the surface even harder once cooled. I've been
        using this cube for months now, and it still looks like new. - Grant

        centres of a Revenge - you can only do even permutations of the centres
        as they are generated by double transpositions - but you can make it
        appear like you're just switching 2 pieces if you do a 3- cycle where 2
        centres have the same colour. &gt; Ton

        This is my first time to break the 24s barrier! I never ever thought I'd
        be anywhere near this low. I set the cube down for quite a while and
        picked it back up to start learning OLL algorithms. I presently use the
        3 look LL and in the cases where all 4 edges need orienting or none of
        the 4 need orienting, I use the 2 look. Just have felt kind of "on" the
        last few days. Anyway, I was excited, had to share! Daniel Personal best
        so far is 18.33 btw, but that was set a while back. Yahoo! Groups

        Jasmine. No, if you know the 3x3x3 basics for the cross of the last
        layer, and the basic moves for the corners you can solve the megaminx by
        intuition So make the 5 edge pieces position and orientation, position
        the corners and orientate. You will find that these are almost the 3x3x3
        basic moves. If you start with the corners it is much harder. Sure you
        will need megaminx-specific algs for speed sloving I think this should
        be enough to have a go for the last layer Have fun Ton

        Ton's right, most of the algorithms I still used are 3x3x3 algorithms.
        Mostly from the 4 look LL, whith a few exceptions. Grant did show me a
        couple that were far more efficient, but I had the whole thing solved
        without knowing any minx-specific algorithms, quite a few times. My
        order is a little different from what Ton stated though, so I'll mention
        it real quick: OLL edges PLL edges OLL corners PLL corners It should be
        noted that the PLL corners method I use does NOT come from a 3x3x3 but
        rather it was just intuitive. If you're interested in specific
        algorithms, let me know and I'll throw out a few, though as I said,
        Grant has quite a few useful (speed enhancing) algorithms that I have
        yet to learn. Good luck! Daniel Hayes

        you under 22? Concerning ebay, did you bid what you're willing to pay?

        &gt; happy cubing. &gt; -Heath &gt; &gt; p.s. i think someone from the

        can do the cube here on campus..which is &gt; me and the 6 or so other
        guys i've taugh, plus the one guy who can &gt; solve it already..and
        they all live on my floor here in the dorms. &gt; The guy from the paper
        is supposed to come talk to me sometime, i'll &gt; let you guys (and

        David J I would of paid a couple more dollars for it, but thats about
        it. I think the auction was at about $14 with 3 dollars shipping. It did
        have 2 cubes with it. If i really want an impossibal i guess i can buy a
        new one for $18. Im not under 22 a whole lot, but I can get a handful of
        them a day. Getting a time like that doesn't really surprise me like it
        used to. The times i get happy about are the sub 20 ones.

        I'm 16, know TI-BASIC (calculatior language), ASP, VB, HTML, and limited

        no person has ever seen before. :) Speaking of computers, maybe someone
        could help me out here...(if it's not too far off topic...) At work
        today, I was writing a program (ASP) and it called for an "on error
        resume next" statement. For some reason, my code would always return an
        error. I cut down the code to see where the problem was until i was
        running this exact code: On error resume next If err.number&lt;&gt;0
        then response.write err.number response.end end if I ran the program,
        and it still returned an error. Where I had it display "err.number" it
        said 0. Anyone have any idea what might be going on here? Thanks, andy b

        Hey everyone, this board has been kind of quiet lately so I figured I
        would post this. This isn't cube related at all, however it is a display
        of the same dedication that I think we put into the cube, just for
        something else. Anyway I was a huge fan of Nintendo when I was a kid, I
        was like 8 when I got my first one. Anyway I was also a big fan of the
        Super Mario brothers games. Well, and I'm sure some of you have seen
        this already, someone beat the Super Mario Brothers 3 game in 10 minutes
        and 59 seconds, 11 minutes basically. If you search on google.com for
        the string "mario 11 minutes" you'll find all kinds of websites that
        have a link to a video of the kid doing it. Anyway here's a direct link
        to a page with the video, http://ebaumsworld.com/smb3beat.html If you've
        played the game then this video is absolutely amazing to watch. If you
        haven't played the game then it's just an amazing display of a guy who's
        really good at a video game. So anyway the board has been pretty quiet
        lately so I thought I'd try to liven things up. This isn't exactly cube
        related, however I think it sort of relates to cubing in that I'm sure
        this guy had to practice as dedicated as we do for the cube in order to
        do this. So anyway check it out, I think it's totaly amazing. Chris

        That just goes to show that the same type of dedication we put forth
        towards our puzzles can be applied to so many different things. Such as,
        say, speedsolving _while_ playing Mario =) Now that would be cool. The
        D-pad and the buttons would have to be controlled by the same hand,
        unless one could use his feet to solve the cube and/or play nintendo.
        Although I'm sure there is a glove controller or something of the sort
        to let you play nintendo with only one hand.. Oh well, probably not
        worth checking out. Doug

        Hey my record from when I was a kid is 3 hours. I sat down and beat the
        game in one sitting, though that's how long it took. I think 17 minutes
        is an amazing time too. I had never even thought to extend the speed
        concept to video games, and personally I think it is just as cool as
        speedcubing.. Well allllllmost as cool. I'm slightly biased towards

        think it's totaly amazing. &gt; &gt; Chris That is pretty cool,
        although, it teaches you that one can learn to perfect nearly anything.
        I myself have (actually had) a few world records in Goldeneye for N64
        (facility in particular 00agent) as well as Time splitters 2 for the
        xbox. I really got into the TS2 game for xbox, and began to submit
        regular world records, although, many of my times were deleted and taken
        off, since i stopped playing a few months ago. Check it out if you want,
        there are actually World record sites for many games:
        http://ngc-elites.net/ts2/index.php my name was The_Great_Moo, however,
        i was at 18th place at my peak, now since many of my times are gone, and
        many people have gotten better, im at 65th...! anyway, i set a few world
        records in that, and let me tell you it takes absolute perfection. If i
        could rubik's cube like i can play the "bricking it" mini game in TS2,
        or play goldeneye, perfectdark... etc. , I'd be around 14 seconds id
        say, at the point of utter perfection. It teaches you something though,
        and competeing in videogames has made me more competitive as far as
        school work, rubik's cubing, and basically everything, I even have
        taking out the garbage down to a science, since i do it every week.

        Most of them turn really nicely (one was pretty stiff even after lubing

        no way to adjust the tension. Since the cubes are alreday fairly loose,
        I guess that means they will wear out faster. -heath

        Hey everyone I updated my Rubik's Revenge solution to correct any
        possible confusion about the parity error moves. I explain that the
        "speed solve" version of the move affects the orientation and
        permutation of the last layer. I did not mention or use any diagrams to
        show exactly how it affects the U layer, though in my speed 4x4x4
        solving I use that information to decide which edge I want to flip, just
        as a hint for any aspiring 4x4x4 solvers :) I've gotten a lot of e-mails
        where people were confused about that so I finally cleared it up. Anyway
        if you're still confused on the parity move and the speed solve verion
        check out step 3 of my solution again. Chris

        Today I found this web page: http://www.zetagrid.net Whilst, it is
        unlikely to help in settling the Riemann Hypothesis (it can only do so
        by proving it is false, contrary to most people's expectations), it,
        like the Great Internet Mersenne Primes Search (GIMPS) is getting a lot
        of data on a problem. In this case over a billion non-trivial zeros of
        the zeta function are calculated each day. It seems to me that a similar
        project could be used for the cube group, as I have suggested before.
        For the cube group, there are only a finite number of elements, whereas
        the zeta function has infinitely many zeros, so in principle the cube
        group is an easier problem to tackle (and if you know about the Riemann
        Hypothesis you will realize that this is a big understatement).

        This is definitely in real time. I don't know what level specifically
        this was, but the game he was playing seemed to be a special build. It's
        probably something up near level 20. (Yeah, I know it only goes to 15.
        That's just to put it in perspective. I've seen 15 and it's much slower.
        (i.e. you can actually see the pieces falling in level 15.) You do the

        Hi GoD2, I am unfamiliar with the terms and symbols, but I gather that
        Riemann was looking for a pattern matching the irregular distribution of
        prime numbers. Is this correct? Can you state in English what in
        particular is sought in terms of the "cube group?" Interested, David J

        suggested before. For the cube group, there &gt; are only a finite
        number of elements, whereas the zeta function has &gt; infinitely many
        zeros, so in principle the cube group is an easier &gt; problem to

        with the terms and symbols, but I gather that &gt; Riemann was looking
        for a pattern matching the irregular distribution &gt; of prime numbers.
        Is this correct? Something like that. Although Euclid had shown that
        there were infinitely many primes, their distribution amongst the
        integers (density) was less well known. The number of primes less than
        or equal to x, pi(x), for instance. Various asymptotics like pi(x)~x/(ln
        x) and then later the pi(x)~li(x), where li(x) is the logarithmic
        integral (better) were looked at. The prime number theorem established
        that they were asymptotically correct (in that the ratio tends to 1).
        The Riemann hypothesis would give a nice bound on the difference (in
        terms of x) so that |pi(x)-li(x)|=O(sqrt(x)ln(x)). A lot of results are
        conditional on the Riemann hypothesis. i.e. they are of the form, if the
        Riemann hypothesis is true then .... The paper in which he published
        this hypothesis is, I believe, actually Riemann's only paper in number
        theory. In that sense, it's a paper which has had enormous consequences
        despite being the only paper in the field by its author (somewhat like
        Cohen's paper on forcing, though the effect of that paper is perhaps
        even more impressive). &gt; &gt; Can you state in English what in
        particular is sought in terms of &gt; the "cube group?" There are lots
        of possible questions. The main one in terms of the Rubik's cube would
        be to find the most moves needed to solve it (the diameter) or the
        average number of moves to solve the cube. This depends on what you
        count as a move. For instance, if we allow any of the quarter turns (but
        nothing else) to count as 1 move we'd get one answer. If we also allow
        half turns to count as 1 move we'd get a (probably different) answer. If
        we allow moves like FB or FB' to count as one move we'd get yet another
        answer. If we only allow ourselves a minimal generating set (two moves
        as opposed to the usual 6 quarter moves or 12 quarter and half moves)
        then we'd get a very much larger answer. Heuristically, the answer if we
        allow half turns to count as one move would appear to be 20, in that no
        counter-examples are yet known. The group is very big though, so it is
        conceivable there might be a position that required 21 moves etc. So
        what is sought is just an answer to what's the worst case scenario - is
        it 20 or not? (Superflip is 20 moves, so the answer is at least 20.)
        With a very large number of machines working on the problem, it might be
        possible to lay an attack, even though the numbers are very large. If we
        only want to know the diameter, then we wouldn't need to know the
        optimal move for each position. For instance, if we knew that every
        sequence of 21 moves could actually be done in 20 or less then we'd get
        that the diameter was 20. Thus, lately, for some of the algorithms I
        have looked at, I have not tried to get the optimal solution but just
        tried to see if they could be done in 20 moves or not. Equally, one
        would only need to do this for each equivalence class, which would cut
        down the work a little. It's still a huge problem, but it's not any
        bigger than Zetagrid (at least if the Riemann hypothesis is true) or
        GIMPS. &gt; &gt; Interested, &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        it, like the Great Internet Mersenne Primes Search &gt; &gt; (GIMPS) is

        &gt; &gt; cube group, as I have suggested before. For the cube group,
        there &gt; &gt; are only a finite number of elements, whereas the zeta
        function has &gt; &gt; infinitely many zeros, so in principle the cube
        group is an easier &gt; &gt; problem to tackle (and if you know about
        the Riemann Hypothesis you &gt; &gt; will realize that this is a big
        understatement).

        getting close to your average times? My best average so far was today at
        32.36 seconds but I had to do about 30 cubes before I started getting
        decent times. I cubed a bit in the morning and was doing high 30's and
        low 40's... I started this afternoon and did high 30's and low 40's
        still until at some point... suddenly my times started becoming decently
        close to my average again. Is this normal? Does it happen to anyone

        to memorize and then 14 minutes to solve. The times can be shortened
        significantly but I was being extra careful so I didn't slip up. Corner
        Orientation: 1102 0122 (3 moves) Edge Orientation: 1110 1101 1100 (3
        moves) Corner Permutation: 3286 5741 (4 moves) Edge Permutation: 1 10 6
        3 7 11 8 2 5 4 9 12 (6 moves) [I know you aren't supposed to write
        anything down in an official blindfold solve - so I didn't. But I still
        had it memorized when I was done so I wrote it down as a souvenir] I
        just love this version of cubing (I first solved the cube in 1983) and
        will definately be doing more of it. It is so fun to slowly solve the
        cube in your head with percision moves affecting only 2 or 3 cubies. My
        huge respect to those who can solve a 4x4 and even a 5x5 blindfolded.
        And DAVID ORSER solving 10 cubes blindfolded in under 2 hours (as posted
        on speedcubing.com) is an amazing feat of concentration and
        memorization. MANY THANKS TO DR CARR for posting his instructions. My
        system varies slightly from his but was definately inspired by and
        modeled on his explanations. I use a different move for the 1/2 corner
        orientation and different moves for three edge cycle. I also edge cycle
        in the top/bottom and front/back (instead of top/bottom and left/right)
        which affects the edge orientation analysis.) His explanation of how to
        number and memorize the corners and edges was extremely helpful. I found
        it easiest to learn the solution in stages. Thus I started with a 2x2.
        When that was easy I wanted to make sure I could do it without moving
        any of the edge pieces around so I would then scramble my cube, visually
        solve all the edge pieces and then blindfold solve the 8 corners around
        them. When I could do that I would then visually solve the corners and
        then practice solving just the edge pieces blindfolded. Finally the
        synthesis of the corners and edges. I like to orient all the pieces
        first (corners and then edges) then permute the corners then permute the
        edges.

        The system and the person I'm sure. I have worked really hard on
        developing my own system over the last 3 months and the better it gets
        the closer it gets to Fridrich! Which is kind of depressing but just
        goes to show what a good system Fridrich is. This is how my LL has
        developed: I started by orienting corners and one edge, position corners
        and having a 3-cycle of edges to finish. Then I moved to orienting
        (minimum) one corner while finishing the middle layer. This made the
        orienting corners and one edge bit easier. Then I oriented (minimum) one
        corner and (minimum) one edge while finishing the middle layer. This
        meant that when i oriented corners i already had an edge oriented. It
        cut down the algorithms so much that I moved to flipping the last edges
        at the same time. In other words I am orienting the LL in one look. So I
        might just as well work out the last couple of position algorithms and
        do a standard Fridrich 2-look! The only difference is orienting a corner
        and edge while I finish the middle layer. Which cuts down the
        orientation algorithms to about 30. Duncan Yahoo! Groups Sponsor

        It is kind of funny how you can look back at your old times and be
        amazed. My first sunday contest was around 90 seconds. (a little over a
        year ago) Now I'm around 24-25 seconds(when I'm in practice :P) seems
        like the barriers to break for me were: 90 seconds-doesn't take much 60
        seconds-broken after practice of inefficient method 40 seconds-broken
        after learning 4-look &amp; f2l 30 seconds-broken after learning 3-look
        25 seconds-broken after revising f2l I'm not really sure what the next
        barrier is going to be. The closer you get to zero, the closer the
        barriers get to each other. I'm probably looking at sub23 next. -Richard

        had to do it again tonight to prove &gt; to myself that I wasn't just
        dreaming. I guess that's confirmation. Soon, you will probably find it
        fairly straightforward. &gt;My first ever solve took 26 &gt; minutes -
        12 minutes to memorize and then 14 minutes to solve. The &gt; times can
        be shortened significantly but I was being extra careful &gt; so I
        didn't slip up. &gt; &gt; Corner Orientation: 1102 0122 (3 moves) &gt;
        Edge Orientation: 1110 1101 1100 (3 moves) &gt; Corner Permutation: 3286

        an official &gt; blindfold solve - so I didn't. But I still had it
        memorized when I &gt; was done so I wrote it down as a souvenir] I used
        to do that a lot too. &gt; &gt; I just love this version of cubing (I
        first solved the cube in 1983) &gt; and will definately be doing more of
        it. It is so fun to slowly &gt; solve the cube in your head with
        percision moves affecting only 2 or &gt; 3 cubies. My huge respect to
        those who can solve a 4x4 and even a &gt; 5x5 blindfolded. And DAVID
        ORSER solving 10 cubes blindfolded in &gt; under 2 hours (as posted on
        speedcubing.com) is an amazing feat of &gt; concentration and
        memorization. &gt; Have a go at it - maybe you'll find you can do that
        too. &gt; MANY THANKS TO DR CARR for posting his instructions. My system
        &gt; varies slightly from his but was definately inspired by and modeled
        &gt; on his explanations. I use a different move for the 1/2 corner &gt;
        orientation and different moves for three edge cycle. I also edge &gt;
        cycle in the top/bottom and front/back (instead of top/bottom and &gt;
        left/right) which affects the edge orientation analysis.) His &gt;
        explanation of how to number and memorize the corners and edges was &gt;
        extremely helpful. &gt; &gt; I found it easiest to learn the solution in
        stages. Thus I started &gt; with a 2x2. When that was easy I wanted to
        make sure I could do it &gt; without moving any of the edge pieces
        around so I would then &gt; scramble my cube, visually solve all the
        edge pieces and then &gt; blindfold solve the 8 corners around them.
        When I could do that I &gt; would then visually solve the corners and
        then practice solving just &gt; the edge pieces blindfolded. Finally the
        synthesis of the corners &gt; and edges. I like to orient all the pieces
        first (corners and then &gt; edges) then permute the corners then
        permute the edges.

        One of my friends from high school, who I used to cube with a lot, had a
        wooden tower of Hanoi puzzle (I think it was 6 discs). Anyway I remember
        we used to race eachother on it, though I don't remember our times. It's
        kind of easy once you know the routine though, sort of like cup stacking
        in that you do the same thing every time, however it was still a lot of
        fun I thought. That's cool, I didn't know someone else speed tower of
        hanoi'd (wow that's the weirdest speed-something word I've ever
        heard/used) :) Also that's a good average for the Cube! Getting past the
        40's is kind of annoying, at least it was for me, but once you do you
        remember how to do it fairly consistently with a little practice. Chris

        I recomend you to try building them yourself. Duanes modifications are
        very simple (in my opinion). I wouldn't spend the money on a 3x3x5/3x3x4
        that isn't fully functional. But don't let me discourage you. Puzzle
        building can be time consuming, but i think it would be more rewarding
        to say, "I built this!" The siamese and fusion cubes require little time
        to make cause all you really need to do is glue a couple pieces together

        Did I miss some thread a while back or just forget or what. But did you
        guys know Some of the new Oddzon cubes are designed a little different?
        One of the people I tought how to do the cube bought a couple cubes for
        presents to their brother and sister for christmas, and he brought them
        to me to lube them up for him. I took the first one apart and noticed
        that the center pieces on the inside were rounded the other difference
        was the axle was black and looked like it was made out of a different
        kind of plastic. I guess that will possibly cut down on piece pops (the
        centers being rounded). Then i took apart the other cube and it was just
        a normal cube. I dont know why he got the one that was different. All
        the other cubes i've seen have been the same, except for that one. The
        cube with the rounded centers does turn pretty smooth, incase anyone was
        wondering. -Heath

        Hi Tyson, I would definitely be interested in a Southern California
        Tournament...or even some regular meetings of speedcubers in the area. I
        am in Temecula...about an hour and a half drive from Caltech. My
        speedcubing has been a little shaky for several months because my thumb
        doesn't work ;-) ...way too much cubing last summer...I am starting to
        be able to bend it again ;-). I can average low 30's in my current
        state. There is another cubist here that averages under a minute and
        quite a few people under two minutes... Bill McGaugh

        Hi Heath, The arched underside to the center cube is part of the new
        tooling. That arched Oddzon was simply the new model. This underside
        arch, which completes the internal circle, was a design feature from the
        very beginning, but only put into production 4 or 5 times. The early
        cubes were hard to turn. I think the underside was flattened to reduce
        internal friction, (and I think to save money). But they pop apart
        easily. As different plastics became available, like the harder, slicker
        plastic of the Deluxe, they could make the underside of the center
        arched again. The new one are pretty good. David J --- In

        the cube bought a couple cubes &gt; for presents to their brother and

        just a normal cube. &gt; &gt; I dont know why he got the one that was

        &lt;no_reply@y...&gt; wrote: [snipped] &gt; Something like that.
        Although Euclid had shown that there were &gt; infinitely many primes,
        their distribution amongst the integers &gt; (density) was less well
        known. The number of primes less than or &gt; equal to x, pi(x), for
        instance. Various asymptotics like &gt; pi(x)~x/(ln x) and then later
        the pi(x)~li(x), where li(x) is the &gt; logarithmic integral (better)
        were looked at. The prime number &gt; theorem established that they were
        asymptotically correct (in that &gt; the ratio tends to 1). &gt; The
        Riemann hypothesis would give a nice bound on the difference (in &gt;
        terms of x) so that |pi(x)-li(x)|=O(sqrt(x)ln(x)). I think I follow.
        &gt; A lot of results are conditional on the Riemann hypothesis. i.e.
        &gt; they are of the form, if the Riemann hypothesis is true then ....
        &gt; The paper in which he published this hypothesis is, I believe, &gt;
        actually Riemann's only paper in number theory. In that sense, it's &gt;
        a paper which has had enormous consequences despite being the only &gt;
        paper in the field by its author (somewhat like Cohen's paper on &gt;
        forcing, though the effect of that paper is perhaps even more &gt;
        impressive). OK. The density problem is very cool to chew on. Years ago
        I looked for a quick way to test a number to see if it was prime. But I
        only briefly approached the density problem, and from the other side, so
        to speak. Consider all positive integers as points on a short, but very
        long graph, starting with the number 2, make it a wave that intersects
        every other point, then the number three make a wave intersecting every
        third point, then the number 5, then 7 and so forth. I was looking for
        the density of the non-prime numbers. One useful observation is that
        perhaps some version of an equation like 1 - 1/2 - 1/3 - 1/5 could be
        employed to give the density directly. Am I making sense? &gt; There are
        lots of possible questions. The main one in terms of the &gt; Rubik's
        cube would be to find the most moves needed to solve it (the &gt;
        diameter) or the average number of moves to solve the cube. &gt; This
        depends on what you count as a move. For instance, if we allow &gt; any
        of the quarter turns (but nothing else) to count as 1 move we'd &gt; get
        one answer. If we also allow half turns to count as 1 move we'd &gt; get
        a (probably different) answer. If we allow moves like FB or FB' &gt; to
        count as one move we'd get yet another answer. If we only allow &gt;
        ourselves a minimal generating set (two moves as opposed to the &gt;
        usual 6 quarter moves or 12 quarter and half moves) then we'd get a &gt;
        very much larger answer. For notation I count all moves as one,
        including slices, and allowing half turns for computer programs may help
        simplify scrambling programs, but mathematically I see the need for
        quarter turns to be the standard. I know the number of turns needed to
        reach any position optimally, using quarter turns, is greater than 17.
        :^) My question is, if you can make any of 12 moves as the first turn,
        if you allow duplication then 12 moves is possible for each turn
        after... 2 (12 ^ 17) is only slightly larger than the 43 quintilion
        possiblilites. Can you calculate the density of duplicate positions and
        find the minimun number of turns to reach every position? &gt;
        Heuristically, the answer if we allow half turns to count as one &gt;
        move would appear to be 20, in that no counter-examples are yet &gt;
        known. The group is very big though, so it is conceivable there &gt;
        might be a position that required 21 moves etc. &gt; So what is sought
        is just an answer to what's the worst case &gt; scenario - is it 20 or
        not? (Superflip is 20 moves, so the answer is &gt; at least 20.) &gt;
        With a very large number of machines working on the problem, it &gt;
        might be possible to lay an attack, even though the numbers are very
        &gt; large. If we only want to know the diameter, then we wouldn't need
        &gt; to know the optimal move for each position. For instance, if we
        knew &gt; that every sequence of 21 moves could actually be done in 20
        or less &gt; then we'd get that the diameter was 20. Thus, lately, for
        some of &gt; the algorithms I have looked at, I have not tried to get
        the optimal &gt; solution but just tried to see if they could be done in
        20 moves or &gt; not. Equally, one would only need to do this for each
        equivalence &gt; class, which would cut down the work a little. &gt;
        It's still a huge problem, but it's not any bigger than Zetagrid (at
        &gt; least if the Riemann hypothesis is true) or GIMPS. Why not start
        with corner positions? Isn't the 2x2x2 solved? Thanks for answering my
        questions. I appreciate it. David J

        Buffering means your media playback program is gathering data onto your
        local computer. A video file generally has large amount of data
        organized in terms of frames (sort of like film). If your internet
        connection is slow the program has to buffer a number of frames to your
        local machine before start playing it otherwise the movie will look
        jerky and sound will be out of sync. Since the buffer rans out pretty
        quickly, the program will have to do something like play-buffer-play
        etc. very annoying. A better way is to simply download (if it's allowed)
        the video file to your machine first then play it. To download using
        Internet Exporer, right click on the link and select Save Target As,
        follow the instructions you should be able to get it. Hope that helps.

        Hmmm... I wasn't thinking on something of that large of a scale for now.
        Are there people around who would be up for just a smaller local type
        meeting? If there was enough interest, we could make things regular. I'm
        leaving for winter break but I'll be back in the area in early January
        so I was thinking maybe a Sunday afternoon in January or something?
        It'll also give me some time to publicize around. Possibly, if we had
        enough people and the resources, maybe we could pull off a larger type
        tournament in the summer. It is an off year afterall... And as for the
        Athenuem... wow... that would be really cool. I have no idea about how
        to get that place though... it would probably involve a lot of money.

        I was looking around for cubing pages online today, and I came across a

        I got a cube from Wal-mart the other day, after a nasty little incident
        with my original cube and some neoprene glue. The first few turns I
        noticed that the cube was very slick compared to the last one I had
        (from Toys R Us). I took out an edge to lube it and noticed that the
        internal spindle was black, but didn't think anything of it. I didnt
        take it all apart, although now that seems like a good idea since my
        curiosity is at hand ;) Doug On Fri, 2003-12-12 at 00:09, Heath wrote:

        I guess there is maybe a clarity problem too. I guess it's easier for a
        beginner to understand how a simple Sune works, or better said why it
        works, than for example Fridrich's 1st U permutation, which moves much
        more different faces. So it seems to me (at least it seemed so when I
        first learned cubing) that the simpler the alg is, the easier it is to
        understand and to memorize. I think how long it is doesn't really matter
        (unless it's "really" long ;-) ), if it's still "understandable". and
        that's why you always have a LL done that way (or any equivalent way) in
        a beginner's method: OE (6 to 10 moves depending on the alg used, but
        always simple algs), which usually doesn't affect corners, but moves
        edges around, then PE, using Sune (only R and U moves) once or twice,
        which affects corners position AND orientation, then PC, which affects
        their orientation but can be done using only U, R and L (for example R
        L' U R' U' L U R U' R') and then OC, doing combos of Sune's or mirrors
        or whatever... you'll also see that a beginner NEVER moves B and D faces
        for the LL, because he won't understand why he should turn these faces
        (especially the D face) to move pieces on the U face... and the B face
        is really kind of far from your body, so you have to burn some calories
        to reach it lol... Also, I've seen that an alg isn't really 'learnable'
        without working on finger tricks, especially alg's that use every face
        of the cube. That's the case of almost every permutation or orientation
        alg, so a beginner who isn't really sure of the way he holds the cube or
        turn the faces can easily get lost by all the moves those alg's require.
        And, a beginner hardly knows finger tricks =)... Am I right, or is what
        I'm saying in bad English just totally wrong ?!!! Fran√ßois PS: Oh, and
        BTW there are 2 guys who invented a while ago a very good beginner's
        method, called ZB method... Anyone wants to teach it to some beginner?

        &gt; OK. &gt; &gt; The density problem is very cool to chew on. Years
        ago I looked for &gt; a quick way to test a number to see if it was
        prime. But I only &gt; briefly approached the density problem, and from
        the other side, so to &gt; speak. &gt; Consider all positive integers as
        points on a short, but very long &gt; graph, starting with the number 2,
        make it a wave that intersects &gt; every other point, then the number
        three make a wave intersecting &gt; every third point, then the number
        5, then 7 and so forth. I was &gt; looking for the density of the
        non-prime numbers. That's known as the sieve of Erastosthenes. &gt; One
        useful observation is that perhaps some version of an equation &gt; like
        1 - 1/2 - 1/3 - 1/5 could be employed to give the density &gt; directly.
        Am I making sense? That sum diverges to -infinity. The one in the other
        post doesn't really work as density either because the sum is not
        absolutely convergent, so the order in which terms are added affects the
        answer. In fact, since it isn't absolutely convergent but only
        conditionally convergent, any answer can be achieved by adding in
        different orders. Since the density is looking at the limit of pi(x)/x,
        there's no particular reason to look at adding 1/6 before subtracting
        1/5 etc. &gt; &gt; &gt; There are lots of possible questions. The main
        one in terms of the &gt; &gt; Rubik's cube would be to find the most
        moves needed to solve it (the &gt; &gt; diameter) or the average number
        of moves to solve the cube. &gt; &gt; This depends on what you count as
        a move. For instance, if we allow &gt; &gt; any of the quarter turns
        (but nothing else) to count as 1 move we'd &gt; &gt; get one answer. If
        we also allow half turns to count as 1 move we'd &gt; &gt; get a
        (probably different) answer. If we allow moves like FB or FB' &gt; &gt;
        to count as one move we'd get yet another answer. If we only allow &gt;
        &gt; ourselves a minimal generating set (two moves as opposed to the
        &gt; &gt; usual 6 quarter moves or 12 quarter and half moves) then we'd
        get a &gt; &gt; very much larger answer. &gt; &gt; For notation I count
        all moves as one, including slices, and &gt; allowing half turns for
        computer programs may help simplify scrambling &gt; programs, but
        mathematically I see the need for quarter turns to be &gt; the standard.
        &gt; &gt; I know the number of turns needed to reach any position
        optimally, &gt; using quarter turns, is greater than 17. :^) That's
        true. It's also true of half turns. In fact, I have read that at least
        half the positions need at least 18 moves (with half turns). &gt; &gt;
        My question is, if you can make any of 12 moves as the first turn, &gt;
        if you allow duplication then 12 moves is possible for each turn &gt;
        after... 2 (12 ^ 17) is only slightly larger than the 43 quintilion &gt;
        possiblilites. Can you calculate the density of duplicate positions &gt;
        and find the minimun number of turns to reach every position? Well, one
        thing is that you can discount a lot of things e.g. RR', RLR can be made
        shorter (or in quarter turns RLR and RRL are the same at least). So, for
        instance you can insist that DU never occurs by replacing by UD etc.
        Thus 12^17 is very much an overestimate of the number of positions that
        can be reached in 17 moves. &gt; &gt; Why not start with corner
        positions? Isn't the 2x2x2 solved? &gt; &gt; Thanks for answering my
        questions. I appreciate it. &gt; &gt; David J The 2x2x2 is indeed
        solved. Of course, moves that solve the 2x2x2 don't necessarily only
        solve corners in the 3x3x3. For instance, some corner orientation moves
        in the 3x3x3 need 18 moves (half turn) but the 2x2x2 can always be done
        in 11 moves (half turn). (I have got all the optimal algorithms for just
        orienting corners or just moving corners (without orientating) though.)

        technique for diping into an equation that contains an infinity, like
        plugging in a prime and getting a rough idea as to where the next prime
        might fall. &gt; The one in the other post doesn't &gt; really work as
        density either because the sum is not absolutely &gt; convergent, so the
        order in which terms are added affects the &gt; answer. In fact, since
        it isn't absolutely convergent but only &gt; conditionally convergent,
        any answer can be achieved by adding in &gt; different orders. Since the
        density is looking at the limit of &gt; pi(x)/x, there's no particular
        reason to look at adding 1/6 before &gt; subtracting 1/5 etc. I don't
        quite follow. If 2 takes out every other number and three takes out
        every third number, then all the numbers divisible by 6 are accounted
        for twice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are lots of possible
        questions. The main one in terms of &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubik's cube
        would be to find the most moves needed to solve it &gt; (the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; diameter) or the average number of moves to solve the cube. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; This depends on what you count as a move. For instance, if we
        &gt; allow &gt; &gt; &gt; any of the quarter turns (but nothing else) to
        count as 1 move &gt; we'd &gt; &gt; &gt; get one answer. If we also
        allow half turns to count as 1 move &gt; we'd &gt; &gt; &gt; get a
        (probably different) answer. If we allow moves like FB or &gt; FB' &gt;
        &gt; &gt; to count as one move we'd get yet another answer. If we only
        &gt; allow &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves a minimal generating set (two moves
        as opposed to the &gt; &gt; &gt; usual 6 quarter moves or 12 quarter and
        half moves) then we'd &gt; get a &gt; &gt; &gt; very much larger answer.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For notation I count all moves as one, including
        slices, and &gt; &gt; allowing half turns for computer programs may help
        simplify &gt; scrambling &gt; &gt; programs, but mathematically I see
        the need for quarter turns to be &gt; &gt; the standard. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I know the number of turns needed to reach any position &gt;
        optimally, &gt; &gt; using quarter turns, is greater than 17. :^) &gt;
        &gt; That's true. It's also true of half turns. In fact, I have read
        that &gt; at least half the positions need at least 18 moves (with half
        turns). Interesting. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question is, if you can make
        any of 12 moves as the first &gt; turn, &gt; &gt; if you allow
        duplication then 12 moves is possible for each turn &gt; &gt; after... 2
        (12 ^ 17) is only slightly larger than the 43 quintilion &gt; &gt;
        possiblilites. Can you calculate the density of duplicate &gt; positions
        &gt; &gt; and find the minimun number of turns to reach every position?
        &gt; &gt; Well, one thing is that you can discount a lot of things e.g.
        RR', &gt; RLR can be made shorter (or in quarter turns RLR and RRL are
        the &gt; same at least). So, for instance you can insist that DU never
        occurs &gt; by replacing by UD etc. Thus 12^17 is very much an
        overestimate of &gt; the number of positions that can be reached in 17
        moves. I didn't mean unique positions, just positions reached by unique
        movement patterns. I've several algs for one corner swap. I know there
        is a lot of duplication. Yeah, I know one out of every 12 moves undoes
        the previous one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why not start with corner
        positions? Isn't the 2x2x2 solved? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for
        answering my questions. I appreciate it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J
        &gt; &gt; The 2x2x2 is indeed solved. Of course, moves that solve the
        2x2x2 &gt; don't necessarily only solve corners in the 3x3x3. For
        instance, &gt; some corner orientation moves in the 3x3x3 need 18 moves
        (half turn) &gt; but the 2x2x2 can always be done in 11 moves (half
        turn). How can that be? The most half turns need to move centers around
        is 4, so 11 + 4 = 15 not 18. What am I missing here? Plus don't you have
        opportunities in many of those 11 move solves to move a center by moving
        the opposite side? &gt; (I have got all the optimal algorithms for just
        orienting corners or &gt; just moving corners (without orientating)
        though.) Can I have a copy for perusal? David J

        to move centers around is &gt; 4, so 11 + 4 = 15 not 18. What am I
        missing here? Plus don't you have &gt; opportunities in many of those 11
        move solves to move a center by &gt; moving the opposite side? &gt; Some
        move the edges too? I meant just for solving corners alone when
        discussing moving the 2x2x2 over to the 3x3x3. &gt; &gt; (I have got all
        the optimal algorithms for just orienting corners or &gt; &gt; just
        moving corners (without orientating) though.) &gt; &gt; Can I have a
        copy for perusal? &gt; Not yet - saving them for BCFSSS! I will say
        this: of the 20160 orientation preserving corner permutations 636 take
        the maximum number of moves with half turns (16). The first according to
        the numbering scheme I am using is number 1029 which is the product of
        two transpositions and a 3-cycle: B2 L2 B2 D B2 D' L2 F2 D L2 D' F2 U B2
        R2 U' (2 4)(3 8)(5 6 7) Of the 2187 corner orientations, 32 take the
        maximum number of moves with half turns. (18) The first one is number
        451: D2 R2 B2 U' B2 D U B R2 F2 U B2 U2 F R2 B2 U' F //451 Of course,
        I'd prefer to go with quarter turns, but since I'm using Cube Explorer
        to get my algorithms and it does half turns that's what I'm stuck with.

        &gt; &gt; My question is this... If people want to get faster and work

        taught to orient all in 2 looks, &gt; &gt; then &gt; &gt; &gt; permute

        blindfolding is like learning a forgeign language. Let me expand:
        Generally speaking the most difficult language for most people to learn
        is their second. This is because few people fully understand how their
        native tongue really works until they have a second (3rd, 4th,...)
        language to compare and contrast. Thus when they learn their second
        language they end up learning 2 things at once - (a) a new language and
        (b) how their own language works. Similarly with blindfold cubing people
        are learning 2 things at once: (a) how to keep track of the pieces in
        their mind and (b) a different style of solution. I THINK PEOPLE WOULD
        FIND IT MUCH EASIER TO LEARN if they first practiced and familiarised
        themselves with the solution style with their eyes open before
        attempting it blindfolded. That way they would only have to contend with
        following the pieces in their mind along a famiiar route instead of
        trying to mentally follow the pieces while learning a new solution. -
        First learn how to orient all corners to the top and bottom (VERY EASY).
        Then practice moving the corners around without changng any of the edge
        pieces. Then practice orienting all the edge pieces (again very easy).
        Then learn how to manoever the edge pieces without changing any of the
        corners. This method can be learnt and mastered WITH YOUR EYES OPEN.
        Then and only then put the blindfold on and try to solve it in your
        head. Don't try to learn this new method while blindfolded - who would
        have ever considered learning how to solve the Petrus or Friedrich
        technique with their eyes closed??? I hope this helps people.
        Unfortunately I didn't know this while I was learning it so I had to
        figure it all out in my head as I went along, but as they say:
        "hindsight is 20/20" and it all seems so obvious to me now. Hopefully
        others can learn from my experience and learn it an easier way! Rob

        Yes, the 40 seconds refers to my average. But the lower you get...the
        harder it gets to get lower...it's definately a x^2 kind of graph in how
        hard it is to get better...until you reach infinity....lol. Whatever...I
        know I still have a lot of work to catch up to you all for the next
        rubiks WC...when will that be anyway? After i finish the PLLs...i only
        have like 3 to do..but i just keep pushing it off, I think i may work on
        transitioning to the Fridrich method, although, I'm not sure yet, or I
        may work on developing some kind of fridrich/petrus hybrid, because I
        really like the 2x2x2, and then i could place the last edge and other
        two things....or as a 2x2x2 block and an f2l pair or
        something....actually...i'm sure it has probably been done...but we'll
        see. Anyway, I'd like to thank Lars Peturs, Dan Knights, and Jessica
        Fridrich...my inspirations to get good at cubing. //Now that I'm past
        all of the thankings and the sentimentality, back to Tower of Hanoi I
        know that's a really slow time, I need to work on the algorith
        though...I would keep getting lost in the middle of the big stacks, and
        undo what i was moving...it's a little confusing, because basically
        you're just trying to think recursively. I'm sure I can beat
        that...maybe I"ll post it on speedcubing.com....if they let me...I mean
        it's not quite cubing, and easily beatable...but then I could be first
        at something. I'm sure that 7 minutes will be easily beaten
        though...It's just getting the pattern down, cuz it's very intuitive for
        the first 3, or 4, maybe 5...but after that, it gets kind of confusing,
        because you're keeping track of 7 things. Someone said something about
        getting the 7 move optimal solution for 3....that's pretty easy...but
        the optimal solution will always be solution=2^(number of discs) - 1 I'm
        curious...how mnay of you out there are computer science people...and
        how many are music people...and who are both? ~Joey Spadafora, 17,

        my &gt; &gt; &gt; best time was 7 mintutes, to do 7 discs. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My average is now about 40.01 with petrus, but with

        minutes as 40 seems rather slow. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, really
        you should play with 64 discs - that's the &gt; &gt; classical number.
        (Of course, with 65 discs the number of moves &gt; &gt; required is
        closest to the number of positions of the Rubik cube.)

        &gt; But the lower you get...the harder it gets to get lower...it's &gt;
        definately a x^2 kind of graph in how hard it is to get better...until
        &gt; you reach infinity....lol. Nerd momemnt: Well the best way I've
        found to model my progress is y=50.559*(.9985) ^x Where y is the time in
        seconds to solve the cube, and x is the number of days since my first
        recorded time... That is at day 0, I solved in 55.53 seconds, the
        formula returns 50.56s at day 105 I have a record of solving in 37.8s
        the formula returns 43.5, Day 231, 38.79 formula=36.38 day 399, 32.52
        formula=28.64. Okay, okay it's not exact, but with as scattered as the
        data points are, it's the best I've come up with yet. Today is around
        day 530. And the neat thing is, you can actually predict solves: by day
        651 (around April) it predicts a 20 second average, by day 807, a 16s
        average, by day 2754 (7.5 years from now) a 1s average... oh wait, that
        probably isn't right. I know it's sloppy and completely non-scientific,
        but it's a reasonable average representation of my history and I think a
        reasonable prediction of the near future. I'm done with all my finals...

        of the Bumblebee gave me 21 seconds, and I think it would have been
        sub-20 if I hadn't popped. With White Noise I got 22, another good time.
        So I think that music is definitely connected. It probably just clears
        your mind and lets you focus more. Oh, and in case anyone's wondering,
        listening to bagpipes I got 35 seconds. Darn those scotsmen. --- In

        Yes their new web forms are not too reliable. To answer the other guy's
        question, I have just recieved a new 4x4 from them yesterday. It took
        about 2 weeks to ship. I'm very happy with the quality of their
        Eastsheen 4x4... I just lubed it and set a new PB of 2:23! I'm still
        looking for the illusive algorithm to fix both parity problems
        symutaneously though. The internal mechanism is quite suprising... I
        took it apart and it broke off into 120 pieces, not counting screws!
        Reassembling it was a bit challenging. As for their service, I think
        it's always been bad, at least for me. But I think it has gotten better

        I just got a new 4x4 yesterday and I am very in to it now! It's driving
        me crazy. I'm breaking my PB again and again today. Almost at the 2
        minute mark for a single time. This time around I'm using a modified
        centers/edge-pairing/3x3/parity-fix method and getting to like it. I
        timed myself doing the first 2 steps (making it into a 3x3) and got a
        1:22 and a 1:19. Solving centers alone takes me about 40s. It took me
        59s to solve the 3x3 with parity errors. I thought that was odd, so I
        timed just the 3x3 w/o parity and that took me about 38s. Then a couple
        consecutive trials flipping a single edge at the end... 16s and 14s. So
        my question is, where am I wasting the most time? How long does it take
        some of you to flip a single edge (late)? How much slower should a cuber
        be at solving a segmented-4x4 then the 3x3, if at all? Actually, I'd
        like to know how sub-2min people here (*who use this method*) average in
        each of these steps, if it's not too much of a trouble. Also, for those
        that use Eastsheen 4x4s, my brand new on keeps falling loose during
        solving. I almost have to re-tighten it after every solve. (If I leave
        it loose some of the inside edge-locking pieces might misalign and
        prevent certain turns.) Has anyone else had that problem? Is there
        anything I can do to prevent it? Any advice would be apprieciated! -Doug

        time. This time around I'm using a &gt; modified
        centers/edge-pairing/3x3/parity-fix method and getting to &gt; like it.
        &gt; &gt; I timed myself doing the first 2 steps (making it into a 3x3)
        and &gt; got a 1:22 and a 1:19. Solving centers alone takes me about
        40s. It &gt; took me 59s to solve the 3x3 with parity errors. I thought
        that was &gt; odd, so I timed just the 3x3 w/o parity and that took me
        about 38s. &gt; Then a couple consecutive trials flipping a single edge
        at the &gt; end... 16s and 14s. &gt; &gt; So my question is, where am I
        wasting the most time? How long does &gt; it take some of you to flip a
        single edge (late)? I'm very much out of practice but I just did 7
        seconds on oinkleburger for the edge flip and 3 seconds for switch 2
        edges. I think with practice and a better mouse a much better time is
        possible. &gt; How much slower &gt; should a cuber be at solving a
        segmented-4x4 then the 3x3, if at &gt; all? Assuming you don't get
        either of the above situations not much difference. You may have to have
        a split second to realize that you don't need to fix anything but other
        than that it's the same puzzle so the main issue is that it is easier to
        break a 4x4x4! I guess I'm probably faster on a 4x4x4 when I get to this
        stage for two reasons: 1) The centres are bigger so I am less likley to
        put the cross in the wrong order. 2) I can build part of the 3x3x3 up
        whilst solving the centres. Another benefit for me is that, since I
        usually need two orientations sometimes, if I need to flip an edge, I
        can get myself to a one step orientation (as there is a choice of edges
        to flip) and so not take up much more time than if I didn't have to flip
        an edge but needed to orient in two steps. It's difficult to know what
        you mean by "modified centers", so I can't add much there. Try to flip
        the edge at the start of the LL and switch the edges before PLL (if you
        need to do these steps). &gt;Actually, I'd like to know how sub-2min
        people here (*who use &gt; this method*) average in each of these steps,
        if it's not too much &gt; of a trouble. Not sure if our methods are the
        same. I'd guess that on a good day on oinkleburger (it's been a while
        since I had one of those) I could get the centres solved and edges
        paired in 35-40 seconds, because usually the 3x3x3 on oinkleburger would
        take me over 30 seconds so for a sub-70 solve I'd probably be in that
        area. My guess is that you can probably pick up a bit of time on the
        centres, depending on which way you do them. Which way do you pair up
        the edges? I try to get 3 done at a time for the first 6 and then 2 at a
        time for the next 4 (and hope that I don't have just 2 left as that is a
        bit more time consuming). &gt; &gt; Also, for those that use Eastsheen
        4x4s, my brand new on keeps &gt; falling loose during solving. I almost
        have to re-tighten it after &gt; every solve. (If I leave it loose some
        of the inside edge-locking &gt; pieces might misalign and prevent
        certain turns.) Has anyone else &gt; had that problem? Is there anything
        I can do to prevent it? &gt; &gt; Any advice would be apprieciated! &gt;

        Doug, good to see you getting into the 4x4, it's a very fun puzzle! I
        took some averages of my steps, and here's what I got. Centers: 15.73
        17.82 27.06 14.17 16.52 21.52 20.97 23.40 19.69 20.63 12.84 23.87 =
        19.43 Edges: 40.65 (27.30) 31.48 38.12 37.22 31.06 45.08 37.92 35.33
        40.67 43.06 (56.12) = 38.06 Solve as a 3x3x3 [39.74(o)] 36.55(-)
        32.82(-) 27.57(-) 37.51(p) 33.83(p) 32.40(o) 37.33(o) 28.72(-)
        [23.80(-)] 33.66(o) 29.76(p) = 33.02 (p) means I ran into the
        permutation parity and (o) means I ran into the orientation parity. (-)
        means a normal 3x3x3 solve. I had no double parities this average.
        Personally I find that most of the variation in my times comes from the
        edges step, slowest time 56.12 and fastest 27.30. I'm still working hard
        on trying to improve that, but personally that is where I lose most of
        my time. From your information it seems it takes you around 40 seconds
        to solve the edges, which is what I pull too. I would guess then that
        you're probably losing your time on the centers step and segmented 3x3x3
        step. Also around 15 seconds for the orientation parity is a lot of time
        to add when it comes up. You might want to try this move for the parity,
        it is much easier to perform quickly. (R ¬≤ r ¬≤) B ¬≤ U ¬≤ (L l) U ¬≤ (R' r
        ') U ¬≤ (R r) U ¬≤ F ¬≤ (R r) F ¬≤ (L ' l ') B ¬≤ (R ¬≤ r ¬≤) Each pair of
        moves in parenthesis can be performed at the same time. I took an
        average doing this move and I average between 6 and 6.5 seconds to
        perform this speed solve move, so maybe this move might help. If you're
        already using this move, then I would just recommend finding the fastest
        way to perform it for your hands. I find it hard to use finger tricks
        for this move on the 4x4x4, so I would recommend mostly using the
        fastest type wrist turns you can find that fit your hands. To help with
        solving it as a 3x3x3 I recommend just scrambling it as a 3x3x3 and
        solving it - a lot. After a while your hands get used to the different
        feel and you start to feel just like your solving a 3x3x3 when you do
        it, though of course it is still a bit slower because it is harder to
        trigger faces, at least for me. Also I've gotten some very fast times on
        the Eastsheen cubes, but I find it a little annoying that they stick if
        they're not really well aligned. It is much easier to perform finger
        tricks on an Eastsheen though. I'm still trying to so see which cube I
        like better, rubiks.com or Eastsheen since both seem to have pros and
        cons. Anyway, like any cube I would just recommend a lot of practice to
        improve. I guess just work on getting used to where the centers go, so
        you can do the centers quickly. Also practice solving the centers for
        fewest moves (no timer) to get used to different strategies that help
        save time. Then just try to get your hands used to doing the 4x4x4 as a
        3x3x3 since it moves different than a normal 3x3x3. Just by doing that I
        think you could easily get under 2 min on average, not just as a pb.
        Good luck to you, and I know you'll make it under 2 min. Happy cubing,

        4x4x4 as a 3x3x3 since it moves different than a &gt; normal 3x3x3. Just
        by doing that I think you could easily get under &gt; 2 min on average,
        not just as a pb. &gt; &gt; Good luck to you, and I know you'll make it

        and I am very in to it now! It's &gt; &gt; driving me crazy. I'm
        breaking my PB again and again today. Almost &gt; &gt; at the 2 minute
        mark for a single time. This time around I'm using &gt; a &gt; &gt;
        modified centers/edge-pairing/3x3/parity-fix method and getting to &gt;
        &gt; like it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I timed myself doing the first 2 steps
        (making it into a 3x3) and &gt; &gt; got a 1:22 and a 1:19. Solving
        centers alone takes me about 40s. &gt; It &gt; &gt; took me 59s to solve
        the 3x3 with parity errors. I thought that &gt; was &gt; &gt; odd, so I
        timed just the 3x3 w/o parity and that took me about &gt; 38s. &gt; &gt;
        Then a couple consecutive trials flipping a single edge at the &gt; &gt;
        end... 16s and 14s. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So my question is, where am I
        wasting the most time? How long does &gt; &gt; it take some of you to
        flip a single edge (late)? How much slower &gt; &gt; should a cuber be
        at solving a segmented-4x4 then the 3x3, if at &gt; &gt; all? Actually,
        I'd like to know how sub-2min people here (*who use &gt; &gt; this
        method*) average in each of these steps, if it's not too much &gt; &gt;
        of a trouble. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, for those that use Eastsheen
        4x4s, my brand new on keeps &gt; &gt; falling loose during solving. I
        almost have to re-tighten it after &gt; &gt; every solve. (If I leave it
        loose some of the inside edge- locking &gt; &gt; pieces might misalign
        and prevent certain turns.) Has anyone else &gt; &gt; had that problem?
        Is there anything I can do to prevent it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any advice
        would be apprieciated! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug Li I suck at the
        centers, takes me forever, very rare that it's under a minute question:
        how do you start your centers, do you always start with the same color?
        then do the reverse side etc...or do you just do what you see first?

        Just found a third mistake but they might overlap now: 1. The two

        edges Did I miss something? Oh right, both the red/blue/green corner and
        the centers together with the picture of the solved cube seem to
        indicate that green is opposite yellow. Then the red/white corner
        implies that white is opposite blue, but then there's also a blue/white

        I can assert to this as well. Music helps me concentrate a lot better,
        both when I'm cubing, and while I'm playing Tetris, pertaining to the
        recent posts about it. (I can do it quite well, but nowhere near as good
        as that guy in the video ^-^) Often while I'm listening to certain music
        that I particularly enjoy I do both a lot better, and with sometimes

        I'm interested in Chris's answer to this one, but just as a comparison,
        I start with where ever I see the most of one color done. If I see 3
        reds together I start there first and plan out how to do finsh red while
        leaving myself in a good situation for the opposite color. I do opposite
        colors together, I find it gives me a lot of flexiblity. I can get the
        first pair of centers in a few seconds, and doing the 3rd one is then
        very easy. I'm trying to get used to the situations for the last center
        pair. I think I do it this way because I'm using a 4x4 with a color
        scheme I'm not used to... I always was a few seconds thinking about the
        placement of the last two centers relative to the others and still
        occasioanlly make mistakes that I have to fix when I'm doing the cross
        for the 3x3. And yes, I said CROSS. Not that there's anything wrong with
        it, but it's just not how I usually solve a 3x3. It seems that right
        after edge pairing, I PANIC and revert to doing a Fridrich F2L. That's
        something I need to work on. When I get more used to the color scheme,
        I'll probably start doing what Chris does and solve centers in such a
        way that the last two are adjecent to each other. If it was my own
        color-scheme I could do Akimoto's method on it or at least be more
        comfortable solving the segmented 3x3. I have 3 4x4 cubes, and only one
        I re-schemed. It is currently broken. I want to average under 2:30 with
        the center/edge/3x3 method first then work on Akimoto method again.
        (Sort of doing what Gilles does with being fluent with multiple
        methods.) I got a few more days of finals then I can go back to cubing,
        hardcore! I see all these people improving and getting faster then me
        while I have been stuck floating just above 20s for the past 4 month.
        (It seems like and eternaty.) I guess my time arn't supposed to go down
        when I'm trying new stuff and learning new algorithms, so I've decided
        to stop doing that for now... I can still improvise a good Z-B c/e
        pairing sometimes without learning all of the algs. The first item on my
        to do list is to get sub-30 on solving centers. -Doug Li (now averaging

        Hey Doug (and ther 4x4x4 enthousiasts), For both the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 I
        start with the centers and I start with the same approach to the
        centers. I basically follow CHRIS' approach for both 4x4x4 and 5x5x5
        [[thanks for the notes on speedcubing.com Chris]] and I don't claim to
        have 'invented' the following sequence for solving the centers. In fact,
        I am sure that many others out there do something very similar. I just
        find that it works well for me. Both my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes have the
        'standard' (?) colour scheme - ie. white/yellow, blue/green, and
        red/orange. (i) I start with whatever colour happens to be most
        advantageous --- For example - WHITE (but it could be ANY colour) (ii) I
        then solve its opposite. I like this because it still leaves me a ton of
        flexibility in the 'middle' (ie - the u and d slices) of the cube since
        I keep my two solved sides on the U and D faces. --- For example -
        YELLOW (and ONLY yellow) (iii) I solve whatever is most avantageous of
        the remaining four sets of centers. *** note of interest - it usually
        takes me fewer moves to solve the third center set that it does the
        second center set. This is not really supprising since the second set
        has a predetermined colour and location but the third center set takes
        advantage of the flexibility of the 'middle' rows. --- For example BLUE
        (but could equally be GREEN, RED, or ORANGE) (iv) I then solve one of
        the two adjacent 'middle' centers. To be totally clear - if my first
        center is U and its opposite is D. Let the third center be F (though it
        could be held in L,R, or B whatever you prefer) but if it is in F then
        the fourth will be either L or R whichever is easier. I find this makes
        the last step easier. Of course, there is nothing to prevent you from
        solving the opposite to the third center (ie B) but that would mean that
        when solving the fifth and sixth centers you are dealing with opposite
        faces of the cube. If your fourth center is adjacent to your third then
        the fifth and sixth centers will also be adjacent to each other and I
        find that this helps with both recognition and move economy (quarter
        turns instead of half turns). On the 4x4 the centers flow freely all
        around the mechanism. I pause for just a split second at the start of
        step (iv) to figure out which colour belongs here (since you already
        know U,D,and F it is easy to figure out what belongs in L or R). Once
        this is figured out the fifth and sixth centers are no-brainers (the
        opposites of three and four respectively). If you solve the fourth
        opposite the third then you simply postpone this ESSENTIAL recognition
        one step. --- For example - RED (But it could equally be ORANGE) (v)
        solve the fifth and sixth centers (simultaneously - obviously) --- For
        example - GREEN and ORANGE Using this approach I can easily solve the
        centers between 30 - 35 secs (and there is definately room for
        improvement there as I am not turning my fragile 4x4 at warp speed).
        Some notes I took indicate that this scheme takes me approximately 28 -
        34 moves to complete. Some center tips that I find useful: - it is often
        easier to unite pairs of center cubies and then join 2 pairs to make a
        soloved center. - as you slide your second pair in to complete your
        first center have a quick look at its opposite face to see if any cubies
        are already correctly placed - similarly as you slide the second pair of
        cubies into the third set of centers see if you can get a headstart on
        the fourth set. - I have found no advantage to starting with a
        particular center colour. I do always start my 3x3x3 solves with a white
        cross to make F2L recognition easier but since the centers deal with
        monocromatic tiles there is no recognition advantage to sarting with
        white centers. By the time I get to solving the 4x4x4 as a 3x3x3 I do
        start with a white cross. I find that what slows me down most on the 4x4
        and 5x5 is (FINDING!!!) and uniting those elusive edge pieces. [[though
        many thanks to GRANT for posting some VERY HELPFUL tips for uniting the
        9 - 12 edge pairs. - definately worth a check through the archives for
        these if you are interested in 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 times]] I have also
        experimented with a different approach to 4x4 centers but it didn't work
        out so I scrapped it. Basically, I thought it may be easier to initially
        solve the centers into 12 pairs of 2 center cubies (because this could
        quickly take maximum advantage of common colours on adjacent faces) and
        then unite the relevant pairs to form 6 centers. This didn't seem work
        out for me either in terms of times or number of moves though I don't
        have any specific notes on this to compare with the notes for the scheme
        outlined above. You probably don't want to waste time on this approach
        so I mention it more as a precaution than a suggestion (but who knows,
        maybe someone can get it to work?) Have fun on the 4x4x4. Rob

        Hello, has somebody tried to compare the "centers-edges-3x3x3" approach
        to solve the 4x4x4 with the method described by Waterman? I mean: 1)
        L-face except for one edge-pair 2) R-corners at once (as for 3x3x3
        corners-first method) 3) R-edge-pairs + last L-edge-pair (few short
        sequences) 4) DF and DB edge-pairs (few short sequences) 5) UF and UB
        edge-pairs (special sequences) 6) 5 remaining centers (easy 3-cycle and
        2-swap sequences) The interesting thing is that you need not worry about
        parity so the times should be more consistent. Waterman averaged about
        90 seconds using this technique in the time when he was averaging 18
        sec. on 3x3x3, so maybe it was even less later. Has somebody other info
        about this method and its progress? Josef

        I solve the centers very similar to how Rob does it. First I find the
        opposite center pair that is in the best position to be solved quickly.
        This is sort of like learning to solve the cross quickly, practice a lot
        (speed and for fewest moves) to find strategies you like and this will
        become automatic. Then I place the two solved centers on U and D and I
        solve two adjacent centers. The difference though is that I have spent a
        lot of time memorizing the color scheme of my cube, so I don't have to
        take any time to think about how to place the centers. This helps
        considerably to reduce recognition time. After I get the second pair of
        centers, I solve the last pair of adjacent centers. Again, having worked
        on memorizing the color scheme and knowing that the last two colors are
        in the same position as the previous two, just interchange the opposite
        colors in my head, then I know where the other centers have to go even
        before I'm finished with the 2nd pair of centers. Also I recommend
        practicing all the cases that come up for the last two centers for
        fewest moves (no timer) and try to find the fastest way to do each case.
        Once you don't have to think about what to do for each case, and you
        already know where the colors go before you get to that step, then you
        can blaze through this last part. The real secret for solving the
        centers quickly, I think, is to reduce recognition time. I think working
        on this alone will bring you very fast center solving times. I would
        definitely recommend thoroughly memorizing the color scheme of your cube
        (i.e. what colors are on L and R if color X is on U and color Y is on
        F). This helps considerably for reducing your times. My $0.02, Chris ---

        I do it this way because I'm using a 4x4 with a color scheme &gt; I'm
        not used to... I always was a few seconds thinking about the &gt;

        wrong with it, but it's just not how I usually solve a 3x3. It seems
        &gt; that right after edge pairing, I PANIC and revert to doing a &gt;
        Fridrich F2L. That's something I need to work on. When I get more &gt;

        and solve centers in such a way that the last two are adjecent to &gt;
        each other. If it was my own color-scheme I could do Akimoto's &gt;
        method on it or at least be more comfortable solving the segmented &gt;

        got a few more days of finals then I can go back to cubing, &gt;

        Hi GoD2, &gt; Well, it's before twice the current prime. (i.e. for any
        prime p there is a prime q with p&lt;q&lt;2p) It would have to be,
        wouldn't it? &gt; Yes, but if you add things up in a different order you
        can get a different answer. Right, the order is important. I though that
        it could be graphed and the different projections could be tested. &gt;
        How can that be? The most half turns need to move centers around is 4,
        so 11 + 4 = 15 not 18. What am I missing here? Plus don't you have
        opportunities in many of those 11 move solves to move a center by moving
        the opposite side? &lt; &gt; Some move the edges too? I meant just for
        solving corners alone when discussing moving the 2x2x2 over to the
        3x3x3. OK. I meant disregarding the edges, for a corners-first approach.
        Then: Using a computer program you could then look at how the edges
        moved while solving the corners, looking for those small adjustments
        that could be made during a corner solve which move the edges
        appropriately. Separately you could take the edges-first approach.
        What's the fewest number of moves to solve an edge only cube
        disregarding effects to the corners? (Like taking the stickers off all
        the corners.) What's the fewest number of moves to solve the edges while
        not disturbing the corners. (Now the computer can solve it blindfolded!
        :^) ) &gt; Not yet - saving them for BCFSSS! What's BCFSSS! ? &gt; of
        the 20160 orientation preserving corner permutations 636 take the
        maximum number of moves with half turns (16). The first according to the
        numbering scheme I am using is number 1029 which is the product of two
        transpositions and a 3-cycle: &gt; B2 L2 B2 D B2 D' L2 F2 D L2 D' F2 U
        B2 R2 U' (2 4)(3 8)(5 6 7) &gt; Of the 2187 corner orientations, 32 take
        the maximum number of moves with half turns. (18) The first one is
        number 451: &gt; D2 R2 B2 U' B2 D U B R2 F2 U B2 U2 F R2 B2 U' F //451
        Interesting examples. In both cases, a smaller percentage than I
        expected. Excellent feedback. Thanks, DJ --- In

        Consider all positive integers as points on a short, but &gt; very &gt;

        make it a wave that &gt; intersects &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every other
        point, then the number three make a wave &gt; intersecting &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; every third point, then the number 5, then 7 and so forth. I
        &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking for the density of the non-prime
        numbers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's known as the sieve of
        Erastosthenes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder how many people have thought
        of it since he did. &gt; &gt; Lots - it's not very fast though. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One useful observation is
        that perhaps some version of an &gt; &gt; &gt; equation &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; like 1 - 1/2 - 1/3 - 1/5 could be employed to give the density &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; directly. Am I making sense? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; That sum diverges to -infinity. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So that's what
        you call that aspect. HMMM I was hoping that there &gt; &gt; might
        already be a technique for diping into an equation that &gt; contains
        &gt; &gt; an infinity, like plugging in a prime and getting a rough idea
        as &gt; to &gt; &gt; where the next prime might fall. &gt; &gt; Well,
        it's before twice the current prime. (i.e. for any prime p &gt; there is
        a prime q with p&lt;q&lt;2p) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The one in
        the other post doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; really work as density either
        because the sum is not absolutely &gt; &gt; &gt; convergent, so the
        order in which terms are added affects the &gt; &gt; &gt; answer. In
        fact, since it isn't absolutely convergent but only &gt; &gt; &gt;
        conditionally convergent, any answer can be achieved by adding &gt; in
        &gt; &gt; &gt; different orders. Since the density is looking at the
        limit of &gt; &gt; &gt; pi(x)/x, there's no particular reason to look at
        adding 1/6 &gt; before &gt; &gt; &gt; subtracting 1/5 etc. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I don't quite follow. If 2 takes out every other number and
        &gt; three &gt; &gt; takes out every third number, then all the numbers
        divisible by 6 &gt; are &gt; &gt; accounted for twice. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Yes, but if you add things up in a different order you can get a
        &gt; different answer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        There are lots of possible questions. The main one in terms &gt; of &gt;
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubik's cube would be to find the
        most moves needed to solve &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; (the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; diameter) or the average number of moves to solve the cube.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This depends on what you count as a move. For
        instance, if &gt; we &gt; &gt; &gt; allow &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any
        of the quarter turns (but nothing else) to count as 1 &gt; move &gt;
        &gt; &gt; we'd &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get one answer. If we also allow
        half turns to count as 1 &gt; move &gt; &gt; &gt; we'd &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; get a (probably different) answer. If we allow moves like FB
        &gt; or &gt; &gt; &gt; FB' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to count as one move
        we'd get yet another answer. If we only &gt; &gt; &gt; allow &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves a minimal generating set (two moves as opposed
        to &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usual 6 quarter moves or 12 quarter
        and half moves) then &gt; we'd &gt; &gt; &gt; get a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; very much larger answer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        For notation I count all moves as one, including slices, and &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; allowing half turns for computer programs may help simplify
        &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambling &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; programs, but
        mathematically I see the need for quarter turns &gt; to be &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; the standard. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know
        the number of turns needed to reach any position &gt; &gt; &gt;
        optimally, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using quarter turns, is greater than 17.
        :^) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's true. It's also true of half
        turns. In fact, I have read &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; at least half the
        positions need at least 18 moves (with half &gt; turns). &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Interesting. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My
        question is, if you can make any of 12 moves as the first &gt; &gt; &gt;
        turn, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if you allow duplication then 12 moves is
        possible for each &gt; turn &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after... 2 (12 ^ 17) is
        only slightly larger than the 43 &gt; quintilion &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        possiblilites. Can you calculate the density of duplicate &gt; &gt; &gt;
        positions &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and find the minimun number of turns to
        reach every position? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, one thing is
        that you can discount a lot of things e.g. &gt; RR', &gt; &gt; &gt; RLR
        can be made shorter (or in quarter turns RLR and RRL are the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; same at least). So, for instance you can insist that DU never &gt;
        occurs &gt; &gt; &gt; by replacing by UD etc. Thus 12^17 is very much an
        overestimate &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; the number of positions that can be
        reached in 17 moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't mean unique positions,
        just positions reached by unique &gt; &gt; movement patterns. I've
        several algs for one corner swap. I know &gt; there &gt; &gt; is a lot
        of duplication. Yeah, I know one out of every 12 moves &gt; undoes &gt;
        &gt; the previous one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Why not start with corner positions? Isn't the 2x2x2
        solved? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for answering my
        questions. I appreciate it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        David J &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The 2x2x2 is indeed solved. Of
        course, moves that solve the &gt; 2x2x2 &gt; &gt; &gt; don't necessarily
        only solve corners in the 3x3x3. For instance, &gt; &gt; &gt; some
        corner orientation moves in the 3x3x3 need 18 moves (half &gt; turn)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; but the 2x2x2 can always be done in 11 moves (half turn).
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How can that be? The most half turns need to move
        centers &gt; around is &gt; &gt; 4, so 11 + 4 = 15 not 18. What am I
        missing here? Plus don't you &gt; have &gt; &gt; opportunities in many
        of those 11 move solves to move a center by &gt; &gt; moving the
        opposite side? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some move the edges too? I meant just
        for solving corners alone when &gt; discussing moving the 2x2x2 over to
        the 3x3x3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I have got all the optimal algorithms
        for just orienting &gt; corners or &gt; &gt; &gt; just moving corners
        (without orientating) though.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can I have a copy for
        perusal? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not yet - saving them for BCFSSS! I will
        say this: of the 20160 &gt; orientation preserving corner permutations
        636 take the maximum &gt; number of moves with half turns (16). The
        first according to the &gt; numbering scheme I am using is number 1029
        which is the product of &gt; two transpositions and a 3-cycle: &gt; B2
        L2 B2 D B2 D' L2 F2 D L2 D' F2 U B2 R2 U' (2 4)(3 8)(5 6 7) &gt; &gt; Of

        can't be interpreted as a density. Similarly there will be another &gt;
        permutation where they sum to -53+e, which also can't be interpreted
        &gt; as a density. Also, for some permutations the sum will not
        converge, &gt; but will rather diverge and so on. It's not the most
        intuitive of &gt; results.) Why not add and subtract them in numerical
        order? That's how they fall naturally. As each additional prime occurs
        you take the measure of it and compare it to the previous measurements,
        and make projections. Compare the projections to the actual values (the
        next primes) and rank projection schemes according to their success
        rates. I relise that this is a lot of work, but that's what computers
        were invented for, wasn't it? David J

        I do the 4x4x4 in the following order: 1. top and bottom centers (white

        top and bottom edges except one pair...looking ahead...looking for easy
        pairs when possible... 5. last edge pair...putting the one different
        middle layers, if necessary...then insert them together... 6. a simple
        sequence repeated 3 times to get edges on one middle layer...then
        another sequence for the last edge on that layer... 7. then another
        simple sequence executed once fixes the middle edges on the other final
        middle layer...most of the time...sometimes, I have to do it twice... 8.
        centers on 4 sides are then completed using simple 3 cycles...usually
        about 5 of these cycles are necessary... I used this method to average
        about 2:10 20 years ago...I have decided to get better than that this

        some other thoughts about the 4x4x4: 1. using my method, I can sometimes
        do some good things to the centers as I finish the middle layer
        edges...that is, place some centers correctly to cut down on the number
        of 3-cycles that I have to do at the end. 2. I have never had a decent
        4x4x4 cube...the one i use now is very loose...and has to be handled
        very carefully to keep it from popping...I am sure someone with quick
        hands and a good cube could use a method similar to mine to average
        under 2 minutes easily... 3. I have "lost" certain algorithms that I
        used to use years ago... I need to reinvent some things to get back to
        where I used to be... but I think averaging under 2:00 would be
        cool...so I am going to work at it again... Bill

        Yes, but it's not completely trivial:
        http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~rjc/etc/bertrand.pdf &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but
        if you add things up in a different order you can get a &gt; different
        answer. &gt; &gt; Right, the order is important. I though that it could
        be graphed &gt; and the different projections could be tested. What do
        you mean by "projections could be tested"? What are the projections and
        what would the test be? &gt; &gt; &gt; How can that be? The most half
        turns need to move centers &gt; around is 4, so 11 + 4 = 15 not 18. What
        am I missing here? Plus don't &gt; you have opportunities in many of
        those 11 move solves to move a &gt; center by moving the opposite side?
        &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some move the edges too? I meant just for solving
        corners alone when &gt; discussing moving the 2x2x2 over to the 3x3x3.
        &gt; &gt; OK. I meant disregarding the edges, for a corners-first
        approach. &gt; Then: Using a computer program you could then look at how
        the edges &gt; moved while solving the corners, looking for those small
        adjustments &gt; that could be made during a corner solve which move the
        edges &gt; appropriately. Yes, that could be done - it will give an
        upper bound, but maybe not the best one as it is a method of going to
        one subgroup fast and then solving in that subgroup (much like the
        2-stage algorithm doesn't always get an optimal solution). &gt; &gt;
        Separately you could take the edges-first approach. What's the &gt;
        fewest number of moves to solve an edge only cube disregarding effects
        &gt; to the corners? (Like taking the stickers off all the corners.)
        &gt; What's the fewest number of moves to solve the edges while not &gt;
        disturbing the corners. (Now the computer can solve it blindfolded! :^)
        ) &gt; &gt; &gt; Not yet - saving them for BCFSSS! &gt; &gt; What's

        sieve of Erastosthenes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder how many
        people have thought of it since he did. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lots - it's
        not very fast though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One useful observation is that perhaps some version
        of an &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equation &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like 1 - 1/2
        - 1/3 - 1/5 could be employed to give the density &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; directly. Am I making sense? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; That sum diverges to -infinity. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So
        that's what you call that aspect. HMMM I was hoping that there &gt; &gt;
        &gt; might already be a technique for diping into an equation that &gt;
        &gt; contains &gt; &gt; &gt; an infinity, like plugging in a prime and
        getting a rough idea as &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; where the next prime
        might fall. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it's before twice the current
        prime. (i.e. for any prime p &gt; &gt; there is a prime q with
        p&lt;q&lt;2p) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The one in
        the other post doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really work as density either
        because the sum is not absolutely &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convergent, so the
        order in which terms are added affects the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answer.
        In fact, since it isn't absolutely convergent but only &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; conditionally convergent, any answer can be achieved by adding &gt;
        &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different orders. Since the density is
        looking at the limit of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pi(x)/x, there's no
        particular reason to look at adding 1/6 &gt; &gt; before &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; subtracting 1/5 etc. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't quite
        follow. If 2 takes out every other number and &gt; &gt; three &gt; &gt;
        &gt; takes out every third number, then all the numbers divisible by 6
        &gt; &gt; are &gt; &gt; &gt; accounted for twice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but if you add things up in a different order you
        can get a &gt; &gt; different answer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are lots of possible questions. The
        main one in terms &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubik's cube would be to find the most moves needed to
        solve &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; diameter) or the average number of moves to solve the cube. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This depends on what you count as a move. For
        instance, if &gt; &gt; we &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; any of the quarter turns (but nothing else) to count as 1 &gt;
        &gt; move &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we'd &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get one
        answer. If we also allow half turns to count as 1 &gt; &gt; move &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; we'd &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get a (probably
        different) answer. If we allow moves like FB &gt; &gt; or &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; FB' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to count as one move we'd get yet
        another answer. If we only &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; ourselves a minimal generating set (two moves as opposed to
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usual 6 quarter moves or 12
        quarter and half moves) then &gt; &gt; we'd &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get a
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very much larger answer. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For notation I count all moves as
        one, including slices, and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allowing half turns
        for computer programs may help simplify &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambling
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; programs, but mathematically I see the need for
        quarter turns &gt; &gt; to be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the standard.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know the number of
        turns needed to reach any position &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optimally, &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using quarter turns, is greater than 17. :^) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's true. It's also true of half
        turns. In fact, I have read &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at least
        half the positions need at least 18 moves (with half &gt; &gt; turns).
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interesting. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question is, if you can make any
        of 12 moves as the first &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turn, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; if you allow duplication then 12 moves is possible for each &gt;
        &gt; turn &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after... 2 (12 ^ 17) is only slightly
        larger than the 43 &gt; &gt; quintilion &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        possiblilites. Can you calculate the density of duplicate &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; positions &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and find the minimun number of
        turns to reach every position? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Well, one thing is that you can discount a lot of things e.g. &gt; &gt;
        RR', &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RLR can be made shorter (or in quarter turns
        RLR and RRL are the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same at least). So, for instance
        you can insist that DU never &gt; &gt; occurs &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by
        replacing by UD etc. Thus 12^17 is very much an overestimate &gt; &gt;
        of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the number of positions that can be reached in 17
        moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't mean unique positions,
        just positions reached by unique &gt; &gt; &gt; movement patterns. I've
        several algs for one corner swap. I know &gt; &gt; there &gt; &gt; &gt;
        is a lot of duplication. Yeah, I know one out of every 12 moves &gt;
        &gt; undoes &gt; &gt; &gt; the previous one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why not
        start with corner positions? Isn't the 2x2x2 solved? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for answering my questions. I
        appreciate it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The 2x2x2 is indeed solved. Of
        course, moves that solve the &gt; &gt; 2x2x2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't
        necessarily only solve corners in the 3x3x3. For instance, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; some corner orientation moves in the 3x3x3 need 18 moves (half
        &gt; &gt; turn) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the 2x2x2 can always be done in
        11 moves (half turn). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How can that be? The
        most half turns need to move centers &gt; &gt; around is &gt; &gt; &gt;
        4, so 11 + 4 = 15 not 18. What am I missing here? Plus don't you &gt;
        &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunities in many of those 11 move solves
        to move a center by &gt; &gt; &gt; moving the opposite side? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some move the edges too? I meant just for
        solving corners alone when &gt; &gt; discussing moving the 2x2x2 over to
        the 3x3x3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I have got all the optimal
        algorithms for just orienting &gt; &gt; corners or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        just moving corners (without orientating) though.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Can I have a copy for perusal? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Not yet - saving them for BCFSSS! I will say this: of the 20160
        &gt; &gt; orientation preserving corner permutations 636 take the
        maximum &gt; &gt; number of moves with half turns (16). The first
        according to the &gt; &gt; numbering scheme I am using is number 1029
        which is the product of &gt; &gt; two transpositions and a 3-cycle: &gt;
        &gt; B2 L2 B2 D B2 D' L2 F2 D L2 D' F2 U B2 R2 U' (2 4)(3 8)(5 6 7) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Of the 2187 corner orientations, 32 take the maximum
        number of moves &gt; &gt; with half turns. (18) &gt; &gt; The first one

        R2 B2 U' F //451 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, I'd prefer to go with
        quarter turns, but since I'm using &gt; &gt; Cube Explorer to get my
        algorithms and it does half turns that's &gt; &gt; what I'm stuck with.

        A3|]...+(-1)^(n-1)*|A1 i A2 i ... i An| &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Where i means the intersection of the sets and |...|means the &gt; &gt;
        number &gt; &gt; &gt; of elements in the (intersection of the) set(s).
        This avoids &gt; &gt; double &gt; &gt; &gt; counting as you noticed.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think he already had that (see 8035). Perhaps the
        problem is with &gt; &gt; the fact that adding things up in different
        orders can yield &gt; &gt; different results, so that it depends where
        you add the 1/6 back in &gt; &gt; for instance. (Not specifically the
        1/6, but the point is that if &gt; &gt; you take permutations sigma, tau
        of the summands here then the sums &gt; &gt; sum sigma(n) and sum tau(n)
        may be different. Indeed, for instance, &gt; &gt; there will be a
        permutation where they sum to pi, which of course &gt; &gt; can't be
        interpreted as a density. Similarly there will be another &gt; &gt;
        permutation where they sum to -53+e, which also can't be interpreted
        &gt; &gt; as a density. Also, for some permutations the sum will not
        converge, &gt; &gt; but will rather diverge and so on. It's not the most
        intuitive of &gt; &gt; results.) &gt; &gt; Why not add and subtract them
        in numerical order? That's how they &gt; fall naturally. &gt; That's not
        actually true because for each fraction you're actually including or
        excluding an infinite number of numbers. &gt; As each additional prime
        occurs you take the measure of it and &gt; compare it to the previous
        measurements, and make projections. Compare &gt; the projections to the
        actual values (the next primes) and rank &gt; projection schemes
        according to their success rates. &gt; &gt; I relise that this is a lot
        of work, but that's what computers were &gt; invented for, wasn't it?

        &gt; Jasmine. Here it is - I already got a response! This is from Uwe
        Meffert himself: &gt; ... the problem lays not with us but the new Visa
        Secure Gateway &gt; which to Asia has serious problems. We can see that
        up to 80% of &gt; order payments are being declined but unfortunately it
        does not &gt; give details as to from whom or for what so we can not
        even contact &gt; them to suggesting to order by email with payment via
        PayPal to &gt; Jing Meffert e-mail mpg@... or Faxing me the details to
        &gt; (852) 2580-5525 or in two e-mails so that I can arranged to have
        &gt; the payment processed by Jetco in Hong Kong. So, if you haven't
        ordered yet, and want to, I'd suggest going to their store, figuring out
        what you want, and then paying for it via paypal, being sure to indicate
        your order either in a comment with the payment, or in an additional
        e-mail to them. If you already tried ordering, and aren't sure if it
        worked completely, I'd recommend contacting them via e-mail... He
        replied to me from mefferts@..., so if you don't get a response at the
        mpg@... address, try contacting him directly there, instead. Good luck

        do want it to give you something useful at particular points, but you
        have to go to the next step an define those points. &gt; I haven't
        really given it any thought as to whether it &gt; can or not - clearly
        it isn't absolutely convergent but you are &gt; saying that it can't
        converge. If that's true then it's not really a &gt; good definition of
        density (which should be a value in [0,1]). Overall it can't be because
        of the open ended nature of it (the infinit aspect) but in individual
        cases it can give a density for that region of whole numbers. &gt; &gt;
        There's lots of information embedded there and multiple ways to &gt;
        &gt; project where the slope is going, for example, take a running &gt;
        average &gt; &gt; of the difference over two or more points, or three or
        more &gt; points, or &gt; &gt; more, and graphing them, etc. Several
        such averages just might &gt; &gt; converge. :) Do you see what I mean?
        &gt; &gt; Surely if it couldn't converge the slope couldn't be going
        anywhere! If overall the limit is zero, this line can head for the limit
        infinitely and it will never arrive. &gt; I assume you want to look at
        something like a Cesaro sum. I still &gt; can't see why you can add all
        of your 1/2 and 1/3 before subtracting &gt; your 1/6. Because the sieve
        will be the wrong size for a region of whole numbers if you don't state
        it correctly. There is no one density - you need a means for plugging in
        specific primes to have a go at the next prime. The region of the next
        prime will have a different density of non-primes than any other prime.

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From one post 4007 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Right, the order is important. I though that it could be &gt;
        &gt; graphed &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the different projections could be
        tested. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean by
        "projections could be tested"? What are the &gt; &gt; &gt; projections
        and what would the test be? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from the
        next post 4008 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why not add and
        subtract them in numerical order? That's how &gt; &gt; &gt; they fall
        naturally. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's not actually true
        because for each fraction you're &gt; &gt; actually &gt; &gt; &gt;
        including or excluding an infinite number of numbers. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; So you make "one" the unit of infinity; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; You can't really do that. &gt; &gt; Of course you can. &gt; No, you
        can't. &gt; &gt; There are strange properties of infinite &gt; &gt; sets
        - e.g. there are as many even numbers as whole numbers or as &gt; &gt;
        fractions. &gt; &gt; I know this is a common misunderstanding. All
        infinities are not &gt; the same size. Those who claim they are have not
        thought it through. &gt; Whilst not all infinities are the same size,
        all infinite subsets of the natural numbers are and they all have the
        same order type too (in the usual well-ordering). I have thought about
        infinities quite a lot actually. I did a Ph.D. in set theory. &gt; &gt;
        Thus you need to be able to define a particular notion of &gt; &gt;
        density (generally something like the limit of pi(x)/x as &gt; &gt;
        x-&gt;infinity is the sort of thing). &gt; &gt; Yes, the density changes
        as the occurances of primes progresses. No, the density is defined to be
        the limit, not a succession of values. &gt; &gt; &gt; For the primes
        this density &gt; &gt; becomes 0 in the limit (as it is approximately
        asymptotic to things &gt; &gt; like 1/(ln x)). &gt; &gt; No, the density
        *never* reaches zero. The density is defined to be the limit and this is
        0. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you graph 1/2 &gt; &gt; &gt; (you add 1/3 and you
        subtract 1/6) &gt; &gt; &gt; graph that as a point above 1/2 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; (you add 1/5 - you subtract 1/10 and 1/15) &gt; &gt; &gt; graph
        that etc. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The graphed points end up
        defining a slope. &gt; &gt; &gt; Each addition is a prime, the
        subtractions are a correction for &gt; &gt; &gt; doubling, so the point
        on the slope is marked after the &gt; &gt; corrections. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; This won't converge because it can't. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Why can't it? &gt; &gt; Nothing to converge with,
        overall. You do want it to give you &gt; something useful at particular
        points, but you have to go to the next &gt; step an define those points.
        Converge "with" rather than to? Am I to assume you are talking about
        converging with respect to some non-standard topology. &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        haven't really given it any thought as to whether it &gt; &gt; can or
        not - clearly it isn't absolutely convergent but you are &gt; &gt;
        saying that it can't converge. If that's true then it's not really a
        &gt; &gt; good definition of density (which should be a value in [0,1]).
        &gt; &gt; Overall it can't be because of the open ended nature of it
        (the &gt; infinit aspect) but in individual cases it can give a density
        for that &gt; region of whole numbers. &gt; The infinity aspect is not a
        difficulty though, unless of course you are denying the possibility of
        inductive sets or some other axiom for infinite sets, in which case you
        can't even have a set of primes anyway. &gt; &gt; &gt; There's lots of
        information embedded there and multiple ways to &gt; &gt; &gt; project
        where the slope is going, for example, take a running &gt; &gt; average
        &gt; &gt; &gt; of the difference over two or more points, or three or
        more &gt; &gt; points, or &gt; &gt; &gt; more, and graphing them, etc.
        Several such averages just might &gt; &gt; &gt; converge. :) Do you see
        what I mean? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surely if it couldn't converge the
        slope couldn't be going anywhere! &gt; &gt; If overall the limit is
        zero, this line can head for the limit &gt; infinitely and it will never
        arrive. &gt; There are formal definitions of limit though. &gt; &gt; I
        assume you want to look at something like a Cesaro sum. I still &gt;
        &gt; can't see why you can add all of your 1/2 and 1/3 before
        subtracting &gt; &gt; your 1/6. &gt; &gt; Because the sieve will be the
        wrong size for a region of whole &gt; numbers if you don't state it
        correctly. There is no one density - you &gt; need a means for plugging
        in specific primes to have a go at the next &gt; prime. The region of
        the next prime will have a different density of &gt; non-primes than any
        other prime. &gt; I'd have to disagree in general. Certainly different
        (contiguous or otherwise) subsets will have different densities of
        primes, but that's not really what the question at the heart of it is,
        which is to get approximations for pi(x) (or pi(x)/x) for large x. For
        instance, since you seem to be going for a density at every step - what
        about {1,2,3,4,5}. You'd have 1/2+1/3-1/6+1/5 (and possibly
        -1/10-1/15+1/30) for the density of composites if I follow you because
        you have subtracted 1/6 before you added 1/5. If you still disagree with
        me in terms of the infinite stuff, can you at least tell me from what
        level you are coming to it so that I know what level of formality you
        are using. &gt; Regards, &gt; &gt; David J

        If only one string is broke, it still should be ok. The magics are all
        double stringed, so it should still be fine. But to be on the safe side,
        you may want to get a DIY kit from rubiks.com, or get a new magic. I
        have a used a single strung magic and it is way to loose, but it still
        hung together if you are gentle. Yours should be fine though. jake

        change some of the middle stuff without the outer stuff (by which I mean
        for the mouse to go over a square say two rows and columns in you have
        to pass your mouse over an outer row or column first)? b) change the
        same row/column twice in a row (as indicated) because it would seem that
        you need to be able to move out and in again to achieve this (and so get
        something else done in between). One thing about puzzles like this is
        that the order in which you apply the moves doesn't matter (so I assume
        you can get around a) and b) by doing the inner stuff and then
        cancelling out, if necessary, the outer stuff later on).

        DIY kit from rubiks.com, or get a new magic. I have a used a single &gt;
        strung magic and it is way to loose, but it still hung together if you
        are gentle. &gt; Yours should be fine though. &gt; jake

        Did the string snap or did it just slide off of the tile? If it snapped
        it shouldnt be to hard to remove. But if a loop fell off it may be a bit
        tricky to remove, BUT you may be able to repair it then. If the string
        is still good and not snapped go to www.twistymegasite.com in their
        articles section is a page that shows how to repair it. If the string
        snapped, you just have to fiddle with it untill it comes out. Don's

        I suppose they would depending on the type of puzzles they have. I think
        that even with out Rubik to invent it, it would have been invented
        becuase puzzles of this sort all work up to the 3x3 cube (basically). If
        ETs were to have a sliding type puzzle, that was a sqaure, then they'd
        prabably move up to a more difficult 3-D version of the same puzzle.
        Then eventually evolving towards the cube. Of course, extraterrestrial
        intelligent beings may not even be composed of cells, or have a brain
        capable of seeing in 3-D. They could be part of the 7th demension, and
        not even bother with 3-D puzzles. Although, I have no knowledge to back
        up my useless prognostications about how aliens are. On a side note, I
        hope that Aliens invent a 12 color megaminx in which they can sell to
        me, because it seems no one has one here on earth anymore...

        Hi all, not only for Sunday contest enthusiasts, Let me introduce
        Japanese Sunday Contest. When Jess started 1st Sunday contest ever, we,
        Japanese cubists, started the similar contest organized by Mr. Suehiro
        Kondo who is the pioneer of Japanese speedcubists community. Since Nov
        2001, we have had 99 times of contests. Here you can see the history of
        the contests. (Sorry Japanese only, but you may see the times and
        numebers at least.) http://ksuehiro.hp.infoseek.co.jp/ranking0.htm Next
        week, we will have the 100th contest. The first contest we had 6
        contestants and I won with 24.5 sec in average. Everybody has practiced
        a lot and got faster. Recent competions of Macky and Katsu look like
        world championship (you may already know at Frank's contest) but the
        level of contestants vary from sub18 to 1 min. We normally have one
        regular contest a week but this time we are going to have several
        categories like big cubes, average of 100?, blidfold, etc. To celebrate
        the 100th, we wish we could have more than 100 contestants to join Feel
        free to join the contest. We are very happy if you could join. Please
        help us and have fun for winter holidays! I will post the details of the
        contest in the next week again. Thanks. Masayuki Akimoto P.S. Hi Chris
        and David, Congratulations on your new records on big cubes. I will try
        to catch up with you guys in this winter holidays again!

        You do *not* have to think recursively and you do *not* need to keep
        track of 7 things. Just look at how the smallest disk moves in an
        optimal solution. You can make it a pure reaction game, no thinking
        required. I don't have one myself, so I just cut disks out of cardboard
        and did seven disks in about 90 seconds. I assume with a good real
        version I could do it in about the same time, with a very bad one I
        tried at a shop I needed twice the time. Cheers! Stefan &gt; //Now that
        I'm past all of the thankings and the sentimentality, back &gt; to Tower
        of Hanoi &gt; &gt; I know that's a really slow time, I need to work on
        the algorith &gt; though...I would keep getting lost in the middle of
        the big stacks, &gt; and undo what i was moving...it's a little
        confusing, because &gt; basically you're just trying to think
        recursively. I'm sure I can &gt; beat that...maybe I"ll post it on
        speedcubing.com....if they let &gt; me...I mean it's not quite cubing,
        and easily beatable...but then I &gt; could be first at something. I'm
        sure that 7 minutes will be easily &gt; beaten though...It's just
        getting the pattern down, cuz it's very &gt; intuitive for the first 3,
        or 4, maybe 5...but after that, it gets &gt; kind of confusing, because
        you're keeping track of 7 things. Someone &gt; said something about
        getting the 7 move optimal solution for &gt; 3....that's pretty
        easy...but the optimal solution will always be &gt; solution=2^(number
        of discs) - 1

        Maybe they have a tesseract (4D cube) or something else. Do you recall
        showing me the bottle puzzle in April? Perhaps they have something
        similar but with a Klein bottle. That would be more of a hoax puzzle
        though since you can't put things inside of or take things out of such a
        bottle (with it not having an inside or out). Also, if they are in 4D
        (and I'm not talking about time as a "fourth dimension" but a fourth
        spatial dimension - from the vector space point of view, time can't be a
        dimension anyway, unless there is negative time) certain puzzles would
        be perhaps easier. All knots are equivalent to the unknot in 4D so
        puzzles like the Tangle might be trivial. (I'm making a very uninformed
        statement here as I don't really know anything about this puzzle and am
        just inferring from it's name.) On a sort of related note: Did you know
        (as I found out from a friend who has studied such matters) that the
        shape of the universe can affect the limits of our computational
        ability? Actually, if you saw Horizon last night there was something
        similar to this. As I recall if the universe had some shape like a torus
        or maybe a 2-torus (maybe more generally anything with negative genus,
        but that's more of a wild conjecture) then it would be possible to do
        supertasks and do an infinite amount of calculation in a finite time
        (because of differences in time at different places). The unfortunate
        thing is that getting the information back from the experiment (e.g. a
        verification that Goldbach's conjecture (every even number greater than
        2 is a sum of two primes) was true (if it is) by testing all the
        possible sums of 2 primes) would impart sufficient energy to kill the
        recipient. As I recall, the master would send out the slave who would be
        able to perform all these calculations in a finite amount of time and
        then send the information back. Then the master would die instantly, but
        he'd know (whether GC is true). In particular, a similar experiment
        could obtain the diameters of all the various cube puzzles.

        and 28min55 long) Player control accuracy is unbelievable, especially on
        Airman level (maybe he use the emulator to slow-down the game ?). He
        nearly doesn't get hit, only destroy few ennemy robots and destroy boss

        I think the odds that they invented something identical to a Rubiks Cube
        are pretty small. We don't know anything about extraterrestrial beings.
        If they don't have fingers, for example, a Rubiks Cube won't do them
        much good. It's always possible, though. --- In

        There are no real 2D knots, &gt; right? (at least I can't think of any)
        (Disclaimer: I've never done a course in knot theory, although I had to
        TA for one as a graduate student.) A knot is just a continuous function
        f:[0,1]-&gt;R^n for some n (usually n=3), such that f[0]=f[1] and the
        restriction of f to [0,1) is injective. (i.e. the image of f is a simple
        closed curve in R^n. I suppose then that if one were to look at knots in
        2D then because of the Jordan curve theorem every knot would be
        homotopic to a circle, i.e. to the unknot. So the only real knot theory
        in 2D would be the Jordan curve theorem (if that even would fall under
        the heading of knot theory). To answer the first question, I'm fairly
        sure that knot theory is only non-trivial if n=3. (i.e. every knot is
        equivalent in R^n if n&gt;3.) Therefore, you could just insist on n=3 in
        the definition, because outside of this the theory is uninteresting
        (modulo the result that it is uninteresting!). &gt; &gt; &gt; In
        particular, a similar experiment could obtain the diameters of &gt; &gt;
        all the various cube puzzles. &gt; &gt; But their problem spaces are
        finite, just huge. Maybe the master &gt; wouldn't have to die but just
        get hurt... lose a leg or so? ;-) &gt; Individually, but I was meaning
        nxnxn for each n, which is infinite. &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan

        I'd would say that it is possible that the cube would be invented again,
        considering that both Erno Rubik and Terutoshi Ishige both invented the
        cube at about the same time. Like the man who showed up in the patent
        office with a working telephone 4 hours after Alexander Graham Bell, at
        certain points in history there occurs "an idea whose time has come."

        Thank you, Jess, actually, I gave others pretty good chance to win 2
        weeks ago scoring 29 moves only (pretty bad for me). Nobody took the

        I am going to answer your tough question. Once we suppose they are that
        intelligent they have to be able to manipulate objects (otherwise they
        would not have a reason to be so intelligent). If they can manipulate
        objects they find a way to manipulate things like Rubik's cube. Though
        the cube may differ a lot in size from our, it may have its surface or
        shape adjusted for their better grip and most importantly the stickers
        would not peel off (!) like of the cubes we are used to. Thus, it
        doesn't matter if they are jelly fish looking or a highly organized
        plasma made of. Mirek --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        unlikey that they have a working prototype else I would expect to see

        to make big "cubes", but cubes bigger as 6x6x6 are very hard to make
        because there are so many pieces. Production cost will be very high. So

        &gt; As far as I am aware there is no result on the diameter in QTM &gt;
        &gt; except that it is less than 42 and at least (either) 24 or 26. &gt;
        &gt; Diameter in QTM is &gt;= 26; the position &gt; &gt;
        U+U+F+U+U+R-L+F+F+U+F-B-R+L+U+U+R+U+D-R+L-D+R-L-D+D+ &gt; &gt; requires
        26 moves. This is the only such example position I &gt; am aware of.
        &gt; &gt; Diameter in HTM is &gt;= 20; many example positions exist,
        &gt; including the one above which can be solved in HTM 20 as &gt; &gt;
        U+F+D2R+L+U+F2D+L2U+F2U+F-B-D2R+F2L2B2D- &gt; &gt; I do not know what
        the current upper bounds are. I don't even &gt; know if there is a move
        sequence that is 26QTM and 20HTM at the &gt; same time, that solves the
        above position. &gt; I have always thought that the diametrical point
        must be symmetric in relation to the opposite point. It seems (to me)
        very hard to believe that you from a non-symmetric point can do any
        quarter turn (of twelve), and in all cases come a step closer to the
        opposite point. R &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an

        it be? The position above (requiring 26 moves) is highly symmetric---I
        believe out of the 48 standard symmetries it is 16-way symmetric, and it
        is its own inverse. Of course you say "the diametrical point"; why must
        there be only one? In any case, since the number of "highly symmetric"
        positions is much much less than the number of positions, it would be
        interesting to "solve" all of the positions of highest symmetry just to
        see what they give. If I recall, doesn't jaap have a page on this? The
        Walter Randelshofer pretty pattern collection includes probably most
        highly symmetric positions (but not the one mentioned above,
        interestingly). On the other hand, I believe there are a large number of
        non-symmetric positions at distance 24 (qtm) for which every spin brings
        it to 23. Or perhaps 22 and 21, respectively.

        &gt; &gt; I have always thought that the diametrical point must be
        symmetric &gt; &gt; in relation to the opposite point. It seems (to me)
        very hard to &gt; &gt; believe that you from a non-symmetric point can
        do any quarter &gt; &gt; turn (of twelve), and in all cases come a step
        closer to the &gt; &gt; opposite point. An antipode need not be
        symmetric, though as you point out, in a way symmetric positions are
        more likely to be antipodes than non- symmetric ones. &gt; Of course you
        say "the diametrical point"; why must there be only &gt; one? Indeed.
        Most puzzles have several antipodes. Many of the pages on my site list
        the number of positions at each distance, and only very rarely is there
        a single position at the furtherst distance from start. However, if
        there is only one, then it must be symmetric: Any reflection/rotation of
        an antipode is also an antipode, so if there is only one antipode then
        its reflections/rotations are the same. &gt; In any case, since the
        number of "highly symmetric" positions is &gt; much much less than the
        number of positions, it would be &gt; interesting to "solve" all of the
        positions of highest symmetry &gt; just to see what they give. If I
        recall, doesn't jaap have a page &gt; on this? I still haven't put in
        the time to finish those pages properly, so they are not officially part
        of my site. You can preview them here:

        &gt; I have always thought that the diametrical point must be symmetric
        &gt; &gt; in relation to the opposite point. It seems (to me) very hard
        to &gt; &gt; believe that you from a non-symmetric point can do any
        quarter &gt; &gt; turn (of twelve), and in all cases come a step closer
        to the &gt; &gt; opposite point. &gt; &gt; This is an interesting
        comment---but how symmetric must it be? The &gt; position above
        (requiring 26 moves) is highly symmetric---I believe &gt; out of the 48
        standard symmetries it is 16-way symmetric, and it is &gt; its own
        inverse. &gt; &gt; Of course you say "the diametrical point"; why must
        there be only one? &gt; For me - and quite intutively - the superflip
        represents the highest symmetri in relation to the null point. If that
        is true (that it does have the highest symmetri), a bold hypothesis
        would be that this flip represents the (only) diameter of the cube.
        Other points of "less symmetri" may very well be local maxima in the
        system. (I know, it¬¥s not quite sympathetic to - like Goldbach - make
        more or less vague conjectures, but after all, they are there for being
        proved (or refuted)). R &gt; In any case, since the number of "highly
        symmetric" positions is much &gt; much less than the number of
        positions, it would be interesting to &gt; "solve" all of the positions
        of highest symmetry just to see what they &gt; give. If I recall,
        doesn't jaap have a page on this? The Walter &gt; Randelshofer pretty
        pattern collection includes probably most highly &gt; symmetric
        positions (but not the one mentioned above, interestingly). &gt; &gt; On
        the other hand, I believe there are a large number of non-symmetric &gt;
        positions at distance 24 (qtm) for which every spin brings it to 23.
        &gt; Or perhaps 22 and 21, respectively. &gt; &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe

        is less than the move that needed 26 mentioned earlier in the thread and
        that position is clearly less symmetric than the superflip. (In terms of
        the half-turn metric, of course it is conceivable that there may be 2
        positions A, B that are 1 move away from each other and are also both
        the maximum distance from the solved position. Whilst this is not true
        in the case of quarter turns, the most symmetric position isn't the most

        Some of the smaller subgroups have a single antipode: &lt;T2, D2, F2&gt;
        &lt;T2, D2, F2, B2&gt; Slice group has 69 antipodes with "q slice turns"
        so it might have something in the way of unsymmetric antipodes. But then
        I'm not sure how unsymmetric a slice position can be. It shouldn't be
        too hard to hack something up to list the number of positions by
        symmetry level. My guess is that it's M-level 12 at most (in the slice
        group). Might be an idea to define "unsymmetric" as the most unsymmetric
        pattern in a given group. I'd like to see an example of a local maxima
        in the full cube group of M-level 48. To the best of my knowledge there

        Sorry, that's just my notation...a position M-level 48 just means that

        Indeed, and a quick review of some God's Algorithm notes for 3x3x3
        corners only shows that at one q turn closer to start almost all
        positions are local maxima: 2,127,264 positions at 13 q turns. Distance
        23 seems a bountiful place to start. _If_ distance 26 is the farthest
        away then it seems reasonable that there's a ton of local maxima at 23,
        most of that is going to be very unsymmetric. Cube-lovers might even
        have an earlier reference, but I didn't recall any discussions about it.
        The various God's Algorithm calculations didn't include a list of
        M-symmetry levels but maybe Jaap or Claude Crepeau knows? No reason why
        we can't do that for some subgroups. Your position doesn't look very

        I know quite a few people around here have had problems with space for
        their cube pages (either bandwidth, size or ads)... I've recently been
        told about a deal that many of you may want to take advantage of. Before
        I go further, I must appologize - based on the order form it looks like
        this is only available to those in the US and Canada.... A company
        called 1&amp;1 Internet Inc. is giving away 3 years of free
        webhosting... It's linux hosting (which typically means reliable) that
        comes with 500MB of space, 6GB/mo. of data transfer (which stands for
        lots of viewing of your cube videos :-), and there's no banners or ads
        or anything. After the first 3 years for free, it's kinda expensive
        ($29/mo.), but who cares for the next three years, right? You don't have
        to register a domain (you'll get something like mine for free -
        http://s92306692.onlinehome.us which is currently not updated at all),
        but if you want to, that's just $6/yr with them. &gt;From what I've seen
        so far, it looks like an excellent deal, and it's just their way of
        bringing in new business... If you're under 18, you will need parental
        permission (see their terms &amp; conditions), but aside from that you
        just need a valid e-mail address, phone number, and address (the e-mail
        address and phone number are used during the automated setup process).
        Check it out if you're interested: http://www.1and1.com But act quickly,
        as this deal is only good through January 14, 2004! - Grant

        Hi all, As I mentioned previously, I just uploaded algorithms for the
        100th Japanese Speedcubing Sundy Contest. You can find excel file at
        file section of this group. I also created tables at database section.
        You can submit your times there. That means immediately after you
        submitted your time, everyone can see your results. For the organizer's
        convenience, we use this database. Please feel free to join the
        contests. There are many categories but may not sufficient for
        everybody. Sorry for those who can't find the interesting categories.
        Categories: 2x2, 3x3 average of 10 out of 12 4x4 average of 3 out of 5
        5x5 middle of 3 3x3 fastest with practices pyraminx blind fold for 2x2
        and 3x3 Forced cross color average of 5 out of 7 Deadline is around
        January 7th, 2004. We wish we could see 100s of participants to join.

        thanks guys! I put two "stickers" in the back windshield so people who
        aren't wise to our lifestyle will have a chance of getting. My father
        was making fun of me yesterday, "What's a spud quiber?" I'll post a pic
        of the stickers too (printed out graphics box-taped to the inside of the
        back windshield) as soon as I can. Merry Christmas! Daniel Hayes

        November) I visited the international Sun's &gt; conference "SunTechDay"
        in Prague, Czech Republic. There was so &gt; called "unusual talent"
        competition. 6 people (from about 1500) were &gt; allowed to show some
        unusual skill (juggling, dancing, singing etc.). &gt; Accidentally, I
        had a Rubik's cube and was allowed to participate &gt; (to be honest - I
        have one cube with me most of the time). &gt; I must say, that I am not
        a speedcubist yet, this was my first public &gt; attempt. I showed
        solving the cube in 51s (I use Waterman's method). &gt; It was really
        bad for me: the stress was too big and I had to solve &gt; the first
        layer twice. I think I forgot half of algorithms (I was not &gt; able to
        do corner permutation and orientation in one step - normally &gt; I do).
        &gt; However the audience was really amazed (especially by some &gt;
        fingertricks - I think - I had no time to watch the people and lots &gt;
        of spotlights blocked my eyes) and chose me as a winner. &gt; &gt; I
        hope I helped in popularizing the cube even though I am not the &gt;
        right person to do that at the moment :). &gt; &gt; BTW. the first price
        was Java leather jacket :). &gt; &gt; JJ.

        Is there anyone who learned to solve the 4x4x4 using Chris Hardwick's
        method, and then learned to solve the 5x5x5 in a very similar way? I use
        the same method and I get the "edge pieces" (like in the 3x3x3), 4 on
        top, 4 on bottom. Then those last 4 edge pieces are so hard to get! That
        is all I need to know how to do. Thanks in advance, maybe Chris H
        himself will read this!

        Since those four "edges" were still messed up, I just left them and

        since I am a collector I have many sources for collectibles that I do
        not share. I do share sources for new puzzle, like Cube21 or any puzzle
        that can you can buy online. It takes a while to get some sources for
        collectibles, but the Arxon cubes did came from 3 sources all from
        Germany. As for any collectible you can get them for a good price if you
        can wait long enough! Hopes this helps a bit Ton

        Hello, Let me present you something that you don√Ø¬ø¬Ωt use to talk about.
        But it is so important for yourselves and the people around you that I
        dare today to introduce a worldwide referendum. I am sorry because it is
        not my nature to ennoy someone else, and I hope I don√Ø¬ø¬Ωt, but after the

        can occur in our near future. Please, don√Ø¬ø¬Ωt underestimate the
        consequences of your own choice. Everyone is directly concerned. It is
        not a simple message, not only an other one among thousands you have
        already received. This is a worldwide phenomenon ! Hundreds of thousands
        people have reacted. Just see all the available translations (original

        message (short version = selection of sentences from the original
        version) : √Ø¬ø¬Ω √Ø¬ø¬ΩDO YOU WISH THAT WE SHOW UP ?√Ø¬ø¬Ω (short version)
        Consider this message as a worldwide referendum! And your answer as a
        ballot! Who are we ? What in your history seemed ridiculous or
        improbable has often become possible, then realised, in particular in
        the last fifty years. We are conscious creatures that some name
        √Ø¬ø¬Ωextra-terrestrials√Ø¬ø¬Ω, even though reality is subtler. There is no
        fundamental difference between you and us, save for the experience of
        certain stages of evolution. Like most of you, we are in the quest of
        the Supreme Being. We have no human representative on Earth who could
        guide your decision. Why aren√Ø¬ø¬Ωt we visible ? Structured
        DEMATERIALISATION and materialisation are part of new forms of science
        beyond the apparent control of matter. That you call √Ø¬ø¬ΩUFOs, there are
        essentially multidimensional manufactured spaceships that apply these
        capacities. √Ø¬ø¬Ω For negative multidimensional beings that play a part in
        the exercise of power in the shadow of human oligarchy, discretion is
        motivated by their will to keep their existence and seizure unknown. For
        us, discretion is motivated by the respect of the human free will that
        people can exercise to manage their own affairs so that they can reach
        technical and spiritual maturity on their own. Humankind√Ø¬ø¬Ωs entrance
        into the family of galactic civilisations is greatly expected. We can
        appear in broad daylight and help you attain this union. We haven√Ø¬ø¬Ωt
        done it so far, as too few of you have genuinely desired it, because of
        ignorance, indifference or fear, and because the emergency of the
        situation did not justify it. Who are you ? You are the offspring of
        many traditions that throughout time have been mutually enriched by each
        others√Ø¬ø¬Ω contributions. The appearance of your cultures seems to keep
        you separated because you substitute it to your deeper being. Shape is
        now more important than the essence of your subtle nature. For the
        powers in place, this prevalence of the shape constitutes the ramparts
        against any form of jeopardy. You are being called on to overcome shape
        while still respecting it for its richness and beauty. Peace does not
        mean not making war, it consists in becoming what you are in reality: a
        same Fraternity. What is your situation ? Your history has never ceased
        to be marked by encounters between peoples who had to discover one
        another in conditions that were often conflictual. Earth has now become
        a village where everyone knows everyone else but still conflicts persist
        and threats of all kinds get worse in duration and intensity. Your
        thoughts and beliefs are modelled after partisan interests to turn you
        into slaves while at the same time giving you the feeling that you are
        in total control of your destiny, which in essence is the reality.
        Ecosystem exhaustion mechanisms have exceeded irreversible limits. The
        scarcity of resources and their unfair distribution - resources which
        entry price will rise day after day - will bring about fratricide fights
        at a large scale, but also at the very heart of your cities and
        countrysides. Hatred grows bigger but so does love. That is what keeps
        you confident in your ability to find solutions. But the critical mass
        is insufficient and a sabotage work is cleverly being carried out.
        √Ø¬ø¬ΩTribes, populations and human nations have always encountered and
        interacted with one another. Faced with the threats weighing upon the
        human family, it is perhaps time that a greater interaction occurred.
        √Ø¬ø¬Ω Who are the √Ø¬ø¬Ωthird party√Ø¬ø¬Ω ? There are two ways to establish a
        cosmic contact with another civilisation: via its standing
        representatives or directly with individuals without distinction. The
        first way entails fights of interests, the second way brings awareness.
        The first way was chosen by a group of races motivated by keeping
        mankind in slavery, thereby controlling Earth resources, the gene pool
        and human emotional energy. The second way was chosen by a group of
        races allied with the cause of the Spirit of service. That is why today
        individuals are to make this choice by themselves without any
        representative interfering. Peace and reunification of your peoples
        would be a first step toward the harmony with civilisations other than
        yours. That is precisely what those who manipulate you behind the scenes
        want to avoid at all cost because, by dividing, they reign! They also
        reign over those who govern you. Their strength comes from their
        capacity to distillate mistrust and fear into you. This considerably
        harms your very cosmic nature. Being aware of the priceless value of
        free will, we are inviting you to an alternative. What can we offer ? WE
        CAN offer you a more holistic vision of the universe and of life,
        constructive interactions, the experience of fair and fraternal
        relationships, liberating technical knowledge, eradiction of suffering,
        controlled exercise of individual powers, the access to new forms of
        energy and, finally, a better comprehension of CONSCIOUSNESS. WE CANNOT
        help you overcome your individual and collective fears, or bring you
        laws that you would not have chosen, work on your own selves, individual
        and collective effort to build the world you desire, the spirit of quest
        to new skies. What would we receive ? Should you decide that such a
        contact takes place, we would rejoice over the safeguarding of fraternal
        equilibrium in this region of the universe, fruitful diplomatic
        exchanges, and the intense Joy of knowing that you are united to
        accomplish what you are capable of. The feeling of JOY is strongly
        sought in the universe for its energy is divine. What is the question we
        ask you ? √Ø¬ø¬ΩDO YOU WISH THAT WE SHOW UP ?√Ø¬ø¬Ω How to can you answer this
        question ? The truth of soul can be read by telepathy. This is why you
        should calmly think about it, in all conscience. Do not rush to answer.
        Breathe and let all the power of your own free will penetrate you. You
        only need to give your answer, YES or NO, IMMEDIATELY AFTER ASKING THE
        QUESTION ! In your own private polling booth of your secret will, you
        will determine the future. What is the lever effect ? This decision
        should be made by the greatest number among you, even though it might
        seem like a minority. This request is one of the most intimate that can
        be asked to you. If you really want to cling to your beliefs, which is
        something that we understand, then say NO. If you do not know what to
        choose, do not say YES because of mere curiosity. Your history has
        plenty of episodes when determined men and women were able to influence
        the thread of events in spite of their small number. Just like a small
        number is enough to take temporal power on Earth and influence the
        future of the majority, a small number of you can radically change your
        fate as an answer to the impotence in face of so much inertia and
        hurdles ! You can ease the mankind√Ø¬ø¬Ωs birth to Brotherhood. What would
        be the consequences of a positive decision ? For us, the immediate
        consequence of a collective favourable decision would be the
        materialisation of many ships, in your sky and on Earth. For you, the
        direct effect would be the rapid abandoning of many certitudes and
        beliefs. Concretely, you would change the scale of your values ! Later
        on, peaceful and respectful exchanges would be thus possible if such is
        your wish. For now, he who is hungry cannot smile, he who is fearful
        cannot welcome us. We are sad to see men, women and children suffering
        to such a degree in their flesh and in their hearts when they bear such
        an inner light. The main difference between your daily prayers to
        entities of a strictly spiritual nature and your current decision is
        extremely simple : we are technically equipped to materialise! Why such
        a historical dilemma ? We know that √Ø¬ø¬Ωforeigners√Ø¬ø¬Ω are considered as
        enemies as long as they embody the √Ø¬ø¬Ωunknown√Ø¬ø¬Ω. In a first stage, the
        emotion that our appearance will generate will strengthen your
        relationships on a worldwide scale. How could you know whether our
        arrival is the consequence of your collective choice ? For the simple
        reason that we would have otherwise been already there for a long time
        at your level of existence ! If we are not there yet, it is because you
        have not made such a decision explicitely. How could you be certain that
        this is not yet another subtle manoeuvre of the √Ø¬ø¬Ωthird party√Ø¬ø¬Ω to
        better enslave you ? Because one always more efficiently fights
        something that is identified than the contrary. Whatever, you are the
        sole judge in your own heart and soul ! Do you want to see us with your
        own eyes, or simply believe what your thinkers say ? That is the real
        question! √Ø¬ø¬ΩYou are still the architects of your own fate... √Ø¬ø¬ΩDO YOU
        WISH THAT WE SHOW UP ?√Ø¬ø¬Ω Complete original message on
        www.geocities.com/meetetnow/ √Ø¬ø¬Ω IF YOU WISH THEM TO SHOW UP : √Ø¬ø¬Ω You
        have to know that an increasing number of persons from everywhere, from
        all religions, workers and doctors, poors and richs, every one agreeing
        the ET proposal, participate at a worldwide Global First Contact
        Experiment which will involve a series of weekly visualizations details
        of the first of which are as follows: √Ø¬ø¬Ω (Go to√Ø¬ø¬Ω:

        a period lasting seven days and nights. The ships perform light displays
        that indicate universal greetings of peace, joy and fraternity√Ø¬ø¬Ω

        alongside cristmas I didnt got any cubes. Maybe because It's hard to
        find a good cube in Israel. It's not so bad, I have a few myself :) Dror

        am down to just 2 sets! - Line up the edges in FL and FR (instead of

        has to do with rotating the cube. I believe x is rotation with respect

        rotation with respect to the F face. For y' you would look at the top
        face and rotate the entire cube counter-clockwise. Doug &gt; &gt; Tell

        -Tyson\ This depends what type of 2x2x2 you have, but for lubrication
        you can just spray in the center. But the best result you will get to
        spray every piece To disassemble a Rubik's 2x2x2 Oddzon type see
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/2x2x2_dis.JPG To disassemble a Rubik's
        2x2x2 Ideal 1980 big pocket version Unscrew three screws in the center
        and you can remove one corner see
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/images/Rubik's%202x2x2%20balltype% 20.JPG
        The Eastheen is a bit tricky but you must push to teh outside with a
        screw driver a little platic clip inside the corne and the corner can
        slide of http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/images/Eastheen%202x2x2.JPG If
        you have an other type just mail me, and I will figure it out. Ton

        I managed to solve those last 2 triplets once, and I think it was just
        luck that all 3 ended up in the same triplet then I just flipped the
        middle pieces in the triplets. Can someone just give me some algorithms
        that work for the last two? If you can solve it using the 3x3x3 method
        you should just know them off of the top of your head. Thanks, Louie

        Hello, i'm new to this group but i have been cubing (not speedcubing =))
        for a while. Is there anyone that is familiar with this method and that

        as they don't charge for shipping (last I knew), it's not surprising

        something quickly before the WC in August, so I payed for the expensive
        shipping, and got it in just a couple of days. If you go with the free
        shipping option, I would expect it to take at least 2-4 weeks, if not as
        much as 6.. unfortunately :-( - Grant

        Hello. I'm a newbie. I just got my first Ribik's Cube on Christmas. I've
        gotten to the point of ALMOST being able to solve it every time. I've
        slved it about five or six times on my own. I've mostly been using the
        technique available at http://lar5.com/cube/index.html It has worked for
        me. I thought it would be a good idea to compile a list of cubing
        techniques (mostly speed cubing, because of the nature of the group).
        This would not only be usful to newies in finding (a) techniqure(s) that
        they are comfortable with, but it would be usful to more advanced users
        becuase they could find more techniques, tips, and other people that
        might be able to help them. If you just post the URLs, and maybe a short
        description, on this group, then I'll update a webpage to include them
        all. Chris

        Hello. It's me again. I just finished setting up the page. It's very
        basic for reasons explained on the page. Does anyone know of a place
        where I can get a cool Rubik's Cube counter set? Or do one you have one?
        Thanks. Chris BTW: The link is

        to have a lot of misc. files at

        I just got my first Ribik's Cube on Christmas. &gt; I've gotten to the
        point of ALMOST being able to solve it every time. &gt; I've slved it
        about five or six times on my own. I've mostly been &gt; using the
        technique available at http://lar5.com/cube/index.html It &gt; has
        worked for me. I thought it would be a good idea to compile a &gt; list
        of cubing techniques (mostly speed cubing, because of the nature &gt; of
        the group). This would not only be usful to newies in finding (a) &gt;
        techniqure(s) that they are comfortable with, but it would be usful &gt;
        to more advanced users becuase they could find more techniques, tips,
        &gt; and other people that might be able to help them. If you just post
        &gt; the URLs, and maybe a short description, on this group, then I'll
        &gt; update a webpage to include them all. &gt; Chris

        I suggest using this alg: LRU2L'R'-B'F'U2BF For the first part, keep the
        Left layer in the same place (so the U2 will actually be done in the
        back). You should be able to do all moves with your right hand.

        Basically. The technique gets me to the 2x2x3, and I can get everything
        but the edges how I want them when I want them. so to move the edges, I
        have to move a layer that is part of the 2x2x2 or the 2x2x3. i do what i
        think i have to do to put it back, but i get confused and ruin it, but
        don't realize it till after a couple moves, and I can't can't remember
        what i did, to work backwards to fix it. so i have to start over. Chris

        I just got a response to my email, everything looks good.. Hallo Mr.
        Reed, Thanks for your Email. I checked our posting record that we did
        send your puzzle order by air on 20th December, 2003 from our Hong kong
        office. Sorry for a few days delay due to the puzzle -Mini Professor
        cube was out of stock for a few days. Normally it needs to take approx.
        1-2 weeks from H.K. to U.S.A. It may a few days delay during the posting
        peak season (for Christmas and New Year holidays). Hopefully you are
        able to receive it shortly. Wish you have a wonderful, fruitful and joy
        New Year! Sincerely Jing Meffert I should be getting it any time now =)

        little: At the beginning of December I changed my ISP so I no longer
        recieved webspace from them, so I started trying different free web
        hosts. Seems like every time I got everything uploaded and good to go, a
        couple days later it would all be gone. So now I've put everything on a
        geocities site, which shouldn't be in too much danger of being deleted

        I guess that means layer by layer method. Well, if you want to get
        faster, you should probably switch methods. The layer by layer can get
        down under one minute, but not much faster than about 50 seconds. --- In

        There is no 'fastest method,' really. Though I personally think that you
        can get the fastest with the Corners First method. But I also think it
        takes a lot of work to get that fast. --- In

        Masayuki Akimoto Masayuki, Thanks for putting this together and
        including this group, though it looks like not very many people have
        participated yet (from this group). I did the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 averages,
        but I'm confused on the instructions for the 4x4x4 scramble... It says
        "Randomize 4x4 sigle slice movements (B) followed by double slice
        movements (C)" - does this mean that I apply the sequence in column B to
        just the faces, and then the sequence in column C to the face and the
        inner slice? Or, does it mean to apply the sequence in B to just the
        inner slice and then column C to the face and the inner slice? Or, does
        it mean something else? Thanks ahead of time for your clarification! -

        A popular method among many top speedcubers is the Fridrich method (or
        some variation of this). In a nutshell, this method consists of the
        following steps: cross + rest of the F2L + 2 look LL. I don't know if
        this method is *the* fastest, but it's certainly one of the fastest. The

        3x3x3 Rubik's cube is? Hi Lloyd, The method I use is my own. I don't
        know if it's the "fastest." First two levels: Choose what will be your
        first level, middle level and last level. Place two middle level edges
        on any one side. Place the 4 corners of the first level. Place the other
        two middle level edge pieces. Place the 4 first level edge pieces (most
        often on the bottom. There are many options for solving the Last level
        it shouldn't be too hard to find one of your choosing, or to make one up
        of your own. This takes between 36 and 54 moves on average. On occasion
        I do corners first and that's almost as fast time-wise, which recommends
        it because I really don't practice that method. The fastest would be
        doing all the corners and all the edges at the same time, but memorizing
        several quintillion algs is out of the question! :) Regards, David J

        sigle slice movements (B) followed by double &gt; slice movements (C)" -
        does this mean that I apply the sequence in &gt; column B to just the
        faces, and then the sequence in column C to the &gt; face and the inner
        slice? Or, does it mean to apply the sequence in &gt; B to just the
