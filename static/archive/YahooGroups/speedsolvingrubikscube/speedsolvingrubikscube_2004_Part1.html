          <div class="email-content">I just ordered a skewb, ultimate skewb, and a DIY pyraminx kit from <br>
mefferts.com.<br>
<br>
In the past, I have ordered a Megaminx and a set of tiles, as well <br>
as the Eastsheen christmas bundle from a while back.<br>
<br>
I also have ordered some studio cubes from Ton.<br>
<br>
I have only ordered a diy cube and some stickers from hessport.com<br>
<br>
For someone interested in the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, I seem to throw a lot of <br>
my business in places other than hessport.com.<br>
<br>
Does anyone here buy lots of product from hessport?<br>
<br>
Just wondering.<br>
<br>
BTW, Does anyone know when they will release their DIY speedcube?<br>

&gt; &gt; Thanks for putting this together and including this group, though <br>
&gt; it <br>
&gt; &gt; looks like not very many people have participated yet (from this <br>
&gt; &gt; group).  I did the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 averages, but I&#x27;m confused on <br>
&gt; the <br>
&gt; &gt; instructions for the 4x4x4 scramble... <br>
&gt; &gt; It says &quot;Randomize 4x4 sigle slice movements (B) followed by <br>
double <br>

Hi Grant, <br>
<br>
A Happy New Year! <br>
Thanks for your participating our 100th conmeptition. <br>
I just came back from vacation and uploaded my records which I timed <br>
(only 3x3 categories). <br>
I can see several Japanese participants on our sites. <br>
I will transfer to this site as soon as possible. <br>
That will be more exciting for you guys. <br>
<br>
Sorry for my confusing explanation. <br>
Thanks again for your proper understanding. <br>
Column (B) to just the faces, column (C) is for outer and inner <br>
slices. <br>
ex. R means Rr, B is Bb in column (C). <br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

<br>
Just let you that a 3-D Virtual Rubiks Cube (2x2x2 to 8x8x8) is <br>
available from http://www.vrk.741.com<br>

It can solve 3x3x3 in 4 different ways. Instructions for solving <br>

          <div class="email-content">And of course, as with all the methods, the more you are willing to memorize, the 
more stages you can skip and the faster you can get... like there&#x27;s also the ZB method 
out there which orients the last layer while putting in the last edge/corner pair but I 
think that&#x27;s 300 algorithms.

The results for the 19/12/03 FMC are now online! Also a new <br>
challenge is open and ready for you to take part in. Make it your <br>
New Years Resolution to have a go!<br>
<br>
I have created a discussion group for the Fewest Moves, and intend <br>
to break all discussions and news about fewest moves solving away <br>
from the speedsolvingrubikscube group, and instead post it into the <br>
fewestmoveschallenge group... <br>

My site has gone through some major changes since New Year&#x27;s Eve. I finally <br>
have all of the videos and newspaper links posted. The format of the site is <br>

Eventually I will have all of Ryan Heise&#x27;s method on the site including <br>
optimized sequences and images for the cases.<br>

&gt; Excellent Website, Very top notch Pro style..<br>
<br>
Thanks. It took a while to figure out how I wanted to lay out the site.<br>
<br>
&gt; Question, Are you using the RYans first step too or or just X/f2l-1<br>
&gt; and does ryan use this method at all?<br>
<br>
Right now I use the cross/F2L (minus the last pair). Then I do the rest using <br>
Ryan&#x27;s method. I still have over half of step 4 to learn yet but sometimes I get a <br>
case that I can solve. Eventually I will also be using his step 1. Ryan does use <br>
this method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tom,<br>
<br>
The first thing that comes to mind looking at that table is<br>
&quot;What is the antipode?&quot;.  My guesses are 12-flip<br>
and 12-flip plus 4 dot.<br>
<br>
Let me add that the size of edges-only 3x3x3 <br>
breaks down like this:<br>
<br>
 (2 ^ 12 / 2 ) * 12! =  980,995,276,800<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the biggest cube group calculation<br>
so far. Almost a trillion (10^12) positions, very big <br>
to be sure but still 7 orders of magnitude less that the<br>
full cube.<br>
<br>
The branching factor of this subgroup is a bit unusal:<br>
(someone might want to double check my arithmetric)<br>
<br>
BF starts higher as usual, but then <br>
does an odd dip and goes back up to around 9 and <br>
slowly decreases. Further along the BF decreases<br>
to almost nothing, then increases a bit at the end.<br>

I was expecting such a large group to have more than one antipode,<br>
but I seem to recall Jerry Bryan talking about an unique antipode<br>
for edges only without centres, so perhaps it wasn&#x27;t a complete<br>
surprise.<br>

It&#x27;s the position where each edge is in its diametrically<br>

Hi Tyson<br>
<br>
This is the disassemble position<br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Skewb1.JPG<br>
<br>
Put the Skewb in disassemble postion and pull one center segment up. <br>
Assemble is just the reverse process.<br>
<br>
The parts<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Skewb3.JPG<br>
<br>
<br>
It might be a corner fixed on the axle, so you might have to <br>
disassemble more pieces or rotate an other corner (not on the axle) <br>
counter clock wise. Please note, it could be possible that someone <br>
switches the stickers so check also the sticker layout of this corner.<br>
<br>
Success!<br>

Hi Stefan, 

Thanks for your participating the contests and suggestions. 
I wish I could make more tables. 
Probably, we can&#x27; make more tables.  
Same problem happens in Japanese egroup. 
They seem limiting 10 tables/group. 
So please e-mail me your results for &quot;3 in row&quot; or whatever you have 
problems. 
I will post your records on the web site later. 
Happy cubing.

Just one suggestion, not sure it will work. Try to put &lt;code> ...

I am currently using Guimond&#x27;s method.  The basic Idea is a bit more 
clear (and complete) in his french page.

The basic Idea is to solve the corners in 3 algs.  

First, get all of the corners oriented so that the U and D facelets 
are on the U and D face (1 of 16 algs).  For example, If you want to 
start with Red and Orange as your reference colors, you want all of 
the U corners and all of the D face corners to be red or orange, 
with any mix of red and orange on the U and D face.  

Second, separate the U and D colors, so that you have all of one 
color on the U face, and all of the opposite color on the D face (1 
of 3 algs).

Finally , permute the corners in the U and D layers to solve the 
corners (1 of 5 Algs).  What you are looking for in this step are 
adjacent corners in the U layer and D layer which are in the correct 
position relative to each other.

I am guessing that you are having problems with the first step.

The basic Idea is to start off with exactly 3 U and/or D corner 
facelets on the D face, with the odd corner parked in the DBL 
position.  For example, if you are using Red and Orange as your U 
and D colors, then the D face corners would be red or orange in the 
DFL, DFR, and DBR positions, and there would be a blue, green, 
white, or yellow facelet in the DBL position.  That DBL corner cubie 
will have a Red or Orange sticker on the L face or the B face.

Guimond&#x27;s site shows the 8 U face patterns which exist when you have 
the D face set up as described above, with the red or orange sticker 
on the DBL corner on the L face.  

because it is possible that the DBL corner will have the Red/Orange 
sticker on the B face, there are an additional 8 algs for step 1, 
which are reflections of the first 8 U face patterns shown on 
Guimond&#x27;s site.

Try doing the reverse of each alg on a solved cube and note the 
initial position of the U/D sticker group on both the U and D faces.

Let me know if this helps.

Hi Doug

Lube will help, you can adjust the screws, however they need to be 
tight. The cube is a totaly other mechanism as the Rubik&#x27;s.com cube. 

For the centercap, make little dents on the side of the cap this 
wshould fix the center without glue.

I still tend to have long pauses between algs, and still need to 
work on my edge placement.

Nonetheless, its beginning to feel smoother.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
As you may have noticed we are creating a new category for 3x3x3 <br>
average records (other categories may follow) in the Unofficial <br>
World Records. With this new category we want to have a more <br>
standardized way of measuring averages, so that we can better <br>
compare.<br>
<br>
Please check out the proposed new rules at: <br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/records/records-rules.html#officialrules <br>
(item 11)<br>
Before I proposed these new rules I already discussed them with some <br>
of the fast guys around.<br>
<br>
At the moment I received the following change requests from some of <br>
our respected friends:<br>
<br>
1) use computer generated random scrambles of 25 moves (face turn <br>
metrics)<br>
COMMENT: Add metrics system.<br>
MY PROPOSAL: Face turn metrics.<br>
<br>
2) allow 15 seconds (or less) preinspection<br>
NO COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
3) use speedstack timer, home-built timer or timer program on <br>
computer, measuring hundredths of a second<br>
NO COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
4) place cube on the timer or table (not in the hands)<br>
COMMENT: we should hide the cube (like behind a paper)<br>
MY PROPOSAL: I think hiding the cube (which they also did in <br>
Toronto) is not necessary, as long as you do not wait more than 5 <br>
seconds after preinspection, before starting to solve.<br>
<br>
5) start timer when the hands leave the timer (so not when the <br>
countdown is finished, because then people could cheat a bit of time <br>
picking up early)<br>
COMMENT: it would be better to start the time when the cube leaves <br>
the table.<br>
MY PROPOSAL: I agree that this would be better. But for stopping the <br>
timer it is better to not stop when the cube touches the timer, <br>
because then you could you still do moves when you already stopped <br>
the timer (this is what actually happened in Budapest 1982). To be <br>
more consequent and to copy the way of timing in Toronto 2003, I <br>
think starting with the hands is better.<br>
<br>
6) stop timer, after solving, with the hands on the speedstack <br>
timer, or with both hands on the keyboard/timer pad<br>
COMMENT: same as for 5.<br>
COMMENT: If you use a keyboard, then you cannot check whether both <br>
hands touched the keyboard.<br>
MY PROPOSAL: Still I think this is a better procedure, because it <br>
prevents you from unintentionally stopping the timer while still <br>
doing moves with your other hand.<br>
<br>
7) allow 1 puzzle defect (POP) in an average run (replace it by <br>
extra 13th attempt)<br>
COMMENT: do not allow a pop: this makes it clearer, this prevents <br>
cheating, there is no competition where you are allowed an extra <br>
attempt for a specific defect (like a broken string of a tennis <br>
racket)<br>
MY PROPOSAL: Since people can use their own cubes, they are also <br>
responsible for the quality of their cubes. But in the heat of a <br>
competition it is very hard to solve like you would do at home on <br>
the sofa. It is unpredictable how your cube will behave under <br>
pressure. Having said that, I think that for a &#x27;best of x&#x27; <br>
competition (like the 1st two rounds in Toronto) we do not need to <br>
allow pops. But for a competition based on averages every hundredth <br>
of a second counts. And although I see the benefits of not allowing <br>
pops, I think we should still allow one pop.<br>
<br>
8) allow rolling* averages [this is because otherwise you would be <br>
lucky if an average run would start at the &#x27;best&#x27; moment]<br>
COMMENT: do not allow rolling averages. At a real competition you <br>
wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the officials to disregard your first few <br>
recorded attempts because you were not warmed up yet.<br>
MY PROPOSAL: I think your personal best average should not be <br>
dependent on the lucky moment where you decided to say: &quot;now I start <br>
my average run&quot; and it turned out to be the best moment to start it.<br>
<br>
9) allow lucky cases [this is because you can also be lucky in a <br>
competition] <br>
NO COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
10) take average of 12 attempts: remove best and worst attempt, take <br>
average of the remaining 10 attempts<br>
COMMENT: solving 12 cubes in a competition will be time consuming. <br>
In Toronto we solved 5 cubes.<br>
MY PROPOSAL: 12 cubes is a beautiful number (leaving 10 counted <br>
cubes) and it is a good number to prevent too much luck in an <br>
average record. For competitions I think we could stick to 5 cubes.<br>
<br>
I also received a comment about good light. I absolutely agree with <br>
this, the light in Toronto was not good enough. But I think it <br>
should not be part of the rules.<br>
<br>
These rules imply that we need a good program to facilitate us <br>
(random scrambles, limited preinspection, timer to start, timer to <br>
end, compute averages). Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer program is a very good <br>
start. His program needs some slight changes to deal with rules 2 to <br>
6. I already asked Jess to make a new version of his program.<br>
<br>
Please post your comments on this club, or send me an e-mail.<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t forget that these rules are the rules for UWR. We prefer to <br>
have the same rules for UWR as for official competitions. We cannot <br>
make the official rules. We can propose official rules to the RCC <br>
(see http://www.rubikschamps.com).<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

&gt; standardized way of measuring averages, so that we can better <br>
&gt; compare.<br>
<br>
I agree that some more standardization is necessary to make averages <br>
more comparable - especially with regards to rolling averages... <br>
Here&#x27;s my thoughts (interspersed):<br>
<br>
&gt; 1) use computer generated random scrambles of 25 moves (face turn <br>
&gt; metrics)<br>
Obviously this rule applies only to a 3x3x3 cube - doesn&#x27;t make sense <br>
for larger cubes or other puzzles (at least some of them) without at <br>
least a change to the number of turns.<br>
<br>
&gt; 6) stop timer, after solving, with the hands on the speedstack <br>
&gt; timer, or with both hands on the keyboard/timer pad<br>
<br>
I agree that it&#x27;s important to make sure you&#x27;re not still making <br>
moves while stopping the timer (or even after stopping it).  However, <br>
if using a laptop or some other keyboard with a small spacebar (which <br>
I would assume is still used to stop the timer), or if you have <br>
exceptionally large hands, it may be difficult to put both hands on <br>
the timer stopper.  It may be more practical to say that, if not <br>
using a speedstacks timer, the puzzle must be put down, and the timer <br>
stopped with the last hand that touched the puzzle.  For example, <br>
while holding the puzzle in my left hand, I apply a U turn with the <br>
right hand.  I then (after removing my right hand from the cube) put <br>
the puzzle down with my left hand, and hit the space bar with the <br>
left hand to stop the timer.  Because the puzzle is put down and the <br>
timer stopped with the same hand, and in that order, it guarantees <br>
that I&#x27;m not making moves after the timer stops.<br>
<br>
&gt; 8) allow rolling* averages [this is because otherwise you would be <br>
&gt; lucky if an average run would start at the &#x27;best&#x27; moment]<br>
&gt; MY PROPOSAL: I think your personal best average should not be <br>
&gt; dependent on the lucky moment where you decided to say: &quot;now I<br>
&gt; start my average run&quot; and it turned out to be the best moment to<br>
&gt; start it.<br>
<br>
I suppose it depends on what you want to compare - if you want to <br>
compare your absolute best average against that of others, then you <br>
should be allowed to use a rolling average.  If, instead, you want to <br>
compare an average set of speed-solves, then you should not take a <br>
rolling average.  By saying &quot;Now, I&#x27;m starting my average&quot;, it <br>
probably approximates a more average set of solves.  If you wanted to <br>
get a bit more confusing about it, I suppose we could, instead, take <br>
an &quot;average&quot; average - solve 23 cubes, and take the rolling average <br>
(the 12 cubes solved in a row during those 23 solves) that is the <br>
median value of the 12 available rolling averages.  Of course, I&#x27;m <br>
sure we&#x27;d all hurt ourselves trying to figure that out consistently, <br>
so it&#x27;s probably not a good way to do it.<br>
<br>
&gt; 10) take average of 12 attempts: remove best and worst attempt,<br>
&gt; take average of the remaining 10 attempts<br>
I agree that 12 is good, except for puzzles that take a longer time <br>
to do... Is this perhaps why more people haven&#x27;t taken a megaminx <br>
average?   ;-)<br>

attendre et en même temps en moins de 30 secondes sans magie. <br>
Blindfold avec les nombres mais pas le cube :)) Toi ta place est <br>

no speed or fewest move cubist. I had the video Ralph in guinness 
for you. Ralph is good but the witness scramble the cube a little 
bit!

Excuse my poor english.

Guinness voulais me voir avec le cube et mes multiplications mais je

Ralph a suivi. Guinness voulait savoir si mon blindfold était

And I dont want to threat my cube that way.

<br>
&gt; 1) use computer generated random scrambles of 25 moves (face turn <br>
&gt; metrics)<br>
<br>
Did anyone write a scrambler that results in a random scrambled<br>
*state* rather than in a random scrambling *algorithm*? I.e. it<br>
randomly generates a scrambled state and then finds a scrambling<br>
algorithm to reach it, for example with Kociemba&#x27;s cube solver. I&#x27;d<br>
say this is even &quot;better randomness&quot; but it usually takes *less* than<br>
25 moves...<br>
<br>
&gt; 6) stop timer, after solving, with the hands on the speedstack <br>
&gt; timer, or with both hands on the keyboard/timer pad<br>
<br>
Oh boy am I happy to have a stackmat. Earlier I tried the computer to<br>
stop the time but I wasted time by hitting the spacebar and hitting it<br>
softly (I will not hit my laptop hard).<br>

          <div class="email-content">With the way my computer is set up (and probably some other ppl too) the keyboard is right in front of the monitor.  I don&#x27;t want to risk hurting the cube by throwing it, (going to stop the timer) hiting the monitor, or accidentally pressing another key when i drop the cube which (with current timers) could accidentally reset the timer.  It would almost be required for me to set the cube down next to the monitor then reach back over to stop the timer (which would take way to long).
 
I am all for the rolling averages.  The UWR (to my understanding) are for speedcubers to compare their times with other cubers.  If rolling averages were banned, we would have to be lucky for our best times to go up, and there are strict rules against &quot;lucky&quot; times.
 
About the lucky times included in averages...I think one lucky time should be allowed, but further times should be discarded.  This is because one time is discarded to help account for luck, (and another dropped for anti-luck) but if there were more than one lucky time, it would skew your average.  I average around 40-45 seconds on the cube now, but with luck I have gotten a few 20 second times.  I&#x27;m sure you can see how that could throw off an average...
 
Just my thoughts
 happy cubing

Many thanks for the advice, after I played with it for a while, the
center caps were fine, and after lubing the cube, it moves *great*.  It
moves much smoother than my 3x3x3 ever has.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier (well
I could be, but it wouldnt have anything to do with the cube :-) ).

If you are talking about speed solving, then there is nothing to 
mess up.  It is a corners first solution, so you can disregard the 
position and orientation of all edges (and centers)while solving the 
corners.  Once your corners are set, then you can wory about solving 
your edges.

Once you have your 3 corners set on the bottom face (0-2 moves), the 
U layer corner patterns are easy to recognize. 8/16 cases need 3 
moves to orient the corners.  4/16 cases need 4 moves.  2/16 need 5 
moves.  2/16 need 6 moves.

the next step is to separate the U corners from the D corners, then 
you permute all the corners at once.

The first step really doesn&#x27;t require much time to figure out your 
first moves.  The second step only has 3 algs.  The final step to 
solve the corners only has 5 algs.

so you get a relatively fast start, and don&#x27;t really require much 
inspection to get started.

          <div class="email-content">Ron,
Great work.  While there are a couple of small points I&#x27;d like to 
chime in on, I definitely want to start by applauding your efforts to 
bring a more standardized approach to the way we keep records.  It&#x27;s 
particularly helpful to have these guidelines since most of us are 
doing all our own setup and timing, and could use the guidance.

Here are my comments:

Piece pops:  I agree with the line of thinking that we should not 
allow an additional attempt if a piece pops out.  The reasons you 
list against the extra attempt, such as that it prevents cheating, 
and that no other competition allows an extra attempt, are good ones, 
and I would add one other.  The potential for a piece popping out is 
just one of a number of things that is remedied by being able to 
throw out an extra attempt.  Different speedcubers have different 
styles.  One person goes fast and occasionally pops a piece.  One 
person slows down a little to avoid chronic piece pops but as a 
result ends up with slightly slower times.  On person is recklessly 
fast but sometimes they end up screwing up a solve completely and 
recording a ridiculously slow time.  Each of these types of people 
has reasons to want to throw out their worst attempt.  Why should the 
person in the first case get to throw out up to two attempts (the pop 
and then the slowest non-pop time) while the others only get to throw 
out one attempt?  If you want to have people be able to throw out a 
pop and a slow time, then do an average of 13 and let EVERYBODY throw 
out their worst two attempts, regardless of whether the attempt 
involves the cube coming apart, the solver forgetting an algorithm, 
or just that they were going deliberately slow and ended up with one 
or two slower than desired times.  I can see people wanting the extra 
attempt because it results in faster times, but other than that 
there&#x27;s really no strong case for allowing it.

Stopping the timer:  I noticed when I was timing myself on a computer 
that I had a tendency to hit the spacebar to stop the clock as I was 
setting down the cube.  I suppose that might shave off a few 
hundredths if I&#x27;m turning off the timer before the cube hits the 
table.  I like the idea Grant suggested in his reply to your email... 
that the timer should be stopped by the last hand that touched the 
cube after solving it, to ensure that you&#x27;ve actually set the cube 
down before stopping the timer.

Rolling averages vs planned start:  In most competitions you can warm 
up all you want but you have to decide ahead of time that you&#x27;re 
doing the official time trial, or long jump, or high jump, or 
whatever, if you want it to count.  You can&#x27;t decide after a 
performance whether it was warmup or actual competition.  The only 
case I could make for doing this would be that it would (obviously) 
yield slightly faster times, but I think the goal of what you&#x27;re 
trying to do here isn&#x27;t to improve the speed of the scores that 
speedcubers submit, but rather to improve the credibility and 
integrity of those scores.

Thanks again,
Adam

The behind the back solves look impressive, but unless I see the 
feat done in person, with a 3rd party scrambling an unfamiliar cube 
(to avoid tactile cues from a familiar cube), I cannot dismiss the 
possiblity that the feat is done with a pre set cube.

There was some magician at the RWC who had a &quot;mixed&quot; cube and had 
this trick where he asked me to do one more turn on the cube and 
hand it back to him.  He then asked me to pick a number, then 
proceeded to do a behind the back &quot;solve&quot; of the cube in the same 
number of turns as the number I picked.  

Impressive?  Yes and no.  The odd magician guy at the RWC pretty 
much unscrambled the cube rather than solving it in a step by step 
manner.  I would guess that he has a rehearsed unscrambling alg of a 
fixed number of moves, and a few holding pattern algs that he can 
insert so that his total number of moves equaled my given number.  
How do I know that he unscrambled the cube rather than solve it?  
First of all, his cube was in horrendous condition, and felt like it 
was lubed with pine tar.  No self respecting cuber would stand for 
using a crap cube like that.  Secondly, There was no solving method 
apparent.  The cube was mixed then it was solved.  No F2L, No layer 
by layer, no Petrus, no corners first.  I should have had him 
attempt a regular solve on a real cube to confirm that the guy 
probably doesn&#x27;t know how to even solve the cube.

Gaetan is actually solving the cube behind his back, and doing so 
rather skillfuly.  This is impressive even if it is rehearsed.

On the other hand, if the feat is real and unrehearsed, then there 
is no actual reason for anyone else to actually work on blindfold 
solves, as it would be futile to try to do better than Gaetan. 

I understand that blindfold solving entails memorizing the position 
and orientation of every cubie, executing a step, then reassessing 
and memorizing the O/P of the cubies, doing another small step that 
affects only a few cubies, reassessing and memorizing, and so on.

Looking at Gaetan&#x27;s videos, I see no evidence of this process.  It 
looks a lot to me like a straight solve.

          <div class="email-content">I started to use rolling averages recently not mainly because of<br>
faster times. Of course I am after faster times but I do it to have an<br>
easier life.<br>
<br>
Often I started a &quot;planned&quot; average and after a few attempts I saw<br>
that it would end very bad unless I would do the remaining solves<br>
*very* fast. But then I should better &quot;declare&quot; the average finished<br>
and not really finish it, instead start a new &quot;planned&quot; average<br>
(possibly beginning with those hopefully very fast times).<br>
<br>
But I worried whether it&#x27;s legitimate to truncate averages this way.<br>
Well, I had the excuse &quot;I could just as well pop it intentionally<br>
twice to make the average invalid and that would be a real reason to<br>
discontinue&quot;. But that&#x27;s not nice.<br>
<br>
Also, I saw DanK&#x27;s quote: &quot;I got the 14, popped a piece on the second<br>
solution, decided to start a new average, then got a 16, and decided<br>
to keep going with this average.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think that&#x27;s not nice either but I can very well understand him.<br>
<br>
So to end all this damn discussion in my head and stop worrying about<br>
it I decided that I would switch to rolling averages. So, only<br>
indirectly to get faster times.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Looks like people got their puzzles and the problem is solved, but
since I promised to report: I ordered seven or eight puzzles together
with six free keychain ones (thanks to their Xmas special) on December
29th. They had some questions before they sent it out but I answered
on December 30th and they said they&#x27;d send it away the same day. I
asked for a tracking number and was told they&#x27;d give it to me (they
haven&#x27;t so far but they had already warned me they&#x27;d be in holidays
for a few days). Well, today I received the puzzles and everything
looks good (as far as I can tell, didn&#x27;t have more than two minutes to
look inside the box before leaving home). Well, the Pyramorphix looked
kind of strange but that&#x27;s kinda expected ;-)

So, overall I&#x27;m very happy getting the puzzles a week after ordering
them, especially considering the time of the year...

Hi Jasmine,

   Is there anything stopping you from opening and running such a
store? You already know what it looks like and what puzzles it sells.

i wonder how many of us have had &quot;this&quot; dream...

i&#x27;ve had a dream or two about stumbling into a &quot;secret&quot; puzzle 
shop...usually it&#x27;s hidden in the back of some place that i&#x27;ve known 
about for years, but then i move a few boxes, or find a well-hidden

another variation, is finding boxes of old and forgotten about stock 
from the 80&#x27;s in some old store or shop that hardly anyone goes to 
anymore.

I was just about to send my input by replying to this topic, but i <br>
read adam&#x27;s reply first.  That is almost exactly was I was going to <br>
type.  Obviously, not allowing an extra solve for a piece pop is more <br>
fair.  I used to pop my cube quite frequently but then I&#x27;ve began to <br>
slow down, learn better finger tricks that cause pops less frequently <br>
and tighten my cube a little.  I&#x27;m for not allowing a 13th solve, but <br>
that&#x27;s just me.  I realize many will be against this, but this isnt <br>
all that big of a deal to me. <br>
<br>
The thing that I feel more strongly about is the rolling averages.  <br>
Adam&#x27;s example of choosing if a solve is warm-up or competition is <br>
perfect.  You shouldn&#x27;t be able to do that.  The goal of taking <br>
averages is not to get your best times on one single average (thus <br>
making your best average).  It is to bring all of your times down.  <br>
An average of your times should reflect an average solve for you.  <br>
Not a fortunate occurrance of your best solves.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I agree with the other rules though, I think it is a good <br>
idea to have all posters post by these to make things more fair. <br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt;Stopping the timer:  I noticed when I was timing myself on a <br>
&gt;computer that I had a tendency to hit the spacebar to stop the <br>
&gt;clock as I was setting down the cube.  I suppose that might shave <br>
&gt;off a few hundredths if I&#x27;m turning off the timer before the cube <br>
&gt;hits the <br>
&gt;table.  I like the idea Grant suggested in his reply to your <br>
&gt;email... that the timer should be stopped by the last hand that <br>
&gt;touched the cube after solving it, to ensure that you&#x27;ve actually <br>
&gt;set the cube down before stopping the timer.<br>
<br>
Actually, when I first read Grant&#x27;s idea of touching the spacebar <br>
with the hand that last touched the cube I had a slightly different <br>
idea in my head. To me, stopping the timer has nothing to do with <br>
the cube resting on a table, but rather with me finishing my last <br>
turn. What I&#x27;ve begun do is hit the spacebar with the last hand that <br>
was actively turning the cube, since it&#x27;s not always the same one. <br>
Seems to me like that is enough to ensure that I&#x27;m done solving. I <br>
dont see why the cube must be set down. I&#x27;m guessing the reason why <br>
people did that at the championships is because they had to use both <br>
hands to stop the Stackmat timer.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys,

   People coordinate themselves differently, and have different ways 
of timing. The important things are that the timer doesn&#x27;t start 
after the solve has begun and that the timer is not stopped before 
the solve is finished. I think that if someone is timing themselaves 
at home any means of accomplishing that should be fine.

Don&#x27;t forget Jess Bonde, the official world record holder. 
He does cross on left as Jessica does.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug, <br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t look through the other&#x27;s method. <br>
But I hear a lot of tips and have accumulated. <br>
I think it is basically as same as the others. <br>
Are there big differences among blidfold methods such as LBL and CF?<br>
<br>
2x2, 3x3 corners:<br>
For memorization 8 numbers, UBL=1, UBR=2,...DFL=5, DFR=6...(clockwise <br>
on both U and D)<br>
<br>
I saw Dror was teaching (RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3 to Macky at WC. <br>
This is really good and easy algorithm. <br>
(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3 Ux (RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3 U&#x27;x moves three corners between U and D. <br>
<br>
3x3 edges: <br>
Currently I use 12 numbers for memorization. <br>
<br>
I could not understand how to determine the orientation especially <br>
for middle edges. Macky posted tips somewhere but I did not <br>
understand at that time. <br>
Yesterday, I just realized it! <br>
<br>
It is easy to determine the orientation of the edges in U and D and <br>
to be placed in U and D. <br>
Suppose UF &gt; RF. Imagine placing the UF edge to UR by U&#x27; and then do <br>
edge three rotation with UR, RF, and DR. If the final orientation is <br>
correct, the original orientation was correct. <br>
As long as you solve the edges through UR, UL, DR, DL (not from M <br>
slice!) placing by Ux or Dx, you will not loose the orientation. <br>
(Do you understand?)<br>
<br>
The algorithms I used are u2R&#x27;uR2u&#x27;R&#x27;u2 (u=middle slice move) and its <br>
variation.And F2r&#x27;F2r and its variation. <br>
<br>
You should know the algorithms for either corners and edges with in U <br>
or D. <br>
<br>
Because I am not native English speaker, so I don&#x27;t know how people <br>
remember these numbers. As Macky says, Japanese language may help <br>
memorization by making mnemonics. <br>
<br>
For example I can remember 524 as Konishi. (It is Katsu&#x27;s family <br>
name!)<br>
<br>
(I am thinking to use Japanese characters &quot;Hiragana&quot; instead of <br>
numbers because they order in pentimal system. )<br>

CONGRATS MASAYUKI!!!

I knew you would figure it out.  I think that you are currently 
online.  I found it very interesting that you said it is easier to 
memorize numbers in Japonese.  I study languages (Ancient Greek 
philosophy and Latin poetry mainly but also French and German) and 
so I am always very interested in the way that some thoughts are 
easier to express in one language than another (especially when it 
comes to philosophy).  Numeric memorization lends another dimension 
to this!!

Doug,

glad to hear that you are interested in blindfolding.  I am a VERY 
newcomer to it myself (first success Dec 9) and far, far, far from 
the abilities of Dror, Macky, David, and Dr Carr, but I just love it.
It is a feat certainly within reach of any competent cuber and a 
real thrill every time you are successful.  As far as I know there 
are two main schools of blindfolding (someone please correct me if 
I&#x27;m wrong) - Dr. Carr&#x27;s method and Stiff_Hands&#x27; method.
Personally I learnt Dr. Carr&#x27;s method from an easy to follow pdf 
file I found online.  Problem is that I can&#x27;t remember exactly where 
I found it.  I thought that it was in the files section of this chat 
group but when I checked just now I couldn&#x27;t find it.  His website 
would be the logical place to start looking (and I believe that Dr. 
Carr checks into this group on a fairly regular basis):

http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/cube.html



Stiff_Hands also has a very good website on Blindfolding (and other 
cube topics):

http://homepage.ntlworld.com/family.hayden/cube/blindfold_frontpage.h
tml

definately check out the tips on memorization there (this may well 
be of interest to you too STEPHAN).  One small word of warning.  
Stiff_Hands and Dr. Carr use slightly different approaches to 
numbering the cubies.  Neither one is right or wrong - they are just 
different.  I suggest that you pick one and stick with it to avoid 
confusion.


The basic trick to blindfolding is to learn how to solve the corners 
without affecting the edges, and the edges without affecting the 
corners.  (With the one small exception of the parity swap of 2 
edges and 2 corners if it arises - but it is pretty easy to spot 
with a little practise).  This can be practised with your eyes open 
first so that you accustom yourself to the solution path first 
before trying to do it blind.  While I was learning I used to solve 
all the edges with my eyes open and then just blindfold the corners -
 this is better than using a 2x2x2 because it lets you know if you 
have altered the edge orientations or positions.  When I was 
tolerably good at that I would visually solve the corners and then 
blindfold the edges.  Finally I combined them and because I had 
practised the stages individually I was lucky enough to be 
successful on my first ever full blindfold attempt.  Break the big 
problem into smaller problems and it is easier to conquer.

If anyone is still reading this message then they are clearly 
interested in blindfolding so let me take this opportunity to let 
them know that there is also a Yahoo chatgroup dedicated to 
blindfold solving:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/

Membership is currently very small and the messages are very 
infrequent.  BUT it seems that more and more people are becoming 
intrigued by blindfold solving so maybe it can come to life again.

Good luck Doug.

WELL DONE MASAYUKI!

Rob

Using Hiragana is a very clever Idea.  How would you encode for the 
digits 6, 7, 8, 9, 0?  Would you reserve certain sound groups for 
these digits (eg, Ma Mi Mu Me Mo corresponding to 6 7 8 9 0, and not 
1 2 3 4 5)?

There is a mnemonic method that can be used in english for 
memorizing digits, but it may not be as flexible as using Kana.

For english speakers, the system works by assigning consonant sounds 
to each digit:

0  S or Z 
1  T or D
2  N
3  M
4  R
5  L
6  Sh or J
7  K or G (hard G, as in Gun, and not in German)
8  F or V
9  P or B

Some of the digits have more than one sound associated, but they are 
similar in that the sounds are formed the same way (note the way you 
position your tongue when you pronounce the T in tie or the D in 
die).

then you just add vowels between the consonants to make words.

So, where you would encode 524 as Ko Ni Shi in hiragana, the english 
system might be used to encode it as eyeLiNeR (vowel sounds have no 
corresponding digit value, so &quot;eye&quot; has no value) LiNeaR, LuNaR, and 
so on. Conversely, Masayuki Akimoto = 307 731

I agree with Rob&#x27;s old comment &quot;it is not as difficult as you think.&quot;<br>

It is difficult but those who remember more than 100s of algorithms <br>

different. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations!

However - and I hope you understand that I don&#x27;t want to be mean - I 
think most of us blindfolded solvers do not take any notes (before 
having solved the puzzle) and you say yourself that taking notes 
makes it much easier for you. So I think we should either have a 
separate category or we state in our submissions what kind of help 
we used.

I do think that posting semiblindfolded records somehow especially 
for new puzzles might be a good idea, since if someone makes 
progress somewhere that others haven&#x27;t thought about yet it might 
incite them to try it, too.

If Richard and the other guys from the &quot;amazing&quot; list had taken 
notes for their attempts I&#x27;d of course be less impressed than I am 
now. More importantly, it wouldn&#x27;t be fair if one of them took notes 
and the other doesn&#x27;t and their results look the same, possibly even 
making the note taker look better because he got a better time or 
more cubes or a harder puzzle or whatever (it&#x27;s not constrained to 
speedblindsolving only).

Cheers!

You could, but since the messages are restricted rather than public, 
as in this group, I tend not to post there. I don&#x27;t know if this is 
true of other blindfold cubists.

Well done on your success!

I&#x27;d agree with this. It may be a good step towards no notes though. 
I&#x27;m still infuriatingly just shy of 3+3+4+5 (one edge transposition 
out on 4x4x4 is best so far) and I think that with notes it would 
probably be easier, although my main problems here are a slightly 
slippy 4, a slightly stiff 5 and trying to concentrate for 2.5 hours 
without losing it.

Actually, for 5 (or even 4), if anyone has an algorithm for centre 3 
cycles of the following form:
 F face      B face
AAA          XXX  
AAA          XXX
AAC          AXX

(i.e. something that effectively puts the C in the F face into the 
place occupied by the A on the B face using, e.g., the marked A (or 
another equivalent) on the F face)), it would make solving the 5 
blindfolded a lot easier.

3rd link on the links page. It&#x27;s a fairly primitive method that is 
described there, though. I have been working on something much better 
for a while now (though this new method is too hard for me to learn).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Rob (and all),<br>
<br>
My understanding of this mnemonic system is that some of it has logic but maybe not all.  Each letter has a range of words associated with it that can also be used in similar systems.  For example T for 1 can be thought of as a toe which would remind you of a 1, N for 2 reminds you of Noah and pairs of animals, L is roman numeral for 50 and so 5 etc - I think i read this in a book by Tony Buzan or someone similar who is very good on this sort of thing. I&#x27;ve forgotten most of what I ever knew (and not just about mnemonics either!).<br>
<br>
Incidentally when I used to solve blindfold with my friend John White in the early 80s (John was down as the world record holder until fairly recently I think) we never used any such systems - just remember where each cubie was and followed it around as we planned our solve.  John was pretty good and solved probably 90% of the time and in around 20 minutes as I recall.  He appeared on TV in around 1983 in the UK where he sadly took two looks to solve.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think he cubes any more but I know he still has a huge selection of cube type puzzles (more than 20 different types I think maybe a lot more).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi GoD2,

   I was expressing these ideas in English, and I see it has led to
misunderstanding. Put aside formal language for the moment. 

   Infinities have finite aspects: though a series of numbers like
1,2,3,4 is considered to have no end (that is no limit finite meaning
an end or a limit) it has a beginning. It also has individual numbers
like 1 or 10,000,001 which is another finite aspect. SO in relating to
an finite aspect of an infine series you (logically and fairly) realte
to a fiven point so the group of numbers divisible by 2 is larger than
the group of numbers divisible by three, so i consider the subset to
be of different sizes as well.

   If you take *all* of the numbers in the infinirte set 1,2,3,4 and
so forth, and consider that as one whole thing you can relate to the
idea of infinity equalling one if you graph it. So on our graph as the
position of the number 2, half of all the numbers after that are not
prime, this is what I meant by density, after the number 3, you have
1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6 of the numbers after that are not prime, so the
&quot;density&quot; of non-prime numbers grows and the density of possible prime
numbers drops.

   To clarify, I was using density to mean the *percentage* of numbers
beyond a prime that are not prime.

   You can chart this, in numerical order one step at a time, and
after a while obtain a line with characteristics that can be noted,
and from which it may possible to predict where the next prime is
likely to fall.

   For this density to reach zero would mean that there were no prime
numbers after a particular point, which I don&#x27;t think can happen. 

***

   People are misled by misunderstanding a term. They don&#x27;t understand
that they&#x27;re dealing an infinity of finite objects and they neatly
overlook what that means.

   When you misplay infinities you get things like 1/9 = .11111...
(point one unending) and 8/9 = .88888... (point eight unending) so 1/9
+ 8/9 +=9/9 = .99999... (point nine unending) = 1.

   This is like Zeno&#x27;s paradox that .9 unending is an infinite series
of nines, almost getting to one but not quite.
   You shoot an arrow at a fence then describe it as &quot;the arrow goes
halfway there, then half way there, etc.&quot; Thought the arrow hits the
fence the description never gets there.

Regards,

David J

on that little &quot;factoid&quot; about the population of china<br>
in a single file line...<br>
<br>
him: if the population of china walked past you in a<br>
single file line, the line would never end due to the<br>
rate of reproduction.<br>
<br>
him: cool, eh?<br>
<br>
me: yes it would<br>
<br>
him: not it wouldnt, lol<br>
<br>
me: theres a three year gap in which someone is born<br>
and that person could walk<br>
<br>
me: eventually<br>
me: it would end or have a slight reprieve<br>
<br>
him: not at the rate they walk<br>
<br>
me: ah<br>
<br>
him: people walk about 6mph on average<br>
<br>
me: indeed<br>
me: but supposing that this straight line were to be<br>
compiled beforehand and then you were positioned<br>
somewhere in the area of...lets say taiwan<br>
<br>
him: its assuming you start where you can see the<br>
front of the line<br>
<br>
me: I dare say that line (being straight, of course)<br>
would extend from taiwan (where you are) well into<br>
russia, india, or kazakhstan depending on the angle<br>

him: or right into the pacific :-)<br>

me: and how do you have sex and reproduce and care for<br>
a child well enough for it to walk when burdened by<br>
having to be in a straight line walking past some<br>
asshole who wants to formulate a fantastical situation<br>
to emphasize the growth of your country&#x27;s population<br>
me: then of course, there are the drowned men who walk<br>

Hi Rob

http://www.geosoc.org/schools/pass/memory/mema8.htm

It is called the Major System.  I don&#x27;t know how old it is, but it 
has been around for a while.  I learned it from a book called Mega 
Memory by Kevin Trudeau (the infomercial guy).  I subsequently 
discovered that all of his material was pretty much just repackaged 
material from other memory systems.  

He actually had a pretty good way of teaching the Major System, 
which I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere else.  

He first created Peg Lists in the early part of the course which you 
could use to associate with the information you want to learn.  One 
of the lists was the Body List

Toes
Knees
Muscle (as in your quad muscles)
Rear
Love handles
Shoulders
Collar
Face
Point (the point at the top of your head)
Ceiling

So you just work your way up your body from toes to ceiling.  Later 
on, he explains why those specific words were chosen for the body 
list, and then just has you note the initial sound from the body 
list and just assigns digits to the list in the same order.

I have seen the Major List in a memory course from Harry Lorayne 
which was published in 1968.  I suspect that the method is much 
older though.

          <div class="email-content">I personally get a little annoyed every time I hear someone say they 
used to peel the stickers off, but in their defense I guess people 
don&#x27;t see cubes around much so it seems like a clever thing to say 
on the rare occasion that they see someone (you) doing the cube.  
I&#x27;m curious though why *everyone* says it.  I too very rarely meet 
someone who sees me do it for the first time who doesn&#x27;t comment 
about peeling the stickers off.  I wonder if it was those sticker 
sets that they marketed as the &quot;ultimate solution&quot;, or maybe when 
people got frustrated at it and someone finally DID peel the 
stickers off and told a friend, that it spread like wildfire and 
everyone did it.  I still find it annoying when I hear it, but I 
find it really interesting that it really does seem to me that 95% 
of the people who&#x27;ve seen me do it for the first time give the 
sticker comment.

Maybe we should all cube in public and take a survey about the 
number of times approached about your solving versus the number of 
times you get the sticker comment. :)

Just pitching in my two cents,
Chris

Yeah the sticker comment is irritating and ubiquitous.  I heard it <br>
in the 80s in the UK when I first solved it as a schoolboy and I <br>
still hear it all the time on university campuses in Canada.  <br>
Instead of the fake laugh I usually just respond:<br>
<br>
&quot;yeah I&#x27;ve heard of that technique but I don&#x27;t use it since it takes <br>
way too long&quot;<br>

I&#x27;ve heard the comment too... Quite a lot.  Either that, or &quot;I used <br>
to just take it apart&quot;, which happens to be what I did as a kid, not <br>
wanting to mess up the stickers.  However, should we react to people <br>
with annoyance?  Like Chris said - most people aren&#x27;t used to seeing <br>
cubes on a regular basis, as we are.  If you want to get others <br>
interested in cubing, take their comment as a conversation starter, <br>
rather than getting annoyed and/or turning them away with a rash <br>
response - tell them how you got initiated to the cube, and learned <br>
to solve it the right way!  If you used to do the same or take it <br>
apart to solve it, fess up, and then share how your method&#x27;s <br>
changed...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Dear everyone who loves Rubik&#x27;s cube,<br>
<br>
Nice to meet(?) you!  I am a Japanese cubist.<br>
I am happy to post messages here for the first time.<br>
<br>
I would like to ask a question.<br>
According to `Metamagical Themas&#x27; written by D. R. Hofstadter,<br>
for 3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s cube, the number of the least move to reach the <br>
worst case is 22 or 23 in the sense of face turns.<br>
On the other hand, on several webpages I read that such a number is <br>
not known. (Only lower and upper bounds are known.)<br>
So, I am confused.<br>
At least, I have confirmed that the Caley graph is applied to prove <br>
it if possible.<br>
<br>
I would be glad if someone tells me the truth and introduces the <br>
related sites, papers and books.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to good replies.<br>
<br>
With best regards,<br>
Takemi<br>

          <div class="email-content">First of all, I love the replies about it being slower than your way.

Secondly, I&#x27;m pretty sure when people make the sticker comment, they 
don&#x27;t mean that they actually did it.  I think it&#x27;s just an amusing 
reply to lighten up the moment.  Think of it this way, we&#x27;re showing 
off in front of someone by doing the cube... how can they reply when 
we&#x27;re done?  People usually aren&#x27;t comfortable fawning over a 
showoff, even when the thing we&#x27;re showing off is pretty cool.  So 
they make a comment that both acknowledges that what we&#x27;re doing is 
impressive, but also teases us about it by implying that it&#x27;s 
something they wouldn&#x27;t even be interested in trying to do.  (But 
they&#x27;re sort of also making fun of themselves, which makes the 
comment less offensive.)  You&#x27;ll notice that the people who make a 
joke about it will still stand around and watch us solving the cube.  
They&#x27;re just not inclined to let us hog the spotlight too much, and 
who can blame them!  I would say unless someone is only solving to 
gain attention, it&#x27;s easy to take the sticker comment in the light, 
good-natured way it&#x27;s intended.  When you hear it, maybe take it as a 
reminder that there&#x27;s a limit to how long you should be the center of 
attention!

Still, I agree it&#x27;s really interesting that nearly everyone knows 
that joke.  Just shows the extent to which the cube has become a 
cultural icon.

          <div class="email-content">I personally would love to compete in a contest that had the same 
events and was run in the same format as the World Championship this 
past summer.  Since those events will probably set a precedence for 
the way future competitions are run, I think it would be a great 
idea to have a contest that is run exactly like the Championships so 
that we can all practice the events the way we are going to have to 
do them in 2005.  That of course assumes the contest is still on for 
2005 but you see my point.  I&#x27;m not saying that you have to set up 
your contest this way Raul, I&#x27;m just throwing out ideas for everyone 
to discuss.  We might as well all be very familiar with the official 
way of doing things rather than just the categories we all have 
gotten used to for the unofficial lists.

I&#x27;d like to see this form of competition start to become popular, 
personally, and would be willing to help out if others are 
interested in the idea.  Perhaps Raul, if you are interested you 
could include maybe a few of the official categories in your 
contest.  I&#x27;m not saying you have to, again I&#x27;m just throwing out 
ideas.

Would anyone be interested in the idea of doing a Sunday contest 
style competition but with official competition rules and events?  
Perhaps we can all discuss and see what everyone thinks.

Chris

get a couple sub 40 times if all goes right.  I havent memorized any

          <div class="email-content">I see what you mean Chris. The idea is interesting. You mean like having certain rounds scheduled at a specific time of day, then choosing the people that move on to the next round...? If so, it would have to be more than a day though, because not everyone is in the same time zone, or people could agree to one time, and we all stay up. That might be a lot to do on a weekly basis, but it would be great It&#x27;s the next best thing to all of us meeting. 
 
For those of you who werent sure what all the events were, here is the link. I didnt know myself since I wasnt there :&#x27;( lol

idea to have a contest that is run exactly like the Championships so 
that we can all practice the events the way we are going to have to 
do them in 2005.  That of course assumes the contest is still on for 
2005 but you see my point.  I&#x27;m not saying that you have to set up 
your contest this way Raul, I&#x27;m just throwing out ideas for everyone 
to discuss.  We might as well all be very familiar with the official 
way of doing things rather than just the categories we all have 
gotten used to for the unofficial lists.

I&#x27;d like to see this form of competition start to become popular, 
personally, and would be willing to help out if others are 
interested in the idea.  Perhaps Raul, if you are interested you 
could include maybe a few of the official categories in your 
contest.  I&#x27;m not saying you have to, again I&#x27;m just throwing out 
ideas.

Would anyone be interested in the idea of doing a Sunday contest 
style competition but with official competition rules and events?  
Perhaps we can all discuss and see what everyone thinks.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys,

   I get a wide variety of comments.

   Of the last 100 comments maybe only 3 were of the &quot;I just peel off
the sticker&quot; variety. Two of these were admitting that they gave up. 

   My most frequent comment is a question, &quot;What&#x27;s the secret to
solving that?&quot; I must confess that I sometimes answer, &quot;Knowing what
you&#x27;re doing.&quot;

   &quot;Holy Crap!! You just solved that, didn&#x27;t you?&quot;

   &quot;What&#x27;s your fastest time?&quot;

   &quot;I had one of these and never could figure it out.&quot;

   &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen one of those since the early 70&#x27;s. (Yeah Right!)

   &quot;Oh cool. I solved that a long time ago, maybe I should dig out my
old one.&quot;

   Depends on the mood, saying something like, &quot;Yes, doing it that way
has appeal!&quot; sort of bring the conversation to a halt.

   They&#x27;re asking if you solve it systematically. Tell them &quot;Yes, I
use the Lar Petrus Method. Brilliant bloke, really brilliant.&quot; :)

The sticker comment really doesn&#x27;t anger me that much except when 
some people just say like it&#x27;s the funniest thing in the world and 
expect me to luagh as much they are.

I uaually say &quot;if you&#x27;re going to cheat at least take it apart and 
reassemble it&quot; or say &quot;wel, my way&#x27;s a lot faster&quot;.

This comment also parallels the &quot;where are your shoes???&quot; that I 
many times a day.

          <div class="email-content">Or another possibility is that the 26 q process is <br>
21 q+h _but_ there is also another process which<br>
can solve 12-flip + 4 dot in 20 q+h moves BUT needs<br>
28 quarter turns.<br>
<br>
The known limit is still 20 q+h turns.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   What I&#x27;d like to see in a tournament is something like this: when
you get down to the final three contestants, each contestant has ten
or twelve cubes to unscramble. The timer begins when the cloth is
removed from over the cubes and stops when the final solved cube is
placed in a particular place. Whoever unscrambles all the cubes first
wins.

   No if and, or buts, no pops, no preinspection time. The entire time
you spend unscrambling the cube is counted.

   I only express this as an idea. I doubt anyone is interested in
doing it this way.

I&#x27;d like to see this form of competition start to become popular,

could include maybe a few of the official categories in your

Would anyone be interested in the idea of doing a Sunday contest 
style competition but with official competition rules and events?  
Perhaps we can all discuss and see what everyone thinks.

Dear everyone who loves Rubik&#x27;s cube,

Nice to meet(?) you!  I am a Japanese cubist.
I am happy to post messages here for the first time.

I would like to ask a question.
According to `Metamagical Themas&#x27; written by D. R. Hofstadter,
for 3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s cube, the number of the least move to reach the 
worst case is 22 or 23 in the sense of face turns.
On the other hand, on several webpages I read that such a number is 
not known. (Only lower and upper bounds are known.)
So, I am confused.
At least, I have confirmed that the Caley graph is applied to prove 
it if possible.

I would be glad if someone tells me the truth and introduces the 
related sites, papers and books.

Looking forward to good replies.

With best regards,
Takemi

          <div class="email-content">Hello everyone.<br>
As the thread title says, I am Mike.<br>
I live in Carbondale, IL and I&#x27;m in my 3rd year of college at John <br>
A. Logan<br>
<br>
As a kid, I owned a Rubik&#x27;s Cube and once it got shuffled, it never <br>
made it back to solid colors.  One day, maybe when I was 8 or 9, I <br>
peeled the stickers and &#x27;fixed&#x27; it...but the stickers didn&#x27;t stick <br>
very well after they got peeled and I realised I had ruined my <br>
cube.  Too bad too because a month or so later, I learned how to <br>
take it apart  lol.<br>
Anyway, this Christmas, I asked for a new Cube as I cannot find my <br>
old Cube or the Square One I acquired several years ago.<br>
I got a cube and have been plying with it since.<br>
At first, I thought I was in over my head as every time I got <br>
something done, I&#x27;d mess it up trying to get another block moved.<br>
I did a little reserach online and found some of the &#x27;secrets&#x27; and <br>
tips on how to do it right.  Finally got it fixed with a little help <br>
from the booklet that came with it, now I just have to memorize the <br>
moves for each key move.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d really like to get good at this and get faster at it.  I doubt <br>
I&#x27;d ever win any contests, but it would be nice to be able to show a <br>
speedy Solve to my friends.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!<br>
<br>
I have recently received a new 4x4x4 eastsheen cube. My old 4x4x4 was <br>
lent to a friend in 1985 and it broke. Ever since i haven&#x27;t had a <br>
functional 4x4x4 in my possession.<br>
<br>
After 2 days of playing w it i have achieved a best time of 2:10.7 <br>
and a best average of 2:34.5.<br>
<br>
Now i wonder if anyone can guide me towards a page w a clear <br>
description of the edge-alignment method of solving a 4x4x4 cube. And <br>
also i wonder which 4x4x4 is really best for speeding? I find that <br>
the eastsheen is very little forgiving for &quot;misalignment&quot; before <br>
allowing the next slice movement. And how can i improve my 4x4x4 <br>
eastsheen? Must i really take it apart and do polishing of all the <br>
minute parts?<br>

No, i will not allow free 3D-rotation, simply cause i dun like that <br>

          <div class="email-content">Beside lubrication there is little you can do, sure lubricating every 
piece will help. As for all new cubes, first payl with it a while 
before you libricate it.

The mechanisme is very precise, so it is must be aligned before you 
can turn it, the screws needs to be tights and there is very little 
you can do about them, but you should check if they have all the same 
tension.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody.  I&#x27;m sure many of us have tried the game where one <br>
person scrambles a cube 5 or 6 moves and another person tries to <br>
undo those 5 or 6 moves without knowing what they were.  Well me, <br>
Dave, and David were in the chat today and we came up with a way <br>
that kind of works for doing this over the internet.  Just put in a <br>
huge number of cube rotations between turns and you don&#x27;t know which <br>
faces you were turning originally.  Here is an example, try doing <br>
the scramble below without looking at your cube.<br>
<br>
R x y&#x27; z2 y x&#x27; z2 y R y2 x&#x27; y2 z&#x27; x y2 z&#x27; R y&#x27; x&#x27; z&#x27; y2 x2 y&#x27; z R z&#x27; <br>
y&#x27; z2 y2 x2 R<br>
<br>
At the end toss your cube between your hands allowing it to spin, or <br>
throw it up in the air or roll it around in your hands so you can&#x27;t <br>
remember the last face you turned.  Then try to solve it in 5 moves.<br>
<br>
We got to talking and perhaps we could turn this into some sort of <br>
contest.  Perhaps Dan could do this as an offshoot of the fewest <br>
moves contest, or if someone would be interested in hosting this <br>
contest we could do that.  Anyway me, Dave, and David tried it in <br>
the chat and liked the idea so we wanted to see what everyone else <br>
thought.  Of course there are ways to cheat, but there are for all <br>
contests.  Anyway what are everyone&#x27;s opinions?  I think this is a <br>
fun way of solving the cube and maybe it will at least become <br>
something we try in the chat room on the weekends.  Anyway try the <br>
scramble above and see what you think, then post your ideas, <br>
comments, etc.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I came up with a different way of doing the same contest:<br>
<br>
1. Use Jess&#x27;s timer to get a 25 move scramble, and put it in a file.<br>
2. Open the file with Cube Explorer.<br>
3. Have Cube Explorer find a close to optimal generator (20 turns).<br>
4. Added the last 19 moves from the first scramble in reverse.<br>
<br>
This gives you a random looking sequence of 44 turns that has a 6 <br>
turn solution.  Here&#x27;s an example:<br>
<br>
D2 L2 D&#x27; U2 B2 D&#x27; F2 R B&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; D U&#x27; B D B D2 F U R2 B2 F R&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey, I thought up a way to discourage cheating and make it more
random. If this is Going to turn into a real contest, there must be a
lot of people doing this, so the little extra time that this may take
seems worthwhile.

I&#x27;m sure most of you know of Cube Explorer.  There is a feature in
there that lets you set the target state for the cube.
Just go in and set the target after the 6 or 7 moves are done to the
cube. Set the initial state as a random cube.

Have it solve for that state.  Clean the target and get a generator
for that random cube.  Put the Generator and the solution to the
target state back to back and there you have it.

The only drawback I can see is the length of the scrambler (close to
40 moves). Just an idea.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, I know I&#x27;ve posted a lot lately but I had another idea <br>
that I was wondering if people would be interested in.  I e-mailed <br>
Dan Harris and he seems to like the idea as well.  I, for one, have <br>
only participated in the fewest moves challenge a couple of times.  <br>
I really enjoyed it when I did but I have to say I was a little <br>
intimidated by the INCREDIBLE solves we see on there every week.  My <br>
idea was to have a ranking system, for example Beginner, <br>
Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.  These levels could be marked <br>
off by a set number of moves that does not change.  For example <br>
Beginner could be a solution of 60 moves or longer, Intermediate <br>
could be 40-59 moves, Advanced could be 30-39 moves and 29 or less <br>
could be Expert.  I&#x27;m just throwing out the numbers I used here, but <br>
we could have something like this for the contest.  Then all the <br>
times would be posted on the list just as they are now, but instead <br>
of having just an overall winner there would be sections marked off <br>
on the list to show all the solutions that are intermediate level, <br>
all the ones that are advanced, expert, beginner, etc.  However <br>
there would still be only an overall winner for that week, at least <br>
how I was thinking about it.  Anyway I know that I personally would <br>
be more likely to compete if I knew I was striving for say an <br>
advanced solution that week, rather than to just compare myself to <br>
the absolutely amazing solvers that compete regularly.<br>
<br>
Would anyone else be interested in something like this?  Like I said <br>
I proposed the idea to Dan and he seemed to like it but I thought it <br>
would be good to see if there was interest from others too.  I think <br>
it would just add an extra element and make us not-so-good fewest <br>
move solvers able to compete and feel a little better about being <br>
creamed by the really good people :)<br>
<br>
Anyone have any ideas about this?  Changes, comments, etc.?<br>

how fast you pick up things.  I first became sub30
after a year of cubing.  Some people become sub20 much

break 30.

          <div class="email-content">i assume you are talking about those crappy paper stickers.what i <br>
used to do with my cubes with those stickers was apply a glue made by <br>
Loctite.now i think its Loctite 406,it also might be 401.for the life <br>
of me i cant remember.anyway its a clear glue that forms a hard <br>
finish.<br>
<br>
i would carefully apply that over the stickers 5/6 times over a 2 day <br>
period and end up with a hard clear shiny finish.this stuff dries <br>
real quick so you have to be carefull not to glue your finger to the <br>
cube.<br>
<br>
also its best to pull the cube apart to do this,and use those cotton <br>
buds to apply the glue.you can do more than 6 layers if need <br>
be...thats just a rough guide.<br>
<br>
good luck<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have heard of people cutting squares of electrical tape.  It comes 
in several different colors.  I think colored duct tape is also 
available, but not sure about that one.
If you like the stickers you have though, the Locktite idea sounds 
good or you could spray a clearcoat over the stickers.  I would 
spray a many coats to build up a defensive layer for the stickers.  
But if you spray the pieces, I would probably mask off the parts 
that touch other sides.  You dont want to build up paint on the 
moving surfaces.

          <div class="email-content">One quick thing that the site doesnt mention is that a letter with a 2
suffix means do that turn twice.  For instance, F2 means turn the front
face twice, and z2 means to rotate the entire cube, with the front face
facing you, twice in either direction.

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Ron van Bruchem&quot; &lt;rvb@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> &lt;speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Sun, 11 Jan 2004 11:02:55 +0100<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
Welcome to the club of blindfold solvers, Masayuki!<br>
It is such a great experience to open your eyes and see that your cube is<br>
solved.<br>
And actually it is not very difficult.<br>
<br>
For those of you who are thinking about trying to solve it blindfolded, here is<br>
how I started this.<br>
<br>
First I read Olly&#x27;s page and Richard&#x27;s page about blindfold solving. Both<br>
systems are quite similar.<br>
I chose Olly&#x27;s system because his system made it easier for me personally to<br>
memorize the actual steps I need to do to solve the cube.<br>
<br>
After reading the pages I went looking for some useful algorithms. Here are the<br>
algorithms that I use.<br>
1) orienting corners: only the basic R&#x27;DRFDF&#x27; Ux FD&#x27;F&#x27;R&#x27;D&#x27;R Ux&#x27;<br>
2) orienting edges: ERERERER (in any direction), ERERER2E&#x27;RE&#x27;RE&#x27;R2 (in any<br>
direction), ERERERER&#x27;ERERERER&#x27; (in any direction). I do not use a commutator of<br>
a monoflip algorithm because then I always tend to forget the rotations I did.<br>
3) permuting corners: the basic corner 3 cycle R&#x27;FR&#x27;B2RF&#x27;R&#x27;B2R2 (and inverse),<br>
UL2UR2U&#x27;L2UR2U2 (and mirrored L/R)<br>
4) permuting edges: RU&#x27;RURURU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R2 (and inverse, mirrored F/B, inverted<br>
mirrored F/B), MD2M&#x27;D2 (in any direction), M&#x27;UMU2M&#x27;UM (in any direction). I use<br>
the latter algorithm when I can do an easy F move (which flips edges) to set up<br>
a 3 cycle of edges. It is very useful!<br>
5) for the odd parity of corners, I leave the swapped pair like it is until the<br>
end. At the end of the solve I use a PLL algorithm to swap the corner and the<br>
edge pair.<br>
I am also learning some extra algorithms that make harder cases easier to solve<br>
(fewer setup moves).<br>
<br>
Then I started writing everything down and tried to solve the cube step by step<br>
1/2/3/4/5. The hard part was finding the moves you need to do for setting up the<br>
algorithms, and undoing them after the algorithms. After two weeks of practice I<br>
could do each step with a good success rate.<br>
Then I started writing everything down and then memorizing a step (step by<br>
step). This is actually very easy.<br>
Then I started writing everything down and memorizing all steps. This was<br>
harder. After solving a step I often forgot the positions for the next step.<br>
Then I started memorizing without writing everything down first. This was the<br>
hardest for me!!! This is what still gives me a low success rate for blindfold<br>
solving.<br>
<br>
Anyway it took me a few weeks to master blindfold solving. I now have an almost<br>
100% success rate for 2x2x2 and about 40% for 3x3x3.<br>
I will try to get my times down. Memorizing can be done much faster. And with<br>
some more algorithms I can also improve my solving.<br>
<br>
You really should try blindfold solving. It is great! Almost anyone can do it.<br>
<br>
So indeed taking notes makes it much easier. Still I think it is a very good<br>
step towards memorizing without taking notes.<br>
I am not going to argue whether writing down before memorizing makes it<br>
semiblindfold solving. I think both are real blindfold solving.<br>
If you would do blindfold solving in front of people, then I am sure they would<br>
think it is rather strange to take notes first.<br>
But they would be absolutely amazed of it, with or without taking notes!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>

I looked at your site. Your explanation is not hard to follow at 
all.  This may come as an absiolute shock to you, but even the cube 
artists have to know some math.
 hope you guys got this notstion standardized. If you define your 
xyz coordinates diffetrently, what is x to one cubist may appear az  
z to another.

well again, my post isn&#x27;t directly rubik&#x27;s cube related...although <br>
it is cube-puzzle related...hopefully no one minds too much<br>
<br>
does anyone remember a cube shaped maze, made of clear plastic?<br>
you had to negotiate a matble through it (most of the time not being <br>
able to see the marble).<br>
<br>
i think there&#x27;s a similar one pictured on a trade-page, but it&#x27;s not <br>
quite the same. i don&#x27;t remember any &quot;seams&quot; around the one i had.<br>
<br>
if anyone knows who made it, or knows even of an online picture of <br>
it...any help to find one would be great.<br>
<br>
thanks everyone<br>

While re-reading the cube-lovers mailing list<br>

As you can probably see now, Blindfold isn&#x27;t real hard.<br>
The first time I did it, it took me an hour for the whole proccess.<br>
Afterwards, I improoved my memorizing system from a mental picture <br>
association memory to a direct premutation and orientation memory <br>
and my time went down from 50 min to 8 min in one go!<br>
The following day I sat down and planned an easyer algs using the <br>
cube explorer, and after a few weeks I could do it in less than 5 <br>
min.<br>
The rest was just practicing.<br>
For the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 the system is pretty much the same and I am <br>
curretly thinking about making a web page with my advance system for <br>
blindfold.<br>
Wish me luck...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,
 
I bought some of the really cheap rubik&#x27;s cubes with the colored plastic on them instead of stickers. I then spent several hours peeling off, sanding down, and re-sticking the plastic &quot;stickers&quot; onto my good cube. It works really well now, and I only have to worry about the occational loose &quot;sticker&quot;. Also, sometimes they chip, but if the piece is big enough, I&#x27;ll just glue them back on.

I have worn the stickers off of 1.3 cubes so far, and I am curious, how

wearing off quickly like my current stickers.  Does anybody have any
advice?

          <div class="email-content">i have a question for those that use the standard F2L method to <br>
locate CE pairs and solve them.  suppose you just finished solving <br>
the first CE pair and while solving the first pair, you locate a <br>
second pair.  <br>
<br>
now suppose this next pair has the corner already in the cross layer <br>
(but not in the correct slot), and suppose the edge piece is also <br>
already in the middle layer (but not in the correct slot).  so <br>
neither the corner nor the edge is in the top layer, and neither the <br>
corner nor the edge is in it&#x27;s correct slot.<br>
<br>
most lists of F2L algs do not seem to provide specific algs for this <br>
situation.<br>
<br>
do you:<br>
1.  find a different CE pair and solve it instead<br>
2.  use 3 moves to kick the edge up to the LL and solve as a normal <br>
CE pair<br>
3.  use 3 moves to kick the corner up to the LL and solve as a <br>
normal CE pair<br>
4.  solve the CE pair directly with a special alg for that <br>
particular situation.<br>
<br>
do you find that when this situation comes up it slows you down <br>
significantly?  i generall do #2 and find that it tends to throw my <br>
F2L out of rhythm.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I successfully took all 8 corners off my EastSheen cube, thanks to <br>
that wonderful picture.  I&#x27;d always wanted to get in, and see the <br>
guts of that thing.  It was also a good opportunity to clean out some <br>
of the lint that it collects while travelling in my pockets.<br>
<br>
To those who also want to take apart their EastSheen 2x2x2 cubes, <br>
just be warned...  I found that it was a bit difficult to push the <br>
clip as well, and one of mine ended up cracking a little bit on the <br>
way out (but only one).  I think now that I&#x27;ve done it once, and I&#x27;m <br>
familiar with the procedure, I&#x27;d be able to do it in the future <br>
without a problem.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m a little curious if there&#x27;s any good way to take apart the <br>
kernel, as well...  Looks like 3 of the centers just clip in, but I <br>
don&#x27;t see any good way to free them.  Perhaps my curiousity will kill <br>
my puzzle - I don&#x27;t know.<br>

<br>
Okay, I&#x27;ll bite...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d never really thought about it, but the preinspection is really <br>
just part of the time necessary in solving the cube.  We tend to <br>
merely time how fast we can implement the solution, but not how long <br>
it takes us to actually solve the puzzle - we don&#x27;t include the <br>
planning time, in which we are actually mentally solving; formulating <br>
the first part of the solution prior to implementation.  I think it <br>
would be interesting/informative to take times/averages with no <br>
preinspection.  While the times wouldn&#x27;t be as impressive (expecting <br>
they&#x27;d be higher), and they can&#x27;t be compared directly to existing <br>
records, it is a more realistic view of how long it is actually <br>
taking to solve the puzzle.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I would actually recommend nail polish.  A couple of my favorite <br>
brands are Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild (found in Target, Walmart, Cub, Dominick&#x27;s, <br>
etc. - all over the place) and Capri (found at Walgreens).  If I had <br>
found Capri first, I probably would have all of my colors in that <br>
brand.  It applies very thinly, so many coats are needed, but it <br>
dries very quickly and seems to dry into a fairly hard layer.  <br>
Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild takes a long time for each coat to dry.  I repainted my <br>
main 3x3 cube several months ago (just before WC&#x27;03 in August), and <br>
it still looks about as good as new.<br>
<br>
Anyways, as far as color, I know Capri&#x27;s &quot;evening sky&quot; is a great <br>
orange, and based on the colors available, you could probably find <br>
all 6 colors (go to http://www.walgreens.com and search for Capri) <br>
for your cube, or even 12 for your megaminx :-P  After I get the <br>
color I want (through adequate coats), I apply 1-2 coats of a clear <br>
nail protector (I again use Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild).  To give it a nice, final <br>
protective layer, I use one coat of hard as nails (applied thickly).  <br>
Once it&#x27;s had a chance to dry, I then put it into the oven at low <br>
temperature (about 150 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20-30 minutes.  After <br>
letting it cool, I will sometimes put it back in for another 20-30 <br>
minutes if it doesn&#x27;t seem to be fully set yet.  It is a little time <br>
consuming, but I&#x27;ve been using this cube for a couple years now, and <br>
figure it will last me for years and never need to be repainted or <br>
restickered again.<br>
<br>
Electrical tape works, but I don&#x27;t think it looks quite as nice.  <br>
Also (same for duct tape), make sure you can find all the colors <br>
before you start applying.  Either way, stickers are stickers, and <br>
will, eventually, peel up (even if they don&#x27;t lose their color).  A <br>
protective layer on top of stickers may be all you need to keep them <br>
looking good for the life of the cube - I don&#x27;t know.  Whatever you <br>
decide - good luck!<br>

Interesting solution idea... Here&#x27;s my thoughts:<br>
<br>
Given that people do it already for the Petrus method, steps 1-2 are <br>
obviously solid.  It seems to me that step 3 is pretty trivial, but <br>
step 4 is not really intuitive.  I would have to agree with Ton that <br>
this should be combined, either with step 5 or perhaps even with step <br>
3.<br>
<br>
If you are looking to do step 5 in one algorithm, then I think (if I <br>
figured it right) you&#x27;re looking at using one of 480 possible algs <br>
(counting all inverses/mirrors as separate cases).  Depending on the <br>
lengths of these algs and their ease of recognition, though, maybe <br>
this is what you are looking for.  It sounds like too ambitious of an <br>
approach for me, though.<br>

&gt; Step 1 you should &quot;see&quot; during pre-inspection <br>

&gt; From step 4 I think this can not be intuitive, that would not be <br>

          <div class="email-content">When locating CE pairs, I look in the LL for either an edge or a <br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s very similar to another idea I had, only differing in the

when you use &quot;random scrambling algorithms&quot;. I&#x27;ll post another

pick a cube state with distance 6, then use that one. Not to choose 
a scrambling algorithm.

Btw, since I think this type of solving depends a little bit on luck 
there should maybe be several tasks, not just one. And maybe also 
for different distances, say from 3 to 10.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Rolling averages vs planned start:  In most competitions you can <br>
warm <br>
&gt; up all you want but you have to decide ahead of time that you&#x27;re <br>
&gt; doing the official time trial, or long jump, or high jump, or <br>
&gt; whatever, if you want it to count.  You can&#x27;t decide after a <br>
&gt; performance whether it was warmup or actual competition.  The only <br>
&gt; case I could make for doing this would be that it would <br>
(obviously) <br>
&gt; yield slightly faster times, but I think the goal of what you&#x27;re <br>
&gt; trying to do here isn&#x27;t to improve the speed of the scores that <br>
&gt; speedcubers submit, but rather to improve the credibility and <br>
&gt; integrity of those scores.<br>
<br>
Actually I think allowing averages would be *better* for credibility <br>
and integrity. Why?<br>
<br>
Because I don&#x27;t think everybody will always fully fulfill the rules <br>
100%. Restarting with a new average attempt before the end of one <br>
because it started bad is not exactly ok for you I guess, but I <br>
think this should be allowed because continuing when you know it <br>
will end bad will only demotivate you. Not good. Also, consider <br>
DanK&#x27;s quote I already mentioned. Or imagine you don&#x27;t actually <br>
intend to start an average but just cube a bit and get a few very <br>
fast times. With strict rules you should not be allowed to use those <br>
past times to start an average. But that sucks.<br>
<br>
So because I don&#x27;t think everybody would always use the strict rules <br>
and because I even think it&#x27;s bad if you do so (because it hurts <br>
your motivation) I&#x27;d say people will submit average records that <br>
they achieved differently. Some with the strict non-rolling average <br>
rules, some without.<br>
<br>
So in order to give everybody the same treatment I&#x27;d vote in favour <br>
of rolling averages.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d vote against pops, btw. Same reason: treat everybody the same <br>
way, as explained by others.<br>

<br>
That brings an interesting question to mind - if you use rolling <br>
averages and allow 1 pop per average, what do you do if you get a <br>
second pop?  Do you have to start a new average, or can you just <br>
start the average with the first solve following the first pop?  For <br>
example, let&#x27;s say I do 5 clean solves, and then pop.  Then I do <br>
another 5 clean solves and pop again.  Am I 5 solves (plus a pop) <br>
into my average, or am I 0 solves (with no pops) into my average?<br>
<br>
It would seem that if rolling averages is what you want, then you <br>
wouldn&#x27;t reset to 0, but instead would just go from the first solve <br>
after the first pop.  How do you guys do it?  I currently don&#x27;t use <br>
rolling averages, so I don&#x27;t know.<br>

Chris,

   I think this is an excellent idea. I tried a few ideas for
implementing this, but I don&#x27;t know whether these ideas are useful or not.

   One idea is to use two cubes. Put the 6 or 7 moves on a cube, put
it aside, and put the next 6 or 7 moves on another cube; then go back
and solve the first, then put the next 6 or seven moves on it, and
solve the second cube, and so forth. Perhaps this will work better
with three cubes.
   Putting the moves on the cube and putting the cube aside without
looking at it helps.

   I like your idea of sicking in cube rotations. You could also do an
R turn as R&#x27; L2 r R2 L&#x27; r&#x27; L&#x27; (my notation).

          <div class="email-content">When going for rolling averages I really only compute the average(s) <br>
*after* having solved the cube lots of times in a row. Then pick any <br>
12 consecutive non-popped times or 13 that contain a single pop. You <br>
can also use many more pops in there if you use their time (so fix <br>
the pops and record the times anyway together with a mark that <br>
reminds you of the pop).<br>
<br>
I hope from this explanation you see that in your example you have <br>
many choices...<br>
<br>
Stefan<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; That brings an interesting question to mind - if you use rolling <br>
&gt; averages and allow 1 pop per average, what do you do if you get a <br>
&gt; second pop?  Do you have to start a new average, or can you just <br>
&gt; start the average with the first solve following the first pop?  <br>
For <br>
&gt; example, let&#x27;s say I do 5 clean solves, and then pop.  Then I do <br>
&gt; another 5 clean solves and pop again.  Am I 5 solves (plus a pop) <br>
&gt; into my average, or am I 0 solves (with no pops) into my average?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It would seem that if rolling averages is what you want, then you <br>
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t reset to 0, but instead would just go from the first <br>
solve <br>
&gt; after the first pop.  How do you guys do it?  I currently don&#x27;t <br>
use <br>
&gt; rolling averages, so I don&#x27;t know.<br>

Yes, I do wish you all the luck in the world so you can make that 
web page. I&#x27;d love to learn from it. I&#x27;m also improving my own 
system right now and hope to be sub-10 soon (had a 10:01 today and 
was actually happy having missed one 3-cycle because otherwise I&#x27;d 
have been very annoyed by the time ;-).

Btw, I&#x27;ve watched you on German TV when you solved the 15 Puzzle. 
Any hint on how you do that? On the cube I do almost any permutation 
in 3-cycles which can be applied to any three pieces easily. But on 
the 15 Puzzle it&#x27;s not that easy to bring the pieces into position 
for the cycle algorithm. My best idea so far is to bring three 
pieces I want to cycle into the middle, then cycle them, then bring 
them back to where they came from.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!!

Speaking of rolling averages...

Anyone has a program that searches large amounts of consecutive times 
and finds a best rolling average? If not, i will be willing to make 
one, but it will be a windows executable in that case, and not the 
ever popular java/applets...

regular meetings would be cool too if we could plan them.  If I 
remember correctly we had a couple of South Carolina people here as 
well, so maybe we could make this a Carolina get-together if everyone 
is interested.  How soon of a timeframe are you thinking of?  I could 
drive anywhere in the State, and the best times for me are the 
weekends including Fridays just to throw something out.  We could do 
a mall get together or something and practice some public cubing as 
well :)

If you&#x27;re thinking about soon I&#x27;m definitely in, we just need to find 
a good time and a central location.  Even if we don&#x27;t have it for a 
while I&#x27;d drive to meet you guys.

I don&#x27;t have any big plans for the weekends anytime soon, so anytime 
in the next couple months is good with me.  What works for you guys?  
Also Jim if you&#x27;re checking the group messages what works for you?  
I&#x27;ll also send a message to Jim to make sure he hears about it.

I&#x27;m interested and willing to travel, so whatever timeframe and place 
works for you I&#x27;ll be there.

   Thanks for your thoughtful response. Believe it or not I wasn&#x27;t
trolling. I&#x27;m just really surprised that this hasn&#x27;t been discussed
extensively.

   That&#x27;s it exactly. There&#x27;s a whole area of the solve that has not
been getting discussed.

   I&#x27;m pretty sure that everyone differs in their approaches to the
pre-inspection time, so I would think that this would be an area for
improvement. And a chance for improvement usually gets people excited.

   Even if people don&#x27;t want to count observing, thinking, planning as
part of the solution, generally speaking they might still improve
their times if they developed better skills in the preinspection.

   Today I did a 31.27 with no pre-inspection.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Doug!

I was planning to code it in Delphi (if time allows :D). Yes i 
suppose it can be written in a simple web scripting language like PHP 
also, but not all cubers have access to web most of the time. Then 
again it could be possible to d/l it and run it offline in a 
webbrowser anyway. There are some intricacies however regarding 
maximum allowed number of pops in a (rolling) average. Personally i 
know ASP and it&#x27;s not well suited for what i was planning to make. I 
dun have experience in PHP...

moves but I think it is still bad because it doesn&#x27;t result in a<br>
uniform distribution among the set of cube *states*. With 19 moves we<br>
know there are states that have zero probability to be reached whereas<br>
states close to the solved state can be reached many different ways.<br>
With 20 moves some are barely reached and there might still be some<br>
that aren&#x27;t reached. The situation gets better with more moves but I<br>
don&#x27;t think 25 is enough to give a good uniform distribution. And<br>
since I always forget the numbers I&#x27;m not even sure every state can be<br>
reached with 25 moves at all.<br>

I&#x27;ve done some experiments with the 2x2 space last night... I don&#x27;t<br>

That said, does anyone know which Kociemba&#x27;s Cube Explorer generates<br>

never used that word).<br>

What I meant is the big part that connects the corner hull with the<br>
cube kernel. Pushing the clip is easy once you know it, but you still<br>
need some force to pull the hull and the connector apart from each<br>
other.<br>
<br>
Well, I did succeed in the meantime, but I hurt myself a bit. So<br>
here&#x27;s an improvement idea: First turn a layer a bit so that you can<br>
look inside and see the clip. Then stick something in there that<br>
pushes the clip open. Small enough so that you can restore the cube<br>
shape and turn a different layer. The one that gives you access to the<br>
other side of the connector, so that you can bring a screwdriver<br>
between the hull and the connector and actually push the connector<br>
away from the hull (which I believe should be easier than to pull the<br>
hull away from the whole cube, having no grip over the connector).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve lubed the kernel by spraying inside, but I&#x27;d also like to take<br>
the kernel apart. I guess I&#x27;ll have to look for a good tool to press<br>
the two clips of one of the axes together to remove it, right?<br>

Surely it is overkill to call this pre-inspection!  As far as I&#x27;m concerned the pre-inspection would that short time of calming yourself (maybe!) just before the inspection!  Its an inspection or a pre-solve inspection.  Still we use lots more bizarre terms in speedcubing so don&#x27;t mind me.<br>

<br>
I wouldn&#x27;t select a number of moves at random, at least not for the<br>

<br>
I believe 25 half-turn-metric moves gets you very very close to a<br>
uniform distribution; for any reasonable (non-statistical) purpose,<br>
I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s fine.  Of course if you&#x27;re doing quarter-turn-metric<br>
moves, this should be higher (32?) and here you&#x27;ve got parity issues<br>
to worry about, so in this case perhaps you should randomly select<br>
between 32 and 33.  But I doubt this is an issue since you almost<br>
certainly do half-turn-metric moves.<br>
<br>
Of course, the &quot;correct&quot; way to do it is to generate a big random<br>
number and map that directly into cube space; then, if you need a<br>
sequence, &quot;solve&quot; the resulting cube.<br>
<br>
And if the random moves come from a human, well, 25 isn&#x27;t going to<br>
give you very close to a random cube since humans are notoriously poor<br>
at generating random numbers.<br>

If you do it intelligently, 25 random moves should be adequate to <br>
thoroughly scramble a cube (assuming face turn metric, not quarter <br>
turn), but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting much, if any, lower than <br>
that.  If you want to use a range, start with 25 as the low end and <br>
do 25-35, or something like that.<br>

Yes, inspection time must be used effectively, especially if you begin
with more than 4 pieces. I noticed a 3 second gap.

There&#x27;s something more, that usually does not appear in rules about
cube inspection. I know that some people already know the centers
position before starting (randomly scrambled faces, but centers don&#x27;t
move).

This is *very* important (possibly 1 sec).

&gt;I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s fine.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d intuitively say that too. But it would be nicer to know than to guess.<br>
<br>
One easy way to measure this would be to do ten random sequences each <br>
of 17 to 30 moves. That&#x27;s ten 17 movers, ten 18 movers etc. Do more <br>
than ten for more precise results, of course.<br>
<br>
Then you feed them all into Cube Explorer or some other perfect <br>
solver, and note the average length of the perfect solutions as a <br>
function of the number of mix moves.<br>
<br>
The number of mix moves where the average reaches it&#x27;s final and <br>
highest level should be the number needed for a true random mix. <br>
Probably not in the sense that every single position is equally <br>
likely - that may be a very high number, if it&#x27;s even possible - but <br>
for the purposes of speed cubing.<br>
<br>
Unless I&#x27;ve overlooked something...?<br>

          <div class="email-content">The idea seems to be to get to the final layer with a 2x2x1 part 
already solved, so there are only 107 possible algs for it and you 
can learn them all perfectly. I like that, as something worth 
exploring at least.

Having done Steps 1 &amp; a zillion times in over 20 years, it has never 
once occurred to me to turn it on it&#x27;s side like that, but I don&#x27;t 
see any reason it couldn&#x27;t be a good speed method.

Like Ton says, Step 4 and 5 seem like they could be better done 
together. There should be a large subset of the Fridrich algs that 
don&#x27;t disturb the 2x2x1 blob. And I don&#x27;t see why Step 3 couldn&#x27;t be 
done at the same time too. Or put an other way, there&#x27;s probably a 
better way to get from Step 2 to 6. Not that I can name one, but I 
would play around with it a while to see what comes naturally.

   Good points.

   I don&#x27;t think it can be &quot;pre-solve inspection&quot; because it&#x27;s part of
the solve. Nor do I think just plain old &quot;inspection&quot; will do because
the inspection continues after the hands start moving (excluding
blindfold solving, fo course).

   How about &quot;initial inspection?&quot;

Actually, I have to contradict myself.  Everything depends on what you
mean by random.

If by random, your program is just doing

   move = random(18) ;

and doing 25 of *these* moves, you&#x27;re pretty far off random.

I wrote a trivial Perl script that takes a set of 25 moves generated
in the above fashion, and &quot;reduces&quot; it in the obvious fashion. 
Consecutive moves to the same face are combined; moves to opposite
faces are ordered; null moves are eliminated.  For instance:

   U+ F+ D+ U+ D- D2 U- R+

gets organized as

   (U+) (F+) (D+ U+ D- D2 U-) (R+)

and then

   (U+) (F+) (U+ U- D+ D- D2) (R+)

and then

   (U+) (F+) (D2) (R+)

and the &quot;effective&quot; length of the sequence is computed after applying
these transformations.  (This is not the true minimal sequence, just
the sequence generated after eliminating obviously redundant moves.)

After 100,000 such sequences were generated, I get the following
distribution of effective lengths:

6 1
7 2
8 7
9 25
10 90
11 241
12 558
13 1167
14 2383
15 4442
16 7229
17 10203
18 13523
19 15346
20 15070
21 12796
22 9038
23 5240
24 2085
25 554

So the median &quot;effective&quot; length is only 19, and there is a very good
probability that the effective length is 16 or less, much greater than
the relative probability of a solution in that many moves.

What this means is if you&#x27;re going to use the simple int random
technique described above, perhaps 50 would be a better number of
moves to use!

On the other hand, if you are careful how you generate a &quot;random&quot; move
so it does at most two consecutive moves in the same axis, and these
moves are to different faces, then you&#x27;re probably okay.

explain it: I mean a sequence of moves that makes the cube run 
through all possible states when you apply it again and again (i.e. 
when you reached the end start again at the beginning).

I noticed that quite short sequences can generate lots of states, 
for example I think &quot;U R&quot; or &quot;U R&#x27;&quot; (don&#x27;t remember which one) runs 
the cube through 272 states.

Also, Tom once asked for the shortest computer program that solves 
the cube (I have an idea now, it should fit very well in 100 lines 
of code, but that&#x27;s a different topic). If the sequence would be 
short then the program could just print the solution &quot;I don&#x27;t care 
how your cube looks now but please apply the following moves again 
and again until it is solved: &lt;the sequence>&quot;. It might also not 
take too much code and runtime to compute the exact number of moves 
necessary.

However, I once thought a bit about the 2x2 and for some reasons I 
don&#x27;t remember I estimated a lower bound of 40000 for the length of 
a generating sequence. For the 3x3 I&#x27;d of course expect it to be 
even bigger.

Do you guys know more about this?

The maximum order a sequence can have is 1260.  Thus, the maximum
number of states a sequence of length n can go through, when repeated,

have is (4e19) / (1260 * n) or around 3e16.

A program to output this sequence would probably be pretty long.

          <div class="email-content">When I ordered from Mefferts around Christams I got an error page 
and no confirmation from them, but my ordered came in just fine.  I 
think I started the whole scare that something might be up with 
Mefferts, but I&#x27;d like to clear up that my order came in fine so 
Mefferts seems to be doing fairly well.

Doug, I did have to wait a while though before anyone responded to 
my e-mails, I sent several out myself.  Perhaps they are just busy 
lately due to the holidays, I&#x27;m really not sure.  Anyway Uwe Meffert 
eventually e-mailed me back to clear up my situation, so I&#x27;m 
assuming just keep trying to send e-mails and they should respond, 
perhaps they are just bogged down.  I&#x27;m probably one of the people 
you read about that my order got weird, but mine turned out alright.

I&#x27;m assuming they are just backed up, so keep trying to get in touch 
with them and it should hopefully work out.

Let us know how it goes,

Sure, sorry.  Let&#x27;s say we have a cube program that does a
random scramble with

   for (int i=0; i&lt;25; i++) move((int)(drand48()*18)) ;

(for instance).  The problem with this approach is frequently
the program will generate the moves

   U+ U+

in sequence, for instance, which is equivalent to U2.  Or,

   U+ U-

which is equivalent to no move.  Or, and not as rarely as we
might like,

   U+ F+ F- U-

which again is equivalent to no moves.

Other bad situations are:

   U+ D+ U+

which is equivalent to

   U2 D+

and

   U+ R2 L2 U2 D2

which is equivalent to

   U- D2 R2 L2

I wanted to analyze how frequently this occurred, and thus, if
25 moves was actually sufficient to scramble the cube.

So I generated 100,000 &quot;random&quot; sequences of length 25, according
to the above one line program.  For each of these sequences, I
then made the move reductions enumerated above.  Every time I saw
two consecutive moves to the same face, I combined them.  And so
on and so on for the other reductions.  This gave me a resulting
sequence, almost always shorter than the previous sequence.

The table below essentially summarizes how frequent each resulting
length was:

What this means is out of the 100,000 trials, 9 of them gave
simplified sequences of 6 moves long (which means that those positions
could be solved in 6 or *fewer* actual moves, since even these
simplified sequences are not necessarily optimal).  Only 571, or about
one half of one percent, ended up being the full 25 moves long; that
is, we could almost always perform at least one simplifying
substitution.  Further, summing the columns from 1..16, we get 20,685,
which means there is probably more than 20% chance that our effective
length is less than or equal to 16.  Yet, a very very small fraction
of the cubes have a solution in 16 moves or less (I estimate only 2.7%
of the cube positions have such a short solution.)

So in summary, 25 moves, if they are generated uniformally over the 18
move space with no consideration for what the prior moves were, will
give you a very inaccurate sample of the cube space.

          <div class="email-content">OK, so the word &quot;random&quot; clearly needs to be precisely defined when 
talking about this.

What I envision with the word avoids stuff I would instantly 
recognize as silly when doing it by hand:

1. First move is any of the 18.
2. All other moves are any of the 15 on a different side than the preceding...
3. ..., except if the last two moves have been on opposing sides, in 
which case it must be one of the 12 on the 4 other sides.

Any further optimizations seems too smart to me personally. But as 
long as we know what we&#x27;re talking about, it&#x27;s not too important 
which definition we use.


Either I don&#x27;t understand the numbers, or there is something wrong 
with the second batch. If you apply a more aggressive pruning, surely 
you should find fewer unreducible 25 sequences, not more?

And to me U R2 L2 U2 F2 gives a different result than U&#x27; F2 R2 L2.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; OK, so the word &quot;random&quot; clearly needs to be precisely defined when <br>
&gt; talking about this.<br>
<br>
Yes, very important.  How was random defined at the world<br>
championships, for instance?  They say random moves generated by a<br>
computer . . .<br>
<br>
&gt; What I envision with the word avoids stuff I would instantly <br>
&gt; recognize as silly when doing it by hand:<br>
<br>
&gt; 1. First move is any of the 18.<br>
&gt; 2. All other moves are any of the 15 on a different side than the<br>
preceding...<br>
&gt; 3. ..., except if the last two moves have been on opposing sides,<br>
in <br>
&gt; which case it must be one of the 12 on the 4 other sides.<br>
<br>
Yes, me too . . . but not necessarily to everyone else, who might then<br>
think they can use the random(18) on each move.<br>
<br>
&gt; Any further optimizations seems too smart to me personally.<br>
<br>
Me too.<br>
<br>
&gt; Either I don&#x27;t understand the numbers, or there is something wrong <br>
&gt; with the second batch. If you apply a more aggressive pruning,<br>
surely <br>
&gt; you should find fewer unreducible 25 sequences, not more?<br>
<br>
Just a different random sample, that&#x27;s all.<br>
<br>
&gt; And to me U R2 L2 U2 F2 gives a different result than U&#x27; F2 R2 L2.<br>
<br>
This is a typo; I meant U R2 L2 U2 D2 and U&#x27; D2 R2 L2.<br>
<br>
My program doesn&#x27;t have the typo because I didn&#x27;t name the faces, just<br>
used an implicit ordering.<br>

Depends on what &quot;optimal&quot; means.  If you mean the fewest number of
random moves (where random means each move picking one of the 18,
without regard for what went before), then 25 clearly doesn&#x27;t give you
a representative cube, so 19 cannot either.  If you use such a simple
technique, my recommendation would be to use 50 moves!  I can probably
reduce that somewhat using the technique Lars described, and for
certain bounds on the accuracy, but all in all I&#x27;d recommend simply
using Lars&#x27; definition for what constitutes a random move, and using
25 moves.

But perhaps someone with a lot of computer time will perform Lars&#x27;
experiment and prove that 25 is insufficient in any case.

Go to the methods section and scroll down to the Working Corner/Edge F2L <br>
method. The F2L is pretty fast and the only real sequences you need to <br>
memorize is the PLL (21 cases).<br>
You don&#x27;t need to learn more than 35 sequences to get times in the mid-30&#x27;s <br>
which is pretty fast considering how few sequences you need to learn.<br>

They are not *quite* random; essentially, the algorithm is:

   for (int i=0; i&lt;27; i++) move_random() ; // start somewhere
   while (1) {
      find_optimal_solution() ;
      move_random() ;
   }

so it&#x27;s a sequence of cubes all adjacent to each other.

Those numbers are from about a CPU year, I guess.  The 100K other ones
would probably take another two years.

But I&#x27;ve got a much faster optimal solver in the works.

hey kyle.

ill mention a few things that really helped me in memorizing the 
algorithms that i have finished.  note that i still have a few OLL 
algorithms left plus most of the PLL.  however, i wish someone would 
have told me this stuff when i started, and i think it would have 
helped me take less time than i have taken.

some of these points might apply to what i did, which is the fridrich 
method, but you can take them how you wish.

1) one thing i did for a while was open each of the steps (F2L, OLL, 
PLL) in seperate browser windows.  then i would scramble a cube and 
do the cross. then i found the first F2L move on the algorithm list 
and highlighted it with my mouse.  then i did the move very slowly 
and watched the pieces move. then i did that with the rest of the 
solution, watching what everything did.  this really helped me 
realize something very important about the F2L (which Jessica 
Fridrich mentions on her site) in that most of the algorithms boil 
down to 2 situations which involve 3 or 4 moves each.  the positions 
are b02 and b04 on www.speedcubing.com.  this revelation was amazing 
to my F2L, and converted the memorizing of algorithms into the 
virtual creation of my own (most of which match up to the ones found 
online), but they are easier to perform when you know whats going on.

2) pick an algorithm and do it over and over and over again until you 
are pretty much sick of it.  this sounds tedious, but you will 
streamline it this way, if only for the fact that you are sick of 
doing it and want to get the pain over with quicker.  also, as doug 
mentioned, it will add it to your muscle memory.

3) break the algorithm up into finger tricks.  utilizing dan knights 
(http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/CubeInfo.html) finger trick 
videos really help for this part.  nathan christie 
(http://my.fit.edu/~dchristi/cube/) has an awesome word document that 
you can get which has the F2L broken up into these shorter 3-4 move 
algorithms, and memorizing 2-3 &quot;sub-algorithms&quot; is a lot less 
intimidating than an 8-move algorithm.

4) along the lines of 3, use the various videos on the net.  i know 
jess bonde (http://www.rubiks.dk) has excellent videos for each move, 
and others do as well.  i used to take these videos and watch them in 
either slow-motion or stop motion, with the algorithm in front of me, 
copying the movements.  these videos give you great insight into 
moving the cube as well, so as not to always keep the F face in front 
in order to shave time off (at least for the LL).

5) either print out the algorithms, or re-write them and take them 
with you.  i have 2 sheets of paper with all the PLL algorithms that 
i am learning, and they are all bent and ripped since i take them 
everywhere.  anytime you have a spare minute you can whip the sheets 
out and practice a move.

6) pick the right algorithms for you.  this always sounded stupid to 
me, but it really is true.  i sat down one day and had about 6 
browser windows open with different cube pages open, all with 
differing algorithms.  i worked each different one out and found the 
one that i liked.  for instance, i prefer not to use the L side and D 
sides as much as i can, so i picked a lot of moves that relied 
heavily on the U and R faces.  if you just blindly start learning 
moves, you are going to eventually have to erase that move from your 
memory and learn a new move, which is not only hard in the memorizing 
aspect, but slows you down while solving since you have to think 
about the move you are doing, not the old move.

well this turned out to be lengthier than i planned, but i hope it 
helps some.

Yeah, I&#x27;m pretty sure.  The distribution doesn&#x27;t go *that* bad.  And
once you eliminate the things I eliminate, you&#x27;re going pretty deep in
the tree (the things I eliminate are  the things behind the obvious
generating sequence used to approximate the populations of the levels
that turns out to be very very accurate for the levels so far---plus
one more reduction that might account for much of the rest.  As a
matter of fact, I should try to generate a new sequence that takes
that into account and see if that increases the accuracy . . .)

Hmm, what I would do if the screws wotn stop turning is screw it

Scratch up the screw head so the glue has a better grip on it.  You 
should still be able to break the glue by turning the screw with a

          <div class="email-content">Dear friends

Altough it is a know problem for a screw type cube- the screw come 
lose and the center comes off-, in the last cubes I got and delivered 
the problem is bigger as normal during speedcubing. It can easily be 
resolved with some glue, please look at my trouble shooting guide how 
to repair this. http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Speedcube/makinga.htm 

I am sorry for this, I already asked the Rubik&#x27;s Studio to look in to 
this problem. In the mean time some supper glue does the trick.

one other thing.

try to break down the algorithms into groups.  this makes the task of 
memorization seem a lot less intimidating.  for instance, for the 
OLL, you can seperate into 4 edges oriented correctly, 2 oriented in 
a line, 2 oriented in an &quot;L&quot;, and none oriented.  for the PLL, you 
can break it down based on the shape it makes (&quot;Z&quot; perms, &quot;T&quot; perm, 3 
edges + 3 corners).  then with the F2L you can do it based on the 
position and orientation of the corner.  this helps set short term 
goals that are a lot more reachable.

I guess Perl is a good choice for this since we regularly have a &quot;perlgolf&quot;
contest, where the object is to solve a programming problem using as few
characters as possible. Only drawback is the speed requirements. 1 second is
not very fast and would limit the possible approaches.

I am like *so* interested in this; I may even decide to have a contest
with a real cash prize!  I may have rules such as:

1.  Program must finish in under 1 second (on a reasonable modern
    machine) for any given input;

2.  Final solution sequence must be &lt; 200 moves long (say);

3.  Input specification is---what?  What&#x27;s the simplest way to
    describe a given cube configuration?  UFR FU ...?

and perhaps I&#x27;ll have categories, since there are really three
important metrics (speed, solution length, and length of code).

Of course, then we gotta start arguing about implementation
language . . . maybe I&#x27;ll allow C, C++, Java, Perl, Python,
and that&#x27;s it.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, the best tip, and I think I speak for most people on the 
group, is to practice, and practice lots. You will go through 
periods of forgetting algorithms, so it helps to write them all down 
in a book so you can look them up as you need to. Eventually, with 
enough practice, the algorithm will become etched in your memory, 
and with even more practice you won&#x27;t even have to think when 
applying the algorithm.

It&#x27;s the order of the colors.  Here U represents the up color.
So the cubie FR (also called RF) in the UF position is
denoted by

   FR

if the F color is up, and by

   RF

if the R color is up.  You can understand it by putting the
scrambled position on &quot;top of&quot; the solved cube:

   UF UR UB UL DF DR DB . . .
   RF FL BR FU LU RD LB . . .

means that (for instance) the FL cubie is where the UR cubie
normally goes, with the F color on the U face and the L color
on the R face.  And so on.

That could be arranged.  My biggest problem is obtaining money to buy the prizes.  
The problem being I don&#x27;t think I can get funding until the spring term from my 
school so pretty much if not enough people sign up (and I already lowered the entry 
fee from 5 to 3), then the money comes from my pocket which, I guess I&#x27;m willing to 
do a bit in the name of the cube.  Do you have any good ideas on an alternate prize?  I 
wonder how much trophies cost.  I should look into that perhaps.  It&#x27;d be rather silly 
to give cubes away as prizes ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hello, I fully support this more standardized method of taking <br>
averages. Everything I would like to say has been said other than <br>
this: I feel strongly that rolling averages should be allowed. A <br>
best average that you would submit would still be representative of <br>
average times, but is a slightly lucky case, if you will. Taking <br>
rolling averages is no different than just taking many many true <br>
(true meaning start, then do 12 cubes, then stop; e.g. non-rolling) <br>
averages, it is just less time consuming. The rolling averages still <br>
represent an average time of solves, it is just a good set of 12. As <br>
long as the 12 cubes are consecutive, It is no different at all than <br>
randomly starting a true average, you just take the best of what you <br>
can average out, It still represents the best of 12 a person could <br>
put out. Doing true averages and compairing that to competitions is <br>
pointless, because in a tournament you cannot re-try the average as <br>
many times as you want, which you can when getting a true average to <br>
submit to the records site.<br>
<br>
Also: Jess Bondes timing program could find an easier way of <br>
stopping the times, for instance making ANY key on the keyboard stop <br>
the timer (which would require the program to be programmed in C++ <br>
or what have you, and actually compiled instead of using javascript, <br>
which i realize is quite a task, but would be a very nice addition) <br>
and do something such as once the timer is stopped, dont allow <br>
anything to be changed in the program for a second, just to prevent <br>
accidental timer resets.<br>
<br>
As for the piece pop.. I think one should be allowed, made up by a <br>
13th time. This is not a serious sport where people would be <br>
inclined to cheat. Allow one piece pop with the clause &quot;You cannot <br>
do it intentionally&quot; and make it honor based. I don&#x27;t think anyone <br>
that has really good times has the lack of integrity to pop a piece <br>
purposefully just to help their average.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts. Please Post any ideas you have in response to <br>
mine, I would appriciate it.<br>

I&#x27;ve already made a post on this method once before, but I&#x27;ve made <br>
an addition.  I&#x27;ve set up a table for all the LL situations that <br>
would come up.  I could also use some more feedback on steps 3-5.  <br>
I&#x27;m thinking maybe I might change the steps to:<br>
<br>
*extended cross<br>
*add 2x2x1 next<br>
<br>
Then it would be possible to go onto step 4.  People suggested <br>
combining step 4 with 5 someway, but even step 5 by itself is a <br>
massive amount of algs to learn!  I&#x27;m just trying to perfect it in <br>
theory before I start learning too many algs.<br>

It avoids such things as R R2 and R L R2.
I have no doubt someone has written something like this already. 
Whatever. You can change the number of moves you want to use.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s Friday again, which means the results of the FMC are now <br>
online, and available from www.cubestation.co.uk<br>
<br>
You may notice a couple of changes to the layout of the results.<br>
<br>
Firstly, due to the big demand I have added a seperate QTM (Quarter <br>
Turn Metric) ranking alongside the Half Turn and Slice turn Metrics. <br>
So there are now 3 first positions up for grabs! When you enter your <br>
solutions by using the form on the FMC page, could you please also <br>
provide all three counts using the boxes provided.<br>
<br>
Secondly, from an idea given to me by Chris Hardwick, to try and get <br>
more people involved in Fewest Moves Solving, I have added different <br>
grades to aim for when playing the FMC each week. For some of you it <br>
may seem almost impossble to reach a first place with some of the <br>
amazing solutions that get posted by the greats in FMC solving. But <br>
now there is the chance to aim for personal goals, by aiming for the <br>
different levels that I have set up. You may want to aim for Expert <br>
(0-27 moves), or Advanced (28-39 moves), or if you are inexperienced <br>
in Fewest Moves Solving and are learning the ropes, you may like to <br>
go for Intermediate (40-51 moves) or Beginner (52+ moves). Whatever <br>
you decide to do, set yourself a realistic goal and try and maintain <br>
a consistent standard each week! (I did not have time to add <br>
the &quot;detailed explanation&quot; to the results page just yet, but smaller <br>
explanations can be found by clicking the buttons on the submission <br>
form)<br>
<br>
Finally, don&#x27;t forget to join the Fewest Moves Challenge Group, <br>
which can be found at <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fewestmoveschallenge - where you can <br>
discuss all aspects of Fewest Moves Solving, and ask the top players <br>
about their strategies.<br>
<br>
Good Luck to all of you, I hope to see you all taking part in the <br>
FMC&#x27;s to come!<br>

This would be cool.  I&#x27;ve even got a program in mind; it&#x27;s about 70% done.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Michael, for moving corners from the top to the bottom I use a 
method that Dror described to me while at the WC.  If you have the 
pieces oriented in such a way that if a piece is in U or D and it 
belongs in either U or D then the color it shows on the top of its 
face is either the U or D color.  Basically what I mean is if the 
corner that belongs in DBR when the cube is solved is in UFL then 
the D color is showing on the top of U.  If all your pieces are 
oriented like that, then you can do a turn like R2 or L2 and then do 
a simple corner mover algorithm in the U layer, then undo your R2 at 
the end.  This will move your corners around between layers.  For 
example say that all the corners in the top layer belong there 
except for the corner at UBL.  Now assume that all the corners in 
the bottom layer belong there except for the one at DFR.  If you do 
the move R2, your incorrect corners will be lined in such a way in 
the U layer that doing the algorithm R2B2RFR&#x27;B2RF&#x27;R will move them 
into correct positions such that undoing your original R2 move will 
place all the corners in their correct layer.  Also notice that the 
very first R2 setup move and the R2 for the first move of the 
algorithm undo eachother.  If you do decide to use this method, 
seeing little shortcuts like that helps to save time.

Another useful trick I use a lot is to purposefully get corners onto 
their opposite diagonals over the front face.  By that I mean if the 
corners that belong in DFR and DFL are in the U face in UFL and UFR 
respectively, and the corners that belong in UFR and UFL are in the 
D face in DFL and DFR respectively then get them into this position 
throughout your solving of the corners step,

This diagram is meant to be a head on view of the front face.

DFR-----------DFL  &lt;- U face
|____|____|____|
|              |   &lt;- middle or E layer
|----|----|----|
UFR-----------UFL  &lt;- D face

In this diagram (hopefully it comes out ok) DFR means the corners 
that when the cube is solved will end up in DFR.  Same for all the 
other labels.

Hold your cube like in the diagram and rotate once away from you 
(i.e. do x) and do the permutation where you switch 4 diagonal 
corners.  This preserves the orientation of the corners if they are 
oriented as I mentioned above, and also you not only get the corners 
to their correct layers, but also the correct spots.

I hope that explanation makes sense at all.  This is one of those 
things that is easy to show in person but harder to describe with 
text.  If I messed up on some explanation let me know and I&#x27;ll try 
to clear it up.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey, I just started a website last night.  I&#x27;m working on it... don&#x27;t have much now but I <br>
put up some rules (mostly copied from the RWC rules) for the tournament.  Let me <br>
know if there&#x27;s anything wrong or anything you feel should be changed or anything <br>
that&#x27;s good for that matter.  I&#x27;ll be working on this site quite a bit over the three day <br>
weekend.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ll have a home for the Caltech Rubik&#x27;s Cube Club up soon... <br>
looking ahead to posting results and pictures too!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I had a similar problem last year when I almost cut off my left 
index finger.  I just stopped using it for cubing and started using 
my middle finger instead.  As a result I got really good at using my 
left hand.  Maybe you can do something like that.

I&#x27;m working on the 5x5 right now. I put all the middles together, <br>
then all the edges, then solve as a 3x3.  Im just wondering if <br>
people have a specific method for doing the first two steps, like <br>
pairing up the edges in a specific way, or the middle pieces.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
This might be a little late, but about the new &quot;official rules,&quot; I <br>
really think that there should be a limit to the number of lucky <br>
cases allowed in an average run. Since 1 second in a solve is .1 sec <br>
in the average, 3 lucky cases could mean 1 second off the average, <br>
assuming 1 lucky case can save 5 seconds. In fact, my best rollin <br>
average with 4 lucky cases is 14.1, in which I had, I think, 2 lucky <br>
11 and 2 lucky 13.<br>
<br>
So my proposal is this:<br>
  The maximum number of lucky cases allowed in a average run is 2.<br>
<br>
Here, a lucky case means Cross/OLL/PLL/CLL/ELL skip. I don&#x27;t like to <br>
think of a F2L slot skip as a lucky case, unless it is more than 2 <br>
slots. There should be another category just for averages with 3 or <br>
more lucky cases.<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I think Macky has a good point.  So, lucky cases are allowed in a tournament... but at <br>
a tournament, such as the RWC, you didn&#x27;t get to try for as many averages as you <br>
want.  People sitting at home constantly doing averages (not that it&#x27;s a bad thing) will <br>
of course hit more lucky cases.<br>

Btw... as a side note, I&#x27;m thinking of holding a tournament similar to the one next <br>
week once a term... (whch means one fall, winter, spring, and summer.)  Would more <br>
people be able to come for one during the summer or one during the spring set <br>
during a break... though the spring break idea one is probably not good as everyone&#x27;s <br>
break is different.  I was thinking perhaps the summer tournament could be slightly <br>
larger than the rest.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Im not so sure.  I don&#x27;t really believe in lucky cases I guess.  Apart from anything else what is lucky depends on the solve strategy.  Someone who was expert in Fridrich, corners first and edges first for example might be able to judicously choose a strategy for each solve that increased the number of so-called lucky cases.  There is a certain skill to increasing the chances of lucky cases too.  Suppose someone comes up with a one look strategy for the LL.  Part of this strategy will include solving a case that is permutation only.  For the one look solver this is not lucky just one of many cases.  For a 2-look solver this would be a lucky case.  (Similarly and more realistically for 3 v. 2 looks etc).<br>
<br>
I can see the point but I&#x27;m not convinced<br>

<br>
For a long time I had sequences for solving the cube using Ryan&#x27;s method. It <br>
was just a list of sequences with no diagrams. Yesterday I made diagrams for <br>
the step 4 cases and this morning I finished the section on step 4. If you&#x27;re <br>
interested in learning his method or solving the LL in 2 looks doing the ELL/<br>
CLL then you should look at this. All the sequences are optimized and are the <br>
fastest I can make them.<br>

I would like to know what you think of the sequences.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Duncan. When I think of lucky cases, I think in terms 
of cases and number of moves...., which doesn&#x27;t necessarliy 
corrolate perfectly with the final time. That is, it can take me 
longer to do fewer moves (when those moves are not easily trigger-
able). Most of the time when I solve the LL in one algorithm, my 
time is just as long as when I solve in two steps (perhaps due to 
recognition). I also use certain tactics to result in more 
preferable cases later in the solve, the so-called lucky cases, but 
this does require some skill.

Besides, with averages, it all averages out in the end...

Apart from anything else what is lucky depends on the solve 
strategy.  Someone who was expert in Fridrich, corners first and 
edges first for example might be able to judicously choose a 
strategy for each solve that increased the number of so-called lucky 
cases.  There is a certain skill to increasing the chances of lucky 
cases too.  Suppose someone comes up with a one look strategy for 
the LL.  Part of this strategy will include solving a case that is 
permutation only.  For the one look solver this is not lucky just 
one of many cases.  For a 2-look solver this would be a lucky case.  
(Similarly and more realistically for 3 v. 2 looks etc).

Here&#x27;s an interesting thought that I wonder if anyone has explored. <br>
Instead of enumerating all the positions at a particular level,<br>
instead enumerate all the &quot;multipaths&quot; at that level (positions that<br>
can be reached in multiple different ways)---and subtract that value<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been solving cubes since the early 80s when the original Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Cube came into fame.  I purchased one while in Jr High School and <br>
have loved them ever since.<br>
<br>
Many years ago I purchased a book called &quot;The Simple Solution To <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube,&quot; a nice simple paperback about 30 pages long.  It <br>
wasn&#x27;t the most complex method and didn&#x27;t involve the techniques that <br>
the new generation of cubers/cubists are using, but it&#x27;s the one that <br>
I remember the best.  My best personal time using that solution was <br>
about 26 seconds (not too shabby back in the early 80s).<br>
<br>
Years ago (within the past 5 years or so) I stumbled across that same <br>
solution on the Internet, all the same terminology and all the same <br>
move sequences.  The problem is, I can&#x27;t find that solution again.  :)<br>
<br>
I can solve the cube down to the last layer (I do a top to bottom <br>
solution) and I&#x27;m getting stuck at the bottom layer.<br>
<br>
If anyone can point me in the direction of that solution online I&#x27;d <br>
be eternally greatful.  I will learn some of these new techniques <br>
from Lars and Jessica (their times are amazing to an old Cubist like <br>
me) and I&#x27;ll beat my own personal best of 26 seconds.<br>
<br>
Any assistance is great appreciated, now I&#x27;ve got a lot of reading to <br>
catch up on in this group.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Paul<br>

However, our website, my and Josef Jelinek&#x27;s, http://cube.misto.cz ,

&gt; Hi there,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ve been solving cubes since the early 80s when the original <br>
Rubik&#x27;s <br>
&gt; Cube came into fame.  I purchased one while in Jr High School and <br>
&gt; have loved them ever since.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Many years ago I purchased a book called &quot;The Simple Solution To <br>
&gt; Rubik&#x27;s Cube,&quot; a nice simple paperback about 30 pages long.  It <br>
&gt; wasn&#x27;t the most complex method and didn&#x27;t involve the techniques <br>
that <br>
&gt; the new generation of cubers/cubists are using, but it&#x27;s the one <br>
that <br>
&gt; I remember the best.  My best personal time using that solution <br>
was <br>
&gt; about 26 seconds (not too shabby back in the early 80s).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Years ago (within the past 5 years or so) I stumbled across that <br>
same <br>
&gt; solution on the Internet, all the same terminology and all the <br>
same <br>
&gt; move sequences.  The problem is, I can&#x27;t find that solution <br>
again.  :)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I can solve the cube down to the last layer (I do a top to bottom <br>
&gt; solution) and I&#x27;m getting stuck at the bottom layer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If anyone can point me in the direction of that solution online <br>
I&#x27;d <br>
&gt; be eternally greatful.  I will learn some of these new techniques <br>
&gt; from Lars and Jessica (their times are amazing to an old Cubist <br>
like <br>
&gt; me) and I&#x27;ll beat my own personal best of 26 seconds.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Any assistance is great appreciated, now I&#x27;ve got a lot of reading <br>
to <br>
&gt; catch up on in this group.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks,<br>

I took an online IQ test once and got a 177, which is like a FREAKING

That book&#x27;s solution (especially the last layer) was very similar to
http://jjorg.chem.unc.edu/personal/monroe/cube/Denny3x3/index.htm (a
mirror of a now nonexistant page). That method is by far the simplest
to learn, and the terminology (L,U2,R&#x27;) has been replaced with simple
pictures, very easy to understand. In fact, I&#x27;m currently writing an
online utility to convert strings of crypto-terminology into batches
of those pictures, to make it easier for beginnners.

So ye, that may be the site you were looking for.

Take a look at the page on my site about the Turn&#x27;Push puzzle. It is
equivalent to the &lt;U,R2> cube group. On that page I have a table
showing the number of positions in QTM vs HTM.

sometime.

But my program was counting R2 as one move not two.
So this is a &quot;mixed metric&quot; I think. I&#x27;m counting U2 as
two moves. I think your calculation is the same in that
for quarter turns you are still counting R2 as a single move.
I&#x27;ll calculate out &lt;U, -U, U2, R2 > and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get
depth = 20.

I don&#x27;t have Cube Explorer, but if you have at least 700MB memory,<br>

The solutions vary a *lot*.  I can give you a database of tens of<br>
thousands of positions with both QTM and HTM optimal sequences<br>
for each.  There usually appears to be no relation between the<br>
HTM and QTM optimal sequences.<br>

It&#x27;s very easy to work:
&lt;applet code=&quot;Cube.class&quot; width=160 height=183>
			&lt;param name=&quot;bgcolor&quot; value=&quot;FF8000&quot;>
			&lt;param name=&quot;facelets&quot; 
value=&quot;yyyyyyyyywwwwwwwwwrrrrrrrrrooooooooobbbbbbbbbggggggggg&quot;>
			&lt;param name=&quot;move&quot; value=&quot;R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; 
U&#x27; R U R&#x27;&quot;>
&lt;/applet>

d=gray
w=white
g=green
y=yellow
b=blue
r=red
o=orange ... each letter in the string yyy... etc represents a 
facelet on the cube, They follow a fairly logical order, except for 
the blue face which seems to be backwards. I would recommend setting 
everything to gray, except for one facelet, just to get a feel for 
the order in which the facelets occur in the string. You can do this 
several times, and build up a picture of how it all works.

&lt;param name=&quot;bgcolor&quot; value=&quot;FF8000&quot;> = colour of the background in 
hexadecimal... set this to whatever you need.

&lt;param name=&quot;move&quot; value=&quot;R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;&quot;> = the 
algorithms of course.

&lt;applet code=&quot;Cube.class&quot; width=160 height=183> = there are two 
files which make up the applet, Cube.class and cube_misto[1].java, 
you must have both of these files in the same directory as the html 
file for it to display on the webpage.

Good Luck,
Dan Harris

          <div class="email-content">Hi Koen , this is what people mean by the &quot;cube supergroup&quot;.  It is a slightly harder problem than the usual cube.  You can develop moves that just turn the centres quite easily by carrying out say one position move and then putting the face back in two different moves (say putting corners and edges back separately).  Haven&#x27;t done this sort of thing for a while but there have been posts fairly recently I think.<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] solving a picture cube<br>
<br>
<br>
  Yesterday I bought the &#x27;Holland cube&#x27;, which is basically a 3x3x3 <br>
  with pictures on the faces. This means all 9 stickers of a face form <br>
  one picture. During solving this baby I encountered problems with <br>
  the center pieces making quarter turns during LL algorythms. This <br>
  means I solved the cube but two of the centres don&#x27;t fit the picture <br>
  (turned 90 degrees). This problem doesn&#x27;t occur when solving a <br>
  normal 3x3x3 because the stickers look the same no matter how <br>
  they&#x27;re turned :P<br>
<br>
  Anyone know how to work around this problem? I think certain <br>
  algorytms just can&#x27;t be used.<br>

          <div class="email-content">hello,
you can just use some algs depending on the 2 centers you need fixed.
If the 2 centers you need are on the U and L, where the U center 
needs to be moved clockwise and the L needs to be moved counter 
clockwise, use this
UV&#x27;H&#x27;VU&#x27;V&#x27;HV.....v = vertical slice, H = horizontal slice,
if you need the opposite, do this move backwards

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve played with those before. What I usually do is to perform the &quot;Z&quot; permutation twice - one scrambles it and the other returns it to solved state. This will rotate some of the centers, but I can&#x27;t remember which ones. Also, you could do the &quot;Z&quot; permutation twice and the do the &quot;+&quot; permutation to solve the cube again. It&#x27;s fun to experiment with those and see what they do.

          <div class="email-content">A very simple way is to perform the &quot;fried egg/Japanese flag&quot; move, which is:<br>
<br>
1. any quarter slice move<br>
2. any other slice move<br>
3. reverse 1<br>
4. reverse 2<br>
<br>
Now you have discoupled the centers from their layers. Turn any side, <br>
and then reverse the slice moves, and your middle move. This will <br>
twist the center of the side you moved exactly how you moved it, and <br>
the center of the color that was surrounding it in the opposite <br>
direction.<br>
<br>
If you want to get fancy, you can do two or more moves, just as long <br>
as you can  reverse them in the end.<br>

You can actually solve the centers as you go, if you want to use a <br>
less-than-optimal solution. Specifically, I was thinking of Mark <br>
Jeays&#x27; solution ( http://www.jeays.net/rubiks.htm ), which you can <br>
apply such that center adjustment is not necessary at the end.<br>
<br>
When creating the cross, make sure the first 5 centers are properly <br>
aligned.  They will stay that way throughout.  After doing the F2L <br>
(minus a corner edge pair) and orienting the LL edges, place them in <br>
relation to not only each other, but also the center (thus orienting <br>
the center properly).  Corner permutation and orientation can then be <br>
completed (with his algs) without disturbing any centers).<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a less efficient method, but since recognition can be more <br>
difficult with a picture cube anyways, it may be advantageous to take <br>
an approach, like his, that concentrates on only one piece at a time <br>
(instead of C/E pairs during F2L).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi David,

Winnet Lounge is part of Winnet Center.  Just take the stairs.  As for directions from 
the 210... depending on which direction you come from, just exit on Hill Avenue.  Go 
South on Hill Avenue and turn right on Del Mar.  Then you can turn left on Holliston 
and there will be a parking structure on your left side.  You&#x27;ll want to ask security 
where to park and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll let you know.  Security is on the first floor.  Just 
park your car and just make sure it&#x27;s okay as sometimes they will give visitors a 
special permit.

As for where Winnet Lounge is on campus, Caltech as a campus is really really really 
small so you should have no trouble finding it using the directory but here&#x27;s a rough 
location.  From the parking structure, walk south on holliston until the corner of San 
Pasqual and Holliston.  Then turn right into campus... and it&#x27;s left past some tables 
and a small cafe.  You can e-mail me at tmao@... if you have any more 
questions.

Street parking is also another option.  If you go further south on Hill ave., you&#x27;ll find 
california ave.  Turn right and usually there are spots open on a saturday night.

I ordered a lot of stuff from Ton... $285.63 worth of stuff to be exact.  YIKES!  But hey, 
they&#x27;re cubes.  You gotta have cubes.  The scheduled date for the delivery is January 
26... so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get them in time for the tournament but maybe I&#x27;ll get lucky 
and they&#x27;ll come.

By the way, you haven&#x27;t e-mailed me saying you will enter for the tournament.  Do you 
plan to just show up at the door?

Hi Koen,

   Interesting answers you&#x27;ve gotten so far. I&#x27;m amazed sometimes at
the different approaches different people find. Anyway, here&#x27;s another
one.

   Put the side having one center that you wish to rotate on the front
F, and a second one on the Left, Back or Right side.

1. Move the center to the Up side, and 
2. rotate the Up side the way you want the center turned. This messes
up other things. 
3. Return the center to the Front side. 
4. Move the other center laterally to the Front side and 
5. reverse the procedure: move the second center to the Up side, and 
6. rotate the Up side the other way. This unmesses up those other things. 
7. Return that center to the Front side and then 
8. Return that center to it&#x27;s own side laterally. 

   Sorry if that&#x27;s confusing.

DJ

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, I see that there has been some questions recently about <br>
the 3x3x3 supercube, and I thought I would add another.  About a week <br>
ago one of my friends gave me a picture cube with each center sticker <br>
having 4 distinct rotations (i.e. a supercube) and since I had left <br>
my homemade one at home I used this one to have fun supercubing.  <br>
Anyway to make a long story short I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking <br>
on the supercube lately and I still have one nagging question.  I&#x27;m <br>
sure you group theory buffs already know this, but I discovered that <br>
the parity of the corners, edges, and centers are always the same <br>
with respect to two pieces swaps, two piece swaps, and quarter turns <br>
respectively.  I thought this was a cool fact and anyway I&#x27;ll come <br>
back to this.  After reading the website &quot;How to solve almost any <br>
Rubik-like puzzle&quot; at <br>
http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/rubikpuzzles.html I was able to <br>
alter all of my center rotation algs to create ones with fewer moves, <br>
except for one case.  My previous alg to rotate one center clockwise <br>
and the other one counter-clockwise was (E&#x27;R&#x27;ER)*5 which I found via <br>
trial an error when looking for an alg that scrambled the cube and <br>
brought it back to solved in a short number of moves.  After reading <br>
the above website though, I quickly discovered ME&#x27;M&#x27;UMEM&#x27;U&#x27; and a <br>
similar alg ME2M&#x27;UME2M&#x27; if the pieces needing to be flipped are on <br>
opposite faces.  One position still confuses me though, that is when <br>
only one center is flipped, and it is flipped two quarter turns away <br>
from solved.  This is clearly still a position with even parity, <br>
since in this position the corners and edges both have even parity.  <br>
However I am confused about an efficient way to solve this position.  <br>
The strategy I use now is to find an alg that changes the parity of <br>
the cube (i.e. from even to odd or odd to even) and also will <br>
scramble and solve the cube again after two reptitions.  The alg I <br>
use most often is simply one of the permutation algs in the 2 or 3 <br>
look LL, L&#x27;U&#x27;LULF&#x27;L2ULUL&#x27;U&#x27;LF which happens to be, for me, the <br>
fastest of the permutation algs that has the satisfactory <br>
characteristics.  So anyway this alg, if you don&#x27;t have a cube handy, <br>
switches the edges UR and UL and switches the corners UBL and UFL, <br>
creating odd parity in the corners and edges and necessarily also in <br>
the centers by rotating the top face center once clockwise.  By <br>
applying this alg again, you switch UR and UL again and UBL and UFL <br>
again, solving them and also again creating even parity, and you <br>
perform one more clockwise turn on the U face center, thereby <br>
rotating only the U center twice and returning the cube to the solved <br>
state.  What disturbs me is that I know there must be a more <br>
efficient way to solve this position.  I remember at the WC when DanK <br>
brought up whether or not this positions was possible that Doug Li <br>
showed us a very short move that rotated just one center, though I <br>
don&#x27;t remember what the move was.  So anyway I just know that there <br>
is a more elegant way to do this, but does it involve the same <br>
strategy?  Do you have to use the formula from the &quot;How to solve any <br>
rubik-like puzzle&quot; XsX&#x27;s&#x27; or is there a &quot;shortest&quot; alg that achieves <br>
odd parity and solves with two repetitions such that you can just <br>
apply that alg twice and you end up with only one center flipped?  Or <br>
is there an even more elegant move that just directly solves this, <br>
and what strategy would that use?<br>
<br>
This one center flipped position also is related to the position <br>
where say two centers are rotated clockwise, or two are rotated <br>
counterclockwise.  To solve those two positions would you just rotate <br>
one center twice, then solve the last two by the formula XsX&#x27;s or are <br>
there ways to &quot;direct solve&quot; those positions as well?  So anyway I&#x27;ve <br>
put a lot of though into this over the past week and this position <br>
has totally stumped me, does anyone have any ideas?  For this <br>
position do you somehow have to change the centers to odd parity via <br>
an alg, and then use another (or the same) alg to return to even <br>
parity or is there a way to simply direct solve it?<br>
<br>
Any ideas would be welcome, and I&#x27;ll post if I come up with anything <br>
as well.<br>
<br>
If someone already knows how to handle these cases in an efficient <br>
way then please post!  If no, maybe we can put our heads together as <br>
a group and come up with some really nice algs to do this (no <br>
computer help please!  It is more fun to do this using our heads!)<br>
<br>
Hope this might start some conversation on supercubes,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow!  I just looked at that alg and that is very cool how that 
works.  It seems though that your alg also follows the same strategy 
that my very inefficient alg did, namely to create odd parity via an 
alg that solves the cube after two repetitions, then restore to even 
parity on the second repetition.  It seems the first part of your 
alg, R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; maintains even parity, but then once you do the U 
move it completes the whole alg so to speak and creates odd parity 
overall.  The first part of the alg done again places the U layer 
back together as well as the first two layers but the cube still has 
odd parity until the final U turn, which also restores the cube.  I 
wonder if this is the only approach that will solve this position?  
I&#x27;ve noticed that it is also possible to avoid this position in 
solving a supercube, namely to orient the top face center correctly 
simply by turning the U face after you have solved the F2L and 
oriented the LL.  Doing a 3 edge swap rotates two centers twice, and 
doing a 3 corner swap does not affect the centers, so the cube can be 
solved from here with nothing more than a 2 center flip to do at the 
end.  There are probably moves that move the edges without affecting 
the centers too, which would make this approach even more efficient.  
So in speed supercubing, would it be better to have fast moves for 
solving the last two centers (assuming you solve the first two layers 
in such a way as to preserve the first 5 centers) and then fix the 
last center and any ones your LL algs may have misaligned, or to have 
all LL algs that do not affect the orientation, but perform more algs 
on average per solve to complete the LL and avoid any center 
rotations?

That is a really cool algorithm by the way for flipping one center 
twice.  I wonder if there are other algs that can do this in 12 
moves, or if there is an alg that does it in less?

Just trying to get some conversation going,
Chris

I don&#x27;t know if I believe that guy.  If he could really solve the cube in 45 seconds, he <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

All those face-turning algs mentioned here were known already in 
early 80&#x27;s and mentioned in the famous leflet book &quot;Notes on the 
Magic Cube&quot; by David B Singmaster (i may have gotten the title wrong, 
it&#x27;s not at hand).

Other interesting supergroup algs are:

L2F2R2-Ds-B2R2F2-Us = {B2,L2}
F2R2sF2-Ds-R2F2sR2-Us = {F2,R2,B2,L2}

But when solving the supercube in as fwe moves as possible one never 
uses those algs. Instead all the cubicles are positioned correctly 
with respect to face centers straight away. Normally this can be done 
in 55-60 moves :D But it requires some practice to do that ;-)

Per K Fredlund

Hi,

I&#x27;m a newbie (to cubing and to the list), and I might be interested
in getting together occasionally.  Don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d be able to 
travel very far for it, though.  I&#x27;m in Raleigh.

trial an error when looking for an alg that scrambled the cube and

the above website though, I quickly discovered ME&#x27;M&#x27;UMEM&#x27;U&#x27; and a
similar alg ME2M&#x27;UME2M&#x27; if the pieces needing to be flipped are on
opposite faces.  &lt;

  This alg can be used to rotate two centers opposite directions,
whether those centers are adjacent or 180 degrees out: r U r&#x27; u r U&#x27;
r&#x27; u&#x27; 

Properly:
r 
U (or U2 or U&#x27;)
r&#x27;
u (or u2 or u&#x27;)
r
U&#x27; (or U2 or U)
r&#x27;
u&#x27; (or u2 or u)

   For the primary notation I use the small case letters to mean only
the slices. This is different from the usage of small case letters in
your secondary notation.

   I&#x27;d ask you to adopt the simpler, clearer notation,

          <div class="email-content">I changed the color scheme of my 4x4 earlier today. All I had to do <br>
was swap the blue and yellow faces to get the scheme I wanted. But I <br>
didn&#x27;t want to resticker 32 stickers. So...<br>
<br>
a) What&#x27;s the minimum number of stickers you need to resticker to <br>
swap two adjacent faces?<br>
<br>
b) Find a short algorithm that when you execute it from a solved <br>
cube makes it obvious which stickers have to be restickered for your <br>
a) solution.<br>
<br>
c) How about a) and b) if you want to swap two opposite faces?<br>
<br>
d) What&#x27;s the worst case color rescheming (keeping the same colors, <br>
though, otherwise the answer would obviously be 96 ;-))?<br>
<br>
e) For any of the restickering numbers, does it help to disassemble <br>
the cube?<br>
<br>
The answers to a) and c)a) are fairly easy, but I haven&#x27;t thought <br>
about the other questions yet...<br>

          <div class="email-content">This was a lot of fun to try and work out!  I only got answers to 
part a) through part c), but I&#x27;m still thinking about the answers to 
the others.  For switching the colors of two adjacent faces the 
minimum number of stickers I found that require switching is 10.  
Switch the U sticker of UFR with the D sticker of DFR, switch the B 
stickers of the edge group at BR with the L stickers of the edge of 
FL (only the edges, not including the corners on that edge) and 
switch the F stickers of UFL and DFL with the R stickers of UBR and 
DBR.

As far as a &quot;short&quot; alg to make this obvious my shortest one is 77 
moves in HTM. :)  I broke it up into five parts to make it easier to 
read.  To perform the alg just do each part right after the other:

Part 1: D2 L2 B2 R B&#x27; R&#x27; B F R&#x27; F B&#x27; R&#x27; B R F2 U B2 L2 D2
Part 2: d2 B2 R2 u R2 d&#x27; R2 d R2 F2 d F2 u&#x27; B2 d2
Part 3: B d u&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F R F D&#x27; F2 R F R F&#x27; R&#x27; F D B d&#x27; u B&#x27;
Part 4: d R2 d2 U D&#x27; F2 U&#x27; D d
Part 5: B&#x27; R&#x27; B R&#x27; B&#x27; R2 B F R F&#x27; R F R2 F&#x27;

which makes 79 moves, but combining the parts in the most economical 
way I could, I reduced that to &quot;only&quot; 77 moves :)  There has got to 
be a more efficient way to do this, I just did it by performing it in 
several steps.  Here is the whole 77 move alg to show the position 
when performed on a solved cube.  Moves in parenthesis can be done at 
the same time.

D2 L2 B2 R B&#x27; R&#x27; B F R&#x27; F B&#x27; R&#x27; B R F2 U B2 L2 (D2 d2) B2 R2 u R2 d&#x27; 
R2 d R2 F2 d F2 u&#x27; B2 d&#x27; R2 d2 U D&#x27; F2 U&#x27; (D d) B d u&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F R F 
D&#x27; F2 R F R F&#x27; R&#x27; F D B d&#x27; u B2 R&#x27; B R&#x27; B&#x27; R2 B F R F&#x27; R F R2 F&#x27;

--------------------------
If you want to switch just two opposite faces the minimum number of 
stickers I could find needing to be removed and placed somewhere else 
is 8.  Switch all the B face stickers of BUL BUR BDR BDL and F face 
stickers of FUL FUR FDR FDL.  Here&#x27;s an alg to make this obvious, 
same as for the first example.  Again moves in parenthesis can be 
done at the same time.
d2 r2 d2 (r2 l2) d2 l2 u2 R2 (u2 d2) L2 D2 L2 R2 U2
---------------
For these cases it doesn&#x27;t seem to help to dissassemble the cube (the 
alg goes faster than getting the center pieces back in IMHO).  Maybe 
if you were to rotate the three colors of U,F and R then it would 
help to dissassemble the cube in order to rotate the corner at UFR to 
accomodate the new scheme.  I have a feeling the either swapping R 
with L and also U with F, or rotating U, F, and R clockwise or 
counter clockwise may take more than 10 stickers to switch, though I 
haven&#x27;t looked into it too much yet (it&#x27;s getting late and about bed 
time for me) :)

I&#x27;d like to keep looking into this.  Are there other ways to switch 
the stickers and not have to switch too many?  I wonder if anyone has 
any ideas about a worst case sticker switching scenario?

My two cents,
Chris

Unfortunately such scepticism is nothing new.

Of course Chris&#x27; solves are real - he did it in front of 100s of 
people under competition conditions.  This is irrefutable.

2,400 years ago, the ancient Athenian historian THUCYDIDES (5th 
century BC) summed up the nature AND REASON for human scepticism 
perfectly:

In a speech praising fallen war dead he &#x27;quotes&#x27; the Athenian head 
of state Pericles:

&quot;Praises of other men are endurable only to the point that the 
hearer thinks that he himself could perform some of the deeds being 
spoken.  What goes beyond this immediately leads to envy and 
disbelief.&quot;

Chris&#x27; awesome achievements are so far beyond the abilities of the 
sceptics that they are simply jealous and console themselves by 
masquerading this envy as scepticism.  Their loss.

          <div class="email-content">Just for the sake of argument, not to put down another idea from 
somebody, but I really don&#x27;t see how switching 8 stickers can switch 
the colors of two adjacent faces.  Namely because there are two edge 
groups that need to exist on the cube that still do not by switching 
only the corners.  Here is an example based on the coloring of my 
cube.  I am using an Eastsheen 4x4x4 to help follow along if you have 
one.  The color on the B face is green, the color on the F face is 
blue, the R face is yellow and the L face is white, these are the 
only necessary colors to make my point.  The colors I want to switch 
are blue and yellow, same as Stefan wanted to switch originally.

Now assume I switch just the 8 stickers on the F and R face of the 
corners, now my color scheme, by virtue of examining the corners, has 
white opposite blue.  However I still retain the blue-white edge 
which was, and still is, in FL.  There is no way that two opposite 
colors can stay on the same edge and still have a solvable cube.  
Also, by virtue of how the corners now are after switching stickers, 
I will now have green opposite yellow on my cube, but the green-
yellow edge was and still is in BR.  There is now way I can have 
these two edges on my newly resticerd cube and still be solvable, so 
I therefore must switch the stickers on them as well.  Since 
switching stickers would seem to add 4 more to the number, making 12, 
I want to point out that switching the colors on the corners at UFR 
and DFR is much easier simply by switching the U sticker of UFR and D 
sticker of DFR since this position is still possible in the 4x4x4 
group.

The solution I proposed earlier, with 10 stickers needing to be 
switched, takes care of the pieces that would be impossible on the 
new color scheme, namely the 4 corners on the F face and the 2 on the 
BR edge of the cube (UBR and DBR), and the 2 problem edge groups in 
FL and BR.  All the other edges, and the centers, can be switched by 
the rules of the 4x4x4 and put into their new places without having 
to move stickers.

I don&#x27;t mean to try to shoot down any ideas, but just for the sake of 
arguing the riddle posted I don&#x27;t think it is possible to switch the 
colors of 2 adjacent faces by switching only 8 stickers?

          <div class="email-content">So yeah, I&#x27;ve posted a LOT recently, and sorry if I am becoming an <br>
annoyance, but I have another question.  4x4x4 cubes seem to be the <br>
topic of conversation lately, so here&#x27;s a question.  I wasn&#x27;t <br>
satisfied enough with my 3x3x3 supercube :) so I got out a magic <br>
marker and numbered all the centers of my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes, <br>
making supercubes such that the centers on each must always return to <br>
the exact same spot as the one they started in, in order to solve.  I <br>
have to say that though they were more difficult than the 4x4x4 and <br>
5x5x5 respectively, they are not too terribly so.  Anyway my question <br>
relates to the 4x4x4 supercube.  I have noticed that the parity on a <br>
3x3x3 supercube is always conserved between corners, edges, and <br>
centers.  However I have a question about the parity of a 4x4x4 <br>
supercube with respect to all the edge pieces.  I have found an alg <br>
that switches exactly two edge pieces, and leaves the rest of the <br>
cube in the exact same position, switching only two pieces and <br>
maintaining even parity in the corners and centers so to speak.  If <br>
the 4x4x4 supercube follows the same rules as the 3x3x3 supercube <br>
then this position in the edges should also be even parity.  But if <br>
that is the case then at any scrambled position I could simply switch <br>
two of the edges using this alg and the edges would still have the <br>
same parity.<br>
<br>
The algorithm is this,<br>
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; <br>
U<br>
<br>
This flips the edge pair in UF and leaves the rest of the cube alone.<br>
<br>
Perhaps parity in the 4x4x4 edges is with respect to two pieces <br>
switched across edge groups?  So if the piece in rUF (the right side <br>
piece of the edge group in UF, or the piece that lies on the <br>
intersection of the r slice, and the the U and F faces) had the F <br>
face sticker as a B color stcker and the piece in lBU had the B <br>
sticker an F color sticker, then maybe that would be odd parity, or <br>
would that even be an impossible position?<br>
<br>
Maybe the edges have no parity so to speak, or the parity is somehow <br>
neutral and can be described as either odd or even.<br>
<br>
So yeah, if it isn&#x27;t blatantly obvious already I have no idea about <br>
parity or group theory, but I&#x27;m trying to figure some of this out via <br>
experience with supercubes.  If anyone knows anything about this <br>
please post and help us ignorant people out!<br>
<br>
Again, just trying to get some conversation started on the group.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Mike,

On one hand, that really sucks.  Sorry for loosing your speed cube.  I myself have 
never had a cube stolen though of course, I&#x27;ve only been cubing for a very short 
period of time.  Though, I can&#x27;t help feel sorry for the person who stole your cube.  On 
Friday, he became one of the most worthless beings out there... he actually stole a 
Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  I mean come on... at least steal something that has a bit more 
monatery value.  Maybe he&#x27;ll try to sell it on eBay?  You might want to check there 
every now and then.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris!

One middle slice move on the 4x4x4 cube has the following 
decomposition (which should be obvious) : one 4 cycle on edges (odd 
permutation) and 2 4 cycles on facecenters (2 odd permutations which 
make it all an even permutation). Hence the facecenters can be 
restored with some 3-cycles (a 3-cycle is even).

An permutation is even if it consists of an even number of swaps 
(swap = 2-cycle).

Hope this makes all that a bit clearer. Trying to restore the 
remaining 4-cycle on the edges with 3-cycles will always leave at 
least 2 edges unsolved.

But if u go from 4x4x4 up to 6x6x6 u might achieve again a 2-cycle on 
edges, but it will leave u with a 2-cycle on the &quot;edge-facecenters&quot;. 
I leave u to work that out :-)

Regards,

Per Kristen

PS! With ur new improved supergroup algs on d 3x3x3 u should shave 
off at least 20 secs from ur average ;-)

A shorter solution here is : 
(F2f2)(u2d2)(F2f2)[U2(r2l2)]2 :D

4 cents for this :-P

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris, thanks for your extensive thoughts/posts. 10 (adjacent) <br>
and 8 (opposite) is also what I got... I also have the <br>
same &quot;obvious&quot; cube look, at least judging from your algorithm, your <br>
explanation describes a slightly different way I think.<br>
<br>
&gt; which makes 79 moves, but combining the parts in the most <br>
economical <br>
&gt; way I could, I reduced that to &quot;only&quot; 77 moves :)  There has got <br>
to <br>
&gt; be a more efficient way to do this, I just did it by performing it <br>
in <br>
&gt; several steps.<br>
<br>
Btw, is there a 4x4 solver program somewhere? How about the problem <br>
space diameter for it? Anything known?<br>
<br>
&gt; For these cases it doesn&#x27;t seem to help to dissassemble the cube <br>
(the <br>
&gt; alg goes faster than getting the center pieces back in IMHO).<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t care much about time when preparing cubes, I meant would it <br>
help to reduce the number of stickers that have to be moved? Just <br>
like you I have a strong feeling that other reschemings can take <br>
advantage of disassembling.<br>
<br>
Btw, how many different (not variations of each other by cube <br>
rotation/mirroring/rescheming) reschemings <br>
are there? ;-) That is, swapping U and D is not different from <br>
swapping L and R. And cycling UFR is not different from cycling URF. <br>
Or from cycling BLD, for example. So basically I&#x27;m asking for the <br>
number of different tasks I could&#x27;ve asked for in my riddle. I <br>
believe there are only eight.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey again!

Nice to discuss something else besides optimizing 3x3x3 
algs/methods :D

I have come up with a fairly short alg for problem c)a), restickering 
adjacent faces of the cube. My algorithm for this is :

======
(Uu)F2(U2u2)R2F2(Uu)F2R2F2R2B2(Uu)B2(U&#x27;u&#x27;)B2(Dd)B2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)
R2F&#x27;(Rr)U&#x27;R2U(R&#x27;r&#x27;)F&#x27;R2(Uu) : {38-HTM)
======

It really consists of four parts that have been amalgamated very 
nicely! Lots of moves cancelled out for me :D

It is worth noticing that this alg will generalize nicely to any
(2n)x(2n)x(2n) cube. That also goes for my alg for restickering 
opposite faces of the 4x4x4, it will generalize to 6x6x6, 8x8x8 ...

For the 4x4x4 that alg is:

======
(F2f2)(u2d2)(F2f2)[U2(r2l2)]2
======

Happy cubing all!!

          <div class="email-content">Hey!<br>
<br>
This will be my last posting for a while. Gonna give others a chance <br>
to post also ... hehe ...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been diving into my archives from early 80&#x27;s, and i found this <br>
extensive list of facecenter orienting algorithms for the 3x3x3 cube. <br>
At the time i thought i was the only interested in &quot;supercubing&quot;. <br>
<br>
In this list is also the answer to Chris&#x27;s request for easy algs for <br>
rotating 2 facecenters the same way one step (2 cases). <br>
<br>
Well anyway, here is the list (the effect on the centers is written <br>
inside the square brackets before the alg):<br>

If anyone spots any mistake and/or has any improvements please let me <br>
know! Many of the algs above are simply a combo of 2 other algs <br>
properly amalgamated ;-)<br>

have taken a little cube break.  It was fun to try and remember all <br>
of my algorithms.  My favorite part was when I was finishing up one <br>
of my solves.  I knew (or thought I knew) what alg to use so I <br>
looked at the timer to see what time I was getting.  Then I put the <br>
cube down and pushed the timer.  I looked up and the cube was not <br>
solved!!  LOL.  It was also great to see Macky solve the cube in <br>
12.8s!!!  Thanks again Tyson,<br>

Whilst I don&#x27;t exactly fit your criterion (not being in any 
profession), I could put you in contact with a lot of people who do 
use mathematics a lot in their work (e.g. professional 
mathematicians (university mathematics faculty) or people in the 
world of finance)).
As for the last part, maybe I can hazard a guess as to where 
mathematics might be used in some of them (though many of them will 
not go very deeply into mathematics, i.e. even beyond arithmetic):

accountant - this should be fairly straightforward; probably 
arithmetic, percentages etc.
actuary - statistics (they work in insurance, calculating 
probabilities of events, such as disasters etc.)
airplane pilot - I&#x27;d imagine it has to do with bearings to an extent 
(though with auto-pilots, this is probably less of an issue these 
days) and possibly with manual control (on landing), though I&#x27;d 
imagine that very little is worked out mathematicallyin the usual 
sense here (perhpas mentally in the same way as a tennis player or a 
footballer or whatever will mentally work out the angle and power 
for the ball; it is very much on a subconscious level, if that is 
the case)
architect - I&#x27;d imagine measurements, geometry, applied mathematics 
(forces, stress, gravity etc. must be accounted for), perhaps linear 
programming could be used to get feasible solutions to the stress 
problem
auto-body repair person - I&#x27;m guessing that this is (the US term 
for) someone who repairs cars. Presumably again, things like stress 
and forces will come into it at some stage.
bank teller - arithmetic, presumably
bank officer - again arithmetic, maybe (depending on what officer 
is) some linear programming in order to figure out investments, 
statistics, some calculus e.g. partial differential equations (I&#x27;m 
thinking on the lines of investments here, where stuff with names 
like the Black-Scholes equation crop up)
chef - principally arithmetic, I&#x27;d have thought, for ingredients
computer programmer - algorithms, numerical analysis, geometry (for 
graphics), mechanics (e.g. simulating graphics in games). Depending 
on the nature of the programming there could be a whole load of 
other stuff - linear programming, matrix calculations come to mind 
for instance.
computer technician - I&#x27;d imagine things like mechanics would come 
into it, if technician is design rather than repair, the physical 
volume will be important, so will cooling (heat equation perhaps?), 
efficient design of chips and so on.
construction worker - all kinds of stuff connected to measurements 
and forces again
counselor - not sure, at a guess some kind of statistics might be 
used
dentist - to work out the appropriate amount of anaesthetic some 
arithmetic might be necessary, perhaps also counting teeth!
dental assistant - to actually prepare the anaesthetic as per 
instruction, perhaps? (In the UK, all I&#x27;ve seen a dental assistant 
do is write down what the dentist tells them. I&#x27;m sure they do a lot 
more, but the part I&#x27;ve seen requires no mathematics.)
economist - arithmetic, statistics, calculus e.g. partial 
differential equations
electrical engineer - complex analysis, calculus
electrician - perhaps some simple equations (I&#x27;m thinking on the 
lines of working out calculations with parallel/series circuits), 
but I&#x27;m not sure what else
emergency medical technician - again, a good grasp of arithmetic. I 
imagine in an emergency, more complicated mathematics (if necessary) 
may have to be done by a machine for speed. 
FBI agent - not sure here; I can&#x27;t recall Dale Cooper using 
mathematics. Perhaps a certain level is expected just to be able to 
join the FBI (to ensure a level of proficiency, should the need 
arise). At the scene of a crime, the time of death might be possible 
to work out by cooling or deterioration, but I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d have 
a forensic scientist or doctor on hand for that, rather than get the 
agent to do it.
flight attendant - presumably arithmetic, making sure the correct 
number of passengers are on board, that there are sufficient meals, 
drinks etc. 
insurance agent - again, perhaps some statistics, although if the 
agent is the person who just sells the insurance, that may be less 
of a factor. At any rate, I imagine arithmetic at some level. 
journalist - persumably some arithmetic to work out percentages - 
e.g. the percentage of people out of work, the percentage of the 
popular support of candidate X etc., possibly something more 
advanced, depending on the type of journal (e.g. the Wall Street 
journal, or the Journal of Integral Equations will perhaps need a 
little extra)
landscape architect - similar to architect, I&#x27;d have thought, but 
perhaps different/less (or maybe no) emphasis on forces. Mainly 
geometry, would be my guess.
lawyer - statistics (and the manipulation thereof)
marketing researcher - see lawyer
lab technician - arithmetic (for measurements in preparing solutions 
and so forth), perhaps something more too (forces, on the safety 
side). I could perhaps check on this as I have a brother who is a 
scientist and has a lab technician.
religious order - probably depends on what the order is. Services 
need to be worked out for timing, the length of hymns plus the 
readings, plus the sermon should be roughly constant (equal to the 
service length), enough food/drink for sacrament are examples. Of 
course, there are some people who believe in numerology - e.g. Bible 
codes etc. - of course, the fact is that with a long enough text you 
are statistically likely to find similar &quot;codes&quot;, e.g. you could 
probably do the same thing with &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;, the Oxford 
English Dictionary, Journey To The West and so forth. People who do 
not realize this are more likely to be taken in by the notion of 
such a &quot;code&quot;.
musician - I am told that there is a link between mathematics and 
music, but not listening to music, I don&#x27;t know what it is. Perhaps 
something to do with rhythm. Also, the wave equation gives some kind 
of support to the spacing of notes, as I recall (though I don&#x27;t 
imagine many musicians use the wave equation). Bach is apparently 
quite mathematical, so that could be a start.
nurse (LPN) - I don&#x27;t know the difference between (LPN) and (RN) 
(local practice and registered would be my guess). I expect it is 
mainly to do with arithmetic (doses of medicine etc.)
nurse (RN) - see nurse (LPN)
optician - I can&#x27;t imagine that they use the inverse square law, but 
perhaps they do. The lens has to be shaped properly to bring the 
focal point to the correct place, but whether this is done by the 
optician or a technician (on instruction from the optician), I&#x27;m not 
sure.
optometrist - not sure what the difference is between this and 
optician
pharmacist - since it is preparation of medicine, I&#x27;d again guess 
that measurements/arithmetic are most important here. (I didn&#x27;t 
mention it above, but units are quite important in measuring.) 
physical therapist - Can&#x27;t recall there being any mathematics 
involved when I was getting physical therapy when I broke my elbow. 
I&#x27;d imagine it has to do with strain and stress and perhaps working 
out the level, amount and vigour of exercises in recovery 
(although, &quot;go to the level of pain and not beyond&quot; isn&#x27;t really 
mathematical)
physician - assuming this to take doctor and surgeon into account, 
I&#x27;d think arithmetic would be up there. Possibly also some calculus 
(in working out rate of cooling, rate of deterioration and other 
things).
physicist - it&#x27;s a very broad category; just about any field of 
applied mathematics, probably, and also calculus, complex analysis 
and geometry. I&#x27;m probably leaving out some stuff. 
plumber - I&#x27;d think that geometry and stress forces and measurements 
are what are required here. Probably not so much fluid mechanics and 
hydrodynamics (unless they are working on a huge structure, like a 
dam, but then they&#x27;d probably have a more fancy title)
police officer - presumably not much more than arithmetic
politician - statistics (to an extent) - see lawyer, counting (to 
see if they have won the vote)
professor - depends on the type of professor! Statistics is probably 
common to quite a few, arithmetic is surely known to all (these are 
probably also both used, especially if the professor has to teach 
(and doesn&#x27;t have a TA)). For a mathematics professor, rather more 
would be needed - it would be difficult to go into at any length.
psychologist - statistics, I&#x27;d imagine.
real estate agent - they need to be able to work with areas and 
count bathrooms, so some arithmetic and perhaps geometry (though the 
areas may be given to them)
salesperson - arithmetic, perhaps statistics (especially if sales 
are not on the shop floor but to firms or house to house)
secretary - probably depends on what they are a secretary for 
(arithmetic I imagine, but not necessarily any more)
social worker - presumably arithmetic and some statistics
statistician - statistics, calculus
teacher (K-12) - not certain what K-12 is, but I believe it is 
primary, in which case arithmetic, perhaps statistics, perhaps 
calculus, perhaps geometry and so forth (I&#x27;m not too familiar with 
US pre-university education)
travel agent - again, arithmetic (n people at $x with a y% discount 
and a z credit card surcharge +$w insurance etc.)
underwriter - this is again in the insurance/lawyer category so 
probably some smatterings from the mathematics used in those 
professions
veterinarian - I&#x27;d think that the mathematics required would be 
similar to that for a physician

<br>
1) Swap centers and U/D edges:<br>
   (Dd)R2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)R2 F2 R2 F2 R2 F2(Dd)R2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)<br>

This translates to a single, 35 move (HTM) solution, because the <br>
(D&#x27;d&#x27;) at the end of #1 and the (Dd) at the beginning of #2 cancel <br>
out.  Btw, for those who may want to know, #2 is an alg that handles <br>
both parity problems encountered on the 4x4x4 simultaneously by <br>
swapping two corners (UFR and DFR) and flipping one edge pair (FR).<br>

And it was pretty well lubed, definitely not in need of it. I have a

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
&gt; As for the last part, maybe I can hazard a guess as to where <br>
&gt; mathematics might be used in some of them (though many of them will <br>
&gt; not go very deeply into mathematics, i.e. even beyond arithmetic):<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; accountant - this should be fairly straightforward; probably <br>
&gt; arithmetic, percentages etc.<br>
&gt; actuary - statistics (they work in insurance, calculating <br>
&gt; probabilities of events, such as disasters etc.)<br>
&gt; airplane pilot - I&#x27;d imagine it has to do with bearings to an <br>
extent <br>
&gt; (though with auto-pilots, this is probably less of an issue these <br>
&gt; days) and possibly with manual control (on landing), though I&#x27;d <br>
&gt; imagine that very little is worked out mathematicallyin the usual <br>
&gt; sense here (perhpas mentally in the same way as a tennis player or <br>
a <br>
&gt; footballer or whatever will mentally work out the angle and power <br>
&gt; for the ball; it is very much on a subconscious level, if that is <br>
&gt; the case)<br>
&gt; architect - I&#x27;d imagine measurements, geometry, applied mathematics <br>
&gt; (forces, stress, gravity etc. must be accounted for), perhaps <br>
linear <br>
&gt; programming could be used to get feasible solutions to the stress <br>
&gt; problem<br>
&gt; auto-body repair person - I&#x27;m guessing that this is (the US term <br>
&gt; for) someone who repairs cars. Presumably again, things like stress <br>
&gt; and forces will come into it at some stage.<br>
&gt; bank teller - arithmetic, presumably<br>
&gt; bank officer - again arithmetic, maybe (depending on what officer <br>
&gt; is) some linear programming in order to figure out investments, <br>
&gt; statistics, some calculus e.g. partial differential equations (I&#x27;m <br>
&gt; thinking on the lines of investments here, where stuff with names <br>
&gt; like the Black-Scholes equation crop up)<br>
&gt; chef - principally arithmetic, I&#x27;d have thought, for ingredients<br>
&gt; computer programmer - algorithms, numerical analysis, geometry (for <br>
&gt; graphics), mechanics (e.g. simulating graphics in games). Depending <br>
&gt; on the nature of the programming there could be a whole load of <br>
&gt; other stuff - linear programming, matrix calculations come to mind <br>
&gt; for instance.<br>
&gt; computer technician - I&#x27;d imagine things like mechanics would come <br>
&gt; into it, if technician is design rather than repair, the physical <br>
&gt; volume will be important, so will cooling (heat equation perhaps?), <br>
&gt; efficient design of chips and so on.<br>
&gt; construction worker - all kinds of stuff connected to measurements <br>
&gt; and forces again<br>
&gt; counselor - not sure, at a guess some kind of statistics might be <br>
&gt; used<br>
&gt; dentist - to work out the appropriate amount of anaesthetic some <br>
&gt; arithmetic might be necessary, perhaps also counting teeth!<br>
&gt; dental assistant - to actually prepare the anaesthetic as per <br>
&gt; instruction, perhaps? (In the UK, all I&#x27;ve seen a dental assistant <br>
&gt; do is write down what the dentist tells them. I&#x27;m sure they do a <br>
lot <br>
&gt; more, but the part I&#x27;ve seen requires no mathematics.)<br>
&gt; economist - arithmetic, statistics, calculus e.g. partial <br>
&gt; differential equations<br>
&gt; electrical engineer - complex analysis, calculus<br>
&gt; electrician - perhaps some simple equations (I&#x27;m thinking on the <br>
&gt; lines of working out calculations with parallel/series circuits), <br>
&gt; but I&#x27;m not sure what else<br>
&gt; emergency medical technician - again, a good grasp of arithmetic. I <br>
&gt; imagine in an emergency, more complicated mathematics (if <br>
necessary) <br>
&gt; may have to be done by a machine for speed. <br>
&gt; FBI agent - not sure here; I can&#x27;t recall Dale Cooper using <br>
&gt; mathematics. Perhaps a certain level is expected just to be able to <br>
&gt; join the FBI (to ensure a level of proficiency, should the need <br>
&gt; arise). At the scene of a crime, the time of death might be <br>
possible <br>
&gt; to work out by cooling or deterioration, but I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d <br>
have <br>
&gt; a forensic scientist or doctor on hand for that, rather than get <br>
the <br>
&gt; agent to do it.<br>
&gt; flight attendant - presumably arithmetic, making sure the correct <br>
&gt; number of passengers are on board, that there are sufficient meals, <br>
&gt; drinks etc. <br>
&gt; insurance agent - again, perhaps some statistics, although if the <br>
&gt; agent is the person who just sells the insurance, that may be less <br>
&gt; of a factor. At any rate, I imagine arithmetic at some level. <br>
&gt; journalist - persumably some arithmetic to work out percentages - <br>
&gt; e.g. the percentage of people out of work, the percentage of the <br>
&gt; popular support of candidate X etc., possibly something more <br>
&gt; advanced, depending on the type of journal (e.g. the Wall Street <br>
&gt; journal, or the Journal of Integral Equations will perhaps need a <br>
&gt; little extra)<br>
&gt; landscape architect - similar to architect, I&#x27;d have thought, but <br>
&gt; perhaps different/less (or maybe no) emphasis on forces. Mainly <br>
&gt; geometry, would be my guess.<br>
&gt; lawyer - statistics (and the manipulation thereof)<br>
&gt; marketing researcher - see lawyer<br>
&gt; lab technician - arithmetic (for measurements in preparing <br>
solutions <br>
&gt; and so forth), perhaps something more too (forces, on the safety <br>
&gt; side). I could perhaps check on this as I have a brother who is a <br>
&gt; scientist and has a lab technician.<br>
&gt; religious order - probably depends on what the order is. Services <br>
&gt; need to be worked out for timing, the length of hymns plus the <br>
&gt; readings, plus the sermon should be roughly constant (equal to the <br>
&gt; service length), enough food/drink for sacrament are examples. Of <br>
&gt; course, there are some people who believe in numerology - e.g. <br>
Bible <br>
&gt; codes etc. - of course, the fact is that with a long enough text <br>
you <br>
&gt; are statistically likely to find similar &quot;codes&quot;, e.g. you could <br>
&gt; probably do the same thing with &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;, the Oxford <br>
&gt; English Dictionary, Journey To The West and so forth. People who do <br>
&gt; not realize this are more likely to be taken in by the notion of <br>
&gt; such a &quot;code&quot;.<br>
&gt; musician - I am told that there is a link between mathematics and <br>
&gt; music, but not listening to music, I don&#x27;t know what it is. Perhaps <br>
&gt; something to do with rhythm. Also, the wave equation gives some <br>
kind <br>
&gt; of support to the spacing of notes, as I recall (though I don&#x27;t <br>
&gt; imagine many musicians use the wave equation). Bach is apparently <br>
&gt; quite mathematical, so that could be a start.<br>
&gt; nurse (LPN) - I don&#x27;t know the difference between (LPN) and (RN) <br>
&gt; (local practice and registered would be my guess). I expect it is <br>
&gt; mainly to do with arithmetic (doses of medicine etc.)<br>
&gt; nurse (RN) - see nurse (LPN)<br>
&gt; optician - I can&#x27;t imagine that they use the inverse square law, <br>
but <br>
&gt; perhaps they do. The lens has to be shaped properly to bring the <br>
&gt; focal point to the correct place, but whether this is done by the <br>
&gt; optician or a technician (on instruction from the optician), I&#x27;m <br>
not <br>
&gt; sure.<br>
&gt; optometrist - not sure what the difference is between this and <br>
&gt; optician<br>
&gt; pharmacist - since it is preparation of medicine, I&#x27;d again guess <br>
&gt; that measurements/arithmetic are most important here. (I didn&#x27;t <br>
&gt; mention it above, but units are quite important in measuring.) <br>
&gt; physical therapist - Can&#x27;t recall there being any mathematics <br>
&gt; involved when I was getting physical therapy when I broke my elbow. <br>
&gt; I&#x27;d imagine it has to do with strain and stress and perhaps working <br>
&gt; out the level, amount and vigour of exercises in recovery <br>
&gt; (although, &quot;go to the level of pain and not beyond&quot; isn&#x27;t really <br>
&gt; mathematical)<br>
&gt; physician - assuming this to take doctor and surgeon into account, <br>
&gt; I&#x27;d think arithmetic would be up there. Possibly also some calculus <br>
&gt; (in working out rate of cooling, rate of deterioration and other <br>
&gt; things).<br>
&gt; physicist - it&#x27;s a very broad category; just about any field of <br>
&gt; applied mathematics, probably, and also calculus, complex analysis <br>
&gt; and geometry. I&#x27;m probably leaving out some stuff. <br>
&gt; plumber - I&#x27;d think that geometry and stress forces and <br>
measurements <br>
&gt; are what are required here. Probably not so much fluid mechanics <br>
and <br>
&gt; hydrodynamics (unless they are working on a huge structure, like a <br>
&gt; dam, but then they&#x27;d probably have a more fancy title)<br>
&gt; police officer - presumably not much more than arithmetic<br>
&gt; politician - statistics (to an extent) - see lawyer, counting (to <br>
&gt; see if they have won the vote)<br>
&gt; professor - depends on the type of professor! Statistics is <br>
probably <br>
&gt; common to quite a few, arithmetic is surely known to all (these are <br>
&gt; probably also both used, especially if the professor has to teach <br>
&gt; (and doesn&#x27;t have a TA)). For a mathematics professor, rather more <br>
&gt; would be needed - it would be difficult to go into at any length.<br>
&gt; psychologist - statistics, I&#x27;d imagine.<br>
&gt; real estate agent - they need to be able to work with areas and <br>
&gt; count bathrooms, so some arithmetic and perhaps geometry (though <br>
the <br>
&gt; areas may be given to them)<br>
&gt; salesperson - arithmetic, perhaps statistics (especially if sales <br>
&gt; are not on the shop floor but to firms or house to house)<br>
&gt; secretary - probably depends on what they are a secretary for <br>
&gt; (arithmetic I imagine, but not necessarily any more)<br>
&gt; social worker - presumably arithmetic and some statistics<br>
&gt; statistician - statistics, calculus<br>
&gt; teacher (K-12) - not certain what K-12 is, but I believe it is <br>
&gt; primary, in which case arithmetic, perhaps statistics, perhaps <br>
&gt; calculus, perhaps geometry and so forth (I&#x27;m not too familiar with <br>
&gt; US pre-university education)<br>
&gt; travel agent - again, arithmetic (n people at $x with a y% discount <br>
&gt; and a z credit card surcharge +$w insurance etc.)<br>
&gt; underwriter - this is again in the insurance/lawyer category so <br>
&gt; probably some smatterings from the mathematics used in those <br>
&gt; professions<br>
&gt; veterinarian - I&#x27;d think that the mathematics required would be <br>
&gt; similar to that for a physician<br>
<br>
Wow, that&#x27;s a lot! Thanks, that&#x27;ll definitely be something I can use <br>
for my report. :D <br>
<br>
As for my contact, thanks, Duncan, for your help. I will e-mail you <br>
the questionnaire by Friday.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

I really haven&#x27;t had the time to finish the whole 5x5...I don&#x27;t think <br>
I can untill all the tests are done and I&#x27;m out of homework heaven. <br>
LOL. Thank you for your advice on memorization. I certainly hope to <br>
be able to do this asap.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson
 
To be &quot;official&quot; you&#x27;d need a third party judge and to follow the guidelines
that were set in Toronto which can be viewed at  rubikschamps.com. The
Guinness Book of Records can be contacted via their web-site and will send
you downloadable forms to fill out for any new record(s) they only publish
3x3 and blindfold records at the moment.
 
If you wanted &quot;sponsorship&quot;you would need to contact the USA distribution
companies &quot;Hasbro&quot; and &quot;Winning Moves&quot; :
The details are at rubiks.com.
 
There are plans for a 2005 &quot;official&quot; 25th Anniversary championship in
Orlando, Florida and there will be a European Championship in August in
Amsterdam. Dates for both will be confirmed in February.
 
Good luck!

Hey everyone again,

I know this is really far away, but I was thinking... there isn&#x27;t going to
be an official 
tournament for the Rubik&#x27;s Cube in the United States this year and it&#x27;d be
really nice 
to have one.  Who do I need to talk to in order to make a tournament
official.  Do I 
need some sort of sponsorship/licensing from Hessport or something?  And
what 
makes a tournament official such that a record will be accepted as &quot;a

Basically, I envision an official united states championship held in the
summer.  With 
all of your support, I think this would be very much a possibility.

that&#x27;s a great little game...i think it might be fun to have a few 
more patterns, then print them up on some cards...game to go.

one little thing: i noticed a few times that highlighted cubes 
wouldn&#x27;t &quot;cover up&quot; again...made it kind of easy if they stayed 
exposed...obviously not intended

but again, liked the game

          <div class="email-content">Greetings Everyone,<br>
<br>
As many of you know a speed solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube tournament was held<br>
on Saturday 1/24/2004 at Caltech. They used the same stackmat timers<br>
which were used in the WC2003 in Toronto.<br>
<br>
Macky won with the middle 3 of 5 average of 16.53 seconds.<br>
<br>
His slowest solve of the final 5 scrambles was 18.05 which is two full<br>
seconds faster than the average of the present &quot;official&quot; World&#x27;s record.<br>
<br>
Macky&#x27;s time in the &quot;Champion&#x27;s Solve&quot; right after the winner was<br>
declared was 12.28 sconds.<br>
<br>
If you want to compare your time to his 12.28, here&#x27;s that scramble:<br>
<br>
F2 R2 D L R B&#x27; F D&#x27; B R2 D2 L D L R&#x27; F&#x27; B2 D U R2 D&#x27; R B2 L&#x27; D2<br>
<br>
Good Luck!<br>

I already tried to post this. Sorry if it should appear twice :-(

I left my algbuilding scribblings at home, but instead i came up with 
an ever better solution :

=====
(Dd)R2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)R2F2R2F2(Dd)B2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)B2(Uu)B2(U&#x27;u&#x27;)B2R2(U&#x27;u&#x27;)F2 : (25-htm)
=====

I found this by working ur solution backwards, and spotted at one 
point all that was needed was a simple swap of 2 (2x3) blocks, which 
is easily done normally ;-)

I have left my alg-building scribblings at home, but i came up with a 
much improved solution ... Here it is :

=====

=====

This one i found by working ur alg backwards towards solved. At one 
point in ur alg i spotted i simply had to interchange 2 (2x3) blocks, 
which is fairly easy :D

I believe this one should be hard to beat ;-)

wanted to use your cube so I scrambled your cube the same way and in the process, 
Macky solved his own cube so he had already seen it... and I think he mentioned he 
got lucky because on of the pairs was already in place.  The 14.76 was really really 
impressive though.  Macky opened the competition with a 15.07 which really did set a 
good tone for his performance... not to mention the tone of the crowd cheering!

Hey, I&#x27;m having pairty problems with my 4x4x4.  I&#x27;ll check this group for prior 
discussions on this but does anyone have the algorithms off hand?

&gt; musician - I am told that there is a link between mathematics and <br>
&gt; music, but not listening to music, I don&#x27;t know what it is. Perhaps <br>
&gt; something to do with rhythm. Also, the wave equation gives some kind <br>
&gt; of support to the spacing of notes, as I recall (though I don&#x27;t <br>
&gt; imagine many musicians use the wave equation). Bach is apparently <br>
&gt; quite mathematical, so that could be a start.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard &quot;Doh ray me, it&#x27;s easy as 1 2 3&quot;.<br>
<br>
Bach is famous for melodies like this:<br>
<br>
878456767345656234545123... which is very mathematical but sounds<br>
beautiful. These numbers are second nature to musicians.<br>
<br>
Rhythm is based on different measures of notes: a full note, a half<br>
note, a quarter note. or even a 3rd.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
You want to play 1-2-3 | 1-2-3 | ... repeating bars with your left hand<br>
And play 1-2-3-4 | 1-2-3-4 | ... repeating bars with your right hand.<br>
The bar length is common to both hands. If a musician wants to learn to<br>
play this accurately, he/she must use mathematics.<br>
<br>
With the left hand, each beat is 1/3, and in the right hand each beat is<br>
1/4. The lowest common demoninator is 12. So you need to think of the<br>
left hand as 4/12 and the right hand as 3/12.<br>
<br>
The combined rhythm with L=left hit and R=right hit is:<br>
<br>
L...L...L... | L...L...L... | etc.<br>
R..R..R..R.. | R..R..R..R.. | etc.<br>

The new records (Jess, Dan, Dror etc) are submitted to Guinness, they

Hi Jessica
 
There will definitely be a 2005 Championship. I saw the Disney Pop Century
Resort last week and it&#x27;s a great venue, they will give us a good deal
(rooms plus free rides etc) so I&#x27;m working on it and hope to confirm next
month after I&#x27;ve met with the US distributors (who would support the event
financially).
 
So.. it&#x27;s looking good and you shouldn&#x27;t have to wait until 2024!
 
Best wishes

thank you for your note. I was unaware of this. So, I assume the 
championship will take place in Florida? Who will be the event 
organizer? Seven Towns?

P.S.: My apology if this has been discussed here before. Recently, I 
have not been checking this site too frequently.

Need some advice on some drills or techniques to avoid getting <br>

everything together, and then try again.  Triggers and macros won&#x27;t <br>

&gt; Hey, I&#x27;m having pairty problems with my 4x4x4.  I&#x27;ll check this<br>
&gt; group for prior discussions on this but does anyone have the<br>
&gt; algorithms off hand?<br>
<br>
I just gave one in the discussion on the 4x4x4 restickering problem <br>
that addresses both parity problems simultaneously by swapping UFR <br>
and DFR and flipping FR:<br>
1)(Dd)F2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)F2(Dd)R2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)R2(Dd)L2(Dd)L2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)L2 R2 F2<br>
<br>
This is probably more easily performed with a different cube <br>
orientation and/or using the opposite slice, on occassion...  Try one <br>
of these:<br>
2)(Rr)U2(R&#x27;r&#x27;)U2(Ll)U2(R&#x27;r&#x27;)U2(Rr)D2(Rr)D2(R&#x27;r&#x27;)y&#x27;U2D2R2 (Flips UB)<br>
3)(R&#x27;r&#x27;)U2(Rr)U2(L&#x27;l&#x27;)U2(Rr)U2(R&#x27;r&#x27;)D2(R&#x27;r&#x27;)D2(Rr)yU2D2R2 (Flips UF)<br>
4)(Uu)R2(U&#x27;u&#x27;)R2(Dd)R2(U&#x27;u&#x27;)R2(Uu)L2(Uu)L2(U&#x27;u&#x27;)yxU2D2R2 (Flips FR)<br>
<br>
Anyways... Then there are also the two standarad algs to fix just one <br>
of the two parity problems at a time:<br>
5)r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 (Flips UF)<br>
6)r2 U2 r2 (U2u2) r2 u2<br>
<br>
You can do #5 with either r and l slices only (flips only UF) or with <br>
r/l slices and R/L faces (flips UF, swaps UL/UR, swaps UFR/UFL and <br>
reorients UFR/UFL).  Note that #1 and it&#x27;s variations (#2-#4) address <br>
both parity problems and as such is not appropriate for odd order <br>
cubes (e.g. 5x5x5).<br>

Sorry for such a basic question.. I bought a cube from Walmart for <br>

this an Oddzon cube?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve read some disrecommendations for speedcubing, but is it possible <br>
to make one into a &quot;close-enough&quot; speedcube for a beginner?  I&#x27;ve <br>
lubed it with silicon lubricant and it&#x27;s better.  I&#x27;m not really <br>
having good luck stretching the springs, but I&#x27;m probably just not <br>
trying hard enough.<br>
<br>
My times are around 1:06 on average, so &quot;close-enough&quot; should<br>
probably do me for a while, right?  :)<br>

Excellent.  Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to do something when you know it&#x27;s
possible.  :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

   Perhaps you are right. 

   Did he solve it the same way the second time? Did you try solving
that scramble more than once? Give a try and record your time.

   Anyone can try this. I&#x27;m not talking about doing it several times
slowly first to find the easiest solve and to practice, I mean just
scramble, 15 second look, and solve. Do it with the scrambles used in
the competition, go down the line and do each one twice.

   What percentage of the time were you actually slower the second time?

David

          <div class="email-content">I find the difference between an Oddzon and a Studio cube when you 
don&#x27;t adjust the screws is negligible.  A Studio breaks in a little 
faster from what I&#x27;ve seen unless you adjust the screws to 
compensate.  My best speed cube now is an Oddzon (still fixing up my 
studios) and I can pull sub-20 averages on it pretty frequently, so 
it is possible even to get sub-20 on an Oddzon.  Oddzons take more 
work to break in, but once they do I find them quite nice.

Also, if you have any interest whatsoever in one-handed speedcubing 
then save your Oddzon once it &quot;wears out&quot;.  &quot;Worn out&quot; Oddzons make 
EXCELLENT one-handed speedcubes :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Howard,

   On technique is over- or under-rotating.
   Suppose you are turning U  if you under-rotate it a little bit a
following move like R can lock up, but R&#x27; won&#x27;t. If you over-rotate U
then R&#x27; may lock up but R won&#x27;t.

   Also if it starts to lock up you can reverse the move for a moment
to align it better. This might not be quick in the middle of a finger
trick.

   Practicing slowly for over- and under-rotating can also increase
your accuracy in turning, so that eventually everything lines up
correctly and there are no lock ups.

Regards,

David J

You know on old cubes it says something like, &quot;3 billion possible

Actually, it is rather closer to saying that the world has no people 
in it.

3000000000*6000000000/3^7*2^10*8!*12! is approximately 0.42 (2 
decimal places) which is less than 0.5, so it&#x27;s 0 to the nearest 
integer.
That assumes there are really 6 billion people in the world, which 
is an underestimate, but even if we assume there are 7 billion 
people in the world (an overestimate) we find that 
3000000000*7000000000/3^7*2^10*8!*12! is approximately 0.49 (2 
decimal places) which is less than 0.5, so it&#x27;s 0 to the nearest 
integer.

Might be?? You missed out leap days by the way (not that it makes 
much difference).

You may wish to know that 6 weeks contains exactly 10! seconds 
(something which occurred to me as my waking thought one morning 
several years ago - very strange). This is a surprisingly small 
number of weeks to contain a number of seconds exactly equal to n! 
for some n, but it does mean that if your CD only comprised 10 
tracks each lasting 1 second then you could get through it in 6 
weeks. Actually, you could get through it much quicker than this 
(depending on exactly what you mean). I also believe that it would 
not take 400 years to get through all the tracks but far less than 
this.

Thus for a 4 track CD, rather than taking 24 hours you could cut it 
like this:

1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 4 2 3 1 2 4 3 1 2 4 1 3 2 4 1 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 3 4 2 1 
3 4 2 1 3

This would take only 9.75 hours (and is probably not optimal, but I 
can&#x27;t remember the name for this sort of thing so I can&#x27;t look up an 
algorithm for it) and you&#x27;d hear all possible orderings of the 
tracks.

Thanks, that&#x27;s indeed a nice observation :-)<br>
<br>
&gt; Thus for a 4 track CD, rather than taking 24 hours you could cut <br>
it <br>

listening to the whole CD in one ordering, then listen to the whole <br>

That sounds right, except that their definition is more general (it 
would insist that subsequences like 1 1 1 1 occur, whereas we only 
need to collect all the subsequences of length 4 where each entry is 
distinct, so that we don&#x27;t need to get all subsequences with repeats 
(although there will be some repeating, of necessity. e.g. 1 2 3 1 
above.)

Sounds like a neat idea, if not hard to implement.  I&#x27;m just a newbie, 
but I can see one thing that it wouldn&#x27;t account for that current 
timing systems do.  One thing I find as a newbie is that I&#x27;ll 
sometimes solve the cube before I&#x27;m supposed to - a lucky case.  But, 
it&#x27;ll take me a second to realize it&#x27;s solved.  I think that one 
second should be counted in the time.

JMHO..  :)

Heh... that&#x27;s kinda funny.  I can&#x27;t wait to see everyone showing up 
at the next WC handcuffed to small briefcases.  Someone will 
certainly open up a Rubik&#x27;s chop shop to pawn stolen cubies into the 
black market.

Thanks for the replies by the way.  :)

I think all this could be solved simply by wearing the cube on a chain
around one&#x27;s neck, taking it out occasionally, petting it, and calling
it, &quot;My Precious.&quot;

Nice idea!
Please try to make one, but also let it record the moves to solve the cube. Then
we can decide afterwards whether someone had a lucky case (and not recognize it
as a world record). ;-)
I will buy one from you for $500.

Have fun,

Does anybody in this group have experience with this? I thought I&#x27;d <br>
download it and see if I could move onto my machine, rather than use <br>
CubeExplorer on my dad&#x27;s, so I went and got myself a new operating <br>
system. It isn&#x27;t clear to me that it actually does optimal solving <br>
though - i.e. if it does, what does it - or indeed if it is as easy <br>
to enter a position as in CE (where one can generate a text file and <br>
load it in).<br>

   Thanks for repeating my idea, which I posted last September:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/6564

   The simplest thing would be contacts between cubies which when the
cube is solved, and only when the cube is solved, completes a circuit
which can send out a signal

   Thanks again,

And if you as the last move do an incorrect H move instead of a Q move, it will still be counted as correct.

   Depends entirely on the box.

   I thought you were serious. As jokes go that&#x27;s ancient.

   So you get to school, and go to the bike rack and lock up your
bike, then you go to the cube rack and lock up your cube. Oh, I
suppose you could chain it to your ankle. (?)

Daniel Henage was very nice and has helped me host some videos.  When I have some 
time, I&#x27;ll figure out which video is which solve but for now... here you go.

http://www.henage.net/dan/cube/index.htm

I do know that the one where Macky says &quot;yes&quot; at the end is the 14.76 seconds.

It&#x27;s quite unfortunate that the records aren&#x27;t official.  I&#x27;m not so sure who to talk to in 
order to get the records there.

I&#x27;ve been e-mail around... I&#x27;m working on making the tournaments at Caltech official.  
We need to set up something like the US Chess Federation does wich official 
tournaments and ratings and... well, you get the idea.  Would we get sued if we set 
this up without licensing?

I also have a software for 3x3x3 cube, the CubixPlayer that can be 
found in the file section of this group. For now it only measures in 
1/10 th second. It has quite a few scrambling/preview/timing features 
and a nice hiscore list of ur best times. There still remains lots to 
be done on it. And i would really like to extend it to larger cubes, 
and also allow &quot;super-supercubing&quot; with it. By that i mean to 
completely solve all cubicles, be it external or internal :D An easy 
solution to that would be lots and lots of 3 cycles and solve 
from &quot;inside out&quot; to be sure to keep all solved internal cubicles, 
but there might be more efficent methods to solve it also ;-)

--Per K--

PS! The time will start to run either when preinspection time has run 
out, or if u specify u want to allow early start it will start the 
time after ur first move during preinspection :-) And time stops when 
it&#x27;s solved, regardless of physical orientation of the cube ...

          <div class="email-content">You guys seem to be trying to say that Stefan is wrong. He is not. Here is the math.
There are 10 tracks that can go first, 9 that can go second... hence 10! or 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 which is 3628800, which is the number of combinations possible and the numer of hours it would take. divide by 24 to get days, then 365.25 (approximate number of days in a year, accounting for leap year) to get the number of years.

Recently I realized something after a friend asked me about it: The 
vast majority of possible cube states has never appeared on any cube 
anywhere on the world. It surprised him a lot and I must say it 
surprised me as well.

I had read a few times that it would take you more time to go 
through all states than the age of the universe, but since I haven&#x27;t 
been around that long I can&#x27;t get a feeling for this so I found 
my &quot;new&quot; (I can&#x27;t be the first one) discovery much more impressive.

For the calculation we assumed:
- All mankind (6 billion people) has got cubes.
- All mankind has not done anything but cubing since the cube has 
been invented (30 years).
- Each and every person made one move per second.
- There were no duplicate states anywhere anytime.

This results in 6000000000*30*365*24*60*60 = 5676480000000000000 
states that have appeared sometime on some cube somewhere. That&#x27;s 
about 13% of all possible (and valid) cube states. And remember, 
some of our assumptions might be slightly exaggerated.

Similarly surprising (at least for me), you have no chance to listen 
to a one-hour cd containing 
just ten tracks in all orders (because that would take more than 400 
years of non-stop listening). You could barely make it with a nine 
track cd but you&#x27;d better be young, start right now and never stop 
(assuming you sometimes wanna sleep and can&#x27;t listen while sleeping).

Cheers!
Stefan

I am familiar with the mathematics - what I am saying is that it 
takes less than 400 years to listen to all possible orders of the 
tracks. If you insist that the orderings do not overlap then it 
certainly does take over 400 years, but if you allow overlapping 
then it will not. This is quite evident; see the earlier post on 
what happens with a 4 track CD for example. The time saving there is 
quite large. Here are some other examples for 2 and 3 track CDs:

2 track

1 2 1 - total time 1.5 hours (0.5 hours less than the 2 hours of 1 2 
2 1)

3 track

1 2 3 1 2 1 3 2 1 - total time 3 hours (3 hours less than the 6 
hours of 1 2 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 2 1)

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve recently gotten very into supercubing of all <br>
sizes of cubes (3x3x3 through 5x5x5) and I wanted to post a message <br>
about it to try to get others into this!  At first I wasn&#x27;t <br>
especially fond of supercubing, nothing about it interested me <br>
really.  However recently since I started thinking about the <br>
supercube on my own, and how that would change the solving strategy, <br>
I got really into it.  Plus you can check out Per Kristen Fredlund&#x27;s <br>
posts about some of the theory and especially the center flip <br>
algorithm list, which is very helpful!  Of course it&#x27;s a little <br>
weird at first because all the times you are used to for each size <br>
are way too fast for your supercube goals, but after some practice <br>
it is a lot of fun.  You start to really develop a feel for how the <br>
larger cubes work when you supercube them.  One thing that surprised <br>
me is that solving the centers &quot;incorrectly&quot; does NOT cause the <br>
4x4x4 orientation parity, it still occurs on a super 4x4x4.  You can <br>
have the centers solved according to definition but still encounter <br>
the orientation parity.  So aaaaaaaanyway Mr. Fredlund issued a <br>
challenge on the 3x3x3 super cube average list for people to pick up <br>
supercubing, and I do the same!  Let&#x27;s get some competition going on <br>
the supercube lists.<br>
<br>
Think about it, we&#x27;re only solving half the problem when we <br>
speedcube, solving with the center orientation mattering only makes <br>
it MORE of a puzzle.  You have to work harder during the F2L, change <br>
some of your LL algorithms and strategies, so in my opinion it is <br>
more fun!  Not to mention supercubing with no inspection!  I use a <br>
completely different strategy for my no inspection solves during the <br>
F2L than for my normal averages.  For the normal 3x3x3 you can use <br>
the same strategy for both, but it doesn&#x27;t quite work on the super <br>
cube.  I mean come on, how cool is that? :)<br>
<br>
Give it a try!  It may seem weird at first, I thought so, but once <br>
you try it a few times you get hooked!<br>
<br>
So from me and Mr. Fredlund, we challenge other speedcubers to try <br>
supercubing and see what you think :)  It is actually a lot of fun, <br>
and I really do recommend just trying it once.  Just to try it you <br>
can place some scotch tape over the centers of your 3x3x3 and draw <br>
arrows on them, that way you can remove the tape if you don&#x27;t like <br>
it.<br>
<br>
Happy cubing,<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  I didn&#x27;t even mention anything about blindfolded supercubing, <br>
but I have to say it is awesome!  The best I&#x27;ve gotten so far is all <br>
the corners and edges solved and the centers all flipped correctly <br>
except for one flipped twice.  If you like blindfolded cubing, then <br>
try blindfolded supercubing, it is much more intense and in my <br>
opinion a lot more fun.<br>

It takes about 7 years for the best to become an expert in the chess <br>

variety of record.<br>

Very fun indeed.  This is the shortest I could find (in this case
for F-):

   D+ U+ L2 R2 D- U- B- D- U- L2 R2 D+ U+

(that&#x27;s 13 moves).

Don&#x27;t know about the diameter, but off hand, if you had to restrict
the set of moves (from the 18 possible) to a maximum of 5, which would
give the highest diameter?  You&#x27;d probably want to have all
double-twists, with only a few (or one) single-twists.  Is the set U2
F2 R D2 B2 sufficient to solve any cube?  I think it&#x27;s pretty easy to
prove that you need at least three single-twists in there, so is the
set U F R D2 B2 sufficient to solve any cube?

You can emulate D with the following sequence of moves :

I&#x27;ve only tried blindfold 3x3x3 supercubing so far - I&#x27;m going to 
try 4x4x4 after I get 3+3+4+5 done. 3x3x3 isn&#x27;t really so difficult 
as almost all the moves I use in my normal method preserve the 
centre orientation (edge 3-cycles and twisting 3 corners don&#x27;t but 
if I do the inverse of the edge 3-cycle twice that does and it has 
the same effect (in the usual group) as the intended 3-cycle). Thus, 
blindfold supercubing can be done fairly easily by just correcting 
all the centres at the start or at the end. 4x4x4 is more 
interesting. I&#x27;d need to paint my cube first and use a different 
labelling for my centers (as currently, of course, I don&#x27;t 
distinguish centers of the same colour).
In BCFSSS, and even in BCFTSS, each algorithm comes with a 
description of its effect on the centres, so that if learned in full 
it can be used as a supercubing system.

In some sense, the 3x3x3 supergroup isn&#x27;t really a supergroup. 
Rather the usual group is isomorphic to a quotient group (instead of 
a subgroup) of the larger group.

I&#x27;m curious about the diameter of the cube with just the 2 
generators:

UBLUL&#x27;U&#x27;B&#x27;

R^2FLD&#x27;R&#x27;

(see http://web.usna.navy.mil/~wdj/sm485_11.txt)

Clearly this is a minimal generating set as the cube group is not 
Abelian.

The supergroup needs 6 generators (and clearly 6 is sufficient, 
namely U, D, F, B, R and L) as can be seen by the fact that if the 
action of 5 generators on the centres is considered then the 
generators commute and, since each has order dividing 4 (in terms of 
their effect on the centres) only 1024 possible orientations of the 
centres can occur (whereas there should be 2048 for the supergroup).

   At the end of the hundred meter dash would you have the runners
drop to the ground and place their hands on the stackmat instead of
having their times stop when they reach the end of the 100 meters?

   All tolled, the stackmat is a reasonable timer. Takes a little

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

Yes let&#x27;s all start supercubing :D 

Well, my strategy for speedsupercubing is first normal solve, then 
orient all the centers (3,4 or 5 algs that are all very fast to 
perform). But when i solve wrt number of moves it&#x27;s a different 
story. It&#x27;s difficult to describe in detail how that is done. But 
here are some clues :

1: Solve first layer edges while also orienting 5 of the facecenters, 
the facecenter of first layer and also all adjacent faces to that 
layer. (eg orient U,F,R,B and L facecenters, where U is ur first 
layer to solve)

2: Solve 3 middle layer edges while trying to solve &quot;cheaply&quot; some of 
first layer corners. (avoid difficult cases for step 3+4)

3: Solve remaining edges such that last facecenter is oriented 
correctly.

4: Apply some 3 cycles on remaining corners and it&#x27;s done :-)

For each of the steps try to &quot;get more than u are bargaining for&quot;, 
and also try to make ur remaining steps easier. This is where u can 
save lots of moves with more practice :-)

I&#x27;m down to best average of about 53 moves for supercubing.

          <div class="email-content">Here are also some strategies for supercubing that I have found 
useful.  I&#x27;m still tweaking my method, but I have found this 
strategy to be good enough to keep.

When solving and I am allowed to inspect the cube I try to find the 
best way to solve the cross and also orient the first five centers 
at the same time.  In the 15 seconds it is often not possible to 
plan the whole cross, so I try to plan orienting correctly the 
center of the first layer and placing at least 2 edges, while also 
orienting their centers.  While I am performing the moves to solve 
those first two edges with their centers I am looking ahead on the 
other centers and edges and I try to place them after the first two 
so that their centers are oriented correctly.

At this point you can solve the F2L normally, only be very careful 
with empty slot algorithms, as they tend to flip the centers of the 
side faces or the first layer.

Once I&#x27;ve finished the F2L there is a fairly decent chance that I 
have flipped at least one center in the middle, though this doesn&#x27;t 
always happen.  I then solve the LL normally, OLL and PLL.  The OLLs 
don&#x27;t always flip centers in the middle but sometimes they do.  The 
PLL tend to flip the centers, so start to go through your algs and 
see how they do, so you can predict the outcome of the center flips 
after you have finished the PLL.  While you are performing the PLL, 
look ahead and judge how all the centers will be oriented.  If you 
solve the F2L carefully, and try to avoid empty slot cases and any 
other cases that flip centers, then it is most likely that you only 
have two centers to flip correctly.  At this point perform the 
center flip alg as fast as you can :)  It also happens fairly often 
that you don&#x27;t have to flip centers in the end, if you can take 
advantage of knowing how your PLLs flip centers.  Say my permutation 
case is an edge 3 cycle, and I know that I have flipped one of the 
side (F2L) centers twice.  If I notice that the U center is also 
flipped twice I can turn the top layer so that the side center and 
the U center line up in such a way that performing the edge 3 cycle 
(which flips two adjacent centers twice) will solve both centers as 
well.

For solving with no inspection the strategy stays the same except 
for the F2L.  First solve the cross as fast as possible (just like 
in a normal 3x3x3 no inspection solve), but make sure you solve the 
pieces around the first layer center correctly.  On inserting the 
last edge, first line it up with its center and then move it to the 
U layer (I solve cross on bottom), so that a double turn will return 
it to the first layer and also have the center flipped correctly.  
Now use the empty slot created on the D layer by your missing cross 
piece to flip the other side face centers.  So for example say my 
last cross piece is on the R face, and I have it lined up with the 
center such that an R2 move will solve the edge into the cross and 
line up the center correctly.  To flip the other centers just do the 
move d then R, R&#x27;, or R2 to flip the F face center (now moved to the 
R face) correctly.  After flipping the center do d again and now the 
L face center ends up on the R face, turn the R face so that the 
center lines up, do d again, etc.

This saves time from trying to solve the cross so that all the cross 
pieces solve, and the first 5 centers solve as well.

I&#x27;m still debating whether or not it would be faster after 
completing the OLL to correctly orient the U layer center and then 
use corner and edge cycles that don&#x27;t affect the center to return 
the U layer pieces to their correct spots, or to just use a PLL alg, 
then flip two centers at the end.  I assume if you were to get very 
serious about supercubing, that you would do the first and just have 
lots of specialized algs for each U layer case.

Heh heh so yeah, that was a long post.  But there are the strategies 
I use for speed supercubing.

Those are all strategies for speedsolving the supercube if i get it 
correct? Chris, what is ur strategy for solving in as few moves as 
possible?

   I use the non-oil based silcone lubricant from 3M. It works well.
   The best lube is graphite, but it doesn&#x27;t stay in the cube.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, so I get an invite to go to a local card shop by a<br>
good friend who claims to have taken an interest in<br>
cubing....he says he has some good friends who are<br>
into it and they all wanna compete. Well guess what,<br>
it was all a very intricate scheme that was meant to<br>
make fun of how seriously I take my hobby of cubing. <br>
<br>
Now here&#x27;s my confusion:<br>
<br>
1. when your subject follows a pattern youve surmised<br>
is plausible due to certain conditions...why is it<br>
that the subject is projected with the ochestrator&#x27;s<br>
stupidity? Whats intelligent and clever about setting<br>
someone up and having them act in a way that makes<br>
logical sense? and...<br>
<br>
2.Why the hell would a good friend do this to me?<br>
<br>
Oh well, I played cards and beat a couple of people<br>
and showed a few people my cubing skill...all in all<br>
it was a fun night, without ignorant backstabbing<br>
friends ^_^<br>
<br>
Im not angry, just confused...<br>
=K=<br>
<br>
P.S. anyone else have a similar experience?<br>

The competition was a great experience for me. It was nice meeting <br>
Lars, Kenneth, David, and all other cubists at the competition. My <br>
times actually came out better than I thought they were going to be. <br>
Much thanks go to Tyson and others for organizing the competition. It <br>
was an awesome cubing condition, with good lighting, cola, close <br>
bathroom and everything. lol. I think you guys really took good <br>
control. I&#x27;d definitely like more of these local competitions. And <br>
next time, maybe we can make things official. <br>

I would DEFINATELY be very interested.  As long as it doesn&#x27;t 
conflict with my teaching schedule (or Leafs playoffs) I would be 
there - so anytime in the summer is beauty.  It would be awesome to 
convene the Canadian cubers.  At RWC I met tons of great people from 
all over the world but ironically only a few Canadians (though 
several were there - I just didn&#x27;t meet them).  It&#x27;s been a couple 
of years since I was last in Montreal and this would be a 
perfect &#x27;excuse&#x27; for another roadtrip to a great and fun city.  
Hopefully there would be several categories offered - 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 
blindfold...

Please keep me informed of any developments

Rob

robbutler@...


P.S. - if any of the cubers in the Toronto area want to get together 
sometime for a cube day...

I am Japanese, and I am going to Australia, Brisbane, to study <br>

And I wanna know there are any Aussie speed cubists in this e-group <br>

Because I don&#x27;t hear the Aussie speed cubists&#x27; news in Japan.<br>
So I don&#x27;t have any informations about Rubik&#x27;s Cube in Australia.<br>

Btw, my average of 10 record is 18.27, but I have been so busy in <br>

<br>
  Hey everyone.  I was wondering if anyone else has gotten into <br>
  cupstacking (http://www.speedstacks.com)?  I find it parallels <br>
  speedcubing in many aspects.  Anyone else do this?  Perhaps some <br>
  friendly competition among us cup stackers could help us better our <br>
  times?  Am I the only weird guy who does this?<br>
<br>
  Looking for others who share the same non-cube hobby,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I&#x27;ve been wondering about this. I&#x27;m getting about 5-10 messages 
a day that all have attatchments, I opened one (not the attatchemt) 
and recognized a few names from this group.  Anyway, these all go to 
my &#x27;Bulk&#x27; email box (those who actually use the yahoo.com email know 
what I&#x27;m talking about), but today, 2 of &#x27;em made it into my real 
inbox... I&#x27;m getting a little worried b/c of the quantities I get 
these things in.  

How many of these &quot;emails&quot; have you guys been getting?

If you can get 38 seconds you don&#x27;t need any help! That&#x27;s a

          <div class="email-content">Some simple &quot;Cube-Math&quot; follows ;-)

What i want to explain is the maths behind constructing a 3-cycle. 
Those who already know may hit the Back-button of the browser :D

First step is to find a way to change some part of the cube. On a 
3x3x3 cube u want usually to have that change on a single layer or 2 
adjacent layers (say top and middle layer). Now lets say that the alg 
to achieve this is : A   And say u can rotate the single layer where 
the change occured with the alg : B  An easy example of this is to 
start from a solved 3x3x3 cube, then apply : R&#x27;DR   This affects one 
corner of the U-layer of the cube. So R&#x27;DR = A in this case. One can 
also easily rotate the U-layer with for instance : U   So in this 
case U = B. Now back to making the 3-cycle which is what we try to 
do :D We have already applied R&#x27;DRU (=AB) to the cube. A 3 cycle is 
now made by applying A&#x27; (inverse of A) and B&#x27; (inverse of B). In our 
case we apply R&#x27;D&#x27;R and U&#x27;. So the whole sequence of moves will be : 
R&#x27;DRUR&#x27;D&#x27;RU&#x27; (=ABA&#x27;B&#x27;). What we have actually done is to make a 
commutator (in group theoretical terms). What we made was a corner 3-
cycle since A changed one corner on the U-layer.

Now, how can we construct a 3-cycle on the edges? Replace A with the 
following alg : R&#x27;UsF  And let B=U like before. To make up our 
commutator (ABA&#x27;B&#x27;) we have to add a sequence like this: UF&#x27;U&#x27;sRU&#x27; 
(=BA&#x27;B&#x27;) The complete 3-cycle alg is thus like this : R&#x27;UsFUF&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;. 

Another way to denote a commutator is like this : [A,B] (=ABA&#x27;B&#x27;) For 
our last 3-cycle on edges we can write instead : [R&#x27;UsF,U]  Quite a 
nice way to write 10 moves on the cube :D

Now instead of only changing a single cubicle (a corner or an edge) 
we can of course change a &quot;block&quot; 2x1, an edge-corner pair. Let 
A=R&#x27;UF and B=U. Now ABA&#x27;B&#x27;=[R&#x27;UF,U]=R&#x27;UFUF&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;. Again we got a 3-
cycle, strange enough! Hehe ... 

Next i will adopt some notation from larger cubes than 3x3x3 to 
explore other possibleways of making 3-cycles. Let A=R&#x27;DR  The same 
we had for the first corner 3-cycle!!! Instead of having B=U now let 
B=(Uu) ie moving top 2 layers clockwise while bottom layer stays put. 
Notationally it seems that B is 3 moves but in reality it is 1 move 
only. ABA&#x27;B&#x27;=[A,B]=R&#x27;DR(Uu)R&#x27;D&#x27;R(U&#x27;u&#x27;). This can be rewritten like 
this : R&#x27;DRDB&#x27;DBD&#x27;. Again we have a 3-cycle on an edge-corner pair.

For larger cubes we have much more variation in making 3-cycles like 
this. We can make corner 3-cycle, edge 3-cycle, facecenter 3-cycle 
and 3 cycles on &quot;blocks&quot; like 3x1, 2x2, 3x2, 2x2x2 and even 2x2x3. I 
leave it as an exercise to work that out. It is great fun and useful 
for making of certain kinds of pretty patterns and more ...

Happy cycling :-P

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone.  I tried solving the Rubik&#x27;s cube in front of a <br>
mirror.  It is amazingly difficult.  So far my best time is 1 min <br>
and 6 sec.  After doing it for a while I felt very sick, (weird its <br>
like I am seasick) so be careful.  Now that I am not in front of the <br>
mirror it is a little difficult to solve the cube normally.  Give it <br>
a try, your head is just not used to it, I am sure after a little <br>
practice one could almost do it as quick as normal. <br>

ps  I was experimenting with two mirrors tonight as I was brushing <br>
my teeth.  I found that it was very difficult to brush your teeth <br>
with two mirrors. Very weird.<br>

Good stuff. The centres are marginally more awkward for bigger cubes 
(mainly because you have to count) and so are the edges (mainly 
because the likelihood that you can pull neat tricks decreases as 
symmetry during building is harder to maintain).

Here&#x27;s a tip: after the 15x15x15 have another go at the 7x7x7. The 
squares will seem much larger and you will see things faster, so your 
time should improve.

Yeah, I&#x27;ve never been able to do that too, but here is an advice: try with a toothbrush, instead of two mirrors. It should make the job a lot easier...

Tyvärr finns det ingen officiell återförsäljare av rubiks-prylar i 
Sverige. Det går dock att hitta piratkopior lite varstans (t.ex. på 
teknikmagasinet.se), men dessa hållerextremt dålig kvalitet och är 
en riktig plåga att vrida på, mer frustrerande än underhållande.

De enda riktiga alternativ som finns är att beställa från 
rubiks.com, där det dock tilkommer en del frakt + 25% moms om man 
beställer för mer än ungefär 400:-. Det går att beställa riktigt bra 
kuber från Ton på http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/buy1.htm . Kuberna 
är dock för tillfället slut, så du får vänta eller höra med Ton när 
han får in fler. Kom dock ihåg att även bra kuber behöver en del 
förberedande för att bli riktigt bra, silikonspray är ett måste.

Synd att det inte finns bra cuber att få tag i här i Sverige!
På Ton&#x27;s sida stod det om att man skulle justera skruvarna. Vad innebär det. Min nuvarande kub är ifrån 80 talet så den börjar bli ganska sliten. Men den har ju aldrig fått något underhåll heller. Man ska ju smörja sin kub med silikonspray. Vet du var man kan köpa sådant här i sverige och vilket märke är i så fall bäst?

          <div class="email-content">Silikonspray borde finnas i en mängd affärer, järnaffärer, 
bilprylsaffärer, bensinstationer m.m. Själv köper jag min silikon på 
Clas-Ohlson. Den heter CRC Silicone Spray och funkar bra, är dock 
den enda jag prövat. Att justera skruvarna innebär att man justerar 
hur &#x27;hård&#x27; kuben skall vara. Det går inte att göra på alla kuber, 
t.ex. inte på kuberna från rubiks.com. Vad jag vet så gick det dock 
på de flesta kuberna på 80-talet så det kanske går på din också. 
Skruvarna sitter bakom centerbitarna på varje sida och för att komma 
åt dem får man pilla loss brickan som täcker över skruven. Denna 
bricka syns ofta inte p.g.a. att klisterlappen sitter över. Det går 
dock att få loss den, men inte alltid helt utan besvär. Se upp om du 
använder kniv, så att du inte förstör kuben för mycket och att du 
inte slinter och skär dig.

Fullständiga instruktioner för att preparera en kub finns på 
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Speedcube/makinga.htm . Värt att 
notera är att vissa kuber går att få riktigt bra utan att fixa med 
skruvarna. Då gäller det dock att ha mer tur med att ha köpt en 
ovanligt bra kub. Det viktigaste är dock som sagt silikonet. På Tons 
sidan står allt om hur man skall använda (och inte använda) det.

          <div class="email-content">Vad jag har hört och förstått så är de av hög kvalitet men saknar 
inre fjädermekanism, vilket innebär att de inte är lämpliga för 
speedcubing då de inte förlåter om man håller kuben fel. Har dock 
inte prövat några själv. Har däremot köpt en massa andra pussel som 
är bra och gratis frakt ät svårt att slå. Deras 2*2*2, 4*4*4 och 
5*5*5 anses av många vara de bästa för speedcubing.

          <div class="email-content">:D Sorry about the use of Swedish language, I&#x27;ll try to use strictly 
English from here on. Don&#x27;t want the entire speedcubing community 
rolling on the floor because of some similarity with some renown 
quest ;)

Johan was asking if Mefferts 3*3*3 cubes was any good for 
speedcubing. My response was that I didn&#x27;t think so because as far 
as I know they are of good quality, but lack any internal springs to 
forgive misalignment. I also added that the 2*2*2, 4*4*4 and 5*5*5 
are preferred by many for speedcubing. 

So if anyone has more experience with mefferts assembly 3*3*3, 
please add.

          <div class="email-content">No tak, no tak, Michaeli,
no need to be abussive. The Swedes had their fling and hopefully 
they will not do it again. 
You really should cut this out, Swedish members. How would you like 
it, if Jessica, I, Mirek and Josef started to talk here in Czech, 
Ron, Jaap, Peter and Ton started talking un Dutch, the Japanese 
started talking in their language...pretty soon this group would 
become a Tower of Babel. You can practise your native patriotism via 
emails, Swedish chat or in a cofee shop somewhere in Sweden, but 
this group is no place for it.

          <div class="email-content">I have experience with the Meffert&#x27;s 3x3x3 assembly cube. I would not recommend it for speedcubing. This is because the internal mechanism is all plastic, and it can break quite easily with enough force. What I mean is, the centers are held on by 4 small plastic tabs apiece (for lack of a better description), and they can break easily from using the force that we do when we speedcube. It does work rather well for regular use though.
 
Hope I helped.

It would be perfectly fine if they couldn&#x27;t speak English. Sounds to 
me like that&#x27;s Johann&#x27;s case.

          <div class="email-content">Hey I have a question for all you math people.  I&#x27;m a math major so <br>
I&#x27;m starting to really get into the math aspects of the cube now <br>
that I&#x27;m learning more about math itself.  I&#x27;m in a combinatorics <br>
class, which inspired me to try to do these calculations.  I tried <br>
to find the number of combinations of a 4x4x4 supercube and a 5x5x5 <br>
supercube.  Here is what I came up with.<br>
<br>
4x4x4 supercube<br>
Just from experience on the 4x4x4 supercube I have found that it is <br>
possible to switch any two edge pieces and leave the rest of the <br>
cube alone (including centers).  I have also noticed that the parity <br>
of the centers, with respect to 2 piece switches, and the parity of <br>
the corners, with respect to 2 piece switches, are always the same.  <br>
So I came up with this calculation.<br>
<br>
Assume that solving the colors onto their original faces does not <br>
matter or cannot be measured.  By this I mean if before you scramble <br>
you have yellow on top, red on front, and green on right and you <br>
then scramble and solve without ever rotating the cube so that you <br>
end up with yellow on left, red on front and green on top, then you <br>
still have a a solved cube.<br>
<br>
Since the edges do their own thing and aren&#x27;t affected by the <br>
parities of the other groups of pieces they can be permuted into all <br>
24 possible locations, so they have 24! positions.  Now assume one <br>
of the corners, FUL say, is said to be in the &quot;correct slot&quot; (just <br>
like for finding the number of combos on a 2x2x2 cube).  Then the <br>
corners have 7!*(3)^6 possible positions and orientations included.  <br>
Lastly we have to permute the centers.  Since we have permuted all <br>
of the corners together, they may have either odd or even parity, so <br>
out of the 24 positions for the centers we can permute 22 of them <br>
totally randomly, but the last two must be placed in a set way to <br>
conserve the parity.  So there are P(24,22) or (24!)/(2!) ways to <br>
permute the centers.  Total that makes [(24!)^2*(7!)*(3)^6]/2 if I <br>
am doing this correctly.<br>
<br>
To then find the number of cominations of the normal 4x4x4 is easy <br>
from here.  The corners are the same, and the edges are the same, <br>
but for the centers replace the (24!)/(2!) term with (24!)/(4!)^6 to <br>
permute 6 groups of 4 pieces, the elements of each group being <br>
indistinguishable from each other.  Parity doesn&#x27;t come into account <br>
for the centers since placing the last four centers does conserve <br>
parity technically (physically the pieces are in a position to do <br>
so), but you don&#x27;t see this if it is not a supercube.<br>
<br>
So for a normal 4x4x4 you would have [(24!)^2*(7!)*(3)^6]/[2*(4!)^6] <br>
if I am not mistaken.  This number, though, doesn&#x27;t agree with <br>
Richard Carr&#x27;s formula, and he kinda knows more math than me :) so <br>
where did I go wrong?<br>
<br>
Also here is my calculation for the 5x5x5 supercube.  The parity in <br>
the corners (w.r.t 2 piece swaps), the very centermost centers <br>
(w.r.t quarter turns), the centermost edges (w.r.t 2 piece swaps), <br>
and the outer center pieces (the ones that form an X around the very <br>
center piece)(w.r.t 2 piece swaps) are always the same.  This is <br>
just something I have noticed having messed around a bunch on a <br>
5x5x5 supercube.  Also the following parities are separate, but <br>
conserved amongst eachother.  The parity of the outer edges (w.r.t 2 <br>
piece swaps) is the same as the parity of the central centers (the <br>
ones that form a &quot;+&quot; around the centermost center)(w.r.t 2 piece <br>
swaps) is the same and also separate from the parities of the <br>
corners, etc..<br>
<br>
So I considered these two groups as different cases.<br>
<br>
Case 1:  the corners/central edges/centermost centers/outer centers<br>
<br>
First give all the centermost centers their orientations, so 4^6.  <br>
Now the centers either have odd or even parity, which must be <br>
conserved.  The corners now have (8!)/(2!) positions and 3^7 <br>
orientations.  The centermost edges now have (12!)/(2!) positions <br>
and 2^11 orientations.  The outer centers (the ones that form the <br>
X&#x27;s) have (24!)/(2!) positions.  So all told just these three groups <br>
considered have <br>
[(4^6)*(8!)*(3^7)*(12!)*(2^11)*(24!)]/[2^3] = 24!*12!*8!*(2^20)*(3^7)<br>
<br>
Case 2: the outer edges/the inner centers<br>
<br>
The edges, just like on the 4x4x4, sort of do their own thing <br>
without affecting the corners/central center/etc.. so we can go <br>
ahead and permute them into their 24! spots.  Now the parity of <br>
these outer edges is either odd or even, so to account for that we <br>
permute 22 out of the 24 central centers, leaving the last two to <br>
occupy the required spots to conserve parity.  So case 2 has,<br>
24!*(24!)/(2!) = (24!)^2/(2!)<br>
<br>
Since each case of case 1 has all the possibilites of case 2 and <br>
vice versa we just multiply all of that together and get<br>
<br>
(24!)^3*12!*8!*(2^19)*(3^7)<br>
<br>
To find the number of combinations to the normal 5x5x5 from here I <br>
assume we would just adjust the terms for the 2 types of moveable <br>
centers.  So in case 1, (24!)/(2!) for the outer centers becomes <br>
(24!)/(4!)^6 and in case 2 for the central centers (24!)/(2!) <br>
becomes (24!)/(4!)^6 and the final count changes to,<br>
[(24!)^3*12!*8!*(2^21)*(3^7)]/[(4!)^12]<br>
<br>
This number, nor my number for the 5x5x5 supercube, agree with <br>
Richard&#x27;s formula.  I guess I&#x27;m confused where I went wrong.  I made <br>
the parity assumptions based on experience of trying to set up <br>
various positions in the edges or centers and trying to reduce all <br>
the other groups to their original positions, or a position with <br>
just 2 pieces switched, etc..  I don&#x27;t really know much group theory <br>
beyond the basic introductory definition of a group of numbers, so I <br>
can&#x27;t really use that to determine how the parity works.  I just <br>
tried to go off my experience having solved each type of supercube <br>
several times.<br>
<br>
So anyway I think it&#x27;s right, but it doesn&#x27;t agree with Richard&#x27;s <br>
calculations, which I&#x27;m inclined to trust.  So I&#x27;m wondering where I <br>
went wrong?  Does anyone have any ideas?<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  To make sure I used the formula right the floor function of <br>
2.5 would be 2, and the cieling function of 2.5 would be 3 correct?  <br>
The exponents in Richard&#x27;s formula used the floor and cieling <br>
functions quite a bit and I used those as I just mentioned.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well after about 8 months and 4000 messages I am once again a <br>
regular member of this group!!  I believe it was during finals week <br>
at the end of the last school year when I last visited this site <br>
once a day. Since then I had a great summer skimboarding every day, <br>
I went to the World Rubik&#x27;s Championships, and started my senior <br>
year at the University of California, Irvine.  Since the World <br>
Championships I have neglected my cube.  It all changed when I <br>
started this semester taking my Senior Design Project.  I am <br>
designing a robot that manipulates a Rubik&#x27;s cube out of Legos.  <br>
Very much like JP Brown&#x27;s Lego Cube Solver.  Mine is different <br>
because we have to design the circuitry as well.  One day I might <br>
put a camera on it and have it solve the cube by itself, but I see <br>
no need too. (Besides I can solve it :)   )  Anyway I hope to <br>
improve my speed-cubing times and bring down my average. <br>

Then Johan should perhaps send an email to one of his English-
speaking countrymen and ask for a translation.

This is what I tell my own countrymen: English language is the King 
of the mainstream Internet. If you want rhe full benefit of rhe 
Internet, you have to know English.

BTW, English is not my native languag, either, so please don&#x27;t acuse

I make it that your number is half of my number. In the centres part 
you had 24!/2 which you then changed to 24!/(4!)^6 to account for it 
not being a supercube so that the positions are indistinguishable if 
2 centres are changed. In the number you give you have both the 4!^6 
and the 2 in the denominator though.

If you look at my formula, the 88179840 part is simply 8!*3^7 which 
accounts for the corners being randomly scrambled. In the 
denominator there is a term (the second one) which works out as 1 if 
N is odd and 24 if N is even. This accounts for even cubes not 
having fixed centres (it does much the same as when you assumed one 
corner to be correctly solved). That reduces 8!*3^7 to 7!*3^6.
We both have a (24!)^2 on the top and a (4!)^6 on the bottom, so the 
only difference is that you have kept your 1/2 from supercube 
considerations over.
(The other terms in my formula are as follows: the power of 1024 on 
the top is the central edge orientation and the fact that central 
edges and corners are either both permuted oddly or both permuted 
evenly - it is either 1024=2^11/2 if N is odd or 1 if N is even. The 
first factorial on the top accounts for the permutation of the 
central edges - 12! if N is odd and 0!=1 if N is even. The final 
term in the numerator accounts for the permutation of the centres 
and of the non-central edges. The centres fall into orbits of size 
24 so we get a 24! for each of them but this is too much and the 
exponent at the bottom involving 24 (i.e. 4!) corrects for the 
centres. The exponent is slightly different here from the part at 
the top because that also included the non-central edges.
(My formula is for non-supercubes.))

If you look at the group theory behind it it will be clear. This is 
because slice moves give even permutations of the X centres and the 
only way to get odd permutations of them  is by quarter face turns.

That&#x27;s not quite true. If you do a quarter turn of a face the outer 
edges are permuted evenly (2 4-cycles) but the inner + centres are 
permuted oddly (1 4-cycle). You can see this by just doing &quot;U&quot; on a 
solved cube, for instance. If the corners are permuted evenly then 
they do agree, though.

You&#x27;re missing something here. In 4^6/2, 8!/2 and 12!/2 and 24!/2 
the 2&#x27;s don&#x27;t multiply - they all arise in the same way (because the 
cube needs an odd or even number of quarter face turns to solve it). 
You&#x27;d get (4^6*8!*12!*24!)/2*(2^11*3^7).

This bit looks good to me.

That&#x27;s also true but the number you had in case 1 is a quarter of 
what it should be.

This looks correct too.

I assume it&#x27;s just that factor of 4, although I don&#x27;t want to work 
out numbers of that size just now!
Your main problem in the 5x5x5 seems to be that you assumed the 
division by 2 in the case of corners, central edges and X centres 
were independent (though curiously the centremost centres you did 
not assume independence for, but saw that this was connected (in 
sentence 2 of case 1). Thus you divided by 2^3 instead of 2 (if you 
hadn&#x27;t made the other connection it would presumably have been 2^4). 
In fact, all of the divisions by 2 in case 1 arise from whether the 
cube needs an odd or even number of quarter face turns in its 
solution and this is why you only get to account for the 2 once 
rather than 3 or 4 times.

Yes, that&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s ceiling rather than cieling though. Much of 
that is just to get 1 if N is odd and 0 if N is even (or 1 if N is 
even and 0 if N is odd).

Nice to read you Jasmine.
And thanks for your message.
I am going to go less than 10 days!
Wow!  I will be nervous, but I am sure I can do somehow.
Because I made my foreign friends be surprised many times!
Maybe the friend I will make in there will also be surpriesed.
And I will try to make Rubik&#x27;s Cube much popular arround me!
If you have any informations, please let me know.
For example, where can I get Rubik&#x27;s cube or another 3D puzzles etc.
I ma gonna go Griffth Uni, Brisbane.  But I don&#x27;t have any knowledg 
about them! Alas! lol

Anyway, thanks for your message once again.
I felt ease.

Best, 

taka.

I wont do it again. I&#x27;ll send the swedesh messages to teir mail instead.
So now I ask in Engish:
Where do you buy your cubes. They aren&#x27;t available here in Sweden so I&#x27;ll need to find it on the Webb!

Probably none, because you do not have a chance to succeed
in getting worn out cubes in the Czech Republic.
(Me, my friends and other people tried it quite hard.)
In addition, not many people in this group that understand
Czech live in the Czech Republic (except for me).

          <div class="email-content">I just noticed something pretty cool, I was wondering if other people 
use the same logic on big cubes?  I ran into a problem on a 9x9x9, two 
edge center peices were swapped out with all other edges grouped 
together fine.  I guessed that this was a parity error, and then I 
noticed that since everything else was together, I could treat this like 
a 5x5x5, the same way I solve a 5x5x5 like a 3x3x3 once all of the edges 
are grouped together and all of the centers solved.  So I applied the 
alg I use for the parity error on the 5x5x5 ([Rr] U2) * 5 and it was put 
in a very-easy-to-solve state.  So using my noggin paid off ;)

Also, I broke my personal best AGAIN today with 33.66 seconds.  I just 
started doing the cross on the bottom and using more triggers and this 
week I have gotten 4 or 5 sub&lt;40s, the only I have ever gotten.  Let 
that be a lesson, triggers == good ;)

   Since a) none of us will ever see but a very small fraction of the<br>

have begun to wonder a few things which might be useful to know.<br>
<br>
   What is the fewest number of turns in random scrambles before<br>
people start to get a significant number of lucky solves?<br>
<br>
   Related to this is: what is the fewest number of turns neede to<br>
look fairly thoroughly scrambled? One I found is 8 moves: r&#x27; u2 F&#x27; B&#x27;<br>

I think what Josef meant is that people in Czech Republic would 
appreciate a worn-out cube, if they could find one. The Czechs here 
mostly ive abroad, so they cannot appreciate the agony of a cuber 
without a cube.
A while ago I received an email from a Czech cuber, if I could help 
him find that little store that sold them. I replied that I do not 
live in CR and sent him online.

Well, my answer to the direct question is: No.
Jelinek is really quite common name in the Czech Republic and
it is pure Czech name, so that Jelinek was probably originally
from Czechoslovakia (today non-existing federation of Czech Rep. and 
Slovakia) or so were his father or grandfather...

It is quite funny, that neither Jelinek nor Schneider are
typical names for Australian or Hungarian. ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

It&#x27;s always great to have a new face.  You&#x27;re just another mind we&#x27;re sucking into the world 
of the cube... we&#x27;re going to take over the world!  MWHAHAHA!

Anyway, the main thing to solve faster is just to practice.  I don&#x27;t know what method you 
use, but most likely it&#x27;s a relatively basic method.  With practice, you should be able to 
memorize everything and execute all the moves pretty quickly and probably get down to 
about a minute yourself.  There are many methods out there.  There&#x27;s your basic layer-by-
layer method.  There&#x27;s also an interesting corner-expansion type method by Lars Petrus 
which can be found at http://lar5.com/cube/.  Another famous method out there is by 
Jessica Fridrich and her website can be found at http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/
cube.html.  If you ever need help with anything, don&#x27;t hesitate to ask.

As for Supercubing, I believe our resident expert is Chris Hardwick.  On some cubes, they 
come with pictures.  When solving these cubes, it is necessary to orient the centers so that 
all the pictures match.  The idea behind supercubing is basically to not only place all the 
pieces in the right place but also to orient all of them.  This becomes quite a task with 
larger cubes.

So, keep on practicing!  Basically, if you put time into the cube, your time will drop.  Have 
fun!

Czech, of course. What else?
People hold on tight to their cubes there, because they are not 
easily available Worn-out cubes can be refurbished.

If a Swede would ask - via internet - people in Sweden, where in Sweden to buy cubes, in what language should he write?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Just a few things.  Before I officially announce the Caltech Spring <br>
Tournament 2004 (scheduled for April 3), I was thinking since we&#x27;ll <br>
probably have a bit more time (more lounge time) and we&#x27;ll probably be <br>
more efficient because we can learn from the last tournament&#x27;s <br>
mistakes, that we should have another sideshow event such as one-handed <br>
solving or something else.  (I can hear kenneth yelling rubik&#x27;s magic!) <br>
  So... I&#x27;d like to allow you guys to suggest such an event...<br>
<br>
Furthermore, this is especially for Chris, as our next tournament will <br>
be &quot;official&quot; in that all records set will be acknowledged as official <br>
world records, I&#x27;d like to bring the idea of the Average of 10 (12 <br>
solves, average middle 10) as an official category.  We all know how <br>
meaningless single solves are.  Anyway, what are your thoughts on this?<br>
<br>
Many thanks for Dave Jones for providing trophies!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, it is amazing when you read about what the top cubers can do. 
I remember when I first discovered this group. At the time, I could 
solve in a minute on a good day, but I was probably averaging around 
75 seconds. I also thought I was reasonably fast, but then I read 
about people solving in under 20 seconds and realised I wasn&#x27;t so 
good after all. I was so amazed by how fast some people were, I 
couldn&#x27;t imagine how anyone could be so good! But then after more 
practice, learning new algorithms, meeting (and being inspired by) 
speedcubers at the Rubik&#x27;s World Championships last year, I now have 
a best time of 29.8 seconds (averaging mid-40&#x27;s though). So now I 
have *some* concept of how the superfast cubers do it. :)

close to 1:00 without lucky breaks. My method that I learned (from a <br>

3 edges on top, leaving one open to allow me to put 3 edges in the <br>

Hello Wes,

   Welcome aboard. Your method of solving is close to what Enro Rubik
first worked out.

Hi Wes well you came to the right place. You pretty much are solving 
a good method.  Your method easily translates in to a good corners 
first method that I use.    
Here is my method:

First:  Solve the first four corners, followed by the same edges.  
(When finished the first layer should be done minus one edge.)
Second: Solve the other corners. (Just like you already do)
Third:  Use the keyhole in the first layer to solve the edges for 
the third layer. (Just like you already do)
Fourth:  Finish just like you already do.

The only difference is that I can solve the second 4 corners in one 
alg.  Here is the website that I learned the algs from: 
http://www.speedcubing.com/corners_first_corners.html

This method is very good; I average around 25s a cube.  It took me 
about 3 months of cubing from where you are to get about 30s a cube. 
(and another 3 to get to 25s)

If you need any other help feel free to email me directly at 
kbrandon@...

Hope this helps,
Kenneth

RUBIK&#x27;S MAGIC!!!!!!<br>
I got 2.3s on the speedstack timer while I was at Caltech. (Third <br>
try) I think sub 2s is possible, on the speedstack timers.  Also we <br>
could have a 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 comp.  The downfalls are that they take <br>
more time (much more time) and many people don&#x27;t have them.  I think <br>
one handed is a good idea because anyone can do that.<br>

First off welcome to the group!  You should probably stick with the 
corners first method, although you could try some other approaches 
such as the fridrich method ( 
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html ) or the Petrus 
method ( http://www.lar5.com/cube/index.html ).

The corners first method you use is a pretty good one, I know that 
method as well and have about a 45-50 second average with it.  Its 
not my fastest method though.  There are some REALLY fast corners 
first methods out there.

A few of the main things you could do to speed up your current 
method is to make sure you have a good cube!  Most of use use 
silicone spray to make our cubes SOO much smoother turning, and be 
able to look ahead and find the pieces you need before you actually 
need them.  Finger tricks are a huge help also.

well thats just the tip of the ice burg......

          <div class="email-content">I was going to email Chris directly about this, but I couldn&#x27;t get <br>
an email thru to him for some reason.  Here&#x27;s what I wrote up, so <br>
anyone&#x27;s free to take a shot.<br>
...<br>
This is my method for supercubing:::<br>
<br>
1st step= build 3/4 of cross.  (making sure also to<br>
orient the center that the cross is being built<br>
around)<br>
<br>
2nd step= make up turns and use your free space to<br>
orient the 4 side centers correctly.  I say correctly<br>
in the sense that, 3 centers will actually be oriented<br>
corrctly, and the last will be oriented in such a way<br>
that when the remaining edge is put in the center will<br>
become correct. (i hope i explained this well enough)<br>
<br>
3rd step= F2L...none of my f2l algs tamper with the<br>
centers, so your f2l remains fluid just like normal<br>
solving.  <br>
<br>
4th step=orient everything (i use two steps)  Most of<br>
my orientation algs are not center destructive.<br>
<br>
*note- The idea is that after orienting the 5 centers<br>
in the beginning, that you don&#x27;t tamper with them the<br>
remainder of the solve.  That means your last center<br>
will either end up solved or 180* off.  <br>
*2nd note-my approach makes it essential that all LL<br>
algs used only effect the permutation of the LL<br>
center, no other centers.  <br>
<br>
5th step=permute everything (1-2 steps)  it will take<br>
me two steps sometimes if i know the alg will ruin<br>
center orientation, although i haven&#x27;t done enough to<br>
find out which permutations will do that.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Richard!  It&#x27;s good to see more people getting into 
supercubing!  Now that I&#x27;ve started doing the supercubes (4x4, and 
5x5) I really feel like we&#x27;re almost cheating ourselves out of most 
of the fun of speedcubing with the normal cubes.  My times are a lot 
slower for each type of supercube, but to me it is soooo much more 
fun to solve the supercube versions.  I think if someone were to 
dedicate themselves to the 3x3x3 supercube like most everyone has to 
the normal 3x3x3, then there would be people who could average 17 
seconds on it.  *ahem* 3x3x3 Top ten list people :)

My theories of a &quot;perfect&quot; method (there are many of course) based 
around the Fridrich method would be to direct solve the cross and 
the first 5 centers (maybe 1 or 2 seconds more on average than 
normal with lots of practice).  The F2L could then be done normally 
except you&#x27;d have to use fewer empty slot algs as they affect 
centers most of the time.  The OLLs could be done just as fast as 
they are normally, however you would have to make sure that all of 
your algs affect only the last layer center (so 40 algs required 
still).  Then for the PLLs you would have to have one alg memorized 
for each permutation and center orientation.  There are 4!*(4!/2!)
=288 positions the last layer can be in on a supercube after all the 
pieces are oriented correctly, assuming you first turn the top layer 
so that the center is correct.  There are technically 1152 LL 
positions if the pieces are all oriented correctly, but you can 
rotate the U layer and technicaly create 4 different positions out 
of really just 1 LL setup.  I hope that made sense.  Of course there 
are lots of symmetries in these positions, but I haven&#x27;t counted the 
number of algs you would have to learn.  The edge 3 cycle and corner 
3 cycle permutations together would require 8 unique algs (16 if you 
count reflections).  I&#x27;d like to count the exact number soon, as I 
am considering learning the algs required to complete this method if 
there aren&#x27;t too many.

Anyway that was a long explanation.  Richard the method you 
described is almost exactly what I do in my supercubing.  When I do 
no inspection solves I almost always do the F2L exactly like you 
describe.  If I am doing solves with inspection I like to direct 
solve the cross and first 5 centers.  You can do this in around 12 
moves usually, sometimes as few as a normal 3x3x3 cross solve.  For 
the LL I always do OLL then PLL though, then fix the 2 centers that 
get messed up.  Since the cube centers are conserved throughout the 
F2L (try to avoid most emtpy slot cases to increase the likelihood 
of this), then the OLLs only sometimes mess up a center, which means 
you have to flip 3 centers in the end sometimes.  Since the top 
layer center only has a 1/4 chance of being solved for each PLL, and 
since it seems a lot fo the PLL&#x27;s flip a middle layer center, then 
most of the time you end up with two centers in the end that need to 
flip.

I&#x27;ve thought about turning the top layer so that the center is 
correct, then doing the required algs, but my alg for the Z 
permuation flips the centers, so if the edges are in the Z perm, 
then not only do I have to fix the corners and edges in separate 
steps, but I still have to correct the centers at the end.  Also I 
tried that startegy for a while, but for some reason it seemed 
slower to me.  I think both strategies would take about the same 
amount of time really.  I guess it is more of a personal choice.

Anyway, I think your method is great for speed supercubing.  I&#x27;m 
still not very good at fewest moves supercubing, talk to Mr. 
Fredlund for that, he is the master of 3x3x3 fewest moves 
supercubing as far as I know.

That&#x27;s so awesome to hear of others trying out supercubing!  I 
strongly recommend you try larger cube super cubing as well, it is a 
LOT of fun.

If there aren&#x27;t too many LL algs to learn to complete the &quot;expert&quot; 
super cubing method as I like to think of it, maybe we can get some 
really fast people to learn them.  I&#x27;d like to learn the algs if 
there aren&#x27;t too many and see how fast I can get on the supercube, 
but I think it would be awesome to see what you guys who can average 
15-16 seconds would pull on a supercube.  I think consistent sub-20 
averages on the super cube would be possible if you learned all the 
algs.

Also would anyone be interested in competitive supercubing, at an 
official competition I mean?  I think that would be a cool secondary 
event if there was enough time.

Anyway, just food for thought.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, only a few seconds into glancing at the Corners-First final layer <br>
corners algorithm page, I have a quick question: After the table, <br>
there&#x27;s a note that says that some of these algorithms may disturb <br>
the edges on the top layer. That leads me to believe that it would be <br>
advantageous to do corners on top, corners on bottom (using the <br>
algorithm), then doing edges top then bottom, then center, like <br>
previously discussed. However, in reading your summary of your <br>
method, Kenneth, I think you said that you do the top corners, then <br>
edges, and then the bottom corners. If so, wouldn&#x27;t it happen that <br>
every now and then you&#x27;re required to use an algorithm (for the <br>
bottom layer corners) that potentially disturbs the edges on top? Of <br>
course, I very well could have misread something somewhere, so <br>
forgive me if I&#x27;m jumping to conclusions :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

first, you can also look at my temprorary pages describing
(with little explanation text, though) corner-first method
for beginners: http://rubikscube.info (it will change)
and for advanced: http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html
I work also on Marc Waterman&#x27;s method description
(I would not like to release incomplete version..
However here it is: http://rubikscube.info/waterman/)
This method is an expert &quot;corners first&quot; method and
I optimized it a little compared to the published version.

To answer your question:
there are three or four sets of algorithms in use that
orients and permute top layer corners in one step:
1. orient and permute top corners, ignore all edges
   - used for pure corner-first methods
2. orient and permute top corners, ignore edges except for
   bottom ones
   - used e.g. in Waterman&#x27;s method
3. orient and permute top corners, ignore top edges
   - used e.g. in Guus Razoux Schultz&#x27;s method (layered)
4. orient and permute top corners, other cubies intact
   - have not seen such a method
These sets are not disjoint and many optimal algorithms
fall into first two or three cases.
The optimal lengths of the same algorithms in case A and B are:
 if A &lt; B then lengthInA &lt;= lengthInB

You can use the first case.
However Kenneth probably uses the second case.
The speedcubing.com covers the first three cases.

Best regards,

Josef

          <div class="email-content">The instance is a little less rare, if you consider even
the situations where corners are solved and 
one edge (e.g. FR) is in adjacent incorrect position
(e.g. in FL instead of FR) and the other edge (e.g. FL)
is anywhere else.
Then by the five turns (F2U2F2U2F2) the edge can be solved.
This is also quite rare.
However, this sequence can be generalized to:
F2 U2 F U2 F2 or F2 U2 F&#x27; U2 F2
These sequences are useful when you need to
solve an edge in the top layer (e.g. FR edge in FU position)
and the corresponding corner (e.g. DFR) is already solved +
the adjacent corner (e.g. DFL) is already solver +
the adjecent edge (e.g. FL) is NOT solved.
This sequence can be used by people that first solve
the top (in this case bottom) layer and ther the middle layer.
This sequence can be used for 2 or 3 middle edges and saves some
moves. The remaining edges can be solved using standard:
R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F or F U F U F U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;

Cupstacking isn&#x27;t a puzzle, so does this mean that some non-puzzle 
records will now be allowed? Because I was pondering submitting my 
Bop-It record to the UWR.

the pages now so maybe something went weird with us both updating

Also I would personally be in favor of creating some type of &quot;Other

trying to think of a good category to put the cup stuff into and I 
also agree that it is not a puzzle, so it doesn&#x27;t really fit in 
other puzzles.

I&#x27;ll e-mail Ron and see what he would think of an &quot;Other stuff&quot;

totally screw up and knock down one of the larger pyramids and while 
stacking it again to fix it you accidently knock down another one, 
stuff like that.  You don&#x27;t have to accept something like a 55 
second time, just count it as a screwup or scratch.  I&#x27;ll look at 
their official rules and see how they do it for screwups.

   I agree with Duncan. In terms of credit some may say &quot;Big deal,
that&#x27;s been found before.&quot; But if you found it on your own that is a
big deal. Besides, naming is happenstance. Naming is often not by the
first who found something but the first to publish a name. 

   How many people here use only their own algorithms?

   What percentage of algs which you use are ones you figured out or

 100%

   I seem to be headed in that direction: orienting and permuting top
corners, leaving other cubies intact.

   For example, instead of using R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F, I use L&#x27; B&#x27; R B L
B&#x27; R&#x27; B.

   And, no, I don&#x27;t have the full set yet.

          <div class="email-content">I think an other stuff cattegory is a good idea. There are many 
things that could be in there such as those wooden peice puzzles 
that you have to assemble. Cup stacking also seems like it should be 
in the same category as puzzles like rubik&#x27;s magic because once you 
know the routine, it&#x27;s all about speed and not really a puzzle. None 
the less they are still fun. I would like to become good at cup 
stacking - it sounds fun.

--barefoot Chris

PS just wondering if anyone here can type really fast. speedtyping 
seems to be the same type of challenge as speedstacking.

never thought I could solve it but about 3 weeks ago I picked it up <br>
and followed a tutorial online that showed me how to do it.  I&#x27;ve <br>
been hooked since then.  I used the second method of solving on this <br>
website:  http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm.  I&#x27;ve gotten my time down to <br>
1:15-1:45 and I&#x27;m trying to figure out where to go from here.  I&#x27;ve <br>
been learning Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s algorithms for the first two layers <br>
now.  Is this the way to go?  Should I be working on that now?  Also, <br>
she says that you shouldn&#x27;t hold the cross on the top, which I am <br>
accustomed to.  Should I wait until I can solve it using her method <br>
and have a better understanding of the cube, THEN learn how to do it <br>
with the cross on the left, since I am accustomed to solving it with <br>
the cross on the top?  Should I start solving it with the cross on <br>
the left/bottom from the beginning?<br>

Basically, where should I go from here?  Thanks!<br>

Hello Chris,

Don&#x27;t worry, everything&#x27;s fine with the updates. I asked for the
removal. I was just a bit fed up with records. Maybe I&#x27;ll come back
later. :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi, Duncan,<br>
<br>
I agree that seeking a new alg can be fun, but lot has been done in <br>
speedcubing. The time for uriginal discovery in this  area was in <br>
the 80s when Jessica and Lars were formulating  their strtegies.  If <br>
you want to discover new things today, you should look into:<br>
computer cubing <br>
cbe code development<br>
cube art.<br>
<br>
I specilize in cube art. Drawing a picture of a Rubik&#x27;s cube is not <br>
cube art, you musr actually use Rubik&#x27;s cube as art medium. I do <br>
three dimensional stuctures, both cubical and non-cubical. The <br>
website to look at is http://wwww.design.rubikscube.info .<br>
<br>
I exhibited 3d designs in Toronto last yoer.I couldn&#x27;t compete, <br>
because I had no rivals! No one could do it! I was thr only <br>
exhibitor. I  left Toronto in a state of shock.<br>
<br>
Would you, as a mathmatician, happen to know of anyone who can do <br>
this? I have been asking this question  of bazzilion people. Only <br>
one person answered yes. When I inquired after the name, he <br>
replied:&quot;Hana bizek.&quot; :-)<br>
<br>
Discovery IS fun, that&#x27;swhy we have math and science.<br>

there some tips to memorize and keep them in the brain, because out <br>
of all of the 53 algorithms, there is no way to keep all of them up <br>

As for your questions:  I started with the cross on top and it <br>

You might want to learn some toned down LL methods as well before <br>

This evening I finished posting diagrams for step 3 of Ryan&#x27;s method on my <br>

Also step 4 diagrams are posted. They allow you to solve the LL corners and <br>

Hi Wes.  On that website <br>
(http://www.speedcubing.com/corners_first_corners.html) there are <br>
multiple algs for the different cases, and it says that the ones <br>
marked with an ! disturb edges. So all you do is memorize the algs <br>
without the !  :) <br>
<br>
Anyway it really won&#x27;t mater if you solve top edges first or not, <br>
but I do because it lowers my recognition time to see what case is <br>
on the bottom corners.  <br>
<br>
Another thing, don&#x27;t try to learn all of the algs at once. <br>
<br>
First memorize the ones that don&#x27;t swap corners, but twist them.<br>
These are cases (c1, c7, c13, c17, c23, c29, c35) if you memorize <br>
these first you can more easily switch from your method to a more <br>
advanced method. <br>
<br>
Basically once you learned these algs you could first use an alg <br>
that you already know to place the bottom corners, and then these 7 <br>
algs would finish the corners, Then it would only take two algs to <br>
solve the bottom corners. <br>
<br>
Memorizing only these 7 more algs is a great intermediate method, <br>
you could be averaging sub 40 with practice.<br>
<br>
Well I hoped this helped, Good Luck,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the reply!

Yeah, that does make a lot of sense.  I would definitely try the 
cross on the left, but some of the algorithms get a little 
confusing.  I&#x27;ll work towards that now though.  As for LL, I 
definitely agree with that.  What I&#x27;ve been doing right now is 
solving 3 of the 4 corner/edge combos and then using the last empty 
one as a working space to solve the top edges.  Thanks for the advice 
though!

MANY THANKS to Per K!

Thanks for posting your description (post#8890 - attached) 
describing how to build your own commutator.  By following your 
suggestions (alg A, face turn B, A&#x27;, B&#x27;) I was able to sit down last 
night and figure out how to 3-cycle the center pieces on a 4x4x4!!  
This was very exciting for me because I typically follow the centers-
edges-3x3x3 approach for the 4x4x4 and so I never needed to know how 
to move centers while leaving the rest of the cube untouched.  
Nonetheless I always love trying different solution paths for 
solving all different sized cubes - even if I always use the same 
approach to speedcube.

I know that these center 3-cycles have long been known and I do not 
claim to have &#x27;invented&#x27; a new alg -- but what fun it was to work it 
out on my own instead of looking it up online!  I also expect that 
it will be much easier to remember.  I figured out several different 
cominations for cycling three ceterpieces between 2 faces and also, 
by stringing a couple of alg together, how to 3 cycle thre 
centerpieces on the same face.

I expect this new found command of centerpiece movement will have 
two huge ramifications for what I can do with the big cubes.  I have 
already realized one of them ..... (see next post)

Thanks again Per K!

Rob

          <div class="email-content"><br>
.... so as a result of finally learning how to 3-cycle 4x4x4 <br>
centerpieces I decided to follow Chris&#x27; suggestion to supercube a <br>
4x4x4.  <br>
<br>
I was successful on my first try but was I ever glad I didn&#x27;t look <br>
at the time before I started.  I know that I have a good <br>
enough &#x27;vocabulary&#x27; of moves to solve the supercube 4x4x4 every time <br>
but I think that I need to give serious consideration to my solution <br>
path to guarantee efficiency.  Cool, yet another reason to mess <br>
around with my 4x4x4.  <br>
<br>
For my first solve I solved all 24 centers into the right positions, <br>
then united all the edges, then solved like a 3x3x3, then went back <br>
and fixed the centers that had become messed up in the process.  I <br>
know this can&#x27;t possibly be the most effective solution path but I <br>
chose it intentionally because I was curious to see what effect the <br>
center-edge-3x3x3 solution would have on the centerpieces as it was <br>
being implemented.  I was surprised to find that the parity move I <br>
use for the single edge-pair flip does not, in fact, alter the <br>
relative positions of any of the centerpieces.  If I flip the UF <br>
edge then all centers are untouched except the U centers which <br>
rotate 180 as a unit.  Previously I had always thought that the edge <br>
flip also repositioned two of the centerpieces - so I learned <br>
something new this afternoon.    <br>
<br>
I mentioned in my previous post that center 3-cycling would have 2 <br>
huge ramifications for me.  The other one, which I intend to <br>
postpone until the summer (lest I become terribly addicted to it and <br>
unproductive in all other spheres of my life), is to blindfold a <br>
4x4x4.  I can&#x27;t wait to attempt this huge challenge.  I know that it <br>
will be MUCH harder than blindfolding a 3x3x3, but i just gotta try <br>
it :)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the encouragement and enthusiasm Chris.  I have to <br>
confess that supercubing a 3x3x3 isn&#x27;t all that different from a <br>
standard solve to me (you only REALLY need to know 1 additional alg -<br>
 though 2 or 3 can prove more efficient) but supercubing big cubes <br>
is DEFINATELY something I will do much more often as it really is <br>
cubing on another level from a standard 4x4x4 solve.  Right now both <br>
my 5x5x5 are out of order - one has a broken centercorner [my first <br>
5x5x5 break - just last week :( ] and the other is in the process of <br>
being painted.  As soon as I finish painting my 5x5x5 I&#x27;ll give that <br>
a try too.<br>
<br>
What about some convenient (and fun) abbreviations?<br>
supercube 4x4x4 = super4<br>
supercube 5x5x5 = superprof<br>
<br>
P.S. for others potentially interested in making a temporary <br>
supercube - <br>
I just put dabs of &#x27;liquid paper&#x27; on the centerpieces.  It will give <br>
you easy recognition but will also easily scrape off with your <br>
thumbnail if you just want a normal Revenge again.  Using White as <br>
up and blue as front (how I always hold my cube for blindfolding) I <br>
just put one dab on the top left center, two dabs on the top right, <br>
three on the bottom left, and four on the bottom right of each <br>
colour in the same patern as would appear on a die.  A quick and <br>
easy way to make a temporary supercube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello Rob!

U actually need at least 2 facecenter orienting algs to solve the 
supercube if u ignore centers until cube is solved normally. It&#x27;s bit 
tricky to prove it mathematically, but neither an alg doing [UR] or 
[UR&#x27;] will be enuff. The latter is fairly easy to prove that it can 
never achieve for instance [U2] since the sum of the orientation 
effects is 0, while it should be 2 for [U2]. [UR] has the right sum 
but it still won&#x27;t be possible to achieve [U2].

Happy supercubing anyway :D

          <div class="email-content">Hey Rob and others!!<br>
<br>
Reading Rob&#x27;s posting (#8990) he says he could create a facecenter 3 <br>
cycle on one face by combining several 3 cycles on facecenters. This <br>
can actually be achieved in one 3-cycle, also a commutator. But in <br>
this case one has to do some preliminary positioning first.<br>
<br>
This is how to make the following facecenter 3 cycle : (Urf =&gt; Ubr =&gt; <br>
Ulb) Use the following alg : (f&#x27;)[r&#x27;u&#x27;r,U](f)<br>
<br>
Without doing (f&#x27;) first we would have had the following 3-cycle <br>
instead  : (Luf =&gt; Ubr =&gt; Ulb)<br>
<br>
Other 3 cycles not directly achievable by a direct commutator can be <br>
achieved similarly with some other prepositioning. This can be <br>
written generally like this : C[A,B]C&#x27;. If i recall correctly this is <br>
called a conjugation of a commutator. If A=C&#x27;D or B=EC then we will <br>
have cancellation of C (or C&#x27;) at front or back and we have done a <br>
transcription of the original commutator [A,B] with the same number <br>
of moves !!<br>
<br>
An example. Consider again [r&#x27;u&#x27;r,U]=r&#x27;u&#x27;rUr&#x27;urU&#x27;. Letting C=r then <br>
we will have (r)r&#x27;u&#x27;rUr&#x27;urU&#x27;(r&#x27;)=u&#x27;rUr&#x27;urU&#x27;r&#x27;, also a 3-cycle on <br>
facecenters. Letting C=ur we end up with rUr&#x27;urU&#x27;r&#x27;u&#x27; and so on. All <br>
of them 3-cycles on facecenters :D<br>

I can solve the cube in average of 2:20, using the layer-by-layer <br>

<br>
A good method to learn that&#x27;s pretty fast (times in the 30&#x27;s) and requires few <br>
sequences to learn (minimim 33) is the working corner/edge F2L method and <br>
a 3 look LL. The F2L allows you to save moves by not solving one corner. <br>
This can reduce your F2L times by a lot.<br>
The LL requires you to learn 30 sequences - 2 to orient the edges, 7 to orient <br>
the corners, and 21 to permute the entire LL.<br>
<br>
This is a very efficient method considering that you only need to learn 32 <br>
sequences and can get times around 30 seconds.<br>

I solve the cube the same way, I only know about 10 algorithims, but I&#x27;ve been working on it for a while and can solve it in about a minute on average. When you go to the different sites slowly incorporate different algortithims, and slowly  start solving another way, note even if you can&#x27;t solve it their way you can still learn new things.
 
I&#x27;m currently learning the lars method, I would love to learn the frindich method, or both lol keep practicing and examining your algorithim, and with time you should become a good cuber, I&#x27;ve only been cubing for about 7 months, have fun.

          <div class="email-content">although methodology has been pretty much done(even I
admit that): puzzle building, cube art, and cube
programming are wonderful areas to explore. I am in
full agreement with most posters to this thread.
However, not many have tapped into the lucrative 4th
dimension as of yet. Let&#x27;s hope that changes soon.

Hi, if it is the Rubik&#x27;s brand 2x2x2 then go to the photos section 
of the group and it is the folder called &quot;fix your 2x2x2.&quot;

<br>
Im sure cube art is veyr exciting.  Not aware of anyone esle who does it I&#x27;m afraid.  I think that there is still plenty of room for original discovery in both strategy and algorithms especially strategy.  I think they ar elinked though - as new strategies appear algorithms that fit those strategies take on new importance.<br>
Always on the look out for anything to do with cubes so if I spot any cube art I will certainly post.<br>

<br>
<br>
  Hi, Duncan,<br>
<br>
  I agree that seeking a new alg can be fun, but lot has been done in <br>
  speedcubing. The time for uriginal discovery in this  area was in <br>
  the 80s when Jessica and Lars were formulating  their strtegies.  If <br>
  you want to discover new things today, you should look into:<br>
  computer cubing <br>
  cbe code development<br>
  cube art.<br>
<br>
  I specilize in cube art. Drawing a picture of a Rubik&#x27;s cube is not <br>
  cube art, you musr actually use Rubik&#x27;s cube as art medium. I do <br>
  three dimensional stuctures, both cubical and non-cubical. The <br>
  website to look at is http://wwww.design.rubikscube.info .<br>
<br>
  I exhibited 3d designs in Toronto last yoer.I couldn&#x27;t compete, <br>
  because I had no rivals! No one could do it! I was thr only <br>
  exhibitor. I  left Toronto in a state of shock.<br>
<br>
  Would you, as a mathmatician, happen to know of anyone who can do <br>
  this? I have been asking this question  of bazzilion people. Only <br>
  one person answered yes. When I inquired after the name, he <br>
  replied:&quot;Hana bizek.&quot; :-)<br>
<br>
  Discovery IS fun, that&#x27;swhy we have math and science.<br>
  Hana a kostky<br>

In fact, any conjugate of a commutator is also a commmutator.

          <div class="email-content">I just bought one mini-5x5, one megaminx, and one special edition 5x5 <br>
from mefferts. <br>
The first thing that happened was that one ytellow tile came loose <br>
from the special edition 5x5. On my way to get the glue, one of the <br>
green tiles came loose, right in my hand, without force! (glue is <br>
still drying, further info is to come)<br>
Then I picked up the mini 5x5. Felt really good, and after some <br>
lubing, it solved smoothly. I wish. The center tile popped loose if I <br>
put even the slightest tension to the cubies. It popped just as <br>
easily back in place, but it disturbs the flow of the solve.<br>
The megaminx had paper stickers, they seem to peel really easily. <br>
Of course, this could be made by some moron not worthy to work at the <br>
mefferts factory. It could also be due to the cold and dry climate in <br>
Sweden this time of year. Nevertheless, in comparison to the <br>
rubiks.com cubes I&#x27;ve bought (like seven 3x3, three 5x5 and two 4x4) <br>
they really suck. <br>

          <div class="email-content">As for the mini 5x5x5, my stickers are slightly peeling, and I did have <br>
some problems with the center tiles popping off.  I followed Ton&#x27;s <br>
suggestions by making small dents in the edge of the center (the part <br>
that squeezes into place) and I have had absolutely no problem with them <br>
since then.  I silicone lubed it and that is probably what is messing up <br>
the stickers, but it also moves about 400% smoother than it did in the <br>
beginning.<br>

the recalling of long term memory for use. Try to
emulate the conditions that you were in while you
memorized the algorithms, and they should come easier.
And, upbeat music often helps dementia patients with
long term memory recognition, perhaps that would help
you though you arent really suffering from dementia to
my knowledge.

Thats great! Do u mean on the 4x4x4 ... hehe ...

A method with fast and intuitive 1st layer, middle edges by cleverly 
applying 3 cycles and 4 look LL should take u down to 40 sec average 
with a few weeks of hard practice. I can do about 30 secs that way :-
) I believe it&#x27;s possible to reach 30 secs with any method which is 
not &quot;deliberately more destructive than necessary&quot;. Quick recognition 
and execution is the key !!

Happy cubing !!

          <div class="email-content">It was a typo goof more than anything else. I know how to 
xpell &#x27;code&#x27; and spelled it correctly in the original message.

Also in te original message I named three fields that I feek have 
plenty of original odeas for fyerther development. Richard said that 
I claimed only cube art can spawn original  ideas. I was surprised 
that he missed those other disciplines.

As i type this message, I may be interrupted and sent to the 
desktop. So I cannot proofread it. I apologize beforehand for any 
typo goofs.

          <div class="email-content">Richard,

   When someone chews you out for not writing something and it is
clear that you did, &quot;Can you read?&quot; is a standard reply, and generally
is considered a mild reproof. Hana&#x27;s reply wasn&#x27;t spiteful or rude.
   In this case a stronger reproof is well deserved. 

   Perhaps she should have asked if you take the time to comprehend
what you read.

   If she was being rude she might have suggested that your parents
were siblings.

   Seriously though, how would you deal if someone&#x27;s disagreeing with
you showed that they totally missed the point of something you said?

   I don&#x27;t know how to deal with that to my satisfaction, but I *like*
Hana&#x27;s soft reply.

I think that one ought to estsablih a homomorphism between

present several different algorithms. This should be published in 
the form of an encyclopedia as a study in recreational math. Take 
CornersFirst, the strategy I am using. After describing it in words 
one should present ine set of algorithms, then another set of 
algorithms.... Each set would lead to a solution of the cube. Is 
that what you meant? Are Fridrich annd Petrus methods strategies by

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everyone!  I hope you all are doing well.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to let you know I fixed up my Cube Timer a little. <br>
It&#x27;s posted in the &quot;Files&quot; area. It now calculates a scrolling <br>
average of the last 12 times and provides a 25-move scrambling <br>
algorithm, as per the &quot;official rules&quot; proposed on speedcubing.com:<br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/records/records-rules.html#officialrules<br>
<br>
As before, this timer is very simple, but that&#x27;s the way I like it. <br>
Timing starts the moment that the space-bar is RELEASED, and stops <br>
the moment that the space-bar is DEPRESSED.  Your times are copied <br>
to the system clipboard in case you want to paste them into a text <br>
file.  Let me know if you encounter any problems.<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t been cubing much since the championship, because I&#x27;m <br>
trying to recover from Carpal Tunnel (which I got from typing at <br>
work, NOT from the cube!!!).  But sometimes time off is actually <br>
good for my average, assuming I don&#x27;t forget any algorithms.<br>

Happy Cubing!<br>

I applied your sugestions to the 5x5x5 and was able to supercube my <br>
professor&#x27;s cube!  Wow was that ever fun!  It is so cool finally to <br>
be able to manipulate all centerpieces without disturbing any edges!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t figure out your additional suggestions for <br>
3-cycling centerpieces on one face:<br>

*************************<br>
&quot;This is how to make the following facecenter 3 cycle : <br>
 (Urf =&gt; Ubr =&gt; Ulb) <br>
Use the following alg : (f&#x27;)[r&#x27;u&#x27;r,U](f)<br>
<br>
 Without doing (f&#x27;) first we would have had the following 3-cycle<br>
 instead : (Luf =&gt; Ubr =&gt; Ulb)&quot;<br>

**************************<br>

Maybe I am not executing it right but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work <br>

Hi, if it is the Rubik&#x27;s brand 2x2x2 then go to the photos section 
of the group and it is the folder called &quot;fix your 2x2x2.&quot;

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ...

Maybe u are not used to the 4x4x4 notation ? F,R,B,L,U,D denote 
front, right, back, left, top and bottom layers respectively. Now 
f,r,b,l,u and d are the layers just &quot;behind&quot; the previously mentioned 
layerss. E.g. from front to back on a 4x4x4 cube we have F,f,b and B 
layers, from left to right we have R,r,l and L, from Top to bottom we 
have U,u,d and D. f rotates the same way in space as F does. b same 
way as B does. While b rotates opposite way in space compared with 
what f does. And so on ...

Wrting out the &quot;face facecenter 3-cycle&quot; fully we get :

f&#x27;r&#x27;u&#x27;rUr&#x27;urU&#x27;f (10 slice moves)

I hope that u can see now how it works !!
(Put numbered stickers on the U facecenters to see how they get 
cycled.)

          <div class="email-content">Three things all coming under this thread - hope it isn&#x27;t too long a post for everyone!

1.  Cube art.  Hana isn&#x27;t it kind of unusual to impose definitions and conditions on an art medium?  Not a criticism and maybe I&#x27;m wrong after all I suppose its the medium you are defining and an oil painting isnt an oil painting unless its painted in oils!  I wondered whether you allow partly disassembled cubes or pieces of cubes?

2. The link between strategies and algorithms is kind of fuzzy but your thoughts are interesting.  In my original comment I was thinking that certain algorithms would be useless in some strategies but critical to others.  For example I have 6 different moves for finishing off my F2L by putting the DL edge into the RF middle edge position.  Each move affects the orientation of the DFL corner and DF edge differently thus ensuring that I always have at least one corner and two edges oriented when I reach the LL.  This reduces the number of OLL positions significantly.  Its not as efficient as Fridrich (but not by much) but it cuts down the learning.  For those interested the algs are:
  i.    R&#x27;DRDFD&#x27;F&#x27;
  ii.   R&#x27;DRF&#x27;RFR&#x27;
  iii.  R&#x27;DRD2FD2F&#x27;
  iv.  FD2F&#x27;DFDF&#x27;D&#x27;FD2F&#x27;
  v.   R&#x27;DRD&#x27;R&#x27;D&#x27;RD2F&#x27;RFR&#x27;
  vi.  R&#x27;DRDFDF&#x27;D&#x27;FD&#x27;F&#x27;
I guess my point is that not many people will be interested because although I was creative in producing the algorithms most are useless to other strategies.

3. I hate to get involved but as I was in this thread from the start I have to mention the ongoing argument between Hana and Richard.  BEHAVE!  I think both have overreacted.  I don&#x27;t think that Richard&#x27;s original comment that cube art is not the only area left was intended to be negative although I appreciate that Hana did mention some other areas.  I happen to think that finding new algorithms is still an area for creative thinking.  Since then it seems to have turned into a meltdown of bad feeling.  Please a little respect and empathy for each others feelings.

          <div class="email-content">>From a practical speedcubing point of view I also like to use longer 
moves that avoid stand-alone inner face turns when doing 3 cycles on 
the centers of the super 4x4x4 and 5x5x5.  For both cubes, whenever I 
cycle 3 centers on a face I haven&#x27;t yet solved the edges, so these 
moves don&#x27;t conserve the edge positions (in case anyone does edges 
first these moves wouldn&#x27;t be very helpful).

For the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5:

(Ll) (D&#x27;d&#x27;) [(L&#x27;l&#x27;) (R&#x27;r&#x27;)] (Dd) [(Rr) (Ll)] (D&#x27;d&#x27;) (L&#x27;l&#x27;) U (Ll) 
(D&#x27;d&#x27;) [(L&#x27;l&#x27;) (R&#x27;r&#x27;)] (Dd) [(Rr) (L&#x27;l&#x27;)] (D&#x27;d&#x27;) (L&#x27;l&#x27;)

There&#x27;s an optional U&#x27; at the end if you are concerned about the 
orientation of the center groups at this point.  The move looks 
really long but it goes fairly fast.  The moves inside brackets can 
be done together on the 4x4x4 in this cool double move twist thingy, 
heh heh so this move is nice on the 4x4x4.  For those bracket moves 
you&#x27;re rotating each of the Left and Right face groups (Ll) and (Rr) 
once in opposite directions at the same time.  It feels more like 
you&#x27;re doing a double turn on the cube by twisting the two face 
groups at once.  Anyway I have found that single slice moves don&#x27;t 
work well in speedcubing the larger cubes in general (for me at 
least), so I like this move for both cubes, though I usually use it 
mostly on the 5x5x5.  I know the move is by far not a very efficient 
3 cycle, but I find it can be performed fairly quickly this way.

For the 4x4x4:
This is the main alg I use for a U face 3 cycle on the 4x4x4, though 
there is probably a more efficient way to use this strategy.  
Basically, assuming you have yet to solve the edges, treat your 4x4x4 
with the messed up centers on the U face as a permutation on a 2x2x3 
cube.  So just do a 3 cycle as you would on the 2x2x3.  My alg is 
below, but there is probably a more efficient way to do it.

(R2r2) (D&#x27;d&#x27;) U (R2r2) U&#x27; (R2r2) (Dd) (R2r2) (D&#x27;d&#x27;) (R2r2) (Dd) (R2r2)

Again not as efficient, but it avoids stand alone inner face turns 
which I find helps if you&#x27;re interested in doing a 3 cycle for speed.

Congrats Rob on the super prof!  Definitely more fun than doing a 
normal 5x5x5 don&#x27;t you think?  If the super prof is this cool, I 
wonder what the super 11x11x11 would be like :-)

My two cents on the whole 3 cycle discussion,
Chris

Hi Per K,<br>
<br>
Thanks to your expanded notation I have now got the U face 3-cycle <br>
working.        f&#x27;r&#x27;u&#x27;rUr&#x27;urU&#x27;f (10 slice moves)<br>
<br>
I was initially confused by the abbreviated notation but I think <br>
that I now understand that too.     (f&#x27;)[r&#x27;u&#x27;r,U](f)<br>
<br>
Your 10 move 3-cycle is much more efficient than my previous <br>
technique of combining algs involving 2 faces(which took 22 moves).  <br>
<br>
Supercubing the prof cube is so fun.  It is very interesting to see <br>
how many algs which can be applied with impunity on the 3x3x3 and <br>
even on the 4x4x4 end up shifting the &#x27;center-edges&#x27; on the 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
Creating my own custom designed 3-cycles is so fun, I am only just <br>
beginning to scratch the surface.  I have a lot of info to learn, <br>
adapt and internalize.  Thanks for the tips that got me started!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chris,<br>
<br>
What is your solution path for the superprof?  I got the impression <br>
from your posting that you solve all the centers properly, then <br>
combine edges, then solve like a 3x3x3, then fix what has gone <br>
astray.  Is this right, or have you figured out a whole bunch of <br>
algs that preserve your centers all the way through?  (or am I just <br>
way off base?)  Personally, I solve 5 of the 6 center units <br>
perfectly.  White, then yellow, then 3 of the 4 remaining faces.  <br>
The last face is (obviously) monochrome but I don&#x27;t bother placing <br>
all tiles perfectly since some of my subsequent moves (when <br>
combining the last 4 edge triplets and PLL) sometimes displace <br>
centerpieces (esp those pesky center-edges!).  I therefore execute <br>
these algs on the imperfect face and just fix that one up at the <br>
end.  Any suggestions?  Any alternative solution paths?  <br>
<br>
I use two different solution paths for the super4 but I am still <br>
working out the finer points of the second path (an adaptation of <br>
Masayuki&#x27;s solution style).  It is really fun to solve a la F3L but <br>
I especially need to improve on my recognition and execution for the <br>
last layer edge pieces.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,

In the PLL, what I usually look for are blocks of pieces that have the same color.  It&#x27;s prety 
simple to tell the three-cycle permutation and the four-cycle ones where all you do is 
move around edges.  The other ones, such as &quot;V&quot; and &quot;A&quot; permutations (as classified on 
Fridrich&#x27;s webiste, I usually look for a corner with two edge pieces that match up.  Then, 
after seeing those, if I see another edge piece in place or two corner pieces having the 
same color, then I know it&#x27;s A.  If not, it&#x27;s &quot;V&quot;.  Other examples that I do, and remember, 
this is just a personal opinion, is for &quot;J&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, there will be a &quot;line&quot; or three cubes in a 
row with the same color.

Is this sufficient?  Does anyone else want to chip in?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Wow, this may be a bit early, but I figure since hopefully this <br>
competition will involve the most people, it&#x27;s best to get some <br>
discussion about it right now.<br>
<br>
Right now, the plan is to hold a competition in the summer which I <br>
would like to call the &quot;2004 US Championships&quot; and out of this <br>
competition, we would produce a &quot;US Champion&quot;.  (Of course, everyone <br>
around the world is invited.)  Anyway, if I get enough interest for <br>
this competition, let&#x27;s say over 50 cubers, then it would probably be <br>
best to hold the competition over a few days.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my questions to all of you.  How does late August sound?  Let&#x27;s <br>
say around the same time as the World Championships in Toronto last <br>
year?  Or does this conflict with people who go to schools on the <br>
semester system or... yeah.  Is there a problem for anyone?  If so, <br>
speak up.  I also intend to hold competitions for all of the other <br>
events such as one handed solving, Rubik&#x27;s Magic, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, <br>
blindfold solving, etc.<br>
<br>
A quick note... the prizes unfortunately would probably be just a few <br>
chrome cubes and the title of being the Official US Champion.  I&#x27;ll see <br>
what I can do about getting other prizes but I really see no way to get <br>
$5000 for a first place prize or $750 for other prizes.  But us <br>
speedcubers were never in it for the money right?!?<br>
<br>
To try and save money for everyone, I&#x27;m going to talk to the housing <br>
office and see how many rooms are open during the summer.  If it is <br>
indeed possible to let cubers stay in the student houses or other <br>
housing for the competition, I would estimate $15 a night.<br>
<br>
Anyway, please speak up.  After all, this is for all of you.  Hopefully <br>
it&#x27;ll be a great success.<br>

On the contrary, you are very much of a competitor if your time is at 1:07.  Check here for 
the results of our winter tournament:

http://www.speedcubing.com/events/caltech_jan2004.html

You would have been in the middle.  There&#x27;s absolutely no reason that you have to just sit 
on the sidelines.  Anyway, I&#x27;m a student at Caltech in Pasadena and the tournament would 
be held at Caltech most likely in Baxter Lecture Hall.

You are correct that an efficient and &quot;happy&quot; event takes a massive amount
of organisation and  time. If you have lots of events you need lots of
scramblers, lots of judges and it can all get out of control. From
experience it&#x27;s finding scramblers and judges who aren&#x27;t competing that is
the difficult bit (so if for any event anyone can offer their services it
will always be appreciated). Better to have less categories and a smoothly
running event than lots of categories where everybody feels a bit
disgruntled as it&#x27;s all too slow.
Personally I think a US event should be US only. In the same way that the
European Championship is for Europeans, of course all of the Rubik&#x27;s family
are welcome to attend but only Europeans can compete. 
Maybe us Euro&#x27;s who&#x27;d like to be there can be judges/scramblers  and US
competitors who would like to come to Amsterdam can reciprocate ?!

          <div class="email-content">Count me in (but that probably went without saying).  One idea for 
this competition and others:  In Toronto, the top 32 times advanced 
to the 2nd round and in Cal Tech it was the top 12.  I know this 
format has advantages but what do you guys think of setting 
qualifying times to advance to the next round? ie anyone who solves 
in less than 30 seconds moves to the 2nd round...anyone with a solve 
under 20 seconds in the 2nd round moves on to the finals.  The times 
would of course be a function of the number (and reputation) of the 
competitors.  Perhaps a combination of the current format and this 
idea would work?

It might work with WINE - I haven&#x27;t tried it.  The timer is located 
in the files section of this group.  If you get a chance to try it, 
let us know how it works!

Oh, and I think that it should be open to people all over the world

  If you go here: http://www.superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm that&#x27;s <br>
the main website.  They have a downloadable version for both windows <br>
and Linux, but the linux version is far more flexible (you can do a <br>
5x5x5x5 and a 6x6x6x6, and up).  The overall concept isn&#x27;t that <br>
different from a regular cube though.  I think the reason that there <br>
aren&#x27;t as many people listed as having solved it just because the <br>
puzzle isn&#x27;t nearly as well known as some.<br>
<br>
Give it a shot though, it&#x27;s quite fun!<br>

          <div class="email-content">No, that would certainly not be *racist*. It would be racist to 
exclude Asian ppl in the US for example. But I think it is perfectly 
ok to have *regional/national* compition open to only that region or 
nation. Oh and I agree with Hayes, late August would be bad. 
Sometime a bit earlier would be nice, say the beginning of August. 
On the other hand not too early either, we all need time to 
practice. I know I have slowed down a lot since school started. Even 
if it does end up conflicting with school, I would still try to come.

Also, at first glance I thought it is a bit unfair to have it on a 
far side of the country and not somewhere in the middle, like 
Chicago or something. But then I realize that lots of CA ppl came 
all the way to Toronto last year, and besides I&#x27;d really love to 
visit the Caltech campus.

          <div class="email-content">Just to reply to a few of the issues that have come up:

I definitely hear you on the &quot;earlier/beginning of August/middle of July&quot; to avoid college 
conflicts.  I think that&#x27;s a good idea.  Caltech itself starts in late September so I sometimes 
forget that schools start late August and things like that.  I will definitely hold the 
competition middle July or early August to accommodate that unless there are people out 
there that MUST have it late August.

As for being regional and not allowing people outside of the US, I&#x27;d like to go to the 
example of the &quot;American Regions Mathematics League&quot; competition.  In this competition, 
foreign teams such as Taiwan and Singapore are invited but they do not compete for the 
same top prize.  Instead, there is a seperate prize for top finishing international team.  
This would perhaps allow us to still crown a US champion and allow anyone from around 
the world the join.

As for being unfair on the west coast, if someone else wants to hold it in the middle of the 
country, sure.  Actually, Chris Hardwick and I were thinking of holding a regional 
competition jointly next year.  Something like the US Regional Championships in 2005 so 
there would be two competitions that go on at the same time at two different venues, one 
the west coast and one on the east coast.  If someone in the middle wants to get 
something up, of course we&#x27;re all for it.  But I guess for now, unless someone else wants to 
start up something, I hope a trip to the west coast isn&#x27;t too far out of the way?  I&#x27;ll try to do 
everything I can to minimize your expenses during the trip.

The reminds me, the &quot;ARML&quot; math competition is held simultaneously at three different 
venues across the united states.  I don&#x27;t really see it as feasible for this summer

it easier for people to travel.  Plus, it&#x27;d be kind cool to meet everyone in person for the 
summer.

Why not try superhypercubing (or supertesseracting, I suppose)?

Are there any programs out there which will do equivalents of the 
cube in n dimensions where n>4? (Or possibly even, for n infinite, 
assuming a scramble of possibly infinite length, or possibly even 
fractional (if that makes sense)! Here, some sort of solving 
strategy would be useful - I suppose that in the current way of 
solving, one would solve an infinite cube in w^2.6 moves - if one 
does centres last - or w^2.6+w.12 if one does edges last - assuming 
corners and central edges done first, w^2.6+w.12+n, for some n 
otherwise. Here w (omega really) is the first infinite ordinal. By 
suitably changing strategy, one could possibly reduce the solution 
to length w - obviously, there&#x27;s a way to do it, but I mean in by 
means of strategy rather than bijection, so in some predetermined 
algorithmic way. That seems slightly less obvious.)

Also, on the subject of cube programs, is there an equivalent of 
CubeExplorer for Macs? 
(I mean that will optimally solve, since it appears that Cubetwister 
does not. : ( )

Hi, everyone,

I would like to propose a solution to the problem of &quot;US Champion&quot;

The fractional part is fun.
The rest is serious on some level. w.12 means w times 12 (the same 
as w+w+w+w+w+w+w+w+w+w+w+w) - this is somewhat more than 12.w (12 
times w) which is only equal to w. (w here being the first infinite 
ordinal. I was only meaning cubes of length w, but I suppose larger 
cubes could also be considered.)
w^2 means w times w. Since w.12+w^2.6=w^2.6&lt;w^2.6+w.12, the length 
of solution would be less if you do the centres last.
The estimates are from each edge taking approximately type w moves 
to solve and each centre taking approximately type w^2 moves to 
solve. Of course, if not supercubing then solving 5 centres solves 
the last automatically so that w^2.6 could be improved to w^2.5.
By altering the order of moves you could also produce a solution in 
type w, but whether this is possible from an algorithmic point of 
view, I don&#x27;t know.

          <div class="email-content">Mid-July or early August would be the best for me.  I take classes 
during the summer to try to lighten the load of doing a double 
major, and so holding the competition closer to August, or even 
early August works for me.  I don&#x27;t know if I am in the minority 
here, but if there are other people who take summer classes then it 
might be better to shoot for mid-July or early August, though I 
don&#x27;t know how other schools schedule their classes.  Does anyone 
who takes summer classes have a conflict with mid-July or August?  
Also if I&#x27;m the only one with a summer class commitment please don&#x27;t 
schedule around me, I&#x27;ll find a way to get there regardless of when 
its held.

Just my two cents, in case there are others in the same boat here as 
well.

          <div class="email-content">I could do an east coast competition in the spring or summer, and 
could probably make it out to the west coast for a summer 
competition as long as I had enough advance notice.

I like Ian&#x27;s suggestion about qualifying times, at least for the 
early rounds.   (How&#x27;s it going Ian?)

One other idea... Someone&#x27;s post said that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to 
get any big prizes for their competition.  Just charge some sort of 
application fee for the event, which can go toward prizes.  The 
other thing an entry fee does is make people commit to coming or not 
coming... when there is no entry fee, EVERYONE says they&#x27;re coming!  
And if the entry fee is structured so that it goes up on a certain 
date, it encourages people to enter by that date.  I used to direct 
a 10-mile run with 2,000 runners, and we&#x27;d have the entry fee go up 
the week before the T-shirt order had to go in, to try to get as 
many people as we could entered before that time.  It took some of 
the guesswork out of ordering shirts.

I can solve the rubik&#x27;s cube layer-by layer in average of 0:50 (my 
best mark with this method is 0:37). I think that if you want solve 
the cube quickly, you need a good Rubik&#x27;s Cube. If you learn another 
method (I also use Fridich&#x27;s method) you could solve it faster but if 
you solve your cube in 2:20 layer by layer I think that you cannot 
solve it in less than 1:00 with a new method

          <div class="email-content">David Salvia had a cube with tiles at the Winter Competition.  They seem okay.. though i 
personally prefer the feel of stickers.  The stickers that come with the rubiks.com cube are 
horrible.  The plastic starts to peel and soon, well, you&#x27;ve got a mess.  You can buy 
replacement stickers online and those are quite good.  They don&#x27;t peel and they look 
beautiful.  I believe it&#x27;s $5 for a set for three cubes.

Just buy the stickers online.  They&#x27;re very high quality.  Before I knew about the stickers, I 
went to the local hardware store and bought electrical tape.  It wears off about once every 
three weeks but it&#x27;s nice and cheap.  Your biggest problem will probably be the residue 
that the old stickers leave behind.  I suggest using tape and pressing it on the faces and it 
will take off the residue.  I tried goo gone my first time... this citrus cleaning stuff?  It 
worked, but the cube smelled quite bad for a bit of time.

As for a favorite cube, I currently have a rubiks.com cube though I&#x27;m working in some of 
Ton&#x27;s studio cubes.  (Ack, cuber&#x27;s thumb!)  Anyway, your cube can turn just as smoothly as 
the ones on the videos.  It just requires a lot of working in and tuning and lubrication and 
sanding down rough spots and all the bells and whistles and... basically, it just takes time.  
Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t just go out and buy a perfect speed cube.  It&#x27;s kinda like a light 
saber... they make the jedi make his own or something.   i dunno, I&#x27;m not exactly the star 
wars guru.

I think that&#x27;s pretty much it?

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the explanation. I don&#x27;t know enough about infinities to 
fully understand it, but I think I understand what you&#x27;re saying. One 
thing that confused me was the &#x27;.&#x27;, btw. You use that as a 
multiplication symbol, right? I use &#x27;*&#x27; for that, so I couldn&#x27;t even 
parse &quot;w.12&quot; and read your other expression as w^(2.6). Now it makes

Hi Daniel,

   The Revenge, 4x4x4, came in the cardboard boxes with the clear
plastic around them in 1982. I have one. I want one from Hong Kong,
but the one I have is from Taiwan. Oh well... :(

Hi Chris,

   In 1980 Ideal produced the Deluxe cubes, most of them with plastic
tiles, a few with stickers. The cube&#x27;s plastic is hard and slick and
durable. In 1982 Ideal made &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Game&quot; containing the Deluxe cube
with peg holes in the plastic tiles. Both of these models are terrific
 cubes and take very well to lubrication.

   You can see Macky&#x27;s 12.28 second solve F2 R2 D L R B&#x27; F D&#x27; B R2 D2
L D L R&#x27; F&#x27; B2 D U R2 D&#x27; R B2 L&#x27; D2 on one of my Deluxes:

          <div class="email-content">About an hour ago I solved a Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded for the first <br>
time in my life.<br>
<br>
I learned most of the method a month or two ago, and I never had any <br>
trouble keeping 40 numbers memorized, but lost interest after I <br>
realized how impossible the Edge Permutation step seemed to me. It <br>
made no sense to me, and I couldn&#x27;t even do that step with my eyes <br>
opened at the time.<br>
<br>
But today after a short conversation with Ron Van Bruchem, I <br>
suddenly became very interested in this again. I learned 1 new <br>
algorithm and had a sudden revelation regarding the nature of edge <br>
orientation, and suddenly I was able to permute edges blindfolded. <br>
That was the only step I was previously unable to complete.<br>
<br>
So I did a trial run with the edge permutation step alone, and took <br>
my blindfold off after about 30 minutes to a fully solved Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Cube on my first try. I was SO happy to have done that, but the <br>
feeling really didn&#x27;t even compare to doing the entire thing <br>
blindfolded.<br>
<br>
A few minutes after doing edge permutation for the first time, I <br>
scrambled the cube up and memorized it while watching HBO. After I <br>
was confident that I wouldn&#x27;t forget any of what I had memorized, I <br>
turned the TV off, got my blindfold on, and immediately started <br>
manipulating the cube.<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t time myself. What seemed like about 1 hour later though, I <br>
performed the final algorithm (MD2M&#x27;D2) and nervously pulled the <br>
blindfold down around my neck, to be staring at a fully solved <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube.<br>
<br>
Anything I could write about how amazing it felt would just be an <br>
understatement. Just PURE JOY. :)<br>
<br>
Like Chris Hardwick once said, this is easily 100x more addictive <br>

<br>
I&#x27;m really impressed with myself for having nailed it on my first <br>
try. Can&#x27;t WAIT to do this infront of my family, and I look forward <br>
to working my times down to around 10 minutes. :)<br>
<br>
A few bits of advice that really helped me with edge permutation, <br>
for any aspiring blindfold cubers...<br>
<br>
Whichever 2 faces you set as &quot;highest priority&quot; for your edge <br>
orientation (white and yellow for most people), complete those 2 <br>
slices first when you start permuting edges. It&#x27;s relatively simple <br>
to do this, and once both sides are solved you&#x27;re left with an even <br>
simpler series of 3-edge cycles (using the MD2M&#x27;D2 algorithm) <br>
through the middle-slice to complete the cube.<br>
<br>
Take your time in both memorizing and solving the cube. Once you <br>
perform an algorithm, figure out exactly how all the cubes moved <br>
around, and spend a minute or two re-memorizing the cube as that new <br>
set of numbers, before moving on to your next move.<br>
<br>
Practice doing the whole method with your eyes open, and get <br>
yourself to where you can solve it that way without thinking about <br>
it too much, before moving on to blindfolded practice/solving.<br>
<br>
Sorry for this longwinded post, I&#x27;m just really really excited right <br>
now. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Congrats on your first ever blindfolded solve!  As I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve 
seen it only takes practice and dedication to get it for the first 
time.  Still, that is definitely a very impressive feat nontheless 
and congratulations!

Also Michael, after reading your post, if I may offer some advice 
for people who don&#x27;t like all the memorization involved in BD 
solving.  For all you people who already solve BD I aparently use a 
method similar to Dror Vomberg, as he gave me lots of ideas at the 
WC on how to do BD solving, which influenced how I created my 
method.  So anyway instead of memorizing the cube soley as 4 
different strings of numbers (edge/corner orienation; edge/corner 
positions), I like to mix it up a little.  Here&#x27;s how I do each,

Edge orientation: I memorize this as strings of numbers, 3 groups of 
4 numbers, one for the U layer, D layer, and middle layer.

Corner orientation: I&#x27;m still learning algs for this, but I have 
algs that flip multiple corners at once so I just memorize this 
spatially by picturing a cube in my head and memorizing where the 
corner pairs are.  If there any single corners in a position that I 
don&#x27;t have an alg for, I memorize their orientation separately as 
numbers, but I still do this spatially by picturing a cube in my 
head, and where the corners are on that cube.

Edge positions:  I memorize this as a string of numbers, 3 groups of 
4 for the U layer, D layer, and middle layer.  What helps for me to 
keep these straight in my head is to not only memorize the strings 
of number but use spatial associations to give me a &quot;backup&quot; in case 
I forget a number in the string.  For example I number the edges 1 
through 12 based on my defined &quot;correct&quot; position.  Say the four 
edges in the top layer are UB=5, UL=7, UR=1, UF=9 then my number 
string would be 5,7,1,9 which I would also try to think of as 57,19 
as one form of &quot;backup&quot;.  My spatial associations would be that 
going from UB to UL diagonally I add 2, then I slide over to UR and 
drop all the way down to the lowest numbered edge (helpful for the 
edges 1 and 12 since they are on the extremes) then after that I 
slide over diagonally to UF which is 2 more than UL.  So I have a 
triangle of UB, UL, and UF where I add 2 each time, and the UR edge 
is an outsider in that it is the lowest number edge on the face, and 
also on the whole cube.

Giving yourself several &quot;backup&quot; ways to memorize the numbers helps 
especially when doing the cube BD in front of people.  I often 
forget portions of my number strings under pressure, but if I 
remember that going from UL to UF, for example, means I only add 
two, then I can figure out the edge at UF if I forget it.

Corner positions:
This is one thing that REALLY helped me to improve my success rate 
for BD solving.  I used to memorize the corner positions as numbers 
also, using the same strategies as for the edges, but I often mixed 
up my spatial associations for the corners with those for the 
edges.  What I do now is to memorize the corners as letters.  The 
corners are lettered A through H and I form words out of their 
positions.  For example say the 4 corners in the top (moving from 
UBL to UBR to UFL to UFR) are B H F D.  I would memorize this 
as &quot;Brown Hairy FooD&quot;, or possibly &quot;Big Honkin&#x27; FaD&quot;, nonesense 
phrases like that.  I used to listen to those improve your memory 
tapes, and they highly recommend memorizing something in a funny or 
silly way so that it is easier to recall.  When memorizing the 
corners I try to find a funny or silly phrase, then picture a 
scenario in my head that goes along with it as my &quot;backup&quot;.  So if I 
forget my phrase, I can fall back on my picture and try to remember 
what the phrase was.  So for B H F D I would picture a really old 
steak that has turned brown with fuzzy mold on it, or a really weird 
new outfit that everyone on the streets is wearing.  Once I remember 
the phrase, I remember the letters and thus where the corners are.

Another reason I think it helps to memorize the edges and corners 
differently, is that after having done the edge permutation step, 
and having dealt with numbers so much in your head, it is easier to 
recall your silly picture, then your silly phrase to find the corner 
positions than to try to say &quot;ok wow... I just dealt with lots of 
numbers... Now what were all the numbers for the corners??&quot;
--------

So anyway that was a really long post, but to make a long story 
short, to help with memorizing give yourself as many &quot;backup&quot; ways 
to memorize something as you can.  This can still be done quickly, 
and allows you to solve for speed.  I don&#x27;t know if the BD pros do 
this, but I personally find it useful.  It improves your accuracy at 
least, if not your speed.

My two cents on ways to help for memorizing the cube,

Chris

          <div class="email-content">I didn&#x27;t use any texts at all, other than for learning the method to 
memorizing the cube as a string of numbers, and how to orient edges 
(which lead to a lot of confusion)...

In my experience the guides available online have been really 
lacking and difficult to follow. Could just be me, though.

Richard Carr has his method linked on one of his records in the 
Blindfold records page at speedcubing.com though.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks! :)

This is kind of odd but your and mine method to memorizing corner 
orientation, edge orientation, and edge positions are pretty much -
exactly- alike. Slightly different progression (for example on edge 
permutation I go UF to UL to UB to UR for 1 2 3 and 4), but other 
than that, pretty much exactly alike.

I use numbers for the corner permutation, but I do sometimes have a 
little difficulty and get it mixed up with one of my EP layers. I 
think I&#x27;m gonna start trying your method to CP. No reason to use so 
many numbers when you&#x27;ve got the whole alphabet available. :)

Thanks for the tips.

          <div class="email-content">Does anyone solve blindfold now other than by memorising the cube using a string of numbers?  My friend John White who held the world record from the early 80s just used to memorise the patterns and whenever I have solved blindfolded that is what I have done too.  I am guessing that the number method is easier but perhaps it depends how visual your memory is.  Maybe Michael you should just try picturing the the patterns if you dont like numbers.  This is much more the way that chessplayers work - and I believe Go players although I don&#x27;t have so much experience of that.

Congratulations to any who succeed it is well worth the effort.

          <div class="email-content">hello

I uses to visualy memorize the cube, each piece where it should go 
and then the next piece there it should go until I rech my first 
piece and that all there is to it.
Doing that, I can memorize the cube in about 90 sec and solve it 
also in that time.
This however require a lot of practice, but not more than 
speedsolving a cube.
It seems that memorizing using numbers or letters takes a lot of 
time and it&#x27;s therefor time cosumer for speed BD because you need to 
first convert the pieces to numbers/letters for the memorizing and 
then in the solving state to convert the other way, and It&#x27;s just 
too long for me ( the first time I solved BD it took me 1 hour for 
the whole proccess and then I changes the memorizing system and 
found that I memorized it and solved it in 8 min).

Does anybody else memorize it like that?

record from the early 80s just used to memorise the patterns and 
whenever I have solved blindfolded that is what I have done too.  I 
am guessing that the number method is easier but perhaps it depends 
how visual your memory is.  Maybe Michael you should just try 
picturing the the patterns if you dont like numbers.  This is much 
more the way that chessplayers work - and I believe Go players 
although I don&#x27;t have so much experience of that.

          <div class="email-content">Hello!

It&#x27;s d same here in Norway.

I think most ppl here in this group get their supply of cubes from 
shops selling online. There are basically 3 shops u should consider.

www.rubikshop.com (also called Hessport or Rubiks.com) sell good 
cubes shipped from USA, but they take a while to break in. Price is 
about $22 for the 4x4x4 cube and $30 for the 5x5x5.

Then there is www.puzzle-shop.de selling the so-called eastsheen 
cubes and many other puzzles. The eastsheen ones moves very smoothly 
from the start, but are also famous for not being forgiving wrt 
mislaignment. So it is hard to &quot;cut corners&quot; with it. The eastsheen 
ones are also smaller than the others and very light.

Finally there is www.mefferts.com. They also sell the eastsheen cubes 
but call them &quot;mini-cubes&quot; and also other varieties of cubes, 
including 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. I have bad experience with the meffert 
5x5x5. After a while it becomes so loose that pieces are prone to 
falling off. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to glue the screws holding 
the face centers, maybe it is...

Note also that meffert 5x5x5 and the eastsheen cubes come in other 
colors than the most usual white/yellow, green/blue, red/orange 
configuration. But u can buy fairly good stickers from 
www.rubikshop.com.

A last option is to buy cubes from Ton Dennenbroek. His site is 
available from www.speedcubing.com/ton. At least he sells 
old &quot;original&quot; 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, but a bit more expensive than the 
other alternatives. He also sells good 3x3x3 speed cubes and original 
Arxon ones also.

Many ppl consider eastsheen is best for 5x5x5, www.rubikshop.com is 
best for 4x4x4 and prepared speedcubes from Ton are best for 3x3x3. 
So as u see u have quite a few options :D

difficult to get it to look good, but the polish holds up well and 
is just as bright as the day I put it on.

          <div class="email-content">Hello cube-boy and Chris Taylor,
 
Painting the cube is a good idea. I&#x27; ve had my cube for almost a year now, and it&#x27;s been painted for half the time. I got the tip from Ian Winokur who let me borrow some of the nail polish he had bought to paint his cube. 

It looks best if you take the stickers off the cube before you paint it. Before I painted my cube, I washed off the gunk from the stickers so that the paint wouldnt look bumpy. Make sure you get really BRIGHT colors, because it will look a little darker after it dries. It&#x27;s algo good to give it at least 2 coats so that you cant see the black from the cube showing through. Oh yeah, make sure you follow the same color scheme, because you might forget all about it while painting, and end up with something you dont like. Last thing I&#x27;d have to say is to give it plenty of time to dry, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with fingerprints all over your cube lol. I&#x27;ve never tried any other paints, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m sure its cheaper to get 6 different colors of nail polish.
 
Have fun painting!

          <div class="email-content">My experience with it has been completely different from everybody 
else&#x27;s.

I got my first solve after like no practice at all, I just kind 
jumped right into being able to do it. I&#x27;d say a little practice 
here and there for 3 days, then I took a long break from it, then 
the day I picked it back up (yesterday) I was able to do it after a 
couple hours of studying.

I seem to be progressing quicker than most people, too, as far as 
times go. I&#x27;m not sure though. I just got a 32 minute time 
(including memorization)

Personally I don&#x27;t think using a 2x2x2 is such a great stepping 
stone... just use your 3x3x3 and practice doing the corners.

I think that it is probably an early draft though. A better link is 
in the link section of this group (it&#x27;s a pdf file). Even that is a 
pretty basic method compared to some of my later drafts though 
(although these later methods are rather too complicated for me to 
learn), notably BCFTSS (which is all but finished) and BCFSSS (which 
is a work in progress, which I probably have no chance of ever 
finishing).

1. How old are you?<br>
<br>
In my 4th decade, which probably makes me sad (in terms of cubing).<br>
<br>
2. What is your gender?<br>
<br>
Male<br>
<br>
3. If you start with a specific color on your<br>
cube, which color do you chose?<br>
<br>
White if I can see it.<br>
<br>
4. How many standard 3x3 cubes do you own?<br>
<br>
Not sure - 4, I guess (but only 3 of them are my colour scheme, so I <br>
don&#x27;t get to use the other).<br>
<br>
5.  How many years have you been solving them<br>
(round your answers if need be)?<br>
<br>
First time probably 19 or so years ago but I had a gap of several <br>
years.<br>
<br>
6. What method do you use to solve the cube?<br>
<br>
A rather limited form of Fridrich (sighted) or of Carr (unsighted).<br>
<br>
7. What country are you from? United Kingdom<br>
<br>
8.  Did you compete in the 2003 World Championship in Toronto?<br>
<br>
No - they cancelled what I was mainly going to go for, so there was <br>
no point.<br>

I bought the vinyl stickers from Rubik&#x27;s.
Disapointment.

They are too thin (makes them darker on black plastic). Orange and
brown are similar.

          <div class="email-content">So they are definitely a bit thin and yes, the black plastic does kind of make the colors a 
bit darker.  I guess that is the downside, the colors aren&#x27;s as bright.  Though... I thought

now that you bring it up, I may try to make a completely symmetrical

I&#x27;m 18, female.<br>
I tend to start with blue, but I&#x27;m trying to start with better placed pieces more and more.<br>
I own 2 cubes, but have another one coming in the mail.  I only use one of mine.<br>
I&#x27;ve only been solving the cube since December.  I was waiting for someone to wake up one day and decided I&#x27;d solve his unsolved cube sitting on the shelf...<br>
I started learning to solve the cube with a layer by layer method.  I&#x27;m learning Lars&#x27; method right now and shopping around for other methods...<br>
I&#x27;m from the USA... going to art school in Savannah, GA.<br>
I didn&#x27;t even know such things existed when the competition was going on.  : (<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m currently working on a series of plates in my etching class based on the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  Anyone interested in seeing my lastest print is welcome to email me or track me down on AIM: GirlofBirkenau.  Also, take a look at some of Sol LeWitt&#x27;s work... He&#x27;s a 20th century Minimalist artist, who has a healthy obsession with the cube.  His installation work is incredible.<br>

Long time no post, I still get all of the emails everyday and read almost all of them.  I just have not felt very motivated to respond until now, with the recent submission of JessicaNP@...&#x27;s post.  It happened to catch my eye.<br>
<br>
<br>
So Jessica,<br>
<br>
I am attending Purdue University studying Art Education, Fine Arts with a 2D emphasis and Art History.  Do you go to the school of design down there?? I&#x27;ve heard its beautiful to say the least.  I am also taking an etching class this semester and so far its not as fun as I thought it would be.  The process of printing the plates drives me nuts.  I can never keep everything clean.  Anyways, I hope your cubing goes well.<br>
<br>
While I&#x27;m here, any of you cubers who also rock climb, have you found your cubing performance suffer because of your constant raw fingertips.  I am climbing 6 days a week and its almost painful to cube now... :(  <br>
<br>
Anyways, everyone have a great monday morning,<br>

Yep, I go to SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design).  I&#x27;m currently a painting major... though not taking it too seriously... I&#x27;m really in it for the learning right now... not so much the degree.  Savannah&#x27;s a pretty town on a nice day.  It&#x27;s a bit more dangerous than most people anticipate though.<br>
I&#x27;m really enjoying etching... I recently started using solar plates.  They are fantastic... No acids or resists involved.  Plus, you can get much cleaner results.  I actually have been doing my cube series in Adobe Illustrator... Delicious, perfect vector-based program.  And this is coming from someone who really hates &quot;computer art.&quot;  : )<br>

          <div class="email-content">Whatever colors I have, I think it&#x27;s just getting used to them for me.  You&#x27;ve got a good 10 
seconds on my average so I doubt I &quot;look ahead&quot; in the F2L as much as you and that&#x27;s 
probably when the colors are the most important because the cube is spinning fast and 
you have to be able to pick out the color of the sticker in a very short period of time.  My 
biggest problems are also with red and orange on a rubik&#x27;s.com cube but it&#x27;s usually only 
a problem when the lighting isn&#x27;t good.

I say all in all, the replacement stickers are satisfactory for me.  I don&#x27;t think they would 
make my time go down if I practiced with them for a bit and had good lighting.  2 seconds 
is a lot for someone at your level!

Out of curiosity, has anyone tried cubing under a low-pressure sodium lamp?  Those are 
the lamps they use to light streets with the yellow glow and everything... white and yellow 
look the same and everything else looks black!

<br>
22<br>
<br>

<br>
Male<br>

you chose?<br>
<br>
white, mostly<br>

<br>
just one and have just ordered a 4x4x4 and a 5x5x5 cube.<br>
<br>

need be)?<br>
<br>
couple of months<br>
<br>
6. What method do you use to solve the cube?<br>
<br>
a slow layers method, am working on learning fridrich method.  I <br>
already use some of the algorithms in my method so should be easy <br>
enough to intergrate the rest.  Am pleasently surprised at how much <br>

Hi Jon,

Thanks for the feedback.  I just uploaded a new version with those 
features.  Before, you had to use the &quot;Backspace&quot; key, not 
the &quot;Delete&quot; key.  Now they both work.

Blindfold Cubing For The Seriously Sad - it&#x27;s sort of an intermediate 
level (with BCFSSS an advanced level). BCFTSS is the one that you 
(and a few others) have seen, but BCFSSS hasn&#x27;t been seen by anyone 
else yet (though I have given some algorithms from it to Dave). It&#x27;s 
super-advanced, but I haven&#x27;t done a pdf file of it yet as it is in 
progress. 
Currently it includes things like a) orient all corners in one b) 
orient all edges in one c) place all corners in one and place edges 
in two, but I&#x27;ve been looking at combining stages a) and b) and also 
placing edges in 1 would be preferable. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m going to 
have to take a sabbatical from it now as I recently moved and no 
longer have access to CubeExplorer and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any 
optimization programs for Macs.

Ironically, colours are pretty important in blindfold cubing! If they 
are similar and the light is dim then the memorization stage can be 
tough. Anyone who has seen my painted cubes can testify to that 
(green, orange and yellow all look a bit similar in dim light.)

i have all four size cubes sitting on my desk at work.  and everyone 
comments on the 2x2 cube and says something to the effect of &quot;i can 
probably only solve *that* one.&quot;  but when they pick it up and try, 
they soon find out they can&#x27;t solve that one either...  at that 
point they&#x27;re really turned off to cubing.

          <div class="email-content">hey your times in the low 20s are great for being in front of people.

my average is around 30s.  people are more impressed by the fact 
that i can solve it at all than they are about how fast they see me 
do it.

i have a very slow methodical solving style-- 2 moves per second 
very slow and consistent.  and i solve in about 60 moves.  when 
people see me do it in 30s, their reaction is always &quot;wow you can 
solve it&quot; rather than &quot;wow that was fast&quot;.

to be honest, i think people would be more impressed watching me if 
i solved it in 120 moves at 4 moves/sec rather than 60 moves at 2 
moves/sec.

impressing people is a fickle business.

          <div class="email-content">You should be able to get more than 1 every couple of days, i&#x27;d say <br>

Practice and/or get a better method.  When you start getting into the 
faster times less than 2 minutes that&#x27;s when small things really 
matter, such as finger tricks and stuff.  But I might not know what 
I&#x27;m talking about, I average 65 seconds.

What method do you use?  And regardless of method PRACTICE!  i&#x27;ve 
been at it for about 2 years now and I&#x27;m down around 27s, nowhere 
close to the uber cubers around here.

I came up with my own method for solving the cube
Its really hard to explain my method it took me two weeks to come up 
with and everyone i&#x27;ve tried to explain it to could not even 
understand the top layer i guess this could mean one of two things 
either i think to much into it or i am a lousy teacher or maybe both

Okay, I average around 56 seconds. So here are a few
suggestions on bettering your time:

step 1 - PRACTICE, the more you practice the easier
algorithms come to you and the faster you become
step 2 - analyse and improve on your method. If you
get bored with your method...that means its time to go
out and integrate more efficient algorithms into it.
Then you will have a time jump (8 seconds or so) and
get excited into continuing your practicing. 
step 3 - reduce delay between algorithms - this can
mean looking ahead or moving from a 4 look LL to a 2
look. reducing the amount of delays helps just as much
as reducing the extent of your delays.
step 4 - bionic eyes/arms help A LOT!!! just look at
the best cubers (fridrich, Knights, Petrus) ALL use
bionic implementations (that they hide wonderfully)
and get amazing times. [jk]
step 5 - murdering other cubers...the less
competition, the better you look.
-K-

          <div class="email-content">What method do you use? If it&#x27;s an inefficient method, then my advice 
would be *not* to practice it, but rather focus your efforts on 
learning a good method, or at least a method that can be expanded 
into a good method (eg. Fridrich method with a 4-look or 3-look last 
layer, which can later be developed into a 2-look last layer).

Back in the 80s before speedcubers lived on the internet, I learnt an 
inefficient method. I didn&#x27;t know at the time, so was using this 
method for years. By the time I realised my method was bad, the 
algorithms were so entrenched in my head that it was quite difficult 
to move to a different method. So, I&#x27;d recommend switching to a good 
method now before the bad method gets too entrenched in your head.

So, your next question is probably &#x27;what is a good method&#x27;? Well, 
there are many. As a minimum you should probably check out the 
Fridrich method (http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html), 
the Petrus method (http://lar5.com/cube/) and a Corners First method 
(perhaps a corners first speedcuber could suggest a good site?). 

These three are all excellent methods and can all be used to achieve 
world class times. Obviously it take lots and lots of work to get 
world class times (eg. sub-20s) but you&#x27;d be surprised how soon you&#x27;d 
get from 3-5 minutes down to 1 minute.

I don&#x27;t think that any single method is objectively the *best*, but I 
do think that certain methods will suit certain people&#x27;s brains 
better. For example, I&#x27;ve experimented with the Petrus and the 
Fridrich method and found that the Fridrich method just seemed 
to &#x27;click&#x27; with my brain much better. I don&#x27;t actually know too much 
about Corners First methods, but there are many very fast cubers who 
use this method which is proof enough for me that it is also a good 
method.

BTW, I use a simplified version of the Fridrich method (3-look LL 
instead of 2-look LL) and average around the 45s.

If you tell us your current method we could probably tell you which 
one of the efficient methods is most similar to your current method.

Good luck!  :)

Jasmine.

Most of us use silicone spray, which can be purchased from any

silicone spray, and not something petroleum-based like WD40. 
Petroleum-based sprays will kill your cube!

Congrats on beating your average!  :)

I use Olive oil often as it is around the kitchen when I decide to lube.  It
works pretty well but especially with my rubiks.com cube it tends to make
the outside slippery for a day or so.  My old Ideal cube seems better.

I explained pretty thoroughly how I do this in a post a little over a <br>

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/8476 to <br>
read it.  Basically - nail polish.  If you do it right, it looks <br>
great and will probably outlast the cube.<br>
<br>
Another idea I&#x27;ve had is to put the clearcoat over existing stickers <br>
when I get a cube, to keep them from wearing out.  I&#x27;m not sure if <br>
that would work, though.  If it does, you&#x27;d just have to prep new <br>
cubes you get, and they&#x27;d never need to be restickered (provided you <br>
like the way the original stickers look).<br>

          <div class="email-content">x, y, and z are simply variables, and can be substituted with 0, 1, -
1 (&#x27;), or 2 to fit your need...

For ex, in corner orientation, if you wanted to twist BLU corner 
clockwise and FRU corner counter-clockwise, you first need to do U&#x27;
to place BLU in position 1 (FLU), do LD2L&#x27;F&#x27;D2F, then U2 to place FRU 
in position 1 (FLU), do F&#x27;D2FLD2L&#x27;, and finally U&#x27; to put all corners 
in their original position.
So the whole algorithm would be:
  U&#x27;-LD2L&#x27;F&#x27;D2F-U2-F&#x27;D2FLD2L&#x27;-U&#x27;
This is the case where x=-1, y=2, and z=-1.
One thing to notice is that x+y+z=0 for all corner pairs. Well, you 
can of course figure out z by keeping track of any U corner piece. :D

If you want to twist corners on U and D layer, just do R2 or 
something to get both corners on the same layer, rotate the corners 
in the same way you would for corners on U layer, and then do the 
inverse of whatever you did... in this case, R2.

All algorithms for blindfold cubing work this way...
1. Perform moves to place pieces you want to move in the spots where 
you can use algorithms without screwing up the orientation.
2. Perform the algorithm.
3. Perform the inverse of whatever you did in 1. 
Once you understand this and how orientation works, blindfold cubing 
isn&#x27;t too hard...

Hope that helps,
Macky

This isn&#x27;t necessarily true... Everyone has different techniques and <br>

that I would memorize them in groups of 2-4 (learning mirrors or <br>

back when I was learning the PLL stuff, and it was more like 1-2/week.<br>
<br>
Daniel&#x27;s suggestion of how to learn them is good, though - that&#x27;s <br>
pretty much what I do.  Also, once I finished learning them all, I <br>
went through a created a practice routine.  I can do all 21 PLL algs <br>
such that the cube starts and ends solved, and is solved at several <br>
points along the way.  I can apply all 57 OLL algs such that it <br>
starts with an oriented LL, ends with an oriented LL, and also hits <br>
one at several points along the way.  It&#x27;s good practice to keep <br>
the &quot;hand memory&quot;, once you already know the algs.  Doesn&#x27;t do much <br>

          <div class="email-content">I would not recommend to use oil on the cubes, the oil will desolve 
the sticker glue and will damage the old style paper based stickers. 
In addition oil will make the plastic soft.

so in short I will be supprised if your cube will last long with 
Olive oil. How long do you cube/stickers last?

Yeah, I&#x27;ve been learning them in groups of two, just doing them back 
and forth, back and forth.  I&#x27;m using the ones from www.rubiks.dk and 
using their videos to show finger placement

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking about supercubing, <br>
and especially about parity of the different types of pieces.  In <br>
doing so I was able to finally &quot;discover&quot; for myself what causes <br>
the &quot;edge parity&quot; on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube (at least I think so) <br>
and I also came up with a shorter alg to fix the parity error.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking of what Per Kristen <br>
Fredlund and Richard Carr have been saying about how doing each <br>
individual slice or face move affects the pieces in terms of cycles <br>
and having actually done examples and thought about it on my own it <br>
is starting to make sense.  So anyway &quot;the parity error&quot; comes up <br>
when the edges are in odd parity (since only 2 need to be switched) <br>
which means the edges are an odd number of inner slice moves away <br>
from being solved correctly.  To solve the parity error on the 4x4x4 <br>
or 5x5x5 you can simply turn any inner slice one quarter turn, and <br>
the cube is now solvable via normal 3 cycles (try it, it works on <br>
both the supercubes and the normal cubes!).  I guess I just thought <br>
that was kind of cool, since I had never really understood why <br>
the &quot;parity error&quot; comes up before I started messing around with <br>
supercubes.  Also I found a shorter move for fixing the parity <br>
error, but unfortunately really only useful on the 5x5x5 supercube.<br>
<br>
Basically what I did was to take &quot;the&quot; parity move that everybody <br>
uses r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 and study it to see <br>
how it works.  &quot;The&quot; parity move swaps two of those 3x1 center rows, <br>
switching the parity of those &quot;+&quot; sign center pieces and also the <br>
outer edges from odd to even.  Since every inner slice quarter turn <br>
changes the parity of both piece types (&quot;+&quot; centers and outer edges) <br>
at once, and since the outer face turns also change the parity of <br>
both piece types at once, then the parity of the &quot;+&quot; centers and the <br>
edges are always the same.  So to fix the edge parity I decided to <br>
try to find a way to fix the &quot;+&quot; center parity.  Once I started <br>
looking at it I started to think about swapping two of those 3x1 <br>
center rows instead of just two of those &quot;+&quot; centers.  Switching two <br>
rows would effectively do two 3 cycles on the four &quot;X&quot; centers (the <br>
ones that form an X through the face once solved) involved in those <br>
3x1 row &quot;pieces&quot; so it would only change the parity of the edges <br>
and &quot;+&quot; centers, which would the &quot;parity error&quot;.  To make this <br>
easier I pictured all the centers on each individual face as three <br>
3x1 rows in the d, middle, and u layers.  This makes it almost the <br>
same as switching 2 edges on a 3x3x3 cube (ignoring what it does to <br>
the corners).  So anyway to make a long story short I came up with a <br>
shorter alg for the edge parity.<br>
<br>
u L2 (u&#x27; L2)x4 u2<br>
<br>
or the speedcubing equivalent,<br>
(Uu) L2 [(U&#x27;u&#x27;) L2]x4 (U2u2)<br>
<br>
This alg I&#x27;m sure has already been &quot;found&quot; but I discovered it for <br>
myself without help, so sorry if I am claiming credit for an alg <br>
someone already saw.  This alg swaps the row on the L face in the u <br>
layer with the row on the L face in the d layer.  It also messes up <br>
all 4 of the edges in the middle layers.  This alg would not be <br>
useful at all for speedcubing on the normal 5x5x5 since it messes up <br>
the 4 working edges however it does indeed create or solve <br>
the &quot;parity&quot; issue.  I&#x27;ve seen that some others have picked up 5x5x5 <br>
supercubing and here&#x27;s my advice for using this alg on the supercube.<br>
<br>
My strategy for the 5x5x5 supercube is to solve 5 of the centers <br>
perfectly correct (though their overall orientation with respect to <br>
eachother I worry about later in the solution).  This leaves me with <br>
having to complete the last center via 3 cycles or paired 2 cycles <br>
(via the ABA&#x27;B&#x27; method of creating cycles).  After having solved the <br>
first 5 centers you can tell immediately whether or not those &quot;+&quot; <br>
centers on the 6th center have odd parity or not, and since the <br>
outer edges have the same parity as the &quot;+&quot; centers then you know <br>
right after completing the first 5 centers whether or not the cube <br>
has the &quot;edge parity&quot;.  At this point I use the above alg (with the <br>
6th center on the L face) and it restores the &quot;+&quot; centers to even <br>
parity, and hence also the edges back to even parity.  After <br>
correcting the parity I solve the &quot;+&quot; centers, then the &quot;X&quot; <br>
centers.  The &quot;X&quot; centers will always be solvable via 3 cycles on <br>
the last center after correcting the &quot;+&quot; parity, though this I only <br>
know from experience and still don&#x27;t fully grasp the reasoning <br>
behind this based on the theory of the cube (though I&#x27;m trying to <br>
remedy that :-).<br>
<br>
So anyway if any of you are also doing 5x5x5 supercubing then this <br>
post is my suggestion for a shorter alg to solve the parity issue in <br>
those &quot;+&quot; centers, and hence in the outer edges too.  You can use it <br>
on the normal 5x5x5 too, but it would not be helpful at all for <br>
speedcubing :)<br>
<br>
If anyone else has found any other cool parity fix algs (supercube <br>
or not) then please post them!  I&#x27;m interested in how they work.  <br>
Grant I want to look at yours that solves both parities on the 4x4x4 <br>
pretty soon.  I think that&#x27;s cool to have an alg that fixes both <br>
parities at once :)<br>
<br>
Also if there&#x27;s anyone here who hasn&#x27;t tried supercubing yet in some <br>
form, I highly recommend it.  I thought normal cube solving was <br>
addicting, but supercubing is definitely more fun by far.<br>
<br>
If anyone else has any supercube algs/comments/just wants to talk <br>
about supercubing please let me know!  I&#x27;m interested in learning as <br>
much as I can about them and throwing ideas at other people and <br>
having them throw ideas at me, etc..<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;m currently working out a solution on paper to the NxNxN <br>
supercube.  I still have some kinks to work out about the possible <br>
states the last center will end up in after having completed the <br>
first 5 though.  Once I get it figured out I want to post the <br>
solution on my webpage.  I&#x27;ve had a few e-mails asking about my <br>
progress on my (normal) NxNxN cube solution, but to be honest I&#x27;ve <br>
been lazy and haven&#x27;t done much with it.  I&#x27;d rather do the NxNxN <br>
supercube solution, with references to whether or not a section <br>
applies only to supercubing or to both.  That way I can take care of <br>
2 things at once.  Anyway I don&#x27;t know if there would be much <br>
interest in this, but I think it&#x27;d be fun just to write to make sure <br>
I know what I&#x27;m doing on the larger supercubes.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,<br>
<br>
&gt; So anyway &quot;the parity error&quot; comes up <br>
&gt; when the edges are in odd parity (since only 2 need to be switched) <br>
&gt; which means the edges are an odd number of inner slice moves away <br>
&gt; from being solved correctly.  To solve the parity error on the 4x4x4 <br>
&gt; or 5x5x5 you can simply turn any inner slice one quarter turn, and <br>
&gt; the cube is now solvable via normal 3 cycles (try it, it works on <br>
&gt; both the supercubes and the normal cubes!).<br>
<br>
   An interesting example of this is: take a regular 3x3x3 apart and<br>
switch two corners. No matter how you mix it up when you get to the<br>
Last level you can have either all the edges in place, or all the<br>
corners, but not both.<br>
   Now move the middle slice 90 degrees and solve the cube keeping<br>
those four centers to one side of where they would usually fall, and<br>
the corners and edges will all fall into place in relation to each other.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

So for the competition, we scrambled the cube for Macky with blue as the &quot;up&quot; face and 
green as the &quot;front&quot; face.  We asked each competitor which color they would like as their 
&quot;up&quot; and &quot;front&quot; face.  My logic here is that even if you scramble a cube the same way but 
ignore colors, if people are going for a cross of a certain color, then it will be different.  Of 
course, Lars Petrus didn&#x27;t care any of the times as his technique doesn&#x27;t matter but for 
everyone and anyone who did care... that&#x27;s what we did.

My personal favorite (ignoring the corner orientation) would be the 1st
algorithm for F2 on the page
http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_orientation.html
With good finger tricks I can do this one under 2 seconds.

Also check out http://www.speedcubing.com/peter for the best finger tricks in
town.

An easy alternative would be: (M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U&#x27;)*2

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jimmy, if you don&#x27;t mind a few middle slice turns here&#x27;s another 
move that goes pretty fast, and just feels cool to do.

S (R&#x27;U&#x27;RU) (RU) (RU&#x27;R&#x27;S&#x27;)

S is turning the middle layer between F and B like you would turn 
the F face.  If you don&#x27;t like triggering middle slices you can do 
the very last trigger as (RU&#x27;R&#x27;) S&#x27; instead, but it goes pretty fast 
triggering that last S&#x27; wth your thumb as well.  This one is one of 
my fastest OLLs and can be done at around 2 seconds or less with 
practice.  I would definitely recommend looking at Peter&#x27;s site too, 
as his algs are generally very well suited for going really fast.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jimmy,

   Using a small case letter like &quot;r&quot; for a middle slice next to R
turned in the same direction, like on the 4x4x4, try  r U2 r&#x27; U2 r U
r&#x27; U2 r U2 r&#x27; U&#x27;

   This flips over all the edges without changing their position and
without affecting the corners.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">you may want to bite the bullet, so to speak, and just learn the 8 
orientations needed so that when 0 edges are oriented, you orient 
the whole LL in 1 look.  that&#x27;s what i did.  there are only 8 cases 
where no edges are oriented.  i just learned those 8 algs, so i 
actually have a 2 look LL when no edges are oriented.

Thanks everybody for your suggestions.  For some reason I hadn&#x27;t
thought of using the OLL algs and ignoring the corners.  I&#x27;ve
temporarily settled on (R&#x27;U2)x(R&#x27;URU&#x27;)y(R&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U)(R&#x27;F) from Peter&#x27;s
website, since I&#x27;m extremely right-handed and have trouble with the S,
M, and E layers.

However, I may, as you say, bite the bullet.  8 algs is not that bad.
 I&#x27;ve just finished learning the PLL algorithms, and the
no-edges-oriented case is somewhat annoying to me. :)

Jimmy

me 5 hours and 28 minutes including 1:30 of memorization.  This was <br>
my first time ever doing a 4x4x4 blindfolded.  I had practiced the <br>
3x3x3 supercube several times and worked out a method to doing the <br>
4x4x4 supercube.  When I first saw that Richard Carr had solved a <br>
4x4x4 cube blindfolded (that was the first I had EVER heard of <br>
that), I thought surely it must be impossible!  However, just like <br>
blindfolded 3x3x3 solving I can say now that it is not impossible.  <br>
Like everything all it takes is practice.<br>
<br>
If anyone else is interested in doing 4x4x4 blindfolded cubing, may <br>
I recommend practicing 3x3x3 supercubing.  My method to doing the <br>
4x4x4 supercube blindfolded, and thus also the 4x4x4 cube though I <br>
haven&#x27;t done a normal one yet, is to 1) solve the corners.  2) Group <br>
together the edges with their corresponding pairs to create 2x1 <br>
piece edge groups all over the cube.  3) Solve the edge groups <br>
exactly like you would solve the edges on a 3x3x3 supercube.  4)  <br>
Solve the centers via 3 and 4 cycles.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m just excited to have joined the 4x4x4 blindfolded solvers <br>
club :)  I also very strongly want to emphasize that you don&#x27;t have <br>
to have a supermemory to do the 4x4x4 blindfolded.  If you have the <br>
dedication to learn how to do the 3x3x3 blindfolded, then it is not <br>
much more of a step to practice and do a 4x4x4.  It is not as <br>
impossible as it might seem, all it takes is practice and dedication!<br>

curiousity, how many numbers did you have to memorize and more

<br>
Is it okay to use spray paint to replace the stickers?  The stickers <br>
always peel off.  I&#x27;ve replaced it once, but it happened again.<br>
<br>
Do you have any alternatives?  I don&#x27;t want to buy a new cube.. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Electrical tape... I used electrical tape a bit.  Some types are better than others.  With cheap 
electrical tape, it wears off rather quickly.  I had to replace the tape every 3 to 4 weeks but 
it&#x27;s cheap.  There are certain types of tapes (those made by 3M generally tend to be better) 
that last longer and may last even longer.  Actually, for my green, red, yellow, and white, I 
have cheap tape but I have a more expensive blue and orange.  The blue and orange never 
seems to wear off... then again, I change them when I change the other colors too so I&#x27;ll 
never know.

I wonder why they don&#x27;t make colored plastic?

Good man! I&#x27;m going to have a go at that one day after I get my 4x4x4 
painted (after I finally get 3+3+4+5 done, which hopefully won&#x27;t be 
long). Try 5x5x5 (just regular isn&#x27;t too easy, so supercube 5x5x5 
would be quite impressive).

          <div class="email-content">Paint works really well, but you cannot use painted cubes at 
official championships. I think you should be able to, but anyway....
Electrical tape or vinyl tape works fairly well, if you can find all 
six colors of it. I personally loved the stickers from rubiks.com, 
too.

          <div class="email-content">Hey David,

as far as memorizing goes I think it is like most anything in that 
you can improve it with lots of practice.  A few years ago I used to 
listen to those &quot;improve your memory tapes&quot; and here are some of the 
strategies I learned from there that I use a lot.

One thing they advocated a lot is to memorize via association.  
Meaning say you have to memorize something boring like a long string 
of numbers.  First break that string up into smaller groups, say 
groups of 3 or 4.  Now take the first thing that is on your mind 
from that day.  Say you have a BIG project due in a few days.  The 
way I would memorize the first group of numbers would be to picture 
the due date of that project.  You are rushing to try to make it on 
time to the office (or school or board room, etc.) where you have to 
give your presentation.  As you turn a corner you literally run into 
a two foot tall wall in the shape of the 3 or four numbers you have 
to memorize, trip over it and get knocked unconscious.  This story 
is rather silly and nonsensical, but that&#x27;s what makes it easy to 
memorize.  If you can create a story that you think is funny, and 
especially if you actually laugh out loud, then you are guaranteed 
to keep the memorized group of numbers in your head, since it is 
easy to recall a funny story, and you have all the information that 
you need to memorize associated with your funny story.

So my biggest tips for memorizing what seems like a huge task is to,
1) break it up into many smaller sections.
2) Associate each of those sections with any pressing issues on your 
mind at the time (you recently had a fight with a friend, you&#x27;re 
hungry, anything that you are likely to think about for a passing 
moment later when you need to recall your information.
3) Once you have something to associate to, create the weirdest, 
silliest, funniest story in your head to associate what you have to 
memorize to whatever pressing issue was in your head.  The funnier, 
the more likely you will be able to recall it later.

This applies to the cube rather easily as you can make up silly 
stories that involve numbers, like the one above where you trip over 
the number wall.  You can also memorize some pieces on the cube as 
letters and use the letters to create a silly story.  For example on 
my 4x4x4 solve I memorized the center pieces using letters.  One of 
the faces had the letters XHDA on it.  I used these letters to make 
the acronym Xylophone Hanggliding... DAngerous.  And I pictured 
someone in midair hanggliding with a xylophone.  At the time that 
struck me as funny and I actually chuckled a little bit.  That was a 
good thing though, because I did the centers last on my solve and 
once I got to that face and had to recall what the letters were on 
it, I pictured the Xylophone Hangglider and I immediately recalled 
the acronym and from there the letters that were on that face.

I&#x27;m sure there are many other methods to memorizing a lot of 
information but that is the one I like.  Try to make your stories as 
silly as possible, and you will be more likely to memorize them for 
a long period of time.

My $0.02,
Chris

some people that knew you from NCSSM.  I hear stories about the <br>
incredible things you could do alllll the time whenever I bring out a <br>
cube.  People from NCSSM always remember you.  Kevin Schaefer always <br>
has good things to say about you playing Sax and also said you were <br>
flown up to new york to have your hands filmed for MTV?  Timothy <br>
Putnam talked about your blindfolded solves all the time also, and <br>
said you could solve 2 at a time in each hand.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmm it is indeed a similar method I would say.  One method that <br>
stiff_hands teaches on the blindfold-cubing website for memorizing <br>
orientation of edges is brilliant, in my opinion.  You associate the <br>
edges on each layer with 1, 2, 4, and 8, and then depending on <br>
whether or not they are oriented, you either skip the number or <br>
accept it, and add it as a summation (as is done in binary).  So for <br>
example, if edges 1 and 3 are incorrect, you would memorize &quot;5&quot;.  <br>
After having the three digits for each layer you just memorize <br>
corresponding letters of the alphabet and then make a saying.  For <br>
example, just by recalling &quot;Dogs ate the Crafty Greeks&quot; or something, <br>
it sticks in your mind and you can easily recall the associated <br>
numbers. <br>
<br>
If you wish to continue that particular example: (In this case, you <br>
would know the letters were D, C, and G; 4, 3, and 7, respectively.  <br>
4 can be reduced to (4), meaning edge 3 on the top layer is wrong.  3 <br>
can be reduced to (1 + 2), meaning that edges 1 and 2 are incorrectly <br>
flipped. The 7 can be reduced to (1 + 2 + 4), meaning edges 1, 2, and <br>
4 are flipped incorrectly.)<br>
<br>
<br>
In general though, memorization is about chunking it together, I&#x27;d <br>
say.  For instance, in our math class once we had a minute to <br>
memorize 30 pictures and then recall them afterward.  I was able to <br>
do so because I had made a &quot;story&quot; that went with it that was easy to <br>
recall.  For example, if you are given the <br>
words &quot;cane&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;bulb&quot;, and &quot;check&quot;, it may be difficult to <br>
recall later on without any sort of memory aid.  However, if you were <br>
to say &quot;the Dog, leaning on a Cane, took the Bulb and Checked it&quot; <br>
makes a much more defined image in your mind that is quite easy to <br>
recall.  Anyway, those are my two cents. :P<br>
<br>
I prefer to memorize things such that you can break it apart by some <br>
sort of logical process and derive many bits of data from it.  You <br>
can memorize the entire cube (a 3x3x3) with a total of perhaps 4 <br>
statements.  As long as you are able to break it down you can find <br>
these associations and apply the necessary moves to the cube.  With <br>
such a system you can memorize the entire cube in perhaps 3 or 4 <br>
minutes depending on how much you practice.  Chris Hardwick did a <br>
good job of explaining how that may work (his dangerous xylophone <br>
hanggliding :P).  <br>

You don&#x27;t mean that you physically labelled the centres with the 
letters, do you? Or do you have a centre that you associate X with? 
In the first instance, it would cut out a lot of the challenge of 
memorization (and it would be harder to make the pieces feel uniform 
to the blindfolded eye).

          <div class="email-content">To make my 4x4x4 supercube I physically drew numbers on my cube with 
a marker on each face with the numbers 1-4 reading left to right and 
top to bottom based on the correct orientation of each face.  So 
when speedcubing (sighted) I just line up the numbers correctly in 
relation to eachother on each face then oreint the whole face 
correctly with respect to the other faces.  For my blindfolded solve 
I memorized all the centers as groups of four letters for each 
face.  So A,B,C,D were the white 1,2,3,4 centers.  E,F,G,H where the 
blue 1,2,3,4 centers, etc..

Also to answer Dror&#x27;s question from earlier, I was not trying at all 
to go fast for my solve, I tried to memorize as thorougly as 
possible and solve as slowly and thoroughly as possible.  My only 
goal with this was to get a successful solve.  Now that I&#x27;ve done 
it ,though, I would like to improve my method and go for speed.  As 
far as the time for each part, solving the corners (orientation and 
permutation) might have taken 3-4 minutes since I was going slowly.  
The edges took about 1:30 to pair up, then another 30 minutes to 
move the edge pairs to their correct spots like on a 3x3x3 
supercube.  Then solving the centers took 2:00 roughly.  Those are 
just estimates though.  I&#x27;m no where near as fast as you pros on the 
4x4x4 blindfolded, but I&#x27;m working on ways to make my method more 
efficient.  My short term goal is to get under 2 hours next time for 
the solving portion of my solution.  And then under 2 hours total as 
a long term goal.

As I said it&#x27;s tough, and quite possibly more trouble than it&#x27;s 
worth.  But still, here is how I do it.

First a primer on number bases.  Skip this if you already know how to 
convert between number bases.

We count in base 10.  That is every number you see in your daily life 
is written and understood as a combination of powers of 10.  4635, 
for example is just 1000*4 + 100*6 + 10*3 + 1*5 = 10^3*4 + 10^2*6 + 
10^1*3 + 10^0*1

Other number bases work exactly the same way, binary uses powers of 2 
and ternary (thanks again Richard) uses powers of 3.  Octal uses 
powers of 8 and Hexadecimal uses powers of 16 (for computer nerds).

So 1101(base2)=2^3*1 + 2^2*1 + 2^1*0+ 2^0*1 = 13(base10)
and 2112(base3)=3^3*2 + 3^2*1 + 3^1*1 + 3^0*1 = 68(base10)

At any rate, I label the corners as such:
UFR, DFR, UBR, DBR = 1,2,3,4 respectively
UFL, DFL, UBL, DBL = 5,6,7,8 respectively

Each corner has 1 of 3 possible orientations: correctly oriented, 
Needs 1 clockwise twist, needs 2 clockwise twists.  So when I used 
this method I simply noted how many clockwise twists each corner 
piece needed and used those numbers as 4 bits in a ternary string:

if
UFR needs 1 CW twist
DFR needs 2 CW twists
UBR is correct
DBR needs 1 CW twist
then your bitstring is
1,2,0,1

1201(base3) for example becomes 3^3*1 + 3^2*2 + 3^1*0 + 3^0*1 = 27*1 
+ 9*2 + 3*0 + 1*1 = 46(base10)

The problem was that actually converting 46(base10) back to 1201
(base3) in my head was more trouble then just memorizing 1201.

Hope that helps clear things up!

Daniel

<br>
I do it a little differently, I&#x27;d translate &quot;1201&quot; to 51, combining <br>
the first two and the last two with base 3 and simply concatenating <br>
them. This is fairly easy, with some practice you don&#x27;t have to <br>
think anymore to do this. Similarly for edge orientation I use four <br>
groups of three bits and combine the first two groups and the last <br>
two, converting for example &quot;100110101001&quot; to (46,51).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris, in your quote you say:<br>
<br>
&quot;I solved the supercube in the purest sense possible, meaning I not <br>

original faces.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you think this is actually &quot;super super cubing&quot;? I think you guys <br>
once talked about this and defined it as also returning the inner <br>
pieces to the original positions.<br>
<br>
I doubt that what you did actually achieves this. Also, it depends <br>
on the mechanism inside the cube so I thought it doesn&#x27;t make much <br>
sense to go for it (it&#x27;s also harder to check ;-).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah checking whether or not the faces are solved onto their 
original faces would be impossible to check without dissassembling 
the cube.  I just meant that I solved all the pieces back to their 
original positions around the central mechanism.  I scrambled with 
green on front and yellow and top, and solved it so that green would 
end up on front and yellow on top.  I don&#x27;t do that for speedcubing 
the super4, because it is way too hard to keep track of where the 
faces should go.  I agree that it would be impossible to check in 
all cases, but I just decided to do it that way to be weird :)  
Solving like that on a blindfolded solve has the same problems as 
solving it like that on a speedcubing solve, but I feel like it is 
very very very slightly more of a challenge since it reduces the 
number of solutions to the 4x4x4 supercube from 24 back down to 1.  
The 5x5x5 supercube only has 1 solution due to the centers being set 
in their positions, but you can fudge that on the 4x4x4.  It really 
isn&#x27;t practical to solve for the original faces thing in most cases, 
but I like being a stickler for the specifics and solving it that 
way..

I think it&#x27;s just me being weird, and that solving it so that the 
centers are correct in relation to each other, i.e. solving it into 
any of its 24 solutions, is just as valid.

Hmm, ok... that makes me think... do you think/know other cubers <br>
exploit the 24 solutions thing somehow? I think I&#x27;d always go for a <br>
specific goal, say yellow on top and orange in front (like I do the <br>
3x3 BLD) so if I scramble it holding it that way I would do the same <br>
as you did? Also, I&#x27;ll probably know the orientation of the cube <br>
after having solved it, so I could just rotate it the way I started <br>
it, right? If cube rotation is not allowed then I&#x27;ll just do it like <br>
L l r&#x27; R&#x27; ;-)<br>

I&#x27;ve gotta give a try at 5x5x5, too. 
The centers are seriously hard. O.o

The first digit=3^0=1, second=3^1=3, third=3^2=9, fourth=3^3=27.

I think this is a hard way of memorizing. For me, it is easier to 
take a mental picture of all the stickers.

For edge permutation, well, ...mumble mumble mumble mumble...
If you want to get your time down, this is probably the best way, as 
you don&#x27;t have the time to associate numbers with stories. The faster 
you go, the more likely it becomes that you don&#x27;t forget the 
permutation before finishing orientation.

You don&#x27;t need to remember lots of algs when you can come up with <br>
them on the fly. Try for example (L D&#x27; L&#x27;) U2 (L D L&#x27;) U2, or <br>
[LD&#x27;L,U2] using (I think) Per&#x27;s commutator notation. This permutes <br>
and orients at the same time and is very intuitive so one can come <br>
up with this easily.<br>
<br>
You can think of it as the U sticker of UFL becoming the U sticker <br>
of UBR becoming the R sticker of DFR becoming the first. So instead <br>
of memorizing/execute orientations plus cycles of cubies you&#x27;d <br>
memorize/execute cycles of *stickers*. This could lead to short <br>
solutions but I don&#x27;t know how easy/fast it is to do.<br>
<br>
It also has some extra problems, e.g. a correctly placed cubie that <br>
just needs to be flipped or an edge cycle with odd orientation <br>
parity.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Supercubing involves marking the centers so that they
have a certain orientation, and then paying attention
to and correcting that orientation as a general step
of the cuber&#x27;s solve. Any normal cube which has been
marked in a way that gives the centers distinct
orientation is called a supercube.

You can try a few things. If you are using Internet Explorer try to 
delete all ur cookies. Then close ur current window. Log out of all 
yahoo-related things, messenger and such. Open a new window and try 
again.

Try using a completely different browser. If you use internet 
explorer try to use Opera or Mozilla.

Another option is to get a new yahoo acount.

You can also check other internet security stuff. Set medium or low 
level security.

Reboot might also help.

Good luck :-)

<br>
Well, my times are nothing like yours (I&#x27;m now averaging 44 seconds),<br>
but I find that I perform better if I&#x27;m relaxed, and for some reason,<br>
turning on a timer makes it harder for me to relax.  I would think<br>
timing yourself all the time and forcing yourself to relax will help.<br>
 Also, you might try what Dan Knights did and practice in front of<br>
people.  :)<br>

It&#x27;s a cube with centres with marked orientations. The cube group is 
bigger (although technically the usual group is a quotient group 
rather than a subgroup of the supercube group, so its not a 
supergroup of the usual cube group).

On late Saturday night/early Sunday morning, I did the 3+3+4+5 cubes <br>
blindfolded (thus superceding my target of the relay 2+3+4+5, which I <br>
abandoned after my 2x2x2 came to bits).<br>
<br>
Since I don&#x27;t have any paint on me, I can&#x27;t really go to supercubing <br>
blindfold yet (and since I&#x27;ve just started work, I don&#x27;t want to go <br>
back to megaminx blindfolded yet, though I may try both of these <br>
projects in future).<br>
<br>
Holding concentration right to the end is the hardest thing here. <br>
Several times I was just a 2 cycle of non-central edges out (twice on <br>
the 4x4x4 and a few times on the 5x5x5) or a couple of centres out, <br>
including one case recently where just a miscalculation of edge <br>
ordering LK in position 4 becoming KL in position 6 (as opposed to <br>
staying LK) right at the very end messed things up. I guess, this is <br>
pretty much on the limit for me at the moment, but I&#x27;m glad to have <br>
got this one out of the way. <br>

what you mean about holding concentration to the end, doing the 4x4 
was a whole lot less than what you had to do, but my concentration 
started to waver a little near the end.

Heh heh I&#x27;d be happy one day just to do the 5x5x5 by itself, so 
5+4+3+3 just blows my mind!

How did you keep the pieces of the 4x4 memorized while working on 
the 5x5, or vice versa (whichever order you did them in)?  Do you 
memorize via association?  Or do you just make sure you know each 
cube cold, so that the time spent working on the other cubes isn&#x27;t 
enough interference to make you forget one of the cubes?

I&#x27;m definitely impressed :)

Anyway, I love the timer but some sort of countdown would be nice so 
I can judge how long to preinspect. I&#x27;m not sure how exactly that 
would work. Also, a pop button/key would be usefull and if you pop 
more than once within 12 times, the previous pop and times before it 
will be automatically deleted. And i also prefer &quot;&#x27;&quot; to &quot;i&quot; in the 
scrambling alg but it&#x27;s no big deal. Just my 2 cents.

          <div class="email-content">This is blindfold CP the cycle way.

Follow my notation here plz:
 1:FLU 2:FRU 3:BRU 4:BLU 5:FLD 6:FRD 7:BRD 8:BLD

First you have to memorize the CP in cycles. You start with 1, and 
see where it has to go, and then see where that piece has to go, and 
so on until you com back to piece 1, forming a cycle. You may need to 
use several cycles to go through all 8 corners.
For ex, scramble the cube using this algorithm:
 F2R2URB&#x27;RF2R&#x27;BRF2R2D2L2
Piece 1 needs to go to 3, 3 to 1, which gives us cycle (13).
Piece 2 needs to go to 7, 7 to 2, which gives us cycle (72).
Piece 4 needs to go to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 4, which gives us 
cycle (4568).
So the whole memorization is (13)(72)(4568).

There are only three algs you have to know:
RB&#x27;RF2R&#x27;BRF2R2: (123)
L&#x27;BL&#x27;F2LB&#x27;L&#x27;F2L2: (142)
RBLB&#x27;R&#x27;FBRF&#x27;L&#x27;FR&#x27;F&#x27;B&#x27;: (12)(34)

All algorithms only affect pieces on the U-face.
Given that cycle, you first have to start by solving (4568).

oh way, i gotta go.
i&#x27;ll be back a little later.

Hi Tyson, et al,<br>
<br>
   In yoga you can reach a point where, after improving, stretching a<br>
little further each day, you suddenly can barely stretch at all. This<br>
is called a set point.<br>
<br>
   At such a point you need to not push it. Take it easy for a day or<br>
two, cube slowly and carefully, and don&#x27;t get frustrated. Afterwards<br>
in yoga it&#x27;s much easier to stretch than before. What I&#x27;m saying is<br>
that a &quot;bad cube day&quot; might be your body preparing to make a leap.<br>
<br>
  I agree with using a different cube like Macky says.<br>

I have a question.  What method do you use?  I use the<br>
Petrus method when I solve normally (I can&#x27;t really<br>
call it speedsolving yet :)), but would this work<br>
blindfolded?  Or would that simply depend on keeping<br>

that works especially well for blindfolded cubing?  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Where was I... yes, (4568). :D

To fix any cycles of length 3+, use wither one of the two 3 corner 
permutation algorithms. The basic idea is to do a few moves to 
get the first 3 pieces, 4, 5, and 6, in U-face, apply one of the 
algorithms, and then reverse the few moves that you did to place the 
corners back to their original position. In this case, you may do 
F2B2, moving 4 to 2, 5 to 1, and 6 to 4. Now you need to do (142).
Then, do B2F2 (inverse of F2B2). This reduces the the cycle (4568) to 
(48). Whenever you have cycle (abcde...n) and you do (abc), 
(abcde...n) becomes (ade...n). Do this to each cycle of length 3+, so 
that you end up with a bunch of corner pairs. Now you have to use the 
third algorithm, which does (12)(34). In our example, we have (13)(27)
(48) left. First we will solve (13)(27). Doing L2DL2 brings 1 to 4 
and 7 to 1, so that now you can use (12)(34). After performing this 
algorithm, do L2D&#x27;L2 (inverse of L2DL2). Now you&#x27;re left with just 
cycle (48). Depending of what puzzle you are solving, there are two 
different ways to deal with this odd pair.
1. If you are solving a 2x2x2 blindfolded, just bring the two pieces 
to positions 1 and 4 (you can do D2F2), then do URB&#x27;RF2R&#x27;BRF2R2, and 
then reverse whatever you did (so F2D2).
2. If you are solving a 3x3x3 blindfolded, leave them alone until you 
are down to one pair in edge permutation, and then switch the two 
corners and two edges in one alg (PLL is fine).

Am I making any sense? Because I don&#x27;t think I am... :)

Macky

p.s. When doing the few moves to get corners on U-face, only use 180 
degree turns for layer F, L, B, and R. This keeps the orientation the 
same way.

          <div class="email-content">I have found that the move R&#x27;DRFD2F is good for putting a piece on <br>
the bottom layer to the top.  For example, let&#x27;s say you had the <br>
permutation (1 5 3), where 1 is UFL 3 is UBR (personally my 5 would <br>
be DFL but it&#x27;s irrelevant for this example). This essentially means <br>
the corner in Position 1 needs to go to Position 5, and the piece in <br>
Position 5 needs to go to 3, and from 3 to 1.  <br>
<br>
But this situation is tricky because it requires a cycle to be done <br>
with a piece on the bottom layer, and you can&#x27;t simply get it to the <br>
top by doing an F2/L2/R2/B2 because it would shove one of the other <br>
two desired corners to the bottom layer.  So in this case I would <br>
move the bottom layer such that the corner in Position 5 is at DFR, <br>
and then perform the move I stated above, then do a 3-corner cycle, <br>
then undo the move. Easy on the memory and not too difficult to <br>
execute.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways if you ever come to a point where you have, for instance, (1 <br>
3)(2 6), I&#x27;ve found that I can &quot;view&quot; this as an exceptional case and <br>
look at it as (1 3 2)(6).  After three-cycling corners 1 3 and 2, the <br>
middle number of the first set drops and then the last two now <br>
switch.  Therefore it now becomes (1 6 2).  A final three cycle takes <br>
care of this easily.  <br>

There are 2 pieces that have a much longer side on them but there is 
1 piece that is just a little bit longer than the others on one side

It appears to permute the UFL, UFR, and UBR corners counterclockwise
without disturbing orientation.

Still puzzled what buffing might be, I asume you mean polish a cube. 
Yes this helps especially on an already used cube, I only polish cube 
with a machine a when someone had used the wrong lubrication.

Solve them in order (smallest to largest; that way you keep the 
hardest cube to last, increasing potential to forget, making the 
challenge harder). The hardest part is when the cube jams or tries to 
come apart. After that, it&#x27;s all down to concentration. I&#x27;ve been 
desperately close many times and just been careless to the extent of 
being a couple of non-central edfges out in the 4 or the 5.
I just memorize them as sequences of letters and numbers (though I 
try to figure out in advance which corners or edges to orient 
together, rather than memorizing those sequences). I sent Ron the 
details of the cubes for the speedcubing website. I remember that in 
both the 4 and the 5 edges V,F came up in that order (but in 
different edge positions). That can make for confusion between cubes.
Off the top of my head, the non-central edge permutation in the 5 was 
HPREGWSUITAKMCQDJXNLVFBO.

I don&#x27;t use association (or at least not visual) as I don&#x27;t have that 
kind of memory. I guess I might associate numbers like cubes or 
squares or palindromes or Olympic Games but it&#x27;s generally just a 
sequence. In the 5x5x5 the corner permutation was 36815742. This 
starts off with a couple of squares 36 and 81. 5 is correctly placed 
and it finishes off with Douglas Adams&#x27; answer ,42, leaving 7 as the 
other one; equally, Heinz had 57 varieties that could be used there. 
Maybe on the letters I can think of the letters as being mnemonics in 
part, but of course, when you start switching things around it really 
doesn&#x27;t help much! I try to know the cubes reasonably well (not 
always cold, but as close as) - and I remember all the details 
(rather than skipping the ends) as an error check. It&#x27;s also pretty 
important in the 4x4x4 to work out in advance if the corners are 
oddly permuted or evenly (this checks with the edges in the 3 and 5, 
but in a 4 you have no check unless you&#x27;re supercubing).
Sometimes I do forget the cubes, but then sometimes I can remember 
them again.

> 
> I&#x27;m definitely impressed :)

Maybe I just got lucky!
That was my biggest remaining challenge outside of megaminx (which is 
probably easier in many ways, except that memorizing 12 lots of 
colours will make quick identification of pieces difficult, and 
keeping track of sides blindfolded will be harder) - I&#x27;ve done 
corners on it before, but for 30 edges, I&#x27;m not sure of a good way to 
label them. (&quot;Twenty seven&quot; has a lot of syllables.) If I get some 
paint I might try supercubing too.
(I&#x27;m thinking of painting the centres like this to avoid quick 
identification (as per labelling with letters) - the square gets 
divided along the diagonal - inner half is colour of side, outer 
quarters are coloured the colours of the 2 adjacent sides.)

One half would be say all red and the other half would be split like

<br>
I totally understand that 45-60 mins is a long time to spend on a <br>
practice solution (and it seems even longer if it doesn&#x27;t pan out!!)<br>
<br>
Why not practice stages instead?  When I was learning I would solve <br>
all the edges on the 3x3x3 with my eyes open and then just do the <br>
corner orientation and permutation blindfolded.  After just a little <br>
practice the orientation becomes REALLY easy, it is really only the <br>
permutation you need worry about and with just a little practice it <br>
too becomes fairly straightforward as long as you keep your <br>
concentration.  <br>
<br>
When the corners become routine do the opposite.  Solve the corners <br>
with your eyes open (great for corners-first practice too - so it&#x27;s <br>
a double benefit!!) and then just do the edge orientation and <br>
permutation.  Again the orientation rapidly becomes VERY easy so <br>
again it is just a question of getting the hang of the permutation.  <br>
<br>
By practicing this way you never need to devote an hour at a time to <br>
it.  You can make quick and discernable progress in all four <br>
stages.  When the edges become routine it is time to do the whole <br>
deal.  I have NO DOUBT that a cuber of your ability and experience <br>
will be able to master this in a relatively short time.  If I can do <br>
it you certainly can do it too!<br>
<br>
If your biggest stumbling block is simply the bulk practice time <br>
then divide and you shall conquer!!<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
It really isn&#x27;t as hard as it sounds!<br>

the cube every time.  Of course it can, but anyone who
isnt a cubist i.e. anyone looking at my project
doesn&#x27;t know that.  And so, it makes for a pretty
solid project in my opinion.  I just test about 20
different cases, if the method can solve it, and how
many moves it took to solve that case.  I explained a
great deal about notation and everything becauase that
was my biggest problem when i was starting out.  I got
1st place in math and Overall winner at my school, and
now I&#x27;m entering in highschool district.  I dont want
to really confuse people with a lot of group theory
becuase I&#x27;ll probably do a continuation of this
project next year with a lot of group theory once I
know what I&#x27;m talking about.  My advantage against
anyone else is that I can talk to the judges and
demonstrate solving the cube for them.  I can usually
get it in the mid 30&#x27;s, which will greatly impress
them.  If you have any suggestions, please email me
back.

<br>
<br>
You might explain a little of how even though you tested 20 random <br>
cases, that&#x27;s still only 4.62x10^-17 % of all the possible cases.  So <br>
while you feel confident that it can solve all cases, you haven&#x27;t <br>
taken a large enough sample to be sure...<br>
<br>
But you can prove that there are only 41 distinct orientation and 14 <br>
distinct orientation cases for the last layer which kind of throws <br>
into light how breaking the puzzle into smaller pieces helps solve <br>
it.  <br>
<br>
And I also like to blow people&#x27;s minds with just how big a number <br>
4x10^19 is...  As an astronomer I prefer the &quot;4x10^19 rubik&#x27;s cubes, <br>
each in a different state stacked end to end would reach 251.5 light <br>
years away or closer than all the stars in this picture: <br>
http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/250lys.html&quot;  But you can come <br>
up with all kinds of other references, I&#x27;m sure!<br>
<br>
Just a thought.<br>
<br>
Let us know how it turns out!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I broke my brain.<br>
I got curious after my last post and started poking around at the <br>
number of combinations of different puzzles.  That professor cube has <br>
2.58e^90 positions for example, and my mefferts cube is 7mm (not <br>
counting tiles) across.  So stacking those end to end would result in <br>
a 1.9e73 light year long tower... this is where MY brain broke.  Even <br>
though I deal with really big numbers pretty often, I couldn&#x27;t fathom <br>
this distance.  It _won&#x27;t_ fit in the observable universe.  In fact, <br>
it won&#x27;t fit in 2 observable universes or 3 or 4... If you accept big <br>
bang and our current estimates of the universe&#x27;s size, (around 30 <br>
billion light years across=15 billion years at 1 lightyear expansion <br>
a year in all directions) you would need 6.37e62 UNIVERSES the size <br>
of ours to fit them all in there.  This is where my girlfriend&#x27;s <br>
brain broke...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Tyson, I know what you mean about cubing slumps.  Whenever I find <br>
myself having a &quot;bad cube day&quot; I like to practice another puzzle.  <br>
Say I&#x27;m just not getting good times on the 3x3x3 no matter how hard <br>
I try, then I&#x27;ll put the 3x3x3 cube down and try the supercube, or <br>
I&#x27;ll stack cups, or do the 4x4x4, etc..<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve found that sometimes, although I might be having a bad 3x3x3 <br>
day, that maybe I&#x27;m really focused for stacking cups, or doing the <br>
cube blindfolded, or some other puzzle.<br>
<br>
Also I&#x27;ve noticed sometimes if I&#x27;m having a bad cube day and I <br>
practice a harder puzzle for a while (4x4x4, 5x5x5, supercube, etc.) <br>
that even though I&#x27;ll probably have a bad day on the harder puzzle <br>
too, once I come back to the 3x3x3 it feels easier and my times <br>
improve a little bit.<br>
<br>
It helps to jump around in my opinion.  A bad 3x3x3 speedsolve day <br>
doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you&#x27;re having a bad all around puzzle <br>
solving day.<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S. congrats on the 2x2x2 blindfolded!!  You should submit it for <br>
the open division on the Sunday blindfold contest ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">There are many benefits from cubing:

1) You will know how to solve it :-P

2) You might become fast at it ;-)

3) Possibly you can impress some people, including ur boss, friends 
or girlfriend/boyfriend.

4) You might acquire &quot;spatial visualisation skills&quot; that can be 
applied to other domains.

5) Yes it can stimulate your brain in many different ways.

6) Unless you cube cause you are a masochist (:-P) you wil have a 
jolly good time.

7) It is easy to measure your improvement, whether it is speed or 
solving in number of moves ... and so on :D

8) Cubing is cheaper than many other hobbies, like surfing, 
snowboarding ... you name it ...

9) Most cubists never suffer severe damage from their cubing. Many 
other hobbies/interests involve far higher risks.

10) Cubing is aesthetically satisfactory :-)

11) Most cubing is quite silent unless u swear at it and smash it 
with a hammer :-P

12) You can do it alone.

13) You can spend little or much time on it ...

And i&#x27;m sure there are many other benefits also .... :D

          <div class="email-content">Oh gosh... please!  Write in English!  Maddox says that it&#x27;s e-mails like those that will 
completely obliterate our chances of ever contacting intelligent life outside of our solar 
system.  Aliens will get e-mail and then think we&#x27;re dumb because we can&#x27;t even form 
coherent sentences with our own language!

Anyway, I&#x27;ve got a story and a record in progress right now to tell you about.  So Tuesday 
is a particularly bad day of the week for me because I have an orchestra rehearsal from 7:
30 PM to 10:30 PM and I don&#x27;t get back until about 11 PM.  I also have physics (Quantum 
Mechanics) due on Wednesday at noon.  Well, my Optics class&#x27; homework set number 4 
was weird so there was an extension granted.  It&#x27;s usually due on Friday.  This causes 
Optics set number 5 to be due on the same Wednesday.  Anyway, we got stuck on... 
finding some weird derivative of an expectation value and it was about 3:30 AM anyway... 
so... well...

I&#x27;ve never really pulled an all nighter.  The latest I&#x27;ve stayed up is about 6 or 7 AM.  I 
decided I might as well try and stack awake for 40 consecutive hours just to see what it&#x27;s 
like.  I woke up at 10 AM yesterday morning... well, if I manage to get past 36 hours, I&#x27;ll 
definitely take a cube average.  I wonder if I&#x27;ll make it... I&#x27;m already a pretty random person 
shooting off tangents everywhere when I&#x27;m normal... so this should be interesting.

It&#x27;s 5:16 AM... I&#x27;ve gone... 19 hours and 16 minutes without sleep.  Whee!!!

As for the mile time... I&#x27;d be up for a competition of running the mile and solving the cube 
one after the other competition.  I think with some training, breaking 6 minutes isn&#x27;t too 
bad.  How did you ever mange to solve 6 cubes while running?!?

Anyway, hopefully I still remember my name after this...

15) Increased dexterity.  (I type on a keyboard MUCH faster after my

16) Fool people into thinking you&#x27;re some sort of genious.

17) Portable hobby.  Easy to transport a cube and practice anywhere.

within say 4 moves of the solution only you&#x27;d never notice it.

What blows my mind even though it&#x27;s still not as many combos as a 
prof cube, is that true, all the possible 3x3x3 cube states strung 
end to end could cover the earth 270 times, but each and every one 
of those cubes has 2048 unique states for the center rotations.  So 
for every one of those cubes that together cover the earth 270 
times, replace it with 2048 cubes that are in the same state with 
every possible center rotation...

On the big scheme of things though, it&#x27;s a pretty small number. After 
all, there are lots of bigger numbers, even if you restrict yourself 
to finite numbers.
One of the famous big finite numbers, Graham&#x27;s number, is an upper 
bound to a problem where the suspected answer is 6 (this problem has 
some connection with higher dimensional cubes) - see 
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GrahamsNumber.html for instance.
Graham&#x27;s number is very large compared to most numbers people 
encounter. It dwarfs a googolplex or Skewes&#x27; number for instance, 
both of which are much larger than 10^19 (which is even dominated by 
the humble googol to many orders of magnitude), but it is still very 
much finite and so quite a small number.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody,<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know whether the key idea or its applications I&#x27;ll discuss <br>
here have been found before, but I&#x27;m quite proud I have found it <br>
myself and very eager to tell you about it :-)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m talking about a CLL method, i.e. orienting and permuting the <br>
corners of one layer. It&#x27;s not the fastest (but not slow either) but <br>
it is built around a single short inutitive algorithm and even <br>
doesn&#x27;t change any edges.<br>
<br>
This algorithm is (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;). Let&#x27;s call it &quot;ALG&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Demo<br>
----<br>
Let me demonstrate it with an example. Try this:<br>
(R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) D (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) D2 (U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) D (U R U&#x27; R&#x27;).<br>
Or shorter: (ALG) D (ALG) D2 (ALG)&#x27; D (ALG)&#x27;.<br>
<br>
It picks up and puts back some corners of the D layer. It works <br>
somehow &quot;one by one&quot; so you solve one corner after the other like <br>
this.<br>
<br>
<br>
For orientation only<br>
--------------------<br>
To twist a corner, simply turn the D layer to move the corner to DFR <br>
and apply ALG or ALG&#x27; twice. Then bring the next corner you want to <br>
orient to DFR, orient it, and so on. Example:<br>
ALG ALG D2 ALG&#x27; ALG&#x27; D2.<br>
<br>
<br>
For permutation only<br>
--------------------<br>
You can take the DFR corner out of the D layer with ALG, then turn <br>
the D layer to bring another corner to DFR, apply ALG&#x27; (which will <br>
bring this new corner out and the old corner in again), and so on. <br>
Always alternate between ALG and ALG&#x27;. Finish by putting the last <br>
corner back to D and the original U corner to U. Example:<br>
ALG D ALG&#x27; D ALG D2 ALG&#x27;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Trouble<br>
-------<br>
Try scrambling the cube with the above example again and at the end <br>
rotate the cube around the y axis:<br>
(ALG) D (ALG) D2 (ALG)&#x27; D (ALG)&#x27; y.<br>
<br>
Now let&#x27;s try to solve this:<br>
1. ALG brings a D corner up.<br>
2. D2 ALG&#x27; puts it down correctly and gets the next one up.<br>
3. D&#x27; ALG&#x27; is similar.<br>
4. D&#x27; ALG only *almost* solves the cube.<br>
<br>
What went wrong? Since we scrambled it with the same basic method, <br>
it obviously depends on the order in which you&#x27;re solving the <br>
corners. This surprised me a bit and I haven&#x27;t yet found out how to <br>
determine a good order and whether there&#x27;s always one.<br>
<br>
However, there&#x27;s a simple workaround: Rotate the cube with &quot;x&#x27;&quot; and <br>
then use the method to orient the corners which are now both on the <br>
D layer. Do ALG&#x27; ALG&#x27; D&#x27; ALG ALG D.<br>
<br>
Another idea would be to first orient and then permute, which will <br>
always work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Upside down?<br>
------------<br>
I also tried to do it upside down, solving the U layer corners. <br>
However, this feels awful and unnatural to me. It would be faster <br>
for recognition but slower for turning.<br>
<br>
<br>
Easy LL solution especially for beginners<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
My method can be used for a LL solution using only three different, <br>
short and intuitive algorithms. For edge orientation I suggest (R U <br>
B U&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27;), for edge permutation I suggest (R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;), both <br>
of which can be inversed and *explained* easily and also executed <br>
fast. Then my CLL method follows. If this LL approach has been <br>
described somewhere already, please let me know. Otherwise I&#x27;ll do <br>
that on the speedsolving section of my website (http://www.stefan-<br>
pochmann.de/spocc/speedsolving). If you&#x27;re already solving the cube <br>
this way, please let me know how well it works for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Megaminx<br>
--------<br>
I also use this very same three-algorithm LL solution to solve the <br>
Megaminx now and I like it a lot. Comments from the Megaminx people?<br>
<br>
<br>
Blindfolded<br>
-----------<br>
I haven&#x27;t tried applying it to blindsolving yet, but I could imagine <br>
that it can be of advantage since you can pretty much handle each <br>
edge alone. Could also be used for easy corner orientation only.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fully intuitive Corners First solution<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
I think we all agree that in corners first solutions the first layer <br>
corners and all but the middle slice edges are intuitive to solve, <br>
even I easily worked this out myself. With my CLL method the other <br>
four corners can be intuitive as well and using for example the <br>
commutator [U M U2 M2 U, Lx] with x=1 or x=2 to orient edges (or use <br>
(M U)*4 variants) and then (M&#x27; D2 M D2) to permute them there&#x27;s yet <br>
another easy CF solution.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks again to Per Kristen Fredlund for discussing commutators and <br>
the Fewest Move Contest people for making me *think*.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

Damn good you reminded me! I had forgotten this already ;-)<br>
<br>
Btw, another rule change suggestion: Currently it&#x27;s &quot;You must <br>
determine before you begin a solve whether or not it is an official <br>
solve&quot;. You should even determine this before *scrambling*. <br>
Otherwise you could scramble/analyze until you find an easy one.<br>
<br>
And something else that has come up before: Is it ok to take notes <br>
while memorizing, i.e. before actually solving? I vote &quot;no&quot;, but <br>
that&#x27;s just my opinion. I&#x27;d like to have an official ruling on this, <br>
though.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I was just thinking about that.<br>
<br>
The colors of the cube, in a mathematical sense, don&#x27;t have any real <br>
significance other than to distinguish the different sides of the <br>
cube relative to eachother.<br>
<br>
Take this for example... the 3-corner clockwise cycle permutation <br>
algorithm. You could perform this on any face of a solved cube, <br>
white, yellow, red, orange, and it&#x27;d have the same effect. Take 2 <br>
solved cubes, on one of them perform the 3-corner cycle on the red <br>
face, and on the other perform the same cycle on the blue face, and <br>
look at these two different cubes. Are these two configurations <br>
really different? I would submit that they are not!<br>
<br>
Since there are 24 different ways of holding a Rubik&#x27;s Cube in your <br>
hands (white up orange front, white up green front, and so on), I <br>
believe that in essence, there are really only about 1.8 quintillion <br>
different possible configurations with a Rubik&#x27;s Cube.<br>
<br>
Just a thought. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow stefan - thats amazing. It&#x27;s so simple and intuitive and 
triggerable. I espcially like doing that for orientation. You can 
choose whic way you want the corner twisted and which corners to 
twist all without momorizing a thing (well almost nothing)! I think 
that would be very usefull for blindfold cubing. I&#x27;m trying to learn 
that now and that&#x27;s the way I plan on orienting corners. I&#x27;ll also 
use that on the megaminx so I won&#x27;t have to learn many new algs. Im 
not sure how well this would work for speedcubing but it certainly 
has potential. Thanks for sharing!

Nothing new under the sun.
Isn&#x27;t it cool to learn how powerful commutators can be?
And explain many things that looked so obscure before you get to know
them.

But even if it&#x27;s simple when you fully understand how it works, it
does not make methods easier to beginners. I tried to teach that kind
of things to friends (who do not have problems with mathematics and
groups theory), and hardly succeded.

tricky bit is arranging their position at the same time.  They don&#x27;t <br>
have to be properly positioned wrt their colours just next to each <br>
other so that you get a block of three in a corner that is properly <br>
oriented.  I have nine of the twelve possible cases.  Three of them <br>
found using one of the cube-solving applets.  Trouble is that I am <br>
now up to a minimum of 11 moves and its a bit unmanageable.<br>
<br>
Ultimately my goal is to start using these moves on my second to <br>
last middle edge and then I need 30 to 40 more moves (I think its a <br>
while since i came up with this) to put the last middle edge in <br>
while retaining the structure I have and flipping the last two edges <br>
and another corner.  This would leave a LL with two corners <br>
unoriented and nothing positioned which should be manageable in one.<br>
<br>
When I had it clear in my head I figured it would only save 4-8 <br>
moves on a normal fridrich F2L and a 2-look LL but its the principle <br>
of the thing!<br>
<br>
Anyway the point of the post is to ask whether anyone has any views <br>
on the scheme and whether anyone has any brilliant ideas for finding <br>
those extra moves - is there stuff out there that will help.  I&#x27;m <br>
usually pretty good at working stuff out in RL but the cube applet <br>
has been useful so far - it just seems to be at its limit at 11 <br>
moves.<br>
<br>
Happy to share what I have so far if anyone is interested.<br>

People like big numbers, but I don&#x27;t understand why. Ok, 10^20 is &quot;a
lot&quot;, but it does not tell if a puzzle is difficult or not.
You can see huge numbers everywhere, at any scale. With 256MB of RAM,
you can code numbers bigger than 10^650000000. So what?

It&#x27;s not so much the large numbers that I like, it&#x27;s the way they are 
described. A number like 10^20 is so huge that it can be difficult to 
appreciate how big it really is. If someone describes it in reference 
to a known quantity (like an olympic swimming pool or number of 
kilometres/miles, etc), then it&#x27;s easier to comprehend how large it 
really is. And when people do make such calculations and comparisons, 
I find that I am still surprised when I read it, even though I&#x27;ve 
been cubing for years and I know the number of configurations on a 
standard cube. 

So, the number 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 doesn&#x27;t particularly 
entertain or interest me. However, I still find it highly amusing 
reading about how long it would take to make this many twists or how 
many kilometres/miles this many cubes would stretch end-to-end.  :)

Jasmine.

already say themselves that it&#x27;s a special cube, so I guess you

Well, you could of course show the solved cube and put it in your 
pocket right afterwards, like it&#x27;s nothing special. Then if they 
want to turn it themselves you take out a normal cube instead ;-)

Of course now you need a really good excuse when they ask you to 
solve it again by throwing it in the air. You could say your 
telekinesic powers are so exhausting to use you can only do it once 
a day.

But the worst thing about this is... nobody will ever again trust 
you when you really solve a normal cube. They&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s that 
magic *trick* again.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I have written a program based on my (now quite old) ACube 2.6
program. I can be used to search for either optimal or
suboptimal sequences for uncompletely specified cube.
You can specify positions of only some cubies as well as
their orientations, etc.
It can also find optimal sequences in three different
metrics (quarter, half, and slice-turn).
It can also ignore specified leading and trailing move
(U/U&#x27;/U2 in this case).
Is is quite fast as it uses a lot of pruning tables etc.

However, it is now text only and without documentation.
Until I finish the program to publish it, you can send
me cube configurations that you want to solve (while
ignoring some orientations and/or permutations of the
last layer in this case) and I will (try to) solve them
and give you all optimal results...

I used this program to find sequences for Waterman&#x27;s method
and (although waterman stated that they were checked for
optimality up to 13 moves) found many shorter sequences
(up to 2 turns safe).

Regards,

Josef

I recently got a digital camera as a gift and it also records video for limited amounts of time. One of them is on my website www.topgunryu.tk although it has no sound. A second one was posted on Jetstream by nice coworkers who dont mind using that space for my silly video. The first one is 24 seconds which is pretty fast for me, and the second one is 30 seconds, and that&#x27;s more around my average. That last one is at http://jetstream.titan.manhattan.edu:8080/ramgen//data//JET/videos/raul_garcia_rubik_cube_30-seconds.rm <br>
 <br>
Hopefully one day I can have an awesome sub-20 video, but for now this is all there is.<br>

&gt; I don&#x27;t know whether the key idea or its applications I&#x27;ll discuss <br>
&gt; here have been found before, but I&#x27;m quite proud I have found it <br>
&gt; myself and very eager to tell you about it :-)<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s not exactly the same, but I&#x27;ve been using something similar for <br>
a while - not sure if I worked it out or found it somewhere else, <br>
though.  My algs are:<br>
1) R&#x27; U R U&#x27; (to manipulate F corners)<br>
2) R U&#x27; R&#x27; U (to manipulate B corners)<br>
<br>
&gt; This algorithm is (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;). Let&#x27;s call it &quot;ALG&quot;.<br>
[snip]<br>
&gt; Demo<br>
&gt; ----<br>
&gt; (ALG) D (ALG) D2 (ALG)&#x27; D (ALG)&#x27;.<br>
[snip]<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Trouble<br>
&gt; -------<br>
&gt; Try scrambling the cube with the above example again and at the end <br>
&gt; rotate the cube around the y axis:<br>
&gt; (ALG) D (ALG) D2 (ALG)&#x27; D (ALG)&#x27; y.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Now let&#x27;s try to solve this:<br>
&gt; 1. ALG brings a D corner up.<br>
&gt; 2. D2 ALG&#x27; puts it down correctly and gets the next one up.<br>
&gt; 3. D&#x27; ALG&#x27; is similar.<br>
&gt; 4. D&#x27; ALG only *almost* solves the cube.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; What went wrong? Since we scrambled it with the same basic method, <br>
&gt; it obviously depends on the order in which you&#x27;re solving the <br>
&gt; corners. This surprised me a bit and I haven&#x27;t yet found out how to <br>
&gt; determine a good order and whether there&#x27;s always one.<br>
<br>
Basically, ALG affects not only corners on the bottom, but also the <br>
UFR corner.  Looking at piece orientation as you would in blindfold <br>
cubing, ALG rotates both UFR and DFR counterclockwise while swapping <br>
their positions (it also rotates UBL while swapping it with UBR).  <br>
For this reason, if ALG is used to pull UFR off U, then ALG&#x27; must be <br>
used to put it back on U in the same orientation.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure what all the different possibilities are that work, but <br>
I know you can orient 2 corners and permute 3, or swap two pairs of <br>
oppositely oriented corners.  There are some cases that can&#x27;t be done <br>
in one step - they&#x27;d have to be oriented and permuted separately.  <br>
Unless you can figure out what the rule is on what works and what <br>
doesn&#x27;t (some fail in worse ways than what you observed), it would <br>
probably work best to orient and permute separately.<br>
<br>
&gt; Upside down?<br>
&gt; ------------<br>
&gt; I also tried to do it upside down, solving the U layer corners. <br>
&gt; However, this feels awful and unnatural to me. It would be faster <br>
&gt; for recognition but slower for turning.<br>
<br>
I like using the algs I listed and doing either F or B corners - it <br>
triggers nicely (and I&#x27;m used to it ;-).  Faster recognition (than D) <br>
and fast turning on F (using alg 2 for B is probably about equal to <br>
yours for D).<br>
<br>
&gt; Easy LL solution especially for beginners<br>
&gt; -----------------------------------------<br>
[snip]<br>
&gt; ... If you&#x27;re already solving the cube <br>
&gt; this way, please let me know how well it works for you.<br>
<br>
Not so much that I solve it this way, but I use this method to teach <br>
people to orient corners.  With them, I can put LL on U, since <br>
newbies aren&#x27;t using triggers.  That way, I can just say to <br>
remember &quot;up-up-down-down&quot; (i.e. R F&#x27; R&#x27; F or F&#x27; R F R&#x27;), and they <br>
can orient all corners on U.<br>
<br>
&gt; Megaminx<br>
&gt; --------<br>
&gt; I also use this very same three-algorithm LL solution to solve the <br>
&gt; Megaminx now and I like it a lot. Comments from the Megaminx people?<br>
<br>
Do I count as a megaminx person ;-)  This is actually the way I do <br>
corner permutations, except I leave out the U&#x27; at the end of ALG and <br>
the U at the beginning of ALG&#x27; (and I do put the LL on U - it&#x27;s not <br>
quite as awkward on the minx as it is on the cube).  I&#x27;d love to be <br>
able to combine these steps of my LL on the megaminx - I just don&#x27;t <br>
know when it works.  For corner orientations, though, I use algs that <br>
orient 2 or 3 corners at a time, which is more efficient.<br>
<br>
&gt; Blindfolded<br>
&gt; -----------<br>
&gt; I haven&#x27;t tried applying it to blindsolving yet, but I could<br>
&gt; imagine that it can be of advantage since you can pretty much<br>
&gt; handle each edge alone. Could also be used for easy corner<br>
&gt; orientation only.<br>
<br>
What I mentioned earlier is actually what I use for corner <br>
orientation when doing blindfold cubing - it works well.  First, I <br>
orient all F corners (leaving out one if there&#x27;s an odd one), then <br>
all B corners (again leaving one out as necessary), and finally the <br>
odd pair from F and B.<br>

For Joseph - I have considered running a charity marathon or half marathon
solving cubes.  My half marathon time is around 1 hour 40 so should get a
good number in.  Except ... how do you carry them all around?  Or get
someone to scramble and hand them to you?  Maybe a running partner could do
this.  If we make the challenges bizarre enough we could all hold world

Push hard but also push at an angle.  Be sure you have the pieces in 
correctly.  There are photos showing how to assemble the 2x2x2 in 
the photos section in a folder called fix your 2x2x2.  
Good luck,

I know of 5 different cube magic tricks, though some may not be <br>
available any more.<br>
<br>
1) Revenge version.<br>
As Jake says, it is bad quality. The idea is neat (it is one of those <br>
Yoshimoto cubes, 8 cubes hinged together so that it can turn inside <br>
out) but it looks horrid. Obviously not a normal cube.<br>
2) 3x3x3 Throw in the air version. Essentially a restickered normal <br>
cube. Works very well, though you can&#x27;t show one face at the end, and <br>
need to practise the throw a bit.<br>
3) 3x3x3 Throw in the air version 2. Normal cube with a gimmick. Cube <br>
can be fully shown at the end, but handling is more awkward.<br>
4) 3x3x3 cube in box. Mixed cube placed inside tight fitting box, it <br>
is in solved state when reopened, and can then be handed out.<br>
5) Mini cube in mouth. Small 3x3x3 cube is mixed up, put inside mouth <br>
and apparently solved by tongue. Same method as #2.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Josef,
That would be fantastic.  An explanation of the cases and what I need is
below but if it is hard to follow or you want it in a different notation or
something let me know and I will try to send whatever you need.

The way I am solving has the LL as the F face and the first (completed
layer) as the B face.  At the point I am trying to solve I have the whole of
B solved and the UL, LD and RD edges solved.

The final middle layer edge is currently sitting in LF in an orientation
such that when it goes to UR, L goes to U and F goes to R.

At the same time I want to orient the corner in the UFL spot.
I also want to take the  edges currently at UF and RF and place them and
orient them in LF and UF (that is either side of the newly oriented UFL
corner).  It doesn&#x27;t matter which of the two edges goes to which place.

The twelve cases are defined by the current orientation of the UFL corner (3
possibilities) and the current orientation of the UF and RF edges (2
possibilities each (3x2x2=12).  In table form I have the following:

                UFL                         UF                          RF

You could always use the same move - then it would be easy. 
Possibilities are U (4 corners and 4 edges) or you could use a PLL 
type move.

My suggestion would be to try Hard as Nails, since it&#x27;s stronger than <br>
typical clear nail polish, but I haven&#x27;t tried it... I&#x27;ve thought <br>
about doing this to make a cube&#x27;s original stickers last forever (or <br>
at least last a very long time), but haven&#x27;t ever actually tried.  I <br>

          <div class="email-content">I used the hard as nails nylon stuff on the the white center sticker 
of my studio cube to protect the logo. It worked well for a while 
then started chipping/peeling from the edge of the sticker. When I 
peeled the rest of it off, the logo came with it. Oh well. I made 
the mistake of only using one coat though. As long as you use a few 
coats, I think it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.

I used several of clear nail polish over regular nail polish and it
worked OK. The surface may be pretty slick so maybe you can dream up a
way to imprint the drying last coat with a pattern like a fingerprint
or cross hatching.

          <div class="email-content">I would personally use another algorithm.  Cube Explorer is a good <br>
way to create your own efficient corner-flips.<br>
<br>
As for orientation, a 1 means that if you were to literally twist the <br>
corner, in place, clockwise ONCE, it would be oriented.  a 2 means <br>
that you would have to twist it clockwise, in place, TWICE to orient <br>
it.<br>

Hi Kenneth,

You might find this link interesting:

http://jpbrown.i8.com/cubesolver.html

a cube solving robot designed by a guy who can&#x27;t solve a cube.  It&#x27;s 
quite a cool robot and he gives good descriptions of various 
problems he had to troubleshoot.  Also a video of the robt in action.

Enjoy,
Rob

the public. Believe me error and boldness are fragile. <br>
Behind a magician hide the truth. He is a great cubist<br>
personel method, fewest algorythm with rubik&#x27;s cube,  a magician <br>
could not do better. He is just like god because he (god) would do <br>
it in four seconds for is 22 moves max. To see is hand in 27 <br>
secondes is better for the public! M.Guimond must know how to <br>
control is mind and hands. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all, i am inviting you to partake in a little excersise.  I am <br>
personally going to do it whether you do it or not but i thought i&#x27;d <br>
be nice enough to invite you haha :D<br>
ANy ways, i did this one time about 2 or 3 years ago.  I kept a <br>
small pocket notebook with me whereever i went and kept track of all <br>
my solves.  I did it for about 3 months.  I did real extensive <br>
records though like my solving time and what color i used and what <br>
method i used, but all you need to do is tally up your solves for <br>
one month and see how many times you solve the cube.  It isn&#x27;t <br>
supposed to be like a big honking: &quot;I MUST CUBE FOR 24 HOURS OF <br>
EVERY DAY FOR ONE MONTH TO BE THE ULTIMATE SUPREME GOD OF CUBING&quot;  <br>
this is a casual event, just to see about how many times you solve <br>
your cube.  <br>
People at school keep on asking me &quot;how many times have you solved <br>
that thing,&quot;  and i honestly dont know.  So this is a good way to <br>
find out and answer that question.  <br>
Am i rambling to much?  I dunno, I&#x27;m kinda tired and excitied at the <br>
same time and my brain doesnt know what to think.  I did throw up a <br>
page on my lovely geocities site for the contest, here is the link<br>
<br>
www.geocities.com/cubecrazy2/cubemain<br>
<br>
I think that is it.  The link may not work because my site has a <br>
poor bandwidth and it likes to take a breather after a couple of <br>
visits.   But basicaly start tallying up your 3x3 solves from the <br>
first day of the month untill the last.  Email your results to <br>
cubecrazy2@... and i will post your results on the page.  <br>
Please head your emails Monthly contest, or i wont read them.<br>
Also include your name and your count, and please dont send your all <br>
your tally marks because i wont count them, i have my own tally <br>
marks to figure out...<br>
<br>
Thanks much <br>

The Spring Tournament will take place on April 3, 2004 at Caltech and will be OFFICIAL!  <br>
Thanks to Dave Hedley Jones of Sevenstowns for providing trophies and stickers and their <br>
support.  Thanks also to Bob Fox of SpeedStacks for providing StackMats and Tournament <br>
Displays.  Also thanks to Assistant Professor of Astronomy Lynne Hillenbrand for being <br>
our independent judge.<br>
<br>
Place: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA<br>
Location: Winnett Lounge<br>
Date: Saturday, April 3, 2004<br>
Time: 11:45 AM - Check-In and Registration, 12:30 PM - Competition<br>
Event: 3x3x3 Speedsolve<br>
Prizes: Trophies Sponsered by Sevenstowns<br>
Early Entry Fee: $2 (Before April 1)<br>
Day-Of Entry Fee: $4<br>
E-Mail: tmao@... to enter.<br>
<br>
So far, I have three people signed up.  Yes, I realize it&#x27;s early and no one likes to do things <br>
until the last minute.<br>
<br>
Bob Fox is also kindly sending me a free set of SpeedStacks Cups... who&#x27;s up for an <br>
informal cup stacking competition?  I might be a fair event as I don&#x27;t think many people <br>
have had practice with them... (unless Macky does yet ANOTHER thing...).<br>
<br>
Also, check out the Caltech Rubik&#x27;s Cube Club&#x27;s Group at http://groups.yahoo.com/<br>
group/caltechrubiks/ where if you want to suggest anything, we&#x27;d be happy to hear your <br>
advice.  Also, we&#x27;re thinking of making t-shirts... and in fact, we&#x27;ve got a silk screening <br>
room and I&#x27;ve got a friend who I plan on abusing to make t-shirts.  Basically, you could <br>
send us a picture and we can get it silk screened for you.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I won&#x27;t bore you of too much of this...<br>
<br>
Oh... and let&#x27;s have a card sorting competition too.  I&#x27;ve been studying the DVD tutorial <br>
they sent me.  It&#x27;s really helpful.<br>

          <em>From:</em> tmao@...<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Sat, 28 Feb 2004 11:32:02 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">I hate myself... I really should just go to sleep.  Anyway, this is a tentative schedule.  If no <br>
one complains, I will reserve the rooms and it will become more of a set schedule.  After I <br>
reserve the rooms, the dates are pretty much set.  It is possible to change the dates pretty <br>
easily but... I think it would wreak havoc on everyone else&#x27;s plans.<br>
<br>
The tournament is currently planned for July 9-11, 2004.  Andy and Mike, I hope these <br>
dates work out for your summer camp and unicycle competition... if not, I can easily move <br>
it a week ahead or something.  (I want a unicycle!)<br>
<br>
The competition itself will be all in one day.  However, since I find it very unlikely for <br>
people to be able to fly into LAX in the morning, have enough energy to stand and <br>
compete, and then fly back, I am planning other events on the surrounding days.  It will be <br>
fun, we&#x27;ll get to meet each other, so just... think of it as a vacation.<br>
<br>
I will also talk to Caltech housing about possibly letting people stay in student housing for <br>
very cheap prices.  Anyway, here we go:<br>
<br>
Friday, July 9, 2004<br>
<br>
Noon to 6:00 PM - Registration:  People will be coming in at different times.  There is a <br>
shuttle service from LAX and Burbank airports called &quot;Supershuttle&quot; and I believe it&#x27;s about <br>
$20 for a one way trip which isn&#x27;t so bad.  I can also pick up people from the airport if you <br>
let me know ahead of time and get me your flight information... but we&#x27;ll see about that <br>
later.  Pretty much, just let us know when you&#x27;ll be arriving.  If you get here early, a <br>
Caltech student will be happy to show you around campus and around town.  Talk about <br>
the cube, see the legends of Caltech, hear about the cannon, the pumpkin drop, etc.<br>
<br>
6:00 PM - Opening Remarks, Dinner:  Possibly in Winnet Lounge.  It&#x27;ll be a nice summer <br>
day so this could take place outside of Winnet Lounge on the grass and tables.  My ideas is <br>
to get something like pizza or thai food or something.  If some cuber knows how to <br>
barbeque out there, that could work also.  My last attempt at cooking resulted in burning a <br>
cookie in the microwave.  This will also be of course a time to socialize.<br>
<br>
The Rest of the Evening - See Pasadena, etc.:  If you&#x27;re tired, sleeping is most certainly <br>
welcome also but there&#x27;s a lot to see and do in Old Town Pasadena.  Take a stroll down <br>
Colorado Boulevard... see the street that the Rose Parade goes down.  It&#x27;s quite an exciting <br>
place.  You could even stand on the sidewalk and probably cube for money.<br>
<br>
Saturday, July 10, 2004 - The Competition (In Baxter Lecture Hall)<br>
<br>
8 AM to 9 AM - Registration (for those who haven&#x27;t registered) and Sign-In (for those who <br>
have):  During this time, there will be opportunities to test out the timer.<br>
<br>
9 AM - 12 PM - 3x3x3 First Qualifying Round:  Every 3x3x3 competitor will have three <br>
solves with one popped solve allowed.  The top n people will advance.  The number in <br>
Toronto was 32 and I would like to keep it there if enough people show up.<br>
<br>
12 PM - 1 PM - Lunch:  Again, we can get simple lunch like Baja Fresh Burritos or pizza or <br>
Panda Express Chinese food.  Unless our school decides to give us funding (which we&#x27;ll be <br>
able to apply for in April), we&#x27;re going to have to ask for a certain amount of money to <br>
help cover the costs of food if you plan to partake.<br>
<br>
1 PM - 2 PM:  Non-Category Competitions.  We will hold the competitions for events such <br>
as the Rubik&#x27;s Magic, Rubik&#x27;s Master Magic, Rubik&#x27;s Clocks, Square-1, Megaminx, <br>
Pyraminx.<br>
<br>
2 PM - 4 PM:  3x3x3 Second Qualifying Round:  Those that make it will again get three <br>
solves with one popped solve allowed.  8 people will advance.  This number is subject to <br>
change depending on the number of entries.<br>
<br>
4 PM - 6 PM:  Cube-Category Competitions.  We will hold the competitions for the 2x2x2, <br>
4x4x4, and 5x5x5.  We will also have the One-Handed competition and blindfold 2x2x2, <br>
3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5 competitions.  There will also be a blindfold computer cube <br>
45x45x45 competition.<br>
<br>
6 PM - 7:30:  Dinner.  We&#x27;ll think of something.<br>
<br>
7:30 onward:  The finals for everything.  This means 3x3x3 and the other cube <br>
competitions (2x2x2, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5)  The other events, like at the WC, will not be <br>
multiple round events.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m thinking for the 3x3x3 finals, it will be average of 12.  I&#x27;m hoping people will agree <br>
with me that it would be nice to set an official record for the best &quot;average&quot; done at a <br>
tournament as single solves are really meaningless.  If someone gets lucky, the single <br>
solve record could be 8 seconds.<br>
<br>
Sunday, July 11<br>
<br>
On this day, the people who need to go of course can go.  Other than that, if anyone <br>
wanted to see more of the area, I&#x27;m sure arrangements could be made.  Who wants to go <br>
to Disneyland or Universal Studios... or something if you&#x27;re still around at this time.  If not, <br>
I guess that would be it and I&#x27;d hope to see you in Florida in 2005.<br>
<br>
Anyway... suggestions?  Comments?<br>

Something that I had been thinking about that would be good on a 
website for a while is this: have a section that lists the different 
methods for solving, and allow speedcubers to post sort of reviews 
of each method. You know, the pros/cons/experience with this method 
etc.

Do you already know how to do a single cube with two extra tiles <br>

11<br>

21<br>
12<br>

Yes, U *will* always fix it. You can even find out at the start 
*whether* you have to fix the parity (I think stiff_hands explains 
that on his page) by analyzing the corner permutation (or edge 
permutation, but that 12 instead of 8 cubies so takes longer). If 
you need to fix it, you could memorize as if you had already turned 
U and then do this as the very first move when blindfolded.

My only objection is that, apart from it being interestin, you don&#x27;t

like this. Look at my own designs in http://cube.misto.cz to 
understznd what I mean.

feats sound cooler than they are. He also talks about &quot;magic&quot;, which 
doesn&#x27;t surprise me then, since magic is about tricks.

Also, could it be that this Richard who praised Gaetan in this post 
and of whom neither this Yahoo group nor Google have ever heard 
before and whose writing style is very similar to Gaetan&#x27;s is just 
Gaetan himself? Or am I just paranoid? Hmm...

I had the idea of comparing 2 different methods of solving the cube 
(like CF and LBL) and see which one solves in the fewest moves on

          <div class="email-content">OMG!!! After readying these two messages, I am really excited. I <br>
wander off the cubing trail and you guys just lure me back in, lol. <br>
It&#x27;s 5AM and I&#x27;m wondering how much it cost for a round trip flight <br>
to CA... always wanted to visit the Caltech campus.<br>
<br>
I do need to prep a new cube and I&#x27;m desparate for stickers. There <br>
wouldn&#x27;t be any chance of inviting/getting Erno Rubik to come, would <br>
there? Curious if all the big names will show up. I&#x27;m all the CA <br>
cubers will surely be there though.<br>
<br>
I really appreciate what your trying to do for us all.<br>
Keep us posted, and don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for help! Planning an <br>
event like this must be very challenging.<br>
<br>
-Doug Li (currently bidding on Grant&#x27;s wc items :))<br>
p.s. Hopefully by then, we&#x27;ll get to see those cube documentaries <br>
we&#x27;ve been waiting for.<br>

&gt; I hate myself... I really should just go to sleep.  Anyway, this <br>
is a tentative schedule.  If no <br>
&gt; one complains, I will reserve the rooms and it will become more of <br>
a set schedule.  After I <br>
&gt; reserve the rooms, the dates are pretty much set.  It is possible <br>
to change the dates pretty <br>
&gt; easily but... I think it would wreak havoc on everyone else&#x27;s <br>
plans.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The tournament is currently planned for July 9-11, 2004.  Andy and <br>
Mike, I hope these <br>
&gt; dates work out for your summer camp and unicycle competition... if <br>
not, I can easily move <br>
&gt; it a week ahead or something.  (I want a unicycle!)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The competition itself will be all in one day.  However, since I <br>
find it very unlikely for <br>
&gt; people to be able to fly into LAX in the morning, have enough <br>
energy to stand and <br>
&gt; compete, and then fly back, I am planning other events on the <br>
surrounding days.  It will be <br>
&gt; fun, we&#x27;ll get to meet each other, so just... think of it as a <br>
vacation.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I will also talk to Caltech housing about possibly letting people <br>
stay in student housing for <br>
&gt; very cheap prices.  Anyway, here we go:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Friday, July 9, 2004<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Noon to 6:00 PM - Registration:  People will be coming in at <br>
different times.  There is a <br>
&gt; shuttle service from LAX and Burbank airports <br>
called &quot;Supershuttle&quot; and I believe it&#x27;s about <br>
&gt; $20 for a one way trip which isn&#x27;t so bad.  I can also pick up <br>
people from the airport if you <br>
&gt; let me know ahead of time and get me your flight information... <br>
but we&#x27;ll see about that <br>
&gt; later.  Pretty much, just let us know when you&#x27;ll be arriving.  If <br>
you get here early, a <br>
&gt; Caltech student will be happy to show you around campus and around <br>
town.  Talk about <br>
&gt; the cube, see the legends of Caltech, hear about the cannon, the <br>
pumpkin drop, etc.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 6:00 PM - Opening Remarks, Dinner:  Possibly in Winnet Lounge.  <br>
It&#x27;ll be a nice summer <br>
&gt; day so this could take place outside of Winnet Lounge on the grass <br>
and tables.  My ideas is <br>
&gt; to get something like pizza or thai food or something.  If some <br>
cuber knows how to <br>
&gt; barbeque out there, that could work also.  My last attempt at <br>
cooking resulted in burning a <br>
&gt; cookie in the microwave.  This will also be of course a time to <br>
socialize.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The Rest of the Evening - See Pasadena, etc.:  If you&#x27;re tired, <br>
sleeping is most certainly <br>
&gt; welcome also but there&#x27;s a lot to see and do in Old Town <br>
Pasadena.  Take a stroll down <br>
&gt; Colorado Boulevard... see the street that the Rose Parade goes <br>
down.  It&#x27;s quite an exciting <br>
&gt; place.  You could even stand on the sidewalk and probably cube for <br>
money.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Saturday, July 10, 2004 - The Competition (In Baxter Lecture Hall)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 8 AM to 9 AM - Registration (for those who haven&#x27;t registered) and <br>
Sign-In (for those who <br>
&gt; have):  During this time, there will be opportunities to test out <br>
the timer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 9 AM - 12 PM - 3x3x3 First Qualifying Round:  Every 3x3x3 <br>
competitor will have three <br>
&gt; solves with one popped solve allowed.  The top n people will <br>
advance.  The number in <br>
&gt; Toronto was 32 and I would like to keep it there if enough people <br>
show up.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 12 PM - 1 PM - Lunch:  Again, we can get simple lunch like Baja <br>
Fresh Burritos or pizza or <br>
&gt; Panda Express Chinese food.  Unless our school decides to give us <br>
funding (which we&#x27;ll be <br>
&gt; able to apply for in April), we&#x27;re going to have to ask for a <br>
certain amount of money to <br>
&gt; help cover the costs of food if you plan to partake.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1 PM - 2 PM:  Non-Category Competitions.  We will hold the <br>
competitions for events such <br>
&gt; as the Rubik&#x27;s Magic, Rubik&#x27;s Master Magic, Rubik&#x27;s Clocks, Square-<br>
1, Megaminx, <br>
&gt; Pyraminx.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2 PM - 4 PM:  3x3x3 Second Qualifying Round:  Those that make it <br>
will again get three <br>
&gt; solves with one popped solve allowed.  8 people will advance.  <br>
This number is subject to <br>
&gt; change depending on the number of entries.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 4 PM - 6 PM:  Cube-Category Competitions.  We will hold the <br>
competitions for the 2x2x2, <br>
&gt; 4x4x4, and 5x5x5.  We will also have the One-Handed competition <br>
and blindfold 2x2x2, <br>
&gt; 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5 competitions.  There will also be a <br>
blindfold computer cube <br>
&gt; 45x45x45 competition.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 6 PM - 7:30:  Dinner.  We&#x27;ll think of something.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 7:30 onward:  The finals for everything.  This means 3x3x3 and the <br>
other cube <br>
&gt; competitions (2x2x2, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5)  The other events, like at <br>
the WC, will not be <br>
&gt; multiple round events.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m thinking for the 3x3x3 finals, it will be average of 12.  I&#x27;m <br>
hoping people will agree <br>
&gt; with me that it would be nice to set an official record for the <br>
best &quot;average&quot; done at a <br>
&gt; tournament as single solves are really meaningless.  If someone <br>
gets lucky, the single <br>
&gt; solve record could be 8 seconds.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Sunday, July 11<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On this day, the people who need to go of course can go.  Other <br>
than that, if anyone <br>
&gt; wanted to see more of the area, I&#x27;m sure arrangements could be <br>
made.  Who wants to go <br>
&gt; to Disneyland or Universal Studios... or something if you&#x27;re still <br>
around at this time.  If not, <br>
&gt; I guess that would be it and I&#x27;d hope to see you in Florida in <br>
2005.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyway... suggestions?  Comments?<br>

          <div class="email-content">hahaha, yes that is an important component of going fast.

But make sure you don&#x27;t try to go too fast, because the hand is 
quicker than the eye as they say, and your hands will easily be able 
to reach a speed where you begin to not be able to follow the 
pieces. So just make sure that whilst you go fast, you also still 
look for the pieces, otherwise you will have pauses and your times 
will suffer rather than improve!

          <div class="email-content">I just started doing a similar thing.  I&#x27;ve been doing 50 
consecutive solves a day. Then figuring out the average, standard 
deviation, percent of solves under 20, and percent of solves under 
18.  Kind of interesting.  I put my excel file that I&#x27;m using to 
track this in the files section.

          <div class="email-content">Hey I&#x27;ve been thinking about something a lot lately.  I&#x27;m starting <br>
to really believe that a whole LOT of what makes a speedcuber is the <br>
algorithms you use for the final steps of your method.  I&#x27;ve always <br>
heard that people should find algorithms that fit your hands, but to <br>
me it seems odd that Peter Jansen&#x27;s algs seem to fit EVERYONE&#x27;s <br>
hands.  Perhaps there are algorithms that are better suited to be <br>
performed by human hands in general, and Peter has apparently <br>
compiled many of these.  Ever since I&#x27;ve started one by one slowly <br>
replacing my slowest LL alg with Peter&#x27;s alg I speed up around 0.5 <br>
seconds on average per alg.  It just seems odd to me that I was <br>
stuck at just above 20 seconds for almost 3 years using a certain <br>
set of LL algs, and within a month or two of starting to replace my <br>
algs I broke 20 seconds on average for the first time.  Now that <br>
I&#x27;ve learned a number of his algs I can break 20 seconds <br>
consistently.<br>
<br>
It seems that eventually all of us speedcubers will use the same <br>
algs and everyone will average around 15-17 seconds.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know maybe I&#x27;m just being weird, but I think a LOT of what <br>
makes a speedcuber (once you&#x27;ve figured out how to optimize the F2L) <br>
is simply how fast you can solve the LL.  And I think the algs you <br>
use are what make or break you here.<br>
<br>
Any opinions on this?  I&#x27;m curious if there are people out there who <br>
don&#x27;t like Peter&#x27;s algs?  I don&#x27;t mean to demean any of the work <br>
that Peter did to compile his list of LL algs, and so far I LOVE the <br>
algs of his that I&#x27;ve learned, I&#x27;m just curious if anyone anywhere <br>
doesn&#x27;t like one of Peter&#x27;s algs.  If there isn&#x27;t anyone that <br>
doesn&#x27;t like Peter&#x27;s algs, perhaps they are the ones that are <br>
optimized for human hands in general, and therefore anyone using <br>
them would find them to be very fast.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok, since Im the one that likes to construct arguments
as a separate hobby, I would like to say:

Makes sense doesn&#x27;t it?

about your theory Chris.

lets divide methodology of the LBL methods into two
submethods

f2L - LL

now further into four methods (COx = Cross on D,L,R,
or U)
COx F2L - OLL PLL

now, analyzing these two sub groups in terms of
algorithms:

1 41 - 57 21

since the Cross step is usually intuitive, we&#x27;ll give
it a 1 since the &quot;algorithm&quot; is usually something you
make up during inspection

adding it all up

1 + 41 + 57 + 21 = 120

42/120 = F2L
78/120 = LL

now, just by standard mathematics, we see that the LL
has more memorizable situations...therefore more
algorithms to learn to accomplish your goals.

since the LL clearly is more heavy concerning the
amount you have to learn (and therefore the amount you
must cycle through in your head [algorithm
recognition]), it is understandable that any
reduction, or balancing in the ease of those
algorithms or quality would affect your time in a
positive way.

I may not make any sense to you...but I do to me and
thats all that counts I suppose.

          <div class="email-content">Ok ok... it is completed, enjoy it :)

For all found solutions see http://rubikscube.info/duncan/
There is also a discussion about improvements etc.
The computation was quite fast (several minutes for all sequences).
The manual processing was then slower (evening part) :).

Some comments to the previously found sequences:
- most of short sequences were optimal and it is double-checked now.
- the original sequence #6 seems bad (first time I thougth that
my program has a bug, because it found longer sequence, but
then I checked the original one and it seems to be the
unflipped/unflipped case).
- all sequences are at most 11 face-turns long

It would be nice if you discuss any further progress to see
how the method is going.
Contact me (gloom@...) if you want other sequences.
However, the previous steps are quite well known and
the last step can be solved in any optimal cube solver
(reid&#x27;s, kociemba&#x27;s, mine...). So it could be useful for
further experiments and method improval/change.

Let me know, if my work was useful..

Best regards,

Josef

to a similar problem, let me know...

Wow, Josef, are you doing all this free of charge? :-)

Everybody wants to find his original method and put his name on it, so
you may receive a lot of work.

There are many slightly different approaches based on F2L, the problem
is they don&#x27;t seem faster than Jessica&#x27;s.

I&#x27;m a bit surprised noone proposed something like this:
- cross
- 2 F2L pairs
- 1 F2L pair + orient remaining edges (*)
- 1 F2L pair + orient LL corners (**)
- LL permutation

It looks like another petrofridrich hybrid. Just in case you are
interested in searching for (*) and (**) sequences ;-)

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, it is free of charge, but noone should blame me if
I reject a request (there was not such a case anyway) ;).
I do it for fun and to improve my program also for free.
(However, any kind of support is of course welcome :))

Is somebody willing to make some contribution to my program
(mainly GUI and documentation - program is in Java now)?

I do not think many people are going to ask me for help.

Your proposed method looks interesting. However, the third pair
+ orienting edges is not as straightforward as it may seem, because
you still have the last F2L edge unsolved and it may result
in increasing the number of sequences and slower recognition.
The similar problems apply to the last pair + orienting all corners.

If you prepare the situations for (*) and (**) (as Duncan did)
I can try to get some results.
(Even pointing a bad way can be useful to followers :)).

Regards,

Josef

PS: I do not know If fixed, but several years ago I tried to
optimize Fridrich&#x27;s sequences to place corner-edge pairs for F2L
and found an improvement (I do not remember more details).
Has someone already checked and/or optimized them.

          <div class="email-content">I have got a new cube from the rubik&#x27;s studio in Budapest.
It came in small blue carton package (exactly to fit the cube in)
without any booklet (who cares, right? :)).
How big was the surprise, that after many years of BOY colorings
or white-blue ones with dull orange stickers and relatively
bright red (or red-brown) the new cube had exactly the same
contrast colors as the original Arxon cubes with neon orange,
really dark red-brown, and saturated yellow and YOB coloring.
(Arxon cubes were mostly YOB).
It is enen more interesting, because the coloring is not the
standard BOY shown on rubiks.com and I got an older rubik&#x27;s
studio cube in different packaging before with BOY and dull orange...
The quality seems equal to Arxon cubes (adjustable screws,
removable center caps, plastic stickers, mechanism...)

If anyone interested I can make some photos for comparision.

Regards,

Josef

          <div class="email-content">assuming a general fridrich approach, i think what makes a 
speedcubist is 2/3 F2L and 1/3 LL.

the LL is relatively simple compared to F2L, in my opinion.

ironicly, when you look at a list of algs, there are 
fewer &quot;theoretical&quot; cases listed for F2L compared to the theoretical 
cases listed for LL, but there are way more &quot;real-life&quot; cases in 
F2L.  it requires improvisation to map the real-life case to the 
correct theoretical case by apply a move or two and/or changing grip 
position.  it is this improvisation that makes (or breaks) a 
speedcubist, in my opinion.

furthermore, a top speed cubist will place all 4 corner-edge pairs 
in 8 seconds total.  a top speed cubist will solve the LL in about 6-
7 seconds total.  now suppose you get a whole bunch of beginners and 
have half of them work *only* on CE pairs, and the other half work 
*only* on LL.  i believe it will take far less practice for those 
working on LL to reach expert-level LL times (6-7 seconds), than for 
those working on F2L to reach expert-level F2L times (8 seconds).

again, all in my opinion.

          <div class="email-content">Many many thanks Josef.  I have yet to go through it all but it looks very
easy to follow and the results are great.  I will certainly be working on
the method in the future and will let you know how it is progressing.  If
the next step starts to look feasible to move a step closer to a one look LL
I shall certainly request some more algorithms - hope you will give up your
time to help out again!

&gt; I&#x27;m a bit surprised noone proposed something like this:<br>
&gt; - cross<br>
&gt; - 2 F2L pairs<br>
&gt; - 1 F2L pair + orient remaining edges (*)<br>
&gt; - 1 F2L pair + orient LL corners (**)<br>
&gt; - LL permutation<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It looks like another petrofridrich hybrid. Just in case you are<br>
&gt; interested in searching for (*) and (**) sequences ;-)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Gilles.<br>
<br>
Hi<br>
<br>
Have you worked out the number of cases for **? there are 27<br>
orientations and severall permutations, giving well over a hundred<br>
cases... I tried once: I usually got between 11 and 13 turns with<br>
ron&#x27;s solver, which compared with 7 + 7 with petrus pair + fridrich<br>
orientation: that&#x27;s almost never a worthwhile trade.<br>
<br>
I think the best evolution is in knowing how to be lucky: If there are<br>
two petrus algs for the pair, of which one orients all the corners,<br>
then you&#x27;ve saved yourself 7 moves: that has to be 2-3 seconds in<br>
speedcubing...<br>

never talked to him about it ;-) I also feared Dror might beat me 
because I think he once said he had ordered a Megaminx.

Furthermore, I believe I do it quite differently than Richard, both 
memorization and solving. I&#x27;ll probably post some suggestion some 
time, but for now maybe let me solve some other stuff as well (wanna 
get the 4x4 and 5x5 now) before I do so (similarly like you maybe 
let someone keep his new speedsolving method secret).

I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if others followed me soon, though. It&#x27;s 
actually quite easy. Almost anybody in this group is capable of 
doing this. Even if they say rubbish like &quot;My mind simply does not 
work this way&quot;. That only shows me they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re 
talking about, similarly to when some non-cuber says he will never 
be able to solve the cube (normal way, not blindfolded). We know any 
healthy non-baby human can, right?

Have you tried flower pots already? They&#x27;re of strong plastic and 
have holes at the bottom that will let air through. I&#x27;m curious 
whether they&#x27;re any good for cupstacking, so if somebody tries this, 
please let us know :-)

          <div class="email-content">Wow, that&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;ve been meaning to do that for some time but my school is very 
academically unforgiving.  That&#x27;s basically the same method I teach people except I have 
them orient the corners before permuting the corners.  I do this because it&#x27;s not only 
&quot;easier to see&quot; but also more &quot;Fridrich&quot;  so everything is oriented first.

Yeah, that&#x27;s really a nice page.  How did you make the pictures for the cube?  Instead of a 
webpage, over winter break I made a CD with video clips using a digital camera.  
Unfortunately it&#x27;s about 500 MB large... not quite as easily accessible as the webpage.

Again, you&#x27;re awesome!

Yeah, I figured nobody else was crazy enough to try it, so I put it 
aside to work on 3+3+4+5. Had I known there was competition I might 
have delayed my 3,3,4,5 (which took ages to finally get right).
Well done on your achievement!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jasmine!

That&#x27;s a pretty neat page. But then again most girls make neater web 
sites than most guys ... ;-)

The method u describe is pretty much like my current &quot;speed&quot; method. 
I use some more advanced 3-cycles for the middle layer. And for the 
last layer i do corners first, then the edges. 4 looks altogether. 
And with that method i can do 30 secs avg when i make my cubing flow 
well :-)

Just a suggestion which will make ur page a bit more user-friendly 
for some. Show ur algs with java applets ;-)

Happy cubing!!

I can&#x27;t take it anymore!!!!!  It&#x27;s been 6 months since the WC and I <br>
need a Rubiks competition....  So, I bit the bullet today and bought <br>
airplane tickets for the April 3rd Championship at CalTech.<br>
<br>
Since I&#x27;m from Texas, you now have a multi-state competition.<br>
<br>
Anyone else care to make it a multi multi-state competition (was that <br>
redundant)?<br>
<br>
See you in four weeks!<br>

&gt; Day-Of Entry Fee: $4<br>
&gt; E-Mail: tmao@i... to enter.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So far, I have three people signed up.  Yes, I realize it&#x27;s early <br>
and no one likes to do things <br>
&gt; until the last minute.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Bob Fox is also kindly sending me a free set of SpeedStacks Cups... <br>
who&#x27;s up for an <br>
&gt; informal cup stacking competition?  I might be a fair event as I <br>
don&#x27;t think many people <br>
&gt; have had practice with them... (unless Macky does yet ANOTHER <br>
thing...).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Also, check out the Caltech Rubik&#x27;s Cube Club&#x27;s Group at <br>

we&#x27;ve got a silk screening <br>

Basically, you could <br>

&gt; Anyway, I won&#x27;t bore you of too much of this...<br>

I&#x27;m pretty sure I can accommodate that.  I mean... as long as it&#x27;s not 30 people from out of

MIke, I thought your parents weren&#x27;t so fond of you going to both a unicycle and cube 
competition?  If school was not an issue, would they actually support a plane ticket from 
Idaho?

Where&#x27;s Brent Morgan?!?  Arizona isn&#x27;t so far away!

I think I&#x27;ll have to get a prize for the furthest competitor.

<br>
I never created an applet, but I used Josef Jelineks applet to create <br>
a page where you can easily enter the scrambling algs for several <br>
contests. I know that my previous page, the one with the timer, <br>
wasn&#x27;t supporting Netscape, so this will make up for that.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you want anything changed.<br>
<br>
Simply paste the scrambling algorithm in the box and press SET.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Josef for his applet. I found it is the only one supporting <br>
the xyz syntax.<br>

I&#x27;m trying to look at the cube as a Lights Out puzzle.<br>
<br>
People see the cube as 12 different edges and 8 different corners.<br>
But before you get to know the cube, it looks like a perfect 3x3x3<br>
matrix of 27 identical 6-color cubies with 24 possible orientations.<br>
<br>
When you turn a side, imagine that you don&#x27;t swap different corners<br>
and edges, but you just make cubies spin at their location.<br>
An action makes changes in a neighbourhood...<br>
24 light intensities...<br>
Ok ok, it&#x27;s much much more complicated than standard Lights Out,<br>
because actions are anisotropic and context-dependent.<br>
<br>
Ideas?<br>

Yes it is. Its (non-visible) colours always match the colours of the<br>
face centres of the cube, so it is always oriented correctly.<br>

One project I&#x27;ve been working on a bit is an applet that allows any<br>
size cuboid, and which also shows the inside cubes. I do indeed model<br>
it as a block of identical small cubes, so that only their<br>
orientations are changed.<br>
<br>
This project is far from completed, and I&#x27;m not spending much time on<br>
it right now, but it will see the light of day some time.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
really good work. This page can be very useful when using the applet
in web pages and you want to test sequences interactively!

I think you should show possible moves (their textual
representations) on the page and/or a link to the original
page of the applet (http://software.rubikscube.info/AnimCube).

It is good especially for the X,Y,Z turns that are not
consistent on all pages (it is not really intuitive
which axis corresponds to which face).
However, Rc, Rc2, Rc&#x27;, Uc, ... can be used instead...

It is possible to use also other features as messages, delays, ...
(try input &quot;{Hello}.{world}&quot; and play it :))

Best regards,

Josef

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

On larger cubes than 3x3x3 this breaks down. Well for odd sized 
regular cubes we will always have the &quot;middle&quot; cubicle in correct 
orientation. But for other cubicles not being in the middle and not 
being an outer cubicle they can be in &quot;incorrect place&quot; and out of 
orientation. I have plans to make such a 4x4x4 &quot;super-supercube&quot; in 
software where each of the 64 cubicles has 6 colored faces, and where 
all have to be aligned for it to be solved. All i need is the time to 
get on with it ;-) It can be solved &quot;inside-out&quot;: first solve middle 
2x2x2 cube and then solve the rest with outer slice moves and 3-
cycles. Maybe there are more efficient ways to solve it ??

algorithms, I&#x27;d say it depends on the algorithms you use. If you&#x27;re
using only a few and  simple intuitive sequences then they shouldn&#x27;t
be too hard to do right. But that&#x27;s my opinion before having tried it
;-) For normal one-handed solving I don&#x27;t use most of my two-handed
algs simply because only my hands remember them and if one of the two
is missing that&#x27;s bad :-)

I&#x27;ve always heard it said that someone &quot;has it down cold&quot; - to imply <br>
that they know something perfectly.  I usually hear it more in <br>
reference to a performance thing, like having a piano piece &quot;down <br>
cold&quot;, therefore being able to perform it flawlessly.<br>

Well, what with my memory for algorithms not being so good, I&#x27;ve 
realized tonight that I can&#x27;t solve the thing sighted anymore so I 
won&#x27;t be getting it done blindfolded for some time (even though it 
requires only 4 algorithms, I can&#x27;t remember any of them at the 
moment!).

I was wondering, concerning Katsu&#x27;s ultimate mixes, whether anyone <br>
has come up with a one for the megaminx. Since each side only <br>
involves 11 pieces perhaps it is possible to get each side having 11 <br>
different colours simultaneously (or on a 6 colour megaminx, 5 edges <br>
all different colours, 5 corners all different colours (but same as <br>
said edges in some order) and the centre different again; also with <br>
no adjacent edge and colour on a face the same colour).<br>

Been there done that. The hardest parts are keeping the orientation 
of the physical cube OK, cramp in the hand and jamming cubes. I also 
inspected only using one hand (though I scrambled with 2!) as I 
figure it&#x27;s part of the procedure (and it takes a bit longer too).

Another one that I did was to get one scrambled stae to another (on a 
target cube). This is not so hard as it&#x27;s just a question of mapping 
the target cube as a solved cube and then using the appropriate 
orientations and permutations on the cube to solve. (Thus you &quot;solve&quot; 
to the other scrambled state.)

There is an official US Championship this summer, but the one they&#x27;re

          <div class="email-content">Hey Brent,

So there&#x27;s a tournament in April.  It is a local tournament but it is offic=
ial so if you set a 
record there, it will be the official record.

I&#x27;m working on setting up a US Championship for July 9 to 11.

I&#x27;m pretty close to getting the hall:

Good morning Tyson,

I need to get additional information on this event, so please call me x3828=
.

Thank you,
Victoria

Dear Ms. Seas,

Would it be possible to reserve Baxter Lecture Hall for the entire day of J=
uly 10, 2004?  I 
hope to hold the 2004 US Rubik&#x27;s Cube championships at Caltech.

-Tyson


So... I went to go find her but she was out for the day.  I&#x27;ll be able to t=
alk to her tomorrow 
and hopefully confirm the room reservation later on Thursday or Friday.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

two photos of three relatively new cubes are now in
&quot;Photos/Cube Colors&quot;.

The first cube is new Rubik studio one with bright orange
and really dark red/brown. It has YOB scheme.

The second one is a little older Rubik studio cube with
not so bright orange color. It has BOY scheme.
Both cubes have strong good quality plastic stickers.

The third cube is the Hessport&#x27;s one (originally with
color cube logo - which disappeared). It has
much less contrast colors and orange and red colors are
closer to each other. It has good quality plastic stickers,
but much thinner, so the black cubie color affects the
sticker color (see the yellow and orange)...

All three cubes are durable and really good for speedcubing.
The only disadvantage of the Hessport&#x27;s cube is the
absence of adjustable screws.

If there is any interest, I can compare more cubes and
eventually make a web page. I can compare even 4x4x4 and 5x5x5,
because there are more types available, but some are better...

Regards,

Josef

If 12, use a commutator in LL:

- Turn LL.

I know I worked on this - I just can&#x27;t remember if I was successful <br>

pretty close, at least.<br>

I started out my putting all edges in place, but flipped.  That gave <br>
6 distinct colors (5 edges + 1 center).  Then, I think I put corners <br>
nearly directly opposite on the puzzle, and turned them, but I don&#x27;t <br>
remember - I may have run into a problem on the last couple of faces <br>
because of the corners&#x27; twist.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

I installed that .exe-file just for the fun of it. It was pretty 
harmless stuff. In task manager though i noticed it used quite alot 
of resources, about 50% on my 1 GB RAM 2.5 GHz computer. And running 
netstat from command prompt i found it opened lots of ports. Also it 
sent out fake emails, just like the one i originally got.

To get rid of it simply delete 2 files in the %windows%\system32 
folder. They were called i????.*. Sorry can&#x27;t recall exactly :D But 
they will be 2 of the most recent files in that folder. After 
deleting those 2 files all is fine. Many ports may remain open until 
u reboot ur pc.

By the way, the virus is called Bagle@mm or similar...

While it can be done that way, I think I&#x27;d recommend taking a <br>
different approach to the LL.  I&#x27;d recommend doing edges <br>
(orient/permute) and then corners (orient/permute), instead of orient <br>
(edges/corners) and then permute (edges/corners).<br>
<br>
For more on the way I do this, check out my solution at <br>

Don&#x27;t be scared off by the list of algs; it&#x27;s not all that many, and <br>
you don&#x27;t even need to use most of them.  You can just learn a couple <br>
of them and apply those more than once as necessary for other cases.<br>

If you have a 6 color puzzle, that&#x27;s completely normal.  If you have <br>
a 12 color minx, then someone took it apart without telling you.  I <br>
don&#x27;t have time work out the parity fix at the moment, but I believe <br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m very impressed that you can average 30s with basically this 
method. I can&#x27;t get 30s with this method, in fact, I can very rarely 
get that fast even with a 3-look LL!

I know there are people here who can achieve pretty fast times with a 
method like this, but I thought it might freak out some newbie cubers 
if I said they should be able to get to 30s with this method 
(especially since I can&#x27;t!). I wrote &quot;60s&quot; because I thought it 
sounds pretty fast to a non-cuber, and it&#x27;s something that should be 
achievable without heaps and heaps of effort. I thought if I say 
something like 30s then beginners might not believe it. Having said 
this, I decided to amend that sentence and say &#x27;60s&#x27; but add that 30s 
is possible.

As for the java applets... yeah, I thought of this too, but decided 
to add it to the I&#x27;ll-do-it-later list!  ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jasmine!

Yes with a 3 look LL you should be faster than with a 4-look LL. But 
the time spent is not directly proportional to the number of total 
moves for ur algs. What you need is algs that fit how u &quot;perceive&quot; 
the cube so you don&#x27;t spend &quot;any&quot; time on recognition. That way you 
get a good flow.

How are you getting on with proceeding to a 2-look LL. Myself i&#x27;m too 
lazy to learn too many algs :D So i stick to the method i&#x27;ve known 
for 20+ yrs :-)

And also do you cube 4x4x4 or 5x5x5? Ok now i gotta now ...

          <div class="email-content">>How can you solve the cube in 30-35 moves ?

Yes, the average number of moves is probably around 55 for 
a &quot;classical&quot; method, but you get several tries at the same 
scramble, so it is not unreasonable to find a solve which has 
a &quot;well below&quot; average move count. This may include finding 
solutions with lucky cases, such as missing out a step, or knowing 
algorithms to perform 2 steps in 1. David Wesley is very creative 
like this, you can browse the archive and find some of his solutions.

> do you use another method ?
But the fewest moves masters do tend to use techniques special to 
the FMC. I encourage you to look at the archives, especially at 
Mirek Goljan, Lars Petrus, Charles Tsai, and Zbigniew Zborowski.

Gilles Roux also uses his own method, which works equally well for 
speedcubing and for FMC.

There are at least 2 common methods in existence - one is described 
on stiffhand&#x27;s site and the other on Jessica&#x27;s site.
There are also less common methods around. It probably depends on 
what you mean by memorizing. Do you mean to learn the method or, 
having learnt the method, to memorize the cube for solving?
If you mean to learn the method I imagine that neither of the 2 
common methods requires a lot of memorization - you only need a 
handful of moves.
The fastest method could be up to debate too - the unofficial record 
and the official record were done using different methods.
In terms of potential for speed (if it could be mastered), I would 
think that BCFSSS would be the fastest method (but it is still in 
development) because the average number of moves to solve will be 
very small compared with other blindfold methods. Of completed 
methods BCFTSS perhaps has the potential for being the fastest but it 
requires the user to learn the method well and that is not easy - as 
those who have seen the document can attest.
You&#x27;d have to have a very good memory to be able to master BCFSSS (or 
indeed even BCFTSS) though - the chapter on corner permutation 
algorithms alone runs to over 500 pages.

That&#x27;s true - you only really need 4 algorithms (actually, you could 
use less, but it would be a pain) although 5 or 6 will help. Dave 
Orser uses quite a lot though - he uses a shortened version of BCFTSS 
with selected algorithms.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

I know I could definitely get faster times if I was better at looking 
ahead. I occasionally get times around 30-35s, but I&#x27;m usually well 
into the 40-45s range. I know there are people here who can do sub-
20s with a 3-look LL, so I *should* be able to to it much faster.

I&#x27;m not learning the 2-look LL yet. I reckon there&#x27;s still a lot more 
I can get out of a 3-look LL. Maybe when I can average sub-30s with 
the 3-look LL, I&#x27;ll move on to the 2-look LL. :)

Yeah, I also do the 4x4x4 and the 5x5x5, but not especially fast! :)

          <div class="email-content">Jake,

I think this is a sign you should ease up a bit on the cubing, at 
least for a little while. And any other activity that puts stress on 
your wrists (eg. computer use). Even if you aren&#x27;t cubing much, if 
you spend all day at the computer then that&#x27;s a lot of strain on your 
wrists. If you can, try to reduce the amount of time you spend doing 
this stuff. If you can&#x27;t, then at least try not to cube/type 
constantly for long periods of time. Take regular breaks, even if 
just for a few minutes. And maybe do some regular wrist stretches too.

Look after yourself!

Jasmine.

          <div class="email-content">A mass-mailing virus appears to be making it&#x27;s way around some of <br>
this group. I checked out some anti-virus sites (including Symantec) <br>
and from what I read, it appears to be a fairly new one and it&#x27;s not <br>
a hoax.<br>
<br>
The other day I received an infected attachment which looked like it <br>
came from someone here. I&#x27;m sure it was not intentional, so I just <br>
emailed the person and suggested he update his virus definitions.  He <br>
told me that he had also received infected emails that appeared to <br>
come from people in this group.<br>
<br>
To prevent this spreading any further, I&#x27;d suggest that we all update <br>
our virus definitions today and scan our machines. If you don&#x27;t have <br>
any anti-virus software, then you can download a free virus checker <br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, I still don&#x27;t know if I had completely figured it out before, <br>
but now I&#x27;ve got it. I&#x27;m not completely sure how to describe it, <br>
though :-P The edges are as I said before - all in position, but <br>
flipped.<br>
<br>
For the corners, I&#x27;ll first discuss position.  I don&#x27;t have a method <br>
for getting to this state, since I just solved to it, and didn&#x27;t get <br>
there from a solved puzzle; it&#x27;s a shame we don&#x27;t have an optimal <br>
minx solver :-(  Instead, I&#x27;ll just describe which corners need to be <br>
swapped (10 pairs) :<br>
1) Hold the minx with an obvious choice for U and F<br>
2) Swap the corners at the back of U and at the bottom of F<br>
3) Rotate around U, and repeat for each of the 5 pairs<br>
4) Put the face opposite the original U on U, and repeat for the <br>
other 5 pairs of corners.<br>
<br>
For corner orientation, pick any face other than the original U and <br>
D.  Note that 1 color will be shared by 4 of the 5 corners on that <br>
face. This color has to be twisted the same direction away from that <br>
face on all four of the corners.  There are two choices as to which <br>
way you can go.  Alternatively, look at the other corner (that <br>
doesn&#x27;t have the shared color), and choose one of the 2 valid ways it <br>
can go.  Once you&#x27;ve done one of these two, the orientation of the <br>
rest of the corners can be determined by looking at what colors are <br>
already present on each face, and adjusting accordingly (I&#x27;m pretty <br>
sure - that&#x27;s what I did, but I may have gotten lucky).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m guessing there are probably quite a few other ways to do <br>
the &quot;ultimate mix&quot;, but this one is actually a nice pattern. <br>
Basically, you end up with:<br>
- All edges in place but flipped<br>
- All corners for U and D one position away from the opposite face, <br>
and the U or D color is facing the same direction around the puzzle<br>
- All but 1 corner for each of the other faces on the opposite face <br>
with the same twist (the other corner is just one space off of the <br>
opposite face).<br>
<br>
I know it doesn&#x27;t work with all corners in place, because you&#x27;d have <br>
to rotate all corners the same direction, which is impossible... I <br>
don&#x27;t know what other restrictions apply  to solving this puzzle.<br>

&gt; I started out my putting all edges in place, but flipped.  That<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jake, here&#x27;s a hand stretch that helps if your fingers are numb 
and tingling like that.  Hold your hand out with all your fingers 
stretched out.  Bend one finger down and try to bend all your other 
fingers up at the same time.  Do this for each finger.  I found this 
stretch on a site about carpal tunnel, and it seems to help for 
Rubik&#x27;s wrist too (not sure if those are even related but they might 
be).

If that doesn&#x27;t work you can ice your arm and wrist and just lay off 
for a few days and it should go away.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Dan is exactly right. What to add, ...
IMHO, currently everybody who solves the cube under 35 moves follows 
the same recipe: 
gether the pieces as quickly as possible without using any algorithm 
and hope for luck at the end of the process where you might use some 
sequences you know. If you are not lucky try again from some point. 
Always learn from the process. There are some modifications and small 
tricks but the basic recipe still remains there.

Almost opposite edges:

Apply the inverses of these algs to a solved Megaminx to see what

It does not affect the corners, only three edges. It&#x27;s 16 or 17 
turns, although 20 ticks as well. I think Grant&#x27;s is faster though, 
due to those long repetitive parts. But if you just want to affect

Before I seriously play with it, I&#x27;d like to protect it. I think 
those Eastsheen stickers are paper-based, so I&#x27;m a little worried

using nail polish or something else over stickers to protect them?

I can also subscribe to the opinion that ur 5x5x5 supercube looks 
awesome. But personally i find that it all looks a bit cluttered. I 
would not have a face on a cubicle multicolored. It would be enough 
to cut out some arrows with a stanley. Maybe only on the facecenters, 
or possibly also on 3 of the edges to see which way the whole &quot;3x3 
facecenter&quot; should be oriented.

Then agan i have only 1 operational 5x5x5 cube and i keep it as a 
normal cube for now :D

<br>
&gt; for olly&#x27;s way of orienting the corners, what is the easiest way <br>
to determine &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; in    x (LD2L&#x27;F&#x27;D2F) x&#x27;  Y(F&#x27;D2FLD2L&#x27;) Y&#x27;<br>
<br>
The corner you wish to rotate one clockwise should be in the FUL <br>
position after x, and the corner you wish to rotate anti-clockise <br>
should be in the same position after y. Hope that helps.<br>
<br>
I suspect that the question about corner twist not being 0 is about <br>
whether the twist for a layer is 0 if you have been reading my <br>
pages. That value is irrelevant in practice. If it is 1 or 2 then it <br>
means you will have to perform a twist of a corner from the top <br>
layer at the same time as one from the bottom layer, wherease if it <br>
is 0 then you can correct the orientation of the corners by doing <br>
corner twists of corners in the same layer.<br>

Hope this is of help.<br>

Btw, I just put up a page that describes how to use a single

problem completely (actually I think I can say it &quot;ignores&quot; it ;-):

Subject: [Speed cubing group] New mass mailing virus<br>
<br>
<br>
A mass-mailing virus appears to be making it&#x27;s way around some of<br>
this group. I checked out some anti-virus sites (including Symantec)<br>
and from what I read, it appears to be a fairly new one and it&#x27;s not<br>
a hoax.<br>
<br>
The other day I received an infected attachment which looked like it<br>
came from someone here. I&#x27;m sure it was not intentional, so I just<br>
emailed the person and suggested he update his virus definitions.  He<br>
told me that he had also received infected emails that appeared to<br>
come from people in this group.<br>
<br>
To prevent this spreading any further, I&#x27;d suggest that we all update<br>
our virus definitions today and scan our machines. If you don&#x27;t have<br>
any anti-virus software, then you can download a free virus checker<br>
here: http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_dwnl_free.php<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone,<br>

BCFTSS (Blindfold Cubing For The Seriously Sad) is &quot;the 
intermediate&quot; stage in the Carr system of blindfold cubing - it was 
going to be the advanced stage at one time and the intermediate 
stage was going to be between it and the basic stage (as linked to 
in the links section).
It&#x27;s about 124 pages long (but it includes extra stuff like solving 
the megaminx blindfolded and so forth).

BCFSSS (Blindfold Cubing For Seriously Sad Savants) is &quot;the 
advanced&quot; stage in the Carr system of blindfold cubing. As yet it is 
still unfinished. It is better laid out than BCFTSS but it is also 
much larger. The part on corner permutations alone is almost 600 
pages long.

Phases of BCFSSS for instance are:

1. Correct signature problem (if any) - average 1/8 turn (i.e. 1/2 a 
quarter turn or 1/2 move)
2. Orient corners
3. Orient edges
(These 3 stages can be done in different orders - I am also looking 
at combining stages 2 and 3).
4. Permute corners
5. Permute edges (possibly in 2 steps)

The combining of 2. and 3. into one stage is not finished at the 
moment (and will not be for a while as I no longer have access to a 
cube optimizer).
Part 5. also has a fair way to go.
Parts 1., 2., 3., 4. (as individual stages) are complete. 5. has 
been done for 2 steps but not 1 as yet and it hasn&#x27;t been tabulated 
in the same nice way that stages 1-4 have been.

For BCFTSS things are a bit slower in the latter 2 stages which are 
more broken up like this (again not necessarily in the exact order):
(Stage 1. is done later)
4. Corners to correct layers
5. Middle edges to middle layers
6. Complete middle layer
7. Other edges to correct layer
8. Synchronise signatures in U &amp; D layers (corners with edges)
9. PLL for U face and for D face.

The megaminx I use was purchased from mefferts, 6 color stickered 
version.  When the minx arrived the stickers were in terrible shape, 
and some had already fallen off, so I painted it with 12 different 
colors of craft paint from wal-mart/hobby lobby.

I really wish I had ordered the tiles from Mefferts when they had 
them though!  This paint chips pretty bad so I have to cut my 
fingernails short or I can&#x27;t play with it.  It still has to be 
repainted every other month or so, and the paint flakes off and gets 
in the seams, so it requires cleaning quite often.

I&#x27;ll look into the problems some are having with the video, I&#x27;ll see 
if I can encode it that small with a standard windows CoDec.  problem 
is I only have 10Mb of web space and my 7.5MB minx video + my 2.33 MB 
cube video take up most of it.

And I&#x27;d like to apologize for the TERRIBLE sentance construction in 
my original post about the video, I got comma happy ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hey!!

What u are looking for is probably the so-called Fridrich, named 
after the &quot;godmother ;-)&quot; of cubists, Jessica Fridrich. There are 
probaly many sites describing this method, but her own site can be 
found here :

http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html 

And after those middle-layer-edge/top-corner stuff u proceed to the 
rest of the Fridrich method: orientation and positioning of last 
layer. When u learn all that and minimize ur time spent on 
recognition between sequences, then u have the methodology used by 
many of the best cubers in the world :D

Best of luck :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Doug, Tyson and I already have something like this in the 
works.  We&#x27;re still working on the date, but we have brought up the 
idea to hold a joint Eastern Championship and Western Championship 
at the same time.  This is still in the works and not very well 
planned yet, but it definitely seems like something we are both 
interested in.  If anyone who lives in the Midwest would like to set 
up a tournament for people in the middle of the US (so you don&#x27;t 
have to travel to one of the far sides of the continent to go to 
this competition) then we could have three or more venues and one 
big US competition.  I am really keen on the idea, and already have 
several contacts to ask for volunteering as well as a contact for a 
really good venue on my campus.  I&#x27;m just waiting for a hard and 
fast date that would be good to do this, assuming we do it at all, 
before I really start hitting people up for volunteer time and the 
venue.  If we can get a number of people to plan this out really 
well, I think this could be a huge event.  Would people be 
interested in something before or after the 2005 World championship?

Let me know what you want and I&#x27;ll see. I need to go back to my 
apt., look it up and then go off to an internet cafe (as I don&#x27;t 
have web access from my place, so it might take a little while) and 
I can (hopefully) send post the algorithm here.

Not a dissertation or a thesis - it&#x27;s hardly difficult enough to be 
qualified as one of those! Not really for fun either! I just wanted 
to make a better blindfold system (and perhaps there&#x27;s a slightly 
more advanced goal for afterwards, perhaps BCFSSSI). It is a lot of 
work - I set up the aicop group to try to spread the load and posted 
a whole load of sub-optimal algorithms in a GIMPS (Great Internet 
Mersenne Prime Search) type project) but it didn&#x27;t work out and I 
ended up optimizing them all myself.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brent,
No it won&#x27;t be a qualifier. The 2005 anniversary championship is under
discussion between myself (Dave @ Seven Towns) Hasbro, Winning Moves and
Disney Resorts (potential venue). We have a conference call at the end of
March to decide a date and confirm a venue. Everyone will be informed as and
when. 
We could do with a &quot;host&quot; for the event (like Dan in Toronto) as I don&#x27;t
want it to be &quot;corporate&quot;: I think this detracts from the fact that you all
make it happen. Any volunteers - particularly local to Orlando area ? - it
means you can&#x27;t compete though. If not we will get a &quot;master of ceremonies&quot;
(no not Mickey!)

Suspect we will try to introduce some kind of self-regulated qualifying time
but we can discuss this via the forums nearer the time, obviously
speedcubers out of the time would be more than welcome and hopefully some
people would volunteer for scrambling and judging.
Will keep you posted.

I am meeting Ron and Ton in Amsterdam this week, we will firm up the Euro
plans for this summer.

Dave

          <div class="email-content">What are people&#x27;s thoughts on having &quot;divisions&quot; for a competition?  Something like an 
open division (everyone), and then people who&#x27;s fastest average is slower than 1 minute, 
etc.  Of course, this would be done by honor.  I mean... if you end up winning the &quot;slower 
than 1 minute&quot; division with a final round average of 30 seconds, people will start to 
wonder.

As for the US Championships, I&#x27;m going to talk the schedule over with a few people who 
are helping me run the summer tournament on July 10.  Hopefully I should have a concrete 
schedule soon.  Finals around the corner... life becomes brutal.

          <div class="email-content">I read a part of one of those docs on the BF forum yesterday. <br>
amazing...<br>
but those formulas are way too many for one to memorize... I guess.<br>
I am doing a mix of olly&#x27;s method (but I know Carr&#x27;s too), PLL and 2 <br>
or 3 extra algs, orint/permut corner/edges separatly and I wanna get <br>
sub 5min.<br>
I am mainly interested in easy to memorize formulas that can be <br>
adapted to many situations (who isn&#x27;t ;). for a example a [w x y z]*2 <br>
(wxyz being moves) that will permute some edges. also, and specially, <br>
tips and tricks that come from experience.<br>
2 algs I can think of right now are 3 top layer CO, 1top+1down layer <br>
CO, but I have thought of more during solves. I&#x27;ll ask more as I <br>
remember ;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Sounds awesome Chris. Im dying to compete in a competition and meet 
some people. I can&#x27;t make the one in Cali because I&#x27;ll be on 
vacation and it is kinda far. A joint tournament is a great idea. 
You don&#x27;t get to meet as many people but it&#x27;s still good. I would 
definately go to an Eastern US tourny. I don&#x27;t know what exactly I 
could do but I would be happy to help. I would prefer it before the 
world champs so that wont be my first competition but im flexible.

I think there should be a website that has all the main methods in <br>

No, that is not part of those. Those other documents haven&#x27;t been 
made public. That is just a method that is slightly beyond the basic 
method - as for too many algorithms, what is posted there isn&#x27;t 
hugely beyond, say, Jessica&#x27;s method. What is posted on the other 
group is not even 0.1% the number of algorithms currently in BCFSSS.

When you say &#x27;layer by layer&#x27;. Do you mean you complete the first 
layer, then the middle layer, then the last layer? If so, I&#x27;m 
impressed that you can achieve such fast times. I could never solve 
the cube anywhere near that fast when I used to use a layer-by-layer-
by-layer method (I still don&#x27;t solve it that fast even with my 
current method).

I&#x27;m curious, how many moves do you average per solve?

Jasmine.

his name... maybe Macky can help me out here.  What was it... he does like 4 to 5 moves a

Furthermore, as for this new cubing website... I think the main thing is to come up with 
something different and original.  I mean... there are already so many websites out there 
and nothing that anyone has mentioned hasn&#x27;t already been done... (I may be wrong on

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jasmine :-)

I have never actually done any counting when solving fast with my 
common layer-by-layer method. But i would guess it&#x27;s somewhere 
between 8 and 90. Many of my algs are really fast though, esp edge 3-
cycles. A 10 move 3-cycle on edges can be done in 2 secs, or maybe 
even less. 28 secs is my best average, usually it&#x27;s around 32-33 
secs. 

For solviing in number of moves i follow a completely different 
method. Then i put up a cross on first layer, solve middle edges 
while trying to &quot;grab for free some corners and also hopefully solve 
one edge on last layer, then finally solve remaining corners with 
some 3-cycles. It&#x27;s roughly the same method for supercubing but 
there i also have to think of orienting the facecenters correctly 
while putting up the first cross, and also put that first edge on 
final layer correctly.

I wonder which changes and improvements you (bilndfolders) have done

          <div class="email-content">Hi Fox,

   I separate the basic notation from finger-trick notation. This is
because the basic notation is the primary notation and the finger
tricks notation is a secondary notation.

***

   Basic notation:

There are the six sides:

R = Right layer clockwise
U = Top layer clockwise
L = Left layer clockwise
D = Lowest layer clockwise
F = Front layer clockwise
B = Back layer clockwise

Then there are the middle layers or  slices:

r = center slice next to R rotated clockwise relative to R
u = center slice under U rotated clockwise relative to U
b = center slice in front of B rotated clockwise relative to B

this is sufficient for the 3x3x3, but I wish to include left handers
and the 4x4x4, so, also:

l = center slice next to L rotated clockwise relative to L
d = center slice above D rotated clockwise relative to D
f = center slice behind F rotated clockwise relative to F

There are the three basic turns. For example:
R = Right layer clockwise
R2 = Right layer 180 degrees
R&#x27; = Right layer counterclockwise

   Finger Tricks: for rotating the whole cube in your hand I propose Q
 which stands for cube. Parentheses are for separating hand positions.

QR = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the right
QU = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the top
QB = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the back

Of course QL QD and QF may be used.

*****

   I find that it&#x27;s a lot easier to remember the small case letters
than various xyz MES notations, which many people tell me are confusing.

   When two layers are &quot;moved together&quot; that&#x27;s only relative to your
hand position and not the cube. For example R2 r2 can be performed as
one move, but it is really L2 with the cube rotated QR2 for finger
tricks. Again, I think that the basic notation is primary and the
finger tricks notation is secondary.

   I&#x27;d like to see this notation accepted as the standard and end the
confusion.

Regards,

David J

It should be fast, for those who can master it fully. I&#x27;d say that a 
master of the method should be able to beat me if I am sighted and 
they are not.

>fewest moves? 

It&#x27;s pretty efficient. You only need to work out 3 or 4 numbers (4 
at the moment, maybe 3 later) and then just go on autopilot.

>easier 
> solving? 

Yes, that&#x27;s true. Since it will be fully automated it will be unlike 
other systems (where thought may be required to solve the cross or 
2x2x2 block for instance).

>how many algs do you know/intend to know by heart?

If I told you that I&#x27;d give you a measure of whether I am seriously 
sad. (Of course, if I don&#x27;t use it but still write it all up, then 
arguably I could be said to be even more seriously sad.)

You could. I probably won&#x27;t answer there (not that my input is 
necessary) as that group doesn&#x27;t have public archives like this one.
Indeed, I only rejoined today to find out how much of my method has 
been posted on it (as the methods aren&#x27;t supposed to be public at 
this time) but I found it was a fairly primitive version from some 
time ago.

I&#x27;ve made some improvements to Carr&#x27;s method. I had originally 
thought about an Olly type method but abandoned it in favour of the 
other one.

Don&#x27;t do that - there&#x27;s so much useful stuff you could do instead!

Q could also be quarter. Do you use QU2 or HU or Q2U or (QU)2 for a 
half turn?
Also QR is two letters.
You could use the following letter e.g. C,E,G,M,S,V (for 
B,D,F,L,R,U) but of course that could confuse with M,E,S that are 
currently in use and does add a lot more letters to abbreviate.
Maybe some sort of accent could be used.

More amusingly perhaps, you could just give the a code based on move 
length and then lexicographic order for the move in question. Thus 
you&#x27;d have some ordering of the 6 basic quarter moves. So as not to 
prefer my native language, I&#x27;ll use U,D,F,B,R,L as the numbers 1-6 
(or 0-5 if you want to start there). Then UU would be 7 (or 6), UD 
would be 8 and so forth. DU would be 13 and it is equivalent to UD. 
To this end, one could sieve out equivalent moves or insist on only 
using reduced words (although that would make conversion between 
number and move more difficult). U&#x27; i.e. UUU would then be number 43 
(42).
More generally, this could be extended to other sets of generators. 
(Thus one would just need the number and the ordered set of 
generators to get the algorithm.)

It&#x27;s fairly unwieldy though, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.

You wouldn&#x27;t like the length-lexicographic method to be standard? (I 
guess I quasi-recommended it after all.)

What do you mean by midpiece? If it&#x27;s what it sounds like then you 
won&#x27;t be able to solve it without dismantling the thing as total edge 
flips is invariant mod 2 and 0 doesn&#x27;t equal 1.

He is probably solving it to the point of being able to solve it like a 
3x3x3, in which case he probably just hit the parity error.  It is 
impossible for one edge to be flipped around if you havent dismantled 
the cube and you bought it brand new (solved).  I am thinking that the 
center edge piece is fine, it is the two edges adjacent to it that are 
flipped.  I use (Rr U2) x 5 to put it in a solveable state... not sure 
where I got that alg but I dont think I made it up :)

   I use QU2. Some people intuit that right away.

   It should be three letters?

   I was hoping that the lower case (r u b l d and f) be reserved for
the main notation and not be used for finger tricks. And single
letters for moving one layer.

   I don&#x27;t consider the finger trick notation to be set in stone. If
you want to label a one layer move as a two layer move for ease of
handling then you could use two letters.

   Logically then you could use three letters for rotating the whole
cube, but this is not the main notation, because this movement of the
cube is only in relation to you hands; in relation to the cube itself
nothing moved.

   People tell me that they like Q because it&#x27;s easy to remember - Q
for &quot;cube.&quot;

   You could use the numbers 1 through 18 for the basic notation and
make it even harder. Or give each side a line position, and use the I
Ching - with the broken lines meaning no movement, a changing broken
line to mean a clockwise turn, the solid lines being a 180 degree
movements, and a changing solid line to mean a counterclockwise move.

    Or, say, consult the I Ching 35 times.

   Well I suppose this is something one would expect from someone who
goes by the name of a Bruce Lee movie. :)

   Rest easy Kyle, you&#x27;re not terrible stupid. Just some theater of

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

The point of writing (Dd) or (Rr) or (U&#x27;u&#x27;) is to make it clear that 
those 2 moves within the brackets can be moved simultaneously in 
space. (Dd) on a 4x4x4 cube is just like D on a 2x2x2 cube if u 
like ... and so on :-) 

In some cases, on 4x4x4 and larger cubes, algs using inner layer 
slides can be rewritten adding to move the outer layer along with the 
inner one. Ie if r is a prepositioning step for a face-center 3-
cycle, then the prepositioning step can be turned into (Rr) which is 
done faster than just r on most cubes.

<br>
Hi.  I posted something on this a while ago, maybe you will find it <br>
useful so I will just paste it in again.  At the time it took me <br>
about 6 seconds to do the cross.  I can do it a lot faster now.  The <br>
only thing I would add to what is below is that doing it in the <br>
minimum number of moves is secondary to doing it using finger tricks.<br>
<br>
S.<br>
<br>
This is what I posted:<br>
<br>
As part of her sub-20 solution, Jessica allows 2 seconds to form a <br>
cross before going on to the next step.  I find this is quite a <br>
challenge, partly because it requires a certain awareness of all 6 <br>
faces of the cube at once, but mostly because 2 seconds goes by <br>
pretty fast.<br>
<br>
Lars V. posted an email about the cross a few weeks ago with some <br>
statistics that I found really useful.  He worked out that, from a <br>
scrambled cube, percentages for forming a cross on a pre-selected <br>
face are: <br>
4 moves or less: 0.059% <br>
5 moves or less: 30.38% <br>
6 moves or less: 81.55% <br>
7 moves or less: 99.94% <br>
8 moves or less: 100% <br>
<br>
The general principle is pretty obvious: you should expect to form a <br>
cross in 6 moves; sometimes it will take one move less and, a bit <br>
less often, one move more.<br>
<br>
Now, moves for forming the cross are of two types: <br>
(1) a move that actually puts an edge onto the correct face in the <br>
correct spot, and (2) a preparation move that makes it possible to do <br>
move (1).  Bearing in mind those minimum number of moves, forming a <br>
cross will normally require four (sometimes three) of those type (1) <br>
moves, which leaves you with about only three moves of type (2).<br>
<br>
There seem to be two tricky things about all of this:<br>
Firstly, if you want to get the minimum number of moves you often <br>
need to combine things, so that a type (1) move for one edge is, at <br>
the same time, a type (2) move for another edge.   Doing this takes a <br>
bit of lateral thinking, well, it does for me :-)<br>
<br>
Also, to do 6/7 moves in 2 seconds means using finger tricks, just <br>
the same as the algs that are needed for the rest of the solution.  I <br>
can practice the algs for the later stages because they are the same <br>
each time, but the 6/7 move sequence for the cross is always slightly <br>
different, and to exploit really fast finger tricks might mean having <br>
to move the cube around in my hands, which makes planning the ideal <br>
sequence in my head in 15 seconds pretty difficult.  The thing is at <br>
the moment, even if I give myself an unlimited inspection time, so I <br>
have a sequence in my head all worked out, it usually takes me longer <br>
than 2 seconds to execute it.<br>
<br>
So ... I find it hard!  At present it usually takes me 6 or 7 seconds <br>
to do the cross.<br>
<br>
These are my suggestions / ideas for getting the average time down to <br>
2 seconds, sort of ordered from &quot;beginner&quot; to &quot;advanced&quot;; some I&#x27;ve <br>
done, and others I&#x27;m working on<br>
*  don&#x27;t align the cross with the correct centre colours until all <br>
four edges are in place<br>
*  avoid forming a cross in more than 8 (but practically speaking, 7) <br>
moves<br>
*  practise doing the cross &quot;blindfolded&quot; after a 15-second <br>
inspection time.  (At the moment the full 15 seconds are essential <br>
for me, but I have read that in this time the pros can also plan <br>
subsequent moves, but that&#x27;s way down the road for me, if ever!)<br>
* continue extending your repertoire of finger tricks so that you <br>
don&#x27;t need to move the cube around so much (a tip that applies to all <br>
the steps of any solution, really)<br>
* I suppose if you were able to start from any face it would be <br>
possible to choose a starting colour that was good for doing the <br>
cross quickly, but I always start with white, because if I don&#x27;t <br>
everything else takes that much longer to do<br>
* ?? other tips would be great!<br>
<br>
I have sometimes wondered if starting with a cross is just not for <br>
me, and have experimented with starting with three edges instead of <br>
four, then doing the corners/edges for those, ending with a 2x2x3 <br>
block, then adding the fourth edge, and then filling in the last two <br>
corners/edges.  I tried this out (plus going from 2x2x2 to 2x2x3) for <br>
a while but it didn&#x27;t make much difference really, so for the moment <br>
I&#x27;m sticking with the cross.  I think part of the reason why I am is <br>
because I find that working out how to do the cross in your head, and <br>
then doing it as quickly as possible, is excellent fun.<br>

I think most beginners can gain some speed when they realise they <br>
don&#x27;t have to line up the edges right-away, but like you said, can <br>
align them as the last move of the cross. Although sometimes I find <br>
myself having two colors (ie. Red and Orange) inverted, just because <br>
I didn&#x27;t spend enough time during pre-inspection (if any).<br>

Hi Fox,

   I like the idea of having a program that will translate one
notation into another. Short of the adoption of a standard notation,
that could be very useful.

          <div class="email-content">I totally agree with David...<br>
<br>
While x, y, z makes sense to me, there are people who aren&#x27;t used <br>
thinking in 3D coordinates (or axes) and yet others who define their <br>
axes differently than what I&#x27;m used to (e.g. they say z is up, while <br>
I say y is up). QR, QL, etc. is probably the best thing to have as a <br>
standard for the notation of rotations in cubing.<br>
<br>
I am among those that have found S/E/M to be confusing... I don&#x27;t get <br>
what they are supposed to stand for (though I&#x27;ve been told and <br>
remember thinking at the time that it wasn&#x27;t intuitive) and have <br>
found no way to remember which is which, nor which way they go. In <br>
general I prefer the upper case for face and lower case for slice <br>
notation; this way slices&#x27; names are obvious and it makes sense, not <br>
only for 3x3x3 cubes, but also for 4x4x4 cubes.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I&#x27;m still at a loss for what to call the middle slices <br>
on a 5x5x5 and larger cubes. If we could use subscripts, we could <br>
call the three slices between L and R r1, r2, and r3 (written with <br>
subscripted numbers) - but that cannot be typed.  Perhaps we could <br>
use r[1] (slice next to R), r[2] (slice next to r[1]), etc.. However, <br>
this might get a little confusing - would things like r[1]&#x27; and r[3]2 <br>
make sense?  Any thoughts?<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; When two layers are &quot;moved together&quot; that&#x27;s only relative to your<br>
&gt; hand position and not the cube. For example R2 r2 can be performed<br>
&gt; as one move, but it is really L2 with the cube rotated QR2 for<br>
&gt; finger tricks. Again, I think that the basic notation is primary<br>
&gt; and the finger tricks notation is secondary.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I would recommend trying to do the cross as slowly as you can, even 
on a timed speedsolve.  By slowly, I mean no finger tricks and don&#x27;t 
try to go break-neck speed to complete the cross in 2 seconds.  
Recently I&#x27;ve started getting my best times when I solve the cross 
slowly (2 moves/sec or less) but try as hard as I can to look ahead, 
so that at the end of the first 6 or 7 moves to complete the cross I 
have already found the first corner-edge pair and can go right into 
the moves to solve it.  When you do this right you should perform 
the first 12-14 moves (cross + first corner edge pair) seamlessly 
while SLOWLY speeding up.  I&#x27;ve seen Katsuyuki Konishi and Ron van 
Bruchem (both sub-16 on average btw) recommend slowly accelerating 
your faces turned per second ratio, and I really believe that it 
works.

With practice you can solve the whole F2L with no delays, while 
slowly speeding up your pace the whole time.  In my opinion, this 
will be much faster on average than trying to always do the cross in 
2 seconds, but risk having a delay afterward so you can find the 
first C/E pair.  Remember, a delay during the F2L is much worse than 
taking longer than 2 seconds to do the cross.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I had an interesting dream last night.<br>
Basically, a huge glass cube was suspended in space<br>
with a standard 3x3 in the center of it held there by<br>
6 iron rods connected to the cube&#x27;s center cubies.<br>
Each of these iron rods were connected to handles<br>
outside of the larger glass cube and each handle was<br>
manned by one nondescript male figure. It all seemed<br>
so systematic. The 6 worked together and just kept<br>
solving and rescrambling the cube over and over<br>
again...<br>
then I woke up... <br>

          <div class="email-content">The first Rubik&#x27;s Cube site that I ever saw was Lars&#x27;s.  I really
liked the java cubes at the time, but the only problem I found with it
was that I couldn&#x27;t print out the java cubes. I ended up making my own
notation. 
I remembered seeing somewhere that &#x27; meant counterclockwise,  so I
used &quot; to mean 180. Using a quote instead of numbers for higer order
cubes might make numbering the inner slices easier.

Also If I remember right (someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong)
S = Slice
M = Middle
E = Equator
I can always remember E, but Slice and Middle don&#x27;t differentiate from
each other very well. And also,  why the heck do these slices move
like B, D and L  rather than U, R and F?  Don&#x27;t most (ie Right handed)
cubers hold the cube to see those 3 sides?

I think the use of lowercase letters to denote slices is a good idea.
However if we do that, then what can we use for double slice finger
tricks?
Or would it be easier just to use 2 &quot;letters&quot; to say that?

          <div class="email-content">Man oh man...  Thats pretty sweet, I&#x27;ve had several weird cube dreams 
before.  Its so weird coming up with algs and stuff in your sleep.  
The method i dreamt of is kind of like the thistle waite, and kind of 
like the square one.  here is the gist of it:

Solve middle layer
solve corners
place bottom edges
solve final edges

I havent been working on it much lately.  It is kinda weird and i 
doubt it will amount to much of a speed method.  It could, but it is 
a lot of stuff to keep straight.  You also run into some weird corner 
cases, but it is all good!  Give it a whirl, I can try and throw some 
of the algs i generated up here if anybody really wants them.

Keep dreaming them cubes

          <div class="email-content">I learned using M,E and S and also xyz for rotations. I might be 
wrong but I always thought S=side which makes it easier to remember. 
It&#x27;s not difficult to remember. Come on, for people that memorize 
hundreds of algorithms, six more letters can&#x27;t be that hard. 
Although, now I am beginning to lean towards using lower case 
letters for slices and Q for rotations. It does seem easier.
hmm, I just contradicted myself. I don&#x27;t know what notation I like 
better. Maybe there is some way to combine the 2 like using M for a 
true slice and r&#x27; for what would be performed like (R&#x27;r&#x27;)R. Anyway, 
Im just rambling now.

Hey , I was just thinking about the PSAT (standardized test) and had a 
strange idea concerning speedcubing tournaments.  The April tournament 
is in CA, no doubt inconvenient for very many people, especially people 
either living outside of the US or us younger folk who can&#x27;t make our 
way to Cali for different reasons.  But how about having one large 
tournament with different places to compete? i.e. we figure out and 
distribute the scrambling algs beforehand, to, maybe, 4 or 5 tournament 
sites around the globe, all handled just like independant tournaments 
using the same equipment and such, and then at the end of the day we put 
together all of the results and come up with the final records?  Might 
not work, but if it does, then we would probably get a LOT more people 
to compete.  I could justify going to Austin, TX or New Orleans, LA 
(both places I am thinking about going to college... wink wink) a 
helluva lot more than I cal justify going to California.

sites around the globe, all handled just like independant tournaments 
using the same equipment and such, and then at the end of the day we put

not work, but if it does, then we would probably get a LOT more people 
to compete.  I could justify going to Austin, TX or New Orleans, LA 
(both places I am thinking about going to college... wink wink) a 
helluva lot more than I cal justify going to California.

There was a fellow on _Comedy Central Presents_ or similar (comic 
remix, etc) a while back who had a song about rubik&#x27;s cubes... been 
looking for it all over, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it.

Song went something like:

Hello operator, please get me hung-ar-y
Got to talk to Erno Rubik &#x27;bout this problem you see...

Chorus:
Rubik&#x27;s Cube,
It&#x27;s drivin&#x27; me crazy
Gonna peal the stickers off
&#x27;cause I&#x27;m too stupid and lazy

That&#x27;s all I can remember of it though.

Daniel

          <div class="email-content">Hey, It&#x27;s late (or early as you look at it) and I&#x27;m trying to <br>
understand how Cube Explorer works.<br>
Fun stuff.<br>
<br>
However, I did find an interesting little &quot;bug&quot; in the program (I&#x27;m <br>
sure most if not all of you have this program, and if not just <br>
google &quot;Cube Explorer&quot; and download it. It is worth the time to set <br>
up)<br>
<br>
If you take a state and do an optimal solve on it, it does just that.<br>
Then, if you click the little green arrow again, a box pops up <br>
telling you something about losing optimality. Click OK and on each <br>
subsiquent time you click the green arrow, the program will spit out <br>
a unique solution to the state you entered. Pretty nifty for those <br>
of you looking to optimize some algorithms to your hands or to QTM.<br>

Can&#x27;t remember if I replied to this yet or not.  I&#x27;m in Central

our family&#x27;s travel budget my wife will let me devote to cube

Well, it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to say that it&#x27;s a Bruce Lee movie. 
He&#x27;s only in it in archive footage and his character dies fairly 
early on anyway. (It was made a long time after he died.)

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

OK, i&#x27;ll try to explain.

Let&#x27;s compare the 3x3x3 cube and the 4x4x4 (revenge) cube. First lets 
assume that on the 3x3x3 cube we count middle slice moves as 2 outer 
slice moves. This is just to make the discussion easier :-) On the 
3x3x3 cube there are 18 possibilities for the first move. We have 6  
faces which can be rotated one of 3 possible ways: clockwise, 2 steps 
or anticlockwise. For the 4x4x4 cube this doubles to 36 possiblities. 
There are 12 slices on that cube, with 3 possible rotations each. If 
one extends this way of argumentation for sequences of moves we find 
that we will get exponential growth (power of 2) of the possible 
number of algs for any given length on the 4x4x4 cube compared with 
the standard 3x3x3 cube. Well this power-of-2 wrt 3x3x3 cube is an 
upper bound. There are some reductions we dun need to consider to 
prove the point. Any &quot;interesting&quot; algorithm on a cube is at least 
something like 10 moves long. Now we have 2^10=1024. So in order to 
find a 10 move sequence on a 4x4x4 we could expect to have to wait 
1024 times longer than finding a 10-move algorithm on a 3x3x3 cube. 
Roughly!! Finding a 20 move alg would take something like a million 
times longer :-o If it takes about 5 minutes to find one on the 3x3x3 
cube it might take 5 000 000 minutes on the 4x4x4 cube. And i haven&#x27;t 
even mentioned how much memory would be needed for fast searching on 
the 4x4x4 cube ;-) The huge optimal solver in the Cube Explorer needs 
about 1 GB of free RAM in order to run :D And personally i haven&#x27;t 
been able to run it myself :-( Hmm, no paragraphs. Then again, Thomas 
Bernhard writes complete novels without paragraphs ... hehe :-P

          <div class="email-content">I myself have often thought about that.  Currently i am doing a 
science project and am making a cube solver.  This got me thinking 
down two paths. one, what if you could fit a microprocessor and 
stepper motors inside the cube (it might have to be a bit bigger). 
it could then keep track of its state, and at any given time, with 
some command of some sort, start hopping around on the table, 
solving itself (cool!).  another one, what about a cube that has, 
instead of stickers, some sort of led or lcd on each cubie that can 
change between the six colors.  there are a few advantages to this. 
with the light, you can solve in the dark.  and i dont know about 
what other people think, but i know i hate scrambling my cube in 
between solves, with this, you could issue a command, and the leds 
would turn on in a scrambled (yet solvable) state. once again a 
small microprosecor would be needed (you can pick them up for 2 
bucks now) and most likely the axels within the cube would have 
leads kinda like how you plug in a battery, to keep the leds lit.  

i am actualy probably gonna follow through with the second idea.  i 
dont know how well, if, it will work.  and chances are it wont be 
too good for speed cubing, but it will be fun

let me know what you think

          <div class="email-content">I never thought about the LED idea and it is quite good. The cube 
doesn&#x27;t even need to be able to move. IT could be solid and a 
controler could have L R U etc. and when a button is pressed, the 
lights would change as if that move was made. I also like the idea 
of a self solving cube with servos. I might try making this if I 
have the time. 

Another related idea I had was to use a blank cube itself as a 
controller. IT would have some internal sensors that tranmit to a 
computer. This could be used o solve a computer cube and would make 
an awesome and unique game controller. In addition to the 6 faces 
and slices, different triggers could be programmed to do certain 
things. It would be pretty cool.

It could also be external, say two connectors on a center cap. You&#x27;d 
need a little piece of metal to connect them and tell the cube to 
scramble. Unless you wear a ring and hold your cube in a strange way 
it should be hard to accidentally do it ;-)

Hmm, or you could also build a mechanism that detects when the cube 
is rotated around itself several times without being touched. That 
way you&#x27;d just need to throw it in the air and it comes back down 
scrambled. I prefer this solution.

          <div class="email-content">Another idea i just had, which im pretty sure is gonna be my science 
project next year.

in adition to the leds or lcds on the facelets, have a small 8 pin 
microprocessor inside each piece (cheap, tiny) and have a small coil 
on every edge of the peice that is adjacent to another piece or 
actualy facelet. so for instance, each center piece would have four 
coils, each edge piece would have 6 coils, and each corner would 
have 6 coils.  as some of you nerds (yay nerds) may know, running a 
curent through one coil, will create a current in an adjacent coil.  
through this method, the pieces could &quot;talk&quot; to eachother, and form 
a small network.  in doing this, the cube can still be lubed like 
normal, and there would be no contacts to worry about.  also, a 
small keychain, or docking station or something, could be created, 
wich when held up to a corner or center or something, lined up with 
the coils, and a button is pressed, it would scramble the cube
by turning on the faces in a scrambled yet solvable state.  another 
cool thing, the price of the supplies is relatively cheap compared 
to what you might expect.   a 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch by 1.some odd mm 
8 pin micro processor with 32 registers and i forget how much 
memory, is only 2 bucks.  i think the hardest part would be finding 
exactly how to light up the face.  but i&#x27;ll figure it out, i have a 
year until the next science fair.  and one more thing, just popped 
into my head, these would make for great prizes at the championships 
or any competition

In case your confidence is restored, remember that you really need to 
search for supercube algorithms in many cases as otherwise algorithms 
that appear to do something may do something else in other situations!

          <div class="email-content">   Nice idea Evan.

   You could put a little generator in the middle of the spindle which
would generate electricty when you turn the sides. The faster you
solved the brighter the cube would glow!

   Through one center cubie you could put current in and use the
generator as a motor to power random turns for scrambling, so the
scrambling instructions could come from the unit which supplies the power.

          <div class="email-content">During the last two days, I had the opportunity to be a <br>
company&#x27;s &quot;cube solver&quot; for a conference - I sat at their booth and <br>
solved their custom picture cube.  These cubes had 2 sides with just <br>
text on them and four sides with pictures (each having a different <br>
base color). While doing this, I realized that not all supercubes are <br>
created equal...<br>
<br>
When I say this, I&#x27;m not talking about cube quality, but rather the <br>
designs used on each face to make these supercubes.  It makes a big <br>
difference in solving difficulty when you compare a cube with solid <br>
colors on all sides (direction defined with arrows on each sticker, <br>
or shaped stickers) against a cube with pictures on each side with <br>
distinct base colors (e.g. a &quot;green&quot; side which is a grassy field or <br>
a &quot;blue&quot; side that is a picture of waves of water) or against a cube <br>
with pictures with non-distinct base colors (or no base colors).<br>
<br>
Recognition is much more difficult with pictures than with solid <br>
colors, especially if the pictures don&#x27;t have an apparent base color <br>
(e.g. a picture of a wide variety of flowers), and/or the different <br>
sides of the cube don&#x27;t have different base colors (different water <br>
pictures on different sides). Also, I would think it could make a big <br>
difference if you do or don&#x27;t have a definite &quot;up&quot; side - a side <br>
toward which the four sides around it point. For example, the cubes I <br>
was solving had the &quot;up&quot; side of the four picture sides facing toward <br>
the same text face, which made things a little easier than it <br>
otherwise could&#x27;ve been.<br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, for people who have been super-speed cubing, or <br>
perhaps more accurately speed supercubing, how do your times compare <br>
to speedcubing (non-supercubing), and what type of supercube are you <br>
using (pictures, shaped stickers, etc.).  With the custom cube I&#x27;ve <br>
mentioned, I was solving around 50-55 seconds, though it&#x27;s still <br>
fairly far from well broken in.  With a speedcubing average in the 25-<br>
30 range, I&#x27;m about half as fast with this supercube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree, I think there is a big difference between the times you&#x27;ll 
get on a supercube depending on how your centers are designed and 
oriented when solved.

My first supercube (3x3x3) was a custom made sticker design with two 
colors on every face (The cube essentially looks like 4 tetrahedrons 
smashed together to form a cube).  There is no definite &quot;up&quot; side, 
rather two adjacent sides have the slant of the diagonal going the 
opposite direction.  Even though I broke the cube itself in to be a 
good speedcube, my fastest average was just under a minute with that 
cube.  My current speed-supercube is a normal cube but with arrows 
on each face based on my normal orientation (yellow always on top 
throughout the whole solve).  All the side face center arrows point 
to yellow when solved, and the yellow and white (top and bottom) 
centers always point towards blue when the cube is solved 
completely.  This gives a definite &quot;up&quot; face and helps for 
recognizing the orientation of the middle face centers.  My fastest 
average with this cube is literally twice as fast as my first 
supercube, so yes I agree, not all supercubes are created equal.

A really good exercise to see this is to scramble a 4x4x4 cube like 
a 2x2x2, then scramble again like a 3x3x3.  When solving, solve the 
cube like a 3x3x3 back into a 2x2x2, then solve like a 2x2x2.  This 
effectively creates a supercube you are not used to with many 
possible different center designs and orientations (there could or 
could not be two sides with the exact same center design, there 
could or could not be an &quot;up&quot; side, etc.)  It is actually quite a 
lot of work to solve a supercube if you don&#x27;t know how it looks when 
solved, and this is a really good way to see that using a 4x4x4 cube.

Also, I think Stefan&#x27;s supercube design for the larger cubes is 
really cool looking, but I wonder if it would hard to solve a design 
like that for speed?  Stefan do you think it slows you down any?  I 
like my larger cube supercube designs of having numbers on each face 
(increasing from left to right and top to bottom) since you can 
quickly locate and place the pieces for each center group.  Also 
each numbered grid on my larger supercubes has the same orientation 
as my 3x3x3 supercube, so the white and yellow centers are oriented 
correctly when they point to blue, and the other centers are 
oriented correctly when they point to yellow (i.e. I don&#x27;t just 
group the numbers together on each face so it is a full supercube)

Grant, I definitely agree that having an easy to recognize center 
sticker setup is key to getting fast times on a supercube.  I wonder 
if there is a &quot;best&quot; way to do it?  I agree that having an &quot;up&quot; face 
helps a lot.  Also having the other two oriented the same way seems 
to help in my opinion.  Having the centers oriented together in 
pairs seems to work alright too, but maybe it is not as fast?  What 
do you think?  Would there even be a best center setup?  The designs 
should all have 4 easily recognizable orientations (the one center 
you talked about with the array of flowers sounds like it would take 
a while to figure out its orientation).  I wonder if there even is 
a &quot;best&quot; way?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris, Grant,

   On the 4x4x4 have you tried solving it the centers first?

   If you put the orientation arrows on a 4x4x4 - the solve the
centers first it seems a whole lot easier.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Grant,

   You could put a small square of colored tape on one side of each of
the center cubies to signify a direction, much like the arrows that
Chris mentions.

   When I first solved the 4x4x4 I used a center-first strategy, then
a center-last strategy.

   I don&#x27;t know if anyone is interested, but I now do:
1 Eight corners
2 all four middle level edge pairs
3 two opposing centers
4 two FL edge pairs
5 the four remaining centers
6 two TL edge pairs
7 pair up the remaining edges
8 place the four remaing edge pairs

   This is built around freedom of movement. I have not tried for
speed because my 4x4x4 is in now way quick enough.

   I tried Chris&#x27; idea about parity being a matter of a half turn, and
it worked perfectly.

   Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">I really don&#x27;t see what the confusion is all about.

I&#x27;m going to go through things step by step, and I think this 
notation is very easy to understand. As someone said, for people who 
remember hundreds and hundreds of move sequences, a few more rules 
won&#x27;t hurt.

U, D, R, L, B, F - are just about the only tokens that people who 
speak English as their first language, (and most of those who don&#x27;t) 
agree on. I might want to suggest that you use T for Top instead of U 
for Up, but I don&#x27;t, and why not? Because it would be like I am just 
trying to create an argument situation, everybody understands U for 
Up, even though T for Top would be just as valid.

&#x27; is a nice symbol for anti-clockwise, it looks neat, and easily 
differentiates an R from an R&#x27;. Continuing, 2 is the best symbol for 
a half-turn, it means 2-quarter turns, and is easily differentiable 
from &#x27; - eg R R&#x27; and R2 are all very different symbols which can be 
recognised at a glance.

M, E, and S, whilst maybe not the best choice, are simply 3 letters, 
which a lot of people use, and they have been ascribed meanings. Of 
course, they are not 3 random letters, they have been chosen to mean 
something (Middle, Equator, and Slice) and if you learn what these 
mean there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Also, learn the direction! (M is 
in the direction of L, E is in the direction of D, and S is in the 
direction of F) then M&#x27; will be the opposite direction and a 2 will 
be a half turn. Again, no problems!

Small case letters are also a good choice, and most people take them 
to mean a &quot;2-layer&quot; turn. So for example u means turn the Upper layer 
and the middle layer &quot;Equator&quot; below it together clockwise. This can 
easily be extended with the &#x27; and 2 symbols to cover all possible 2-
layer turns! Easy! m, e, and s would also denote double layer turns, 
or &quot;anti-slice&quot; movements. For example m would means turn L and R in 
the direction of L. Again, this can be extended with the &#x27; and 2 
notation.

Finally, the cube axes of rotation. x y and z are again the simplest 
and the neatest, just learn what they mean! Looking at the cube as if 
it were resting on its B face on a piece of graph paper, R and L 
faces on the Right and Left respectively, the x-axis goes from West 
to East, the y-axis goes from South to North, and the z-axis comes 
out of the plane of the paper. Once again, this notation can be 
extended with a &#x27; or 2 as necessary, and looks neat. To see which 
direction to rotate along these axes, you look athe x=R face, y=U 
face, and z=F face, and rotate the whole cube as if you were just 
rotating the particular face. Once you get the hang of it, it makes 
so much sense!

Additionally, to describe extra features within a solution or 
scramble, I suggest...

[comment] = square brackets to include comments.
()*n = round brackets to include moves to be repeated n times
{} = curl brackets to indicate slice turns written in the form {U&#x27; D}
if you are uncomfortable with M E and S
/ = to indicate the beginning or end of a step within a solution 
(could of course use comments for this as well) 

So, I hope you can see that this notation, whilst there are a few 
rules to learn, is easily accessible for anyone who intends to work 
hard at the cube. Finally, the only place where I think change from 
this scheme could be justified is in the directions of the M E and S 
turns, (perhaps M should be in the direction of R, and E in the 
direction of U?) so I&#x27;m not entirely stuck in the mud ;)

Good Luck!

That aint a bad idea, but still, there is already a fully functional 
almost universally known (in the cubing community) notation for turning 
the cube (x y z).  Why adopt another one?  If in fact a new one caught 
on (doubtfully) I think newer cube enthusiasts would be confused by 
inconsistant notation.  I know I would be.

          <div class="email-content">Well, like any good notation creator, I will translate common notation to my own, I think the average cube n00b is intimidated by all the letters, and I think an application of notation already known by n00bz with universal symbols would be easier than a short explanation of three dimensional space.
 
although I could be wrong, I think that it would be easier to use my notation as a stepping stone to just using x y and z.

Not so sure about that, people who have taken (ok, passed) Pre-Algebra 
in High School know what the X and Y axes are, so Z logically falls into 
place.

For me it is also easier to see how F2L algs work with the xyz notation 
(without performing them on my cube) because to me x/y/z and x&#x27;/y&#x27;/z&#x27; 
logically undo each other (again, in cube terms) the way that U and U&#x27; 
are opposites and F&#x27; and F are opposites.  When you get into z axis 
turns (by your notation U -> R) it might be a little harder to visualize 
or recognize two moves undoing each other while just looking at the 
algorithm, especially if you try to sort out that F->R and R->B are both 
undone by L->B and R->F.  I dont know, to me it just seems easier to see 
z undoes z&#x27; and y undoes y&#x27;.  Input from other people would help.

Sure, but that argument can be applied to any notation system, so it <br>

<br>
And it would be nice with a system that those who don&#x27;t remember <br>

Personally, I&#x27;ve never been very comfortable with written notation, <br>
and only recently learned it well enough to get through the FMC mixes <br>

<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s an other angle. It can be useful to take a step back and think <br>
about what the goals of a notation system should be. These are the <br>
ones I can come up with. I&#x27;m sure there are more good ones. My pet <br>
peeve is goal 1.<br>
<br>
0. It should be as simple as possible to learn and use, but no simpler.<br>
<br>
1. Notation of algorithms should be separable from notation of <br>
display or dexterity instructions. If F z R solves the cube, x&#x27; F y R <br>
better do as well, and the layer that starts with a red center should <br>
stay that way!<br>
<br>
2. It should be extendable to 4x4x4 and bigger cubes, so there is not <br>
a separate system for each size. I have no ideas to reach this, but <br>
it seems sound.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the system I use in my (still unreleased) applet at the <br>
moment. I don&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s better, just from a different perspective, <br>
and it serves my purposes well.<br>
<br>
U, D, R, L, B, F with &#x27; and 2, as usual. I don&#x27;t *like* it, since I <br>
would much prefer a one character code for each basic move, but I <br>
don&#x27;t think there is a good system for that.<br>
<br>
For 2 layer moves I use small case, but what you would call b&#x27; I call <br>
f&#x27;. It&#x27;s an F&#x27; move performed by keeping the F layer still and moving <br>
the rest. This is so that an upper and lower case move does the same <br>
thing to the cube, which serves goal 1. That way F L2 B&#x27; is the same <br>
algorithm as f L2 b&#x27;, only displayed or performed differently.<br>
<br>
I *could* learn to map x, y and z to the cube, but I prefer to use <br>
the six letters I already know. To turn the entire cube I use R&gt;, R| <br>
and R&lt;, which corresponds to R, R2 and R&#x27;. See it as a triple layer R <br>
move. R&gt; is the same as L&lt;.<br>
<br>
Whole cube moves do not rename the sides, as per goal 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t really use slice moves. I just hope that any specialized <br>
slice move notation is equivalent to R L&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t move centers <br>
around.<br>

   Though subtle, that was my point. In the notation I posted, the
cube rotations QR QU QB are all parrallel to the side movements. The
x, y, and z axes are at right angles to the side movements and add a
step to the understanding.

> his explanation is correct. &lt;

   Not really. Dan&#x27;s description of the axes is incomplete in that he
never establishes North for the beginning reference. All the
orientation is given in terms of the axes, not the cube. The Back side
is down. Right and Left sides are right and left, but are they North
and South, or East and West? All I know from his description is that
they are not &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;. His &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; are Front and Back.

   I&#x27;ll say it again: his directions are confusing.

   I think that people who will find or write computer programs to
reduce the number of moves in their algoritms might also go for the
simplest notation. In everything else the simplest and shortest is
what is desired, why not the notation?

   I agree. As far as I know the notation I&#x27;m recommending is the
simplest.

   I agree.

   If you can move R and proceed without rotating the cube shouldn&#x27;t I
be able to move r and proceed without rotating the cube? Why cant the
layers stand as equals?

   My notation fits the 4x4x4

   I also think that the main reason for such notation is because it
isn&#x27;t reliant upon everyone having the same color scheme on their cubes.

   Here you are changing the side a center is on. It&#x27;s OK for you but
not for others who do slices?

   Second: this is what I&#x27;m arguing against. The small case letter
shuld be reserved for the main notation, not finger trick notation. f
b u d r and l in my notation are for slices.

   With a single letter I&#x27;m noting a single layer move. If you move
&quot;two layers as one&quot; for a finger trick, then use two letters like Rr.

   I use &quot;Q&quot; for cube hence QB QR2 QU&#x27; etc.

   As someone who uses lots of slice moves I feel left out by those
who use the small case letters r l f b u and d for two layers. Again
calling a one layer move two layes is for finger trick notation and
not the main notation.

   I don&#x27;t think this is fair. &quot;Specialized&quot; means ignoring all the
people who do corners first and other methods. You want the freedom to
move a side and a slice in which the center moves, please grant me the
same. 

   The main convention so far says that centers may move to another
side in finger tricks.  This is because if you move, say, R the other
two sides stay in place, and an U move doesn&#x27;t require a cube rotation
notation. If I do an r&#x27; slice move followed by the U move should I be
required to note a rotation of the cube?

&gt; I really don&#x27;t see what the confusion is all about.<br>
<br>
The confusion arises because different people understand things in <br>
different ways.  While there may be &quot;standards&quot;, some of these <br>
standards don&#x27;t make sense to everyone (myself included), and other <br>
ideas of how things should be done don&#x27;t make sense to others.<br>
<br>
&gt; I&#x27;m going to go through things step by step, and I think this <br>
&gt; notation is very easy to understand....<br>
<br>
Precisely my point - you find it easy to understand while others may <br>
not.  Unfortunately, there is likely no &quot;universally understandable&quot; <br>
notation, but if we are going to create any standard, we need to go <br>
with what makes the most sense to the most people, and, perhaps most <br>
importantly, what makes sense to those who are new to cubing and/or <br>
will join in the future.<br>
<br>
&gt; M, E, and S, whilst maybe not the best choice, are simply 3<br>
&gt; letters, which a lot of people use, and they have been ascribed<br>
&gt; meanings. Of course, they are not 3 random letters, they have been<br>
&gt; chosen to mean something (Middle, Equator, and Slice) and if you<br>
&gt; learn what these mean there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Also, learn the <br>
&gt; direction!<br>
<br>
What I don&#x27;t get is why anyone should have to &quot;learn&quot; what the slices <br>
are, much less which direction they move, when there are intuitively <br>
obvious names that can be used (r, u, f, etc.).  &quot;Middle&quot; and &quot;slice&quot; <br>
don&#x27;t distinguish, in my mind, which slices of the cube are being <br>
talked about.  I do know what they are, now, but don&#x27;t use them <br>
consistently because of the difficulty I have found in remembering <br>
them in the past.  The faces have been named as U, F, R, etc., and it <br>
follows logically that the slices behind them can be called u, f, r, <br>
etc..<br>
<br>
&gt; Small case letters are also a good choice, and most people take<br>
&gt; them to mean a &quot;2-layer&quot; turn.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure that this is true... I know that I prefer to use lower <br>
case letters to refer to slice moves (not slice and face).  Since <br>
there is not a defined standard for this, though, I know I have used <br>
it both ways in the past (specifying which I meant when I used them).<br>
<br>
&gt; Finally, the cube axes of rotation. x y and z are again the<br>
&gt; simplest and the neatest, just learn what they mean! ...<br>
<br>
Again, as I believe I indicated previously, people don&#x27;t all know x, <br>
y, and z to mean the same thing.  There are some people who would put <br>
them such that the x, y, and z axes come through the F, R, and U <br>
faces, respectively (instead of R, U, and F respectively as I would <br>
know them).  Still others would use a &quot;left handed&quot; system and put z <br>
going out the back face (leaving x out R and y out U). I think the <br>
first time I came across these orientations of the axes was actually <br>
in computer graphics - maybe they are not very common, but there are <br>
different interpretations of the axes and &quot;learning&quot; them seems <br>
unnecessary.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of using QR, QL, etc. notation - it is intuitive, and <br>
once someone knows what the 6 faces are, and the 18 available face <br>
turns, it doesn&#x27;t require any additional learning (aside from <br>
learning that Q stands for &quot;quebe&quot; (cube) rotation).<br>
<br>
... just my thoughts on the topic.  We can&#x27;t make the assumption that <br>
because it makes sense to us that it must make sense to everyone (or <br>
can be learned by everyone).  These ideas happen to be what makes <br>
most sense to me.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Also, there is a slight problem with where you view the cube from. 
In Pre-algebra, I always saw an XY plane as perpendicular to my line
of sight, so the Z axis comes straight out at me.  Some people tend to
hold the cube at about chest level and look down on it while others
hold it in front of their faces and look at the front. 

I believe the xyz notation is confusing,  but one of the stipulations
that Lars mentioned was that the notation should be simple.  Putting Q
in front of a move to indicate a cube rotation could lead to 3
character instructions (like QR2).  I know its not much of a deal, 
but could there be a way to make it 2 characters?
Adding a new notation (like > or &lt;) as Lars suggests is a good idea.
It&#x27;s easy to see that a > looks like an arrow pointing clockwise and &lt;
like an arrow pointing counterclockwise.  Perhaps an X (looks like >&lt;)
could be used to represent a 180 turn of the cube.

But c&#x27;mon, I&#x27;m writing to a group of people who consistantly solve
rubik&#x27;s cubes. We&#x27;ll figure something out...eventually

might be wrong here) and subscripts are easy enough to make on the internet.<br>

I think this would be awkward.  In a chatroom (or other place where <br>
subscripts arent easy to create) r2 and R2 would be two different <br>
things, right?  R2 would be the same old 180 degree R face turn, and r2 <br>
would be the second r slice.  But what if you want to turn the second r <br>
slice 180 degrees?  Obviously r22 wouldnt be confused when talking about <br>
a 4x4x4 or 5x5x5, but if you are solving a 55x55x55 (just saw the record <br>
on speedcubingdotcom) it starts getting kind of funky... Doesn&#x27;t mean we <br>
can&#x27;t come up with something to distinguish the slice from the turn, <br>
though.  How about a comma or a forward slash?  r2/2 could mean a 180 <br>
degree turn of the second r slice.  Anyway, all I am saying is that we <br>
need a way to tell the numbers apart if this standard is ever adopted.<br>

Another thing regarding M/E/S (something that came up in my conversation <br>
with Kyle yesterday ;) ) that helped me out a lot...  Even if you dont <br>
know what M, E, and S are, you can easily figure them out when you are <br>
learning algs.  For instance, taken from &quot;Peter&#x27;s Magical Finger Tricks&quot; <br>
: Lï¿½(ED)(R&#x27;L)Fï¿½(RL&#x27;)(ED)Rï¿½.  When I saw that alg the first time, the use <br>
of perenthasis made everything clear.  I only knew the basic FRULDB <br>
notation, but the parenthasis helped a lot.  Could it be that we dont <br>
need an entire new branch in the notation, but all we need is a cleaner <br>
way of writing down things via the same notation?  I don&#x27;t know if other <br>
people feel the same, but to me, when I saw (ED) and didnt know what the <br>
&#x27;E&#x27; was,  I figured it was a slice move of some sort, and it was grouped <br>
with D, so there werent a whole lot of different uses for &#x27;E&#x27; that I <br>
could see.  Sure he could have written something like (DF) or (RE) which <br>
have no correlation whatsoever, but everyone knows that cube enthusiasts <br>
are way too nice to do stuff like that :)<br>

Apparently the Pre-Algebra comment I made was taken the wrong way by a <br>
few of our brethren, so I apologize.  I really didnt mean anything by it <br>
guys, honest :)<br>
<br>
In fact I remember playing around with a 3d modeling app a while back <br>
that used X as the horizontal axis, Z and the vertical axis, and Y as <br>
the... umm... well, other axis.  So sorry about that,  I type faster <br>
than I think... I think.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey again :-)

Just checking with my own 4x4x4 rubiks.com cube. U can do like u do 
on a normal 3x3x3 cube. Turn the layer with the missing edge 
something like 35-40 degrees. Then insert the loose edge, aligning 
the upper/back edge of the edge with the adjacent facecenter of the 
turned layer. Then u should be able to push the edge in place with a 
little effort/force. U might have to try at a few different angles of 
turning the layer with the missing edge :-)

Good luck!!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   May I make two suggestions for NXNXN notation?

   The first is to add &quot;c&quot; for center Rc Uc Bc.
   The second is to use brackets [...] instead of subscripts, if only
because not all keyboards and word processors have subscripts. Suppose
you are putting up a pretty pattern on a 50X50X50 cube. Multiples
could be written like r[2,4,6,9,11, 15...]&#x27;  which could save a whole
lot of typing. You might signify 180 turn of every other layer by
R[r-> 1/2]2 or r[r->1/2]2 where the first letter tells which layer to
start with.

   A certain complexity in the NXNXN notation seems unavoidable.

   I like * for times.

   If the &quot;Q&quot; is adopted then: if it&#x27;s clearer to you, and enough
others, if it&#x27;s lower case I&#x27;ve no objection, even though it&#x27;s clearer
to me as upper case.

   Regards,

David J

Hi Kenneth,

   Very cool looking robot.

   I&#x27;ve three questions:
     1 How does it make U or B moves?
     2 Can you teach it algs?
     3 Can it look ahead?

Regards,

David J

The way the Rubik&#x27;s Cube Manipulating Robot or RCMR would turn U is <br>
kind of complicated:<br>
<br>
The right arm grabs the left ungrabs, then the right arm rotates<br>
(turning the entire cube), the left arm grabs, the right arm <br>
ungrabs, the right arm counter rotates, then the bottom arm comes <br>
up, the left arm ungrabs, the bottom arm rotates (Turning the entire <br>
cube), then both right and left arms grab, bottom arm goes down, <br>
then left arm rotates turning the U. :)<br>
<br>
We turned it in today; right now you have to tell each arm to move <br>
individually.  We will eventually change the software, so you can <br>
enter multiple moves (up to 30), and then hit execute. (This <br>
function could be used in competitions scrambling each cube the <br>
same.)  We may add a camera like J P Browns robot, and then it will <br>
be fully independent. All one would have to do is hit a button and <br>
it would start solving.  <br>

The problem of notating slices has been solved in programming languages.
(Please forgive me if this has already been pointed out)

The slices from outer to inner are:

  R[0] (or just R, which is familiar)
  R[1]
  R[2]
  ...


R[m-n] groups a range of slices.
R[i,j,k] groups specific slices.
R[a-b,c,d-e] groups however you want.

For the implementors:

&lt;Move> ::= &lt;Object> | &lt;Object> &lt;Degree>
&lt;Object> ::= &lt;Side> | &lt;Side> [ &lt;RangeList> ]
&lt;RangeList> ::= &lt;Range> | &lt;Range> , &lt;RangeList>
&lt;Range> ::= &lt;N> | &lt;N> - &lt;N>
&lt;Degree> ::= 2 | &#x27;
&lt;N> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | ...

Very neat! But what can it actually do? Will it simply just turn two 
layers? Does it know how to solve a scrambled cube? Does it have 
vision to perceive the cube and take well-founded action? ... etc 
etc ...

And how about a non-lego robot solving the lego rubik&#x27;s cube ... ;-)

I prefer FLUBRD for faces, and use the following subscripts (or <br>

Subscript numbers seems reasonable, as long as they are not confused <br>

As the repeated sequence will be in brackets anyway, this is hardly <br>
necessary. After all, for single moves you write R2 and not R*2, but <br>
you could use it for clarity. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ross,

I&#x27;m not in Colorado, but speaking of &#x27;cube get togethers,&#x27; I just 
thought you might want to know that this summer there&#x27;s a United 
States Cube Championship in Pasadena. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve heard 
yet.
Colorado is pretty darned close to California, so you might want to 
look into that one.

   We&#x27;ve been discussing &quot;Q&quot; for cube and people like it and seem
willing to accept it.

   Using &quot;c&quot; for center was a suggestion for Chris&#x27;s general notation
for larger NXNXN cubes.

   How about single letter for single layer moves (main notation) and
double letters for two layer moves (mostly finger trick notation)?

   I prefer small case flubrd for slices in because it&#x27;s intuitive and
easy to remember. You move a single layer you have a single letter.
Also, used in the main notation for the 3x3x3 it&#x27;s the same for the 4x4x4.

   For finger tricks notations, OK, but why do you replace two letters
with two letters? Most write out algs with spaces between the letters,
if you want to indicate two moves together why not write F B as FB?

   That&#x27;s why I suggested brackets because numbering seems the best
way to delineate each layer, and we want to keep them separate from
the number 2 used by most everyone to mean 180 degree turn.

   Like (R2 D2)3? That makes sense. Yes, using * for &quot;times&quot; it does
sort of pop out at you, either way is OK with me. If the idea of
multiples is clear either way then it can be an option. Do you mean
parentheses, like most use, and not brackets? I prefer to reserve the
brackets for the use I stated before.

Oh, and I don&#x27;t /live/ in California. That&#x27;s just where the cube

Idaho.
Contact Tyson Mao for info on the championship.

          <div class="email-content">Hi All,<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ve been told that flipping over one edge pair on the 4x4x4 is<br>
called a parity problem, and that parity involves a quarter turn.<br>
<br>
   I tried it and it works, and is interesting.<br>
<br>
   So here is a way to flip over one edge pair using a quarter turn.<br>
<br>
   To see what it does and how start with a solved cube.<br>
<br>
   I put the double slice moves in parentheses for clarity.<br>
<br>
   My solution to parity:<br>
u&#x27;<br>
   That&#x27;s it!<br>
   Now put the other stuff back:<br>
   First put the centers back:<br>
(r l&#x27;) U2 (r&#x27; l) u&#x27; (r l&#x27;) U2 (r&#x27; l) u<br>
( qU d (r l&#x27;) U2 (r&#x27; l) d&#x27; (r l&#x27;) U2 (r&#x27; l) ) * 2<br>
   The centers should now be back in place.<br>
   Then match up the edges:<br>
R2 d2<br>
B&#x27; (r&#x27; l) B2 (r2 l2) B&#x27;<br>
L2 B (r2 l2) B2 (r l&#x27;) B<br>
L2 d&#x27; <br>
B&#x27; (r&#x27; l) B2 (r2 l2) B&#x27;<br>
L&#x27; B (r2 l2) B2 (r l&#x27;) B<br>
L d&#x27; R2<br>
   You should now have one edge pair UL flipped over.<br>
<br>
   If you have simpler ways to put the other stuff back I&#x27;d like to<br>
hear them.<br>
<br>
   This can be very fast in your hands once you see what it does.<br>

You need to be careful by what you mean here. A quarter slice turn 
will induce an odd permutation of the edges, which is indeed 
required. A quarter face turn will not and is no good here (indeed, 
it will end up messing the corners up) but can not fix the edges.

I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s so exciting here. You have to do an odd number 
of quarter slice turns in total and 1 is odd so really nothing is 
being said here. Indeed, arguably this (u&#x27;) isn&#x27;t your solution at 
all, because you said above you&#x27;d been told it had to be done. The 
remaining stuff is what really matters.

OK, so you could say that all of that is your solution, but not just

   Right! Parity involves a quarter turn of a slice.

   I was being ironic. Previous postings of parity solutions messed up

   Not quite.

   I was also out to demonstrate that the quarter turn itself is the
trick.

   Only for putting stuff back. You can do this next portion and move
center pieces only. Right?

   If you do that sequence to a solved cube you can see that it only
moves center pieces.

   And the next part, done by itself, will not flip an edge pair over
alone, it will also put 4 edge pieces one quarter turn out of alignment.

   If you do this sequence to a solved cube you twill see an edge pair
flipped and four edge pieces a quarter turn out of line.

   I would say that all of this is my *whole* solution.

Actually I don&#x27;t. Unless I misunderstand what you mean. See below.

That makes sense. Our difference is that to me slice moves aren&#x27;t a
main thing.

I can&#x27;t say two layer moves are either, but it turned out I needed a
notation for that.

I don&#x27;t use it for finger tricks, but for how to display it in an
animation.

When I do a slice move, it is definitely two moves. I saw some people
do it as one move in Toronto, but I still can&#x27;t quite grasp that.

The centers do not move, notationwise, in my system. If the red center
starts as the F side, it remains that way all the time.

Here is an example.

I have this 41 move solution on my site:

L2 D U2 B2 L U&#x27;F U&#x27; F U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F2 U2 R2 U F R&#x27; F&#x27; R F&#x27; R2 F R&#x27; F R F&#x27;
R2 F D R2 D&#x27; R&#x27; D R D&#x27; R&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; R2 

When animated, this doesn&#x27;t look very good. Half the time the
interesting things happpen where the viewer can&#x27;t see. So I want to
put in some rotations that makes the interesting parts visible. This
version is better:

L2 D U2 B2 L B> u&#x27; F U&#x27; F U&#x27; F&#x27; L> U| U&#x27; F2 UZ R2 U F R&#x27; F&#x27; R F&#x27; R2 F
R&#x27; F R F&#x27; R2 F D R2 D&#x27; R&#x27; D R D&#x27; R&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; R2

Note that you can easily strip out the whole cube rotations (B>, U|,
etc) and regular moves shown as two layer moves (U&#x27; changed to u&#x27;) to
get the pure &quot;mathemathical&quot; solution we started with. Putting in
those rotations was pretty easy to do, and would be easy to adjust
later. But imagine any of those things would change which sides had
what names. Every single move after every change would have to be
changed!!

That would be completely useless for my purposes.

(BTW, you can also see the notation UZ in there for what others call
U2&#x27;, a half turn counter clockwise)

Oh, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of telling you what notation to use. Use whatever
works for you. If we can use identical notations, that would be nice,
but if that is not practical, let&#x27;s not. No big deal either way.

I just meant that if L R&#x27; can be replaced by XX, XX F U should do the
same thing as L R&#x27; F U. I fear anarchy and disorder otherwise. If you
abandon the centers as the frame of reference, you are left without
any frame of reference at all. Which means that you can&#x27;t just look at
a cube and know which side is which. You have to trace through all
moves made on it previously to know even something that basic.

I couldn&#x27;t use that, but for people who do a lot of slice moves,
it may well be an acceptable tradeoff. So I guess ultimately there
is a need for both kinds of notations. They could be jammed into a
common system, or you could just use different conventions at
different times. As long as it&#x27;s clear to the reader which one
is used that could work fine.

          <div class="email-content">While we&#x27;re doing 4x4x4 parity algs, here&#x27;s another one just for fun.

(u&#x27; L2)*4 d [R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F] (d u&#x27;) [F&#x27; R U&#x27; F R&#x27;] u [R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F] d 
[F&#x27; R U&#x27; F R&#x27;] (d u&#x27;)

It flips the edge at BR.

(u&#x27; L2)*4 switches the center row in the u layer on the L face with 
the center row in the d layer on the L face.  If you know do a final 
u&#x27; you&#x27;ll resolve the centers using an odd number of quarter turns, 
which causes the &quot;edge parity&quot;.  The last part of the alg is fixing 
the edges sort of via the commutator principle and flipping edge 
groups around.  It&#x27;s not actually the commutator principle, but I 
use the flip alg and it&#x27;s inverse to alternately mess up and restore 
the rest of the cube.

Hey David, you&#x27;ve got me thinking now, I wonder what the shortest 
solution to the &quot;parity issue&quot; is?  By the parity issue I mean an 
alg that flips only one edge group, leaving the rest of the cube 
untouched (ignoring center positions of course).  The common move r2 
B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2  uses 15.  I wonder if there 
is one better.  The above alg uses (r2 B2) as a setup algorithm for 
the real alg which is the middle 11 moves.  I wonder if there is an 
algorithm that just directly solves the parity issue, rather than 
this one which uses the form (Setup) (algorithm) (inverse of 
setup).  Or I wonder if there is a short way to do this using the 
commutator principle.

hmm......

Heh heh now you&#x27;ve got me thinking.  I wonder if we can beat 15 
moves :)  or even just find another alg that equals it......

          <div class="email-content">OK!, here&#x27;s the deal: the paper stickers, as you know, come off... <br>
<br>
that was a year ago.<br>
<br>
I then used some tape: this stuff took a long time to cut into little<br>
facelets (and they peeled away quickly unless they were really small<br>
of had the corners snipped off). Except one colour (silver) which<br>
lasted for 10 months, all the other stickers lasted about a month,<br>
sometimes two... After 9 months of this, I&#x27;d had enough...<br>
<br>
So I then tried Gille&#x27;s method... glue plastic stickers on... the<br>
first glue I got was not good enough... the second *melted* the<br>
plastic on my cube, but completely failed to gain any purchase on the<br>
plastic stickers I cut out. I tried again: same old same old... Enough<br>
friction on a sticker and it would just give way and fall off (so I am<br>
ended up with a cube with two fscked up sides &#x27;cos I can&#x27;t get rid of<br>
the glue.<br>
<br>
Ok, paint!!!!!!!!!!! Two hours of searching later, the only paint that<br>
will not rub off with wear comes in one-litre tins... at like 50$ a tin...<br>
<br>
Nail Varnish! Works great and has the added bonus of confusing the<br>
heck out of the pour ladies who work at the makeup counter. <br>
<br>
Some points to remember:<br>
<br>
- If, like me, the only place you could find 5 very different coulours<br>
was in an oddity store where they also sell *very* kinky lingerie, the<br>
whole hello kitty assortment along with what looks at a distance like<br>
stuff for BDSM (no, I didn&#x27;t go and get a closer look), then you&#x27;ll<br>
find that 1)there is no way the shop assistants are going to be<br>
surprised at your request and 2)they will be very helpful and will<br>
even go out back to find different coulours 3)nail varnish ranges in<br>
cost between 2$ and 25$ - cheap is good<br>
<br>
- be very wary in choosing your colors: make sure your green and<br>
yellow cannot be confused<br>
- make sure your green and blue cannot be confused<br>
- make sure none of your colors are too transparent (my red is and<br>
even after 3 coats, it is still very dark)<br>
- don&#x27;t worry about little sparkles, but do try to avoid them<br>
<br>
- apply multiple thin coats. nail varnishes drys on the outside first.<br>
and if there is still wet varnish inside, it will take ages to harden<br>
- the varnish will probably be dry after 10mn and will be resistant to<br>
smudging. ***BUT**** it will *not* be hard. I you cube, you may<br>
discover that, like me, your nails get in the way a lot. Allow an<br>
extra couple of hours...<br>

   Right! Parity involves a quarter turn of a slice.

   Not quite.

   I was also out to demonstrate that the quarter turn itself is the
trick.

   Only for putting stuff back. You can do this next portion and move
center pieces only. Right?

   If you do that sequence to a solved cube you can see that it only
moves center pieces.

   And the next part, done by itself, will not flip an edge pair over
alone, it will also put 4 edge pieces one quarter turn out of alignment.

   If you do this sequence to a solved cube you twill see an edge pair
flipped and four edge pieces a quarter turn out of line.

   I would say that all of this is my *whole* solution.

GAH!

OK!, here&#x27;s the deal: the paper stickers, as you know, come off... 

that was a year ago.

I then used some tape: this stuff took a long time to cut into little
facelets (and they peeled away quickly unless they were really small
of had the corners snipped off). Except one colour (silver) which
lasted for 10 months, all the other stickers lasted about a month,
sometimes two... After 9 months of this, I&#x27;d had enough...

So I then tried Gille&#x27;s method... glue plastic stickers on... the
first glue I got was not good enough... the second *melted* the
plastic on my cube, but completely failed to gain any purchase on the
plastic stickers I cut out. I tried again: same old same old... Enough
friction on a sticker and it would just give way and fall off (so I am
ended up with a cube with two fscked up sides &#x27;cos I can&#x27;t get rid of
the glue.

Ok, paint!!!!!!!!!!! Two hours of searching later, the only paint that
will not rub off with wear comes in one-litre tins... at like 50$ a tin...

Nail Varnish! Works great and has the added bonus of confusing the
heck out of the pour ladies who work at the makeup counter. 

Some points to remember:

- If, like me, the only place you could find 5 very different coulours
was in an oddity store where they also sell *very* kinky lingerie, the
whole hello kitty assortment along with what looks at a distance like
stuff for BDSM (no, I didn&#x27;t go and get a closer look), then you&#x27;ll
find that 1)there is no way the shop assistants are going to be
surprised at your request and 2)they will be very helpful and will
even go out back to find different coulours 3)nail varnish ranges in
cost between 2$ and 25$ - cheap is good

- be very wary in choosing your colors: make sure your green and
yellow cannot be confused
- make sure your green and blue cannot be confused
- make sure none of your colors are too transparent (my red is and
even after 3 coats, it is still very dark)
- don&#x27;t worry about little sparkles, but do try to avoid them

- apply multiple thin coats. nail varnishes drys on the outside first.
and if there is still wet varnish inside, it will take ages to harden
- the varnish will probably be dry after 10mn and will be resistant to
smudging. ***BUT**** it will *not* be hard. I you cube, you may
discover that, like me, your nails get in the way a lot. Allow an
extra couple of hours...

Oh yeah, my cube is now:

dark red, opposite golden metallic yellow
metallic blue opposite turquoise green with sparkles
pinkish silver opposite black (no varnish)

That *r0Xor*

I am now one hoopy cube frood

yeah!!!!!

(but my average stays the same, damn!)

So why not just silver? You&#x27;d improve your times dramatically too.

   But you&#x27;re still using a single letter to denote moving two layers,
and even thought you throw in a cube rotation you are still changing
which sides four centers are on.

   Perhaps. There is a) main notation, and b) finger trick notation,
and now, maybe c) computer trick notation. I see you&#x27;ve noted this
possibility in your last paragraph

   This a discussion about adopting a single notation. That is the
context of my statement, and I was interpreting your statments in that
context. Sorry if I misunderstood you.

   Then perhaps that needs adjusting. But is it really so hard to tell
that a slice like r means the centers move, and to deal with what&#x27;s in
your hands?

   You&#x27;ll have to give me an example of this.

27cmx27cmx27cm.  It is wood, and we anticipate it to

collectors item I&#x27;m sure!  After we make templates we
will be able to sell it to anyone who wants one,

We figure a good price might be something around

          <div class="email-content">this thread is a great example of why the concept of representation 
by committee is so ubiquitous in human society.  it&#x27;s simply 
impossible to come to consenus on complex subjects when every human 
has direct input.

:)

if i were making the notation standard, i&#x27;d recommend:

U R L B F D to mean the various faces clockwise
L&#x27; would mean left face counter clockwise
R&quot; would be a 180 turn of the right face (R2 is reserved for use as 
described below for nxnxn cubes)
U2 would mean the 2nd slice from the top clockwise
D4&#x27; would mean the 4th slice from the bottom counter clockwise
center slice moves are just another case of the above 2 rules
there would be no whole-cube rotations because this is superfluous 
for algorithm representation.

i find this system readable, intuitive, typeable.

but, too many people have too many other ideas that also make a lot 
of sense.  so alas, it seems consensus is impossible without an 
official committee.

I hate to say this but I&#x27;ve already put in a lot of effort into a national tournament to be held 
at Caltech in Pasadena on July 10.  I haven&#x27;t sent the official schedules and information to 
Dave yet but I plan to do that right after I&#x27;m done with the April 3 tournament.

Anyway, just something to think about.  Having two summer tournaments would decrease 
attendence to both.

Speaking of cubes for iPAQs, have you seen this cube app: 
http://www.pdaadvanced.com/html/product.asp?ID=3
You get 4 cubes (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5), a skewb (which they 
call a piracube??), and 4 levels of pyraminxes!

If you just want the cubes though, you can get them for free at:

This one is *okay* but I&#x27;d prefer something that&#x27;s simpler, ie.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jasmine!

I&#x27;m sorry i have to disappoint you. I don&#x27;t use my iPaq as a timing 
device. And besides i&#x27;m not really aspiring to a world record (yet;-
) ) so i only measure times in 1/10 th of a second normally. When i 
time myself i use the Cubixplayer available in the Files section of 
this group. And yes, that&#x27;s my own program :D I set the preinspection 
time to 0 secs normally cause i dun allow myself that (on 4x4x4 and 
5x5x5, which is what i practice now). Then i simply have a look at 
the timer when the cube is solved. According to rules i then add 0.5 
secs when i take an average.

Btw i&#x27;m working heavily on Cubixplayer2 with which one can select any 
cube from size 2->7 (2x2x2 -> 7x7x7). Only regular cubes, not weird 
ones like 4x4x5 or 3x3x6 ;-) That version will have a super-
supercubing option. In case u wonder, that means that all internal 
cubes must also be solved, so all nxnxn cubicles must have their 
faces oriented the same way. Still need to work out how to visualise 
that though, either &quot;explosion&quot; or gradually removing outer &quot;shells&quot; 
(peeling an onion) ... we&#x27;ll see.

One more thing: I do not agree that whole-cube rotations are 
superfluous. New algorithms should respect this possibility (my 
opinion)! ZB system will.
In my proposition it is automatically resolved, for example R3 (for 
3x3x3 cube) means nothing else but the whole-cube move!

   What? You found my 73 movement solution unsatisfactory?! :)

   I&#x27;ve had the same thought. 

   I think there&#x27;s something interesting in both parity algs you posted. 

   (R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F) u (F&#x27; R U&#x27; F R&#x27;) u&#x27; on a 3x3x3 flips two edges.


   It would be nice to find a 4x4x4 parity alg about 12 moves, but I
wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if 15 is the limit.

73? I thought your solution was u&#x27; - that was it, as I recall. Isn&#x27;t 
that 1 move?

   Details, details! :)

   The other 72 moves are there for esthetic reasons. :)

          <div class="email-content">I personally am very keen to host an official tournament sometime in 
the near future.  I am without a doubt going to the US competition 
this July though, so I will be spending most of my time for the next 
three months practicing like crazy for that competition.  After July 
I will be free to start getting in touch with my contacts to reserve 
a venue on campus.  Also, I already have several contacts for 
possible judges lined up.  Since this group is a place where most 
people gather, what is the overall opinion on having an official US 
competition again before the 2005 Worlds.  If me and Tyson can work 
it out it sounds like we&#x27;ll be doing an east coast seat over here in 
NC and a west coast seat over in Pasadena.  We could communicate the 
results via e-mail/telephone/etc. and declare a US winner for each 
round and have a celebration at each venue.  Is this too much money 
for people to travel right before the worlds?  NC and California are 
on the most extreme ends of the continent for you Midwest people.  
Would you guys be willing to travel to either Cali. or NC?  

I would love to organize the east coast portion any time after 
July.  I think it would be about 100000 times better if we were able 
to get Tyson and I to get a venue for the same weekend on both our 
campuses and have a US competition again.

What dates are better for people?  Would something this coming 
winter be good?  Or maybe spring, just a few months before the world 
competition?  Tyson, are you fairly free to reserve a venue any time 
you need one?  If that is the case then the date might depend on the 
day I am able to reserve a venue over here (I&#x27;m trying to reserve 
the planetarium since my contact there competed in US regional 
tournys back in the 80&#x27;s and he could probably identify with a cube 
competition again).  If the date depends on me, then I&#x27;ll go ahead 
and start the ball rolling and reserve the venue for several months 
down the road.

Like I mentioned, I&#x27;m very excited about organizing this 
competition, but my priorities right now lie 100% with the US 
competition this summer.  If any other East coast people can&#x27;t wait 
until this coming winter or later this year for me to really dig in 
with my ideas, then please feel free to organize something.  After 
July I&#x27;ll be ready to really give this everything I&#x27;ve got, but for 
right now I&#x27;ve got some World Championship redemption issues (as 
I&#x27;ve seen it put on the records lists) that I&#x27;m dealing with :)

Please everyone who would attend the East Coast portion of this 
possibly 2nd US championps let me know when a good date for you is.  
When I do go in to get the planetarium (fingers crossed) I want to 
have several options of good dates for which I can go ahead and try 
to reserve the place.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

Yes Chris, I am fairly free to reserve a venue at any time.  Since it&#x27;s much harder for you to 
secure a venue, you might as well reserve a venue first and I&#x27;ll try to get the same date and 
time which should be almost certainly possible, especially if I reserve many months in 
advance.

The 2004 US Championships is still on for July 10 at Caltech.  I will get out an official 
schedule of events right after the April 3rd competition.  After April 3rd, I will be able to 
donate all my cube-organization time to the national championships.

Please fill in an entry in the table I have created in the database so I can start to get a 
vague idea of how many people will show up and how much &quot;national&quot; attraction we are 
getting.

As I just mentioned, I have created a table in the database section.  Please sign-up if you <br>
are considering to attend the US Championships in 2004.  This is so I can get a rough idea <br>

          <div class="email-content">I live on the east coast (Rhode Island) and i&#x27;m interested in going 
to a tournament. A good time would be the winter maybe around news 
years. The only problem is that NC is fairly close to the worlds in 
FL which i will definately be at. I don&#x27;t know if I would be able to 
travel down that way twice in such a short time period. I think NYC 
would be a good close place but I realize the world doesn&#x27;t revolve 
around me and I don&#x27;t think I could handle organizing one by myself.
Wherever it is, I&#x27;ll make an effort to attend though.

Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Yes Chris, I am fairly free to reserve a venue at any time. Since it&#x27;s much harder for you to <br>
secure a venue, you might as well reserve a venue first and I&#x27;ll try to get the same date and <br>
time which should be almost certainly possible, especially if I reserve many months in <br>
advance.<br>
<br>
The 2004 US Championships is still on for July 10 at Caltech. I will get out an official <br>
schedule of events right after the April 3rd competition. After April 3rd, I will be able to <br>
donate all my cube-organization time to the national championships.<br>
<br>
Please fill in an entry in the table I have created in the database so I can start to get a <br>
vague idea of how many people will show up and how much &quot;national&quot; attraction we are <br>
getting.<br>

Well, your voices were heard, and I have tried to design a dynamic site frame for everyone&#x27;s purposes, here are some highlights:<br>
<br>
-dynamic contest system, supporting any one puzzle type: 2x2-5x5, square 1, pyraminx and megaminx with any one solvetype: speed, super, hyper, underwater, one handed, blind. many combinations of contests will be provided on a regular basis. Skill points, which will be managed in your user profile, will be given out to the top three contenders in each of these contests.<br>
<br>
-dynamic algorithm post: algorithms for any solving method will be posted and organized on a regular basis, and your input will be readily accepted as to the efficiency and/or necessity of such algorithms.<br>
<br>
-dynamic profile system: profiles will include a personal picture, personal best time, personal average, and your very own video (cap @ 2MB). Profiles are searchable and editable.<br>
<br>
-dynamic article system: articles written by the site&#x27;s reporters (application process used for those who wish to be reporters, email me if you want to and what you could offer to the site and how often :) ) will touch on a variety of cubing subjects such as: method comparison, cube maintenance, and notation standardization prospects.<br>
<br>
Tentative site completion date 4/12/04<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think!<br>

impacts on the summer tournament and any tournament that Chris decides to hold.  Read <br>
below... we&#x27;re working it out right now.<br>
<br>
Hi Tyson<br>
I have had quite a lot of negative feedback from people who don&#x27;t think that<br>
a local event should be allowed to break the records - the pressure of a<br>
local event being much less than a world or national event.<br>
Not sure what to suggest but think that the record if it gets broken can<br>
still be submitted as a new record to rubiks.com, speedcubing.com and<br>
Guinness but the &quot;official&quot; fastest time and &quot;official&quot; record remain until<br>

          <div class="email-content">Just my personal opinions on this issue.  I think that as long as a <br>
tournament is setup to meet official rules, then it shouldn&#x27;t matter <br>
whether or not it is a national event or not.  If a record is set, <br>
it should count as the official record.  What if someone broke a <br>
Guinness record in front a judge and according to all the rules, but <br>
they turned it down because not enough people were watching the <br>
person perform?  What if someone came along who was really the next <br>
Tiger Woods of cubing and absolutely shattered the fastest average <br>
record and we had to say, &quot;sorry your amazing record does not count <br>
because this tournament is not a national tournament.&quot;  I think it <br>
is wrong to not allow any record set to be official.<br>
<br>
Seriously, we all know that if there are enough tournaments held, <br>
then by the law of probability someone will have almost all edges <br>
solved after finishing the corners, or someone will skip the PLL or <br>
OLL step and get a time faster than what we all normally achieve.  <br>
The record WILL one day be less than 10 seconds if we have enough <br>
tournaments.  Someone will get a lucky time, it is bound to happen <br>
if enough official attempts are taken.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I have some very strong opinions on this issue.  A record <br>
set at a tournament with impartial judges and that follows all the <br>
other rules that we have defined as official should be the new <br>
record.  As an &quot;Official World Record holder&quot; myself I would rather <br>
see someone shatter my one-handed 3x3x3 record in a local tournament <br>
and have their attempt be the new official record than to see <br>
someone who is better than me record an official time much better <br>
than mine, but my record still count.  That doesn&#x27;t make any sense <br>
to me.<br>
<br>
As a record holder I totally disagree.  Any record set should count, <br>
regardless of whether or not the tournament has official enough <br>
status.  If the tournament meets the official RCC rules, then all <br>
records set there should count, period.<br>

&gt; Hi Tyson<br>
&gt; I have had quite a lot of negative feedback from people who don&#x27;t <br>
think that<br>
&gt; a local event should be allowed to break the records - the <br>
pressure of a<br>
&gt; local event being much less than a world or national event.<br>

broken can<br>
&gt; still be submitted as a new record to rubiks.com, speedcubing.com <br>

remain until<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree... PocketCounter is terrific for the iPAQ 3970 which runs 
PocketPC 2002.  However, PocketCounter is not compatible with 
PocketPC 2003 devices.  

So, unfortunately it does not work on any of the new killer HP iPAQ 
handhelds....

&lt;&lt; shameless plug... I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer for HP and design the 
iPAQ handhelds ;) >>

Attention all whiz-bang programmers.  I will donate an HP iPAQ to the 
the person who develops a cube timer for Windows Mobile 2003 that is 
easy to use and has the following features:

(similar to Dan Knight&#x27;s CubeTimer)
1.  Generates a random 25 move scrambling alg.
2.  Floating 12 solve average.
3.  Min and max times
4.  Best and worst session averages
5.  Rubik&#x27;s background theme.

Email me the program and I will select the best entry as the winner.  
May 31st is the deadline.

Good luck and email me if you have questions.

On the one site, you have to define what is an official record, and 
on the other site a more local event might have less presure or 
competion.

But when you win a big tournament, sure this will be more important 
as a record time. To win a more local event is nice but you might 
have not enough competition to feel a big winner. I gues the price on 
a local event is to set a record time.

My experience is that it makes no difference, pressure ,stress, if it 
is a big tournament or a more local event. Only during training with 
friends I can now perform as expected.

One things remains a fact a Chris stated, someone will get a lucky 
time, this it is bound to happen. I would consider only an official 
average record the official fastes cuber in the world. Not the one 
with the fastes solve

Some predictions
3x3x3 record     13.5 this year
3x3x3 average    16.5 seconds this year

3x3x3 record     11.0 seconds within the upcomming 2 years
3x3x3 average    15.5 seconds withing the upcomming 2 years

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s my biggest concern... the whole idea that a record of the &quot;fastest&quot; solve is 
meaningless.  Lucky cases WILL happen.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you scramble 
the cube.

What do you guys think about the official &quot;fastest&quot; record being the average middle 10 of 
12 solves that we&#x27;ve all been doing?  At my tournament, those that make it into the final 
round will have completed 12 solves.

Gah... I am SO stressed right now.

As you say, eventually someone will get a lucky solve in an official
tournament too and the official fastest solve will go below 10 sec. It&#x27;s
just a question of time.

That&#x27;s my biggest concern... the whole idea that a record of the &quot;fastest&quot;
solve is
meaningless.  Lucky cases WILL happen.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you
scramble
the cube.

What do you guys think about the official &quot;fastest&quot; record being the average
middle 10 of
12 solves that we&#x27;ve all been doing?  At my tournament, those that make it
into the final
round will have completed 12 solves.

Gah... I am SO stressed right now.

          <div class="email-content">I guess I do see some of their concern in having too many events and thus diffusing the 
&quot;hype&quot; about the Rubik&#x27;s cube... I am beginning to believe that the idea of the record for 
&quot;fastest solve&quot; is flawed.  As you all have mentioned, if the record is broken with a lucky 
solve and set at something ridiculous such as 8 seconds, the record becomes 
meaningless.  Perhaps the RCC would consider changing their idea of the record to the 
average.

The Rubik&#x27;s Cube record is unlike other sporting events.  There isn&#x27;t really a lucky &quot;100 
meter dash&quot;.  How fast you can run that race is determined by your physical body as well 
as your mental concentration.

I understand that pressure is a large factor in an international competition... but is it really 
fair to consider pressure as to determine a record?  It could also be argued that pressure 
provides an advantageous andrenaline rush or something... I don&#x27;t know.

Well, the April 3rd competition will most certainly go on.  The July 10 summer 
championships is still on... even if we aren&#x27;t allowed to break world records, there&#x27;s no 
reason why speedcubing.com can&#x27;t have a record category for unofficial official 
tournament records and such.  Hopefully we can get some more concrete answers for the 
July 10 tournament.

Does anyone know if the French competition is official?

          <div class="email-content">Not sure who if anyone has considered what the set of records should be in
speedcubing.  I absolutely agree that the event shouldnt matter so long as
there is an offical presence to ratify the times.  To lose sight of the
fastest ever solve in official competition would be a shame but clearly a
fastest average is a better indication.  Its the difference between Bob
Beamon&#x27;s long jump record and having Carl Lewis jump a consistent series for
example (ok not a good example as long jumping doesn&#x27;t keep track of the
best series).

I noticed during the discussion about notation that someone pointed out the
problem of trying to determine anything through such a wide variety of
parties and that some sort of official body/committtee would be better.  I
would say that this is a similar issue.  A list of official world records or
potential world records approved by such a body would make sense - it
doesn&#x27;t have to be set it stone, it can always be reviewed.

          <div class="email-content">A record should be based on whether the rules for the record are met, <br>
not where the record attempt is made.  <br>
<br>
In many sports that are based on performance time, competitors <br>
wanting to make a record attempt often hand-pick where they will to <br>
compete.  And they usually don&#x27;t pick world competitions for those <br>
attempts; in fact, it&#x27;s well known that the Olympics is not a great <br>
place for trying to set world records.  But as far as I know there&#x27;s <br>
no sport where rules specify that records can only be set at the <br>
Olympics!<br>

&gt; Hi Tyson<br>
&gt; I have had quite a lot of negative feedback from people who don&#x27;t <br>
think that<br>
&gt; a local event should be allowed to break the records - the pressure <br>
of a<br>
&gt; local event being much less than a world or national event.<br>
&gt; Not sure what to suggest but think that the record if it gets <br>
broken can<br>
&gt; still be submitted as a new record to rubiks.com, speedcubing.com <br>
and<br>
&gt; Guinness but the &quot;official&quot; fastest time and &quot;official&quot; record <br>
remain until<br>
&gt; beaten at National or International level ?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi, I don&#x27;t read all the emails and so this is the first time I&#x27;ve 
heard the Calif. competition referred to as the US Championship.  
Does that mean it&#x27;s sanctioned by the RRC (or some other cube group 
that&#x27;s been formed?)?  Is there going to be a corporate sponsor for 
this one?  I had thought it was just a home-grown tournament that 
someone was being nice enough to organize.
Thanks,
Adam

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,  <br>
<br>
   If someone feels less pressure at a local and can actually solve<br>
closer to their ability, I say go for it. If pressure is the issue<br>
that is, more pressure at the Worlds, less at the locals, then I would<br>
think that we should encourage less-pressure events so that shy people<br>
get a fair crack at the records.<br>
<br>
   But some people may feel more pressure in a local tourney because<br>
they&#x27;re performing in front of their friends and family. Or it may be<br>
the other way around and a competitor at a local event might not feel<br>
pushed to do his or her absolute best because there is less competition.<br>
<br>
   I think that while some people have a hard time under pressure,<br>
some people don&#x27;t, and others actually thrive under pressure. Having<br>
local, national, and world events allows for all a more even-handed<br>
chance at records.<br>
<br>
   If times are not official the participants may feel let down. I was<br>
disappointed that Macky got no credit officially in January. <br>
<br>
   Personally I think that the April 3 tourney should be official if<br>
only to give Macky another crack at the records.<br>
<br>

<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello all,<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess records at the french championship will be officialised, but <br>
i&#x27;m not sure ... (The scramble of cubes ,about 40 moves, will not be <br>
the same for all competitors ... hum hum ...).<br>
Normally we will use timer pad.<br>
About the question of officialness i think the number of cubes <br>
realised are crutial. More you have cube to do , more you have <br>
chance to do good times or have a luky configuration. For exemple<br>
at caltech tourmament there are 2 rounds before final so there are <br>
3+3+5 cubes realised (i guess) . For the french championship only 5 <br>
cubes will be done !<br>

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve all played the game with a stopwatch where you have <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello all, this is my first post. <br>
<br>
About a month ago I learned how to solve a rubik&#x27;s cube using some <br>
website that taught the layer-by-layer technique. It works, but it <br>
takes me about 3 or 4 minutes. Someone mentioned to me that I learn <br>
one of the three speed methods: Petrus method, Fridrich method, and <br>
Corners First. Im baffled as to which of the three I should choose. <br>
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Somewhere on the internet one time, I found a really fun game where 
you click a button, and a timer started going but you couldn&#x27;t see 
it. Then, when you think amount of time that was assigned that level 
had passed, you click stop. If you were within something like one 
second on either side (up or down), you got to the next level. I got 
to sixteen seconds once.

Here&#x27;s another one:

on level one, my best time is about 12.something seconds.

          <div class="email-content">Welcome to the club!
I&#x27;m the one on the unicycle forum who mentioned that to you, by the 
way.
Most people here use the Fridrich method, with which they have 
attained average times of under seventeen seconds. Only a couple 
people have ever gotten sub-20 averages using the Petrus Method, 
though. And with the corners first, there&#x27;s someone named David 
Allen (who doesn&#x27;t post here) who I&#x27;ve heard averages 14-15 seconds.

It doesn&#x27;t make too much difference. If you want to get fast 
quickly, then I would suggest going with the Fridrich method.

          <div class="email-content">Ah, another Grant, you are destined for greatness with a name such as that. As for the benefits of each method, I may offer a tad bit of input:
 
Petrus - involves a thinking-intensive building process, If you arent into learning by trial and error, dont choose Petrus. However, Lars himself (I believe), and I paraphrase this to the best of my ability, bills the efficiency of his system on the fact that it requires minimal breakage of the already solved portions of the cube in order for one to build on to it. Another benefit is a preformed top cross on the last couple of steps. making LL a little simpler to understand and learn.
 
Fridrich - The oft-used and fused method of layers, involves an algorithm intensive learning process. If memorization is your weak point, go with Corners First or Petrus. Although, Some solvers have fused the ideas of the method (Knights, O&#x27;Hare, Jasmine, or Myself for example) into easy to learn beginners methods that only require 10-20 algorithms to master. This is my method and I am a tad biased toward it, so I will provide this information as a close to this section: the fridrich method is the method with the most gradation in terms of learning processes, this fact almost compensates for the volume of algorithms one must learn to master it.
 
Corners First - This method, which would be better to be expanded upon by someone who has actually tinkered with it, involves a nice balance between algorithmic and intuitive learning. I&#x27;ve heard that Macky has taught it to some as a beginner&#x27;s method.

          <div class="email-content">Well I&#x27;m not really an authority on the Fridrich F2L, but it doesnt seem 
as overwhelming as that when you just learn to do it intuitively.  What 
I do is mostly just different combinations of the same moves, and I can 
normally place a C/E pair in 7-10 moves max without stopping to think.  
I think you are probably right though in the 60&#x27;s ballpark.

Just as a side note, one of my friends broke my 2x2x2 Homer Simpson 
puzzle today, one of the rectangular pieces with the 4 pegs broke in the 
middle.  One of the pegs broke off.  I was still able to get it back 
together though (without instructions), and I am totally convinced that 
assembling a Homer Simpson 2x2x2 is way the hell harder than just 
solving it =)

<br>
If you have problems with intuitive solving, then try here:<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/peter/AllesFastTwoLayer.html<br>
That is a big list of all of the F2L possibilities.  I found it <br>
confusing and hard to learn from mahself, but whatever suits you.<br>
<br>
The intuitive part used to throw me for a loop, and I was averaging <br>
mid-low 40s with your method, except I used Dan Knight&#x27;s 4-look LL and I <br>
did the cross on the bottom (I could execute RURURU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27; a LOT faster <br>
than I could execute D&#x27;R&#x27;DRDFD&#x27;F&#x27;).  Francois Sechet (very fast) <br>
recommended to me that I try learning the Fridrich F2L intuitively, as <br>
did Raul Garcia (also very fast) to some extent, and I havent turned <br>
back since then.  It has a pretty steep learning curve but once you get <br>
the basics down you can string together moves to insert pretty much any <br>
C/E pair combo in the F2L that you are presented with.<br>
<br>
Another good option that you can get VERY fast with is using a <br>
working-corner method of solving.  It is less direct and more intuitive <br>
than the others, but it is a good way to average in the mid-high 20s.   <br>
I dont have a link, so google is probably your best bet if you are <br>
interested.  Still, the fastest cubers around use the Fridrich F2L, so <br>
that is what I stuck with learning.<br>
<br>
    &quot;Maybe cubing isn&#x27;t for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t give up so easily!  We were all there at one point in time... you <br>
can&#x27;t average 20s and 30s overnight.  With practice you will be there <br>
soon enough.<br>
<br>
Feel free to add me to AIM (dogcannibal) or MSN <br>

PS.  The other day in Spanish I (I am in High School)  I came up with a <br>
new verb:  &quot;cubar&quot;, literally meaning &quot;to cube&quot;.  Other verb forms:  <br>
(yo) cubo, (tu) cubas, (ud/el/ella) cuba, (nosotros) cubandos.  Nice, eh?<br>

http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html
and after you mastered that, learning to use a working corner is 
easy and can save a lot of time. Don&#x27;t give up!

I never actually wrote that I&#x27;d got to 67.00. All I wrote was 67.00 
and left the rest to people&#x27;s imaginations.

No trick. I, myself, can&#x27;t do 67.00 but maybe somebody else can. I 
don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s many people could get to 68.00 though. 67.00, I 
think, is probably an upper bound to what can be done with practice.

I still think people who average sub 20 (or even sub 30) must be 
impossible. Of course, there are some who do impossible things before 
breakfast as a course of habit.

Nah - I was just making a guess about what can&#x27;t be beaten. I&#x27;m not 
claiming 67.00 for myself.

You might try taking it apart and shimming toothpicks or something <br>

The best way I&#x27;ve created a speed cube is just by using it and using it and using it, it takes awhile but you hardly need to do anything with it except clean it. Have fun breaking in your cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone.  For those of you who use Studio cubes, how do you fix <br>
them up to get fast times without sacrificing stability and having <br>
pieces pop a lot?  I&#x27;ve pretty much only ever used rubiks.com cubes <br>
(or store bought really) and I&#x27;ve gotten really good at fixing those <br>
up like I like them, however I can&#x27;t seem to do the same on my <br>
studios.  I&#x27;ve started tweaking the screws a lot on my Studio to try <br>
to get used to what tensions I like, but I&#x27;ve found a problem.  <br>
Perhaps this is because of my wrist, but I prefer my cubes to be <br>
fairly loose.  The problem with this is that on a cube that I would <br>
consider a GREAT speedcube, I tend to pop on it a lot under pressure <br>
(popping + solving during a competition = VERY not cool).  When I <br>
work a studio cube to the smoothness/loosenes that I like it pops <br>
like CRAZY.  I have to loosen the screws a lot to get it the way I <br>
like, and I mean I can feel the pieces moving out of their places <br>
because the centers don&#x27;t hold them on well.  I&#x27;ve tried tightening <br>
the screws until the cube is stable again and using a LOT of <br>
silicone to compensate, however once the silicone wears off after a <br>
couple of days (I use Prestone brand) then I can again feel that the <br>
cube is really tight.  Also, I noticed that most of the other cubes <br>
that I tried from people at the championships in 2003 were what I <br>
considered to be fairly stiff cubes.  I remember clearly trying <br>
Ron&#x27;s cube and thinking that it was a lot stiffer than I expected it <br>
to be for the times he gets.<br>
<br>
So I guess my problem is that getting a studio cube as loose as I <br>
like it means tightening the screws and using a LOT of lube, but the <br>
lube wears off fast, so do I have to lube it every day to keep it <br>
loose?  Also I hate days where the cube is still loose, but it needs <br>
a lube job soon, so my times are only mediocre but not bad enough to <br>
warrant a lube job yet.  It just confuses me :-S  Another thing its <br>
that just from wear and tear the faces and pieces will loosen so I <br>
will eventually have to tighten the screws again.<br>
<br>
Can anyone offer some Studio cube advice to someone used to the <br>
rubiks.com cubes?  Also, contrary to what I read a lot, rubiks.com <br>
cubes are excellent for speedcubing once you get them worked in <br>
right (in my opinion and for my preferred looseness of the cube).  <br>
Their major downside is they can get to this amazingly awesome <br>
speedsolving point, but once it passes that point there are no <br>
screws to tighten and the cube is just too loose.  However, at this <br>
point it doesn&#x27;t take much more work to make an excellent one handed <br>
cube :)<br>
<br>
Anyway, can anyone offer advice to a studio cube user who likes <br>
fairly loose cubes, but doesn&#x27;t want it to pop allllll the time?<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,
 
Anyways, I have a Studio Cube myself and I had the exact same problem (keeps on popping + stiff). What I did is that i took off the screws and the springs, and I compressed the springs until they are about 3/5 the original length. Then I silicone sprayed all the cubies. Then you put it all back together and rescrew the screws + the springs back on until it was between stiff and okay. And since that the cubies are siliconed, the Studio Cube will be pretty loose and doesn&#x27;t pop that much. Hope that helps!

          <div class="email-content">Hello all, I recently bought a cube and surfed the web for a good way <br>
to solve the cube fast, and was amazed at what I found!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have been &quot;cubing&quot; for about 4 days and I am usually <br>
getting between 1:20(usually &quot;lucky&quot;) and 2:05 for the worst case <br>
ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
So far I have been using the Lars Petrus method taught on his page<br>
(lar5.com/cube).<br>
<br>
I kept hearing about the Jessica method, but all the pages linked toh <br>
ttp://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html , which is the wrong <br>
address, when they meant to link to <br>
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/<br>
<br>
Anyway, So I learnt the Petrus method instead of the Jessica method.<br>
<br>
Honestly I am not able to devote a TON of time towards memorizing <br>
algorithms, right now I can solve a cube really only knowing 3 <br>
different algorithms(nikola, sune and allen in the &quot;Petrus&quot; method).<br>
<br>
My goal is to just be able to constantly get under 1 minute.<br>
<br>
So my questions are:<br>
<br>
1. Now that I know the Petrus method and have memorized the different <br>
algorithms and customized them to my hands, would switching to the <br>
Jessica method give me faster times?<br>
<br>
Is the Petrus method good by speed cubing standards? Now that I&#x27;ve <br>
started to learn it and have decent times with it, should I bother to <br>
work on learning the Jessica method, or just work on improving my <br>
times with the petrus method?<br>
<br>
2. Can you learn the Jessica method without memorizing the large <br>
amounts of algorithms? could you solve it(slower of course) with only <br>
something like 5 algorithms?<br>
<br>
Oh also, any idea how much faster you can get with a lubed cube? I <br>
was thinking of lubing it sometime in the future and was wondering <br>
how much faster times I could expect...<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help you guys could give me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,

Welcome to the group. :)

Lars Petrus himself, and others, have achieved world class times (sub 
20 seconds) with his method. So, yes, it&#x27;s clearly a good method for 
speedcubing. However, Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s method is certainly the more 
widely used method among speedcubers 
(http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html). A full Fridrich 
method involves learning a *huge* number of algorithms, so probably 
not what you&#x27;re after at the moment.

I&#x27;ve experimented with both methods and I personally prefer 
Jessica&#x27;s. I think both methods are good, I just found that Jessica&#x27;s 
method suited me better. Having said this, I actually don&#x27;t use a 
full Fridrich method, I use a 3-look LL instead of 2-look LL. I would 
suggest you have a bit of play with both methods too and see which 
one suits your hands/mind better.

I wrote up a beginner method which I&#x27;ve been using to successfully 
teach several people. It&#x27;s a really really really super simplified 
version of something that could be developed into the Fridrich 
method. I basically extracted the really core elements and put them 
together into a solution 
(http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html). 
There are people who can do 30 second solves with this method. I 
personally cannot, but I can certainly solve in under a minute with 
this method. If you want a solution that will give you an idea about 
Jessica&#x27;s method, but won&#x27;t involve you learning zillions of 
algorithms then I&#x27;d recommend trying it. If you do, you should read 
Jessica&#x27;s site too so you&#x27;ll see how incredibly simplified my 
beginner solution is compared to Jessica&#x27;s full method.

If my beginner page is too easy for you, then you could try Dan 
Knights&#x27; intermediate solution 
(http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Intermediate.html) or 
his advanced solution 
(http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Advanced.html)

My beginner solution and Dan Knights&#x27; intermediate and advanced 
solutions are really just steps along the way to a full Fridrich 
method. Some people jump straight into Jessica&#x27;s full method, some 
(like myself) prefer to take it a bit more slowly and build up to an 
expert method.

Have fun!  :)

Jasmine.

   Doing something like that increases your chances of having an
accident about 5 fold. Pay attention while you&#x27;re driving - heck, see
if you can get as good at driving as you wish to be at cubing.

   Driving well demands precision, timing, and looking ahead just as
speedcubing does. 

   Encouraging others to duplicate your stupidity is irresponsible.

   I&#x27;m very dissapointed with you Jake.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   The new cubes from Seven Towns have the archer-underside center
&quot;cubies&quot; and they virtually never pop apart. They are thinking about
selling them with screws instead of rivets.

   Studio cubes have flat undersides to the center &quot;cubies&quot; which is
why they spit edge pieces out the side, and they have a very small
&quot;sweet spot&quot; for adjusting.

   The best for adjusting and not popping is the old Deluxe cube (and
the Deluxe cube with peg holes used in Rubik&#x27;s Game). The plastic is
slick, the tiles are great the, centers are arched, and they are one
and a half to two and a half seconds faster for a 25 second solve. The
sweet spot is wider. You can adjust the Deluxe far looser without it
popping than you can a Studio cube.

   You can see Macky speedsolving using an *unlubed* Deluxe in the
last video Tyson versus Macky at the January Caltech tournament:
http://www.henage.net/dan/cube/

   He was accidently given the same scramble twice, but he solved it
differently the second time.

Regards,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">On my studio cube, the tension is almost as tight as it can get and 
it still turns easily. The problem is most likely to do with the 
centers themselves. I sanded the threads off my screws with made it 
turn much better(but also illegal in competion). I have been 
wondering about how spring tension affects a cubes performance. My 
old studio cube pops a lot and I blame it on the springs losing 
their tension but I&#x27;m not really sure. Any thoughts on this?

I have the opposite problem as ChrisH and find non studio cubes hard 
to get adjusted right because the tension is so uneven. Is there any 
way to fix this? I bought a new cube yesterday with the arched 
centers because I heard they were good and I&#x27;m breaking it in now. 
The plastic seems slicker and the center kernel was black. I&#x27;ve 
never seen this before and also there was a number printed on one of 
the corner caps. Anyway it does seem to have potential to be a good 
speedcube. Now if it only had screws, vinyl stickers w/ bright 
orange, and no logo(or the old style ideal one is okay) i&#x27;d be in 
happy. I&#x27;ve never tried a rubiksdotcom cube.

About lubing: right after a cubeis lubed it is at its best and 
slowly gets worse but after a week or two it seems to get better 
again because the cube dust is acting as a dry lubricant but it is 
not quite as good as a freshly lubed cube - just my observations.

great, without lubricatin, it&#x27;s a pretty darn slick speedcube with <br>
the right amount of resistance.<br>
Use 120 sandpaper, then finish with 300, but, all you need to do is <br>
save the &quot;cube dust&quot; [debris] and pour it back into the cube when <br>
you&#x27;re assembling it. Just pour it back in before the last layer is <br>
assembled, and do a quick solve to spread the &quot;cube dust&quot;. It&#x27;s <br>
almost better than silicone (atleast on my cube) Happy speedcubing;<br>

          <div class="email-content">Really great program!  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it and would 
just like to comment that turning the faces is very smooth and 
responsive and easy to go fast.

The only tip I can think of is to have an option for turning on a 
mirror so you can see the back bottom and left faces of the layer  
internal layer you&#x27;re looking at.  It&#x27;s hard to turn the cube around 
a lot for the last layers to see where the stickers are.

I really like the program!  Got the 4x4x4 super-supercube in 8:22 
with 288 moves.  Next the 7x7x7 :) :) :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone.  I know I mentioned my supercube solution earlier, and <br>
I just wanted to say that I finally finished it!  I had some trouble <br>
proving the possible cases that could come up with the last center <br>
after the first 5 are solved perfectly, but I finally figured it <br>
out.  For those interested in the math I was able to represent the <br>
center parities as an abelian group that has the same number of <br>
elements as possible combinations of odd parity edge orbital <br>
combinations.  I&#x27;ll go into more detail on the page, but basically I <br>
show that certain subgroups of the centers must have the same parity <br>
as certain subgroups of the edges, so there&#x27;s a method to fixing the <br>
last center.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m going to start typing up the solution into a webpage with <br>
diagrams and all.  I have no idea how long this will take, but I <br>
wanted to let anyone who was interested know that I am working on it.<br>
<br>
I want to try to make this page somewhat rigorous, but I&#x27;m only in <br>
an introductory group theory class, so we&#x27;ll see how this goes.  <br>
Either way, using this page you&#x27;ll be able to solve any NxNxN <br>
supercube from any scrambled position (assuming it is solvable of <br>
course :)  I&#x27;ll start digging into necessary conditions for <br>
solvability too, and I&#x27;ll put that on the page.<br>
<br>
Yay!!!  I just wanted to let everyone know since I was so happy to <br>
finally finish my solution :)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll post a link once I get a fair amount of the solution done so I <br>
can get some feedback about the format/clarity and all that.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

Ton who supplies the studio cubes has an &quot;official&quot; solution to 
fixing some of the problems with the studio cubes. There are 2 things 
that will help a lot.

1. The springs should be grinded at both sides to decrease friction 
on rotation. This reduces &quot;unscrewing&quot; also.

2. Apply some superglue to the tips of the screws. Insert the screws 
when the glue is semi-dry. And don&#x27;t use too much of it ;-)

Other illegal (??) things to do:

- is to grind down the grooves of the part of the screws not inside 
the center spindle

- careful sanding of &quot;rough spots&quot; on each of the cubicles, be very 
careful with this, only do it when the turning is stiff since popping 
might occur more easily

And finally silicone, grease free :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,
 
There are many ways to compress the springs. Here are some options:
 
Sqeeze it with your finger (not recommended)
Use a electric wire clipper (what I did)
Use weights or something heavy and put it over the springs over night (my friend did that)
 
 
OR
 
another thing that you can do is get some smalled springs that are all the same and replace the old springs.
 
hope that helps~
 
~Joseph
btw, If you use  Cube Lube with some SNAP silicone spray and Tempo Silicone Spray, then your Studio Cube can be lubricated longer.

I disagree - if that were the case why bother to post it in the 
first place. There may be people who are suggestible enough to try 
to replicate such a stunt so the post itself is irresponsible and 
the disclaimer at the front is no excuse for the post.

My friend and I have an idea. The idea is basically taking all the good stuff from Chrome/Metal Cube, Oddzon, Studio, and Tiled Cubes (Mefferts) and putting them all together to make a crazy good cube. Here is our outline:
 
>From Oddzon:

Now here is how we&#x27;ll use each part:
 
Drill a screw holder into the metal axis and insert the arched inside with the screw and spring from the Studio Cube. Right after that, we&#x27;re going to put some silicone gel between the metal axis and the screws. Each of the center caps will be protected by the Metal Holder. Next, we will adjust the tensions and make the cubies. The cubies will also be surrounded by the metal cubie holder from the Metal Cube. Then after that, we&#x27;ll insert each cubie with a tile. And the cube should be pretty slick (of course with some lubrication). I&#x27;ll post up the results when we&#x27;re done making it.

          <div class="email-content">I have a couple mefferts cubes, and i noticed that its a really nice 
cube, all it needs is springs.  this might mean a different kernel, 
or perhaps there is a way to add them to the existing one.  it 
already has the arched centers and the tiles so i think that the 
springs is all that its lacking.  ill look into this, and if i can 
make any improvements on the mefferts cube i&#x27;ll post them.  

and would anyone know if/where i can buy kernels?

thanks,
Evan

          <div class="email-content">THANKS!<br>
<br>
Thanks guys for confirming the stupidity of the event.  I know what i <br>
did was reckless, but nonetheless i have a decent head on my <br>
shoulders.  I examined the situation, i took the precaution so i <br>
wouldnt be in danger, and that no one else would be in danger.  <br>
Notice i did not include a solving time.  THis was a lengthy process <br>
waiting for an empty road, pleasent driving conditions, and so forth. <br>
I solved the cube from periferal view (sorry for spelling), keeping <br>
both eyes on the road.  If any case of danger i can drop my cube and <br>
grab the wheel.  <br>
COnsidering the above this makes the event far less dangerous than it <br>
was cracked up to be. <br>
<br>
MY STATE OF MIND!<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, I do not incourage anybody to try and recreate or <br>
attempt to break this personal record of mine.  THis was a personal <br>
goal of mine and i put lots of thought into this before actually <br>
attempting this, (hence the above precautions).  I admit, my previous <br>
post was meant to make me sound crazy and weird and stupid.  I am <br>
sorry, i don&#x27;t like to make myself sound great and smart and <br>
important like some people do, and so i humiliate myself into <br>
a &quot;dumb&quot; state.  <br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then you&#x27;re an idiot and you really should be<br>
&gt; &gt; certified. Get <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself to an asylum and seek treatment.<br>
<br>
Expanding on this, I am sorry i mislead all of you into thinking i am <br>
some horrible obsessed and partialy insane person.  SUre i have made <br>
lots of odd posts about bizzare dreams and weird ideas.  I&#x27;m not <br>
sorry for being creative.  I am not sorry for sharing my opinions and <br>
my personal experiences.  I am just trying to be open minded and <br>
bringing new and fresh ideas to the cubing community.  <br>
<br>
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES<br>
<br>
THis event was not an idea meant for the cubing community.  I should <br>
have expressed that this was a personal goal.  I just thought that <br>
sharing our own experiences is what makes this hobby an interesting <br>
one.  I also feel that sharing experiences helps make you grow as a <br>
person and a friend.<br>
<br>
MY DISSAPOINTMENTS AND SEMI FINAL THOUGHTS!<br>
<br>
I am also really dissapointed in this group.  Over the past year <br>
there has been lots of arguing and nagging and spiteful comments <br>
about other members of the group.  I find it very distasteful now, <br>
and it may even stray newer members from the group.  I am on the <br>
brink of leaving the group because i am sick of the negativity.<br>
I am also very offended that i need to include disclosures to my <br>
posts, because several of you will complain about it or say that i am <br>
encouraging others to try what i am doing.  I flat out said that it <br>
was a dumb thing to do!  That it was reckless and stupid.  I said <br>
that because it is RECKLESS AND STUPID!  Those of you who fail to see <br>
this then is pretty blind, all you have to do is read.  There is <br>
nothing hidden in this message that encourages others to try and <br>
fulfill what i did.  <br>
<br>
FINAL DISCLOSURE:<br>
<br>
To those who think that what i did was COOL and Totally awesome, it <br>
is not.  It is extremly dangerous!  Nobody should consider trying <br>
this event!  <br>
If you are deadset on trying this event, i urge you not to with all <br>
of my heart!<br>
It is risky and you are not only putting yourself in danger, but you <br>
may even be putting others in danger.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Jake,

   I like your flights of fancy, and I wish you were not offended.

> I am also very offended that i need to include disclosures to my
posts, because several of you will complain about it or say that i am
encouraging others to try what i am doing. &lt;

   That you were not encouraging others was not clear at all, and
still isn&#x27;t. 

> I flat out said that it

that because it is RECKLESS AND STUPID! Those of you who fail to see

   I read pretty well.  

   You have to do more than just write, you need some good judgement.
Have you any idea how many people were injured trying &quot;jackass&quot; type
stunts in spite of &quot;disclaimers?&quot; For some people such disclaimers are
an invitation.

>There is nothing hidden in this message that encourages others to try
and fulfill what i did

   Maybe you didn&#x27;t mean it that way, but there is an invitation: you
posted your stunt as bragging - hence cool.

   You wrote, > I examined the situation, i took the precaution so i
wouldnt be in danger, and that no one else would be in danger &lt;
   
   Oh, how carefully you defend your doing something reckless and
stupid by labeling your act as carefully thought out. Here your own
words belie you &quot;disclaimer.&quot;  

   You wrote, > THis event was not an idea meant for the cubing
community. &lt;

   Then you should have kept it to yourself. The idea of solving while
driving came up before and the consensus of opinion at that time was
very clearly on the side of *don&#x27;t do it.*

   Regards,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">Today I got around to trying the 7x7x7 super-supercube.  All I have 
to say was that it was totally awesome!  I&#x27;m also excited that 
solving the last center on the 7x7x7 supercube part in the end 
worked out exactly like I was expecting, which is a comfort and I&#x27;m 
now really excited on putting my NxNxN supercube solution up for 
everyone.

For those of you who like big cubes and/or supercubes I highly 
recommend trying out Per&#x27;s new program, it is very cool!

I managed the 7x7x7 super-supercube in 2 hours 4 minutes 56 seconds 
with 2129 moves.  Any challengers for some friendly competition?  
Perhaps we could add this category to the records page if enough 
people get interested in trying this.

Anyway, I just wanted to take another moment to advocate super 
cubing, and super-supercubing which is a unique and interesting form 
of supercubing.  Try it, it&#x27;s fun!

Chris

   If this were true your argument might hold water. At what age are
humans able to determine for themselves what is safe and what is not?

   I really wish that you guys would notice that this is a public
board and realise that children may read what you write?

Well, there is clearly a huge amount of evidence to the contrary.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

It&#x27;s grest that someone (and hopefully more) take the time to check 
out my new CubixPlayer2 for super-supercubing. As Chris says it&#x27;s 
great fun! Thats why i made it ... lol ... I haven&#x27;t yet done the 
7x7x7 myself cause i&#x27;m busy coding it ;-) It is not trivial to code 
all the slice moves once the size of the cube is dynamic. And it 
also took quite some time to figure out how i was gonna show the 
internals of the cube, which u HAVE to see if super-supercubing 
shall make any sense :D

Features to come in next release are :

- Time stops when it&#x27;s solved
- Indicators to show whether the cube is solved / supersolved / 
supersupersolved (supersolved is for supercubing, supersupersolved 
is for super-supercubing ...)
- Hiscore list
- Option of 3 different playermodes
- Option to see the 3 other sides of the cube (somehow)
- Possibly share ur scores when u play online !!!

So watch out for the next release in some weeks ;-)

Happy Easter all !!!

-Per

PS! Drag slices of the cube with left mousebutton. Drag the WHOLE 
cube with the right mousebutton. I better put those instructions in 
the GUI somewhere :D

Maybe this is a stupid question, but... Where can I download it? I

that he KNOWS how stupid, insane, and dangerous this stunt was. So 
therefore, he is old enough to know the difference.

          <div class="email-content">Fine, perhaps this was irresponsible of me for posting this.  Fine, examine <br>
everything i write and and spit it back in my face and into other peoples faces.  <br>
<br>
But where do we draw the line?  Where can we draw the line?  Look at some <br>
of the crazy records set on speedcubing.com.  Sky diving, underwater, <br>
unicycling, and even cubing while you are drunk.  All of these have an eliment <br>
of danger to it.  Each person participating in the act of these events are putting <br>
themselves at some sort of risk, some more dangerous than others.   What is <br>
so different than mine?<br>
<br>
I am not trying to deface these records, because i find them very interesting.  I <br>
am glad that these records are allowed to be posted for the public to view.  I <br>
would also like these records to stay on speedcubing.com.  <br>
<br>
Childeren who are reading these posts have easier access to alcohol and a <br>
swimming pool or bathtub,  than a car.  <br>
<br>
People who have a car know the dangers of driving.<br>
<br>
Please do not relate this to Jackass.  This is not a jackass stunt.  These guys <br>
purposely inflict pain on themselves for entertainment.  There is a difference.<br>
Plus i hate Jackass.<br>
<br>
Again, I am not trying to provoke people to try anything dangerous.  If they <br>
take it as i am, then they are the stupid ones.  <br>
<br>
Finally, I hope that people in the future cube responsibly and make sure that if <br>
they do try anything dangerous to make sure:<br>
<br>
1.  The situation has been well examined before hand.<br>
<br>
2. Eliminate potential risks <br>
<br>
3. Take many safety precautions<br>
<br>
4. Don&#x27;t kill yourself<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">I found a way to fix up studio cubes that looks promising.  I&#x27;ve 
recently tried fixing my cube up like this, based on how I saw 
people doing it at the WC.  Basically what I do is to tune the 
screws pretty tightly.  Without lube your cube should be fairly hard 
to turn and the times you get should be well above your normal 
average.  When you do want to take an average for speed, lube your 
cube with silicone about 30 minutes beforehand.  Use a LOT.  You 
have to work the cube through the entire tight phase while the 
silicone is drying.  Once it does start to loosen up a little again 
wait until 30 minutes or so have passed since you sprayed the lube 
in and have a go at your average.  I&#x27;m getting averages under my 
average average and getting lots of very fast single times trying 
this.

The downside is that you have to lube your cube quite literally 
every day.  However the cube is very stable (does not pop often) and 
still very very smooth, so you get good fast times.

Just a suggestion for those like me who are having trouble figuring 
out the studio cube.  Perhaps the masters *ahem* Ron, DanK, David 
W., Jessica, Ton etc.. can give some pointers for working on the 
studio cubes in order to make them fast?

Hi Per K,

I just tried your super-super-cube player!

First I did the 3x3x3 just to get used to it (I actually have a much 
harder time visualing cubes on a screen than when they are in my own 
two hands)

then I tried my luck at super-super-cubing the 4x4x4.  It took a 
little getting used to but I was successful.  How appropriate that 
the final alg I used to solve the cube was one that I learned from 
you!  (The alg to rotate one centerpiece 180 on 3x3x3 spercube - 
obviously adapted to move one center quartet 180 on a super-super-
cube.)

Thanks for the new toy!
I&#x27;ll try the 5x5x5 next!

Rob

safely, and lots of drivers know safety yet dont practise it, some 
drivers are totally reckless, and some are smart enough to not get

they come up more often as Rubik&#x27;s Game and Rubik&#x27;s Challenge.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,
 
Well, I found a solution for making a Studio Cube lubed for a week or two. It may require some chemistry though. Here are the materials needed
 
Official Hessport&#x27;s Cube Lube
Thick Silicone Wax (car wax that are silicone based are great also)
Silicone Spray  (SNAP, but Tempo might work)
And an empty tube of cube lube
Coffee Stirrer
 
Instructions:
 
Put some cube lube (about 10 drops will do)+Silicone Wax (1.5 teaspoon)+Silicone Spray (about 5 sprays, be sure to use the straw so you don&#x27;t spread the silicone) all into the empty tube of cube lube. Alright, if you people don&#x27;t know how to use an empty tube, let me teach how now, the place where you press down the injection area, put it upward and the whole thing should come off (only do it if it&#x27;s empty)! When everything is added, you the coffee stirrer and mix the things together (but not until it&#x27;s bubbly). It would look like semi think white liquid.
 
When you&#x27;re putting this homemade cube lube into your cube, just take out an edge piece and put a few drops in (about 7 for non lubed cubes) and play with it so that the lube will spread. Let it chill over night and there will a really thin layer of wax/silicone inside your cube. It&#x27;ll keep your cube lubed and not poppy. Btw, this lube is good for any type of 3x3x3, but don&#x27;t use it on any other puzzles!
 
~Hope That Helps

I found a way to fix up studio cubes that looks promising.  I&#x27;ve 
recently tried fixing my cube up like this, based on how I saw 
people doing it at the WC.  Basically what I do is to tune the 
screws pretty tightly.  Without lube your cube should be fairly hard 
to turn and the times you get should be well above your normal 
average.  When you do want to take an average for speed, lube your 
cube with silicone about 30 minutes beforehand.  Use a LOT.  You 
have to work the cube through the entire tight phase while the 
silicone is drying.  Once it does start to loosen up a little again 
wait until 30 minutes or so have passed since you sprayed the lube 
in and have a go at your average.  I&#x27;m getting averages under my 
average average and getting lots of very fast single times trying 
this.

The downside is that you have to lube your cube quite literally 
every day.  However the cube is very stable (does not pop often) and 
still very very smooth, so you get good fast times.

Just a suggestion for those like me who are having trouble figuring 
out the studio cube.  Perhaps the masters *ahem* Ron, DanK, David 
W., Jessica, Ton etc.. can give some pointers for working on the 
studio cubes in order to make them fast?

          <div class="email-content">I havent seen this one on the Rubiks.com site yet but i found this <br>
in a games store last week.  It is a Rubiks brand checkers game and <br>
it is just like checkers except you start with kings.  I forgot the <br>
box at my apt, so i cant give a specific title.  But it is fun!  The <br>
games can get quite long because there are some special rules that i <br>
wont get into.  Its pretty cool though.  <br>

   The come up occassionally on ebay. If you don&#x27;t mind the peg holes
they come up more often as Rubik&#x27;s Game and Rubik&#x27;s Challenge.

<br>
&gt; There are many ways to compress the springs. Here are some options:<br>
<br>
I tried it by sqeezing it tight between a screw and its nut. After <br>
24 hours I claim it hasn&#x27;t changed at all. It&#x27;s still pretty much <br>
exactly 1cm long. I had compressed it to 5mm. Is there something I&#x27;m <br>
missing or do you maybe have different screws? How long are yours <br>
before/after compression? ChrisH, how about yours?<br>
<br>
&gt; btw, If you use  Cube Lube with some SNAP silicone spray and Tempo <br>
Silicone Spray, then your Studio Cube can be lubricated longer. <br>
<br>
I&#x27;d love to get SNAP, but I haven&#x27;t seen it here in Germany... :-)<br>

You might not be able to find SNAP (my local hardware store didn&#x27;t carry it), but silicone lubricants are used for A LOT of different things, so I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be able to find it in any hardware store of decent size.  The brand I found is called Krylon, and it works great.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,
 
Sorry, I didn&#x27;t explain the process thoroughlly. Anyways, you use one of those electric wire clipper thingis (sorry, I forgot what it&#x27;s called, I think nose plier or something?) and keep it there over night, and you may be asking how to keep it there, the answer to that is using a clamper and squeezing the clipper with the clamper and it will keep it in place over night. After that, the next day, it&#x27;ll get smaller, then you use some weights (I used 50 lbs. weights for compressing) and compress is over night the next day. Then your springs will loosen up and it&#x27;ll become smaller. Hope that&#x27;ll explain it more detailedly~
 
Btw, the issue about the Silicone Spray, any silicone spray that&#x27;ll work pretty well on any new cubes are fine. It is best if you use Official Hessport&#x27;s Cube Lube, mixed with silicone spray and silicone wax (look at the post that I posted before on making home made lubrication), and it&#x27;ll be lubed for about 2 weeks.

has to be easier and more exact to buy new springs of the size and <br>
exact springiness you require.<br>

Last I checked you could get them at a hardware store for less than a <br>
cent each. That was over 20 years ago in Sweden, so I can&#x27;t promise <br>
anything about where you are now.<br>

Last I checked you could get them at a hardware store for less than a

anything about where you are now.

          <div class="email-content">I haven&#x27;t been able to access the forum for 3
weeks+...And I&#x27;m not going to take a side, so I hope
it&#x27;s alright that I make a post in regards to &quot;Jake&#x27;s
choice&quot;.  (I know there was an official last post,
just pretend this post is from tuesday or something) 

Generally all choices we make as a person, effect
people.  Jacob effected the people around him in two
ways:
1. He did, without a doubt, risk his own life, and
possibly the lives of others.  I think his choice was
a poor one.  Especially because we don&#x27;t need to give
people the connection between cubing and death :P  

2. Posting on the forum.  It&#x27;s questionable as to
whether or not Jake should have posted his &#x27;daring
attempt&#x27;.  At the same time, look at media today and
its effect on people.  There is far worse out there
for children and adults to see! Open a newspaper, and
you&#x27;ll see its true.  

Think about your favorite action movie.  It is
probable that there is a stunt man doing dangerous
things.  Things that are sometimes so dangerous that
it endanger&#x27;s their lives.  

I&#x27;m sorry to continue rambling.  I&#x27;m also sorry to
anyone who is angry at my post.  (but I feel I have a
right to an opinion on the forum.  

In all of this, what it all boils down to is one
simple idea.  In a world of chaos and twisted ideas,
there are going to be two kinds of people.  Those who
are going to take an idea and run with it.  And those
who are able to judge the difference between right and
wrong.  I think anyone who is going to speed while
solving a cube (because they read on a forum that jake
did) is just as likely to try dodging bullets because
they saw it in the Matrix.  With that said, it isn&#x27;t
the idea that twists the person, it&#x27;s their mentality.
 &quot;&quot;Guns don&#x27;t kill people; people kill people&quot;&quot; 
so...driving 80mph while solving the cube=
stupid...posting on the forum=fine, it was cube
related *shrugs*   

And in regards to the &quot;let there be peace please&quot;  I
think it&#x27;s possible to debate over a real-live issue
without jeopardizing the respect of others.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, I just proved a really interesting result, and I was <br>
excited and wanted to post!  I&#x27;m going to run my proof by my <br>
professor and make sure I have done it right, but from checking over <br>
it, it looks correct to me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here&#x27;s the result but first let me define some terms I&#x27;ll be <br>
using.<br>
<br>
Take any NxNxN supercube (if the cube is odd, ignore the orientation <br>
of the central most center).  There are floor[(N-1)/2] center <br>
piece &quot;orbitals&quot; on the NxNxN cube.  &quot;floor&quot; is the floor function, <br>
meaning take the greatest integer that is less than the result (n-<br>
1)/2 for the value N of the cube.  An &quot;orbital&quot; of the centers are <br>
the 24 positions a certain type of center piece is allowed to occupy <br>
on the cube.  On the 4x4x4 there is only 1 center orbital, meaning <br>
all the center pieces can occupy the position of any other center <br>
piece.  The 5x5x5 has 2 center orbitals.  These two orbitals are the <br>
centers lying at the corners of the 3x3 grid that makes up the <br>
centers on a face, and the centers that lie on the sides <br>
(so &quot;corner&quot; and &quot;middle&quot; centers).  There are floor[(N-1)/2] center <br>
orbitals on any NxNxN cube.<br>
<br>
Ok now to the cool part.  So turning an outer face 4 cycles the <br>
centers in all floor[(N-1)/2] center orbitals, chaning their parity <br>
from odd to even or vice versa.  Turning an inner slice changes the <br>
parity of certain sets of the center pieces as well.  Anyway <br>
explaining exactly how it changes the center parities when you turn <br>
multiple inner slices is a little too much to explain in a short <br>
space, and it would be a lot easier to use diagrams so I&#x27;ll just cut <br>
to the chase for this post.  I will add all this into my online <br>
solution though.<br>
<br>
I was able to prove that all the centers on an NxNxN cube (ignoring <br>
the orientation of the central most center on any odd NxNxN cube) <br>
taken as a permutation group is isomorphic to the external product <br>
of the integers mod 2 (with addition as the binary operator) on <br>
itself ceiling[(N-1)/2] times.  The centers on any odd cube form an <br>
abelian group so decomposing them into products of the integers mod <br>
a prime number is allowable.<br>
<br>
So for example the centers on a 4x4x4 cube (in terms of parity based <br>
on the different types of moves) is isomorphic to the direct product <br>
of the group of integers mod 2 (with addition) with the group of <br>
integers mod 2 (with addition).<br>
<br>
The centers on a 6x6x6 cube is isomorphic to the direct product of <br>
the group of integers mod 2 (with addition) with the group of <br>
integers mod 2 (with addition) wth the group of integers mod 2 (with <br>
addition).<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know how to draw the integer symbol on the internet, but <br>
let&#x27;s say that &quot;Z(2)&quot; stands for the group of integers mod 2 with <br>
addition as the binary operation, and &quot;x&quot; means the direct product <br>
of two groups.  Then the 4x4x4 cube centers as a group are <br>
isomorphic to Z(2) x Z(2).  The centers on a 6x6x6 cube as a group <br>
are isomorphic to the group Z(2) x Z(2) x Z(2).<br>
<br>
And so on for all NxNxN cubes, including cubes of odd degree.  So <br>
the group of centers on a 7x7x7 cube is isomorphic to Z(2) x Z(2) x Z<br>
(2).<br>
<br>
This has another interesting consequence, which is somewhat obvious <br>
when comparing the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5.  In terms of parities of all the <br>
center pieces, even cubes are essentially the exact same thing as <br>
the odd cube with one more piece on each side.  So the 4x4x4 is <br>
essentially the same as the 5x5x5 if you&#x27;re only talking about the <br>
center parities.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m going to run my proof by my professor and see what he <br>
says, and hopefully it will hold up under rigorous scrutiny :)  If <br>
it does I&#x27;ll put this result in my NxNxN supercube solutions as well.<br>
<br>
Yay!!!  Cube math rules!!!<br>

This should read &quot;The centers on any NxNxN cube&quot; and not &quot;The 
centers on any odd cube&quot;

I was typing fast and missed that.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

By super-supercubing it is meant that not only do u orient/cycle the 
facecenters correctly, but in addition you must solve all the 
internals of the cube. To see the internals of the cube you must use 
explode and or transparent to respectively explode the cube 
or &quot;remove&quot; some of the outer &quot;shells&quot; of the cube. I am still 
pondering how to improve the visualisation and navigation of these 
super-supercubes. Not to sound too patronising, but super-
supercubing might not be for each and everyone. It is surely an 
acquired taste and quite unique :D I made it to please myself but i 
am of course very happy if someone else should like it also ;-)

-Per-

PS! If u find it hard to navigate computer cubes u only need more 
practice i think. And optimize the colors the way u like them. 
Saving colors will be added for next release (i can almost promise 
that :-) ...) U drag the slices of the cube with the left 
mousebutton, turn the whole cube around with the right mousebutton. 
How that works should be easy to deduce :-)

the &quot;methods&quot; I know of are olly&#x27;s cycles and Dr.C&#x27;s simple and 
advanced methods. And you can choose your own algs.
Where have you seen lot&#x27;s of methods?
Which methods you want to compare?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone.  I&#x27;m speaking for myself here, but I&#x27;m sure a lot of <br>
others would also agree.  Is there a way that the RCC can define a <br>
set of official rules so that there can be computer cubing at <br>
Official Rubik&#x27;s cube competitions?  There are a number of people <br>
who practice computer cubing fairly regularly, me being one of them, <br>
and I would love a chance to see something like a 7x7x7 timed cube <br>
competition.<br>
<br>
I can of a few issues that would need to be resolved in order to do <br>
this:<br>
<br>
1) Program used:  There are a number of programs that already exist <br>
to solve larger cubes, but for a competition should we standarize <br>
the program and see who is faster on that particularly program?  I <br>
think it would be better to standarize the possible features <br>
allowed, and let people make their own programs or use an existing <br>
program.  This introduces the possibility of &quot;back doors&quot; where <br>
people could program Macros or things into their program.  So <br>
perhaps it would be better to standardize the program and have <br>
someone the RCC recognizes as an official programer to write the <br>
program that we use for official computer cubing.  Seven Towns could <br>
market this program and sell it to competitors as well, so that we <br>
can practice on the &quot;official&quot; program at home.<br>
<br>
2) Features used on a program:  The first thing that comes to mind <br>
is the extra visibility that some programs have.  Some programs have <br>
an actual 2D representation of a 3D cube, so you can&#x27;t see the back <br>
three faces.  David Barr&#x27;s applet stretches the cube so that you can <br>
see all 6 faces at once, but the cube does not appear to be cube <br>
shaped unless you have some experience working with that program.  <br>
An official program would need to be either one or the other.<br>
<br>
i) Macros surely cannot be allowed in any way, shape, or form.  You <br>
must turn all faces by click dragging.  I think this should be a set <br>
feautre no matter what program.  Faces are pulled by click-and-drag <br>
for two adjacent squares.<br>
<br>
3) Amount of time required:  I myself would love to compete on the <br>
11x11x11 or even 20x20x20 cube, but I also practice lots of other <br>
puzzles and will be most likely to compete in several events at a <br>
competition.  So computer cubing would most likely have to run at <br>
the same time as the rest of the RCC recognized events.  Should a <br>
competitor miss another scheduled event that they would like to <br>
compete in, they will be disqualified by the current rules.  This is <br>
an issue that would have to be worked out somehow.<br>
<br>
4) Equipment: Where will we get the computers to use?  Will <br>
competitors be allowed to use their own computers?  This makes it <br>
possible to cheat by using your own program disguised to appear to <br>
function like the normal programs.  If we have an official program, <br>
then the programs could try to make it secure with a judges log-in <br>
or something similar.  This also means people with faster or better <br>
computers might have an advantage.  If the competitors are not <br>
allowed to use their own computers, does the competition organizer <br>
have to supply them?  This would cost money, but we might be able to <br>
get some sort of bulk discount.  Also competitors competing in <br>
computer cubing events could be charged a fee for competing that <br>
event to help pay for the computers.  I would pay such a fee to <br>
compete on a computer cube.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
These are just a few ideas I had about problems of implementing a <br>
computer cubing event.  However, I think if enough people are <br>
interested, that we can work around these problems.  Perhaps we can <br>
introduce only 6x6x6 and 7x7x7 cubing as official sanctioned events, <br>
but competitors may also choose to attempt a larger cube.  This <br>
could be setup so that if you successfully complete a larger cube <br>
you are recognized as the champion for that size cube (or some other <br>
type of prize).  We could give a prize for the largest solved cube <br>
in a given time period, say 24 hours.  This would limit the size to <br>
no more than 30x0 ro 40x40 assuming someone was only coming for the <br>
computer cubing category and did nothing but the largest size cube <br>
they could successfully complete in the given time.<br>
<br>
I do not mean to sound arrogant or patronizing, but it seems most of <br>
the people who would compete in the 6x6x6 or 7x7x7 category would be <br>
able to solve each type of cube (separately) in 30 minutes or less.  <br>
So if each competitor had a computer, or if half the competitors <br>
could be on a computer at once, then the entire 6x6x6 and 7x7x7 <br>
events together could be completed in 2 hours or less.<br>
<br>
If I may, I&#x27;d like to let this message be a petition from interested <br>
computer cubers who would like the RCC to consider forming official <br>
rules for competitive NxNxN cube solving.  If anyone else is <br>
interested, please reply to this message so that Dave Jones and <br>
others can see that there are those of us interested, and that this <br>
would not be a waste of their time.<br>
<br>
&gt;From what I&#x27;ve seen, there are enough people who practice big cubes <br>
that we should at the very least define official rules and allow <br>
record attempts on certain sizes, say the 6x6x6 and the 7x7x7.  This <br>
would give us a record for an even cube and an odd cube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Joseph,<br>
<br>
sorry, I still don&#x27;t understand (see below)...<br>
<br>
&gt; Anyways, you use one of those electric wire clipper thingis <br>
(sorry, I forgot what it&#x27;s called, I think nose plier or something?) <br>
and keep it there over night,<br>
<br>
What exactly should I do with it? Do you do something special? Why <br>
do you use this one night and the the weights another night? Are <br>
they for different purposes?<br>
<br>
&gt; After that, the next day, it&#x27;ll get smaller, then you use some <br>
weights (I used 50 lbs. weights for compressing) and compress is <br>
over night the next day. Then your springs will loosen up and it&#x27;ll <br>
become smaller.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure I made clear what I&#x27;ve done myself. Using the screw and <br>
it&#x27;s nut I compressed the screw *as much as possible* (from 10mm to <br>
5mm). It was completely compressed. Compressing it is not the <br>
problem. Problem is when I let loose it just jumps back to 10mm, <br>
even after 24 hours of maximum compression.<br>
<br>
&gt; Btw, the issue about the Silicone Spray, any silicone spray <br>
that&#x27;ll work pretty well on any new cubes are fine.<br>
<br>
Thanks, I already got some, but I&#x27;ve heard from several people that <br>
the SNAP one is so great...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve thought about this recently as well (but for more practical <br>
purposes, blindsolving the 5x5 ;-)<br>
<br>
But I have a little trouble understanding what you mean (see <br>
below)...<br>
<br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t know how to draw the integer symbol on the internet, but <br>
&gt; let&#x27;s say that &quot;Z(2)&quot; stands for the group of integers mod 2 with <br>
&gt; addition as the binary operation, and &quot;x&quot; means the direct product <br>
&gt; of two groups.  Then the 4x4x4 cube centers as a group are <br>
&gt; isomorphic to Z(2) x Z(2).  The centers on a 6x6x6 cube as a group <br>
&gt; are isomorphic to the group Z(2) x Z(2) x Z(2).<br>
<br>
My first problem is just the size. If they&#x27;re isomorphic, they <br>
should have the same size, I think, but Z(2)^3 has only 8 elements, <br>
whereas the 6x6 centers have many more states.<br>
<br>
If you mean the center parities alone (not the whole permutation), <br>
then there seems to be another problem. Let&#x27;s look at the face of a <br>
7x7:<br>
<br>
.......<br>
..O.X..<br>
.X...O.<br>
.......<br>
.O...X.<br>
..X.O..<br>
.......<br>
<br>
The X&#x27;s are in the same orbit and the O&#x27;s are in another orbit. I <br>
claim these two orbits will *always* have the same parity. The <br>
general Z(2)^n group doesn&#x27;t have a property like this. The problem <br>
exists for any cube of size 6 or larger and there are probably some <br>
other dependencies as well.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

<br>

There isn&#x27;t any extra purpose for those two steps, it is just for making the springs shorter so that it&#x27;ll be less springy and smaller. I didn&#x27;t do anything special. I&#x27;ll do what I did before and do it to my cousin&#x27;s studio cube and see if it is the same results~

          <div class="email-content">I have thought of this before and I think it would have a definate 
advantage over a stickered cube and also there would be no stickers 
to peel. I&#x27;ve been hearing all positive comments about them recently 
and now I want one too. I don&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t be allowed in 
competion-they are official rubik&#x27;s brand cubes. Another idea (i 
think someone mentioned it a while ago) would be to switch stripes 
of color of adjacent stickers on an edge of a cubie. Kind of like 
your supercube design. Do you know what I mean? Anyway, I doubt that 
would be allowed in competition.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; My first problem is just the size. If they&#x27;re isomorphic, they <br>
&gt; should have the same size, I think, but Z(2)^3 has only 8 <br>
elements, <br>
&gt; whereas the 6x6 centers have many more states.<br>
<br>
Sorry that it was unclear.  I typed that first post fairly quickly <br>
and I left many mistakes.  What I should have said is that the <br>
parities of the centers and the parity of the edges all taken <br>
together, and not all the possible permutations of the centers.  I <br>
mean only the 8 different possible states of the center and edge <br>
parities, not all their possible permutations of each piece.<br>
<br>
Here was my thinking.  I claim that the parity of the centers and <br>
edges on a 4x4x4 taken together is isomorphic to Z(2) x Z(2).  Z(2) <br>
x Z(2) has 4 elements.  It is clear that all the centers on a 4x4x4 <br>
are in the same orbital, so the parity of that one center orbital is <br>
either even or odd.  To come up with the other two elements in my <br>
4x4x4 parity group you have to take into account the parity of the <br>
edges too.  The edges are all in the same orbital, so the parity of <br>
that orbital is either even or odd.  I claim all combinations of <br>
parities are possible.<br>
<br>
1) Centers are even, edges are odd: do a quarter turn on any inner <br>
slice from a solved supercube<br>
2) Centers are odd, edges are odd: do a quarter turn on any outer <br>
face and then do a quarter turn on any inner slice from a solved <br>
supercube.  OR vice versa.  Both achieve the same result (this is <br>
because the group is abelian).<br>
3) Centers are even, edges are even: a solved supercube<br>
4) Centers are odd, edges are even: do a quarter turn on any outer <br>
slice from a solved supercube.<br>
<br>
So Z(2)^2 and the group of parities of the centers and edges of the <br>
4x4x4 both have 4 elements.  Also every element in both groups has <br>
order 2.  If you do any of the above 4 cases twice, then the <br>
parities of all center and edge orbitals (here only 1 of each type) <br>
returns to its original state i.e. you have done the identity <br>
permutation on the parities).<br>
<br>
&gt; If you mean the center parities alone (not the whole permutation), <br>
&gt; then there seems to be another problem. Let&#x27;s look at the face of <br>
a <br>
&gt; 7x7:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; .......<br>
&gt; ..O.X..<br>
&gt; .X...O.<br>
&gt; .......<br>
&gt; .O...X.<br>
&gt; ..X.O..<br>
&gt; .......<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The X&#x27;s are in the same orbit and the O&#x27;s are in another orbit. I <br>
&gt; claim these two orbits will *always* have the same parity. The <br>
&gt; general Z(2)^n group doesn&#x27;t have a property like this. The <br>
problem <br>
&gt; exists for any cube of size 6 or larger and there are probably <br>
some <br>
&gt; other dependencies as well.<br>
<br>
I totally agree that those two orbitals will have the same parity no <br>
matter how you turn the faces and inner slices of the 7x7x7 cube.  <br>
These two orbitals are in symmetrical positions on the same inner <br>
slice over the y axis.  Any two orbitals in a symmetrical position <br>
over the vertical axis as seen on your diagram will always have the <br>
same parity.<br>
<br>
Below is the table I will refer to as the coordinates for the pieces <br>
on one face of a 7x7x7 cube.  Each ordered pair represents the piece <br>
in the ith row and the jth column on the F face of the 7x7x7 cube.<br>
<br>
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)<br>
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)<br>
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)<br>
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)<br>
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)<br>
(6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)<br>
(7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)<br>
<br>
I can represent all 6 center orbitals on the 7x7x7 cube with the <br>
following sub-grid,<br>
(2,2) (2,3) (2,4)<br>
(3,2) (3,3) (3,4)<br>
<br>
Call each entry in the grid above the representative of that given <br>
center orbital.  So when I say the orbital (2,2) I mean the oribtal <br>
that contains as an allowable position the piece on the F face at <br>
coordinates (2,2).<br>
<br>
To show that I still claim that the parities of the centers on a <br>
7x7x7 are isomorphic to Z(2)^3 I&#x27;ve posted a file to the files <br>
section (called &quot;7x7x7 parities.xls&quot;) that shows the group operation <br>
tables for Z(2)^3 and the group operation table for the parities of <br>
the 7x7x7 cube.<br>
<br>
In the file I have listed the elements of Z(2)^3 as ordered <br>
triples.  Let the operation on the group table be addition mod 2.  <br>
So the element in ith row and jth column means take the element in <br>
ith row label and add it to the element in the jth column label mod <br>
2.  Add the entry in the same position in each ordered triple mod 2 <br>
I mean.  Row and column labels are bolded in the file.<br>
<br>
In the 7x7x7 group table let the operation in the table be <br>
functional composition.  So the element in the ith row and jth <br>
column means do the permutation in the ith row header and follow it <br>
with the permutation in the jth column header.  The permutations are <br>
defined precisely as below.<br>
<br>
When I say &quot;change the parity of&quot; I mean if the parity is odd change <br>
it to even, if it is even change it to odd.  The labels are <br>
intuitive, F means turn F one quarter turn, r[1] means turn the <br>
inner slice r[1] (the one just behind R) one quarter turn.  F,r[1,2] <br>
means turn F and r[1] and r[2] all one quarter turn in any order <br>
(all 6 orders produce the same result because the group of center <br>
parities is abelian and hence functional composition is <br>
commutative).  The way each turn affects the parites is defined <br>
precisely below,<br>
<br>
e = the do nothing permutation.  Turn no faces at all.<br>
r[1] = change the parity of the orbitals (3,2),(2,3) and (2,4)<br>
r[2] = change the parity of (3,2),(2,3) and (3,4)<br>
r[1,2] = change the parity of (2,4) and (3,4)<br>
F = change the parity of (2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,2)(3,3),(3,4)<br>
F,r[1] = change the parity of (2,2),(3,3),(3,4)<br>
F,r[2] = change the parity of (2,2),(3,3),(2,4)<br>
F,r[1,2] = change the parity of (2,2),(2,3),(3,2)(3,3)<br>
<br>
Also notice that if I take a solved 7x7x7 cube and do the turn r[1] <br>
then I have changed the parity of the edges in the orbital attached <br>
to r[1] and I have changed the parity of the center orbitals as <br>
listed in the list above.  Associate the parity of the r[1] slice <br>
edge orbital with the parity of the orbital (2,4) and associate the <br>
parity of the r[2] slice edge orbital with the parity of the orbital <br>
(3,4).  If you examine all possible inner slice and outer face turn <br>
combinations, you&#x27;ll see that this is another dependency that must <br>
be satisfied.  So therefore our group for the parities of the <br>
centers on a 7x7x7 takes into account the parity of the centers and <br>
edges.  Ok now here is the isomorphism (see the file &quot;7x7x7 <br>
parities.xls&quot; in the files section for the actual operation tables.  <br>
You can compare that they are the same if the following elements are <br>
mapped to each other.<br>
<br>
1) Let (0,0,0) in Z(2)^3 be mapped to e in the 7x7x7 center parity <br>
group.<br>
2) Let (0,0,1) in Z(2)^3 map to r[1] in 7x7x7 group<br>
3) Let (0,1,0) in Z(2)^3 map to r[2] in 7x7x7 group<br>
4) Let (0,1,1) in Z(2)^3 map to r[1,2] in 7x7x7 group<br>
5) Let (1,0,0) in Z(2)^3 map to F in 7x7x7 group<br>
6) Let (1,0,1) in Z(2)^3 map to F,r[1] in 7x7x7 group<br>
7) Let (1,1,0) in Z(2)^3 map to F,r[2] in 7x7x7 group<br>
8) Let (1,1,1) in Z(2)^3 map to F,r[1,2] in 7x7x7 group<br>
<br>
Under this mapping my defined 7x7x7 parity group is isomorphic to Z<br>
(2)^3 which was my original claim.<br>
<br>
You mentioned that the orbitals (2,3) and (3,2) as labelled by my <br>
above grid must always stay the same.  If you examine the 7x7x7 <br>
group table, you&#x27;ll see that every permutation either changes the <br>
parity of both (2,3) and (3,2) or leaves both parities alone.  <br>
Therefore I agree that these orbitals must always have the same <br>
parity, though I still claim that the group of 7x7x7 center and edge <br>
parities is isomorphic to Z(2)^3.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

So u want designed facecenters. How about i give u the code ? ;-) 
But joke aside, to see whether facecenters on 4x4x4 cubes and larger 
are in their correct position/orientation u can tell by &quot;exploding&quot; 
the cube. Then u can see the colors on the faces on all sides that 
are facing u. To come up with a &quot;design&quot; is not so easy. What might 
be possible are some simple markers, but i&#x27;m not quite sure how i 
gonna do that. I know that it will &quot;unpurify&quot; my code quite a bit. 
If it comes out ok and not too complicated i might release it, 
otherwise i will just drop it. Also if i come up with designed 
centers then the explode is obsolete. Then all u need is the 
transparent. Hmm ...

cross!  I think your explanations are very clear, and I think this

&quot;Let&#x27;s face it, unless you&#x27;re some sort of math super genius or a

I&#x27;m not a math super genius, so does this mean I must be a witch??  ;)

BTW, if anyone has already named any of these algs, I&#x27;ll change my
names to match. I just tried to make a consistent set of names which
may, or may not provide a better key to memorisation.

For example, and without making any effort to memorize them (I just
thought them up as I went along), I immediately knew what Terence was
and was able to run the sequence through on my cube to check with my
notation.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris<br>
<br>
Thanks for the thoughts, like you say there would be a number of<br>
complications that would have to be resolved for computer-cubing to be<br>
practical.<br>
One of the main issues is time, as you saw in Toronto it&#x27;s pretty tough just<br>
getting large numbers of people through the normal 3x3 process in a couple<br>
of days with the amount of judges and scramblers needed.Maybe it could be a<br>
&quot;side&quot; tournament rather than on main stage and organised  seperately. I&#x27;ve<br>
got a great virtual cube on my phone that is very cool- I think they are<br>
going to be on sale /downloadable soon.<br>
<br>
Be interesting to hear what people think about this. <br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t forget we need volunteers for judging and scrambling at the Euro<br>
champs and World 2005 championship, the more help the better (and the more<br>
we can do!)<br>
Cheers<br>
Dave<br>

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Official RCC recognized computer cubing?<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey everyone.  I&#x27;m speaking for myself here, but I&#x27;m sure a lot of <br>
others would also agree.  Is there a way that the RCC can define a <br>
set of official rules so that there can be computer cubing at <br>
Official Rubik&#x27;s cube competitions?  There are a number of people <br>
who practice computer cubing fairly regularly, me being one of them, <br>
and I would love a chance to see something like a 7x7x7 timed cube <br>
competition.<br>
<br>
I can of a few issues that would need to be resolved in order to do <br>
this:<br>
<br>
1) Program used:  There are a number of programs that already exist <br>
to solve larger cubes, but for a competition should we standarize <br>
the program and see who is faster on that particularly program?  I <br>
think it would be better to standarize the possible features <br>
allowed, and let people make their own programs or use an existing <br>
program.  This introduces the possibility of &quot;back doors&quot; where <br>
people could program Macros or things into their program.  So <br>
perhaps it would be better to standardize the program and have <br>
someone the RCC recognizes as an official programer to write the <br>
program that we use for official computer cubing.  Seven Towns could <br>
market this program and sell it to competitors as well, so that we <br>
can practice on the &quot;official&quot; program at home.<br>
<br>
2) Features used on a program:  The first thing that comes to mind <br>
is the extra visibility that some programs have.  Some programs have <br>
an actual 2D representation of a 3D cube, so you can&#x27;t see the back <br>
three faces.  David Barr&#x27;s applet stretches the cube so that you can <br>
see all 6 faces at once, but the cube does not appear to be cube <br>
shaped unless you have some experience working with that program.  <br>
An official program would need to be either one or the other.<br>
<br>
i) Macros surely cannot be allowed in any way, shape, or form.  You <br>
must turn all faces by click dragging.  I think this should be a set <br>
feautre no matter what program.  Faces are pulled by click-and-drag <br>
for two adjacent squares.<br>
<br>
3) Amount of time required:  I myself would love to compete on the <br>
11x11x11 or even 20x20x20 cube, but I also practice lots of other <br>
puzzles and will be most likely to compete in several events at a <br>
competition.  So computer cubing would most likely have to run at <br>
the same time as the rest of the RCC recognized events.  Should a <br>
competitor miss another scheduled event that they would like to <br>
compete in, they will be disqualified by the current rules.  This is <br>
an issue that would have to be worked out somehow.<br>
<br>
4) Equipment: Where will we get the computers to use?  Will <br>
competitors be allowed to use their own computers?  This makes it <br>
possible to cheat by using your own program disguised to appear to <br>
function like the normal programs.  If we have an official program, <br>
then the programs could try to make it secure with a judges log-in <br>
or something similar.  This also means people with faster or better <br>
computers might have an advantage.  If the competitors are not <br>
allowed to use their own computers, does the competition organizer <br>
have to supply them?  This would cost money, but we might be able to <br>
get some sort of bulk discount.  Also competitors competing in <br>
computer cubing events could be charged a fee for competing that <br>
event to help pay for the computers.  I would pay such a fee to <br>
compete on a computer cube.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
These are just a few ideas I had about problems of implementing a <br>
computer cubing event.  However, I think if enough people are <br>
interested, that we can work around these problems.  Perhaps we can <br>
introduce only 6x6x6 and 7x7x7 cubing as official sanctioned events, <br>
but competitors may also choose to attempt a larger cube.  This <br>
could be setup so that if you successfully complete a larger cube <br>
you are recognized as the champion for that size cube (or some other <br>
type of prize).  We could give a prize for the largest solved cube <br>
in a given time period, say 24 hours.  This would limit the size to <br>
no more than 30x0 ro 40x40 assuming someone was only coming for the <br>
computer cubing category and did nothing but the largest size cube <br>
they could successfully complete in the given time.<br>
<br>
I do not mean to sound arrogant or patronizing, but it seems most of <br>
the people who would compete in the 6x6x6 or 7x7x7 category would be <br>
able to solve each type of cube (separately) in 30 minutes or less.  <br>
So if each competitor had a computer, or if half the competitors <br>
could be on a computer at once, then the entire 6x6x6 and 7x7x7 <br>
events together could be completed in 2 hours or less.<br>
<br>
If I may, I&#x27;d like to let this message be a petition from interested <br>
computer cubers who would like the RCC to consider forming official <br>
rules for competitive NxNxN cube solving.  If anyone else is <br>
interested, please reply to this message so that Dave Jones and <br>
others can see that there are those of us interested, and that this <br>
would not be a waste of their time.<br>
<br>
&gt;From what I&#x27;ve seen, there are enough people who practice big cubes <br>
that we should at the very least define official rules and allow <br>
record attempts on certain sizes, say the 6x6x6 and the 7x7x7.  This <br>
would give us a record for an even cube and an odd cube.<br>

I developped a sort of notation for triggers which may interest you. I
would call RU&#x27;R&#x27;U a double trigger. I would call R&#x27;URU&#x27; a reverse
pushed double trigger. See my foray into setting some kind of standard
under:

This is actually true in a sense. If u use my CubixPlayer2 u can see 
this clearly. If u solve the inner 2x2x2 cube first and proceed to 
the outer shell (the part we normally solve) there will never be any 
parity error or edges :D 

Hmm ... as long as u have solved the outer facecenters correctly ... 
*phew* :-)

Yeah i suppose u are a witch ;-)

&quot;Let&#x27;s face it, all witches can solve a normal rubik&#x27;s cube. But only 
true wizards can solve super-supercubes :D &quot;

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasamine,

   Trouble is there are two different types of &quot;solving&quot; a cube.

   One is where a person uses their brains and actually figures out
how to solve it, the other is where someone uses other skills and
follows a solution that someone else has figured out.

   I would guess the comment was about the thinking type not the
copying type.

   So the question is &quot;which witch is which?&quot;

R&#x27;URU&#x27; is U&#x27;RUR&#x27; backwards, so why not the reverse inverse?

some is cubital tunnel, but either way, they disapeared after

strenuous work.  Another thing you can do is hand stretches.  Chris 
Hardwick told me a great hand stretch.  All you do is stretch your 
fingers out as far back as you can and then bring one finger at a 
time to your palm.  It helps get rid of the tingles in your 
fingertips and also it feels good!  Yeah, this is the only stuff i

thanks a lot for that page. I&#x27;ve clicked the link to it several times 
in the past, looks like I knew there was something good coming up ;-)

I just worked through it and now I feel well-equipped (that 
flipped/nonflipped thinking is great!) to finally really practice on 
my cross.

Cheers!

Yeah i suppose u are a witch ;-)

&quot;Let&#x27;s face it, all witches can solve a normal rubik&#x27;s cube. But only

So come on people and become wizards !! ;-)

after Per KF (I think) described the commutator principle a while ago 
I was finally able to solve the cube fully intuitively, building all

Well, the article author sounds to me like she still doesn&#x27;t get it

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, when you find out someday how much group theory is in cubes, let 
me/us know. I&#x27;ve heard people saying something like &quot;Uh, I wish I knew 
group theory, my cubing could benefit so much&quot;. I don&#x27;t know much 
about group theory, but so far the only useful bits I know concern 
parities (not even sure if this is really group theory, maybe it&#x27;s 
more combinatorics?) and commutators (which doesn&#x27;t require group 
theory knowledge either).

Btw, I think the 7x7x7 is isomorphic to Z(2)^5. Look at the six orbits 
with their representants:

.......
.123...
.456...
.......
.......
.......
.......

Now all centers are marked:

.......
.12341.
.45652.
.36.63.
.25654.
.14321.
.......

We&#x27;ve already seen that 2 and 4 are always the same, but I think there 
are no more dependencies. Let&#x27;s look at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.

If we call the slices L1 to L7, then L2 proves {2,3} are independent 
of the others (1 is affected but keeps the parity, 5 and 6 aren&#x27;t 
affected at all).

L3 proves 2 and 3 are independent.

L4 proves 6 is independent from {1,5}.

L3 proves 5 is independent from 1.

So we have five independent center parities, not only three.

          <div class="email-content">Btw, some suggestions to further improve the page:

1) Build another distance table using the same format but showing the 
values to reach any one of the four &quot;relative goals&quot;.

2) Provide scrambling algorithms together with distances to the goal. 
Would be good for practicing. This could be generated automatically. 
The algorithms should be 15 moves, like your examples.

I don&#x27;t know how busy Lars is but I think it may be easy for him to 
provide both of these, since he already has a program.

   Of course there&#x27;s nothing wrong with just learning a method and
getting really good at it, but it&#x27;s different from working it out
yourself.

   Do I do everything intuitively? Depends on what you mean by
&quot;intuitively.&quot; If you mean &#x27;can I look at any scramble and &quot;see&quot; the
shortest way to solve it?&#x27; then no. If you mean &#x27;do I solve any
scramble entirely on my own, only using algs that I developed myself?&#x27;
then yes.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
  I was in Barnes and Noble the other day, searching for a book of <br>
brain teasers to keep me occupied in my american government class <br>
(i&#x27;m terrible, I know).  Well, the cover of the book _Eye Pleasing, <br>
Brain Teasing, 3D Conundrums_ caught my eye, as there was a rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube on it.<br>
<br>
So I started thumbing through it, and there are 3 puzzles involving <br>
rubik&#x27;s cubes (and the rest are indeed very eye pleasing).<br>
<br>
The first has a grid of 16 squares, with a completely scrambled cube <br>
in the upper left and a solved cube in the lower right.  Then the <br>
other 14 squares are cubes in intermediate stages of solution, the <br>
object is to put these intermediate steps in order.<br>
<br>
The second has 12 pictures of 6 scrambled cubes, two of each but from <br>
different angles.  It gives you the information that red is opp <br>
orange, white opp yellow, and green opp blue, and you have to match <br>
the like cubes.<br>
<br>
The third has a solved cube, and represents about 6-7 twists being <br>
performed on it, then it has 6 pictures each with a grey cube and a <br>
few stickers highlighted.  The object is to figure out which colors <br>
are represented by the highlighted stickers.<br>
<br>
All very interesting ways of putting cube problems in print I felt.  <br>
Thought you guys would like to know about it!<br>

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Grant Tregay&quot; &lt;Grant@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Wed, 14 Apr 2004 21:30:53 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">I know this was a while ago, but I did figure out a relatively easy <br>
way to get to the megaminx &quot;ultimate mix&quot; from a solved puzzle... I <br>
figured I&#x27;d share, in case anyone has a 12-color megaminx and wants <br>
to see it with 11 colors on each face (no face with a color <br>
duplicated). If you have a 6-color megaminx, it might even be <br>
interesting to see what pattern this comes up with - there will be no <br>
more than 2 of any given color on any face.<br>
<br>
To understand the following, you&#x27;ll have to understand some of what I <br>
use for megaminx notation.  Instead of duplicating all that <br>
information here, or explaining specific pieces of it, I&#x27;ll just <br>
refer you to http://Grant.Tregay.net/cube/solutions/megaminx/ which <br>
lays it all out.<br>
<br>
First, do the corners by swapping ten pairs of them:<br>
1) Setup moves: L-- DBR++<br>
2) Repeat the following (2a-2b) five times:<br>
2a) F+ (R- U+ R+ U-)*3 F-<br>
2b) Rotate puzzle 1/5 turn around L (either way, but same each time)<br>
3) Reverse setup moves: L++ DBR--<br>
<br>
At this point, if you&#x27;ve done it correctly, you will see that the <br>
edges remain intact, while the corners are nearly opposite from their <br>
starting positions.  Specifically, each color now has a star on one <br>
face (the face with the center of that color), and one corner tile on <br>
each of the faces surrounding the face opposite the star.<br>
<br>
For the edges, all you need to do is flip them all in place without <br>
messing up the corners.  For this task, use this alg, which I&#x27;ll <br>
refer to later as &quot;X&quot; for the sake of repetitions:<br>
X = (R- F-) (U+ L- U- L+) (F+ R+) (L+ F+) (U- R+ U+ R-) (F- L-)<br>
<br>
This alg, X, flips the U/F and U/L edges. Knowing that we just want <br>
to flip edges in place, you could figure out how to get there on your <br>
own, but I&#x27;ll put it in writing:<br>
1) Repeat the following (1a-1e) five times:<br>
1a) Perform X<br>
1b) Rotate the puzzle counterclockwise around F (same way as F-)<br>
1c) Perform X<br>
1d) Rotate the puzzle clockwise around F (Same way as F+)<br>
1e) Rotate the puzzle either way (same each time) around L<br>
2) Rotate the puzzle to swap L with DBR<br>
3) Repeat the following five times (same as 1a and 1e):<br>
3a) Perform X<br>
3b) Rotate the puzzle either way (same each time) around L<br>
<br>
Again, provided you did this correctly, and I have no typos above, <br>
none of the corners have moved and each of the edges is flipped, in <br>
place.  This then means that each color is on its original face (the <br>
center), each of the surrounding faces (the edges), and each of the <br>
faces surrounding the face opposite of the original face (the <br>
corners).<br>
<br>
Like it?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve recently learnt how to solve the rubiks cube using Jeays.net <br>
Solution 1 (http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm). Which is a layer by layer <br>
method where you do a cross, followed by all 4 corners.<br>
<br>
what i&#x27;m wondering, is whether method 1 or method 2 is better. Method <br>
2 involves inserting only 3 corners and having an empty corner to <br>
work with.<br>
<br>
one of the problems is that i don&#x27;t really want to unlearn the skills <br>
i have gained just to learn the 2nd method. I want to learn the 2nd <br>
method, while changing minimum steps.<br>
<br>
Also, unlike solution one, solution 2 is very confusing and i have no <br>
idea what his talking about, i&#x27;ve been From step 3 - Middle edge <br>
pieces (skipped the first 2 steps as i learnt how to do them from <br>
solution 1), are there any websites that document this method?<br>
<br>
on a side note my best time is 3:05 with solution 1 =(, i could go a <br>
bit faster my cube gets stuck easily, but anyway, this is besides the <br>
point.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope someone can help<br>

I&#x27;ve recently learnt how to solve the rubiks cube using Jeays.net 
Solution 1 (http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm). Which is a layer by layer 
method where you do a cross, followed by all 4 corners.

what i&#x27;m wondering, is whether method 1 or method 2 is better. Method 
2 involves inserting only 3 corners and having an empty corner to 
work with.

one of the problems is that i don&#x27;t really want to unlearn the skills 
i have gained just to learn the 2nd method. I want to learn the 2nd 
method, while changing minimum steps.

Also, unlike solution one, solution 2 is very confusing and i have no 
idea what his talking about, i&#x27;ve been From step 3 - Middle edge 
pieces (skipped the first 2 steps as i learnt how to do them from 
solution 1), are there any websites that document this method?

on a side note my best time is 3:05 with solution 1 =(, i could go a 
bit faster my cube gets stuck easily, but anyway, this is besides the 
point.


I hope someone can help

          <div class="email-content">Duncan congrats!  Doesn&#x27;t it feel great to break a record that&#x27;s 
been a barrier for a while?  I was stuck with the same average 
record (two handed) for two years a while back, and I remember how 
awesome it felt to finally break it.

Plus don&#x27;t really fast one handed solves just feel REALLY cool?

Congrats again, and happy cubing!

OR live somewhere far away from where you are now (make sure it&#x27;s in

Krzysztof is looking for oryginal Rubiks Cube in Poland. Let me 
answer to his question.

Jak dotšd nie udało mi się nigdy kupić oryginalnej kostki Rubika w 
Polsce. Nawet 20 lat temu kostki kupowałem przez poredników, którzy 
przywozili z Budapesztu.
Ja osobicie specjalnie jechałem rok temu na Węgry, tylko w tym celu. 
W Budapeszcie jest dystrybutor na tę częć Europy.
Oczywicie prostš alternatywš przy zakupie pojedynczej sztuki jest 
zakup przez internet.
A tak przy okazji to zapraszam cię na www.speedcubing.com.pl

I&#x27;m back from Paris. I couldn&#x27;t sleep at all last night, and
established a new personal worst average with 28 secs. Pure nightmare
:-)))

Anyway, today&#x27;s winner is: Thomas TEMPLIER.

Congratulations Thomas!

          <div class="email-content">If noone else is answering this then I&#x27;ll have a go.  As Kyle says this is
the keyhole method and I use it all the time.  Its probably not as fast as
the Fridrich method (which you can look up it lots of places) but you don&#x27;t
have to learn lots to use it.  I&#x27;ll try to explain without using lots of
notation.

Basically if you want to put a middle edge piece in then you would normally
1. turn down that edge space to the bottom layer
2. turn the bottom until the piece moves into its space place and then
3. move the space back up

That is 3 &quot;quarter turns&quot;.  Unfortunately if you have the corners in the top
layer when you do this move 2 will move the corner next to the edge space
you are trying to fill.  If you only put 3 corners in place though you can
move the spare corner over the edge space before you do this.  Then when you
put the edge in place you only need the 3 quarter turns and you don&#x27;t
disrupt anything you have already solved.

You can only do three edges like this.  When you have three corners and
three edges in place you need to use the &quot;keyhole&quot; - that is the still
unsolved middle edge space to help put the last corner in and then solve the
final middle edge as you have been doing.

It really is a lot faster then your method 1 and when you get used to it you
can be very efficient.  I solve the first two layers in 30-35 moves usually.

Hope this hasn&#x27;t confused you even more.

I&#x27;m not sure whether its on a website anywhere but I imagine it is.  There
are some great sites out there.

Most really fast people hold the cross to the bottom or left, I 
believe.  I too learned to solve &quot;Cross on top&quot; but naturally it 
turned into &quot;Cross on left.&quot;  I didn&#x27;t actively try to do this, I 
just noticed one day that after building the cross on the top, it 
naturally went to the left side during my F2L.

That said, I think the reasons for not having the cross on top is so 
that you can see more unsolved pieces simultaneously without looking 
around the cube.  That and you don&#x27;t have to turn the cube before the 
LL.

Times before I noticed Cross had moved to the left ~30-40s avg
Times now ~24-26 avg

So since I haven&#x27;t really answered your question... I&#x27;m gonna leave 
it at that ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hey, your situation sounds almost exactly like mine when I first 
started cubing.  I too learned how to solve the cube for the first 
time from Mark Jeays&#x27; solution, and I also found method 2 to be very 
confusing and hard to understand at first :)

I can assure you from experience though that learning Mark Jeays 2nd 
method did make a big improvement in my times.  It is also not 
required that you unlearn anything from the 1st solution, since you 
can combine the two solutions in any way you see fit.

Personally I find Mark Jeays&#x27; 2nd method to be faster than his 1st, 
and I&#x27;m pretty sure he would agree too.

Also, the concept of inserting the edges using a keyhole approach 
like in method 2 extends to other methods as well.  As a warning I 
am biased in my opinions here because I only know the Fridrich 
method, but the keyhole method helps a lot for speed-solving 
Fridrich style.  It probably helps for other methods too, but I can 
only really relate to the Fridrich method.  In her method, you can 
use &quot;empty slots&quot; sometimes to insert an edge into the middle layer 
in fewer moves than what it normally takes.  Using an empty slot to 
insert an edge Fridrich style is exactly the keyhole method.

So long story short, I was in the exact same position when I first 
started, and I can say that learning Mark&#x27;s 2nd method will indeed 
improve your times.  Also, knowing both methods would probably be a 
good introduction to some of the important skills required for speed 
solving should you choose to continue learning new things.

Good luck, and let us know how it goes!

little groupings, which usually (and conveniently) end
up being triggers. an alright example of this is a 3
corner cycle:
F&#x27;L F&#x27;R2 F L&#x27;F&#x27;R2 F2

can be re-written as:
(F&#x27;L F&#x27;)R2 (F L&#x27;F&#x27;)R2 F2

i don&#x27;t use this rotation of the alg however.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Duncan,

Where in Australia did she visit? :)

I think I know the cube you mean. Was the packaging a black plastic 
circular base (on which the cube sits) and a clear plastic cylinder 
top? And was the keyhole on the white face? I&#x27;d never seen these ones 
before either, until about a year ago. Now I&#x27;ve seen them in several 
stores in Canberra, Australia.

If it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m thinking, then this cube was my main speedcube 
for about a year. It&#x27;s stiff out of the box, but a little silicone 
makes it incredibly smooth and loose. In fact, a little silicone had 
a greater effect on that particular cube than any other cube I&#x27;ve 
ever had.

This cube used to be my favourite cube. I was actually using one of 
them at the World Championships last year. Pretty much every cuber 
there who tried my cube thought it was too loose though. I generally 
found everyone else&#x27;s cube to be not quite loose enough for me. I 
thought maybe it was because the vast majority of cubers are guys and 
therefore have larger and stronger hands/wrists and so my cube wasn&#x27;t 
really right for them. After that I started thinking of this cube as 
a &#x27;girl&#x27; cube. 

I think it&#x27;s an okay cube, and probably perfectly fine for a beginner 
or an intermediate cuber, but I doubt an expert cuber would be too 
interested in it.

I no longer use this cube because now I also find it a bit too loose. 
After a year of using it as my main speedcube, it&#x27;s not surprising 
it&#x27;s gotten quite loose. My favourite cube now is actually the one we 
got at the World Championships. I don&#x27;t use this one too much though 
because it has a lot of sentimental value and so I don&#x27;t want to wear 
it out. Now I mostly use a cube I bought at Toys&#x27;r&#x27;Us in Washington 
DC (I was there on holiday at Christmas time). I quite liked it and 
it was different to the cubes I&#x27;d seen in Australia so I stocked up 
while I was there (I bought 4).

          <div class="email-content">The average person seeing a 6x6x6 or a 7x7x7 in a toy shop is likely 
to be rather frightened by it I&#x27;d guess. They&#x27;d probably think it 
*much* too difficult to even attempt. Cubers, on the other hand, 
would love to have physical versions of these cubes. Anyone who can 
do the 3x3x3, 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, obviously isn&#x27;t going to be scared of 
a 6x6x6 or a 7x7x7. So I think it wouldn&#x27;t just be puzzle collectors, 
but puzzle enthusiastics generally. I&#x27;d certainly buy these 
puzzles! :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine,  Thanks for this.  She visited Canberra which looks like a very
nice place.
It sounds like this is the same cube.  Actually I really like loose cubes.
I think probably because I mostly cube onehanded and I find that i can
easily slip a turn in even if the edges aren&#x27;t properly aligned.  Once my
current cube dies (I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll last for ever!) this may be my next main
cube.

I added a piece to my cross page which I recently uploaded, it is <br>
about the 3-colour rule and describes a really useful trick to learn <br>
if you want to instantly see if you are putting the cross edges in <br>
the correct positions. It can be found at www.cubestation.co.uk<br>
<br>
Also on my profile, I uploaded a really cool pic of me cubing on the <br>
BA London eye, which I recently visited with my girlfriend.<br>
<br>
The picture of me solving - <br>

<br>
It was fun! If you have any pictures of you cubing in really cool <br>
places, eg the top of the CN tower, on a rollercoaster, whilst scuba-<br>
diving etc, please send them to me, and if I get enough I will make <br>
a webpage about it!<br>

Keep cubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">A little off topic, but I was wondering about speed mathematics, <br>
specifically speed multiplication, and can&#x27;t find out much about <br>
people who do it. Is there a forum or website anywhere devoted to <br>
the top speed mathematicians?<br>
<br>
I am using the Trachtenberg system which in the book is done from <br>
right-to-left. You can almost as easily do it left-to-right but you <br>
would then sometimes have to correct already calculated numbers <br>
which would suggest that it would be slightly slower. However, Jim <br>
Loy says that most of the top speed maths people do it left-to-<br>
right. Does anybody know if that is true? Which is best?<br>
<br>
The only other distinct method I can find is to mentally imagine an <br>
abacus and do the calculations on that.<br>

Well i started off with the first two steps from nerd paradise, i 
found that those pictures were easier to understand then notation. I 
then progressed to mark jeays site assuming solution 1 was better 
*doh*, and yeah eventually i learnt how to solve the cube!

So i tried learning soln #2 of jeays site, i skipped the first 2 
steps cuz i already know how to do them, and i got up to step 3 and i 
became totally confused at about the 3rd paragraph.

Anyway i ended up learning the keyhole method from this site: 
cubeland.fr.st

Would i be wrong in assuming that solution 1 and solution 2 are 
exactly the same apart from the keyhole bit?

<br>
here&#x27;s one pic of me that I like. Last year I visited Vancouver <br>
Island (west coast of Canada) with my parents and one day we walked <br>
along the &quot;pacific rim&quot; (directly on the pacific ocean). The next <br>
morning we noticed that one tv station had a camera pointing to a <br>
lighthouse we had been before. Since it was just a few minutes away <br>
my dad and I drove there, I found the camera and solved my skewb in <br>
front of it while my mom took pictures of us on tv ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">How about a 7x7x7 that will not &quot;fall&quot; apart but that you must take 
apart to make a move? ;-)

For example, you&#x27;d have to take the left three slices away from the 
right four, rotate them against each other and put them together 
again. Should take a second or less to do this I think. But fairly 
good stability might make up for it, other constructions might have 
to be turned slowly to prevent breaking the cube.

I&#x27;m just unable to produce hundreds of pieces even though they&#x27;d all 
be simple, otherwise I would&#x27;ve built one already :-(

The construction would work for any odd-sized cube (wanna have a 
9x9? An 11x11? ;-) and I&#x27;ve thought about converting it to normal 
twisting, but since I won&#x27;t be able to produce it anyway I haven&#x27;t 
put much effort into it...

Not completely... Because you use a keyhole to solve the first 3 of <br>
the middle layer edges, you can have up to 5 corners still unsolved <br>
once the rest of the edges are solved.  Becaue of this, the approach <br>
to solving the corners is a little different.<br>

<br>
I recently lubed my cube for the first time.  However, I think I may <br>
have overdone it.  I have a few questions for you, if it&#x27;s not too <br>
much trouble.<br>
<br>
1) How do you lube your cube, and how much silicone do you apply?<br>
<br>
2) How do you know if you have applied too much silicone, or if you <br>
have applied enough silicone?<br>
<br>
3) What are the consequences of applying too much silicone?<br>
<br>
4) How can you undo applying too much silicone?<br>

Thank you so much for your replies and your help.<br>

          <div class="email-content">1. Take it apart, and lube each piece seperately. Spray a bit of 
silicone on the black part, and set it down. Then once you&#x27;re done, 
let them all dry for anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour or two.

2. Right after you apply the silicone, you have to break it in. Turn 
each face about a hundred times. It should turn smoothly without too 
much effort. If the sides basically spin almost freely, then you&#x27;ve 
applied too much. But this is very hard to do, so you shouldn&#x27;t 
worry about it.

3. None really. The silicone might leak out, giving you a greasy 
cube, though. But take a damp towel, and just wipe the cube off. 
Then take a dry towel and wipe off the water.

4. If you want to take off the silicone, then take apart your cube 
and fill a bucket or something with water and drop all the pieces 
in. You can use a little bit of soap if you want, but generally 
water works well.

Five minutes to mix it up...

That reminds me of a past discussion on an electronic cube, one of the
functions of which would be having it automatically scramble itself.  It
seems that with all of the impending problems of building a big cube, it
might be more worthwhile to try to make one that is electronic.  Just my
$0.02.

And it would be much more practical for mixing up 5x5x5 and larger

I&#x27;m too lazy to go through the whole disassembly ritual.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been trying to go through my algorithms and figure out why they <br>
work just for fun to see if I can.  I figured out the edge mover <br>
that we all use for the Fridrich method.<br>
<br>
R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2 is actually a commutator with a setup alg.  <br>
Let P = R2 U<br>
A = F B&#x27; z&#x27;<br>
B = U2<br>
<br>
Then the alg is of the form P A B A&#x27; B&#x27; P&#x27;<br>
(R2 U) (F B&#x27; z&#x27;) (U2) (z B F&#x27;) (U2) (U&#x27; R2) which breaks down to,<br>
R2 U F B&#x27; z&#x27; U2 z B F&#x27; U2 U&#x27; R2 and upon removing the cube rotations <br>
and just writing the notation for the faces you turn, this reduces to<br>
R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2<br>
-------------------------------<br>
Anyway I just now figured out why the corner permutation algorithm <br>
works.  The one I am talking about is R&#x27; F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R2.  <br>
Some or most of you might have already figured this out, but if <br>
someone hasn&#x27;t here are my thoughts :)<br>
<br>
This alg is made up of two commutators strung together, so it is of <br>
the form A B A&#x27; B&#x27; C D C&#x27; D&#x27;<br>
<br>
Let A = R&#x27; F R&#x27;<br>
B = B2<br>
C = B2<br>
D = R2<br>
<br>
this gives (R&#x27; F R&#x27;) (B2) (R F&#x27; R) (B2) (B2) (R2) (B2) (R2)<br>
<br>
which when you reduce comes out to be,<br>
R&#x27; F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R2<br>
<br>
The way I like to think of this alg is to consider the subgroup of <br>
the cube where you are only allowed to turn the faces R and B.  This <br>
gives effectively 5 &quot;pieces&quot;.  The five pieces are,<br>
<br>
piece 1: DBL, BL, UBL<br>
piece 2: B face center piece, DB, UB<br>
piece 3: DBR, BR, UBR<br>
piece 4: R face center piece, RD, RU<br>
piece 5: DFR, FR, UFR<br>
<br>
The first commutator ABA&#x27;B&#x27; does a three cycle of the pieces 1, 3, <br>
and 5.  More specifically it does the cycle (1,5,3).  However it <br>
also moves one of the corner cubies on each of the larger pieces.  <br>
It only moves the corner cubies with yellow stickers on them, and <br>
moves the cubie from larger piece 1 to piece 3; the one from larger <br>
piece 3 to piece 5; and from larger piece 5 to piece 1.<br>
<br>
So in addition to cycling the larger pieces as (1,5,3) it also <br>
cycles the yellow cubie across the larger pieces like (1,3,5).  By <br>
this yellow cubie cycle I mean that the yellow cubie on piece 1 <br>
moves to piece 2, etc..  The net effect on the yellow corner cubies <br>
is not to be cycled at all.  By this I mean that they are in the <br>
correct larger piece position of the R,B subgroup of the cube, <br>
though not all are actually in their correct positions.<br>
<br>
The next commutator is a simple three cycle of the larger pieces 1, <br>
3, and 5 while preserving the larger pieces 2 and 4 (i.e. preserving <br>
the edges on the cube overall).  This last cycle cycles the larger <br>
pieces like (1,3,5).<br>
<br>
So the first commutator cycles the larger pieces like (1,5,3) then <br>
the second commutator cycles the larger pieces like (1,3,5).  This <br>
leaves a net effect of doing nothing on the larger pieces.  Also, <br>
the first commutaor does not cycle the yellow cubies at all, then <br>
the second commutator cycles the yellow cubies like (1,3,5).<br>
<br>
So overall the effect of this algorithm is to cycle only the yellow <br>
cubies like (1,3,5), which is why we use this alg, to cycle 3 <br>
corners in the top layer.<br>
<br>
So the corner cycle alg should no longer be &quot;magical&quot; to anyone :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

This is more or less what i tried to explain with my 3-
cycle &quot;lecture&quot; some months ago ;-) There i also extended the concept 
of 3-cycle to other &quot;blocks&quot; like 2x1, 2x2 and so on. Wherever u can 
produce some small effect with an alg A then u can create a 
commutator: ABA&#x27;B&#x27; or a conjugate of it: C-ABA&#x27;B&#x27;-C which in many 
cases will yield a 3-cycle.

Now there are also other easy edge 3-cycles:

1) RBLF-U-F&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27;-U&#x27; (UR->RF->UF)

2) R2B2L2-U-L2B2R2-D ((UF->DF->DR)

Number 1) is clearly a commutator, while 2) is not (D should be U&#x27;) 
Now how do we &quot;know&quot; that both of these should produce a 3-cycle on 
edges? That &quot;small&quot; effect is not easy to see.

Food for thought :D

I&#x27;m a bit lost.

I see this sequence as (R&#x27; F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R) (R2 B2 R2).
(R&#x27; F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R) (conjugation) permutes U-corners and &quot;other
cubies&quot;, (R2 B2 R2) un-permutes &quot;other cubies&quot; only.

But there&#x27;s still some magic left :-)

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys/gals,<br>
<br>
My two friends and people from neighboring table watched me timed myself<br>
while I was speedsolving the cube (3x3x3) last April 18, 2004 about 9:30am<br>
using the downloaded version of The ultimate Rubik&#x27;s cubeï¿½ timer version<br>
2.1. Here in the Philippines the Rubikï¿½s Cube is not that interesting<br>
anymore and just treating it as a simple toy (yeah right) with little or no<br>
possible solution (duh), a childish trinket (har har). Anyway here are my<br>
times on the attempt:<br>
01:07.83  01:11.90  01:22.55  01:31.17  01:11.61  01:06.89  00:55.74<br>
01:21.78  01:32.05  01:08.16  01:26.00  01:10.58<br>
<br>
Ave  : 1:15.85 (now) - 1:18.73 (before)<br>
Best : 0:55.74 (now) - 1:01.62 (before)<br>
<br>
This is my first time to go sub-minute using corner first method and some<br>
customized algorithm borrowed from Jessica Fredrich and Lars Petrus (Thanks<br>
you guys).<br>
<br>
I was so nervous that when I speedsolved it under a minute that I can&#x27;t seem<br>
to believe the time. Donï¿½t get me wrong or anything I got very, very, very<br>
exited breaking the minute barrier (still is), since this is one of my goals<br>
for the cube (next is the 50, 45, 40, 35 sec so on). But after doing the<br>
twelve tries and after the pressure died down, it seems at that time that I<br>
had cheated, using fear of failing in public and adrenaline to boost my<br>
reflexes, movement and the ability to recall algorithms. I have not been in<br>
any situation where in you are closely watched and scrutinized while doing<br>
something like this. This is my first time to speedsolve the cube in a<br>
public place (coffee bar) and it our favorite hang out at that. The feeling<br>
you get when you do cube solving in front of people you don&#x27;t know other<br>
than your friends or family is so... you know clostrophobic. So since then<br>
this question has been bouncing inside my head:<br>
<br>
Should I disregard this time put this time in a category on itï¿½s own (best<br>
adrenalin time or best fluke) and go back to my old best time or treat it as<br>
it is. My very best.<br>
<br>
Hmm. maybe it was the two cups of Ice Lattï¿½ and Ice Cappuccino that did it.<br>
Oh well, anyway, just would like to share this experience.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s great! I know others had of course already discussed the <br>
theory before, but to see it in action to explain some shortest <br>
possible algorithms is pretty cool. Next step should be to find <br>
*new* shortest algorithms with this, right? Especially for larger <br>
(super)cubes.<br>
<br>
As a motivation, here&#x27;s the history of my 4x4 parity fixing:<br>
<br>
1. Find a short sequence destroying the LL a bit. Write down the <br>
effect. Call it X. Build another algorithm Y by doing X and then X&#x27; <br>
from a certain different angle. Continue like this. I actually <br>
planned a working edge-pairs swap with a total of around 250 moves <br>
*on paper* like this. Took me five minutes to execute then. <br>
Horrible ;-)<br>
<br>
2. Make up an algorithm by using an old 3x3 edge-flip algorithm in a <br>
commutator. Much better.<br>
<br>
3. Learn algorithm from Chris Hardwick. Even better.<br>
<br>
Still, as far as I know, the algorithms (from Chris) I now use are <br>
not known to be optimal. And for other purposes (e.g. super 5x5) new <br>
short algorithms would be cool.<br>
<br>
After building my own algorithms with commutators I got the <br>
impression that intuitive algorithms built this way are often far <br>
from being shortest possible algorithms and Chris&#x27;s first example <br>
(the 3-edge-cycle) was actually one reason I thought so.<br>
<br>
Building simple commutators has become fairly easy now for me. But <br>
building conjugators or concatenating commutators that cancel out <br>
nicely seems very hard, similar to the FMC task.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan, while we&#x27;re on the subject perhaps we can all put our 
heads together and come up with the official breakdown of the 4x4x4 
parity alg.  Meaning, is it a conjugate of a commutator or two 
commutators etc..

Here is what I have come up so far,

r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2

we can break it down as a conjugate, let P = r2 B2

then the alg is (P) (U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27;) (P&#x27;)

so we know it is a conjugate at least.  There are lots of U2&#x27;s 
(which is it&#x27;s own inverse) and (r)&#x27;s (l)&#x27;s and (r&#x27;)&#x27;s and (l&#x27;)&#x27;s so 
I&#x27;m guessing the middle might be two commutators like the corner 
cycle algs was.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find how to break it down 
though.

As a side note I found this algorithm on a list of other 4x4x4 and 
5x5x5 cube algorithms when I was first trying to figure out the 
4x4x4.  I don&#x27;t remember now where that list is, but it had several 
parity fix algs for the 4x4x4 and some other cool algs for the 
5x5x5.  I don&#x27;t even remember who wrote the list.  The alg I picked 
and put on my website had the shortest number of moves on that list 
though, that&#x27;s why I decided to learn it.

The other 4x4x4 alg on my site, r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2, I discovered 
on my own.  r2 U2 r2 U2 r2 swaps the edges in the U layer the way we 
want and r2 u2 r2 u2 swaps a center row on the F face with one on 
the B face.  Both of these algs are fairly intuitive on their own 
and I found them just by playing around on the cube.  If you combine 
the two you get (r2 U2 r2 U2 r2) (r2 u2 r2 u2) which simplifies to 
r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is optimal though, how 
could you prove whether it is or not?

You may have noticed that this alg really stinks for use on a 
supercube.  My supercube 2 edge-pair swap alg is,
f R U&#x27; B R&#x27; U f&#x27; b&#x27; U&#x27; R B&#x27; U R&#x27; b

I&#x27;m sure this is not optimal. I would be very happy to find a 
shorter alg to fix this :)

Chris

P.S. In terms of a shortest parity fix alg I think Per K&#x27;s (u&#x27;) 
wins :)

   I explained the logic behind this alg last September. The subject
was &quot;trial and error&quot; versus thinking something through. Start with a
solved cube.

   I figured if I moved a slice up, say r, onto the Up side, and
rotated that side 180 degrees, U2, then pulled the slice back down,
r&#x27;, and rotated the Up side back, U2, that I would exchange 3 edge
pieces in a line.

   I looked at the possibility, pictured how to do it, did it and it
worked. r U2 r&#x27; U2. 

   I figured I could substitute another edge not in that line for one
of those 3 edge pieces in a line, like R2 D&#x27; and that worked. I then
figured I could line them up using the Up side instead of the Down
side and that worked, and that&#x27;s how I arrived at the alg I use for
swapping three edges on the LL.

R2 U f&#x27; U2 f U R2

   It would take too long to explain how I figured out this one, but
watch the corner at RUB, and watch the place it starts.
   When you do R&#x27;F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R2 basically you are isolating the
&quot;place&quot; it belongs, putting another cubie in its place, then putting
the &quot;place&quot; back. 

   Though you call it a three cycle, it isn&#x27;t. It just looks that way.

   You cannot swap just two corners, or just two edges - you have to
swap two edges and two corners together. The edges just look like they
are in place.

   This is a two corner swap: If you apply the alg to a solved cube
follow up with U&#x27;and you&#x27;ll see that UBL and UBR are in their correct
relation ship but that UFL and UFR are switched.
   If you swap only edges QU&#x27; R2 U f&#x27; U2 f U R2 you will see that you
have two deges and two corners swapped.

   Do you understand?

          <div class="email-content">This might be a little off your topic here, but does anybody solve 
the 4x4x4 intuitivey?  I&#x27;ve never been able to come up with something 
on my own to fix the parity error besides pretty much starting over.  
Is there any bit of information that would be helpful for me to fix 
the parity error intuitively rather than with a memorized algorithm 
(regarless of number of moves or speed)?

   It is a three cycle, what I meant to say is that it looks as though
the alg swaps three corners, but it really swaps two.

   Take it apart, wash it, and dry it. To get all the internal edges
line them up spray them right to left for a second and then left to
right for a second. Let it sit until its dry. Reassemble the cube.

   If it takes too long to dry.

   Th cube&#x27;s movements feel &quot;tacky&quot; for a while, even as long as a week.

   Disassemble the cube, take a cloth and wipe some of it off.

Hi Dave,

   With the idea that you aren&#x27;t affecting the parity error when doing
other stuff like moving center pieces around, try this.

   Swap two corners like you would on the 3x3x3 then swap those two
corners back treating the 4x4x4 like the 2x2x2 (always moving a side
and the slice next to it as one).

   Then put the other stuff back as you normally do.

   Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Hey Stefan, while we&#x27;re on the subject perhaps we can all put our <br>
&gt; heads together and come up with the official breakdown of the <br>
4x4x4 <br>
&gt; parity alg.  Meaning, is it a conjugate of a commutator or two <br>
&gt; commutators etc..<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Here is what I have come up so far,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think this can be a conjugate or commutator because they&#x27;re <br>
always an even permutation, but the parity you fix with it is an odd <br>
permutation.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I tried to prove Per wrong by rewriting his <br>
(R2B2L2-U-L2B2R2-D) as (R2B2L2x2-D-x2L2B2R2-D) which fixes <br>
the &quot;wrong face error&quot; but leaves the &quot;direction error&quot;. So in his <br>
case I know it can be done with a commutator but it&#x27;s maybe somehow <br>
hidden. Hmm, what did I want to say with this... oh right, I thought <br>
there might be a real commutator hidden in your algorithm that <br>
*almost* does what we want and it&#x27;s just a move away somehow. For <br>
starters, I&#x27;d like to find out what I can do to make Per&#x27;s above <br>
example a true commutator... will think about it.<br>
<br>
&gt; The other 4x4x4 alg on my site, r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2, I discovered <br>
&gt; on my own.  r2 U2 r2 U2 r2 swaps the edges in the U layer the way <br>
we <br>
&gt; want and r2 u2 r2 u2 swaps a center row on the F face with one on <br>
&gt; the B face.  Both of these algs are fairly intuitive on their own <br>
&gt; and I found them just by playing around on the cube.  If you <br>
combine <br>
&gt; the two you get (r2 U2 r2 U2 r2) (r2 u2 r2 u2) which simplifies to <br>
&gt; r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is optimal though, how <br>
&gt; could you prove whether it is or not?<br>
<br>
First define how you measure optimality... My (U2 u2) (R2 r2) D2 l2 <br>
D2 (R2 r2) (U2 u2) beats yours 8 to 10 if inner slice moves are <br>
counted as two moves ;-) I also discovered this intuitively, trying <br>
to line up the four edge cubies in one slice and putting same-<br>
colored centers on opposite faces on the slice. Did you try mine for <br>
speed? (I think I once sent it to you...)<br>
<br>
Since we know a very small upper bound already, a computer could <br>
check all shorted solutions, that way proving optimality (or not ;-<br>
). Does anybody have a 4x4 solver at hand?<br>
<br>
&gt; My supercube 2 edge-pair swap alg is,<br>
&gt; f R U&#x27; B R&#x27; U f&#x27; b&#x27; U&#x27; R B&#x27; U R&#x27; b<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m sure this is not optimal. I would be very happy to find a <br>
&gt; shorter alg to fix this :)<br>
<br>
Why are you so sure?<br>
<br>
&gt; P.S. In terms of a shortest parity fix alg I think Per K&#x27;s (u&#x27;) <br>
&gt; wins :)<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think it was Per&#x27;s and btw (U u) is even faster ;-)<br>

Btw, it seems to me that you don&#x27;t like to just mirror algs and <br>
switch roles of left and right hand to perform them. Is this <br>
correct? For example, I just noticed that you use my favourite <br>
algorithm for the &quot;FR-Fd1&quot; case but its mirrored version doesn&#x27;t <br>
appear in your list for &quot;FR-Rd1&quot;. Does it maybe help to stabilize <br>
the cube when you use your hands for different roles throughout? I <br>
noticed that this is a problem for me when I do F2L but maybe my <br>
cube is just bad or I&#x27;m too unadept...<br>

- I&#x27;m not advanced enough yet ;) - no but seriously I would like to 
spend a lot of time on this page because I think there is so much to 
cover...(ok ok I know it&#x27;s an excuse) but the F2L is one of the most 
difficult areas of the cube solution to explain.

- you&#x27;re quite right, I don&#x27;t like to use my left hand much at all 
if I can help it. But of course, for all different angles I do use 
pretty much the same algorithms but just mirrored or inverted or 
whatever. This is something I hope to explain in the advanced 
section, and is something I couldn&#x27;t communicate easily by just 
showing the standard 42 cases. Apart from that, I hope you found 
some use for them! If I get time perhaps I shall add all mirrors and 
things for completeness.

Seeya! Dan :)

Hi Wayne,

If you only just got your 5x5x5 today I suggest that you follow 
Ton&#x27;s golden rule and spend at least 8 hours playing with it to 
break it in a bit before lubing it.

After that you will probably have enough success just squirting a 
(small) amount of lube in the cracks while still assembled.  It will 
initially be quite tacky until the propellant has a chance to 
evaporate but then it should run better.

If you are determined to take it apart to do a hardcore lube job 
then I would suggest trying to pop out an edge TRIO instead of a 
single edge piece.  Be forewarned though -  it can sometimes be 
kinda tricky getting them back together.

enjoy your prof cube,

Rob

          <div class="email-content">I think your cube might be different from the rubiks.com one since 
it is unforgiving with the alignment.  Rubiks.com cubes tend to give 
fairly nicely so I would recommend getting one of those.

The ones you buy in a store are basically the same thing as the ones 
online so you can just go to Wal-mart or anyplace to get one.  
Personally I like the rubiks.com cubes and have been able to work 
them into good speedcubes.  If you don&#x27;t plan on putting a lot of 
work into the cube, i.e. no silicone or anything, then I would 
definitely recommend the rubiks.com cubes as they give a little for 
the alignment and are already fairly loose right out of the box.

If you&#x27;re curious whether the rubiks.com cubes are good speedcubes, 
I think they are.  I can average sub-19 on a rubiks.com cube after 
working on it some, so I think they work fine for speedsolving - 
even if you don&#x27;t spend a lot of time working it into a speedcube.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Arturo,

   There are two color schemes that were/are &quot;official.&quot; The newest
scheme was declared &quot;official&quot; about two years ago. The first was used
from 1980 until about two years ago. I have no idea why they changed it.

Your scheme : F Red, B Orange, U Green, D Yellow, R Blue , L White
First scheme: F Red, B Orange, U Green, D Yellow, R White, L Blue
New scheme  : F Red, B Orange, U Green, D Blue  , R White, L Yellow

   The first scheme was used on the original Ideal 3x3x3, 2x2x2,
4x4x4, C*4 cube, the Deluxe and the Game cubes. At the time the C*4
cube was introduced the color scheme was declared &quot;official.&quot; These
account for the majority of genuine cubes sold in the USA, Canada, and
England.

   Your scheme was found on many cubes made for Ideal in Taiwan in the
early 1980s when they accidently swapped two opposing colors. 

   I see no reason to change the color scheme from what you are used
to unless you&#x27;re looking for specific cubes. 

   If you want present day cubes from Hasbro, Winning Moves, or
Rubiks.com go with the new scheme - but those cubes are not
adjustable. The Rubik&#x27;s studio cube comes in that scheme and is
adjustable.

  If you want the older Ideal cubes which are adjustable, the majority
of them were made with the first color scheme, but the other schemes
are available, too. These can be found on ebay and you can ask the
seller about the colors.

Regards,

   David J

The older cubes are worse - not as slick and pop sometimes. I can&#x27;t

<br>
Well, this is not quite the release that i have promised. But i have <br>
completely re-engineered the program with new more efficient graphics <br>
components. I now have more flexibility in making graphics with <br>
transparency and antialiasing. I did some testing with transparent <br>
outer shell(s), but it didn&#x27;t come out too well. So i will keep just <br>
showing an outline of some of the cubicles of the outer shell(s). The <br>
old explode is now gone, since i will make designed facecenters <br>
instead. Most likely the design will be arrows, and also some marks <br>
on the edges that the facecenter arrows should point towards. If <br>
anyone has other ideas for facecenter design let me know. <br>
<br>
Now it&#x27;s late, time to sleep .... zzzzzz<br>

As you know, Caltech is hosting the 2004 United States Championships on <br>

Anyway, I&#x27;ll be working at Stanford and I plan to drive down (or fly if <br>
it comes down to it) on July 9 at maybe 12 PM and arrive at Caltech at <br>
6 PM.  Then I&#x27;d probably drive back early morning on Sunday, July 11.  <br>

I used to be a hugh proponent of the regular Rubik&#x27;s brand. I 
recently ordered two: one in the Hasbro packaging and one that was 
called &quot;delxue&quot; (arched centered, box frame packaging), both from 
Amazon. I had heard from friends that in the past year they have 
chnged the tooling of these cubes to be looser, but as the experts 
know, looseness has little to do with smoothness. I had to send my 
deluxe one back due to molding defects (the axel under orange had a 
hugh bulge in the white plastic), and now I just found a similar 
defect on my other cube. This really lowers my confidence in their 
product.

I really wish there was a good source of high-quality speedcubes; I 
would much more for a good cube. But I&#x27;m not yet a fan of the 
plastic on Studio cubes.

I much more prefer the older rubiks.com ones that were much stiffer 
(they become smooth after a month of my wear) over the ones I 
bought. I think the main problem that limits the life span of a good 
speedcube is the springs. So I tried to place my old pieces on a new 
mechanism as some fellow speedcubers suggested. That lead to massive 
misalignment issues and over-springiness. Perhaps using different 
corner/edge/mechanism combination will work better... Does anyone 
have experience and advice in making composite cubes like this? 
Secondly, I have major difficulties finding a well balenced cube 
(proper tension and equal tension on all 6 sides). So I might have 
to try Studio cube mechanism with my old pieces.

Oh great, now it&#x27;s locking-up like crazy... I&#x27;m going to have to to 
some major sanding of defects.

So now that my classes are over, I&#x27;ll be practicing all the the 
time. Sub-20 isn&#x27;t a problem, doing it consistantly will be.

Hey Tyson, what are the housing arrangments going to be like? Any 
luck with getting use of resHalls? That will be prefered over 
finding a hotel.

1/6 - Edges OK {0}
4/6 - 3-cycle edges - RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27; or inverse {7}
1/6 - 2-edge swap - L&#x27;BL&#x27;D2RF&#x27;R&#x27;D2L2B&#x27; {10}

0*1/6 + 7*4/6 + 10*1/6 = 38/6 = 6.33
W/ optional adjustment: 6.33 + 0.75 = 7.08

Hi Pedro,

   I think that working them out yourself would be easy.

   How many moves to permute the last layer edges w/o changing the
edges orientation?

   Three possibilities, seven moves each, counting any move as one.

   1. One in place, three out: R2 U f&#x27; U2 f U R2
   2. Swap two pair across: r2 U r2 U2 r2 U r2
   3. Swap two pair adjacent: r2 D f2 D&#x27; f&#x27; r2 f 

   In 1. and 3. the U may go the other direction.

Regards,

David J

Hi Again Pedro,

    Oh yeah, the calculations:

    If all the corners are in place, you can have: 
    1. one in place, three out - 7 moves, 8 possibilities - 8 moves 24
possibilities (needing alignment)
      one in place - each of four edges times
      three out - clockwise or counterclockwise
      U aligned  1 out of 3 times

    2. Swap two pair across - 7 moves, 1 possibility (aligned) - 8
moves, 3 possibilities (needing alignment) 

    3. Swap two pair adjacent - 7 moves, 2 possibilities - 8 moves, 6
possibilities (needing alignment)
      
and 4. All in place - no moves, 1 possibility - 1 move, 3
possibilities (needing alignment)

   So that&#x27;s 48, 

    1/48  * 0 moves = 0 moves
    3/48  * 1 move = 3 moves
    11/48 * 7 moves = 77 moves
    33/48 * 8 moves = 264 moves

   0 + 3 + 77 + 264 = 344 moves
   divided by 48 = 7 1/6 moves average = 7.16666666666666666666666667

   Remember that this is for all the corners in place.


   If you swap two corners you can swap them two ways 

   1. Adjacent corner swap
   2. Across the center corner swap

   But this is a great opportunity to get confused. When you swap two
corners you always swap two edges, but it can appear that you have all
the edges in place when have two corners out, but you don&#x27;t really.

   For example: on a solved cube do R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U it looks like
all the edges are in place, but turn U and you&#x27;ll see that two corners
URF and URB are in place and the other two corners are swapped.

   Anyway, I&#x27;ve done the &quot;corners in place&quot; calculation of edges for
you. Feel free to do the &quot;corners out of place&quot; calculation. Is it the
same?

Regards,

David J

yeah, a midwest regional sounds good.  my mother is thinking the 
same thing you are...so many miles away, plane tickets, etc.  She 
wouldn&#x27;t worry as much if the competition was closer.  

however, we would need to get enough involvement, sponsers, a place 
for the competition, timers, judges, and much more.  also, 
midwest...we might have to restrict it to certain states, or like 
the US comp., have only a person living in the midwest claim the 
title but let other participate.  but i&#x27;m all for it, if we can do 
something about it.

Hi Joël,

   Two algorithms can do all CLL.

   The corners can be out of place two ways, and be facing the wrong
way 7 different ways, so you may need to apply each twice.

   1. Place (Permute) the corners: R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L (U) - (exchanges
two corners)
   2. Orient the corners: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; (U2) - (Rotates three corners)

   These should increase your speed, and you can go on to specialized
algs later.

   Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Has anyone learned the Philip Marshall method for<br>
solving the cube?  It&#x27;s an edge-first, two algorithm<br>
method (with mirrors).  He says on average, the cube<br>
can be solved with 70 moves.<br>
<br>
He has a partial explanation on his website, and a<br>
video you can buy with the whole solution.  He also<br>
has instrucitons on the mini cube and the 4x4x4 cube.<br>
<br>
I purchased the video.  Solving the edge pieces is<br>
pretty simple, but it&#x27;s the solving the corners that<br>
is giving me trouble.  It&#x27;s difficult to see the<br>
patterns he&#x27;s describing.  But it&#x27;s an interesting<br>
solution.<br>

The website for the solution is here: <br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks! I already know these algs, though. I was thinking about a 
system to solve all LL corners in one sequence. Would that be faster 
than Gaétan Guimond&#x27;s method?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   Hasbro, Winning Moves and Rubiks.com cubes are all the same.

   The new cube is a large improvement over the old. I&#x27;ve two and they
never pop.

   One way of dealing with misalignment is to go with it and not fight
it, for example, if you do U R, then slightly over rotate U the R
won&#x27;t catch.

> out too ... hehe :D

Wow... that took a while to figure out, but here it is:

http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/cubecombos.html#super-supercube

If anyone is interested how I came up with that number, basically 
you start from the inside most supercube and permute all the pieces, 
then work outward for each layer.

So for the 4x4x4 supercube you can permute the 2x2x2 (super)cube in 
7!*3^6 ways.  Now the cycle of the corners is either even or odd.  
If the cycle of the corners is odd, then so is the cycle of the edge 
orbit on the 4x4x4 supercube.  If the cycle of the corners is even 
on the 2x2x2 (super)cube then so is the cycle of the edge orbit on 
the 4x4x4 supercube.  Also, the corners of the outer 4x4x4 shell can 
permute into all 8! positions since I based the orientation of the 
whole puzzle on the innermost cube.  Now the cycle of the 4x4x4 
shell corners is either even or odd, and the cycle of the centers 
must be the same as that of the corners (same as on the normal 4x4x4 
supercube).

Anyway this extends to the nxnxn cube.  After permuting the 
innermost cube into all of its possible positions (unrestricted 
since it is the inner most cube) you limit the parity of all the 
orbits on any other shell to be the same as the parity of the 
corners on the shells inside that shell.

Anyway to give you an idea of how big the super-supercube numbers 
get, here are some possible combination calculations:

normal 4x4x4 cube: 7.40 * 10^45
4x4x4 supercube: 1.41 * 10^54
4x4x4 super-supercube: 3.12*10^61

20x20x20 cube: 1.34 * 10^1477
20x20x20 supercube: 3.35 * 10^2123
20x20x20 super-supercube: 2.12 * 10^7830

So the super-supercubes have a ridiculous number of possible 
combinations :)

tee hee, math rules :)

The other Sunday contest died... so the Caltech Rubik&#x27;s Cube Club is <br>
going to start a new one.  Check it out here:<br>
<br>
http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tmao/sundaycontest.html<br>
<br>
This week provides the scrambles from the Caltech Rubik&#x27;s Cube <br>
competition so you can try the competition and see how you would have <br>
placed against the competitors who competed on April 3rd.   And if you <br>
competed on April 3, there is an alternate list of scrambles provided.  <br>
Anyway, I hope to see people enter!<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t forget the Saturday contest either!  It should make your weekend <br>
cubing experience complete!<br>

Where is the general expression for the super-supercubes ?? Is it 
different for odd/even sized cubes??

Anyway those numbers are really mind-boggling :D

          <div class="email-content">Thank you! Those are many algorithms! I think that&#x27;s the advantage 
of GG&#x27;s method; all it takes is very few, easy to memorize 
algorithms, and efficiency is not too bad. But maybe I&#x27;ll try 
memorizing the CLL-system somewhere in the future.

          <div class="email-content">The main problem right now is that there is no set of criteria.  The four that you have 
listed seem to be absolute &quot;musts&quot; for a competition.  I also think the timing device has to

Guinness should not necessarily be involed.  If anyone has seen their list of critera for

          <div class="email-content">If some committee or the RCC or some group comes up with an official 
set of rules and we start recognizing our own official rules would 
Guinness accept our rules?  I remember reading that for an official 
Guinness recognized attempt that you had to use a brand new cube 
right out of the box?????  They changed that I think since Jess&#x27; 
record doesn&#x27;t follow that old rule but is still the official 
record.  I think that old rule clearly shows a lack of knowledge of 
the &quot;sport&quot; of cubing, but at least they&#x27;re refining their rules.

This raises an issue then.  Do we want our rules to be only accepted 
by the cubing community, or do we want Guinness to recognize our 
records?  Also I know that Guinness is really only interested in the 
3x3x3 blindfold and 3x3x3 speedcubing records, which stinks in my 
opinion but I can understand them not wanting 1000 records under the 
specialized category of &quot;solving Rubik&#x27;s cube&quot;.

My natural gut reaction would be to have Mr. Rubik, or the RCC, or 
both propose an extremely detailed outline of what constitutes an 
official record.  That seems to be the committee that would do 
this.  Is someone from the RCC interested in this?  Or do we as 
cubers have to pull together a committee and do this ourselves?  
What&#x27;s the game plan?

I tend to think that Guiness should accept what the cube community tell them
is acceptable or the tail is wagging the dog.
I&#x27;d be very happy for some sort of committee to be set up and to include
those who are generally accepted as having authority in the area e.g. any
current (or past!) world record holders, mr rubik, rcc.

A draft set from the US would be fine by me.

This forum is good for on-line discussion but shouldn&#x27;t have any fnal say.

Does anyone know enough to take this forward?

I am already talking to Guinness about the fact that they HAVE to accept our
rules and can&#x27;t impose their own -after all they don&#x27;t do this for any other
sport.
Leave it with me for now, once they have accepted this a definitive set of
rules needs to be drawn up for all aspects of cubing. I know Dan Harris and
some others are looking at &quot;fewest moves&quot; and all help is appreciated. We
have the original rules from Toronto and Ron/Ton are looking at these and
improving them if necessary for the European Championship.

Please don&#x27;t anyone contact Guinness direct as this will confuse them.

Duncan - The RCC was set up to oversee and officiate at the Toronto
Championship and consisted myself and Chrisi from Seven Towns, Dave
Charbonneau from Kroeger Inc, Canada, Patrick from Hessport, Janos from
Rubik Studio, Hungary and Dan Gosbee. With the exception of Dan and Janos
none of us are speedcubers (yet!).
Thanks

In addition to standardizing the world records, I think it&#x27;s also necessary
to standardize 
the official tournaments.  I see many differences between the tournaments
held in 
Pasadena and the one in Germany and the one in France.  It would be best to
have a set 
standard for everyone.

          <div class="email-content">All,
Part of the problem we have is that there&#x27;s not really a governing 
commitee that officiates over the sport/hobby and its competitions, 
except for a couple of very informal ones:
-This discussion group
-The RCC
The problem with these is that the discussion group is a generally 
open, free forum that is subject to all sorts of people with all 
sorts of interests.  And also, there are many people who cube who 
don&#x27;t keep up with the newsgroup.
The RCC, while more organized, was developed to consist largely of 
corporate/sponsor representation, and the actual speedcubers on the 
committee don&#x27;t represent speedcubing in any formal capacity... 
they&#x27;re just hard workers who had a good bit of stature in the 
speedcubing community.  If we formed some sort of actual 
organization, elected the leadership of that organization, and 
collected some small annual dues to it was explicitly clear who was a 
member, then we would have the kind of governing body that other 
groups have.

I realize there&#x27;s some natural resistance to this... To many people 
the idea of electing a governing committee would seem like we&#x27;re 
turning over control of speedcubing to a small group.  Also, the RCC 
may want to remain the only organized voice in speedcubing.

However the benefits of this sort of organization is clear.  It makes 
it easy to set, and when necessary, change the &quot;official rules&quot; of 
speedcubing (as much talk as we have on the newsgroup we don&#x27;t really 
reach consensus about much--good thing we don&#x27;t have to make 
decisions!).  Another benefit is that if a large group of people 
don&#x27;t like the way things are going, there&#x27;s a clear path to 
selecting new leadership.  

In fact, in the USA you can&#x27;t even start a non-profit organization 
without these things: clear rules, clearly defined procedures for 
setting and changing the rules, clearly defined membership, and clear 
methods for selecting leadership from among those members.

If anyone&#x27;s interested, I&#x27;ve set up a non-profit organization before 
and would be happy to answer any questions about them... just email 
me at adam @ slate.net.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

I agree with you on this one, but not completely.

I think every FINAL should have the same format: average of 5 attempts,
removing best and worst (like in Toronto).

For the first rounds it should be either &#x27;best of 3&#x27; or &#x27;average of 5&#x27;. This
depends on several factors. The most important thing is that we want ALL
competitors to do some cubing. Many come a long way to compete, so every
competitor deserves as many solves as possible. My idea would be: if there
is time, then always do &#x27;average of 5&#x27;. If the time schedule is tight or if
it is a local competition without many people coming a long way, then &#x27;best
of 3&#x27; is also fine.

We also have to agree on POP&#x27;s. I think in &#x27;best of&#x27; competitions, we
shouldn&#x27;t allow POP&#x27;s.
For &#x27;average of&#x27; competitions one POP should be allowed.

Have fun,

Ron

It&#x27;s good that you bring this up because I was wondering about it also.  Hopefully we can 
agree on something soon so that the US and European championships follow the same 
format.

The reason that I made the final around an average of 6 is because it allows the cuber in 
the end to have 12 solves which can all be averaged together.  I was hoping to create a 
new record category which would be &quot;fastest average&quot; and would consist of what we 
normally do on speedcubing.com which is 12 solves, omit the fastest and slowest time.  
With 5 solves and averaging the middle 3, I don&#x27;t necessarily believe that it takes enough 
data points.  Further more, then are solves done in all the other rounds just not 
considered?  That seems like a loss a bit... if a person is able to have 5 consecutive solves 
on the stage which are really fast but then don&#x27;t count because they were in a different 
round.

We all can agree that the &quot;fastest&quot; solve is a rather meaningless record.  Everyone solves 
the cube with a different method and even though we standardize the scramble, a solve 
will be lucky for some people and not lucky for others.  We can do as much as we want to 
make this fair but in the end, there stiill is a little bit of luck.  That&#x27;s why I believe than for 
an &quot;average&quot; record, an average of 12 cubes would be more representative of the cuber&#x27;s 
skills.  Of course, this presents the problems of the cuber actually solving 12 cubes and 
that&#x27;s why I put 6 solves into the final round.

I don&#x27;t agree with an average of 3 competition.  The probability of two lucky times in a row 
is far higher than 10 lucky times in a row.  There are no true probability values for 
luckiness but it is clear that the more solve, the more accurate the measurement of a 
cuber&#x27;s ability.  If a competition must be held as a best of 3 competition in the finals, then 
perhaps we should not create a new record category for that.

As for all competitors being given the same number of solves, I don&#x27;t see how a 
tournament with 5 solves each round is any more fair than a tournament with 3 solves in 
the first two rounds and more solves in the last.  As per round, every competitor was given 
the same fair chance to advance to the next round.  The only drawback is that not every 
competitor is given a chance to compete for the record.  Everyone deserves as many solves 
as possible but from an organizational point, it&#x27;s very hard to give everyone in the 
tournament 12 (or 15) solves.

As for pops, I would like to hear your reasoning.  (Sorry if that sounds a bit &quot;mean&quot;)  In a 
round where people are ranked by averages, I did not allow pops because of the following 
reasoning.  First of all, it was the final round so it could be a bit more strict.  Competitors 
on the speedcubing community are subjected to the (1 pop per 12 solves rule) which is far 
less than 1 pop per 6.  And of course, I did say no pop so where that that pop come from?  
The second reason is that a pop in an average is discarded.  People, if given an extra 
chance in the final round, have the possibility (and I hope no one does this) to pop on 
purpose and make it look like an accident which should not be allowed.  I had a bunch of 
young kids in my winter tournament who were practicing intentional pops.  In a best of 
competition, which I held in the earlier rounds, I allowed one pop because it won&#x27;t affect 
the standings unless the next solves is indeed the fastest solves.  In an average, the pop 
will affect the standings as long as the next solves is faster than the slowest solve.

Anyway, the development of our different set of tournament format arises of course 
because of the different needs and ideas each tournament had.  It would be really nice if 
by the end of May, we can agree on something.  My main idea is that I would like to 
establish the &quot;average&quot; record as an average of 12 and not 5.  I&#x27;m not sure how people feel 
about this but I just think think than an average o 12 is more representative of our cubing 
abilitiies.

I misread what you wrote about best of 3 if there are time constraints.  I agree with that... 
though of course, I don&#x27;t agree with the total number of solves that arises when a 
competition has 5 solves per round.

(Where I go to school, the pour a picture of ice water on you for that.)

I also believe that the organizer of the tournament should not compete.  This is just to 
maintain the integrity of the tournament.  This first came out for the winter tournament 
when I was buying a stackmat timer for the first place winner.  Even though I knew there 
was no chance in the world that I would have a faster time than Macky or Lars Petrus, I did 
not want to compete because I didn&#x27;t want it to seem like (or have any chance of seeming 
like) I was running a tournament, taking entry fees, and then competiting for the prize 
back.

It&#x27;s also very sketchy to say that the organizer has an objective view of the solves also.  
Even if someone else has prepared the solves and scrambled the cubes, what is to happen 
when a problem arises and the organizer has to make a decision?  If he is competing in the 
tournament, he may make a biased decision.  I just feel it&#x27;s safer to keep the organizer out 
of the competition.

Of course this means a sacrifice for the organizer but hey, someone has to do it.  It 
shouldn&#x27;t be impossible to find one person who&#x27;s willing to sit out so that 30 other people 
can have a fun cube competition.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

Short reaction on this one: I see no reason why the organizer cannot
compete.
As long as the rules and the format were decided BEFORE the competition, and
everyone will have an independent judge.
The organizer is not THE judge!!! He can be A judge for someone during the
competition.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">One of the reasons some sort of committee is needed is that any tournament
or other event (e.g charity solve) that wants to have acceptable record
attempts should have to inform, and get itself approved by, the committee
before the event.

Agree with a lot of the stuff in Adam&#x27;s post.

Anyway I look forward to seeing other peoples ideas on criteria for WRs and
if I get time I might put something up myself for further discussion.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

That was a long in-depth reaction! ;-)

About the pops. My reasoning is this:
In a &#x27;best of&#x27; competition any of the cubes can be the best. So if you have
a pop, then it is just bad luck. But you can still proceed if you set a good
time with one of the other cubes.
In an &#x27;average of&#x27; competition every cube counts (even the worst cube
counts, because then you cannot have another bad cube!). In that case your
complete result can be influenced by a pop.

About the average of 12.
Although an average of 12 is a very good means to compare speedcubers, I
think an average of 5 is good enough for a competition.
The winner of a competition is the winner of the final. Not the most
consistent cuber of the competition. I felt very sorry for Lars this
weekend. He deserved to win considering his first round and semi final. But
in the final it is different. Just take a look at the results in Toronto:
the numbers 6, 7 and 8 of the semi final were the numbers 1, 2 and 3 in the
final. So anything can happen under pressure!!!

Macky&#x27;s average of 12 in Caltech Spring tournament was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
Still I did not automatically post it on the record list, because it
probably weren&#x27;t 12 CONSECUTIVE solves. He may probably do even better next
time.

Any world ranking is a choice between absolute certainty (we could only do
100 cube averages) and practical issues (time, media attractiveness, early
decisions in a competition, concentration level of competitors). I am afraid
Toronto set the standards for this. And I think the standards are fine.

Anyway, this is just my personal opinion.

Have fun!

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

Yeah, I had just woken up.  Had nothing to do until lunch so I thought I&#x27;d write a bit more 
than usual ;-)

... this is why we could use a committee to decide on a standard format.  If Toronto did set 
the standard, then our competitions should be 3 solves, 3 solves, then 5 solves.  What was 
the pop standard in Toronto?  My understand is that they were not recorded in the times 
or records... I think it would be a good idea to record pops just for formality.

Anyway, I&#x27;d be willing to go along with whatever people thinks is best... gosh, we could 
really use that committee.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

I hereby propose that you (one of the main competition organizers), Chris
(creator of this club and senior content contributor and world championship
one-handed solving) and I (just a non US cube fool, and a good person to
raise the average age) form a board of a to be established WSU (world
speedcubing union). I am sure we can also rely on Dave Hedley Jones from
Seven Towns (RCC) and Adam Slate (experience in this kind of stuff).
Once we have things set up a little, we can have a voting among members
about a new board and to establish the goals and rules of the WSU.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

   I think that having the first, second, and final rounds add to 12
solves is brilliant.

   If there is to be a requirement that the 12 solves be consecutive,
then I vote for including no inspection contests. Twelve cubes (of the
competitor&#x27;s color scheme) are scrambled and covered with a cloth, 
and the competitor solves all twelve in one go. There can be a start
and go with the timer, and it can be videotaped to get the time of
each solve.  You alreadyt know I prefer the *whole* solve for timing
and records, but I seem to be a minority of one in this.

   Because this would require many excellent cubes, among other
things, I don&#x27;t think it will happen. Anyway, lacking that, I don&#x27;t
think the 12 solves need to be consecutive.

   Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">&gt;    If there is to be a requirement that the 12 solves be <br>
consecutive,<br>
&gt; then I vote for including no inspection contests. Twelve cubes (of <br>
the<br>
&gt; competitor&#x27;s color scheme) are scrambled and covered with a cloth, <br>
&gt; and the competitor solves all twelve in one go. There can be a <br>
start<br>
&gt; and go with the timer, and it can be videotaped to get the time of<br>
&gt; each solve.  You alreadyt know I prefer the *whole* solve for <br>
timing<br>
&gt; and records, but I seem to be a minority of one in this.<br>
<br>
*snip*<br>
<br>
Hey David you gave me an idea with this.  Although Guinness isn&#x27;t <br>
interested in &quot;off-the-wall&quot; cube categories perhaps we can include <br>
these in the official rules definitions, when those get created I <br>
mean.  There should be a provision that people can get an official <br>
witness (or 3rd party witness), perhaps media coverage if it is a <br>
very difficult or amazing attempt, and set official records.  So we <br>
could have and recognize an officiale underwater record, or an <br>
official unicycle record.  We could also do the 12 solves in a row <br>
record, and officially recognize it.  Personally I&#x27;d be interested <br>
in attempting the 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5 supercube official <br>
records :)<br>
<br>
There would most likely not be time to do these categories at <br>
official contests, so we would have to allow people to attempt these <br>
on their own time under a very strict set of official rules (just <br>
like Guinness does).  Personally I think it could only be a good <br>
thing to allow people to practice fun records and attempt them <br>
officially.<br>
<br>
This brings me to one more issue.  If we do start getting a lot of <br>
people doing official attempts (if it ever comes to that I mean), <br>
perhaps we can have an official magazine mailing to all members.  <br>
This could include articles about recent cube sightings, cube math, <br>
solving robots, and also an official records adendum.<br>
<br>
I think it would be awesome to have a monthly newsletter/mailout <br>
that people could subscribe to.  They have one for chess, why not us <br>
too?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I really like the idea of having an official organization, and it 
seems that a lot of other people do to.  Since it seems that it is 
something a lot of people are interested in, I would love to help 
out for getting this started.  I like Ron&#x27;s idea of having a few 
people at first just to get the thing started, but shortly 
thereafter letting all the members vote on who they think would be 
good board members to continue the work.  I would love to help get 
an organization like this started and on its feet.  Adam, Tyson, 
Dave, are you guys interested?

We could start off by hosting an official section off 
speedcubing.com, but then move it to its own official site.  This 
would be like having http://www.speedstacks.com, but also having 
http://www.worldcupstackingassociation.org like in the cup stacking 
community.

If no one is opposed to this, I&#x27;d love to at least help this thing 
get started.  I figure the first people can just set up how the WSU 
itself will be organized and how members can apply.  Once we figure 
that out we can have members vote on who will be the board members 
to decide the official rules for records/competitions/etc..

Sound good?

Hi Chris<br>
<br>
There was a Rubik&#x27;s Cube newsletter in 1982/1983, this was the <br>
newsletter of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube club from Ideal. <br>
Some of the news in these newsletter:<br>
An article of a Rubik&#x27;s solving robot Robbie Robot build by Tau Beta <br>
Phi at University of Illinouis, Dan Talken was one of the engieers in <br>
aug 1982!<br>
<br>
I gues since we are now more on the internet we could publish <br>
a &quot;magazine&quot; online like my first page on my part of the site<br>
 www.speedcubing.com/ton <br>
<br>
A mailout newsletter requires a club and members fees<br>

          <div class="email-content">We had a discussion about this a year or so ago. But no one carried 
through with it....
I would love to have an official World Speed Cubing Association. But 
it seems like no one wants to do the work to get it started.
Darn.

          <div class="email-content">This sounds like a good idea.  Also keeping it small at the start.  I, like
a lot of others, would be happy to help out either at the start or
eventually.  Assume speedcubing is being used to refer to everything we
discuss here (fewest moves etc).

Magazines always take a lot of effort although generally worthwhile.  I
guess if someone is prepared to post articles in an on-line magazine and
others are prepared to contribute that wouldn&#x27;t be so difficult.

The Guinness group isn&#x27;t interested in record off the 3x3x3 cube
because they accepted my 3x3x3 blindfold record (3:56) as an 
official world record and rejected the 4x4x4 blindfold record 
(22:35) becuase according to them they aren&#x27;t interested in record 
that wasn&#x27;t done on a standard cube.

However, I think the proposed board should probably
consist of:
one hessport associate
one seventowns associate
and the rest of the wc2k3 advisory board positions
then regional associates (preferably champions) from
the speedcubing community USA, as well as associates
from participating countries (large countries may send
regional associates as necessary) 
no telling to what extent these delegations will
handle, from the creation of a global tournament
resource allocation task force to advisory boards for
marketing, public relations, and community
maintenance.

Definitely the other records can be kept on rubiks.com and I&#x27;m sure<br>
speedcubing.com will be happy with this too. From what I gather the current<br>
non-official records of the non 3x3 cube are on a &quot;trust&quot; basis which is<br>
also fine although to be official I do think a witness or news coverage<br>
would mean we could make them official.<br>

<br>
&gt;    If there is to be a requirement that the 12 solves be <br>
consecutive,<br>
&gt; then I vote for including no inspection contests. Twelve cubes (of <br>
the<br>
&gt; competitor&#x27;s color scheme) are scrambled and covered with a cloth, <br>
&gt; and the competitor solves all twelve in one go. There can be a <br>
start<br>
&gt; and go with the timer, and it can be videotaped to get the time of<br>
&gt; each solve.  You alreadyt know I prefer the *whole* solve for <br>
timing<br>
&gt; and records, but I seem to be a minority of one in this.<br>
<br>
*snip*<br>
<br>
Hey David you gave me an idea with this.  Although Guinness isn&#x27;t <br>
interested in &quot;off-the-wall&quot; cube categories perhaps we can include <br>
these in the official rules definitions, when those get created I <br>
mean.  There should be a provision that people can get an official <br>
witness (or 3rd party witness), perhaps media coverage if it is a <br>
very difficult or amazing attempt, and set official records.  So we <br>
could have and recognize an officiale underwater record, or an <br>
official unicycle record.  We could also do the 12 solves in a row <br>
record, and officially recognize it.  Personally I&#x27;d be interested <br>
in attempting the 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5 supercube official <br>
records :)<br>
<br>
There would most likely not be time to do these categories at <br>
official contests, so we would have to allow people to attempt these <br>
on their own time under a very strict set of official rules (just <br>
like Guinness does).  Personally I think it could only be a good <br>
thing to allow people to practice fun records and attempt them <br>
officially.<br>
<br>
This brings me to one more issue.  If we do start getting a lot of <br>
people doing official attempts (if it ever comes to that I mean), <br>
perhaps we can have an official magazine mailing to all members.  <br>
This could include articles about recent cube sightings, cube math, <br>
solving robots, and also an official records adendum.<br>
<br>
I think it would be awesome to have a monthly newsletter/mailout <br>
that people could subscribe to.  They have one for chess, why not us <br>
too?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all.

Seven Towns has been the representative of Erno Rubik since the beginning,
as you know interest has seen an increase in the last few years and the
sheer scale of work at Seven Towns (we invent lots of games and toys sold
all over the world) mean&#x27;s they needed someone to co=ordinate all of the
activity on Rubik&#x27;s. This is where I come in!
My primary responsibility is helping the companies who sell the cube
(marketing, promotion etc), supporting competitions and any other events
plus development and so on. As a result of this I joined the group  as you
are all such an important part of Rubik&#x27;s. so that&#x27;s the background..

I think Ron&#x27;s idea of a WCU is great, Initially I would be happy to be
involved until a proper voted committee can be established. 

My thoughts: 

I think a magazine would probably involve way too much work unless someone
volunteers.

Pop-ups is a question that I have been thinking about recently, one of the
dangers is that if a competitor is having a &quot;bad&quot; solve they can
accidentally pop and get this discounted. Assuming that we are all
trustworthy (of course!) I think allowing one pop-up discounted per Heat is
fair in a round of three/five and the competitor gets an extra solve, if two
in a round of three the competitor is disqualified. If two in a round of
five then the highest score is duplicated and three in a round of five =
disqualified. Just a thought for opinion..does this make sense?

Another problem (that came up in France) is how twisted the final layer can
be when it is placed on the mat/table at the end. Personally I think the
cube should be completely square as anything else becomes subjective to the
individual judge ?

Thanks
Dave

Hi Tyson,

That was a long in-depth reaction! ;-)

About the pops. My reasoning is this:
In a &#x27;best of&#x27; competition any of the cubes can be the best. So if you have
a pop, then it is just bad luck. But you can still proceed if you set a good
time with one of the other cubes.
In an &#x27;average of&#x27; competition every cube counts (even the worst cube
counts, because then you cannot have another bad cube!). In that case your
complete result can be influenced by a pop.

About the average of 12.
Although an average of 12 is a very good means to compare speedcubers, I
think an average of 5 is good enough for a competition.
The winner of a competition is the winner of the final. Not the most
consistent cuber of the competition. I felt very sorry for Lars this
weekend. He deserved to win considering his first round and semi final. But
in the final it is different. Just take a look at the results in Toronto:
the numbers 6, 7 and 8 of the semi final were the numbers 1, 2 and 3 in the
final. So anything can happen under pressure!!!

Macky&#x27;s average of 12 in Caltech Spring tournament was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
Still I did not automatically post it on the record list, because it
probably weren&#x27;t 12 CONSECUTIVE solves. He may probably do even better next
time.

Any world ranking is a choice between absolute certainty (we could only do
100 cube averages) and practical issues (time, media attractiveness, early
decisions in a competition, concentration level of competitors). I am afraid
Toronto set the standards for this. And I think the standards are fine.

Anyway, this is just my personal opinion.

Have fun!

Ron

          <div class="email-content">As cool as double U, S, U sounds, did anyone consider the world association or federation?  
It just sounds like a work union but that&#x27;s just me being stupid.

As for how &quot;twisted&quot; the last layer can be when a competitor is done, for the Caltech 
tournament, I tried to come up with a very objective way of deciding this.  Some people 
like to say 45 degrees but that&#x27;s very hard to do unless you eyeball it.  If you take a cube, 
you can twist one side until the edge of one corner meets the edge of one edge.  Uh... to 
get a better idea of this... this was my critera for a solved cube.  This is the farthest a cube 
was allowed to be for the Caltech competition:

http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/caltechrubiks/vwp?.dir=/
&amp;.src=gr&amp;.dnm=IMG_0449.jpg&amp;.view=t&amp;.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/
group/caltechrubiks/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%26.view=t

I&#x27;m not very fond of the idea of duplicating the highest time.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem right to 
write down a time when there isn&#x27;t a solve recorded.  Also... though it&#x27;s rare, and we 
should account for all rare possibilities, it is possible that a cuber uses this to their 
advantage.  Frank Morris I believe once recorded an average with a spread of about 1.7 
seconds or something.

Hi Kelley,

for a beginner that&#x27;s a pretty good time. The records are around 10 
seconds, though. The three keys to get there are of course

- Practice. Not nearly as much as necessary to become an elite 3x3 
solver, though. I think anyone can get there in a week or so.

- A good system. I describe mine (has a minor bug which I&#x27;ll fix 
soon) at http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/speedsolving/clock

- A good clock ;-) The best clock I have is borrowed from a friend, 
my own one isn&#x27;t as smooth.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I also believe that the organizer of the tournament should not <br>
compete.  This is just to <br>
&gt; maintain the integrity of the tournament.  This first came out for <br>
the winter tournament <br>
&gt; when I was buying a stackmat timer for the first place winner.  <br>
Even though I knew there <br>
&gt; was no chance in the world that I would have a faster time than <br>
Macky or Lars Petrus, I did <br>
&gt; not want to compete because I didn&#x27;t want it to seem like (or have <br>
any chance of seeming <br>
&gt; like) I was running a tournament, taking entry fees, and then <br>
competiting for the prize <br>
&gt; back.<br>
<br>
If you pay the entry fee as well this might solve this problem. Then <br>
you&#x27;ve put just as much money in it as everybody else (probably some <br>
more and also lots of time).<br>

          <div class="email-content">bah, whats the drive in taking this to a new thread jasmine? Oh well, anywho, not the point. Union does sound like a &quot;trade union&quot; but really, since this isnt a trade, who is going to confuse it with a trade union!? I could make arguments that we arent an activist group or a trade federation either, like the ASPCA, or the FTF. So where do you draw the line? However, if Association or Federation make more sense to a majority of cubers, then why not, eh?
 
Im fine with WSU, WSA, or WSF, we just neeeed to coagulate somehow.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; The second reason is that a pop in an average is discarded.  <br>
People, if given an extra <br>
&gt; chance in the final round, have the possibility (and I hope no one <br>
does this) to pop on <br>
&gt; purpose and make it look like an accident which should not be <br>
allowed.  I had a bunch of <br>
&gt; young kids in my winter tournament who were practicing intentional <br>
pops.<br>
<br>
Also, it doesn&#x27;t even have to be intentional! You could exploit the <br>
pop rule *without* intentional pops.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s say you usually solve a bit safer to prevent pops. Let&#x27;s say <br>
you notice while solving that you&#x27;ll have a bad time. Why not speed <br>
up then, *risking* a pop because you know if it happens it won&#x27;t <br>
count? With the honest goal of &quot;being a bit faster&quot;, not the goal <br>
of &quot;having a pop so it doesn&#x27;t count&quot;. I myself would never cause an <br>
intentional pop but I can imagine myself to speed up and risk one.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t like pops for either of the two recording methods (best-of <br>
and average). They are and always will be problematic.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Macky&#x27;s average of 12 in Caltech Spring tournament was ABSOLUTELY <br>
FANTASTIC!<br>
&gt; Still I did not automatically post it on the record list, because <br>
it<br>
&gt; probably weren&#x27;t 12 CONSECUTIVE solves.<br>
<br>
What exactly does &quot;consecutive&quot; mean? That is, what am I allowed to <br>
do between two solves?<br>
<br>
- Can I take a break? Drink something? Talk to somebody?<br>
- Can I solve a different puzzle?<br>
- Can I practice an algorithm? You know, when I practice a 3-cycle <br>
three times then I&#x27;ll *solve* the cube as well. I could of course <br>
practice it while scrambling to avoid this but it really shouldn&#x27;t <br>
make a difference.<br>
<br>
I think as long as the 12 solves are 12 consecutive &quot;this-will-<br>
count&quot; solves then everything is fine. With this I mean that you <br>
declare before scrambling that the time will count for the average.<br>

And Kyle, in answer to your question, this is the other reason why I 
renamed the subject line in my earlier post. I was only replying to 
one small part of Tyson&#x27;s post, so removed the loooong string of 
previous conversation and renamed it.

Happy cubing, :)

WSCA
World Speed Cubing Association

ISCO
International Speed Cubing Organization (I think this was it)

I prefer ISCO, because the World Cup Stacking Association is called 
WCSA. It&#x27;s too similar.

But we shouldn&#x27;t waste too much time worrying about the name, we 
should try to get this whole thing organized first.

          <div class="email-content">hey all,<br>
I&#x27;ve just beat my PB a few minutes ago, and I was wondering if it had to be considered as lucky or not. I had a very easy F2L, like one of the pairs already &quot;together&quot; on the D layer, then only one OLL (I use to do one OLL in 15 cases and the rest of the time 2 OLL) and at the end a very fast PLL (edge 3-cycle). Then I look up at the screen and see (how wonderful) an amazing time (for me) of 18.46. That means, I beat the French record!!! OK, I didn&#x27;t beat it officially, but my friends don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s official or not... Anyway, can somebody tell me if I was lucky (sure I was to get such an easy cube, but can I consider this solve as my PB?)?<br>

PS: In case someone wants to do it too, the scrambling alg was: L² R² F&#x27; R U F&#x27; D² B&#x27; R² B&#x27; D L² F L R² U&#x27; F U² F&#x27; R D&#x27; L F D&#x27; L². U was yellow, F was blue.<br>

World Speed Cubing Association would be my preferance, too bad the

How about &quot;World Speed Cubing Federation?&quot; I know some of you don&#x27;t

rule. (You get a resolve if the cube is over this boundary in early <br>
rounds.) There are many ways to which this can be exploited <br>
obviously, but since it was the same all around, it was somewhat <br>
fair.<br>
<br>
I really don&#x27;t agree with the +2sec rule, as I feel +1sec is more <br>
then enough to compensate for these things. One of the major <br>
ambiguities in this issue that I noticed none of you rasied, is that <br>
perhaps the cube was solved in less then say 45deg but had an <br>
unlucky twist when dropped by the competitor? (this was disscused at <br>
Toronto a bit) That example isn&#x27;t too disastrous for judging..., now <br>
what if it was over the borderline, buy had a Lucky bounce!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Not sure who&#x27;s heard my thoughs on pops before... In a best 10 of 12 
average there&#x27;s *already* a provision for a pop, in that you can 
throw out one of your times.  So, If I&#x27;m doing a best of 12 and don&#x27;t 
have pops because I take a more conservative approach in my solving 
technique, then I throw out my slowest time.  If you are more risky 
and are thus prone to pops, then you throw out your pop.  That way we 
both get 12 tries... rather than you getting 13 simply because you 
have taken a greater risk by loosening your cube more or turning a 
slice of the cube before the previous slice is fully in place.

Adam

I&#x27;d be glad to help.  I also see the need for some national 
associations, for larger countries, to help organize and officiate at 
the national and subnational level, but obviously that&#x27;s a separate 
issues that can be determined by each country, much like there&#x27;s a 
Intl Olympic Committee and then national olympic commitees.

          <div class="email-content">It requires WORK and operating funds.  An association is a type of 
company, and is subject to certain laws and requires some 
incorporation costs.  Then there&#x27;s additional work/cost to attain non-
profit status so you get certain benefits tax-wise, etc.

Another wrinkle, I&#x27;m not sure how international corps work.  Maybe 
you just pick a country in which to incorporate?  We&#x27;ll need to look 
into it.

<br>
That&#x27;s true... the pop rule could be exploited but in that case, it <br>
seems more like a natural consequence of speedcubing.  Being able to <br>
solve a bit faster without worrying about (I&#x27;m dead if I pop again) is <br>
kind of like the first serve vs. the second serve in tennis.  The first <br>
one, people can hit as hard as they want.  The second one, they have to <br>
get it in.  It may just be inherent to the sport of speedcubing.<br>

&gt; &gt; The second reason is that a pop in an average is discarded.�<br>

&gt;  does this) to pop on<br>
&gt;  &gt; purpose and make it look like an accident which should not be<br>
&gt;  allowed.� I had a bunch of<br>
&gt;  &gt; young kids in my winter tournament who were practicing intentional<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;  Also, it doesn&#x27;t even have to be intentional! You could exploit the<br>
&gt;  pop rule *without* intentional pops.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  Let&#x27;s say you usually solve a bit safer to prevent pops. Let&#x27;s say<br>
&gt;  you notice while solving that you&#x27;ll have a bad time. Why not speed<br>
&gt;  up then, *risking* a pop because you know if it happens it won&#x27;t<br>
&gt;  count? With the honest goal of &quot;being a bit faster&quot;, not the goal<br>
&gt;  of &quot;having a pop so it doesn&#x27;t count&quot;. I myself would never cause an<br>
&gt;  intentional pop but I can imagine myself to speed up and risk one.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  I don&#x27;t like pops for either of the two recording methods (best-of<br>
&gt;  and average). They are and always will be problematic.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s what I like to think also.  As long as you say, I will count <br>
this solve... and now I will count this solve, it&#x27;s the same thing as <br>
12 consecutive solves.  There&#x27;s no proof that practicing between solves <br>
will help.  What if someone&#x27;s on a roll?  What if he&#x27;s not?  There&#x27;s <br>
nothing that prevents a long jumper from jumping around a bit between <br>
attempts.<br>
<br>
I think that as long as the solves are within one &quot;session,&quot;  then it&#x27;s <br>
okay.  It would be a bit awkward to get a good solve, take a day break, <br>
keep solving until you&#x27;re doing really well, then do another solve a <br>
day later.  Criteria for something like this could be established by <br>
the WS(U,F,A).<br>

&gt;  What exactly does &quot;consecutive&quot; mean? That is, what am I allowed to<br>
&gt;  do between two solves?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  - Can I take a break? Drink something? Talk to somebody?<br>
&gt;  - Can I solve a different puzzle?<br>
&gt;  - Can I practice an algorithm? You know, when I practice a 3-cycle<br>
&gt;  three times then I&#x27;ll *solve* the cube as well. I could of course<br>
&gt;  practice it while scrambling to avoid this but it really shouldn&#x27;t<br>
&gt;  make a difference.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  I think as long as the 12 solves are 12 consecutive &quot;this-will-<br>
&gt;  count&quot; solves then everything is fine. With this I mean that you<br>
&gt;  declare before scrambling that the time will count for the average.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s sweet!  You shouldn&#x27;t worry about whether your fastest solve was <br>
lucky or not because chances are, everyone&#x27;s fastest solve is &quot;lucky&quot; <br>

though nothing is skipped.<br>

And here&#x27;s the other thing... just think to yourself, it really doesn&#x27;t <br>

&gt; to do one OLL in 15 cases and the rest of the time 2 OLL) and at the <br>
&gt; end a very fast PLL (edge 3-cycle). Then I look up at the screen and <br>
&gt; see (how wonderful) an amazing time (for me) of 18.46. That means, I <br>
&gt; beat the French record!!! OK, I didn&#x27;t beat it officially, but my <br>
&gt; friends don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s official or not... Anyway, can somebody <br>
&gt; tell me if I was lucky (sure I was to get such an easy cube, but can I <br>
&gt; consider this solve as my PB?)?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s true that making one turn of the cube probably only takes at most <br>
half a second, but I think the rule for being one twist off should not <br>
only compensate for the &quot;cheated&quot; time, but it should also mildly <br>
&quot;punish&quot; the time.  A fair estimate of the time gained is about one <br>
second.  If you were to accidentally not move the cube far enough, move <br>
the cube away from you, notice that one face isn&#x27;t quite there, and <br>
then try to adjust it with your hand, it would take about one second.  <br>
The second second (haha) seeks to punish the time a little bit because <br>
a solve that&#x27;s one move away isn&#x27;t as good/clean as a solve that&#x27;s just <br>
put down solved.  If two people were to receive times one second off <br>
but one person was 14 + 1 seconds and the other was 15, I think that <br>
the 15 second solve was &quot;faster&quot;.<br>
<br>
Backup timers are quite important.  For one solve, there was a timer <br>
failure in our Spring tournament.  At the end of the solve, I gave the <br>
competitor either the option of accepting the time on the stopwatch or <br>
taking a new solve.  As for the cube bouncing a bit and then turning <br>
itself a bit, Macky did this in the winter tournament.  The judges had <br>
ruled that the cube had indeed been placed down completely solved... <br>
though an issue like that I believe would have to be looked at more <br>
closely.<br>

Hi Duncan,

  At first I was for one or two pop, but now I tend to agree with you.
Being able to be fast *and* accurate is a major part of what it&#x27;s all
about isn&#x27;t it? 

   Generally speaking, you wouldn&#x27;t declare a &quot;lucky solve&quot; and throw
it out would you? The whole idea of throwing out the fastest and
slowest time out of twelve solves is to deal with lucky solves and
very unlucky solves. Well isn&#x27;t a pop an very unlucky solve?

   Anyway, I think taking the middle 10 out of 12 - no if, ands, buts,
or pops, is the way to go.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">If the last layer is twisted under 45 degrees, it should definately 
be considered solved. If it&#x27;s more than 45 adding a second or 2 
seems fair (1.5?). I don&#x27;t think this could be exploited. But what 
if the LL is twisted say 90 degrees and the 2nd to last layer 
twisted under 45 degrees? Should that be considered a move from 
solved and 2 secs be added? And also if each layer of a 5x5x5 is 
twisted 40 degrees to the left of the one below it, is it solved? 
This would mean the top layer is 80 off from the center and 160 from 
the bottom. I&#x27;m getting too detailed but this is why we need a WSA
(my favorite) or whatever it&#x27;s called!

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t post much but thought I would on this pop issue.  It makes 
sense to somehow deal with them since they do happen for various 
reasons.  In early rounds of competition, I think since we count 
lucky times, we should also count unlucky times as well.  Since the 
first round or two is usually the fastest solve of say 3 or 5 cubes, 
that gives enough chances to allow for a pop.  If someone or 
the &#x27;federation&#x27; comes up with a tournament bracket standard, I&#x27;d 
like to see the best of 5 cubes always used for early rounds.  That 
should give enough slack for even 1 or 2 pops and still leave enough 
chances to get a quick time.  (I&#x27;ve never been to a competition, so I 
may not know what I&#x27;m talking about.)  (Also include the option of 
someone keeping a &#x27;popped&#x27; time in case they can reassemble and 
finish quick.  Who knows, maybe someone has a &#x27;pop&#x27; strategy for 
solving?)

As far as the average competition for the finals, there should be at 
least an extra slot or 2 available.  Maybe solve 6 cubes and remove 
the fastest and 2 slowest?  If someone uses them up, add 50% to their 
slowest time and use that or some other &#x27;slowest time&#x27; penalty.  

And yes, any time achieved in competition even in qualification 
rounds should be considered a record.  As long as the scramble and 
timing criteria is met and it is in a competition environment.  
Another reason to have world wide agreed standards.0

I&#x27;m excited this speed cubing thing is growing.  It&#x27;s a great hobby 
but still very hard to explain to someone...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

Yes, an average record in any round is a record.
But the winner of the final is the winner.

I think we are mixing things up for the 5 and 12 cubes. Your idea of the 12
cubes to determine an OFFICIAL average FOR A COMPETITION is an interesting
idea.
But for the current UNOFFICIAL world records, the current rules state that
the 12 cubes must be 12 consecutive cubes. That is why I didn&#x27;t post Macky&#x27;s
fantastic performance..
That said, take a look at the current world ranking average. Even with 5
cubes the best is on top. So who needs to have 12? ;-)

About one face not being completely aligned in a competition.
This happens a lot to me with the Stackmat timer and a smooth cube. It has
nothing to do with not finishing the last move (in that case it would be a
full quarter turn). It is just that you drop your cube too fast. I think >45
degrees is one move and therefore 2 extra seconds.

Have fun!

Ron

Unfortunately, there is no real exact way of measuring 45 degrees <br>
without taking out some sort of device and even then, most likely it is <br>
being eyeballed.  The boundary that I set at the April tournament is <br>
slightly less than 45 degrees (pretty close... maybe about 38) and <br>

What do you think?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson, Ron, et al,

   We seem to be mixing up themes: there are actually two competitions
- the fastest solve and the fastest average. I&#x27;m not at all clear
which each of you is talking about. 

   In January, at Caltech, rounds one and two were for the best time
you could do that round. OK. The final round was the best average of 5
 solves. But wasn&#x27;t the winner in 1982 World competition based on the
best time, not the best average?

   My problem is that someone could break the world record three times
in each of the first and second rounds and make mistakes and lose in
the final round on average. I think the fastest solves should also be
credited along with the fastest average. What do you think?

          <div class="email-content">Hi David,

Yes, fastest time and fastest average are good means to rank people. That is
why I made two world rankings. ;-)

The good thing about making a 5 cube average ranking and having several
rounds in that format, is that we have many people on that ranking. With a
12 cube ranking we would only have finalists on the ranking... I really
think &#x27;average of 5&#x27; rounds are perfect: not too long, still good enough to
rank people.
In 10 years, when we have 100 competitions a year, in several countries, we
may decide to have more cubes per round, to have better precision. (But now
I am dreaming about that to happen...). The thing is that everyone deserves
a chance, not only the best. We should take better care of the newcomers,
because they are the ones who should make our sports grow. It is fun!
Oh, and don&#x27;t forget to cherish the event organizers!

I think we shouldn&#x27;t worry too much about someone setting a record and still
lose in the final. That happens in any sports.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

I have a new idea about this &quot;twisted&quot; controversy. Most cubist can 
easily solve a cube in those 1-2-3-4 or even 5 moves that a cube 
might be from completion. So why not simply add 1 sec for each move 
that was not performed towards completion? Or possibly 2 that i 
personally think is too strict. And one could also say that 2 or 3 
moves is an absolute maximum number of moves allowed to be from the 
solved state, in order to still be regarded as a solve. Practicing 
this might be more elaborate and would require that a &quot;cubist&quot; is 
watching all ofiicial solves in case to judge how many moves from 
solution it was when dropped early. And in addition 1 sec per move is 
much slower than a speedcuber could have performed them so it 
wouldn&#x27;t make sense to cheat on it. Btw i still agree that 45 degrees 
or more should count as 1 move. So we would need to count 45+ as 1 
move and then any additional move up to a maximum number of allowed 
moves and work out how many seconds to add to the time achieved by 
premature dropping of the cube on the stackmat or other timing 
device. Just some free thoughts ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I really don&#x27;t think that a cube 3 moves away from completion is <br>
anywhere close to being solved.  The competition measures how fast <br>
someone can solve a cube... not get three moves away from it.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s my philosophy on why the 2 second penalty is in place.  When is <br>
the cube solved?  The cube is solved when all of the faces are restored <br>
to their original solid colors and in the strict sense, everything is <br>
lined up perfectly.  In a perfect world, a cube is solved only when it <br>
is returned to a perfect square.<br>
<br>
Okay, we don&#x27;t live in a perfect world and there is human error.  Move <br>
a face a millimeter.  Is the cube still solved?  Sure.  I mean, it&#x27;s <br>
most certainly impossible to line up everything right?  Okay, move it <br>
another millimeter.  Is it still solved?  Probably.  Do this a few <br>
times.  When does the cube become more &quot;one move away&quot; than &quot;solved&quot;?<br>
<br>
I am against the 45 degree rule and instead I am for the standard that <br>
I established at Caltech for a couple of reasons.  For those of you who <br>
don&#x27;t know what my &quot;one move&quot; away standard is, take a solved cube in <br>
the shape of a square and turn one side until the edge of that corner <br>
lines up with the next edge.  If you turn the top side counter <br>
clockwise, it&#x27;s when the edge of the corner meets the &quot;second column&quot;.  <br>
If it goes past the second column, the two second penalty is enforced.<br>
<br>
What would happen at a tournament if a fast solve is completed but a <br>
face is around 45 degrees and those extra two seconds would push a <br>
competitor out from qualifying for the next round?  (I believe this <br>
happened to Eric Liou in the winter.)  Well, we would want very direct <br>
ways of measure whether or not he went past 45 degrees.  When a face is <br>
turned 45 degrees, there isn&#x27;t really any way to measure it without <br>
using outside equipment.  Not having a very easily measurable standard <br>
is dangerous... especially for competition purposes where decision have <br>
to be made quickly and more importantly, solidly.  If a judge is like, <br>
&quot;Eh... that kind looks like it&#x27;s okay...&quot; it&#x27;s not a very sound <br>
competition.  It will be every judge&#x27;s worst nightmare if the standard <br>
is set at 45 degrees... especially if the solve has some significance.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, again, we&#x27;re measuring how fast a cuber can solve the <br>
cube.  The state of the cube being solved should be more towards solved <br>
and not smack right in the absolute middle.  The middle ground is <br>
dangerous and no matter how unlikely the case for something to happen <br>
(though I don&#x27;t think this is so unlikely... it happened a few times at <br>
the Caltech tournaments), the rules must be written in such a matter <br>
that it is prepared for it.<br>
<br>
As for the two second penalty?  It is a penalty and not a compensation. <br>
  This is very much similar to the idea of not using the 45 degree rule. <br>
  The 45 degree rule is on the boundary.  A penalty should not be on the <br>
boundary but should clearly make up for and add a little to the <br>
competitor&#x27;s time for not actually solving the cube.<br>
<br>
Some people may say that these strict rules may add too much <br>
psychological stress and people&#x27;s times will be worse because they have <br>
to be careful to solve the cube completely and not have their cube face <br>
be misaligned past the 2nd column... there is always stress in <br>
competition.  We pay a price of stress and in return, we should get a <br>
more solid foundation and defined rules and purposes.  And I don&#x27;t <br>
think stress is impossible to deal with... people just have to learn to <br>
practice solving the cube completely.  Isn&#x27;t that part of the sport?  <br>
isn&#x27;t it also part of the sport to not pop every other solve?<br>

Hey Chris,

   This would mean that the Organization would be a sanctioning body.
I think that&#x27;s a good idea. Without a sanctioning body records go
unnoticed, like the car that broke the speed of sound in 1979.

   I agree that there would likely not be time for &quot;off the wall&quot;
categories during an official contest, so why not have provisions
which allow use of the timers right before or after the event?

   I should mention that I don&#x27;t consider blindfold solving, 3x3x3
supercube, and no-inspection solves &quot;off the wall,&quot; but main line
Rubik&#x27;s cube related events.

   A newsletter or magazine might work very well, but I recommend that
it be entirely electronic. Designing it, updating it, deciding what to
include, etc, are all done much more easily if it&#x27;s online. It can be
printable, with great graphics, and be a lot cheaper. There&#x27;d be the
Organization&#x27;s web page along with the online magazine.

Hey Chris,

This would mean that the Organization would be a sanctioning body.
I think that&#x27;s a good idea. Without a sanctioning body records go
unnoticed, like the car that broke the speed of sound in 1979.

I agree that there would likely not be time for &quot;off the wall&quot;
categories during an official contest, so why not have provisions
which allow use of the timers right before or after the event?

I should mention that I don&#x27;t consider blindfold solving, 3x3x3
supercube, and no-inspection solves &quot;off the wall,&quot; but main line
Rubik&#x27;s cube related events.

A newsletter or magazine might work very well, but I recommend that
it be entirely electronic. Designing it, updating it, deciding what to
include, etc, are all done much more easily if it&#x27;s online. It can be
printable, with great graphics, and be a lot cheaper. There&#x27;d be the
Organization&#x27;s web page along with the online magazine.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">This is getting more and more complicated. One pop allowed? Two? I 
prefer zero not only because I think it&#x27;s fair but because of it&#x27;s 
simplicity. If we decide to have some at all then we have to decide

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I think that as long as the solves are within one &quot;session,&quot;  then <br>
it&#x27;s <br>
&gt; okay.  It would be a bit awkward to get a good solve, take a day <br>
break, <br>
&gt; keep solving until you&#x27;re doing really well, then do another solve <br>
a <br>
&gt; day later.<br>
<br>
Right, the breaks should be reasonable. Not because I think it would <br>
make sense to practice a day in between (if you really got better <br>
then why keep the old bad times?) but because it would just be <br>
awful ;-)<br>
<br>
I think when you do twelve solves in a tournament that lasts a <br>
couple of hours this is consecutive enough. However, I must say <br>
after reading Ron&#x27;s reasoning (more people getting valid averages <br>
and still resulting in a good ranking) that I prefer the average-of-<br>
5 world ranking now.<br>

  It just struck me that allowing a competitor another chance if they
have a pop is rewarding an error, that is to say, they get best 3 out

popper another try and why not give everyone else two more tries? That

solving?  So there&#x27;s no disqualifications, you just lose that <br>

So how about we just treat a pop as a DNF?  If you pop and you can&#x27;t <br>
put it back in and continue, it gets recorded as a pop and you move <br>
on to your next attempt.  So in a best of 3, if you pop all three <br>
times, then you go down as not recording any finished solves, which <br>
would have to mean disqualification.  I can only agree with <br>
disqualification if it meant you popped every solve.  Otherwise, I <br>
think it is way too harsh.<br>
<br>
This method would only work for &quot;best of N tries&quot; type <br>
competitions.  In a final round, average of 5, I think we absolutely <br>
should allow one and only one pop.  If no pops are allowed, you <br>
discourage competitors from taking risks.  If no one ever takes <br>
risks we&#x27;ll never see top rate averages on stage, since everyone <br>
will be solving too carefully.<br>

And you can play &quot;happy go lucky&quot; to an eventual pop will occur.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Evan, it took me a long time to figure out the F2L, about two 
years even with advice from other people.  I&#x27;m still no expert, but 
here are some of the things that helped me the most.

1) Actually go slow:

If you read on the internet about the F2L everybody always says 
go &quot;slow&quot; during the F2L.  If you notice, almost everyone puts 
quotation marks around the word slow when they say it too.  
Basically all this means is yes, go slow but only at the beginning.  
When you first lift you hands off the timer (Stackmat, spacebar, 
button on a stopwatch) grab the cube and start doing the moves for 
the cross, but actually go slow.  Do MAX 1-1.5 turns per second for 
the first 4-5 moves of the cross, and I mean this seriously.  My 
strategy for almost 2 years was to figure out during the pre-
inspection the coolest and most efficient finger tricks to try to do 
the cross at 104 moves/sec turning rate and try to finish it in 0.12 
seconds :) Once you finish the cross though you almost always delay 
to find the first pair (delays = very very very bad during the F2L).

Actually going slow at the start is useful for two reasons.  You 
subconsciously notice where the corner edge pair pieces are around 
the cube.  I&#x27;ve had F2L solves before where I went slow while 
solving the cross and didn&#x27;t feel like I noticed where a pair was, 
but after finishing the cross it&#x27;s like my hands go on automatic to 
start solving the first corner edge pair anyway.  Also, doing this 
means you almost never delay from solving the cross to solving the 
first pair.  Once you have spotted both pieces of the first pair 
(you can usually do this after 4-5 moves of the cross) then start to 
speed back up to your normal F2L twist speed.  So going &quot;slow&quot; means 
yes actually go slow, but really only for the first 4-5 moves.

2) Don&#x27;t ever use finger tricks except for on the last pair

This is the same concept as going &quot;slow&quot;.  If you use finger tricks, 
you move the faces too quickly to watch the pieces.  Sort of like 
for the transition between doing the cross, if you go slightly 
slower than full speed, your brain will notice the general location 
of the F2L pieces subconsciously, such that when you look around you 
tend to spot the pairs quicker.  So to go &quot;slow&quot;, imagine going full 
speed during the F2L ... now just ease off a liiiiittle bit.  During 
the F2L go as fast as you can, but without ever using finger 
tricks.  This will slow you down from your full speed with finger 
tricks enough to watch the pieces.

The exception to this is the last c/e pair.  When you get to the 
last pair, use finger tricks to finish it as fast as you can.  I saw 
Andy Camann recommend this on his website and I tried it.  I have to 
say that I like it, it doesn&#x27;t significantly increase the delay from 
the last pair to recognizing the OLL, and it saves you a little time 
since you do the pair faster.

3) Don&#x27;t worry about twisting the cube :

The biggest piece of advice for this section is to do as many side 
turns as you can before doing a cube rotation or a bottom layer 
turn.  (I solve cross on bottom so a &quot;bottom&quot; layer move for me is a 
U move.  For cross on left a &quot;bottom&quot; layer move is an R move).

For example, if during the F2L at some point doing the move RL&#x27;U 
will give the same effect as far as you&#x27;re concerned as doing the 
move RUL&#x27; or L&#x27;UR then always do the two side turns first.  

Do F&#x27; B2 R L2 on a solved cube.  We&#x27;re solving cross on bottom here, 
and we&#x27;re 4 moves away from completing it.  The cross pieces are in 
UL, UB, FR and UR.  In this case we can solve the cross like this, 
L2 B2 R&#x27; F, however this breaks the rule of always turning as many 
side faces as you can before doing a cube rotation or a bottom layer 
turn.  The most side turns we can do here is to do L2 R&#x27;.  Now do a 
cube rotation y and finish off with L R2.  Try to imagine that you 
are only allowed to turn the L U and R faces.  Cube rotations are ok 
as long as you turn as many L and R faces as you can for the 
situation you&#x27;re at before you rotate.  If you solve cross at left, 
turn as many U and D turns as the situation allows before rotating.

So in short cube rotations are not bad.  Try not to overdo them, but 
don&#x27;t worry if you rotate the cube 5 or 6 times during the F2L.  
Just remember the rule.  Before a cube rotation, do as many side 
turns as you can (L and R for cross on bottom, U and D for cross on 
left).

--------------------------

Sorry if this message was a little long, but I was stuck trying to 
improve on the F2L for a very long time and I don&#x27;t want someone 
else to get stuck for that long.

The best piece of advice I can give for the F2L is to practice a lot 
and to just relax.  Solving the cube should always be fun, even when 
you&#x27;re timing yourself.  If you remember to relax you won&#x27;t go too 
fast and fail to spot a pair.

All the above stuff boils down to one thing, which Jessica mentions 
on her site - do absolutely whatever it takes to reduce the number 
of delays (times where you stop twisting faces for even a split 
second) to zero.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">actually i brought up the issue of dropping the cube and having the 
impact force a layer to turn partially right after the wc2003 
tourney.

i think this one of the reasons why a new timer is needed to replace 
the cup-stacking timer.  i am an eletrical engineer and i actually 
proposed a new timer in document to seven towns right after the 
wc20003.  i proposed basically a plastic enclosure with a 5&quot; x 5&quot; 
piece of sponge-foam (&quot;mouse-pad&quot; material) in it for a platform.  a 
hole in the sponge-foam housed an photocell to sense cube presence.  
an LCD display displayed your time on the unit and an external port 
allowed it to be connected to the speed-stacks &quot;large tournament 
display&quot; for use in competitions.  all this was driven by an 
internal zilog CPU processor.  sell price was to be about $90 each.

they evaluated it, and came back with the boiler-plate 
response, &quot;thank you for your ideas but we can&#x27;t make a decision 
right now, we&#x27;ll call you later if we&#x27;re interested&quot;.

i thought this repsonse was amazing considering that i was going to 
fund the development of the timer with thousands of dollars of my 
own money.  all i asked seven-towns for was for them to endorse it 
as the offical rubik&#x27;s timer.  but they weren&#x27;t even willing to give 
that.

hey you can&#x27;t win em all i guess.

          <div class="email-content">Some solving techniques end with two twisted edges across from each 
other on one face.  That would look solved even though you should 
have one more algorithm!

          <div class="email-content">I think one thing that&#x27;s influencing this discussion is that people

People who don&#x27;t pop want pops treated as a bad solve.  If we&#x27;re 
going to resolve this difference without having to fight out the 
difference of opinions, I&#x27;d say that DJ has a good suggestion.  If 
people who pop want to be able to throw out 2 solves (a pop and one 
other) in an avg of 10 run, just make it an average 10 of 13 rather 
than 12, and let everyone through out 2 solves they don&#x27;t like.  This 
way people who pop have an extra safety margin, and people who don&#x27;t 
have an extra solve to play with, and perhaps be more &quot;reckless&quot; with.

          <div class="email-content">The simple solution to the pop problem is that you put the popped <br>
piece back in and keep solving. Macky did that twice in his 15.62 <br>
10/12 run, and if it&#x27;s good enough to get times like that, it&#x27;s good <br>
enough for anyone.<br>
<br>
In some very rare pops, the cube is unreconstructable, but if that <br>
happens more than twice the same round, you&#x27;re doing something <br>
seriously wrong, and should not win that competition.<br>
<br>
BTW, does anyone keep track of record for solving with pops?<br>
<br>
<br>
About an other thing, I think it&#x27;s very useful to have an &quot;official&quot; <br>
international body set standards for how times are recorded and <br>
general conditions for an recognized competition. But not for whether <br>
there should be 3, 5, 12 or any other number of official solves per <br>
competition, how many counts how, rounds or whatever. I can imagine <br>
fun and interesting competitions with any number of solves and <br>
rounds, or using other concepts than rounds for that matter.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Tend to agree adam.  But i think we all pop sometimes, I know I do but I
still think allowing a pop is like allowing someone to run the 100m olympic
final again because they fell over!  nevertheless I don&#x27;t think enough other
people would agree with this so Your suggestions sounds perfectly
acceptable.

          <div class="email-content">Just to throw another idea around (or increase the confusion), just 
a few sec ago I had a solve which I popped during one of the last 
two moves. An adge piece flew off and I finished it with a dangling 
corner. Should this count? Maybe that&#x27;s a stupid question...

At WC, I saw some ppl practice solving with a finger in place of an 
edge piece... would this be an acceptable thing to do after an edge 
flys across the stage?

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ... okay i&#x27;ll explain.

A while back there was some talk about making cubes that would 
scramble themselves and save us tedious and boring work. One of the 
ideas was to have &quot;digital stickers&quot;. Each sticker would be capable 
of showing each of the six face colors. So in order to scramble a 
device internal or external does a random scramble. And the cube 
simply then displays the scrambled state (no physical turning of 
layers in this step). But now how to make sure this can&#x27;t be applied 
in reverse? Ie how to stop ppl from making remote control or whatever 
to &quot;automatically&quot; change the faces digitally so the cubes enters a 
much better state. An untrained judge at a competition wouldn&#x27;t 
necessarily spot this easily. Well i guess it was my mind running 
wild about this. We are most likely never gonna see those kinda 
cubes ;-)

&gt;  This is the same concept as going &quot;slow&quot;.  If you use finger tricks,<br>
&gt;  you move the faces too quickly to watch the pieces.  Sort of like<br>
&gt;  for the transition between doing the cross, if you go slightly<br>
&gt;  slower than full speed, your brain will notice the general location<br>
&gt;  of the F2L pieces subconsciously, such that when you look around you<br>
&gt;  tend to spot the pairs quicker.  So to go &quot;slow&quot;, imagine going full<br>
&gt;  speed during the F2L ... now just ease off a liiiiittle bit.  During<br>
&gt;  the F2L go as fast as you can, but without ever using finger<br>
&gt;  tricks.  This will slow you down from your full speed with finger<br>
&gt;  tricks enough to watch the pieces.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  The exception to this is the last c/e pair.  When you get to the<br>
&gt;  last pair, use finger tricks to finish it as fast as you can.  I saw<br>
&gt;  Andy Camann recommend this on his website and I tried it.  I have to<br>
&gt;  say that I like it, it doesn&#x27;t significantly increase the delay from<br>
&gt;  the last pair to recognizing the OLL, and it saves you a little time<br>
&gt;  since you do the pair faster.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve thought about this too. I think it should be totally acceptable 
as long as the moves made after the pop would also solve the cube if 
there had never been a pop. It can only slow you down. The same goes 
for putting an edge in backwards or twisting a corner. For example, 
if the yellow/red edge is put in backwards but when the cube is 
solved the yellow/orange edged is flipped, the solve should not 
count but if at the end the yellow/red edge is still flipped, it 
should count.

Also, i agree with ChrisH on treating POPs as DNFs. So in an average 
a pop would count as the worst time (because if you really wanted to 
you could chase after the piece(s), put it in, check to make sure it 
is oriented correctly, and finish the solve) and not be averaged in 
and no additional chances would be allowed. I know this is not what 
we have been doing but it is simple and makes sense.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m still learning a few PLL and many of the OLL algorithms.  For me <br>
it&#x27;s easier to practice them in pairs on a solved cube, or the <br>
algorithm and its reverse on a solved cube.  For example, the OLL alg <br>
R&#x27;F&#x27;L&#x27;F R F&#x27; L F compliments R&#x27; F&#x27; L F R F&#x27; L&#x27; F so it&#x27;s easy to <br>

just curious if anybody else pairs or even triples or quadruples <br>

algorithms...I just don&#x27;t see each case often enough to keep sharp <br>

i find that to be challenging...any tips would be nice<br>

time tracking down the &quot;right&quot; type of silicone spray here in Sweden.

Just found this: http://www.crceurope.com/wwwcrc/msds/AB12750-3.htm
(from CRC Industries) but it contains Naphtha, which i believe is a
petroleum product and is not supposed to be good for lubing cubes.

My problem is that most brands of silicone spray in Sweden seems to
contain Naphtha, so it would be nice to know if this product is ok to
use without destroying the cube :-)

          <div class="email-content">With only a slight sub30 average I&#x27;m even further away from being an <br>
expert, but here are some of my thoughts/experiences now that I&#x27;m <br>
working more on my F2L. I&#x27;d like to hear what the pros think about <br>
this, both for myself and because I don&#x27;t like to mislead other <br>
beginners.<br>
<br>
1) If you have the choice between inserting the pair in the back or <br>
in the front, choose the back. If you do it in the front, this will <br>
unnecessarily consume part of your view. For example, if it&#x27;s the <br>
first pair, inserting at the front will result in one visible and <br>
two invisible other slots, while inserting at the back reverses this.<br>
<br>
2) Prefer pulling with index fingers over pushing with thumbs, e.g. <br>
for R U&#x27; pull the U&#x27; with the left index finger instead of pushing <br>
it with the right thumb. This results in a smoother motion. Also it <br>
keeps the thumb in the front where it probably belongs for further <br>
moves. Using the index fingers to pull is also good for inserting at <br>
the back. For example, start with both thumbs on the front face and <br>
the other fingers at the back. Now do (L&#x27; U L U&#x27;)*4 without ever <br>
losing grip, pulling U and U&#x27; with the index fingers.<br>
<br>
3) I&#x27;m just beginning to work on looking ahead but yesterday I made <br>
up this rule: You need trust and faith in your hands and your <br>
subconscience controlling them. You must not supervise your fingers <br>
while they solve a pair. You have to let them do their work alone <br>
while you look for the next pairs. Chris said he&#x27;s looking <br>
subconsciously for the next pairs, I think solving the current pair <br>
subconsciously is just as important. Note that you *will* make <br>
mistakes. But that&#x27;s ok. It also *will* get better. At least that&#x27;s <br>
my hope and it has worked several times already, where I don&#x27;t focus <br>
on the current pair and it&#x27;s almost like magic. You need to trust <br>
yourself. Monitoring yourself is a waste of brain capacity and time. <br>
Practice idea: As soon as you spot a pair, close your eyes and solve <br>
it. Try not to visualize this. Try not to even think about it at all.<br>
<br>
4) Pray with me that www.cubestation.co.uk will be online again soon <br>
and that Dan will write his &quot;advanced f2l&quot; section soon ;-)<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Moreover:<br>
<br>
5) Stop after completing F2L and scramble again. That is, don&#x27;t <br>
solve the last layer. Solving the last layer is an interruption. Not <br>
only time-wise but more importantly also style-wise. Because you <br>
suddenly go full speed and use finger tricks. For the same reason, <br>
for practice I&#x27;d suggest solving the last pair just like the first <br>
three, i.e. a bit slower and without finger tricks. You can look <br>
ahead for OLL but shouldn&#x27;t execute it.<br>

Har du provat Sonax Silokonspray?
Jag hittade detta på en sida:
&quot;Oljefritt smörjmedel för rullbälten, gångjärn, reglage, takluckor, 
blixtlås m.m. Löser kärvande delar av metall, trä, gummi och plast. 
Tar bort knarr och gnissel. Förhindrar friktion. SONAX Silikonspray 
är klar, färglös och klibbfri. Lämnar inga fettfläckar.&quot;

Om det är för plast så borde det inte kunna skada plast(kuben) men 
jag har inte provat det.

Also, what I was really looking for was attributes that I should

Normally they don&#x27;t write much about the ingredients or the

total exception, though... so much information ;-)

&gt; &gt;  This is the same concept as going &quot;slow&quot;.  If you use finger <br>

full<br>

During<br>

&gt; &gt;  The exception to this is the last c/e pair.  When you get to the<br>

I saw<br>

have to<br>
&gt; &gt;  say that I like it, it doesn&#x27;t significantly increase the delay <br>
from<br>
&gt; &gt;  the last pair to recognizing the OLL, and it saves you a little <br>

use just my fingers a lot to turn the faces during the F2L.  I don&#x27;t 
do them as &quot;finger tricks&quot; per se, I&#x27;m just using my fingers to turn 
the faces at the same rate that I would if I were using normal wrist

I guess for my original post I should have said to never use full 
speed finger tricks until the last pair.

The sense of accomplishment is good, but there is
something important even more so.  When you learn an
alg yourself (for f2l) your understanding of the cube
will be better than if you recognize the situation
because you found it on speedcubing.com  Increases
&quot;cube intuition&quot; is what I am trying to say.

I dropped my f2l times from about 21.5 to 13.5, in
about 2 months, just from exercising the following
things: (sorry for anything that is repeated from
previous posts)

*going slowly

*reducing pauses.  Record an audio file of yourself
solving the cube during your f2l.  You can tell by the
sound how you are doing here.

*reducing cube rotations (to an extent) limiting
yourself to no cube rotations is probably a bad thing.
 I think I rotate the cube half as much as I used to.

*When putting together &amp; inserting an c/e pair, I only
look for one piece of my next pair.  This way is not
as efficient as finding both pieces for your next edge
pair, but gives you a decent awareness of where things
are at.  

*Work on cross times!  I shaved 1.5 seconds off my f2l
times by working on my cross.  If you are speedcubing
it&#x27;s probably ideal that the cross take you no more
than 3 seconds....I think I average somewhere around
2.5 second.

*Just something I did....I used to take averages for
my f2l...averages for my cross...averages for time
taken to get 1 edge pairs, 2 edge pairs, etc. etc.

*Find better ways to insert edge pairs.  If you are
using algs that take 12 moves to insert an edge pair,
something is definetly wrong.

That&#x27;s all I can think of...hope this helps someone

          <div class="email-content">Hi, 

I am back from business trip. 
I agree with Lars. 
I think the problem was too less official cometitions held. 
I guess we didn&#x27;t want to loose the chance to set the real fastest 
world records by the fastest cubists. Don&#x27;t you think so?

I agree even if we allow pops, we had better to apply only for 
average. 
But if the competion will be held periodically, pops may not be 
allowed not only for best but average. 
I think preventing pops is also a sort of technique. 
One pop is recognized as slowest time, Two pops means automatic 
elimination. 
If we allow pops, we had beter to keep records who made pops and when 
at least. 

In regard to the imcompletion at the last step, it is difficult to 
measure the angle. 
Turn roughly U 45 degree CW. 
You will see lower grooves flanking M-slice and grooves flanking FRU 
corner piece. Put ruler along with right lower groove, if the ruler 
touch (turn) the U slice, it is recognized as completion. Three 
witness including cubist determine. 
It is more than 45 degree but can be measured by one ruler. 
How about this? 

P.S. As Dror and Chris wrote, Guiness also didn&#x27;t accept my 4x4 
fastest record because of space limitation!

Turn exactly U 45 degree CW.
Becaus the width between upper grooves are diagonal, the width 
between upper grooves should be wider than the width between the 
lower grooves. 
So if you try to fit right upper groove to the right lower groove, it 
pass more than 45 degree. 

Do you understand now?

Hi Tyson, 

The link doesn&#x27;t work but I joined the caltechrubiks group and was 
able to see the picture finally. 

We are taliking similar situation but just the other side. 
To your picture, I would allow until the left groove aligned, so it 
becomes more than 45 degree. 
Your definition may be better.

          <div class="email-content">So this was my logic that I wrote in an earlier post.  We are trying to <br>

a solved cube and a cube one-move away should lean towards the cube <br>
