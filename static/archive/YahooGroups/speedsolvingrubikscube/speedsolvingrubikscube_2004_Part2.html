          <div class="email-content">Hi<br>
<br>
Just wanted to let you know I am working on a small javascript program that can do various algorithm related stuff. Anyone can use it in their HTML pages. I made a &quot;howto&quot; page so you can all get started easily.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the suggestions on my page (mostly from the FMC group).<br>
<br>
You can generate random algs with it. Maybe someone can tell me the best algorithm (here I mean it in the strict programming sence) for generating random algs.<br>
<br>
here is the link<br>

It works closely with my applet page<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody, I posted about this puzzle a while ago.  I just <br>
wanted to write again to say I finally figured out how to always <br>
solve it!  On the program there are only 8 levels, and you don&#x27;t get <br>
to a level where every piece is distinct, which would be cool.<br>
<br>
Once you figure out how to solve it, it&#x27;s actually not that hard.<br>
<br>
The puzzle is at http://mirrored.flabber.nl/log.rotation/ for anyone <br>
who is interested.<br>
<br>
Can anyone else beat level 8? ;-)<br>
<br>
Actually, for you programming people, how hard would it be to learn <br>
Java to program that?  I&#x27;m tired of running into cool puzzles on the <br>
internet and not being able to write applets for ideas I have for <br>
how to change them.<br>
<br>
If I were to pick up a java book to write a puzzle that does the <br>
same thing this one does (I can deal without the rotating motion) <br>
what would I have to study to do that?  I&#x27;d eventually like to work <br>
up to a cube applet, but for now I want to start with easy puzzles.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for the help,<br>
Chris<br>

There are many original 3x3x3 cubes type just look at my collection. 
The ones normally used for speedcubing are

Rubiks.com cube
Rubiks Studio cube
Arxon Rubik&#x27;s cube
Deluxe Rubik&#x27;s cube
Arched Rubik&#x27;s cube

Which one is better? This depends on your style. I prefer the Arxon 
type then the Rubiks Studio cube. 
Others prefer Rubik&#x27;s.com cube. So you can choice, the most important 
is that it must be smooth and stable.

          <div class="email-content">I was bored so I felt like doing some of the math for this puzzle.<br>
http://mirrored.flabber.nl/log.rotation/<br>
<br>
I started looking at the controls and the allowable types of moves, <br>
and it turns out that it is possible on this puzzle to come up with <br>
a transposition algorithm (switch only 2 pieces), even when all <br>
pieces are distinct.  Clicking any control circle 3 times does 3 <br>
transpositions, 2 of which can be undone using a commutator.<br>
<br>
Anyway here&#x27;s the transposition alg:<br>
1) number the controls pieces (the 7 centralmost circles) 1-7 from <br>
left to right and top to bottom<br>
2) clicking the &quot;1&quot; control circle n times is denoted 1^n<br>
3) transposition alg - 1^3 7^3 1^3 7^3 1^3 7^3 1 7^3 1^3 7^3 1^3 7^3 <br>
1^5<br>
which breaks down as [1^3] [7^3 1^3 7^3 1^3 7^3] 1 [7^3 1^3 7^3 1^3 <br>
7^3] 1^5<br>
<br>
where the first 1^3 is a permutation to do 3 transpositions, then <br>
all the rest is a commutator with C=7^3 1^3 7^3 1^3 7^3 and D=1 (of <br>
the form CDC&#x27;D&#x27;).<br>
<br>
Since you are allowed to switch any two pieces, the puzzle can <br>
realize all 19! positions if every circle has a distinct design.<br>
<br>
Here are the number of allowable positions for each level:<br>
1) 19<br>
2) 171<br>
3) 2 907<br>
4) 3 876<br>
5) 11 628<br>
6) 27 132<br>
7) 352 716<br>
8) 2 618 916 300 (more than the 2x2x2 cube!)<br>
<br>
If every circle was distinct it would have 19! = 121 645 100 408 832 <br>
000 positions, that&#x27;s about 1/355 of the combinations to a 3x3x3 <br>
cube!<br>
<br>
Ok, so I was bored and in a geeky mood :)<br>

Luc Forest is the quebecois champion 1981 personnel method layer by 
layer average 31 secondes and similary jasmine&#x27;s website method.  
Luc look my method and I am fewest algorythm sub 30 without 
inspection. My young friend solve 32 secondes with inspection and 
fewest algorythm edge system.   

Thiery Gagnaire french book method 1981 is very fast method 2x2x2 on 
step 2. &quot;Gaétan your method is not the fastest but without 
inspection maybe and fewest move 1 or 2 minutes, yes&quot; 

Sebastien Felix 4e french championship with my corner method. 
Welcome Sebastien you are official top 5 french fastest cubist. Thx 
for me!.

All orient 8 corner on one algorythm is magic for me! 

Erno Rubik love the cube 2x2x2 for human approach, I think:))?

Hi, 

Thanks for your interest in my method. 
Step3. (Middle edges.) and Step6. (Permute last U edges)
may be the most difficult parts in my method. 
I worry if you may not understand without pictures. 


Step6. (Permute last U edges)
Before explanation, I would define each edge as El, Ec, Er. 

Ec       :MD2M&#x27;
El, Er   :rl&#x27;D2r&#x27;l
El,Ec, Er:rMl&#x27;D2r&#x27;M&#x27;l
Those algorithms should not mix up center pieces. 
Use these algs effectively. 

If you have pair of El-Ec, Ec-Er, or El-Ec in same orientation, solve 
this pair first. 
El or Er left. You can apply Step 6-2 of 4x4x4. 
Ec left. MD2M&#x27; or S&#x27;U&#x27;SDS&#x27;USD&#x27; 

In the other case, solve either Ec or Er (El) pretending l, M, and r 
as one slice set, you can solve at least one edge either El, Ec, Er 
as same as 3x3x3 but you may need extra Ds to flip the rest of edges. 
If you solved Ec first, and if you could keep either Er or El which 
can be solved by rl&#x27;D2r&#x27;l, you can solve the last edge as same as 
4x4x4. 

If you solved Er or El first, you can also place Ec which can be 
solved by MD2M&#x27;. you can solve the last edge easily. 


I normally don&#x27;t use but in case you have edge pair in different 
orientation that means Er-Ec or El-Ec, solve Ec with flipped Er or 
El. 
Then you can apply 7-2-2iv to solve Er and El simultanously. 


Step7 (Last Layer)
7-1 (corners) Must be as same as smaller cubes. 

7-2-1,7-2-2
You can use all the algorithms. 

7-2-3
This is Chris&#x27;s algorithm. You will have middle edges problem if you 
directly apply this for 5x5x5. 
You can fix the centers by E&#x27;L2Er2E&#x27;L2Er2. 
Or you can solve by combintaion of 7-2-2iii and 7-2-2-iv

7-2-4
You can directly apply them to 5x5x5. 
 
I hope this help you to finish 5x5x5 with my method. 
Good luck.

          <div class="email-content">Well my dear friends, I have done what I think, every cube solver dreads,<br>
saying good bye to the very first cube they first solved and gave their<br>
time; best, average or otherwise (sob).<br>
<br>
Yesterday, I was cleaning and lubing my cube axis using a cloth lightly<br>
sprayed with silicone, it was a fine day at that, when  suddenly, the piece<br>
suddenly slipped out of my hand and fell on the floor. I tried to catch it<br>
but by doing so, got crushed by my dot matrix printer. Somehow the data cord<br>
got cought or yanked by my foot and fell on top of it. It was broken into 8<br>
pieces, impossible to put back, I know I collected, counted and tried to put<br>
the pieces back together with crazy glue.<br>
<br>
Anyway the moral of this accident is : DON&#x27;T CLEAN YOUR CUBE NEAR ANYTHING<br>
POTENTIALLY CRUSHING, No matter how far fetch it may seem. (Which is<br>
something hard to know by the way, darn near IMPOSSIBLE!!!)<br>
<br>
A H H H H H H H H H H ! ! !<br>
<br>
Now I have to find a new one, condition it, lube it and get use to it all<br>
over again. And tring to find a good one here in the Philippines is<br>
something that will take a while, believe me, it will.<br>
<br>
It just got to happen when I can, once in a while, do sub-minute times. It<br>
just not fair!!! AHHH!!! and even more AHHHHH!!!<br>
<br>
BTW just before the demise of my cube, three days before during lunch break,<br>
it gave me my best time of 50.15 sec and my best average of 1:11.15<br>

really look into the nooks and crany of all the malls, toys and specialty

I have not be without a cube in my hands for more than 2 or 3 hours, well
except while sleeping anyway. And I hope the latest algorithms I&#x27;ve just put
into memory doesn&#x27;t degrade while looking for a new cube. (sigh....)

Well, wish me luck you guys and gals.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
as I am quite well comfortable in Java programming and<br>
I teach Java at a university now, maybe I can help a little.<br>
<br>
If you know nothing about Java or at least C/C++, you<br>
should learn the language basic constructs<br>
(declarations, object creation, control constructs, etc.)<br>
<br>
As soon as you are more confortable in the basic programming,<br>
there are many things to learn to be able to program games<br>
with graphics.<br>
<br>
I have done several simple graphical applets concerning graphics<br>
and games with source included:<br>
http://java.rubikscube.info/ - graphical applets with increasing <br>
complexity<br>
http://software.rubikscube.info/Azteroidz/ - asteroids game prototype<br>
http://software.rubikscube.info/RBF/ - simple neural network OCR <br>
(page in Czech - sorry)<br>
<br>
If you really want to try Java and have problems, feel free to <br>
contact me.<br>
<br>
Josef<br>
<br>
&gt; Actually, for you programming people, how hard would it be to <br>
learn <br>
&gt; Java to program that?  I&#x27;m tired of running into cool puzzles on <br>
the <br>
&gt; internet and not being able to write applets for ideas I have for <br>
&gt; how to change them.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If I were to pick up a java book to write a puzzle that does the <br>
&gt; same thing this one does (I can deal without the rotating motion) <br>
&gt; what would I have to study to do that?  I&#x27;d eventually like to <br>
work <br>
&gt; up to a cube applet, but for now I want to start with easy puzzles.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks in advance for the help,<br>
<br>

You can contact me directly, or of course post in the Yahoo Group. I 
don&#x27;t mind posts in the Yahoo group of course, because they generate 
good publicity for my website ;)

Gilles is right, Cubestation is a work in progress, and it&#x27;s not 
going to stay broken for evermore. My exams are from the 13-29, so 
I&#x27;m afraid to say it will probably lack some current stuff for the 
time being, but afterwards, normal service will of course, be 
resumed :)

I will continue to host the FMC, and I promise to post the results 
for the challenges I am behind on before launching another challenge 
this Friday!

But I&#x27;m really glad you all use and like the site, and it&#x27;s a good 
feeling to be relied upon!

Cheers,

Dan :)

P.S. my address is dan_j_harris@... - if you need to 
contact me personally about any matters arising from my site or the 
cube in general :)

          <div class="email-content">if you are only using 3 algs then you should probably learn some more ;)

the truth is to keep on working and experimenting with things.  It will click 
eventully, and a 20 sec f2l isnt bad at all, if you can do that with only 3 algs, 
then you are doin awesome.  The biggest problem with the f2l is speed.  
People try and do the f2l as fast as possible.  This is bad because when your 
turning so fast its hard to pick up on what you are going to next.  Just be able 
to turn at a pace that  enables you to look ahead yet move at a nice speed.  
I&#x27;ve been fighting with it myself  and lightbulbs still flash now and then to lower 
my times.  
good luck

I don&#x27;t know any method requiring 469 &quot;algorithms&quot;, but if the method
you&#x27;re looking for belongs to the CF class of approaches, you could
try the cornersfirst Yahoo group.


Gilles.

PS: Josef Jelinek is building a page dealing with the method used by
Marc Waterman (work in progress). See

          <div class="email-content">Hi Kyle,
20 seconds in average for F2L is not that bad, considering you only use 3 algs and haven&#x27;t been cubing for a long time... I average around 28 seconds for the whole cube, but I don&#x27;t think I average very much better than 20 seconds for F2L. So at a certain point, the only good advice is to practice, and if you can, try to figure out your own algs for the F2L.

          <div class="email-content">i was averaging about 20 seconds for the first two layers until i 
did two things

slow down (dont you hate it when everyone keeps telling you that, 
and they are right!?)

and use the second applet on this page

http://www2.u-netsurf.ne.jp/~katsu-k/

i use it to practice both looking ahead, and sloving the f2l as fast 
as possible

i either do it on the 9 second for a challenge

or the 21, and solve the pair that i messed up while doing it, and 
the rest of the cube when im done

in one night i dropped 3 or 4 seconds off my average because of that

hope it helps

very much better than 20 seconds for F2L. So at a certain point, the 
only good advice is to practice, and if you can, try to figure out 
your own algs for the F2L.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Does anyone have a list of the 469 algs used in Watermans( i <br>
think) <br>
&gt; CF method?  I&#x27;d like to see them if possible... thanks<br>
&gt; <br>

<br>
There are a total of 141 algs used in Waterman&#x27;s method, provided <br>
that you don&#x27;t run into any complications.  This total includes a <br>
lot of mirrored algs.<br>
<br>
Roughly, the method involves the following steps:<br>
<br>
1.  solve one face<br>
<br>
2.  orient and permute the remaining corners (1 of 43 algs)<br>
<br>
Next, hold the solved face in your left hand, with the corners <br>
solved in step 2 in the R face.  The next steps are to solve the <br>
right edge pieces (called &quot;redges&quot;), and orient all the middle edge <br>
pieces (called &quot;midges&quot;) in two algs. The M slice is referred to as <br>
the &quot;ring&quot;.<br>
<br>
3.  Solve 2 redges such that you leave 1 or 0 redges in the ring.  <br>
Do this by picking an alg which solves 1 redge in the ring and 1 in <br>
the R face (1 of 6 algs), OR pick an alg which solves 2 redges in <br>
the ring (1 of 6 algs)<br>
<br>
4.  Solve the last 2 redges, and orient all the midges in 1 alg.  If <br>
both redges are in the R face, then you have to pick 1 of 14 algs.  <br>
If one redge is in the R face, and one is in the ring, then pick one <br>
of 48 algs.<br>
<br>
5.  solve the midges, 1 of 3 algs, which are trivial.<br>
<br>
additional algs are included to handle situations where one or more <br>
redges are solved by the end of step 2.<br>
<br>
flip one redge and orient midges:  2 algs<br>
<br>
solve one redge in the ring and orient midges: 16 algs (8 algs and <br>
their mirrors)<br>
<br>
if all redges are solved, orient midges:  3 algs<br>
<br>
I think that the algs from step 3 are borrowed from the algs in step <br>
4, but listed separately.<br>
<br>
In addition to this set of algs, there are additional components to <br>
the system designed to handle ugly situations such as when you have <br>
3 or 4 redges cycled in the r face, or when you have all 4 redges in <br>
the ring.<br>
<br>
If you can master all of the bad situations in addition to the basic<br>
(!) system, you should be able to solve the R face and orient the M <br>
slice in 2 algs or processes, no matter what.<br>
<br>
since you pretty much use only U, R, and M, you don&#x27;t have to regrip <br>
with your left hand too much (there are some algs with F moves).<br>
<br>
Here are a few example algs from step 3 to show the basic idea.  Try <br>
doing the inverse of the algs on a solved cube to set these up.<br>
<br>
To solve 2 redges in the ring, one at FU and one at FD (FU means <br>
that the R facelet of the redge is on the F face as opposed to UF, <br>
which puts the R facelet on the U face) , do this:<br>
<br>
U2 (R) M U2 M&#x27; U M2 U (R)&#x27; U2<br>
<br>
When you execute this alg, the redge at FU will get placed in the <br>
hole at RU, and the redge at FD will get placed in the hole in the R <br>
face which is turned up to the RU position with the turn (R).  (R)&#x27; <br>
is just the inverse of whatever R move you did in (R).<br>
<br>
To solve 2 redges where one is in the ring at DF (R facelet of this <br>
redge is in the D face), and one is in the correct hole in the R <br>
face at the position RU but flipped, do this:<br>
<br>
U2 (R) U&#x27; M U2 M2 U&#x27; (R)&#x27; U2<br>
<br>
in this case, the move (R) means turn the R face so that the hole <br>
that the redge in the ring belongs to gets moved to the RU position.<br>
<br>
In any case its a neat but scary system.<br>

<br>
I&#x27;ve written up some rules for the Caltech 3x3x3 speedsolve <br>
competition.  You can find them here:<br>

<br>
Let me know if any part of these rules are not clear.  I&#x27;m <br>
unfortunately not a lawyer so my English probably needs to be a better. <br>
  Unless you have a major complaint, keep in mind that I can&#x27;t tailor <br>
these rules to everyone&#x27;s desires.  The same goes as I write the rules <br>
for the World Rubik&#x27;s Cube Association.  Some of these rules will end <br>
up being copied into the WRCA&#x27;s rules.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll add other issues as I come up with them.  That&#x27;s what the last <br>
clause is for... just in case.<br>

It would be a shame if you only competed in one or two events, and <br>

          <div class="email-content">Only several more notes.<br>
<br>
To count exact number of algorithms in Waterman&#x27;s method<br>
is quite difficult because each algorithm using (R) and (R)&#x27;<br>
symbols is a shortcut for more algorithms and should<br>
be learnt that way to get really fast in performing them...<br>
<br>
The original Waterman&#x27;s description of &quot;bad luck cases&quot;<br>
and &quot;complications&quot; is too complicated and in fact can be<br>
handled simpler with less algorithms with the same efficiency.<br>
(about 4 + 2 algs)<br>
<br>
The algorithms mentioned in the previous message (see below)<br>
are not the most efficient (and this is true for more algs<br>
in the Waterman&#x27;s method). You can use the following<br>
replacements (found by myself):<br>
<br>
U M (R) U&#x27; M U M&#x27; (R)&#x27; U&#x27;<br>
(instead of U2 (R) M U2 M&#x27; U M2 U (R)&#x27; U2)<br>
- shorter, without half moves<br>
<br>
U M&#x27; U&#x27; (R) U&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M2 U&#x27;<br>
(instead of U2 (R) U&#x27; M U2 M2 U&#x27; (R)&#x27; U2)<br>
- less half moves, only one (R) in alg., 1 more M turn,<br>
  there is a hole in RU and not the flipped edge (!)<br>
<br>
In addition, I have found replacements for all algorithms<br>
that use F turns (hard to perform quickly) and now<br>
all algorithms use only U M R moves (!) and are of the<br>
same length or even shorter (except for one or two algs.)<br>
<br>
Josef<br>
<br>
&gt; There are a total of 141 algs used in Waterman&#x27;s method, provided <br>
&gt; that you don&#x27;t run into any complications.  This total includes a <br>
&gt; lot of mirrored algs.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Roughly, the method involves the following steps:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1.  solve one face<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2.  orient and permute the remaining corners (1 of 43 algs)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Next, hold the solved face in your left hand, with the corners <br>
&gt; solved in step 2 in the R face.  The next steps are to solve the <br>
&gt; right edge pieces (called &quot;redges&quot;), and orient all the middle <br>
edge <br>
&gt; pieces (called &quot;midges&quot;) in two algs. The M slice is referred to <br>
as <br>
&gt; the &quot;ring&quot;.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 3.  Solve 2 redges such that you leave 1 or 0 redges in the ring.  <br>
&gt; Do this by picking an alg which solves 1 redge in the ring and 1 <br>
in <br>
&gt; the R face (1 of 6 algs), OR pick an alg which solves 2 redges in <br>
&gt; the ring (1 of 6 algs)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 4.  Solve the last 2 redges, and orient all the midges in 1 alg.  <br>
If <br>
&gt; both redges are in the R face, then you have to pick 1 of 14 <br>
algs.  <br>
&gt; If one redge is in the R face, and one is in the ring, then pick <br>
one <br>
&gt; of 48 algs.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 5.  solve the midges, 1 of 3 algs, which are trivial.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; additional algs are included to handle situations where one or <br>
more <br>
&gt; redges are solved by the end of step 2.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; flip one redge and orient midges:  2 algs<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; solve one redge in the ring and orient midges: 16 algs (8 algs and <br>
&gt; their mirrors)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; if all redges are solved, orient midges:  3 algs<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I think that the algs from step 3 are borrowed from the algs in <br>
step <br>
&gt; 4, but listed separately.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In addition to this set of algs, there are additional components <br>
to <br>
&gt; the system designed to handle ugly situations such as when you <br>
have <br>
&gt; 3 or 4 redges cycled in the r face, or when you have all 4 redges <br>
in <br>
&gt; the ring.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If you can master all of the bad situations in addition to the <br>
basic<br>
&gt; (!) system, you should be able to solve the R face and orient the <br>
M <br>
&gt; slice in 2 algs or processes, no matter what.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; since you pretty much use only U, R, and M, you don&#x27;t have to <br>
regrip <br>
&gt; with your left hand too much (there are some algs with F moves).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Here are a few example algs from step 3 to show the basic idea.  <br>
Try <br>
&gt; doing the inverse of the algs on a solved cube to set these up.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; To solve 2 redges in the ring, one at FU and one at FD (FU means <br>
&gt; that the R facelet of the redge is on the F face as opposed to UF, <br>
&gt; which puts the R facelet on the U face) , do this:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; U2 (R) M U2 M&#x27; U M2 U (R)&#x27; U2<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; When you execute this alg, the redge at FU will get placed in the <br>
&gt; hole at RU, and the redge at FD will get placed in the hole in the <br>
R <br>
&gt; face which is turned up to the RU position with the turn (R).  <br>
(R)&#x27; <br>
&gt; is just the inverse of whatever R move you did in (R).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; To solve 2 redges where one is in the ring at DF (R facelet of <br>
this <br>
&gt; redge is in the D face), and one is in the correct hole in the R <br>
&gt; face at the position RU but flipped, do this:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; U2 (R) U&#x27; M U2 M2 U&#x27; (R)&#x27; U2<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; in this case, the move (R) means turn the R face so that the hole <br>
&gt; that the redge in the ring belongs to gets moved to the RU <br>
position.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In any case its a neat but scary system.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, <br>
<br>
I did this for the Sunday blindfolded contest, and was too excited <br>
to wait until the results are posted before posting here.<br>
<br>
I just attempted a Division II solve for the first time (where only <br>
the time to solve counts).  My time was 18.50 seconds!<br>
<br>
Basically what I did was to do exactly like my solve from a year and <br>
a half ago, where I solved using the Fridrich method in only one <br>
look, only this time I memorized the entire solution before I put on <br>
the blindfold.<br>
<br>
Anyway I caught this on video, and I am going to upload it as soon <br>
as I can get it onto my computer.<br>
<br>
It took me 1 hour 54 minutes 24 seconds total (you can see the <br>
stopwatch I used to time the whole thing in the video, as well as <br>
Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer for timing the solve alone).  The 1 hour and 54 <br>
minutes includes the time it took me to memorize the cube and plan <br>
out my entire solution.  I used only the Fridrich method, none of my <br>
normal blindfolded strategies.  This solve was done exactly like I <br>
would have done it had I been at a stackmat with only 15 seconds <br>
inspection.<br>
<br>
Watching Gaétan Guimond&#x27;s videos of his behind the back solves are <br>
what inspired me to try this.  I&#x27;m starting to develop an efficient <br>
process to this, and I think I can get my times under an hour and a <br>
half if I were to continue to practice this.<br>
<br>
Anyway I just wanted to say that I too have achieved a &quot;behind the <br>
back&quot; solve, and that it isn&#x27;t impossible!  It just takes 2 hours <br>
worth of memorizing for less than 20 seconds worth of solving :)<br>

So that&#x27;s how Gaetan does those videos...awesome, man! also- was calculation taken while memorization?  interesting- it would only take around 50-60 moves, so calculating the whole thing is possible.  also- when memorizing, did you memorize like you did b4 with the &#x27;one look&#x27;- or did you memorize by numbers? or was memorization needed at all due to ur calculation?...good job.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sure how Gaetan does his attempts, but I would assume it 
would be something similar.

Basically what I did was this:

1) after scrambling the cube I visually try to solve as much of the 
F2L as I can.  This means either solving an extended cross or a 
double extended cross.  You have virtually unlimited time so after a 
while you start to see some pretty good ways to approach it.  For my 
18.50 second solve I found a double extended cross after about 10 
minutes of visual examination.  Of course you can&#x27;t do any moves, so 
you have to just follow all the pieces in your head.

Once I found a potential way to solve an extended or double extended 
cross I verified for each piece that it would work by doing all the 
moves of my potential alg in my head, and tracking each piece one at 
a time (I do this for each piece in the double extended cross).  
Once I&#x27;m sure the move works and does indeed solve an extended or 
double extended cross, then I number all the remaining pieces of the 
cube.

I give each piece a number on one of its stickers.  This lets you 
simultaneously memorize the position and orientation of every piece, 
while still only memorizing one piece of information for each piece.

I don&#x27;t memorize any information for one top layer corner and one 
top layer edge, since after solving the F2L you can figure out their 
position and orientation based on where the other pieces are, and 
how they&#x27;re oriented.  Also this makes each step where you have to 
manipulate the pieces in your head much easier.

2) ok so at this point I have an algorithm memorized that will solve 
an extended or double extended cross.  From here up until I am ready 
to time myself I don&#x27;t need the cube at all, the rest is just mental 
calculation.  Now what I do is repeat my extended cross alg in my 
head once for every remaining piece, and track where that piece ends 
up after doing the algorithm.  After doing this for each piece I 
know the state the cube will be in after doing my extended cross 
algorithm.

3) Now I examine the state of the cube in my head and find the 
shortest way to solve the next corner/edge pair (finding the 
shortest one is very important as it makes the mental calculation 
easier).  Once I find an alg to solve the next corner/edge pair I 
repeat that alg in my head once for every piece whose 
position/orientation I have memorized.  By doing this I can find the 
state the cube will be in after solving the next corner edge pair.

4) Now I do the same thing for all remaining corner/edge pairs.  I 
find an alg to solve one, then I repeat it for every remaining 
unsolved piece to find the state the cube will be in after solving 
that pair.

5) Now I&#x27;ve found an alg that solves the F2L and I know the state of 
the LL except for one corner and one edge (the ones I originally 
didn&#x27;t memorize any information for).  The positions of these pieces 
are easy to find simply by locating all 6 pieces whose positions I 
do know at this point.  To find the orientation is easy, just 
remember that the flips of the edges have to be congruent to 0 mod 2 
and the flips of the corners have to be congruent to 0 mod 3.  Now I 
know the positions and orientation of every piece in the LL.

6) I figure out the orientation of all LL pieces, and recall my OLL 
algorithm to solve it.  Then I repeat the OLL algorithm in my head 8 
times, once for every piece, to track its location after doing my 
OLL alg.  I also track all of their orientations, to verify that 
each piece does indeed end up oriented correctly.

7) Once I have all the pieces oriented, I examine their locations 
and recall my PLL algorithm to solve it.

8) Now I practice in my head the entire solution routine over and 
over.  I do this on an &quot;air cube&quot; to pretend that I am actually 
doing the moves and so that my hands will be used to doing all the 
steps quickly.  I did this for about 5 minutes for my solve.

9) Now I pick up the cube again for the first time in almost 2 
hours, turn on the video camera, put on the blindfold and start 
solving :)

I have the video on my computer but it is a huge file.  I&#x27;m trying 
to shrink it down before I upload it to the internet.

And that&#x27;s how you do it :)

possible.  also- when memorizing, did you memorize like you did b4 
with the &#x27;one look&#x27;- or did you memorize by numbers? or was 
memorization needed at all due to ur calculation?...good job.

My local Barnes &amp; Nobel has them in stores.  They&#x27;re sitting on a

Nicely done!

I should have guessed that there was room for improvement with the 
original algs.

On closer inspection of the algs in Waterman&#x27;s method, I see that 
there are similar algs in table 4 which are similar to your second 
example: U M&#x27; U&#x27; (R) U&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M2 U&#x27;.

Table 4, alg 17a:  U M&#x27; U&#x27; (R) U M2 U2 M U

This makes me wonder why they published Table 2 with less efficient 
algs borrowed from table 4 which accomplish the same thing!

How many algs have you found which are more efficient for the method?
I would love to see them.  

I am sort of glad that I never had the guts to try to master the 
original algs, given that I would have to spend a lot of time 
unlearning the algs with more efficient alternatives.

In the video I have already been memorizing the cube for 1 hour and <br>

solve it, then stop Jess&#x27; timer.  I show Jess&#x27; timer, which was only <br>
timing how long it took me to solve the cube.  I then lift up my <br>
stopwatch (very dark) to show how long the whole thing took.  The <br>

David Allen is kinda secretive about his method, or so I&#x27;ve heard. 
But he has said it&#x27;s based on the Varasano method. Like Wayne said, 
it&#x27;s probably impossible to get sub-20 average using the books

Yes,  but I was chatting with Gene Means and he told me that He and 
David require much more inspection time than was allowed.  They do 
quite a bit more planning ahead before the solve.

Thanks for the wonderful page Ton! The newsletters are really cool. 
Interesting to see that the editor Tom Parks suggests preparing a 
cube with &quot;a thin coat of vaseline&quot;, I&#x27;m not so sure that&#x27;s what 
would be recommended these days!

Take care,

Dan :)

No, I don&#x27;t think they can.  I might be mistaken.

It happened to me a while back, but I was only #3 for about 15 minutes.  
Long enough to show my friends, but not long enough to cause a major 
riff.  And yea, I did reset my times.

          <div class="email-content">I just thought about this and had an idea: Why not modify Fridrich <br>
(the method, not the person ;-) a bit? What I mean is to not solve <br>
the first layer correctly at first. Do F2L Fridrich-style but don&#x27;t <br>
care about permutation and orientation inside the first layer.<br>
<br>
Then follow F2L with an OFL and PFL and then of course OLL and PLL. <br>
This would allow a shorter and easier F2L which might make planning <br>
ahead the whole solution easier/safer/faster. Also, execution of the <br>
planned solution would still be quite fast.<br>
<br>
If you really ignore permutation and orientation of the first layer <br>
then of course you only have a 1/12 chance that OFL/PFL works. But <br>
taking care of orientation is very simple (e.g. corners orientation <br>
with last CE pair during F2L, edges orientation during cross) which <br>
leaves a 1/2 chance because of permutation. Either you&#x27;re lucky or <br>
you do it with the last two CE pairs or you apply a fixing alg <br>
between U and D sometime during the solution.<br>
<br>
What do you think?<br>

IMPOSSIBLE  !  too much algos for human&#x27;s  Brain for now........  
but in a far futur , why not when human&#x27;s brain will have double 
size!!

          <div class="email-content">You are the human computer algorythm. You are excellent!

My experience 2x2x2 with Richard Korf  (rechearh  algorythm god 
program)is special. 9 in 7 &quot;yes Gaétan&quot; 

After my step 1 don&#x27;t use quater turn on F, B, L and R dooble turn 
move only. 

Ex: cubestion 7 may  B2 F&#x27; L2 U R (D2 U&#x27; B)*3 (L2 D&#x27; R)*3 F B U2 L 
D2 my solution is UFRBR2D2F2D&#x27;F2D&#x27; step 1 all orient UFRB step 2  I 
don&#x27;t use quarter turn F, B, L and R dooble turn move only 
R2D2F2D&#x27;F2D&#x27;.

My average cubestation on 2x2x2 is 9 move. What your average time on 
rubik&#x27;s cube sub 7-8 move scramble no sequence opposite face? 
Another method fast 2x2x2 by 2 step is not the best system fewest 
move for me and you?

Magic fun

have memorized the entire bible.  This is a feat that
measures as impossible in my mind.  But still people

on putting this method into a visual standpoint on my

maybe when I find the free time I will finish it.

Austin,
   I like them both, but honestly my 4x4x4 gets more use.  The square-
1 is challenging and an interesting solve for sure, but it loses 
something after a while because it&#x27;s very hard to randomly mix it 
up.  That is, I start seeing certain things I want to &quot;mix more&quot; 
while I&#x27;m mixing it since it&#x27;s a much more involved task than 
scrambling a symmetrical puzzle.
   That said though, the 4x4x4 is somewhat of an exercise of &quot;more of 
the same.&quot;  If you haven&#x27;t ever played with a bigger than 3x3x3 cube, 
it&#x27;s challenging and fun to figure out your own solution, but not 
quite as challenging to figure out a solution as the square-1 is.

I hope I&#x27;ve made some sense and helped out a little!  I say go for 
the 4x4x4, but you&#x27;ll likely be happy with either!

Best,
Daniel

          <div class="email-content">4x4x4 is awesome. not very hard to learn, if you know the 3x3x3. and a very durable and fun puzzle. although never tried a square 1 before.... ehh either is fine, but more chances to do 4x4x4 at competitions.

I did the same thing and it looks like I&#x27;m averaging closer to 205 
moves.  That&#x27;s for 12 solves though. I haven&#x27;t calculated how long it 
takes me to do each step yet.  I have an excell spreadsheet with all 
of the move numbers broken down though.

Another idea:

1: 1x2x3
2: 1x2x3
3: Orientation of 4 corners, 6 edges and 4 centers.
4: Permutation of 4 corners, 6 edges.

Step 3 looks difficult, but a simple &quot;M&quot; or &quot;UM&quot; before could reduce
the number of cases drastically. It looks like an OLL step with more
freedom and additional sequences. Solve centers+DF+DB before when it&#x27;s
easy.
Step 4... well... I don&#x27;t know, but it looks possible.

I won&#x27;t even try to think about it, because it requires to many
sequences for me, but maybe mad people like the ZB brothers... ;-)

Gilles.

The biggest problem now is not algorithms memorization itself but 
obtaining the algorithms to memorize. I didn&#x27;t find any set of optimized 
algs. Lots of hard work is needed to be done to create one.

I know this is a lot like Gilles&#x27; method, and I&#x27;ve actually talked to 
him a few times about different ideas based on his method.  I&#x27;m not 
sure, but depending on how the algoritms are for this method, I think 
it could be quite fast.  We&#x27;ll see though.  Thanks to all those who 
answered.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
 z-b is the one that does the last edge corner pair and orients the LL edges
isn&#x27;t it?
I&#x27;m not sure how beneficial the extra effort will be.
For comparison with my method (I&#x27;ll refer to it as the DD method) I put in
the &quot;cross and one corner&quot; first.
I then do the remaining 3 corner edge pairs leaving me with one middle edge.
(Actually I use the keyhole method but in principle and for comparison its
simplest to stick with the Fridrich pair moves).
I do the final middle edge and at the same time orient not only the LL edges
but one corner.  This is the &quot;z-b like&quot; part.  This only needs 24 algorithms
at an average of between 8 and 9 moves per algorithm.
You are left with a 1 in 9 chance of a one look last layer with 4 OLL
algorithms at an average of 8 moves if the last layer needs orienting.

Compared to Fridrich, DD loses 0-2 moves by doing &quot;cross + 1 corner&quot; then on
average another one move in the &quot;z-b like&quot; part - putting in the middle edge
while orienting edges and 1 corner.
It gains 2 moves on average on OLL but then there is the big bonus of the
1-in-9 chance of a 1 look LL.

All in all I would say there isn&#x27;t much to choose between DD and Fridrich
and I would guess the same is true of z-b.  The other big bonus of my method
is that by learning the 24 algorithms for the last middle edge you cut down
the number of OLL algorithms to learn to 4!  And of course its pretty quick
to recognise the 8 possible LL corner orientations too.

It still looks very hard to expand either the middle edge algorithms to
orient more or the PLL algorithms to cover corner orientation and get down
to 1 look :(.  Unless either my approach or z-b can be used to cut out a
whole step i.e. get down to a one look LL then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending
time switching from Fridrich unless you really think the probabilities of
the one look (1/9 or 1/16?) are worth all the extra effort.  Obviously I&#x27;m
biased and like DD best (and it has the fewest algorithms) but I would have
to say that there are such good sites out there teaching Fridrich that I
think its probably the easiest of the fast methods to learn at the moment.

   Tiles are allowed in competition. I use Rubik&#x27;s Deluxe cubes in

Hi Kyle,

   I practice with stickered cubes too. Being used to tiles doesn&#x27;t

The way you solve 2x2x2 is amazing. I like the first stage the most. 
After 4 moves the corners are oriented!!
Is the set of algorithms computer generated or is it &quot;hand made&quot;?
Maybe I missed some discussion about it. I haven&#x27;t seen this system 
before. My system (decades ago) has 3 stages and was intended for 
speed. 1. orientation of 4 white corners in U, 2. orientation of 
yellow corners in D, 3. permutation of both u and D layers.

For 3x3x3 there is no best system for fewest moves so far. I use 
mostly an intuitive approach, preferably with 2x2x3 done as a middle 
stage (but not always).

Why no nail polish/paint?  I used my cube, which is painted with nail <br>

I personally think this is a bad rule.  Stickers wear off too easily, <br>

you find them you may have to transfer them from another cube to use <br>

<br>
So, there&#x27;s a sticky issue with allowing nail polish.  If I allow nail <br>
polish, the cube will definitely be subjected to an inspection by the <br>
tournament director before the competition.  Though your cube is <br>
probably fine, a lot of competitors had nail polish cubes with really <br>
indistinct colors.  I wanted to try and get rid of this problem.<br>
<br>
I guess I can amend the rules but the six colors have to be very <br>
distinct.  What do you think?  Can you order stickers for your cubes <br>
instead?<br>

Thanks for your quick reply - my comments are below:<br>

<br>
I would expect this to be the case - at the RWC, they checked to make <br>
sure your cube was satisfactory for competition.  Even if someone has <br>
stickers on their cube, if they look nasty or are hard to tell what <br>
color is on each side because of wear, they should be required to <br>
replace them.<br>
<br>
&gt; Though your cube is probably fine, a lot of competitors had nail<br>
&gt; polish cubes with really indistinct colors.  I wanted to try and<br>
&gt; get rid of this problem.<br>
<br>
Understandably, judges need to be able to quickly and easily tell, <br>
for sure, whether or not a cube is solved when the solver puts it <br>
down as solved.  If this is in question, then that cube should not be <br>
allowed into competition.  If they have painted their cube such that <br>
two sides are distinguishable, but are similar, then it only hurts <br>
them in their recognition... Especially if lighting is less than <br>
optimal on the stage.<br>
<br>
&gt; I guess I can amend the rules but the six colors have to be very <br>
&gt; distinct.  What do you think?  Can you order stickers for your<br>
&gt; cubes instead?<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t anticipate being in competitions very frequently, so I <br>
suppose I could sticker-up just before going to one, but part of my <br>
reason for using the nail polish is to avoid the extra cost of <br>
constantly replacing stickers.  Also, with nail polish, you can get <br>
more brilliant colors - I much prefer the distinction between my <br>
green/blue and red/orange then that of the stickers.  So, in the end, <br>
I think it would be better to allow for &quot;painted&quot; cubes, with an <br>
specification that cubes&#x27; colors must be distinct from one another.<br>

          <div class="email-content">ZB is a system for those who want to get below 15 (and be the best). <br>
What one can ask is if it is worth the memorizing. It&#x27;s hard to <br>
improve Jiri and 1212 is just too much.<br>
<br>
Fridrich(7looks):<br>
cross 7moves<br>
F2L 4x7<br>
OLL 9<br>
PLL 11<br>
total:55<br>
<br>
ZB(6 looks):<br>
cross 7<br>
3F2Lpairs 3x7<br>
4th pair+EO 8<br>
PE+CO&amp;P 12<br>
total: 48<br>
<br>
VH(8 looks): (1/12+1/21 chance of skiping last step)<br>
cross 7<br>
3F2Lpairs 3x7<br>
group 4th pair 3.5<br>
finishF2L+EO 6.5<br>
C O&amp;P 9<br>
EP 10<br>
total: 57<br>
<br>
3 ideas for LBL methods for top speed I thought of, based on all <br>
these methods and (chris&#x27; extended cross;) :<br>
<br>
VH, my way (1/6+1/21 chance of 1look LL)<br>
cross 7<br>
3F2Lpairs 3x7<br>
group 4th pair 3.5<br>
finishF2L+EO 6.5<br>
EP 7<br>
O&amp;P C 12<br>
total:57<br>
<br>
-instead of 1/8, you get +than1/5 of the times a 1look LL<br>
-if your aim is a full ZB, then you won&#x27;t need to check what each O&amp;P <br>
alg does to EP (this way it does nothing)<br>
<br>
my expert method(6looks):<br>
Xcross 10.5moves<br>
2F2Lpairs 2x7<br>
group 4th pair 3.5<br>
finishF2L+CO 7<br>
CP+EP&amp;O 12<br>
total: 47<br>
<br>
-The great difference is that taking CO out of the last step reduces <br>
A LOT the number of algs. If you, like me, haven&#x27;t learned OLL, you <br>
can learn the last step instead. It&#x27;s about 55algs, excluding mirrors.<br>
-the last step recognition is a bit easier<br>
<br>
my perfect method (5looks) :)<br>
Xcross 10.5moves<br>
2F2Lpairs 2x7<br>
4th pair+OC 8<br>
CP+EP&amp;O 12<br>
total:44.5<br>
<br>
-forget 1212 this is the ultimate aim hehe<br>
-the 4th pair has too many cases, but its easy to reduce them to 1/4 <br>
with a little trick, making this method have a bit less algs then ZB<br>
<br>
For a list algs to choose from and optimize,<br>
use http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think of these methods<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IMPOSSIBLE  !  too much algos for human&#x27;s  Brain for<br>
&gt; &gt; now........<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but in a far futur , why not when human&#x27;s brain will have<br>
&gt; &gt; double<br>

but<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obtaining the algorithms to memorize. I didn&#x27;t find any set of<br>

was off by 1 turn... drat.  But i&#x27;m getting closer and closer, so thats cool.  <br>
<br>
I was just wondering if working out a solution without turning the cube then <br>
solving it with a blindfold on, is that technicly blindfold cubing?  I mean usually <br>
you guys memorize all the pieces and then work on the solution while <br>
blindfolded.  But preplanning everything and then executing a sequence <br>
without looking is that considered blindfolded cubing too?<br>

Hi Evan,

I think what you want is Ron&#x27;s cube solver (look under tools at 
speedcubing.com)...it&#x27;s my favorite cube tool...

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

that´a a very simple problem that should take only take about 5-10 
sec. with a little practice.
Try this:
Let´s see the middle 3x3 pieces as a 3x3 cube.
U normally have at least one edge connected with its middle piece on 
each side.
Now try to get connected edge/corner pairs an and build a 2x2 then a 
2x3 etc.

For example: one the red side 
                              /r/r/o/
                              /o/r/o/
                              /r/o/r/


          one the orange side
                              /o/r/o/
                              /o/o/r/
                              /r/r/o/
    
A double slice move right connects the down/right red corner with the 
down middle red edge leaving
                          
               red:           /r/r/o/
                              /o/r/r/
                              /r/o/o/

               orange:        /o/r/o/
                              /o/o/o/
                              /r/r/r/
    
turning the orange side counterclockwise and taking back the slice 
move leaves a correct 2x2 on the red side.

Just go on this way till u have a 2x3 correct. The last row has to be 
insert &quot;as one&quot;.

It´s only a hint how to do it, very difficult to describe but easy to 
do.

          <div class="email-content">i had the same problem when i first solved it. took me 45 minutes my first time, and im still aoround there. im also having a little trouble with the edge permutation. i always get one edge piece that isn&#x27;t properly oriented.. its kinda wierd and im not sure what to do. the side looks like this... (r=red, w=white, y=yellow)
 
r   r   w   r   r
r   r   r    r   r
r   r   r    r   r
r   r   y   r   r
 
btw, the whole cube is solved except these two edges. any ideas?

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, thats my problem, im having trouble keeping it all straight in 
my head.  I find it easier to map out each turn before hand even 
thought it takes a couple hours.  

How do you guys keep it all straight?  I tried the whole number 
thing, but that really confuses me.  Oh well, I&#x27;ll try and 
experiement with things...

There are actually 2 possible cases for this. Do the faces look like 
this :

(top)  (bottom)
XXXXX  OOOOO
XXXXX  OOOOO
XXXXX  OOOOO
XXOXX  OOXOO
XXXXX  OOOOO

or like this :

(top)  (bottom)
XXXXX  OOOOO
XXXXX  OOOOO
XXXXX  OOOOO
XXXOX  OOOXO
XXXXX  OOOOO

???? (Hope u get what i mean)

When u reply to this i will make some pictures and post in Photos 
section :-)

-Per K

Both of these are &quot;fixed&quot; by a simple 3-cycle on the centers.

          <div class="email-content">Well, it wasn&#x27;t really super-lucky, it was just when I was clear 
headed and was turning perfectly....

I got the F2L remarkably fast, each step was only about 1 away from 
being solved, and I was able to skip the last step as the edges were 
correct.

I only started cubing about a month ago, and the F2L is still very 
hard beacuse I can&#x27;t always &quot;see&quot; a couple moves ahead, so I usually 
have to figure them out as they come....

And yes, luckily for me I managed to find some silcone spray and the 
cube is pretty loose.

Thanks!

Anyway I&#x27;m still working on getting down to a 30 second average, 
hopefully as I see the F2L better it will come faster.

Just get the 2x3 on one side, then use that 3x1 slice that isn&#x27;t
correct yet to make the final 3x1 on the opposite side. Wow thanks.

algorithms.  And even that was a stretch.  Josef Jelinek has used his own

you read this Josef!).  he made a general offer a few months ago to help
people as he wants to test his solver against others.  I know he is pretty
busy at the moment though.  You could try asking him if you are able to

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

This was a great list of comparisons and includes some stuff I didn&#x27;t know.
Thanks.

Does ZB really have a single algorithm approach for PE + CO+P?  I figured
this was too hard to find the algorithms for - even for my method which
always has at least one corner oriented.  If it does and the algorithms are
known then I will have a look around and steal them to make mine a definite
1 look method.

Currently and to follow your format I have:

DD (7 looks): (1/9 chance of skipping OLL step)
cross + 1 corner 9 moves
3F2L pairs 3x7 21
last ME + EO + 1 CO 8.5    number of algorithms 24
CO 7 number of algorithms 4
PLL 11
total: 57.5

I like the idea of taking out the CO early but haven&#x27;t been able to think my
way through it.

Now i have prepared those pictures that i mentioned. I uploaded them 
to Photos section of this group. Cehck in folder &quot;Per_5x5x5&quot;. I did 
all the moves with figures. This way they should be obvious even for 
those who know nothing about cube notation.

Please also not that the second case has a shorter solution. But the 
one i gave is very consistent with the first one :-)

1 R2F2R2 (0 group of 2) lucky case            1    no change

I use 3, R2D&#x27;F2D2R2D&#x27;R2 (2 group of 2)  

My fewest move UFRB + R2D2F2D&#x27;F2 + D&#x27;.  F2D2R2D&#x27;R2 same R2D2F2D&#x27;F2 
axis another R = F.  20 secondes in slow move inspection is not 
difficult.   

Orient or permute first, that&#x27;s the human question for alorythm god. 
All orient is fewest that 11 move. My english ?  Option 2,  I return 
my first case. 

Cube station 14/05 L R U2 (F&#x27; L B&#x27; L&#x27;)*4 U R&#x27;(L&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U)*4 R&#x27; L&#x27; 
U2  my solution is FL&#x27;
 
All orient corner I looked my bad lucky case. I return my first case 
for the function 5 to right F&#x27;RF&#x27;L2FR&#x27;F&#x27;L2F2 and I solve 
F2LDF2DR&#x27;D&#x27;RD&#x27;F2D fewest move 2x2x2. Is not very difficult!

Hand man only! My sytem is probably the great one! 

The fastest cubist 3x3x3 or fastest 5x5x5 Who is the better? 
The fewest move cubist 3x3x3 or 2x2x2 who is the better?  

The fastest 40x40x40? :))

I don&#x27;t Know but I had a beautifull theory for 3x3x3 fastest method 
for you Mirek. I need your experience. Beaucoup d&#x27;algorithme à

and i think what you&#x27;ve said is true
its very hard to go slower
i would like to ask if anyone is below 30 seconds average with the 
petrus method and how long he/she took to do it as i am finding it 
difficult to go under 40 seconds.

after one memorized all 500-ish algs.. but it takes a lot of 
determination.

but for most cubers, personalized fridrich is good enough for 
sub15..if your name is macky, you can definetly get sub15 on 
fridrich. most cubers that know more than one method usually combine 
algorithms...again, if your name is macky, you know a lot of 
methods..combined, its very effective.

          <div class="email-content">The rules I have written are because currently, the StackMat is the <br>
only commercially produced time for Rubik&#x27;s cubing.  When the new timer <br>
coms out, of course we&#x27;ll have to revise the rules.  It shouldn&#x27;t be <br>
that much of a change.  I think the judge can still cover the cube and <br>
everything.  we just have to make sure that the competitor picks up the <br>
cube before making a move.  Sure... it&#x27;s a seemingly insignificant <br>
advantage to make an U or U&#x27; turn, but it&#x27;s still something necessary <br>

Do you count 180 moves as 1, or as 2 quarter turns?

Anyway, counting them as a full turn, I would say I do about 50-60
moves for F2L and about 30 or so for LL. About 40 moves for F2L 
counting a 180 twist as 1, and about 25 or so for LL(most of LL is 
triggers and fast column moves)


I average about 30-35 seconds for F2L and then about 10-15 seconds 
for LL.

Is that too many moves? I&#x27;m only using the basic algorithms, and for 
the most part I don&#x27;t break up the completed sections for the F2L.

          <div class="email-content">He averages 40 moves if he looks for solutions, going for speed he <br>
goes around 60. If you look a bit and go fast, I believe going 50 <br>
move is very possible. Although this should be about like the <br>
Fridrich Method, about 56 moves. Sorry I was mistaken, I forgot to <br>
calculate the cross into her method.<br>
<br>
2x2x2 = 7 moves <br>
2x2x3 = + 7 moves <br>
Orient edges = +5<br>
2x2x3 + 2x2 = +7<br>
Complete F2L = +7<br>
<br>
Yields 35 moves about since I can never do the 2x2x3 in 7 moves if I <br>
go for speed, In fact I do about 10.<br>
<br>
Up to this stage I changed my last layer approach<br>
<br>
Orient all -&gt; 9 moves<br>
Permutate all -&gt; 12 moves <br>
<br>
56 moves<br>
<br>
For Petrus - &gt; <br>
Permutate corners -&gt; 8 moves <br>
Orient corners -&gt; 12 moves<br>
Permutate Edges -&gt; 9 moves<br>
<br>
66 moves.<br>
<br>
I believe it is very possible to shorten the number of moves for the <br>
first 2 steps although I&#x27;ll leave it those case to the lucky <br>
situations.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Generally, there is no &quot;in stone&quot; rules for how to approach the cross, 
since it is really intuitive, and a guy being able to solve the cube 
with Petrus&#x27; method should in any case be able to do the cross.

You then go on placing each first layer corner in together with its 
corresponding second layer edge simultaneously. Several sites provide 
algorithms for this, and I do suggest you begin by learning a few 
algorithms, but when you get experienced at the F2L you&#x27;ll notice how 
you don&#x27;t need any strict step-by-step solving of this phase either. 
For the beginner, however, I&#x27;d suggest looking through the algorithms 
at www.rubiks.dk. Which is where I started. Should be more than enough 
to help you get started at the F2L.

Note that for you to be able to execute one of the algorithms, the 
corner piece must either be on the last layer (&quot;top&quot; layer, if you 
have the F2L on bottom, which I recommend) or already in its correct 
position, same with the edge piece. There are no algorithms given for 
when the corner or the edge or both reside &quot;stuck away&quot; in one of the 
other F2L slots. If you ever reach a position where no F2L pair is 
solvable due to each of them having one or both pieces &quot;stuck away&quot; 
like this, you need to transfer the piece(s) in question to the top 
layer and then proceed.

As mentioned, when you get a feel of the F2L method, you really can 
step out of this rigid rulebook and the F2L becomes more &quot;fluid&quot;.

Good luck on learning the LL algs, though!

Not necessarily. If you said this because of Chris&#x27;s 18.50 blindfold 
solve then let me say I think he himself said it might be possible 
to be faster than one hour.

Also, that&#x27;s not the only way to do it. You can plan ahead the whole 
solution using a normal blindfold method and then it&#x27;s far less than 
an hour.

But I agree that planning ahead is still blindfold solving as long 
as you don&#x27;t make any turns before you put on the blindfold. That&#x27;s 
my opinion now after hearing that answer from others at the Dutch 
cube day.

More strictly, during memorization/planning I don&#x27;t allow myself to 
write anything down or any other help (e.g. a list of algorithms). 
It&#x27;s just me and the puzzle(s).

Cheers!
Stefan

Read on, you might think the idea is rubbish but at least you will <br>
have a good laugh.<br>
So remember where you heard it first :-)<br>
<br>
1. Do the whole of the first face in one look. (calm down, I&#x27;ll <br>
explain later).<br>
2. Solve two of the second layer edges in one move.<br>
3. Solve the other two second layer edges and orient the last layer <br>
edges in one move.<br>
4. Orient last layer corners and permute last layer edges and <br>
corners in one move (as per ZB method).<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know how many turns this would take (I&#x27;d guess about 45) but <br>
at least there arent many looks (3 less than the standard Fridrich <br>
method) so pauses would be cut down.<br>
&#x27;Yes but step 1 is impossible&#x27; I hear you say. You may well be <br>
correct but I think that it might be possible for an extremely <br>
gifted and dedicated cubist. Quite a few people can do the extended <br>
cross and sometimes even double-extended cross. I think step 1 might <br>
be slightly easier than the double extended cross because all the <br>
pieces you are trying to follow in your head during planning have <br>
the same color on them.<br>
This may never work but I think if people ever want to get down <br>
closer to 10 seconds it&#x27;s going to take a real leap of faith.<br>

--------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Below is a response to a different message than the one above, I <br>
just didn&#x27;t want to send two posts to the group.  <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&gt; I just thought about this and had an idea: Why not modify Fridrich <br>
&gt; (the method, not the person ;-) a bit? What I mean is to not solve <br>
&gt; the first layer correctly at first. Do F2L Fridrich-style but <br>
don&#x27;t <br>
&gt; care about permutation and orientation inside the first <br>
&gt;layer.............................<br>
<br>
Stefan, I&#x27;ve been thinking about your idea here and I think it would <br>
definitely decrease the memorization time, and yet still let you do <br>
very fast solves.  I think if you are interested in getting a sub-20 <br>
blindfolded solve (not including memorization) that you need to use <br>
a purely Fridrich method based approach.  I noticed for my solve <br>
that I actually wasn&#x27;t going quite full speed for some steps (i.e. <br>
the first 9 moves and OLL and PLL) becuase I didn&#x27;t want to get <br>
lost, or misturn a face and forget where I was.<br>
<br>
I think doing the memorizing and solving your way would be very <br>
fast, but due to nervousness and not wanting to apply your moves at <br>
full speed (to avoid pops and mess-ups) that it probably wouldn&#x27;t <br>
achieve a sub-20 blindfolded solve unless you were turning the faces <br>
very quickly.  I can definitely see sub-30 being very achievable <br>
doing it this way though.<br>
<br>
The key to memorizing fast for this method is to decrease the number <br>
of steps where you know what alg you have to apply to get to the <br>
next step, and you have to apply that alg over and over in your head <br>
to track where all the remaining pieces will end up.  These steps <br>
take a lot of time to do.  I thought a lot about how to reduce the <br>
number and complexity of these steps, which was why my second <br>
attempt at solving like this went a lot faster than my first.<br>
<br>
As long as you try to minimize those tracking steps and also <br>
decrease the length of each one, then I think that method would work <br>
out very well.  You could do most of the F2L pairs as simple RUR&#x27; or <br>
RU&#x27;R&#x27; moves to solve the pairs since you don&#x27;t care how the corners <br>
will be oriented and placed.  This would make each tracking step <br>
only 3 or 4 moves long which would go very fast.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to give this a shot at some point and see how it works <br>
out.  You sound like you are already planning this method out or are <br>
about to try it, so let us know if it works out well if you try it <br>
soon.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
&gt; I just thought about this and had an idea: Why not modify Fridrich <br>
&gt; (the method, not the person ;-) a bit? What I mean is to not solve <br>
&gt; the first layer correctly at first. Do F2L Fridrich-style but <br>
don&#x27;t <br>
&gt; care about permutation and orientation inside the first layer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Then follow F2L with an OFL and PFL and then of course OLL and <br>
PLL. <br>
&gt; This would allow a shorter and easier F2L which might make <br>
planning <br>
&gt; ahead the whole solution easier/safer/faster. Also, execution of <br>
the <br>
&gt; planned solution would still be quite fast.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If you really ignore permutation and orientation of the first <br>
layer <br>
&gt; then of course you only have a 1/12 chance that OFL/PFL works. But <br>
&gt; taking care of orientation is very simple (e.g. corners <br>
orientation <br>
&gt; with last CE pair during F2L, edges orientation during cross) <br>
which <br>
&gt; leaves a 1/2 chance because of permutation. Either you&#x27;re lucky or <br>
&gt; you do it with the last two CE pairs or you apply a fixing alg <br>
&gt; between U and D sometime during the solution.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; What do you think?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Cheers!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks! I am able to do the cross fairly easily but as far as setting 
the corner edge sets I have not found an especially fast way to do

learned how to solve it using a link from chris hardwick&#x27;s page<br>
(thanks, btw), and, although it is a beginner&#x27;s solution, it is the<br>
method i used to get 1:13 (about, timing wasnt exact, and i doubt if i<br>
have recorded 12 times in a row yet) and I am interested in becoming<br>
faster. My current average (nowhere near exact, as i dont have any<br>
reliable way of timing it) is about a minute and a half, not counting<br>
lucky cases. I have been looking at various speedcubing methods, but<br>
am boggling at the amount of algorithms to memorize. I figure that<br>
once i get started, it wont be that difficult to memorize (i have a<br>
good, sharp memory), but its like climbing everest... :P<br>

          <div class="email-content">I posted some of my strategies to solving the extended cross on my 
webpage a while back.  You can read it at 
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/f2l.html

I really only described how I went from practicing forming a 2x2x2 
into direct solving the extended cross.  I gave a few examples in 
the examples section, but not very many.  If you are interested in 
double extended cross solves, there is a 7 or 8 move double cross 
for my &quot;difficult&quot; example on my examples page.  I gave a 10 move 
extended cross alg, but it turns out that a 7 or 8 move double 
extended cross exists for that scramble.

For the double extended cross in general there really isn&#x27;t much I 
can say other than to practice solving it a lot.  I can step you 
though an example of one, but really you just have to practice them 
a lot.

I used a double extended cross to get started for my blindfolded 
solve that I posted about earlier.

Here was the scramble, B&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; B L&#x27; U2 F L2 B&#x27; R L F2 U&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; U 
B L2 D2 L&#x27; U2 B&#x27; R2 F

and the double extended cross I found was 
L&#x27; R D2 L&#x27; F&#x27; U D&#x27; L B&#x27;

Here&#x27;s how I found it:

1) The first thing I noticed when I saw this scramble is that the BR 
pair is already placed together and is in DFL-DL.  I also noticed 
that by doing the move L&#x27; I would form a 2x2x1 piece in the DL-DFL-
DF postion.  So after 1 move, L&#x27;, I have a 2x2x1 piece and a 2x1x1 
piece placed together.

2) The FR piece (the piece in FR when the cube is solved) can be 
placed into it&#x27;s correct location with the alg D2 F&#x27; so I want to 
try to incorporate this into my solution somehow if I can

3) If I do L&#x27; D2 F&#x27; D&#x27; then I solve the FR 2x2x2 cube

4) If I do L&#x27; D2 L&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; I still form the 2x2x2, but I also put the 
BR edge pair into the U layer, giving me more freedom to move it 
around later should I need to.  The DL piece is also in a good 
location, I only need to do L to solve it from here.  Also notice 
that after applying that first alg, if I do U B&#x27; then I place BR 
into it&#x27;s correct location (without the DB edge piece solved though).

5) from the very beginning of the scramble there is a way to setup 
the DB piece such that I can use it later.  Do L&#x27; R from the very 
beginning scramble.  This puts the DB edge piece ready to be solved 
with a B&#x27; move and still sets up my original move to solve the 
2x2x2.  If you read #4, using that move I can solve the BR edge 
piece with the move U B&#x27;.  So if from the very beginning I do L&#x27; R 
then I am ready to solve the BR edge pair and the DB piece, after 
having already formed a 2x2x2.

6) Now we have the whole solution:
a) L&#x27; R (form a 2x2x1 and place the DB piece ready to be solved with 
a B&#x27; move)
b) D2 (the FR piece can now be solved with only a F&#x27; turn)
c) L&#x27; (get the BR edge pair into the top layer so that it has more 
freedom to move later)
d) F&#x27; (place the FR piece into its correct location and prepare the 
DL piece to be solved with only a L turn)
e) U (form a 2x2x1 on the B face)
f) D&#x27; (finish the 2x2x2 around FR)
g) L (solve the DB piece)
h) B&#x27; (solve the 2x2x1 on the back face with the rest of the F2L)

And that&#x27;s how I found that particular one.  I really don&#x27;t have 
much more advice for extended or double extended cross solves other 
than what is on my website.  All I can say is to practice finding 
them on scrambles as much and as often as you can.  After a while 
you get just as comfortable doing an extended cross solve as with a 
normal cross solve.

Hope that helps some,
Chris

P.S. what is the X cross?  Is that the same thing as extended cross?

If you really need to look at the icons to learn the algorithms, then <br>
you could just save the icons to your hard drive from his webpage and <br>
learn Fridrich your own way using the icons. Just goto:<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/peter/<br>

sit down and practice a bit with the notation. It seems akward at <br>
first, but with little practice you don&#x27;t even have to think about <br>
the notation to exectute the algs.<br>

What do u mean &quot;4 rows&quot; ?? I suppose u refer to the first diagram, 
but i can&#x27;t figure out exactly what u mean.

And by the way, how do u prepare ur Rubik&#x27;s Clock?? Is it possible to

Hmm I just don&#x27;t think I can see the moves fast enough yet... like I 
can&#x27;t decide fast enough whether to use one method of F2L or another 
method(especially in S2 and S4), so it ends up being faster to just 
use a set method, but then sometimes you lose time when another 
method would have been faster but I just couldn&#x27;t recognize it in 
time.

I probably need to work on looking for pieces for the next step while 
I&#x27;m still finishing the twist on previous step, but I&#x27;m happy where I

2 months after I started cubing, I was nowhere near under a minute 
with my times! How do you all improve so fast!

I think it is lucky that I have 2 years practice over you, or you 
would all be kicking my behind I&#x27;m sure.

Keep on practicing, you can all be under 30 seconds at least! (Most 
probably under 20 too)

<br>
<br>
  Hi,<br>
       I&#x27;ve been using the Petrus method for some time now. I have <br>
  gotten my time down to abou 1 minute 5 seconds on average. I have <br>
  heard good things about the Fridrich method and wanted to try it but <br>
  I don&#x27;t completely understand the diagrams and explaination of the <br>
  method on Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s homepage. Could anyone point out a <br>
  better explaination or explain it better to me? I understand the part <br>
  of getting a cross on the bottom and getting corner and edge pairs <br>
  locked into the four remaining corner positions on the first two <br>
  layers but I don&#x27;t know the fastest method to do this. Any help would <br>
  be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>

That&#x27;s why I created a site with diagrams for the jessica fridrich&#x27;s method. I think it&#x27;s easier to learn many and many algorithms. <br>

<br>
<br>
  what do you guys think of adam&#x27;s solution?<br>
<br>
  http://www.ai.sri.com/~cheyer/rubiks/rubiks.html<br>
<br>
  its faster than the layer by layer, but not as fast as the fidrich. <br>
  I like the website because i find it much easier to follow icons <br>
  telling you what moves to do than just a series of letters <br>
  like &quot;F&#x27;L²B&#x27;R B L B&#x27;R&#x27;B&quot;. for some reason i just cant memorize <br>
  patterns as well when they&#x27;re in that letter form. right now i <br>
  average about 1 minute 20 seconds using the layer by layer method. <br>
  is there a website with icons that is better than adam&#x27;s solution? <br>
  any suggestions would be appreciated. <br>

          <div class="email-content">If you are using corners first, you can probably get fast enough just 
by learning the algs to permute/orient the second layer corners at 
once.  I have been using :
1) First layer corners
2) First Layer edges(except one)
3) Second layer conrners in one look
4) Three second layer edges
5) Last first or second layer edge, whichever is fastest
6) Last remaining layer edge while orienting the middle edges
7) Position middle edges.

I have been avg 23-24 with this method.  Not sub-20 like some here, 
but then I wasn&#x27;t able to do sub-20 using Fridrich either.  You don&#x27;t 
need to know a ton of algs for the above method but you have to spin 
lightning fast.

          <div class="email-content">Amazingly I got under 1 minute that fast because I wanted to beat <br>
this kid at school who would do it in 1 min 10. Then when I beat him <br>
with 47 seconds he started trying to beat me again and mainly I just <br>
wanted to stay on top of him :D<br>
<br>
I mostly never look ahead on my steps, I probably just have the <br>
advantage of fast twisting speed, with looking ahead I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll <br>
break the 30 seconds average mark. <br>
<br>
The only steps where I look infront are transition from step 2-3 <br>
which makes it look like 1 step. <br>
<br>
With the Petrus method, you should be able to enter the last <br>
edge/corner piece (4B) in maximum 2 seconds, go all speed for that <br>
one. <br>
<br>
I also look for 3-4. When you can easily look for the corner you need <br>
(I just watch for the corner, the edges are easier). After you&#x27;re <br>
done orienting edges you can already attempt to match the corner to <br>
an edge. <br>
<br>
Keep going, the if you&#x27;ve reached 55 seconds, you&#x27;ll reach 40 in no <br>
time. Under that is the big deal.<br>

I would too. The Petrus method is a simple yet very efficient. After 
you can start blending it with other methods.

the second one there is THE BEST beginner&#x27;s solution... it is a very good solution which you can implement on any type of cube and is the groundworks for many much more advanced solutions.

          <div class="email-content">When I first started cubing, (18 months ago roughly), there weren&#x27;t <br>
really that many people that were breaking 20 seconds on average.  <br>
Currently however, there are plenty of people doing it.  I always <br>
figured that if you were sub-20 you were part of an &#x27;elite&#x27; group of <br>
cubers.  With people breaking 16 seconds now, does breaking 20 <br>
really put you in an extraordinary position in the cubing <br>
community?  I suppose it&#x27;s all a matter or judgment, or perception.  <br>
I&#x27;m using F2L and a 3 look right now.  (i still have to learn about <br>
half of the orientations.)  Tonight I broke my previous PB average.<br>
<br>
It ended up being 21.52 seconds.<br>
21.7 21.67 29.42 POP 20.77 19.97 22.06 19.22 23.1 20.1 22.97 22.88 <br>
19.99 <br>
<br>
We won&#x27;t pay attention to that 29.42 that snuck in there :P  <br>
<br>
Of course, a personal best average doesn&#x27;t represent a persons <br>
consistent times.  Usually my times are floating around 23 seconds.  <br>
A better understanding of the F2L has made cubing a little faster <br>
when I&#x27;m &#x27;in the zone&#x27;.  Anyway, sorry about the long post, but I <br>
figured I&#x27;d throw something out here on the forum.  <br>
<br>
Good luck with cubing! :)<br>

Good Luck with that. Just out of interest, if your times are only 
just over 20 secs, and you use a 3 look LL, what does that make your 
F2L times like?

&gt; What do u mean &quot;4 rows&quot; ?? I suppose u refer to the first diagram, <br>

<br>
This diagram looks like a 5x4x? to me:<br>

&gt; r   r   w   r   r<br>
&gt; r   r   r    r   r<br>
&gt; r   r   r    r   r<br>
&gt; r   r   y   r   r<br>
<br>
&gt; And by the way, how do u prepare ur Rubik&#x27;s Clock?? Is it possible<br>
to <br>
&gt; use silicone somehow. Is there a trick to disassemble it perhaps ?<br>
<br>
Break it ;-)<br>
<br>
Well, that&#x27;s what I did. It&#x27;s glued together so I don&#x27;t see another<br>
way. But if you do it carefully you can do it with only very little<br>
damage. I can post pictures later of my clock with which I did this. I<br>
used a sharp rectangular knife like this one:<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/images/Center_Remove.JPG<br>
<br>
However, my current records at speedcubing.com (9.03 single, 10.59<br>
average) and at the German Open (9.54) were all done on an unprepared<br>
clock!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jim,

Interesting idea for a new cube method.  I also read your post about 
whether or not it would be possible to solve the first layer in one 
look, so I&#x27;ll mention my thoughts on that too.

As far as inspecting and solving the first layer in one look, I 
think it would be possible but rather difficult.  You have to follow 
and track 8 pieces in your head during inspection to try to solve 
the first layer like that, which is equivalent to doing a double 
extended cross (2x2x3 and one other edge or two 2x2x2&#x27;s on opposite 
edges of the cube).  I have done double extended cross solves before 
with only 15 seconds of inspection, and gotten fast times, however 
those cases are very, very rare.  You have to already have a 
corner/edge pair put together and some first layer edges already in 
the first layer, or a very easy to solve 2x2x2 setup in order to 
even consider doing a double extended cross solve.  The analog to 
this in your method would be to already have 2 or 3 pieces placed 
together, such that you can manuever them into their correct spots 
easily.  You might be able to figure out half of the first layer 
during inspection, and try to look ahead to do that rest when you 
start solving.  If you&#x27;re interested in this just in general I would 
estimate that you could solve the first layer in one look with 5-20 
minutes of inspection every time depending on how hard of a case it 
is.  If it is one of those very rare easier cases you could do it in 
15 seconds, so it all depends.

As far as solving the middle edges once you have the first layer 
done, I think that would possibly be efficient, however it might 
take a lot of algs to memorize.

After finishing the F2L there are 8*7*4 = 224 positions that any two 
given middle layer edges can be in.  If you take out rotational 
symmetries of spinning the cube with the move y then you&#x27;ll probably 
get around 56 positions.  There will of course be other symmetries 
and things like that to reduce this number, but you may end up 
having to learn around 100 algs including inverses and reflections 
and all.

For the last two edges, and orientations of the top layer edges 
there are 2*6*5*32 = 1920 total positions the cube can be in.  Again 
there will be things like symmetries to reduce this number, but it 
will still probably end up being a large number of algs.

Doing the LL as per the ZB method takes a lot of algs to memorize 
already, so in total this method will probably be extremely fast 
however it will take a very large number of algs to be memorized.  
As a rough guess I&#x27;d say 550-600 algs.

-------------------

Also to clear things up a bit, I do use the extended cross approach 
frequently when I&#x27;m solving and even on timed speedsolves, but only 
if things are already set up fairly well for me.  If they aren&#x27;t, I 
definitely solve using just the cross.  I can&#x27;t solve using the 
extended cross every time and get good averages.  I&#x27;ve read that 
Macky and some others use the extended cross, and maybe they can do 
this, but I definitely can&#x27;t.

Chris

New Average: 44.47583333 SECONDS!!!!!!

Finally a run taken when I wasn&#x27;t tired or distracted. My 2x2x2 is 
alot faster, and I&#x27;m thinking about learning some sequences to solve 
4 or 6 bad edges instead of doing them in pairs of 2....

Thanks for reading, good luck with your cubing everyone!

halfway through memorizing it, but i got stuck somewhere....so for
some reason i went to nerdparadise.com...and i finished off with that

here is an average i got during first period today...

70.67, 65.02, 63.86, 58.90, 66.02, 56.66, (44.07), 51.17, 66.62,
70.70, 62.57, 57.62, (75.50) => 61.92

That 44.07 was actually not a lucky solve, i just had the easiest
cases for each step (that is, the fastest for me). I don&#x27;t consider it
a lucky solve, because i sort of molded the two part OLL into
one...even though it is still basically two steps. Also, it is
thirteen solves, but im too lazy to re-average it. I used the Cube
Timer program off of this website. The only real problem i have with
this method is that i only have one algorithm for OLL, which is
something like R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2R (i solve with the cross on the bottom).
Basically, there are only like twelve possible posititions of the
corners using this pattern, but the obvious problem is that there is
only one orientation in which you can get this algorithm to orient the
corners correctly, so you end up having to do the algorithm multiple
times, with U turns or cube turns to get the orientation cases right.
I am, however, considering pursuing Petrus&#x27;s method, because it
doesn&#x27;t seem to be too hard (at least, i think).

          <div class="email-content">For step 3, there arent &quot;sequences&quot; to learn but rather how the move <br>
works, then you can do it REALLY fast and just save a move because <br>
you&#x27;ve spotted it while turning. As you know, you can both do R and R-<br>
 to fix the edges. <br>
<br>
If you do R U R-, then the edge that was initially at the UR still <br>
remains there, if its not well oriented, you can then follow doing : <br>
<br>
R U R2 (instead of R-) and like F- R to fix the Originally at DF. <br>
<br>
Its basically learning how it works, I doubt the sequences there will <br>
help you go quicker. Instead learn the 4B sequences.<br>

          <div class="email-content">yea,... the first solution really kinda sucks... but the second solution is really good... like i had started with the first solution and it usually took me about 2 minutes... but after a week with the second solution, i was down to sub-minute times. but the petrus method is good too, except you have to rely a lot on intuition. anyways, whichever one you choose, itll be better than the first solution.

The move you mention is a &quot;Sune&quot;.<br>
<br>
You can do it both ways, like, with your left hand or with your right <br>

<br>
And, also, doing sunes, the MAXIMUM number of times you&#x27;ll have to do <br>
it is TWICE to have all the corners oriented. <br>

That is not my diagram ;-) Well anyway i have come up with a way to 
do those 2 cases that are both of them pure 3-cycles. The alg given 
in the second of my pictures/diagrams was really a 5-cycle (see 
Photos/Per_5x5x5). Here are the new algs written in commutator 
notation:

1: [U&#x27;,MB&#x27;d2BM&#x27;]
2: [U&#x27;,r&#x27;B&#x27;d2Br]

They are not in any way optimised for speed, just clean solutions :-)

Not sure if i dare to break my Clock. On my clock (original Matchbox) 
it seems the upper and lower part are not glued together, but there 
are 4 points of &quot;screw-welding&quot;/snaplock. Anyhow it looks like that ;-

If it is a fast solution that you are after, then you could use the 
2-look method that I use.

First I solve the bottom layer intuitively, much like you would 
solve the cross on a 3x3x3. Then I solve the final layer in one 
look, using one of 40 odd COLL algorithms (which I also use for the 
3x3x3) These Orient and Permute the corners simultaneously, thus 
solving the layer in one go.

          <div class="email-content">Whatever you do don&#x27;t throw that cube away.  If you have any 
interest in one handed 3x3x3 cubing at all, then your cube is just 
about perfect for it.  My one handed cube used to be my main 
speedcube.  However, it too got to the point where I would rotate a 
corner by hitting it during a finger trick, things like that.

Once a cube starts to get as loose as yours is, it&#x27;s pretty much 
perfect for one handed cubing.  So whatever you do, don&#x27;t think that 
it is &quot;worn out&quot; or &quot;too old&quot;.  It&#x27;s actually just starting to turn 
into a good cube :)

P.S. I too popped about 8 pieces off my loose cube one time, so I 
know the feeling :)

          <div class="email-content">Really... one handed... I&#x27;ve got to try that once. Well, you see, I 
recently switched to my &quot;backup&quot; cube (one I just had lying around)

this cube lacks the orange center cap, so I got that center cap from

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
since some people are currently searching for their own methods<br>
to solve the cube (or trying to improve some particular steps)<br>
I have released a new version of my ACube program - 3.1a.<br>
It requires only Java runtime 1.1+ installed and<br>
can be run on any Java enabled platform.<br>
<br>
The program accepts incomplete cube configurations<br>
 - can ignore permutation and/or orientation of specified cubies<br>
 - supports quarter, face, and slice turn metrics<br>
 - supports slice moves<br>
 - suports defining leading and trailing moves not counted<br>
   in a solution (e.g. leading and trailing U turs in OLL of F2L)<br>
 - turns allowed in a solution can be restricted<br>
   (e.g. to U, M, and R turns for Waterman&#x27;s method or<br>
   to U, D, R2, L2, F2, and B2 for Rubik&#x27;s domino)<br>
 - allows searching for optimal or sub-optimal (Kociemba-like)<br>
   sequences in the supported metrics<br>
<br>
Warning: the program is controlled from command line and<br>
defining the proper input is quite tricky...<br>

The problem is that three axes are fixed (the small black
boxes with four pins have square shaped holes) and
one corner should be fixed in the position between those
fixed axes.
It is done using two bigger and one little different
pie shaped pieces (the latter is hard to distinguish).
Try to find these three pie pieces and use them for the
fixed corner.

Great result, slowing down is the best way to practice your look-a-
head for the F2L. After a while you can speedup your turning.

I normally practice without timing but it is about 32 seconds (my 
avarage is 28), only when setting a new avarage I first warm-up with 
a few slow sloves. And then start turning as fast as I can.

          <div class="email-content">ok i nee dquite i a few things i dunno if ill be able to think of <br>
them all.<br>
well i started earlier this month with te solution on <br>
nerdparadise.com or whatever becuase all the other ones were too hard <br>
for me to understand. if you are not familiar with it then its just a <br>
simple way of looking at the layer by layer method.SO my average is <br>
about 1 minute 20-30 seconds but in sum lucky ocassions ive gotten 54-<br>
56 seconds, is there any way of simply learning more algorithms for <br>
bottom layer or anyhting else you can think of to drastically change <br>
my time, prefereably under a minute. OR anything else you may think <br>
will help me. as far as lubing my cube i only very lightly put <br>
vaseline on the inside edges and whatnot being afraid of the results, <br>
i havent had any problems but i think it can be better. should i use <br>
a silicone spray, if so what kind or wheres and easy place to get it. <br>
also the platic layers on my stickersa are coming off and ive already <br>
had to use sum paint pen to fix it. wats an easy way to fix that <br>
problem, ive heard of vinyl tape, but can you buy all the colors and <br>
will they not fall off. also to do with the first subject, what are <br>
sum finger movements i could use and wat is this F2L thing i hear so <br>
much about...<br>
anyways thanks<br>

          <div class="email-content">I too use that method, and, although its not very good ive gotten my
times with it down to about a minute 10 secs on average. I also solve
with the cross on the bottom, because it gives the freedom for finger
tricks. Like the guys here told me, you should take a look at the
Petrus method...at http://www.lar5.com/cube i think. It will be a
different way of solving the cube (its a corners first method), but it
will teach you how to form your own algorithms, and you can blend his
algorithms smoothly with most others. 
As for lubrication, use silicone spray. I bought a big can of it at
wal-mart for about 3 dollars, and it will probably last me years. One
thing though, before the silicone dries it will act like a
glue...making it harder to turn. However, if you just cube with it, or
dry it out using a hair-dryer, then once it dries, it will turn much
easier, and the lube will last for months. 
As for the stickers, mine are coming off as well, but im not too
worried about it. as long as i can still distinguish the colors i
don&#x27;t want to replace them. I&#x27;ve heard vinyl tape is pretty good. some
people even paint theirs. If you&#x27;re worried about colors, you have to
remember that your cube doesnt have to have the same color patterns as
everyone elses. 
For finger tricks, go to dan knight&#x27;s page at
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints , he
even has videos of the tricks, to help you. 

Here is a rundown of the acronyms:

F2L: This just stands for &#x27;First two layers&#x27;, and refers to algorithms
used to place a number of cubies in their respective spots in the F2L.
The F2L in any solve are usually the slowest, because you have to look
for the colors, and where they are, and all that.

OLL: Orientation of Last Layer: This is just algorithms to flip and
twist cubies as necessary to get the LL color on the actual LL. 

PLL: Permutation of Last Layer: These algorithms are used to permute
(move) the corners and edges of the LL, so that they are in the right
spot, regarless of orientation. Some moves will flip orientations,
some wont.


Well, after that longwinded response, i hope i answered
everything...if not, tell me, and i&#x27;ll help in any way that i can.

dont you mean lbl? but yeah...my mistake. sorry for the
misinformation. i probably should&#x27;ve mention that i, too, am still a
cubing noob, so if the other guys correct me, assume that they&#x27;re
right. :(

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Michiel van der Blonk&quot; &lt;blonkm@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> &lt;speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Thu, 20 May 2004 04:12:13 -0400<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">hi all,<br>
I see some questions from newbies, and I would like to answer them in a way<br>
that would have made me happy when I started learning the Fridrich method.<br>
<br>
Now to start with Jessica&#x27;s pages themselves: terrible, sorry to say. No<br>
applets, not a lot of explanation. But well, ok, all the algs are there. For<br>
any situation you can find two or more algs. Especially difficult to read in<br>
the beginning is the Fa, Fs, Ba&#x27;, etc. Remember that &#x27;s&#x27; stand for slice and<br>
&#x27;a&#x27; for antislice. Then, an Fs must mean FB&#x27;, since it is a slice move in<br>
the direction of F. And Fa must mean FB, since the B moves in the opposite<br>
direction of F (that is what the anti means).<br>
My applet page (under construction) will show you a lot of these moves and<br>
how they work. I translated all the algs in the more well known 6 letter<br>
notation (FRUBLD).<br>
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet_test.asp<br>
About the funny pictures you see everywere, with the nine little squares:<br>
these depict the cube seen from above, looking at the last layer. The small<br>
dash next to a square means this cubie is rotated/flipped. So the color that<br>
normally is on top, is now on the side where you see the dash (or x, or<br>
whatever).<br>
The other notation, seen on Ron&#x27;s site: the little squares have a + or - in<br>
them. This is mostly used for corners, and it means that the corner is<br>
rotated clockwise (+) or counter clockwise (-).<br>
<br>
Second, I find the explanations on most pages rather cryptic. I suggest to<br>
always use a page with java applets so that people can actually see what is<br>
happening. I have to say, Dan Harris&#x27;s pages are the best in that aspect:<br>
www.cubestation.co.uk<br>
Of course you should check out his notation page, and remember that a<br>
lowercase character means: move a &#x27;two layer thick layer&#x27; at once. So when<br>
you perform &#x27;u&#x27; for instance, you hold the D layer steady and move the upper<br>
two layers clockwise. This is equivalent to a D followed by a cube turn<br>
clockwise (also called Y). Oh, right, these are also cryptic.<br>
This is a handy translation of the cube rotations:<br>
X - R<br>
Y - U<br>
Z - F<br>
So just remember RUF, and then for X you look at the R face, and turn the<br>
cube clockwise.<br>
<br>
Another incredibly good overview is given by Jon Morris, the pages may take<br>
a long time to load: http://www.geocities.com/nascarjon2001/<br>
<br>
I hope this will help, and I have been there. I think the applet pages help<br>
a lot, and I don&#x27;t think Mark Jeays simple solution is simple: there are no<br>
applets and the page takes forever to read. I prefer Jasmine&#x27;s pages for a<br>
simple solution.<br>
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html<br>
<br>
My last tip for every one who asked: &#x27;I am averaging one minute and I want<br>
to become faster without any effort&#x27;. Start using the working corner method<br>
- cross<br>
- three corners<br>
- three f2l edges<br>
- last corner<br>
- last edge<br>
now you can continue with the easiest (but still very very fast)<br>
- oell (2 algs)<br>
- pcll (1 or 2 algs)<br>
- ocll (1 alg)<br>
- pell (3 algs)<br>
<br>
good luck<br>

          <div class="email-content">Not all kinds of cubes are good with finger tricks. I know, for 
instance, one kind of &quot;assembly&quot; cube just doesn&#x27;t work with them at 
all, and there are numerous kinds of &quot;bogus&quot; chinese/taiwanese etc. 
cubes around that just don&#x27;t work very well. If you have one of these, 
then I suggest just get a new one right away.

If you have an &quot;good&quot; cube on the other hand, like an old IDEAL or 
Arxon cube, or an Oddzon (rubiks.com) cube, or maybe a Studio Cube, 
then I reckon your cube is just really stiff and rigid. Stretching the 
centers with toothsticks, lubrication and just lots of random turning 
and twisting should allow finger tricks after a while.

If you have never replaced the stickers on your cube, you can probably 
decide on wether it&#x27;s a &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; cube by checking if there&#x27;s a 
logo on the center white sticker. If you have a logo like the one seen 
here: http://dev.rubiks.com/index.cfm ... you&#x27;ve got a rubiks.com 
(Oddzon) cube which should work okay. I don&#x27;t really know a lot about 
distinguishing different cube types. Maybe someone else can help you 
with that.

By the way, I&#x27;d recommend against using vaseline. Vaseline is a 
petroleum based product and it will eat away the plastic. I used 
vaseline on my cube once and it didn&#x27;t really ruin it, but I wiped it 
off and sprayed with silicone instead. Now it works really good.

Cheers,
Eivind Fonn

Greetings,

   I think Rubiks.com sells lubricant and stickers together. I use 3M
non-oil-based silcone spray. I got it at an auto supply. 3m has a
website maybe you can find a store that carries it. 

   You don&#x27;t want to use vaseline.

   As for finding ways to go faster, you could always try to figure
out some yourself. For me that&#x27;s the real fun of the cube.

   Everyone assumes that speedcubing is all about memory and fast
hands, but remember that when Rubik&#x27;s cube first came out that many
people solved it with no help at all.

Regards,

David J

<br>
this is just a note to say the Rubik&#x27;s competition timer journal has <br>
been updated.<br>
<br>
a new 65x132 pixel graphical LCD has been chosen, which will enable <br>
the timer to display random cube scrambles, and other graphic <br>
images.  this is obviously a great improvement over the original 5 <br>
digit numeric LCD i was looking at.  the cost difference is so small <br>
that it&#x27;s a no-brainer to go with it.<br>
<br>
You can visit the competition timer home page at:<br>
http://www.mission-designs.com/timer<br>
<br>
thanks for everyone&#x27;s great feedback on the timer!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I got this calculator from the following URL,

http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~howell/calculator/calc.html

You can either use the online versions or download the offline 
version at the bottom, which is what I did.  Using the interface 
takes a while, but also some of the calculations, like (24!)^2450 
take about 10 to 12 seconds to perform.  I&#x27;d say it takes 1-2 
minutes to calculate it since the interface takes a while to just 
put all the numbers in.

By the way, just because I&#x27;m on a roll I guess, here are the 
combinations to the other most popular cubes, the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5

4x4x4:
7 401 196 841 564 901 869 874 093 974 498 574 336 000 000 000

5x5x5:
282 870 942 277 741 856 536 180 333 107 150 328 293 127 731 985 672 
134 721 536 000 000 000 000 000

Yeah 43 quintillion doesn&#x27;t seem like such a big number after 
looking at the number of combinations to these larger cubes.  I 
can&#x27;t even begin to comprehend how large the 100x100x100 number is.  
And what weirds me out is that since these numbers are finite, you 
can easily dwarf them by infinitely many other finite numbers.

Never, only if it is required for a competion
My cubes have strong vynil stickers,they do wear on the side of the

orange stickers off and was sanding down the plastic<br>
she said the sticker edges peeling was annoying her...well for one <br>
all the colors were peeling a bit and i had no prob with it why does <br>
she care anyways i dunno its my cube and she never asked me or <br>
anything. oh wait maybe she did but im pretty sure i said no, <br>
actually im positive. then she gets a painnt pen and starts on it <br>

it barely works and just kinda sit on the plastic and drops together. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Excellent and well explained Michiel.
However I have to disagree about Jessica&#x27;s pages.  I have found these the
very best pages.  The algorithms and pictures are set out in what seems to
me a very logical way.  I have never found a lot of use for applets because
I like to print out the pictures with the algorithms and carry them around
with me.  I guess it all depends on were you are coming from and how you
learn!

I have several clocks, all of them original Matchbox. Yes, they do <br>
have these &quot;points&quot;. But they&#x27;re also glued along the whole border <br>
(just not where the wheels are ;-). And these points are <br>
no &quot;snaplocks&quot;. The main problem is to break the glue along the <br>

transparent duct tape, not glue. So now I can open it again easily.<br>

Note however that I would&#x27;ve never done this to one of my old clocks <br>

Well, they come with the cube (Rubik&#x27;s Studio), soon I will get more. 
I will sell some via my site, please note I will get only a few sets, 
most of them I want to reserve for the speedcubers that are on the 
championships 10 Juli and 7/8 August. I got them from the Rubik&#x27;s 
Studio (The firm of Mr Rubik)

<br>
I used that once and it was bad. It took about 30 minutes to apply it to the <br>
cubies and the cube became stiff again after a few days. Basically, using <br>
graphite is a time-consuming process that must be done a couple of times a <br>
week. Silicone works best since you only have to spray (taking less than 10 <br>
seconds and then letting them dry) it to a few cubes and reapply it once or <br>
twice a month.<br>

Usage (VB): Dim M As BigMath.BigInteger

          <div class="email-content">Just thought I would second that. I&#x27;ve had my cube for
a bit over a year now, and I&#x27;d say that for about 9
months of that time, it&#x27;s had nail polish on it. It&#x27;s
great! The colors are the tricky part. Nail polish
tends to look darker than most other things, so
picking &quot;tropical&quot; colors would be a good idea. That
way your eye can distinguish the colors quickly, since
they are a little bit brighter. 

Oh yeah, for some reason green is hard to find. If it
turns out to be the same for you, dont pick a &quot;bad&quot;
green, like aqua, &#x27;cause it will blend too much with
blue. Instead get purple or something completely
different.

If you&#x27;re looking for good lubricant, &quot;Castle&quot; is the
best brand...

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
One of the last records from the ol&#x27; days that still stands is Mark <br>
Waterman&#x27;s record for the cube marathon: 42 cubes in 15 minutes. <br>
Which is 21.4 seconds per cube, so an excellent record.<br>
<br>
(In Europe a marathon is 42.195 kilometers.)<br>
<br>
I would love to see a new record set for that category.<br>
Who is going to break that last &#x27;old&#x27; record?<br>
Maybe one of the weekly contests can have that event until we break <br>
it?<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Right now I am solving the centers and pairing up the edges so that I <br>
can finish solving the cube as a 3x3. What are others here doing to <br>
solve the 4x4? I would like to continue solving it as a 3x3, but <br>
about half the time one of the edges are flipped when I try to orient <br>
the top layer. I have read somewhere to &#x27;turn half the cube 90 <br>
degrees&#x27; to fix this problem, but it always takes me forever to flip <br>
the edge.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey,<br>
<br>
Just recently I bought an old cube from the the 80&#x27;s (Ideal) at Ebay. <br>
I&#x27;ve heard these make excellent speedcubes so I thought I might give <br>
it a shot. The problem is that these come in a color configuration <br>
that I&#x27;m not used to. I use white opposite blue, but the cube I&#x27;m <br>
getting has white opposite yellow. I was wondering if it is possible <br>
to resticker them by simply removing the yellow/blue stickers and <br>
switching them around? I doubt it is, but I need to ask because if it <br>
really is possible then that would be ideal (no pun intended ;)). Will <br>
gluing them back on work?<br>
<br>
I can of course resticker the entire cube like I usually do with <br>
Oddzon cubes when their stickers wear out, but the orange I have is <br>
really dark and if it&#x27;s possible for me to keep the original stickers <br>
for as long as possible then that&#x27;s great.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any tips?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yea, its as easy as just switching the colors on those 2 sides as 
long as the orientation is the same. Actually it&#x27;s even easier. Only 
8 stickers need to be removed. the b/o and y/o edges can be swapped. 
the b/r and y/r edges can be swapped. the b/y edge can be flipped, 
and the b/y/r anb b/y/o corners can be swapped. Also the center caps 
can be swapped (or it might just be easier to switch the stickers if 
you aren&#x27;t planning on removing the caps).
This leaves only the row of 3 stickers farthest away from b/y column 
to be switched and the r and o stickers on the corners you swapped.
I&#x27;ve done this a few times and never needed any additional glue. 
Hope this helps!

Be careful though so you don&#x27;t cut yourself. I recommend putting the 
center cap in question on the side of a table with the rest of the 
cube skeleton in &quot;free air&quot;, so you won&#x27;t have to hold against with 
fingers. Use a table you don&#x27;t care much for, too.

It sounds like any remaining edges after the first four F2L pairs

          <div class="email-content">Sorry about that, steps a through c were meant as a subset to step 
1. Like, I meant that the way I get the F2L pairs is by placing 
three corners, then usingthe unsolved corner as a workig corner to 
place 3 F2L edges, then line everything up, then place the last pair 
fridrich style. An alternate approach could be taken as well, just 
as simply pairing up the corners and edges like the fridrich method. 
I&#x27;ve tried both ways, and I like them both, so we&#x27;ll see what the 
times reflect. So basically, you get 3 1x1x3 columns, then place the 
centers, then one layer&#x27;s 4 edges, then Orient and Permute the last 
remaining edges. I hope that cleared things up for you!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,

I too solve the 4x4x4 with a centers first approach.  Basically, 
there is a way to avoid the two &quot;parity errors&quot; when solving however 
it takes a lot of mental calculation and is not very practical for 
speedsolving.  I&#x27;m currently trying ideas to possibly design a new 
4x4 speedsolve method around the idea of avoiding both types of edge 
parities every time.

If you solve using a centers first approach, there isn&#x27;t an easy way 
to avoid the parity errors and you just have to fix them when they 
come up.  I list some useful moves for this on my solution page, 
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-step3.html

The reason that particular situation that you are getting, where one 
edge group is flipped when solving like a 3x3x3, comes up because 
your edges are an odd number of quarter turns away from being 
perfectly solved, i.e. they have odd parity.  To change them back to 
even parity just turn any inner slice by one quarter turn.  Your 
center groups and edge groups will be messed up, however if you 
place them back together with an even number of quarter turns, i.e. 
use commutators, then you will not have an edge group flipped 
anymore.

So anyway the easy answer is to learn the algs on my solution page, 
or you can design your own algs that scramble and solve the centers 
and/or edges again in an odd number of quarter turns.

Hope this helps some,
Chris

Chris, why don&#x27;t u simply show him ur &quot;edgeflip&quot; from ur Revenge 
solution. Well anyway, here it is :

http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-step2.html (part 1.2, near the 
middle of the page)

Good luck!

-Per K

PS! If u end up with another position where u must swap 2 edges only, 
then u can rearrange those into the &quot;edgeflip&quot; and then do 
the &quot;repair moves&quot;. This means u do : A-(edgeflip)-A&#x27; (A&#x27; = inverse 
of A). This will probably mess up the facecenters, so u have to learn 
to repair those :D

Many cubers considered such a strategy. It&#x27;s becoming very hard to
find something completely new, you know ;-)

A few comments:

*) Step 1: I would start with 2x(1x1x2) (prepared during inspection).

*) Step 1: David Salvia has another way of solving 4x(1x1x2).

*) After steps 1 &amp; 2, you get 2x(1x1x3). You could think of doing it
another way:
- Step 1: 8 corners.
- Step 2: Add 4 edges -> 2x(1x1x3).
Forget centers of course.

*) Ok, 2x(1x1x3) in less than 30 moves looks good. But I&#x27;m skeptical
about how fast the rest can be (that&#x27;s why I gave up). Your 4th step
is easy, but maybe not that fast. And then, your cube looks like after
F2L+CLL. There are other possible approaches, for example U/D
orientation of the 8 edges (intuitive), and then 8-edge permutation
(requires optimised sequences and symetries).

*) Sub-25? Sure! Sub-20? Possible, but... need to be proven.
Sub-17?... I don&#x27;t think so.


Good luck,


Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, I just tried the corners first approach, and it was faster, 
i.e., 30 second average. SInce my main method is fridrich, I am 
still faster with just putting in the corner edge pairs using the 
fridrich algs, which gets me to about a 28 second average. 

I thought of this also, after I posted. My friend joey spadafora is 
creating a new method, similar to yours, Gilles, and combining this 
and that could be a ver fast method. Here would be the steps:

1. 4x(1x1x3) columns, done in one of the ways mentioned in the 
previous post

2. orient centers with M and S moves

3. place DR and DL edges, so the cube is equivalently solved to 
Gilles Roux method step 3 (2x(1x2x3) with corners solved)

4. place DF edge+orient LL edges

5. Place DB edge+permute edges

I would of course have to find these algs with ron&#x27;s cube solving 
applet, but before I do, I would first like to see someone else&#x27;s 
thoughts on this new method. Thanks!

          <div class="email-content">Hello all,<br>
<br>
I have a couple of questions about inspection time for the cube.<br>
<br>
I was curious about the times that people post in this digest and on the web.  Is there time allowed for inspection before the solve or are the times given from the moment the unsolved cube is first seen until solved?  It seems as though getting down to about 20 seconds is pretty good, but how is this measured?  I always start timing right when I see the cube and I am at about 30-35 seconds usually.<br>
<br>
My second question is on a similar note.  If you were to try to get your fastest total time and inspection time was included in your total time (i.e. inspection+solving=total) how long would you look at it before you started?  Would you start immediately and find peices as you go or find a couple to start with and go from there?<br>

          <div class="email-content">In a competition, you are allowed fifteen seconds before solving to <br>
look at the cube. The way you&#x27;re timing is referred to as no pre-<br>
inspection, and if that&#x27;s the way you normally solve then you can <br>
probably get much better times if you take the fifteen seconds <br>

          <div class="email-content">To further clarify, it is commonly accepted to allow 15 seconds of pre <br>
inspection of the cube before solving. Even if you don&#x27;t use the whole <br>
15 seconds, you won&#x27;t get any benefits on the solving time, so using <br>
the 15 seconds is well advised. <br>
<br>
So, the average times people post here are usually done as such:<br>
- Scramble<br>
- Start timer (counting down from 15 to 0)<br>
- Inspecting (NOT moving)<br>
- Timer reaches zero, gives beep, starts counting from 0<br>
- Solving<br>
- Stop timer<br>
<br>
Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer (www.rubiks.dk) does this automatically, and is <br>
really good for home-averages.<br>
<br>
I would suggest starting to time yourself with 15 seconds of <br>
preinspection, since your average times will then be more comparable <br>
to everyone elses. Once you get used to it it will cut your time by <br>
quite a few seconds.<br>
<br>
IF there was a competition where the timer would start right away, <br>
without any free preinspection, I would start turning right away, but <br>
go really slow in order to get the max move efficiency as early as <br>
possible. Going full speed at early steps like the cross or the 2x2x2 <br>
(whatever method you&#x27;re using) is not in any way recommended, <br>
especially not if you haven&#x27;t got the entire first step planned out <br>
already.<br>
<br>
Hope this was helpful,<br>

          <div class="email-content">HI NAte,<br>
<br>
   I think the usual is 15 seconds now, but I think in some of the<br>
Official USA championships in the early 80s it was 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
   I think the main record should be &quot;no inspection solves,&quot; where the<br>
entire time spent solving is counted. <br>
<br>
    An &quot;average&quot; record could then be ten cubes uncovered at once,<br>
solved in one go; with a second different average of ten from 12 cubes<br>
done at once videotaped with a visible timer, throwing out the high<br>
and low, perhaps allow for a pop. <br>
<br>
   I don&#x27;t know who will go for this. The &quot;pre-inspectiion&quot; record may<br>
soon be forever pegged with no one ever passing it except for lucky<br>
cubes. And people may stop trying. No-inspection solves leave some<br>
elbow room and people can devise more and more elegant ways to get<br>
going quickly. I think the no inspection record if done today may be<br>
around 20 seconds.<br>
<br>
   I hope that answers your quesions.<br>
<br>

    Those &quot;official&quot; colors are only in the last few years. It is the
scond &quot;official&quot; color scheme.

   In the 1980s the majority of Ideal Rubik&#x27;s cubes, the first Pocket
2x2x2 cubes, the 4x4x4 Revenge, the C*4 cube, the Deluxe cubes, and
the Game/Challenge cubes were all Blue opposite White, Yellow opposite
Green and Red opposite Orange with one corner Red Blue Green
clockwise. IIRC it was declared the offical color scheme with the C*4
cube launch.

97, averaging 22.4 seconds.

What was Mark&#x27;s exact time? Did he use some inspection time before the

          <div class="email-content">Yet another cube solution I came up with recently:<br>
<br>
Divide the cube into four equally shaped areas of five cubies each. <br>
The five top-front cubies UL, ULF, UF, UFR and UR are the first area. <br>
If you turn the cube around the x axis you have the next area at the <br>

The first part of the solution would be to bring each cubie into its <br>

you&#x27;d need 71 algorithms I think (factor 6 for EP, 1 for CP, 4 for EO, <br>
3 for CO, together 6*1*4*3-1).<br>

What do you think of it? I like the idea of treating four areas the <br>

offers mirror symmetry, not rotation symmetry (like OLL and PLL do, I <br>
hope you know what I mean).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure, but I may have invented this while thinking about a <br>
blindsolving method. Could be nice for speedsolving as well, at least <br>
once the areas can be solved independently ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">First note that it&#x27;s not the center edge that&#x27;s wrong, but the other

But try it:

There are probably shorter ways to fix this if you fix it earlier (his

I find this idea really interesting, but I think step 1 (bringing each 
piece to its goal area) would be way too time consuming, so I suggest 
another approach... Why not just do the first two &quot;areas&quot; intuitively, 
and then &quot;separate&quot; the last two (put the pieces in their respective 
goal areas), and then do the last two one by one?

I&#x27;ll be interested to hear what you find out.

          <div class="email-content">Hi.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m new to the list, so forgive me if I&#x27;m repeating<br>
some of you others.<br>
<br>
Anyways, here&#x27;s my question:<br>
Is there a standard notation than includes all the<br>
possible manipulations of the cube within the<br>
boundaries of &quot;the rules&quot;? (i.e. don&#x27;t rearrange any<br>
stickers or mirror reverse it).<br>
<br>
for example:<br>
<br>
let mP be the move that transfers FU tu UB by moving a<br>
middle slice, and mFR the &quot;move&quot; (manipulation would<br>
be better) that turns the cube so that L replace F<br>
which replaces R.<br>
<br>
this means that (mP mFR)^4 is a well known pattern.<br>
However, since there is no rules for notation of slice<br>
moves and cube turns (that I know of), it takes a<br>
while for me to describe what I mean (and not all may<br>
get it while reading the first time).<br>
<br>
I think nothing would be lost and much would be gained<br>
if a notation system was used that allowed us to<br>
describe the most common manipulations in short,<br>
unambiguous ways, but still didn&#x27;t prevent us from<br>
describing more complex maneuvers.<br>
<br>
What I had in mind is a system that was suggested in<br>
80&#x27; or &#x27;81, on the cube-lovers mailing list (using my<br>
words):<br>
<br>
Thinking only 3x3x3 for now<br>
<br>
The move R103 means: &quot;find the rightmost layer,<br>
perform one quater turn; do zero on the next layer,<br>
three on the layer following that, and zero on all<br>
other layers&quot;<br>
<br>
go on, read it again. It basically means that R103 =<br>
&quot;Antislice&quot;;<br>
<br>
Likewise, (L03 U333)^4 is the movement I was talking<br>
about before. L03 means &quot;turn centerslice<br>
couterclockwise (CCW) as seen from face L&quot;, and U333<br>
means turn top three (i.e. all) layers CCW as seen<br>
from the U face, i.e. move the whole cube so L -&gt; F -&gt;<br>
R.<br>
<br>
Also, as always x&#x27; (x apostrophe) means &quot;do x<br>
reverse&quot;, whether x is L100 or (L03 U333)^4;<br>
<br>
Pros: it can (imho) very accurately describe any cube<br>
manipulation within the rules (afaik)<br>
<br>
Cons: it&#x27;s lengthy.<br>
Consider this &quot;R100 U100 R300 U100 R100 U200 R300&quot;<br>
versus this &quot;R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;&quot;. Which is why I suggest<br>
that traling zeroes are omitted, and that single<br>
leftover 1&#x27;s are omitted too. Thus R100 = R1 = R;<br>
<br>
Extending this to 4x4x4 and 5x5x5:<br>
<br>
it&#x27;s still as useful; we can of course define f = F01<br>
or F11 - I must admit that I don&#x27;t know which it is -<br>
and likewise for the other faces. I believe that it<br>
might be especially useful for the 5x5x5, where for<br>
example F022 L022 U022 would form an interesting<br>
pattern that would be slightly longer to describe<br>
using only upper- and lowercase face names. I don&#x27;t<br>
know, since I don&#x27;t own any cubes save for a single<br>
3x3x3 bought through gamesweb.dk (thanks again, Jess).<br>
<br>
Still, the most potent strength of the notation system<br>
(IMHO) is that it, per my example of (L01 U333)^4,<br>
clearly describes what to do in a way that would take<br>
up more space using only {&quot;U&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;F&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;L&quot;,&quot;R&quot;} *<br>
{&quot;&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;&#x27;&quot;}.<br>
<br>
So, basically, is there a de facto notation system<br>
that does what I suggest here or not?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I find that system very difficult to follow, but then again I found 
the commonly accepted notation also difficult in the beginning. After 
your simplifications your system really starts looking a lot like the 
existing one except for that X&#x27; (X prime) is written as X3.

I think an &quot;official&quot; notation should be devised from already existing 
and commonly accepted norms. My suggestion is as follows:

Use F, B, R, L, U and D to denote faces as usual.
Use f, b, r, l, u and d to denote slices next to their respective 
faces.
Use M, S and E to denote middle slices on 3^3 and 5^3 cubes (cubes of 
odd degree). Consider making these lowercase too?

So that on a 3^3 cube, the slices from left to right would be L, M and 
R. On a 4^3, they would be L, l, r and R. While on a 5^3, they&#x27;d be L, 
l, M, r and R.

Use face notation coupled with rotation element to denote simple face 
turns as usual - i.e. X, X&#x27; and X^2 (or just X2).

Use letters as necessary to denote pieces and/or slots on the cube.

Use x, y and z for entire cube rotations as used by speedcubing.com.

Use Xw for &quot;double turns&quot; like Macky does on his site (nice twist I 
think). So, Rw on a 3^3 means RM&#x27;, Rw on a 4^3 or 5^3 means Rr. If you 
absolutely need &quot;triple turns&quot; perhaps consider making Xv &quot;double&quot; 
turns and Xw &quot;triple&quot; turns.

Use paranthesis to explain which moves are performed together and 
which aren&#x27;t.

This is just a suggestion for a system that is compiled out of heaps 
of standards that different people have come up with for themselves of 
course.

That&#x27;s because I suck at phrasing it right.

basically my L100=L1=L and my R003 (on a 3^3 cube) is
the same as a Singmaster/default L, and my F100=F1=F
and B003 is the ... you get the picture.

Likewise, B003&#x27; = B001 = F1&#x27; = F&#x27;

> After your simplifications your system really starts

this is, sorry for not making it clear, intentional.

guess that wasn&#x27;t clear either. I&#x27;d use primes the
same way as in &quot;default&quot;. so far L * L&#x27; = e in both
notations (this is the group theoretical * and e). 

The way 3 should be used is something like L23

> I think an &quot;official&quot; notation should be devised

I&#x27;m glad you put the word official in quotes, I forgot
that.

&lt;cut> long talk, you all know what he&#x27;s talking about.
Otherwise read his mail. It&#x27;s the notation system I
call &quot;default&quot; &lt;/cut>

> Use paranthesis to explain which moves are performed

This is to illustrate finger tricks, right? so a Sune
is (R U R&#x27;) (U R) (U2 R&#x27;) instead of just R U R&#x27; U R
U2 R&#x27;?

> This is just a suggestion for a system that is

like you said, a big mixup with no underlying
structure :p

Also note that &quot;Default&quot; is fine for 2^3 to 5^3 cubes,
it either fails or gets more &quot;clunky&quot; (the opposite of
elegant I s&#x27;pose it means) for bigger cubes, since you
need both upper, lower and inexistent medium case
letters, or just more letters with no obvious
connection to FURBLD. perhaps ETQAKC? (hint: what&#x27;s
the letter after E and T, respectively?)

Mine, on the other hand, adds more numbers that each
have a clear relation to the distance of the
corresponding slice and the selected &quot;outer&quot;/extremum
slice, based on the numbers position. I guess this has
more value for theoretical discussions than for
explaining the craft of solving the physcial puzzles,
since they are limited to 2-5.

That being said, I still think that (L02 U333)^4 in a
way looks better than (M #)*4 where # is either x, y,
z, X, Y or Z; didn&#x27;t look it up.

Also note that I use ^4 where &quot;default&quot; uses *; I
don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; but I saw it used on a
site you mention. (ALG)^4 is &quot;more correct&quot; when
looking at the cube from a group theoretical
standpoint; it means ALG * ALG * ALG * ALG; ALG, short
for algorithm, means &quot;any sequence of moves&quot;, which is
the elements of the group&#x27;s set, and * is the
composition rule (ALG1 * ALG2 means &quot;ALG1 followed by
ALG2).

&quot;Default&quot; uses (M #) * 4 which means (reaing it as
group theory notation) M * # * 4, but 4 is not an
element of the group&#x27;s set as &quot;default&quot; defines it.

Of course I know what is meant by it, just saying.

&lt;turn the silly smileys on>

So I guess if this was
GroupTheoryWithRubiksCube@..., you&#x27;d all
appreciate my rant. btw, does anyone know of a
GroupTheoryWithRubiksCube or similar group... er...
better use another word :p

Just my two bits. Well, kilobytes, really, but hey :D

Jonas

PS. my mail session timed out, so forgive me if I&#x27;m

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jonas,

   The question comes up often.

   Try this notation

U = Upper or top layer (or face)
u = middle layer or slice between U and D
D = Down or bottom layer

F = Front layer
f = middle layer or slice between F and B
B = Back layer

R = Right layer or right side
r = middle layer or slice between R and L
L = Left layer or left side

d, b and l may be used as well.

All the lower case letters are middle layers, so &quot;r&quot; is the center
slice between the &quot;R&quot; side and the &quot;L&quot; and it is turned in the same
direction as the &quot;R&quot; side.

U = top turned clockwise 90 degrees

With a single quotation mark, like
L&#x27; = Left side turned counter-clockwise 90 degrees

or with a &quot;2&quot;
U2 = top turned 180 degrees

For orienting the cube for finger tricks:

Q for cube, QU2 means rotate the cube in your hand 180 as you would
turn the Up side.

One of the benefits is the same notation is used for the 4x4x4.

As for any notation being official, there is no consensus. 

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan, and Others,

The first portion of my method:
First 2 Levels
1. Place two edge pieces, i.e. one across-the-center-of-one-side pair,
on the middle level, like RF and LF (right front and left front)
2. Place four corners on the first level, (on top)
3. Place the other two edges on the middle level, 
4. place the four edges of the first level.

Of course, there&#x27;s a lot more to it, but that&#x27;s the bare bones.

Macky tried it for a week and got it down to 15 seconds.

I tried this too, a &quot;pure&quot; layer-by-layer method:
- 1st layer
- 2nd layer in 2 steps: 2*2 edges
- 3rd layer

I computed all the sequences needed (about 25-30), don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve
still got them somewhere.
But it didn&#x27;t seem interesting compared to the usual way of solving
the F2L.

          <div class="email-content">I like the idea behind this method...very clean.<br>
<br>
Having someone solve this method, let&#x27;s assume that the final algs<br>
take 2 - 3 seconds each. If we want to get 20- then you only have   <br>
8-12 seconds to fix all the pairity and put everything in place.<br>
Recognizing where everything goes is a bit of a pain.<br>
Even solving the first 2 sections intuitively(which is the same as <br>
Cross + CEpair + CEpair + corner + corner)<br>
you still need to put everything into its section and fix pairity. <br>
That leaves you with a lot of algs to learn and perform.<br>
<br>
It does look more blindfold friendly to me, however, <br>
I believe the reason the Fridrich, CF, and &quot;normal&quot; BF methods are so<br>
popular/efficient is  that once something is taken care of, it is<br>
solved, you never have to worry about it again (except fixing<br>
blindfolded pairity).<br>
Handling all the pieces once for permutation(to fix pairity) and then<br>
again for a second permutation to solve the piece is inefficient.<br>
<br>
I can imagine this method in use though. You do what appears to be<br>
useless moves and the cube appears to still be scrambled. 4 quick algs<br>
later, it&#x27;s solved.  That would be kind of impressive.<br>
You could also show off to the public pretty easy if you set up the<br>
cube with everything in place already,  that would be an 8 - 12 second<br>
solve.<br>
Not that anybody would be that dishonest ;)<br>
<br>
TBTT Fox<br>
<br>
Just for fun,  without the internal pairities fixed,  you would have<br>
EP - 6   EO - 8   CP - 2   CO - 9 <br>
in total,  that comes out to 864 / 2 = 432 algs.<br>

I am currently practicing a few &#x27;averages of 100&#x27; everyday...and my arms/hands are rather soar sometimes...  Not enough to break something or go to the hospital, but just soar that becomes irritating....  is this too much practice?  I mean, is there a point where praticing too much will be more _bad_ than _good_, as in becoming bored/uninterested to go fast during a solve, etc.,...............  or would keeping practice time only to a few hours a day be better, to keep both the cube/your ams/hands _consistent_?<br>

I think this (a few hours per day) would be better.
I&#x27;ve recently trained myself in the use of the dvorak
keyboard layout (which I&#x27;d recommend to anyone, even
&quot;qwerty1110@yahoo&quot; :p), and I&#x27;m not gonna go in
details with that, but I heard this: practice for a
few hours every day, then cease.

Also, if trying to re-wire your brian (learn a
replacement skill instead of a &quot;fresh&quot; one), don&#x27;t use
the old skill while learning the new, it slows the
learning process.

In other words, cubing 2/7 is as good as 24/7, when it
comes to learning. But when it comes to understanding
the marvelous mysteries of life, the universe and
everything, nothing compares to cubing 24/7.

Jonas

<br>
I generally don&#x27;t mind posts that are off topic from cubing, as long <br>
as they relate to anything similar to a puzzle, or math, or other <br>
skills/hobbies that take a lot of practice as cubing does.  Such off <br>
topic posts I think are fair game to stay on this forum.<br>
<br>
There have been a lot of posts lately that are religious in nature, <br>
and I have tried to remove them when I see them.  I am not against <br>
religion, and I feel people should be free to practice whichever <br>
religion they choose, however this forum is not the place for it.  I <br>
will delete all posts that are soley religious in nature, simply <br>
because this is a forum about the cube, and topics should relate in <br>
some way to the cube and/or puzzles in general.  If you feel <br>
strongly about your religion and would like to talk with others with <br>
similar beliefs, I would suggest searching for one of Yahoo&#x27;s <br>
various religious groups, which can be found at <br>
http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/dir/Religion___Beliefs/<br>
<br>
Also, I have banned the member who made racist comments based on the <br>
deleted posts about relgion.  Racism is something that I will not <br>
tolerate at all on this group.  Anyone who makes a racist comment <br>
will be banned.<br>
<br>
Please keep the posts clean and relatively on topic for the <br>
cube/puzzles/math/other things that relate in some sense to puzzles.<br>

Hi Gilles,

   The number of moves varies with each step.

   This is my strategy for solving the 4x4x4:

1 Eight corners
2 all four &quot;middle level&quot; edge pairs
3 two opposing centers &quot;middle level&quot;
4 two FL edge pairs (on the centers)
5 the four remaining centers
6 two TL edge pairs
7 pair up the remaining edges
8 place the four remaining edge pairs

   I do the 8 corners first because my 4x4x4 has a different color
scheme from my 3x3x3s.

  Each step has freedom of movement in mind. As you go you&#x27;ll see that
some of it is similar to your 3x3x3 strategy. 

Regards,

David J

Thanks for the details Lars.
With that kind of methods, I think I was in the 150-160 range.

So, on one hand I&#x27;m glad to see there&#x27;s nothing magical about top
revengists&#x27; methods, BUT on the other hand I&#x27;m really impressed you
can be that fast with this cube! I&#x27;ve already broken 2 pieces with
mine :-)

Gilles.

PS: Got my first Square-1. I&#x27;ll try it on the beach in Britany soon.

I tried this too, a &quot;pure&quot; layer-by-layer method:
- 1st layer
- 2nd layer in 2 steps: 2*2 edges
- 3rd layer

I computed all the sequences needed (about 25-30), don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve
still got them somewhere.
But it didn&#x27;t seem interesting compared to the usual way of solving
the F2L.

          <div class="email-content">just do a single &quot;Sune&quot; (lefthand, not right). Read
the beginners section for complete information on how
to use it (not that I&#x27;m saying you are a beginner,
that&#x27;s just where the info you need is).

the moves are - specific to your picture: (R&#x27; U&#x27; R)
(U&#x27; R&#x27;) (U2 R)

This is of course step 6, orieting corners, after
you&#x27;ve permuted them. The problem is that Petrus&#x27; page
doesn&#x27;t list symmetries, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much,
since most of them is just mirroring them in your head
(position types C, D, F and G), which is easy when you
understand the underlying principle of how the
algorithms work. Allright, type E is a pain to mirror,
since the axis is diagonal.

If you want to lears the algs for step(6+7), note that
Lars uses the counterintuitive opposite permutation
notation, showing where the pieces are as opposed to
how they move when doing the alg in question. If this
is unclear, solve the cube, then do a D4 in reverse.
Compare your cube to the D4 picture.

Also, I suggest you read step 7, and look close at the
cube where he demonstrates one Allan (permute 3 edges)
done by using 2 Sune. Note that for the supercube
(centers have orientations), these aren&#x27;t identical
(use one * undo that with the other = 180 twist of a
centre).

Also, I&#x27;d suggest doing the sune from different
wholecube orientations and viewing angles, since the
simple solutions use almost only sune, antisune, rune
and bruno, which are all very similar in the way at
least I think &#x27;em.

oh, and by the way, I think you meant you want to
either improve or decrease your time (which actually
is the same here). Working on increasing your time is
the silly stuff I do :D

          <div class="email-content">Your best bet would be to check www.mefferts.com .  They offer a 6

check http://www.puzzle-shop.de/start-shop.html  though I&#x27;ve never

Both of those are me and I&#x27;m quite proud of the piratey megaminx 
solve!

I have a rather large collection of solution vids, Gilles vids, and 
various cube related video captures as well, I&#x27;ll have to sort them 
out sometime.

          <div class="email-content">Here are my numbers in the same format as Lars did his.  I also use 
a centers first approach, so my steps are the same.

I counted in the following metric:
1) inner slice moves turned with its adjacent outer layer is countd 
as one move (D d), (U u) etc.
2) turning an inner slice by first turning the double layer, then 
undoing the outer move counts as 2 moves (D d) D&#x27; = d counts as 2 
moves
3) turning an inner layer by itself using my finger to turn it 
counts as 1 move
4) All outer layer turns (and inner layer turns) are counted as in 
HTM

Solve centers: 29, 30, 29, 30, 27, 29, 28, 25, 32, 27 => 28.6
Pair up edges: 31, 43, 36, 40, 40, 48, 43, 41, 52, 44 => 41.8
Solve as a 3x3x3: 63, 68o, 81op, 73o, 49, 85op, 53p, 66p, 54, 73op 
=> 66.5

p = permutation parity error (two edges are swapped)
o = orientation parity error (one edge is flipped)

Total counts are: 123, 141, 146, 143, 116, 162, 124, 132, 138, 144 
=> 136.9

Again these numbers are in the metric as defined above.  All the 
improvements I make to my method try to minimize the number of moves 
in the move metric as defined above.

Also, my average average is about 1:20-1:21, so I do about 1.69-1.75 
moves/sec on average.

Hope this helps,
Chris

I like your metric Chris, because it&#x27;s more about effective speed (if
I use it for my poor method, I think I&#x27;m close to 200 moves).
I guess you almost don&#x27;t use slice moves, except for parity fixing and
a few other things, and that&#x27;s what makes this method really interesting.

Gilles.

PS: There&#x27;s something I definitely don&#x27;t like about fixing the
edge-center parity at the end, don&#x27;t know why ;-)

          <div class="email-content">The working corner is pretty nice.  One of my friends, Mark Sullivan, <br>
came up with a &quot;working edge&quot; method.  It works quite nicely as well.<br>
<br>
As for memorizing algorithms, the main thing of course is practice.  <br>
For me, I memorize an algorithm by how it feels.  If you&#x27;ve ever played <br>
music, a pianist knows exactly what a chord feels like or how a passage <br>
goes or what arpeggio goes where and how the fingers have to be placed <br>
here and there.  Basically, for me, I memorize not the moves but the <br>
muscle movements.  I have to do the algorithm enough so that the <br>
muscles are trained to do the sequence.  I believe this is the fastest <br>
way to go... the algorithms need to be memorized into the <br>
subconscious... so you see the pattern, you react, and your fingers <br>
move, and you don&#x27;t think about anything.<br>
<br>
Of course, this may be very demanding.  That&#x27;s basically how I do it.  <br>
Otherwise, really... in order to memorize algorithms, you just have to <br>
practice.  One of my friends, Leyan Lo, keeps trying to convince me <br>
than an intuitive idea of the algorithm, knowing what it does and how <br>
it moves the pieces around is the way to go.  Though this may make <br>
memorization easier, I am convinced that taking time to think about <br>
things will take away from your cubing speed.<br>
<br>
Of course, this doesn&#x27;t mean that when I do an algorithm, I don&#x27;t know <br>
what it does.  I&#x27;ve done the algorithm enough so that I know if I do <br>
this and there&#x27;s an edge in there I want, I know where it will be <br>
ejected to and in what orientation and so I can be prepared.<br>
<br>
Um... I&#x27;m probably writing more than I need to but I really don&#x27;t want <br>
to do these prelabs.  I guess this isn&#x27;t helping.  Anyway, for <br>
recognizing things, of course, it depends on your system.  I am not <br>
familiar with Mark Jeays&#x27; system.  I just glanced at the website (and <br>
it&#x27;s Jeays and not Jaeys) and it seems like most of the solution deals <br>
with very easy to recognize cases.  I mean, when making a cross on the <br>
bottom, all you have to see is how many yellow edge pieces are in the <br>
right place (or whatever color you use) and that should be sufficient.  <br>
I guess it might help if I explain how to recognize the situations for <br>
the Fridrich?<br>
<br>
The most common thing people ask about is how to recognize PLL <br>
situations.  Dan Harris I think had a nice thing on his website.  What <br>
I do... is most of the time, I look for a block.  If I see that a <br>
corner and an edge shares a color, I match up that block to its face <br>
and then, it&#x27;s quite clear which one is which.  I&#x27;d be happy to tell <br>
you each and every situation... though it might be more useful when you <br>
learn a method such as Fridrich.<br>
<br>
OLL... because of the nature of the orientations, these should be <br>
pretty easy to recognize.  If you&#x27;re looking for cases, just see the <br>
case, and then look for the distinguishing mark.  All right, it&#x27;s time <br>
I go do work now.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi<br>
<br>
I use Dan Knights&#x27; Intermediate Method.<br>
<br>
Dan Knights has three methods posted on his site, but they only differ <br>
by the LL.  In fact, all he has posted are his LL systems.  They are all <br>
fast though, and the Intermediate method + a (intuitively-learned) <br>
Fridrich F2L is good enough for me to average a little over 28 seconds.<br>
<br>
However, My Fridrich F2L is not as fast as many other people&#x27;s, and if <br>
you do a working corner method + Knights&#x27; 4-look LL you should be pretty <br>
fast.  I know of one person at least that does a working corner method <br>
instead of a Fridrich F2L and continually kicks my ass =)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi.

I just wanna give my two bits on the F2L. I use
Petrus, and I like to challenge the accepted norm to
realize why it&#x27;s better or worse than what I suggest.

So here&#x27;s my thought of the day: The only difference
between Fridrich F2L and Petrus F2L is that you (with
Petrus) assemble the cross on the fly (well, you
orient edges too, but you can skip it if you want);
this means that the Petrus method has a higher degree
of freedom vs. Fridrich; higher degree of freedom,
when used right, leads to fewer moves on average,
which leads to lower times. Therefore, Petrus F2L is
superior to Fridrich F2L. I also have a gut feel that
it&#x27;s superior to working corner, but I won&#x27;t claim
it... yet :p

so, the challenge for everyone who accepts it is:
prove me wrong. Or argue that I&#x27;m wrong in a very
convincing way.

On a sidenote: the order of Knights 4-look LL
(thirteen algs) is the same as Petrus LL (three algs);

          <div class="email-content">well, that and the irrefutable fact that dexterity,
alg recognition (or subcase recognition), and the
ability to look ahead and keep track of n pieces also
plays a role in the creation of your f2l leads me to
believe that superiority is a little more dubious in
terms of its determination. 

inefficient use of turns in achieving goals is
possible with both methods. short sightedness is as
well.

Its one thing to say that a method is inefficient on
average, but thats using ceteris paribus, (the all
things equal assumption) i.e. you are assuming that
there is an ideal speedcuber that given a full
understanding and extensive practice of both methods
would, on average, finish with petrus faster than
fridrich.

Its a whole different thing to assume this kind of
situation would be reflected among the rest of us (the
non perfect cubers).

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have an informal challenge for anyone who enjoys solving their <br>
4x4x4.  I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot lately about how to avoid the edge <br>
parity errors on the 4x4x4 while speed solving.<br>
<br>
I have found a new solving method that avoids both parities every <br>
time, however it takes a lot of mental calculation and is, right <br>
now, not ready to be used as a speed solve method.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve detailed my method at the bottom of this message for anyone who <br>
is interested.<br>
<br>
My challenge to the 4x4x4 enthusiasts is to find an algorithm <br>
(meaned in the mathematical sense, so a series of possibly several <br>
steps) that is 1) efficient and FAST, 2) always avoids both parity <br>
errors, and 3) solves the cube :)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m currently trying to design a new speed solve method around this <br>
idea, and I have come up with a few new ideas, but none of them are <br>
faster than just correcting the parities when they come up on my <br>
normal speed solve method.<br>
<br>
The amount of time that people have put into the 3x3x3 methods is <br>
amazing, and we need to do the same for the 4x4x4.  Solving the <br>
4x4x4 with a method that does not have an algorithm in place for <br>
avoiding both parities is like solving the 3x3x3 with an inefficient <br>
layer-by-layer method.<br>
<br>
My challenge is for us to create a 4x4x4 revenge method (or even <br>
several!) that are as efficient for the 4x4x4 as Petrus, Fridrich, <br>
Waterman&#x27;s methods are for the 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
Right now there are no readily available programs that analyze 4x4x4 <br>
positions, and not a lot of people are doing the 4x4x4 compared to <br>
the 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
Maybe I&#x27;m missing the mark here, but in trying to come up with this <br>
new method, I feel a little like the original 3x3x3 solvers trying <br>
to come up with an efficient method for the 3x3x3 for the very first <br>
time.<br>
<br>
Anyway I hope some others are up to the challenge as well.  If I <br>
come up with any interesting ideas for a speed solve method that can <br>
implement the strategies of some of my method below I&#x27;ll post it to <br>
this group.  I hope others will do the same too, and we can try to <br>
come up with a new speed solve method for the 4x4x4 that will be <br>
just as efficient as the methods are for the 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
Hope to hear from some others who are interested,<br>
Chris<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
My always avoid both parity errors 4x4x4 method:<br>
<br>
I am biased towards a centers first approach so the method follows <br>
centers first.  However, I have outlined with asterisks what exactly <br>
needs to be done on the cube to avoid the parities, so that people <br>
who use other methods can adapt this strategy to their methods as <br>
well.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Solve 2 opposite centers<br>
<br>
2) Count the cycles in the edge orbit, exactly like I was going to <br>
memorize them for a blindfolded solve, however don&#x27;t memorize the <br>
piece positions just the number of edge pieces in each cycle.  Say <br>
you have one cycle of length 16, two of length 3, and 2 pieces are <br>
in their correct locations.<br>
<br>
You have two odd cyles (the ones of length 3) which can be solved <br>
individually using commutators.  **All odd cycles can individually <br>
reduce to solved**.  You also have 1 even cycle (the one of length <br>
16).  **Even cycles individually cannot be reduced down to <br>
solved**.  Since you don&#x27;t have an even number of even cycles (2 <br>
even cycles can be reduced to solved) then the parity of the edge <br>
orbit is odd.<br>
<br>
*******************<br>
Odd parity in the edge orbit = Orientation parity error (one edge <br>
group will be flipped in the LL)<br>
*******************<br>
<br>
3) Now I solve the remaining 4 centers, but I count the number of <br>
moves it takes me to do it.  You HAVE to solve the remaining centers <br>
in an odd number of inner slice moves to correct the orientation <br>
parity error.  It takes some thinking to do this, but it can always <br>
be done.  By solving the centers in an odd number of inner slice <br>
moves you will change the edge orbit&#x27;s parity back to even, and thus <br>
you&#x27;ve eliminated the orientation parity error.<br>
<br>
If the edge orbit was originally even after solving the first two <br>
centers, then you have to solve the last 4 in an EVEN number of <br>
inner slice moves.  Either way, you have to solve all 6 centers and <br>
end up with the edge oribt having even parity.<br>
<br>
4) Solve all the edge groups but 2.<br>
<br>
5) Now count the cycles of the edge groups, just like you would on a <br>
3x3x3 cube.  When you get to your unsolved edge groups, pretend that <br>
one of the two pieces is the color of the entire edge group and keep <br>
counting.  If the cycle uses both edge groups, remember to switch <br>
colors on the second one.  Using the same principle of even and odd <br>
cycles, decide if the 4x4x4 viewed as a 3x3x3 edge orbit is even or <br>
odd.<br>
<br>
6) Count the cycles in the corners (only the positions matter), <br>
decided if it is even or odd<br>
<br>
7) If the parity of the edge orbit matches the corner orbit, then <br>
the decision you made back when you choose the color of the unsolved <br>
edge group was correct.  Solve the last two edge groups the way you <br>
found by counting cycles.  If the parity of the corners does not <br>
match the parity of the edges, then you decided incorrectly back <br>
when counting the 4x4x4 as a 3x3x3 edge group cycles.  Just solve <br>
them the other way.<br>
<br>
********************<br>
Matching the parity of the 4x4x4 viewed as a 3x3x3 edge orbit and <br>
the parity of the corner orbit =  avoid the edge positioning parity <br>
error<br>
********************<br>
<br>
8) Solve your cube as a 3x3x3.  You are guaranteed to never run into <br>
the parity error, so go absolutely full speed :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Right after I posted this I came up with an idea for a new 
speedsolve method.

1) Use the 15 second inspection time solely to count the cycles in 
the edge group.  You will have to practice this by itself a lot, and 
have various memory shortcuts to memorize which pieces haven&#x27;t been 
counted yet after counting a long cycle.  It is hard to fund which 
piece haven&#x27;t been counted after finding a cycle of length 19 or so.

2) Now solve the centers full speed but count in your head (even, 
odd, even, odd, even, odd) for the parity of the edge orbit after 
each inner slice quarter turn.

Make sure when you solve the centers, for that last move that the 
edge orbit is even.

This will always avoid the orientation parity.

What do you guys think?  I think it would be possible with a lot of 
practice to determine the edge oribt&#x27;s parity on a scrambled cube 
within 15 seconds.  Also with practice I think you could track the 
parity of the edges throughout the solving of the centers while 
still going full speed, and finish the centers on a &quot;even&quot; turn.

I am going to start practicing this in my solving and see if is 
managable and if it is faster than the current 4x4x4 methods.

I&#x27;ll post again once I&#x27;ve tried practiced the method several times.  
I&#x27;m excited as this seems like a reasonable amount of mental 
calculation, I hope it works!

Hope to hear from some others about new 4x4x4 methods as well,
Chris

Petrus user (a petruser? /usr/ptrs? :p yeah I&#x27;m a
geek).

Also, my Tip of the Moment right now:

whenever you need to learn an algorithm (whether for
Petrus simple or Petrus Advanced), try repeating it
from solved till you reach solved again. Also try the
same thing in reverse, and try it mirrored. This is
especially useful for learning step(6+7): case C and D
- they are very similar.

Try repeating both &quot;Sune&quot; and &quot;Sune U2&quot;. Can you
explain to yoursely why the cycles length differs?

just some suggested excercises.

a question too: are you learning the step(5+6) algs?
is it worth it if you use (6+7) too?

yeah, that&#x27;s pretty much what I was thinking. I mean,
if we pick systems based only on numers, we will pick
the one with the best number (fewest -weighed- avg.
moves), right?

this is where &quot;style&quot; enters the scene - so far we
could program computers to perform the above mentioned
tasks and then compare results. I&#x27;ll mail you then
program when I do it for a school project :p

... conclusion: I don&#x27;t feel &quot;proven wrong&quot;, but point
is certainly taken.

Assuming each method is rigidly followed*, let&#x27;s
see...

Petrus: 8 starting corners x 3 next corners x 4 next
corners x 1 finish corner = 12*8 = 96 orders.

Fridrich: 6 starting faces x 4 next pairs x 3 next
pairs x 2 next pairs x 1 finish pair = 12*12 = 144
orders.

Guess you&#x27;re right. Then again, look at each system
when a 2x2 block is done (assume around DBL); in
Fridrich this is cross + one pair:

Petrus has 3 free layers (U R F), Fririch has one free
layer (U) plus two semifree layers (R F). I say that
leaves more freedom for Petrus.

It feels more free to me, anyways. summed up: guess
Fridrich has more freedom as to what (144 routes),
Petrus has more as to how (3 layers).

&lt;snip>

> > jake
I hear you, Jake

*Assuming each method is rigidly followed: this is a
blatantly false assumption, but it gives us a base of
comparison.

Also note that I&#x27;m a more &quot;theoretic&quot; cuber, whereas I
see this forum is primarily concerned with the practic
appliance - not that those two can&#x27;t go hand in hand.

Next up: I&#x27;m gonna devise a method based on forming
corner-edge pairs and simply putting them next to each
other instead of a fixed structure... :D

Well, a program is taking shape in my mind; it allows
the user to define states to be reached on the way to
a solution, calculating god&#x27;s number, weighed avgs.
and algorithms used to travel from state to state
(ending in the solved of course). Cube Explorer uses a
variant of an algorithm that reduces the moves allowed
to &lt;U,D,R,L,F2,B2> then &lt;U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2> then
&lt;U2,D2,R2,L2,F2,B2> then &lt;IDENTITY> (Isn&#x27;t that
Thistlewaite? can&#x27;t remember). Sorta&#x27; like the same
thing, only with many more parameters to choose from.
Like saying &quot;next step: all pieces that belong in
upper layer is in the upper layer&quot;, that kind of
thing. as a base, use the 4x4x4 since it can be
reduced to both the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3. I think... It
will be a college project of mine, I think.

like it&#x27;s been said on cubelovers: you can only solve
a puzzle for the first time ONCE. I&#x27;d like to do that
without getting exposed to spoilers (I&#x27;ll control this
myself). But once I&#x27;ve done that, I&#x27;d be happy to
join. Well, with the time it&#x27;s gonna take me, I guess
I&#x27;ll just check back in a few years to hear what
everyone else thinks.

I have a collection of about 34 cuber videos (single
solve 3x3x3).

I have:
Masayuki Akimoto
Jessica Fridrich
Katsuyuki Konishi
Jess Bonde
Lars Petrus
Shotaro Makisumi
Jon Morris
Brent Morgan
Lars V. (how to spell that?)
Ron Van Bruchem
Wiktoria Zborowska
Doug Li
Chris Szlatenyi
Dan Henage
Mr Kondo
Kyle Bryant

if you have a video of a single solve 3x3x3 and aren&#x27;t
on this list, please send me a link or something to
it. Im collecting videos so that maybe someday we can
make something out of them all...or maybe just so I
can compete with them as I improve, who knows what
will become of this collection, Im trying to make it
grow nonetheless.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   I&#x27;ve reduced my 73 move parity fix to 56 moves. If I don&#x27;t need to
consider correcting centers, like in a centers-last strategy, it drops
to 30 moves. Could you reduce the number of moves from your 15
movement parity fix if you didn&#x27;t need to consider the centers? This
might be a whole lot simpler than figuring out which way to go in the
15 second inspection.

&gt; a question too: are you learning the step(5+6) algs?<br>
&gt; is it worth it if you use (6+7) too?<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
Although 2 steps can be combined using a multitude ammount of <br>
algorithms, mine is decomposed into the most recents popular way of <br>
doing the LL.<br>
<br>
Orient all/Permutate all, which could be seen as <br>
<br>
Step 6 + Step (5-7)<br>
<br>
You do save about 10 moves, the algorithms are not hard to learn <br>
since most of them have already been optimized for hand dexterity.<br>

I still firmly believe its all about the F2L. The LL has different <br>
ways of being done and I think the difference is in subseconds.<br>

          <div class="email-content">What would be interesting is to show different methods/styles. If you <br>
ask me, I think its boring to see the exact same solves over and over <br>

Method. I dont blame it for being so popular and effective, but I can <br>

have to watch it slowly a bit just to find out which method he&#x27;s <br>

Mostly when I watch the vids now I just go for the finger dexterity <br>

What would be cool is to see the cube being solved at full speed, and <br>

the slow part that&#x27;s ok, but I believe human knowledge belongs to the <br>

          <div class="email-content">Just from personal experience I would recommend against his intermediate
method.  Instead, go with the advanced, a three look last layer.  While
learning, you can do it as a four look, and you already know 7 of the PLL
algorithms.  So I would do this

 

Orient    edges

Orient    corners

Permute edges

Permute corners

 

The last two steps can be switched.  And this way, you are on your way to
learning PLL.  An on an aside about learning the PLL, he says to use Jessica
Fridrich&#x27;s page for it.  Personally I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a good page to
learn from.  I would find a page with inverses, symmetries and finger
tricks.  There are plenty of pages out there with that, so go ahead and take
your pick.

 

Hope that helps

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Any one used Dan Knights Intermediate
Method?

 

Hi.

I just wanna give my two bits on the F2L. I use
Petrus, and I like to challenge the accepted norm to
realize why it&#x27;s better or worse than what I suggest.

So here&#x27;s my thought of the day: The only difference
between Fridrich F2L and Petrus F2L is that you (with
Petrus) assemble the cross on the fly (well, you
orient edges too, but you can skip it if you want);
this means that the Petrus method has a higher degree
of freedom vs. Fridrich; higher degree of freedom,
when used right, leads to fewer moves on average,
which leads to lower times. Therefore, Petrus F2L is
superior to Fridrich F2L. I also have a gut feel that
it&#x27;s superior to working corner, but I won&#x27;t claim
it... yet :p

so, the challenge for everyone who accepts it is:
prove me wrong. Or argue that I&#x27;m wrong in a very
convincing way.

On a sidenote: the order of Knights 4-look LL
(thirteen algs) is the same as Petrus LL (three algs);

          <div class="email-content">True, but maybe we can get videos of people solving at the 
championship?  Either championship solves or we could have a booth w/ a 
camera set up where you can walk up and write down your info, inroduce 
yourself to the camera, and then record yourself solving the cube, etc.  
I don&#x27;t know, just some ideas.

If there are TV crews there from ESPN, The Game Show Network, etc, we 
can probably get footage from them (high quality!!!) to go on the DVD.

          <div class="email-content">I would like to propose the 4x4x4 metric that I listed as one metric 
that can be used for the 4x4x4.  I use it because, like Gilles said, 
it counts the effective number of moves that you do when actually 
solving.

I included the &quot;turning an inner slice along with your finger&quot; as 
one move because effectively it is, however I don&#x27;t use them.

For the normal 4x4x4 I don&#x27;t ever turn an inner slice by itself, it 
is actually faster for me to do the 2 move double layer then undo 
the outer layer.  So if the situation required me to turn d only I 
would do (D d) D&#x27; = d

For the 4x4x4 supercube, my two edge swapped parity fix alg has 4 
single inner face turns like that, however that is the only instance 
when I use them.

I still like counting them as one move as it makes the metric 
complete, even though personally I don&#x27;t turn single inner slices 
along in my solving for the normal 4x4x4 cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

My gut feeling is that it&#x27;s futile to try come up with an algorithm 
that eliminates the parity problems early on. Cause it will indeed 
require lots of mental calculation. And those calculations can 
probably only be done fast only by a few people. Most ppl will adopt 
a method well described in a &quot;table-lookup&quot; manner. 

There are 2 &quot;parity errors&quot; errors in the last &quot;solve as 3x3x3&quot; step 
when u follow the edge-pairing way of solving 4x4x4 cube. These are 
sometimes jokingly called parodies! :-P In fact it&#x27;s only the 
famous &quot;edge-flip&quot; which can be called a parity error. the 2-edge 
swap can neatly be done by 2 simple 3-cycles, cycles on singular 
edges when seen as a proper 4x4x4. So it is clearly seen that this is 
not a parity error at all. 

What is needed is to reduce those 2 &quot;parities&quot; to only one, when both 
of them occur. So if anyone comes uf with a nice solution to this 
which is not facecenter destructive it would be very productive. Such 
an alg might possibly be found by a &quot;4x4x4 cube explorer&quot; ;-)

Happy 4x4x4-cubing :-)

          <div class="email-content">You know that tha algs (R2&#x27; U)(R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U R&#x27;) and (R2 U&#x27;)<br>
(R&#x27; U&#x27; R U)(R U)(R U&#x27; R) move three edge cubies around on the last <br>

and vice versa.  So, assuming &quot;(R2&#x27; U)(R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U R&#x27;)&quot; = <br>
variable X, and &quot;(R2 U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U&#x27; R U)(R U)(R U&#x27; R)&quot; = variable Y, you <br>

X=4*X<br>
-3*X=0<br>

Now, knowing variable X=0, we can solve for variable Y<br>
<br>
2*0=Y<br>
Y=0<br>
<br>
So, &quot;(R2 U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U&#x27; R U)(R U)(R U&#x27; R)&quot; is also equal to zero!<br>

I think you should re-check your algebra and your &quot;givens&quot;, i.e. X=2Y and Y=2X (which in itself shows that X and Y are probably either 0 or approach +/- inf), unless I totally misunderstood what you were trying to say.<br>

I checked with my Algebra 2 teacher, and this is what she said.
____________
Hi, Austin!  You&#x27;re right.  Doug divided by a variable - - you&#x27;re 
never
supposed to divide by 0, and since we don&#x27;t know what x is yet (and x
could potentially be 0), dividing by x is dangerous.  The rule of 
thumb
is to never divide by a variable when solving an equation.

Rock on!
Josea  

-----------------

However, Richard said that since I was doing the alg two times, I 
should have done X times X instead of 2 times X.  I&#x27;m not sure what 
the correct answer is.

Yea.

Not only that, but I believe that even if you rewrote it as this:

X=2Y
Y=X/2

then those are really the same equations, just shuffled around a bit.  
I&#x27;m not 100% sure on this, but I think if you take any two-variable 
equation that is equal to one variable (X=2Y), and then solve for the 
other variable (Y=X/2) and use it to plug in to the original, you will 
get pretty strange stuff.  For instance:

X=(2/3)Y+3
Y=(3(X-3))/2

subtituting the 2nd equation in for all Y in the first equation gives us 
this:

X=(2/3)(3/2)(X-3)+3

so, we know that... (2/3)(3/2)=1
and... X-3+3=X

so basically all that proves is that X=X. 

For substituting variables like that, or for composite functions, from 
what I know you need two totally different equations.

As for the division by 0, your teacher is right.  I should&#x27;ve said for 
all X != 0, which limits the domain, but I didn&#x27;t know how to type the = 
with a / through it, which is the more traditional way to write &quot;is not 
equal to&quot;.  The one I just used ( != ) is more common among computer 
geeks such as myself.

In a few years when you take Calculus, you will learn limits, which open 
up a whole new &#x27;gray&#x27; area of math to you.  With limits, you can solve 
an equation as x approaches n (lim x->n) and get an approximation for 
what X would be if it reached that number n.  Sometimes this is 
necessary, especially if you have a fraction with a variable(s) in the 
denominator, which you cannot brush off because they violate the &quot;rule 
of thumb&quot;.  But that is a different subject for a different email.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Kyle and others. If the DVD is just a compilation of 3x3 
speedcubing videos collected from the net, I don&#x27;t see the point. I 
could just go to the video list at rubiks.dk and download the same 
stuff for free and even burn it to a DVD if I want. If the DVD 
includes other types of solving (one handed etc), different puzzles, 
and tournament footagen and is edited well, I might consider buying 
it. There is certainly room for a lot on a DVD. You could even 
include footage from the original World Championship.
What level of editing will be done? Everyone does there videos 
differently (w/ the music and credits etc). I&#x27;d recommend getting as 
much *uncompressed* raw video from everyone and unifying it more. 
For example you could have a timer in the corner, put many solves to 
one song, and do up the credits in the same style/font. I&#x27;d offer to 
help but don&#x27;t have much experience in video editing. Anyway, I hope 
it turns out good!

          <div class="email-content">Guys what are you doing.  You seem to be taking sequences or moves on a
Rubik&#x27;s cube and adding numbers to them and all sorts of weird stuff.  Talk
about apples and oranges!

Fundamentally in the first e-mail you got that X = 4*X and concluded that X
= 0.  True for numbers for not for lots and lots of other groups.

You could just about conclude that 3*X = 0.  Which is true as X is a
3-cycle.

Probably safest to say don&#x27;t worry about the algebra if you haven&#x27;t done any
advanced maths, or read up on group theory!

a free DVD, all of my work on it will not be for

distribution.

The DVD is not simply 3x3 single solves, however,
since in competition single solve 3x3 is the backbone,
it is a priority that video submissions include at
least one single solve 3x3. The call for videos and
subsequent idea of mine to have a dvd exemplifying the
solving methods, techniques, and skill of the cubing
community is not just a simple compilation, other
ideas submitted to me have given me the extra concepts
of using editing to slow down videos. adding
explanations and continue searching for different
types of puzzle solves (so far I have Pyra, Mega,
3x3x5, 2x2x2, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5).
And ideas are still being accepted, I am nowhere near
preproduction. This is still all conceptual. If anyone
has ideas on how we can use this to make money for
future competitions (i.e. reconciling copyright
issues), please tell me.

          <div class="email-content">If you guys are interested in using numbers to simulate how the 3 
cycle on the edges works, then you can, but you can&#x27;t just add them 
as variables X and Y in the real numbers (what happen when x = e or 
y = e^(19!/17)?

The permutation of performing a 3 cycle on 3 edges will be 
equivalent to the identity permutation if you do it 3 times.  So if 
you have some 3 cycle permutation, call it X, then doing X^3 gives 
you the identity, it&#x27;s as if you never did anything in the first 
place.

This is the exact same thing as adding the integers 0,1, and 2 taken 
(mod 3).  Let 0 correspond to the solved state, 1 to the state after 
doing one 3 cycle, 2 to the state after doing two of the same 3 
cycle.

Now define the variable A to be an element of the natural numbers.  
You know the state the cube would be in after doing your 3 cycle A 
times would be the same as A mod 3 where A is the number of times 
you do the 3 cycle.

If you add in the inverse 3 cycle, you called it Y, then you can 
find an expression for the state of the cube after doing any number 
of both permutations.

X and Y are commutative beacuse X is the inverse of Y and vice versa 
(i.e. X composed with Y = Y composed with X)

so say you do XYXXYYXXYYXYXYXYXYXYXXXY

Count the number of times you see X and the number of times you see 
Y.  Say you see X a times and Y b times.  Then the state of the cube 
is

(a-b) mod 3

So above there are 13 X&#x27;s and 11 Y&#x27;s so after doing your permutation 
X and Y like that string above, the cube would be in position (13-
11) mod 3 = 2

So the cube would look exactly like I had only done the Y 
permutation on a solved cube (or also 2 of the X permutations done 
in a row on a solved cube).

In general (a-b) mod 3 will come out to be either 0, 1, or 2, and 
you can just use the coorespondence of numbers to cube states 
mentioned above to see what the state the cube will be in.

You can&#x27;t use our normal Real numbers system because you&#x27;re dealing 
with permutations instead of numbers.

The algebra should work out though if you work with the integers 0, 
1, and 2 taken (mod 3).  The X permutation (your first three cycle) 
would correspond to the number 1 and your Y permutation would 
coorespond to the number 2.

Try it that way, and remember to take everything (mod 3) and it 
should work without getting stuff like 1=4 and things like that :)

Even so, this is quite misleading. It&#x27;s far better to write X*X*X=1 
or X^3=1. 3*X=0 would be the sort of notation used in an Abelian 
group and even if we restrict ourselves to &lt;X>, we&#x27;d still probably 
at some level be thinking of it as a subgroup of the usual cube group 
which is very much non-Abelian (and so would use multiplicative 
rather than additive notation and use 1 (or perhaps e) as a symbol 
for the identity rather that 0). It&#x27;s really only OK to write 3*X=0 
if you&#x27;re talking about an Abelian subgroup containing &lt;X> but even 
then, you&#x27;d write 3X=0, as a shorthand for X+X+X=0 and wouldn&#x27;t use 
the * sign (unless of course you were perhaps thinking of looking at 
it from the point of a Z-module - and then you&#x27;d not be looking to 
divide by 3 because 1/3 isn&#x27;t in Z).

All the talk in the thread about dividing by X or by 3 is really 
quite meaningless in the context of the cube group. Well, dividing by 
X isn&#x27;t but we&#x27;d have to write X*X=X^(-1) (or if we really did want 
to work in &lt;X> and use additive notation we&#x27;d have to subtract rather 
than divide and get 2X=-X. In that case, there&#x27;d be no multiplicative 
operation anyway, since we&#x27;re not dealing with a ring structure, so 
it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to divide by 3 or by X or even to discuss 
division at all.)

in 2 weeks so I have a huge finals crunch after that but once school 
gets out, I guarantee I will have a good comprehensive set of official 
rules up.  These rules will be implemented at the US Championships and 
you can find them at http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tmao/  The rules will 
also be revised once the new timer is adopted.

Nice post from chris too.

I don&#x27;t think people struggling with this sort of thing are going to learn
it in this forum though so I still say to those interested - go and read
some easy books on group theory!

This idea started when Jess&#x27;s record for 2000 cubes in 24 hours was 
rejected from Guinness, along with his 16.5 something record. We were 
talking about just having our own record list, completely ignoring 
Guinness. So whoever writest the rules should set the standards for 
official record breaking.

          <div class="email-content">Im thinking of a multipurposed organization. one that
would set rules, standards for the verification of
videos, appropriating funds (and generating them) for
regular tournaments, tournament structure (regionals,
nationals, worlds, rules) and things like that.  I
think it is imperative that the action Begin with us,
the members of the speedcubing community. Also, its
important that we make up a decent portion of the
executive board of the actual organization (with
representation from distributors and such). If
anything, it should be something we are all thinking
about, because it would most definitely take the
community into a positive, more unified direction.

          <div class="email-content">I started a thread on this a few weeks ago which culminated in Tyson&#x27;s offer
to get things started at the US championships I think.
I have very similar thoughts Kyle, it must be inclusive and it must set
rules and standards that if not agreed by consensus at least have a large
majority agreeing with them.  I think someone pointed out before how
important it would be to have representatives from different countries too.

          <div class="email-content">I have a couple of videos but no idea how to get them to you.  I don&#x27;t have
a website that I can put videos on and they are too big to be accepted by
the yahoogroup on a post.  Do you want them?  and if so what&#x27;s the best way
to do this?

They are both onehanded.  The first is about 46 seconds but the last few
turns on the last move (a 3-cycle of edges) didnt get filmed because the
memory stick on the camera filled.  The second is much slower - about 56
seconds but at least its all there!

The method is my own variation on Fridrich as described is some other posts.

          <div class="email-content">I think the main benefits of this organization will
not only be a unification of cubers worldwide, but of
a genuine sense of focus, and perhaps not everything
will fall on two people&#x27;s backs regarding
planning...Rigid rules concerning the hierarchy of
tournaments will bring credibility and acclaim to the
sport, and leaving the option open for unsanctioned
side tourneys is a must to preserve the rather
freeform nature of the community that makes it so
appealing. 
Im game for anything.

&gt;  planning...Rigid rules concerning the hierarchy of<br>
&gt;  tournaments will bring credibility and acclaim to the<br>

This idea started when Jess&#x27;s record for 2000 cubes in 24 hours was 
rejected from Guinness, along with his 16.5 something record. We were 
talking about just having our own record list, completely ignoring 
Guinness. So whoever writest the rules should set the standards for 
official record breaking.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everyone,<br>
<br>
So I started speedcubing again after a 2 months hiatus in which my cube <br>
time was spent working on the US tournament (which everyone should come <br>
to) and the World Rubik&#x27;s Cube Association.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve broken my old <br>
records.  My best StackMat average is 23.58 in which the range of the <br>
times was 20.43 to 26.75.  The second half of this average was really <br>
consistent which is part of the reason I was able to break 24.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I broke my single solve record today of 19.02.  It seems that <br>
my range is getting narrower and narrower.  When I used to average <br>
about 26 seconds, I&#x27;d have times from 20 seconds to 32 seconds.  It <br>
seems like there&#x27;s a limit unless I improve my single solve times.  <br>
There&#x27;s only so much you can go by being consistent... eventually, if <br>
my single solve time doesn&#x27;t get any better, I&#x27;m going to find myself <br>
doing 19.02 seconds 12 times in a row.  (Actually, that would be cool.)<br>
<br>
What do I do?  What&#x27;s there for me to do now (besides just practice <br>
practice practice) to bring my single solve time closer to 15 and my <br>
average closer to 20?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson,
Your situation seems pretty similar to mine. I PB average is 22.8 
but it would probably be a half second slower if done on a stackmat.
My times are also being squished down to a smaller range. My advice 
would be to learn more algs. My theory is that consistant times 
indicate that you have mastered the solution using certain set of 
algs. If your times ar inconsistant it indicates that you can still 
improve a lot with the algs you know. Have you learned all the 
Fridrich algs yet? Also I&#x27;d look for more efficient ways to solve 
commmon F2L postition taking advantage of open slots. You know, just 
some shortcuts. Also work on an Xcross or something. Along with 
learning the rest of the OLL algs, thats my plan for getting sub20. 
I&#x27;m not there yet though. Maybe someone faster has some better 
advice.

It looks better now, 125 moves on average.

But the last step is killing my times. It&#x27;s like Solution_2/Phase_4 at
Jaap&#x27;s (http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube4.htm), but with
4 centers (FBUD).
For this, I use almost only very basic commutators like uf&#x27;u&#x27;Fufu&#x27;F&#x27;
or u2r2u2r2.
Maybe somebody already tried to find a broader set of sequences
allowing you to solve this last step efficiently?
Call me :-)

Gilles.

it has rivets, you can slip I think its called an eclip under the end of the
rivet, making it tighter.  Hope that helps.

I have two questions about the looseness/tightness of a cube.

I just got a 3x3x3 that is extremely loose.  It pops on the F2L 
every time.  The spring can stretch up to 1.5 mm.  I  am wondering 
if there is a way to tighten it so I don&#x27;t have to return it.  

Also, can 4x4x4&#x27;s be lubed?  I know they pop easily, but would you 
recommend it?

Thanks for your help

i recently bought several rubiks.com cubes and i noticed that one of <br>
the cubes had a black center. it turns out that the black center <br>
turns very well. as for the cubes with white centers, they were only <br>
moderately good. does anyone know how to tell if its black of white <br>

   If you are working on the Last Level on the Up side: There are only
two ways that the last four corners can be out: two adjacent corners
need to be swapped or two corners across the center need to be
swapped. The first is solved by 7 moves the second by 6.
   Swap two adjacent corners: put those two corners on the left side
of Up: R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L. (Rotates 3 corners)
   Swap two across the center (also know as reverse corners): R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;
U F R.
   If you don&#x27;t want the corner orientation to change: move R2 B2 R F
R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R once or twice.
   In spite of appearances you cannot switch two corners without
changing edge positions.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, silicone works very well for loosening up a 4x4x4.  If you use 
a Rubiks.com one you have to apply it frequently at first, because 
it will still be tight after lubing it the first few times.  
Eastsheen ones don&#x27;t take a lot of lube and stay loose for a long 
time, so it depends on the type of 4x4x4 you have.

I would definitely recommend lubing your 4x4x4, it makes it easier 
on your wrists since a solve takes longer, plus it lets you do cool 
things like finger tricks in some cases :)

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s been a while since I took my Eastsheen 4x4x4 apart, but I think 
you just pry off one of the center piece caps and spray some lube 
inside.

For the rubiks.com cube you have to be more careful.  Turn a face 
about 45 degress and try to pry up one of the edge pieces.  Be 
really careful as this puts a lot of stress on the adjacent center 
piece, and the little foot piece attached to the centers can break 
really easily.  Basically what I do is check lots of the edge pieces 
until I find one that is particularly loose.  On a new cube you&#x27;ll 
have to use a key or a drew driver to pry the piece out (carefully) 
but on a looser cube you can use your fingers.

Just spray a good amount of lube inside, put the piece back in and 
turn the faces and spin the cube around for a few minutes to spread 
it around real well.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

In my opinion one can&#x27;t spray a 3x3x3 cube too much. But remember to 
use only high quality silicon spray. Personally i have good 
experience with Chesterton silicon spray, but i guess most brands 
work very well. There has been suggested and used many other 
lubricants for the cube. Some i think u should not use are : oilbased 
sprays like WD40. The cube will be smooth initially. But after a 
while the cube goes real stiff :-( I have seen here in this group 
that some use olive oil. I don&#x27;t recommend it. Any oil can 
potentially break down the plastic mould that makes up the cubicles. 
But if the cube is looked upon as a pure commodity then some might 
not care the cube will not last long ;-) Any excess lubricant can be 
wiped off easily with a dry cloth. To remove oilbased lubricants can 
be a pain. Silicone spray is washed off easily using lukewarm water.

When it comes to 4x4x4 cubes, taking them apart for lubing/spraying 
is a bit more involved. The eastsheens are probably best disassembled 
like this :

Put the cube firmly on a flat surface. Remove the four centercaps of 
the top layer with a pointed knife. They come off quite easily if u 
do it correct. Try a few different points/angles until it works. When 
this is done it&#x27;s time to unscrew the top &quot;center lock&quot; slightly. It 
can be taken off if so desired. Now u can spray inside the cube. Do 
not remove more pieces or lift the cube. If the cube &quot;falls apart&quot; in 
ur hands it&#x27;s a pain to assemble it properly :-(. After spraying put 
back the &quot;centre lock&quot;. Tighten the screw again. Put on the center 
caps. If  necessary repeat for more faces.

Other 4x4x4 cubes u can remove one or more edgepairs (1 at a time!!)
and then spray into the cube. The rubiks.com cube is actually quite 
strong. The facecenters have a much stronger foot than the old 4x4x4 
like Master/Revenge. But best way to remove an edge is to turn a 
layer so that an edge is right above another edge. Then use a knife 
to pop the edge out.

After spraying the cube turn all layers around several times to make 
sure the spray spreads &quot;everywhere&quot; inside. When this is done leave 
the cube for couple of hours to let the silicone dry inside.

Hmm .. maybe someone should make lubing videos of the various 
cubes ??  ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m constantly trying to work out *new* ideas, and this is my <br>
newest.  It is similar to something I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I call <br>
this method the TriadTram Method, and will explain the reasoning for <br>
name some other time.  Here is the description:<br>
<br>
Step1: Cross   (intuitive)<br>
Step2: 3 C/e pairs  (intuitive)<br>
Step3: 2x2x1 in LL (intuitive)<br>
Step4: Place Corner(non trivial)<br>
Step5: Place Edge+Orient Corners (50 algs)<br>
Step6: Orient Edges+Permute All (11 algs)<br>
<br>
Step3 is agreeably quite tricky, and almost annoying (for me).  With <br>
some practice and learning a few tricks I believe it is possible to <br>
get this step under control.  I&#x27;ve also thought of combining <br>
Step3&amp;Step4, as step4 involves so little effort it should hardly be <br>
counted as a step.  The &#x27;Intermediate Solution&#x27; involves learning <br>
only 21 algorithms. (Averages under 70 turns)  I am currently <br>
averaging under 35 seconds with this new method, and have not <br>
learned all the intermediate solution yet.  I have to go now.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

The VH method builds on Fridrich, and therefore requires more 
algorithms than the usual Fridrich (40 extra COLL and 32 extra edge 
techniques). So if you don&#x27;t want to learn Fridrich, then don&#x27;t 
worry about VH :)

If you want to be better than 40 seconds at the F2L, then simply go 
really slowly. It&#x27;s odd, but it will work :) When you become fluent 
at this this, start speeding up, but not so fast that you start to 
lose track of pieces or start locking up.

of the F2L algorithms as sequences of ± 8 moves, but try to think of 
them as logical solutions to relatively simple problems. Like Dan 
says on his website: It&#x27;s important that you don&#x27;t just know the 
moves, but you have to understand what&#x27;s happening to the pieces. 
Maybe you should try learning some of the F2L algs that way.

I hope it helps  ;).

Hello,

While these records were rejected by Guinness, I can tell you that in
October, a new record book called &quot;The Book of Alternative Records&quot;
will be available in the book stores. I am one of the authors.

The book will contain the most world records from
http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/rubik.html.

For this list and the book, records can be set only at some official
event. This has not to be a tournament, it can also be a TV appearance
or some show before audience.
What we need are standards for inspection time before solving the
cube, minimum number of moves to scramble a cube etc. Suggestions are
welcome, working together with a new world organization would be a
good thing.

By the way:
In October, we are organizing the Mental Calculation World Cup in
Germany (see http://www.recordholders.org/en/events/worldcup04/).
Maybe some of the members of this group are interested in this event
as well?

Best Wishes,
Ralf

          <div class="email-content">i think I realize why this wasn&#x27;t an active topic

However, putting extraneous stresses on any one person

restrict this discussion to items of the proposed

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brent,
 
I&#x27;m not ron, macky, or frank, nor am I a sub-20 cuber, but I&#x27;ve noticed myself when I solve in fast and not so fast times. The times when I do the best I&#x27;m in a what I call a &#x27;tense&#x27; mood. I usually sit while I cube, and I found that sitting up leads to better results than slouching back (which I thought would lead to me being more relaxed and hence faster, but that&#x27;s not the case). That may seem like an obvious thing, but in fact everything has to be like that, every aspect of your mood/position (body/mind) has to be saying &quot;READY!&quot; because that&#x27;s when you are best able to focus and look ahead (and actually find useful information). Usually being tense is something we label as negative, but it has some positive side effects that can enhance solving times.

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody,

I think this method, mentioned a few weeks ago, includes some 
interesting ideas:

--- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, &quot;brokulo&quot;

So, what is the trick to reduce the number of algorithms for the 4th 
pair so much?!  

I too think that the ZB method requires way many algorithms for my 
brain to handle, and that with a bit of thought and inventiveness we 
can come up with something that&#x27;s not only easier to learn but also 
more efficient.  Basically I&#x27;ve been working in the same direction 
mentioned here...how to solve the last layer along with the last 
corner edge pair with only 2 looks (and preferably with less 
algorithms than what the ZB method asks for).  For these two steps, 
I&#x27;ve looked along the lines of soving all the corners first (5 
corners to solve, less than 100 algorithms if you use a 
few &#x27;tricks&#x27;), followed by solving all 5 edges (not so pretty, even 
using a few &#x27;tricks&#x27; here I&#x27;d guess there&#x27;s atleast 200 algorithms, 
and you&#x27;d be spending over 14 moves on this step on average)....and 
oh, all my algorithm counts include inverses and mirrors.

so a solution using this idea would look like:
1) xcross
2)corner-edge pair for F2L
3)&#x27;nother corner-edge pair
4) all remaining 5 corners
5) last 5 edges 

Or possibly, you might think of taking one step back and seeing if 
you could solve the last layer along with the last 2 corner-edge 
pairs in 3 looks (still resulting in a 5 look solution...as long as 
you can do an extended cross).  In doing that second to last corner-
edge pair you could twist one of the remaining 5 corners...reducing 
the number of possible Corner Orientations that you&#x27;d have to deal 
with later.

This might result in (which is a lot like the method quoted from 
brokulo&#x27;s message):
1) xcross
2)Corner-edge pair for F2L
3)Next corner-edge pair + orient one of the 5 remaining corners
4)Last corner-edge pair + orient the LL corners
5)LL edge orinetation + permute LL

But I still don&#x27;t think the help from step 3) will reduce the number 
of cases for step 4) to make this method resonable....so again, 
what&#x27;s your trick brokulo?

I&#x27;ve also tried to build a 4-look method that doesn&#x27;t have anything 
terribly complicated as it&#x27;s first step (one whole face, or a double 
extended cross is a little unreasonable I think) but then also have 3 
proceeding steps that each require less that 200 algorithms....I 
think this is possible.  Again, I think a few less obvious &#x27;tricks&#x27; 
must be used, but these tricks will take less time that adding a 
whole &#x27;nother look and settling for a 5-look method.

A stab that I&#x27;ve taken at this looks like:
1)solve a 1x2x3, Gilles Roux knows what I&#x27;m talking about.  I&#x27;d 
consider this 1x2x3 to be part of the &#x27;bottom face.&#x27;
2)all 4 middle layer edges + centers done correctly (not as hard of a 
step as it may seem...easily less then a 100 situations to look at if 
you break it down in a certain way
3)the 5 remaining corners  (ugly...even if you get a little help from 
step 2, this might require around 350 algorithms)
4)the 5 remaining edges, 4 from the LL along with the one that you 
could consider missing from the 1x2x3  (also not too much 
fun...probably over 200 algorithms, even with &#x27;tricks&#x27;)

any other wild ideas?

Happy cubing,
Jake E.

ps.  does anyone happen to know how Zbigniew Zborowski manages to 
solve the F2L in under 19 moves on average?  Does he approach it the 
same way ryan heise does?  Is he only using the 15 seconds for 
inspection, and are his hands traveling at full speed while solving?

          <div class="email-content">A couple of questions about the method

 

In step 4, place corner, does that mean place the first layer corner? Or
twist U so that the corner of the 2x2x1 is in the correct spot?

 

And in step 6, how can it only be 11 algs when PLL alone, not including the
edges, is 21? Is it a typo, or is it done in different steps? Or do I just
not understand?

 

Also, do you have the algs needed posted somewhere?

 

Evan

This means to place the corner in the first layer
correctly.  This step is too easy, making it *almost*
shameful to count as a step by itself.

When you build your 2x2x1 block (step3), you place the
three pieces involved correctly.  This limits the
possible permutations to 5.

Last Step=
6 situations where edges are incorrectly flipped
5 situations where edges are correctly flipped

Kyle Bryant has been awesome enough to help me
generate algs for my method.  I haven&#x27;t posted
anything, although I plan to post my intermediate
solution very soon.  I just want to make sure there
are no errors in the &#x27;rough draft&#x27; I have typed up.  

Thankyou for the response! :)

Brent, 

I get my best times when I am relaxed.  When I am tensed up, I get a ridiculous number of lock ups and piece pops.  I am still very focused, but loose and relaxed.

right, my mistake, but that&#x27;s still impressive.  I&#x27;d guess that 
solving the F2L minus one pair by doing &#x27;cross, pair, pair, pair&#x27; 
would take atleast 21 moves on average.  And even if someone could 
consistently solve an extended cross (cross + first pair) in 10 moves 
than the next two pairs would have to average less than 5 moves each 
for them to do what ZZ does......or am I missing something here?  I 
would never consider myself to be an expert of the F2L!

          <div class="email-content">I was fooling around with the method, trying some stuff out, and 
noticed a few things.  When you make the 2x2x1 block, if u treat 
like a f2l pair, and actualy put it in the empty slot, its much 
easier, at least for me.  Then when you put the corner in, you can 
make sure that the pair comes out correctly oriented.

And when it comes to inserting the last f2l edge and orienting the 
corners, just an idea, what if you orient the edges instead.  At 
least two edges are oriented because of the 2x2x1 (although the 
other oriented edge might be in the slot).  Im not sure how many 
algs you would then need to orient the remainign three corners and 
permute all.  Just thought it might make it slightly easier or 
reduce number of algs. I havent done any calculations or antyhing to 
see though, it was just a thought.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

I think the best mood depends a lot on your style.
I cube faster when I am concentrated and my hands and head are fully
relaxed. In that mood I can tell what my times are without watching the
clock (0.5 second accuracy). When my hands are not relaxed I set bad times,
even when I think that I set a good time.

My worst times are set when I am eager to set a good time. So in front of
people I always say that I will set a time of 17 seconds, which is a good
target going &quot;slowly&quot;, and I often solve in a fluent 15-16 seconds.

I use some simple tricks (like washing my eyes with cold water, and
visualizing myself solving a cube with random cases for the steps) to get
into the best mood.
One lesson Guus (WC 1982 runner-up) taught me, was to convert the &quot;negative&quot;
energy from adrenaline into positive energy to set a good performance.
Unfortunately this hasn&#x27;t worked for me in competitions yet. :-(
But it will work for Euro 2004!

Have fun,

Ron

myself when I solve in fast and not so fast times. The times when I do the
best I&#x27;m in a what I call a &#x27;tense&#x27; mood. I usually sit while I cube, and I
found that sitting up leads to better results than slouching back (which I
thought would lead to me being more relaxed and hence faster, but that&#x27;s not
the case). That may seem like an obvious thing, but in fact everything has
to be like that, every aspect of your mood/position (body/mind) has to be
saying &quot;READY!&quot; because that&#x27;s when you are best able to focus and look
ahead (and actually find useful information). Usually being tense is
something we label as negative, but it has some positive side effects that
can enhance solving times.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Richard,

I really like your idea of making a 1x1x2 on the LL, and decided to 
expand on this approach a little bit. I practiced making the 1x1x2 
for about 20 min, and managed to average about 3 seconds. After this, 
if we can somehow solve the last c-e pair without breaking the 1x1x2, 
we can use Mirek Goljan&#x27;s algorithms for solving the last layer in 
one step when there is a corner and two adjacent edges are correct 
(58 patterns) as the last step. 
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/L1/ece.htm
These are the number of moves then for each step:

1. Cross: 7
2. F2lx3: 21
3. 1x2x2: 9
4. Last slot: ?
5. LL with 1x1x2: i&#x27;m guessing around 14 moves

If step 4 takes 9 moves, then the avg moves for total comes out to be 
60. Also, I&#x27;ve tried the last step with the algs printed in front of 
me, and the recognition is not too hard. Without step 4, this system 
actually has less algorithms to memorize than Fridrich Method. 
Considering that step 1-4 can be done almost without a stop, I think 
there&#x27;s a good possibility of producing fast times with this method.

It isn&#x27;t really a DVD, it is actually a CD-R. Lot of the stores from 
Santa Monica Beach wanted me to make one. So yeah, there isn&#x27;t a

Also the shipping there is a flat rate. So if you buy 2 dollar
stickers that weigh about 0 pounds and 0 ounces you pay 8 dollars for
shipping!

If no one sells them I guess I&#x27;ll have to make my own like the french
guy who washes his cubes in soapy water... he gives them baths!

Try an easier solution beforehand, get used into how pieces move and 
what slice you can move without breaken what you did. Try doing 1 
face at first, fill up the middle edge. As soon as you &quot;get it&quot; it&#x27;ll 
go much better, dont try to go on speedcubing that fast.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
   A funny cube related story I have for you:<br>
So I decided it&#x27;s time to get my oil changed in my car, and being the <br>
descriminating consumer I am I drop it off at wal-mart to do their <br>
$20 plug and chug service, no frills.  The day before, I had recieved <br>
my very first Alexanders&#x27; Star puzzle, which I had brought with me to <br>
work on while waiting for other various things I was out and about <br>
doing.  I decided not to take it into wal-mart with me though while <br>
they changed my oil, so I left it in the cup holder, completely <br>
solved.<br>
   Well I got back into the car about an hour later and there was a <br>
fresh quart of oil in a bag in my driver&#x27;s seat waiting for me.  I <br>
thought this odd as wal-mart has never left me oil before, and I sure <br>
as heck didn&#x27;t pay for any extra oil.  I pondered this during the <br>
drive home. Then as I start to climb the stairs to my apartment <br>
carrying the alexander&#x27;s star, I go to scramble it when I realize, <br>
IT&#x27;S ALREADY (slightly) SCRAMBLED!  So my theory is as follows:  The <br>
wal-mart techs got a little bored waiting for the oil to drain, they <br>
notice the puzzle in seemingly random array (though in fact solved) <br>
and think &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve never seen anything quite like that!&quot;  They pick <br>
it up and give it a twist or two.  Then they think &quot;Oh crap.  I don&#x27;t <br>
remember what I did.  I hope it wasn&#x27;t in any special kind of state. <br>
Crap crap crap.... maybe if we give him some free oil he won&#x27;t <br>
complain.&quot;  And nothing was ever said about it again.<br>
<br>
  I sure got a kick out of it when I put 2 and 2 together!  Poor guys.<br>
<br>
And In a similar story, I&#x27;ve decided to become the hit and run <br>
cubist!  I was in the mall yesterday and browsing a Spencer&#x27;s Gifts, <br>
when my girlfriend noticed on the counter a scrambled rubik&#x27;s cube.  <br>
A cursory examination made it clear that no one was in the middle of <br>
a solve (or anywhere close) and it was out for the public to play <br>
with.  So seeing no one at the counter and no one watching (except my <br>
girlfriend of course) I solve the cube and put it in a slightly less <br>
discrete place on the counter and walk out without a word.  I think I <br>
need a mask and a cape!  Anyone else do things like this?<br>
<br>
Best to all,<br>
Daniel<br>

zz says he first solves the cross and then uses some &#x27;tricks&#x27;... but i

try this site, should help you get the middle edges. But i&#x27;m not sure 
if this is a good for the other steps as i did not use it after the 
2nd layer.

http://nerdparadise.com/puzzles/333/



after the 2nd layer i used this:
http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm

remember these are beginner methods don&#x27;t expect record sub 20 times.

1. This is the website where I learned my first solution:
http://jjorg.chem.unc.edu/personal/monroe/cube/Denny3x3/centeredge/ce
nteredge.html. It&#x27;s not very efficient, but the solution for the 
middle edges is explained with very understandeble symbols.
2. http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html is 
another good website for a beginner solution.
3. The diagram&#x27;s on the website&#x27;s suggest you should solve the cube 
with the first layer on top. Ofcourse, that&#x27;s possible, but if you 
are planning to go for speed sometimes, I suggest you solve the 
cross on the bottom (or on the left face), and keep it there. That 
way, it&#x27;s easier to execute the moves for the rest of the firs two 
layers, and it&#x27;s easier to see where the pieces are going.
3. Don&#x27;t just memorize the moves, also look where the pieces are 
going, and how the edge is &#x27;paired-up&#x27; with it&#x27;s corner, and how the 
corner-edge-pair is inserted into it&#x27;s correct (solved) position. 
This way, it&#x27;s easier to remember the moves.
4. Don&#x27;t try to solve the cube full-speed, especially when you&#x27;re a 
beginner. I fact, I think the best way to get faster is to solve the 
cube very slowly. I solve the cube in about 25 seconds, but can&#x27;t 
improve my times by solving the cube full-speed a 1000 times. 
Instead, solving the cube very slowly is still one of the things 
that help me improve my times.

This is a video of someone solving a middle layer edge. It&#x27;s a bit 
fast, but good enough to see where the pieces are going, and to see 
how to do the moves.

Good luck,

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I did something similar last year. In some big store I asked <br>
the guy working in the toy section if they had the Rubik&#x27;s cube or <br>
similar puzzles. He said &quot;no&quot;. But then I looked anyway and easily <br>
found a few and also keychains and 2x2 I think. Damn liar! Then I <br>
saw a scrambled cube on a counter and nobody around. So I solved it <br>
and walked away.<br>
<br>
And recently during a big dinner for a programming contest a friend <br>
had a cube as well, and when his team was out of the room to get <br>
some food I took it, solved it and made the checkerboard pattern. I <br>
don&#x27;t think he noticed, though. Plus he can solve the cube anyway.<br>

&gt; A cursory examination made it clear that no one was in the middle <br>
of <br>
&gt; a solve (or anywhere close) and it was out for the public to play <br>

          <div class="email-content">Another suggestion for a beginners solution:<br>
<br>
Learn the Petrus method (lar5.com/cube/); one of the<br>
reasons I suggest this is that it requires only that<br>
you learn three (3) algorithms (edge flipper, Niklas<br>
and Sune), which means that with relatively little<br>
work you can solve the cube (and get a feeling of<br>
acomplishment) while steadily learning more about how<br>
the cube works (gettin&#x27; faster).<br>
<br>
Another pro is that it can be expanded according to<br>
your ambition and need for speed, by learning more<br>
algorithms and specific cases. If you&#x27;re really<br>
ambitious (or really in love with the method), you<br>
could learn 177 algs, which allow to comlete the LL in<br>
one step (edges are already oriented), averaging 12.08<br>
moves (see http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/);<br>
that plus my estimate of 4.5 moves for Orient Edges<br>
gives LL: 16.58, this is faster than the Fridrich<br>
Method (LL: approx 21). Which is well over a second<br>
saved.<br>
<br>
Take that, cookie-cutter Fridrich users ;)<br>

I haven&#x27;t had the luxury of trying the original cubes or any of the 
custom modified speedcubes that some of these guys talk about, but I 
love them.  I just started speedcubing about 6 months ago with the 
Rubiks.com cubes and I must say they haven&#x27;t given me a problem.  I 
guess it&#x27;s a bummer you can&#x27;t adjust them like the ones with the 
screws, but like you said, I don&#x27;t think there is a need.  They&#x27;re 
already pretty loose and lubing doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference 
with these.

I was parked next to a car at walmart and this person left their

The fact is that the petrus method and the fridrich
method are equally capable of producing results in
terms of solving the cube.

Fridrich offers a wonderful base for f2l, if anything,
learn both F2L methods and then you will at least have
a very good concept of how to look ahead for a 2x2 and
a cross, then you can combine that to learn eXtended
Cross (cross with one f2l pair, or a 2x2 with legs)

Cookie cutter fridrich users?
the gradation of methodology among Fridrich users
blasts that assertion to nothingness, so bah on you!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jonas,

A second faster, yes, but it takes 177 algoritms. That&#x27;s a little 
more than I have to memorize for fridrich method.

But I do think (intuitively (is that a word? I am not so good with 
English)) that Lars Petrus way of building the F2L is more efficient 
than cross + 4 CE pairs, but I think it&#x27;s also more complex. It&#x27;s 
more efficient (I think), because after the 2x2x2 block, there are 3 
free faces that can be turned without breaking up the solved part. 
But to profite from this, some very complex decisions must be made 
(I don&#x27;t know if I am right about this, so correct me if I am wrong).
But when I am done with learning the 41 OLL algs, I&#x27;ll maybe try to 
combine the Fridrich &amp; LP method for the F2L.

Greetings,

Joël.

In line for one of the coasters, I always have the most fun- someone would say, &quot;Hey, I bet you couldn&#x27;t do that before you get on the ride!&quot; And then I amaze the surrounding ten or so people by solving it before the ride cycles once. (I average a little less than a minute) Then there&#x27;s a fair amount of swearing and disbelief over it. Then one or two people would ask the stereotypical questions, or say the stereotypical responses: &quot;It was just luck&quot; or &quot;There&#x27;s a pattern you follow, isn&#x27;t there?&quot; or &quot;I used to be able to do that&quot; and the like. I&#x27;ve never run into another person who could actually solve the cube in the process though, sadly.

And In a similar story, I&#x27;ve decided to become the hit and run 
cubist!  I was in the mall yesterday and browsing a Spencer&#x27;s Gifts, 
when my girlfriend noticed on the counter a scrambled rubik&#x27;s cube.  
A cursory examination made it clear that no one was in the middle of 
a solve (or anywhere close) and it was out for the public to play 
with.  So seeing no one at the counter and no one watching (except my 
girlfriend of course) I solve the cube and put it in a slightly less 
discrete place on the counter and walk out without a word.  I think I 
need a mask and a cape!  Anyone else do things like this?

Best to all,
Daniel

          <div class="email-content">Up until today I have been using Oddzon cubes. I&#x27;ve been purchasing 
them in a local-ish toy store specializing in puzzles and stuff. 
Anyhow a week ago I would in 100% honesty tell anyone that the 
Oddzon cube I held in my hand then was the best speedcube I ever 
had. Then I bought one of those adjustables you are talking about. 
There&#x27;s really no comparing these two, the new one is majestically 
better. Then again I think maybe the Oddzon cubes I buy at that 
store may have been stuck in a warehouse for years...

Where do you get that Chesterton stuff? I figure if you can get it, 
so can I. Personally I use CRC Silicone Spray which I get at 
Statoil, but if you have a better option I&#x27;m happy to switch.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

Thanks for that usefull tip! When I tried this, I told myself to 
fully relax, and be satisfied with 28 seconds, wich is very slow for 
me. The first solve I did this way was sub-20, wich is very fast for 
me. A few solves later, I broke my record for one solve! Funny to 
see how big the phsychological factor really is.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, it&#x27;s online again:
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3_single_alg

I added a table with the setup algorithms I use now. I&#x27;d like to 
rewrite the page a bit and use a better example solve with applets 
showing the steps, but that will have to wait a bit.

I also made up a new similar method for the second part, i.e. 
solving the corners. It also solves the corners one at a time. It 
uses 3+1 algorithms, but the big advantage is that the setup 
algorithms are just single turns. These are the algs (lower case 
letter means turn two layers):

Bring DLB to UFR:
F2 L U2 R B R&#x27; U2 L F&#x27; L F L F2
(F-2 L U-2) (l U l&#x27; U2) (r U&#x27; L U L U2) x&#x27;

Bring DLB to RUF:
(L2 U2) (R  B&#x27; R&#x27; U2) (L2 F&#x27;) (L&#x27; F  L)
(L-2 U-2) (l U&#x27; l&#x27; U2) (L2 x U&#x27;) (L&#x27; U L x&#x27;)

Bring DLB to FRU:
y [mirror of previous case] y&#x27;

Transition between edges-phase and corners-phase:
F2 B2 R  L  B&#x27; L&#x27; B  R&#x27; B2 L  B&#x27; L&#x27; F2
x&#x27; D2 U2 R (L U&#x27; L&#x27; U) (R&#x27; U2) (L U&#x27; L&#x27;) D2 x

Each alg is given twice, the second version describing how I execute 
it.

To solve a corner (other than DLB which is the buffer corner), put 
its place to UFR, RUF or FRU with a single turn, then apply the 
appropriate alg and undo the setup turn.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I have uploaded a cube timer that I wrote in Java in the files <br>
section. It generates a 30-move scramble and calculates session <br>
average as well as the standard 10-solve average (eliminating the <br>
slowest and fastest of 12). It also keeps track of the standard <br>
deviation of your times within the current rolling average. I find <br>
this very usefull to check the consistancy of my times. You can also <br>
save your best average of the session to a text file.<br>
<br>
The sounds on the countdown are nothing special, you can change them <br>
to whatever you want by using your own WAV files. I figured some <br>
people here might want to check it out...<br>

well, its great...if it would time correctly
one second of its time takes like 3 seconds on my computer and i end 
up with times like 7 seconds

          <div class="email-content">This argument kind of reminds me of another type of
argument we had as children.  Remember this one: My
dad could beat up your dad. No mine would beat up
yours.  Well, my dad once lifted a 2 ton truck over,
and he didn&#x27;t even have to try that hard.  Throw
around all the statistics and averages around that you
want, but when it comes right down to it overzealous
opinions mean nothing.  Every method could be great. 
A vanilla layer method could be great if you felt like
learning a ton of algorithms.  There are also varying
results based on the individual.  Recognition of
positions, and comfort with transitions play an
important role.  Oh yeah, I challenge everyone to
argue with me, for no reason other than to make waves.
 There are no superiors here, especially with methods.
(although there are exceptions)  The best method will
be a combination of many.  I would not be surprised if
someday people would solve the cube fridrichs way,
petrus way, or CF way, depending on the situation the
cube is in.  The idea is to be just a little more open
minded.

<br>
I&#x27;m glad it helped you achieve faster times :P<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a work in progress, I&#x27;m surprised to see that it doesn&#x27;t time <br>
accurately on your computer...I wonder if it is the Java Virtual <br>
Machine you are using. I would suggest using Sun&#x27;s JVM. I was <br>
sceptical as to whether I could make an acurate timer as Java is <br>
compiled into byte-code which is processes real time during the <br>
execution of the program by the Virtual Machine. I don&#x27;t think it is <br>
nearly as efficient as C++, which is compiled into machine code. I <br>
just needed it to be cross platform...it works great in both Windows <br>
and Linux on my computer.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if anybody experiences any more problems with the <br>
timer, maybe I could actually make it a useful program. thanks.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi.

I fear that I might sound like a Petrus Pusher, but I
have a suggestion. But firstly, I don&#x27;t know what your
excact intentions are for learning the 4-look method.
But if you learn it for the low number of algorithms,
I&#x27;d suggest you look at the Petrus method, from step 3
(which is the same as cross + 2 pairs):
http://www.lar5.com/cube/fas3.html. This allows you to
cut down the need for algorithms to only 3: a 3-move
edge orienter, a 7-move corner permuter (Niklas) and a
7-move corner orient/edge permuter (Sune). Of course
you sacrifice speed compared to the Knights
Intermediate method, but save on memory. When you
wanna learn more algorithms, you could easily add the
Permute All set (Knights &quot;level 2&quot;) and Orient All
(full Fridrich).

This is, of course, just my humble opinion.

Jonas.

PS. On a sidenote: I might have been advertising the
Petrus method a bit too agressively, and of course
there&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect method, save
calculating God&#x27;s algorithm in 15 seconds :D
hmm... well, I got a few weeks to spare...

          <div class="email-content">One time I was at a festival and was getting a bit bored by what was 
going on at the time. So, I decided to make my own fun. I thought if 
I bought a crazy harlequin hat (with little bells!) from one of the 
stalls and then wandered around asking random people to scramble the 
cube for me to solve, then people would just assume I was part of 
the festival entertainment! It worked, and it was lots of fun.

One very surprising thing though was the number of people who 
said &#x27;oh no, I don&#x27;t know how&#x27; when I asked them to scramble the 
cube?? What do they mean they can&#x27;t *scramble* a cube?? Everyone can 
mess it up, it&#x27;s just the solving that takes some skill!!

          <div class="email-content">Hi
O2 the mobile phone company are having a party in Soho, London on Wednesday.
Is there anyone in the UK who would like to come and show off some
speedcubing (it should be a good party and lots of fun) ?
Thanks (e-mail me direct - davej@...)

Some solving techniques end with two twisted edges across from each 
other on one face.  That would look solved even though you should 
have one more algorithm!

said i could do it faster. he bet me 5 that i couldnt do it in a minute so i go slightly faster <br>
and do it in a minute. i say i could do faster and bets me i cant do it in 30 seconds for <br>
another 5 and i do it in 25ish seconds and i start laughing like a madman while my friend <br>
hands me $11. good thing he did the betting because i didnt have lunch money that day!<br>

there were a record for most gifts earned by just solving the cube I <br>
think I&#x27;d win it. I&#x27;ve been cubing for a year and I&#x27;ve earned over 50 <br>
drinks, 2CDs in a shop offered by the owner, 2cubes and a keychain <br>
cube, and I&#x27;ve been invited to give a cube lesson for kids wich <br>
earned me good money.<br>
I just know all the &quot;mind tricks&quot; to get people to ask me to solve it <br>
or even bet I can&#x27;t; I my showoff is very subtle hehe. Just show the <br>
cube, play confused... Almost all the bars I go to I will get a drink <br>
for free. I&#x27;ve never met anyone who could solve the cube here in <br>
Portugal other than those taught by me so it really amazes people <br>
even with my 30avg. cubing is the deal ;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok<br>
<br>
I was up this morning, thinking about notation, and I<br>
think I came up with a standard notation that will be<br>
constant through cube order 2 to 7<br>
<br>
2x2x2 involves only face moves, of course, so standard<br>
F R U D B L applies<br>
for the 3x3, its possible to choose between a larger<br>
array of moves, F f R r U u D d B b L l M E S<br>
but what about the 4x4x4?<br>
<br>
we use lower case letters in a confusing way with the<br>
revenge, which I think can be supplanted with the<br>
following<br>
<br>
r = MR, which means the arbitrary M slice move, (which<br>
doesnt exist directly), where the slice of the group<br>
of slices that could be marked M nearest the R face is<br>
turned clockwise<br>
<br>
l = ML<br>
u = EU<br>
d = ED<br>
b = SB<br>
f = SF<br>
<br>
for full slice turns<br>
<br>
ML + MR&#x27; = M<br>
ED&#x27; + EU = E<br>
and so on<br>
<br>
for the 5x5x5 slice configurations would look like<br>
this (from L to R)<br>
<br>
| L | ML | M | MR | R |<br>
<br>
and for the 6x6x6:<br>
    <br>
| L | mL | ml | mr | mR | R |<br>
     \___ML___/\___MR___/ <br>
 <br>
| L | mL | ml | mr | mR | R |<br>
         \____M____/<br>
<br>
| L | mL | ml | mr | mR | R |<br>
\___l___/           \___r___/ <br>
<br>
and finally, the 7x7x7&#x27;s config would look like this<br>
(again from L to R)<br>
<br>
| L | mL | ml | M | mr | mR | R |<br>
<br>
L + mL = l<br>
mL + ml = ML<br>
mr + mR = MR<br>
R + mR = r<br>
<br>
just a brainstorm, perhaps a bit of a brain tornado.<br>
Any thoughts?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I like it. Fortunately after the 5x5 all the cubes are pretty
much the same and you don&#x27;t need notation, but this is what I would
use if I had to. :D

          <div class="email-content">Right.

I&#x27;m not gonna bother you all with a lenghty,
semi-thoughtful rant, so here&#x27;s the point:

1. I miss a symbol for the null move (and if you think
this isn&#x27;t useful, make sure your calendar isn&#x27;t
saying &quot;24 AD&quot;). I would have suggested &quot;e&quot; (based on
my slim knowledge of group theory), but since it&#x27;s in
use, I suggest &quot;I&quot; (for Identity), &quot;O&quot; (as in Origin)
or &quot;V&quot; (since it&#x27;s hard to confuse with any other
character that&#x27;s already in use). Personally I prefer
&quot;I&quot;.

2. A way to indicate to indicate a turn of (on the
6x6x6), say &quot;ml&#x27; mr mR&quot; as one syllable (that&#x27;d be
layers 2, 3 and 4 counting from R). And more
generally, a system that&#x27;d allow me to describe ANY
move of adjacent slices.

3. A way to indicate the direction of 180ï¿½ moves. I
know that the result is the same on the cube, but hey,
it isn&#x27;t always the same on the timer.

right, that&#x27;s my thoughts about the notation system.
Except the implied &quot;apart from what I said, it&#x27;s
fine.&quot;

Jonas

PS. A few lube questions: I vaseline treated my cube
(shame on me), then I tried to remove it with soap.
After that, I started silicone treating it. It runs
fine when treated, but the effect doesn&#x27;t last long
(two weeks). Should I use more silicone per treatment?
is it the vaseline? Can I remove it? Your input will
be appreciated.

          <div class="email-content">hey,
what you&#x27;re running into is the parity problem. One alg you can do to make your 5x5x5 (and 7x7x7 I think too) solvable is [R(Uu)²]x5 (meaning 5 times R(Uu)² in a row, without changing the position or orientation of the cube in your hands. It doesn&#x27;t apparently affect the inner pieces (in fact it does, but unless you marked the inner pieces with any sign that could show you their position, you won&#x27;t see any difference between before and after the alg) but it does in fact disturb the edge groups. With some practice and depending on the method you use, you&#x27;ll soon be able to see the parity problem before you finished the whole cube and get these two edges screwed up. for example (I build the centers first then &quot;pair&quot; (or triple...) up the edges then solve like a 3x3) I know there is this problem when I have only 2 edges to swap in 2 different pairs (the rest of the edges are solved), and with some practice, you&#x27;ll soon be able to use this alg efficiently by positionning the problematic
 edge groups around your cube.
Hope it makes sense and is understandable...

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody!<br>
<br>
Would you like to get a brandnew Dogic for a normal price?<br>
<br>
Meffert&#x27;s might offer this and two nice other new puzzles soon. But <br>
it depends on feedback to show how many people are interested. I <br>
learned this from their mailing list and Uwe lets me do the <br>
announcement here on his behalf. Rather than rephrasing everything <br>
he said, I&#x27;ll copy the main part:<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
Release of special pre-production limited editions and collectors&#x27; <br>
PUZZLES<br>
<br>
<br>
I am pleased to announce several exciting new puzzles:<br>
<br>
<br>
(1) The &quot;SMARTBALL&quot; range comes in several versions for this special <br>
pre-release collector&#x27;s edition. The two-color version i<br>
s the easiest and the Soccer Ball the hardest. The Smartball uses a <br>
completely new hollow puzzle concept with no internal mec<br>
hanism. The challenge is to rotate six large interlaced circles to <br>
create interesting patterns and designs and then put them<br>
back in their original pattern. The Smartball could be described as <br>
an advanced Masterball concept.<br>
<br>
(2) &quot;DOGIC&quot; I have negotiated a deal with the Original Dogic maker <br>
to transfer the Dogic molds to our factory if the interest<br>
 in DOGIC is sufficient to warrant to manufacture Dogic again. So <br>
the response to this mailing is very important. Please do y<br>
our best to spread the word to enable Dogic to be available again <br>
via our puzzle shop at regular prices.<br>
<br>
(3) &quot;JACKPOT&quot; is unique, simply the most exciting puzzle ever! It is <br>
a beautiful mechanical puzzle utilizing two separate bal<br>
l-bearing mechanisms and full electronic light displays which are <br>
activated as each face is solved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Three variations are proposed for this individually signed, limited-<br>
edition pre-production release.<br>
<br>
<br>
To select puzzles you would like to have, go to:<br>
<br>
http://www.mefferts.com/new-puzzle-release. Please note: You are not <br>
placing an order. This merely helps me determine by July<br>
 1st. which puzzles I should put into production and how many of <br>
those puzzles that are selected. Even a limited production r<br>
un of 1,000 to 3,000 pieces will not cover the costs of development, <br>
but this is my way of showing appreciation for your loya<br>
l support over the years. Production lots of less than 1,000 will <br>
not be practical, so please spread the word to your puzzle<br>
enthusiast friends worldwide, by any means, to make this special pre-<br>
release offer a reality.<br>
<br>
<br>
Happy Puzzling<br>

If you&#x27;re lucky you might get one on ebay for like $500 (yes, two <br>

The new future price of Meffert&#x27;s is unknown, but Uwe wrote &quot;enable <br>
Dogic to be available again via our puzzle shop at regular prices.&quot;<br>

It *is* a bit of a complex puzzle, but *my personal* estimate is $40 <br>

Note that you don&#x27;t need to get their newsletter now to show 
interest in the new puzzles. Just visit the page that was mentioned 
in my initial posting.

Also note that two of the puzzles are on the first page and there&#x27;s 
an extra link to the third puzzle.

And also, you don&#x27;t commit yourself to buying something. It&#x27;s just a 
poll to find out how much interest there is. Of course you should 
answer truthfully so if you&#x27;re not interested then don&#x27;t say so. 
That&#x27;s only fair. But if you can imagine yourself (or your uncle, 
grandma, ... ;-)) to buy one then tell them!!!

I myself would looooove to get a new Dogic. Actually several.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I was at a restaurant with friends tonight and we got onto the topic <br>
of cubing. One of the friends there hadn&#x27;t seen me cube before, so <br>
she asked for a demo. Of course I was only too keen to oblige! :) As <br>
I was doing this, a waiter came over to watch too. He said he <br>
recognised me from the newspaper (there was an article about me in <br>
the local paper last year after Worlds). Coincidentally, the waiter <br>
was learning to cube at the time and was so impressed that he gave <br>
me a free drink (cool!).<br>
<br>
After dinner, as we were getting ready to leave the restaurant, the <br>
waiter came over to our table with a cube and a pen and asked if I <br>
would autograph his cube! :) I told him he&#x27;s clearly a speedcuber in <br>
the making if he always has a cube with him. (As we know, all <br>
serious speedcubers carry cubes around with them! ;)<br>

What method are you using,(do you solve it layer-by-layer?)and are 
there any specific parts of the solve that you have problems on?

<br>
I had this idea just now while walking back from picking up my lab <br>
notebook.  (I have final in an hour so I&#x27;ll probably elaborate more <br>
later.)  Would people be interested in a country vs. country Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Cube tournament?  Each country would have a representative.  That <br>
representative does not necessarily have to be a cuber.  The <br>
representative is in charge of holding whatever type of competition to <br>
determine the country&#x27;s team of 5 best cubers.  Then, we would have a <br>
head to head single or double elimination tournament bracket.  5 cubers <br>
against 5 cubers, they each do the same set of 5 solves, average the <br>
middle 3, and then average everyone&#x27;s middle 3 and which ever country <br>
has the faster average advances.<br>
<br>
This would of course be unofficial and just for fun and none of the <br>
averages would count for any WRCA recognized records.  This is just <br>
because it would not be feasible for the regulation necessary for <br>
official world records.  The advantage is that the cubers don&#x27;t have to <br>
travel anywhere and can compete from their own home on the honor system <br>
and everything.<br>
<br>
Are people up for this?  Think we could get a lot of countries?  It&#x27;d <br>
be so cool to see an Australian team!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, at the Caltech Spring Tournament, one of my friends who was 
acting as a judge said that he was equally impressed by the 14 second 
solves by Macky as he was by the 35 second solves by everyone else.  
Unless you&#x27;re a speedcuber, the 10 second difference really doesn&#x27;t 
register.

I should try to get some free drinks or something sometime.  Macky said 
he got something at Starbucks but that&#x27;s about it.  Bleh...

          <div class="email-content">I am using the &quot;Beginner Solution&quot; (found here 
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html ) to 
familiarize myself with the cube. 

I have gotten to last step and I am stuck on &quot;Permuting the LL 
Edges&quot;. I can&#x27;t place 2 of the edges and 2 of the corners in last 
layer. When I try I mess up the thing. It looks like the two errant 
edges should be swapped 180 degrees, while the two corners face the 
same direction and should just be interchanged. Easier said than 
done for me at this point.

I got a call requesting to do a documentary on the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  Just <br>

looking at anywhere from $25,000 to $100,000 for this project so this <br>

well, i would love to say i found a great link to a rubik&#x27;s themed <br>
chess set...but i can&#x27;t. i&#x27;ve been looking for a unique themed chess <br>
set, and it occured to me that i would like to be able to custom <br>
make one. i have quite a few hobbies that would translate nicely to <br>
a theme.<br>
<br>
like rubik&#x27;s.<br>
i can picture 2x2&#x27;s as the pawns...or keychain 3&#x27;s, 5x5 as a king, <br>
4x4 as queen, 3x3&#x27;s as bishops, siamese 2x2&#x27;s as knights, and those <br>
cylinder shaped 3x3&#x27;s as rooks.<br>
you could mix up the twisty puzzle content if you wanted, and have <br>
things like the nintendo barrel as rooks...whatever.<br>
<br>
hey, if anyone wants to assemble one of these for a picture, i&#x27;d <br>
LOVE it!! or if your good with photoshop maybe ;-)<br>

anyway, thought i&#x27;d share.<br>

          <div class="email-content">thanks for your great newbie solution page.

I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out how i should position the cube to 
perform the last moves (permuting LL edges). The original D face 
which became U face in intermediate steps is now complete. I only 
need to fix the edges of the LL which is done, I assume, 
by &quot;permuting LL edges&quot;. My question is: How should the cube be 
positioned in 3-D space before I start the last algorithm. Please 
use original designations of U L R B F D (which of these original 
face designations should now be in front, or top or bottom as I 
proceed with the algorithm). I need this as a reference point before 
doing the last moves.

thanks.

I&#x27;m not sure video conferencing would actually be necessary. Sure, it

So I&#x27;ll set up a website after I get out of school (literally this

Rechearch only one of 6.  The step 2 layer by layer is better fast <br>
but 1 sec. max seem to me realizable.  My average move is better for <br>
1 seconde and without inspection my step 1 is fastest. <br>
<br>
My friend 4e with official french. He push the limit for the edge <br>
mirror and symetric, average 23 unofficial.  He look for the step 2 <br>
with my corner method.  I don&#x27;t pretend and layer by layer on <br>
rubik&#x27;s cube is official but the 2x2x2 is same of fewest or big <br>
cube. The rubik&#x27;s cube is the only one edge!  I love without <br>
inspecton and approach 40-45 move max. <br>

Well, I think I might be doing this for France, cuz not too many French read
this group (désolé si je me trompe) and in case some do and are interested,
please email me at frsechet@... (msn frsechet@...). Yeah, it&#x27;s
a very cool idea! Anyway, if you&#x27;re French and reading this, please send me
an email (or IM me) and tell me if you&#x27;re interested. I&#x27;ll also ask other
people who don&#x27;t read this list.

Hey everyone,

So I&#x27;ll set up a website after I get out of school (literally this 
Friday).  I guess people should start thinking about getting together 
their countries.  If you&#x27;d like to be the one who organizes your 
country, you should also probably speak up.

          <div class="email-content">Not the best idea... not everyone from the united states will have a  
chance to make it to the national tournament.  Just because qualifying  
matches aren&#x27;t held in person at pasadena doesn&#x27;t mean that you won&#x27;t  
have a chance to make a bid for the US team.  Everyone will have a  
chance.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not exactly sure.  Let&#x27;s shoot for yearly first and see how it 
goes.  The style will be a tiny bit more official than a sunday contest 
but really, there&#x27;s no efficient way (unless you can think of 
something) of how to regulate something like this without costing a lot 
of money.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, there&#x27;s a slight problem with it.  The algorithms are actually 
the same thing it&#x27;s just that ross palmer puts in cube rotations.

I think the correct algorithm should be...

(R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27;) [u] (R&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; R2) (F&#x27; R&#x27; F R F)

does that help?

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for your effort Tyson, but i figured it out.
It&#x27;s a slight bug in the alg, the first F should be a F&#x27;

like this : (R&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;) [u] (R&#x27;F&#x27;R²U&#x27;) ((R&#x27;UR&#x27;)F)) (RF)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Evan,

You should talk to my Ditch Day team.  One of the EE&#x27;s at Caltech  
wanted to do something similar.  Perhaps you guys can work together?

His name is &quot;Chris Hiszpanski&quot; and you can reach him at  
hiszpans[nospam]@its.caltech.edu .  We were interested in creating an  
electrical Rubik&#x27;s Cube that does something when it&#x27;s solved.  (i.e.   
gives a clue, opens a door, takes your Statistical Mechanics final...)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everyone,<br>
<br>
I was in the shower (all my ideas come usually when I&#x27;m doing something <br>
random...) and I thought, would people be interested in a collegiate or <br>
school type Rubik&#x27;s Cube Cup?  This would be basically the exact same <br>
thing as the World Cube Cup but instead of countries, it&#x27;s schools or <br>
organizations.<br>
<br>
All it takes is one person at a school, and that person will infect <br>
quite a few with the cube bug.  Take Macky at First Avenue for <br>
example... he&#x27;s got a whole cube cult!  Anyway, this would be the same <br>
thing.  Schools or organizations would have their club president or <br>
just someone to be a representative contact me and they would be in <br>
charge of holding their own qualifiers somehow.  5 people per team, <br>
single or double elimination tournament style.<br>
<br>
Of course, I&#x27;ll elaborate when i get back home.  So close to being done <br>
with school... plowed through 5 finals and now just a 10 page paper on <br>
detecting extra-solar planets.  Ooh!  There&#x27;s one!  I think I see a <br>
cube!<br>

<br>
Here are the current list of representatives:<br>
<br>
United States:	Frank Morris<br>
France:		François Sechet<br>
Germany:		Patrick Bellenbaum<br>
<br>
Waiting for more people of their respective countries to speak up.  The <br>
country representatives are responsible for contacting the people of <br>
their country.  They should make an effort especially to contact the <br>
fastest known speedcubers in each country, especially cubers that do <br>
not read this yahoo forum.<br>
<br>
The country representatives should also start compiling a list of <br>
people whom would want to compete for a spot on the team.  If you would <br>
like to try out for your country&#x27;s team, e-mail your country <br>
representative.  More information on the qualifying competition will <br>
follow.<br>
<br>
If you would like to compete, but your country does not have a <br>
representative, either pressure someone to do it or perhaps you&#x27;d like <br>
to do it yourself.<br>
<br>
It would be great to get 16 countries... some nice number.  Countries <br>
that I think could field teams that need representatives:<br>
<br>
Canada, Italy, Sweden, Japan, Korea, Great Britain, Netherlands, <br>
Belgium, China, Phillipeans, Denmark, Australia<br>
<br>
Again, a website will be out in a few days.  I just need to finish the <br>
year.<br>

Count me in for the Dutch!

Btw. yes, speedcubing.com is down. They are still working on it.
It seems like we have too many sites deeplinking to content 
(especially videos) on our site.
Recently the average throughput has been 10GB a day...

Have fun,

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Duncan Dicks&quot; &lt;duncan@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> &lt;speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Thu, 10 Jun 2004 15:07:10 +0100<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been thinking about L2L strategies for a while after I realised that 1)<br>
my own method is a move in this direction, 2) that several other strtagies<br>
are moving in the same direction and 3) that there is a clear logic for<br>
doing this.<br>
<br>
Hopefully the name says it all - whereas Fridrich and some others are F2L<br>
followed by a LL, these strategies are moving towards part or all of FL and<br>
then solving the last 2 layers at the same time.  Several other strategies<br>
such as ZB and Triad Tram have also started combining LL and F2L or LL and<br>
ME (middle edge) moves.<br>
<br>
I have a sequence of strategies (L2L1 up to L2L4) the firstly fully<br>
functional (as data would say), the second over halfway worked out, the 3rd<br>
I believe is not going to work and the 4th which I have high hopes for, as<br>
described below.  But first how do they compare to Fridrich?  Generally they<br>
are a similar number of moves ranging from 57 for L2L1 to potentially 51 for<br>
L2L4.  They use much fewer algorithms - L2L1 uses only 40 in total for the<br>
whole solve the others gradually increasing, L2L4 would be around 65 - 70.<br>
L2L1 uses 7 looks the same as Fridrich, L2L2 will be 6 looks (47<br>
algorithms), in principle L2L3 would be 5 looks but I believe there would be<br>
too many algorithms as the 5th stage, L2L4 will be 5 looks.<br>
<br>
Brief descriptions:<br>
<br>
L2L1 - I have described this in posts before sometimes as the DD method:<br>
Cross + 1 FL corner (1 look),<br>
complete the other three Fl corners and Middle edges as you wish (I use a<br>
keyhole approach but using Fridrich pairs this would be 3 looks),<br>
last ME + orient adjacent LL corner + orient all LL edges (24 algorithms<br>
required)<br>
OLL - only 4 algorithms need because you only have up to 3 corners needing<br>
orientation (a 1/9 chance of being &quot;lucky&quot; here)<br>
PLL - as for Fridrich - 12 algorithms<br>
<br>
I finally broke my onehanded best time using this method - 40.44!  Still got<br>
a way to go before my averages approach the WR though.<br>
<br>
L2L2 -<br>
Cross + 2 FL corners (1 look)<br>
complete other two corners and MEs as you wish (2 looks)<br>
3rd ME and orient LL corners (27 algorithms required - i&#x27;ve worked out 26 of<br>
them!)<br>
last ME and orient LL edges (8 algorithms required - not started looking<br>
yet)<br>
PLL - as for Fridrich - 12 algorithms<br>
<br>
L2L3<br>
Cross + 3 corners (1 look!) ok this is getting tough)<br>
Complete last FL corner and one ME<br>
2nd ME and orient corners (27 algorithms)<br>
3rd ME and orient edges (6 algorithms)<br>
4th ME and PLL (way too many algorithms I think so i think L2L3 is not<br>
viable)<br>
<br>
L2L4<br>
Cross + 4 corners<br>
1st ME and orient LL corners<br>
2nd ME and place LL corners<br>
3rd ME and orient LL edges<br>
4th ME and place LL edges<br>
<br>
There are elements of L2L4 that look pretty restrictive but it is certainly<br>
going to be provable one way or the other.  Either some of the algorithms<br>
are too long or it will be a nice 5 look method within the reach of most<br>
speedcubers.<br>
<br>
We had a debate on here about FL in one look before.  Because I use the<br>
keyhole method and solve onehanded  I tend to be looking continuously -<br>
something you can&#x27;t really do twohanded I think - so maybe its going to be<br>
more practical for onehanded solves.<br>
<br>
Anyway any views or helpful algorithms would be highly appreciated.  I now<br>
have AIM under the name of onehandedcuber.<br>
<br>
Best wishes<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well my science project this year was a cube solving robot.  There were six
stepper motors with a rod into each center, which could then turn the faces.
If you could embed stepper motors in the axels, then the cube could solve
itself.  Combine this with an electronic cube, that communicates between
pieces, and you now have a self solving cube that keeps track of all its
moves.  And you would have 20 microprocessors in the cube (one in each piece
except the centers) so it should be able to at least do a simple
Thistlethwaite.  If we are really lucky, maybe the flash memory is enough,
or maybe we can put in more, so we can store the move and pruning tables
required for a fast Kociemba algorithm.  It would be a neat extension of an
electronic cube, but I think that finding stepper motors small enough, and
with enough torque, would be difficult.  If anyone does find such motors,
let me know.

          <div class="email-content">Another idea suggested to me by a non cuber is using the cube as a

a fully mechanical cube lock would be cool but i can&#x27;t see figure

          <div class="email-content">If you use a blind man&#x27;s cube, with the raised bumps it might work.  Once it
is in a pattern, you would put it into some small opening or something with
the correct orientation, and the box you put it in could detect it.  This is
kind of the same idea as with a normal key, how it moves the things to
certain heights or something like that.

 

Another idea, if the electronic cube was made that communicated from piece
to piece via LEDs on the sides of the pieces, then something could be
inserted between the two correct pieces, when the cube is in the correct
position.  This, whatever it would be that goes between the pieces, could
then sense the led signals being emitted and received.

 

And yet another idea if you want to get even crazier.  If a small wireless
transmitter could be placed inside one of the cubies, next to the 8 pin
microprocessor, then when the cube is in the correct pattern, it could emit
a wireless signal which is received by the lock, making it open.

 

Now you&#x27;ve got my mind set off on different tangents.  It would be awesome
if I could something like that to work.  Think I could win the science fair?
lol

 

That&#x27;s all for now

          <div class="email-content">sorry to be replying again

but somethign that just popped into my head.  If you did it the 
second way, where you insert something between two peices, there 
would be even more possibilities.  assuming that there arent 
microprocessors or leds in the center peices, bcause there isnt much 
room, then there would be 8 * 6 or 48 different possible places to 
insert something.  so there would be 48 times the number of possible 
positions on the cube.

And if it was done the first way, then there would be 24 different 
orientations, so 24 times the number of possible positions.

Just some random stuff i was thinking about.  But im pretty sure 
that 4.3 x 10^19 is enough combinations

Well my science project this year was a cube solving robot.  There were six
stepper motors with a rod into each center, which could then turn the faces.
If you could embed stepper motors in the axels, then the cube could solve
itself.  Combine this with an electronic cube, that communicates between
pieces, and you now have a self solving cube that keeps track of all its
moves.  And you would have 20 microprocessors in the cube (one in each piece
except the centers) so it should be able to at least do a simple
Thistlethwaite.  If we are really lucky, maybe the flash memory is enough,
or maybe we can put in more, so we can store the move and pruning tables
required for a fast Kociemba algorithm.  It would be a neat extension of an
electronic cube, but I think that finding stepper motors small enough, and
with enough torque, would be difficult.  If anyone does find such motors,
let me know.

i was actually thinking of making a cube that solves itself.... but iono how
that would work (the challenge is making it self-contained)

any ideas?

4x4&#x27;s and 5x5&#x27;s from rubiks.com are less durable and easier to <br>

          <div class="email-content">Z I can consistently do in around 2 seconds, N and E are not my 
favorites by far but they aren&#x27;t terribly slow for me either.

Here are my algs for each,

(Z): x&#x27; (RU&#x27;)(R&#x27;U)(DR&#x27;DU&#x27;)(R&#x27;UR)(D2F)
(N): (L&#x27;U)(R&#x27;U2)(LU&#x27;L&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;)U2(LU&#x27;)(RU&#x27;)
(E): y&#x27;x&#x27; (RU&#x27;R&#x27;)D(RUR&#x27;)z(L2U&#x27;)(RU)(LU&#x27;)(R&#x27;U)

for E do the (L2U&#x27;) by reaching all the way around on L and doing L 
twice clockwise then you can immediately trigger U&#x27; at the end.

E is not one of my fastest but I can get it as low as 2 seconds 
sometimes.  N is definitely not one of my fastest but not one of my 
slowest either.

Hope this helps some,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey Dave!

So buying Eastsheen is stealing from the man who invented Rubik&#x27;s 
Cube?? Well that is utter bollocks. Even buying and using Eastsheen 
cubes will indirectly promote the &quot;original&quot; rubik&#x27;s cubes. This 
whole issue is a classical example of putting matter over mind. It is 
sad that man should always think in terms of money/profit. Forget 
those copyright issues and lets carry on with cubing regardless of 
whether they are &quot;original/genuine&quot;.

If Seven Towns wanna be &quot;productive&quot; in this issue they should buy 
the manufacturer of Eastsheen and thus make it legal ;-)

Happy cubing folks :-)

Interesting.

Suppose the length of the car is L. Suppose the area u gonna park 
inside is of length W.

Now we should get time:

t=k1*k2/(W-L)

k1 is a constant which is 2.5 for women and 1.5 for men ;-)
k2 is another positive constant depending on road condition etc etc. 
As the length of the car, L,  approaches the available space, W, time 
goes towards infinity :D A funny thing happens if the car is too long 
to fit, we get negative time ... hehe :-P

Hey Dave!

So buying Eastsheen is stealing from the man who invented Rubik&#x27;s 
Cube?? Well that is utter bollocks. Even buying and using Eastsheen 
cubes will indirectly promote the &quot;original&quot; rubik&#x27;s cubes. This 
whole issue is a classical example of putting matter over mind. It is 
sad that man should always think in terms of money/profit. Forget 
those copyright issues and lets carry on with cubing regardless of 
whether they are &quot;original/genuine&quot;.

If Seven Towns wanna be &quot;productive&quot; in this issue they should buy 
the manufacturer of Eastsheen and thus make it legal ;-)

Happy cubing folks :-)

> Old records using different cubes will be honoured...

I can&#x27;t understand this decision.  My analogy is that we allow an 
athlete at the olympics to use Steroids and set new records because 
they can perform better because they&#x27;re on steroids.  Then we make 
steroids illegal and KEEP the record with the athlete on Steroids.

I fully respect David Wesley and I think his record of 2:19 for the 
5x5x5 in a competition is AMAZING and should stand.  However, not 
allowing anyone else to ever cube with an Eastsheen, and thus on a 
level playing field with David, makes no sense to me.  How can we 
allow the record with the, in my opinion far better quality cube, 
and never let anyone else use that cube again.  The record will not 
be broken for a very long time, if ever on a rubiks.com cube.

The fastest I have EVER gotten on a rubiks.com 5x5x5 is 2:23 and 
that was with everything going well and no pressure.  My fastest on 
the Eastsheen is 2:09 with several sub-2:20&#x27;s.  In my opinion it is 
a better quality cube for speedcubing.  I just can&#x27;t understand why 
we are allowing an &quot;illegal&quot; record.

Personally I think David&#x27;s record should stand and we should 
continue to be able to use Eastsheens to try to beat it on a level 
playing field.

Why can&#x27;t Rubiks buy the Eastsheen name or manufacturing rights or 
however the legalities work?  Why fight this company when their 
product is so very well made?  They&#x27;ve tried to improve on an 
earlier design and it works!  Why try to ban the cube forever?

I cannot agree with allowing the record to stand when noone else 
will ever be able to use and Eastsheen and try to beat it UNDER THE 
SAME CONDITIONS IT WAS SET ever again.  I&#x27;m using the caps for 
emphasis, not as internet &quot;yelling&quot;.

I&#x27;m sorry to take this public but I don&#x27;t see the reasoning in this 
decision at all.

    &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; is a trademark of Seven Towns Limited. Erno Rubik<br>

    out international patents. (Ideal was somewhat reluctant to produce<br>
    the toy for that reason, and indeed clones appeared almost<br>
    immediately.) Terutoshi Ishigi acquired Japanese patent #55-8192 for<br>
    a nearly identical mechanism while Rubik&#x27;s patent was being<br>

    reinvention.<br>

    Interestingly, the legal defense of the Cube was never based on the<br>
    original patent that applied to Hungary only. It was the &quot;Rubik&quot;<br>
    trademark, Erno Rubik&#x27;s copyright in the object itself and the<br>

This is my stance on this issue.  We either strike the 2:19 record 
because it was done with an unfair advantage or...

This is technically less moral... we find people who can solve the 
5x5x5 really fast, give them lots of opportunities to break 2:19, and 
hope one of them does.

If this record stands for a long time, we&#x27;ve got a problem.

Hi Dave,

   Actually the 2x2x2 was invented by Larry Nichols, long before the
3x3x3 was invented. I think Eastsheen 2x2x2 should be allowed.

  According to what I&#x27;ve been able to find out, alhough I haven&#x27;t had
it confirmed, Rubik wasn&#x27;t even the first to invent the 3x3x3, as a
patent was applied for in the UK by a man named Frank Fox in 1970. 

   And  man in Japan named Terutoshi Ishige arrived at a 3x3x3
independently from, and around the same time as Erno Rubik did.

   And Eastsheen holds patents for 2x2x2 4x4x4 and 5x5x5.

   I&#x27;m all for protecting patents, and respecting inventors but lets
keep our facts straight.

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s some points I want to make, and please keep in mind that I&#x27;m 
not trying to sound harsh, it&#x27;s just my opinion.

1. If we start throwing out records that were set with non-Rubik&#x27;s 
brand cubes, does that mean we have to throw out the Megaminx 
records, Pyraminx records, etc.?  Rubik&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t even make these 
products, so will they not be allowed in future &quot;Rubik&#x27;s 
competitions&quot;?  If that is being implyed, I think that is absolutely 
outrageous.

2. I understand that Rubik&#x27;s is trying to get the money/publicity 
they deserve.  However, if you show a cube to someone, regardless of 
brand, they will recognize it as a &quot;Rubik&#x27;s cube&quot;.  If this person 
sees it, then proceeds to buy one, I can almost guaruntee that they 
will try to find the Rubik&#x27;s brand first.  I think the publicity is 
already there, and there is no need to force the Rubik&#x27;s brand upon 
us.

3. In essence, by only allowing Rubik&#x27;s brand in competition, that is 
a monopoly.  I understand that formally this is untrue, but that is 
what it seems like to me.  A product is being forced, even if someone 
else makes that product &quot;better&quot;.  Competition is why products are 
improved.  If the entire cube community agrees that a different brand 
is better, don&#x27;t fight it, or you will just lose sales.  Instead, 
take the time to improve your own product (for instance, I love the 
new Rubik&#x27;s stickers, they are much better).

4. Telling cubers what equipment to use is like telling them what 
method they can use in competition.  If that sounds stupid, it&#x27;s 
because it is.

To summarize, I disagree with the rule of not allowing other brands.  
Competitors should be allowed to use whatever equipment they prefer 
(within reason, I mean different brands, not drastically modified 
equipment).

Sorry to be pedantic, but your facts are a little &quot;skewed&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you look carefully you will see Rubik&#x27;s company owned a patent on <br>
a 4x4x4 cube in 1983, whereas 2x2x2 and 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 from <br>
Eastsheen are patents from the late 1990&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
Why is this ? Well Eastsheen haven&#x27;t patented the cube(s), they&#x27;ve <br>
patented their own mechanisms for constructing cubes.<br>
<br>
You are right that there is a good selection of prior art for 3x3x3 <br>
and 2x2x2 mechanisms before Rubik, however, what Rubik really did -  <br>
(to the best of my understanding of patent law IANAL) is take this <br>
mechanism and turn it into a workable toy - along with his various  <br>
(manufacturing) partners at the time.<br>
<br>
If you look back through the threads on this, you&#x27;ll see that the <br>
cube hasn&#x27;t been defended by patents - its been defended by <br>
trademarks and copyright - and there&#x27;s the rub, Rubik and the toy <br>
companies at the time created a worldwide brand, through extensive <br>
investment in manufacturing and advertising and opportunistic <br>
companies have traded off this.<br>

   Not really. There are other details but it wasn&#x27;t necessary to
point them out.

   Yes, I saw that. What I wrote doesn&#x27;t contradict this. However,
Rubik was allowed to patent a 2x2x2 mecahnism even though Larry
Nichols patented the 2x2x2 years before. My point here is that
Eastsheen patents are recongnized on the same basis as Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2
patent. If Rubik is recognized for a patent for his mechanism, then
Eastsheen should be recognized equally.
 
> Why is this ? Well Eastsheen haven&#x27;t patented the cube(s), they&#x27;ve

   Same as Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2. This whole issue started with the Eastsheen
2x2x2 being excluded from the US national this coming July. Nichols
has precedence for the movement.

   Nichols had a workable toy. But that wasn&#x27;t what was argued, was it?

   But that is a good reason for allowing good quality 2x2x2s and
4x4x4s and 5x5x5s because Rubik automatically gets the publicity. I
bought two different Rubik&#x27;s brand 2x2x2s and they are both painful to
turn, and useless. 

   Again, the claims that Rubik was the first with a 2x2x2, a 3x3x3,
and even with the idea of that type of rotatable toy which holds
itself together, aren&#x27;t true.

   The fact is that the 3x3x3 is known worldwide as a &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;
and I think that if Seven Towns quality is the best they&#x27;ll get the
majority of sales.

          <div class="email-content">Hey DHJ and others- You analogy does not seem to fit(and you admit 
this to some extent). Sticking a Honda logo on a BMW is wrong but 
that is not what East Sheen is doing. In your analogy the two cars 
are the same. East Sheen cubes have an entirely different mechanism 
than Rubik&#x27;s and it therefore requires a seperate patent. In my 
opinion patenting the cube is like patenting the car. One company 
does not own the rights to all cars but they can patent the way 
their particular car works. Having more than one cube company 
creates healthy competion and the motivation to improve their 
products which benefits us speedcubers. All sorts of cubes should be 
allowed in competitions that are not necessarily sponsored by 
Rubik&#x27;s. Maybe the WRCA should be called the WCA? Nothing against 
Rubik&#x27;s though. I still wouldn&#x27;t mind events sponsored by Rubik&#x27;s.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brent,

   My favorites depend on how I developed them, for example:
   For Z I use a 7 move alg, and I usually do it on top instead of in
front (small case letter are slices). r2 D&#x27; f2 D f&#x27; r2 f is one of my
favorites. Another favorite involved replacing r2 U2 r2 U r2 U2 r2 U&#x27;
with r2 U r2 U2 r2 U r2. Logically developing all three was very
interesting, and I enjoyed it. On a good day they take 2 or 3 seconds.

   My alg for E is a reflection of yours, and developing it was
particularly interesting. I am not yet satified with my alg for N:
F&#x27;L2 U B2 U&#x27; B&#x27; U B2 D&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27; D L2 F.

Fewest Moves Challenge #50 is here, and this time it has a twist. I urge you to give it a go!<br>
<br>
Instead of the usual &quot;lowest move count&quot; wins contest, this week the winner will be determined on a time factor as well!<br>
<br>
Time how long it takes you to come up with as short a solution as you can, and enter this somewhere in your quote on the FMC submission form when you enter. The winner will be decided by the lowest combined score, where 1 move counts as 1 point, and 3 minutes counts as 1 point. Be tactical, and please be honest!<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s make FMC #50 a fun one to remember, and also let&#x27;s see if it potentially could become a way of making FMC competitions more appealing to the real world competitive scene!<br>

Good Luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi folks,  I have some information which may be of interest.

&quot;Apr   9, 1970     Frank Fox applies for UK patent for spherical 3x3x3&quot;

Frank Fox was earlier than Nichols for his _spherical_ 3x3x3. 
Larry Nichol&#x27;s &#x27;Twizzle&#x27; was the first cubical 2x2x2 as far as I 
know.

Obviously other people than Erno Rubik have invented twisty
puzzles, but I think you&#x27;ll find that marketing won in the end.
Rubik&#x27;s Cube had it all, the best design, the best manufacturing
and the best marketing. I have no doubt that Erno Rubik&#x27;s
design was independent of all other designs.

If you are going to mention Frank Fox and Larry Nichols it&#x27;s
only fair to mention:

&quot;Feb   2, 1960     William Gustafson files patent for Manipulatable Toy&quot;

So Gustafson had the earliest know patent, but it was not cube
shaped but spherical. Who knows, maybe there is even someone
before Gustafson.

Speaking personally, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any wrong with someone
coming up with a new idea similar to the cube and patenting it.
But I think you&#x27;ll find that even Rubik&#x27;s Cube went through several
iterations of improvements before Ideal Toy made that historical
order for one million cubes. They did a good job on the manufacturing,
and I don&#x27;t think we would have seen cube contests if the cubes
were hard to turn or they fell apart too easily.

I do _not_ think that the Eastsheen cubes will hurt the sales
of Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. My experience tells me that most puzzle
aficionados will buy both. Also I think that most people know
the term &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;. 

Sevens Towns has been fairly tolerant of the &quot;fringe cubes&quot;
which I&#x27;m sure most cubists will appreciate. I&#x27;m sure the
world&#x27;s cubists will keep buying Rubik&#x27;s products. I don&#x27;t see
why their can&#x27;t be different sizes of cubes but there should be
clear rules saying &quot;this range of sizes are allowed&quot; etc etc.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm while all these idea&#x27;s are good as far as computing, The 
technology just isn&#x27;t there yet.


What IS possible would be to make a cube with a small button battery 
and a single led(white) and have each cube contain that along with a 
colored translucent plate that will give off colored light.

If each cube is self contained with just a battery and a light it 
should be simple enough to manufacture....


The hard part would be turning them on off, since each piece would 
have to be self contained with no wires, ect....


How about this? some sort of magnetic switch that is static(it won&#x27;t 
change when not in a magnetic field).


You could turn on each button by passing a magnet over it, attraction 
to turn it on, repulsion to turn it off.

In fact, IIRC there are some pretty small devices that charge 
batteries by induction, IE you could lay this into a holder and each 
battery could be charged by a magnetic/electric field generated by 
the charger, which would increase the life of the thing.


I know magnetic switches like that work as I use one in a routine
(magic) that I perform, but i don&#x27;t think its small enough to fit 
inside a small piece.... perhaps it could be made smaller.



-Erik

PS also while on the topic of self-solving cubes and magic, it should 
intrest some of you guys to know there are two magic tricks put out
(kinda hard to find), one that is a regular sized cube that you can 
throw out to people and have them mix it up, and then you take the 
cube back and throw it in the air, when it comes back down it&#x27;s solved
(and examinable).

Also there is a mini-cube that you can have people mix up, then put 
it in your mouth, and it comes out solved.

These are both great items that every cuber should have imho.... 
nothing like doing it in 30-40 seconds, and then saying you could do 
it in 5 seconds... then use the cube from the trick and have it solve 
itself in mid air....

I would love to see some complete algorithm lists for your systems, f.i. for

          <div class="email-content">This has certainly been the hot topic of discussion recently, so I 
thought I&#x27;d throw in a few thoughts too. These comments are just 
about my personal experience with the different cubes, so feel free 
to disagree.

I find the Rubik&#x27;s brand 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 very heavy and clunky. So 
much so, that I find them quite uncomfortable to use and a strain on 
my hands. As such, I don&#x27;t use them because I find them a health 
hazard for myself (don&#x27;t want to get RSI from cubing!). The 
Eastsheen 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are much lighter and more delicate and 
significantly more comfortable for me to cube with.

If the Eastsheen 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are banned from competition, this 
leads to me with two alternatives:
(i) I don&#x27;t compete in those events, or
(ii) I do all my practice on Eastsheens and then use a Rubik&#x27;s brand 
cube for the actual competition. This basically means I&#x27;d be 
competing with a foreign cube that I wasn&#x27;t used to and so would 
never achieve my best times.

Obviously this is quite a personal thing (I&#x27;ll follow the 
competition rules, whatever they may be), and I&#x27;m sure other people 
have different cube preferences.

Just wanted to add my 2 cents,

Jasmine.

I am hoping, over the summer, to put a site up that will include all my
methods to date with some explanations, comparisons and definitely the
algorithms.

I have an earlier version of L2L1 and my current version of L2L1 all ready
for posting and I ecpect to have L2L2 by then.

I will be working hard on L2L4 once I get L2L2 completed and will include it
asap.

          <div class="email-content">I would agree with you on the technology as far as the stepper motors.  But
I know of 8 pin micro processors that are very small, especially the mounted
ones.  This, along with a small battery, and small LEDs and small light
sensors of some type could probably fit within each cubie, except the center
ones.  And if some type of LED or LCD is found that can be one of 6 colors,
and is relatively cheap, then I think the idea is possible.

 

Please keep up the constructive criticism and ideas though.  I&#x27;d rather know
of problems before starting one, than figure them out along the way.

Hmm while all these idea&#x27;s are good as far as computing, The 
technology just isn&#x27;t there yet.


What IS possible would be to make a cube with a small button battery 
and a single led(white) and have each cube contain that along with a 
colored translucent plate that will give off colored light.

If each cube is self contained with just a battery and a light it 
should be simple enough to manufacture....


The hard part would be turning them on off, since each piece would 
have to be self contained with no wires, ect....


How about this? some sort of magnetic switch that is static(it won&#x27;t 
change when not in a magnetic field).


You could turn on each button by passing a magnet over it, attraction 
to turn it on, repulsion to turn it off.

In fact, IIRC there are some pretty small devices that charge 
batteries by induction, IE you could lay this into a holder and each 
battery could be charged by a magnetic/electric field generated by 
the charger, which would increase the life of the thing.


I know magnetic switches like that work as I use one in a routine
(magic) that I perform, but i don&#x27;t think its small enough to fit 
inside a small piece.... perhaps it could be made smaller.

PS also while on the topic of self-solving cubes and magic, it should 
intrest some of you guys to know there are two magic tricks put out
(kinda hard to find), one that is a regular sized cube that you can 
throw out to people and have them mix it up, and then you take the 
cube back and throw it in the air, when it comes back down it&#x27;s solved
(and examinable).

Also there is a mini-cube that you can have people mix up, then put 
it in your mouth, and it comes out solved.

These are both great items that every cuber should have imho.... 
nothing like doing it in 30-40 seconds, and then saying you could do 
it in 5 seconds... then use the cube from the trick and have it solve 
itself in mid air....

although i dont have any eastsheen cubes, i do find the rubiks brand to be a bit heavy and straining on my hands. i can only do the 5x5x5 once a day because its so straining. this might be because i have smaller hands, but still, a lighter cube could save me from more cases of tendonitis, which i have almost gotten 3 times. this may be something seventowns or rubiks or whoever makes the cubes would want to look into.

I find the Rubik&#x27;s brand 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 very heavy and clunky. So 
much so, that I find them quite uncomfortable to use and a strain on 
my hands. As such, I don&#x27;t use them because I find them a health 
hazard for myself (don&#x27;t want to get RSI from cubing!). The 
Eastsheen 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are much lighter and more delicate and 
significantly more comfortable for me to cube with.

If the Eastsheen 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are banned from competition, this 
leads to me with two alternatives:
(i) I don&#x27;t compete in those events, or
(ii) I do all my practice on Eastsheens and then use a Rubik&#x27;s brand 
cube for the actual competition. This basically means I&#x27;d be 
competing with a foreign cube that I wasn&#x27;t used to and so would 
never achieve my best times.

Obviously this is quite a personal thing (I&#x27;ll follow the 
competition rules, whatever they may be), and I&#x27;m sure other people 
have different cube preferences.

Just wanted to add my 2 cents,

Jasmine.

I get mine from NAPA auto parts.  It&#x27;s a red can That reads &quot;NAPA CRC 
Heavy Duty Silicone Multi-Use Lubricant&quot;  I&#x27;ve tried a couple other 
kinds, but I always go back to this stuff.

Hi Lou,

   Try:

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mark,

   Nice to see you post on this subject.

   Yes it&#x27;s fair to mention Gustafson. The problem is that in two
cases we don&#x27;t know when the items were designed.

   Gustafson was issued U.S. patent No. 3,081,089 on March 12, 1963.
You found that he applied in 1960. Frank Fox applied in 1970. I don&#x27;t
know when or if he got a patent. Larry D. Nichols was issued U.S.
patent 3655201 on April 11, 1972, but he designed it in 1957,
predating even a 1958 mention I found regarding Gustafson.

   Of further interest: from http://www.patents.com/plaw/moleculon.htm

> A puzzle enthusiast since childhood, Nichols, in the summer of 1957,
conceived of a three-dimensional puzzle capable of rotational
movement. He envisioned an assembly of eight cubes attached in a 2x2x2
arrangement, with each of the six faces of the composite cube
distinguished by a different color and the individual cubes being
capable of rotation in sets of four around one of three mutually
perpendicular axes. &lt;

   This is interesting considering that Rubik&#x27;s prototype wasn&#x27;t even
a cube, having truncated triangular corners, and from what I
understand it was a while before the idea of six colors was settled
upon, the prototype having different shapes as well as colors to
differentiate the sides, and the triangular corners posing a problem.

   Anyway, that page http://www.patents.com/plaw/moleculon.htm
continued, 

>  What the court said was that while it would have been obvious to
consider changing Gustafson&#x27;s sphere into a cube or other geometric
shape, one of ordinary skill in the art would not have recognized the
desirability of a subdivided cube capable of tri-axial rotation. The
court relied on expert testimony to the effect that Nichols&#x27; concept
was a breakthrough and represented &quot;a quantum leap from a sphere.&quot; The
court noted in addition that Gustafson himself considered other solids
which would offer more complexity than the sphere and in his search
&quot;dismissed the cube as offering only six faces ... &lt;

   I agree that there may well have been someone earlier who designed
such a thing. We may never know, but the earliest mention that I can
find is still Nichols.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure this has already been done, and it&#x27;s not that hard of a <br>
calculation, but I don&#x27;t think I had ever seen anyone do it on the <br>
group.<br>
<br>
I was just working out the probability of a lucky LL and here is <br>
what I came up with.<br>
<br>
After solving the F2L there are 8*27 = 216 orientations of the <br>
pieces disregarding their positions.  So there&#x27;s a 1/216 chance of <br>
getting a lucky OLL.<br>
<br>
After all the pieces are oriented there are 4!*4*3 = 288 positions <br>
they can be in.  4 of these are the solved state where all pieces <br>
are fitted together correctly, and may or may not be 1 turn away <br>
from the whole cube being solved.  So there&#x27;s a 1/72 chance of <br>
getting a lucky PLL, where you may have to do 1 more turn to solve <br>
the cube.<br>
<br>
There are 4!*4*3*8*27=62208 total LL cases, 4 of which are solved, <br>
again with possibly one more turn needing to be done to solve the <br>
cube.  So there&#x27;s a 1/15552 chance of getting a lucky completely <br>
solved LL after the F2L, with possibly one more turn needed to align <br>
the LL face with the rest of the cube.<br>
<br>
So in total the chance of getting any of the lucky LL cases is<br>
<br>
71/(72*216) + 215/(72*216) + 1/(72*216) = 287/15552 ~ 1.845% chance<br>
<br>
So 1 in every 54 or 55 solves roughly should be one of the 3 types <br>
of lucky cases, either no OLL, no PLL, or no OLL and no PLL.<br>
<br>
Not sure if anyone was interested in that, but I felt like ranting <br>
lol.<br>
<br>
Later all,<br>
Chris<br>

          <div class="email-content">One more thing,<br>
<br>
I remember posts earlier about the difference between the chance of <br>
getting an average with a lucky time counting in a competition.  We <br>
were debating this for 5 cube averages and 12 cube averages.<br>
<br>
Here are the exact probabilities,<br>
<br>
5 cube averages, remove fastest and slowest - average middle 3:<br>
<br>
If you get 1 lucky solve, it will be thrown out since it will most <br>
likely be your fastest solve.  So the probability of getting 2 or <br>
more lucky solves is,<br>
<br>
10*(287/15552)^2*(15265/15552)^3+10*(287/15552)^3*(15265/15552)^2+5*<br>
(287/15552)^4*(15265/15552)+(287/15552)^6<br>
<br>
which has an approximately 0.328% likelihood of happening.<br>
<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
12 cube averages, remove fastest and slowest average middle 10:<br>
<br>
Again getting 1 lucky solve will throw out that time because it will <br>
most likely be your fastest time.  Below is the probability of <br>
getting 2 or more lucky solves,<br>
<br>
66*(287/15552)^2*(15265/15552)^10+220*(287/15552)^3*(15265/15552)<br>
^9+495*(287/15552)^4*(15265/15552)^8+792*(287/15552)^5*(15265/15552)<br>
^6+924*(287/15552)^6*(15265/15552)^6+792*(287/15552)^7*(15265/15552)<br>
^5+495*(287/15552)^8*(15265/15552)^4+220*(287/15552)^9*(15265/15552)<br>
^3+66*(287/15552)^10*(15265/15552)^2+12*(287/15552)^11*(15265/15552)+<br>
(287/15552)^12<br>
<br>
which is an approximately 1.9877% chance of getting two or more <br>
lucky solves during the average.<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
So it is actually less likely to get 2 lucky solves, and hence one <br>
of them count in the average, for an average of 5 than an average of <br>
12.  So it is actually better to do averages of 5 in competition as <br>
they make it less likely to get a lucky average where you get more <br>
than 1 lucky time.<br>
<br>
Intuitively I was kind of surprised by this, but I checked the math <br>
and it works out.  I guess it&#x27;s because in an average of 12 you do <br>
more solves and are thus more likely to get lucky since you have <br>
more chances to.<br>
<br>
Here are more numbers to make this easier to digest.  If we did an <br>
average of 3 (discard best and worst) you have a<br>
<br>
3*(287/15552)^2*(15265/15552)+(287/15552)^3 = 0.101% chance of <br>
getting two or more lucky solves.<br>
<br>
An average of 4 would give you a 0.1993% chance of getting two or <br>
more lucky solves.<br>
<br>
I wrote a program on my calculator to do this for large numbers of <br>
solves.  If you do 100 solves, you have a 55.28% chance of getting 2 <br>
or more lucky solves.<br>

<br>
So in short averages of 5 are better for competitions than averages <br>
of 12 in terms of making it less likely to get a lucky average.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Sorry for the repeat post but there&#x27;s a typo in the math I wrote for 
the probability of the getting two or more lucky solves in the 12 
cube average.  I did the math correctly on my calculator, but did a 
typo when writing it up on the page.  If you&#x27;re following the math 
you&#x27;ll probably catch it, if not don&#x27;t worry about it.  The final 
result is still correct.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

Now make some calculations for:
= probability of making a mistake in an average run (more cubes => higher
chance)
= concentration factor (more cubes => harder to stay concentrated)
= probability of having a complete set of good times (more cubes => smaller
chance)

Maybe you could look a bit more at standard deviations and having an average
run that is far better/worse than your normal ability? :-)

In the end it all comes down to finding a good enough competition format (to
exclude too much luck or bad luck), that is also practical (available time,
audience/media appealing).

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
OK, we have seen many method suggestions recently.<br>
Here is another one:<br>
<br>
1) orient all edges (easy to be prepared during preinspection)<br>
2) middle layer edges in middle layer (not using single F and B moves<br>
anymore...)<br>
3a) orient top layer corners (start with the layer with the most corners not<br>
oriented)<br>
3b) orient bottom layer corners (may need set up moves if total orientation<br>
after 3a is not 0)<br>
4) solve top layer edges (making a cross)<br>
5) solve top layer edges and middle layer edges<br>
6) corners into their layers<br>
7) solve corners in 1 or 2 steps<br>
<br>
It is possible to combine 3a and 3b, especially if you would do some set up<br>
moves first.<br>
You could also change the order of the steps a bit. I need to do some more<br>
thinking obviously...<br>

Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">-you scream when someone suggests peeling off the stickers

- your biggest fear is having your cube pop while on a roller coaster

- You sing your cube to sleep

-You name your cube

- you try and formulate an algorithm to solve a tiled floor

- you dream new algorithms in your sleep

- you make your own cube themed t shirts

- when fellow workers/college classmates go for their nicotine fix,   
you go and get your cube &quot;fix&quot;

- You take your cube swimming on hot summer days (underwater cubing)

- your math teacher looks for you for help

- When all your projects for every subject at school are cube related

- Keep a photo of your favorite cube in your wallet

I&#x27;m sure i can think up of more....

Yeah, I should do that. I already do carry cube business cards with <br>
me (they show a cube, my name, my email and links to my cube website <br>
and speedcubing.com). Here&#x27;s another one:<br>
<br>
- ... your girlfriend leaves you because you cube too much (ok, <br>
there were other reasons as well).<br>
<br>
- ... your friends get sick of you when you even mention the <br>
word &quot;cube&quot;.<br>
<br>
- ... your friends tell others to shut up when they accidentally <br>
say &quot;cube&quot; and you&#x27;re around, then looking suspiciously hoping that <br>
you haven&#x27;t heard it.<br>

Can someone calculate the probablity of getting

Hey everyone,

I&#x27;m sure this has already been done, and it&#x27;s not that hard of a 
calculation, but I don&#x27;t think I had ever seen anyone do it on the 
group.

I was just working out the probability of a lucky LL and here is 
what I came up with.

After solving the F2L there are 8*27 = 216 orientations of the 
pieces disregarding their positions.  So there&#x27;s a 1/216 chance of 
getting a lucky OLL.

After all the pieces are oriented there are 4!*4*3 = 288 positions 
they can be in.  4 of these are the solved state where all pieces 
are fitted together correctly, and may or may not be 1 turn away 
from the whole cube being solved.  So there&#x27;s a 1/72 chance of 
getting a lucky PLL, where you may have to do 1 more turn to solve 
the cube.

There are 4!*4*3*8*27=62208 total LL cases, 4 of which are solved, 
again with possibly one more turn needing to be done to solve the 
cube.  So there&#x27;s a 1/15552 chance of getting a lucky completely 
solved LL after the F2L, with possibly one more turn needed to align 
the LL face with the rest of the cube.

So in total the chance of getting any of the lucky LL cases is

71/(72*216) + 215/(72*216) + 1/(72*216) = 287/15552 ~ 1.845% chance

So 1 in every 54 or 55 solves roughly should be one of the 3 types 
of lucky cases, either no OLL, no PLL, or no OLL and no PLL.

Not sure if anyone was interested in that, but I felt like ranting 
lol.

Later all,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey Brent, I think there are 

16*3!*9*2 - 6*4*3 + 4 = 1660 positions with any 2x2x1 built and in 
any of its 4 positions positions, with the rest of the pieces in any 
of their possible positions.  There are 62208 total LL positions, so 
the probability should be 415/15552 or 2.67%

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">If anyone is interested the odds of getting a correct 2x2x1 in the 
LL afer solving the F2L are a lot better if you orient the LL edges 
while placing the last F2L pair.

If all edges are oriented there are

16*3!*9 - 6*4*9 + 4 = 652 positions out of 7776 total last layer 
positions with all edge oriented correctly.

So that&#x27;s 163/1944 = 8.38% chance of getting a correct 2x2x1 after 
solving the last F2L pair and orienting the LL edges at the same 
time.

So for those of you who orient the LL edges while solving the last 
F2L pair, about 1 in 12 times you could solve the LL in one look if 
you learned all the 2x2x1 algs with all edges oriented.  I don&#x27;t 
know how many of those there are, but maybe it is worth it?

my two cents,

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,<br>
Interesting calculations and respect for that work. But there maybe a <br>
slight misinterpretaion of statistics: Allthough one event may have a <br>
low probability for a single cuber it can have a very high <br>
probability for many cubers. And also a low probability does not say <br>
that an event is impossible. Compare it to lottery. So if we wait <br>
long enough and if there are enough good speedcubers the world record <br>
will consist only of lucky cases! 5 of 5! Good luck to everyone, but <br>
Chris-hey please don&#x27;t calculate that! lol<br>
Furthermore luck on F2L (without a real &quot;lucky case&quot;) can save more <br>
time than to jump an easy OLL, for this is my experience.<br>

You may be cubing to much if:<br>
<br>

your cube&#x27;s lubrication<br>
...you try to understand words in the sounds your cube makes while <br>
turning<br>
... you failed to get out of the train at the desired station, once <br>
again and due to cubing<br>
...you need a cube &quot;after it&quot;<br>
...you try to express your emotions with different scrambles<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everyone, I&#x27;m new to the group (and to cubing, been cubing for 1 
month, hovering around 1:15 solve times using a corner first method, 
woot!), but I couldn&#x27;t resist adding a few opinions to this thread.

This kind of thing is highly possible, with today&#x27;s technology, but 
not easy to do. 

There are definitely 6 color LED&#x27;s available today, and they&#x27;re not 
highly expensive.

You would definitely have to have a microprocessor in each face, 
though. That might get a small bit complicated, but there are chips 
small enough to handle it.

A self solving one, though, I think is beyond our abilities (or if 
it&#x27;s not, would be extremely expensive, in the &quot;Government&#x27;s bright 
ideas that cost too much&quot; category)

Four major problems arise from this kind of idea, however, I&#x27;ll 
address them in my opinion of their order of difficulty (excluding 
#4)

First, power. 

How will you deliver power to each Light, to each processor, without 
wires? (Doing this with wires would make it pointless, pop one 
cubie, and the whole cube is broken, permanently for most people) 
Limited Touch power solutions are the best solution at hand, from my 
perspective. For those who don&#x27;t know what I mean, this means you 
would have two &quot;graphite&quot; (or another conductive material) strips 
that would meet up with a positive and a negative power track strip 
that is housed in, on, or around the frame. This would have to be 
almost perfectly manufactured, (i.e. less than .1% deviation).

Second, communication.

Housing a microprocessor in each cubie to handle what color each 
panel is will be fine, but you need a slightly larger chip (easily 
housed in the frame or in a center piece) to handle the &quot;self 
scrambling&quot; theorem. From there, you have to manage Communication 
between the main &quot;processor&quot; and all the small processors in each 
cubie.

There are processors that are more than small enough to fit and as 
powerful as a 386 is to handle the self scrambling idea. It wouldn&#x27;t 
take much, either. But you&#x27;re still left with the main processor 
telling each cubie what colors to be. A wireless solution, either 
radio or higher frequency, with a 3 inch range and each 
microprocessor able to receive them, would be great, but here&#x27;s your 
catch. Each chip has to be identified by the main processor, or at 
least each signal sent out has to be identified by ONE chip, and not 
ALL chips. This wouldn&#x27;t be too complicated, but is why you would 
want to use a processor as powerful as a 386 and not just the 
Smallest you can get. Now you need at least a 32mb flash chip (not 
even remotely a problem size or power wise, just a small 32mb 
eeprom).

Programming wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal (I couldn&#x27;t do it, but I&#x27;m sure I 
know a couple of people who can/could).

Third, manufacturing.

For this to be feasible (and to last more than a week), certain 
precautions in constructing the item have to be made, especially 
considering lubricant would be a bad idea, unless it&#x27;s conductive.

You have to have it built almost perfect, seeing as it has to be 
powered at all times, in any position, turned or not. You&#x27;re also 
going to have to worry about cube popping (from a design standpoint) 
and how it will affect things.

Fourth, Shock Prevention.

Any drop, or a bad finger-trick, can cause considerable Shock to any 
given cube. The processors, LED lights, and power conveyance system 
is going to have to be able to handle that kind of shock, and the 
occasional cube pop as well. From here, you&#x27;re going to have to use 
a higher quality high-impact plastic, OR a light high-impact metal. 
Plastic would be better, as you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about 
insulation.

Putting the processor &amp; memory in one center panel and the proper 
batteries in another would be the best solution. Of the remaining 
center panels, I would recommend 2 to be buttons, and a 3rd to be a 
control button

The first would turn the cube &quot;on&quot; (main processor &quot;boot,&quot; send a 
solved state to each microprocessor, and turn the main processor off 
again, leaving the LEDs in a solved state)

The second would turn the main processor on, produce an algorithm to 
scramble, send the resulting color combinations to each 
microprocessor, and turn off the main processor again. 

The third would be a Hard Press button, meaning you REALLY have to 
press into it for it to activate, and the other two buttons wouldn&#x27;t 
work unless THAT button was activated as well. This would prevent 
turning the cube off Mid-Solve, or scrambling Mid-Solve.

Assuming you wanted to put it in there, you could put a smaller 
(2kb) flash eeprom that would save the state of the cube, with the 
press of the fourth center panel not mentioned previously, and when 
the cube is turned on, it loads it&#x27;s position from there (i.e. only 
a solved state if you LEFT it in a solved state).

These are just my ideas, I&#x27;m not positive on all of them, and I&#x27;m 
thinking there&#x27;s a fully &quot;wireless&quot; power solution to be had, but I 
can&#x27;t put my finger on it. 

Two little things more...

Is this a nighttime / dark room only cube? If not, your LED cost 
goes from about 80 cents a piece to about $4.00 a piece, not to 
mention your power consumption goes up a little bit. 

Making a cube that simply lights up would be simplicity itself, 
really, and would be fairly easy to manufacture, minus the power 
supply to each cube.

          <div class="email-content">Oh yeah, one other thing....

Most of the multicolor LED&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been able to find are self-
alternating (meaning the current makes them change color, not by any 
control method). If they do Not make multicolor LEDs, a simple 
solution would be an LED panel, with your 6 LEDs, capped by a 
translucent &amp; reflective glass or plastic material. 

Sorry, this whole thing got me thinking. =)

          <div class="email-content">It sounds like everyone is tired of these math posts, but I made an 
error in the math on my last post and I&#x27;m a stickler for these sort 
of things.  For the sake of correctness, I&#x27;ll post this once more 
and I promise this is my last post about this.

The correction is for the probability of getting at least one 
correctly formed 2x2x1 in the LL after inserting the last c/e pair 
and also orienting all the LL edges correctly.  It actually has 
better odds than I previously thought.

# of positions with at least one correctly formed 2x2x1 (a correct 
3x2x1 or two 2x2x1&#x27;s diagonally opposite eachother would each count 
as 1 position having at least one 2x2x1 formed).

16*6*9 - 6*4*3 + 4 = 796 positions with at least one 2x2x1 formed

There are 7776 total LL positions if all the edges are oriented 
correctly, so the probability of getting a correct 2x2x1 after the 
F2L and orienting all the LL edges should be about 10.24% or 
approximately 1 out of every 10 cubes.

try http://www.lar5.com/cube/fas3.html (and/or just
lar5.com/cube). As you will notice, Petrus orients
edges after 2 pairs instead of 3 which makes it
easier/faster, but only works if the pairs are
adjacent. I guess it&#x27;s a matter of taste.

The method I&#x27;m investigating now includes building a
2x2x1 block before the actual last layer comes about.

   For me :) (E) is done in under 2.5 somewhat
consistently.  The others are under 3 seconds, but I&#x27;m
not sure how much more under.  I hold it differently
than chris however.
   
(E) x&#x27;(RU&#x27;R&#x27;)(D)(RUR&#x27;)(UE)2)(R&#x27;U)(RDR&#x27;U&#x27;R)
       
    x&#x27;(RU&#x27;R&#x27;)this is a simple trigger.  Followed by a
D turn.  I make this turn with a flick of my left ring
finger.  (RUR&#x27;) is another simple trigger. (UE)2)This
is turning the top two layers twice.  Make sure to
position your hand *while turning* in such a way that
the (R&#x27;U) follows smoothly.  This is odd at first, but
it really makes things easier.  The last trigger looks
tough, but it&#x27;s really not that bad. When getting
ready for the RD turn, position your middle finger on
the BRU corner, and thumb on the BRD corner.  Make the
RD turn, and the R&#x27;U&#x27;R should follow naturally.  I
hope this wasn&#x27;t too confusing for anyone.  I just
like this situation is all.

BTW, I have broken 2 seconds with this alg many times.

          <div class="email-content">I was not able to check the forum for a while, and
this issue came upon us.  I&#x27;ve read every argument
posted, every opinion posted, every thought posted. 
We will not find a &#x27;right&#x27; answer, mainly because
there is not one.  I find myself skeptical of Seven
Town&#x27;s motivation for banning Eastsheen from
tournaments.  It should bring into question corporate
concern for quality, as it is obvious eastsheen is
built better for the &#x27;speedcubing&#x27; community.  

I noticed just how far Rubik&#x27;s would go (last august).
 For RWC 03&#x27;: at some point there was a fight for
color scheme.  We were actually in danger at one point
of forfeiting familiar color schemes, for the sake of
retaining a Rubik&#x27;s color scheme.  Thankfully enough
we won this battle.  Of course this tournament was
called the Rubik&#x27;s world championship, but was it
truly nececcesary(sp?) to force us to put a logo
sticker on our cube?  It wasn&#x27;t terribly distracting
or anything, but come&#x27;on! Must we label everything?  

Should old records stay? Of course!  Anyone who put
this to question should feel shameful.  We are not
setting records that represent brands, we are setting
records that represent puzzles.  There are records for
the 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5.  Whether or not these
cubical puzzles are rubiks...I care not.  If Rubik&#x27;s
wants business, don&#x27;t try snuffing out the smaller
companies with gimmicks that suggest foul play and
selfish alterior motives!  Make better products!  Who
cares about the brand, we do this for the puzzle.  We
do this for the challenge.  When we run somewhere, we
feel good because we arrived at our destination, not
because our shoes were the right brand.  I suggest
that we have tournaments that involve all brands. 
Instead of having a monopolized Rubik&#x27;s World
Championship, why not have a Puzzling World
Championship, or Puzzle Olympics, where emphasis is
not put on brand alone, but quality overall.  There
are many puzzles that were neglected at RWC, that are
respected among the cubing community.  Notice the
skewb was not included last year!  Pyraminx solvers
only got one shot to prove themselves.  Same for
Megaminx.  As consumers we have more power than the
corporation!  Always support the product that is
better!

Your algorithm is excellent, at least for me. I find the algorithm 2. 
too long to do since it requires too many half turns to me. You can 
try moving around your first algorithm, it is very good also.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I also had that speed not very long ago, and maybe I can give you 
some tips. These are the tips that helped me the most (just ignore 
the things you already know):

1. Minimize cube rotation. Do you also solve corner-edge pairs from 
different angles? Try solving CE-pairs in the B face. This can 
minimize cube rotation, and it gives good visability on the front, 
if the CE-pairs on the front are not solved yet.
2. During F2L, it&#x27;s important not to look at the pieces you are 
solving to much. You should be looking for the pieces you need for 
the next step.
3. Have you tried solving the cube slowly? For me, it&#x27;s very hard to 
get faster by solving the cube at full speed a thousand times. 
Instead, by solving the cube very slowly, I find new shortcuts and 
ways to minimize moves. Especially for the first 2 corner edge 
pairs, there are tons of shortcuts (I don&#x27;t know all of them btw). I 
can also advise you to learn about working corners/edges and about 
placing non-matching pairs.
4. For the last layer: Look on different website for alternative 
algoritms. Also try to find other ways to execute the algorithms. 
Sometimes I prefer longer algorithms, if they can be done faster. 
Watching cube video&#x27;s can also be really inspiring when you&#x27;re 
looking for finger-tricks.
5. Averaging 19.9 with the three look last layer was done by a world 
champion. That means it&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s also really hard to 
repeat. And I once read that it took this world champion 5 months to 
get from sub 30 to sub 20. So don&#x27;t expect results to soon. Just 
don&#x27;t focus on high speeds, focus on your technique, enjoy cubing, 
and the results will come naturally.

Good luck,

Joel.

I was not able to check the forum for a while, and
this issue came upon us.  I&#x27;ve read every argument
posted, every opinion posted, every thought posted. 
We will not find a &#x27;right&#x27; answer, mainly because
there is not one.  I find myself skeptical of Seven
Town&#x27;s motivation for banning Eastsheen from
tournaments.  It should bring into question corporate
concern for quality, as it is obvious eastsheen is
built better for the &#x27;speedcubing&#x27; community.  

I noticed just how far Rubik&#x27;s would go (last august).
For RWC 03&#x27;: at some point there was a fight for
color scheme.  We were actually in danger at one point
of forfeiting familiar color schemes, for the sake of
retaining a Rubik&#x27;s color scheme.  Thankfully enough
we won this battle.  Of course this tournament was
called the Rubik&#x27;s world championship, but was it
truly nececcesary(sp?) to force us to put a logo
sticker on our cube?  It wasn&#x27;t terribly distracting
or anything, but come&#x27;on! Must we label everything?  

Should old records stay? Of course!  Anyone who put
this to question should feel shameful.  We are not
setting records that represent brands, we are setting
records that represent puzzles.  There are records for
the 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5.  Whether or not these
cubical puzzles are rubiks...I care not.  If Rubik&#x27;s
wants business, don&#x27;t try snuffing out the smaller
companies with gimmicks that suggest foul play and
selfish alterior motives!  Make better products!  Who
cares about the brand, we do this for the puzzle.  We
do this for the challenge.  When we run somewhere, we
feel good because we arrived at our destination, not
because our shoes were the right brand.  I suggest
that we have tournaments that involve all brands. 
Instead of having a monopolized Rubik&#x27;s World
Championship, why not have a Puzzling World
Championship, or Puzzle Olympics, where emphasis is
not put on brand alone, but quality overall.  There
are many puzzles that were neglected at RWC, that are
respected among the cubing community.  Notice the
skewb was not included last year!  Pyraminx solvers
only got one shot to prove themselves.  Same for
Megaminx.  As consumers we have more power than the
corporation!  Always support the product that is
better!

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I thought people might be interested in the results of some<br>
of our recent competitions at Temecula Valley High School (Southern <br>
California):<br>
<br>
www.pe.net/~bmcgaugh/tvhsrubiklist.htm<br>
<br>
We have had four Friday contests, each contestent getting 3 trials <br>
on the Stackmat, computer scrambles, etc...best time wins...<br>
David Matics has won each of those contests.  I will post complete <br>
results of those sometime in the next week or so. <br>
<br>
This week we are having two other contests, one for people in my  <br>
classes, and another that is a schoolwide championship.<br>
For each of these contests, cubers get 5 trials, and the middle <br>
three will be averaged. The TVHS championship consists of people <br>
that have done 70 seconds or better in the other contests.<br>
<br>
A 35 minute lunch can be very short when you are trying to get a lot <br>
of cubing done ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">The face displayed in the pictures in the &#x27;Permuting the LL Edges&#x27; 
section 
(http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html#last-
layer-edge-permutation) is the face opposite to the one that you 
initially formed the cross on in the first step of the solution. 
Therefore, the original cross face is the D face and the face with 
all the edges that need swapping (&#x27;permuting&#x27;) is the U face for the 
permuting-last-layer-edge algs.

If you started with a white cross, then the face displayed in 
the &#x27;Permuting the LL Edges&#x27; section (ie. the U face for the algs) 
is likely to be the yellow face or the blue face since the standard 
colour configuration for Rubik&#x27;s cubes is white-opposite-yellow or 
white-opposite-blue.

As for which faces end up L, R, F, B for permuting the last layer 
edges -- this will depend on which LL edges need permuting. Look 
directly at your U face (ie. the face that has the final edges which 
need permuting) and match it up with one of the 4 pictures in 
the &#x27;Permuting the LL Edges&#x27; section. Now roll the cube slightly 
away from you so that the U face is now on top - you should now be 
looking at the F face. The R face is the face to the right of the F 
face, the L face is the to the left of the F face, etc.

Hope this makes sense,

Jasmine.

          <div class="email-content">My idea was to have a small battery in each piece, not a central power
supply. In such a way, the only wires would be within pieces, and lubricants
can be used.  The pieces would communicate through LEDs and light sensors on
the sides of the pieces.  There wouldn&#x27;t be one main processor.  Instead,
the processor in each piece would communicate with all adjacent pieces.  The
problem with central processors or batteries is that there isn&#x27;t room.
There is more room within edges and corners, than in the center pieces or
the axels.  It should be possible to make a button of the centers though,
that turns on a communication LED, which is read by an adjacent piece, which
then sends a signal throughout the network of pieces.  

 

So I think I answered the problems, lets see

 

Power,

A small battery will be within each piece that needs power, hopefully this
will be enough.  If not, maybe this will only be possible on one of the big
cubes.

 

Communication,

There won&#x27;t be a central chip, and I think the chips I have found are
powerful enough for a self scrambling algorithm.  And the communication
between pieces is achieved optically with LEDs and light sensors through the
sides of pieces.  And I can take care of the programming.

 

Manufacturing,

I haven&#x27;t even though about manufacturing.  I&#x27;m looking at this as a
possible science project, one which I am planning to do next year.  You&#x27;ve
got me here.

 

Shock prevention,

I&#x27;m not sure how a drop would affect the microprocessors and the LEDs if
they are secure and well made.  I know I said earlier, no central processor,
but I just reread the idea of putting one in a center piece, and that
actually sounds like a good idea, I&#x27;ll look into that.  In this way the
processors in the pieces would only be responsible for communication between
pieces.  

 

It would be cool for this not to be a night time only cube, but I&#x27;m not sure
if we could get enough power to light the LEDs that brightly.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Pretty Crazy Cube Idea

 

Hey Everyone, I&#x27;m new to the group (and to cubing, been cubing for 1 
month, hovering around 1:15 solve times using a corner first method, 
woot!), but I couldn&#x27;t resist adding a few opinions to this thread.

This kind of thing is highly possible, with today&#x27;s technology, but 
not easy to do. 

There are definitely 6 color LED&#x27;s available today, and they&#x27;re not 
highly expensive.

You would definitely have to have a microprocessor in each face, 
though. That might get a small bit complicated, but there are chips 
small enough to handle it.

A self solving one, though, I think is beyond our abilities (or if 
it&#x27;s not, would be extremely expensive, in the &quot;Government&#x27;s bright 
ideas that cost too much&quot; category)

Four major problems arise from this kind of idea, however, I&#x27;ll 
address them in my opinion of their order of difficulty (excluding 
#4)

First, power. 

How will you deliver power to each Light, to each processor, without 
wires? (Doing this with wires would make it pointless, pop one 
cubie, and the whole cube is broken, permanently for most people) 
Limited Touch power solutions are the best solution at hand, from my 
perspective. For those who don&#x27;t know what I mean, this means you 
would have two &quot;graphite&quot; (or another conductive material) strips 
that would meet up with a positive and a negative power track strip 
that is housed in, on, or around the frame. This would have to be 
almost perfectly manufactured, (i.e. less than .1% deviation).

Second, communication.

Housing a microprocessor in each cubie to handle what color each 
panel is will be fine, but you need a slightly larger chip (easily 
housed in the frame or in a center piece) to handle the &quot;self 
scrambling&quot; theorem. From there, you have to manage Communication 
between the main &quot;processor&quot; and all the small processors in each 
cubie.

There are processors that are more than small enough to fit and as 
powerful as a 386 is to handle the self scrambling idea. It wouldn&#x27;t 
take much, either. But you&#x27;re still left with the main processor 
telling each cubie what colors to be. A wireless solution, either 
radio or higher frequency, with a 3 inch range and each 
microprocessor able to receive them, would be great, but here&#x27;s your 
catch. Each chip has to be identified by the main processor, or at 
least each signal sent out has to be identified by ONE chip, and not 
ALL chips. This wouldn&#x27;t be too complicated, but is why you would 
want to use a processor as powerful as a 386 and not just the 
Smallest you can get. Now you need at least a 32mb flash chip (not 
even remotely a problem size or power wise, just a small 32mb 
eeprom).

Programming wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal (I couldn&#x27;t do it, but I&#x27;m sure I 
know a couple of people who can/could).

Third, manufacturing.

For this to be feasible (and to last more than a week), certain 
precautions in constructing the item have to be made, especially 
considering lubricant would be a bad idea, unless it&#x27;s conductive.

You have to have it built almost perfect, seeing as it has to be 
powered at all times, in any position, turned or not. You&#x27;re also 
going to have to worry about cube popping (from a design standpoint) 
and how it will affect things.

Fourth, Shock Prevention.

Any drop, or a bad finger-trick, can cause considerable Shock to any 
given cube. The processors, LED lights, and power conveyance system 
is going to have to be able to handle that kind of shock, and the 
occasional cube pop as well. From here, you&#x27;re going to have to use 
a higher quality high-impact plastic, OR a light high-impact metal. 
Plastic would be better, as you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about 
insulation.

Putting the processor &amp; memory in one center panel and the proper 
batteries in another would be the best solution. Of the remaining 
center panels, I would recommend 2 to be buttons, and a 3rd to be a 
control button

The first would turn the cube &quot;on&quot; (main processor &quot;boot,&quot; send a 
solved state to each microprocessor, and turn the main processor off 
again, leaving the LEDs in a solved state)

The second would turn the main processor on, produce an algorithm to 
scramble, send the resulting color combinations to each 
microprocessor, and turn off the main processor again. 

The third would be a Hard Press button, meaning you REALLY have to 
press into it for it to activate, and the other two buttons wouldn&#x27;t 
work unless THAT button was activated as well. This would prevent 
turning the cube off Mid-Solve, or scrambling Mid-Solve.

Assuming you wanted to put it in there, you could put a smaller 
(2kb) flash eeprom that would save the state of the cube, with the 
press of the fourth center panel not mentioned previously, and when 
the cube is turned on, it loads it&#x27;s position from there (i.e. only 
a solved state if you LEFT it in a solved state).

These are just my ideas, I&#x27;m not positive on all of them, and I&#x27;m 
thinking there&#x27;s a fully &quot;wireless&quot; power solution to be had, but I 
can&#x27;t put my finger on it. 

Two little things more...

Is this a nighttime / dark room only cube? If not, your LED cost 
goes from about 80 cents a piece to about $4.00 a piece, not to 
mention your power consumption goes up a little bit. 

Making a cube that simply lights up would be simplicity itself, 
really, and would be fairly easy to manufacture, minus the power 
supply to each cube.

first I timed and solved as normal (not entirely as normal, I gave <br>
myself 15 seconds inspection instead of my usual 10s).<br>
<br>
The second cube though, I set up a webcam and when the inspection <br>
time started I started scanning it into cube explorer as fast as I <br>
could, then (provided it was after the &quot;start cubing&quot; beep) I <br>
hit &quot;Solve the scanned cube&quot; and applied the algorithm as fast as I <br>
could.<br>
<br>
Which was faster?<br>
<br>
Well I&#x27;ve only done 2 trials so far (cause it&#x27;s 2:30AM) but here are <br>
the preliminary results:<br>
<br>
Me:<br>
23.74,27.14<br>
<br>
Cube Explorer:<br>
20.44,18.11<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m confident that the times would be much closer if I used my normal <br>
10s inspection time, but I can&#x27;t get the whole cube scanned in 15 <br>
seconds as it is.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s fun for sure, but a bit depressing.  I should really buckle down <br>
and learn those OLL algorithms.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thought I&#x27;d share this very very strange idea.<br>

http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/

it&#x27;s a result of a really huge computer run to find
algs, and it will provide on average (I guess) 4 or 5
algs for any LL situtation (however, there&#x27;s only algs
for 2-step LL solution, and for the Petrus method);
anyways, I find it the best site for learning algs
I&#x27;ve found so far, since it&#x27;s easier finding an alg I
like.

everyone should really check out his site if they
haven&#x27;t :)

          <div class="email-content">Evan, just getting back to you on the idea

With the size of each cubie on a standard cube, there&#x27;s simply not 
enough room (especially in the corner cubies) to put the leds, the 
circuitboard for the leds, the control wires, the small processors, 
infrared (or some other light based comm system) on all sides, and a 
comm system from that the processor. Add on top of that, I know of 
no way that a system could be powered on simply by infrared unless 
it has &quot;constant power,&quot; I.e. even when it was &quot;off&quot; it would be 
draining a small part of each batter in each cubie.

I prefer your method of power supply over all, though, it would be 
simpler, but a central processor would be a lot easier than having 
processors that can handle working together to self-scramble.

Looking at it from both sides, i think multiple power supplies (i.e. 
no wires needed, nor power by track systems) would be the better 
option, even if a cuber would have to replace those batteries in 
Every Cube every week or two, or even have a transference system 
(i&#x27;ve seen mention of it in this thread before). 

I think a central processor will be needed, but that&#x27;s my opinion, 
and there might be processors that work together well on that scale 
that i&#x27;m not familiar with. forgive any idiocy in this post, i&#x27;ve 
been up waaaaay too long.

maybe the LEDs could have two power stages (several LEDs are made to 
handle different amounts of power and put out more light), so you 
could have a night version, that was visible nicely, and if you just 
had to have it, a daytime version where the power didn&#x27;t last very 
long. LEDs are notoriously light on power requirements, and for 
the &quot;Central&quot; processor, you could have a &quot;larger&quot; supply just for 
it. The smaller processors could easily handle communication and 
what not, but they&#x27;ll also have to handle a &quot;power on by IRcomm&quot; 
type setup (not a huge deal, just something to bring up). 

Sorry to bring up the manufacturing, but from my standpoint this 
seems like an extremely cool idea that a lot of cubers would enjoy 
having for a variety of reasons, assuming it could be done simply 
and fairly inexpensively (say, $25.00 or so).

just my $.02

          <div class="email-content">Hello everyone,<br>
 <br>
We are now ready to announce our greek patent number!<br>
(see attached files)<br>
The first picture is a photo of our patent as it published in the monthly magazine of O.B.I (Industrial Property Organization of Greece) in the issue of May 2004. Anyone can see this if he goes to  http://www.obi.gr/online/edbi.asp<br>
and he has a good knowledge of Greek language.<br>
The second one is the translation of our patent summary as it is registered<br>
in the International Bureau of WIPO(World Intelectual Property Organization) the last month.<br>
In the following days we will inform the speedcubing community and the puzzle funs for the mass product of our invention.<br>
 <br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
I&#x27;ve been practicing the 4x4x4 a lot lately, and I&#x27;ve made a number <br>
of changes to my 4x4x4 method as it stands on my website.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m going to start working on a page with my speed solve <br>
method as I actually use it now.  I&#x27;ll call my current solution <br>
my &quot;Intermediate Method&quot; and put up my current solving method as <br>
my &quot;Advanced Method&quot; although there isn&#x27;t as much of a difference <br>
between them as the difference between Dan Knights&#x27; Intermediate and <br>
Advanced methods.<br>
<br>
Masayuki Akimoto has his entire speed solve method online, so I want <br>
to add mine as well to increase the online literature for the 4x4x4, <br>
and also to help out others who are interested in 4x4x4 speed <br>
solving centers first.<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in this page I hope to have it up in a week <br>
or two, I&#x27;ll try to work on it a little each day.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;ll post again when I have the page up and completed.<br>

True. Furthermore, it was right in front of you when you started
looking for it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I am planning to learn some more about the 4x4x4 after the EC (right 
now I know only 2 special 4x4x4 algs, and use only 3x3x3 tricks, 
exept for parity and an edge problem in the end of the solution). A 
good site about 4x4x4 cubing sounds very nice, and I am 100% sure 
that I&#x27;ll use it!

Greetings &amp; happy cubing :),

- Joel.

I did 3 attempts: 122, 112 and 79 moves. I didn&#x27;t know you could 
also &#x27;jump&#x27; pieces the first two attempts. 53 moves sounds really 
impressive!

Do the same with the right side.

          <div class="email-content">I personally don&#x27;t consider skipping either or both parities a lucky 
case.  You have a 1/4 chance of getting both parities, 1/4 chance of 
getting neither, and 1/2 chance of getting one but not the other.

I feel that since the situation where you don&#x27;t get a parity has 
such a high probability, it&#x27;s not as low as 5% or 10% I mean, then 
it shouldn&#x27;t be considerd lucky.

Also, the rules for the unofficial world records page state that a 
skipped step is not lucky if the chance to skip it is 20% or more.  
So by the rules it is technically not lucky.

<br>
No.  Of course Rubik&#x27;s brand cubes are preferred but I will not make them<br>
a requirement for this competition as you don&#x27;t really have assigned<br>
judges and you can do it in your own home.  The same applies for stickers<br>
and colorings.  There are no restrictions because you and your judge will<br>
be the ones determining when the cube is solved.<br>
<br>
If there are any additional questions, please feel free to ask.<br>

<br>
I am really interested in WCC and want to contribute somehow, and <br>
just started to translate the rules as a volunteer. <br>
I remember long ago this was suggested as one of competitions at WC. <br>
If we see a lot of participants, it will be very exciting and great <br>
online event. <br>
<br>
I worry having a judge may limit the size of event. <br>
You may want to do WCC as if it is official like having a judge to <br>
scarmble cube and time. <br>
I don&#x27;t think many people can have a judge, who understand the <br>
scrabmling cube and time but don&#x27;t want to join WCC. <br>
Actually, the biggest online contest ever was about 20 participants. <br>
<br>
Videotaping may be another idea. Solving video of consecutive 5 times <br>
is not bad. Of course, this also limits participants and there are <br>
still room for cheating. <br>
<br>
Any idea?<br>

Well, my idea was that someone really only needs a judge to scramble and<br>
this can be anyone and it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to teach a random person<br>
how to scramble a cube.  Does anyone think the rule should be changed?<br>

As for scrambling your own cube, it might be best that someone else does
it just so that you don&#x27;t see the cube until pre-inspection.  Is this
unreasonable?  Should we just allow competitors to scramble their own
cubes?

          <div class="email-content">Just don&#x27;t look at the cube when you scramble.  For the first qualifying<br>
rounds, it won&#x27;t really be that necessary.<br>
<br>
Having someone else scramble your cube is all just a part of the<br>
foromality when it comes to the sport of speed cubing.  Sure no one really<br>
gets anything from scrambling your own cube.  But I think if someon tried<br>
hard enough, they could memorize that backwards algorithm after scrambling<br>
the forward algorithm.<br>
<br>
When someone solves a cube, the goal is the solve the cube using your own<br>
method.  Having access to the scrambling algorithm is like seeing an<br>
answer key.  For the first few rounds though, it won&#x27;t be necessary to<br>
have someone else scramble.  Please let me know if you plan to not use a<br>
judge.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m learning the proper names for really large numbers because I&#x27;m a <br>
dork like that, and I found this page.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a page, called the Megapenny project, that shows you what <br>
ridiculously large numbers of US pennies would look like stacked <br>
together.<br>
<br>
http://www.kokogiak.com/megapenny/<br>
<br>
Take a look at the cube of 1 quintillion pennies.  Now imagine a <br>
little more than 43 of those for the Rubik&#x27;s cube.... Absolutely <br>
ridiculously large number :)<br>
<br>
The funny thing is that a quintilltion is small compared to the <br>
numbers they have names for.<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in number names, so far my favorite (yes I <br>
am truly a nerd) using the American naming system is <br>
quattuorquardragintillion (1*10^135)  It just sounds awesome ;-)<br>
<br>
Also does anyone know the names for the numbers passed centillion <br>
(100-illions or 1*10^303)   Like how would you say (102-illion), <br>
(137-illion),(612-illion)?  <br>
<br>
I guess these numbers are also in the american standard?  One of the <br>
sites I found listed them as million, milliard, billion, billiard, <br>
etc..  So apparently there isn&#x27;t really one set standard..<br>
<br>
Ok anyway I&#x27;m babbling, everyone check out that Megapenny page, it&#x27;s <br>
very cool!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,<br>
<br>
All I can say is wow.  That is really impressive, and quite humbling<br>
as well.  <br>
<br>
As a side note, when I was in third grade I got this book called &quot;The<br>
big book of amazing facts about numbers, math, and money&quot; or something<br>
to that effect.  One of the pages was a list of all the numbers up to<br>
a vigintillion.  Since I was &quot;a dork like that&quot;, I sat down and<br>
memorized that list, and I told my teacher and she didn&#x27;t believe me.<br>
 So I started rattling off the numbers.  She had to grab my book and<br>
check them since she didn&#x27;t know them herself.  I think that list is<br>
something that I will never forget, just like the first algorithms I<br>
learned for the cube.<br>
<br>
&gt; Also does anyone know the names for the numbers passed centillion <br>
&gt; (100-illions or 1*10^303)   Like how would you say (102-illion), <br>
&gt; (137-illion),(612-illion)?  <br>
<br>
http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/large.html<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s one of the sites you found during your search.  I<br>
had this site bookmarked from a while ago when I was curious as to<br>
what was after vigintillion (since that&#x27;s where my knowledge stopped).<br>
 Based on that table, I&#x27;m guessing the larger numbers are as follows:<br>
<br>
10^102 - tretrigintillion<br>
10^105 - quattuortrigintillion<br>
10^108 - quintrigintillion<br>
etc using the prefixes already used...<br>
<br>
That is purely speculation, but it sounded good to me.  I am clueless<br>
as to what to do after you finish with those prefixes and you hit the<br>
next &quot;checkpoint&quot;.  Perhaps 10^306 is uncentillion?  But again, that&#x27;s<br>
just a guess, and I&#x27;m doubting the validity of that since it appears<br>
that centillion is considered the largest named number.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ignore that last part of my post.  I completely misread your question,<br>
and answered accordingly.  As for my real answer, I&#x27;m sticking with<br>
the only semi-valid thing I said, which is that I don&#x27;t think there<br>
are names for the numbers above a centillion, since they have to stop<br>
naming sometime.<br>
<br>
&quot;This process can be continued indefinitely, but one has to stop<br>
somewhere. The name centillion (n = 100) has appeared in many<br>
dictionaries.&quot;<br>
<br>
So this is my answer, not that nonsense I wrote at the end last time.<br>

Just as an update on the world cube cup.  Send in your entries!  It is <br>
not absolutely required that you have a separate judge and scrambler <br>
for this qualifying round.  Also, so far, the United States leads the <br>
number of entries with 5... and that&#x27;s it so far.  So ENTER!!!  :-)<br>

Those number mentioned there are really small :-P

Check out this page : http://www.fpx.de/fp/Fun/Googolplex/

If i recall correctly the Googolplex number is the largest integer to 
have appeared in a mathematical proof :-) Or it was not long ago. 
Anyway normal humans can&#x27;t really fathom those ridiculously enormous 
numbers. We lack a real world analogy for that i think.

Cheers!!

If the width is 0.75 in, then the radius is 0.75/2 = 0.375 in<br>

<br>
  Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;m learning the proper names for really large numbers because I&#x27;m a <br>
  dork like that, and I found this page.<br>
<br>
  It&#x27;s a page, called the Megapenny project, that shows you what <br>
  ridiculously large numbers of US pennies would look like stacked <br>
  together.<br>
<br>
  http://www.kokogiak.com/megapenny/<br>
<br>
  Take a look at the cube of 1 quintillion pennies.  Now imagine a <br>
  little more than 43 of those for the Rubik&#x27;s cube.... Absolutely <br>
  ridiculously large number :)<br>
<br>
  The funny thing is that a quintilltion is small compared to the <br>
  numbers they have names for.<br>
<br>
  If anyone is interested in number names, so far my favorite (yes I <br>
  am truly a nerd) using the American naming system is <br>
  quattuorquardragintillion (1*10^135)  It just sounds awesome ;-)<br>
<br>
  Also does anyone know the names for the numbers passed centillion <br>
  (100-illions or 1*10^303)   Like how would you say (102-illion), <br>
  (137-illion),(612-illion)?  <br>
<br>
  I guess these numbers are also in the american standard?  One of the <br>
  sites I found listed them as million, milliard, billion, billiard, <br>
  etc..  So apparently there isn&#x27;t really one set standard..<br>
<br>
  Ok anyway I&#x27;m babbling, everyone check out that Megapenny page, it&#x27;s <br>
  very cool!<br>

Obviosuly your gonna find it last! : O )

Hi Joseph,

   It&#x27;s a matter of how you hold the cube and move it: try this (small
case letters are just a slice) : r2 D&#x27; f2 D f&#x27; r2 f. This is my
version of what I think you meant to post.

   If you don&#x27;t like that one try: R B&#x27; R&#x27; B F R&#x27; F B&#x27; R&#x27; B R F2 U

No, a googolplex is quite paltry in terms of numbers having been 
used in mathematical proofs (even if we restrict ourselves to finite 
numbers - and explicit ones at that, since technically every case of 
finite induction refers implicitly to arbitrarily large numbers).
Thus, for example, Skewes&#x27; number (roughly 10^(10^(10^34))) is far 
bigger than a googolplex (which after all is only 10^(10^100)).
Skewes&#x27; number is dwarfed by Graham&#x27;s number. The story behind 
Graham&#x27;s number is quite funny. (It is an upper bound in a problem. 
For a long time it was suspected that the ansswer to the problem was 
6 - it&#x27;s now known to be at least 11, but the best known upper bound 
is currently Graham&#x27;s number, which is really, really big. Though 
not huge (in the technical sense huge refers to a specific type of 
large cardinal).

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SkewesNumber.html
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GrahamsNumber.html

For a list of names of some big types of infinite number (none of 
whose existence is provably consistent from ZFC) see the section on 
Large cardinals:

http://www.web-dictionary.org/encyclopedia/ca/Cardinal_number.html

(Sadly they don&#x27;t seem to have anything on superhuge cardinals. As I 
recall they lie between huge (1-huge) and 2-huge - anyway it is in 
Kanamori - see below.)

(For further information on large cardinals, including describing 
indescribability, see &quot;The Higher Infinite&quot; by Kanamori.)

I&#x27;m more the other way. I can fathom that sort of number but I&#x27;m not 
so good at fathoming real world numbers!

          <div class="email-content">Yes, you could use the algorithm that Dan Knights (and many many others) uses, which is:<br>
<br>
x (R U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U)(D R&#x27; D U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U R)(D2&#x27; F) <br>
<br>
which requires a different starting position to the one your algorithm goes from.<br>
<br>
Another fast algorithm which I use in two-generator solves is:<br>
<br>
(R U R&#x27; U)(R&#x27; U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U)(R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R2)(U R U2) <br>
<br>
but I don&#x27;t see no reason why you wouldnt use it in normal solving, it can be very fast.<br>

i did some calculations, and it&#x27;s 266 different positions if you <br>

I&#x27;ve thought a lot about it, and I don&#x27;t think learning all 266 <br>

That looks like a great idea! I really appreciate your work. I am 
still learning the complete Fridrich Method right now, but if I&#x27;ll 
get really fast someday, there&#x27;s a chance I&#x27;ll need a website like 
this.

Alg: x&#x27; (RU&#x27;R&#x27;D) (RUR&#x27;) D2 (L&#x27;ULD) (L&#x27;U&#x27;L)

Don&#x27;t ever do cube rotations if you don&#x27;t have to, and in this 
particular case you don&#x27;t really have to. Just use your right thumb a 
lot... This is my idea:

RU&#x27;   - Simple trigger.
R&#x27;D   - Trigger D with your right thumb.
RUR&#x27;  - Not difficult, U is done with right index finger.
D2    - Just do this with your right hand, it works out OK.
L&#x27;ULD - L&#x27;UL shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, do D with your right thumb again.
L&#x27;U&#x27;L - L&#x27; with left hand, U&#x27; with right thumb and L with left hand.

It may feel awkward at first using your thumb this much in these 
strange ways, sometimes you may lose grip of the cube and stuff, but I 
can do it smoothly enough.

Finally, a question from myself. I can&#x27;t seem to figure out which 
permutations are Z, E or N or A or whatever just from the &quot;look&quot; of 
it. Is there a table somewhere stating which are which? Can someone 
link me?

It&#x27;s the best page I&#x27;ve found to explain in a

constructing large numbers. It demonstrates in order
of magnitude everything from the standard naming
systems for scientfic notation, including several
proposed methods for extending it beyond the
centillion mark, up to inexpressibly huge numbers like
Skewes&#x27; numbers, numbers in Steinhaus-Moser notation,

          <div class="email-content">One thing to consider about this that I don&#x27;t think
anybody has mentioned yet is that while a lucky solve
is 6.06 (1.9877 / .328) times more likely to be
counted in your average in a 12-solve average than in
a 5-solve average, the lucky solve will have an effect
3.33 times greater on the 5-solve average because it
would be 1 out of only 3 solves, instead of 1 out of
10. So 5-solve averages are really only 1.82 (6.06 /
3.33) times better than 12-solve averages in terms of
reducing the overall effect of lucky solves in
competitions. Still better though.

There seems to be a bit of a problem with this page:

&quot;10^312  103  trecentillion&quot;

and later 

&quot;10^903  300  trecentillion&quot;

It does demonstrate quite a bit - it stops pretty early on the 
transfinite numbers though.

Actually, in a later paragraph on the page, these two
are noted as an example of the ambiguity that can
arise with this naming system if one isn&#x27;t careful.

homepage.<br>
<br>
- Algorithms for 4x4 and 5x5. Needs pictures to describe the <br>
effects. Also needs more algorithms. Right now only a few I found <br>
myself and those I ripped from Chris ;-)<br>
<br>
- Idea for 7x7 and bigger cubes. Just a sketch, I&#x27;m just happy I <br>
finally described it at all (had the idea last fall). I&#x27;ll use POV-<br>
Ray to create some 3D-images, wanna see how that would look like.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan :-)

I had a look at ur site. It&#x27;s very nice!!

But where is my 4x4x4 restickering-adjacent-faces algorithm ? :-P

(Dd)R2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)R2F2R2F2(Dd)B2(D&#x27;d&#x27;)B2(Uu)B2(U&#x27;u&#x27;)B2R2(U&#x27;u&#x27;)F2 : (25-htm)

There it is (copied from old posting).

Now we all wait for Chris to post his &quot;new&quot; 4x4x4 method :-D

Happy Cubing ...

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ...

In any case u need to turn last layer one step clockwise or 
counterclockwise half of the time, 25% probability in each case.

As to permute/orient corners in 1 look there is a complete list here :

http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_corners.html

Otherwise u can settle for a 2 look solution. If u are not ending up 
with a case where u only have to twist the corners, then u can always 
do a corner 3-cycle to solve one corner, while leaving rest of 
corners in the wrong place. Then do a final corner 3-cycle. 

That&#x27;s what i can come up with right now :-)

It should send UF->RF->UR->UF though depending on how you view the

          <div class="email-content">If I understand your question correctly then there are:

If the corners (positions only) are not already solved,
12! = 479 001 600

If the corners (positions only) are already solved,
12! / 2 = 239 500 800

total positions for the edges after orienting them.

Hope this helps,
Chris

One time on the Sunday Contest, the algorithm made it about ten moves

this, I think this could be a combination of luck and the fact that 
you probably used some moves you also use while speedcubing.

          <div class="email-content">Use a corners first method from the 3^3. Use a pure corners first 
though, because if you use one that finishes some edges before the 
last corners, you may lose some efficiency. E.g., on the algs you 
don&#x27;t need algs that preserve edges, but some algs for the 3^3 may 
have that requirement. Pure corners first shouldn&#x27;t lose any 
efficiency at all.

<br>
I&#x27;ve been thinking about restarting the cube-lovers <br>
mailing list in some form or another. I proposed<br>
a Rubik&#x27;s newsgroup but it seemed really difficult to get<br>
support for such a plan.<br>
<br>
Lately I&#x27;ve been experimenting with an open source<br>
project called drupal which you can see see here:<br>
<br>
cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal<br>
<br>
So far it&#x27;s a fairly spartan setup but more modules<br>
can be added. It has an email/password authentication<br>
system and people have to log on to see all the <br>
content. <br>
<br>
The basic idea here is to have a discussion forum<br>
that deals with things like group theory, computer <br>
cubing (e.g. God&#x27;s Algorithm calculations), history<br>
of mechanisms and perhaps some of the more exotic areas <br>
like cube art could also be discussed. <br>
<br>
It would be a complimentary alternative to the<br>
Speed Cubing yahoo group, which naturally is<br>
dominated by speed cubing discussions. <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m also thinking about having a photo gallery<br>
just for puzzles. It would have the ability for members<br>
to upload pictures to their own album. <br>
<br>
Mainly though I&#x27;d like to see a modern version of cube-lovers.<br>
I think the drupal system could be the answer but<br>
I&#x27;m interested to hear other people&#x27;s opinions.<br>

Guimond&#x27;s method would be very good:

Orientation is done in practically one step. Permutation of all 8 
pieces is done in 2 steps.

          <div class="email-content">It would be cool to see this start, it is something i&#x27;d be interested 
in reading and visiting just like i do with this forum or the twisty 
forum.  Also I remember being bummed the first time i heard about the 
cube lovers going down and not being around to be a part of it.  

I like the forum layout as well

          <div class="email-content">Interesting. You need to watch out for your &quot;scramblings&quot; since they <br>
are not random. <br>
<br>
I remember when I was practicing some 20+ years ago while studying <br>
for my high school finals, something weird kept happening to me over <br>
the period of a few months. I always did about 50 &quot;mindless&quot; moves <br>
to scramble the cube and then solve it, scramble, and solve it, etc. <br>
There was one position that I scrambled the cube to that I did more <br>
than once and I also solved the cube the same way - this is how I <br>
started noticing that once in a while I did the same solve (roughly <br>
once in 100 solves). The tricky thing was that when I consciously <br>
focused on the scramble, I never got that mysterious scramble. It <br>
only happened very ocassionaly and only when I forgot about the <br>
scramble and let my thoughts wander somewhere else - there was it <br>
again ... It frustrated me for a few months because I could never <br>
repeat the scramble when I wanted. It also taught me a lesson of how <br>
important it is to scramble properly. Our &quot;mindless scrambles&quot; most <br>
likely form a much smaller subset of the cube space than we think. A <br>
good thing is to throw the cube in the air a few times while <br>
scrambling.<br>

&gt; Oh wow, I had to hop on here and tell you guys, I&#x27;ve done the <br>
unthinkable!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I was sitting here at the computer, just practicing my cube. I had<br>
&gt; just finished one, and I was scrambling it up again. I was about <br>
done<br>
&gt; scrambling, probably 20 moves, so I look down, still messing it up.<br>
&gt; Here is the crazy part, as I was watching, bam it was solved.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t know how it happened. I scrambled it just the same as I <br>
always<br>
&gt; do, and usually I am very random. But I looked down, and 3 moves <br>
later<br>

<br>
I have had 2 or 3 scrambles probably 10-15 times each, at least.  It <br>
doesnt mean much to be able to solve a cube consistently at 21 seconds <br>
if you know the entire solution by heart just because it is a &quot;common&quot; <br>
scramble, and once I decided that, I quit getting that scramble.  Every <br>
once in a while I get it, but when that happens I just keep scrambling.<br>

was gone from &quot;ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu&quot;. The files<br>
were in the form of cube-mail-0.gz through <br>
cube-mail-22.gz and there may have been a <br>
parts 23 and 24 as well.<br>
<br>
Thankfully Martin&#x27;s html version covering 1980<br>
to 1996 is still up and working at:<br>
<br>
http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/%7EMartin.Schoenert/Cube-Lovers/<br>
<br>
I still want to post the archives in there original form<br>
so I need some help. If anyone has these files please<br>
email them to me or email a link for them and I will<br>
archive them using par2 on CD and host them to the<br>
internet. This way we can be certain that the original<br>
cube-lovers will be preserved. <br>
<br>
Checking for these files on google does not look <br>
promising but I will keep looking. <br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

ok, there are 28 message archives
(the last one is &quot;recent-mail&quot; that contains the
last messages before the CubeLovers stopped).
Maybe it can be interesting for more people, so
the easiest way is to upload it to a web;
you can get it here (in one 2MB zip archive):

http://rubikscube.info/CubeLovers.zip

(The first mail is from 1980 and the last one from 2000,
so there are many unsorted mails to read :)...)
It is an interesting piece of cube history..

NICE!!

the &quot;genius is 1%perspiration and 99%calculation&quot; part is ridiculous,

          <div class="email-content">a normal computer probably would be able to do it.  i made a program
once that was checking the probability of getting certain combinations
with dice, and it took it about 2 minutes to do a billion
combinations. although checking if the number is prime is probably a
little more difficult, you probably would be able to do the same. it
shouldn&#x27;t take over a week. you would just need to make sure that the
programming language you are using for the testing would be able to
handle such a big number. i know for c++ you need to include a big
number file or something to make it work. if you can make that work
out, then you should be able to prove it pretty easily.

Hey everyone,



I read on the rubiks.com site that one less than the number of 

combinations to the cube, 43 252 003 274 489 855 999 is a prime 

number.  Is this ture?  How would you verify it?  It can have no 

divisor greater than floor[sqrt(43252003274489855999)] = 6 576 625 

523.  Are there more efficient ways to prove its primality (if it 

actually is prime) other than to do over 6.5 billion division 

calculations on a computer program?



Is there somewhere to read up on how this number was proved to be 

prime?  Does anyone know how to do this efficiently without having 

to use a very powerful computer?  Could a normal computer test 6.5 

billion division calcuations in a reasonable amount of time, say one 

or two weeks?



Just curious,

Chris

is prime.  That has absolutely no use to anything at all, in any way

Lol, ok I&#x27;ll stop now :)

          <div class="email-content">Indian scientist Maninda Agrawal wrote for a little under a year ago, 
a most modest 13-line program that with a 0% error rate determines if 
a number is prime or not. It&#x27;s not the fastest prime number solver, 
but the fastest one being right all the time. Apparently this 
discovery came as a huge shock to any mathematician that received this 
program in their e-mails at august 4, 2003.

Illustrated Science reports that this program, run on a supercomputer, 
can determine if a 80-digit number is prime or not in a matter of 
weeks, where the same computer with a conventional primality solver 
would use several billion times the age of the universe (that being a 
primality solver with 100% certainty, of course).

I can&#x27;t seem to find the program anywhere, though. Does anyone know?

Indian scientist Maninda Agrawal wrote for a little under a year ago, 

a most modest 13-line program that with a 0% error rate determines if 

a number is prime or not. It&#x27;s not the fastest prime number solver, 

but the fastest one being right all the time. Apparently this 

discovery came as a huge shock to any mathematician that received this 

program in their e-mails at august 4, 2003.



Illustrated Science reports that this program, run on a supercomputer, 

can determine if a 80-digit number is prime or not in a matter of 

weeks, where the same computer with a conventional primality solver 

would use several billion times the age of the universe (that being a 

primality solver with 100% certainty, of course).



I can&#x27;t seem to find the program anywhere, though. Does anyone know?

          <div class="email-content">6 billion isn&#x27;t really that much. Unfortunately your number is a <br>
little to large for Java&#x27;s type &quot;long&quot;, which can handle numbers up <br>
to 9223372036854775807 (around one fifth of your number). But to <br>
give you an impression, this program runs in around 2 minutes on my <br>
normal computer:<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
public class CubePrime {<br>
    public static void main ( String[] args ) {<br>
        long n = 432520032744898555L;<br>
        long d = 3;<br>
        while( d &lt;= n/d ){<br>
            if( n%d == 0 )<br>
                System.out.println( &quot;Divisor found: &quot; + d );<br>
            d += 2;<br>
        }<br>
        System.out.println( &quot;Roughly &quot; + d/2 + &quot; tests were done.&quot; );<br>
    }<br>
}<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The output is<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
Divisor found: 5<br>
Divisor found: 14797<br>
Divisor found: 73985<br>
Roughly 328831276 tests were done.<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This is 0.3 billion tests. Handling numbers a little larger <br>
than &quot;long&quot; allows would of course take a little more time and code, <br>
but it shouldn&#x27;t take longer than roughly twice the time, so I think <br>
6.5 billion tests with longer numbers should be possible to run in <br>
an hour or so.<br>
<br>
Btw, if you&#x27;re interested in the work of Agrawal &amp; Co, look here for <br>
a summary and their paper:<br>

Although this is the first example of a polynomial (in log n) time 
algorithm, that can certify provable primes (rather than get probable 
primes) it is I&#x27;m told by an eminent number theorist that I know, 
sadly, still not practical because the (lead) coefficient is huge. So 
the result is more of theoretical than practical interest. I&#x27;d 
imagine for small numbers of Chris&#x27;s type it would eb efficient 
though. Remember that the largest number proven to be prime so far 
has a few million digits. Granted it is of a special form, but it 
dwarfs the number of positions of a cube and the method used would 
not be that of the sieve of Erastosthenes. (I imagine GIMPs probably 
uses the Lucas-Lehmer test or some adaptation of it.)
Here&#x27;s a page on primality proving though (actual proving and 
probablistic proving):
http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/prove/index.html

As to the original question, that way of sieving although accurate is 
very slow. In fact, many large numbers are known not to be prime even 
though none of their prime factors (or even proper, non-trivial 
factors) are known. Several Fermat numbers fall into this category.

There&#x27;s a good quote on that kind of thing here:

http://us.cryptosoft.de/snews/feb97/15029700.htm

Look for the heading &quot;Colossal Composites&quot; - I&#x27;m not sure they got 
their number proven prime, but there certainly are some Fermat 
numbers that are known to be composite but for which no prime factors 
are known.

(Mathematica gives Chris&#x27;s number as prime almost instantly, but I 
don&#x27;t know what method it uses. I suspect it uses a probablistic 
prime method rather than a provable prime method.)

That verifies my suspicion that Mathematica uses probable prime

The way I did it was get my ti-89 emulator on my computer here and 
simply type IsPrime(43252003274489855999) and hit enter and uncheck 
the &quot;restric emulation speed&quot; option.  Had the answer in about 10 
seconds.

I assume a regular TI-89 could do in in under a minute or so... I&#x27;ll 
test it.

Anyway thanks for the replies everyone, I just remember reading that 
that number was prime but didn&#x27;t know how they found it.

I need to learn more about primes, they&#x27;re pretty cool :)

          <div class="email-content">Everyone says Ton&#x27;s are the best but i haven&#x27;t tried them.  Ideal cubes are
fantastic in my opinion.
Stickers are ok - at least as good as any others you buy.
They have the screws in the centre faces which is useful.
Any normal lubrication works fine.
The one thing that might bother you is that the colour scheme is different
to the more modern cubes.
You can always change the stickers around if its a problem - I change the
stickers (or paint up with nail varnish) the modern cubes cos i&#x27;m so used to
the ideal colour scheme.

If stickers are a real problem for you different coloured nail varnish makes
a great way to customise yout cube.  There are lots of colours it dries
quickly and its very durable.

True
I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied either.
I&#x27;ve ordered Ton&#x27;s cube too and it took 3 months more than what he 
told me it would. And they&#x27;re worse than the new rubiks.com cubes.
Plus, I didn&#x27;t know about mefferts back then and I asked him which 
were the best 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 for speedcubing, and he sold me 
mefferts&#x27; for a bigger price... I really think it&#x27;s wrong to trick 
newbs :\

have high school math. =P

          <div class="email-content">I have an Ideal cube, and it is absolutely terriffic. I do have a few

The only other problem, and it isn&#x27;t really a problem, just a

having it for two days, my old Oddzon cube felt so unbelievably stiff 
I realized I could never switch back now!

If you&#x27;re going to the European Championships, Ton will probably sell 
some cubes there. I hope and believe so, because if he does I intend 
to buy a few for sure.

          <div class="email-content">Hey, I looked at it a bit more, and I think it actually may be viable!

My suggestion for the method is as follows:

1. Solve the M slice intuitively. I don&#x27;t know how many moves this can 
be done in in average, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much worse than the 
cross. Say 6 moves.

2. Orient and &quot;divide&quot; all the corners. &quot;Divide&quot; here now means bring 
them all to their respective layers (left or right). You need heaps of 
algs for this step, but I think it&#x27;s doable. I&#x27;ve done some looking at 
it on Ron&#x27;s applet, and most algs I find for this step are 7 moves 
long. Say 8 on average just to give ourselves some slack.

3. Orient and &quot;divide&quot; all edges. Same deal. You need lots of algs, 
but again I think it&#x27;s doable. And I think the algs needed here are 
fewer than step 2. I haven&#x27;t looked at this step in any program yet, 
but it has a distinct CF look to it, so I don&#x27;t think the average 
moves should be that big. 10?

4. Permute one of the two layers. You need more algs than in the 
regular Fridrich LL here due to inter-layer parity issues. But again, 
think it should work. 12 moves.

5. Permute the last layer. 12 moves.

Total: 47!

Say in the low 50&#x27;s just to make sure. The cons is that the algs 
required are many, way more than in the Fridrich system. But 
considering mammoth methods like Z-B, it should be within limits of 
reasonability.

I have started finding some algs, I&#x27;m eager to learn more about this 
method.

gcd(x,y)= Greatest Common Denominator of x and y... I think

It really is a neat little program :)

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think this would be a very good speedcubing method mostly 
because of its lack of intuitive steps. Once the middle layer is 
solved, there is not much freedom. If it is compared to fridrich, 
the middle layer is similar to the cross. Then the peices must be 
moved to their respective sides which will be hard and maybe the 
equivalent of 2 f2l pairs but with many more algs. Then you end up 
with 2 last layers, the first of which is harder because of the 
parity issue and again equivalent to a couple f2l pairs in the 
fridrich system. Then both have a normal LL. In conclusion, this 
system (in my opinion) requires way too many algs, harder 
recognition and comprable moves to Fridrich. Plus it seems rather 
boring. I like intuitive systems. But also Eivind Fonn&#x27;s calculation 
of 47 moves seems nice. I&#x27;d like to know if anyone learns a system 
like this.

          <div class="email-content">Hey, Ton&#x27;s studio cubes are great for speedcubing and he offers them 
at little or no profit for himself I believe. They just take a lot 
of preparation. You can&#x27;t just use it brand new and expect it to 
work excellent. rubiks.com cubes on the other hand are good right 
out of the box with a little lube but aren&#x27;t as good. The only 
downside to the studio cube is they seem to pop more often and wear 
out fast. I thank Ton very much for offering these cubes to us. As 
for ideal cubes, eh I think they are alright but for the price and 
difficulty of getting one, I&#x27;d rather use a new cube.

Of course, although this is easy it does require some computation.

gcd(n,r) is the greatest common divisor of n and r. You can compute 
it using the Euclidean algorithm.

That step could take a while to check too - it indicates a recursive 
nature.

If r=2 this doesn&#x27;t quite work because r-1 has no prime factors but I 
imagine that this is not a great inconvenience.

Given you r subsequent post the 3 lines would indicate an 
equivalence/congruence relation. In this case congruence modulo an 
integer, but (mod x^r-1,n) is not particularly standard, I&#x27;d have 
thought. It could mean (x-a)^n is congruent to x^n-a modulo both x^r-
1 and n - that would be my guess. Alternatively it might mean modulo 
one or the other (or even modulo the gcd if some parentheses are 
missing as often gcd(a,b) is simply written (a,b).

          <div class="email-content">I know that it would be boring, but if you could memorize enough algorithms
you could solve most of the cube at about the same speed you can solve the
last layer. I&#x27;d say during f2l on fridrich method fast people do 2-3 moves a
sec and then during last layer 4-5 moves a second. So for this method if you
could get the algorithms memorized and learn to do them at 4-5 moves a
second you could do this (assuming Eiven Fond is correct in his approximate
amount of moves) in about 11-13 seconds. I&#x27;ve been solving this way using
some alg&#x27;s that switch only one or two pieces at a time and they&#x27;re are more
orientations when you solve the 2nd layer. I have no idea how to go about
finding those though. Thanks for all the input!

  You are probably, right, I got a bit carried away there. The main

  a) Pattern recognition requires a look at all 6 faces.
  b) A lot of the algs are really awkward.

          <div class="email-content">What I&#x27;ve been doing is to place 2 middle edges, then put the edges 
in their respective layers by placing the 2 last edges. This lessens 
up the edge permuations. and doesnt take too much time.

That&#x27;s true, I have taught 5 other people.  And they all average between 
1 and 4 minutes.  I doubt if more than 2 of them even remember how.

          <div class="email-content">This is the method i have been experimenting for awhile with.  This <br>
is the method i had a dream about if anyone remembers my post awhile <br>
back.  I was able to get times in the 35-45 with no alg memorization <br>
and i think it would be a fairly decent method to break 30 seconds <br>
with.  I doubt it would be a good method to achieve sub 20 with, but <br>
you never know.  <br>
my steps for this method was:<br>
<br>
1 middle layer<br>
2 fix off orientation case/orientate all corners<br>
3 place all corners<br>
4 orientate and place bottom edges<br>
5 orientate and place top edges<br>
<br>
there is plenty of room to mess around with shortcuts and stuff...<br>

i generated some algs but not many and you can get all algs for step <br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s easy.

For the 2-cycle cases you can just do the alg and you&#x27;ll have the case 
in question, and you do the alg again and you&#x27;re back.

For the 3-cycle cases, doing one alg once will give you the &quot;opposite&quot; 
case and vice versa.

          <div class="email-content">To set them up, just do the algorithm backwards and switch the 
direction of each move.  For example: to learn the algorithm R B&#x27; R&#x27; B
you would set it up by doing B&#x27; R B R&#x27;.  That will work but there is 
a better way.

I usually try to find a few algorithms that work well together.  
There are a few cases that you can do twice in a row, like when two 
pairs or corners are being swapped or a pair of edged and a pair of 
corners etc. So say you&#x27;re swapping two pairs of corners... just do 
the algorithm on a solved cube and then do it again to solve it once 
again.  

You can also do things like rotate three egdes, turn the cube and 
rotate three edges and now you&#x27;ll have to swap two pairs of edges 
with a different permutation.  Things like that mix it up.  You can 
also throw some orientations in there.  Sometimes you might find if 
you do a permutation that you&#x27;re learning on a solved cube and then 
you do an orientation you&#x27;re learning on that you&#x27;ll get another 
orientation to reorient the last layer and then get the same 
permutation every time.  In this way you can practice 4 algorithms in 
a row.  Hope that&#x27;s not too confusing for you.

about 35 of them can now solve the cube completely by themselves.

And I haven&#x27;t even been cubing for a year.

And it&#x27;s just the first session of the program.

5 people cannot be unreasonable for each country.  I could get together 5
international students from Hong Kong right now, teach them how to cube,
and I could have them solving the cube in under 3 minutes in 2 days.

I think if people just submit times even if their average is about 2
minutes, we would easily have 5 people from 8 countries.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks a lot, Per! That one certainly belongs on my page, so it is <br>
now (along with your opposite-faces modifier). Btw, I count &quot;Dd&quot; as <br>
one move, so it&#x27;s 18 moves only.<br>
<br>
Wasn&#x27;t it you (can&#x27;t find the post...) who once provided an <br>
algorithm to fix both parities of the 4x4 in one step?<br>
<br>
Anyone else has cool 4x4 or 5x5 algorithms not mentioned on my page?<br>
<br>
Btw, I noticed that Chris&#x27;s &quot;DedgeFlip&quot; algorithm treats the 4x4 <br>
just like a Rubik&#x27;s Domino. That&#x27;s why I recently asked for a solver <br>
program for the Domino. I did try Ron&#x27;s solver but it was too slow <br>

          <div class="email-content">yea, best advice for that is take a solved cube, and just keep doing
that algorithm a whole bunch of times. like a 100 straight or
something. while practicing it like this, youll notice that the
algorithm will come to the desired state right before you solve it.
take note of the position when solving it. then when you see it while
solving it regularly, you&#x27;ll know it for sure and you&#x27;ll be set.

Hey everyone,



It only took me 6 years ;-) but I finally got sub-18 on average for 

the 3x3x3!  Back in 1998 when I first saw Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s page, I 

made it my goal to also be able to solve the cube in 17 seconds on 

average.



I&#x27;m so happy to have finally done it!



Here were the times,

17.78 17.31 17.78 16.96 18.27 17.55 (22.81) 17.24 (16.32lo) 18.52 

16.42 (16.22) 19.61 = 17.74



The 16.32 time was lucky and I did not count it in the average.



Thanks to all the people who I&#x27;ve incessantly asked questions to

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I&#x27;m mostly teaching people at a summer program for which I am a
counselor for.  The kids are about 12 to 17 years of age.  It&#x27;s really not
hard to get people interested... if someone knows it&#x27;s possible and you
tell them they can do it, they&#x27;ll be interested.  If you can give very
clear instructions and try to give personal attention to people who get
frustrated (very necessary in groups of 20), it&#x27;s not so bad.

The first night, I went to a toy store and bought 20 cubes and sold them
all.  That evening, there were about 15 students all in the lounge
learning how to cube.  It&#x27;s great.  As you teach one person, you make him
teach the next step to another person.  Soon, the people you taught are
teacher others.

The next session of this program starts in 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ll have a fresh
batch of meat to work with.  I&#x27;ll try to get a video of a cube teaching
session up.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I agree with the other posts to be honest, I think the best way is to begin with a solved cube, and then close your eyes and visualise the pattern that you are going to permute. Apply this to the solved cube x number of times, until you get to the actual pattern. If you reach the correct pattern, you more or less know that you have been executing the algorithm correctly up to this point.<br>
<br>
Now really work hard to connect in your mind this pattern that you see on the cube with the move you are going to apply. Apply the move and watch it solve the cube, and make sure you feel proud of yourself! Confidence is everything.<br>
<br>
Good Luck,<br>
<br>
Dan :) - www.cubestation.co.uk<br>
<br>
P.S. If you really don&#x27;t find that this approach suits you, I will add set-up moves to my PLL page on cubestation.co.uk<br>

<br>
<br>
  Is there some way to set each of them up? I like the way cubestation <br>
  tells you how to set up the F2l cases, and i think this speeds up my <br>
  learning.<br>
<br>
  So are there any sites which tell you how to set up each permuation <br>
  from a solved cube?<br>
<br>
  and which last layer permuation sites are good to use?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Just wanted to give kudos to guys like you Tyson for your efforts in 
the &#x27;Cube&#x27; world.  Besides my brothers, I&#x27;ve only ever met one other 
person in my entire life that can solve this thing.  It IS a 
difficult thing for most people and it makes us a rare breed.  It&#x27;s 
only because of the internet and listening to your guys&#x27; stories that 
recently got me back into it and gives me incentive to keep 
practicing.  You guys out in California have done an excellent job in 
organizing these events and getting people interested again in 
cubing.  Keep it up!


People notice your work and thanks again for your efforts!

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations Chris,

For me, it was your 17.88 sec video that re-ignited my interest in 
speedcubing that I had in the 80&#x27;s.  My problem is that I keep 
changing my method.  After learning the F2L, I then learned all of 
the algs to OLL/PLL and also all algs for CLL/ELL.  In addition, I 
know most of the Waterman method.  I should just stick with one and 
master that one.  I only recently switched to putting the cross on 
the bottom, as opposed to putting it on top then turning it to &quot;D&quot;.  
I also want to learn the F2L cases from differnt angles to cut down 
on cube rotation.  I&#x27;m stuck at 23-24 sec for the time being, but I 
think limiting my cube rotation will help out.  I&#x27;ve been looking at 
your 4X4 page recently.  It looks like an interesting method, so far 
I&#x27;ve been using Minh Thai&#x27;s method of: corners - top &amp; bottom 
centers - top &amp; bottome edges - middle edges - and remaining 
centers.  I don&#x27;t know how the two methods compare by speed as I 
haven&#x27;t completely memorized even Minh&#x27;s method.  Later.

Wayne

  Is there some way to set each of them up? I like the way cubestation<br>
  tells you how to set up the F2l cases, and i think this speeds up my<br>
  learning.<br>
<br>
  So are there any sites which tell you how to set up each permuation<br>
  from a solved cube?<br>
<br>
  and which last layer permuation sites are good to use?<br>

try Bernard Helmstetter&#x27;s site:

http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/

it might look intimidating at first, but once you get it, you won&#x27;t 
use anything else :p

          <div class="email-content">Yeah just go with highest available seed.

Maybe if there were only 2 teams you could push back the &quot;world cup&quot; 
and make this become more of a friendly country to country matchup as 
a pre opening for the worldcup, I feel this hasnt been advertised 
enough.

Whats his average number of moves? It looks to be like 15-20.

Does that include inspection time?
Is your robot able to do avoid 270s? How much if any do you use 
under turning and over turning to factor in the subsequent turn and 
prevent lock-ups?
If you us some optimal solving sequence then you would be able to 
average LESS THEN 20 face turns and thus perhaps speed up the solve 
if it is the case you do not count inspection time.

For fastest overall time it is probably best to use slightly sub-
optimal solving sequences though.
Can I expect to see this robot of yours in action when I come to the 
Caltech Campus? Cuz that would be AWSOME. I&#x27;d love to learn how to 
build one of these!

Just curious, how are the turning sticks attached to the cube? And 
how hard/easy is it to take the cube out of the box and put it (or a 
different one) back in? Or is there massive alignment issues and 
color calibration?

          <div class="email-content">I just set new unofficial world record for pyraminx average.  It was <br>
under 9.5 seconds.  I&#x27;ve made my solution a lot more efficient than <br>
before:<br>
<br>
Average number of turns (10 trial):<br>
17,20,14,15,20,27,(13),(29),18,21,18<br>
Average number of Turns: 17<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t see many published systems on pyraminx, I was wondering <br>
about some others out there...<br>
<br>
Also...a bad situation for me is permuting 3 edges on one face of <br>
the pyraminx (without effecting permutation)  This situation is 12 <br>
moves for me :(  If there is a better one out there..please share!<br>
<br>
Anyone interested in my system for pyraminx can email me directly.  <br>
I will post a solution on my site soon anyway.<br>

I happen to think my - work in progress - site is very good for the

just to show a video of another method in lots of

make a video (e.g. no sound there :( )

I also made more videos of various algorithms in Waterman&#x27;s

program. Because the cube can be turned faster depending on which 
turns are made.

start in phase 2 instead of phase 1?

P.S. But I&#x27;m gonna write my own solver anyway ;-)

<br>
The cup results have been updated.  As of June 29, here are the results:<br>
<br>
http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tmao/cube/cup/cupresults.htm<br>
<br>
Congratulations to Thomas Templier for getting the current fastest average<br>
of 16.00 seconds and also to France for getting a full team.<br>
<br>
Keep those entries coming!  It looks like right now that Japan has the<br>
strongest team with the United States in a very close second but keep in<br>
mind, these are only the qualifiers and are not the actual competition<br>
which will begin after all the qualifying entries are in.<br>
<br>
There has got to be one more person from Germany out there?!?<br>
<br>
And for the other countries, what do you guys think of just consolidating<br>
so you have teams of 5?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I included the four trivial tips.  As trivial as
they are, they still take time to do.  I am trying to
find the best time to solve these tips.  I will try
practicing to solve the puzzle, and &#x27;ignore&#x27; tips
until the last step.  I can usually figure out the
first 4-5 moves of my solution during preinspection if
I don&#x27;t worry about the tips.

<br>
The smallest number of moves required to reach any position is part of<br>
&quot;God&#x27;s Algorithm&quot; right? That may be established if we can calculate<br>
the frequency of repeated positions. We know for certain that the<br>
smallest number is more than 15 turns because fewer than that yields<br>
fewer than 43 quintillion positions. If the percentage of repeats is<br>
consistant then the fewest number of moves may be found.<br>
<br>
To add to the confusion here is a non-intuitive 10 move algorithm<br>
which does nothing! F&#x27; L&#x27; U L U2 F R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2<br>

How about getting some of those cheap surgical/latex gloves?  Then you 
can cube without touching anything other than the gloves :)

          <div class="email-content">No, cube preserving rotations would add another factor
of 24. Also we don&#x27;t know how many positions there
are at level 15 (in either metric), there is only an upper
bound. 

12 flip requires 20 turns. The best estimates I&#x27;ve seen
put the antipodal positions between 20 and 29 turns.
Upper bound arguments first appeared in cube-mail-03.gz

          <div class="email-content">Let&#x27;s hold off on the independent teams until after the World Cube Cup
first.

As for making other teams of five from the existing competitors, I&#x27;ll do
that after the deadline.  As for extending the deadline, I will be
accepting entries after July 1 but I&#x27;m not telling until up to what point
so get in those entries ASAP and very preferably before July 1.

teams, because slower cubers can still compete. 
Anyone interested in being a part of the team I&#x27;ve
already assembled, just contact me.  If we can&#x27;t get
the team as part of the World Cube Cup, we could
always organize a US Cube Cup.  This is our team so
far, we&#x27;d need one more:

*Richard Patterson (me) 
21-22 seconds average

*Jake Rueth
24-25 seconds average

*Peter Babcock
28-29 seconds average

*Nic Frinzi
36-37 seconds average

It wouldn&#x27;t be the strongest team, but as we all got
better we could try to be competitive.  If you&#x27;re
interested let me know.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, if you could push the deadline a bit that would be cool, I&#x27;m 
getting my friend&#x27;s cube on the 1rst of July unfortunatly it will be 
at night. But I might still be able to get in. Not my cube but it is 
fun to participate.

Maybe you could mix 2 countries together.

Hi fellows,<br>
ahem...well i&#x27;m preparing a new cube, just to have a few &quot;&quot;&quot;backups&quot;&quot;&quot;, if you know what i mean....and i really need a smooooth cube to have ultra good times, and here is my situation...<br>
----<br>
-&gt; (new cube)the cube is stiff, and really sticks alot, and alot of force is needed to do a time which takes my speedcube a little flick of the finger tip....<br>
---i&#x27;m wondering if I should do 2000 solves with this stiff crummy cube, to get it loosened up and going...it works, as i&#x27;ve seen, but takes __alot___ of effort....i really suck at preparing cubes, so if a wise master on the subject can help me out, i&#x27;d appreciate every bit of info.....** in getting this piece of plastic into a real consistent sub-19 spinning machine ;)...because i wouldn&#x27;t know how.  Frank, Ron, Macky, Lars.....anyone!.... how do you guys do it?<br>
this may sound redundant. .....but remember, i am endlessly annoying people to become better :D<br>

          <div class="email-content">What I do to loosen up a new cube is turn each face about 1,000 
times. Not necessarily in the same cubing period, because your hands 
will get tired quickly. Just do each face about 100 turns, then come 
back to it later. That&#x27;ll loosen up the springs really well.

And of course, you need to lube it. Get some silicone spray at an 
Auto parts store. I personally like the Snap Silicone Spray the best.

good luck!

          <div class="email-content">I once heard someone dropped their cube in sand, and
it turned horrible...until the sand washed out.  Then
it turned much better. I have tried this with
extrememly fine sand, and it actually works very well.
 Put some sand in there, do 100 solves, and wash the
sand out really well.  It acts kind of like an
internal wearing device.  Just a thought...

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Everything required (and much more) is available in
ACube program
http://software.rubikscube.info/JACube/index.html

The cube explorer always find the &quot;Domino&quot; solution as the
first one (if any exists), because it starts at depth 0
and uses only phase 2 to solve the cube. However, it
continues searching and adds more and more phase 1 turns into
the solution until it finds the optimal one.
So if you search for the first solution only, the &quot;domino&quot;
solution should be found (if exists).

          <div class="email-content">yea, the sand thing does work. when i accidently dropped my cube in
the sand once, i was sure that it was going to be ruined. it turned
horrible and it plain sucked. but then i just lubed it, let it dry,
washed it out, lubed it again, let it dry, and it worked great, much
better than before. now that cube is my speedsolving cube. :)

Hi,



here are my discoveries after years of searching for some way

to smoothen the cubes.

I applied it to my new Studio cube and it worked much better

and faster than turning the cube layers again and again

in a week...



First I apply some - body powder - into the cube, it is usually

very fine, but still quite abrasive (depends on its type).

And it even works as lubricant much better than silicone oil

on unprepared cube. Another option is - tooth paste - it

contains small abrasive particles to clean teeth and

I used it successfully to polish other plastic things (including

transparent ones).

After some time, the powder falls off the cube and should be

reapplied. But it takes quite short time (few days or a week)

and you can clean the cube and apply the silicon oil.

The result is that cube turns really smoothly without strange

noise that is usual even for smooth cubes that was used only with

silicone oil.

(personally, I also use body cream in addition to the silicone

oil in the first weeks on a new cube, because it contains a bit of

fat or similar and microscopically dissolves the plastic and

polishes the inner cubie faces. I use only silicone oil then.)



Just my 2 cents.



Josef

          <div class="email-content">I FINALLY DID IT !!!!<br>
<br>
A couple of months back, I decided to write a program to do everything<br>
I didn&#x27;t like to do with a rubiks cube. I was in a programming class<br>
at the time, so I did all their &quot;steps&quot;  including designing a GUI and<br>
such.  I also decided to have a &quot;simple&quot; solver included.  Boy was<br>
that a mistake ;)  I haven&#x27;t done anything else I wanted to do with it.<br>
<br>
I annoyed Jaap over and over again with questions (thanks!) <br>
<br>
yesterday, I fixed a bug and out popped a solution that worked. I cheered.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s really neat how it works... I suggest reading the math behind it<br>
if  you&#x27;re ever bored (or made a bet not to touch anything cube related).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Dear cubers,<br>
<br>
This is a text/article/paper/notice/woolaboo I write just because I&#x27;ve <br>
given the subject some thought over the last few weeks. And I feel I <br>
should share it with you.<br>
<br>
The subject at hand is basically this: How can we devise a good way to <br>
work out just how easy an algorithm is to perform by the demands of <br>
speedcubing?<br>
<br>
The kind of solution I am seeking is NOT a computer program where you <br>
input, for instance: &quot;(FR)3&quot; and the program outputs &quot;Ease rating: 2.<br>
522&quot;. What I mean is to try an algorithm out in several different <br>
ways, and then to work out which is faster without actually having to <br>
practice the algorithms for 2 weeks so you can see for sure.<br>
<br>
In the process we will work out a slightly extended notation, perhaps <br>
useless in any case other than this, but still...<br>
<br>
First, a few definitions (lots of trivial stuff, but a thing or two <br>
you need to read to understand the rest of the post):<br>
<br>
If you are confused by any of this, read on, examples are coming.<br>
<br>
- Algorithm: A given/preset sequence of face turns, double face turns, <br>
or slice turns. Technically, it doesn&#x27;t have to actually do something <br>
useful to the cube... Rather a theoretical concept.<br>
<br>
- Performance: The way you practically carry out an algorithm to the <br>
cube. Includes not only the moves of the algorithm, but also practical <br>
operations you need to perform, like cube rotations and grip changes. <br>
A performance is made up of actions, which we will classify into the <br>
following two categories:<br>
<br>
- Operative actions: Actions that alter the configuration of the cube. <br>
Just a fancy word for &quot;twist&quot;, really.<br>
<br>
- Non-operative actions: Actions that do NOT alter the configuration <br>
of the cube, but rather makes the operative actions easier to carry <br>
out. Includes things like cube rotations and grip changes.<br>
<br>
- Operation: A set of operative actions, or twists, that can (and <br>
will, according to the performance) be carried out without any <br>
intervening non-operative actions.<br>
<br>
- Active hand: The hand that, while performing an operation, carries <br>
out the actual turning of the faces.<br>
<br>
- Grip hand / passive hand: The hand that, while performing an <br>
operation, holds the non-turning parts of the cube still. This hand <br>
may also take active part sometimes.<br>
<br>
- Single grip change: Non-operative action that involves the active <br>
hand taking the role as the grip hand, and the grip hand taking role <br>
as the active hand. For example, if you do R&#x27;URU&#x27; with your right hand <br>
active and your left hand gripping, and then gripping the cube with <br>
your right hand so that your left hand becomes active and can do F&#x27;L, <br>
then you&#x27;ve performed a single grip change. That, by the way, was an <br>
example of a performance right there, only with a lot of descriptive <br>
notation for the non-operative actions.<br>
<br>
- Double grip change: Non-operative action that involves two single <br>
grip changes but no rotation of the cube as a whole. This may be <br>
required if your grip hand, through its grip, is &quot;solidifying&quot; parts <br>
of the cube that now needs to be turned. You need to change your grip <br>
hand&#x27;s grip in order to proceed, but you can&#x27;t do that without letting <br>
your active hand take over the grip in the meantime (or, obviously, <br>
you&#x27;d drop the cube).<br>
<br>
- Partial grip change: Non-operative action involving a slight change <br>
of the grip hand, where only 1-4 fingers move. The hand roles do not <br>
change.<br>
<br>
- Virtual single grip change: (Getting complicated). This occurs <br>
sometimes, when in fact what you are doing is a double grip change, <br>
but after performing last operation, your active hand is already <br>
&quot;good&quot;, so all you have to do is squeeze it and go ahead. Easier to do <br>
than a real single grip change.<br>
<br>
- Virtual double grip change: (Wow...). Same as a virtual single grip <br>
change in relation to a single grip change.<br>
<br>
- Cube rotation: Non-operative action that involves rotating the cube <br>
as a whole through zero or more single grip changes. How bad a cube <br>
rotation is, depends on the number of grip changes it involves. A cube <br>
rotation involving two double grip changes, is worse than a cube <br>
rotation involving one double and one single, for example. It is <br>
possible to rotate the cube, around one axis only, with zero grip <br>
changes. Hold your left thumb on the F center piece, and your left <br>
index finger on the B center piece, and then just spin the cube about <br>
the F-B axis with your right hand. See? Simple. Virtual grip changes, <br>
which are easier, should be given in halves, i.e. a virtual double <br>
grip change together with a cube rotation: 1.5.<br>
<br>
- Active hand fix: Very simple non-operative action that you are <br>
virtually forced to perform after an operation when it is impossible <br>
for you to continue without removing your active hand from the cube <br>
and putting it back differently, so that the next operation becomes <br>
possible.<br>
<br>
I think that just about covers it all. I propose the following <br>
extended notation for the purposes of this post:<br>
<br>
We will write algorithms like we normally do, but without the cube <br>
rotations x, y and z. Parantheses become obsolete, too.<br>
<br>
A performance P, made up of the operations O1...On, and the <br>
non-operative elements X1...X(n-1), will be put down in the following <br>
way:<br>
<br>
P = O1 [X1] O2 [X2] O3 ... [X(n-1)] On<br>
<br>
Operations are simple algs, with the exception that they can be <br>
performed in one continous motion without pause, and without being <br>
intervened by any of the non-operative actions listed before:<br>
<br>
I propose the following way for notating non-operative actions:<br>
<br>
Single grip change: [SGC]<br>
Double grip change: [DGC]<br>
Partial grip change: [PGC]<br>
Virtual single grip change: [VSGC]<br>
Virtual double grip change: [VDGC]<br>
Cube rotation of order x, where x = number of single grip changes <br>
required: [CR.x]<br>
Active hand fix: [AHF]<br>
<br>
A set of several non-operative elements X1...Xn: [X1 X2 ... Xn]<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
[AHF CR.2] or [SGC AHF] or [PGC AHF]<br>
<br>
Now, it appears that during a DGC or a CR.x, it is possible to perform <br>
an AHF at the end of it, and sets with SGCs, DGCs, PGCs, VSGCs, VDGCs, <br>
and CR.x&#x27;s together is just silly, so the only reasonable sets appears <br>
to be [SGC AHF] or [PGC AHF], but for the sake of flexibility, in case <br>
there is something I haven&#x27;t thought of, let&#x27;s keep the other <br>
possibilities open.<br>
<br>
So now, after all this stuff, I can present you an example or two of <br>
performances. These are my performances for a few of the PLL algs:<br>
<br>
Alg: R&#x27;URU&#x27;R2F&#x27;U&#x27;FURFR&#x27;F&#x27;R2U&#x27;<br>
Performance: R&#x27;URU&#x27;R2F&#x27; [PGC CR.0] U&#x27;FU [CR.1.5] RFR&#x27;F&#x27; [VSGC] R2U&#x27;<br>
<br>
The moves for the operations are not mapped according to the cube <br>
rotation, but is rather mapped according to the initial state.<br>
<br>
Another (LL is F face here):<br>
<br>
Alg: RU&#x27;R&#x27;DRUR&#x27;D2LB&#x27;L&#x27;DL&#x27;U&#x27;L<br>
Performance: RU&#x27; [AHF] R&#x27;D [AHF] RUR&#x27; [AHF] D2 [SGC] LB&#x27;L&#x27; [VSGC AHF] <br>
D [VSGC] L&#x27;U&#x27;L<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s have a look at the two, and see what we find out. First the <br>
first one.<br>
<br>
Alg: R&#x27;URU&#x27;R2F&#x27;U&#x27;FURFR&#x27;F&#x27;R2U&#x27;<br>
Performance: R&#x27;URU&#x27;R2F&#x27; [PGC CR.0] U&#x27;FU [CR.1.5] RFR&#x27;F&#x27; [VSGC] R2U&#x27;<br>
<br>
The statistics of the performance, that will (should?) eventually help <br>
us figure out just how easy it is to do, are:<br>
<br>
Number of quarter moves: 13<br>
Number of half moves: 2<br>
Number of double moves (i.e. RM&#x27;): 0<br>
Number of slice moves: 0<br>
Number of SGC&#x27;s: 0 (optimal: 0)<br>
Number of VSGC&#x27;s: 1 (optimal: 0)<br>
Number of DGC&#x27;s: 0 (optimal: 0)<br>
Number of VDGC&#x27;s: 0 (optimal: 0)<br>
Number of PGC&#x27;s: 1 (optimal: 0)<br>
Number of CR.x&#x27;s: 1 (optimal: 0)<br>
Sum order of CR.x&#x27;s: 1.5 (optimal: 0)<br>
Splitting (the number of operations): 4 (optimal: 1)<br>
Ease rating of operation 1: ???<br>
Ease rating of operation 2: ???<br>
Ease rating of operation 3: ???<br>
Ease rating of operation 4: ???<br>
Personal preference: ???<br>
<br>
As you can see, this is where my work so far ends. Questions <br>
unanswered are:<br>
<br>
Just how bad is sub-optimality on any of the accounts mentioned relate <br>
to each other? For example, if our performance just happened to have <br>
11 quarter moves and 3 half moves instead, would that total a change <br>
for better or worse? Or in other words, how much worse is a half move <br>
than a quarter move? The same applies to double and slice moves. In <br>
fact, the same applies to just about everything. If we consider the <br>
number of quarter moves be the &quot;unit&quot; by which everything else is <br>
counted, then:<br>
<br>
- How many quarter moves does a half move equal? (Not 2, if you have <br>
paid attention!)<br>
- How many quarter moves does a double move equal?<br>
- How many quarter moves does a VSGC equal?<br>
- How many quarter moves does a splitting equal?<br>
<br>
And so on. In addition:<br>
<br>
How to calculate the ease rating of an operation? One would think it <br>
had something to do with the following elements at least:<br>
<br>
- How many faces are involved?<br>
- How well does the operation alternate between clockwise and <br>
counterclockwise moves, so as to allow for cutting corners?<br>
<br>
But is that really all there is? As you will notice, the question of <br>
quarter/half/double/slice moves is already implied in the performance <br>
rating.<br>
<br>
And how does personal preference come into the picture? I propose a <br>
system where we study fast cubers, classify them according to &quot;style&quot; <br>
and which algs they prefer for which cases, and which of these they <br>
like and dislike. Just a suggestion.<br>
<br>
Many questions are unanswered.<br>
<br>
A formula for computing the ease of performing rating may look <br>
something like this:<br>
<br>
r = Pref(QMoves + C(HMoves) + C(DMoves) + C(SMoves) + ... + C(ERate1) <br>
+ C(ERate2) + ... + C(ErateN), X)<br>
<br>
Where:<br>
<br>
r = Ease of performing rating<br>
QMoves: # of quarter moves<br>
HMoves: # of half moves<br>
DMoves: # of double moves<br>
SMoves: # of slice moves<br>
ERate1: Ease rating of operation 1<br>
ERate2: Ease rating of operation 2<br>
ERateN: Ease rating of operation N<br>
Pref(a, X): Personal preference function that does something magical<br>
C(b) = (b - optimal(b))*multiplier(b)<br>
optimal(b): Optimal number for the given element<br>
multiplier(b): Multiplier to &quot;convert&quot; the element into number of <br>
quarter moves, or any other given &quot;unit&quot;.<br>
<br>
Well, this is where my work so far ends. Lots of questions are <br>
unanswered. Please comment away, give suggestions, or better yet, <br>
answer my questions. :)<br>

<br>
I just wanted to post saying that I achieved my goal of getting a<br>
sub-15 average on the Rainbow Cube by getting 14.92 seconds.  I&#x27;ve<br>
been practicing this one a lot over the past few weeks, including<br>
times when I shouldn&#x27;t have been (in class, at work, the night before<br>
an exam), but it has paid off.<br>
<br>
I remember when I first got the Rainbow, and I looked up the top times<br>
and saw 12 seconds by Chris Gilsdorf, along with Jake&#x27;s and Stefan&#x27;s<br>
times, thinking &quot;I&#x27;ll never get that fast, my method is way too slow&quot;,<br>
so I never posted my times since they were much worse.  I realized<br>
that others might have times for the Rainbow, and I am encouraging<br>
everyone to post their times, regardless of what place you will get. <br>
I understand if you don&#x27;t want to, as I didn&#x27;t before either, but I<br>
just thought I&#x27;d throw it out there.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, that&#x27;s a great program! I already found a nice algorithm for 
fixing both 4x4 parities in one go:

F2 (Uu)2 R2 (Uu) F2 (Uu) F2 R2 (Uu) R2 (Uu)&#x27; R2 (Uu) R2 (Uu)2 R2

This is 16 turns, almost all just R and (Uu) and then some F2&#x27;s.

great work guy!<br>
<br>
I recently worked/ played a lot with artificial life Simulations <br>
which use evolutionary algorithms. Evolution is such a powerfull <br>
tool! With the right &quot;environment&quot; god could evolve humans and later <br>
speedcubers. <br>
<br>
How about to use evolutionary A. to improve our speedcubing methods? <br>
Have you ever recognized that your speedcubing method is subject of <br>
mutation and selection? Could we develop a PC-simulation that will <br>
evolve and scale the &quot;goodness&quot; (for us humans, with all our human <br>
limits, like not seeing all parts...) of new mutations of methods? <br>
Could such a programm find an even better method/ solving appraoch <br>
than the Jiri method?<br>
Elvins work seems to be a big step towards expressing humans <br>
possibility to turn the cube and judging them for speed.<br>
<br>
Maybe someone did understand me. <br>
<br>
<br>
A human approach always seem to be based on subgoals, and a limited<br>
(not sharp, as you could always do U or U&#x27;... in Jiri method) set of <br>
algorithms for this step, this is one big difference to gods <br>
algorithm.<br>
ok enough.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I believe that you should not cut any times from your averages even if
they are lucky.  The reason for this is &quot;lucky&quot; is subjective to the
solver.  Let&#x27;s say I was solving and I messed up on a solve and had a very
bad solve but it was &quot;lucky&quot; and then I could discard it?  And then...
people have different definitions of lucky.

I think for the strict standards we intend to set for the World Cube
Association (and I assure everyone, it is getting under way), no solves
should be omitted even if it is &quot;lucky&quot; because who&#x27;s to say something is
lucky or not?

Lucky solves are all a part of speedcubing which is why a single solve
record is meaningless or will be meaningless very soon.

averages that they feel represent their own abilities.

For the WCA, we can&#x27;t allow for subjective judgement.  In a tournament, we
cannot say what is lucky and what is not because it depends from the point
of view of the solver and no independent judge can be unbiased in this
decision.

          <div class="email-content">I agree that for official contests we have to allow lucky times as 
there is no way at all to tell whether a time was lucky or not 
without causing problems.

I see it like a Backgammon tournament, which is a dice based game 
for those who don&#x27;t play.  In a Backgammon tournament there is a 
ridiculous amount of skill involved to play well, but there is still 
an element of chance since it is based around the roll of two dice.

Cubing is the same, since there are only a finite number of 
positions, sometimes you&#x27;ll skip a lot of steps, there is no way to 
help that.

I don&#x27;t think that an average of ten is representative enough of 
one&#x27;s skill to allow a lucky time, since they come up less often 
than that.  I always count lucky times in averages of 100 since they 
are likely to come up a few times in 100 solves.  Again, only for my 
speedcubing.com records do I not allow lucky times in my 10 cube 
averages.

In a contest I completely agree that we have to count them, there is 
no real efficient way to rule them out.  It&#x27;s like Backgammon, we 
just have to deal with it.

Sorry if I rubbed someone wrong, I was just exrpessing my own views 
on lucky times.

My two cents, I&#x27;m done now.  Sorry to be a bother,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">You&#x27;re not a bother. This is a mail group. It&#x27;s purpose is discussion, 
one who discusses at it, can&#x27;t really be a bother!

I for one agree with Chris. In averages of 10, for example, the 
occurance or absence of lucky times will have a greater impact on your 
time, hence they should be discarded. For example, if &quot;averages of 1&quot; 
(to give an extreme example) were allowed, my &quot;average&quot; would be 17.47 
seconds, which is about 6.5 seconds lower than what I call my &quot;real 
average&quot;, which is an average of 50 where lucky times are counted 
(because in an average of 50 their occurence will be much more even), 
at 24.14 seconds.

But of course, in tournaments, where averages of 50+ are too 
impractical, and also so the practice of judging lucky solves from 
non-lucky ones, lucky solves just has to be counted in short average 
runs. It&#x27;s a shame, but it&#x27;s reality.

I for one won&#x27;t bother with averages of 100, they take way too long. I 
think 50 is enough, but we could always calculate this number based on 
the error margin we reckon we can allow, of course.

<br>
I think you make it sound like it&#x27;s very rare to have lucky cases. <br>
Even if we don&#x27;t count luck during cross/F2L, you still have a 20% <br>
chance of getting a lucky LL case during an average of 10:<br>
<br>
Single without luck: 215/216 * 284/288 = x<br>
Average without luck: x^12 = y<br>
Average with luck: 1-y = 0.2003<br>
<br>
You also have a 49% (1 - y^3) chance to get a lucky average if you <br>
take three averages. That&#x27;s almost fifty-fifty! In four averages you <br>
even break that barrier, expecting a lucky case with 59%.<br>
<br>
I do understand your reasoning (practice should make the difference, <br>
not luck), though. Oh well... whatever ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris- I totally see where you are coming from. Not allowing lucky 
times in an average is a good means of measuring ones ability, but 
in my opinion it is not a true average. I do count lucky times for a 
couple of reasons. First, speedcubing is not that simple and 
sometimes the best case for each step will come up which is 
extremely lucky but still counted in an average and other times like 
Tyson said, the solve can still be lucky even if one gets a bad 
time. And about half the time, I do a 2 look OLL and half the time 
it is 1 look and it is hard to determine what exactly is &quot;lucky&quot;. I 
think you get the idea.
Also, for me a &quot;lucky&quot; solve comes up about 1 in 10 times so it 
would make sense to count it in the average. Even if a lucky solve 
happens only once in 20 solves there is still a greater than 50% 
chance that it will show up in the average and I would count it. 
Just my 2 cents but hey, whatever maintains the buoyancy of your 
aquatic transportation vessel :)

          <div class="email-content">My opinion is that lucky cases should not be taken out, because part 
of speedcubing is learning to increase your luck. For example, some 
of us use COLL to increase our chance of PLL skip for certain OLL 
cases. Many use partial edge control for the last pair, which 
increases the chance of being able to use COLL (like choosing between 
URU&#x27;R&#x27; and R&#x27;FRF&#x27;). Or what if someone memorized 1/3 of all 1 look LL 
algorithms? Is it fair to take out solves where he solved the last 
layer in one step?

Of course, I wouldn&#x27;t accept averages with 4 lucky cases out of the 
12 solves. If I did, my best average would be 14.1.... =D

Evan, can u make about 1000 robots ready for early august ? :D

Hehe ...

Another use of the robot could be to assist during cubing marathons. 
After u solve a cube it picks it up and does a random scramble 
(better scrambling then humans can do as we tend to fall 
into &quot;shuffling patterns&quot;). Then puts it down, ready for u to solve.

U could also compete in speedcubing agaist it ;-)

          <div class="email-content">First, I think that noone on this speedcubing group has ever managed 
to spell my name right. Peculiar. :)

I am intrigued by the idea of using an evolution-like program to 
develop new and better speedcubing methods. It would be a really 
interesting project.

Basically, a good speedcubing method scores high on the following 
three accounts (this is trivial):

1. Few moves. This should be an easy (well, not easy, but easy 
relative to the other two) automatic calculation.

2. Allows the moves to be executed quickly. If anybody remember my 
shot at a &quot;ring&quot; method earlier, the algs became awkward because F, U, 
D and B turns often occured in the same alg. This point is basically 
what my last post was about, too.

3. Allows for few or no breaks inbetween moves. In other words, quick 
recognition. I don&#x27;t think this should be too difficult to have a 
program calculate either. We already know some factors.

In addition, a restriction should be placed on the number of 
algorithms required to memorize. As we all know, learning the LL in 
one step yields fast times, but it is beyond the capabilities (or 
efforts) of most humans.

A program applying an evolutionary algorithm can rate methods on these 
three/four accounts, alter the method slightly, see if it beats the 
previous method, and if it does, continue on from there, and if it 
doesn&#x27;t, go back to the previous one and alter it differently. This is 
what you mean essentially, right?

You have my undivided attention. :)

          <div class="email-content">Interesting program but it doesn&#x27;t take into account intuitive steps 
which I think are very important in speedcubing. How would that 
program rate the Petrus method. I like the idea but I still think 
the best and easiest way to judge a method would be by humans. And 
another thing to take into account I just thought of is cube 
rotations.

          <div class="email-content">I think Macky makes a good point about when a &#x27;lucky&#x27; case perhaps 
isn&#x27;t necessarily a lucky case.

If a person has put in extra effort (eg. learning and applying extra 
algs) to get a &#x27;lucky&#x27; case then is it really &#x27;lucky&#x27;? 
Doesn&#x27;t &#x27;lucky&#x27; suggest that it just randomly happened with no input 
from the cuber? If the cuber has learnt extra algs to increase the 
probability of skipping a step, then should it be considered a lucky 
case any time they get to use the new algs and thus skip a step?

forgive me for not reading all 250-some mails in my
cubing folder to check whether or not this is
redundant.

Yes, it is the last ZB step.

and I plan(ned?) to learn all 177 cases... but if
that&#x27;s not the fastest way to go, what is?

learning step(5+6) and step(6+7) and picking which one
to use after completing F2L?

Okay.  Sounds good.  I thought you weren&#x27;t allowing pops in the average of
5 and I just wanted to be consistent with you so I&#x27;ll allow pops.

Interesting point...<br>
<br>
The speedcubing.com rule says: skipping a step is ok if the chance is<br>
1/5 or more.<br>
<br>
Maybe it should say: skipping a step in an average of N is ok if the<br>
chance of it happening in the whole average is 0.5/N or more.<br>
<br>
The advantage of this formula is that it scales well: extremely lucky<br>
cases can be included in extremely long averages, but not for example in<br>
an average of 1.<br>
<br>
But also consider that unlucky cases have the potential to skew the<br>

I use the same thing as Michael Atkinson.

The way that averages the less move is step 5. And than 6+7.

          <div class="email-content">Hello!<br>
<br>
I have just received my first eastsheen 5x5x5 (also called mini-<br>
5x5x5). Now i have a few questions. Maybe they are trivial? :D<br>
<br>
1) How do i prevent the centercaps from falling off all the time? <br>
Obviously i still want to be able take them off in case i need to <br>
adjust tension. Will they stop falling off once the cube is broken in <br>
or lubed?<br>
<br>
2) About lubing. Should i wait for a while before lubing it or can i <br>
lube straight away? And how is the best way to lube it, do i need to <br>
disassemble it?<br>
<br>
3) Do i need make my own orange stickers for it? I want <br>
the &quot;standard&quot; BOY color scheme with white&lt;&gt;yellow, green&lt;&gt;blue and <br>
red&lt;&gt;orange. I could of course use standard orange 5x5x5 replacement <br>
stickers and cut with a stanley. But i want to have rounded corners <br>
to match the other stickers.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Per,

Here is what I have found about the Eastsheen that I&#x27;ve found 
helpful.

> 1) How do i prevent the centercaps from falling off all the time?

What I do is to press on them every couple solves.  I&#x27;ll grab two 
opposite faces on the center caps only and just lightly press down 
to make sure the centers are in place.  Do this for all 6 faces.  
You don&#x27;t really have to do this very often, but it is nice to do 
every now and then to make sure they won&#x27;t fall off during a solve.  
After a while the center caps just kind of set in and they hardly 
ever cause problems.

I would recommend lubing it straight away since it is so stiff when 
it is new.  Take the screw out of the top face, and take the whole 
center piece assembly out too (this loosens up the other pieces so 
that you can take them out too.  Now take out a central most edge 
piece (the two adjacent centers should either fall off by themselves 
or you will need to take them off by yourself).  Now you should have 
a little keyhole missing from the top two layers.  Spray a *very* 
little amount of lube inside and put it back together.  Be sure to 
turn the faces a lot afterwards to spread the lube all around.  The 
Eastsheens actually loosen up very, very nicely once lubricated, and 
you really don&#x27;t need a lot at all to get them loose, so go easy on 
the silicone.

The rubiks.com stickers fit the Eastsheen cubes very nicely.  You 
have to apply each one individually though, since the applicator 
sheet is too large for the eastsheen cubes.  The stickers are very, 
very slightly larger than the Eastsheens ones, so it the side will 
look more colored, but they fit fine and don&#x27;t interfere with 
turning.  The rubiks.com stickers look very nice on there, but if 
you want to round the corners of them more I think a small knife 
should do the trick :)

Hope this helps,
Chris

I have no idea what the Eastsheen 2x2x2&#x27;s look like. Are they the very small ones with the purple stickers instead of orange? in case they are, they don&#x27;t look very easy to use and it seems they&#x27;re going to break every second. I may be wrong too. And the ones I&#x27;m talking about are maybe not eastsheens, but as they also had fusions, triameses and &quot;4-ameses&quot; in this shop, I thought we may be talking about the same cubes. Peculiar.

I just contacted Eastsheen, and asked them if they would sell their 
products online.  They haven&#x27;t replied yet, though.  I&#x27;m sure if you 
ask them nicely, then they will ship the products to you.  To pay, 
they might ask you to go to the bank and transfer some money.

P.S. My aunt also said they sold 2x2x2 fusions, 2x2x2 triamese, 
and...um, 4 2x2x2&#x27;s connected together.  We should come up with a 
name for that!

There have been a lot of the siamese, triamese, and quadramese(?) 
2x2x2&#x27;s on ebay lately... I think the seller was rubik_fan or similar.

Nice to know where they&#x27;re coming from!

          <div class="email-content">I must say, I didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the color scheme when I saw them, I just noticed there was a purple side. As it stands on Eastsheen&#x27;s site, they should be 5x5x5cm, but I don&#x27;t think the ones I saw were that big. So I just think they were just cheap cubes (by cheap I mean the quality, cuz they were just as expensive (maybe even more) as the Rubiks.com ones) made in Taiwan or something like that.
The shop is in Paris, it&#x27;s called Variantes, and they have several types of cubes, including the sealed 4x4x4&#x27;s and 5x5x5&#x27;s in that cylindrical box. They also have Megaminxes. All types quite expensive, I just remember the price of the sealed 5x5x5 they displayed was 60 (about as much $) and for the megaminx 28. Maybe it&#x27;s just the normal price, but all that seems quite expensive to me. Oh and btw, they sell all puzzles without the box. The puzzles just hang somewhere in small plastic bags. Any informative booklet (like the rubiks.com 3x3x3, sold with a solution booklet) comes with the puzzle in the bag. I don&#x27;t know why they do that, I think it&#x27;s not very legal.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, that is correct.  Painted cubes vary from quality and quality and
I&#x27;ve been presented with many awkwardly painted cubes.  Someone with a
painted cube would be asked to put on stickers onto their cube.

If the cube is very well indeed painted, then the tournament director (me)
will have the option of allowing the cube.  But it better be very well
painted.

If you can, I would play it safe and use a stickered cube.  If you
absolutely must use your painted cube, be sure that all 6 colors are as
distinct as stickers are.

Were you planning on attending?

          <div class="email-content">Yes I understand.  What will happen in 6 days will set a standard for the
future which is why I hope to get input from everyone.

Yes, there will also be a cube prep area.  If you guys want to prep your
cubes, I would strongly recommend you do it before on Friday!  I have a
limited number of stickers... so please don&#x27;t ask me for stickers unless
you really need them.

You need stickers if:

Your cube is painted in a really bad way or...
Your stickers are really worn out.

If in doubt, I&#x27;ll give you a set of stickers.

As for the new timer pads, once those come out, wonderful.  I get to
revise the rules!  Yay!

That is of course... we try them and agree that they are superior to the
stackmat.

If your cross in on the bottom, you can do some D turns to match a 
corner + Edge, bring both of them up together. Re-place the cross. 
Algorithm to place the pair together.

          <div class="email-content">Not sure I understand the issue here.  What are the possible problems with a
painted cube that might cause either the tournament director some problems
or give the speedcuber an unfair advantage?  Maybe I&#x27;m not sure what is
meant by very well painted.  Its a real problem to switch to stickers when
you get to a tournament if the colours are different to those you are used
to so I think there had better be some very good reasons if this &quot;stickers
and tiles only&quot; rule were to be generally adopted.

After finally finding a really longlasting solution to the problem by using
nail varnish it would be very disappointing to have to switch back.

Not wanting to get into any big conflict about this but I&#x27;d like to
understand the issues.

is that you can rotate the slices by mouse clicks choosing which 
direction you want. But I have yet to find a 4x4x4 like that.

It&#x27;s still up - just with a different domain name (there&#x27;s a recent 
thread on it). It is possible to get some pretty decent times on it -
 Grant Tregay broke 1 minute (he got 56 seconds) for the 4x4x4 on it 
last October and I broke 1 minute 55 seconds on the 5x5x5 in March 
of last year - so I wouldn&#x27;t say it sucked. Sometimes it can be a 
bit difficult, especially with a bad mouse or if the mouse slips 
but, all-in-all, quite good. It is harder to visualize on 3x3x3 and 
4x4x4 but above that (to an extent) it&#x27;s very usable if you do 
centres first. Eventually, you have to count rows a lot which slows 
things down, but you&#x27;d have to do that on a real cube as well (if 
they could be made to those specifications).

          <div class="email-content">You can paint a cube to give a &#x27;messy&#x27; appearance, but
still obtain a great advantage.  Imagine a painted
cube, with colors that spill on to adjacent faces. 
You could tell all colors of a piece without a cube
rotation.  I know this because I tried it on a cube
just to see the results.  Except mine wasn&#x27;t messy, I
painted it neatly to show colors of adjacent faces. 
Amazing how many rotations it cut out of my solves...I
got rid of this cube a few months before RWC 03&#x27;

          <div class="email-content">Yes, so I put in that rule because I did not want to deal with cubes that
are very very sloppy.  If a painted cube is very neat, yes, I so no reason
not to allow it but that rule is in there so that you understand that you
take your own risk when you bring a painted cube.

I need to amend it as well to include stickered cubes with very worn
stickers.

          <div class="email-content">Aahhh.  very good point Richard.  In fact I remember wondering how useful it
would be to do something like that myself but have to agree it would be
cheating.  Oh well I&#x27;m not changing now so I&#x27;ll just hope that if I ever get
to enter a tournament the tournament director is happy with my cube.

Er my UK entry for the World Cup was with a (neatly) painted cube.  Hope
no-one wants to complain!

          <div class="email-content">I was thinking the same thing about the colors overlapping on to 
adjacent sides but I didn&#x27;t mention it because that would go against 
the rule stating that each side must be a solid color. I do want to 
try that though with stickers like on Stefan&#x27;s supercubes. IMO it&#x27;s 
not really cheating- The puzzle is still exactly the same but it 
just makes easier to see and avoid cube rotations. I think it would 
cut down my times a lot.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Actually I was thinking about this a while ago and found this site 
http://www.linkline.com/personal/eevers/rubik/

The applet is based on the Karl Hörnell applet widely spread but it
cannot be programmed like Lars or Josef&#x27;s cubes with sequences and
maneuver buttons.

I know that Chris I working on a new solution of the 4x4x4 cube and
personally I also could have some use of a programmable 4x4x4 cube
applet. Maybe Lars or Josef knows how to easily modify the traditional
3x3x3 cube applet to a 4x4x4 (or as big as 20x20x20 as shown in the link
above) with all the fancy stuff they have build around it?

Hum, Something like that but, soemthing that you can actually 
rotate... I cant even solve the 3x3x3 because I cant see the back 
face. The best 3x3x3 applets i&#x27;ve seen is either the one on Lars&#x27; 
site or on the Rubiks.com site. What I like about the rubiks.com one 
is that you can rotate the slices by mouse clicks choosing which 
direction you want. But I have yet to find a 4x4x4 like that.

          <div class="email-content">I understand the want for equality and uniform cubes
and such.  But perhaps in the future we will re-think
these things. Overlapping adjacent sides will make
anyone faster...*shrugs* for now I will do it the
classic way.

I just found a funny cube story posted in rec.puzzles by Peter<br>

<br>
Let me quote the story in full below:<br>
===<br>
I found myself in a Dentist&#x27;s waiting room one day about 15 year&#x27;s ago<br>
and there was a jumbled cube on the coffee table.  I solved it in<br>
about 10 minutes and then proceeded to pseudo-jumble it by rotating<br>
the front face a quarter turn clockwise, then twisting the whole cube<br>
so that the left side was at the front, then rotating the front face a<br>
quarter turn clockwise, then twisting the whole cube again so that the<br>
left face was at the front, and so one for about twenty or thirty<br>
moves.<br>
<br>
While I was pseudo-jumbling the cube a young lady came in and sat down<br>
in the waiting room.  &quot;Ohh!  Can you do Rubik&#x27;s cube?&quot; she exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, I said, &quot;Anyone can do it.  All you have to do is make these<br>
moves.&quot;  I then proceeeded to exactly reverse the pseudo-jumbling that<br>
I had done previously, making very sure that I started with the exact<br>
same face that I finished with during the pseudo-jumble.  After about<br>
twenty moves it dropped out to the fully solved position.  She was<br>
astounded!  It had only taken me about 30 seconds or so to solve what<br>
appeared to be a randomly jumbled cube.<br>
<br>
After basking in the glory of the moment, I made a few random twists<br>
and handed her the cube.  &quot;Here, you have a go.  It might take you a<br>
while&quot;, I said.  &quot;Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t drop out so quickly&quot;, and then<br>
I was called in for my dentist&#x27;s appointment.<br>
<br>
She was still at it when I emerged 30 minutes later.<br>
<br>
Cruel?  Yes, but still amusing.<br>
<br>
Ciao,<br>

I just finished up a simple app you can use to practice OLL algs.  I <br>
hardcoded in OLL algs from speedcubing.com and it randomly selects one <br>
of the 57 OLL&#x27;s and displays the inverse.  It will also show you the <br>
original alg in case you don&#x27;t know it.  Hopefully it will help someone <br>
out, OLL seems to be pretty hard to practice.<br>

I added in the PLL algs, as well as the option to only practice OLL, <br>
PLL, or both.<br>
<br>
Also, for PLL algs, I have it randomly adding in y, y&#x27;, and y2 to give <br>
you different perspectives.  It takes this into account when it shows <br>
the original alg.  Try it!!!  The old link works, but it is just a <br>

His notation (for everything except the algs) might be

          <div class="email-content">There really aren&#x27;t a set of simple algs for the 2x2x3/2x3x3. It&#x27;s 
more intuitive but with a lot of practice, you will find more 
efficient ways to solve it.
I personally wouldn&#x27;t switch methods. You are already down to a 
minute with a layer by layer. It can easily be improved to get world 
class times. I would start by learning a working corner/edge method. 
It will improve your F2L a lot. Maybe someone else has a link to a 
good site to learn this? Then learn more algs for the last layer and 
work on a Fridrich F2L. In no time you will be sub 30. Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">As far as I know, that goes under &quot;corners first&quot; methods, and not 
&quot;layer by layer&quot;. If you want to learn the Petrus system, then no, 
there are actually no algs for the 2x2x3 -> 2x3x3 step. It is designed 
to be intuitive. But if you are really desperate, you can do it as a 
Fridrich F2L:

- Put the edge in (2 moves or so)
- Do one C/E pair. (7 moves)
- Do the other C/E pair (7 moves).

That&#x27;s some 16 moves. I don&#x27;t know how many moves Lars himself average 
on this particular step, but it&#x27;s bound to be less than 16. I&#x27;d 
probably recommend that you just try and fail, inevitably you will get 
good at it.

If you despite all warnings want to use the above method, take note 
that you ONLY use F2L algs that move ONLY the two &quot;free&quot; sides, lest 
you mess up your edge orientation.

          <div class="email-content">You can improve your own method dramatically by not doing all the top
corners before the middle edges.  If you do 3 of the corners then you can
use the space for the fourth one to easily put in 3 of the middle edges -
sometimes called the keyhole method (well by me anyway!).  You then put int
he last corner and the last middle edge as normal.  Not sure where you&#x27;d
find it but there aren&#x27;t really algorithms to learn anyway.

The page is in french (of which I don&#x27;t understand much),

I&#x27;m a cuber from Denmark. I cubed a bit in 1981 and recently
rediscovered the cube :-).
I average 46 s. with a Fridrich F2L and a 4-look LL.

          <div class="email-content">To fill the last 1x2x3. Lars averages 11.3 moves in his 13 exemple 
solution. Since those are slow solves, take a give or take 13-14 
moves.

There are maybe no algorithm to do it, but you can easily use the 
fridrich algorithms to solve the last corner edge pair which averages 
7 moves, step 4B advanced. I strongly advise you checking that 
section if you are to use the Petrus method.

The first part takes about 5 moves to solve the corner + edge and 
link it to the edge. And put it down.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for all the help, I have been working on getting used to 
finding pieces in that bottom layer, and manipulating them.

I am happy that after about 3 months I at 1 minute, but am really 
intrigued by the fact that in lars method, you do not disrupt your 
progress.  That is only moving free sides, while this seems very 
efficient to me as a novice, it also seems quite restrictive when you 
only have 2 sides free to move.

I have looked at Jessica&#x27;s page, and I really like her F2L approach, 
but it seems like a lot to learn straight off.

does anyone have a suggestion as to the best way to tackle that..

ie. learn the last layer gambit first
    or concentrate on the F2L
??

Thanks again for your help.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Yes, I remember I was amazed when I first found out that some people 
know all these algorithms. But the F2L algorithms are not so tough 
to memorize. Maybe you should try this: Go to www.cubestation.co.uk, 
and go to the F2L section. Do the setup moves, than look on the 
applets how to solve it. Don&#x27;t look at the R&#x27;s and U&#x27;s, just watch 
where the pieces are going. After watching it, try to do it 
yourself. Most of the F2L algs are quite easy to understand. Once 
you understand why a move works, memorizing it is much easier. An 
other important thing you should know, is that these algs are not 
the most efficient solutions. There are a lot of shortcuts, 
especially for the first two CE pairs. Also important: when learning 
F2L, go very slow when you are practicing. You should really think 
about every step you take. This is a great practice, and this will 
improve your times. Personally, I think solving the cube very 
slowly, without timing yourself is one of the best ways to get 
faster, especially for beginners.

Good luck :), and tell me if you think these tips are any good,

Joel.

Doing 1 move per second which is well more than enough to visualize 
and always find your pieces will yield you an average of under 1 
min :D

I think only the mods can get the full version, would you mind maybe 
posting it in the files section, so we can get it?  Thanks, very cool

Hi Daniel

Done! It is not that big, but it looks fine even when stretched
to 1024x768.

          <div class="email-content">Looks good, but very similar to what I did a few years ago... except 
I don&#x27;t know if you also went throught he trouble of perfecting the 
internal details of the cube by applying a micrometer to a physical 
cube.

Anyways, since you seem to be so fluid with 3dStudio, I was hoping 
you could bring a little idea of mine to life. I have long had this 
fantastic idea for a cube-themed wallpaper, but have never had the 
time to make it myself. On digital-blasphemy I saw this *exquisite* 
rendering of red blood cells, I want to add little (slightly rounded 
for that cell-like effect) cubes floating around the blood stream. 
The message of course is that, we cube so much and have the cube in 
our mind all day that &quot;cubes flow through our blood.&quot; Oh say, 1024-
by-768 will do. Tell me what you think.

I think that would really rock!

Well... Sometimes you can use the fact that some CE pairs have not 
been solved yet. For example: 
http://www.necrophagous.co.uk/cubestation/f2l/f2l5.php. Look at the 
first case (Case FR-R1). If the FL corner edge pair is not solved 
yet, you can solve the corner by doing the moves D&#x27; L&#x27; U L D. 
Another example for case FR-R4 on the same page. If the BR corner-
edge pair is not solved yet, R&#x27; U2 R2 U R&#x27; will solve the case. 
Learning to use this system fast just requires a lot of expierence.

If you have more questions, don&#x27;t hesitate! Good luck,

Joel.

          <div class="email-content">When I first learned the Petrus method, I wondered if it was possible <br>
to solve the entire cube using only Niklas and Sune (L U&#x27; R&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; R <br>
[U] and ). When my cubing skill and interest matured, I found out that <br>
one could do the J permutation as Niklas + Sune (or AntiSune + Niklas)<br>
, and that one could solve the whole cube using only J (and it&#x27;s <br>
mirror). You try that if you haven&#x27;t :p<br>
<br>
--- SPOILER  / METHOD / SOLUTION / HINTS ---<br>
with J + J-mirror, you can do U (tri-edge cycle) and A <br>
(tri-corner-cycle). For U, swap a pair of corners twice with different <br>
edges; for A, swap a pair of edges twice with different corners.<br>
<br>
the method I use is:<br>
orient 3 corners (get them all on U face with U color on the U <br>
facelets) and permute them.<br>
use the 4th corner as a working corner to orient the rest.<br>
Permute the rest of the corners.<br>
Use the petrus method on the edges only (using only U permutations).<br>
<br>
---- END OF (RUINING THE FUN) ----- END ----<br>
<br>
Which leads us up to now: I&#x27;m sitting here late at night, quite bored, <br>
and it strikes me - what other one-generator solutions exist? In other <br>
words: if you could use only one algorithm to solve the cube, which <br>
algorithms could suffice? Or, in yet another wording: which of the <br>
43e18 valid facelet-level permutations could solve the cube, using any <br>
of the 48 symmetry transformations (cube rotations + mirroring) <br>
between each application?<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s my slightly shallow analysis:<br>
It needs to affect both corners and edges (duh). This rules out A, E, <br>
H, U and Z.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, it needs to do an even number of edge transpositions <br>
(pair-swappings) and an even number of corner transpositions. This <br>
rules out G.<br>
<br>
Going even further, it must move at least one edge out of it&#x27;s slice <br>
(E, M or S). This rules out F, N, and T.<br>
<br>
The alg should also move at least one corner out of it&#x27;s diagonal-set. <br>
Huh? Example: If you used only Y, you could move URF to DLF, ULB or <br>
RDB, but not any of the other four corners. That&#x27;s what I means by <br>
diagonal-set (there&#x27;s two of them in total, the one above and the one <br>
consisting of the pieces that are _not_ in the one above). This rules <br>
out Y and V.<br>
<br>
So, we&#x27;re down to J and R (and R + R-mirror can be combined to do U <br>
and A just like J). Plus, of course, the quater-turns (but they are <br>
not really interesting in this perspective). What if we don&#x27;t limit <br>
ourselves to what affects only one face? What if we make an even <br>
number of transpositions greater than one? How could one calculate the <br>
God&#x27;s number for each algorithm? Of course, this will eventually lead <br>
to a &quot;fewest J challenge&quot; :D<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">There are no one generator solutions. The J Perm you describe also 
uses it&#x27;s mirror, which counts as a distinct element in the group.

In math lingo, there does not exist an element in the cube group 
with order equal to the size of the group. But I know of at least 
one way of doing it using two generators, which is still kinda 
cool... any solving sequence can theoretically be described in a 
string of bits.

The term you use, **one-generator solution**, is quite restrictive, 
it implies you shouldn&#x27;t allow conjugation with any simple turns. 
One-Algorithm solution is more general and vauge.

Right, the biggest order is 1260, while the mean order
is 60 (it accounts for approx. 10% of all elements).
Read that on cube-lovers, I think.

... could you elaborate on your two-generator
solution?

also, what do you mean by &quot;described as a string of
bits&quot;? you means as in bits and pieces or as in binary
digits?

and in any case: thanks for the input. And please,
feed me some math :D (one month until college starts
seems like a long time...)

   To edit it did you use the same email address that you used in

Exactly, 1260 is rather less than the order of the group. Another 
way to look at it is that if there was a one-generator solution then 
it wouldn&#x27;t matter which order you apply moves. Any two moves would 
commute. In particular, in the usual scheme of things you could 
always solve the cube in at most 12 moves (quarter turns) or 6 moves 
(half turns or quarter turns).

You can find two such generators on the web if you look around. 
David Joyner&#x27;s page mentions some. Of course, if a and b are two 
generators then so are a and ab (and ab is distinct from both a and 
b, lest the group be a 1-generator group), and so we also get a and 
aba or a and aab and so forth - of course if you do this enough 
times you will not always get different pairs - eventually you may 
get a and b again, e.g. if you go along the route of a and ab, a and 
aab, a and aaab etc., or some other pair). It&#x27;s not obvious (to me, 
at least) how many 2-generator sets there are. Anyway, it&#x27;s by no 
means a unique solution.
You can check for yourself fairly straightforwardly that the 
solution on David Joyner&#x27;s page really does work. You can observe 
that one move does an 11 cycle on edges and a 7 cycle on corners. 
The other moves stuff only in one face - a transposition of edges 
and a transposition of corners. There&#x27;s some orientation in as well, 
of course. I think the move that only involved one face had order 12 
and that its 4th power just rotated 3 corners and its 6th power just 
flipped 2 edges.
Conjugating such powers with powers of the other move that has large 
cycles, it is easy to see that you can orient all the pieces 
correctly. Similarly of the 2 edges that are moved only one is 
flipped and of the 2 corners only one is twisted. Therefore, by 
carefully conjugating with the other move (to some power) you can 
permute the pieces. Of course, that&#x27;s just an outline rather than a 
proof - you&#x27;d need to check the details - but it&#x27;s the basic idea.
Oh - the other thing is that in the move that moves a lot of stuff, 
the fixed edge and the fixed corner are moved by the other 
generator. Obviously that&#x27;s a necessary condition for a pair of this 
type to work. (It&#x27;s not necessary in constructing such a pair that 
the move that changes very little change only stuff from one face.)
It&#x27;s easy to see that if you want to solve the centres too (in the 
so called supergroup - which isn&#x27;t really a supergroup as the usual 
group is a quotient of it rather than a subgroup) then you need 6 
generators. You can show that by looking at the action on the 
centres of a subgroup with only 5 generators. Clearly there is a 6 
generator solution.
In summary, that pair has these features:
1) one move involves an 11 cycle of edges and a 7 cycle of corners.
2) the other move involves a transposition of edges (including the 
edge fixed by the first move) and a transposition of corners 
(including the corner fixed by the first move) and also flips two 
edges (exactly one of which is involved in the transposition) and 
twists 3 corners (exactly one of which is involved in the 
transposition).
Whether that is sufficient for such a pair to work I&#x27;m not sure. I 
think it probably is, in fact, but I haven&#x27;t really looked at it.
It&#x27;s probably also possible to get the 2nd move to twist only 2 
corners (rather than 3) - again exactly one of which is involved in 
the transposition.

The basic idea for permuting is this. Suppose we want to get an edge 
in place. Let&#x27;s call the two edge positions that move 2 swaps A and 
B and suppose A is the position that is unaffected by move 1.
Then if I want to get edge C in position, if C is not in position A  
move it to position B move 1 (several times perhaps). Now use move 2 
to get it to position A (that&#x27;s somewhat). So we can arrange for it 
to get into position A. If C is supposed to go into position A then 
we&#x27;re done - though actually, we should try to fix this edge near 
the end. Otherwise it goes in some other position D. We can move the 
edge in position D to position B by using 1 several times (though 
for technical reasons it is better to move the edge in some position 
D* as described below). Then use move 2 to and then undo the move 
that got the edge in position D to position B. Really you&#x27;d then 
want to undo the move that took edge C to position B in the first 
place (if it was needed), so you&#x27;d want to unwind that. Careful 
choice of position D* will enable you to get C to D* and then unwind 
to D. So basically you usually want to do some move like this (move 
1)^n(move 2)(move 1)^m(move 2)(move 1)^(-n-m).
This will enable you to switch edges - by using appropriate powers 
of move 1 you can cycle edges without cycling corners (and vice 
versa) so that you can basically use even permutations. Then orient 
in a similar way. Finally you&#x27;ll be left with at worst one more move 
2. So you can solve the cube.

What is meant by this is that, because it&#x27;s a 2-generator group, any 
move can be written as a finite string of 0s and 1s (or 2 other 
symbols), where 0 corresponds to one generator and 1 to the other. 
Moves such as U could have quite long strings attached. Of course, 
lots of strings would be equivalent (in terms of the resultant 
element of the group).

Changing my profile to my other email address did not help (though it
then would not allow me to edit the new one so I switched back). It
have something to do with the change from Clubs to Groups ages ago.

I sent an e-mail to the german website this morning.
A few hours later, I received a message from a french person who
wanted to know where I live. He wants to send me a list of stores
where I could find their products.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, but it says:

1. Solve First Two Redges
Solve Two Redges in Ring 
Solve One Redge in Ring and Other Redge in -R- Face 
Solve Redges in -R- Face Cycle

How do you solve a Redge, in the Ring? Is it supposed to say Midge 
here?
and the last part says solve Redges in R face cycle. So during this 
first part are you just putting the Redges on to that face, but 
incorrectly permuted?

No, it&#x27;s supposed to say redge. The redge is in the ring, but it&#x27;s 
supposed to go to the R face. So you solve a redge in the ring. :)

You&#x27;ve misunderstood. I agree that the site is a bit clumsy here. Look 
on the list again. It says &quot;1. Solve first two redges&quot;. This can be 
done in one of the three ways mentioned below. You don&#x27;t go through 
all of them, you use the one that fits the best with your current cube 
configuration. You&#x27;re going to solve two redges, okay, so which two 
redges are best? You can take two in the ring, or you can take one in 
the ring and one in the R face, or you can take two that are both in 
the R face, it&#x27;s up to you, but you aren&#x27;t supposed to do all three.

&gt; On http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/other_stuff/videos/ there&#x27;s<br>
&gt; a solution for the old Master Magic. Obviously, it doesn&#x27;t work on<br>
&gt; the new version. Can I change this one somehow to make it work on<br>
&gt; the new one? Because my current method is verrry slow.<br>
<br>
Two transform any old-magic method to a new-magic method and vice <br>
versa, do this:<br>
1. Start with the magic turned over left-to right (you now see the <br>
other side, but with the same edge nearest to you).<br>
2. Solve the same way, but in left-right mirror image (anything done <br>
on the left should now be done on the right and vice versa).<br>
3. At the end of the solve, turn the magic over to show the solved <br>
side.<br>
<br>
There is of course another option - restring your magic. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Alright, here goes another one of my lengthy posts :).<br>
<br>
I am actually already home, back in good old Michigan! I just can&#x27;t <br>
stand the wheather in LA. As I start this, I realize that the other <br>
part of &quot;team MI,&quot; Jon is still in LA (he leaves at midnight). So I <br>
left really early; and came kinda late (Friday evening). Back home <br>
at like 10:30 Pacific time, I&#x27;m thinking: I was just in the middle <br>
of all that 7-8hrs ago.<br>
<br>
It deeply saddens me that I had to go, I really with we can all get <br>
together more often. Back home, I&#x27;m the outsider holding a Rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube..., there you&#x27;d be out of place if you weren&#x27;t constantly <br>
solving one :).<br>
<br>
So it suprised me that I actually made it into the final round of <br>
the regular competion, especailly wiht the times I had been getting. <br>
THe previous day I did an average of 22.11s, but I didn&#x27;t get a <br>
sinlge time under 22.5 there out of all 13 solves :(. I had the <br>
impression that all the finalist were preforming a couple seconds <br>
slower then normal.<br>
<br>
Jon took the initiative to opt in a chair, a choice we were not <br>
given in Toronto. That turned out to be helpful in calming nerves... <br>
oh and for them 5x5 marathons (well for me they were, especailly <br>
since my 5x5 was so tight that when I gave to sceptical ppl to try, <br>
they apologized that I had to be using a cube like that, lol). There <br>
weren&#x27;t many entries in that category, allowing me to somehow get <br>
3rd place, even with a 8min ave/7min best. My biggest regret in <br>
Toronto was that I just focused on the 3x3 and didn&#x27;t participate in <br>
anything else. This time was different, I registered for everything, <br>
well almost... I considered doing the blindfolded event and failing <br>
misurably, lol. That turned out to be great fun, even wanted to do <br>
the pyraminx, had it ready and practicing but that got called off. I <br>
think none of hte so-called open events ran due to scheduling <br>
constrants and the lake of crowd support for them.<br>
<br>
In the qualifying round, I did 23,24,25. Progressively worst as my <br>
given scrambles got progressively easier...??? I thought my last one <br>
there would be sub-20 since I was given a ~6 move 1x2x3 block to <br>
begin with... I somehow managed to loss the middle piece of a 2x2x3 <br>
block and failed to make it as I was going for a more Petrus-ish <br>
start there. If not for my second to last stage-solve of the day, <br>
I&#x27;d of had no sub-23s times to speak of. Kinda pathetic compared to <br>
what I am used to aquiring while at home and relaxed. I know that I <br>
can get a bit lucky and get a sub-17 time here and there... I&#x27;d <br>
certainly expect one in an average done unofficially, but here <br>
everything falls apart, and I&#x27;m sure most of the other finalist <br>
would agree -- we all prob did about 2s worst then expected.<br>
<br>
For that whole nerve-recking ordeal that we went through, we should <br>
henceforth be known as the &quot;Extreme Cube Team.&quot; What is so extreme <br>
you say? ChrisH&#x27;s 25s ONE-HANDED solve! His brillint 4x4 and 5x5 <br>
times. Out of 40 solves in the final round, we (collectively) only <br>
popped once! Two out of the final 8 developed and used their own <br>
methods, not the Fridrich. Macky hit the timer when the cube wasn&#x27;t <br>
finished, fixed it and hit the timer agian... luckily the timer <br>
didn&#x27;t stop the first time around. The best time (of the 40 solves) <br>
was around 15s, the worst was around 35s. Etc...<br>
<br>
Here is a good time to throw in a random list of comments that only <br>
ppl that attended would understand perfectly:<br>
<br>
-&quot;Is there a Starbucks within walking distance?&quot; &quot;Ya, FIVE... this <br>
is LA, the better question is how many.&quot;<br>
-During final round: &quot;Funny how everybody&#x27;s times are getting <br>
gradually worst, while Doug&#x27;s is getting gradually better?&quot; Wouldn&#x27;t <br>
it be funny if all my times were strictly increasing?&quot;<br>
After solve: &quot;Ops, guess I spoke too soon.&quot;<br>
(I chose to use the unfamiliiar Fridrich on that last one and it <br>
didn&#x27;t pay off.)<br>
-A &gt;20 person TEAM SOLVE (were each does one turn and passes it on <br>
w/o communication)<br>
-&quot;OMG!!!, that one-handed solve was faster then some of my normal <br>
solves.&quot;<br>
-&quot;A13!&quot; &quot;W21!&quot; &quot;UPSIDE-DOWN! &quot;KICK-IT!&quot;<br>
-&quot;KICK-IT? Where?, What?&quot;<br>
-News headline: &quot;Strangely enough, the most popular attraction at <br>
the National Cube Competion was NOT cubing, but CUP Stacking!&quot;<br>
-To the audience: &quot;Has any one found a cube?... 3x3&quot;<br>
-&quot;Uhhh guys... we can&#x27;t just keep doing this [,taking up a whole <br>
restaruant and polluting it with our cube noise]&quot;<br>
-&quot;NO!!, YOUR BULL-*****ING me!&quot;<br>
-&quot;Hemmm...., let&#x27;s have Macky race the robot...&quot;<br>
-&quot;OH, ya I know that algorithm!&quot; ... &quot;Oh wait, no I don&#x27;t.&quot;<br>
-&quot;Awhhh, come on&#x27; I can solve that.&quot; ... &quot;Oh, guess not.&quot;<br>
-Common remark: &quot;They finish the cube, just as I&#x27;m done with the <br>
F2L.&quot; (head down in shame)<br>
-&quot;Got Lube?&quot;<br>
-The first day: &quot;Anyone wanta use Lysol?&quot; Everyone ignores it.<br>
-The second day: &quot;Anyone wanta use Lysol?&quot; Me:&quot;As it turns out that <br>
stuff really works..., and it leaves your cube smelling good.&quot;<br>
-regarding 2x2x3s and 3x3x5s: &quot;Oh wait..., I can&#x27;t do that move.&quot; <br>
(it&#x27;s so obvious to onlookers while it so frustrating to the one <br>
doing it)<br>
-&quot;Doug stole our hotel room :(.&quot;<br>
-&quot;Let&#x27;s have a cube race.&quot; (Like 20 times a day.) Cubers casually <br>
start, non-cube enthuseist think: &quot;OW, not this again, don&#x27;t they <br>
ever get bored...&quot; (mental yawn, pretending to pay attention)<br>
-The frequent standing around doing nothing.<br>
-Brent: &quot;You bastard. You cut me off from qualifing by .09 seconds.&quot;<br>
-Common remark: [judge]&quot;Are you ready?&quot; [competitor]&quot;no.&quot;<br>
-while squinting eyes: &quot;Your cube days are Numbered. <br>
(dunt,dunt,dunt)&quot; (Something I imagine one of those shorties, would <br>
be saying/thinking towards one of the finalist, lol.)<br>
-&quot;Ok, your cube doesn&#x27;t like me.&quot;<br>
-&quot;Uh..., I think you put on your color scheme wrong...&quot;<br>
-Frequent saying: &quot;So what are your plans?&quot; &quot;Oh, let&#x27;s just sit <br>
around somethwere and cube.&quot;<br>
-Frequent saying: &quot;THIS IS GOLD!!!&quot; (waiving around an alg on a <br>
napkin)<br>
-At the airport security: &quot;Uh... Sir/Maam, please open that bag and <br>
empty the contents.&quot; Pulls out a cube, and another, and another, and <br>
another,... as security laughs. (So that&#x27;s the biggest threat to our <br>
national security, Rubik&#x27;s cubes!)<br>

since my 5x5 was so tight that when I gave to sceptical ppl to try, 
they apologized that I had to be using a cube like that, lol). There 
weren&#x27;t many entries in that category, allowing me to somehow get 
3rd place, even with a 8min ave/7min best. My biggest regret in 
Toronto was that I just focused on the 3x3 and didn&#x27;t participate in 
anything else. This time was different, I registered for everything, 
well almost... I considered doing the blindfolded event and failing 
misurably, lol. That turned out to be great fun, even wanted to do 
the pyraminx, had it ready and practicing but that got called off. I 
think none of hte so-called open events ran due to scheduling 
constrants and the lake of crowd support for them.

In the qualifying round, I did 23,24,25. Progressively worst as my 
given scrambles got progressively easier...??? I thought my last one 
there would be sub-20 since I was given a ~6 move 1x2x3 block to 
begin with... I somehow managed to loss the middle piece of a 2x2x3 
block and failed to make it as I was going for a more Petrus-ish 
start there. If not for my second to last stage-solve of the day, 
I&#x27;d of had no sub-23s times to speak of. Kinda pathetic compared to 
what I am used to aquiring while at home and relaxed. I know that I 
can get a bit lucky and get a sub-17 time here and there... I&#x27;d 
certainly expect one in an average done unofficially, but here 
everything falls apart, and I&#x27;m sure most of the other finalist 
would agree -- we all prob did about 2s worst then expected.

For that whole nerve-recking ordeal that we went through, we should 
henceforth be known as the &quot;Extreme Cube Team.&quot; What is so extreme 
you say? ChrisH&#x27;s 25s ONE-HANDED solve! His brillint 4x4 and 5x5 
times. Out of 40 solves in the final round, we (collectively) only 
popped once! Two out of the final 8 developed and used their own 
methods, not the Fridrich. Macky hit the timer when the cube wasn&#x27;t 
finished, fixed it and hit the timer agian... luckily the timer 
didn&#x27;t stop the first time around. The best time (of the 40 solves) 
was around 15s, the worst was around 35s. Etc...

Here is a good time to throw in a random list of comments that only 
ppl that attended would understand perfectly:

-&quot;Is there a Starbucks within walking distance?&quot; &quot;Ya, FIVE... this 
is LA, the better question is how many.&quot;
-During final round: &quot;Funny how everybody&#x27;s times are getting 
gradually worst, while Doug&#x27;s is getting gradually better?&quot; Wouldn&#x27;t 
it be funny if all my times were strictly increasing?&quot;
After solve: &quot;Ops, guess I spoke too soon.&quot;
(I chose to use the unfamiliiar Fridrich on that last one and it 
didn&#x27;t pay off.)
-A >20 person TEAM SOLVE (were each does one turn and passes it on 
w/o communication)
-&quot;OMG!!!, that one-handed solve was faster then some of my normal 
solves.&quot;
-&quot;A13!&quot; &quot;W21!&quot; &quot;UPSIDE-DOWN! &quot;KICK-IT!&quot;
-&quot;KICK-IT? Where?, What?&quot;
-News headline: &quot;Strangely enough, the most popular attraction at 
the National Cube Competion was NOT cubing, but CUP Stacking!&quot;
-To the audience: &quot;Has any one found a cube?... 3x3&quot;
-&quot;Uhhh guys... we can&#x27;t just keep doing this [,taking up a whole 
restaruant and polluting it with our cube noise]&quot;
-&quot;NO!!, YOUR BULL-*****ING me!&quot;
-&quot;Hemmm...., let&#x27;s have Macky race the robot...&quot;
-&quot;OH, ya I know that algorithm!&quot; ... &quot;Oh wait, no I don&#x27;t.&quot;
-&quot;Awhhh, come on&#x27; I can solve that.&quot; ... &quot;Oh, guess not.&quot;
-Common remark: &quot;They finish the cube, just as I&#x27;m done with the 
F2L.&quot; (head down in shame)
-&quot;Got Lube?&quot;
-The first day: &quot;Anyone wanta use Lysol?&quot; Everyone ignores it.
-The second day: &quot;Anyone wanta use Lysol?&quot; Me:&quot;As it turns out that 
stuff really works..., and it leaves your cube smelling good.&quot;
-regarding 2x2x3s and 3x3x5s: &quot;Oh wait..., I can&#x27;t do that move.&quot; 
(it&#x27;s so obvious to onlookers while it so frustrating to the one 
doing it)
-&quot;Doug stole our hotel room :(.&quot;
-&quot;Let&#x27;s have a cube race.&quot; (Like 20 times a day.) Cubers casually 
start, non-cube enthuseist think: &quot;OW, not this again, don&#x27;t they 
ever get bored...&quot; (mental yawn, pretending to pay attention)
-The frequent standing around doing nothing.
-Brent: &quot;You bastard. You cut me off from qualifing by .09 seconds.&quot;
-Common remark: [judge]&quot;Are you ready?&quot; [competitor]&quot;no.&quot;
-while squinting eyes: &quot;Your cube days are Numbered. 
(dunt,dunt,dunt)&quot; (Something I imagine one of those shorties, would 
be saying/thinking towards one of the finalist, lol.)
-&quot;Ok, your cube doesn&#x27;t like me.&quot;
-&quot;Uh..., I think you put on your color scheme wrong...&quot;
-Frequent saying: &quot;So what are your plans?&quot; &quot;Oh, let&#x27;s just sit 
around somethwere and cube.&quot;
-Frequent saying: &quot;THIS IS GOLD!!!&quot; (waiving around an alg on a 
napkin)
-At the airport security: &quot;Uh... Sir/Maam, please open that bag and 
empty the contents.&quot; Pulls out a cube, and another, and another, and 
another,... as security laughs. (So that&#x27;s the biggest threat to our 
national security, Rubik&#x27;s cubes!)

          <div class="email-content">As you may have noticed, I&#x27;m extremely jet-lagged... it&#x27;s 4:10AM <br>
where I&#x27;m at right now, but I just can&#x27;t sleep too many thoughts <br>
flowing around. Well at least I&#x27;m happy to be back home, I really <br>
did hate the weather in LA. I can&#x27;t handle the humidity nor heat, <br>
which is kinda strange since a lot of my family are from Hong Kong <br>
(very humid place). I definitely won&#x27;t be living or working in CA, <br>
but I might have to be there if I go to Caltech for grad school. I <br>
know a few ppl going there, and was also sharing an office (U-M math <br>
dept) with a student that will be starting grad school there. Ok <br>
that&#x27;s going off topic.<br>
<br>
Just to be a little more organized, here&#x27;s the interesting stuff in <br>
chronological order.<br>
<br>
I worked my way to Caltech around 7pm Friday, and solved the cube <br>
for some overly friendly folks in my shared van shuttle, it was an <br>
18. They quickly asked for the non-pattern, where every side had <br>
every color, I did it, and they were like no, we wanted something <br>
different. &quot;Oh no like colors touching... How do you define touching <br>
(adjacent or also diagonal)?&quot; Then I just timed it from there, <br>
solving and adding the 3 double slices.<br>
<br>
I poked around Baxter Hall for a bit before Tyson came around to <br>
grab me, apparently the Friday get together was said to be at some <br>
other part of campus, which I must say is really small. The <br>
undergraduate student body has about 900! That&#x27;s smaller then my hs. <br>
IN retrospect, I should of printed out a copy of the tentative <br>
schedule. I got in pretty late, the food thing was over. I think I <br>
walked in saying &quot;HI!&quot; and then noticed a camera rolling, <br>
interviewing Ton, ops. I then proceeded inside where the real action <br>
was. Did a couple down cube races, about 8 ppl around a Very well <br>
spaced table with 8 mats. I was very happy to see everybody. Oh and <br>
that Chris, did he do something different to his hair?, lol.<br>
<br>
Well somehow we ended up posing for pictures outside. After another <br>
hr, we started breaking off and I was in a group that wondered <br>
hopelessly for free parking space in order to get to a Starbucks. <br>
Speaking of which, the West coast seems to have a lot of them. I <br>
even saw three, each a block apart, could of been tow on opposite <br>
sides of the street somewhere too. It&#x27;s a bit scary how much of a <br>
monopoly they now have.<br>
<br>
We ended up just going back to the hotel, speedcubed and <br>
speedstacked a bit, well until about 10:30. We all, especially Chris <br>
wanted to get to sleep early for the day to come. I must admit <br>
though, speedstacking is highly addictive and I think he now has me <br>
hooked. I actually couldn&#x27;t sleep much, must of dowsed off around <br>
3:30am PT. Set every alarm clock I had to get up at 7:50, which was <br>
good cuz some of them failed. Some more horribly then others (not <br>
offsetting by the 3hrs or something, doh). I took in a ride to <br>
campus from some ppl I didn&#x27;t know. Headed straight for Baxter Hall, <br>
wanted to get there early to help setup, I knew my way well since I <br>
had just been here the previous evening.<br>
<br>
I kinda like the setup they did, with groups of timer at varing <br>
heights for ppl&#x27;s preference, chairs, etc. The were a couple <br>
problems though. Chris was just too tall for any of it. (I think it <br>
would have trimmed off some hundredths or even tenths if he were to <br>
get a table at comfortable height.) And the last display was missing <br>
a cord and so couldn&#x27;t display the time in large LED to the <br>
audience. Appearently those were all barrowed from Speedstacks. <br>
There were exactly 8 of them, and 8 finalist, it would have been <br>
extremely generous of them to give those out as prizes... :).<br>
<br>
As for the competiton itself, it was all quite a blur for me. <br>
Perhaps I&#x27;ll post the details after a good nights sleep. There was <br>
one thing that stuck though that I forgot to mention in the previous <br>
post. There was one time in the final round (I shouldn&#x27;t say who), <br>
that was an accidental disregard to the judging. Someone hit reset a <br>
split second after he stopped the timmer, and the stop-watch guy was <br>
stunned. I think everyonehad one or two solves that caught a 2s <br>
penalty. It&#x27;s quite sever if you think about it, but there <br>
definately needs to be some sort of penalty. I was absolutely <br>
shocked that one of my solves was DQed for being say a U2 away. No, <br>
+2s for me, as it was written in the rules, the 2s is for One <br>
Quarter turn away (though with some fine print about the <br>
boarderline, which everybody now knows is slightly (only slightly) <br>
different from the old 45 deg rule.) Let me stress that I don&#x27;t <br>
argue with the call or have anythign against the competetion. Yet, <br>
since so many of the finallist were suprised by this call, that <br>
perhaps we as a community need to set different standards.<br>
<br>
That brings me to another point: there are like 20 pages of rules <br>
for speedstacking, while there really isn&#x27;t much standardized policy <br>
out there for cubing, and certainly not in much of an <br>
officalized/centrailized capacity. Even if we paste together a bunch <br>
of popular views from posts/e-mails/sites I doubt we can get 20 <br>
pages of rules in. And anyway you look at it, spedcubing has got to <br>
be more complecated then speedstacking. Well at least I hope so :).<br>
<br>
After the tornament, we all headed out to that Chicken place. Very <br>
good stuff btw. And commandeered  few too many tables. For crowded <br>
cube races, we&#x27;d need to append an extra table. After a while we <br>
were in danger of combining all the tables in the restaruant into <br>
one, lol. Ah, no bussiness for you! Well actually a few of us felt <br>
kinda guilty we were still there a couple hrs after finishing our <br>
food and wanted to buy something. It almost came down to us getting <br>
kicked out at closing, lol.<br>
<br>
I eventually got back to the hotel, and cubed with Ian, Raul, and <br>
Chris until about 3:30am PT. It was a blast.<br>
<br>
The next morning we gradually got together, we hung around the <br>
parking lot and lobby for a long time and then also in Jasmine&#x27;s <br>
room. We were waiting for Macky to show up. We then walked to <br>
Subway&#x27;s for lunch. During which we had our attention on the <br>
Pasadena Star, in which our event and a picture of Jon made the <br>
front page! (Someone please get a scan of it up on the net.)<br>
<br>
There are no shortage of pictrues for you guys that wern&#x27;t there. <br>
I&#x27;m sure ppl will start getting them up after a week or two. I may <br>
take the time to scan in my stuff.<br>
<br>
We walked back to the hotel, and coordinated rides to Macky&#x27;s place. <br>
Notably, while there I played around with Ton&#x27;s working 3x3x5 (as <br>
opposed to those two fake ones that were seen earlier among Macky&#x27;s <br>
friends). I spent forever mixing it, I understood what would <br>
constitute a good scramble for it and how to go about obtaining it <br>
(which is non-trivial, it requires some insight). I freakin&#x27; solved <br>
it on my first attempt!!! This is something for the &quot;Fastest time <br>
from seeing it to solving it,&quot; category in speedcubing.com.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I was preoccupid with finding a shuttle or perhaps <br>
taxicab to the airport, panicing when no place would pickup or found <br>
it to be too far. THen more panic one I was told that the shuttles <br>
require a 24hr reservation :(. I ended up finding something though, <br>
and the cab came by at around 3:30. I was very conflicted, on one <br>
hand I didn&#x27;t want to leave, but I also need to get back to my <br>
life/work and out of that distain wheather.<br>
<br>
Any how, I&#x27;m sure someone will post the rest of what happened to the <br>
group that day.<br>
<br>
My plane trip back was freakin&#x27; amazing, well not at first, but I&#x27;m <br>
saving that up for another post :).<br>

&gt; argue with the call or have anythign against the competetion. Yet,<br>
&gt; since so many of the finallist were suprised by this call, that<br>
&gt; perhaps we as a community need to set different standards.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; That brings me to another point: there are like 20 pages of rules<br>
&gt; for speedstacking, while there really isn&#x27;t much standardized policy<br>
&gt; out there for cubing, and certainly not in much of an<br>
&gt; officalized/centrailized capacity. Even if we paste together a bunch<br>
&gt; of popular views from posts/e-mails/sites I doubt we can get 20<br>
&gt; pages of rules in. And anyway you look at it, spedcubing has got to<br>
&gt; be more complecated then speedstacking. Well at least I hope so :).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; After the tornament, we all headed out to that Chicken place. Very<br>
&gt; good stuff btw. And commandeered  few too many tables. For crowded<br>
&gt; cube races, we&#x27;d need to append an extra table. After a while we<br>
&gt; were in danger of combining all the tables in the restaruant into<br>
&gt; one, lol. Ah, no bussiness for you! Well actually a few of us felt<br>
&gt; kinda guilty we were still there a couple hrs after finishing our<br>
&gt; food and wanted to buy something. It almost came down to us getting<br>
&gt; kicked out at closing, lol.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I eventually got back to the hotel, and cubed with Ian, Raul, and<br>
&gt; Chris until about 3:30am PT. It was a blast.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The next morning we gradually got together, we hung around the<br>
&gt; parking lot and lobby for a long time and then also in Jasmine&#x27;s<br>
&gt; room. We were waiting for Macky to show up. We then walked to<br>
&gt; Subway&#x27;s for lunch. During which we had our attention on the<br>
&gt; Pasadena Star, in which our event and a picture of Jon made the<br>
&gt; front page! (Someone please get a scan of it up on the net.)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; There are no shortage of pictrues for you guys that wern&#x27;t there.<br>
&gt; I&#x27;m sure ppl will start getting them up after a week or two. I may<br>
&gt; take the time to scan in my stuff.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We walked back to the hotel, and coordinated rides to Macky&#x27;s place.<br>
&gt; Notably, while there I played around with Ton&#x27;s working 3x3x5 (as<br>
&gt; opposed to those two fake ones that were seen earlier among Macky&#x27;s<br>
&gt; friends). I spent forever mixing it, I understood what would<br>
&gt; constitute a good scramble for it and how to go about obtaining it<br>
&gt; (which is non-trivial, it requires some insight). I freakin&#x27; solved<br>
&gt; it on my first attempt!!! This is something for the &quot;Fastest time<br>
&gt; from seeing it to solving it,&quot; category in speedcubing.com.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Unfortunately I was preoccupid with finding a shuttle or perhaps<br>
&gt; taxicab to the airport, panicing when no place would pickup or found<br>
&gt; it to be too far. THen more panic one I was told that the shuttles<br>
&gt; require a 24hr reservation :(. I ended up finding something though,<br>
&gt; and the cab came by at around 3:30. I was very conflicted, on one<br>
&gt; hand I didn&#x27;t want to leave, but I also need to get back to my<br>
&gt; life/work and out of that distain wheather.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Any how, I&#x27;m sure someone will post the rest of what happened to the<br>
&gt; group that day.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My plane trip back was freakin&#x27; amazing, well not at first, but I&#x27;m<br>
&gt; saving that up for another post :).<br>

You still have those times from the plane in your notebook, right? Can you email me my time for the 3 in a row? It was 1:21.23? I&#x27;m not sure what the hundredths are, but I wrote them down. I realized that I shattered my old record of 1:54... almost 2 minutes! <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi, David

Sorry to disappoint you, but it is not necessarily the case that the
10 solves, no inspection were an official record.  There were no
standardized scrambles and the competition was not judged officially
because we did not plan on that being an official event.  The times
are still good for submission to Speedcubing, but it&#x27;s not an
&quot;official&quot; competition in the full sense.  This is why it was left off
the official workbook.  Again, sorry for the bad news.

Mark

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m very happy I decided to go. It gave the the greatest sense of <br>
belonging ever. Thanks to Tyson and all the judges for setting it up <br>
for us. If anyone ever asks &quot;Do you ever get bored of cubing?&quot; my <br>
answer is going to be &quot;Not in this lifetime.&quot; :). But I think I do <br>
need to set it aside for a bit to get other stuff done. But I&#x27;ll <br>
probably get addicted to speedstacks (thanks Chris!) for a bit.<br>
<br>
I got to talk to some pretty fasinating people and was especially <br>
impressed with the progress of ChrisH, Macky, Jon, Frank, Ian, <br>
Brent, Evan, and FrankC. That cube robot was amazing, and hopefully <br>
he&#x27;ll be able to make some additional improvements to it. I also <br>
enjoyed the company of Keith, Jasmine, Raul, Ton, and of course <br>
Lars! (People reading the results should note that Lars and I <br>
designed and used our own methods.) I was also amazed at how fast <br>
the CF-abled ppl could solve corners. I am going to have to practice <br>
CF more to contend with FrankC and Macky in it.<br>
<br>
Items I am definately getting include: a stackmat, speedstackcups, a <br>
new Rubik&#x27;s brand 4x4, an Eastsheen 5x5, a Skewb (maybe, they are <br>
quite evil though), a new 3x3 (of course), a 2x2x3, and a 3x3x5. Or <br>
perhaps just the materials to build them myself. (That appears to <br>
total up to over $400! Yikes.)<br>
<br>
Time to save up money for a trip to Florida... assuming that&#x27;s where <br>
the next major even will be held.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mark,

   Why?

   I don&#x27;t understand. Before the tournament I requested that it be
included in the &quot;open&quot; category, and I was told that it would be held
if there was time. 

   I was not told that it would not be an official event. If it had
been decided to exclude it, I&#x27;d like to know why I wasn&#x27;t told, and
what the reason for excluding it was.

   Regards,

David J

and we had more races that night at Caltech (the campus is beautiful). The <br>
barbecue was fun but it was hard to get people away from their cubes to eat (I <br>
guess cubing is more important than eating). The competition was intense <br>
and everyone did their best. Congratulations to Jon Morris and Macky and <br>
everyone else for a great performance. The Saturday night cubing party at the <br>
chicken place was fun. Sunday afternoon some of us went to Macky&#x27;s house <br>
and cubed during the afternoon. I&#x27;d like to thank Macky&#x27;s mom for being a <br>
great host and making some great food. We had green tea ice cream and fruit <br>
kabobs during the afternoon and then some great homemade sushi for <br>
dinner.<br>
<br>
I hope to see everyone at future competitions!<br>

I am all for tiles, the stickers they make now are pretty 
lousy. &quot;Best Quality Stickers&quot; pfft!
So i say we should give it a shot. Although would these tiles would 
probably bring about a large increase in price, as they now have to 
modify their production line.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, David

It was decided very early on that &quot;open&quot; events were not going to be
official.  I am pretty sure this was a well-known fact.  Maybe I am
wrong: I am very tired right now.  If you want, you can ask Tyson, I
guess, but he&#x27;ll probably say the same thing.  I don&#x27;t know what else
I can really tell you.  Oh, and sorry I used &quot;official&quot; too much in my
last post :-P.

Salutations,

Mark

          <div class="email-content">some friends and I worked on making our own tiles a
little bit this summer.  By making our own molds, and
using polyurithane we were able to make quality
&#x27;clear&#x27; tiles, but not colored because we didn&#x27;t have
time to find a good dye to mix with the polyurithane. 
I&#x27;m sure nasco sells this.  When I finish moving to
TN. (I&#x27;m leaving tommorow) I will buy some more
supplies and post on the results.

There would be advantages and disadvantages to making
your own tiles:

Advantages:
*You can texture your molds any way you want. (i.e.
make your own logo tile)
*Molds last a long time.
*You can mass produce your own tiles.

Disadvantages:
*Making quality molds can be time consuming.
*polyurithane isn&#x27;t cheap.  (45$ a gallon is the price
I think) but you can make a lot of tiles with that.

The molds didn&#x27;t seem to wear after using them, at
least not too noticebly.  I experimented with molding
my own 3x3 pieces, and they turned out decent. I tried
them in a cube and they worked OK.  As soon as I
figure out the whole tile process a little better I
can post in detail.  Will probably even sell sets for
cheap to my fellow speedcubers. (5$+s.h. sound good?) 
We&#x27;ll see how quality they end up when I figure it out
well.

I agree... The competition truly did rock.  I had a great time.  
Thank you, Tyson, for doing such a great job.  My only regret is that 
I was too nervous to truly compete with Macky!  Nerves played a big 
part once again in the final round.  Just like in Toronto.  Any one 
of us that made it to the round could&#x27;ve won.  It was great seeing 
everyone again and meeting the California croud.

I&#x27;ll update my website some time in the next three or four days.

hardware store (ie. home depot, lowes, etc.) and look for electrical

I just purchased my second cube, (I have used my first one for about 
2 months now, stickers are nearly clear now) So I finally felt safe 
to pop my first one open.  So I removed my old stickers (what was 
left of them), and sanded down a few rough spots with some 600 grit,

I would like to know where I can get some good stickers to put on

I have seen much improvement in its motion, but I was wondering if 
anyone had other suggestions for improving my cube

Thanks alot,

          <div class="email-content">Yup, I love electrical tape. It&#x27;s my stickering of choice for the 
past 4 years. The consences is that Orange is hard to find though. 
The look of my cube was quite popular at Nationals. Although it 
takes a lot of time to get the stickers cut out just right, I think 
it&#x27;s worth it. Only needs to be done once, then I replace a few 
every week or two to maintain the look.

Ok, I am really starting to get frustrated here... I ordered a <br>
Stackmat timer a few weeks ago in the UK store of speedstacks. Since <br>
then, I heard nothing. No respons at all. No confirmation e-mail. <br>
Nothing. I tried mailing some persons and I tried asking questions <br>
about this via the helpdesk on their site, but I don&#x27;t get anything <br>
back. The weird thing is, when asked them some questions (e-mail) <br>
about payment methods (before I ever ordered), I did get answers, so <br>
there must be some ppl alive there. Has anyone else here ordered a <br>
timer at the UK store, and how long did it take before you got a <br>
respons?<br>

Hi Evan,

   Thanks for bringing this up. Yes, Seven Towns is the place to make
the suggestion of making tiled cubes. I&#x27;d also suggest that they go
with a plastic at least as good as the Deluxe&#x27;s. It would be great if
they simply made the Deluxe again. There&#x27;s no legal impediment because
they purchased the rights from Ideal. 

   I&#x27;ve suggested tiles to them two or three times. If there is
sufficient interest they might do it.

   I think it would be neat if they made the tiles interchangeable,
that is, easy to take off and on, while sitting snugly when in use.
   This would allow for more color schemes, not just the &quot;official&quot;
scheme adopted a few years ago, but also the first &quot;official&quot; color
scheme found on the Deluxes, Rubik&#x27;s Game cubes, the original Revenge
cubes, the 2x2x2, and C*4 cubes, and people wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with one
color scheme.

   Also it would allow them to sell specialty tiles like &quot;Holiday&quot;
tiles. I can see a Christmas cube all sparkly. This would not dilute
their brand image any more than all the commercial advertising cubes
they sell. People see a Deluxe in sunlight and they are impressed with
how beautiful it is. If it costs them a little more to make these in
limited numbers, I think that&#x27;s OK, because it&#x27;s a normal business
practice, besides a deluxe stands out, like the luxury version of a
standard automobile.

   At the Nationals 35 people asked me if I would sell them a Deluxe,
or a Deluxe Rubik&#x27;s Game cube.

   I would think that if everyone who is interested asked Seven Towns
they just might do it. If they did it as a kit they wouldn&#x27;t have to
pay anyone to assemble them.

   If they won&#x27;t produce a tiled cube maybe they would go for
producing high-quality tiles that go on like stickers.

Hi Mark,

   That&#x27;s all right; it&#x27;s just a misunderstanding. I was thinking of
&quot;official&quot; within the World Cubing Association rules.

   You and Tyson and the others did an excellent job. Now get some
sleep! :)

David J

Perhaps at a future tournament, we might be able to extend official

It may be something that needs to be addressed more clearly.

          <div class="email-content">That actually sounds pretty good. I was never a big fan of tiles, 
but now that I think of it, it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;ve never seen

easily, some colors are too light for my liking, and the center ones 
have holes. Taking them off cheaper cubes is too much work and 
supports somethig that is a knock-off. The ones on the Deluxe/Game 
cubes look nice except for the peg holes that would throw me off 
(might not even be able to install them on a standard cube).

Speaking of tiels, that reminds me of how many times I cut myself 
using a razorblade when trying to re-scheme Meffert&#x27;s cubes. Having 
some way of putting on and off tiles interchangeably would be 
awsome, avoiding the super-glue.

I would like to support this effort!

I emailed 7 Towns yesterday on the issue about tiles. They told me 
that they are still considering it, but it may be a limited edition 
type of cube. Just thought that you guys might like to know. By the 
way, Doug, how long does it take you to peel off all the tiles on the 
Meffert&#x27;s cube? I bought one of my friend and I am only done peeling 
one side 0-O. Ahaha, Evan, cubes with cheap tiles on them rule! 
(that&#x27;s what I do)

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Here is a way of how I make cube stickers and tile or nail polish <br>
protection. I tried it on some of my cubes and they work awesome.<br>
<br>
Tiles/Stickers/Nail Polish<br>
 <br>
All you have to do is put on a coating of Transparent Nail Polish <br>
Protector. It works awesome. This is what I do with my Hungarian <br>
Arxon cube, all the stickers will last forever (well almost, haha) <br>
and however you touch it or rub or even dip in hot water, it&#x27;ll <br>
always stay on. BUT some logo&#x27;s might smear if the ink is really old. <br>
Just thought that everyone would want a cube that don&#x27;t need to much <br>
sticker changing :)~<br>

Hi everybody,<br>
<br>
Ok, I am really starting to get frustrated here... I ordered a <br>
Stackmat timer a few weeks ago in the UK store of speedstacks. Since <br>
then, I heard nothing. No respons at all. No confirmation e-mail. <br>
Nothing. I tried mailing some persons and I tried asking questions <br>
about this via the helpdesk on their site, but I don&#x27;t get anything <br>
back. The weird thing is, when asked them some questions (e-mail) <br>
about payment methods (before I ever ordered), I did get answers, so <br>
there must be some ppl alive there. Has anyone else here ordered a <br>
timer at the UK store, and how long did it take before you got a <br>
respons?<br>

<br>
I am working on learning the F2L, and I had a question about it.<br>

I am solving it with the cross down, and I notice that a lot of the <br>
time all of my corner pieces will be in that bottom layer, but in the <br>
wrong position (ie. the white-red-blue piece will be in the white-red-<br>

Is the best way to work through this to take 3 extra moves and, move <br>
a misplaced corner piece back up to the top layer so I can pair it up <br>
and insert it?<br>

          <div class="email-content">It is better to either pair them the first 2 turns (preferably 2nd), 
then put them in together... or to know the corner down into a 
position where it can be easily triggered back in with the 
corresponding edge piece.

Learn the c/e Pairing algorithms... I recommend either off rubiks.dk 
or speedcubing.com, in that order of preference. Print them out, 
carry them everywhere with you as I do for the ZB algs.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,

   It takes all of ten minutes to get used to the tiles with peg holes
in the Deluxe Rubik&#x27;s Game cubes. They really improve the grip. 

   To pry off the the center tiles on the Deluxe I use a 5/8 inch wood
chisel which is very sharp, so I wear work gloves.

   To reglue tiles I use Elmers glue, not epoxy. A friend of mine
epoxied the center tiles on one of my Deluxe cubes and I&#x27;ve only been
able to get two of them off again. Very frustrating.

   At the nationals I was shown a regular cube with tiles added and it
looked like one of the tiles was split. If epoxy was used it might be
hard to get the split one off, but maybe not if the underside is flat.
On the Deluxe the underside of the tile isn&#x27;t flat, and it sits in an
indentation.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi Andrew

I use an intuitive F2L. What I mean is I use 3-4 intuitive moves
to pair corner and edge in the top layer and then another 3-4
moves to place them. Normally 6-7 moves in total.
Thank you Lars Vandenbergh for your superb advice!
If the corner is in the bottom layer {FDR} there a several 
possibilities:

1) Edge in top layer. In this case I turn the top layer, do 3
   moves to pair them in the top layer.

2) Edge in wrong middle layer slot. If possible I choose another pair.
   If not I bring the corner up with RUR&#x27;.

3) Edge in correct middle layer slot. In many of these cases
   the fastest way is to use a special algorithm. I don&#x27;t because
   a 20-25s F2L is good enough for me.
   The only special algorithm I use is RUR&#x27;U&#x27; RUR&#x27;U&#x27; RUR&#x27;.
   This alg. is very fast for me (4 moves/s), but this for a
   completely different case.

          <div class="email-content">Here is my solution to this if you don&#x27;t have any special algs. I 
read it on some site, but I forget which one. This improved my f2l 
times from 20 to about 15 seconds.

So you have a peice, either a corner or edge that is in the wrong 
slot, and you have the other peice free in the top layer.  Start the 
algorithm as if the peice is in the correct slot.  Then when the 
peices are paired up, or in the position so that you can do R U R&#x27; 
or L&#x27; U&#x27; L to get them, stop the algorithm, and move them over to 
the correct slot.

Hope this helps

          <div class="email-content"> on the twisty forum someone made a post (David, was that you?) about 
the reason why rubiks.com wont remake the deluxe cube.  In all 
honesty i am very supportive in rubiks decision.  Basically it was 
this...  Instead of selling 2 types of cubes at two different prices 
where one cube is crappy and the other one is awesome, they are 
working on making one great cube at one price.  I aplaud the efforts 
rubiks has done in the past year to the cubes to make them what they 
are today.  So basically i think it is quite unreasonable to ask them 
to release the deluxe cube after all there efforts they have done and 
will continue to do.  THese new cubes are awesome and people arent 
giving them the credit they disserve.  


As far as tiles go... i think it is quite fair to ask rubiks to start 
producing tile sets.  Their stickers are still not good.  Theyre 
better but not good.

But that is just my opinion and tastes.  I like dill pickles with 
mustard.

          <div class="email-content">YES! This is exactly one of the things that I wanted to say... I 
call it &#x27;picking up&#x27; a corner or an edge the most efficient wy. All 
F2L cases end up being 4 patterns, and you als can create these 
patterns when the pieces are in the wrong slot.

1. First of all, you should be sure there&#x27;s not a very easy CE pair 
in the top layer. However, sometimes it can be faster to just solve 
the first oppertunity you see, because searching for another CE pair 
can cost time.
2. When a corner is in the wrong slot, and it&#x27;s corresponding edge 
is in another slot, a different appoach is to adjust D layer to pair 
them up, do RUR&#x27;, en then solve them together (after putting D layer 
back in it&#x27;s correct position). This is usefull when (almost) all 
F2L pieces are not in the U layer, so I don&#x27;t use it very often.

Well, then they wouldn&#x27;t be selling the Japanese packaging would 
they? The price of it is different from the standard cube price. 
Plus, they didn&#x27;t have any problems making it back then, then why 
would it be a problem now? Just wondering~

          <div class="email-content">Hey all-<br>
I&#x27;ve been working on a website for the past few days, and I must say <br>
it&#x27;s looking pretty good. Of course, it is a cube site :) Only <br>
problem is I don&#x27;t have a host.<br>
<br>
Does anybody know any good free hosts? I checked Aplus, and they <br>
dont offer free hosting services. Geocities, I don&#x27;t really like <br>
it... Their bandwidth is nowhere near enough for video and pictures <br>
and applets, etc etc. 741.com&#x27;s ads are horrible, my whole site is <br>
full of them since I use iframes. Ugh... Ads = BAD. And ASP won&#x27;t <br>
let me view my page! What&#x27;s up with that? I can log onto the FTP but <br>
I can&#x27;t access my page. Totally weird. Freewebs? Psh, you can&#x27;t even <br>
upload videos because the upload limit is so small.<br>
<br>
Would anybody be kind enough to inform me of a nice free host w/ <br>
little ads? Thank you!!<br>

That&#x27;s a directory. Have a look at what services you need, pick some 
5-10 hosts, have a look at which suits you best. Steer away from 
obviously crappy sites. You may have to look a while before you find 
one that is good.

I&#x27;ve been to this site. and about 5 others just like this one. The

Just curious, what do most of the people here use? If you have a

   Why are you putting forward the idea that one cube has to be
crappy? Ideal&#x27;s regular cubes improved after the Deluxe was developed.

   Why is it unreasonable? You haven&#x27;t given me a reason.

> giving them the credit they disserve.

   I got some a year ago. I mentioned their improvements on the twisty
forum *last year*, and even recently applauded their efforts. Haven&#x27;t
I been saying enough good things about them?  I don&#x27;t think that your
agrument here is fair to me.

   I showed their new cubes, nicely worked in and lubed, to lots of
people at the nationals this last weekend, I said it never pops, and I
let people try it out and compare it to several other cubes. What&#x27;s
the problem? I have&#x27;t been knocking their new cubes, but I will not
say that they are good as the Deluxe because they aren&#x27;t.

   I&#x27;d like to see translucent tiles.

          <div class="email-content">another option is to create a server, run apache on it, and run your
site from there. you&#x27;d have to do some research on how to keep your
box secure, but other than that its a good option. id probably make a
separate box and not run it off of your main computer. and you&#x27;d
probably want to buy a domain name so people dont have to go to some
abstract website like http://34.2432.5443254364e. etc...

only do this if you have a box laying around.

Hi Eivind-



I&#x27;ve been to this site. and about 5 others just like this one. The 

upload limit on these things are horrible. 

Just curious, what do most of the people here use? If you have a

stuff are ever good.

There&#x27;s a reason those hosts are free.  You get what you pay for, and
if you don&#x27;t pay, then don&#x27;t expect a whole lot.  Keep this in mind as
you are looking, and don&#x27;t expect many good hosts to be free.  If you
can&#x27;t afford to pay, you&#x27;ll have to settle for something less than
what you wanted.

Okay yeah.

          <div class="email-content"> Geez David, this post wasn&#x27;t directed towards you or anybody, or <br>
meant to be hurtful.  Are my posts comming off that offensive???  I&#x27;m <br>
not trying to piss anyone off when i reply to a message, it&#x27;s all a <br>
matter of opinion.  I&#x27;m not blaming anyone here for anything and <br>
David, I think you took my post too seriously.  <br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t believe i need to defend my earlier post but for some odd <br>
reason people get all whinny and complainy and feel that my reasoning <br>
isn&#x27;t fair.  What?!?  I am now supposed to also include legitimate <br>
and fair opinions that satisfy others to what they want to hear!?!  <br>
GREAT!!!<br>
<br>
The funny thing is that this has happened to me so many times over <br>
the past several years that i&#x27;m actually getting fed up.  So i invite <br>
everyone to join my new yahoo group where you can go and just chew me <br>
out.  Feel free to disect my posts and turn my words against me.  <br>
Feel free to ridicule me and make fun of my stupidity.  <br>
<br>
So now if you have a problem with me or the way i post my messages, <br>
just swing on over to my group...  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll post the link soon<br>

Much Love and Joy<br>

Buying a domain name isn&#x27;t necessary.  I host mine off of a homemade web 
server, and I use http://www.no-ip.org for free URL direction.  You can 
get http://whatever.no-ip.com or .org or .net or whatever you want.

          <div class="email-content">That &#x27;s an excellent tip. Also, for those of you in college, there 
is usually a generous amount of web space that is availible to you 
(I have a combined 500MBs! and unlimited bandwidth), check with your 
college. As I have offerend to ppl at Pasadena, if you have some 
cube related video&#x27;s or whatever that requires a lot of space I may 
be able to help out and post the stuff for you, so that you can 
deeplink into my public space from your site :).

          <div class="email-content">Great point Doug-
That&#x27;s about the best suggestion, only problem is I don&#x27;t go to 
college. (Doug, you met me!! US Nationals? The weird kid that 
said &quot;whoa! your cube is rounded! And you buffed it!&quot;) 

I have been considering the server for a quite a while now. I have 
apache running on my computer. Only problem is that I can&#x27;t leave it 
on 24/7. I also use no-ip (took me forever to find that thing!)

I think I&#x27;ll find a &quot;box&quot; somewhere, and hook it up... My router has 
another port open anyways. In the meantime, since I know all of you 
are itching to find out what&#x27;s gonna be ont he site, try 
http://geocities.com/h4m573r1   It hs links and stuff but none of 
them work. Except for the part titled &quot;links&quot;... base target is 
awesome.  And to avoid some questions such as &quot;did you really make 
that?!&quot; or &quot;what program did you use?&quot; Let me answer those. Yes, I 
did make it. (Okay, I&#x27;m serious... way too many people asked me 
this) and I used notepad (if you want IM me on AIM @ H4M573R00 if 
you think Frontpage or Dreamweaver is better. Let me warn you, I&#x27;m 
persuasive ;) )

Thanks for all your suggestions!!

about a 45 minute drive due east.  It would be a day of swimming, <br>
bbq, and of course cubing.  And if someone brought it, maybe ps2 or <br>

          <div class="email-content">So on the plane ride home, I was quite distraught. I spent the first <br>
half of the trip cubing hardcore. The seat tray actaully makes for a <br>
great cube table, especially if you put a stackmat on it (my <br>
neighboring seat was empty so it was enough room).<br>
<br>
This was probably found to be quite annoying to the back half of the <br>
travellers... a constant loud noise that neer seems to stop. People <br>
just hopped that I would eventually get bored, but we all know that <br>
doesn&#x27;t happen. See, to us cubers, we can fall asleep listening to <br>
cube noise... it&#x27;s a kinda white noise.<br>
<br>
Over two hours of cubing! Drives people around me insane. But when <br>
the sun went down and ppl started going to sleep I stopped (I&#x27;m not <br>
that inconsiderate).<br>
<br>
I felt like doing a blindfold solve, but I was out of practice. So I <br>
did a warm up where I&#x27;d take two looks, one to orientate everything, <br>
and one to permute everything. That worked and memorization for each <br>
part was blazingly fast for me. So I decided to give it a full go, <br>
planning to fail miserably as always.<br>
<br>
After about 15min of memorization and 15min of solving I was pretty <br>
sure I&#x27;d come out seeing some jumbled mess of a cube. I had so many <br>
layers of shirts and blankets on my head just to make sure I was <br>
completely blinded and could fully concentrate that I could have <br>
suffocated, lol. It really freaked out the flight attendants and <br>
neighbors.<br>
<br>
So long story short, I finished just before landing, so cabinet <br>
lights were on. This caused quite a commotion as, about 10 people <br>
were staring at me in amazement. I didn&#x27;t get any applauses of <br>
course, nor was I expecting people to notice to much. I think people <br>
were just so stunned about it.<br>
<br>
My first blindfold success! I was so excited, and blindfold cubing <br>
is now so very addictive. I&#x27;d like to make up some unofficial club <br>
for that type of stuff (blindfold solving on a plane): how <br>
about &quot;blind mile-high club&quot;... I don&#x27;t know.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah... just a quick estimation: First corner can be in one of 8 
spots, second in 7 and so on. Same for edges. Each corner can be 
oriented 3 ways, each edge 2 ways. So there are
(8*7*6*5) * (8*7*6*5) * 3^4 * 2^4 = 3,657,830,400
possible situations.

Assume with rotating the cube around y you can save a factor 4, 
inversing another factor 2, mirroring another factor 2. Still leaves 
you with 457,228,800 situations.

If you could solve that with two equally powerful steps then each 
would have to solve sqrt(457,228,800) = 21383 situations. So you&#x27;d 
need to learn 2*21383 = 42766 algorithms. Have fun with that ;-)

Wait! Actually you could save that factor 8 twice, once for each 
step. But you&#x27;d still have to learn 15120 algorithms...

Btw, is there really somebody trying to learn algorithms for all 
those 1211 LL cases?

Cheers!
Stefan

had to move on. Now I&#x27;m really happy. I found my current host on <br>
www.webhostlist.de which is a site comparing lots of hosts. I chose <br>
one with extremely positive user comments (300 positive, one <br>
negative, few neutral). This is for Germany though, but maybe <br>
there&#x27;s one for other areas? Maybe tophosts.com or <br>

well, then you could share it. For example, the &quot;Budget Hosting&quot; 
link from tophosts.com points to an offer where you pay $8 each 
month but you get 1GB space and 100GB transfer and support, PHP, 
MySQL etc. That&#x27;s enough for many people, so if you find 7 friends 
then each of you pays a buck a month. Eat one cheeseburger less each 
month, that&#x27;s also healthier ;-)

On a solved cube setup by: (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;)

Pairing on the first move is done by doing (F&#x27;), but this is not 
that helpful. By doing (RU&#x27;) you pair on the second move and leave 
something easier to finish off.

It&#x27;s just a rough rule of thumb that works in many cases (those not 
trivial but not overly compicated), just something I was saying from 
general experience, but it does oversimplify things. It really 
depends on the case, just something to do when in doubt for 
beginners.

<br>
I know people are trying new things, e.g. Ron learning algs for the <br>
ZB system. My question was specifically for those 1211 algs needed <br>
for a 1-look-LL.<br>
<br>
Prabhat said in his post &quot;some people actually try to memorize all <br>
1211 LL algs&quot; and I&#x27;d just like to know where he got it from. I <br>
don&#x27;t know anyone who&#x27;s going for this. Are you? Name one person who <br>
is. Prabhat, maybe you can answer this?<br>
<br>
&gt; I find those computations a bit <br>
&gt; sketchy, and it was never stated what precisely this computation <br>
is <br>
&gt; for... it sounded like (LL + 1 c/e pair?).<br>
<br>
Yes it was stated. In the posts I replied to. It&#x27;s for a 2-look F2L <br>
after the cross, i.e. for solving all four c/e pairs with two looks. <br>
And yes it was intended to be sketchy, that&#x27;s why I said &quot;just a <br>
quick estimation&quot; :-)<br>
<br>
Btw, I just realized you could shrink the number of algs even more <br>
when you allow a U-setup-turn since that&#x27;s not really much different <br>
than a cube rotation and we don&#x27;t count it for OLL/PLL either. Would <br>
shrink it by another factor of four I think.<br>

y (L&#x27; U2 L) y (L U2 L&#x27;) until now, which is of course a lot uglier 
thanks to the cube rotations and the double turns.

I&#x27;m sorry, yestarday was a hard day for me, and I guess the post is 
what sent me over the edge.  I&#x27;m just sick of being caught up in 
subjects that turn ugly.  THis shoud not be a hostile group, and i 
really don&#x27;t want to see anyone get upset over anything.  Sure, i did 
my share of fueling, but this has not been the first time, and i 
guess it wont be the last.

My earlier post was not to knock down those who are for the deluxe 
being reborn.  I was just trying to show what this is like for the 
company and their reasonings behind all this.  I&#x27;m not trying to 
discourage consumers from voicing their ideas and opinions to the 
companies.  My point was to show that rubiks is just working on 
making one really good cube.  It shows that quality is very important 
to them.  

We also must realize that this is not 82 again.  The cube was a world 
wide hit.  Cubes were being leveled off of the shelves.  The demand 
for cubes was much higher back then than they will probably ever be.  
The companies back then were releasing puzzle after puzzle because 
that was what the fad was.  Today, the cube fad isnt all that 
popular.  Its climbing back, but it still isn&#x27;t big enough for the 
companies to pump out puzzle after puzzle like they used too.  

Thats all i&#x27;m trying to say.

championship 2003 I successfully did a rubik&#x27;s revenge blindfold but 
I can&#x27;t remember the accurate time (I think it was about 19 min or 
so).
Con. for your first blindfold solve, I hope to see you improve so 
our blindfold cubing community will grow up a bit more.

wasn&#x27;t allowed to post because some lightning fast moderator deleted <br>
my crap message. Anyways...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve got a site under works. It&#x27;s availible for the moment on www.<br>
aligulac.net/consite ... and the section you guys are probably more <br>
interested in is on www.aligulac.net/consite/rubikscube . I was <br>
planning on not telling you until it was done, but what the heck, <br>
there are so many site posts running about right now anyway.<br>
<br>
The two things I want to publish at my site are:<br>
<br>
- A big solution method directory. Since I&#x27;m tired of having different <br>
methods availible on different sites and in different formats.<br>
- A big &quot;tips&quot; directory. For much the same reason as above.<br>
<br>
In addition, I could make something along the lines of a &quot;insert day <br>
of the week here&quot; contest. Where the site automatically generates all <br>
sorts of statistics, tables, hall of fames, whatever you can think of. <br>
Sounds nice? I think it sounds nice.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to get the communitys input on some of my ideas. And, if <br>
you find gross errors on the one page I&#x27;ve already finished, do shout <br>
out. :)<br>

week from Canada to show our Swing Dancing
Documentary, and our Rubik&#x27;s Cube documentary (Minds
Behind Cubing) is in post production (editing).

We are still at it, our Swing Doc required a little
more work, so we had to go back and complete it.

Our website will be updated by the end of the summer.

succesfully yesterday... The problem was that I couldn&#x27;t change the

Doug is right (I don&#x27;t say that often...:P), it&#x27;s not
fair to set boundaries on the human mind.  It is
capable of many things.  And knowing more algs doesn&#x27;t
necessarily mean faster times also this is true.  This
is the part that makes me most worried about learning
such a massive heap of algs.  For it to be worthy
while, you would have to recognize them insanely fast,
and execute them pretty fast too.  I suppose this is
where the practice comes in.

Hey ppl, let us know if you or anyone you know is specifically trying

Doug, I mean seriously printing out all algs and sitting day and night

          <div class="email-content">NO, I asked the same question with a lot of responses about 2 yrs 
ago. There is no such algorithm, so maybe you should invent one for 
us! At the very least it is possible for 1 or 2 people in the world 
to know how to do such a thing but are keeping it secret. As for me, 
I honestly have no idea, that&#x27;s why I had asked this a while ago.

As for your last comment of &quot;check alg&quot;, I have no idea what you 
mean. it is very easy to check orientation parity after F2L, the 
permutation parity takes a bit more figuring, but once you have the 
F2L it is not too bad. And of course it is possible to check for 
both after getting to the segmented-3x3, but these checks are quite 
tedius. Except the check for edge flip parity is not too bad, just 
reading off 12 bits and counting off it&#x27;s parity. (This might take 
about 8s so it is still not worth when speed is of the essence.)

          <div class="email-content">I really don&#x27;t see where this question is going... how does knowing 
the answer to that make you sleep any better. Besides, to go about 
learning all the LL algs is not something I would imagine a person 
does that directly. If a person were to make such an attempt at all 
it would probably be because they already know a good chunk of LL 
algs.

Purposely not defining what I mean by &quot;a lot of LL algs,&quot; I am going 
to pretty arbitrarily make a list of cubist that I know or would 
assume (making a guess at from what I&#x27;ve heard either directly or 
indirectly, but mostly indirectly and without sufficient evidence... 
so this is pretty shady and is not menat to put down or single out 
any one) &quot;a lot of LL algs&quot;:

Ron, DanH, LarsV, LarsP, DougL, Macky, RyanH, Zbigniew, AndyC.

I have left out those who have expressed that they do not wish to 
learn any more algs even if they know a lot already. Also this is 
not in any particular order. As a rule of thumb, anybody who has 
been speedcubing for over say 4-5 years and still &quot;(interested)/
(willing to learn more)/(advancing)&quot; are potentially gonna learn 
tons of algs and at some point it is of course possible to learn 
every single one of those wicked 1211.

The very thought of IMPOSSIBLE is usually used so arbitrarily and is 
really just RELATIVE. I&#x27;m sure at some point you thought it would be 
impossible to learn all the PLLs, but perhaps not, only becuase you 
know a lot of people know the PLLs do you think it is possible. If I 
had you think that there are dozens of people that know the 1211, 
you (or someone else who normally wouldn&#x27;t) would try to go out and 
learn them too. It is sent into the realm of POSSIBLE.

Why don&#x27;t we all just continue progressing without all ways 
considering the LIMITS. Thinking too much about what is possible or 
what is impossible is SOOO VERY detrimental to one&#x27;s success. 
Instead think about RISK and WORTH. Is it worth it to learn 1211 
algs FOR YOU? It&#x27;s is worth something different to different 
people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

          <div class="email-content">What I meant is how easy is it after you&#x27;ve complted the F2L to know 
which algorithm you need. Whereas you need none, or edge flipper, 
edge swap, or edge swap + edge flipper.

The Edge Flip is Very easy to see but now it is to see if you require 
to swap it with another. I&#x27;m not sure how this can be done.

there is an alg that fixes both &quot;errors&quot; at once. It was found by 
Stefan Pochmann and I think he posted it here some time ago.
Have a look at

It works.

          <div class="email-content">Hey All,<br>
<br>
I posted a similar question to the Caltech Rubik&#x27;s group without much <br>
response, so I&#x27;m moving here.  I&#x27;m looking to buy a 5x5x5 cube, but <br>
they&#x27;re pretty damn expensive so I want to make sure I get one better <br>
than my current one.  I have an eastsheen mini 5x5x5 which feels very <br>
well built (and looks very well built from the inside) and turns very <br>
slick, but is terrible with misalignment and is really too small for my <br>
hands.  I can&#x27;t break 7:30 on it, using the same method I use to average <br>
about 2:15 on the 4x4x4.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m thinking of getting one from Rubiks.com, which would be the safe bet <br>
regarding tournament-legality.  But, I have heard from a few people that <br>
the full-sized Eastsheens are better.  I haven&#x27;t used either, but I have <br>
a Rubiks.com 4x4x4 and have used an Eastsheen 4x4x4, and I have to say <br>
that I like the Eastsheen more.  Also, I&#x27;ve heard that the <br>
&quot;Bandelow/Whan Cube, original 1983 version&quot; (straight from Ton&#x27;s site) <br>
is very good, but 50 Euro is a lot (!) and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s _that_ <br>
much better than anything else thats, umm, a little more reasonable.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m looking to buy an Eastsheen 4x4x4 just for kicks, so it would be <br>
good if I could order that and the 5x5x5 at the same time.  I really <br>
should&#x27;ve tried a 5x5x5 at the July 10 competition while I had the chance...<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Doug<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I&#x27;ll try to give a clear anser to this clear question.

Once you have the F2L, I would line up a corner or two and then 
check if you need a 3-cycle (even), 2-cycle (odd), or the corners 
are permuted correctly relative to each other (even). (That is a 
very quick check and can be quicker once you apply some more 
advanced things from pattern recognition.) Then you do the same for 
edges: 4-cycle (odd), 3-cycle (even), two 2-cycles (even), one 2-
cycle (odd), or edges placed (even).

What matters is parity, if the edge parity matches the corner parity 
then your ok, if not you need to do a single-edge-flip parity 
correction. It&#x27;s really not that difficult to check, but it takes a 
bit of getting used to and will cost up to 2 seconds.

Don&#x27;t try making someone feel like shit for asking
questions...I think the effort you put into learning
all your algorithms pushed what little you know about
consideration out of your head.

Jasmine&#x27;s site and Evan site are grat resources for beginner 
methods. 
Not be competing, but I also posted a beginner method. 
http://cube3.tk

I just made the site so there&#x27;s no content at the moment. 
Also, feel free to contact me (contact information is at the bottom 
of the beginner method page) about specific questions. :)

Happy cubing!

          <div class="email-content">Greetings All,

   The focus of the mind is specifically limited like a lens which in
part blocks out light so to have precisely the light it wants and no
more. The human eye feeds the brain 150 million bits of data per
second. You make conscious that which you focus on.

   The memory is similar. In the 1950s it was demonstrated the the
subconscious mind records everything a person perceives. In the late
1970s and early 1980s Karl Pribram showed that the holographic model
of memory storage satisfied many of of the requirements of the human
memory model. In the early 1990s it was shown that there is no
theoretical limit to the amount of information that can be stored
holographically.

   The recall function of memory becomes then a practice of efficient
access. For abstracts the primary access is related to comrehension.
The more you understand the more you can understand. 

  IQ tests fool people into thinking that intelligence and the
capabilities of inteligence, like memory and comprehension, is a fixed
thing. I also think that sometimes people settle on a memory model
which is not the best and then think it&#x27;s the only model.

   To a certain extent I&#x27;m going after that &quot;1211&quot; but not the way
that people think. First off I&#x27;m not just copying everyone else&#x27;s
algorithms, I&#x27;m using my own. Second, I&#x27;m employing a method that
isn&#x27;t so neatly linear. Third, although some of my solutions are far
less than optimal and use several algs to solve LL positions it is not
uncommon for me to recognize what is needed to solve a position in one
 look. 

   In the end I may skipping LL entirely.

Regards,

David J

because the third cube was my slowest.

And who says the UK doesnt have a chance?

          <div class="email-content">Sounds like a good idea.  I guess that the handicap will be based off of the
average on Speedcubing.com?  I like the idea of the handicapped competition;
I&#x27;ve just never quite understood how exactly it works.  So if someone would
be willing to post an explanation, that would be great.

I would like to see some king of handicapped contest... to make it 
an even chance for anyone to win, no matter how fast they can solve 
the cube.

          <div class="email-content">I also think is a splendid idea. Now all we need to do is find out 
how this is going to work, find somebody to organize it (I would

          <div class="email-content">Maybe I&#x27;ll do both.  Or maybe a mix of the two.  Handicapped average of 100
solves.  I&#x27;ll think about it.  In the meantime, more suggestions. I know
there are more people out there that have an opinion on this.

average of 100 solves sounds good :)

          <div class="email-content">Like all other cubers, I want to get faster. Obviously, lots of <br>
practice will help this, but in an aim to be more strategic I <br>
thought I would try and work out specific areas to focus on. Prior <br>
to Worlds last year, a big part of my slowness was that I just <br>
didn&#x27;t know enough algs. Now I&#x27;m using a 3-look LL, so lack of algs <br>
is not the reason I can&#x27;t get sub-30s times (or rarely ever get <br>
these times). I had thought that a big part of my problem now is <br>
that I just don&#x27;t turn the cube fast enough. I also knew that I <br>
waste a bit of time looking for pieces during the solve. To get a <br>
better idea how much time I&#x27;m wasting, I tried an experiment today. <br>
Here&#x27;s what I did:<br>
<br>
- normal pre-inspection<br>
- did the cross<br>
- paused the timer<br>
- identified the first F2L pair<br>
- started the timer and did the first F2L pair<br>
- repeated the previous two steps for all F2L pairs, and then the <br>
same for orienting the LL edges, then LL corners, then permuting all.<br>
<br>
My aim was to see what my times could be like if I didn&#x27;t waste time <br>
looking for pieces. I was rather surprised by the results: (24.69), <br>
25.09, 26.65, 28.29, 28.66, 28.95, 29.31, 29.89, 30.62, 31.58, <br>
31.98, (32.67) --&gt; 29.10s (the times were not in this order, I just <br>
had to sort them this way for my excel spreadsheet to average the <br>
middle ten).<br>
<br>
A regular average for me would usually have times ranging from ~36 <br>
to 49, with the average being 42-43s. I hadn&#x27;t realised that I was <br>
wasting 13-14s per solve just looking for pieces!! Based on this, if <br>
I just work on looking ahead, I should be able to drop my times <br>
considerably. I felt encouraged by this because it means that I <br>
shouldn&#x27;t have to learn more algs or increase my rate of turns/sec <br>
to get sub-30s times, I just need to practice looking ahead!<br>
<br>
Armed with this new information, I decided to do a regular average <br>
and really focus on looking ahead. I was very happy with the <br>
results. I got 37.17s! This is more than 2 seconds faster than my <br>
previous best average and about 5-6 seconds faster than my regular <br>
average. Also, I got a new non-lucky best time of 28.95s and a new <br>
lucky best time of 28.23s. :)<br>

I&#x27;ve been having a very good cubing day today (see me previous post) 
so I did my WCC solves today. I managed to average sub-40s which is 
really good for me so I&#x27;m happy. :)

But it seems that from what you&#x27;ve written, you do about 2 moves a 
second. I still find it pretty hard to do 3 moves second while 
watching ahead.

          <div class="email-content">Congrats on your av!  It is amazing what looking ahead can do.  Over 
the past couple months I&#x27;ve been able to knock off a lot of time just 
by working on looking ahead!   Usually everyone is like, &quot;you need 
new algs, more finger tricks,&quot; and stuff like that, But that wasn&#x27;t 
my biggest problem.  Even though, i&#x27;m gonna need more fingertricks to 
and maybe more effiecent algs to break 20 seconds, i just really need 
to work on closing those gaps in between steps.  Its a great thing 
that most people dont pick up on untill they get it, yet we hear it 
all the time from the sub 20 cubers.  It is good advice to widdle 
your times down.

          <div class="email-content">To orient one edge, I use this alg (using one face less than Chris&#x27; 
one) :

r&#x27; U2 l F2 l&#x27; F2 r2 U2 r U2 r&#x27; U2 F2 r2 F2

To orient one edge and permute 2 edges :

r2 B2 r&#x27; U2 r&#x27; U2 B2 r&#x27; B2 r B2 r&#x27; B2 r2 B2

Of course, You can replace r by Rr and l by Ll to do them quickly.

          <div class="email-content">Rather than using speedcubingdotcom data (which is sometimes not up 
to date ;-) I&#x27;d suggest using the results of previous runs of the 
same contest. Maybe something similar to what topcoderdotcom does. 
With overwhelming statistics they first compute the expected rank of 
a programmer and then your rating gets updated using the actual 
outcomes of the match:
http://www.topcoder.com/?&amp;t=support&amp;c=ratings

For a simple handicap you could of course just use the best previous 
result or average of last 3 or something similar.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I&#x27;d like to propose an idea for various cube competitions around<br>
the world.<br>
<br>
The idea is that judges set up trivia questions related to the cube<br>
and say 3 players buzz-in to answer them. Possible categories would be<br>
Cube Records, Cube History, Name That Algorithm, Cube Probability,<br>
Puzzle Building, General Cube Facts, Who&#x27;s Cube Is It?, Where does<br>
this Cuber Live, and Who Discovered this Algorithm. One of those rare<br>
games where your own name might be the answer, :). (Note that Cube<br>
Trivia may be impossible to do online.)<br>
<br>
It would be a fun but organized thing to do at our events (probably<br>
not during the event but to do afterwards, in the evening). Because I<br>
found that there was a lot of unstructured down-time at competitions.<br>
It&#x27;s hard-work seting up competitions, so it may be a good idea to<br>
have an unofficial planning committee (that does not include main<br>
judges) that schedules the activities and sight-seeing around each of<br>
our compeitions. My idea is one of many cube related things that we<br>
can do. But the main idea is that it is something that is not quite<br>
speed/dexterity based (I would allow for the exception of cup stacking<br>
of course, lol), but just so that it levels the playing field.<br>
<br>
Something at a cube competion that practically anyone can win: doesn&#x27;t<br>
that cound good?<br>

          <div class="email-content">You just get a can of silicone spray + some silicone wax. Then you 
use any squirtable (lol) bottle or old cube lube injections and put 
some of the silicone spray + silicone wax in. Then you shake it until 
the two lubricants are all mixed and you inject some of the lube in. 
OR if you don&#x27;t want to wait that long (but it won&#x27;t be as good), you 
can always silicone spray first and let it dry, and then squirt some 
wax in. ~

          <div class="email-content">Hey all-<br>
  I recently ordered a Rubik&#x27;s Magic but received a Master&#x27;s Edition <br>
instead. Most of you [Stefan Pochmann in particular ;-)] are <br>
probably thinking &quot;Lucky, I wish I was you.&quot; ...Okay that&#x27;s aside <br>
from the point. I have no idea how to solve a regular Rubik&#x27;s Magic, <br>
so I&#x27;m equally clueless on Master&#x27;s Edition. Due to my curiosity, I <br>
messed around with my Magic and now it&#x27;s in some random position. <br>
<br>
1) How do I return it to a solved state?<br>
2) How do I turn the linked rings into seperated?<br>
<br>
If somebody can reply this post (Stefan, that&#x27;s your cue :-D. Nah, <br>
I&#x27;m kidding, everybody please feel free to answer. :) ) I&#x27;d be very <br>
grateful.<br>

Doesn&#x27;t that scratch on the tiles a lot? I could even imaging the

          <div class="email-content">It has been said that because any given mix of a 3x3x3 can be solved<br>
in 20 or so moves, that a 25-move mixing algorithm is sufficient in<br>
mixing up the cube. Using Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer, I see that he uses the<br>
following length algs to mix different size cubes:<br>
<br>
2x2x2 -&gt; 15 moves<br>
3x3x3 -&gt; 25 moves<br>
4x4x4 -&gt; 40 moves<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know, however, what length of a random alg I should use to mix<br>
a 5x5x5. Does anyone know this? I&#x27;m making a timer in VB and I&#x27;m going<br>
to make it generate random 5x5x5 mixing algs as well, but I don&#x27;t know<br>
how long they should be. Thanks. <br>

I did this and over 8 solves my average was 20.13s, about 2.5 seconds <br>
faster than my normal average.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much improvement in <br>
times since I try (very hard) to actively look ahead during my solves, <br>
and the average I took right after this (regular solving) was about <br>
average, but I did get a lot of insight into my normal solution and <br>
where I need to improve.  Here&#x27;s a basic rundown of my average times per <br>
solve, broken down into four steps (even though I normally OLL in two steps)<br>
<br>
Cross:......4.12 (+2.12s)<br>
F2L:.........7.68 (-.32s)<br>
OLL:........4.63 (+1.63)<br>
PLL:.........3.70 (-.30s)<br>
Total:........20.13 (+3.13s)<br>
<br>
The numbers next to my times are the differences between my times and <br>
what Jessica Fridrich has on her site for a typical 17s solve (I average <br>
22.7-23.5).  I had no idea, but my cross sucks!  I knew it wasn&#x27;t that <br>
great, but I should be able to squeeze 1-2 seconds out of that alone.  <br>
Also OLL, but aside from learning all 57 OLL cases I dont think I can <br>
get much more time out of it.  So at least now I know what to practice :)<br>

&gt;Like all other cubers, I want to get faster. Obviously, lots of <br>
&gt;practice will help this, but in an aim to be more strategic I <br>
&gt;thought I would try and work out specific areas to focus on. Prior <br>
&gt;to Worlds last year, a big part of my slowness was that I just <br>
&gt;didn&#x27;t know enough algs. Now I&#x27;m using a 3-look LL, so lack of algs <br>
&gt;is not the reason I can&#x27;t get sub-30s times (or rarely ever get <br>
&gt;these times). I had thought that a big part of my problem now is <br>
&gt;that I just don&#x27;t turn the cube fast enough. I also knew that I <br>
&gt;waste a bit of time looking for pieces during the solve. To get a <br>
&gt;better idea how much time I&#x27;m wasting, I tried an experiment today. <br>
&gt;Here&#x27;s what I did:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;- normal pre-inspection<br>
&gt;- did the cross<br>
&gt;- paused the timer<br>
&gt;- identified the first F2L pair<br>
&gt;- started the timer and did the first F2L pair<br>
&gt;- repeated the previous two steps for all F2L pairs, and then the <br>
&gt;same for orienting the LL edges, then LL corners, then permuting all.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;My aim was to see what my times could be like if I didn&#x27;t waste time <br>
&gt;looking for pieces. I was rather surprised by the results: (24.69), <br>
&gt;25.09, 26.65, 28.29, 28.66, 28.95, 29.31, 29.89, 30.62, 31.58, <br>
&gt;31.98, (32.67) --&gt; 29.10s (the times were not in this order, I just <br>
&gt;had to sort them this way for my excel spreadsheet to average the <br>
&gt;middle ten).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;A regular average for me would usually have times ranging from ~36 <br>
&gt;to 49, with the average being 42-43s. I hadn&#x27;t realised that I was <br>
&gt;wasting 13-14s per solve just looking for pieces!! Based on this, if <br>
&gt;I just work on looking ahead, I should be able to drop my times <br>
&gt;considerably. I felt encouraged by this because it means that I <br>
&gt;shouldn&#x27;t have to learn more algs or increase my rate of turns/sec <br>
&gt;to get sub-30s times, I just need to practice looking ahead!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Armed with this new information, I decided to do a regular average <br>
&gt;and really focus on looking ahead. I was very happy with the <br>
&gt;results. I got 37.17s! This is more than 2 seconds faster than my <br>
&gt;previous best average and about 5-6 seconds faster than my regular <br>
&gt;average. Also, I got a new non-lucky best time of 28.95s and a new <br>
&gt;lucky best time of 28.23s. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">To get it back to the starting position is kinda tough. Basically, 
just turn it randomly until it works.
Or, go to jaap&#x27;s site: geocities.com/jaapsch and see if you can use 
some algorithms there to manipulate them how you want. The first way 
is easier, though.
What&#x27;s really annoying is when you accidentally get it into a 
position that isn&#x27;t the flat, 2x6 rectangle and you can&#x27;t get it 
back.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,

I do own 3 different 5x5x5 cubes. An Eastsheen, a new Rubik´s and my 
old Rubik´s from about 1983.
I don´t like the Eastsheen Cube at all because it´s impossible to 
turn it really smooth and it makes problems with disaglinement.
My new Rubik´s one isn´t my favorite eighter as the outer slices 
don´t turn well.
The old Rubik´s however is all optimal, it´s the one I always use and 
although my 3x3x3 times are only around 35 sec. I average about 3:30 
with it. Finger tricks are almost impossible with it I think (I don´t 
know or use them anyway) but it´s kinda loose and for me optimal to 
turn. It also allows bad disaglinements without popping pieces.
Maybe you try to get an old Rubik´s Cube (ebay?).
The advantage may be getting used to it regarding that only Rubik´s 
brand puzzles will probably) be allowed at offical tournaments like 
the World Championships.

I would think that 25 moves would be enough in practise provided you <br>

A 5x5x5 has twice as many outer slices as the normal cube, so twice <br>
as many moves (i.e. 50) should be fine in practice. This is more than <br>
enough to separate all the pieces from each other, and therefore <br>
adequate I would think.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!!

I don&#x27;t own an original 5x5x5 &quot;wahn&quot; cube. But i do however own both 
an Eastsheen 5x5x5 and the latest Rubiks.com 5x5x5. I agree totally 
that the outer layers on the latter cube are too stiff for comfort. 
In fact the whole cube is too big for my hands. After doing an 
average with it my hands are really tired. While on the eastsheen 
5x5x5 i can probably cube all day without any kind of discomfort. I 
really suggest that they redesign the Rubiks.com 5x5x5. Make the 
sides about 3-4 mm shorter and improve the outer layers. And maybe 
lighther also, slthough the size reduction would reduce the weight 
slightly automatically. Personally i don&#x27;t find misalignment to be a 
big problem on the eastsheen. What is needed is to relax a bit and 
focus on precision when u turn the layers. Actually, slowing down 
with it improves overall speed:-D Instead focus on lookahead;-) I&#x27;m 
about 40 secs faster on the eastsheen than the Rubiks.com. I hope to 
cut down the gap for Amsterdam ;-)

-Cubix-

PS! The rubiks.com 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes should come with 6-8 free 
spare centers. And possibly a few spare corners. The edges never 
break anyway.

          <div class="email-content">That &quot;regular sized Eastsheen&quot; is no Eastsheen. I have one and I 
don&#x27;t like it, but I admit that I haven&#x27;t played with it a lot, so 
maybe after playing with it longer it would turn better. But it&#x27;s 
broken. No, not like you think. A metal *screw* broke! I was hoping 
that I could find another one and replace it but I can&#x27;t even get 
the rest of the old screw out of the kernel.

I also have an Eastsheen (i.e. the mini 5x5) and I love it. After 
lubing it&#x27;s excellent. I don&#x27;t solve it as normal 5x5 but as super 
5x5 and I average around 6:30 with it. Maybe Olli hasn&#x27;t prepared 
his well enough ;-) We&#x27;ll maybe see in Amsterdam...

I also have an old Rubik&#x27;s Cube (one with a plastic cylinder) and 
it&#x27;s ok but I need around 8 minutes for it. But I haven&#x27;t played 
with it much yet and I haven&#x27;t lubed it either. Btw, the pieces look 
exactly like my &quot;regular sized Eastsheen&quot; (just no tiles) so at 
least I can use it&#x27;s pieces to replace broken pieces in my Rubik&#x27;s 
one in case something breaks.

          <div class="email-content">There was a long thread about a new F2L idea recently that I stayed out of<br>
but it seemed to be touching on these issues: that is what makes a good<br>
strategy - clearly its not just shortest number of moves although by<br>
learning lots of algorithms you can achieve a very efficient algorithm.  I&#x27;m<br>
not sure whether I&#x27;ve put up something like it before so apologies if I<br>
have!<br>
<br>
The point was just to highlight the things I (and probably others but thats<br>
part of what I&#x27;m asking) aim for when devising new strategies for<br>
speedcubing.  Note that this is for speedcubing so practicality is<br>
definitely an issue.<br>
<br>
1. Minimise number of moves to solve.<br>
2. Minimise number of looks required.<br>
3. Minimise number of algorithms to learn.<br>
4. Minimise number of algorithms per look (makes recognition faster so that<br>
say 30 algorithms on each of 3 looks is probably faster than two 10s and<br>
then an 80 on a single look)<br>
5. Easy to recognise cases on each look (for example edge flips on a single<br>
face is much easier than edge flips over three different faces, or<br>
personally I find mixing perms and orientations very hard to spot).<br>
6. Minimise number of moves per algorithm (if you have step that has say 15<br>
algorithms and 14 are 8 moves long but 1 is 16 moves long that can be a real<br>
showstopper!)<br>
7. Practically speaking you have to be able to actually cover every case<br>
that turns up with a decent algorithm!<br>
<br>
One comparison that illustrates is is the Fridrich F2L pairs v. the<br>
&quot;keyhole&quot; method.  Both take a similar number of moves, pairs requires quite<br>
a few algorithms (is it 18?) although some are quite trivial and it has the<br>
advantage that you apply the same algorithms to each of 4 steps, keyhole<br>
doesn&#x27;t really require algorithms other than very trivial ones, Fridrich<br>
takes 4 steps, keyhole takes 8.  They optimise against the constraints in<br>
totally different ways and I don&#x27;t know if anyone makes a claim that either<br>
method is superior.<br>
<br>
Anybody out there have any other criteria that they apply?  Or comments and<br>
objections against my own?  Obviously these criteria all fight against each<br>
other which is why its so hard to find really practical new strategies.  The<br>
issue to optimise.<br>
<br>
Using layer by layer its pretty hard to improve on a 2 look F2L but if you<br>
look at the constraints 1-7 ideas suggest themselves.  Number 4 in<br>
particular pretty much forces you to look at spreading the solution of the<br>
last layer across more looks which leads to ZB and other attempts (I posted<br>
recently on L2L strategies which uses this approach in an extreme way).<br>
<br>
Probably this is very trivial stuff to most readers but it can pay off to<br>
look at the basics like this and it can suggest novel approaches.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts or other views on what makes a good strategy then I&#x27;d love to<br>
hear.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Duncan,

Here&#x27;s what Ron wrote on the same topic a while back on the caltech 
forum:
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/caltechrubiks/message/451
&quot;I think in general a method is suitable for speedcubing if it has:
= as few steps as possible
= as few intuitive steps as possible
= a nice number of algorithms per step, with a good recognition system
= a good start after preinspection
= .....
Even if a system uses fewer moves, it will be hard to beat a system 
with the
above characteristics.&quot;

I would like to add that orientation of any single piece should be 
fixed before or together with its permutation. Permutation-
>orientation just isn&#x27;t very good for recognition.

I used a 60 move scrambling algorithm at Caltech.  I have sent a post 
with all of the tournament scrambles.  I hope the e-mail is readable.

          <div class="email-content">I only have a regular magic, and have never even seen a master 
edition, but I have broken strings on my magic. I found that I could 
remove up to half the strings without affecting the puzzle, as long 
as the double pairs on front and back have at least one string left. 
If you look at the puzzle, the same lines are strung on the front and 
back, so it really could function with 4 strings, instead of 8. If 
you didn&#x27;t break both sides, the puzzle probably still will function, 
although I&#x27;d have to break one myself to find out. Good luck with the 
magic.

You&#x27;re right that each of these can make you faster, but that you can&#x27;t<br>
have all of them. I think it is useful to identify the features and the<br>
tradeoffs. Here is how I see them...<br>
<br>
Desired features:<br>
<br>
1. few moves<br>
2. few looks<br>
3. little thought (except preinspection)<br>
4. quick recognition<br>
5. quick for the fingers<br>
<br>
Tradeoffs:<br>
<br>
1. few moves / quick recognition<br>
2. few moves / quick for the fingers<br>
3. few moves / little thought<br>
4. few looks / quick recognition<br>
<br>
I may have missed something.<br>
<br>
We already know two extreme opposites:<br>
<br>
1. many moves, few looks, little thought, quick recognition, quick for<br>
   the fingers.<br>
2. few moves, many looks, much thought, slow recognition, slow for the<br>
   fingers.<br>
<br>
<br>
A lot of discussion has focussed on (1). Let me talk about (2). First of<br>
all, maybe solving the cube is more interesting if your brain does it<br>
instead of a webpage with all the answers. Maybe not?? The big win in<br>
thinking more and going for fewer moves is that you don&#x27;t have to turn<br>
the cube so quickly. You can actually see what&#x27;s happening to the cube<br>
and think ahead more easily. So, number of looks, quick recognition, and<br>
quick for fingers become less important.<br>
<br>
My ideal system:<br>
<br>
- few moves<br>
- continuous looking<br>
- continuous thought<br>

If your wire loops did not snap but merely came undone, then you can <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I do have all mentioned cubes and my experience with them is:
- eastsheen is the most precisely made cube ever but intolerant
it is also very light and you are not tired too soon
- &quot;Giant Master Cube&quot; and the new Rubik&#x27;s are mechanically
identical if both are new; the mentioned difference is imho
a matter of a longer use of the G.M.Cube.
After &quot;breaking in&quot; the Rubik&#x27;s 5x5x5 it is similarly good
and the price is lower. (I have not bought the G.M.Cube, I have
won it in a local competition and it was untouched.)
These cubes are quite heavy (it is like solving a stone :)).

Well, have you seen at least one Rubik&#x27;s cube there?

Btw. I partially solved the lack of original cubes, because
my mother works in plastic-recycling company (remember one
of &quot;you cube too much if..&quot; :)) and I got 2.75 original
(likely Arxon) cubes and many fake cubes and other puzzles there
(in about two months). Fake cubes are mostly damaged, the
original cubes are not(!).

I do not know why people do not want to sell a cube here
in Czech Rep., but throw them into garbage so often?!?..

a lots of toys, e.g. a big bag of LEGO pieces :).

well, the knot&#x27;s attributes would depend on what knot
is tied. I must admit that I don&#x27;t know the
construction principles of the puzzle in question, but
I understand that it&#x27;s undesirable if the loop gets
longer, and I assume that it&#x27;s not gonna get &quot;pushed&quot;
shorter, or if it does, it&#x27;s not a problem.

In that case, &quot;fishermans bend&quot; (translation from
danish), which is suitable for tying together two
slippery ends of equal diameter - in this case two
ends of the same line.

There&#x27;s an illustation here:

Of Ron&#x27;s four points he has two completely different to mine.  Namely as few
intuitive steps as possible and a good start after preinspection.
I would definitely agree with the second of these but not so sure about the
first.  But I definitely see the point of it.  It would favour the Fridric
pair method against the keyhole method for example and whose to say thats
wrong.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ryan ,
I am more in this camp I think.  I guess that if you have a great memory,
quick recognition and lots of time on your hands you would go for your first
type of strategy.  I am missing the time to learn and age is definitely a
factor with the memory and recognition,

This also fits with Jasmine&#x27;s recent &quot;experiment&quot; thread and what the sub 20
solvers are always saying about slowing down and looking ahead - a use of
your type 2 approach.  It suits F2L solvers who go for the keyhole approach
too!

          <div class="email-content">What I was trying to say, instead of orienting all the corners during one
pair, orient two during the second to last pair, then two during the last
pair.  This way it splits it up a bit.  Then orient edges, permute edges and
permute corners in one go. So its kind of ZB in the sense that you have all
of something oriented when you reach the last layer, in this case corners.
Then you do the last layer in one look.  I believe that having corners
oriented, instead of edges, will make the number of algorithms for the one
look last layer go down considerably.  I&#x27;m just not sure on the number of
algorithms for orienting the corners like I said, two during the second to
last pair, and the other two during the last pair.

This is something I&#x27;m sure people have already considered. The 
problem with that is that there are far too many cases for that last 
c/e pairing. Even for the edges (of ZB) it takes about 157 cases the 
last time I counted. Since you have as many corners as edges to deal 
with and yet the corner orientations have more cases then edge 
orientation, it must be some number of alg higher then 157, probably 
by a factor of 3 or 4. As for the average length of such algorithms 
I cannot be sure, but I would suspect lengthier due to the &quot;amount 
of things that need to be done&quot;. Thus it is quite futile seeing as 
no one has yet learned all the c/e pairing algs for the ZB method 
(none that I know of). Perhaps sometime in the future it may become 
fesible...

Ok, ignore the rest of this post if you hate math.

I can take a count of the number of such c/e pairing cases... (note 
that many of them can be interpreted as inverses, but this is so 
impractical they shouldn&#x27;t be grouped by inverses). Ignoring mirror 
cases, let&#x27;s see... If the corner is fully in place and edge in it&#x27;s 
slot there are 6 corner possibilities times two for edge flip minus 
one for the null case.

Going on with this sort of combinatorial logic I count 
11+16+28+50+.... (going in the same order that the ZB method 
classifies them in). Estimating/asserting that the rest of the 
classes to be consist of 27 cases due to varying degrees of 
symmetry, I would estimate a total of 240 cases. (This estimate I 
would imagine is off by at most +/-5.)

Next we can &quot;count&quot; the number of LL cases with corners orientated. 
Lets dissect in to three classifications here: no swap, adj swap, 
diag swap (all in regards to the corners only). Note that this can 
be done without loss of generality because given any element in the 
symmetric group S_4 we can freely apply a certain 4-cycle to fix any 
one corner then if we are left with a 3-cycle we compose another 4-
cycle to reduce it into a 2-cycle.

If there is no corner permutation then we are in ELL land (I live 
here), and there are 18 cases ignoring the trivial case. (Note that 
here it&#x27;s convenient to group together all mirrors and inverses.) If 
there needs to be an adjacent corner swap then I count 36. If there 
needs to be a diagonal corner swap I count 25. (Details left to the 
reader :).) But I have a grand total of 79!!!! Note that this is 
done in the same way of counting as the 177 number was for the ZB 
method (i.e. by grouping inverses). This is least then half the 
number of LL algs when compared to the ZB method.

          <div class="email-content">I guess I didn&#x27;t make myself clear, because two people have misunderstood
the same point. So I&#x27;ll write it in a numbered list.

 

1)       Cross

2)       F2l pair

3)       F2l pair

4)       F2l pair and orient two corners

5)       F2l pair and orient two corners

6)       Last layer

 

Hope that makes it clearer.  But the fact that there are only 79 algs for
the last layer, is nice.  Just need to find an efficient way to orient
corners as you approach the last layer.

Evan,

This is something I&#x27;m sure people have already considered. The 
problem with that is that there are far too many cases for that last 
c/e pairing. Even for the edges (of ZB) it takes about 157 cases the 
last time I counted. Since you have as many corners as edges to deal 
with and yet the corner orientations have more cases then edge 
orientation, it must be some number of alg higher then 157, probably

          <div class="email-content">Hi there all.
Some info from Steve, production controller at Seven Towns which addresses
some of the points on this thread:

&quot;There is now a  code stamped onto both the package and product, these are a
batch numbers, not date codes. The code on the cube it&#x27;s self was introduced
quite recently to improve fault tracking. This can be found stamped into the
plastic on the inside face of one of the cublets visible when twisted. 

Unfortunately there is no way to truly be sure if the cube in the shop has
the new tooling with arched underside to the centre squares. However all
cubes produce since around 6 months ago will be from the new tools. It&#x27;s
simply a case of old stock disappearing from the shelves. Therefore as it&#x27;s
now clear the new cubes are on the shelves it should be fairly safe to say
all cubes in major retailers are new cubes. You will also notice an
improvement in the labels. The logo is printed much more clear and with
stronger colours. In addition to this the laminate material has been changed
to improve the bond and in tests the labels are now 5 x more durable to
rubbing and delaminating, unfortunately this is also undetectable at sight
and again is down to old stock being sold as new stock takes it&#x27;s place. 
We at Rubik  are making these changes as permanent improvements to all cubes
rather than making a &#x27;special cube&#x27; and charging a higher price, as was the
deluxe cubes of the 80&#x27;s. The down side is the only way to implement this is
as a running change, rather than a specified difference. 

We will also soon be introducing to rubiks.com a cube builder kit. Which is
essentially and complete set of cube parts un-assembled. This way
speedcubers can assemble the spring pressure to their own liking&quot;.

Hope that helps a bit!
Dave

Well, then they wouldn&#x27;t be selling the Japanese packaging would 
they? The price of it is different from the standard cube price. 
Plus, they didn&#x27;t have any problems making it back then, then why 
would it be a problem now? Just wondering~

Hi,<br>
<br>
Could be a good idea.<br>
But don&#x27;t you find amazing that you can be so fast using the &quot;simple&quot;<br>
Fridrich algorithm, and it looks so hard to become significantly faster?<br>
Nobody will ever be crazy enough to learn 100 more sequences if they<br>
can save only 0.5s after a 2-year daily pratice.<br>
Hum, well... maybe...  :-)<br>

P.S.: Other ideas.<br>
<br>
1- Cross<br>
2- Pair<br>
3- Pair<br>
4- Pair + orient 5 edges<br>
5- Pair + permute 4 edges<br>
6- CLL<br>
<br>
1- Cross<br>
2- Pair<br>
3- Pair<br>
4- Pair + last top-layer corner<br>
5- CLL (can disturb LL-edges)<br>
6- 5 edges<br>
<br>
There are many more possibilities, but are they worth it? I mean, when<br>
I see people OLLing in 2 seconds, what&#x27;s the point of trying to skip<br>
it if this makes other steps much more difficult?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Problem with extending in this way is always the number of algorthms at each
stage.  This is because there are already a large number of F2L pair
algorithms and they multiply up.  My approach is to push the first layer
corner up to be done with the cross and then solve parts of the LL with just
a middle edge.  this significantly cuts down the number of algorithms you
require and also makes recognition a lot easier.  The down side is of course
that for each pair you treat like this you have to add an extra corner into
ur cross + corner step at the start.  But for example you then only need 27
algorithms to orient all the last layer corners with the last middle edge.
Or if you do it with the the second last middle edge you can orient the
edges with the last (another 8 algorithms).  This leaves a one look PLL.  I
promised to do this over the summer but haven&#x27;t started the serious work on
it yet - I have 26/27 corner algorithms and 5/8 edge ones that dont affect
corners.  Will post when its sorted!

Further extensions of this method also promised later in the summer!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Evan,

   I use my own method, (posted at
http://www.cubehead.org/index.php?action=methods&amp;showid=22 )
   Since in placing the last FL corner I don&#x27;t have to place the edge
piece as well I can go about it differently.

   The LL corners have 8 orientations and three positions one of which
is &quot;solved&quot;. The last corner of the FL has 3 orientations so: 8*3=24
-1=23 *3=69 positions. So you would need to learn only 63 algorithms.
And if in placing the last of the four edges of the FL you place all
of the LL edges correctly then you&#x27;ve eliminated the LL step completely.

Regards,

David J

Try (LRFL&#x27;R&#x27;F2)^2
(fixes F-center)

It&#x27;s such a simple solution... I figured someone had
found that way of doing it already :)

oops.  It is wrong. (sorry everyone) In my hurry I
messed up an alg. :-S

I bought it at an open market for 4 dollars.  My best
guess is that it is a Tomy pyraminx, but I have no way
of knowing for sure.

          <div class="email-content">This is all very fantasitc news. The improved stickers and looseness 
should encourage a majority of consumers to be cubing more often. As 
for us speedcubers almost all stickers will wear away for us in a 
matter of days, lol. We just cube too much. As a tip to people, I 
have recently put 4x4 stickers on my 3x3, and it is holding up very 
well.

I definately need something to be able to control tension, and not 
just tightening screws like on Studio cubes, I&#x27;d like it to be 
something more robust, say with washers or some sort of mechanism so 
that the center caps are gurrentted to not pop off or self-tighten.

I was told that the codes are lightly embossed on the underside of 
the Hasbro packaging and that they are 5 digits long where we should 
look for 32 as the first two digits for the most recent model. Can 
you verify the validity of this statement?

I gave the timer a shot. it only counts up every 2 seconds. And the 
total time after stopping the timer is always a whole second, eg 6:00 
or 8:00. This looks pretty useless to me I could understand if this 
was Java Applet/Application. Strange. This timer doesn&#x27;t add new 
functionality to previous timers (eg the one by Jess Bonde).

Any working new timer with new features is always welcome :-)

Was the wrong version uploaded for some reason. Curious ...

properly and gives the time to the hundredths of a second. Thus I

to be fixed.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know what he does, but if I made a good supercube which 
showed the four adjacent colors, I would solve the centers as I went, 
solving the cross center and the four adjacent corners during the 
cross. This is how I do the 4x4x4 scrambled like a 2x2x2, then a 
3x3x3, and the reverse for solve. That way you minimize the number of 
centers you have to orient after solving the edges and corners. 
Often, you only have to do one or two one- or two-center algorithms 
to fix the last centers. Although you could reduce it to zero or one 
if you found enough algorithms which preserve center orientation.

Subject: Rubik&#x27;s Products Questions

Could you post a reply that says the code stamped onto both the package and

product are a batch numbers, not date codes. The code on the cube it&#x27;s self

was introduced quite recently to improve fault tracking. This can be found

stamped into the plastic on the inside face of one of the cublets visible

when twisted. Unfortunately there is no way to truly be sure if the cube in

the shop has the new tooling with arched underside to the centre squares.

However all cubes produce since around 6 months ago will be from the new

tools. It&#x27;s simply a case of old stock disappearing from the shelves.

Therefore as it&#x27;s now clear the new cubes are on the shelves it should be

safe to say all cubes in major retailers are new cubes. Consumers will also

notice an improvement in the labels. The logo is printed much more clear and

with stronger colours. In addition to this the laminate material has been

changed to improve the bond and in tests the labels are now 5 x more durable

to rubbing and delaminating. The two or not common to each other and

unfortunately this is undetectable at sight and again is down to old stock

being sold as new stock takes it&#x27;s place. We at Rubik hope consumers

appreciate we are making these changes as permanent improvements to all

cubes rather than making a &#x27;special cube&#x27; and charging a higher price, as

was the deluxe cubes of the 80&#x27;s. The down side is the only way to implement

this is as a running change, rather than a specified difference. 

We will also soon be introducing to rubiks.com a cube builder kit. Which is

essentially and complete set of cube parts un-assembled. This way

speedcubers can assemble the spring pressure to their own liking.

Thank you,

 

The Rubik&#x27;s Shop customer service

          <div class="email-content">Although you may think that if you seperate the LL corners in two 
steps would cut down the numbers of algorithm, I am skeptical of the 
fact.

Lets say you have a 3x2x2 + 1 edge. There are 5 possibilities : 

All Corners Correct.
3 Corners Correct
2 Corners Correct
1 Corner Correct.
0 Corners Correct.

Now, you have to take in account of that. If you decide to Orient 2 
corners, you will have to choose from all this pool which corner 
setting would be favorable.

So you place 1 F2L pair + orient 2 corners. 

You are left with the last F2L pair. You face the same dilemna.

All corners Correct (Last F2L corner oriented.) 
3 Corners Correct
2 Corners Correct.

Now the idea is to place the last F2L pair without disturbing the 
work already done. If the 4 corners were all correct, you will have 
to place the f2L without disturbing the corners.

This quite scares me although this is purely hypothetical and I might 
be completly wrong.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s a good point. Like I said, it just popped into my head; I didn&#x27;t
think about it much.  I do like the idea of placing a corner with the cross,
and orienting LL corners with the last edge, or something along those lines.
I still haven&#x27;t learned full Fridrich though, so I should worry about that
for now.  But it&#x27;s still fun to think about stuff like this.

Japanese cubist (I&#x27;m 1/4 :)) use rubber rings on the metal part that 
you can see when you stretch the centers of the cube. I haven&#x27;t 
tried it yet, but it isn&#x27;t allowed at any world championships.

1)intuinive first layer (3-6 seconds)
2)Solve the mini-pyraminx edges (3-4seconds)

All the times for looking:2 seconds

I&#x27;m not sure what exactly is wrong here, but I just averaged 
17.17s... I think the timers a bit off as I&#x27;m usually around 24s!  
hehehe I LIKE :) the timer, but you may want to look into that.

That might have something to do with your processor speed...but I&#x27;m<br>
not sure. When I run the timer on my computer and look at the task<br>
manager, I see that it uses 0-1% of my processor, so it&#x27;s not very<br>
processor intensive or anything.<br>
<br>
I used visual basic to make the thing. I used one of VB timer objects<br>
to increment the timer. How did you make your CubeTimer Dan Knights?<br>
It seems that people can run your timer just fine, did you one of<br>
Visual Basic&#x27;s timer objects as well? ..or do it differently?<br>
<br>
I can easily change the timing method in the program, but I can&#x27;t see<br>
any other way to do it. It times accurately on my computer.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,

I already found the strange behaviour before I read your message. I 
fixed the problem and added some features.
I didn&#x27;t know about Dan Knight&#x27;s timer, which is something similar

My goals in designing were the following
- The timer should be very lightweight, so that I can start it very 
fast, without opening a webpage. So no Java, Javascript.
- I wanted to use it as a video timer to show on the background of 
video&#x27;s I take. Try resizing the window, the font size resizes with 
it, so you can show it at any size.
- I wanted it to log all times to a logfile, so that I can analyse my 
progress in Excel. It now saves all times in a tab delimited file. I 
have written the Excel function CubeAverage. You can find that one in 
the files section too.
- As an extra I added sound, so you have a &#x27;metronome&#x27;. Also, every 
15 seconds, it beeps, and you can focus on that during speedsolving 
without having to look away from your cube.

More notes:
- it is written in Visual Basic, so it needs the VB runtime (you can 
find it at microsoft.com, search for VBRun60.exe)
- the beep sound depends on you windows system sound settings
- I don&#x27;t know if the time is very accurate know on every system. To 
me it seems accurate now
- it won&#x27;t work on a computer that has not been rebooted in the last 
49 days (microsoft&#x27;s problem with time function actually). This might 
be solved on newer OS&#x27;s.
- it has only been tested on win98
- don&#x27;t ask me to build in averages etc.. that&#x27;s why it logs!
- I will soon change the RESET button to an Accept Button and a 
Discard Button.
- Press F1 for help
- If you would like to have the source code, just mail me.
- If you find any bugs or want more features, just let me know!
- Sorry to bother everyone who is already very happy with their 
current timer.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Joseph,

I just tried it a few times, this is what I got: 37.57 45.22 36.21.

Man, this feels really ugly. Normally I don&#x27;t rotate the clock (just 
flip it over to the other side), but with one hand I did.

Oh wait, I did another few solves, this time not rotating (using my 
normal method, just with one hand). The times: 32.46 34.78 32.90.

Nice, I would&#x27;ve won the World Championship with five of these six 
attempts ;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi

Sorry if I had you offended about Java here. I know that Java can 
create stand-alone applications, though my experience is still that 
it loads quite slow. And in this case I meant an applet. Anyway, the 
VB runtime is about 1MB, which is alot smaller than the Java Runtime. 
And I have yet to find a computer that doesn&#x27;t have the VB runtime 
already installed for some purpose. I think you do understand that 
once you have the runtime you don&#x27;t need to go to a webpage and 
download it again. Maybe a better solution after all is an MSDOS 
program. Just hang on, I&#x27;ll create that one too. You can never have 
enough timers. Just because of my old crappy system with Win98 and IE 
6.0 the browser takes ages to load. I know you are going to smack 
some other alternative browser in my face :-). Oh yes 
appletviewer.exe of course! And I am all for multi-platform programs 
but this one isn&#x27;t really worth the trouble.

Ok let me go time myself again.
Cheers to you too.

<br>
Another idea I had: Use a mouse as a stackmat simulator for people <br>
who want to practice the stackmat feeling but don&#x27;t have money left. <br>
You know, left hand on left button and right on right. Should be <br>
nice to use (better than the keyboard, in particular there&#x27;s no way <br>
I&#x27;m gonna hit my laptop keyboard fast because I don&#x27;t want to damage <br>

          <div class="email-content">HI All,

   I see my edit could be improved. :)  What I wrote is for the last
corner of the FL being in place whether its oriented correctly or not.

   Also there are other ways of going about the LL corners - different
number of algs depending on how you put them together. You could use
as few as three algs or something in the neighborhood of 200 algs.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

More ideas about timers ;-)

I just got the smart idea (!! or ??) that in order to simulate the 
stacktimer with a computer timer one should have to press 2 keys at 
the same time ... both to start the timer and to stop the timer. For 
instance Alt+Home to get it started and Alt+End to stop it. As far as 
i can see this MUST be done with two hands, rite? I believe this can 
be coded in either Java or most other languages, like VB, C++ or 
Delphi.

Maybe i will give it a shot to create my own timer with puzzle 
categories, rolling averages and statistics ;-)

-cubix-

PS! If i do it will be made in Delphi :D

<br>
Also this timer has some peculiarities/errors.<br>
I just gave it a spin, just faking some times actually :D<br>
<br>
It gave some weird results in it&#x27;s calculations.<br>
<br>
Average = 13.50<br>
Fastest time = 10.81 <br>
Slowest time = 6.57<br>
Session average = 17224321.58<br>
<br>
This surely is mathematically astonishing ;-)<br>
<br>
Otherwise i like the layout of this timer. Very similar to another <br>
timer actually :D (i guess ppl know which one i refer to ...)<br>
<br>
-Per K-<br>
<br>
PS! A few hints: <br>
1) Allow to record pops.<br>
2) Mark the best and worst time after finishing 12 solves<br>
3) Get the calculations correct.<br>
4) Erase the individual times before starting a new average ;-)<br>

I&#x27;m not a programmer by vocation, but I do some when need arises.  I 
don&#x27;t know any of the higher programing language, but I have written 
some BASIC and TI-BASIC programs that I use frequently.  I&#x27;m not in 
the same league as most of the programming guys around here though.

I am minoring in math though (major in astronomy)...and what&#x27;s with 
all the cubers named Dan?

Funny you should ask that. The timer I wrote has just that (resize). 
Any requests, send them to blonkm @ zonnet.nl

Look for &quot;Yet another timer&quot; in the files section.

Well yes i am a programmer too. Am doing master degree in informaiton 
technology. I am fluent in Delphi/Java/Basic/Fortran/ASP/ADO/COM 
(active-X)/SQL/can read and understand C/C++. But never done any 
actual coding with it. It&#x27;s most fun to program Games and COM-DLLs 
for use as web-browser extension. All that can be done in delphi in 
which it is a dream to develop.I know some Lisp and Prolog, but most 
non-programmers hardly knows about those. Will most likely start 
learning ASP.NET/C# soon. And i have also studied maths for 3 yrs. 
And been cubing sine 1980 without interruption. Does that qualify me 
as some kinda nerd or geek ? ;-)

If I remember correctly, most newer motherboards somewhere in the 
BIOS have an &quot;Enable USB legacy support&quot; which allows USB keyboards 
and Mice to run on older operating systems.  That might be worth a 
shot... Other than that I don&#x27;t know though.

I was thinking of bus stations. I guess I could metro/train from 
Amstel to Central though.

          <div class="email-content">One thing that I would prefer being changed is the way that the 
space bar has to be pressed and released to stop the timer.  I like 
to have both hands on the space bar then release to start the timer 
and then place both hands back on the timer to stop the timer.  
Stopping the timer as soon as the space bar is pressed works much 
better for this.

I recently updated my website, and during the update, I added a page

          <div class="email-content">Hello again. I&#x27;m bored at home, have been cubing too much today, and <br>
I figured I might as well create an addition to my scrambler for the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Clock. I&#x27;ve scanned multiple sites, and have found no <br>
evidence of a notation. So here&#x27;s what I need to know:<br>
<br>
1) Is there a working notation for wheels and buttons? Or should I <br>
just create one?<br>
<br>
2) How many moves (buttons and wheels) are sufficient to scramble it <br>
properly? I don&#x27;t have one yet, it&#x27;s in the mail, so I can&#x27;t really <br>
try it myself, except online. The dotsphinx.com version seems to do <br>
20-30 wheel moves, but always ends up lucky, and the rubiks.com <br>
version doesn&#x27;t show it scrambling, but is hardly ever lucky.<br>
<br>
3) Should the pattern go: 1 button changed, 1 wheel moved... or 1-4 <br>
buttons, 1-4 wheels...?<br>
<br>
4) Is there another scrambler out there I can&#x27;t find?<br>
<br>
5) Would anyone use such a scrambler if I created it? Or does anyone <br>
ever use the one I made for other puzzles at all?<br>
<br>

understand what i mean.  In this manner, following the same button 
pattern, you can give 13 numbers, where the center clock should be 
pointed during each move.  And then at the end you can give 4 binary 
bits, to tell which buttons should be up and down.  I hope i have 
made this clear enough, if not just reply and i&#x27;ll explain in 
greater detail.

          <div class="email-content">That sounds good. I saw his comment earlier, but didn&#x27;t read closely 
enough. I thought, somehow, he just wanted to rotate the wheels with 
the same pins each time. Thank you for the clarification. I&#x27;ll post 
the modified program when it is finished.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; One thing that I would prefer being changed is the way that the <br>
&gt; space bar has to be pressed and released to stop the timer.  I like <br>
&gt; to have both hands on the space bar then release to start the timer <br>
&gt; and then place both hands back on the timer to stop the timer.  <br>
&gt; Stopping the timer as soon as the space bar is pressed works much <br>
&gt; better for this.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Jon<br>

OK. The standalone timer now stops as soon as you press the space<br>
button. Keep &#x27;em coming ;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok, so this post is really late.  I just got back from vacationing <br>
around California for 2 weeks after the competition ended.  My <br>
grandparents live in California so I stayed after the competition to <br>
hang out with them.<br>
<br>
So anyway I&#x27;ve only gotten about 2 hours of sleep in the last 48 and <br>
I&#x27;m starting to get very groggy, but I couldn&#x27;t wait to post about <br>
how totally and amazingly awesome the US competition was.<br>
<br>
I had forgotten how cool it is to be around other people who enjoy <br>
the cube as much as I do.  At my school my friends all think it is <br>
pretty cool that I do the cube, but as a general rule I cube on my <br>
own time so as not to get in the way of other non-cube stuff my <br>
friends always seem to prefer :)  It was so amazing again to sit in <br>
a room with other cubers who also, without even realizing it, <br>
scrambled their cube while talking to other people :)<br>
<br>
The cube get togethers before and after the competition were by far <br>
my favorite part of the whole weekend.<br>
<br>
Meeting old friends from the 2003 competition and also seeing some <br>
new faces was a totally awesome experience.  I replaced a couple of <br>
my algorithms afer watching over people do them, even ones that I <br>
thought were some of my fastest!  Many thanks to Ian Winokur and <br>
Raul Garcia for two RIDICULOUSLY fast OLL algs to replace some of my <br>
previously already fast ones :)  Doug Li also showed me a <br>
ridiculously fast way to do one of my OLLs which I always seem to <br>
lock up but I don&#x27;t remember it!  It&#x27;s the rarest case, the 1/216 <br>
chance one.  Aaah!  I can&#x27;t remember it! :)<br>
<br>
Doug and Macky, I&#x27;m glad to see that some other cubers have also <br>
tried cup stacking and think it is cool :)  I&#x27;ve become totally <br>
addicted to it in the past few weeks, and it is cool to see that <br>
others enjoy it too :)<br>
<br>
As far as the competition itself thanks so much to Tyson and the <br>
Caltech crew for setting up such a wonderfully smooth running and <br>
fun event.  I definitely like the format of everyone doing their <br>
first trial, then everyone doing their second trial.  I like that <br>
you are able to take a few minutes to go over any mistakes or good <br>
points in your previous solve and try to prepare yourself for the <br>
next one.<br>
<br>
heh heh as I&#x27;m trying to think of more stuff to say I am starting to <br>
doze off.  I&#x27;m going to go to bed now, and hopefully write more <br>
tomorrow when I can again form coherent thoughts :)<br>
<br>
I just couldn&#x27;t wait to post about how wonderful of a time I had at <br>
the competition.<br>
<br>
Good night everyone, I have to sleep for a day to recover :)<br>

You need to install a Perl environment. I just downloaded ActivePerl,<br>
which is free, and it&#x27;s works nicely. You can get it here:<br>
<br>
http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Downl<br>
oad.plex?id=ActivePerl<br>
<br>
Download the MSI for windows, if you use windows, and after the<br>
install execute perl scripts by going into the console and typing<br>
&quot;perl youScript.pl&quot;<br>

where you saved your program and typing the name of the program.

And yes, it does help to have Perl installed.

<br>
You may not have Perl&#x27;s bin directory registered as a path in your<br>
Environment Variables. To set this up:<br>
<br>
-&gt; right-click on my computer and goto properties.<br>
<br>
-&gt; Goto the advanced tab and click the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; button<br>
<br>
-&gt; in the &#x27;system variables&#x27; window, look the the variable &#x27;Path&#x27; and<br>
double-click it.<br>
<br>
-&gt; Now scroll to the end of the Variable value (lower text field) and<br>
add a semicolon, followed by the path of Perl&#x27;s &#x27;bin&#x27; directory. If<br>
you have Perl installed at c:\Perl for example, then you might add the<br>
following:<br>
<br>
;C:\Perl\bin<br>
<br>
-&gt; Click ok and you&#x27;re done. Now try opening a console and using the<br>
&#x27;perl&#x27; command.<br>

          <div class="email-content">13 is not enough, you need 14. Easy to see because with 13 turns you <br>

He created this one for the German Open and it worked very well for <br>
everybody (even for the judges who had never played with a clock <br>

<br>
I myself though will neither use your nor Jaap&#x27;s scrambler because <br>
I&#x27;ve already written my own program nicely printing lines of 15 <br>
random numbers (yeah, that was real hard ;-).<br>

as organize them by times? [like 28.18secs is above 28.19secs] This <br>
would really help automate the internet contests like Saturday <br>

a simple program to occupy a couple of minutes, and because I 
haven&#x27;t seen that many scramblers out there, mainly solvers. I added

I checked the pin positions, but they seem to be correct. Thank you

p.s. That is definitely a very nice notation on Jaap&#x27;s page.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

I am back from a holiday and so is Chris. We will soon update the records
and news, so stay tuned.

It is great to see the fantastic results of the US Nationals.
Congratulations to Macky (all times under 18!!), Jon (US Champion) and Chris
(incredible one-handed solves and great 4x4x4 times).
Congratulations and thanks to Tyson for setting up a great competition.
I hope you all had a great time. It sure looks like that on the pictures I
have seen. You all have some more competition experience now, which is very
important for upcoming competitions.

In 2 weeks we will have the Euro 2004 championships. If you are a European
citizen, and you haven&#x27;t registered yet, then do it right now! You cannot
miss the chance to meet your fellow cube friends.

During my holiday I practiced a lot (my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 broke on the 2nd
day....).
I also tried some new systems. This is a variation that looks promising to
me:
1) orient all edges (max 7 moves and a good start after preinspection)
1a) also get 2 middle layer edges in middle layer (FL and BL)
2) orient all corners (get some oriented corners at DFL/DBL/DBR, then the
rest via 1 algorithm) using R/D/U moves
3) get other 2 middle layer edges (FR/BR) in middle layer (one out of 2 move
algorithms, total max 6 moves)
4) get U layer pieces in U layer, D layer pieces in D layer (this is easy
using R2/L2/U/D moves)
4a) also solving most of middle layer
5) solving rest of middle layer including parity of U layer and D layer
6) PLL U layer
7) PLL D layer

My average number of moves for this system is around 50-55 on top speed. My
times weren&#x27;t that good yet (30&#x27;s, some 20&#x27;s) but that is all about practice
and some good algorithms for step 3.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I updated my Rubik Timer a little bit. It now has a speech interface. It actually talks! The reason for this is that I wanted it to say the seconds, so I don&#x27;t have to look up at the clock to know if I had done my F2L within 15 seconds (which is the goal for me).<br>
<br>
It didn&#x27;t fit into the files section, so you can download it from http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/download/rtt/About.htm, read and follow instructions, or download directly from http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/download/rtt/rttsetup.zip (2.37MB). Yes I know it is ridiculously big (ehm java guys), but it&#x27;s all WAV files. If you just want the timer, you can download that one at just 76KB.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if anyone knows any more features to include, just let me know. And Chris, Dan, Ron, Jess, and anyone else who made a timer once, maybe sometime it would be a good idea to integrate all our features into one big &#x27;unified&#x27; timer, with options for everyone.<br>
<br>
Please take notice that when you run the timer for the first time, the first two seconds might have a hickup, they do on my (slow) system. Just discard the time, and start again.<br>
<br>
One of the things I plan for the future is to enter your name/profile and then upload/update all the times to a central server database, so you can publish your cube log. Another one is pasting a video url next to your recorded time (and I know that kind of thing is already in Jess Bonde&#x27;s ultimate timer, but that has to be online, I like it to be off-line).<br>
<br>

Happy cubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I was just looking at Macky&#x27;s site and thought it was cool that he <br>
included that applet of how he did the 12.11 official world record <br>
solve.<br>
<br>
Well, while it was still fresh in my head here is the same thing for <br>
my 25 sec one handed solve.  It was not a lucky solve in that I <br>
didn&#x27;t skip any steps, but it did have lots of easy F2L cases and <br>
some of my favorite one handed LL algs.<br>
<br>
Here was the scramble (Thanks to Tyson)<br>
U&#x27; F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; F2 R2 B2 F2 D2 R L&#x27; B2 U&#x27; R&#x27; L D2 R2 D2 U&#x27; L2 B L B&#x27; R&#x27; <br>
U&#x27;<br>
<br>
my solution was,<br>
<br>
Extended cross: y R&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; L<br>
FR: R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;<br>
FL: U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; L<br>
BL: U L U L&#x27; U&#x27; L U2 L&#x27;<br>
OLL: R B&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R B R&#x27; B&#x27; U B<br>
PLL: U2 y B2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R x2 F2 L&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; L2<br>
<br>
which works out to 49 moves or about 1.89 moves per second.  That&#x27;s <br>
actually pretty near my limit for one handed twisting speed.  I <br>
don&#x27;t think I can get up to 2 turns per second on average, though I <br>
think 1.9x consistently would be possible with LL algs crafted and <br>
chosen solely for one handed use, one of my long term goals.<br>
<br>
I was able to plan the entire extended cross during the inspection, <br>
which satisfies the &quot;if you worked for it&quot; exception for the <br>
speedcubing.com rules.  I also had one or two more extended cross <br>
solves at the competition, though I can&#x27;t remember if they were one <br>
handed or two handed.  I do think another one of my one handed times <br>
was an Xcross solve though.<br>
<br>
I thought it was cool to see Macky&#x27;s record solve on my own cube so <br>
hopefully someone would be interested in this too.<br>

          <div class="email-content">An interesting note is that you requested the &quot;yellow side&quot; for your 
scramble which means we scrambled your cube with the yellow side as the 
U face and you made your cross on the white face so when you do this 
scramble, scramble with the cross on bottom and it&#x27;ll work out.

<br>
1. Build An extended cross (or a fridrich cross with 3 f2ls)<br>
2. Place 2 F2Ls<br>
3. Place the corner of the last pair, and orient the corners<br>
4. Place the edge of the last F2l pair, and orient all the edges<br>
5. Permute last layer.<br>
<br>
In terms of moves, it averages about the same as the Fridrich <br>
method.  It has about the same amount of algorithms to learn, but I <br>
think the cases are easier to recognize than the orientations.  What <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi there - in my previous posts I&#x27;ve outlined something very like this
method as an extension of my previous which was to use the last middle edge
to orient all the LL edges and one corner.  Your method is a little
different in that I put in all the FL corners and then use the next to
lastmiddle edge to orient corners - where you use the last corner to orient
corners.  I recently figured out the algorithms to do this.  Where are
strategies are the same is in putting the last middle edge in and orienting
the LL edges at the same time.  I&#x27;ll put them in a word document tomorrow
and then I&#x27;ll e-mail you and we can compare algorithms - some of my orient
edge algorithms are a bit long!

You might find it interesting to look at my previous posts (especially on
what I call L2L strategies) where you&#x27;ll see that I am hoping to extend so
that all the middle edges contribute to the LL - position corners, orient
corners, position edges, orient edges.  I like your idea of using the corner
to contribute - wondering if it might be better to try L2L strategies in
this way.

Duncan

a three look ll, but I&#x27;ve been doing absolutely nothing but memorizing algs

I need MAJOR work on the cross, If I solve with it done I shave off 10-12
sec!

so instead, you could do something like this.

Last corner + orient all corners.
Last edge + Permutate all edges.
Permutate corners.

Changes to standalone timer:<br>
An options menu has been added to the file menu. You may now set timer<br>
defaults, like countdown time and whether or not you need confirmation<br>
to reset your session. You may also configure the format for saving<br>
the best/session average to a text file. Enjoy.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Howdy.

Just wanted to add my noise to signal:

I know C: biggest completed project was YANG (yet another name
generator) which parsed a relatively simple set of rules in a file,
then (semi-)randomly concatenated strings (also in the file) according
to those rules; here&#x27;s an example of such a file

&lt;group 0>
4 &quot;1+2&quot;
1 &quot;1+3&quot;

&lt;group 1>
100 &quot;Hello, &quot;

&lt;group 2>
100 &quot;World!&quot;

&lt;group 3>
100 &quot;everyone else&quot;

-- EOF
would generate &quot;Hello, World!&quot; (80%, or 4 / (4+1)) or &quot;Hello, everyone
else&quot; (20%, 1 / (4+1)) :)

anyways, I know HTML + JavaScript (picture slideshow), C++ (towers of
hanoi), Lisp (hello world), [wx]python (notepad), visual basic*, and a
tiny bit of assemly (not even hello world)

*on visual basic: the following program is written by Doug Reed, but
could as well be written by me

---- begin flaming block ----
for i=1 to 100
  msgbox &quot;I hate Visual Basic!&quot;
next i
----- end flaming block -----
s/I hate ([^!]*).*/\1 stinks!/g

I&#x27;ve also written a clock that ticked too slow, and an emulation of an
emulation of a computer (with a 256-byte program space and the
simplest of all functions)


#define FALSE 0
if(FALSE) { cout &lt;&lt; &quot;basic is good&quot;; }

&lt;/noise>

by the way, since this post is acceptably off-topic:
1. Does anyone know of a good way to map a set of permutations onto a
set of integers... say, {(1 2 3 4), (1 2 4 3), ...} onto {1,2,...,24}?
Criteria for beeing good: it should be easy to compute the permutation
given only the number, and vice versa; &quot;carried over&quot; caracteristics
would be good too (odd number &lt;=> odd permutation);

2. If a programming language were to be able to perform &quot;all possible
calculations&quot; (a la a 20+ state Turing Machines), yet only have one
instruction, which instructions would suffice? I know that with NAND
gates and &quot;topologic freedom&quot;, you can produce every simple arithmetic
operation (NOT, AND, OR, XOR, ADD, MUL); the problem is: flow
control... anyways, if any one of you has any insights, feel free to
share ;)

Schaumburg Illinois, it is a branch of the Illinois Institute of <br>
Art.  Its a nice area to visit if you havent been there before. Also <br>
right across the street is the Woodfield mall, Its big and famous.  <br>
As of right now, i&#x27;m still working on trying to get an estimate of <br>
how many people are gonna show, and also trying to keep this as <br>
unoffically official as possible because then those involved may <br>
possibly get in the WCA and host more competitions in the future.  It <br>
looks like i shouldn&#x27;t have much trouble getting rooms from the <br>
school, but still i need to be as precise as possible.  <br>
THe talk is having it sometime late fall/winter.  I set up a poll on <br>
the midwestcubeclub to get some feedback about a good month to do <br>
this. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi

Well just to put an end to all anti-Visual Basic chatter and end the 
war of all flame wars: I like Java. 

And of course, when I said &quot;i have yet to find a computer&quot; I really 
really should have said &quot;..to find a PC with Microsoft Windows 
Operating system newer than windows 95..&quot;. That said, I still like VB 
for some of it&#x27;s characteristics, not being its portability.

I do like java for its portability, clean syntax, lack of runtime 
errors and crashes, and OO features. A lot of it has been fixed in 
VB.NET, but alas, you really need 512MB RAM to let that run smoothly. 
So although Java to me looked generally slow, it now outperforms 
the .NET versions.

Anyway, I also like Python and have programmed several thingies in 
the language (a very elegant alg creator for example). It&#x27;s just that 
when you write for the masses, you should think like the masses, and 
then VB just pops up as a very suitable alternative.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

   Yes the US Nationals were fun.

   I&#x27;ve played with your new method a little bit.

   Try doing 1a and 3 first then see if you can combine steps 1 and 2.
It looks to me that it&#x27;s easier to place the 4 middle edges then
orient all the remaining corners an edges. It&#x27;s often straightforward.
Also sometimes its easier to orient the corners then orient the edges
- fewer moves or quicker to see. 

    You wrote,  > 1a) also get 2 middle layer edges in middle layer
(FL and BL)
   > 3) get other 2 middle layer edges (FR/BR) in middle layer (one
out of 2 move algorithms, total max 6 moves)  At this point the middle
layer is done.
Why do you have the redundancy in > 4a) also solving most of middle
layer &lt; ?

  All in all it&#x27;s an interesting method, sort of combining Gaetan&#x27;s
and my methods.

Thanks,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hey Oliver,

In total there are 24*12*8*27 = 62208 LL cases.  Since possible 
positions can have 4 different rotations on the top (do U or U&#x27; or 
U2 or nothing) then you can divide by 4 to get 15552.  Also one of 
those cases is the solved case (or solved but off by 1 turn) so you 
can subtract 1 out.

There are probably other things going on with symmetry too, so I&#x27;m 
sure you can eliminate lots more cases.  I guess 15551 can be an 
upper bound, but there probably aren&#x27;t that many even counting 
reflections and inverses.  I&#x27;m not entirely certain though, anyone 
have any ideas?

If 53 algs for jessica&#x27;s method turn into 80 counting reflections 
and inverses then the 1211 algs for the LL should turn into less 
than 2000 I&#x27;m assuming (very rough guess).

Hi Olli,

   Will the pictures be in color and if so can any color scheme be put
in, and can I use that spead sheet to put in my own algs?

This calculation is tricky:<br>
<br>
1. The Fridrich orientations have reflections, but not inverses.<br>
2. The Fridrich permutations have reflections and inverses, but in most<br>
   cases they are the same thing.<br>
<br>
So, counting reflections and inverses in Fridrich doesn&#x27;t add much, as<br>
compared to the 1212 cases which have many distinct reflections and<br>
inverses.<br>

          <div class="email-content">3915 or 3916 if you keep the solved case.

Although, I am typically very open minded, I nearly insist (unless 
you really know what your talking about) to simply accept this as 
THE answer. I am pretty sure I understand the question perfectly.

BTW, I deserve credit for verifying the 494 number, since Brent and 
I worked on it together (RE his posts from the other day).

I´m not yet sure how to do it, but probably it would to take me too 
long to make it in colors so most probably it will only show the 
sight on the last layer. We will see.....

It won´t be a problem to have place for own algs.

Hi Jonas,<br>
<br>
You can take the inverse of any algorithm, but the inverse of an<br>
orientation pattern is not defined - it depends on which way you<br>
permute, which is not the concern of an orientation step. In other<br>
words, if I asked you &quot;what is the inverse of this orientation<br>
pattern?&quot;, you would not be able to tell me. ie. It would depend on<br>
which algorithm you used. If one day you find a better algorithm for a<br>
particular orientation case, you might find that the inverse doesn&#x27;t do<br>
what you expect.<br>
<br>
There are, however, three Fridrich orientation cases for which the<br>
inverse of any solution algorithm will always produce the same<br>
orientation pattern. Those are:<br>
<br>
1. all pieces correctly oriented<br>
2. all corners correct, all edges flipped<br>
3. 3 corners twisted, all edges correct<br>
<br>
In (1) and (2), the inverse algorithms do not really produce a distinct<br>
orientation pattern (they produce the original one). In (3), it is the<br>
same as the reflection. (You might also notice it requires permutation<br>
knowledge - different algorithms can leave the 3 twisted corners in<br>
different positions, and so the specific inverse algorithms will require<br>
those 3 corners to be in specific starting positions)<br>

That&#x27;s odd. I just got 3914 (incl solved case, 3913 without).<br>
<br>
The calculation uses Burnside&#x27;s Lemma:<br>
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/theory.htm<br>
<br>
There are indeed 62208 = 4!*4!/2 *3^3 *2^3 positions. Rotating U <br>
doesn&#x27;t quite divide it by 4 since there are some positions that are <br>
not changed by a U2 rotation, and even a few unchanged by a U or U&#x27;.<br>
Burnside accounts for this.<br>
There are 16 = 4*4/2 *1*2 positions unchanged by U or U&#x27;.<br>
There are 384 = 8*8/2 *3*4 positions unchanged by U2.<br>
So burnside gives the answer (62208 + 16+16+384)/4 = 15656 positions <br>
if you don&#x27;t care about U rotations. This does however assume a fixed <br>
colour on the front of the cube. Divide by 4 to account for the <br>
choice of front colour (note that none of the 15656 will be the same <br>
after a cube rotation because they are not the same after a U layer <br>
turn).<br>
This gives 15656/4 = 3914 positions.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi group, Jaap,

Wow. Just... Wow! I mean, this is great. I have written stuff, but 
this is awesome.

I really like the 1 dimensional cube. And I tried a cube with 10 
dimensions, it works like a charm.

And no Java is used. Again and again I have to admit: don&#x27;t 
underestimate the power of JavaScript.

Can you put that one in the links section too, Jaap?

Another thought: Olli wanted to put all LL cases in an Excel 
spreadsheet. Not a very good idea, that would be one mf big sheet. So 
maybe he can use your algorithms and create a HTML page with all the 
algs and pictures. Am I right that the color schema is configurable, 
Jaap?

          <div class="email-content">Why do the positions add? I would of thought that the positions 
subtract becuase they were over-counted.

We are only 2 cases apart, I&#x27;m quite interested to find which 2 
cases are so special as to be double-counted by me or missed by you.

This was my logic: there are 40 OLLs on Jessica&#x27;s page, but 17 have 
no lines of symmetry so there are really 57 OLL patterns in this way 
of counting. Well 58 including the case that the OLL step is 
skipped. There are 17 patterns having only 1 line of symmetry. For 
any of the patterns with 0 or 1 line of symmetry, we have 12 edge 
cases each times 6 corner permutations. That&#x27;s 17*3*72=3672. Of the 
58 OLL patterns, 5 have precisely 2 lines of symmetry. Those have 40 
cases each. Of the 58 OLL patterns, 2 have precisely 4 lines of 
symmetry. Those have 22 cases each. Thus I total 3916.

Perhaps this is a crude way of counting, but we are so close to each 
other, neither method too flawed.

I&#x27;m trying to figure out where you got 16 and 384.

          <div class="email-content">You are wrong, and I can say this with absolute certainty. I think 
it lies in your consideration of certain diagonal corner swap cases

I now fully understand where you got the numbers 16 and 384 from, 
and how to apply the Burnside Lemma towards a variety of situations. 
However, it should be 32 and 384.

To skip the details, I&#x27;ll just provide a conter-example. It is 
*well* known in the cube community that there are precisely 22 PLL 
cases when adopting the type of counting system we are using. 
Applying your logic, we have an initial figure of 4!*4!/2=288. 
The &quot;magic numbers&quot; here would be 8 and 32, or in your own words:
There are 8 = 4*4/2 positions unchanged by U or U&#x27;.
There are 32 = 8*8/2 positions unchanged by U2.
We get (288 + 8+8+32)/4/4=21 PLLs, which is of course wrong (at 
least using this type of counting system).

I don&#x27;t partiularly want to figure it out, but I would say that Burnside&#x27;s Lemma is <br>
definitely the sort of thing that would be used for this. One thing about the <br>
original post that confused me was making an Excel sheet without any <br>
computer help.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you did allow for some computational help one thing you could do <br>
is write some code to spit out sub-optimal) algorithms for every case (say one <br>
per row). That would be fairly straightforward. Then you could paste to a text <br>
file and load into Cube Explorer (if you have it) and let it sort things out for <br>
you. CE should throw give a set of equivalence class representatives. Of <br>
course, generally x|-&gt; x&#x27; is not an isomorphism so you may have to throw out <br>
some more, if you want to have for each x at most one element of {x,x&#x27;}. Also, it <br>
won&#x27;t coun as equivalent positions that are twisted by a U (as you were <br>
wanting).<br>
<br>
On a fairly basic level, you could for example, just work out each corner <br>
orientation (or the LL) and each edge orientation for the LL (as mentioned <br>
there are respectiely 27 and 8 ways to do this). You can run through code to <br>
concatenate them. You can do a similar thing for the 144 orientation <br>
preserving permutations that are even when restricted to the action on either <br>
edges or corners. (Then you can complete the other 144 by concatenating <br>
with any LL permutation which induces an odd permutation on the corners <br>
and on the edges.) After that concatenate with the orientations and put the list <br>
through CE.<br>
<br>
For this you&#x27;d just need 27+8+12+12+1=60 starting algorithms and even then <br>
with  bit of extra planning you can reduce the 27, 8, 12 and 12.<br>

Yes - although not with the extra criteria of odd permuation going to odd 
number. (If you did {0,...,23} i would also carry the identity to 0 (so tha=
t even 
permutation would go to an even number).
I was communicated an example of such a function quite some time ago by 
Robert Israel (he had the identity going to 1) and am using it in BCFSSS as=
 a 
way to enumerate the permutations (with RIP (Robert Israel Permutation) 
codes). Essentially, you just have to use base factorial.

If sigma in S_k is a permutation then a canoncial map to {0,...,k!-1} is 

n(sigma)=sum (sigma(i)-r(i))(k-i)! where the sum is from 1 to k-1 and r(i) =
is the 
cardinality of {j:1&lt;=j&lt;=i and sigma(j)&lt;=sigma(i)}.
It&#x27;s not difficult to show that 1&lt;=r(i)&lt;=sigma(i) and that sigma(i)-r(i)&lt;=k=
-i.
n(identity)=0.
Here n(identity)=0.Robert had 1+sum (sigma(i)-r(i))(k-i)! so his range was =

{1,...,k!}.
It can be reversed easily too.
If you want something that takes odd permutations to odd numbers, then I&#x27;m =

not cerain. My first recommendation would be to try and see if there&#x27;s a 
canonical map from A_n to {0,...,(n!-2)/2} (for n>=2). You could use that t=
o map 
the even integers to even numbers (just multiply by 2). It would still leav=
e the 
problem of getting the odd permutations to work. I suppose one way of doing=
 
it is that if tau is odd then sigma=tau(1 2) is even. So you can use the bi=
jection 
to translate odd permutations to even permutations and hence get an element=
 
of {0,...,(n!-2)/2} which you can multiply by 2 and then add 1 to. (If you =
have an 
odd permutation k must be at least 2, so the permutation (1 2) is always 
available and the construction wil work.) So all you&#x27;d need is a canoncial =
map 
from A_n to {0,...,(n!-2)/2}.

number. (If you did {0,...,23} i would also carry the identity to 0 (so tha=
t even 
permutation would go to an even number).
I was communicated an example of such a function quite some time ago by 
Robert Israel (he had the identity going to 1) and am using it in BCFSSS as=
 a 
way to enumerate the permutations (with RIP (Robert Israel Permutation) 
codes). Essentially, you just have to use base factorial.

If sigma in S_k is a permutation then a canoncial map to {0,...,k!-1} is 

n(sigma)=sum (sigma(i)-r(i))(k-i)! where the sum is from 1 to k-1 and r(i) =
is the 
cardinality of {j:1&lt;=j&lt;=i and sigma(j)&lt;=sigma(i)}.
It&#x27;s not difficult to show that 1&lt;=r(i)&lt;=sigma(i) and that sigma(i)-r(i)&lt;=k=
-i.
n(identity)=0.
Here n(identity)=0.Robert had 1+sum (sigma(i)-r(i))(k-i)! so his range was =

{1,...,k!}.
It can be reversed easily too.
If you want something that takes odd permutations to odd numbers, then I&#x27;m =

not cerain. My first recommendation would be to try and see if there&#x27;s a 
canonical map from A_n to {0,...,(n!-2)/2} (for n>=2). You could use that t=
o map 
the even integers to even numbers (just multiply by 2). It would still leav=
e the 
problem of getting the odd permutations to work. I suppose one way of doing=
 
it is that if tau is odd then sigma=tau(1 2) is even. So you can use the bi=
jection 
to translate odd permutations to even permutations and hence get an element=
 
of {0,...,(n!-2)/2} which you can multiply by 2 and then add 1 to. (If you =
have an 
odd permutation k must be at least 2, so the permutation (1 2) is always 
available and the construction wil work.) So all you&#x27;d need is a canoncial =
map 
from A_n to {0,...,(n!-2)/2}.

on mapping permutations to integers and back again:

this _looks_ pretty simple to implement; however, I
don&#x27;t understand it fully. 

sigma(i) would be the &quot;permuted version of i&quot;, right?
example: sigma = (1 4 2)(5 3); sigma(4)=2
... or is it something else? I haven&#x27;t really done any
math with permutations, other than counting them for
the purpose of probablities.

next up, r(i), the cardinality of {j:1&lt;=j&lt;=i and
sigma(j)&lt;=sigma(i)}; that&#x27;s the number of values for j
that satisfy both conditions?

so, let me just try mapping (1 4 2)(5 3):
n(sigma)=sum (sigma(i)-r(i))(k-i)!

1: 
  r(1) = 1 (always 1)
  (4 - 1) * (5 - 1)! = 3 * 24 = 72
2:
  r(2) = 1 (tests fail for 1)
  (1 - 1) * (5 - 2)! = 0
3:
  r(3) = 3 (i permutes to highest element, always i)
  (5 - 3) * (5 - 3)! = 2 * 2 = 4
4:
  r(4) = 2 (tests fail for 1, 3)
  (2 - 2) * (5 - 4)! = 0
5:
  r(5) = 3 (tests fail for 1, 3)
  (3 - 3) * (5 - 5)! = 0

sum = 76; sanity check (76 &lt; 5! = 120) passes :)

is this correct?

also, for identity permutations, I get 0 (since r(i) =
sigma(i) = i).

btw, what&#x27;s tau? minimum number of transpositions?

anyways, thanks (a lot) for the fuction.

All this is OK. The only thing I would point out is that you&#x27;ve not 
stated that you&#x27;re looking at a permutation in S_5.
For instance, if you were looking at a permutation in S_6 (where it 
just happened that sigma(6)=6 so the permutation would still be (1 4 
2)(5 3)) then you&#x27;d get a different answer. (The restriction of the 
map from S_6 to S_5 is not the map you get on S_5 itself.)
e.g. in that case you&#x27;d get 3*120+0*24+3*6+0*2+0*1=378.
Note also, that since you were working in S_5, sigma(5)-r(5) would 
have to be 0. (More generally, in S_k, sigma(k)-r(k) must be 0. That 
is r(k)=sigma(k) (because the set of j would be those j which map to 
1,2,...,sigma(k) - sigma(k) of them).) This is quite important - you 
need it to be 0 because 0!=1! - actually, the summand for r(k) wasn&#x27;t 
in the formula, but since you put it in anyway, I figured I might as 
well point this out.)

> 
> btw, what&#x27;s tau? minimum number of transpositions?

No, tau is just another permutation. All I&#x27;m saying is that if you 
have an odd permutation tau then the permutation you get by 
multiplying tau by (1 2) is even. This is obvious from the definition 
of odd and even permutations. The point is if you had a bijection f 
from A_n to {0,...,n!/2-1} (where n>1) then you could get a bijection 
g from S_n\A_n to {0,...,n!/2-1} by simply defining for each odd 
permutation tau, g(tau)=f(tau(1 2)). Then you could construct a 
bijection h from S_n to {0,...,n!-1} that sends odd permutations to 
odd numbers by setting h(sigma)=2*f(sigma) if sigma is even and h
(sigma)=2*g(sigma)+1 if sigma is odd.
Of course, you&#x27;d need to have an f. Clearly it can be done 
lexicographically by order-isomorphism but you were wanting an easy 
function.

> 
> anyways, thanks (a lot) for the fuction.

I saw that you added a file. Not sure what it&#x27;s written in, so I&#x27;ve 
not really looked through it, but it occurs to me that you didn&#x27;t 
stick in the inverse function.

Here&#x27;s something to do the inverse. It&#x27;s ages since I&#x27;ve written any 
C, so it may be slightly bad. In particular I didn&#x27;t put in the 
preprocessor stuff and I just tried to get it to print out the

have had the function return an array (and not made it part of main)

... I&#x27;d have written that as (1 4 2)(5 3)(6); of

what do the stardards say? also, what about the other

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re right (and very informative once I get
the snip), but I think I&#x27;ve found an easier way to my
problem:

there&#x27;s (seemingly) a repeating pattern in parity:
(even, odd, odd, even). this means that parity equals 
((integer mod 4) and 1) xor ((integer mod 4) and 2),
or in other words, 1 &lt;= integer % 4 &lt;= 2. However, I
have not proven the pattern to be omnipresent.

you&#x27;re correct, I didn&#x27;t include the inverse. Also,
it&#x27;s written in python. The following line

   #!/usr/bin/python

tell the shell which program to use as an interpreter.
This is, however, a {Sys V | Unix | Linux}
functionality. Anyways, in python generally, anything
between # and \n is a comment; whitespace indentation
defines the code&#x27;s &quot;block&quot; relation (function
definition, branching; whatever C uses &quot;{ }&quot; for);
specifically to my file: ignore anything between a
pair of &quot;&quot;&quot; (three double-quotes); also, just read the
__int__ function and the r function; they&#x27;re what
matters :)

for more info, tune in on www.python.org; also, ESR
has been interviewed in a great python propaganda...
err, article :)

http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=3882

... anyways, I&#x27;m tired, and I lost track of where I
was going, so goodnight everybody, see you tomorrow :)

You&#x27;re permuting that set? There are 
(230843697339241380472092742683027581083278564571807941132288000000000

Ordinarily, if using disjoint cycle notation, fixed points (cycles of 
length 1) wouldn&#x27;t be noted - at least if the permutation group was 
implicit. (1 3 4 2) would mean 1|->3, 3|->4, 4|->2, 2|->1. I&#x27;m not 
sure I&#x27;ve seen [1 3 4 2]. (Generally that sort of thing is written as 
a 2*n matrix with first row the identity permutation. You could 
eliminate the first row, but I don&#x27;t know if that is at all standard.

Well, that&#x27;s just due to the definition of odd and even (and the 
result that a permutation can&#x27;t be both odd and even).

Read on - it&#x27;s not so easy as you think. (Hint: your proposal will 
always fail where the integer is 24 - in S_k where k>4 of course.)

That&#x27;s actually quite easy to refute. In fact, it fails whenever k>=5 
(where we are looking at S_k) - since you&#x27;re looking at k=54! which 
is far greater than 5, it will fail. The odd permutation (k-4 k-3) 
maps to 24.
Thus, looking at the permutations in S_k:
sigma_1=(k-3 k k-2 k-1) odd
sigma_2=(k-3 k)(k-2 k-1) even
sigma_3=(k-4 k-3) odd
we have n_k(sigma_1)=3*3!+2*2!=22, n_k(sigma_2)=3*3!+2*2!+1=23,
n_k(sigma_3)=1*4!=24, whereas according to your hypothesis 24 should 
correspond to an even permutation.

I&#x27;ve never heard of python. I&#x27;m afraid I really don&#x27;t know much about

          <div class="email-content">Hey Brent,

This came up on the group a long time ago, a year or so I think at 
least, and I think the consesus was pretty much that it would be 
harder than turning it into a 3x3x3.  I tried it a few times and I 
found it hard, but at that time I hadn&#x27;t focused on the 4x4x4 much.  
I tried to form lots of 2x2x1 pieces for the outer layer and also 
for the inner layers.

Thinking about it now, I think you could take any edge group on a 
completely scrambled cube and solve the adjacent centers to each of 
the two edge pieces.  This will form two 2x2x1 pieces on the 
internal parts of the cube.  Do this on say FL.  Now use D,r,R,U,b,B 
to form the 2x2x1 outer pieces for each edge and place it over the d 
and u slice parts.  This forms two complete 2x2x2 pieces on the FL 
edge.

I don&#x27;t really know of a good way to continue, I guess you could 
orient the corners and build all the &quot;outer&quot; 2x2x1 pieces (the 
remaining ones on the U and D faces) then do the central ones with 
commutators.  Then you could do lots of moves in the (R2r2),U,u 
group to form up the &quot;outer&quot; 2x2x1&#x27;s with the &quot;inner&quot; 2x2x1&#x27;s.  Then 
you&#x27;d have a 2x2x2 and the rest goes fast.

I don&#x27;t know if that makes much sense, it&#x27;s kind of weird to explain 
it how I&#x27;m thinking it.  It&#x27;s sort of like doing a Petrus variation 
on the 4x4x4.

Anyway else have any ideas of a better way to go about this?

Chris

It would probably work better as 1x1x1-&gt;2x2x2-&gt;3x3x3-&gt;4x4x4 corners. <br>
i.e. Choose a corner, solve the edges and centers next to it, edges <br>
and centers, etc expanding until solved. Sort of like the beginning <br>
of the Petrus method. Besides, while you form the 2x2x2, you could <br>
have the whole thing solved, rather than having a last step to fix, <br>
which would shave, at bare minimum, 6 or 7 seconds per solve. It <br>
could be a good method, although you&#x27;d have to do a lot of memorizing <br>
algorithms to keep the corners and edges in their same positions. The <br>
advantage of centers-&gt;edges-&gt;3x3x3 is that you only need a few <br>
algorithms and can easily solve pieces without affecting the <br>
previously solved pieces. But, if done right, your idea is good. I&#x27;d <br>
pursue the method. It sounds like a good one.<br>

get it to use my IP to internet. It will only find my local IP. 

And one more thing from me. 
Maybe an option so it could get scrambles from a textfile insted of 
get you a random. So you can take the scrambles from Saturday 
Contest and save them in a textfile and then open them in the timer. 

Sorry for my bad english :(

          <div class="email-content">Hi

I calculated a different number of cases:

There are 58 OLL&#x27;s and 22 PLL&#x27;s (including &#x27;solved&#x27; ones)

2 OLL&#x27;s have 4 lines of symmetry. These OLL&#x27;s have 22 different 
cases each. I agree with Doug here.
Subtotal: 2 x 22 = 44 different cases.

5 OLL&#x27;s have 2 lines of symmetry. These OLL&#x27;s have 42 different 
cases each. Doug assumes 40 here.
Subtotal: 5 x 42 = 210 different cases.

51 OLL&#x27;s have 0 or 1 line of symmetry. These OLL&#x27;s have 74 different 
cases.
Subtotal: 51 x 74 = 3774 different cases.

Total = 44 + 210 + 3774 = 4028 including solved case.

I made a spreadsheet to check the numbers. I got rid of all the 
double cases. That&#x27;s how I found 22, 42 and 74. I might have done 
something wrong here, but I can&#x27;t see what that might be.

Let me know if I did something wrong here.

          <div class="email-content">Good timer Chris, even though I still prefer Dan Knights&#x27; timer for 
its simplicity. Anyway, my opinions for improvements: I would 
suggest that when you click POP, POP shows up in place of the time 
(like on Jess&#x27; timer) but still allow POPs after the first one, just 
display the average as POP or blank untill only 1 POP remains in the 
current average. Also, I would add a &quot;+2&quot; button in case the last 
layer is twisted greater than 45degrees which simply adds 2 seconds 
to the time.

&gt;  &gt; Hey guys (and girls...),<br>
&gt;&gt;  i&#x27;ve been working on my 4x4 lately...and I was thinking: has anyone<br>
&gt;worked on making a 2x2 of the 4x4, instead of making it a 3x3? im<br>
&gt;thinking it would seem way too hard to do so....but if there is an<br>
&gt;efficient way to do this, i think this can be a __great__ speedcubing<br>
&gt;method for the 4x4....rather that, or im just crazy :P.<br>
&gt;&gt;  -bm<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;It would probably work better as 1x1x1-&gt;2x2x2-&gt;3x3x3-&gt;4x4x4 corners.<br>
&gt;i.e. Choose a corner, solve the edges and centers next to it, edges<br>
&gt;and centers, etc expanding until solved. Sort of like the beginning<br>
&gt;of the Petrus method.<br>
<br>
<br>
The core idea I had when I made the &quot;Petrus&quot; method is to build <br>
permanent achievements. Things you don&#x27;t need to break once you built <br>
them, while still retaining as much freedom of movement as possible. <br>
The 2x2x2 is there as the answer to the question &quot;what can I build <br>
that will not conflict with being able to move three sides freely?&quot;, <br>
and the 2x2x3 is the natural progression when going down to 2 moving <br>
sides.<br>
<br>
I remember I tried to translate that concept to 4x4x4 once, but I had <br>
little success and gave up pretty fast. Fast enough that I don&#x27;t <br>
think it should discourage anyone from looking further. I just bore <br>
easily sometimes.<br>
<br>
There are obviously a lot more ways to slice a 4x4x4, so there are <br>
many possible paths for such a method. So it seems reasonable that at <br>
least one of them would be pretty good.<br>
<br>
You can start with a 2x2x2, since that&#x27;s what&#x27;s left from moving the <br>
two outer layers of three sides freely. But you probably wouldn&#x27;t <br>
want to start with a 3x2x1, for example, since there is no sensible <br>
set of moves that leaves that behind. That I can think of, at least.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not very clear on which the shapes are that make sense from that <br>
standpoint, but if you  figure out which they are, you could look <br>
into different possible progressions between them.<br>
<br>
One that springs to my sleepy mind is 2x2x2 -&gt; 2x2x4 -&gt; 3x3x4, <br>
perhaps with 2x3x4 thrown in as an intermediate step.<br>
<br>
This may not lead directly to a great method, but it could be a good <br>
starting point for one. In any case, I have to think there are better <br>
solutions than to just transform it onto a puzzle with bigger market <br>
share.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;p.s. Has anyone noticed how few female speedcubers there are out<br>
&gt;there?<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine anyone who *hasn&#x27;t* noticed that...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working a lot on the 4x4x4 after the US competition and <br>
I&#x27;ve decided to work on a new idea for doing the edges, one which I <br>
had tried a little bit a month or two ago.<br>
<br>
Basically it combines blindfolded memorizing techniques and <br>
speedsolving.  I count the cycles in the edges of the 4x4x4, though <br>
I don&#x27;t memorize the pieces explicitly, just how many of them are in <br>
each cycle.  This gives me a final number of say 3-5 cycles of <br>
varying lengths.  I then determine if the parity of the edges is <br>
even or odd.  Then, when solving, I keep track of every edge parity <br>
changing move (inner slice quarter turns) and solve the centers such <br>
that they end up solved while the edges also have even parity.  This <br>
is something I&#x27;ve just been working on for my speedsolving, and I <br>
will post my ideas about it on my upcoming 4x4x4 page (yes I am <br>
still going to post it, I&#x27;ve just been busy with work and settling <br>
back in after a vacation).<br>
<br>
So anyway I quickly realized that there is a ridiculously easy way <br>
to &quot;cheat&quot; at an online 4x4x4 competition, average etc..<br>
<br>
All you have to do is count the number of inner slice quarter turns <br>
your scrambling algorithm has given you and then you know the parity <br>
of the edges (this can be done easily even while scrambling).  When <br>
doing an actual 4x4x4 average for speedcubing.com I always randomly <br>
scramble my cube for a while (not keeping track of quarter turns) <br>
then I use the computer&#x27;s scrambling algorithm.  This leaves me with <br>
no idea what the parity of the edges is and I solve the cube from <br>
there.<br>
<br>
However, now that I have started thinking about this new method of <br>
solving, I realized that there is an inherent problem with 4x4x4 <br>
solving online.  If we make longer scrambling algorithms, then you <br>
would just have to count more inner slice quarter turns and you <br>
would still successfully determine the parity of the edges, so <br>
having longer scrambling algs won&#x27;t fix this.<br>
<br>
I think we need to add to the rules of speedcubing.com and also any <br>
contests involving a 4x4x4 event, that you cannot count the parity <br>
of the edges using the scrambling algorithm.<br>
<br>
I can say that personally I find it hard to not count the cycles of <br>
an alg if I am scrambling a solved 4x4x4 cube.  That is why now for <br>
my averages where I am solving normal and not trying to count cycles <br>
I always scramble randomly for a while, and not paying attention, <br>
then I use the computer generated alg to get my cube to <br>
an &quot;official&quot; scrambled state with the aid of a computer generated <br>
random alg, and I also have no idea of the parity of the edges.<br>
<br>
Anyway I just think we need to address this, since it is a VERY easy <br>
method to cheat an online 4x4x4 event and I think it needs to be <br>
discussed.<br>
<br>
I know we do things on the honor system anyway, but perhaps we <br>
should add an extra clause for our online rules for 4x4x4 events.<br>
<br>
What does everyone think?<br>

          <div class="email-content">All I meant to say is that you can avoid the &quot;parity error&quot; where 
two edge pieces are switced 100% of the time simply by counting the 
number of inner slice quarter turns on a scrambling alg.

For centers first methods this is a huge advantage.  I&#x27;m not sure 
how much it would help for edges first or Masayuki&#x27;s method, but I 
assume having the extra information would be helpful regardless.

Here&#x27;s an example.

L&#x27;  l2  F  B&#x27;  b  f  u&#x27;  D&#x27;  B  F&#x27;  f2  L&#x27;  F&#x27;  U&#x27;  D2  l  R2  D&#x27;  
l&#x27;  D&#x27;  f&#x27;  b  F&#x27;  L  U&#x27;  r2  f  L&#x27;  D&#x27;  U  u&#x27;  F2  l&#x27;  b  f2  b2  
R&#x27;  F2  l&#x27;  D 

That is a 4x4x4 scrambling alg I got from Jess&#x27; timer.  Now throw 
out all outer face turns and double turn inner slice moves,

b  f  u&#x27; l  l&#x27; f&#x27; b f u&#x27; l&#x27; b l&#x27;

There are 12 inner face quarter turn moves, which is an even number 
so the parity of the edges in this scramble is even.  Now say I had 
counted that while scrambling my cube.  Now I can solve the centers 
in an even number of quarter turns (I would actually just think the 
words &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; every time I do an inner slice quarter turn 
to keep track of the current parity state of the edges).

Once the centers are solved, with the edges having even parity, I 
have avoided the &quot;parity error&quot; meaning I will have no edge group 
flipped while solving as a 3x3x3, and I could be 100% certain of 
that fact.

That&#x27;s all I meant about being able to cheat using the scramble.  I 
personally don&#x27;t do it, and I really don&#x27;t think anyone else does 
either.  However, I wanted to bring it up since it is an inherent 
problem of solving the 4x4x4 cube online.  I just think we need to 
add an extra thing to the rules of speedcubing.com and online 
competitions, so in case anyone gets the idea to actually try this 
later, it will say in the rules that it is not allowed.

People will most likely be speedcubing for a long time, and I wanted 
to add something to our rules so that a year or even a couple years 
from now someone doesn&#x27;t figure this out and then decide to try it.  
It will say in the rules that it is not allowed.  That&#x27;s the best we 
can do I think, since everything is done on the honor system online 
anyway.

I guess it mostly affects centers first solvers, but I think it 
would be a helpful advantage to someone using any 4x4x4 system.

Just my thoughts,
Chris

Oh boy, yet another obvious implementation of some obvious function 
that wears somebody&#x27;s name. I was born too late.

This just enumerates the permutations in lexicographic order. I have 
two suggestions:

1) Instead of &quot;sigma(i)-r[i]&quot; use &quot;p[i]&quot; = |{j:i&lt;j&lt;=k and sigma(j)
&lt;sigma(i)}|. This reflects more directly what happens.

2) Let i run only to k-2, not k-1. This last addend (for i=k-1) only 
describes the &quot;permutation&quot; of the last two elements in sigma and is 
thus either 0 or 1. Instead, add 0 or 1 depending on the &quot;oddness&quot; of 
sigma. This provides the property Jonas asked for and it&#x27;s only a 
small modification.

So overall I suggest
n(sigma) = sum p(i) * (k-i)! + odd(sigma)
where the sum is from 1 to k-2.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I agree something in the rules should be added about this but <br>
perhaps it could be more general such as &quot;the scrambling algorithm <br>

other ways to cheat. Because like GameOfDeath said you could just do <br>
the inverse of the alg if you really wantaed to or even just the <br>

&gt; I think we need to add to the rules of speedcubing.com and also <br>
any <br>
&gt; contests involving a 4x4x4 event, that you cannot count the parity <br>
&gt; of the edges using the scrambling algorithm.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I can say that personally I find it hard to not count the cycles <br>
of <br>
&gt; an alg if I am scrambling a solved 4x4x4 cube.  That is why now <br>
for <br>
&gt; my averages where I am solving normal and not trying to count <br>
cycles <br>
&gt; I always scramble randomly for a while, and not paying attention, <br>
&gt; then I use the computer generated alg to get my cube to <br>
&gt; an &quot;official&quot; scrambled state with the aid of a computer generated <br>
&gt; random alg, and I also have no idea of the parity of the edges.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyway I just think we need to address this, since it is a VERY <br>
easy <br>
&gt; method to cheat an online 4x4x4 event and I think it needs to be <br>
&gt; discussed.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I know we do things on the honor system anyway, but perhaps we <br>
&gt; should add an extra clause for our online rules for 4x4x4 events.<br>

Yes, that would work too. Of course, you&#x27;d have to be able to tell if 
sigma was odd or even efficiently - that&#x27;s easy if sigmais given as a 
product of disjoint cycles but is less obvious otherwise.

I know what you&#x27;re saying but I still don&#x27;t see that t makes much 
difference. If you&#x27;re tha concerned about couning it, just remember 
the scamble and undo it.

Why is it such an advantage? What if you happen to finish solving the 
centres with an odd number of slices when you should have done an 
even number. Then you&#x27;re still going to have to do something else to 
the centres before moving on to the edges.
Suppose for example that he scramble basically just involves 
switching he UF edges and then say slicing oe of the slices like r 
(or whatever notation is used). Are you really going to do something 
different than undoing the slice and then flipping the edge.
I&#x27;d have thought the effot needed to ensure you solve the centres 
with an odd/even number of slices as appropriate would involve more 
time than any correcting algorithms.

this should take a 1*|sigma| matrix notated
permutation (assuming the identity permutation is &#x27;on
top&#x27;) and return the parity.

parity = 0

i = 1
while not i > length(sigma):
  count = 0
  while i is unchecked:
    check i
    i = sigma(i)
    count += 1
  parity = parity XOR parity-of(count)
  while(i is checked and i &lt;= length(sigma)):
    i += 1;

-- the code is untested, but should do the trick;
process: contruct one cycle, switch parity if
appropriate, construct next cycle which has the lowest
non-in-a-cycle number; that is, it follows the
convention for cyclic permutation products.

oh, and thanks to Stefan for pointing out the
preservation of parity.

          <div class="email-content">I am certainly no expert when it comes to 4x4 solving, but I do 
agree with Chris. As a community we should try our best to prevent 
loop-holes in our &quot;rules.&quot; (Things that would not have been 
considered cheating, but should be.) This is definately one of them, 
Heck I&#x27;ve considered it, so it is not that outlandish.

Btw, it&#x27;s an excellent idea to use preinspection time to check for 
edge parity! I find this prospect very exciting.... starting to 
wonder if ppl like Ron have already been doing this :).

However, I do disagree that this information would be an advantage 
in ALL methods. I used to practice the Akimoto method and can&#x27;t 
imagine it being useful there.

I remain confident of my answer. Here is why there cannot be 42 
distinct cases for the 5 OLL pattterns:

I&#x27;m sure everybody would agree that there are 4 corner permutation 
possibilites here (no swap, 2 adjacent swaps, and the diagonal 
swap). This gives a maximum of 4*12=48 cases. Then to prove you 
wrong, it suffices to find more then 6 of these 48 to be similar to 
something else and hence should be ignored.

If no corners are to be swapped then of the 8 3-edge-cycles, I 
assert that FOUR of them should be ignored (identical after U2). If 
corners are to be swapped diagonally, 2 edges can be swapped 
adjecently in 4 ways, I assert that TWO can be ignored. Also, there 
are 4 what I call &quot;twisted-4-edge-cycles,&quot; TWO cases can be dropped 
here.

This totals 8 which contradicts your number (42), but does not 
contradict my number(40).

I can show something similar with your 74 number. Using the Burnside 
Lemma that Jaap has taught us, I can make a minor correction to his 
reasoning to get my result of 3916. Observe that due to the nature 
of the Burnside Lemma reasoning (unless there are some seriously 
false assumptions) even incorrect results cannot be off by too much. 
4028 seems too far off (>100) unless Jaap had a major mistake in his 
logic, which I doubt.

          <div class="email-content">On second thought, it is quite clear why there cannot be more then 
72 cases for ANY of the OLL patterns. There can be at most 6 corner 
permutation possibilities and of course 12 edge possiblities. 
Yielding 72 cases maximum.

Oh, and I don&#x27;t mean to sound rude about it. I have spent A LOT of 
time on this problem (and similar ones) in the past few YEARS. I 
have gotten many, many false results before. My experience now keeps 
me from making too many cube-math &quot;blunders&quot;.

The idea for November was that it would be much cheaper. Disney in August is
very full of tourists. November is still warm and busy but not quite as
manic.
I expect Disney will include free rides or vouchers for competitors and
their families/friends and (hopefully) some special prizes.
I&#x27;m meeting the Disney event people in November (this year) to go through
the competition. They are not &quot;sponsors&quot; and we will have to pay them for
the venue. I am sure they will help with publicity and give us all a good
deal.
The Pop Century Resort complex is pretty cool (Andy C has photos posted on
his site), with huge Cubes as the fire escapes to the 80&#x27;s section. We will
try to block book this section for competitors depending on the discount I
can negotiate in November.

          <div class="email-content">You can do it either way.  The only ones sold by mefferts are the 6 
color versions now, which allows you to run into parity errors, that 
can&#x27;t happen on the 12 color minx.  I have a mefferts megaminx I&#x27;ve 
painted to be 12 colors, and a 12 color tomy megaminx as well.  I 
prefer 12 :)

I recall on the twisty puzzles forum someone mentioning a 10 color 
version as well, though I don&#x27;t remember which company made it.

          <div class="email-content">Lately, I&#x27;ve had newfound joy for cubing. I had an epiphany <br>
recently. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been most concerned about <br>
solving &quot;fast&quot; as I am about solving the cube &quot;well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure there have been times during my 6 years of speedcubing that I <br>
have gotten bored of cubing, but it&#x27;s always temporary. I&#x27;m sure a <br>
lot of my friends think that learning how to cube is all about <br>
memorization (those that not think it&#x27;s too hard) and/or it&#x27;s just <br>
not worth the time and effort. Heck, I&#x27;m sure a lot of beginners out <br>
there think it&#x27;s all about speed and memorization (13 PLLs and 40 <br>
OLLs may be overbearing for beginners). Many ppl think that <br>
after &quot;conquring&quot; the cube [from Pasadena Star article] and cubing <br>
for so long that I&#x27;d be bored of it. But that is certainly not the <br>
case. As long as there are ppl joining our little cube world, there <br>
will be ppl to teach, ppl to amaze, and fellow cubers to respect. <br>
There is never a lack of cube-stuff to learn. One experienced cubist <br>
at Nationals mentioned something to the effect of &quot;there is so much <br>
I can learn about the 4x4..., but there is still much more to learn <br>
about the 3x3 first.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hence, many people have accused me of &quot;showing-off.&quot; But this <br>
couldn&#x27;t be more false. Although I certainly carry the cube with me <br>
everywhere I go, it is NOT to show off; I try to hide my cubing <br>
skills whenever possible. It happens enough that it naturally arises <br>
during conversation. Besides, I know that most ppl just do not <br>
appreciate it as much as a fellow cuber would.<br>
<br>
The times in my life when I&#x27;ve been bored with the cube, I did have <br>
to force myself to practice occasionally in order to keep my speed, <br>
recognition, and algorithms going. As some beginners that are <br>
beginning to slip or recently recovered know, algorithms can be <br>
easily forgotten..., the nice thing is that once you have learned, <br>
forgotten, relearned, forgotten,... enough times it becomes much <br>
easier. Nowadays, I can stop cubing entirely for a few months and <br>
get right back into it quickly without having to look-up algorithms. <br>
I love cube algorithms, somehow you bond with them and they stay <br>
with you all your life. I really admire those cubist that are still <br>
around from the early 80&#x27;s that have carried the art through <br>
the &quot;big drought.&quot;<br>
<br>
So what has prompted me to think of cubing in a new light lately...? <br>
Just today I found that I semi-speedsolved my cube in 40 turns using <br>
my normal method. Although I CLL/ELL instead of OLL/PLL, I counted <br>
only 20 OLLs I don&#x27;t know..., well probably 8 now :). It&#x27;s because, <br>
the past week I have learned dozens of new algorithms, or in many <br>
cases started actively equipping some algs that were only half-<br>
learned. I try to memorize 3-6 algorithms per day. And I&#x27;m amazed at <br>
how quickly they sink in!<br>
<br>
I used to say to cubers that it is getting kinda frequent (5%) that <br>
I solve the LL in 1-Alg. Now it&#x27;s getting very frequent that I solve <br>
LL in 1-Alg twice in a row, and by frequent I mean within any given <br>
sitting. It has already happened a couple times that I do this FOUR <br>
times in a row. This leads me to estimate that I can do a 1-look LL <br>
20-25% of the time now, which I find quite fantastic. (Wonder how <br>
long it will last.) Note to beginners going for speed: Is it worth <br>
doing a rarely used 1-Look Alg that takes longer then the 2 algs in <br>
a 2-looks system instead of just those 2 algs? The answer may come <br>
as a suprise, but certain people would prioritize things differently <br>
then what may seem obvious.<br>
<br>
At Toronto but probably much more so in Pasadena, I felt a sense of <br>
regret that I&#x27;m not on the Fridrich method boat and that I wanted to <br>
convert to using the Fridrich method. But that is not the case now. <br>
It actually *feels* pretty cool to be using something I developed <br>
myself; also thanks to support from Chris in coming to grips with <br>
this. I am instead opting to advance my method.<br>
<br>
Probably not the best thing to do for speed, I choose to switch from <br>
a 2-Look LL method to a 1-Look LL method. (I&#x27;m sure many experts <br>
would agree that this is terrible for speed, contrary to what some <br>
beginners might think.) I believe it will give me great insight into <br>
the cube, leading to some sort of LL-theory that I find fascinating. <br>
And not care so much about *speed*. Speed is a big buzzword in our <br>
community, is it not? I ask: &quot;When did speed supercede Knowledge?&quot; I <br>
believe a blind-strive for speed detours us from our pursuit of <br>
knowledge. There are many cubers much slower then par (I guess par <br>
is now defined to be 23s-28s) that started cubing 20 years ago and <br>
could teach us a lot about the cube, not just how to solve it fast. <br>
Those that claim to &quot;love the cube&quot;, do you really love every aspect <br>
of the cube or just love speedsolving it?<br>
<br>
So in the beginning, why did I train for speed if not to impress my <br>
friends... it was simply to be able to hold the attention of a crowd <br>
if need be. I never cared much about impressing. The only people I&#x27;d <br>
always strived to impress with my cube skills are fellow cubers, <br>
especially those much faster then me!<br>
<br>
So my message is: If things start getting boring, there is more to <br>
the cube then you think, and if your still bored, just hang in there!<br>

Hi Doug,

Sure, there&#x27;s more than speed to cubing!

There are days where I definitely suck. I feel too old, or tired, and
I hardly get sub20 times (french championships being the worst of them
all). That&#x27;s when I like to go back to design board and try to
understand how sequences work for example. Most of the time, I try to
optimize my solvings in order to include more and more optimizations
when going full speed (it&#x27;s beginning to pay off).

Doing things right, and not fast, is very interesting. There are many
basic principles in cubing I like very much. That&#x27;s why I recently
made a page for beginners about commutators on my site. That&#x27;s the
kind of things that make you enlightened when you finally get it.

If you can solve that last layer in 1 alg 25% of the time, it&#x27;s really
impressive. But can you do this using (almost) optimal sequences? I
mean, if you need 5 prepositioning moves before applying a sequence
(and 5 more after), is it really worth it? Yes it it, because at least
it&#x27;s &quot;1 look&quot;, and you made it without the help of a computer.

PS: By the way, I consider the simple PLL sequence
(LU&#x27;RU2L&#x27;UR&#x27;)(F&#x27;B&#x27;U2FB) as 2 &quot;algs&quot; ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m working on my L2L4 strategy (see earlier posts).  After completing the<br>
first layer I can now:<br>
<br>
1. Put in the 1st middle edge and orient all LL corners (27 algorithms)<br>
2. Put in the 2nd middle edge and position those LL corners (12 algorithms)<br>
3. Put in the 3rd middle edge and orient the LL edges (without affecting<br>
corners) (8 algorithms)<br>
<br>
As all these algorithms are generated manually I am sure they are not<br>
optimal but most are not so bad either.  There are a few that will benefit<br>
from some extra thought and/or eventually some computing power.<br>
<br>
The final step is to position the last 5 edges - that is the last middle<br>
edge and the oriented LL edges.  There appear to be 12 cases - the 3-cycles<br>
and 2-pair swaps have been easy to work out but I am struggling with<br>
5-cycles of edges without losing orientation.<br>
<br>
The problem is that I haven&#x27;t really come across many 5-cycles of edges<br>
before.  Typically when searching for algorithms there are a few &quot;base&quot;<br>
moves that can be used as a starting block for lots of other ideas. For<br>
example U2R&#x27;LF2RL&#x27; is the starting point for lots of edge 3-cycle ideas.  I<br>
only know of one 5-cycle which is RL&#x27;UR&#x27;LF&#x27; (and similar) and I&#x27;m not being<br>
very successful at finding ways to make it affect the pieces I want in the<br>
way I want!<br>
<br>
So - does anyone know of any other edge 5-cycles?  I don&#x27;t know much about<br>
the corners first method which from its name suggests it might yield a good<br>
number of clever edge moves that I could find useful - can anyone advise<br>
whether this would help and tell me where I can find detail on the edge<br>
moves for corners first?<br>
<br>
Any help gladly recieved.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s another easy way to determine the parity, given the permutation 
in &quot;array format&quot;:

int parity ( int[] p, int n ){
____int result = 0;
____for( int i=1; i&lt;n; i++ )
________for( int j=0; j&lt;i; j++ )
____________if( p[i] &lt; p[j] )
________________result = 1 - result;
____return result;
}

This simply counts (modulo 2) the number of pairs that are in wrong 
order. It takes quadratic time but the conversion from permutation to 
integer needs that as well so who cares.

Also, you could simply add the p(i) values since that&#x27;s pretty much 
the same job.

cheaters.  If you have the time and patience to figure out how to <br>

I second that.

... however, I second anything that has just a tad of
sense to it :D ... and I love to learn.

PS. I mal-operated my browser, which is why the double
post. Apologies for waste of time, bandwidth and
oxygen.

AND it was the most crowded time of year.  I&#x27;d rather go when the

Whenever this takes place, Dave, thanks to Seven Towns for providing

I think you are. It&#x27;s not so much about methods, but<br>
about the fact that you can obtain information from<br>
the scrambling algorithm which you were actually<br>
supposed to  spend pre-inspection time on.<br>
<br>
In other words, the effect of a scramble algorithm<br>
_should_ be the same, no matter who does it: zero<br>
information for the cuber before inspection; the cube<br>
is sufficiently randomized (or semi-randomized, if you<br>
wanna go into that discussion).<br>

Actually, the conversions permutation&lt;->integer can be done in linear 
time, using a method due to Myrvold &amp; Ruskey.  It is not difficult to 
implement, and although there are significant O(N) overheads in both 
memory and time, I find it worthwhile even for N as small as 8.  See 
www.cs.uvic.ca/~ruskey/Publications/RankPerm.html for details.

          <div class="email-content">It seems to me that the parity error should only show up about 50% of 
the time, but I managed to have to deal with it every time I tried 
solving it.  I was planning on doing a 12-color Megaminx anyway.  
Maybe I could get two sets of colors for the regular cube (but don&#x27;t 
most of them have white?).

I&#x27;d like to get the template if you don&#x27;t mind.

Someone suggested I superglue the pieces back on.  I thought about 
that, but the problem is, when the first few fell off I didn&#x27;t notice 
until a day or two later so I have no clue where all of the pieces 
are.  I was halfway in the middle of a solve and didn&#x27;t feel like 
remembering where the missing pieces went so I took it apart and re-
assembled the best I could, then peeled off the remaining bad 
stickers to get it in the solved state (sort of).  I must say it was 
a lot more fun than when a seven-year old was playing with my Revenge 
and one of the pieces fell out.  It was sufficiently screwed up that 
I didn&#x27;t want to guess which way the piece went back in, so I 
literally had to take the whole thing apart.

   Can you tell me why the official colers were changed a few years
ago from red/orange, blue/white, green/yellow with one corner
red/yellow/blue clockwise, to red/orange, blue/green, white/yellow
with one corner blue/orange/yellow? Why did you switch blue and yellow?

Thanks a lot for pointing out that work. I&#x27;ve been wondering quite

colors are &quot;similar&quot;. And for blindfold cubing I can easily order the 
pairs of opposite sides according to brightness. Plus, Lars Petrus (I

by adding yellow.

Don&#x27;t know how that affects speed, but I&#x27;m used to it and like it. And 
for the above reasons I love it simply for its beauty.

Strangely, the 2x2s and 3x3 keychains recently switched to white 
opposite blue in German stores. But I think Dave Jones told me 
Seventowns is not happy with it...

I totally agree with that. For example, I also think that it should be <br>
forbidden to orient the cube as a whole when you do non-inspection <br>
records (some people do). I also use random initial button states for <br>
Rubik&#x27;s clock. Simply because when I&#x27;m alone I try to simulate the <br>
situation that somebody who doesn&#x27;t know the puzzle scrambles it for <br>
me. One exception, though: For Square-1 I don&#x27;t leave the puzzle with <br>
a quarter turn through the middle (e.g. the way it&#x27;s sold I think). <br>
Maybe I/we should ;-)<br>

Speaking of megaminx and getting bored of 3x3x3 speedcubing ;-)

Does anyone have any idea if there exists an easy solution for the 
megaminx 2-generator problem? Ie a solution for the &lt;U,F> subgroup. 
Speaking about the megaminx. Has anyone tried supersolving a 
megaminx? That is, does anyone take into consideration center 
orientation when they solve it? Anyone has easy supergroup algs for 
it? Well, at least the latter problem is much harder than for the 
3x3x3 cubes due to the lack of middle slice moves ;-)

And how about a &quot;5x5x5&quot; equivalent version of the megaminx? That 
would be quite awesome. I&#x27;d rather see that than a 6x6x6 cube or 
7x7x7 cube, which is just more of the same :D

Clicked them all plus many others - BCFSSS is a big project, have 
clicked well over 60,000 algs. so far - maybe even 70,000. Each alg. 
has generally had 3+ clicks - 2-stage alg. (to get a decent upper 
bound - possibly several clicks), tick the box, optimize - except for 
superflip I just used an already optimized algorithm. Now that I&#x27;m 
looking at getting the orientations sorted (I don&#x27;t mean what BCFTSS 
had - i.e. 4,234 algorithms - but rather the BCFSSS version of 
4,478,976 algorithms - in which I realized I&#x27;d got one of the 2187 
corner orientation algorithms wrong.) I&#x27;m trying to be a bit smarter 
about things in order to speed it up now. Then back to edge 
permutations, but with over 200,000,000 of them I guess I can&#x27;t 
finish. No command line stuff. I tried Mike Reid&#x27;s solver late last 
week, but it appears to only take 1 cube at oncde and had been on it 
for a day and a half or so when I accidentally quit.
(Cube Explorer did take 18,000+ or maybe even 19,000+ minutes to 
optimize one of the algorithms. It was 19 moves (HTM).

<br>
Haven&#x27;t really tried it yet, but a while ago I constructed an <br>
algorithm to orient a single center in 20 moves or so I think. It was <br>
just a commutator that was a five-cycle of the corner-edge pairs of <br>
the face/layer, you should be able to find it easily. It&#x27;s easy to <br>
choose any orientation you want just by choosing x in U^x. Thank god 5 <br>
is prime.<br>
<br>
&gt; due to the lack of middle slice moves ;-)<br>
<br>
What are you talking about? Think of &quot;R L&#x27;&quot; as a middle slice move. <br>
Using this, it&#x27;s also easy to build a two-U-edge-flip using a <br>
mono-flip (at UF) in a commutator. That&#x27;s... uh... 18 face turns. Can <br>
you find it?<br>
<br>

You might want to try ACube, it&#x27;s fairly fast. At least a lot faster 
than Mike Reid&#x27;s solver I think.

I have been experimenting with non-corner-orientation-preserving

The one I was trying to get done on Mike&#x27;s was either 19 or 20 turns. 
It had already got through depth 18 when I accidently quit (and I had 
an upper bound of 20 from Cube Explorer).

Let me know if you need any specific ones. I&#x27;ve got 20,160 
orientation-preserving corner permutations (optimized in HTM) for my 
blindfold method. Of course, I&#x27;m not going to give out the whole lot, 
but I could pass on some if you were in need;.

Well, i can see how it&#x27;s gonna be done. Should be 21 or 23 moves 
using 2 edge-corner-pair 3-cycles and then finally turning the 
affected layer to &quot;restore&quot; the 5-cycle. Umm cancellations could 
bring this number down ;-)

Hmm yes, but combining several of those don&#x27;t have the nice 
preserving properties of the 3x3x3 equivalents. On 3x3x3 cube one can 
construct many nice supergroup algs solely using middle slice moves ;-
) However i have found an &quot;easy&quot; but not too short single center 
rotation like this on the megaminx : (U&#x27;R&#x27;UR&#x27;)12 = [R]

Yes thank you i have found that one. But out there exists an 16 move 
solution which does not appear to be a commutator: M3a 2 flip...(ul, 
uf) R- F- U+ L- U- L+ F+ R+ L+ F+ U- R+ U+ R- F- L-...(16f, 16u)

          <div class="email-content">Oh yes I love ACube. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years, I haven&#x27;t 
seen the new version of it; I still use the comand-line version. It 
comes in handy occassionally and was very helpful in optimizing my 
ELL set when I was working out the details to my method. It is 
possible to have some sort of simple parsing program make up a list 
of scrambles/inputs for the program into a txt file and then Batch-
run ACube on it. This is helpful when you want to do 1000s of cases 
at once, leaving the computer on overnight or all week.

Many times I don&#x27;t like the algs on other ppl&#x27;s sites and must see a 
list of about 100 optimal algs and choose carefully out of them to 
find somthing that will fit my hands best. Lately it has been 
optimizing the C/E Pairing algs for the Z-B method. I don&#x27;t like 
those that start with something like (U2D2) and am int he process of 
replacing those. I&#x27;m going for a print-sheet for learners of the Z-B 
method that lists algorithms in a VERY compact way and in a 
recursive manner (for some cases it gives a few turns to convert to 
a simplier case).

Looking at the original post I believe something needs to be 
clearified in your L2L4 method. I counted cases in your step right 
after 1-Layer. I got 59 algorithms counting cases in the most 
minimalistic way I know without combining inverse cases. 
Traditionally we do not combine inverse cases when talking about 
these sorts of steps. There are 7 COLL patterns that can occure on 
the LL if you count both sune possibilites together. The edge can be 
in 3 edge slots (ignoring mirrors) if not in the LL and flipped in 2 
differernt ways for each. This gives 7*6-1=41 (minus 1 for solved). 
I add the 18 cases where the edge is located on LL for 59. Even with 
combining inverses I can&#x27;t imagine the number dropping to 27.

I&#x27;m so happy I have a very fast PC for the past 2 yrs (512 
RDRAM), :).

Are u thinking about : (RaUaFa)2 [12-HTM] ?? This one is a classic 
discussed in David Singmaster&#x27;s Notes on Rubik&#x27;s Magic Cube :D I have 
found an equally simple solution which does not mess with the 
centers :
(RaF&#x27;aUaR&#x27;aFaU&#x27;a) [12-HTM]

I recall that i also have an easy 6-flip which is nice to the 
centers ;-) But i will need to look up that at home in my old notes :D

Here&#x27;s an old 4-flip classic : (MD&#x27;)4 [12-HTM] This ome messes badly 
with the centers ... LOL ...

          <div class="email-content">While I&#x27;m on a roll here, verifying the 494 and 3916 figures, I <br>
might as well give a through explanation of another computation I <br>
had worked on a few days ago.<br>
<br>
It concerns a method that was mentioned here a long time ago. <br>
Someone suggested a method where you leave 7 pieces: 4 corners and 3 <br>
edges. It&#x27;s not your traditional LL, these pieces lie in some sort <br>
of &#x27;Y&#x27; shape, where we have 3 2x2x3 blocks finished overlapping in a <br>
2x2x2 block if you follow.<br>
<br>
RichardP had been investigating this method (not sure if he is now), <br>
and was curious how many cases there are in total using our, I guess <br>
I&#x27;ll call it &quot;standard way&quot; of case-couuting. Note that some people <br>
prefer other ways, such as, grouping mirrors+inverses or grouping <br>
mirrors but not inverses (these 3 are the most popular but there are <br>
others). I actually prefer grouping mirrors and inverses, which is <br>
natural since I am a CLL kinda guy, and it really helps with the <br>
progression to 1-Look LL. In each count we may or may not include <br>
the solved case, but it seems logical to always include it by <br>
default.<br>
<br>
I believe there are 2610 such case in the standard count. Here is <br>
how I arrived at the number:<br>
10 Corner Permutation &quot;patterns&quot; (3 are rotationally symmetric)<br>
11 Corner Orientation &quot;patterns&quot; (3 are rotationally symmetric)<br>
4 Edge Flip possibilities (with rotation fixed)<br>
3 Edge Perm possibilities (with rotation fixed)<br>
To get a total for the corner cases, we could guess 10*11*3=330, <br>
where the 3 comes in since there are 3 ways the pattern-pairs can be <br>
combined. But we&#x27;d be wrong; (7+8+3)*3=108 cases have been triple-<br>
counted. If one or both patterns are rotationally symmetric then <br>
there is only 1 way they can be combined not 3. This gives a total <br>
of precisely 222 corner cases, 9 of which are still symmetric. Of <br>
the symmetric cases flipping and two edges is equivalent thus <br>
cutting the cases in half. (Note that all 9 symmetric cases have <br>
even permutation parity and hence edge permutation is 1 or 3 <br>
symmetric cases.)<br>
<br>
So the total comes from (222-9)*12 + 9*6 = 2610.<br>
<br>
I am not completely certain about the final result, there may be <br>
mistakes, but due to the nature of my reasoning it is possible there <br>
is less but certainly not more.<br>
<br>
In case your curious, what about splitting this into 2 popular 2-<br>
Look systems? I claim the following:<br>
<br>
All Corners: 222<br>
Then All Edges: 6<br>

          <div class="email-content">I understand that the use of other algorithms are oftenly used to 
orient more than 2 pieces, but oftenly, orienting is the easiest 
part. (At least for me it is). But permutating is much harder and no 
one seems to use more than 3 cycles. Which is only why I got 
interested in other cycles. I use other algorithms like you, 2 x 2 
cycles but nothing more. But permutating for more than 3 cycles seems 
to not have been used anywhere yet. Although this one that I stated 
(R2 U)x6 seems to put most &quot;moved&quot; pieces in the U layer and one on 
the down layer. Like that you could fix pieces much faster if you 
could understand how the cycle work which is very easy to figure out.

          <div class="email-content">Also a cycle derived from the inital algorithm : (R2 U)x6 + (R2 U-) 
x6 leaves some interesting result.
What I like is that it deals with pieces of the U layer and one on 
the D layer. although the 3 cycle is very easy to fix with a simple U-
 R2 3 cycle R2 U, I believe that this algorithm is still fast to do 
and simple enough to perform over the setup + cycle.

          <div class="email-content">I posted a while back about this and I think (at least for a LBL 
method) the old color scheme is better. This is bacause the adjacent 
colors are similar. This makes distinguishing pieces in the F2L much 
easier. With the new color scheme all edge pieces in the F2L 
are &quot;similar&quot; to all others except maybe the one opposite from it. 
With the old scheme you don&#x27;t have this problem with the blue/green 
similarity. You still do with the similarity between red and orange 
but that isn&#x27;t bad, especially if the orange is the old bright 
orange. In theory it would make recognition faster, mistakes less 
probable, and times faster. I haven&#x27;t tested this though because it 
takes a while to get used to a different scheme and switching back

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris, and Everybody,

   If we took a vote, I think a lot of people would vote for the
scheme they are used to.

   I&#x27;m used to the old color scheme, and I like it fine. My main
problem with the colors as they are is mostly the similarity of the
the shades of blue and green. 

   If I use a cube with the present colors, when the light is getting
dim, like towards the end of the day, I start making mistakes because
of that similarity. Errrors regarding blue and green are too easy
because there&#x27;s no shade differential to rely on. 
   At that point I can switch to using a Deluxe no problem because the
green is much lighter than the blue, and I rarely if ever make parity
errors on the Deluxe.

Regards,

David J

Here&#x27;s a 5-edge cycle I found: R2B2R2UR2B2R2U. This one also permutes 
4 pieces on U layer and 1 on D layer.... But I find that during the 
time it takes to think of and actually do the setup move (and the 
inverse afterwards) I can get about 2 more 3-cycles done, so I don&#x27;t 
even think about using it. If we&#x27;re really serious about using 5-
cycles to our advantage, we&#x27;ll need more algorithms.

I&#x27;ve got time to list the moves I need now.  There are 6 5-cycles needed to<br>
put in one middle edge and the LL edges without affecting corners at all and<br>
preserving all the LL edge orientations.<br>

My set up is that the LL is on the F face and that the FL edge needs to move<br>
to the RU middle edge in that orientation (thats is F goes to R and L goes<br>
to U).  The cases are then:<br>
<br>
1. FL -&gt; RU -&gt; FU -&gt; FR -&gt; FD -&gt; FL<br>
2. FL -&gt; RU -&gt; FU -&gt; FD -&gt; FR -&gt; FL<br>

&gt;    If I use a cube with the present colors, when the light is getting<br>
&gt; dim, like towards the end of the day, I start making mistakes because<br>
&gt; of that similarity.<br>
<br>
I do agree. Now I found nice colors for my restickered cubes, and they<br>
look like this:<br>

(orange is brighter than it looks on the picture)<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;    If we took a vote, I think a lot of people would vote for the<br>
&gt; scheme they are used to.<br>
<br>
Right, that&#x27;s the most important thing. I&#x27;ve seen people beating<br>
records on cubes where you could hardly make any difference between<br>
stickers.<br>
Long ago, I had a black side. I don&#x27;t have it anymore because I<br>
decided to switch to standard colors. But I regret it, color<br>
discrimination was much easier.<br>

As long as it&#x27;s on a weekend (and it is), I can almost definitely 
make it. And like a few people said before me, it&#x27;ll be great to have 
the park practically empty except for speed cubers.
Who&#x27;s up for a 3x3x3 race on Thunder Mountain?!?!?!?

You&#x27;re welcome -- btw, you can adapt the Myrvold-Ruskey method to 
calculate the permutation parity, just by keeping track of the number 
of non-trivial swaps (you can make some obvious simplifications, too, 
when parity is all you need).  I have used this myself, but haven&#x27;t 
made a comparison of the speeds for the parity-only calculation.

You know what sucks, though? I&#x27;m currently switching to a corners

thirty to forty) are useless!! grrr.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Well, i can see how it&#x27;s gonna be done. Should be 21 or 23 moves <br>
&gt; using 2 edge-corner-pair 3-cycles and then finally turning the <br>

&gt; bring this number down ;-)<br>
<br>
Actually I meant what I said: A (direct) 5-cycle. I just tried it <br>
again, it&#x27;s 24 moves. Let &quot;D&quot; be the whole megaminx, just not the <br>
U-layer. Now do [(R&#x27;DR)Ux(R&#x27;D&#x27;R)Ux]*3 where x is the rotation you want <br>

&gt; Yes thank you i have found that one. But out there exists an 16 move <br>

That&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t even thought about it for the 3x3 ;-) But I <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey! I invented that and I was pretty proud too. Well maybe a lot of 
people have. I created it by combining a corner swap alg left over 
from my CF days and sune with a couple cancellations in the middle.
I only use it for J&#x27;s mirror now. I switched to LU&#x27;RU2L&#x27;ULU2L&#x27;R&#x27;U 
for J.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brent,

   What you do is the left handed version of what I do.

   The first two important algs I ever found were: R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;
what Lars calls &quot;sune&quot; which rotate the corners in place, and  R U&#x27; L&#x27;
U R&#x27; U&#x27; L which is the basic two corner wsap. Since the second alg
rotates theree corners it&#x27;s natural to use the sune to rotate them
back. It&#x27;s easy to see that there is overlap:

R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R     U2     L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L
R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L 

U2 takes the place of U&#x27; R&#x27; R U&#x27; so 14 moves become 11.

  I was pretty happy with myself when I found this, but in writing it
down I realise how obvious it is. ;) 

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Chris and I are fighting for the first position on who can make the most updates on his software.<br>
Well, guess what? Here is another update of RubikTimer (2.3 beta). Download it from<br>
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/download/rtt/rttsetup.zip<br>
or<br>
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/download/rtt/RubikTimer.msi<br>
or if you&#x27;re feeling lucky and you have all DLLs you can wish for already<br>
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/download/rtt/RubikTimer.exe and<br>
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/download/rtt/speech.dll<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope someone gets this one working on XP also. Just let me know. Anyway, I made a couple of improvements and just for the fun of it I also put some bugs in. Try to find all of them!<br>
<br>
New:<br>
- Choose your own color<br>
- Settings are actually saved after quitting RubikTimer<br>
- Some improvements on the overal performance (like anyone would notice...)<br>
- and.... the UPLOAD button, which saves all unsaved items in a database on the web.<br>
- view your personal cubelog on the web<br>
- you can enter the scrambling alg for every solve<br>
- totally reworked log-format. If you have a log, please keep it in a safe place and start a new one.<br>
- headers in the log file for easy importing in Excel<br>
<br>
The upload will only make connection with the internet when you click the upload button, and will only save newer solve entries. You can even download the program on holiday and continue solving in your personal log. <br>
<br>
A word about security:<br>
- I built in absolutely no security. So we are back on the honor system. I hope this is a workable situation. The cube log is created based on the name you type in the application. Please type your full name (first + last). If it is really necessary I will add a password box.<br>
<br>
known issues:<br>
- help is outdated<br>
- possible conflicts on XP<br>
- wrong tab order of some form elements<br>
<br>
planned features<br>
- more stats pages and selections<br>
- comparing speedcubers logs<br>
- generate scramble algs<br>
- tk domain (am thinking about the right name)<br>
- multilingual version. I&#x27;d love to get some help here. I need a wav/mp3 file with the numbers 0 up to 60 spoken in your native language, and I trust you say the correct words. ;-). How about japanese, or swedish? I&#x27;ll make a Dutch one myself. And you have to make sure that you finish the sound file within one minute, or you would get weird sound effects (overlapping words). No respectable speedcuber would have a problem with that time limit. Even better would be 59 was files, and maybe the words &quot;second&quot;, &quot;seconds&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;, &quot;minutes&quot;, &quot;go&quot;.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll probably continue blowing this thing up until it beats Microsoft Office. <br>
<br>
Check out my own log: http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/timer/statsbyperson.asp?name=Michiel+van+der+Blonk<br>
As you can see I have tested so much that I already have 88 entries.<br>
<br>
Of course you have to check out Chris&#x27; NetCube also. Well and since I&#x27;m unfortunately not at the EC, I hopefully contribute in other ways.<br>
<br>
happy cubing<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brent,

I see the software removes &quot;unecessary&quot; spaces and ruined what I was
showing, so I&#x27;ll fill those space with Quotation marks [ &quot; ]

R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R &quot;&quot;&quot; U2 &quot;&quot;&quot; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L
R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L

For the &quot;Double Edges Swap Across&quot; try r2 U r2 U2 r2 U r2 ( r is the
slice next to R)

Yes, that&#x27;s all I meant: the permutation is reduced to a sequence of 
transpositions (so you just need to count the number of swaps for 
which i isn&#x27;t sent to i).  I believe there is sample code on Ruskey&#x27;s 
web site somewhere (for ranking perms), but you will probably find it 
easier to skim through Myrvold &amp; Ruskey&#x27;s paper and write your own.

It&#x27;s becoming a nice program. It needs to be funnier though... have 
an option where it starts &quot;booing&quot; after a certain time, :).

Is it supposed to say &quot;minutes&quot; when ever it gets to a minute mark?, 
cuz mine doesn&#x27;t. On buggy hting I found was that it sometimes 
displays more then tot he hundreths of a second, but I&#x27;m not sure 
how to control when it does this. I guess you left a lot of Easter 
Eggs in it.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t use that one, but as I love the one I use (I guess it&#x27;s one of my fastest, if not the fastest, with the corners 3-cycle and the edges 3-cycles ones). It just feels awesome to perform, with a good cube it feels so smooth... So here it is: (RUR&#x27;F&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(R&#x27;FR2U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;).
So here is how I do it. RUR&#x27;F&#x27; is done so the R&#x27; is more a (L&#x27;M&#x27;) and from there, I can easily do F&#x27; with my left index finger. RUR&#x27;U&#x27; is trivial, just make sure you position your right hand during the U&#x27;, then R&#x27;F follows naturally, R2U&#x27; is easy and so is R&#x27;U&#x27;. I just love that one, I had to share. The one you found is nice too, only, there is no way I use it instead of the one I just explained.
My 2 cents...

I&#x27;m afraid we have different orientation set-ups. I&#x27;ll give ypou what 
I&#x27;ve got (it&#x27;s not quite what you want, but someone may find it

When I really start getting fed up with VB I&#x27;ll port the whole thing 
to a java version, so everyone can enjoy.

Thanks for the tip on hashing the passwords. Now all I need is to 
find an md5 alg. Anyway. I am not putting passwords in soon, unless 
there is a huge demand for it.

I suggest the people who downloaded the latest RubikTimer try out the upload button in the Database dialog.<br>
After that go to the stats page by clicking the stats buttons (sounds logical). I added a chat box to the opening page.<br>
<br>
get the latest RubikTimer, v2.3: http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/download/rtt/About.htm<br>

I think you mean U&#x27; where you ahve a U-.... mixing notation would be 
bad. I have been trying to get this one fast. I started using it 
while in Pasadena. I was playing around with this idential sequence 
since I don&#x27;t really like the one I use normally (the one Brent 
mentioned), so I decided to do this one IF it comes at that griping. 
The only tricky part is pulling off the b2 smoothly.

Ok this one is rediculous, it don&#x27;t seem fast at all, or maybe I 
just hate (A B A&#x27; B&#x27;)-type triggers.

OK, here was my first attempt (in f*rtr*n, but it is trivial to 
convert).  A later and faster version just had SWAP inlined and a 
couple of easy optimizations, but it is less transparent.

function indx(perm, loc, s, n)
...implicit none
...integer indx, n, perm(0:*), loc(0:*), s(0:*)
! provide an index for a permutation PERM of N distinct integers,
! 0 to N-1.  LOC and S are workspace arrays.
! Note that &quot;*&quot; above is assumed to be at least N-1.
! This routine destroys PERM (so, if needed, make a copy!)
...integer i

! initialize LOC to inverse of PERM (LOC(I) is the LOCation of I):
...do i = n-1, 0, -1
......loc(perm(i)) = i
...end do

...do i = n-1, 1, -1
......s(i) = perm(i)
......call swap(perm(i),perm(loc(i)))
......call swap(loc(s(i)),loc(i))
...end do

! the following loop could be combined with the previous one if you
! precomputed a table of factorials
...indx = 0
...do i = 1, n-1
......indx = s(i) + (i+1)*indx
...end do
end


subroutine decode(num, perm, n)
...implicit none
...integer num, n, perm(0:*)
! convert the index NUM of a permutation back to a permutation
! of integers 0 to N-1, returning the result in PERM.
! N.B.: NUM is not affected by this.
...integer i, numaux
...numaux = num

! set PERM to the identity:
...do i = n-1, 0, -1
......perm(i) = i
...end do

...do i = n, 1, -1
......call swap(perm(i-1),perm(mod(numaux,i)))
......numaux = numaux / i
...end do
end


subroutine swap(x,y)
...integer x, y, temp
...temp = x
...x = y
...y = temp
end

          <div class="email-content">It is certainly possible if it is indeed one of the several things I

cube&quot; do you mean to get it to this state or to solve it from this 
state? Either way it should be possible. I assume the other 3 sides 
(those I can&#x27;t see in the .gif) is such that all 8 corners are 
solved AND all 12 central-edgies are solved. (Those main pieces seem 
to be solved relative to each other and to the centers, that is also 
to say that the centers look placed.) The only things you have to 
worry about in determining wheatehr or not this setup is possible is 
to make sure there are the proper number of each type/color of 
pieces.

Note further that a randomly assembled 3x3 has a 1/12 chance of 
being solvable, a 4x4 has a 1/3 chance, and a 5x5 has a 1/12 chance. 
Though this information may not fit perfectly into this situation it 
should give you so intuition. (It doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly because your 
going for a certain stickering, not necessarily a certain assembly.)

Ok here&#x27;s the deal..., if I don&#x27;t reply soon to this thread assume 
that I have physically put this pattern on my 5x5 using legal turns. 
This should assure you that it is indeed possible, while making my 
5x5 look snazy for a while :).

beacuse I wan&#x27;t using any special algorithms for this pattern as 
some of the cubist memorize. The first half took about 6 minutes, I 
left the back half in the &quot;opposite twisting&quot; so I had to go through 
and painfully redo those. (I say painfully, cuz my 5x5 is very 
stiff.)

Also, quite annoyingly, your .gif image has the official color 
scheme butchered.

          <div class="email-content">To get faster for the last layer, just do the same algorithm about a 
few hundred times (not necessarily in one cubing session). Don&#x27;t 
memorize it, just /know/ it. have your fingers know it, not your 
brain. Once your fingers know how to move, they can do it as fast or 
as slow as they want.
As for practicing general speed/dexterity, try doing the most moves 
in one minute. Find a finger trick that fits you really well, and 
perform it over and over for one minute. A good goal is somewhere 
around four hundred.
Also do one handed cubing, with both hands.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Livan,

I&#x27;m from Montreal. Do you speak french because my english is poor. 
Do you like a meeting with me live. Exchange algorythm and method is 
cool for me. I wish 3 cubist and more.

4 edge + 4 corner is same fast for the FIRST LAYER that 4 edge after 
8 corner. Same move no more.

My new fast method corner project is 2x2x2 with 2 step, all orient + 
permute final. Algorythm god is 11 move max, my average is 12 move. 
I have a full algorythm for my step 2 final corner. The 2x2x2 is 
human realizable memory and fast speed cube.  I don&#x27;t use 500 algs 
ZZ or 1200 for the last layer fridrich.  

After first layer, solve last 8 edge Waterman method. I had a 
difficulty understand this system. I&#x27;m practice my method already 
1982. Fridrich/ Waterman is official fast method but my step 1 is 
very fast without inspection:)) I need the discussion method edge 
middle layer and the last layer. 

For you&#x27;re meething

I solve the rubik&#x27;s cube while speed calculation multiplication, 
give me a number, I sub 30 secondes, My best brain experience no 
magic.

I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m maybe only one cubist, solve behind back, fast and 
magic. Anyway the trick isn&#x27;t very good not illusion or magic on the 
public. I don&#x27;t pretend the better cubist is important for me, no 
choice:)) I don&#x27;t need to drag a tricky witness in my suitcase no 
thx:))

He once saw a man doing the puzzle behind his back and was inspired 
to try it himself. &quot;I thought this guy has to have extraordinary 
vision or something,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d try it.&quot;  

You believe that it speaks about his mother:)) 
 
I have some trick no magic blindfold but i&#x27;m very slow:)) I recorded

          <div class="email-content">My thoughts exactly Chris!  We must be on the same schedule because I 
just did the same thing with the F2L and my average went from 32 to 
27 just in the past month (also 12-16F2L w/ 10-12LL).  That&#x27;s why I 
brought this up because I feel like the LL is holding me up now 
rather than the F2L like usual.  I see these other guys with 5-7 
seconds on the LL and that sounds much more appealing then my current 
10-12.  I know about 1/3 of the OLL algs, but knowing all of them 
would probably help too.

          <div class="email-content">Meh, don&#x27;t be a baby ... I threw the gif together in pbrush in a 
computer cafe in Hiroshima, far away from my cubes. I didn&#x27;t take 
time to go into details.
I got it right this time, on the bullet train back to Tokyo. It&#x27;s 
just a matter of luck for me, since I don&#x27;t know how to rotate one 
single face (or switch sides of two face-edge-pieces, which is what 
have to be done...) I have to pretty much start all over when I 
realize the last side is turned ...

But the result looks pretty cool.

It was a pain to get the edges right when I first started solving it 
this way, but it gets easier to see what needs to be done.

          <div class="email-content">to get a &quot;cube-in-cube...&quot; for a 3x3, you can use this alg: 
F2 D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R B D&#x27; U B L F2 L U2

On a 5x5, there are two ways to simulate a 3x3: (where a slice is a 
horizontal unit of cubies) 1) the center slice is 1 unit high by 5 
units wide, and the upper &amp; lower slices (outer slices) are 2 units 
high by 5 units wide.  Or, 2) the center slice is 3 units high by 5 
units wide, and the outer slices are 1 by 5. 

I don&#x27;t know how to solve a 5x5, but I have tried this pattern on a 
new 5x5 from the package.  From the solved state, pretend the 5x5 is 
a 3x3 where the center slice is 1 unit high by 5 units wide, and the 
upper &amp; lower slices (outer slices) are 2 units high by 5 units 
wide.  Do the sequence F2 D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R B D&#x27; U B L F2 L U2 , 
noting that the color of the centers.  (note, the sides F, U, &amp; R 
will be grouped together for the pattern, so if F is red, U is Blue, 
and R is yellow, red yellow and blue will be one cube-in-cube...)  
Remember when doing the sequence to do it as a 3x3.  Then, after you 
do that, you should get a cube-in-cube-in-cube.  Do the sequence 
again, but as in the second example for simulating a 3x3.  If you 
make sure you hold the cube the same way (with F always being red or 
whatever) you should get a cube-in-cube-in-cube...etc.  If this 
doesn&#x27;t work, then try the sequence using example 2 then example 1.  
I hope this is understandable... 

Austin

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

I gave this &quot;problem&quot; a shot. Actually 3 hrs of work. Easy to get 
lost when combining various algorithms.

Here is what i came up with:

First some notation.

I use standard notation for middle slice moves as described at 
www.speedcubing.com  M,E and S will move only 1 layer! The very 
middle ones, not 3 layers !!! I follow standard directions for M,E 
and S :-) From left to right on the 5x5x5 we have the following 
layers : R - r - M - l - L  From top to bottom we have : U - u - E - 
d - D  and finally from front to back we have : F - f - S - b - B
That was the notation done. I won&#x27;t use any physical rotations of the 
cube :D

To reach ur cube-in-cube from solved state do the following :

Fa - DL&#x27;u2d2LD&#x27;L&#x27;u2d2L - U&#x27;r2l2URU&#x27;r2l2UR&#x27; - L2D2 - brb&#x27;M&#x27;(bS&#x27;)(r&#x27;M)
(b&#x27;S) - D2L2 - F&#x27;a - RsFsUsRs (46 - HTM)

To go from the pattern back to solved state do the inverse or a 
version based on symmetry.

If anyone finds a better solution please post it! Thanks.

Happy cubing:-)

-Per K-

PS! Using M and S changes orientation of the cube, which is not too 
important anyway...

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: 5x5x5 Cube-in-cube ..?


to get a &quot;cube-in-cube...&quot; for a 3x3, you can use this alg: 
F2 D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R B D&#x27; U B L F2 L U2

On a 5x5, there are two ways to simulate a 3x3: (where a slice is a 
horizontal unit of cubies) 1) the center slice is 1 unit high by 5 
units wide, and the upper &amp; lower slices (outer slices) are 2 units 
high by 5 units wide.  Or, 2) the center slice is 3 units high by 5 
units wide, and the outer slices are 1 by 5. 

I don&#x27;t know how to solve a 5x5, but I have tried this pattern on a 
new 5x5 from the package.  From the solved state, pretend the 5x5 is 
a 3x3 where the center slice is 1 unit high by 5 units wide, and the 
upper &amp; lower slices (outer slices) are 2 units high by 5 units 
wide.  Do the sequence F2 D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R B D&#x27; U B L F2 L U2 , 
noting that the color of the centers.  (note, the sides F, U, &amp; R 
will be grouped together for the pattern, so if F is red, U is Blue, 
and R is yellow, red yellow and blue will be one cube-in-cube...)  
Remember when doing the sequence to do it as a 3x3.  Then, after you 
do that, you should get a cube-in-cube-in-cube.  Do the sequence 
again, but as in the second example for simulating a 3x3.  If you 
make sure you hold the cube the same way (with F always being red or 
whatever) you should get a cube-in-cube-in-cube...etc.  If this 
doesn&#x27;t work, then try the sequence using example 2 then example 1.  
I hope this is understandable...

No problem - I had some spare algorithms hanging about.

I&#x27;m still some way from getting all my algorithms, but I do have 
quite a few optimal ones. (Although I&#x27;d prefer optimal ones in QTM, 
but as far as I know CubeExplorer doesn&#x27;t have that possibility.)
I had a look at ACube (as was suggested). It looks to have a similar 
input method to Mike Reid&#x27;s solver (although with the latter 
entering twists is also possible) and entering like that is not 
exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. (I already have loads of sub-optimal 
algorithms in the B D L U2 R&#x27; ... form so it would be a pain to work 
them into UFR URB UBL ULF ... form (or URF UBR ... whichever way).
I understand that ACube can at least work through batches to some 
extent and that could be useful, bbut I don&#x27;t know that it will 
accept positions from twists.

I&#x27;m not sure BCFSSS will ever be finished.

          <div class="email-content">To me it seems like both are around 32 frames. So just over a 
second, I judge, but it&#x27;s quite subjective. Depends on what you 
count as start and stop. There is of course the problem with not 
using a timing pad... but I feel that there shouldn&#x27;t be a timming 
pad for this. 

So I think they are both about 1.07s, but I&#x27;m not too sure.

I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. : (
I tried R&#x27; F2 L F L F&#x27; L2 F2 L R U L&#x27; U&#x27; (which is short and alread 
optimal to see what I would get out) but it didn&#x27;t do anything, so I 
took out the spaces and that didn&#x27;t work and then I tried RRR 
(instead of R&#x27;), FF instead of F2 etc. but I still couldn&#x27;t get 
anything out. Is there something else I need to do.
Assuming I do get it to work, would it work for batches of 
algorithms? I&#x27;ve got a few million algorithms to optimize which is a 
lot to enter one by one.

          <div class="email-content">
hello, it&#x27;s me again :) Those of you who have paid attention to my
rant will probably know that I&#x27;m starting to study computer science
and math pretty soon. As I&#x27;m pretty sure it at some point will include
writing a big program of my own design, I&#x27;ve begun harvesting ideas.
Of course, writing a cube program has popped into my mind.

So, I thought to myself, what is cube-related and looks like it hasn&#x27;t
been done already? Timers? nah :p ... solvers? We got Cube Explorer.
Programs that no sane person can operate? ACube takes the credit.

intermezzo: I really like Bernard Helmstetters collection, because it
(usually) gives more than one solution for the position you looked up.

What I want (to write) is a program that will do the hard working of
creating (and possibly analyzing) methods (that is, finding algs,
AFAI&#x27;m concerned). So I thought to myself: &quot;what is a method? What
characterizes all methods? Why don&#x27;t Cube Explorer or ACube do the
trick&quot;. And made some obvious observations: A method is a step-by-step
algorithm (mathematically speaking) that when applied correctly can
turn a cube from any state into one specific state: solved. Keyword
here is step-by-step. I haven&#x27;t seen a method that builds something
up, then destroys it later. It might temporarily break it during the
execution of algorithms (cubically speaking), but once the algorithm

better condition. If anyone has a counterexample, please let me know.

But let me get back on track. In the following, let &quot;all&quot; mean &quot;mostly
all&quot;. in all methods, all steps have a clearly definable initial state
and a clearly definable goal state (example: inital is scrambled, goal
is &quot;DF, DR, DB and DL are all correctly positioned and oriented&quot;). So,
why doesn&#x27;t Cube Explorer or ACube do the trick? Well, because they
don&#x27;t accept partial cubes as _both_ initial and final conditions. Of
course, for almost all methods, all states except &lt;scrambled> and
&lt;solved> are both the goal state of one process and the initial state
of the next.

so, what the program(s) should do (according to above rant, in my
mind) is to take an initial condition and a set of rules (e.g.
&quot;exclude symmetric positions&quot;) and convert the conditions/rules into a
list of positions.

Then, for each position, search for algs using a given set of rules
(for example: use only moves URB U&#x27;R&#x27;B&#x27;, stop and output alg if cube
matches &quot;F2L-is-done&quot;).

All while being user-friendly, yet still powerful and scriptable. In
the unix spirit: each program shoud do one small task very well.

since it&#x27;s 2:40 (am), I&#x27;m too tired to rant any longer, so I&#x27;m gonna
stop (very close to) here. Also, apologies for being somewhat longwinded.

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] the ultimate cube program (somewhat longish)



  hello, it&#x27;s me again :) Those of you who have paid attention to my
  rant will probably know that I&#x27;m starting to study computer science
  and math pretty soon. As I&#x27;m pretty sure it at some point will include
  writing a big program of my own design, I&#x27;ve begun harvesting ideas.
  Of course, writing a cube program has popped into my mind.

  So, I thought to myself, what is cube-related and looks like it hasn&#x27;t
  been done already? Timers? nah :p ... solvers? We got Cube Explorer.
  Programs that no sane person can operate? ACube takes the credit.

  intermezzo: I really like Bernard Helmstetters collection, because it
  (usually) gives more than one solution for the position you looked up.

  What I want (to write) is a program that will do the hard working of
  creating (and possibly analyzing) methods (that is, finding algs,
  AFAI&#x27;m concerned). So I thought to myself: &quot;what is a method? What
  characterizes all methods? Why don&#x27;t Cube Explorer or ACube do the
  trick&quot;. And made some obvious observations: A method is a step-by-step
  algorithm (mathematically speaking) that when applied correctly can
  turn a cube from any state into one specific state: solved. Keyword
  here is step-by-step. I haven&#x27;t seen a method that builds something
  up, then destroys it later. It might temporarily break it during the
  execution of algorithms (cubically speaking), but once the algorithm
  is done, you&#x27;ll be having the cube in the same or (usually, hopefully)
  better condition. If anyone has a counterexample, please let me know.

  But let me get back on track. In the following, let &quot;all&quot; mean &quot;mostly
  all&quot;. in all methods, all steps have a clearly definable initial state
  and a clearly definable goal state (example: inital is scrambled, goal

  why doesn&#x27;t Cube Explorer or ACube do the trick? Well, because they
  don&#x27;t accept partial cubes as _both_ initial and final conditions. Of

I&#x27;m actually not that great at speedcubing.  I&#x27;m too lazy to learn 
all of the F2L, OLL and PLL algorithms, so I use a method I learned 
in a book on the solution to the cube with a few of my own tricks to 
speed things up.  I just recently broke 60 seconds.

That was one of the first things I thought of after figuring out the 
megaminx.  It&#x27;s too bad that the mechanics of something like that 
would be such a pain in the butt (although quite fascinating).  It 
would be much easier to just write a program to simulate it.  
Mathematically, you can only fit 12 spheres around an inner sphere, 
so you&#x27;d probably have very little wiggle room.

Incidentally, are there any pictures online of a dis-assembled 
5x5x5?  I would never dream of taking mine apart.  I&#x27;m scared of 
breaking it, but I&#x27;m even more scared of having to re-assemble it.

It&#x27;s at times like these that I wish there were more than five 
regular polyhedra.  Maybe someone could make something analogous to 
the 4-dimensional Rubik&#x27;s cube using the five other regular 4-
dimensional polytopes.  The analogue to the Megaminx is an object 
with 120 3-dimensional faces, all of which would have to have some 
sort of star pattern on them!  Oy vey!

ACube can do this. One idea might be to write a GUI for ACube.

I have one. I long while ago, I posted about my human version of the
Thistlethwaite algorithm. My method for &quot;PHASE 3&quot; tries to get the
corners into the &lt;U2,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2> group. This is difficult to see, so
first I separate the U/D corners into the U and D layers only to destroy
that in the following step...

For the details, here is my original post:

Phase 1 -> &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2> group

	- simple, no algorithms

Phase 2 -> &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2> group

	- Direct up/down edges to up/down face (simple, no algs)
	- Direct corners to up/down face (between 8 and 60 algs)

Phase 3 -> &lt;U2,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2> group

	- Corners (between 1 and 2 algs)
	- Edges (between 1 and 4 algs)

Phase 4 -> place pieces

	- Corners (intuitive)
	- Edges (intuitive)

DETAILS OF STEPS

* PHASE 1

This is solved in 4.6 moves on average.

* PHASE 2 EDGES

This is rather simple. You can learn all 20-30 cases if you wish. I
forget the exact number. This can be solved in an average of 4 moves.

* PHASE 2 CORNERS

I used a method similar to Gaetan - first get 3 corners oriented on one
side, and then apply one of 8 algorithms. It is possible to directly
learn all 60 cases if you want (I can&#x27;t remember the exact number).
I think they have an average of 8.5 moves.

* PHASE 3 CORNERS

In phase 3, it is important to do the corners first, because it is
difficult to see whether they have made it into the U2D2L2R2F2B2 group.
Just getting opposite colours on each side isn&#x27;t enough. The algorithms
you learn to fix this are shorter when you don&#x27;t have to worry about the
edges.

Here, I&#x27;ll just describe the simplest technique that requires two
algorithms, but is very quick for the fingers and brain:

First, separate up/down colours (one colour on each side). Average 3.2
moves. There should be, for example, all red corners on top, and all
orange corners on bottom.

Now, pairs of adjacent corners will either match or mismatch. Our goal
is to make them either all match, or all mismatch. So, in this step, we
find the odd pairs out (whether they&#x27;re matching or mismatching), and
fix them so they match/mismatch like all the rest. There are 4 pairs.
Either one pair is the odd one out, or two pairs are the odd ones out.

For one pair: hold the pair at UF, and do R&#x27;FR&#x27;B2RF&#x27;R. It&#x27;s a
modification of the corner mover that doesn&#x27;t care about the exact
positions of corners.

Two pairs: hold two pairs on F (you may need to move them there), and do
R2UF2U2R2U. (if you needed to move them there first, there&#x27;s also a
trick to get it to work...)

I looked for a long time to find other methods here that used fewer
moves. I found some, but this way was definitely by far the quickest to
perform.

PHASE 3 EDGES

4 cases - simple (2,4,6 or 8 bad edges). Average 6.1 moves.

Total moves so far: 33.4. Obviously, fewer moves are necessary to
achieve an average of 40 moves overall. I worked out some shortcuts, but
I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth it, because I could perform the longer way
faster.

PHASE 4 (the end game)

I think you already have a strategy for this. Corners, then edges. I
think it&#x27;s possible to learn all cases for the edges (about 150 I think,
but easy to memorise). 

A downside is the number of double turns which are more difficult to
perform. But I tried a few algorithms and they are possible to do
quickly enough. I think the main benefit of this method is fast reaction
time and no thinking. Another benefit is that it looks cool when you
solve it. None of the pieces are placed until the very end.

Above, I listed each individual step with no shortcuts. It is possible
to combine steps, or do steps in different orders depending on
opportunities. The basic method above, if you learnt all cases for each
exact step, should give an average of 45.7 moves.

Ryan

ACube and Cube Solver can do this, and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so useful.

- User defined macro-moves as generators.
- Better handling of centers positions when moving slices.
- I can think of high-level criteria based on cubies, properties or
positions, but it could become a bit complicated.

The documentation is pretty good -- everything you need to know is in 
there, and there are quite a few examples.  Input (which you complain 
about) is neat, with some handy shortcuts: it&#x27;s about as simple as 
you can imagine, given the program&#x27;s flexibility.  

ACube can&#x27;t do everything (e.g., solve to specified subgroup, except 
when that can be specified via the twists/flips, allowed moves...), 
but you can still find imaginative uses for the program (see Stefan 
Pochmann&#x27;s solution of 4x4x4 parity problems, for example; this was 
something I also did with it a while back).

I won&#x27;t attempt to defend the sanity of ACube&#x27;s users, which you have 
questioned... I&#x27;ve heard that there are people here who actually 
sp**ds*lve the R*b*k&#x27;s c*be... it&#x27;s that sort of forum, y&#x27;know :)

I have a suggestion: three steps/modules;

1. configuration of initial state
 --- piece position/orientation, facelet position,
rules for in/excluding symmetric positions
 --- this step should generate a list of positions

2. algorithm search (w. configuration);
 --- goal state, min/max search depth, min/max number
of algorithms to find, allowed moves (including
&quot;macros&quot;/algs)
 --- this step should operate on a list of positions
and generate a selection of algorithms.

3. algorithm processing.
 --- rewrite algorithms according to user choices
(&quot;UU&quot; = &quot;U2&quot;, RL&#x27; = M, RUR&#x27;URU2R = &quot; Sune-R &quot;, etc).
I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s the job of a sed script.
 --- generate inverses and mirrors of algs.
 --- calculate &quot;quality measurement&quot; of algs,
according to alg length, which moves or macros are
used (like you suggested), how many faces are being
turned, etc.
 --- display the found algorithms (or the N best, or
only if quality is no less than FOO, or... whatever)

of course, each of the three component programs would
have a wide array of command-line arguments, so that
you can script it any way you want, in the good ol&#x27;
Unics* style ;)
* that&#x27;s &quot;Uniplexed operating and computing system&quot;.

also, regaring the pruning tree, I&#x27;m pretty convinced
that step 2 will include making a pruning tree, so
you&#x27;d just input the generators that generate the
desired subgroup and specify --make-pruning-tree-only
(or whatever it will turn out to be).

you think this will do?
also, does anyone have any other suggestions?

          <div class="email-content">Hi

I bump into these cases once in a while, where it really helps looking
forward and I am able to do two F2L inserts together. They usually account
for my best times. So I think there is something that could help if someone
could categorize the cases that were helpful. I believe Ryan Heise has done
a lot of pre work.
http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/

I can vaguely remember that there should be a page on his site on inserting
two pairs at the same time, but I can&#x27;t find it. Ryan?

Also, another useful tip to get to &#x27;less moves&#x27; in general, and often used
as a technique by several competitors in the FMC is to not care which edge
is aligned with which corner, just the fact that it is connected is good.
For instance, if two edges are already aligned to the wrong corner, than
aligning and inserting the third would end up in a situation that would
require just that plus a 3 cycle of edges to complete the F2L. It is not
always less moves, but in this particular case it is definitely faster.

          <div class="email-content">I personally don&#x27;t insert two complete pairs together, but I try to 
always do two pairs at once if I see &quot;mis-matched&quot; pairs setup.  I 
mean mis-matched pairs in the sense of how stiff hands describes it 
on his site (Olly I think?).  I aways mixup the nickname with the 
real name.

Anyway if the corner of one pair is correctly placed, and the edge 
of another pair is correctly placed, I would line up the bottom 
layer such that the missing corner and edge form a new corner edge 
pair.  Then I solve the mis-matched corner and edge pair into that 
misaligned slot.  When I am done I undo the bottom move setup turn 
and I have solved both pairs at once.

The only other time I place two pairs at once is this setup (solves 
FL and BL).

Do F&#x27; L F U L&#x27; 

If I see this setup (with any U turn afterward to) then I try to 
align it such that I can insert both pairs at once.  It doesn&#x27;t 
happen often, but it comes up enough that I tried to memorize it.

I do agree though, I think learning all the cases would be like 
learning ZB, but I think learning the easy cases to insert two pairs 
would be beneficial to someone&#x27;s times.

I also highly recommen mis-matched pairs.  They take some getting 
used to, but are very helpful for your times when you see one.

<br>
I do remember writing something about this, but I think it was a message<br>
to this group.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I do this at the beginning and end of my solution. At the<br>
beginning, if I find a pair already made I will sometimes use<br>
preinspection to look for other pairs that can be built while working<br>
with the first pair. I don&#x27;t necessarily insert the second pair, but<br>
build it so that it is ready for the next step. I only do this in<br>
preinspection, though, unless I see something really obvious while I&#x27;m<br>
solving.<br>
<br>
By step 3, things are easier. The standard method is to complete the<br>
last corner/edge, but I usually try to form a second corner/edge pair on<br>
top while doing this.<br>
<br>
And of course, in step 4, I join 3 or 4 corners with their edges<br>
simultaneously.<br>

I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve got it on (I seemed to remember sticking it on
ages ago) but actually in IE 5.2 (which I just stuck on my machine
recently) it&#x27;s got an option for java but not for javascript (as I
recall they are different). Maybe the Mac version of IE doesn&#x27;t have
it? Anyway, I was able to get it to work on Netscape. Thanks, it is
good stuff.

I guess I just need to write myself one that&#x27;ll do batches.

Potential here for damaging (straining) the puzzle, but see if you 
can ease off one or more of the corner caps.  There is a screw under 
each cap.  You might need to use a knife if there is a lot of glue 
holding the cap on.

Try it at your own risk :)

Hi<br>
<br>
I tried teflon based spray once, and it almost ruined the cube. I got it out<br>
in time, before it was completely useless. I don&#x27;t know about the specific<br>
brand though. Anyway, I (and a lot of others) recommend using a pure 100%<br>
silicone based spray.<br>
<br>
I have had good lubrication results in the past with body lotion and olive<br>
oil (not at the same time duh) but it appears to be bad for the cube. And<br>
your hands get dirty 8-(. I spray it on about once a week and I have no<br>
complaints. I am still using the same can I got from Ton almost a year ago.<br>

It seems that we all have little slumps here and there.  I know that 
I do.  It should go away soon.  I usually have a slump and then 
within a week start setting new records!

          <div class="email-content">I started learning the rest of my OLL,...and in turn
my F2L slowed down about 2-3 seconds...I don&#x27;t
understand it but I guess I could call it a cubing

now my averages are usually around 24-25 seconds. 
It&#x27;s annoying..Anyone know why my F2L is slowing???

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

   Basically you start out stretching and all of your stretches
improve a little every day, and after a time of steady improvement
suddenly there&#x27;s a day where it seems you can barely stretch at all.
Rather than get discouraged be gentle with your body and within a day
or two you&#x27;ll find that you can easily stretch further than you ever
did before. This is a way your body sets itself to make a leap forward. 

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

I put the cross on bottom most of the time, but for some nice cases 
I swtich to cross on left, then come back to cross on bottom. The 
advantage of cross on bottom is that you can imediately go into OLL 
without cube rotation, so I usually do cross on bottom for the last 
pair.

Macky

p.s. By the way, congratulation on your 5x5x5 blindfolded solve! 
Very impressive! =D

          <div class="email-content">I do it like Macky does. I sort of switch depending on the case at 
hand. It&#x27;s true that having the cross on the bottom allows you to look 
ahead easier, but having the cross on the left makes it extremely easy 
to do cube rotations. This sparks the idea of having the cross on the 
back, which makes cube rotations downright simple, with the drawback 
that you need a lot of F turns.

          <div class="email-content">I had the same problem... my F2L was becoming really bad.  I broke it down
and discovered that my cross was taking 6 seconds when it normally takes 2
or 3 which accounts for the 2 to 3 seconds slowing down.  Did you have
the same issue?

I started practicing a bit by just making sure I could solve the cross in
7 or fewer moves for a bunch of different situations.  I took an average
at lunch today and was able to get under 22.5 which is good... hopefully
it&#x27;ll stay that way.

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Tyson, i put the cross on the right because I&#x27;m a lefty 
but it&#x27;s the same idea. More of my intuitive F2L stuff seems to be 
w/ the cross on right. I learned all the F2L algs for cross on bottom
yet my F2L seems to be split between the 2 orientations and 
sometimes at an angle in between. For a couple cases, i can do it 
either way and just do wich ever one doesn&#x27;t require a rotation. In 
the long run though, I believe it would be better on bottom beacause 
of regocnition, use of both hands, transition to LL. The only 
advantages to having the cross on the side is some fast finger tricks
(not really good for the F2L anyway) and faster cube rotations.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson,

I was actually stuck at a slump right around where you are right 
now, except I was stuck there for about 2 years :)

I seriously doubt you&#x27;ll stay stuck there for that long though lol.  
Anyway I noticed something in high school when I taught a lot of 
people who were pretty near the speed you&#x27;re at.  Almost all of them 
rushed the cross like craaaaaaaaaazy.  Next time you do a solve, 
just relax and try to solve like you normally do.  Look for how 
quickly you turn the faces when solving the cross (full speed, near 
full speed, etc..) and also mentally time the delay between solving 
the cross and starting the moves for the first pair.

The reason I mention that, when I was in my slump I always rushed 
the cross like I absolutely HAD to get it done in 2-3 seconds no 
matter what.  This of course always resulted in a huge delay in 
trying to find the first pair which totally threw off my rhythm.

Now what I do is solve the cross as slowly as I can and spend all of 
my mental effort on trying to find the first corner/edge pair.  I 
seriously do at most 2 turns per second when solving the cross.  
Even recently I&#x27;ve had solves where I did a terrible cross (8-9 
moves) at a slow speed but was able to find a good rhythm and speed 
up during the F2L and still get a 16-17 second solve.

Personally going extra slow on the cross like that helps me to 
slowly speed up and build a steady rhythm during the F2L.

Of course there are lots of different styles when solving.  At the 
US competition it looked to me like Macky was finger tricking the 
cross at full speed, and still there seemed to be no delay for him 
in finding the first c/e pair.  I would say just try experimenting 
and finding your &quot;style&quot;.  Do you prefer finger turns over wrist 
turns most of the time, sometimes, only in certain cases, hardly 
ever?  You&#x27;ve probably reached the limit of just using raw twisting 
speed, now try to find out how your brain works and what style of 
solving (style not solving method) that you prefer.

I may not be the best person to consult here since it took me so 
long to get over the hump you&#x27;re at right now, but here are my two 
cents anyway.

Hi Tyson,

   Basically you start out stretching and all of your stretches
improve a little every day, and after a time of steady improvement
suddenly there&#x27;s a day where it seems you can barely stretch at all.
Rather than get discouraged be gentle with your body and within a day
or two you&#x27;ll find that you can easily stretch further than you ever
did before. This is a way your body sets itself to make a leap forward.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joseph,

I use Prestone brand silicone, which was suggested to me by Dan 
Knights.  Personally I think it works great.  You will have to 
relube about once a week though to keep your cube in good 
speedsolving condition.

http://www.midwayautosupply.com/detailedproductdescription.asp?9554

I know a number of other people use it too.  You can get it at 
pretty much any Walmart, just go to the automotive section.

Hope that helps,
Chris

Almost all sub-23 except for that last one.  Blast.  Anyway, the <br>

all, but no times are under 20.  Is consistency better than speed?  <br>
I&#x27;ll never hit a sub-20 average naturally like this but should I just <br>
keep going at this and will I naturally get faster or do I need to <br>
speed up?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I use the cross on the bottom.  Before I learned all of my f2l, I looked into this...  I prefer cross on the bottom because of recognition, since a major key in f2l is looking ahead, and seeing what you have to do next is important....Since I&#x27;m left handed, and I can use my right hand pretty much as good as my left, I use both my hands equally, and I can get very good f2l times...but hey, this is me, not you. ;0)

I agree with Tyson, i put the cross on the right because I&#x27;m a lefty 
but it&#x27;s the same idea. More of my intuitive F2L stuff seems to be 
w/ the cross on right. I learned all the F2L algs for cross on bottom
yet my F2L seems to be split between the 2 orientations and 
sometimes at an angle in between. For a couple cases, i can do it 
either way and just do wich ever one doesn&#x27;t require a rotation. In 
the long run though, I believe it would be better on bottom beacause 
of regocnition, use of both hands, transition to LL. The only 
advantages to having the cross on the side is some fast finger tricks
(not really good for the F2L anyway) and faster cube rotations.

          <div class="email-content">Slumps happen with anything and cubing is no exception.  I just had 
one last month but in my case I think it was more physical though.  
My fingers and forearms were very tight and sore from a few weeks of 
cubing.  My times slowed down and it was frustrating.  I took 3-4 
days off completely to rest up.  When I came back and got warmed up, 
my average immediately dropped a few seconds.  Think of it as lifting 
weights for your hands.  

Also don&#x27;t forget that the better you are, the harder it is to get 
better.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

I made an observation that might be helpful to the slower cubers (everyone
25+, 30+).

When someone like Chris Hardwick says to go &#x27;slow&#x27; and says two moves per
second, remind yourself this may be very fast for you.

I think we should say go 25-50% slower than your average speed. Or: try to
gradually go faster during your solve.

What I usually do is not use finger tricks on the cross, unless they are
very easy. Then I keep the cross on the left and I perform the F2L in one
fluent go (that is, ideally)... I try to combine moves wherever I can and
usually I can perform the whole thing using only R, R&#x27;, U, U&#x27; and some cube
rotations. I think I can get 3 mps (moves per second) when I am at my
fastest. That usually leaves me with an F2L between 10 and 15 seconds.

My biggest problem is still the last layer, where I sometimes nees 2 seconds
to even see the OLL or PLL case, and some of the algs I cannot perform
faster then 1.5 mps, so I often end up 25 or even higher. So my standard
deviation is horrible. A couple of cases I actually can perform at 4 mps so
then I end up with a sub 20 time. My personal lucky best is 14.91, not lucky
16.09. And then again yesterday I had several 26+ times. You can see so in
my cube log http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/timer/stats.asp

Macky left me some advice in my xanga that everyone says but I&#x27;ve never
listened to until today:

GO SLOW!

Average: 22.26 seconds
Individual Times: 19.66, 19.66, 24.62, (24.74), 23.05, 22.20, (19.58),
24.56, 21.61, 22.01, 21.06, 24.16

Yeah... that was awesome.  Every single time above 23 I know exactly
where I made the mistake.  And the funny part is, I&#x27;m going so slow on
the F2L.  Thanks everyone!

<br>
I guess I&#x27;ll just have to try it on the left for a while to judge it <br>
better. Why do you think it&#x27;s better for look-ahead? I can see about <br>
the same stuff as with cross on bottom. The way Lars does it just <br>
impresses me a lot. He&#x27;s turns so smoothly/fluently the whole time <br>
it&#x27;s amazing. If I compare that to some other very fast people I get <br>
the impression they&#x27;re really hectic.<br>
<br>
&gt; p.s. By the way, congratulation on your 5x5x5 blindfolded solve! <br>
&gt; Very impressive! =D<br>
<br>
You oughta try it, too :-) Not much more difficult than 4x4...<br>

          <div class="email-content">There seem to be two approaches to the corners:<br>
<br>
1. They are difficult, so they should be done first.<br>
2. They are difficult, so they should be done last :-)<br>
<br>
In other words, you can make the corners easier by doing them first. On<br>
the other hand, it is only the last 4 corners that are difficult, and if<br>
you ignore them until the end, the rest of the cube becomes much easier.<br>
<br>
Both approaches seem reasonable, but I prefer the second because it<br>
leaves the cube relatively unconstrained until the very end. In my<br>
experience, it seems much easier for your intuitive mind to see short<br>
solutions in an unconstrained cube, and that is most probably because<br>
there exist shorter solutions in an unconstrained cube.<br>
<br>
I am a big fan of intuitive cubing, which explains why the first 3 steps<br>
of my method are the way they are (they&#x27;re obvious and open to<br>
improvisation). But then, at the end I&#x27;m not able to use my intuition.<br>
<br>
Well, for a while I&#x27;ve been trying to change that, and I&#x27;m starting to<br>
have some success. It turns out that there is not much to learn if you<br>
learn it properly. I plan to delete all of my step 4 algorithms and<br>
write a new page about the new intuitions I&#x27;ve developed (if you want a<br>
copy of my old stuff, you might want to grab it before it disappears:<br>
http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step4.html)<br>
<br>
By the way, I recall a discussion a while ago about understanding how<br>
algorithms work, one of the examples being the 3-cycle of corners:<br>
<br>
R&#x27;UR&#x27; D2 RU&#x27;R&#x27; D2 R2<br>
<br>
There were several different explanations given. Actually, it is only<br>
this simple commutator:<br>
<br>
RUR&#x27; D2 RU&#x27;R&#x27; D2&#x27;<br>
<br>
With a preparation move R2, and restoration R2&#x27;.<br>

I can offer to teach u my simple and reasonably fast layer-by-layer 
method. Or u can ask Lars (Vandenbergh) to teach u his way. His 
method is efficient but u need to be fast to find and set up the 
edges. I know some of it but i let him explain. You can probably 
email him directly ;-)

Best of luck,

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per!

You told me you can use comutators to do some nice things with the 
centers without distubing the edges, remember? I have been 
experimenting with that today :). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s usefull for 
speedcubing in my case, but it sure is fun to find so nice moves 
myself. And maybe I can use some of it if I&#x27;ll ever try solving it 
blindfolded.

Well... I have been told (by Ron) that there was a website that 
explained about pairing up more than one edge in one sequence... Or 
maybe I didn&#x27;t understand him. If anyone here knows something, just 
tell me please.

Tanks,

Joel.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joel,

You can place the edges together by pairs of two up to 6 pairs 
total, so also 2 and 4.

The technique is the same no matter how many edges you are doing 
(2,4 or 6).

I pair up the edges in the d and u layers, but you can do them in 
any two layers.

To pair up multiple edges you first have to pair up the first half 
of the edges.  I&#x27;ll do 2 for my first example.

I&#x27;ll name a piece by it&#x27;s intersecting faces, so the piece in uFL is 
the edge piece directly below the UFL corner.  Think of it as the 
only piece that touches all three faces u, F and L.

Ok so the pieces or your pair are in dFL and uFR.  Doing the move d 
will pair them up in the FR slot.  Ok now before you do that look at 
the piece in dFR.  This piece is half of the second pair you will 
fix.  Ok so find the other piece that belongs with your piece in dFR 
and make sure it is not in the u or d layer (if it is then either 
choose another pair for now or do a few moves to get it out of the u 
or d layer).

Ok so here&#x27;s how the pairing works.  dFL and uFR will pair up when 
you do d.  You also have looked at the color of the piece in dFR and 
the piece that belongs with it is somewhere in the U or D layer 
right now.  Ok now do the turn d and pair up the edge in FR.  Now 
replace the solved edge in FR with the edge pair from the U or D 
layer that contains the other piece you looked around for.  Make 
sure that piece ends up in uFR.  Now once you have that pair placed 
undo the original turn d that you did earlier.  This will pair up 
another pair on FR.

Ok with colors now.  You pair up the green-white edge group in FR 
with a d turn which kicks the red-yellow piece that was in dFR to 
dBR.  Now you replace your solved edge group in FR with the unsolved 
one in the U or D layer such that the other red-yellow edge piece 
ends up in uFR.  Now undo your first d turn and you have paired up 
the red-yellow edge group in FR as well (2 pairs at once).

-----------

To do 4 or 6 edges just extend the same idea.

For 4 edges, set up your first two edges the same way.  So the green-
white edge group will solve into the FR slot once you do the move d, 
same as the above example.  Now you still have the red-yellow piece 
in dFR that will move to dBR when you do your d move.  This time 
though find the other red-yellow edge piece and put that edge group 
into the BR edge slot, such that the other red-yellow piece ends up 
in uBR.  Now when you do your first d move the green-white AND the 
red-yellow pairs will match in in the FR and BR slots respectively.

The piece that was originally in dBR now will be moved to dBL.  Lets 
say it is the orange-white egdge piece.  So now do your first d move 
and pair up the edge groups in FR and BR.  Now find the other orange-
white edge piece and place it into the BR slot such that the orange-
white piece is in uBR.  Once that edge is in place, look at the 
piece currently in the dBR position (say it is green-red).  Now look 
for the other green red-edge in the U or D layer and place it into 
the FR slot such that the green-red piece is in uFR.  You have now 
replaced your two solved edge groups with two unsolved ones so undo 
your original d turn.  By doing this you will line up the orange-
white edge group in BR as well as the red-green edge group in FR.  
This pairs up 4 edges in one sequence.

Doing 6 is the same thing, only you will have 3 edges in line for 
the first turn, and you will have to replace three edge groups in 
the middle and 3 more pairs will pair up at the end after undoing 
your first d turn.

--------

It&#x27;s kind of hard to explain in words, and is easy to show in 
person.  I still very much want to write out my 4x4x4 solving 
strategy on my webpage, and I&#x27;ll add a section about pairing up more 
than one edge at a time like this.

I hope that made some sense, and sorry if I wrote it confusing.  THe 
basic idea is to pair up one two or three edges on your first inner 
slice turn, replace yout solved ones with unsolved ones such that 
undoing your first inner slice turn pairs up more edges.

You can also do odd number of pairings.  You can pair up 2 on your 
first turn and 3 on the undo turn.  You can even rarely get 7 pairs 
or 8 pairs at one time, thought that doesn&#x27;t happen very frequently.

Just play around with 2 at a time, then try 4 and it will start to 
make sense a little more.  I wish I had some pictures to show you to 
make this easier.  It&#x27;s sounds harder in explanation than it is in 
practice.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,<br>
<br>
I also have the cross on the left during F2L.<br>
I think I do this because turning the cube around the X axis to look <br>
for cubies is easier then turning it around the Y axis in my opinion. <br>
You don&#x27;t really lose grip of the R and U faces while turning around <br>
the X axis because the R face always stays the same (you don&#x27;t have <br>
to let loose the R face during F2L :D).<br>

          <div class="email-content">One cool thing that I see with D-Cross is the ability to do Dw moves.  (DE<br>
or D&#x27;E&#x27;, I&#x27;m not sure if I got the sign of E correct)  Because when you&#x27;re<br>
doing that algorithm, you don&#x27;t need to be looking at the slot so doing<br>
the Dw move puts the slot you&#x27;re working with in the back giving you more<br>
view of the next slots for looking ahead.<br>

          <div class="email-content">F2L is the term commonly used in the Fridrich method.  If you solve the 
cube in a minute 45, chances are that you solve the first layer, the 
middle layer, and then the last layer.  People who use the Fridrich 
method solve the first two layers simultaneously so when people refer 
to this step of the method, they just say F2L.  Here are some examples 
of F2L used in sentences:

My F2L takes 18 seconds.  My LL (last layer) takes 10 seconds.
My cube exploded during the F2L.
My F2L is bigger than your F2L.

Thanks for typing that post! I did not have time to read it yet (I am 
working now), but I am sure it will be usefull, since this is the 
first time I am really trying to find out more about 4x4x4... I know 
it&#x27;s hard to explain cubing in words, btw, I recently tried to learn 
a beginner some 3x3x3 moves on MSN, but it&#x27;s hard. I am sure I&#x27;ll 
understand most of it, though. Thanks!

          <div class="email-content">Speedcubing.com got &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube 3x3x3: While fully drunk&quot; records. <br>
I&#x27;d like to warn everyone that intends on giving this a shot that it <br>
is potentially hazardous to your cube. Especially when giving your <br>
(also drunk) friends a go at it. The cube might lock up, see, and your <br>
friends might get this crazy idea that forcing it around is perfectly <br>
okay. And if that happens, you may be getting a little more than just <br>
a pop.<br>
<br>
I just hope I can fix this... The center piece broke. And I&#x27;m not <br>
talking about the cap falling off or the screw coming loose, the <br>
center piece just snapped in half!<br>

for a few minutes, then disassembled the cube and left the pieces to <br>

the pieces stick together. I sprayed some of my friends cubes that <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi, 
Yeah I tried Gunk as well. In fact that was my first lubricant I 
tried on Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. I have a page on my site 
(http://h4m573r00.freeprohost.com/lube.html) that explains 3 
different lubes which are availible @ home depot &amp; OSH. These are 
different types of lubricants; pay no attention to the brand. (Oil 
based, Dry Film, and high proportion silicone). Try Wal- Mart&#x27;s auto 
section, you&#x27;ll find many types of lubricants there. I believe Chris 
Hardwick uses Prestone Silicone spray which is found @ Wal- Mart. I 
saw another type of dry film lubricant there, looks promising... Try 
lots of sporting goods stores and car shops, but don&#x27;t buy a can of 
lube from every store you go to... Very bad idea, it can get rather 
expensive. 

Some named lubricants proven to work really well:
Tempo (Availible @ aircraft stores, kinda steep on the price.)
Snap (OSH)
Prestone (Wal- Mart)
OSH Silicone Spray (OSH ... everybody&#x27;s going &quot;Duhh&quot; right now...)
RD-50 (This is a dry film lube, make sure your cube is very clean 
and broken in. Home Depot)

Whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy WD-40. It&#x27;s very evil. 

:) Hope that helps.

When silicone lubricant is still wet, your cube will seem a little<br>
sticky. It does not work to it&#x27;s full potential until it is completely<br>
dry, which takes quite a bit of time actually. I&#x27;ve never used this<br>
&#x27;gunk&#x27; lube before, but if it&#x27;s not at least 99% silicone, then it<br>
probably isn&#x27;t very good anyway.<br>

Ya, that was me. Heavy Duty silicone Lubricant from Castle is<br>
incredible. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months now. You have to be<br>
careful not to put too much on or your cube will turn itself ;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">When I lube my cube, I clean off all the pieces, lay them out in the sun<br>
(dries more quickly), spray them evenly, let them dry, flip over the<br>
edges, spray those edges, let them all dry, and then put them back in the<br>
cube.<br>
<br>
Before, I&#x27;d just pop out an edge piece, spray some silicone inside, and<br>
then play around with the cube.  Unfortunately, the cube, as Chris<br>
mentioned will stick and I&#x27;d have a stick cube for a few days.  Sometimes<br>
a week.  But afterwards, it turns out okay.<br>
<br>
The cube is also sticky if I don&#x27;t let the pieces dry sufficiently in the<br>
first method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Koen,

That was an awesome video.  It was very original, and it&#x27;ll make a
great addition to my collection.  The opening was impressive, and I
enjoyed the &quot;POV&quot; section with the slowed video.  Keep up the good work.

I personally use Mozilla Firefox, and I can&#x27;t use your dhtml menus
either.  I had to view your source, and saw it was pointed to
http://hosting.ambience.nl/base/ so I just went there and it let me
use the menus.  Maybe this will help some others using non-IE browsers.

<br>
I&#x27;ve re-written my standalone timer in java. This version is MUCH<br>
smaller and everything is packed into a small .jar file. It&#x27;ll run on<br>
any operating System, and is prettier to boot. The scramble generator<br>
has has also been revisited. I&#x27;m going to start work on the network<br>
version, and then completely stop development on the Visual Basic<br>
timer. Please take a few seconds to check it out:<br>

In windows, you can run the program just by double-clicking the .jar<br>

Hi Michael,

   This happens every once in a while. My method is generally headed
in the direction of O-look Last Layer.

1. two Middle Layer edges
2. four First Layer corners
3. two Middle Layer edges
4. four first layer edges
5. four Last Layer corners
6. four last Layer edges.

Step 2 can include step 5, and step 4 can include step 6.
It is hard to do and I have no idea how long it will take to make it
viable.

Regards,

David J

<br>
I&#x27;ve been using Gunk for over two years, and it&#x27;s always worked <br>
great. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it. In fact, it only takes <br>
about 10 moves to get it worked in. The way I lube a cube is to take <br>
apart the top layer and turn it upside down. Then I spray some <br>
silicone on that layer and some more on top of the middle layer. <br>
After 10-15 minutes I put it together and work it in. This method <br>
has never caused problems for any of my cubes.<br>

it was funny today some sales guy came into the bar i was in and saw 
my solved cube sitting on the counter...   he asked me &quot;how long did 
it take you to take those stickers off and put them in the right 
place&quot;... all i told him was to mix it up...    about a minute later 
he just walked out the bar shaking his head... hehehe

that&#x27;s a step in the right direction ;)

> It&#x27;ll run on any operating System
pardon for sounding too [damn] negative all the time
but this is not
true. It will run on any operating system - if there&#x27;s
a Java Virtual
Machine installed. Some licensing purists (like me)
may have a JVM
that&#x27;s missing a few features here and there --
because Sun Microsystems
are not being helpful with enabling said licensing
purists to implement
a decent (clean room) JVM.

.... in fact, the latest Sun JVMs have licensing
condition that actively
attack the possibility of clean room implementations.

I _do_ have a JVM (kaffe[.org]), however it fails to
execute the .jar

in the following, &quot;\n&quot; means newline (used to indicate
where there
_isn&#x27;t_ a newline, since the text may get wrapped)

jonas@koelker:~$ java JNetCube.jar\n

   at kaffe.jar.ExecJarName.main
(ExecJarName.java:54)\n
   at kaffe.jar.ExecJar.main (ExecJar.java:75)\n

.... also, based on what I saw when mozilla tried to
read JNetCube.jar as
plaintext:

jonas@koelker:~$ strings JNetCube.jar | grep gif
Cow.gif
Cow.gifPK
jonas@koelker:~$

you may want to have a look at http://burnallgifs.org/
depending on where you&#x27;re from, you may have broken
patent laws (haven&#x27;t
read all the exact dates of expiration pr. country).

as it is mentioned, the PNG and/or MNG formats are
both better (supports
alpha, more colors, etc), more legal (and/or less
costly), have open
documentation, are smaller (due to the use of an alg
better than LZW)...
and they are pronounced in a funny way (iirc, &#x27;ping&#x27;
and &#x27;mung&#x27;*)

* incidentially, according to The Jargon File, MUNG ~
mash until no

#ENDIF

summation:
I think re-implementing in Java was a step in the
right direction(!). I
don&#x27;t endorse Sun&#x27;s licensing schemes, but rather them
than M$. However,
from reading the &#x27;updated again&#x27; posts, I&#x27;m guessing
that whatever it
does in Java, it can do in python* as well.

*the reason I keep mentioning python is that it&#x27;s
super-portable: It
compiles** with GCC, which can target (i.e. build to)
around either 16
or 32 architechtures (can&#x27;t remember which one). And
if you happen to
use an arch which can&#x27;t be targeted by GCC, you can
always get the
source for GCC and modify it. I&#x27;m not saying that this
is done
overnight; I&#x27;m saying that if someone is passionate
about porting
python, they can and will do it. To quote ESR: &quot;every
project starts by
scratching a developer&#x27;s personal itch&quot;***.

** of course there&#x27;s prepackaged Pythons for most
Windows versions and
most Linux distros. Did I point you to the interview
with 

A lot of people seem to have an itch around timers;
mine is a 22-line
shell script (and it&#x27;s really bad) ;)

also, if I may suggest: create some small command-line
tools which can
be used seperately for their own purpose; say, one to
generate
scrambles, one to wait X seconds, one to measure how
long the user takes
to press enter, one to communicate (exchange times)
with other users;
then make an app or script that ties it all together.
In that way, if
the user don&#x27;t like it, he can re-script it without
having to hack the
source code (this is _very_ important for binary-only
distributions).

If you want to know why I suggest this: Install a
Unix, learn to write
shell scripts. Or install DJGPP and use it. Write bat
files. Hate
Windows for it&#x27;s opacity, monolithicity, and general
stinkyness.

(I&#x27;m tired, that&#x27;s why all I write sounds like crap)
&lt;/money>

You need to execute the jar as follows:<br>
<br>
java -jar JNetCube.jar<br>
<br>
by appending the &quot;\n&quot;, you have told the java virtual machine to load<br>
the &quot;\n&quot; class from the jar. Since there is no class called &quot;\n&quot; you<br>
got a class-not-found error. A .jar file is simply a zip file with<br>
manifest information. If your JVM does not support jar files, then<br>
open the .jar with a zip extraction program and extract the contents<br>
into a directory. Then execute the program with the command:<br>
<br>
java Standalone<br>
<br>
This is just a simple little program I wrote for fun. It will stay in<br>

called &quot;JNetCube.jar&quot;. Make sure you run the java command with the<br>
&quot;-jar&quot; parameter so that your JVM looks into the jar for the manifest<br>
information and loads the appropriate class.<br>

I think you misread some things in Jonas&#x27; text<br>
<br>
    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/swing/JFrame<br>
<br>
means the java Runtime cannot find the swing JFrame class, which is part of<br>
the (free) swing libraries. If you really want to write a super portable<br>
program you should try to make a version using AWT only (abstract window<br>
toolkit) which is part of every Java compatible runtime. Swing _is_ an<br>
extension. The main difference between swing and awt is that swing just<br>
looks better, but I guess Jonas&#x27; couldn&#x27;t care less about that ;-)<br>

I think that too; I did specify the -jar option in the

.... yeah :)
BUT... I&#x27;ve heard that Kaffe (which afaik is the
most/best/newest-version java-compatible
clean-room-java) doesn&#x27;t have
good AWT support either, which is why I can&#x27;t see
browser applets. I can
run ACube with no problem though.

making it DWIM by

David has a good point.  The same thing happens with my chess playing.  If
I&#x27;ve worked hard on improving knowledge in various ways I suddenly find that
my results take a dive as I take longer to figure out a position because I&#x27;m
taking account of new factors or I miss tactics because I&#x27;m concentrating on
some strategic ideas.  You come back stronger and better in the end!

Does anyone know an applet that can display 4x4 and 5x5 and that 
takes initial moves as input parameter? Like the FMC one but for 
larger cubes? I&#x27;d like to display the cubes on my 4x4/5x5 algorithms 
page with it (rather than with photos of my real cube).

Just a note of caution on lettig the pieces dry in the sun. The 
orange stickers(old and bright ones) on my cubes turned dark when 
exposed to direct sunlight making them hard to distinguish from red. 
And it only happened to the corners making matching up orange c/e 
pairs difficult because of the 2 shades. I don&#x27;t know if this has 
happened to anyone else but I never dry my pieces in the sun anymore 
nor would I recommend it.

          <div class="email-content">So, I&#x27;m right handed but I do one-handed solving with my left hand.  I 
think this is due to the fact that my left hand has more dexterity and 
flexibility due to violin playing.

My right hand can barely turn the cube one-handed.

Those are good times!  My best right hand average is around the 50 second
mark but quite a bit slower with left hand.  I think I should work on this
and also use my left hand more when solving two-handed.

Also I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ve hand other discussions on handedness if you
search back through the forum.

I recently went to Toys R Us to look for a present for my little <br>
cousin, but I always visit the puzzles section first :D. While I was <br>
walking past the &quot;Return&quot; line, I saw this kid that wanted a refund <br>
for his Oddzon 3x3 because he couldn&#x27;t solve it. So that was when I <br>
asked him whether I can solve it, and then I did in front of them, <br>
haha, and the cashier looked surprised, so she gave me a 25% off <br>
coupon for the toy that I bought for my cousin. Haha, and there was <br>

          <div class="email-content">For one-handed cubing I can&#x27;t solve right handed as fast as I can 
with my left.

Right handed I think I can still get sub-60 on average, but my times 
aren&#x27;t very near my left handed times.

I think my situation is similar to Tyson&#x27;s.  I used to play 
saxophone a lot before I discovered the cube and you use your left 
hand fingers slightly more often than your right.  Also your left 
hand has to make some of the biggest stretches and weirdest 
movements on weird or fast note changes.

Frank, if you&#x27;re pretty much equally good at both hands you may want 
to consider switching every other solve during an average.  I used 
to do that, I would do solve #1 lefty, then #2 righty etc..

My averages always went good time, bad time, good time, bad time 
though lol so I gave it up.

If you&#x27;re comfortable using either hand though it would help you to 
let each hand rest for a bit before the next solve, which is 
tremendously helpful.  You would also make sure to develop both 
hands equally well for your one-handed solving, which would probably 
keep your times equal with both hands even as you got better.

Just a thought.

&gt; And it only happened to the corners making matching up orange c/e <br>

This has happened to me twice. I fell asleep on the beach, then when I<br>

Mine does the same (at least the sound, haven&#x27;t looked for bubbles). <br>

When I disassemble the whole cube and lay the pieces on the table and <br>

          <div class="email-content">Try (L2 B) (R&#x27; D R U2) (R&#x27; D&#x27; R U2) (B&#x27; L2), is that ok?

The way I look at these things is to permute the *stickers*, not the 
pieces. After your algorithm, look at the U(RF) sticker. Where does it 
have to go? To R(UB). And that has to go to L(BU) which goes back to 
U(RF).

Put some fingers on those three stickers. What you really want is two 
fingers on the same face and the third finger on an adjacent face but 
not in the same layer (i.e. U(FR)+U(BR)+B(UL) is also bad).

Right now they&#x27;re on three different faces (U, R and L). One thing you 
can try is rotate your fingers around the corners, for example rotate 
clockwise to get your fingers on stickers R(FU), U(BR) and B(UL). 
Doesn&#x27;t help in this case, though. Rotating once more doesn&#x27;t help 
either.

So let&#x27;s use the initial three again. The L2 move brings one finger to 
L(FR) and leaves the others at U(RF) and R(UB). The B move brings one 
finger to U(LB). At this point we have two fingers on the U face and 
one finger on the L face in the D layer. This is good, it&#x27;s what I 
said is what you really want. Now comes the commutator.

Does that make sense?

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes indeed that&#x27;s the &quot;problematic&quot; 3-cycle i showed u (and others).
My way to achieve this 3-cycle :

F&#x27;LU2 - L&#x27;FLF&#x27; - U2FL&#x27; (10 - HTM)

I needed this one for my fewest moves solution in the final ...

          <div class="email-content">The identity of the cube becomes a product of our own
perception.  Notice that by definition many views of
the cube (in definition) can be degrading or
complimenting to people who solve the cube.  For
example:

toy (noun)-
1. An object for children to play with. 
2. Something of little importance; a trifle
3. A thing for amusement, but of no real value; an
article of trade of little value; a trifle.
4. Amorous dalliance; play; sport; pastime

Notice that one can view the cube as &#x27;an object for
children to play with&#x27;.  We are still able to use the
word toy in the correct context, AND be a little more
flattering to adults that cube. (i.e.  &#x27;play; sport;
pastime.)  

Let us consider other views of the cube.  For those
out there who are anti-cubing (there tend to be people
that go out of their way to hate what we do), they
enjoy telling us that the cube is a toy, not a
lifestyle.  Well, it is entirely possible for the cube
to be both things.  *As I will prove through
definition.

lifestyle (noun)- 
1. A way of life or style of living that reflects the
attitudes and values of a person or group.

^Cubing certainly reflects the attitudes and values of
a person or group.  (i.e. dedication, persuit of
knowledge, etc.)

There are plenty of other things that I have heard my
cube referenced as.

Obsession (noun)-
1. Compulsive preoccupation with an idea or an
unwanted feeling or emotion, often accompanied by
symptoms of anxiety. 

^Wow...I do feel sometimes like I fit the definition,
however, I would not call my relationship with the
cube a &#x27;compulsive preoccupation&#x27;.

Hobby (noun)-
1. An activity or interest pursued outside one&#x27;s
regular occupation and engaged in primarily for
pleasure.

^I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but this definition
covers it for me.  But just to be fair, here&#x27;s another
simliar (and more simple) definition:

2. An auxiliary activity.  

In conclusion, the cube will only become what we see
it as.  Hindsight will always be 20/20, and the world
may always see the cube as a childs toy.

          <div class="email-content">Also, with that same setup you can also use another commutator (an <br>
&quot;inverse-like&quot; one) that is shorter in half-turn metric:<br>
<br>
B&#x27; D - (B2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R) (B2 R&#x27; F R) - D&#x27; B<br>
<br>
Another thing I realized in the meantime: Remember I said you want to <br>
have two fingers on one face? An easy way to find it is if one piece <br>
already has one sticker on the correct face. Example:<br>
<br>
Scramble: (U R&#x27; D R) (U&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R)<br>
<br>
You can see that the sticker at U(LF) is a U-sticker. So when you put <br>
your first finger on that sticker then the second finger will go on <br>
U(BR), the same face. And the commutator is now easy (but if you don&#x27;t <br>
see it, the scramble is its inverse).<br>
<br>
I noticed that I&#x27;m using this when I fixed my 5x5 today (I had screwed <br>
a PLL alg and was left with three unsolved corners. A while ago (even <br>
before I started solving the 5x5 as a 3x3) I might have given up but <br>
now it just took me another 15 seconds to &quot;invent&quot; and execute a <br>
simple 3-cycle).<br>

is hold the cube and help the right hand with some cube movements and 
rotations, all the finger tricking is with my right hand.

That is because my left hand is extensively slower and less agile 
than my right hand, I notice it even when I play piano (14 years 
now), but that is mostly because most studies are for the right hand 
and the left hand isn&#x27;t as trained. But since my right hand is well 
trained (if I could cube as fast as I could press piano notes without 
mistake, I would be going at an insane speed, something that people 
could only do using a trigger and extensive hand movement.

Notice that no triggers are &quot;pure finger&quot;, it is a lot of wrist work 
also.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan !!

No, i didn&#x27;t invent it there. I have known all U corner 3-cycles for 
like 20 yrs. But this particular one is my invention. I have later 
seen it also on the web, but cannot recall where. Maybe it&#x27;s part of 
the Helmstetter last layer alg collection? Not sure.

Looking at the algorithm i can see that it&#x27;s based on 2 commutators. 
There is the outer one : F&#x27;L-FL&#x27; Now at the dash there seems to be a 
setup move : U2 and then another commutator : L&#x27;F-LF&#x27;. So at the dash 
of the first commutator u apply the setup move and then another 
commutator. Undo the setup move and complete first commutator and u 
have it. 

All this doesn&#x27;t explain why it works of course. If i recall 
correctly i just stumbled upon this one while searching for something 
else. It must have been while i was completing all cases of corner 
twists and edge 3-cycle for last layer.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Well done Macky!

I can see how those times are possible, but im far from being able 
to do those timesmself. It&#x27;s hard to change method when u have used 
the same for 23 yrs ;-) If u really learn all of ZB for WC 2005 then 
im really excited whether u can stand up against Lars who did an 
awesome competition average in Amsterdam. But so did u at US 
nationals. I wonder how u would do at 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 if u focused 
on it solely ;-)

Keep spinning it Macky. Congratz !! :-)

  Since school is about to start back up, I wanted to get a new cube <br>
for my backpack.  I have placed one in my car, one in my girlfriend&#x27;s <br>
car, one on my desk (the studio cube), and one in the living room so <br>
a cube is never far away.  I didn&#x27;t want to take the studio cube <br>
because I keep it pretty loose and I didn&#x27;t want it popping all over <br>
the place.<br>
  I heard the new rubik&#x27;s molds are better than before (arched <br>
centers) so I went to wal-mart to pick one up.  Man this cube turns <br>
more smoothly out of the package than my other speedcubes did after <br>
about 6 months of use with silicone spray!  After lubing it it just <br>
flies!  It rivals my studio cube for smoothness, and I&#x27;ve had it for <br>
less than 24 hours.<br>
  The serial number on the bottom of the package was 40851, so if you <br>
can get any from this batch, it might be worth your $9.00.  Thought <br>

What really gets me are those small books which cost $100 and up.  There&#x27;s<br>
this one quantum mechanics book with a living cat on the front and a dead<br>

like to think it is) and that book is maybe 50 cents per page or<br>
something.<br>
<br>
Anyway, onto the cube stuff, what type of packaging was the cube in?  Was<br>
it Hasbro, Oddzon, or Winning Moves?  As far as I know, all the Winning<br>
Moves cubes now have arched center.<br>
<br>
And onto another question.  Are arched centers really any better?  They<br>
seem to make the cube jam more.  Perhaps my arched center cube just needs<br>
to be worn in.<br>

  You know, if Shrodinger had a dog, we wouldn&#x27;t be in this mess...  
I&#x27;ll have to calculate the cost/page when I open the books. 
Ridiculous. Not one semester have I spent less than $350 on books 
alone!

The cube was packaged in one of those clear plastic casings that take 
a blow torch and a machette to get into.  In the lower right corner 
of one side it says milton bradley, and in the upper left of the same 
side it says www.rubiks.com.  On the bottom it does have the Hasbro 
symbol, to answer your question more directly :)

Since this is my only arched-centers cube, I can&#x27;t comment in 
general.  But if most of them come out of the package even half as

more up from that batch (you know, just to have around..explain that

It&#x27;d be more interesting to calculate the cost per page that you&#x27;ve
actually read.

So it was in the red packaging I&#x27;ll guess?  Those cubes have varying
qualities of course.  I find them turning better than the cubes from
Winning Moves immediately after lubing.  Of course, this is when the cube
has not been broken in.

I think that cubes all start in different places but the end result is
relatively the same.

Does anyone have a State Resell Certificate?

          <div class="email-content">I currently have four speed cubes.  The first one was an Oddzon Cube in
the green packaging.  It&#x27;s all right.  It turns pretty smoothly but it
will pop due to the fact that it&#x27;s been worn in a lot.  The second and
third cube I have are from Winning Moves.  I think if you buy a cube from
www.rubiks.com, you get a cube from Winning Moves.  Both cubes were
amazing straight out from the box.  I speedcube almost exclusively with
the second cube now.  The third cube would probably be very good if it
cleaned and prepared it.

The fourth cube was an interesting one.  It was an Oddzon cube with arched
centers.  Originally, I was intending on selling it to my students but
after I lubed it, I decided it was way too good to give up.

It jams and gets stuck pretty often but hey, it&#x27;s basically a brand new
cube.  I think unfortunately, the lube will make it harder to break in.
I&#x27;ll probably take out the lube some time so it&#x27;ll wear in a bit more
effectively.

I wonder why they don&#x27;t put the good stickers on the cubes?  Oh wait.
It&#x27;s so you have to buy stickers!  I think a cube with different colored
plastics would be awesome.  Not tiles that stick out... but maybe plastic
plates which are at the same level of the cube.  That would be cool.

          <div class="email-content">I just got one the other night from Meijers, it was of serial number 
41101. I think the first two digits give an idication of &quot;model&quot; 
maybe they make a new model once or twice a year or soemthing. The 
last 3 digits are probably giving the manufacturing place/plant, but 
may also be some sort of control number, something to date it...

Mine does have the arched centers. I haven&#x27;t used it much though. 
I&#x27;ve aquired about 30 cubes in my years (using the term cube 
loosely), and do appreciate the efforts the toy companies are making 
in improving the quality of Rubik&#x27;s cubes.

This latest cube was purchesed as a going-away present for one of my 
roommates, it&#x27;s a classic thing I do know for all the friends I know 
I may never see again. Hopefully it reminds them about my cube 
craziness, gains some sort of colleague respect for displaying it in 
their office, or even get them interested in speedcubing for 
themselves.

          <div class="email-content">The colored plastic would be cool, but one good thing about tiles is that
they do stick out.  I didn&#x27;t think people were serious when they said that
it could help with recognition, that you can see the other sides, but it
actually does.  After using a tiled cube, I switched back to a stickered one
for a couple solves, and actually did realize that I couldn&#x27;t recognize some
positions as easily.  Now if they could make colored plastic, that looks
like tiles, but is part of the cube, that would be awesome.  I think you
should be able to order custom cubes online.  Something along the lines of
how you can put together custom shoes on nike.com.  This way you could
choose stickers, tiles, plastic (if only), and your color scheme, center
type (arched/not arched), screws or rivets, etc.     That would be awesome.

          <div class="email-content">I think people could easily increase the number of speedcubers. 
Demonstrating to the public would easily increase interest. Also, if 
the cube was too popular, people wouldn&#x27;t be too amazed to see us 
solve it. Also, the Rubik&#x27;s cube is different from scrabble in that 
people can win in Scrabble, but can&#x27;t win (solve) the cube as easily.

quite a bit of stock to  go through as the site wasn&#x27;t really functioning at
the beginning of the year. The Winning Moves ones should be in most of the
stores, especially in bigger towns and cities and there are some clues to
look out for; namely that the logo is much brighter print due to the new
stickers and there will be a stand included. later in the year  (in time for
Christmas) will be a 25th Anniversary cube for 2005  with special logo (for
next year only) and different packaging (silver, hexagonal) All of these
will be to the new higher standard.
The cube kit on rubiks.com is the new design, you don&#x27;t have to use the
rivets on this and can put in screws instead.
Hope that helps.

wal-mart!


I currently have four speed cubes.  The first one was an Oddzon Cube in
the green packaging.  It&#x27;s all right.  It turns pretty smoothly but it
will pop due to the fact that it&#x27;s been worn in a lot.  The second and
third cube I have are from Winning Moves.  I think if you buy a cube from
www.rubiks.com, you get a cube from Winning Moves.  Both cubes were
amazing straight out from the box.  I speedcube almost exclusively with
the second cube now.  The third cube would probably be very good if it
cleaned and prepared it.

The fourth cube was an interesting one.  It was an Oddzon cube with arched
centers.  Originally, I was intending on selling it to my students but
after I lubed it, I decided it was way too good to give up.

It jams and gets stuck pretty often but hey, it&#x27;s basically a brand new
cube.  I think unfortunately, the lube will make it harder to break in.
I&#x27;ll probably take out the lube some time so it&#x27;ll wear in a bit more
effectively.

I wonder why they don&#x27;t put the good stickers on the cubes?  Oh wait.
It&#x27;s so you have to buy stickers!  I think a cube with different colored
plastics would be awesome.  Not tiles that stick out... but maybe plastic
plates which are at the same level of the cube.  That would be cool.

A good reason to learn to use your left hand equally as your right, <br>
is so that, if you are working on something that has a lot of cases <br>
to learn..like orientations or something, you can just learn the <br>
mirrors, instead of learning all the different cases, and it allows <br>
you to be more flexible and have more options while solving the <br>
cube.  ... That having been said, I use mostly my right hand, with my <br>
left hand for triggers and cube rotations.<br>
<br>
Good Luck<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey,  I tried that already,  and it pretty much doesn&#x27;t work.
The heirarchy stays constant throughout the entire animation,

OOh, Idea ...  Make 2 cubes, perform a move on one,  Switch them out
in 1 frame, do the next move on the second while changing color
sliders and orientation (because you can only really move 2 sides) in
preparation for the next swapout.  That would take a while

the way the cube moves (switching parents and centers of rotation
constantly) has been a problem for me in all of my attempts to animate
a cube.

What I did with it was align all the pivot points at the center of the
cube, and then just rotated them, setting a keyframe after every turn. 
Oh,  and don&#x27;t forget to turn off the smooth transitions,  otherwise
it looks like the cube prepares for each move, and then overshoots
again before it returns to the correct place.

I hope this helps.
and Have fun with Max ;)

          <div class="email-content">It would be even better if the black plastic was colored instead. 
This way, there would be no black and and you could even tell the 
color of the indside of the cubie. I&#x27;m no plastics expert, but to do 
this, I think you would have to mold the corners in 3 different 
sections for the different colors then fuse them together. This 
would make the quality worse and the cost higher but it would still 
be cool to have a cube without any black or other background color. 
I see where it could help with recognition too.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know with the others, but I cut my stickers one millimeter too 
big once, and the result was an ugly looking cube. Trust me, having no

good. You need black there (I guess black is the most neutral color?). 
It helps.

          <em>From:</em> cmhardw &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree, especially with the part about learning mirror cases.

A while back I learned the 2 generator 3 edge cycle, which goes very 
fast:

R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U R2

Anyway this only cycles the pieces one way, so you have to learn 
either the mirror or the inverse to cycle the other direction.  I 
had heard a lot of people say that the inverse for this move is 
ALMOST as fast as the move itself.  So instead of learning the 
inverse I decided to learn the mirror in order to be able to cycle 
the other direction quickly.  With practice my left hand (off hand) 
even caught up to the speed of my right.

There are other triggers for mirror moves though that I&#x27;ve practiced 
for a long time, and am still practicing, but my left hand just 
can&#x27;t catch up to my right.

For me personally the &quot;power&quot; triggers, the ones where I have to 
literally hit the faces to turn them and not just push or pull with 
a finger, I can do much better right handed than left.  The ones 
where I just do a long string of tricks that either push or pull  
faces in the (R,U,L) group I can always seem to work my left hand to 
be just as fast as my right hand.

Does anyone else have this sort of division?  Certain types of 
triggers are faster for you on one hand than for the other hand?

Chris

I was thinking the same thing! And besides i believe the color-
recognition will be much worse than for plastic tiles. Fused plastic 
tiles would be really cool. But of coz for &quot;show-off&quot; metal tiles 
would be really cool, though not so useful for speedcubing.

          <div class="email-content">The aluminum shouldn&#x27;t be hard to get.  I&#x27;m not sure what chemicals are
needed to anodize the metal to different colors.  There&#x27;s nothing that a
9-volt battery can&#x27;t do.

And just as a piece of trivia, a 625,000 volt self-defense taser costs
about $60 and runs on a 9-volt battery.  What fun.

People, including myself, are now hesitant to buy StackMats because we<br>
fear that they&#x27;ll become obsolete when the new timer comes out.<br>

And with the new timer, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll have to revise the rules a bit for<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   Can you do 7 moves faster than 11?

   For your  R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U R2 turn the cube around and
try: F2 U r U2 r&#x27; U F2 and F2 U&#x27; r U2 r&#x27; U&#x27; F2 to go the other way. 

   (Remember I use single small case letter to mean *only* the slice.)

   You might like a related alg: B R2 B2 R F2 R&#x27; B2 R F2 R B&#x27; which I
consider an extension of R2 B2 R F2 R&#x27; B2 R F2 R.

          <div class="email-content">Hey David,

I used to use that move for about 4 years, but then I learned the 2 
generator one.

I can do the 9 move R2 (d&#x27; r) R&#x27; U2 r&#x27; l U&#x27; y&#x27; R2 in about 2-2.5 
seconds on average.  The lowercase letters represent turning the 
double layer (so r means R and the middle layer the same direction).

also x,y,z are the normal cube rotations.  The alg in plain notation 
is just R2 U&#x27; F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U&#x27; R2 for those wondering about the weird 
notation above.

Although it is more moves, I can do the 2-generator 3 cycle (and the 
mirror) right at 2 seconds on average, with times under 2 seconds 
fairly often.

It&#x27;s only a difference of about 0.5 second, but that&#x27;s 0.5 second 
less it took me to solve the cube if I run into that case ;-)

I think Ron said he has done the 2-generator alg in less than a 
second before.  I can&#x27;t get it that fast, but it is faster than the 
9 move 3 cycle for me.

David, I have tried using the 9 move three cycle with slice moves 
(so only 7 turns like you said), but I was never able to get very 
fast with it using slices.  The notation above with finger tricks 
and cube rotations is the fastest I was ever able to get that move.  
You can see me perform it (or maybe the inverse) on my speedcubing 
video on my site, it&#x27;s the PLL I ran into.

Chris

yes we need to change the rules so that it becomes possible to carry 
on with a solve if u realise u didn&#x27;t fully complete the 
cube/puzzle. If u stop the stacktimer when solving a 5x5x5 cube and 
then u spot u need to &quot;swap&quot; 2 centers (possible case for my method) 
then u can&#x27;t pick up the cube, finish it and get a valid time. If 
the stacktimer was set to taking lap-time then it would be possible. 
And since i suppose they will never fix this for the stacktimer it 
could be fixed for a new timer.

Happy cubing!

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

I already sent this suggestion to Speedstacks.com.
But I am still not convinced about it. I think there would be a major chance
of someone stopping the timer, shortly not touching the timer and then
touching it again. Which would give him the second time and not the original
time. Yeah, of course you can find a way to prevent this, but there are no
second chances in other sports too. One other thing is that we would still
have discussions about the last move not completely finished (like 30
degrees). Would you have to pick up the cube again to do the last move? Will
we be sure that we see the second time and not the first time?

We have to remember that we have been strict for two tournaments now.
Competitors have to get used to it. Within two years most competitors will
not put down a unsolved cube anymore.

Stackmats rule!! I especially like them because you have to stop the timer
without touching the cube. Any other mechanism would enable cheating (f.i.
moving when the timer has already stopped).

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Whereas the StackMat timers right now don&#x27;t allow you to continue with the
time, even if they did, I don&#x27;t really agree.  I feel that it is the
solver&#x27;s responsibility to determine when the puzzle is solved.  Changing
the rule and allow this, because things occur in your method, would be
giving an advantage to you.

Furthermore, it would allow people to start taking risks in the first
round where only the best time counts.  Competitors could take a guess at
what their last situation is.  People should be measured on the amount of
time it takes them to solve a cube.  Not the amount of time it takes them
to come close... even if with a certain probability, coming close is
sometimes correct.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Ron,

This leads to another question.  Should we adopt the new timer that is
currently being developed?  I personally think that having to stop the
timer without touching the cube is a clear way to make sure the competitor
isn&#x27;t making any more moves after the time is stopped or even as the time
is stopped.

If we have an optical sensor, people will be able to make their last move
while stopping the timer by placing the cube on the sensor and using it to
push down.  The timer would not be recording when the cube is placed down
solved but a little bit of time before the cube is solved.

What do people think about adopting the StackMat as the official timer?
Speedstacks already mass produces it.  We&#x27;re sure that they will be mass
producing it.  Also, they have been loaning me StackMats and displays for
free.

With the new timer, we have no idea whether or not it will be built, and
when it is, the accuracy of the measurements is already in question.

- It can&#x27;t calculate averages. Chris Hunts java timer is NOT 
&quot;excactly&quot; what I want. What I want is a thing that lets me solve X 
cubes and pops up an average in the end, without me having to do the 
hustle of entering numbers left and right.

- It doesn&#x27;t scramble. For home use, of course.

- It&#x27;s too big. We don&#x27;t need that much area.

- The distance from hands to cube isn&#x27;t standardized.

- It says &quot;stackmat&quot;. Please, I want a &quot;cubemat&quot; =D.

          <div class="email-content">I think it would be cool if they would make a special addition so to speak
for cubers.  It would be smaller, and maybe have a picture of cubes instead
of cups.  I could actually see this happening because it isn&#x27;t a very
drastic change.  Maybe you should run that idea by them?

Subject: [Speed cubing group] StackMats

 

The StackMat has been a reliable timer so far in all the tournaments that
have used them.  I believe that if we and the WCA adopt the StackMat as
our official timer, StackMat would be happy to &quot;sponsor&quot; us.

Two ideas for the Stackmat are as follows.  The StackMat really isn&#x27;t
designed for cubers.  Strangely, it has worked brilliantly for our sport.
First, it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to put a WCA logo on the timer.  Second, I
think it also wouldn&#x27;t be too costly or require much more machinery to put
in a tough black plastic that doesn&#x27;t dent.  Cup stackers don&#x27;t have the
problem of the corners of their cup digging into the timer and causing
dents.

Some people feel that they would like the timer to have a scramble
generator and an average calculator?  Such a modification to the existing
machinery that manufactures the timer is not yet available.  If we support
StackMat, we would have a higher chance of them being able to invest money
into our cause.  If you really want a scramble generator and an average
calculator, Chris Hunt&#x27;s Java timer allows you to add times which gives
you exactly what you want.  Even better is you can display the average and
copy and paste however you want.

I have to write a thank you e-mail to StackMat for their support in
supplying eight StackMats and tournament displays.  I&#x27;ll run some ideas by
them to see what they think.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect any drastic changes now
because our community is still growing.  When there is a more continuous
demand for Rubik&#x27;s Cube timers, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be able to adjust and
help us.

          <div class="email-content">For tournament use, there is no need to calculate averages.  The
tournament organizers are responsible for that.  As for generating
scrambles, the tournament organizers are also repsonsible for that.

As for being too large, it may be slightly too large but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s
not hard to fix at all.  How do the Rubik&#x27;s Master Magic people feel about
the size of the StackMat?  Hey, if you feel your StackMat is too big, Mr.
Scissors can help.

The distance from the hands to the cube isn&#x27;t standardized because we
don&#x27;t have a standard distance for tournament use.  The competitor may not
be in physical contact with the cube before he starts the timer.  That&#x27;s
the only rule right now.

As for the last complaint, it is purely artistic and can be trivially
fixed.

As for home use, if you want a program the calculates averages, e-mail me,
tell me exactly what you want it to do, and I&#x27;ll program it.  As for
generating scrambles, this question is a lot more involved than just
simply putting a scramble generator on a timer.  For now, we have to
settle for a computer scramble generator.  I think putting a 25 digit LCD
display on a timer would significantly increase the cost.

The StackMat isn&#x27;t perfect.  A perfect timer would have a cube logo and
would probably have your name on it as well.  However, I do believe that
the StackMat satisfies the principles that are very well suited to
speedcubing.

A timer that we need basically has to follow two main things.  It is
started when one hand is lifted up and stopped when both hands are placed
down.  The second item is that the timer is under 60 USD.  Otherwise, I
think it would be hard to justify another timer.

          <div class="email-content">I think Ron has already run the idea by them.  I&#x27;ll run it by them again
if necessary.  In any case, the changes that we would like isn&#x27;t anything
major and if they receive enough sales from Rubik&#x27;s Cube people, then I
think it would be in StackMat&#x27;s best interest to spend a tiny bit of
money, make a smaller pad, and put a cube logo on the timer.

Integrating a scramble generator onto the StackMat however would require
the cost of a larger LCD screen.  The StackMat already costs $60 which is
pretty steep for an elaborate stopwatch.

          <div class="email-content">About scrambling algs and averages... That requires a whole different <br>
kind of display/chipset as you guys also pointed out. One thing that <br>
wouldn&#x27;t be this expensive is to somehow connect the mat to a <br>
computer (using the port that is used for tournament displays?). The <br>
computer would have software installed which gives you the scrambles, <br>
and can also pick up the times from the stackmat. Of course the <br>
functionality of the software can be as elaborate as you can imagine, <br>
especially if it would be open-source (given the fact that the cube-<br>
community has so many coders :P). I know it would be less cool then <br>
having all this functionality built-in in the actual timer, but it&#x27;s <br>
a cheaper solution which would give a whole new dimension to coding <br>
cube-programs as well.<br>
<br>
I have no clue though if it&#x27;s possible to make a cable that enables <br>
the mat to communicate with the serial port (I guess?).<br>

          <div class="email-content">YAY! I finally got my Stackmat today about 3 hours ago :D. I highly <br>
doubt that the new timer that is still being designed will be THAT <br>
much better than a speedstack. Plus, even if they could have a <br>
screen that gives you scrambles and averages, it&#x27;ll probably be ALOT <br>
more expensive. <br>

          <div class="email-content">You guys are starting to win me over about the stackmat thing. Maybe 
they are the best timers for speedcubing. It would be awesome if 
they made a cubing version just something smaller, different logo, 
etc. and like koen said, it would be nice if it could connect with a 
computer and work with current timers or new programs designed for 
it. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;d want. I personally wouldn&#x27;t want a scramble 
generator on the timer. I think I might buy a stackmat now.

is horrible. This is the oackaging and a pic of the cube: 
http://mars.walagata.com/w/elite185/WallmartCubegood.jpg
On the bottom it has the numbers inprinted (not in ink, but the 
numbers were pushed into the packaging) 31091. As you can see from 
the piucture, the centers arn&#x27;t arched. 
I think i got a cube from a different batch. If you are looking for a 
cube, get a number in the 40&#x27;s. I think ill go and get another one 
soon.

          <div class="email-content">I was in the drive through of Braums getting some grub with my <br>
girlfriend. A snazzy looking Green VW bus from the 70&#x27;s pulls up <br>
behind me.  Since I was getting a drink I had to dump out the rest of <br>
what was in an old doctor pepper can out on the ground to clear room <br>
in my cup holder.  So when I opened my door I hear &quot;Hey!&quot; So I look <br>
around and it&#x27;s the guy in the bus:<br>
Me: Yeah?<br>
Him:  How fast can you solve a Rubik&#x27;s cube?<br>
Me:  About 25s on average.<br>
Him: No sh*t?!  That&#x27;s awesome, how do you do it?<br>
<br>
So I proceeded to tell him about breaking it down into steps in the <br>
few short minutes we had before the guy in front of me got his food <br>
and pulled up.  I referred him to www.rubiks.dk (for the vids) and <br>
told him to google speed cubing.  It was awesome!<br>
<br>
How&#x27;d he know to ask?  My license plate that I&#x27;ve had for just under <br>
a year says &quot;SPD QBR,&quot; and I have the logo from this yahoo group in <br>
one corner of the back windshield of my car, as well as a Rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube sticker.  This is the first time any one has ever asked a <br>
pertinent question about the tag, other than &quot;What does your tag say?&quot;<br>
<br>
I was excited, thought I&#x27;d share :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">In regards to this rule:

A cube that is set down unfinished, by only one turn,
will give the competitor a penalty of 2 seconds.  I
believe this is too forgiving, and unsolved cubes
shouldn&#x27;t be awarded times at all.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Although it is more moves, I can do the 2-generator 3 cycle (and the <br>
&gt; mirror) right at 2 seconds on average, with times under 2 seconds <br>
&gt; fairly often.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I&#x27;m faster with the mirror. I just timed myself on the stackmat a <br>
few times doing each alg six times and best time for your alg was 12.<br>
84 and best for its mirror was 10.77. I do think though that I have <br>
longer breaks between two applications of your alg than for its <br>
mirror. Gotta take a video to study it better...<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Looking at the algorithm i can see that it&#x27;s based on 2 commutators. <br>
&gt; There is the outer one : F&#x27;L-FL&#x27; Now at the dash there seems to be a <br>
&gt; setup move : U2 and then another commutator : L&#x27;F-LF&#x27;. So at the <br>
dash <br>
&gt; of the first commutator u apply the setup move and then another <br>
&gt; commutator. Undo the setup move and complete first commutator and u <br>
&gt; have it. <br>
<br>
That does make sense to me (somehow ;-). But I&#x27;ve also found a <br>
different way to look at it. Look what the first half (i.e. L F&#x27; U2 F <br>
L&#x27;) does to the cube:<br>
<br>
1) Swaps corners at DLB and DFR (easy to see why).<br>
2) Swaps edges (BL,RF) with edges (UR,UB) (also easy to see why).<br>
3) Swaps corners UBR and UFR with certain orientation.<br>
<br>
The third effect is the key. And the F&#x27; is the essential move because <br>
it brings the once &quot;adjacent&quot; corners to &quot;opposite&quot; places. And the <br>
first two effects are very symmetric if you look at the cube from the <br>
UFL direction.<br>
<br>
The second part (i.e. F&#x27; L U2 L&#x27; F) is also symmetric that way and <br>
just undoes the first two effects of the first half and adds another <br>
two-corner swap with certain orientation.<br>
<br>
So let&#x27;s look at the cube after scrambling it with (L F&#x27; U2 F L&#x27;) (F&#x27; <br>
L U2 L&#x27; F). Look at the middle one of the three unsolved corners. It <br>
needs to go to ULB. Let&#x27;s think in terms of stickers. The sticker at <br>
U(BR) needs to go to B(UL). So we bring the sticker currently at B(UL) <br>
to U(FL) using the moves F&#x27; L. Now let&#x27;s swap them using a U2 move. <br>
Undo the setup, i.e. do L&#x27; F. Now the sticker at U(BR) needs to go to <br>
R(FU) so we bring that sticker to U(FL) using L F&#x27;. The U2 swaps the <br>
two corners. And F L&#x27; undoes the setup. Done.<br>
<br>
This really helps me because I now understand it and I can do it <br>
without *knowing* the algorithm. I can see what needs to be done and <br>
do it.<br>
<br>
Nice alg ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Ron... stackmats rule!!! And I don&#x27;t just say that <br>
because I&#x27;ve already paid for mine ;-)<br>
<br>
I like it a lot and doubt I&#x27;d like that new timer (if it ever gets <br>
built) any better than the stackmat. Maybe it could have better <br>
features (e.g. connection to PC) but the timing itself I like a lot on <br>
the stackmat, better than some touchpad.<br>
<br>
I also agree with Tyson that a mistake like Per described is the <br>
solvers fault, not a solved puzzle and thus a DNF. Just make sure that <br>
 tournaments don&#x27;t have raw averages like the Rubik&#x27;s Clock in <br>
Amsterdam where 3 of 4 finalists were disqualified because of a single <br>
mistake.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Problem is you have to define a limit. If I understand you correctly 
you want to set that limit to 0 degrees turning? A perfectly aligned 
cube? That&#x27;d be a brutal rule. I know someone in Amsterdam had the 
cube finished in his hands but when he put it down on the mat (fast of 
course) it accidentally hit the ground with a corner which caused a 
quarter turn. I think adding two seconds is enough punishment. And 
with a 0-degree rule everybody should better put down the cube softly 
and lose time (again, because you lose time picking it up already).

          <div class="email-content">Do you mean the black one? There&#x27;s nothing that makes me think I can 
assemble it myself.

The instructions at the bottom only speak about stickers and lubing. 
The &quot;DIY instructions&quot; link image is a broken link. So if that&#x27;s the 
cube and it comes unassembled so we can assemble it ourselves (btw, is 
it easy to find fitting screws?) then I have to say it&#x27;s very poorly 
advertised...

          <div class="email-content">This is not cubing related at all really, but I had to have a <br>
dependable group for feedback.  For some sleep seems to be a luxury, <br>
but I find it to be a curse entirely.  What a waste to sleep away 1/3 <br>
of our lives.  This summer I have been trying desperately to cut down <br>
on the amount of sleep.  I think I am working quite well on 4 hours <br>
most of the time.  ( A couple 2 hour naps a day)  This is still <br>
somewhat of a strain on the body, but I manage alright, and I don&#x27;t <br>
neccesarily feel like I&#x27;m dragging.  Ideally I would like to get my <br>
avg amount of sleep per day to around 3 hours.  I think this can be <br>
possible.  I mentioned this to Jonas Koelker at one point, and he <br>
gave me link to a professor&#x27;s view on this.  That through the use of <br>
powerful REM cycles we can drastically cut down on the amount we <br>
sleep during the day.  Anyone have any views on this?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Okay, here&#x27;s the logic as I see it behind the 2 second penalty.  We all <br>
want to see a perfectly solved cube.  Fine, that&#x27;s understandable.  <br>
That&#x27;s what we should all strive for.  But let&#x27;s say the cube is <br>
misaligned by 1 degree.  Is it okay?  Pretty much yes.  We&#x27;re human.  <br>
We can&#x27;t be perfect.  How about another degree?  Okay, fine, we&#x27;ll <br>
allow it.<br>
<br>
How about a limit... such as x degrees.  Okay fine, we still allow it.  <br>
And what if it&#x27;s past x?  It&#x27;s at a boundary where if it were a <br>
fraction of a degree closer, we would have declared it solved.  It <br>
doesn&#x27;t seem like the progression should be from solved to absolutely <br>
nothing.<br>
<br>
Then of course, there&#x27;s the argument on, well, fine, then why isn&#x27;t the <br>
penalty proportional to how much you&#x27;re off?  That&#x27;s just a <br>
practicality matter.  There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to sit there with a <br>
protractor and magnifying glass studying your cube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That still doesn&#x27;t address the matter of allowing an
entire 90 degrees...If someone is running a marathon
and they don&#x27;t finish, there is no penalty for
them...they just DNF.  I agree there should be a
reasonable margin of error allowed.  You are timed for
solving the cube, and if you set down your cube an
entire turn off that&#x27;s just not right.
