man, that&#x27;s a good picture.  you need to keep that one. i haven&#x27;t 
laughed so hard in quite a while.
also, i was amazed that it generated more responses on the board here 
than just about anything else.
i am reminded of when my first child was born, the first thing i said 
to him was, &quot;never take the knight-pawn with your queen when you are 
behind in development&quot;
i guess i am a geek at heart...

Yours is the  first message of the New Year. May I be the second?

Several people, including myself, replied to this message. I replied 
from outside the group, and my reply didn&#x27;t get in. No matter, some 
of the responses were pretty identical. What I did not see is 
identiication of those rows as 11^n, for n=1 to n=5, and obsevation 
that the little girl was poised complete the triangle for n=0.
Some people continued this triangle for n=6, 7, and 8. I verified 
thrir calculation.

Are physicists considered geeks? :-)

well the whole thing fell apart along with the corner and took me <br>
about an hour to put back together and i figured since it was apart <br>
why not lube it... well i got it back together and lubed and it <br>
doesn&#x27;t seem so fragile anymore... yay maybe i got a new catagory i <br>

Hmm ... not sure how many takers you will get for your new category 
&quot;peedsolving&quot; but I wish you lots of luck!  ;-)

Happy New Year everyone!

So far, I find that when I peedsolve, my times don&#x27;t suffer at all.<br>
Sometimes I get better times by peedsolving because I&#x27;m so much more relaxed<br>
and not in such a rush (F2L mainly).  Still, I&#x27;ve not really been &quot;fully<br>
wasted&quot; while peedsolving, as in the unofficial category on speedsolving.com<br>
and I don&#x27;t think I could match up to Chris and others.<br>

          <div class="email-content">First, Happy New Year!<br>
<br>
Now, on to the cube... I use a &quot;lite version&quot; of Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s <br>
method for the 3x3x3 (haven&#x27;t got all the OLL algs down yet).  <br>
However, I found that for the 2x2x2, my typical approach took too <br>
long.  Basically, I&#x27;d do the first layer, orient the corners (1 of 7 <br>
cases), and then permute the corners (1 of 2 cases).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve come up with a new method for the 2x2x2 that addresses it more <br>
like one would for a corners first approach of the 3x3x3 - taking <br>
advantage of shorter sequences that would otherwise impact edge <br>
pieces.  If I figured it out right, this new method takes a maximum <br>
(provided I don&#x27;t mess up) of 27 moves (half turns counted as one <br>
move).  I&#x27;m not sure what the average move count would be, but at <br>
least a little better than that.  Also, I only have 12 algs (3 more <br>
than my old way), and they are all 7 moves or less, except for 2.<br>
<br>
My question is this - for those who have an approach to the 2x2x2 or <br>
use corners first on the 3x3x3, how does this compare to your <br>
method?  Is a maximum of 27 moves good, or is that typical to <br>
mediocre?<br>

well the way i change my file from .avi to .mpg is from a file i got 
off the net... i found it by typing  .avi to .mpg in a search 
engine... try looking for something that converts to .mpg or smaller 
and if someone knows anything that is smaller than .mpg please let me 
know cuz i still feel my files are too big...

but of course if i had better timest they would be a lot smaller 
too  :)

You should take a look at this:

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube2.htm

(solution 2 needs less than 24 moves)

It&#x27;s a bit complicated, but it can be simplified to obtain Guimond&#x27;s
method.

For my video (http://grrroux.free.fr), I used the famous DivX format.
All you need is a video processing utility like VirtualDub for Windows
(http://www.virtualdub.org) and the right encoder (http://www.divx.com).

Hope this helps,

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">I think that 27 is good.  Especially with only 12 algs.  I am a rare <br>
corners first weirdo that uses all the algs at speedcubing.com.  <br>
Basically I solve the corners by completely solving four adjacent <br>
corners, and then solve the bottom corners using one alg out of 42.  <br>
I think on average I am at 16 moves for the corners, but my worse <br>
case scenario is in between 20-25 moves.  I know the longest alg of <br>
the 42 is 11 moves. So supposing I got that case, and I took around <br>
11 on the first four, I would get 22.  That would be very bad for me. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
&gt; Now, on to the cube... I use a &quot;lite version&quot; of Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s <br>
&gt; method for the 3x3x3 (haven&#x27;t got all the OLL algs down yet).  <br>
&gt; However, I found that for the 2x2x2, my typical approach took too <br>
&gt; long.  Basically, I&#x27;d do the first layer, orient the corners (1 of <br>
7 <br>
&gt; cases), and then permute the corners (1 of 2 cases).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ve come up with a new method for the 2x2x2 that addresses it more <br>
&gt; like one would for a corners first approach of the 3x3x3 - taking <br>
&gt; advantage of shorter sequences that would otherwise impact edge <br>
&gt; pieces.  If I figured it out right, this new method takes a maximum <br>
&gt; (provided I don&#x27;t mess up) of 27 moves (half turns counted as one <br>
&gt; move).  I&#x27;m not sure what the average move count would be, but at <br>
&gt; least a little better than that.  Also, I only have 12 algs (3 more <br>
&gt; than my old way), and they are all 7 moves or less, except for 2.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; My question is this - for those who have an approach to the 2x2x2 <br>
or <br>
&gt; use corners first on the 3x3x3, how does this compare to your <br>
&gt; method?  Is a maximum of 27 moves good, or is that typical to <br>
&gt; mediocre?<br>

I average around 16 moves for corners(Not counting lining them up the <br>

for the bottom four. <br>

I am not quite sure what the worst-case scenario is for the first <br>

moves.  I know you can always get two adjacent corners in two moves <br>
or under.  The next two I am not sure about.  <br>
<br>
I was wondering, if you haven&#x27;t said already what method do you use <br>
to do the corners, and what is its average number of moves?<br>

I also think that there should be a category for doing it with your 
feet, but that&#x27;s just an idea.
I think the picture cube idea would be good, but I don&#x27;t know any 
algs for rotating a centerpiece.

I have a solving question about the megaminx. I can solve one <br>
unassisted pretty easily, but there&#x27;s one setup that I can&#x27;t fix. <br>
Any help would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
This happens when I have most of the minx already solved. When I am <br>
orienting the last 5 edges, it sometimes ends up that two of the <br>
edges are switched(e.g. the top face is blue, the left face is <br>
yellow and the right one is dark orange. The yellow/orange edge is <br>
oriented correctly. The blue/yellow edge is where the blue/orange <br>
edge should be, and the blue/orange edge is where the blue/yellow <br>
edge should be. Both are oriented correctly otherwise. All other <br>
edges are correctly placed). I&#x27;ve tried everything that I can think <br>
of but I can&#x27;t get these two switched back around without remixing <br>
the minx and restarting from an earlier stage.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">I just was given a Megaminx for Christmas.  After not messing it up 
for some time for fear of never solving it I finally gave it a spin.  
I was very excited to be able to solve almost the entire puzzle using 
a layer-by-layer method.  Then, because I solve corners first for the 
3x3 I didn&#x27;t know any last layer algs for the 3x3 to use on the 
megaminx.  I could however come up with an alg to place the corners 
in the right spot, and another to twist them.  So now all that are
left are the edges.  So I was wondering if anyone has any algs that 
moves the last layer edges and another that flips them, without 
messing with the corners.  If not I was wondering if anyone had some 
algs that did the edges and then some that do the corners.  

Thanks in advance,

My pointexactly! You speedcubing fellows completely neglect the 
centers. You try to solve larger and larger cubes. Mind you, I don&#x27;t 
object! That is great and highly respected skill. However, why don&#x27;t 
you  try to develop an algorithm for the centers a d solve a picture 
cube? That too, should be done at Toeonto. The rask of a cube artist 
would be to develop a picture cube that is as challenging as possibe. 
The task of the speedcubist would be to solve it.

They are, in fact, quite simple because they can be done using <br>
commutators. For example, to turn the U center clockwise and the L <br>
center counterclockwise, do:<br>
<br>
U X L&#x27; X&#x27;, where X = R L&#x27; F&#x27; B U&#x27; D.<br>

It&#x27;s not clear that this is a commutator - did you mean conjugate?

Not really - you just solve the centres last instead, using 3 
cycles. It would take more time but wouldn&#x27;t be any more

Since you&#x27;re not looking for a quick method you could try these 2 
algorithms (from Rubika Esoterica: 
http://web.usna.navy.mil/~wdj/RUBIKA.HTM )

m991 =U*B*L*U*L^(-1)*U^(-1)*B^(-1) 
and 
m992 =R^2*F*L*D^(-1)*R^(-1) 

- these generate the entire cube group so you can certainly do the 
last layer with them.
The permutations are a bit complicated but the orientations aren&#x27;t 
too bad (one of them - I forget which at the moment, but whichever 
has order 12) has the property that its 4th power twists 3 corners 
in a face and its 6th power flips 2 edges in a face.

Although it is in the commutator subgroup, even if it itself isn&#x27;t a 
commutator, but since this has index 2 in the cube group that&#x27;s 
probably not what you meant either.

          <div class="email-content">I personally would recommend doing edges (orient then permute) and <br>
then corners (orient then permute), but there are algs to do what <br>
you&#x27;re looking for.  For example, I found these at <br>
http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/megaminx.txt :<br>
<br>
3 cycle of edges (uf, lf, rf)<br>
  R+ F+ U+ F- U- R- L- U- F- U+ F+ L+<br>
<br>
2 edge flip<br>
  L-- R++ F+  U-  R+  U+  L++ R++ U+<br>
  R-- L-- U-  R-  U+  F-  R-- L++ U-<br>
<br>
2 edge flip<br>
  R- F- U+ L- U- L+ F+ R+<br>
  L+ F+ U- R+ U+ R- F- L-<br>
<br>
+ is one &quot;click&quot; clockwise<br>
- is one counterclockwise<br>
++ and -- are two clicks, in their respective directions.<br>
<br>
I do the LL in order of OE, PE, OC, PC, so I don&#x27;t actually use the <br>
algs above.  For the two edge flip algs above, I don&#x27;t actually know <br>
which edges it flips.<br>
For OE, I use (with the LL on U):<br>
  F+ U+ R+ U- R- F-  (flips adjacent edges UF and UR)<br>
  F+ R+ U+ R- U- F-  (flips opposite edges UF and UB - with B <br>
adjacent to R)<br>
  L+ F+ R+ U+ R- U+ F- U-- L- (flips all but UB, with B adjacent to L)<br>
<br>
For PE, I use:<br>
  R+ U+ R- U+ R+ U-- R- (3 edge cycle counter clockwise)<br>
  R+ U++ R- U- R+ U- R- (3 edge cycle clockwise)<br>
  R+ U+ R- U+ R+ U- R- U+ R+ U++ R- (swaps two pairs)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not even going to go into the corner algs I use... There are two <br>
many, and I don&#x27;t know of a good way to put them into notation.  Some <br>
cube algs can be applied for the OC and PC steps, as long as they <br>
don&#x27;t affect edges at all.  Some day, I&#x27;ll come up with some <br>
notation, and put a section on my website... Hope this helps.  Also, <br>
if you look back for it, I did post some PC algs a while ago in this <br>
group.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I am not quite sure what the worst-case scenario is for the first <br>
&gt; four corners; Like I said on average I can do it in around 7.5 <br>
&gt; moves.  I know you can always get two adjacent corners in two moves<br>
&gt; or under.  The next two I am not sure about.<br>
Really?  I would&#x27;ve thought the worst case for the first two corners <br>
would be more like 3 or 4 moves.  I suppose I could see this (2 moves <br>
worst case), though, if you don&#x27;t care which color you start with - I <br>
have a bad habit of always starting with the same color.  As far as <br>
worst case, though, the third corner would be 4 moves (I&#x27;m pretty <br>
sure), and the last one would be a worst case of 6 moves, for a grand <br>
total of 12 for the first four corners.  Add the longest LL alg of 11 <br>
and 1 move for lining up U and D, and your method has a worst case of <br>
24 moves, if I figured it out right.<br>
<br>
&gt; I was wondering, if you haven&#x27;t said already what method do you use <br>
&gt; to do the corners, and what is its average number of moves?<br>
Well, it&#x27;s a method that I came up with - kind of a variation on <br>
methods I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.  After talking it through with Ron, <br>
though, it appears that my method for the 2x2x2 is pretty much the <br>
same as Adam Cheyer&#x27;s approach for the corners of the 3x3x3 (though <br>
perhaps different algs).  For details, see steps 1-3 of his solution <br>
at http://www.ai.sri.com/~cheyer/rubiks/rubiks.html .<br>
<br>
As far as an average, I hadn&#x27;t really figured it out before, so I <br>
decided to spend some time on it.  I wrote up a little program and <br>
found out that 95% of the time, 0 moves are required to pair up the <br>
first two corners (if you don&#x27;t care about the starting color).  With <br>
that information, and some other things I figured out, the first face <br>
(four corners, not necessarily in correct positions) can be completed <br>
in an average of 4.33 moves.<br>
<br>
The second face can be oriented in 7 or less moves, though most are 7 <br>
moves, so the average is probably pretty close to 7.  The final step, <br>
permuting all corners, takes anywhere from 3 to 11 moves, with a <br>
weighted average of 7.69 moves.  So, in all, my method should take <br>
about 19 moves on average (not counting lining up U and D).  I think <br>
I&#x27;ll take the 3 move disadvantage (for both worst case and average <br>
case) along with the advantage of only having 12 algs, instead of 42.<br>

Thanks for the input from everyone, by the way!  I learned a lot from <br>
this little discussion.<br>

odd numbered cubes aren&#x27;t that hard to solve once you have one face 
and all centers/edges solved you really only need like 4 algs to 
solve the centers

Fair enough, but a lot of it has to do with conjugate theory too 
because permutations have nice properties under conjugation.

Yes. I should have done it earlier too but I passed through the 
solved state due to an alphabetical error on my part. (So, I&#x27;d 
solved it but didn&#x27;t realize it and did one more thing - but since 
then I have indeed done it 30th Dec.-31st Dec. (starting memorizing 
some time after 10.30 pm - whatever was on TV finished at 10.30 pm 
and then I saw a bit of LA Confidential and then I started, and 
finishing solving at 1.05 am so it was under 2 hours 35 minutes but 
I don&#x27;t have an exact time.)
I messed up twice near the start too but I realized and corrected 
it - in fact the second mistake was incorrectly correcting the first 
one!
My strategy was to orient the corners and the centre edges and to 
permute as much of the corners as possible (i.e. get 6 or 8 right). 
I can&#x27;t remember if I oriented centre edges before or after 
permuting corners but it was here that I messed up and corrected.
Then I did the centres - thought I may have messed up a couple of 
times here but I went on just in case - I was getting distracted by 
thinking of ways I could improve next time too and that didn&#x27;t help.
Then I joined the edges to the centres. After that it&#x27;s very much 
like solving the end of the revenge blindfolded (in that you can 
have one bad edge, although you don&#x27;t have to flip two edges).
Anyway, I have much harder blindfold attempts in mind but I may not 
be able to do those!
Not sure what the status is on the tape of my solving the cube 
blindfolded. I chased it up a little while back - I&#x27;ll try again. My 
friend is going to make two copies so I can send one to you as I was 
not able to visit last time I was in NY (but hopefully I will be in 
NY again within the next 4-5 months).

They said that there policy was that they don´t replace any cubes <br>
without first recieving the broken one.<br>
I sent the broken one over seas (from Sweden). And today I got a <br>
knock on my door from Schenker (the delivery company) with a brand <br>
new cube!<br>
&quot;Only&quot; cost me $5. And that was for the postage from Sweden. No <br>
charge for the freight.<br>
Just to let you know....<br>
/Papegoja<br>
<br>
May the cube be with you.... always!<br>

My average used to be about 1 1/2 minutes. Now it&#x27;s about 35 
seconds. When you get lower, you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re getting any 
better, it just happens. That&#x27;s how it was with me, anyway.
What method do you use?

i am doing the exact same thing i took time off from timing myself to 
learn some new stuff to improve my speed and it seems you are right 
in the same boat as me... i still use a layer by layer method to 
solve and my best non-lucky time is about 36 seconds... so i took the 
time and figured out where i was losing time and saw that my 
recognition hurts me... even though i can solve the last layer in 10-
12 seconds it hurts me that i take 2-3 seconds to see what to do in 
the LL... but also realized that it takes me at least 20 seconds to 
solve the F2L so i decided to work on that instead... using only 
about half of the F2L i have dropped about 2 seconds off of my pb to 
get to 34 but i still got a long way to go...

          <div class="email-content">Assuming that you can get the 1st layer without any algorithms, you should <br>
be able to solve the cube using just the following two:<br>
<br>
LFUF&#x27;U&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;U&#x27;RB&#x27;R&#x27;BUB (moves 3 edges while flipping 2 of them)<br>
<br>
BL2BR2B&#x27;L2BR2B2 (moves 3 corners while twisting 2 of them)<br>
<br>
You can insert edge pieces into the 2nd layer using LFUF&#x27;U&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;U&#x27;RB&#x27;R&#x27;BUB, <br>
but if you wanted to add a 3rd algorithm I suppose any algorithm to insert <br>

in order.  Say, URUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;U&#x27;F.<br>
<br>
The whole thing would take some patience as you cycle through the two main <br>
algorithms, but a bit of lateral thinking would cut down the number of <br>
cycles.  And if you really wanted to (I have not tested this) you could even <br>
combine these two into a singl alg. that moved edges and corners, and <br>
flipped and twisted them (e.g. LFUR&#x27;FR&#x27;U&#x27;L�DB�R�D&#x27;L, but come to think of it <br>
you could not use this to insert edges in f2l).  Whatever you did, speed <br>
would not really enter the equation!  And I would never recommend this to <br>
anyone: there are probably some more intuitive methods about that only use <br>
three algorithms.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, this isn&#x27;t a layer-by-layer method, but you could use this <br>
three phase method:<br>
Step 1: Position and orient all edges<br>
Step 2: Position corners<br>
Step 3: Orient corners<br>
<br>
You can do the whole thing with variations on one, four move alg.  <br>
It&#x27;s definitely not to be used for speed, but here are the 4 algs <br>
needed to accomplish the task:<br>
1) R B&#x27; R&#x27; B<br>
2) B&#x27; R B R&#x27; (Inverse of alg #1)<br>
3) (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B) (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B) (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B) (or alg #1 3 times)<br>
4) (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B) (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B) D (B&#x27; R B R&#x27;) (B&#x27; R B R&#x27;) D&#x27;<br>
   (Alg #1 twice, D, inverse of alg #1 twice, D&#x27;)<br>
   <br>
Algs #1 and #2 can be used for the purpose of positioning and <br>
orienting all edges.  This is how they impact the cube:<br>
1) Rotates three edges UR -&gt; BR -&gt; UB -&gt; UR<br>
   UR keeps same color on R<br>
   BR keeps same color on B<br>
   UB flips B color to U<br>
2) Rotates three edges UB -&gt; BR -&gt; UR -&gt; UB<br>
   UR flips R color to U<br>
   BR keeps same color on R<br>
   UB keeps same color on B<br>
   <br>
Even using these algs, it would probably be easiest to start with a <br>
cross on one face, do the middle layer (except for one &quot;working&quot; <br>
position), and then do the last layer (in the end, also correcting <br>
the middle layer &quot;working&quot; position).  Note that algs #1 and #2 mess <br>
up the corners, and as such edges should be done first.<br>
<br>
Algs #3 and #4 can be used to position and orient all the corners, <br>
without messing up the edges.  Again, this is what they do:<br>
3) Swaps two pairs of corners UFR &lt;-&gt; UBL and UBR &lt;-&gt; DBR<br>
   UFR and UBL keep the same color on U<br>
   UBR rotates U color to D<br>
   DBR rotates D color to U<br>
4) Rotates DBR clockwise (moves D color to R)<br>
   Rotates DFR counterclockwise (moves D color to R)<br>
<br>
If you do D2, in place of the D and D&#x27; moves in alg #4, you can <br>
rotate DFL counterclockwise, instead of DFR.  Also, you can instead <br>
rotate UFL counterclockwise if you do F2 before and after alg #4.  <br>
Regardless, probably the easiest way to use these algs would be to <br>
put three corners in their correct positions on one face, and then do <br>
the other face, again using the working position, orienting them all, <br>
after that.  So, repeat these steps until you have 3 (or 4) corners <br>
on D that are correctly positioned:<br>
- Find a corner on U that belongs on D, and turn U so it is at UBR.<br>
- Rotate D so that the D position that the corner belongs in is at <br>
DBR.<br>
- If no corners on U belong on D, instead rotate D so that an <br>
incorrectly placed corner on D is at DBR.<br>
- Do alg #3.<br>
- Realign D face.<br>
<br>
Once three corners on D are correctly placed, flip the cube over so <br>
that U and D switch places.  Position the cube so that the incorrect <br>
corner on U is at UBR.  Then, to finish placing U and D corners, <br>
repeat the steps above without any U rotations.  Notice that UFR and <br>
UBL will be swapped each time you do alg #3, but once the four D <br>
corners are in place all U corners will also be correct (if you did <br>
it right :-P ).<br>
<br>
All that&#x27;s left then is orienting the corners, for which alg #4 can <br>
be used.  Just repeat these steps:<br>
- Rotate the cube to put a corner that needs to rotate clockwise (or <br>
if none, any incorrect corner) into position DBR.<br>
- Keeping DBR in position, rotate the cube so that a corner that <br>
needs to rotate counterclockwise (or if none, any incorrect corner) <br>
is in DFR, DFL, or UFL.<br>
- Do Alg #4 with appropriate modifications (if using position DFL or <br>
UFL).<br>
<br>
This should get you to a solved cube.  Let me know if anything needs <br>
additional explanation.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I just got an interesting idea.  Speed cubists come up with methods, 
and the ones with more effecient methods are faster than ones with 
less effecient methods as a general rule.  What if there was a 
solving technique where you were only allowed to use one algorithm to 
solve the cube, however you were allowed to use inverses, 
reflections, etc. of that algorithm.  I guess you could try it where 
you could only use that algorithm and no other moves, not even 
helpful setup moves or you could also be allowed to do turns that you 
consider to just be intuitive.  Then you could solve for speed or 
fewest moves or fewest times you have to use your algorithm etc.  I 
don&#x27;t know if this is practical or if I&#x27;m even going anywhere with 
this, but I think it could be kind of cool.

          <div class="email-content">Here is a method that is not layer-by-layer, that uses 4 Algs.  It is 
very simple to learn.  It is kind of a corners first method and one 
alg is only 3 moves.  

http://jjorg.chem.unc.edu/personal/monroe/cube/rubik.html  

The first move positions corners, the next orients them.  The third 
(3moves) positions edges, and the fourth(easy to learn alg) flips two 
edges.

Also this method is easily transformed in to a speed method.

Interesting algorithms ... every move can be done with these ?

I was thinking about it; it doesn&#x27;t seem very easy : Do you know how 
to turn two adjacent corners with the second one ?

Are you also allowed to rotate the entire cube? If so then you might 
try the algorithm U - you don&#x27;t even need the inverse, as it is 
U*U*U, or reflections. Then rotating the cube you can get D, F, B, R 
or L (and their inverses) just by putting the appropriate face on 
top.

If you aren&#x27;t allowed to rotate the entire cube then I suspect you 
can&#x27;t do it with one algorithm - certainly if you don&#x27;t allow 
reflections you can&#x27;t as the cube group is not Abelian (i.e. there 
are x and y with xy not equal to yx). I&#x27;d be surprised if adding the 
reflections allowed it to be done.

That said, the cube group is a 2 generator group and it is posible 
to solve the thing with 2 algorithms and no auxillary moves (not 
sure you can also twist the centres with them though - you can 
simulate stuff like U, of course, but I&#x27;m not sure that doing so 
will also twist the centre piece appropriately.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody.<br>
I have just recieved a mail from Guinness, that says that none of my <br>
record attempts can be recognized. The problem with the speed record <br>
is the guidelines and they said that the category &quot;2000 cubes in 24 <br>
hours&quot; would not qualify for a Guinness record, even though they <br>
aproved it before I started. Of couse I would never start solving <br>
2000 cubes if they hadn&#x27;t said go for it.<br>
Here are the guidelines to break fastest time:<br>
<br>
FASTEST TIME TO COMPLETE <br>
A RUBIK CUBE GUIDELINES <br>
<br>
The following act as a guide to the specific considerations <br>
and undertakings, in addition to the general requirements,<br>
for any potential attempt on the `Fastest time to complete a <br>
Rubik cube&#x27;. They should be read and understood <br>
by all concerned  organisers, participants and witnesses  <br>
prior to the event. <br>
 <br>
RULES <br>
<br>
1.	The cubes used should be standard Rubik&#x27;s Cubes (new from the <br>
box/carton/packaging), one for each of the two independent witnesses. <br>
2.	The witnesses should undo the packaging.  <br>
3.	Each witness should shuffle his/her cube for 40 random moves, <br>
unseen by the challenger.<br>
4.	The contestant selects one of the two cubes offered after <br>
shuffling. They must not attempt to dislocate the pieces.<br>
5.	Both witnesses should be equipped with accurate stopwatches.<br>
6.	At a pre-arranged signal from one of the two witnesses the <br>
challenge is begun.<br>
7.	The witnesses should stop their stopwatches when the <br>
contestant holds up the completed cube at full arm&#x27;s length.<br>
8.	The witnesses must then check that the cube has been solved <br>
correctly.<br>
<br>
That means that the official record for 1 cube is still 22.95 seconds <br>
held by Minh Thai.<br>
At this point I don&#x27;t care about the speed record, but I will fight <br>
for my record of 2000 cubes being concidered official.<br>
They can&#x27;t aprove the category first and say no afterwards.<br>
Just wanted to let you know.<br>

the x y and z notation are rotations of the whole cube....heres a

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Hi everybody.<br>
&gt; I have just recieved a mail from Guinness, that says that none of <br>
my record attempts can be recognized. The problem with the speed <br>
record <br>
&gt; is the guidelines and they said that the category &quot;2000 cubes in 24 <br>
&gt; hours&quot; would not qualify for a Guinness record, even though they <br>
&gt; aproved it before I started. Of couse I would never start solving <br>
&gt; 2000 cubes if they hadn&#x27;t said go for it.<br>
&gt; Here are the guidelines to break fastest time:<br>
<br>
So sorry, Jess. <br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think guiness is the one who decide official or not. <br>
They can decide the guiness rules. <br>
But there are no sports and games that the guiness rules. <br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t you think can&#x27;t we decide the official rule? <br>
If we could keep doing, they must follow us. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, they could qualify your 2000 cubes record. <br>
<br>
Actually, I don&#x27;t like  the rule for pops. <br>
Just 12 times no excuse sounds better to me. <br>

i got a question how long have you been cubing... i&#x27;ve been cubing 
for about 6 months and i average about 45 with pb of 34... it seems 
at times that 14 is unreachable but have done a lot of research on 
jessica&#x27;s and ron&#x27;s pages and see that times of 14 are very ahievable 
and always tell myself that these people getting sub 20 times have 
years of experience and just pat myself on the back for where i am 
and shoot for higher goals... the motavation and will power has to be 
there or the goal will never be reached... hoped that helped.  :)

exactly what my question was gonna be... even though my initial 
thought was that the only way to set the new speed record was to get 
fastest in competition but since we can use our own cubes in toranto 
will the fastest time count cuz it&#x27;s not new/sealed????...

40 random moves? I remember the cubes only being twisted 25 times at 
the previous championship..

Minh Thai only got one option, as did all of the other people at the

The contestants at the last one had to replace the cube on the table 
when completed.

I know I&#x27;m probably jumping to conclusions, but judging by the rules 
above, Minh Thai didn&#x27;t go by the rules either, did he? Therefore, 
either you should have the world record, or Minh Thai shouldn&#x27;t.

one other thing that i have thought about is who else does it really 
matter to about who has done what with a cube but us fanatics and we 
all know who solved 2000 cubes in 24 hours and we all will bow to him 
till the person comes along to break his record... but i am with 
everyone about the record and i know it was done cuz i watched at 
least 15 out of the 22 hours

On the World Championship website, they used a comparison of in a 
tennis contest, the players use their own rackets, so we should use 
our own cubes. It was either tennis, or skiing... Anyway, that&#x27;s 
beside the point. I completely agree, and there&#x27;s this website where

          <div class="email-content">Guinness need 4-6 weeks to handle a case.<br>
I contacted Guinness by phone and mail and set a date 8 weeks later <br>
where I would solve the cubes (Dec. 16th)<br>
I would then have some time to prepare further if anything unforsen <br>
should come up.<br>
They contacted me by mail about 6 weeks later and said I could keep <br>
track of my attempt online at a given address.<br>
When I logged in it said something like:<br>
&quot;2000 Rubik&#x27;s cubes in 24 hours - attempt aproved&quot;, I should then <br>
wait further 6 weeks for rules and guidelines.<br>
I could not wait for this but just had to take the precautions I <br>
could by streaming live, have witnesses and involving Danish <br>
television.<br>
I didn&#x27;t think rules or guidelines meant actually deciding if the <br>
category should be aproved or not.<br>
I feel bad for all the people I have involved and people who have <br>
helped me with this record attempt.<br>
But I will call Guinness tomorrow and talk to them.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I am sorry for Jess. It is quite an achievement  to solve 2000 cubes <br>
in less than 24 hours.<br>
<br>
I am not a speed cubist, but my 3Dcube art appears to be one-of-a-<br>
kind. I do not know anyone who can do it. I cannot find anyone on the <br>
Web who can do it. So I approached the Guinness and zsked them if <br>
*they* know anybody. And if no one can be found, would they, please, <br>
consider including it in as an unusual skill and put it in one of <br>
their categories. Of course I am not stupid enough to assume they <br>
would just lift a design from http://cube.misto.cz and put it in <br>
their book. I was willing to twiddle a design just in front of their <br>
witnesses, demonstrate parity pairs, etc. I would be very satisfied <br>
if someone else was found and if I was given his/her name and contact <br>
information.<br>
<br>
After a while they sent me an email telling me they cannot include my <br>
designs because they don&#x27;t know anyone who does them! They were too <br>
polite to say so, but I suspect they were questioning their <br>
authenticity. I didn&#x27;t know whether to laugh or cry. I prefer <br>
laughing.<br>
<br>
Dan and the wc2003 organizers: let this be a warning to you - make <br>
ABSOLUTELY SURE that you an Guinness agree on the rules and that <br>
those rules are followed in the championships. Otherwise you may be <br>
breaking records they don&#x27;t recognize.<br>
<br>
Somebody suggested in an email that I would achieve the same visual <br>
effect if I used 1x1x1 cubes instead. Well, if I did that, I would be <br>
breaking my own rules that I posted on wc2003. Such a &quot;cube art&quot; has <br>
no place in Toronto. All thr cubes used in all the designs are 3x3x3 <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cubes. Didn&#x27;t I just tell you that I am not stupid?<br>
<br>
I agree with Jessica. Yoyr own gym shoes, track-and-field shoes, <br>
skates and Rubik&#x27;s cubes are always the best!<br>

These rules look remarkably like the ones for blindfold cubing 
(which Ralf Laue sent me). In fact except for 4. they are word for 
word exactly the same.
The difference was:

&quot;4.	The contestant selects one of the two cubes offered after 
shuffling,
which they are allowed to examine for ten minutes prior to being
blindfolded.
They must not attempt to dislocate the pieces.&quot;

It seems odd that they are so similar.

Rules 1 and 2 make more sense for blindfold cubing (so that you 
can&#x27;t have a braille like cube) - I&#x27;ve painted my 5x5x5 and one of 
my 3x3x3&#x27;s so that people don&#x27;t think I am using peeling stickers to 
figure stuff out - not that I think that would be easy to do.

Yes, I was thinking the same thing.

And it&#x27;s not just the &quot;new out of the box&quot; aspect of these rules 
which differ to what people are probably expecting at the WC.

If you have a look at the Rubiks WC site on the &quot;Rules and 
Regulations (Provisional}&quot; page 
(http://www.rubikswc2003.com/pages/812665/index.htm), you&#x27;ll see that 
there are many things listed there which are different to the rules 
from Guinness that Jess has just shown us. For example, the WC page 
says &quot;The number of random moves depends on the puzzle: Rubiks 2x2x2, 
Rubiks 3x3x3: 25 moves&quot;, where Guinness says &quot;Each witness should 
shuffle his/her cube for 40 random moves&quot;.

I&#x27;m guessing that most people would generally agree that the rules as 
currently set out on the WC are preferable to the Guinness rules 
(especially the one about using your own cube), but I&#x27;m sure that we 
also want the speed times at the WC to be officially recognised!!

Jasmine.

Good luck with getting them to accept your record, particularly the 
endurance record. I hope to see your name in the next edition. :)

Bigger sports can decide ther rules because the sportsmen are not trying to get a guinnies approved record but rather a record approved by that sports international federation. Like when I was competing in archery there was FITA deciding the rules and records. In cubing we dont have something like international federation of cubing sports. But if we can agree on a set of rules that most people accept we dont need to care about what guinnies think.

the 1982 championships (including Minh Thai).  I notice that no provision is <br>
made for this in the guidelines below, so presumably Minh Thai&#x27;s record is <br>
also not officially official?<br>
S.<br>
<br>
&gt;Here are the guidelines to break fastest time:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;FASTEST TIME TO COMPLETE<br>
&gt;A RUBIK CUBE GUIDELINES<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The following act as a guide to the specific considerations<br>
&gt;and undertakings, in addition to the general requirements,<br>
&gt;for any potential attempt on the `Fastest time to complete a<br>
&gt;Rubik cube&#x27;. They should be read and understood<br>
&gt;by all concerned - organisers, participants and witnesses -<br>
&gt;prior to the event.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;RULES<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;1.	The cubes used should be standard Rubik&#x27;s Cubes (new from the<br>
&gt;box/carton/packaging), one for each of the two independent witnesses.<br>
&gt;2.	The witnesses should undo the packaging.<br>
&gt;3.	Each witness should shuffle his/her cube for 40 random moves,<br>
&gt;unseen by the challenger.<br>
&gt;4.	The contestant selects one of the two cubes offered after<br>
&gt;shuffling. They must not attempt to dislocate the pieces.<br>
&gt;5.	Both witnesses should be equipped with accurate stopwatches.<br>
&gt;6.	At a pre-arranged signal from one of the two witnesses the<br>
&gt;challenge is begun.<br>
&gt;7.	The witnesses should stop their stopwatches when the<br>
&gt;contestant holds up the completed cube at full arm&#x27;s length.<br>
&gt;8.	The witnesses must then check that the cube has been solved<br>
&gt;correctly.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;That means that the official record for 1 cube is still 22.95 seconds<br>
&gt;held by Minh Thai.<br>
&gt;At this point I don&#x27;t care about the speed record, but I will fight<br>
&gt;for my record of 2000 cubes being concidered official.<br>
&gt;They can&#x27;t aprove the category first and say no afterwards.<br>

On the World Championship website, they used a comparison of in a
tennis contest, the players use their own rackets, so we should use
our own cubes. It was either tennis, or skiing... Anyway, that&#x27;s
beside the point. I completely agree, and there&#x27;s this website where
you can make a petition. I think it&#x27;s petitiononline.net. Just a
second.........
Nope, it&#x27;s petitiononline.COM.
This ordeal reminds me of something that happened a few years ago...
Go to www.PotterWar.org.uk to read about it, if you want to.

Subject: The problem with the attempt

Guinness need 4-6 weeks to handle a case.
I contacted Guinness by phone and mail and set a date 8 weeks later
where I would solve the cubes (Dec. 16th)
I would then have some time to prepare further if anything unforsen
should come up.
They contacted me by mail about 6 weeks later and said I could keep
track of my attempt online at a given address.
When I logged in it said something like:
&quot;2000 Rubik&#x27;s cubes in 24 hours - attempt aproved&quot;, I should then
wait further 6 weeks for rules and guidelines.
I could not wait for this but just had to take the precautions I
could by streaming live, have witnesses and involving Danish
television.
I didn&#x27;t think rules or guidelines meant actually deciding if the
category should be aproved or not.
I feel bad for all the people I have involved and people who have
helped me with this record attempt.
But I will call Guinness tomorrow and talk to them.
Jess.

A similar thing happened to me. Guinness was a cosponsor of the
Swedish championships, and promised that the winner would be in the
next Swedish edition. But then I wasn&#x27;t.

This seems like a good time to reiterate my opinion that we just
ignore Guinness. Their suggestion for how to conduct a cube
competition or approve a record is only the uninformed opinion of
some people in the book publishing business.

I say the opinions of the speed cubers of the world is far more
important. And if we decide upon some rules for this, I guarantee
that Guinness will accept them. You don&#x27;t think they dictate the
rules for Olympic sports like this, do you?

The operative word is of course &quot;if&quot;. Until we have decided on some
sensible rules of our own, the Guinness rules will be the best there
are.

That&#x27;s a good idea. We should come up with fair rules from a
speedcubers point of view, and ask if Guinness will use them.
But for now, I think we should just go by what we know as the record,
which is 16.92 seconds.

Subject: Guinness

I am sorry for Jess. It is quite an achievement  to solve 2000 cubes
in less than 24 hours.

I am not a speed cubist, but my 3Dcube art appears to be one-of-a-
kind. I do not know anyone who can do it. I cannot find anyone on the
Web who can do it. So I approached the Guinness and zsked them if
*they* know anybody. And if no one can be found, would they, please,
consider including it in as an unusual skill and put it in one of
their categories. Of course I am not stupid enough to assume they
would just lift a design from http://cube.misto.cz and put it in
their book. I was willing to twiddle a design just in front of their
witnesses, demonstrate parity pairs, etc. I would be very satisfied
if someone else was found and if I was given his/her name and contact
information.

After a while they sent me an email telling me they cannot include my
designs because they don&#x27;t know anyone who does them! They were too
polite to say so, but I suspect they were questioning their
authenticity. I didn&#x27;t know whether to laugh or cry. I prefer
laughing.

Dan and the wc2003 organizers: let this be a warning to you - make
ABSOLUTELY SURE that you an Guinness agree on the rules and that
those rules are followed in the championships. Otherwise you may be
breaking records they don&#x27;t recognize.

Somebody suggested in an email that I would achieve the same visual
effect if I used 1x1x1 cubes instead. Well, if I did that, I would be
breaking my own rules that I posted on wc2003. Such a &quot;cube art&quot; has
no place in Toronto. All thr cubes used in all the designs are 3x3x3
Rubik&#x27;s cubes. Didn&#x27;t I just tell you that I am not stupid?

I agree with Jessica. Yoyr own gym shoes, track-and-field shoes,
skates and Rubik&#x27;s cubes are always the best!

These rules look remarkably like the ones for blindfold cubing
(which Ralf Laue sent me). In fact except for 4. they are word for
word exactly the same.
The difference was:

&quot;4. The contestant selects one of the two cubes offered after
shuffling,
which they are allowed to examine for ten minutes prior to being
blindfolded.
They must not attempt to dislocate the pieces.&quot;

It seems odd that they are so similar.

Rules 1 and 2 make more sense for blindfold cubing (so that you
can&#x27;t have a braille like cube) - I&#x27;ve painted my 5x5x5 and one of
my 3x3x3&#x27;s so that people don&#x27;t think I am using peeling stickers to
figure stuff out - not that I think that would be easy to do.

Yes, I was thinking the same thing.

And it&#x27;s not just the &quot;new out of the box&quot; aspect of these rules
which differ to what people are probably expecting at the WC.

If you have a look at the Rubiks WC site on the &quot;Rules and
Regulations (Provisional}&quot; page
(http://www.rubikswc2003.com/pages/812665/index.htm), you&#x27;ll see that
there are many things listed there which are different to the rules
from Guinness that Jess has just shown us. For example, the WC page
says &quot;The number of random moves depends on the puzzle: Rubiks 2x2x2,
Rubiks 3x3x3: 25 moves&quot;, where Guinness says &quot;Each witness should
shuffle his/her cube for 40 random moves&quot;.

I&#x27;m guessing that most people would generally agree that the rules as
currently set out on the WC are preferable to the Guinness rules
(especially the one about using your own cube), but I&#x27;m sure that we
also want the speed times at the WC to be officially recognised!!

This is terrible news Jess. I consider you to be a Rubiks record

Good luck with getting them to accept your record, particularly the
endurance record. I hope to see your name in the next edition. :)

Bigger sports can decide ther rules because the sportsmen are not trying to
get a guinnies approved record but rather a record approved by that sports
international federation. Like when I was competing in archery there was
FITA deciding the rules and records. In cubing we dont have something like
international federation of cubing sports. But if we can agree on a set of
rules that most people accept we dont need to care about what guinnies
think.

          <div class="email-content">Hi GOD2, et al,

   What if the packaged cubes are a different color pattern than what
you&#x27;re used to? 

   Even in a blindfold event, a new-out-of-the-package cube isn&#x27;t
necessary. If all the cubes are inspected beforehand for braille-like
tactile markings, and have none, that should be sufficient.

   For tournaments perhaps some people can get together and prepare a
batch of speedcubes ahead of time, i.e. sand them, clean them, lube
them, adjust them. You could have far more than two acceptable cubes
ready.

   All that may be needed for Guiness to deal with this fairly is the
right publicity.

Whilst it doesn&#x27;t specify 15 seconds, presumably it intends that the 
selecting in 4. is done on the basis of seeing the cube (perhaps) or 
else in 6. (the pre-arranged signal might come after 15 seconds).

          <div class="email-content">Rule  4 of the rules is hilarious! It says something that *They* <br>
should not break the cube apart. The wording is different, but that&#x27;s <br>
how I inerpret the meaning.<br>
<br>
Who are they? The contestants? SPEEDCUBISTS???????????? Not even cube <br>
artists can do that!!<br>
<br>
However, we cannot &quot;forget about Guinness&quot;, as Lars suggests, if the <br>
cube efforts are to be recognized. Rather, we have to work with them <br>
in order to chsnge the rules. They should realize that:<br>
1. The solution algorithms are independent of whether the cubes are <br>
colored differently, whether thery are fresh out of the box, or old <br>
cubes belonging to the contestant. The witnesses should be handed a <br>
solved cube, although that isn&#x27;t neccessary.<br>
2. NO ONE will think of breaking the cube apart,certainly not in a <br>
speedcubing contest.<br>
3. Times have changed since 1982. Several of the categories (computer <br>
stuff, cube art) and some of the puzzles were unknown then.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
First of all: I feel very sorry for Jess that there are problems with the<br>
recognition of his records.<br>
<br>
About the cube marathon record: there should be no doubts about his fantastic<br>
record. He did it, there are many witnesses (including me by webcam), he<br>
followed the procedures, and we all recognize it. Jess, you worked hard for it<br>
and deserve it! If I can help you with anything, then please let me know. I am<br>
sure in the end Guinness will recognize this marathon record. Of course that<br>
does not mean that Guinness will also publish this record in the book. I think<br>
they should!<br>
<br>
About the single cube record: I posted before (message #2111) that I feel that<br>
there should be special conditions (timer device and stuff) for this record. I<br>
think some of the current Guinness conditions are ridiculous. I am not even<br>
going to try to prove my point here. I was surprised when Jess told us in<br>
message #2125 that Guinness did not have many requirements for this record.<br>
Unfortunately we now know that they do have requirements... If Jess would have<br>
known these, then he would still have broken the current record.<br>
<br>
What we actually need here is an official union/association/federation of<br>
speedcubists (like IAAF for athletics and FIFA for soccer) that, among other<br>
things, defines the official rules for our hobby/sports. I proposed this in<br>
message #1870, but I never received any positive reaction on this proposal.<br>
<br>
So I am going to try again:<br>
= who agrees with me that we need a World SpeedCubing Association (WSCA)?<br>
= apart from rules and regulations what other activities should we expect from a<br>
WSCA?<br>
= Jessica, do you want to be our first chairwoman?<br>

Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree completely that we need a World SpeedCubing Association, 
however we need to do it right.  It would not be fun to have a group 
that sets rules and recognizes records that no one listens to.  I 
think this WSCA should regulate ALL the rules for the world 
competition and it should be announced as much as possible that the 
WSCA is setting the rules and recognizing the records for these 
attempts.  Then we&#x27;ll need an official page that has an &quot;Official 
Records&quot; section that shows only the records the WSCA recognizes.  If 
we do this I think the world competition is the ONLY way that anyone 
will listen to this organization.  Jess I&#x27;m very sorry about the 
situation with Guinness.  I hope things work out for you without much 
hassle.  I do think that if we form this organization then Jess&#x27; 
marathon record should be the first official one.  That being said 
I&#x27;m willing to help if we try to form the WSCA because I think it is 
an excellent idea - if we do it right.

there is no way that you don&#x27;t know about jess&#x27; marathon... he solved 
2000 cubes in a little over 22 hours and i think the average was 
22.94 seconds per cube which beats the (old) world record for a 
single cube by .01 seconds

          <div class="email-content">Speedstacking was on Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not last night.
Anyway, that would be a GREAT idea to have a speedcubing organization 
like that. If Guinness won&#x27;t let us set records for them, then we can 
set ones for us. I once saw a magazine about speedcubing, wonder who 
made that...

  making me want to try speedstacking :) I also realized exactly how <br>
  much they have done to make their sport official.  It seems that the <br>

  I think we should definitely talk to the employees of that company <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey did you know the Speedstacking group is called the WCSA, and 
we&#x27;re going to be called the WSCA? What a coincedence.
I think we could probably just start a group right here right now, 
and call ourselves official. However, to get people interested, we 
would need a website and loads of stuff like that stacking group have.

          <div class="email-content">I am behind the idea of an international Cubing group, and It seems most of you all are as well.  Support and recognition for this group could most easily be obtained by involvement in the competition in August, because many more than just, &quot;our usual crowd&quot; will be there to express their interests in the cube.  (WC2003 organizers could assist here).  T-Shirts and Promotional cubes might be able to be obtained through support by Rubiks and be given away at the competiton, or paid for through membership fees, if any.  Website is a must.  I think the most important part of a cube groups&#x27; existance is simply promotion of the cube, and the joy we get from it... setting and maintaining records should be a secondary function.  Sorry to here about Guiness, Jess.  But I watched several hours of your marathon, and will remain impressed forever anyway.<br>

  I think Ron&#x27;s idea of forming an official club such as the World SpeedCubing Association is a great idea.  As Ron said, this organization could form standardized rules, organize events, andkeep track of official records.  I believe that if there was an organization like this, Jess might not be having quite the difficulties with Giunness as he is currently having.  Anyone have any thoughts about whether or not an organization like this should be formed?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Speaking of tennis racquets and running shoes, isn&#x27;t it interesting how<br>
their design has been improved over the decades, but the cube&#x27;s design<br>
has actually worsened?<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s one idea for an improvement:<br>
<br>
On the edges of each piece, why not display a bit of the colour that&#x27;s<br>
around the corner? For example, the red side of a red-yellow edge could<br>
also display a bit of yellow along the edge.<br>
<br>
Of course, you might say this has an unfair advantage over normal cubes<br>
(you can see around corners), but on the other hand, maybe new cube<br>
designs are what&#x27;s needed to some day break the 10 second barrier.<br>
<br>
The other point that needs attention is better turning cubes. Does<br>
anyone have any ideas for that? Most people probably can&#x27;t turn the cube<br>
as fast as they can think. <br>

Even people who might not have time to help much (like me) can still 
contribute by voicing support for such an organisation. I imagine 
that it would be taken more seriously if there were, say, 100 people 
in support of it than just a dozen people.

Is there any way to attach a poll to this yahoogroups site? Maybe we 
could get an indication of how many people agree with the idea in 
principle (putting aside specifics like the exact acronym of the 
organisation)? And how many people would want to join?

Hi !<br>
I&#x27;m also supporting the idea of a World governing body for the <br>
Cubists.<br>
But there is more than the fun stuff that we should figure for <br>
something of this magnitude. ( fun stuff is : the name, magazine, <br>
website... )<br>
So we must have a look at other World Associations to see what it <br>
takes )<br>
After a look at the HandBook of the Chess Federation, <br>
http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp<br>
It&#x27;s a Huge document that seems to cover everything needed.<br>
<br>
My guess is that the harder part will come for administrative issues.<br>
<br>
The first duty of such an organisation would be to edit once a year, <br>
a document like this explainning completely the rules for various <br>
competitions and official disciplines, statues of the organisation <br>
and how it works internally, who does what etc...How national <br>
associations can join...who is official sub association, who can edit <br>
other things...<br>
I have this kind of book for IAAF (Athletics) ( lots of various <br>
disciplines and records, so it maybe closer to the cube)<br>
<br>
Something else... To start an association is highly dependant on the <br>
country you live in. ( so for a planetary one ?? it must have a base <br>
country I think )<br>
<br>
Ah... a last thing about using your own cube.<br>
Like someone said it would be easier to use a cube if on a particular <br>
edge you can see the color of the other side without turning the cube.<br>
<br>
When my cube starts to be used for a while the stickers begin to <br>
fade. This way I can recognize the blue/white edge because the white <br>
side sticker has a very particular shape/tint...<br>
What if your own cube allow you to foresee every cubie just looking <br>
at one side of it ?<br>

That would be a mnemonic not an acronym. (RUBIK is an acronym for 
Robotic Unused Bricks In Kansas).

Anyway, the K makes life difficult unless you use the current trend 
amongst the young of today of mispelling words (e.g. &quot;Krazy&quot; instead 
of &quot;Crazy&quot;) as it would then be much easier. (e.g. Readily 
Understandable By Internet Klues - but that&#x27;s a cheat).

If you allow for CUBE instead of RUBIK you could have Curiously 
Undiscovered Before Erno or the rather paradoxical, oxymoronic 
Cunningly Unfathomable But Easy (which in a way describes the two 
opposite ends of cubing).

I suppose the sequence of words doesn&#x27;t actually have to relate to 
the cube. It is after all just a sequence of words to enable 
decoding of the word by initial letters.

Reed Urges Bettering In Kabukiman would work. (If you happen to have 
seen the Troma film &quot;Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD&quot; you&#x27;ll understand this, 
but it&#x27;s classified 18 in the UK so you can&#x27;t see it (here) if 
you&#x27;ve not reached adulthood.)

> Doesn&#x27;t work very well..

The K will always make things harder (in English at least). Maybe it 
can be done in Finnish?

I guess I missed the point that RUBIK would be an acronym for an 
organization. I was thinking that what was wanted was just any 
phrase for which RUBIK was an acronym.

(So my half cockney- half Yorkshire &quot;Rather &#x27;Uge Bear Is Kodiak&quot;, 
doesn&#x27;t really work, plus it&#x27;s really terrible.)

Technically an acronym is formed from the initial letters of the 
words that are the mnemonic for the acronym so you&#x27;d have to have 
the last word start with K.

A thesaurus would probably be of some use.

What  do I think of this email? It&#x27;s a classic display of the 3B law. 
During my long life I have seen so many examples of the 3B law, that

LARS!!!! And what do you think is an acronym of *that*?????
How about calling it Association of Rubik Solving? Its acronym - ARS -
 means art in Latin.:-)

The regulations could have things like the rules for competitions,

          <div class="email-content">I agree.  We need some organization and direction.  I also think it <br>
would be helpful to move this discussion somewhere else - dedicated <br>
solely to the organization of our official group.  If others <br>
disagree, then never mind, but I would think it would be useful to <br>
have those interested in working on organizing the group to have a <br>
separate place for serious discussion.  That said, I&#x27;ve created a new <br>
Yahoo group &quot;OfficialCubistsGroup&quot; to get us started.  Send an e-mail <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron<br>
<br>
I am sorry I will not be able to participate in the discussions in <br>
the next few weeks because there was a death in my family and I am <br>
unexpectedly flying to Europe today and I will most likely not be <br>
able to access e-mail for sufficiently long time to read the hoards <br>
of postings that will surely accumulate here ...<br>
<br>
Here are just a few thoughts I had so far:<br>
<br>
A) We need to figure out why we need such an organization and what <br>
it should do and what it should not.<br>
<br>
B) We need to find out how one goes about creating it and what it <br>
takes. Where to get this info? Any ideas?<br>
<br>
This breaks up into many specific questions, such as<br>
<br>
1. The big question for discussion is the scope of the organization <br>
and its mission. Should we include other puzzles than the Rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube? <br>
<br>
2. Do we list those puzzles specifically or do we define them as a <br>
category in case new puzzles appear or do we simply <br>
make &quot;amendments&quot; whenever new one appears? <br>
<br>
3. Do we have to list all disciplines or will we be able/allowed to <br>
add new disciplines? Do we have to get an approval for new <br>
disciplines? <br>
<br>
4. Obviously, an important question here is the degree of autonymity <br>
of such organization. How much will it be to create its rules <br>
independently of any other higher authority. I just have no clue <br>
what is possible and what is not.<br>
<br>
5. Official organization means administration, staff, and $$$. I <br>
think that obtaining an official recognition and status and keeping <br>
it will cost money. That would mean membership fees for those who <br>
decide to participate. Or not?<br>
<br>
6. We do need somebody who will be in charge, compile the <br>
suggestions and who will keep a sense of direction and the big <br>
picture. Maybe there will have to be some organizational board, who <br>
knows what requirements are imposed by those who will give the <br>
blessing to our LARS, ROSS, RICHARD, or whatever the acronym will <br>
turn out to be?<br>
<br>
... zillions of other issues ...<br>
<br>
I will see you in two weeks, I guess.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

Layers method : 
For the first 2 layers, after the cross, I use the algorithms found 
on http://www.speedcubing.com/ (I place the 4 corners+edges).

And for the last layer, a simple (but not very quick!) 4 steps 
method (orient edges, corners, then permute edges, corners).

I want to improve my speed : 
- for the last layer, I know what to do : I&#x27;m learning algorithms to 
permute all in one step ; it&#x27;s my next objective
- for the first 2 layers : I don&#x27;t know how to improve the speed, 
that&#x27;s why I asked this question (what&#x27;s your strategy for the first 
2 layers ?) ...

You should check the Simplification section in stiff&#x27;s hands website.
If you&#x27;ll see the algoritms there you&#x27;ll be able to understand the 
whole system. which is:

Orient corners, orient edges, premute coeners, premure edges.

It&#x27;s in the links section. Since they&#x27;re in alphabetical order, 
blindfold cubing is very near the start.
Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have access to pdf writing facilities at the 
moment so I am having to write my advanced method up in Word rather 
than in TeX.
The advanced method is harder to learn - I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do 
it - but should be much quicker for those who can master it.
There should be an intermediate level as well but I will write the 
advanced method first.

Are you sure you are ready for blindfold cubing?<br>

As a man who once studied cubes might have said, &quot;There is no royal 
road to blindfold cube solving.&quot;

The simplest case would use about 4 algorithms:

flip 2 edges, twist 2 corners, cycle 3 edges, cycle 3 corners (you 
may have to use another move somewhere - if so &quot;U&quot; would be fine - 
hopefully that algorithm is short enough).

If you can solve the cube you should know (or be able to easily 
compute) algorithms to do all of these anyway.

You&#x27;re not missing anything. It can be useful to have an algorithm 
like:

U&#x27; L2 D F2 D&#x27; L2 B2 D&#x27; R2 D B2 (although if it came up, you can 
always just use U and then use algorithms as above).

> all the stages needed/how to 
> know what to apply based on number.

To each piece and orientation you need to assign a number. Then you 
keep a mental map of the numbers in your mind. See what each move 
does to the numbers - try it out first without a blindfold on.
The goal should be to restore the numbers to their usual sequence (1-
8 or 1-12) for the positions and to 0 for the orientations.

First you should orient the corners and edges.
For instance, for the corners you want the U and D faces to contain 
only U and D colours.
Edge orientation is a little more complicated.

Do all your corner permutations in the U layer or the D layer.

Do your edge permutations in the U, D, L or R layers.

(The extra move above moves corners and edges, so it should be done 
in the U or D layer.)

(If you do the moves in other layers you will have to correct the 
orientations again.)

this?

Currently my best available document is the pdf file in the links. I 
have a much better system in terms of speed and thoroughness, but it 
would be hard for anybody but the most studious to learn it well. 
For instance the first two stages alone contain almost twice as many 
algorithms as Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s speed cubing method (by which I 
mean the method if you don&#x27;t learn more than one algorithm a case, 
but in which I am including the F2L algorithms as well as the LL 
algorithms).

I put up two of the shorter stages in recent posts, namely stages 4 
and 7. A lot of these algorithms were worked out on Kociemba&#x27;s Cube 
Solver - my contribution to this method was basically just figuring 
out all the possible situations and formulating what I&#x27;d need 
algorithms for, plus working out the probabilities and expected 
number of moves - but some of the algorithms are due to Jessica. (In 
my original beginner system (as in the pdf file) most if not all the 
algorithms were either Jessica&#x27;s or were made by sticking two of 
Jessica&#x27;s together.)

The problem with this is that just doing the orientation may not get 
you into the appropriate subgroup (perhaps it does, but that 
certainly would need justification). Also getting to the subgroup in 
an optimal way would likely move about many things at once (not good 
for blindfold cubing) and would take much planning.

          <div class="email-content">I would like to thank you for that exdplanation. It cleared a few <br>
things up and shined some more light on the subject. I still need to <br>
understand a bit more but so far I realize that I must use the three-<br>
edge cycle, the three-corner cycle, the two-corner orient, the two-<br>
edge orient, and the two-corner-two-edge swap. <br>
<br>
However I still have a few questions. What is the method of <br>
temprarily turning layers, executing an algorithm, and then reversing <br>
those temporary layers? I know HOW it can help but I would just like <br>
to know of a good example, for such. Like, if the corner you wanted <br>
to shuffle was on the D layer and you wanted it on the U layer you <br>
could turn the F face and then execute a three-corner permute, and <br>
then followed by an F&#x27;, which allowed you to &quot;spiut a corner that was <br>
on the bottom to the top for the cycle.<br>
<br>
That was just one instance though... I still don&#x27;t know the real <br>
method for doing such.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GameofDeath2, how do you number your cube in terms of corners/edges? <br>
(Sorry but that last post of yours has totally inspired me, lol). <br>
Very excited... I know how a corner is oriented in terms of 0, 1, and <br>
2 (like, if it were a 1, that means the corner would need 1 counter-<br>
clockwise turn on itself to be oriented), and how permutations work <br>
in terms of numbers (like, if your first number is a 6, this means <br>
the corner in position 6 is in position 1). Edge orientation... I do <br>
not yet know how to tell if it&#x27;s truly oriented or not (a 1 or a 0). <br>
Heeee, so hyper... sorry for this disorganized message.<br>
<br>
But yes, I would be curious as to how you number your corners and <br>
edges. That and the temporary-layer method are the only questions I <br>
have right now, unless I am missing something more<br>

Two programs that can help you search for move sequences are:

- CubeSolver (http://www.speedcubing.com/)
- ACube (http://cube.misto.cz/)

Also, check out:

- http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bhelmste/cube/ (look under &quot;permutation
  and orientation of corners&quot;)

Hi Austin.<br>
<br>
Great to have an edges first person doing such great times!  An average of <br>
24/25 is fantastic!  3 months is not long at all.  I am working (very <br>
unoriginally) on the Fridrich method and am trying to get my average under <br>
30 seconds.  I am slowly getting there, and am hovering around the 32/33 <br>
mark at the moment.<br>
<br>
Please, put your moves on the net.  Why not popst them here too?<br>
<br>
Could you map out your approach, plus times?<br>

<br>
How many algorithms does your system use?  Are there lots of slice moves?<br>

<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Welp - It took me a while, but I finished my edges first method.  I<br>
&gt;now have an average of 24.76 seconds...  YAY!  I hope to improve on<br>
&gt;this time soon, but alas we will see.  I hope to put this method on<br>
&gt;the net soon, and plan to give credit for the peeps that send me some<br>
&gt;links and stuff!  :D  thanks everyone.  (I only posted 1 message, but<br>
&gt;I have been working on the method for I think 3 months now... so it<br>
&gt;wasn&#x27;t just a 1 day thing  ;)  )<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello again.  This is just a quick overview of how my new method <br>
works for those who might want to know.  I am still in the proccess <br>
of editing some algs? (I still don&#x27;t know that word  :) )  and then I <br>
plan to post them here, and then get my website up and running!  <br>
Anyways... My new methos is placing the edges first, then moving the <br>
corners where you need them, and then flipping them.  The biggest <br>
problem with my method right now is it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of slice <br>
movement, but it does involve some flipping the whole cube around.  <br>
The advantages I&#x27;ve seen are I customized all of my moves for R,F, <br>
and U turns only, so that allows for a great deal of speed.  Here is <br>
the quick overview of my method - <br>
<br>
1. Make cross<br>
2. place M edges (2 Algs.)<br>
3. Make cross on bottom. (You really move the D side to U, but ya <br>
know. [4 Algs.])<br>
4. Move corners into place (1 now - I am in the proccess of finding 2 <br>
more to move all the needed corners at the same time, this will <br>
improve my speed a bit.)<br>
5. Twist corners (41 algs right now.  You use 1 of the 41 algs <br>
depending on the situation of your cube, and solve 4 corners with 1 <br>
alg.)<br>
<br>
Placing the edges is really quick, because the algs are so short, and <br>
can be executed so fast.  The hardest part of this method is the <br>
corners, both moving them and seeing the alg you need to execute very <br>
quickly.  I think  when I learn the method perfectly it will be a <br>
very effective method.  So don&#x27;t lost faith in edges first  ;)  And <br>
by all means, if you have any ways to improve upon it (faster <br>
edges/corners)  please tell me!  So untill next time!<br>

You&#x27;re shy a few here. If you had 65 algorithms in stage 5 you&#x27;d be 
OK.

You just work out what you need to do to get them in place for the 
algorithm. I generally figure out my entire solution as I am doing 
it.

Currently I&#x27;ve got the algorithms scattered all over the place. If I 
get time I am going to try to write them up properly.

The first two stages are the hardest in terms of number of 
algorithms to learn. That&#x27;s because I broke the rest of the solution 
into more stages so it isn&#x27;t quite as efficient. Obviously one stage 
is optimal but then you get a lot of algorithms.

I may try to put stages 5 and 6 on here some time. (It doesn&#x27;t 
matter which comes first so in some sense which is which is a matter 
of choice - similarly for stages 1 and 2.)

You can place the middle edges into the middle layer (whilst 
ensuring the pieces are all correctly oriented) in the group &lt;R, L, 
F2, B2, U, D>.
Whether that together with orienting all the pieces is all you need 
to be sure of before going to &lt;R2, L2, F2, B2, U, D> I don&#x27;t know.

Richard are you sure?  You need 65 if you restrict yourself to U/D corners, <br>
but you can rotate the cube and do the L/R and F/B corners instead.  <br>
Wouldn&#x27;t doing that, together with an U, U&#x27; or U2 move, cycle you out of <br>
needing all 65?<br>

My method will not require any U. U&#x27; or U2 moves in orienting the 
edges (although it is true you may have to rotate the cube as a 
whole). If conjugation is brought into it then you can get away with 
just 9 algorithms but the conjugation may be hard to work out.

you think, also on how you learn. Here is the link to the site i 
learned from. It is nice because you do not have to learn any 
notation.  Also this site will help you on that corner problem you 
were having.

Good luck,

P.S.  Let us know when you solve it.

  I just got the rubik&#x27;s cube for christmas.  I just started using it 
  like 3 days ago however.  I can solve one side in like 25 seconds 
  now.  However I can&#x27;t get the rest.  I want to know the EASIEST 
  method.  I saw Lars&#x27; method that is probably faster, at least it 
  seems it in theory, but is that easier and faster TO LEARN then the 
  layer by layer?  I&#x27;d just like to know what the easiest way to solve 
  it is.  Thank you in advance.

          <div class="email-content">You say that you can solve one side. A big mistake most peopel make 
when they say they solved &#x27;one side&#x27;, is that one side is a single 
color, but the edge pieces and corner pieces are in the wrong place. 
For example: When you solve one side, look at the sides of the pieces 
you have on that face. The colors should be together. Most people 
have the yellow-blue edge in the yellow-green place, or something. 
Hope I haven&#x27;t confused you *too* much.
Now, on to actually solving: I personally find that before you go 
searching for a solution to figure out, first try for a few months to 
solve it on your own. First of all, it&#x27;s more fun(in my humble 
opinion) and second of all, it will give you some considerable 
experience in handling the cube, and how the cubes move in relation 
to each other. After that, I would adviser Lars&#x27; method or Jessica&#x27;s, 
but to get really fast at Jessica&#x27;s method, you need to memorize 
something like fifty algorithms. I only know fifteen, and I can solve 
it in roughly 30 seconds. I&#x27;m going to learn quite a few more soon, 
though, hopefully cutting my times down by about 5-8 seconds.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I was sitting in class today supposed to be studying, when I <br>
figured it would be a good idea to make a list of goals for each <br>
step.  And I worte down some ways that I think I can achieve the <br>
goals.  I guess im gonna write em all on here so you guys can c <br>
them, and maybe give me a lil more insight on how to achieve them.  <br>
<br>
Goals:                                      total time:<br>
<br>
step 1- 2x2x2, in 2 seconds.                    2<br>
step 2- 2x2x3, in 5 seconds.                    7<br>
step 3- next corne/edge pair, in 3 seconds.     10<br>
step 4- last first layer edge, in 2 seconds.    12<br>
step 5- last corner/edge pair, 3 seconds.       15<br>
step 6- OLL, 3 seconds                          18<br>
step 7- PLL, 4 seconds                          22 seconds.<br>
<br>
status/ what needs done to make goals:<br>
<br>
step 1- pretty much there, maybe a little work on more accurate <br>
moves.<br>
     2- needs alot of work!  probably around 9 seconds for this step <br>
now.  NeEd help from club!<br>
     3- need to make a list of all possibilities and find solutions <br>
using Rons cube solver.  Then find easily recognized situations and <br>
learn those.  Also need to work on seeing all different corner/edge <br>
pairs I &#x27;could&#x27; use (3 possible).<br>
     4- easy.  maybe learn to combine steps 3 and 4.  Possibly use <br>
step 4 to help with step 5.<br>
     5- Learn ALL of Jessica&#x27;s F2L moves! (Only know/use a couple <br>
right now)<br>
     6- Close, need to re-learn the algs that I have forgotten! <br>
maybe learn slow situations so they are faster.<br>
     7- mostly there.  re-learn slow situations to become faster.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alright, I even put the steps in order of which I think I should <br>
work on first.  list goes by steps: 6,5,2,3,4,7,1<br>
<br>
What do you all think about those goals being realistic?  Oh, and <br>
all you who use the Fridrich method, when placing your last <br>
corner/edge pair, how long does that pair take you.  I have the <br>
exact same situation because I end up with a final corner/edge pair <br>
too, and wanted to know how fast I should be able to do it in.<br>
<br>
thanks for takin the time readin this, and It would be nice to get <br>
some feed back from you all.<br>

Sorry if this suggestion is very much old hat  :-)<br>
<br>
Have you experimented with the moves u and r?  &quot;U&quot; moves just the top layer, <br>
but &quot;u&quot; is moving the top layer plus the middle layer with it.  These moves <br>
are the equivilent to doing a L or D move plus a cube rotation.  (Similarly, <br>
I find the move &quot;d&quot; easier to execute than D with some algorithms.)  <br>
Incorporating these moves into your triggers means that sometimes you can <br>
utilise shorter algorithms while keeping the moves on your faster side.<br>

You csn solve one side in less than 25 seconds? That would qualify 
you for Toronto, except you need to slve the whole cube in that time.

There are people in this group who can do it, but I can&#x27;t. I can 
solve the whole cube, but in 5 minutes, not 25 seconds, alas!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Simon,

   Where did you get the notation? I&#x27;ve been using u, r and b for the
slices and Uu Rr and Bb for the side plus the slice.

   If you do corners first you need a lot of slice moves and the
single small case letter seems the simplest way. Am I making sense to you?

If you&#x27;re always doing step 5, 6 and 7 separately, you should work on 
learning more LL algorithms. Did you see these 
http://lar5.com/cube/yMain.html ? I only put them up a few weeks ago.

You should have the step 1 moves planned out when you start, and that 
should take less that 4 seconds, I imagine.

Have you measured how many moves you use, when solving slowly, 
focusing on few moves? Aim for 50 at least. I think I&#x27;m around 45. 
Skills you learn while doing that will transfer to fewer moves when 
solving for speed.

it usually takes less than four seconds, but sometimes it can take

So the steps 5+6 would be about 2-30 new algorithms to learn in all, 
right? I&#x27;ll probably learn those ones.
It usually takes me about 80 moves to finish. I also need to work on 
getting less moves. Not as bad as a friend of mine, who takes about 
130 moves to solve it!

          <div class="email-content">I just figured out that I sort of do steps 5 and 6 at the same time. 
I was looking at your page, and the algorithms for those are kind of 
like the permutation algs and orientation ones put together, right? 
For example: the algorithm F T&#x27; B&#x27; T F&#x27; T&#x27; B L&#x27; T&#x27; L T&#x27; L&#x27; T2 L is a 
combination of the sequence to switch the two corners at the back 
side of the cube(F T&#x27; B&#x27; T F&#x27; T&#x27; B), and the one to orient the 
corners(L&#x27; T&#x27; L T&#x27; L&#x27; T2 L). That&#x27;s basically what I do, so should I 
try to combine step 6+7 in one algorithm?

          <div class="email-content">Hi James,

   You gave three sequences. Two are the basic two for last level corners:
F T&#x27; B&#x27; T F&#x27; T&#x27; B,  7 move sequence which changes the relative
positions of corners, basically swapping two adjacent corners, though
it rotates them; and
L&#x27; T&#x27; L T&#x27; L&#x27; T2 L  7 move sequence which rotates those corners.

In combining them to make F T&#x27; B&#x27; T F&#x27; T&#x27; B L&#x27; T&#x27; L T&#x27; L&#x27; T2 L 
you using the same number of moves.

In the following I use U for Upper instead of T for Top.

I recommend that you use combos that use fewer moves. For example: Try
this corner swapping sequence L&#x27; U R U&#x27;L U R&#x27; then rotating sequence R
U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;. These are the same as yours, but different facing.

And you&#x27;ll see that two adjacent corners and edges have swapped
without rotating in 14 moves.

Then solve them with eleven moves:
R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L

If you can trade regularly something like 14 moves for 11, you should
seen a quicker solve.

   In this case I saw that there were moves in common and linked them
but there are lots fewer move combos out there. I don&#x27;t have a full
set yet, but I&#x27;m working on it.

   Good Luck,

   David J

It&#x27;s 25 if you want to learn all the perfect ones. The 8 I gave names 
are the most important.

Wow! Sounds like you have the speed, and just need to use fewer 
moves. If you use  60 instead of 80, and twist at the same speed, 
you&#x27;ll be at 23 instead of 32 seconds. And I think that&#x27;s perfectly 
doable.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s fairly easy to get the F2L without help, but the problem is the 
LL. Orienting isn&#x27;t tooo bad, but permuting edges without messing up 
what you just did is difficult. I solve it after a few weeks when I 
was eleven(amazingly good for that age, though I think it was a lucky 
case LOL).

Of course not, give me 4 more seconds for recognition, and you&#x27;ll
understand why I was faster with my 65 moves solution :-)

Especially if I need to (R2(UE&#x27;))(R&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;R(U&#x27;E)R2)y&#x27;(R&#x27;UR) !!!

You can also use <br>

If I can count properly, there are 8! * 3^7 / 2 = 44089920 different
configurations of the corners if the edges are already in place. But
since many of those positions look the same after rotations and
reflections, the number of algorithms you need to learn is less (but I
think still in the millions, I&#x27;m not sure how to easily figure this
number out).

You could probably make improvements to the edges too. How many moves is
it currently taking you?

          <div class="email-content">I notice that there are reports of two cube clubs, one at UCI, the <br>
other at Putdue. I welcome this trend and wish  that there are more <br>
cube clubs at universities around the world. It sems that the ability <br>
to solve the Rubik&#x27;s cube is tather unique, very few people can do <br>
it. Look around. See how many of your friends and neigbors csan do it.<br>
Since this club is comprised mostly of those who can solve the cube <br>
very fast, let us categorize the cubers based on speed:<br>
CATEGORY 1 includes those who can solve the whole cube in less than <br>
or equal to 30 seconds. Those folks should consider competing in <br>
Toronto.<br>
CATEGORY 2 includes those who can solve the cube anywhere between 31 <br>
seconds and a minute, inclusive. Those are still very fast. With some <br>
practise you can go to Toronto, but you need improvement.<br>
CATEGORY 3 includes those who can solve the cube  anyehere between 61 <br>
seconds and three minutes. They are still pretty good, but they are <br>
not a Toronto material. Just be happy you are still not too slow.<br>
CATEGORY 4 includes those who can solve the cube in more than 3 <br>
minutes. If it is any consolation to them, they can still solve the <br>
cube. But they should not dream aof going to Toronto as speedcubists.<br>
I belong to CATEGORY 4, and I plan going to Toronto. Not as a <br>
speedcubist, of course. I plan to exhibit 3 dimensional cube art. <br>
Please see http://cube.misto.cz and tell me if you know of anyone who <br>
can do this. If we had cube clubs, I could email each of the club <br>
contacts, sending them this website and asking this question. Justin <br>
Winning of the Purdue cube club already said that he knows nobody. <br>
How about the people in the UCI cube club? Do you know anybody?<br>
Hana a kostky<br>
PS For those who want to know, my cubing time is a disgusting 5-10 <br>
minutes. Pretty awful. huh?<br>

It depends what you permute first. One way to do it is to solve all 
the corner positions (or edge positions) except possibly 2. Then, if 
you need to you can switch those and switch 2 edges (or corners) and 
start on the rest from there.
i.e. put the switching stage in between. Then you don&#x27;t have to 
juggle to lots of permutations at the same time.

How many cubes you have? 15? Well, then you can create a &quot;picture&quot; or 
2-dimensional design by putting then one next to the other in a 5x3 
array. You construct a pattern on each cube and stack them together 
to create a picture. If you want to go 3 dimensional, or &quot;sculpture&quot; 
like I do, then consider a 2x2x3 rectangular solid. Make sure your 
design matches properly on all six sides. You have to have parity 
pairs in th corners, if you  want reflection-invariance. Those things 
are explained in http://cube.misto.cz . Frankly, I consider pictures 
too easy. Sculptures aredeliciously difficult.
Do you know of anyone who creates 3 dimensional desogns?

PS I have about 780 cubes and that is not enough. I cannot do third 
iteration of the Menger Sponge, which requires 729 cubes. :-(

You cannot do anything with five cubes. You need a minimum 8 cubes 
fot a very uninteresting 3 dimensional design. Better stick to 
speedcubing.

There are no members at the UCI club who do this, but I would love to 
try it, if I had enough cubes.  I have the biggest collection in the 
club and I have 6 regular 3x3x3.  Not near enough to do anything 
interesting like what you do.

Not having enough cubes is a great stumbling block to doing cube art, 
even for those who can do it. You are right, 6 cubes is woefully 
inadequate to doing anything. What I suggest is rhat you get together 
with your friends and see how many cubes you all get. The optimum 
number is 27, the minimum is 8 (for a 3 dimensional design, that is). 
For 27 cubes you can do a 3x3x3 cubical design, and some smaller non-
cubical designs. There are a couple of designs made from 21 cubes in 
http://cube.misto.cz .

Having more that 27 cubes is better, of course.

Thanks, I will contact them. I hope they speak English, because I 
don&#x27;t  speak Swedish. The only other language besides English that I

          <div class="email-content">&gt;&gt;Hi Simon,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    Where did you get the notation? I&#x27;ve been using u, r and b for the<br>
&gt;slices and Uu Rr and Bb for the side plus the slice.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Hi David.  Yes, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any real consensus on this, so I <br>
see various things.  I use single lower case letters, as do some other <br>
people.  (For example, see &quot;Advanced tricks for F2L: A contribution by Dave <br>
Orser&quot;, as speedcubing.com).  Because of this, maybe the clearest <br>
nomenclature is to just put both moves in brackets, so (RM&#x27;).  In the 4x4x4 <br>
the lower case letter is used for the inside slice, and the double for both, <br>
so maybe that form (which is what you suggest) is superior and will one day <br>
become the standard.  Because there is no real standard, maybe the clearest <br>
nomenclature is to just put both moves in brackets, so (E&#x27;D&#x27;).  But a single <br>
lower case letter is good enough for lazy people like me.<br>
S.<br>
<br>
PS: Dave (and Ron): thanks for putting up those f2l tricks!  I have worked <br>
through most of them, a few I already do, having picked them up from the <br>
chat room.  Some don&#x27;t feel right for me, but a couple are absolutely fab!<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Have you experimented with the moves u and r?  &quot;U&quot; moves just the<br>
&gt;top layer,<br>
&gt; &gt; but &quot;u&quot; is moving the top layer plus the middle layer with it.<br>
&gt;These moves<br>
&gt; &gt; are the equivilent to doing a L or D move plus a cube rotation.<br>
&gt;(Similarly,<br>
&gt; &gt; I find the move &quot;d&quot; easier to execute than D with some algorithms.)<br>
&gt; &gt; Incorporating these moves into your triggers means that sometimes<br>
&gt;you can<br>
&gt; &gt; utilise shorter algorithms while keeping the moves on your faster side.<br>

Hi kyuubree,

   All the sequences, which many people call algorithms, that I use I
have found on my own. I first solved the cube in 1981.

   All of the people that I know who believed that they could solve
the cube did. The people who thought that they couldn&#x27;t solve it,
pretty much, didn&#x27;t.
   Solving it that quickly points to an ability to get to the bone of
the matter which should serve you well in the coming years.

   Unfortunately, your friend is typical. Believing in others, and
giving them credit when they do something that isn&#x27;t *considered*
likely, is all to rare. 
 
   If you cannot get your friend to believe, you don&#x27;t get
discouraged. Though fairly rare, what you did is normal. Many more
could do it if they tried. As long as you believe in yourself that is
what is important; what others think can&#x27;t change that.

   Regards,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve started cubing a little over month ago and have learned the F2L <br>
algorithms with for a &quot;by layers&quot; method with the cross on top.  <br>
(From Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s site)  However, I&#x27;m presented with the <br>
problems of seeing the pieces fast enough since the LL pieces are on <br>
the bottom.<br>
<br>
I recently looked at speedcubing.com and saw a number of &quot;cross in <br>
the left hand&quot; algorithms that would allow for a little for &quot;looking <br>
ahead.&quot;  As I recall, Jesse Bonde and Jessica both keep the cross in <br>
their left hand.  When I started learning these algorithms, it struck <br>
me immediately that I had no clue how to go about applying finger <br>
tricks.<br>
<br>
After looking at Jesse Bonde&#x27;s videos of him solving the cuhe.  I <br>
noticed that he never used anything but the R and U faces.  (perhaps <br>
I just didn&#x27;t see other moves because he was twisting so quickly).  <br>
However, in the list of left-handed algs, there are many algs that <br>
utilize F, B, D, and even L faces many times.  I realized that you <br>
are supposed to minimize the number of times you turn the whole <br>
cube.  But, I don&#x27;t know how apply finger tricks without turning the <br>
cube!<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any hints on on how I should go about learning <br>
a &quot;cross-in-left-hand&quot; by-layers system for F2L?  Are there any sites <br>
that explain the finger tricks used in this sytem?  <br>

I had trouble posting it, because there was not enough room in the 
file section.  So I will post it at the Cubic-Puzzles Yahoo group 
site.  Here is the Address for the file section of that group.  
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cubic-puzzles/files/
You all must hear that song.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Austin.  Glad to hear that you are rising above yesterday&#x27;s tragic turn 
of events.

To orient and permute 8 corners at once would be quite something; are you 
maybe anticipating some sort of system where you ...
1. correct all edges (9 seconds?)
2. orient or permute 8 corners
3. then permute or orient (whatever you did not do before) 8 corners
... ?

It is just that for speed, you might possibly find it easier to cut down on 
recognition time if you did not need to look at all 8 corners to determine 
your next algorithm.  For example, in the following scenario you never need 
to look at more than one side at a time to get corners all correct.

1. correct all edges (9 seconds?)
2. get corners into two correct opposite faces (only a few moves, 2 
seconds?); preparing you to ...
3. orient and permute 4 corners on one face (42 algorithms, not sure what 
average number of moves but probably 8 or less, 3 seconds?)
4. orient and permute 4 corners on opposite face (average number of moves 
11.73, 4 seconds?)

That gives you a possible 18 seconds.  To orient and permute 4 corners in 
one look without disturning any other cubies (step 4) requires learning 42 
algorithms; here is one page with them on:
http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bhelmste/cube/solutions_c2.html
You could use CubeSolver (or your own brain) for step 3, although you could 
of course use the step 4 algorithsm at first.

Cutting down further would be harder, some ideas are:
* combine step 2 with the last parts of step 1
* leave your middle edges to the end (??)
* execute step 3 with the corners on the bottom: then you would be able to 
start working out which algorithm to use for step 4 while finishing off step 
3 (but presumably quite a few D moves in that)

Looking forward to hearing what you decide to do, probably something totally 
different!  Whatever you do, post the moves here and then no-one can destroy 
them! (apart from Yahoo!, which they have done in the past ...)
S.

If step 2 results in two even permutations, then there are 42<br>
possibilities for each one. But step 2 can also result in two odd<br>

Thanks man!  That helped alot.  Yes, posting all of my moves on the website will be a good idea!  I like the idea of just doing 4 corners at a time, I might have to work on that a little more.  The only reason I wanted to try and do all the corners at the same time was for a massive boost of speed.  But wel will see, maybe that will come about 1 day!  Memorizing algs for me is not too much of a problem, but alas, I would like to be able to share this method with everyone, and not everyone can memorize so many algs.  So I am going to try and keep it basic!  there are 6 different combinations of U and D corners being mixed up (I.E. 3 U corners on the U face, and 1 U corner on the D face.  This might not make any sence now, but you&#x27;ll understand when I get my website up  :) )so I think I can finish the method with under 60 algs if I use the 40 some odd Simonl game me!  I also am trying to figure out some ways to improve my cross speed, because that is where about half of my 9 seconds are in placing edges!  AKK!  But we will see, eh?  Hope to post it soon!<br>

If I&#x27;m not mistaken, you&#x27;ll need to learn millions of algorithms to do<br>
the corners in one step. See my post 2696:<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/2696<br>
<br>
If you don&#x27;t want to learn more than 100 algorithms you&#x27;re going to need<br>
at least 3 steps. I think a 2 step solution is possible if you have a<br>
large memory. Try orienting all 8 corners first - 60 algorithms.<br>

I would be interested in buying the original CD this song is on, but 
I need the name of the CD and the manufacturer. Is it available on 
amazon.com?

No sound here so there&#x27;s little point me checking it out but the 
only song I ever heard about the cube (so perhaps it is this one) is 
a song by the Baron Knights.

It had lyrics like &quot;is your cube from out of space?&quot; and &quot;got three 
sides and lost his place&quot; and had stuff about trying to twist his 
wife like a cube in his sleep. Any case the narrator had (in the 
song) gone insane and died and was singing it afterwards. Is this 
the same song?

My brother had it on record years and years ago (probably still 
does). There was a song about the smurfs in prison too.

I spent a long time looking for it on the internet and found the CD.  
http://www.artistdirect.com/store/artist/album/0,,243099,00.html  
also there is  a preview of the CD here.  
http://www.artistdirect.com/store/artist/album/full/0,,688686,00.html

Click on the little sound thing, and then it plays 30s of each song.

And they do have it at Amazon.com  at 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-
/B000003R1I/qid=1043180282/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-9003315-1112057?
v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846
there too is a sample of the song.

On www.rubiks.com there&#x27;s an edges first method, but it&#x27;s reeaally 
slow. Might help you, though.

There is a empty cathegory for edges-first still under construction. Actually I think edges-first have been under construction for as long as I remember (several months).

I was so close to go sub-40 for the first time last night. Got a non-lucky 40,09 and an avg of 45,xx (my number memory sucks).

I know this site, it is made by Josef Jelinek of the Czech Republic. 
His contact is in the site, so contact him.

Did you see my designs there? He allowed me to put the designs on 
his  site. I also  know he has some incompletes there. Tewll him, if 
he completes the site, I will trsnslate his Czech  version into 
English, like I did before. This should be done before Toronto.

Hi Brent,

There are a few Pyraminx on ebay at the moment, and there are usually
one or two listed at any time.

          <div class="email-content">Once you have learnt the basic ones on Jessica&#x27;s page you should expect to 
pretty soon be able to solve f2l in about 20-30 seconds.  With a bit more 
practise and no new algoriths I suppose you could go down to 15 seconds or 
so.  But I recommend that pretty soon after learning the ones that do not 
affect the other three corner/edge slots you start looking at some of the 
shortcuts associated with any fast f2l.  A good place to start is:
http://www.oinkleburger.com/cube/f2l/.
This page gives you algorithms that take advantage of free slots, so that 
you can use faster, shorter moves.  Trust me, once you have the basic set 
under your fingers, the short cuts will feel very familiar very quickly.

Pretty much everyone says that to do a fast f2l you need to concentrate on 
not stopping, rather than doing moves as fast as possible, and that this 
means a sort of contradictory learning step of &quot;going slow&quot;.  When I have 
asked people about how to get my own f2l faster that is what they have 
suggested, so maybe that advice would be a help to you, too?

whatever you do, good luck with it, and keep us posted on your progress!  I 
am currently learning all the oll algorithms (just passed the halfway mark 
last night!!).

Put the face which has two unsolved edges on top. 

Here is hint.
Suppose you are solving just the top face. 
You have to move one edge out and then you solve the piece. 
You might mess up the bottom two layers.
DON&#x27;T WORRY. 
If you do reverse procedure, you can fix the messed up bottoms and 
again flip the top edge. 

This is the way to solve. 

Solve (flip) one edge as if you solve one face. 
Then move the rest of edge to the place you just solved. 
Then you solve (flip) it in the reverse way. You will be there. 

If you can use middle layer efficiently, the fewest moves is 12.

I think you had better to think a little bit.

instead of looking and bidding on ebay you can buy a pyraminx off of 
www.mefferts.com cost is about 16 bucks and on the f2l thing learning 
the 41 algs is a good thing but a more important thing is to learn 
how the f2l actually works and only use the algs when you have no 
free space to work with... and the biggest thing about f2l is don&#x27;t 
go at full speed work them  corner/edge pairs while looking for the 
next... once you get that down you can easily do f2l&#x27;s in under 15 
seconds

I do not know.

I use White opposite Yellow Red opposite orange, and blue opposite 
green.  I feel there is a sort of symmetry to it.

Well I own a Meffert&#x27;s Professor Cube, and i really enjoy playing 
with it.  The biggest problem with it is the tiles fall off!!!!  Also 
many people will point out that the center-corners will twist.  But I 
think it is wonderful.  Someone brought a Rubik&#x27;s 5x5x5 at my Rubik&#x27;s 
cube club at UCI, and I didn&#x27;t like it as much.  It was much stiffer, 
and felt like it was about to break. Mine seemed much better, and if 
I were to buy one I would get Meffert&#x27;s.  How do others feel about 
Meffert&#x27;s-Rubik&#x27;s 5x5x5?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brent,

   I don&#x27;t know what the original color scheme was. In the prototype
photos online I can see that red and yellow are next to each other,
but the photos aren&#x27;t clear enough to make out other relationships.

   In the USA the cubes made under liscense to Rubik were Blue
opposite White, Red opposite Orange, and Green opposite Yellow.
Looking at one corner of the cube you would have the primary colors,
Red - Yellow - Blue, in order clockwise.

   This was the prefered color scheme, as all of the regular Deluxe
cubes, which have plastic tiles instead of stickers, and all of the
Deluxe cubes found in Rubik&#x27;s Game, have it.

   This was in the 1980&#x27;s and there are many millions of cubes out
there with this pattern.

   This is the color pattern that I work with.

  The new cubes have blue next to white, but I don&#x27;t know why the
switch was made.

  Perhaps those who were in Europe in the 1980&#x27;s can tell you what the
color scheme was in use there and then.

          <div class="email-content">As a cube artist and a 3 dimensional designer, I have to consider <br>
color and color scheme very carefully.. There are two basic color <br>
schenes on the cybe today:<br>
1. the so-called plus yellow scheme which consists of the primary <br>
colors. The opposites are formed by adding yellow. So the opposite of <br>
white is white+yellow=yellow, opposite of red is red+yellow=orange, <br>
and the opposite of blue is blue+yellow=green. Apparently this was <br>
the original scheme used by Rubik, and it is also the scheme used by <br>
SevenTowns that own the Rubik trademark.<br>
2. the other color scheme is the scheme of colors of highest <br>
cintrast. In this scheme blue is opposite to white, ref is opposite <br>
to orange and green is opposite to yellow. This scheme was prevalent <br>
in the USA.<br>
In doing my art I have to consider both opposite and adjacent colors. <br>
I always have 2 or 1 one color on popposite faces. I may want to have <br>
two colrs on all four adjacent faces, so the design has four colors <br>
overall. Don&#x27;t worry, I dn&#x27;t cheat. :-) All my designs are made from <br>
conventional six-color cubes, but the other two colors are supressed <br>
due to parity pairs. You can even have a desin that has 3 colors, see <br>
Vasarely in my profile. So color is a big issue at this end of the <br>
woods.<br>

Lots of people can break 1 minute 50 seconds. You should probably 
use a centres first method, then pair the edges. After that it&#x27;s 
very similar to sovling a normal cube modulo a few details.

          <div class="email-content">The way I do it is I get the centers together, then I get the edges 
together, then I solve it like a normal cube. It&#x27;s actually easier 
than you think, the only problem is pairing up the edges without 
messing up the centers. Also when you&#x27;re on the LL when it&#x27;s like a 
3x3x3, sometimes only one edge pair is incorrectly oriented, or the 
edges are permuted impossibly for a normal 3x3x3 cube. That&#x27;s the 
only problem I have.

First you need to join the edges and then you can solve as a 3x3x3.

To join an edge you&#x27;ll want to do something like this.
Select an edge in the middle layer. In general it&#x27;ll look like this

X
Y
Z

(sometimes X or Z might be the same (type as X)).

If at least one of X or Z is not Y then you can bring a Y into an 
adjacent spot in the middle layer.

e.g.

V    X
W    Y
Y    Z

Slice the Y&#x27;s together (you might want to be sure that the Y is 
correctly positioned to match up first - it may want to be on top).

Then take out the edge

X
Y
Y

and put it in upside down.

(e.g. using R&#x27;D&#x27;RDFD&#x27;F&#x27;)

Then slice the middle layer back.

(Actually, this is a good way to do the last 4 edges but there are 
better ways of doing the first 8.)

You might end up with an edge 

Y
Y
Y

where the outer Ys are in the wrong place.

You can correct them with the analagous move from the 4x4x4.

You could try going to oinkleburger and stepping through some of the 
solutions there.

So yesterday I told myself I was going to work on these algs until I 
knew them.  So I worked for like 3 hours.  I memorized all 8 algs, 
and their reflections, but I just could not for the life of me 
remember which alg went with what case.  So I got really discouraged, 
and sent the above message.  This morning I woke up, went to class 
came back and started working on them again.  What happened was 
really weird; All of a sudden I just started doing it.  I think that 
a good nights rest really helped me.  So I am really excited, I think 
my times will drop very soon, I feel I have been stuck at 25 sec 
average forever, and will hopefully be submitting quicker times 
soon.

i would think of this as being the same way i learned my f2l.. i <br>
tried 3 times to learn it but on the third time it clicked to me what <br>
was going on and i dropped the f2l algs and used intuition... i have <br>
also spent the time to compare mine the the algs shown and i see the <br>
3/4 of the sequences i use are exactly the same and the other 1/4 are <br>
actually a move or 2 faster... just keep practicing and instead of <br>
learning the algs try to use them to see how they really work<br>

---------------------

Well, when im memorizing algs for Cubes, like 3 a day sometimes, i get them loaded into my brain, and go to sleep.  Maybe not for other people, but I do this alot, (matter of fact, i just did today, a nap of 2 hours), and it helps me mega time.  also, when im laying in bed before i fall asleep at night, i picture some scenarios of the Cube in my brain, and review some sequences and algs in my mind.  This helps alot, and the next time i pick up a cube, the less i have to practice on it.  This may seem rediculous, but for me, it helps ALOT.!  :)

Cube artists have it much easier. All they have to do is master two  
things: parity-pair induced design symmetry and judicious twiddling. 
They have to be able  to solve the cube, but not very fast. Oh, and 
they should know some math, such as group theory.
And that&#x27;s about all. You need to memorize very lirrle, thuings sust

          <div class="email-content">It takes tons of practice to get it down to a &quot;reflex&quot; like someone 
else said.  Its better to understand the F2L algs you use rather 
than just memorizing the alg.  After you get alot of practice witht 
the algs you wont have to think about what alg to use, your hands 
will just do the alg...:D...Then you dont have to focus on moves for 
the alg and you can &quot;look ahead&quot; to find your next pieces you need.  
Looking ahead is what really speeds up the F2L.

If I recall you do both corners first method, and Fridrich method, 
quite well right?  If so, which one do you do faster, and like 
better?  What did you start with, and was it hard to convert, from 
one to the other?

          <div class="email-content">I agree with the others who replied to your message.  The key to <br>
speeding up F2L is to move all your algorithms to your subconscious <br>
mind.  For example, when you are typing, do you really think about <br>
which keys you are pressing?  Probably not if you have been typing <br>
for a while.  The keystrokes for typing have been moved to you <br>
subconscious mind.  This allows you to think about what you want to <br>
say rather than what keys to press.  However, like any learning <br>
process, it always helps to move slowly as first.  Then, as you <br>
practice the moves, they will begin to pop into your head faster and <br>
faster.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, our brains recognize groups of items rather than single <br>
items.  For this reason, we group phone numbers in strings of 2, 3, <br>
or 4 numbers rather than a single line.  For example 888-123-4567.  <br>
For it reason, it is easier to memorize finger tricks and macros when <br>
doing any move sequence.  For example, RB&#x27;R&#x27;BFR&#x27;FB&#x27;R&#x27;BRF2U turns into <br>
(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)(FR&#x27;FB&#x27;)(R&#x27;BR)(F2U).  The added bennefit of macros is that <br>
they can be accomplished insanely fast because they fit the fingers <br>
well.  <br>

Same here if I right clicked on it and saved target as, then it would 
stop at around 1.8 mb, then if I canceled and right clicked and saved 
target again, it would pick up the downloading at 1.8 mb.  See if 
that works for you.

          <div class="email-content">If you can do the 3x3x3 and the 4x4x4, then you&#x27;ll be able to do the 
5x5x5 -- it&#x27;ll just take longer!! All you need is to be a bit 
intuitive about how to adapt/apply 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 algs to the 5x5x5.

I group the 5x5x5 edges in pretty much the same way as I pair the 
4x4x4 edges, ie. match two up in the middle rows and then slot them 
into either the top or bottom layer (see Chris H&#x27;s Revenge solution 
on www.speedcubing.com for details). It&#x27;s just more time consuming 
and complicated when grouping the 5x5x5 edges because there are so 
many more of them!

I&#x27;m sure there is a faster way to do it, but if (like me) your 
initial aim is just to be able to solve the 5x5x5, then this method 
is pretty good because it doesn&#x27;t involve learning any new algs.

Also I usually take too long making the cross at the beginning.

If a speedcubist could average, let&#x27;s say, 20 seconds, i as wondering how much SLOWER a cubist would average if he/she didn&#x27;t use most of the finger tricks, and just turned the sides with his/her hand.  also, im getting better at the F2l a little, but i guess  PRACTICE is the key.  also, are there just 41 (or 42, can&#x27;t remember) for the F2L to memorize? &lt;speedcubing.com>  or are there more?
ALSO, does ANYONE know of any EXCELLENT sites for the 5x5x5 Professor Cube?  if anyone does know how to solve the pro cube, how fast would it take you?  
One more question-  What IS recommended for the position of having the cross?  (i.e. like on top, left side, right side, bottom...)  just wondering..

There are more, but once you have underwstood those 41 the rest will be 
easier to incorporate into your moves.  Go here: I think this is the best 
single site on f2L:
http://www.oinkleburger.com/cube/f2l/.
The site explains itself, really.  To see these sorts of moves in action, so 
to speak, visit here:
http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/examples.html
and also go here:
http://www.speedcubing.com/
and follow the links &quot;Tools and other stuff&quot;, then &quot;Cube stuff&quot;, then the 
link &quot;Cube solving examples&quot;.

And like everyone is saying, PRACTICE!  Just because some people can do it 
in 20 seconds does not mean it is easy ...

Most people with a fast f2l have the cross either on the bottom or to the 
left / right, and some do bits of both.  Some fast cubists very strongly 
favour one hand above the other, but others seem to share the work more 
evenly between both hands.  I think if you practice your moves using finger 
tricks from the start, your hands will naturally prefer some sorts of moves 
to others, and you should trust that &quot;feel&quot; to some degree.  So try and find 
your own road, so to speak, because with this kind of thing what will work 
well for one person might not be best for someone else, and to get really 
fast times it is important to do what suits you!
Best wishes with getting your f2l times down!

I don&#x27;t know that I would point to any one as the best (until I make <br>
one myself :-P  ), but when I was learning, I went to <br>
http://www.rubiks.com/cubesolutionother.html and found some of the <br>
solutions listed there that attacked the 5x5x5.  I think I remember <br>
Philip Marshall&#x27;s approach ( <br>
http://www.olympus.net/personal/prmhem/profcube.htm ) as being one of <br>
the better ones, though.  Also I know that Chris Hardwick&#x27;s site ( <br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/index.html ) has some great algs, <br>
too (perhaps in a revenge solution, but they apply to the professor, <br>
as well).<br>
<br>
&gt; if anyone does know how to solve the pro cube, how fast would it<br>
&gt; take you?  <br>
Well, my typical average for the 3x3x3 is just over 30 seconds.  The <br>
last average I took on the 4x4x4 was about 2:26, and I haven&#x27;t done <br>
an average for the 5x5x5.  My times range, though, from as low as a <br>
lucky case just under 4 minutes to a more typical 4:20, and as high <br>
as a few bad cases around 5:30.  Most of the time, though, I&#x27;m <br>
between 4:10 and 4:30 on the 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
&gt; One more question-  What IS recommended for the position of having<br>
&gt; the cross?  (i.e. like on top, left side, right side, bottom...)<br>
&gt; just wondering..<br>
I would say the recommended position for the cross is wherever you <br>
can do it best, between the two options of left or bottom (or I <br>
suppose right, if you are left hand dominant in your cubing).  <br>
Looking ahead is just too difficult with the cross on top, but <br>
between the others, it is more a matter of how you handle the cube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Simon,<br>
<br>
&gt; Hi David.  Yes, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any real consensus on this,<br>
so I see various things.  I use single lower case letters, as do some<br>
other people.  (For example, see &quot;Advanced tricks for F2L: A<br>
contribution by Dave Orser&quot;, as speedcubing.com).  Because of this,<br>
maybe the clearest nomenclature is to just put both moves in brackets,<br>
so (RM&#x27;).  In the 4x4x4 the lower case letter is used for the inside<br>
slice, and the double for both, so maybe that form (which is what you<br>
suggest) is superior and will one day become the standard. &gt;<br>
<br>
   I&#x27;m not sure that one standard is needed, as long as we know what<br>
each other means. It would simplify things for people just getting<br>
into it, though. <br>
<br>
&gt;  Because there is no real standard, maybe the clearest <br>
&gt; nomenclature is to just put both moves in brackets, so (E&#x27;D&#x27;).<br>
<br>
   I thought that brackets were being used to denote finger tricks<br>
like (R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2) L&#x27; (U R&#x27;U&#x27; L) Where you only have to reposition<br>
the left hand once.<br>
<br>
&gt; But a single <br>
&gt; lower case letter is good enough for lazy people like me.<br>
&gt; S.<br>
<br>
   Pretty much I like the one letter system. Double letters might be<br>
useful for finger trick notation, where you specify rotating the cube,<br>
though rotating the cube is for visualization and handling the cube<br>
separae from denoting a sequence. I thought that to simplify whole<br>
cube rotations we might use QR, QU and QB. Q for cube, of course. :)<br>
<br>
   Sometimes two letters is evocative.<br>

          <div class="email-content">hey everyone, i havent been posting for a while but now im back.... i <br>
have only been cubing for approximately 4 months and i average at 44 <br>
seconds. this seems pretty good to me... but of course i want to go <br>
faster.... what steps would you reccomend for me to drop into the <br>
30&#x27;s? i get an occasional 39 (that isnt really lucky but a move comes <br>
up that im good at so i am able to do it more quickly) but getting to <br>
low thirties sounds near impossible. i know all of the f2l moves, but <br>
i think what im seeing when i watch videos is that people can do the <br>
f2l moves from all angles so they can do it any way it comes up.... <br>
perhaps this is the key because i move the pieces to the place i want <br>
them then execute the move to put them in place. and about the last <br>
layer.... i know just about all the permutations with a few as the <br>
exception. i know about ten orientations and that works because i <br>
just do a move to get the cross on the bottom and then other shapes <br>
emerge from there. so what should i do to get into the mid to low <br>
30&#x27;s? any help would be appreciated<br>

Even though I&#x27;m not really an edges first person, there are some
similarities between this approach and my own. I had a go at edges first
and found that I could solve them in around 15 to 20 moves. I don&#x27;t use
any algorithms, but I always consider 3 edges on each move (and 4 towards
the end)

Anyway, I have a suggestion for you. You might find it more efficient to
solve only the top and bottom edges as your first step and leave the
middle layer edges out of the picture until after you&#x27;ve solved the
corners. That is because it is difficult to move corners around without
also messing up some of the edges. If you are able to mess up the middle
edges while solving the corners, then you should find that the average
algorithm length will drop. As a starter, the shortest such algorithm is
4 moves (L2F2L2F2).

Hi Heath,

   You can actually get in the range of 30 secs using only four
sequences (what you call algs) for LL.

          <div class="email-content">I was wondering if any one has been in a talent show with their cube?<br>
<br>
I was wondering because at my school every year they have an <br>
Engineering Talent Show, for engineering students, with cash prizes, <br>
and I entered to do the cube.  I just am not sure how people will <br>
respond to me doing the cube, compared to maybe a very good singing <br>
group.  <br>
<br>
Also I do not know how to start the act. I was thinking on saying &quot;Hi <br>
my name is Kenneth and I am going to attempt to break the Official <br>
world record for solving the Rubik&#x27;s cube, in under 23 seconds,&quot; then <br>
ask for a volunteer to scramble my cube, and solve it.  But what if I <br>
don&#x27;t solve it less than 23 seconds, should I solve it more than <br>
once? Maybe I should not say anything about the world record just in <br>
case I suck in front of an audience, and then at the end if I happen <br>
to solve it quick enough say something like by the way the world <br>
record for solving the Rubik&#x27;s cube is . . .?<br>
<br>
Another idea I had was to come on stage with three juggling pins, <br>
start juggling and then drop all the pins on the floor after about <br>
ten seconds, and say, &quot;well good thing that is not my talent&quot; and <br>
then take the cube out of my pocket.   Or come on stage and say &quot;Hi <br>
my name is Kenneth and my talent is to belch the entire alphabet&quot; <br>
then say just kidding and take the cube out of my pocket.  <br>

cash prizes...cool
hehe
I like your ideas about the juggling thing and the burping the 
alphabet things...those should get some laughs.  You could start out 
with one of those, then have someone come up and mix up your cube.  
Tell what the world record is, I wouldnt say you were going to break 
the record tho.  Then have the person who mixed it up...or maybe 
another person from the crowd time you.  And if you beat the record 
then say something about it.  If your a lil slower than the record 
then say you were pretty damn close to the record. :D

          <div class="email-content">At my high school we had this thing called Koffehaus which was 
basically on open mic night where you could perform any weird talent 
or cool thing or read a poem or sing in a band, whatever.  Anyway I 
did the cube for that a couple of times and you HAVE to make it a 
theatrical thing.  You get so used to doing the cube and especially 
seeing it solved that, to you, it loses some of that newness and 
magic or whatever.  I would go up to the mic and say &quot;Hi, my name is 
Chris Hardwick and I am going to attempt to solve a rubik&#x27;s cube *get 
real close to the mic and say in a deeper voice* in UNDER 30 SECONDS&quot; 
and people always go &quot;yeah right!&quot; etc. etc.  I always said thirty 
seconds because to me solving the cube in 20 seconds and solving it 
in 30 seconds are two VERY different times, but to most people they 
aren&#x27;t at all.  You can do it in under 5 minutes, that&#x27;s amazing in 
and of itself.  Anyway you have to move a lot, act like you&#x27;re 
looking for pieces and stuff.  I always got a better reaction when I 
did a lot of movement, especially when I did it for a large crowd.  
Also make sure to hold the cube at mid to high chest level if the 
audience is at the same level you&#x27;re at (hold it normal if you&#x27;re on 
a stage).

The biggest reaction I ever got, is one time when I was on the 
orientation alg (2 look last layer), I saw what the permutation was 
going to be and I looked up, told the audience I was going to finish 
it without looking and held it over my head and looked down at the 
floor as I triggered the permutation alg.  They went absolute NUTS 
over that.

Just remember one thing, most people have not seen a solved cube EVER 
or maybe only once or twice, so it&#x27;s got this mystical quality to say 
you&#x27;re going to solve it that fast.  Be a ham about it, make sure to 
really present the cube once it&#x27;s solved, spin it in your hands, and 
they&#x27;ll love it.

Chris

What I would do is say what you&#x27;re going to do (I would use Chris&#x27; 
thing, where you say it all mysteriously and stuff), then ask for a 
volunteer (Go somewhere near the back of the theater, assuming it&#x27;s 
in a theater, because then it makes it seem more like the person 
wasn&#x27;t a confederate who mixed it up a certain way) then time 
yourself. Solving the cube is something most other people (I like to 
refer to them as &#x27;mere mortals&#x27; LOL) only dream about, so it 
automatically gets good reactions. Maybe a standing ovation, or 
something, unless the audience is made up of people who already know 
you and have seen you do it. If you can do it blindfold, that would 
get you a reeaally good reaction. Or maybe (if there&#x27;s time) you 
should do it with two hands, then with one hand, then blindfolded, 
then with your feet or something... That would take about 20 minutes 
in all though. But it would be cool.

   I like Chris&#x27; comments about making a show of it. I know it&#x27;s
silly, but this sprang to mind:

   While it&#x27;s mixed the first time tell the audience about the first
world championship.

   Solve the cube, while cussing under your breath in about 50 seconds
then say &quot;I need it mixed up better.&quot;

   While it&#x27;s being mixed up the second time tell them about the
upcoming world championship.

   Solve the cube in 40 seconds and saY that was mixed better, but
that you want someone to *really* mix it up.

   Tell them that you hope to improve so that you can compete at the
world championship.

   Then whistle or play the theme to Jeopardy and solve it in 30
seconds and say, &quot;That&#x27;s how I like it!&quot;

          <div class="email-content">i would say chris has the right idea<br>
i&#x27;ve been performing for over 15 years now, and i use a cube, and a <br>
straight jacket in my show...not together (yet), but i mention those <br>
2 items, because they kind of get presented with the same thoughts in <br>
mind.<br>
<br>
i can get out of the jacket in about 15 seconds, but if i made a big <br>
show of getting 2 audience members strapping me in nice and tight for <br>
10 minutes, then escaped in 15 seconds...well the show would suck.<br>
by taking my time, playing it up, it gives me lots of time for <br>
humour...and it seems a little more impressive. i mean, someone could <br>
easily say, &quot;well if he can get out in 15 seconds, it musn&#x27;t be all <br>
that hard...so big deal&quot;<br>
<br>
well it&#x27;s the same with the cube. if i solved the cube in 20 <br>
seconds....&quot;well it must be some kind of trick or something&quot;...and <br>
you miss out on any opportunity to provide actual <br>
entertainment...which usually plays better than a &quot;wow&quot; reaction.<br>
so i solve my cube in 2 minutes and 5 seconds...just long enough to <br>
have the song &quot;spanish flea&quot; playing in the background...the idea to <br>
solve before the song runs out. there&#x27;s my built in timed aspect, and <br>
the song just makes people laugh.<br>
<br>
so there&#x27;s my take on it...please don&#x27;t do the same, but i hope i&#x27;ve <br>
given you a couple ideas on the theory...good luck and let us know <br>
how it goes.<br>

 the dan knights video is just a half an hour long tape showing the 
basic way of solving the rubiks cube (20 minutes) then it touches on 
going to advanced(f2l) a few minutes then expert ( OLL &amp; PLL) 
basically it is just a beginners video and is good for anyone just 
starting but not good for anyone already averaging 40 seconds or 
below... the only thing that advanced people will get out of it is 
a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; that just shows algs on it and   you can get more 
algs off of jessica&#x27;s site or speedcubing.com... it does have a few 
minute section on finger tricks but doesn&#x27;t give specific tricks only 
one example and how they work... the video didn&#x27;t help me at all but 
i am glad to have it in my collection... BUT if you are new to 
speedcubing i would honestly say check it out...

the video shows nothing specific you have to use the cheat sheet to 
do the various algs

          <div class="email-content">i like chris&#x27; input on the talent show... but think about this say <br>
that you can solve it in  under a minute (what i always say)...  then <br>
let the cube float around the crowd for them to mix... then solve... <br>
or another good thing that could work is to take like 3 cubes and at <br>
like beginning of show turn them loose in the crowd... then when it <br>
is your time up get them all up on stage and say that you are going <br>
to solve all three cubes in less than 2 minutes or whatever and if <br>
you beat the world record bring that up and say that this time was <br>
better than the current world record...<br>

algs I need to place the M edges.  I place them in pairs, and all the <br>

edges (I don;t know if that is good) but them I place the D edges in <br>
1 alg as well, and the average about 8 moves, so in less than 30 <br>
moves, I have all the edges placed (I still need to learn finger <br>
tricks too.)  I am still having a lot of trouble w/ the corners.  <br>

Yeah definitely get someone random from the audience to scramble it, 
otherwise the whole act is blown because everyone thinks you &quot;fixed&quot; 
the event.  I&#x27;ve run into that a few times when doing it for friends 
and they didn&#x27;t really believe me until they scrambled the cube and I 
solved it after that.  I would usually get to the mic and the first 
thing I said is something along the lines of &quot;I need a volunteer&quot; 
nothing special, to help build the anticipation when you say you&#x27;ll 
do it in under 30 seconds or whatever.

Just remember to have fun and keep the audience involved and the 
audience will have fun too (try talking to the audience as you solve 
it, like responding to comments they make while you do it).

Hope this helps,
Chris

Luck!  That&#x27;s the only way I could solve it in 21.411!  His best time <br>
(18.477) was a 0 look LL - after F2L, the cube was solved.  I think <br>
some of his other top times were only 1 look LL as well, which helps <br>
a lot.  However, it&#x27;s not all luck.  There are a couple things that <br>
help him.<br>
<br>
First off, he&#x27;s solved the oinkleburger 3x3x3 cube 1421 times to <br>
date, compared to your 77 attempts.  Practice makes a big difference, <br>
especially when getting used to the layout of the oinkleburger <br>
applet.  This (along with his speed and ability on a regular cube) is <br>
why he can move it so quickly - as fast as 2.90 moves per second.<br>
<br>
Second is &quot;solution length&quot; - the number of total moves involved.  <br>
Your top 20 took 89.5 moves, on average.  Ron&#x27;s top 20 has an average <br>
of just 53.6 moves.  If you look back to his first 77 recorded <br>
attempts on oinkleburger, they average 71.95 moves and 52.6 seconds, <br>
with a best time of 42.1.  This is also impacted by the frequency of <br>
lucky cases and practice, though.<br>
<br>
&gt; my average time on there is around a minute and 40 seconds. :(  It <br>
&gt; takes me too long to find the pieces I think, im getting better <br>
&gt; tho.<br>
If it makes you feel any better, after my first 77 attempts, my best <br>
20 tries had an average of 1:40.10 and 110.75 moves, so you&#x27;re better <br>
off (1:06.9/89.5 moves).  I&#x27;ve had to put in more practice than Ron <br>
(I&#x27;ve solved the 3x3x3 oinkleburger applet over 1700 times now), but <br>
my top 20 are now 21.411 to 28.021.<br>
<br>
&gt; It doesn&#x27;t help that I only use 4 or 5 algs for the LL on <br>
&gt; there  lol.<br>
&gt; anybody got any tips for me?<br>
I&#x27;ll say a couple things that have helped me.<br>
<br>
I noticed that you use a variation of Lars Petrus&#x27; method - I start <br>
with a cross, but you still may be able to apply this.  I&#x27;ve found <br>
that I can make the cross most easily on the &quot;front&quot; face (center <br>
square shaped face).  Also, the F2L seems easiest if I move the cross <br>
to the back (the top square).  Ron does F2L on the applet with the <br>
cross down.  Play around with different cube orientations for the <br>
different parts of your solution and see what works for you.  It <br>
would be good to avoid doing more cube rotations than necessary, as <br>
well.<br>
<br>
Next, practice doing the algorithms you know from different <br>
orientations on the cube.  For example, after I put the cross on the <br>
back, I don&#x27;t rotate the cube again until I&#x27;m doing the LL - I do <br>
each F2L corner/edge pair without rotating the cube.<br>
<br>
Adjust the applet size/color.  To be able to best find the pieces <br>
you&#x27;re looking for, make sure the applet it set up in a color scheme <br>
that you like.  Also, I&#x27;ve found that I can move faster if the applet <br>
size is not too big or too small.  Too big, and you have to move <br>
farther, too small, and your targets are hard to hit.<br>
<br>
Finally, learn shorter algorithms.  I actually use different algs on <br>
the applet than I do on a cube in my hands for some cases - triggers <br>
are not useful here, and slice moves won&#x27;t get caught!<br>
<br>
Well, I think I&#x27;ve talked too long, yet again... I hope this is <br>
helpful.<br>
<br>

Hi Grant,

   You&#x27;re right. I was talking about the regular cube. Thanks. I had
forgotten about the virtual cube. I&#x27;ve tried a few, but not that one.
 They&quot;ve all been really clumsy, and not intuitive for me, so I lose a
lot of time just trying to get the right thing to turn.

and of those &quot;Dr. C&quot; can only very, very, very rarely break 30 
seconds on a real cube, so the people who can do it consistently on 
both number only 3.

Thank you Grant, you covered everything!!

How do you check to see how many times someone has used the applet?

I like the layout of the site.  Its really hard to read the link on 
your main page to go to the other pages tho, and i couldnt get the 
videos to work either.  Nice collection too.

Is that a cube with braille on it? I made one of those once for an 
invention convention at my school. It didn&#x27;t work very well.

Well, I didn&#x27;t cover the cube rotations, but GameOfDeath2 handled 
that one :-P

> How do you check to see how many times someone has used the applet?
If you just want to see the best 5 times for anyone who has made an 
attempt, go to:
http://www.OinkleBurger.com/Cube/Net/?showscores=1
You can also pass in other parameters to indicate how many times per 
person or even who to display (use &#x27;+&#x27; for spaces in the name).  For 
example, if you want to see only your attempts, use:
http://www.OinkleBurger.com/Cube/Net/?showscores=1&amp;name=Heath
or to see just the top 1 for everyone, use:
http://www.OinkleBurger.com/Cube/Net/?showscores=1&amp;limit=1
You can use the name and limit parameters together as well...  What I 
did to see how many cubes had been solved was did something like :
.../?showscores=1&amp;name=Heath&amp;limit=2000
I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s solved any of the sizes more than 2000 times, 
but I&#x27;m not sure on that.

          <div class="email-content">My English teacher last year confiscated my speed cube one time, the 
one that I&#x27;ve put oh so many hours of work into.  I almost broke into 
a cold sweat and was ready to craft a devious plot to get my cube 
back but she gave it back to me at the end of class and was 
like &quot;just don&#x27;t do it again.&quot;  scared the hell out of me though.  I 
have never brought a cube to a class since.

heh heh so I can sympathize :)

after class, fortunately.
I have one class caled Technology, and it&#x27;s a very strange class. We 
work for about twenty minutes, then for the last half hour we do 
whatever we want. I do the cube.

Hi Frank.  Great site!  Looking forward to anything else you put on it.  A 
couple of questions / requests ....


Do you have the scrambling algorithm for you best lucky time, 3.96 seconds?  
That must be a world record, I think.

Also, I would *love* to see a video of you assembling the cube in 25/26 
seconds.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone doing it much faster than that!

          <div class="email-content">As far as the scrambling alg for the 3.96 seconds, that was a 
complete fluke.  I had a pile of cubes that I was doing and average 
with, and my nephew wanted to play with one.  So he grabbed one and 
played with it.  He put the cube down maybe 30 minutes later back in 
the pile, and I picked it up, started the timer and it was solved in 
roughly 4-5 moves.  And about the assembly vid, I will get right on 
it.  Im probably a bit rusty, as I have not assembled a cube for 
speed since November.  Hah.  Thanks for the input, I really 
appreciate it.  Keep it coming!

   Does the site record the moves used to solve a cube? And can you<br>
access that information?<br>
<br>
   TIA,<br>
<br>
David J<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; If you just want to see the best 5 times for anyone who has made an <br>
&gt; attempt, go to:<br>
&gt; http://www.OinkleBurger.com/Cube/Net/?showscores=1<br>
&gt; You can also pass in other parameters to indicate how many times per <br>
&gt; person or even who to display (use &#x27;+&#x27; for spaces in the name).  For <br>
&gt; example, if you want to see only your attempts, use:<br>
&gt; http://www.OinkleBurger.com/Cube/Net/?showscores=1&amp;name=Heath<br>
&gt; or to see just the top 1 for everyone, use:<br>
&gt; http://www.OinkleBurger.com/Cube/Net/?showscores=1&amp;limit=1<br>
&gt; You can use the name and limit parameters together as well...  What I <br>
&gt; did to see how many cubes had been solved was did something like :<br>
&gt; .../?showscores=1&amp;name=Heath&amp;limit=2000<br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s solved any of the sizes more than 2000 times, <br>
&gt; but I&#x27;m not sure on that.<br>

Yes, it records the moves - even cube rotations.  To play back a 
previously solved cube that&#x27;s on the high score list ( 
http://www.OinkleBurger.com/Cube/Net/?showscores=1 ) or in the recent 
attempts list ( 
http://www.OinkleBurger.com/Cube/Net/turnlists/index.cgi ) click on 
the start time of the attempt you wish to view.  If the start time 
isn&#x27;t a link, then it didn&#x27;t get recorded (probably predates May of 
2002 when moves started getting recorded).

Hey guys, no matter how bored i get, or how entertained i get in class (next to impossible)  I STILL CUBE ANYWAY!  (4.1358 Gpa)  Some of my teachers KNOW i am cubing in class, but as long as i don&#x27;t talk to anyone they just let me cube.  
-(im #3 of the class with 4.1358 gpa and STILL cube in class.  KEEP ON CUBING GUYS!

          <div class="email-content">Well, as always I am still working on corners for my edges first <br>
method.  But on a happier not, I now have all the algs I need to <br>
place all the edges in about 30 moves. (3 algs, the moves are kind of <br>
an average.)  But anyways, back to the corners.  I was thinking this <br>
might work, here is my idea.  After solving all of the edges do you <br>
guys think it woud be possible to place all the D corners (this means <br>
moving D corners in the U layer to the D layer too)  and then with 1 <br>
more alg do all of the U corners?  It is just a thought, and once <br>
again I am not sure if there are to many algs that will be involved, <br>
but ya know, I just thought I would ask you all anyways  :) thanks!  <br>

p.s.  I was just thinking about this, if I can do that corners idea, <br>
after I place my cross, it will only require 5 algs to solve my cube, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Some other math person check my math but I think this works.

If you look at placing all the D face corners in one move then you&#x27;re 
looking at 384 possible positions.

This is assuming you don&#x27;t rotate the cube itself at all,

Say you have all the D face corners in the D face but they can be in 
varying spots, then you have 4! positions those corners can be in

Say all the D face corners are in the U layer, then they have 4! 
positions

Say you have 3 D face corners in the D face then they have 4*3*2 
positions they can be in and the last D face corner can be in one of 
the 4 spots in the top layer so this leaves 4^2*3*2 positions

2 corners in each layer means 4*3 positions for the ones in the D 
face and 4*3 positions for the ones in the top face so (4*3)^2

1 corner means 4 positions for the one in the D face and 4*3*2 
positions for the 3 corners in the top face, so 4^2*3*2

So that gives you 4! + 4! + 4!/1! * 4 + (4!/2!)^2 + 4!/1! * 4 = 384

However you can rotate the D and U faces too since your corner movers 
will need to keep all the edges intact anyway.  So you can probably 
have a lot less.

I&#x27;m not sure how correct this is actually, since you can have 
reflections, inverses, rotations, etc.  but I think it would be less 
than 384.

I do now  :)
My method is very close to the Waterman method.  The closer mine gets 
to Waterman the better.  Right now this is my method, but I have been 
changing it a lot lately, which is slowing me down(not good for the 
talent show next week Tuesday though), but will speed me up in the 
long run. 

1.  Solve two adjacent corners(with center I always use red)0-2s
2.  Solve the other two corners(again always red)1-3s
3.  Solve three edges on the left layer(red)2-4s
4.  Solve right corners(1 of 41 alg Orange)2-4s
5.  Solve two right edges(Orange)1-3s
6.  Solve one right edge, and one left edge at the same time.  Or two 
left edges at the same time.2-3s(recognition kills me here and now it 
takes me 3-7s)
7.  Solve last edge, and orient middle layer(1 of 8 algs)2-3
8.  Position middle layer edges (1 of 4 algs)2s
9.  Line up the three layers(Right Middle and Left)0-1s

So eventually if I never have to wait to recognize I could get sub 
twenty.  But now I am at around 25s.  If I recall the Waterman method 
would solve the first four corners without the center, and then solve 
the center with an edge.  That would also save me time, but would be 
much harder for recognition.

<br>
Hey I came up with an alg to make a cube in a cube, and thought it <br>
was pretty simple.  Here it is.  It is based on my method of solving <br>
a cube.   I am going to use a different notation, where UDFBRL are <br>
the same, but udfbrl is the same as UDFBRL, and you move the middle <br>
layer as well. So u is the same as (U E&#x27;) or  (D QU).  Is there <br>
another notation for this?<br>
<br>
 u&#x27;r u f r D2 B&#x27; D2 B&#x27;L BL&#x27; F&#x27; E F E&#x27; F E<br>
F&#x27; L2 E L2 U2    23<br>
 (u&#x27; r u f r) would solve the first edges and corners <br>
  (D2 B&#x27; D2 B&#x27; L B L&#x27;) alg to solve other corners<br>
  (F&#x27; E F E&#x27; F E F&#x27;) alg to put last edge in and orient middle layer <br>

Hard to explain without pictures so go to www.speedcubing.com click 
on algorithms, click on notation, and you can see what E represents.  
Q means Cube so rotate the Cube and what ever move.  So QU means 
rotate the cube the same direction that the move U would go.  I  hope 
I didn&#x27;t confuse you more.

Like I said before, I think there are too many algs for my little <br>

As for the stickers, whatever works.  The clear coat thing sounds 
like a good idea.  

Algs- to master ANY method will take tons of algs.  for example, if 
you do the first 2 layers, either lars, fridrich, layer by layer, or 
some other way you could learn just a few algs for the LL.  The 
fewer LL algs you know will require more steps.  you could learn 
pretty much any number of alg&#x27;s for the LL.  The same goes for a 
corners first method.  The more algs you know the more things you 
can do at once, so that will require fewer steps and less time.  

So I guess you need to find a quick method, like maybe a method that 
does f2l first where you dont need actual algs for the f2l but you 
more or less can see how to move the pieces.  Then learn as many LL 
algs as you can handle :D

i hope i helped atleast a little bit

I&#x27;m a little confused about your step 6. If you have already placed 
three of the left edges, how could you place two left edges in step 
6 ?

I am so happy. I got approximately 19 seconds today in math class. <br>
This was the 9th attempt or so to break sub-20 for this video, with a <br>
5-second preinspection. Unfortunately a little less than a second was <br>
cut off at the very start (it&#x27;s just during the formation of the <br>
cross). <br>
<br>
Anyways, I am just happy to finally get a video, even if it has no <br>
sound (it was taken via a digital camera).<br>

hey sup those paper stickers that everyone are talking about ARE the 
ones from rubiks.com... those aren&#x27;t pvc just look at the back of 
them they are just laminated paper... but anyways i will try that 
nail polish thing myself and see if it helps...

   I&#x27;m not surprised at all that several people on this list like<br>
chess. During World War II when the US government looked for people<br>

mathematicians, and chess players.<br>

   I think that most people who really like the cube probably have a<br>

wondering, I know all the 42 algs to place and orient and stuff... <br>
but the problem is moving corners... here is my thought... Do you <br>

it!  :D<br>

OHHH!  1 more thing!  AIRPORTS!  (OK, this is kind of a lame con, but <br>

and my flight got delayed (I was with a choir class)  So i wrote on <br>
some paper &quot;Will solve rubik&#x27;s cube for spare change.&quot;  Well, this <br>
had a very good effect... I walked on to the place with a plastic <br>
baggy full of $9.76 in change.  it was amazing, and got me some <br>
FOOD!  On the flight I also bet the flight attendant that if I could <br>
solve the rubik&#x27;s cube, I got the in-fling movie free.  It worked <br>

fun coming up with that equation - note that there are sections that <br>

(12N - 24 (N/2))! = (12N-12N)! = 0! = 1<br>

correct for a 2x2x2 - although it&#x27;s very possible I messed something <br>

Hi Jake,

   Try this:

   For the corners:  the first corner cubie can be in 8 places with 3
different facings, the second corner has 7 places with 3 facings, the
third corner has 6 places with 3 facings, the fourth corner has 5
places with 3 facings, the fifth corner has 4 places with 3 facings,
the sixth corner has 3 positions with 3 facings, but...

 here&#x27;s where ther&#x27;s a change: the seventh and eighth corners have
only 2 places and only 2 facings.

   so that&#x27;s (8*3)*(7*3)*(6*3)*(5*3)*(4*3)*(3*3)*(2*2)*(1*1)= Postions
times facings = 40320* 1458 = 58,786,560 positions and that&#x27;s the corners.

Does everyone agree on this?

I&#x27;ll let you work out the edges...

David J

   I&#x27;m not sure what to say. It looked pretty efficient with maybe
some room for improvement towards the end where you had to reach
across. I do that too, so I don&#x27;t know the solution to that.

  Sub 20 is very good, and that&#x27;s probably the aim of most here,
including me.

  It looks like your work is paying off.

&gt;  here&#x27;s where ther&#x27;s a change: the seventh and eighth corners have<br>
&gt; only 2 places and only 2 facings.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Does everyone agree on this?<br>
<br>
Almost, but not quite.<br>
<br>
You had the first 6 corners correct, but the 7th corner has two <br>
places with 3 facings, and the 8th corner has only 1 place with 1 <br>
facing.<br>
<br>
You end up with 8! for the corner positions and 3^7 for the <br>
corner &quot;facings&quot; - multiply them together, and:<br>
8! * 3^7 = 40,320 * 2,187 = 88,179,840<br>
<br>
As far as edges are concerned (to continue with the original <br>
terminology), the first edge has 12 places with 2 facings, the second <br>
has 11 places with 2 facings, etc.  Here, though, the second to last <br>
edge and the last edge only have 1 place each (restricted by corner <br>
placement - parity), and the last edge only has one facing.<br>
<br>
So, for the edges, you end up with 12!/2 for positions and 2^11 for <br>
edge facings - Multiply together, and:<br>
12! / 2 * 2^11 = 479,001,600 / 2 * 2,048 = 490,497,638,400<br>
<br>
So, for the total number, multiply together the edge and corner <br>
numbers:<br>
88,179,840 * 490,497,638,400 = 43,252,003,274,489,856,000<br>
<br>

puzzles (including 2x2x2 - 5x5x5 cubes), check out his page at:<br>

Haha!  Nahh... it&#x27;s not a bet... more of a form of &quot;cheap entertainment&quot;  :)  You see, I get the proctive speed cubing, and I get some money (if people are willing to give it up.  But I never thought of that as a way to get people into the cube!  :)  Cheers!<br>

   I enjoy chess a great deal. What is a good chess site, that is, one
that isn&#x27;t speed chess? I like to take my time.

Ah, but (12N-24(N/2))! doesn&#x27;t appear in the equation. Look more 
closely.

The expression you are looking at, but misreading, is 1 if N is even 
and 12! if N is odd and it accounts for the central edge permutations.
(There are no central edges if N is even.)

You have to look a bit more carefully at the formula. You should get 
the correct number.
Try increasing the size of the pdf and you will notice that what you 
are reading as (N/2) is actually something else.

(There is no part of the formula which involves N and where the N is

For N=3, I get 43252003274489900000.

Namely, I get (88179840*479001600*1024*1)/(1*1).

Cool, I also do magic, juggle, and I&#x27;m trying to learn to ride a 
unicycle.
Anyway, I think speedcubing could be like reading music. I sorta 
play the piano. It is similar. One of my frineds is like a child 
prodigy or something, because he&#x27;s the best piano player I&#x27;ve ever 
seen (except for those five-year-olds on Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not, 
of course).

<br>
When I was working as a classical musician I often would go to a gig where I <br>
was sightreading all the music.  If the music was particularly mundane, I <br>
would often get to the end of the piece and then realize that for the whole <br>
time I had been thinking about something completely different.  Often I <br>
would have turned over a few pages as well, without even noticing!  So <br>
sometimes sight-reading is not even looking ahead; it seems to not be <br>
looking at all, just going completely on automatic.<br>
<br>
Sight-reading is not really any different from reading music that you have <br>
seen before, unless the music is particularly difficult to execute.  You <br>
read music not note-by-note, but more in groups that make recognizable <br>
patterns. (Like reading: if you think about it, it is not much easier to <br>
read something through the second time as compared to the first time, unless <br>
you are learning the language I suppose.<br>

I think that there is lot about learning a musical instrument that you can <br>
apply to speedcubing, from the physical aspect of learning to recognize and <br>
execute a series of patterns, all the way down the psychological aspects of <br>
being able to take what you can do in private out onto the stage and do the <br>
same thing under pressure.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I too fit the stereotype, I&#x27;ve played the saxophone for 8 1/2 years 
and tuba for about 2 as well.  I&#x27;m a math major in college right now 
(can&#x27;t get enough of it, I&#x27;m a total math geek), and I love playing 
chess.

On a side note I had an interesting experience in one of my math 
classes two days ago.  We&#x27;re talking about vectors and volumes and 
things like that, and we happened to be talking about a cube 
specifically.  My teacher likes to make the class a very active 
class, so at random times he&#x27;ll stop and ask a question relevant to 
whatever we&#x27;re talking about.  Well anyway we&#x27;re talking about a cube 
and he stops and says,
&quot;By the way how many edges are on a cube?&quot;
and I swear it had to have been a reflex or something, in less than 
1/2 a second I blurt out &quot;12&quot;  He looked at me with a slightly 
surprised look then asked everyone &quot;How many corners&quot; and again in 
like less than 1/2 a second I blurted out &quot;8&quot;.  It was so weird.  
Once he asked the question I immediately pictured a rubik&#x27;s cube, 
thought &quot;ok there are 12 edge pieces&quot;, and then blurted it out.

Kinda geeky or whatever but I thought it was interesting that he 
asked the one thing I could answer at lightning speed without even 
having to think about it.

Well,it seems I do not fit the sereotype (artists seldon do). I play 
neither music nor chess and my knowledge of math is negligible. When 
I was in college long time ago, I used to major in physics. In spite 
of all that, I can solve  the cube very slowly (in bout 5 minutes, to 
be exact). I can also answer how many corners, edges and center 
cubies  are in a Rubik&#x27;s cube or its larger cointerparts. There are 
always 8 corners. Thwre are 12*(n-2) edges, and 6*(n-2)^2 cebters. 
Thus for n=3 there are 8 corner, 12 edge and 6 center cubies. In a 
cubical design you use the same formulas, replacing cubies by cubs. 
It is useful to know how many cubes you have to tote to Toronto.:-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Grant,

   Thank you for the correction, as I did make a mistake on the
seventh corner. I made an early editing error, before multiplying (see
below).

   Yes; there are 27 facings on the last level - not 18. But your
correction is in error.

   What is first presented here is looking at all the corners (corner
cubies) of a 3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s cube with all of the edges (edge cubies) in
place.

   There are physical limitations imposed by the mechanism that make
it different from piling up separate blocks.

   There is a well-known limitation that you can&#x27;t switch two edges
and nothing else. There is a lesser-know limitation that you can&#x27;t
switch two corners and nothing else.

   Your answer is correct for a cube that has centers, but not edges.
Your corner answer is twice what it should be for Rubik&#x27;s cube itself.

   Your answer is correct if you physically swap two corners like
staked blocks, but incorrect fot Rubik&#x27;s cube. Here, take a solved
cube, physically remove two adjacent corners and switch them, (keep
them upright to the Last Level)  now try to solve the cube.

  Side note: 2x2x2: With no centers the first corner cubie is, for all
intents and purposes, immoblile, so divide that 88,179,840 by (8*3)
which equals 3,674,160 (corner) possibilities for the 2x2x2.

   Where I wrote:  (8*3)*(7*3)*(6*3)*(5*3)*(4*3)*(3*3)*(2*2)*(1*1) I
accidently reduced the wrong digit by one. The second last, (2*3),
should have been changed to (1*3) not (2*2).

   The equation should now read-(8*3)*(7*3)*(6*3)*(5*3)*(4*3)*
(3*3)*(1*3)*(1*1) = places times facings =  20160 *  2187 =
44,089,920. (Half your value)

   Then there&#x27;s the edges  (edge cubies) (12*2) (11*2) (10*2) (9*2)
(8*2) (7*2) (6*2) (5*2) (4*2) (3*2) (1*2) (1*1) = 239,500,800 * 2048 =
490,497,638,400. (Same as your value)

   Multiply them together you get  21,626,001,637,244,928,000. 

   Do you folow me so far?

   OK. 

   But that&#x27;s not the total.

   Wierdly enough, you can switch two edges and two corners together.

   Start with a solved cube, do: R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27;L, and you
will see two edges switched along with two corners. Neither of the two
corners, nor of the two edges may be switched by themselves, but the
may be switched together.

 To make a long story short, you add half again the value to get
32,439,002,455,867,392,000.

   Does anyone agree with this? This is all off the cuff, but I think
it&#x27;s right this time.

   Regards,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brent, David Chris, et al,

   I&#x27;m impressed by the number of musicians and math and chess
responses. I forgot to say that I&#x27;m a musician, too.

   David, I do agree. It&#x27;s fairly well known that some classical
composers wrote for the mind as well as the emotions.

          <div class="email-content">Well, Casen, I&#x27;m glad to see how much you&#x27;ve improved - and so <br>
quickly!  Just 2 1/2 months ago, you were averaging 1:47 (according <br>
to your message at <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/1933 ).<br>
<br>
As I recall (to answer James&#x27; question), you&#x27;re using Fridrich&#x27;s <br>
system.  My question is, how far along are you in learning the <br>
system?  Have you learned all OLL (57 algs) and PLL algs (21 algs, 78 <br>
in total)?  If not, you could think about finishing up on that.  If <br>
you have (even if you haven&#x27;t), it may be better to concentrate on <br>
practicing the cross and F2L.<br>
<br>
However, before I babble on any longer, I think it would be most <br>
useful to find out where you are.  Also, if you can find out on <br>
average what kind of times you get for various parts of your solution <br>
(cross, F2L, and LL), it might give an indication of where you should <br>
spend time practice/learning. Let me/us know, and we&#x27;ll try to help :-<br>
) ...<br>
<br>
One more tip, though, before I go.  You can&#x27;t expect everything to <br>
happen instantly.  I have dropped probably about 5 seconds on average <br>
over the last 2-3 months, and haven&#x27;t really learned anything new, <br>
it&#x27;s just been a matter of practice.  I&#x27;ve been practicing what I <br>
know, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s gotten me more consistently under the 30 <br>
second barrier.<br>

Actually, my number is accurate - the only problem is that my <br>
explanation is a bit &quot;lazy&quot;, I guess you could say...  Again, I would <br>
refer you to Jaap&#x27;s page - he explains it clearly.  Go to:<br>
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube3.htm<br>
<br>
Going from where you were, though, you can&#x27;t switch just two edges or <br>
just two corners.  You can, however, switch two corners and two <br>
edges.  So, if you take the number you came up with <br>
(21,626,001,637,244,928,000), which assumes that last two edges&#x27; and <br>
the last two corners&#x27; positions were predetermined, and swap the last <br>
pair of edges and last pair of corners, then each of those positions <br>
has a counterpart, multiplying the number by 2 (not 1.5), again <br>
getting 4.3e19.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps - I feel like I&#x27;m just confusing things... Check out <br>
Jaap&#x27;s page - it&#x27;s clear there.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, I guess I was a bit off.  I just took averages this past <br>
weekend on all of my cubes (2x2x2 - 5x5x5), and here&#x27;s the result:<br>
2x2x2 - 12.33 seconds<br>
3x3x3 - 28.93 seconds (only the second time I&#x27;ve been under 30sec)<br>
4x4x4 - 2:12.55<br>
5x5x5 - 3:54.75<br>

I&#x27;m a bit better off :-)<br>

Once corners are &quot;solved&quot; (think blindfold cubing), position the<br>

That&#x27;s because the corner and edge permutations can each be realized 
as a product of n 4-cycles for some n, the smae n in each case. It 
follows that if two edges need switching then some corners will still 
need switching and conversely.

You can think of the group as being isomorphic to a wreath product 
(as given, as I recall, in the Rubik Esoterica website) if it helps.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles,

   This is getting fun. :)

   I realize that the point is subtle. Let me try again.

   1. Without moving corners solve for edges: two edges can&#x27;t be swapped.

   2. Without moving edges, solve for corners: two corners can&#x27;t be
swapped.

   3. Those two edges and corners may be swapped together.

   Which of these statements isn&#x27;t true?

   Regarding #1: it&#x27;s the same as stacked blocks divided by two.

   Regarding #2: it&#x27;s the same as stacked blocks divided by two.

   Regarding #3 you guys are multiplying by two again, which negates
#2 instead of accounting for #3.

   Is that clearer?

   The meaning of #3 is that #1 and #2 are the same limitation.

   That means that you corrections were right and that I was in error.
Thanks for sicking with me &#x27;til I got it right.

          <div class="email-content">I had heard a few people mention vinyl film for recoating cubes, so 
I looked into it. It seems the smallest quantity I could get was 100 
sq yds or some absurd number like that.(Okay not that big, but

uses vinyl film?&quot; Sign shops do. So I spoke to a local sign shop, 
and they were very friendly. They thought it was a pretty 
interesting reason to seek out a sign shop, so they helped me out. I 
went to the place and they let me pick out whatever colors I wanted, 
and they wouldn&#x27;t let me settle for anything less than the high 
performance, high endurance stuff used for pinstripes on cars.

Sorry, long story short... I got enough film for twenty cubes and 
all I had to do was solve the cube for them a few times and give two 
dollars. I gave ten so I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad, and they told me it&#x27;s 
free my next few visits. Point is, signs shops have a lot of scraps 
of the stuff, and it works great. No peeling, and my cube feels much 
lighter.

I use plastic tape and vinyl for replacing the stickers.  I got some 
scrap pieces of vinyl from a sign place, like you did, for a couple 
colors.  What would be really cool is if you had them cut the 
stickers out for you too :D....that would save you alot of time.

&gt;Speaking of tennis racquets and running shoes, isn&#x27;t it interesting how<br>

&gt;has actually worsened?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Here&#x27;s one idea for an improvement:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;On the edges of each piece, why not display a bit of the colour that&#x27;s<br>
&gt;around the corner? For example, the red side of a red-yellow edge could<br>
&gt;also display a bit of yellow along the edge.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Of course, you might say this has an unfair advantage over normal cubes<br>
&gt;(you can see around corners), but on the other hand, maybe new cube<br>
&gt;designs are what&#x27;s needed to some day break the 10 second barrier.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s actually an excellent idea. Instead of seeing 24 of the 48<br>
stickers, you can see 39 of 48. That&#x27;s gotta help, once you get used<br>
to it.<br>
<br>
An other improvement could be tactile colors, so you could feel with<br>
your fingers which color faces had. Not sure how efficient that would<br>
be for fast recognizing, but someone should look into it.<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The other point that needs attention is better turning cubes. Does<br>
&gt;anyone have any ideas for that? Most people probably can&#x27;t turn the cube<br>
&gt;as fast as they can think.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know about the mechanics, but there should be better<br>
materials around. What are things like these made of if cost is not<br>
an issue?<br>

specifically what you know.  I would say that if you&#x27;re using a 4 (or <br>
more) look last layer, you should learn at least enough to get down <br>
to a 3 look LL - orient in two looks (10 algs - 7 for corners, 3 for <br>
edges) and permute in one look (21 algs, including all reflections, <br>
etc.).  Be sure when learning algs that you learn then with finger <br>
tricks in place - you don&#x27;t want to learn it one way, and then <br>
relearn it later!<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;re already using a 3 look LL, I would suggest two things - <br>
practice F2L and practice LL algs.<br>
<br>
For the F2L, don&#x27;t just practice algs - go slowly and practice <br>
looking ahead.  Also, practice the cross.  I was averaging about 35 <br>
seconds when the cross was still typically taking me 7-8 seconds.  I <br>
wasn&#x27;t able to figure out in the 15 second preinspection period how I <br>
was going to put together the cross.  Try giving yourself only 5-10 <br>
seconds, if you have this problem, to force yourself to look for it <br>
more quickly.  I think this cross improvement is part of what has <br>
gotten me under 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
For the LL, most likely the majority of time is spent on execution of <br>
moves, not recognition.  There are people who can do all the LL algs <br>
less than 2-3 seconds each - I still have some work before I get <br>
there (some still take me about 4 seconds).  If you&#x27;re not there yet, <br>
that&#x27;s a place for potential improvement.  Also, if you are taking a <br>
lot of time to recognize what situation you&#x27;re in, figure out what to <br>
look for, and practice recognition.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

Does anyone think it is possible to break the 30-second barrier without knowing any finger tricks?  Just a thought.  Also, any advice for the F2L of Fridrich&#x27;s system?<br>
By the way, Chess is one of my favorite games, and math is my best subject at school, and my fastest time with the cube right now (still improving) is 39 seconds.<br>

          <div class="email-content">thats awesome, im always waiting for someone to ask something about 
the cube.  Or there to be some spectatular prize at some store for 
anyone who can solve it.  haha...but that never happens to me.  I 
would have to agree that you need to show him whats up.  take the 
cube tomorrow and just sit it on your desk (mixed up) when class 
starts...and surley he will say something about it. then you get 
your chance to prove yourself. :D and possibly get on his good side 
if you do it right.

          <div class="email-content">hey eligeon,

I am a beginner to the professor cube too.  There is a downloadable hint booklet at http://www.rubikshop.com/US/freedownloads.html I use the method in that hint book as my solution. You can use the face lifter algoritm for the 4x4 for the 5x5 (just move the middle move back in place only at the end) This is how you can solve it with 3x3 and 4x4 moves, but if you want to improve there are other people&#x27;s solutions like at http://jjorg.chem.unc.edu/personal/monroe/cube/revenge/index.htm I&#x27;ve been planning to solve my professor cube in front of my friends too. :)

Good luck,
Ryguy

          <div class="email-content">Hey oh!  I dug out my 6 color minx and am having problems with the <br>
parity.  We discussed it a while back,  post 1707 had an 18 move <br>
alg.  I gave it a whirl, and yes it did switch the 2 pieces around <br>
but i am still left with the parity problem.  Even though it <br>
switched  the 2 pieces, it did not orientate the piece to fix the <br>
problem.  I must be doing something wrong... please help!!!<br>

Heres the alg that was posted, (i shortened the sequence so its <br>
easier to write)<br>
L++ U- R+ (F- R-)3 F- (R+ F+)3 U+ L--<br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris Hardwick&#x27;s page for rubiks revenge can be used for the 5x 
also.  

to fix the last 2 edge paris together you can use the alg 

d R F &#x27; U R &#x27; F d &#x27;

see his page for exactly which position it is 
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-solution.html

then sometimes there is a parity problem at the end this alg works 
great for it....   

r ² B ² U ² l U ² r &#x27; U ² r U ² F ² r F ² l &#x27; B ² r ²

again c the page for the position (different page so diff link..)

http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-step3.html

I finally solved my 5x by using these two algs. :D...i did a 5x on 
oinkleburger.com too :)....took for ever though

just do the algs the same you would on the 4x, but think the middle 
layer isn&#x27;t there, so d is the 2nd to bottom layer and so forth..

hope this helps

          <div class="email-content">Hello Ryan and Lars

   How about using roller bearings where appropriate, like on each center?

   Special center caps which let you get at the adjusting screws
easily and which reattach without needing glue.

   I like the plastic that the white cube that cubeman puts vinyl
stickers on, as it it is very light and slippery.

   I like the idea of spot of color on the edges to show.

    To be able to order different color plastics would be nice, plus a
 way to special order the stickers or tiles in exactly the colors and
textures you want.

I think the moderators can turn on the poll feature if they want.

          <div class="email-content">Hi...<br>
<br>
This is my first post here.<br>
<br>
I have been doing the cube for about 21 years, and can do it <br>
reasonably well using just about any method (including corners <br>
first), but my fastest times have been <br>
doing the first two layers by doing the cross, leaving 1 corner open, <br>
and flipping all of the edges in the middle layers quickly into place <br>
using the open corner...and then doing the last corner-edge pair as a <br>
unit.  I can do all corners and edges in the F2L in pairs, but I have <br>
never achieved my best with that method.<br>
<br>
My question is for other people using my method for the F2L...<br>
what are your best average times for the first 2 layers?<br>
I am starting to get my speed back after not doing the cube much for <br>
years...I averaged 18.68 today for the middle 10 out of 12...I am <br>
pretty sure I used to average about 15 seconds 20 years ago...maybe <br>
some day I will find my record ;-) In that era, I averaged about 29 <br>
seconds for a set of 10.  Recently my best average is 33.41 on last <br>
week&#x27;s Sunday contest...but I hope to do better this week. The first <br>
two layers are now about 3 seconds faster...and I am learning new <br>
last layer algorithms...<br>
<br>
Anybody else out there that uses my method for F2L? How fast are you?<br>
Is this method really inferior to the putting edges and corners <br>
together?  When I count moves, I get almost exactly the same count...<br>
but I can find things and look ahead much better with my method...but <br>
that&#x27;s just me ;-)  I like doing corners and edges in pairs...it&#x27;s <br>
cool...and I do finish the F2L that way...but I am not sure on my <br>
ability to do F2L faster that way...I am pretty sure I will get back <br>
to my former 15 seconds for the F2L using my method...or faster..<br>

You could just pop the piece, say something, then start over with the 
audience mixing it up again and all that.

          <div class="email-content">Oh my god how did he do that?!  I can understand doing the cube 
blindfolded (or behind your back) using your normal method but I&#x27;m 
amazed that he did it that FAST.  Was he able to examine the cube 
before he went on the show and plan the method in his head or did he 
have to go on just the little he was able to look at while he was on 
camera?  Either way, I have to say that that was definitely 
absolutely amazing!

i guess a question to consider is, are you trying to break a world 
record (22 secs) in front of these people, or just entertain/amaze 
them? because i&#x27;m guessing most of the audience doesn&#x27;t know what the 
world record for solving a cube is. and to them, solving it in 30 
seconds versus 20 seconds won&#x27;t make much of a difference in their 
minds...they&#x27;ll be impressed either way.

but to you, slowing it down to 30 secs would probably eliminate a 
popped piece. it&#x27;s kind of like the magic of david blaine. he doesn&#x27;t 
do anything any magician would be amazed by...it&#x27;s all really simple 
stuff. but his &quot;audience&quot; is floored by it, and that&#x27;s who he&#x27;s 
performing for. he amazes them with how he &quot;sells it&quot;. and that&#x27;s the 
mindset behind all well-known showman from the past.

just something to think about
again, let us know how it goes
and good luck

          <div class="email-content">Hey all.  For anyone who was following the whole thing about my math <br>
class, I stayed after class today and showed my teacher (and two of <br>
the other guys in the class) the cube.  It was really cool, they <br>
liked it and me and the teacher started talking and it turns out he <br>
knows a lot about the cube!  He was asking if there were an contests <br>
coming up and I said yeah one in August, and he said up in Toronto <br>
right?  He was also asking if I&#x27;d participated in the Sunday <br>
Contest!  So anyway that was really cool, thanks for the suggestion <br>
everyone.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should show the cube or not.  He was <br>
saying that he&#x27;d probably get me to show it to the class at some <br>
point :)  heh heh which is another chance to get people into the <br>
cube :)  So anyway it went well.<br>

Later all,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Can your teacher solve the cube? There&#x27;s a math teacher at my school 
who used to be able to, but he can&#x27;t now. He has a cube on his desk, 
and I decided to solve it one time. I picked it up and looked at it; 
it wasn&#x27;t my favorite color orientation. It was something like yellow 
across from blue, orange across from green, and white across from 
red. The reason for that was because someone apparently took off the 
stickers and put them back on randomly! The cube is completely and 
totally impossible.

          <div class="email-content">It appears that this discussion applies to me.  I am a 17-year-old 
who lives in Hawaii.  I just started the cubing about 3 months ago 
and am averaging in the high 40&#x27;s.  

As to the your suggestion on breaking away from this group, assuming 
that all the &quot;teens&quot; in this group started no more than a few years 
ago, none of us have very much experience.  Thus, it would be 
benneficial to learn from the &quot;masters&quot; who have been cubing for 20+ 
years.  However, if the discussion content in this Yahoo group strays 
too far from &quot;speed solving the Rubik&#x27;s Cube,&quot; then I would suggest a 
split for the sake of resolving conflicting interests. 

As for a trip to the world championships, it would probably be better 
to book a plane trip with your parents for the sake of convenience 
and safety.  I live about 2500 miles away from the nearest 
landmass...so I would have to book a plane trip anyway.  As for 
raising money, there are a number of programs available both online 
and by mail that will gross insane amounts of money if enough time 
and effort is spend marketing the items.  

Now that I have voiced my thoughts, I would like to bid everyone in 
the cubing community a pleasant day.  And please, if anyone happens 
to go vacationing to Hawaii, drop by my school:)

Well, I would not quaslify in any teen group, my age would forbid it.

t6houghts of my own. You are welcime to laugh. :-)

Go ahead, break away. Only please keep in mind that some oldster 
could very easily penetrate your group by pretending he/she is a 
teen. How will you prevent that from happening?

That is sensible. Of course, if you live in Hawaii, you have no 
choice, unless you are an excellent swimmer. :-)))

OH NO!!!!!!!!! Kids, stay away from those outfits. Chances are 
excellent that they are crooked. Not only will you not see an money, 
you may lose money . Remember the adage: &quot;If it is too good to be 
true, it probably is.&quot;
If you want to see the action in Toronto, earn and save your money 
for the trip. Start now. The farther away you live from Toronto, the 
nore it is going to cost. You should have more money than you plan to 
spend on the trip for emergencies. If you bring some hme, spend it on 
more cubes and create some 3 dimensional designs.

Before I get into my method, I&#x27;ll give a couple tips:<br>
1) Pick a color that kind of stands out, and do that for the first<br>
face.  If there is a second color that also stands out well (and is<br>
adjacent to the first, which on a 6-color minx could be any color), do<br>
that one second.<br>
<br>
2) When solving the megaminx, most of your time is lost looking for<br>
pieces (at least this was my experience).  Therefore, your approach<br>
should be the one that allows you to minimize search time.  For this<br>
reason, focus on one color at a time (for the most part) - complete<br>
one face, move to the second, then the third, etc.  Unfortunately,<br>
with a 6 color megaminx, half of the corners with the color you&#x27;re<br>
looking for don&#x27;t go on the face you&#x27;re working on.<br>
<br>
3) Experiment with LL and F2L algs - several 3x3x3 cube algs can be<br>
directly applied to the megaminx or can be slightly altered and used.<br>
<br>
Okay, enough babbling - here&#x27;s how I do it.  I&#x27;m sorry if this is hard<br>
to understand, but it would be really helpful to have some pictures<br>
for this.  Oh, well... Here it is:<br>
<br>
1) Form a star (cross) on one side<br>
<br>
2) Solve the &quot;F2L&quot; corner/edge pairs for the first face.  Because<br>
   finding pieces takes so long, and not all cube algs translate well<br>
   to the megaminx, I don&#x27;t do it the way I would on a cube.  Instead,<br>
   I do several steps for each pair:<br>
<br>
   2a) Find the corner and move it to the face directly opposite the<br>
       star (with the color of the star also on that face).<br>
<br>
   2b) Find the edge that it pairs with, and move the edge to one of<br>
       the 5 positions adjacent to the face opposite the star.<br>
<br>
   2c) Pair up the edge and corner, and move them both onto the face<br>
       opposite the star.<br>
<br>
   2d) Rotate that face to put them in line with the &quot;F2L slot&quot; they<br>
       belong in, and put them in place.<br>
<br>
3) Repeat 1 and 2 for the second face (adjacent to the first) and the<br>
   third face (adjacent to both of the first two faces), making sure<br>
   not to undo any previous work.<br>
<br>
4) Once you&#x27;ve done this, you should only have 3 adjacent faces still<br>
   messed up (not counting lucky cases).  You should be able to use<br>
   cube algs to place an edge and 2 corner/edge pairs on a fourth face<br>
   (adjacent to any 2 of the first 3 faces) to get down to the last<br>
   two faces.<br>
<br>
5) On one of the two remaining faces, place the corner away from the<br>
   other face, along with the two edges around it.  Then, place the<br>
   other 2 corner/edge pairs like you would in the F2L of the cube.<br>
<br>
6) LL (Finally!) is done in four &quot;steps&quot;, orient edges, permute edges,<br>
   orient corners, permute corners.<br>
   <br>
   6a) Edge orientation can be done in 1 look (3 algs)<br>
   <br>
   6b) Edge permutations can be done in 1 look (3 algs)<br>
   <br>
   6c) Corner orientation can be done in 1 look (with 2 or 3 needing<br>
     correction) or 2 looks (with 4 or 5 needing correction) (8 algs).<br>
     <br>
   6d) Corner permutation can also be done in 1 look (2-3 needing<br>
     correction) or 2 looks (4-5 needing correction) (4 algs).<br>
<br>
Note: with a 6-color minx, you will want to check for the parity<br>
problem (and fix it) during step 6b.  I believe the alg I gave a while<br>
back will correct parity without affecting edge orientation.<br>
<br>
Sorry for yet another lengthy post, but hopefully this helps.<br>

Alrighty, Thanks much, yes i too prefer a 12 colored minx than a 6, 
and also i use practically the same approach to the minx as you, i 
just need to focus more on searching and executing more efficient 
moves i guess.  Thans again and I&#x27;ll relay the message to my 
friend!!!

help the younger ones who just want to be able to solve the cube <br>

          <div class="email-content">Great to hear it all turned out well in the end Chris. :) I would&#x27;ve 
been quite surprised if your maths teacher wasn&#x27;t impressed by your 
cube skills.

I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all met people who claim they can do a cube, but then 
when you hand them the cube you happen to have in your bag and ask 
them to demonstrate it becomes obvious they have no idea!! If your 
teacher is a former cuber himself then he may have heard many people 
people claim they can solve it but actually can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m always cynical 
about anyone who claims they can solve it - until they show me!

Besides people in this group, I&#x27;ve only ever known two people who&#x27;ve 
actually been able to follow through with claims of &#x27;yeah, I can 
solve the cube&#x27;. Everyone else thinks it&#x27;s a huge achievement if they 
can solve a face! Then I have to explain to them why doing a face is 
meaningless - it has to be a layer before it could really be 
considered to be the beginnings of a complete solution.

Hey the talent show was a success.  I went up on stage with my <br>
juggling pins, said hi, and started juggling.  Then I dropped all of <br>
my pins, and said &quot;well good thing that&#x27;s not my talent.&quot;  Got some <br>
laughs, and some heckles.  Then I took my Rubik&#x27;s cube out of my <br>
pocket and said that it was in need of a good scramble, and asked for <br>
a volunteer. Then I asked if the guy&#x27;s hands were clean (Got some <br>
laughs).  When he started scrambling I started giving them facts <br>
about the Rubik&#x27;s cube, 4.3x10^19 combinations, and if you did a turn <br>
per sec, it would take 1400 million million years to get through <br>
every combination.  Then I told them about the first world <br>
championship, and the second world championship in Toronto, and that <br>
I was going.  Then I told them that the rules were that I get 15 sec <br>
of pre-inspection.  Then they gave me a 15s count down.  And then I <br>
said everyone with a watch time me.  I said ready set go. And during <br>
the solution, I was so nervous that my hands were shaking and I could <br>
barley turn the cube.  Then because of the bad light, I misplaced the <br>
first four corners.  Then I did the wrong algorithm for the second <br>
corners, and I finished in 36 seconds.  The crowd went WILD.  That <br>
was cool.  After it got quite I said let me have another try, without <br>
giving away the fact I was upset with the first time.  This time I <br>
did the right algorithm and it was much better with a time of <br>
28seconds.  And again the crowd went wild.  Anyway, They were going <br>
to judge on talent, originality, and entertainment.  And have a <br>
first, second, and third place, with $125, $100, and $75 as prizes.  <br>
But then they decided to give three prizes of $100 for the three <br>
categories.  A tap-dancer got it for talent, a rock group got it for <br>
entertainment and an angry solo guitar player got it for <br>
originality.  I think that if it were places (1st 2nd and 3rd) that I <br>
would have gotten third and the tap dancer would not have won.  <br>
Anyway after the show many people came up and told me how cool I <br>
was.  And I thought I did okay, so it was a success.  <br>

A couple of things: if you moved at one turn a second it would <br>
probably take more than 4.3*10^19 seconds because I would imagin that <br>
it is impossible to visit every position without ever coming back to <br>
a previous one (and, even if it were, it would take a while to think <br>
out the route).<br>
<br>
The other thing: you asked them to time you after the you&#x27;d got them <br>
to count 15 seconds. Doesn&#x27;t that give you a few extra seconds to <br>
think about things? Aren&#x27;t you supposed to just go for it immediately <br>

Richard, that might have been what Kenneth meant, but in any case, in the <br>
1982 championships the contestants did not go directly from the inspection <br>
to the solving, there was a gap of some seconds.<br>

          <div class="email-content">But wouldn&#x27;t that be kind of useless, because you only need a small 
portion to put the cube back down, not a 3 foot long mat. Besides 
that, it sounds like it would work well.

Hey kenneth,

Plans are underway for a Midwest Cube Day.  The date is currently not 
determined, but it looks like it will be held early next month.  We 
are planning to be at the Argonne National Laboratory, about 23 miles 
southwest of Chicago, IL.

I know a few who are planning on attending (and maybe I&#x27;m asking this 
prematurely, without all the details), but is there anyone else here 
who would be interested in attending (and/or able to)?  Feel free to 
reply here with questions, or e-mail me privately.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; After going through that, any suggestions on how to tackle nerves?  <br>
Whenever <br>
&gt; someone watches me I seem to get the shakes ...<br>
<br>
Well I think that the best way to do calm down is to relax!!  <br>
I was really nervous and was very tense.  I think if I had relaxed a <br>
bit I would have done better.  <br>
<br>
Also about the time after the 15sec, I suppose I could have thought <br>
about the solution . . . but I didn&#x27;t cuz #1 I was nervous and #2 I <br>
have to see to think.  That is one reason why I think that blindfold <br>
cubing is so hard for me. #3 I was talking to the crowed and not <br>
thinking about the cube.  <br>
<br>
And about cube explorer, I  too have had them solve a solved cube and <br>
thought it was weird.<br>

Springs are good because they allow you to cut corners around two<br>
adjacent face turns. But you can only do this if the second turn is in<br>
the opposite direction to the first. That is, you can cut around the<br>
corner R&#x27;U, but not RU.<br>

Would things be different if centre pieces had rounded corners?<br>

Springs are good things since they allow you to cut corners with two<br>
adjacent face turns. But (as I&#x27;m sure most people know), you can only<br>
cut a corner if the second turn is in the opposite direction to the<br>
first turn? eg. you can speed around R&#x27;U, but you&#x27;ll get stuck on RU.<br>

The ones that I got were.  That doesn&#x27;t mean if you get them they 
will be.  

A friend of mine who is in the Rubik&#x27;s club at UCI took them up on 
their free sticker offer.  
http://www.rubikshop.com/cgi-bin/shop.cgi click on Contact/FAQ and 
then click on &quot;Do you offer replacement stickers for my 3x3x3 or 
4x4x4 cube?&quot;

Anyway he got the crappy paper stickers.  But a while back my parents 
bought me their lube kit, and it had two sets of replacement 
stickers.  And they were the best stickers that I have ever had.  
Even after heavy use for almost 9 months, they still are bright.

about 3 times a day<br>

enough time to read all the posts, and maybe make one.<br>

A little<br>
<br>
How much time do you spend solving Rubik&#x27;s type puzzles? Daily? <br>
Weekly?<br>
<br>
&gt;From 3+hours to as little as 3 solves a day.  My average time a day <br>
is probably half an hour. (I can&#x27;t remember a day that I didn&#x27;t solve <br>
a cube at least three times.)<br>
<br>
Do you spend more time on this site or more time solving Rubik&#x27;s type <br>
puzzles?<br>
<br>
I think that some days I spend more time on this site than I do <br>
playing with my cubes, but there are many times I spend much more <br>
time on the cube than on this site.  On average I think that it might <br>
even be the same amount of time on each.<br>

1year and 4months<br>

Ranges from just a couple solves to probably 2-3 hours, although most <br>

Not much. I need to learn a ton of new algs, but if I start learning <br>

(theres about 30, and I have an awwwful memory) and then it&#x27;ll take <br>

   I don&#x27;t have that problem. I use my middle finger to do the U part
of both R&#x27;U and RU.

   I&#x27;m not sure. The cube works by both tension and comression and if
you round the corners too much you lose part of the compression. That
said I use the old Rubik&#x27;s deluxe and it doesn&#x27;t stick the way new
cubes seem to, but I need to break the new cubes in and adjust them where.

No. The action of the Megaminx on its edges is 28-transitive, so 
what you ask is not sufficient.

In other words, you can still encounter a parity problem, but more 
than likely it will not involve either of those two edges.

I realized that I deleted Cube Explorer off my computer on accident, 
so I downloaded Cube Explorer 2.25 today.  I tried the above 
experiment again, and thought it strange.  
I found though if you put your curser over where it says optimal, 
that it tells how long it takes to search each depth, and then I 
realized that it starts searching at depth 8.  Hence why it took 8 
moves to solve under optimal.

Enough playing . . . back to studying convolution, Differential 
equations, and impulse response.  Big midterm today!!!

No - because the problem is not associated to any two edges in 
particular.

Teresa,

   The assembly cube (3x3x3) comes with all the color tiles (instead
of stickers) already attached. I asked Ewe about it and he said that
pretty soon he&#x27;ll have the assembly cube with the color tiles not yet
attached.

   The cubies are a fixed distance from the center (no adjustment
screws) and the cube is &quot;loose&quot;. I haven&#x27;t lubed mine yet (I&#x27;ve heard
they&#x27;re quick once lubed), but I will after I remove the tiles and
rearrange them.

   The payment gateway was up for a month or so, but last I heard,
about a week ago, it&#x27;s down again. Email them for that information.

I&#x27;m sorry this didn&#x27;t come with more warning.  However, if you look<br>
back to post #2337, by j_rueth (December 16, 2002) he mentioned<br>
something about a midwest cube day and nobody responded to the group.<br>
Since around that time, a few of us have been talking via<br>
e-mail/chat/IM about doing it &quot;sometime this spring&quot;, and more<br>
recently (within the last few days) decided on March.  I let the group<br>
know quickly, because of the short time-table we decided on.<br>
<br>
Also, regarding people needing to save money to get to the cube day, I<br>
don&#x27;t think we were really anticipating that this would be something<br>
to attract people from great distances - though they are more than<br>
welcome to come if they can.  I would really love to see someone who<br>
averages under 20 there (Jessica - are you available? :-D ), but I<br>
realize the difficulty of planning on relatively short notice.<br>
<br>
Details I have at the moment, which are not set in stone (we still<br>
need to contact Argonne to find out if it&#x27;s okay by them):<br>
We&#x27;re hoping for March 8th (a Saturday), so hopefully, unless you<br>
work weekends or are too far away, this shouldn&#x27;t require any time<br>
off work/school.<br>

6 sided assembly cube? Did mathematicians at Meffert&#x27;s invent cubes
with more than 6 sides? :-)

I bought this cube a few months ago. I thought it was quite cheap, but
after trying it, I can tell you it is not! A weak toy, bad colors,
absolutely useless for speedcubing.

No problem with the shipping.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">what i do is to use the two algs that swap two edges. just fool around with the algs, not really sure what the order is... try doing the one that moves the two edges that are like a 45 degree angle..... i think its the move 3a. so just use move 3a and 3b to solve it. thats how i did it. maybe someone else will respond with a clearer method.

I need help on this topic too.  What do you do when the top has 3 
wrong and the bottom has 2.  If you swap adjacent edges, then i 
think you either get :
1. top has 3 wrong going counterclockwise and bottom has 3 wrong 
going clockwise
2. top has 2 wrong and bottom has 2 wrong, but diff alg

I AM PROBABLY WRONG ON THAT SINCE I DIDN&#x27;T CHECK, BUT WHAT DO YOU DO 
WHEN FACED WITH THOSE CASES?

&gt;    One way to deal with it is to play with your cube on a city bus.<br>
&gt;The worst thing that can happen is that you run out of adrenaline, the<br>
&gt;best is that you may find yourself a few seconds quicker.<br>
<br>
Funny you should suggest that.  I commute to work every day on the bus, and <br>
cube the whole time, there and back.  But I commute in Oxford (UK) and <br>
everyone is so polite / reserved that they hardly ever even look!<br>

I am not improvuing at all. For what I do, 5 minutes is 
adequateWouldn&#x27;t hurt to speed it up a bit, though.

Now that Toronto is coming up, I try to do it more often. Yes, I plan 
to go to Toronto, but I will not compete in speedcubuing. I will 
exhibit my designs per their cube art category.

I solkve the Rubik&#x27;s cube in order o create designs. A cube artist 
has to be able to solve the Rubik&#x27;s cube in order to use it.
>

agout 21 or 23 years, I don&#x27;t remember exactly.

I want to stress again, I do NOT go to Toronto to cinpete in speed 
cubung. If there was a contest in slow/inefficient cubing, then I 
would cinsider competing. :-))

          <div class="email-content">At my school, a person brought a cube just because I showed them that 
I could do it, so they wanted to try. I would say it&#x27;s getting a bit 
popular again, and it will probably be quite popular again by the 
time of the Championship.
I went to a math competition a few days ago also, and two other 
people knew how to solve the cube(I taught one of them, though). My 
math teacher brought this puzzle, one with marbles you had to slide 
around and get in the right place. She said she never saw someone 
solve it in ten years of owning it, so I went and solved it in 
fifteen minutes.

   I have a question. Most of the time when I have thought of doing <br>
some special pattern of some sort (check out my currently bare bones <br>
website www.geocities.com/cybermesh0/index.html for some examples). <br>
I have been able to do all of the planning in my head for most of <br>
them, because of the lack of complexity. Now I&#x27;ve started to come up <br>
with some more complex ideas, but I can&#x27;t process them in my head <br>
like I have with the others. I&#x27;ve tried some paper methods but I <br>
can&#x27;t seem to come up with a reliable syntax because of the 12 sided <br>
aspect of the Minx, as opposed to the Cube, which can be easily <br>
planned on paper. Has anyone else had the same problem and found a <br>
solution? Any feedback would be appreciated.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Eligeon,

About F2L:
= Keep the cross on the bottom or the left; that is what most successful
cross/F2L/OLL/PLL (CFOP) cubists do.
= Do not learn the algorithms for F2L; solving F2L pairs consists of two stages:
pair up (opposite or connected, depending on the orientation of the edge) and
insert. There are basically only a few different ways to pair up the corner and
the edge, mostly 3 or 5 moves. After that you would leave some easy ways to
insert a pair, like RU&#x27;R&#x27; or F&#x27;U&#x27;F. Once you get more experienced on this, you
can try to add some &#x27;real&#x27; algorithms to your repertoire for the awkward cases.
But pair up and insert is what I basically do: pairs of beautiful three move
triggers to solve a pair in 1 to 2 seconds.

About begin stuck around the 50&#x27;s:
= Learning F2L and OLL will help you a lot to get much faster. At first it looks
like a big task, but once you know them all you will say that it was actually
pretty easy, and you will want to learn more.
= If you did not lube your cube yet, then lubing can make a lot of difference
too.
How many moves do you need on average for solving a cube? 2 - 2.5 moves per
second should be possible for anyone. So if you are still below that, then it
could mean that you need to be a little more agressive (but still controlled!)
in moving, or that you need to practice on recognizing what to do next.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">During the  fist craze I was a college student. Now I am an elderly 
lady,  but still avidly cubing. I have chosen a different path. I am 
not a speed cubist. Instead I do cube art, in effect using the cube 
as an art medium. I am starting to explore the cube as a fractal 
environment. The goal here is to use this environment to explore some 
fractal geometry and fractal slgebra. The hope is that the cube 
fractal environment can be use to tackle much less artificial and far 
more complex fracrtals in nature. 

So I would welcome another cube craze, one that would acomodate both 
trends: speedcubing and use of the cube in other areas of homan 
pursuit. It takes all kinds, you know.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s pretty good, but the cube kinda flickers when it&#x27;s rotated or a 
side it turned.

I found it takes a bit of getting used to. Probably because I&#x27;ve 
never played with the online cubes. I much prefer having the real 
cube in my hands. :) If you interested, I downloaded it from:
http://www.ipaqsoft.net/php/freeresults.php?type=games%25

Other thing I noticed is that it has purple instead of orange.

          <div class="email-content">I really think you should learn the F2L algs! It will save you time, 
and these algs are also much, much easier to learn than OLL and PLL. 
Once you taught them, you will consider each move natural. You can 
actually understand how each alg work, and that makes it easier. 
Begin now and you will have them all learned in less than a month or 
so.

&gt; Are you improving a lot, a little, or not at all?<br>
Improvement goes slow nowadays. Every tenth of a second counts. Keep on<br>
practicing and one day you will suddenly improve again. Don&#x27;t give up.<br>
<br>
&gt; How much time do you spend solving Rubik&#x27;s type puzzles? Daily? Weekly?<br>
Normally probably 30 minutes a day in total for playing. Add another 30 minutes<br>
for thinking about puzzles, new ideas, and programming. Add extra time for<br>
updating the daily stream of record posts.<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you spend more time on this site or more time solving Rubik&#x27;s type puzzles?<br>
It depends on how you count. I discover my best ideas when chatting and cubing<br>
at the same time.<br>
<br>
&gt; How long have you been able to solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube?<br>
Almost 23 years. I was one of the first Dutch people with a cube (=June 1980).<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

I&#x27;m participating too to the cube teaching...
I&#x27;m a computer sciences student and I solved my first cube 7 months
ago. At my birthday party, I show my friends that I could solve it. So
two of my friends asked me to teach them how to do that. They bought a
cube and started cubing. From this date I started cubing at school
during my free time. I gave the cube virus to three other friends and
bought cubes on www.rubikshop.com for them (and for me :) ). So I
already have converted 5 of my friends to the cube, and I&#x27;m not going
to stop. I know several other people who show interrest for the cube.
We now often do group-cubing.
Let&#x27;s cube forever !!! 8)

          <div class="email-content">Hey all, I&#x27;ve been working on a new F2L approach lately and it seems<br>
to be showing some promising results so I figured I&#x27;d post about it. <br>
About a month back I was getting particular frustrated at seeing 22-24<br>
seconds as my average so I got an idea to change my F2L approach<br>
(since that is a large part of my problem).  I&#x27;ve always thought Lars&#x27;<br>
method for the F2L (with the 2x2x2 then the 2x2x3 was a really good<br>
idea).  Well anyway I got the idea to start the F2L by doing a 2x2x2<br>
cube first, then placing the remaining two edges.  I found that this<br>
was at times very quick and at times extremely inefficient.  So then I<br>
started thinking about it and now I just direct solve the cross and<br>
the first corner/edge pair (which is effectively direct solving the<br>
2x2x2 cube and the adjacent edges for you 2x2x2 people).  At first it<br>
was really hard to come up with the algs to try to direct solve it<br>
(and I was averaging over 30 seconds if I tried to speed solve the<br>
cube).  Now that I&#x27;m getting used to it my averages are dropping back<br>
down, and I set a 22.5s average using this new method (with 15 second<br>
preinspection each trial) not too long ago.  I also get a lot more<br>
times under 20 seconds than I did before (with the cross method).<br>
<br>
Here are some things I&#x27;ve noticed that seem to make this method more<br>
desirable than the cross.  By the way if anyone else has come up with<br>
this method let me know.  I thought that I came up with this on my own<br>
but if someone else does this don&#x27;t let me steal your credit :) <br>
Anyway here are the pros and cons I&#x27;ve noticed.<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
1) it takes MUCH more concentration during the initial 15 seconds and<br>
during the solving to complete the extended cross.<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
1) less steps to complete the F2L<br>
- the F2L is now 4 steps instead of 5 which psychologically makes me<br>
feel like I complete the F2L sooner and like I don&#x27;t have to<br>
concentrate as long<br>
2) It is fewer moves<br>
- I&#x27;ve found that if I&#x27;m concetrating I can complete the cross and<br>
first pair (extended cross) in less than 12 moves every time.  Based<br>
on the stats on Dan Knight&#x27;s page it takes 6.5 moves for the cross and<br>
6.25 moves per corner/edge pair which is 12.75 moves.  I think that<br>
with more practice I can do the extended cross in 9.5 moves on<br>
average.  I also frequently can do the extended cross in 8 or 9 moves<br>
(which is as much as the cross on a bad solve).  My absolute worst<br>
case is around 14 moves (which is the same as a 7 move cross and a 7<br>
move corner edge/pair which isn&#x27;t too uncommon.  However with the<br>
extended cross the 14 move cases don&#x27;t come up very often at all.  I<br>
also have found that my best case scenarios are 5-6 moves to complete it.<br>
3) Because it takes so much more concentration to do the extended<br>
cross I&#x27;ve noticed that it forces me to slow donw in the F2L.  I think<br>
this is for the better since I&#x27;ve gotten several 10s and 11s times for<br>
completing the F2L when I am able to see the direct solve for the<br>
extended cross.  I also got a 9 second F2L time once using this method<br>
(non-lucky).<br>
<br>
So anyway that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed so far.  Because it is so much<br>
harder to see the solution to the extended cross I don&#x27;t know if it<br>
will be faster in the long run, but so far it looks promising.  I get<br>
a lot of 20&#x27;s now, which I didn&#x27;t get as often before, so it seems<br>
promising.<br>
<br>
Anyway just wanted to let you guys know.  Let me know your thoughts. <br>
I&#x27;m going to continue testing this method against the cross method for<br>
a while and report on how it&#x27;s going.  So anyway if anyone else does<br>
this method too let me know!  I&#x27;d be interested in sharing strategies.<br>
<br>
One last thing.  I want to make clear that I don&#x27;t solve the 2x2x2<br>
first and then the last two edges, nor do I do the cross and try to<br>
set up the pair at the same time.  My strategy is to try to direct<br>
solve it.  Sometimes I can see the direct solve but a lot of times I<br>
have to try different things that come close.  I&#x27;ve found though that<br>
if I look at a situation long enough I can almost always find the<br>
direct solve, so I think with practice I could get good at doing this<br>
in the 15 second pre-inspection.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris!<br>
Fun to hear you have found this new approach! I also use it <br>
sometimes, but not the same way you do. If I see that I can place a <br>
2x2x2 block easily, I do that and then place the remaining edges in <br>
he cross. But as I said I only use it when the 2x2x2 block is easy <br>
to figure out. I must say that your idea of placing ALL of the <br>
pieces in the cross and the first pair in one alg is very <br>
interesting. I will probably try it myself, but I don&#x27;t think I have <br>
the ability to look ahead that far. Hoping to hear from faster times <br>
from you soon! <br>

&gt; (and I was averaging over 30 seconds if I tried to speed solve the<br>
&gt; cube).  Now that I&#x27;m getting used to it my averages are dropping <br>
back<br>
&gt; down, and I set a 22.5s average using this new method (with 15 <br>
second<br>
&gt; preinspection each trial) not too long ago.  I also get a lot more<br>
&gt; times under 20 seconds than I did before (with the cross method).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Here are some things I&#x27;ve noticed that seem to make this method <br>
more<br>
&gt; desirable than the cross.  By the way if anyone else has come up <br>
with<br>
&gt; this method let me know.  I thought that I came up with this on my <br>
own<br>
&gt; but if someone else does this don&#x27;t let me steal your credit :) <br>
&gt; Anyway here are the pros and cons I&#x27;ve noticed.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Cons:<br>
&gt; 1) it takes MUCH more concentration during the initial 15 seconds <br>
and<br>
&gt; during the solving to complete the extended cross.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Pros:<br>
&gt; 1) less steps to complete the F2L<br>
&gt; - the F2L is now 4 steps instead of 5 which psychologically makes <br>
me<br>
&gt; feel like I complete the F2L sooner and like I don&#x27;t have to<br>
&gt; concentrate as long<br>
&gt; 2) It is fewer moves<br>
&gt; - I&#x27;ve found that if I&#x27;m concetrating I can complete the cross and<br>
&gt; first pair (extended cross) in less than 12 moves every time.  <br>
Based<br>
&gt; on the stats on Dan Knight&#x27;s page it takes 6.5 moves for the cross <br>
and<br>
&gt; 6.25 moves per corner/edge pair which is 12.75 moves.  I think that<br>
&gt; with more practice I can do the extended cross in 9.5 moves on<br>
&gt; average.  I also frequently can do the extended cross in 8 or 9 <br>
moves<br>
&gt; (which is as much as the cross on a bad solve).  My absolute worst<br>
&gt; case is around 14 moves (which is the same as a 7 move cross and a <br>
7<br>
&gt; move corner edge/pair which isn&#x27;t too uncommon.  However with the<br>
&gt; extended cross the 14 move cases don&#x27;t come up very often at all.  <br>
I<br>
&gt; also have found that my best case scenarios are 5-6 moves to <br>
complete it.<br>
&gt; 3) Because it takes so much more concentration to do the extended<br>
&gt; cross I&#x27;ve noticed that it forces me to slow donw in the F2L.  I <br>
think<br>
&gt; this is for the better since I&#x27;ve gotten several 10s and 11s times <br>
for<br>
&gt; completing the F2L when I am able to see the direct solve for the<br>
&gt; extended cross.  I also got a 9 second F2L time once using this <br>
method<br>
&gt; (non-lucky).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So anyway that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed so far.  Because it is so much<br>
&gt; harder to see the solution to the extended cross I don&#x27;t know if it<br>
&gt; will be faster in the long run, but so far it looks promising.  I <br>
get<br>
&gt; a lot of 20&#x27;s now, which I didn&#x27;t get as often before, so it seems<br>
&gt; promising.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyway just wanted to let you guys know.  Let me know your <br>
thoughts. <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m going to continue testing this method against the cross method <br>
for<br>
&gt; a while and report on how it&#x27;s going.  So anyway if anyone else <br>
does<br>
&gt; this method too let me know!  I&#x27;d be interested in sharing <br>
strategies.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; One last thing.  I want to make clear that I don&#x27;t solve the 2x2x2<br>
&gt; first and then the last two edges, nor do I do the cross and try to<br>
&gt; set up the pair at the same time.  My strategy is to try to direct<br>
&gt; solve it.  Sometimes I can see the direct solve but a lot of times <br>
I<br>
&gt; have to try different things that come close.  I&#x27;ve found though <br>
that<br>
&gt; if I look at a situation long enough I can almost always find the<br>
&gt; direct solve, so I think with practice I could get good at doing <br>
this<br>
&gt; in the 15 second pre-inspection.<br>

Here&#x27;s an example of what I mean by direct solve.

In the chat we were comparing solutions for a scramble.  I was able 
to do the cross and 1st pair in 9 moves, then looking at it later I 
found a way to do it in 8 moves.

Do the scramble
D B2 F&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; F L F&#x27; L2 B2 U&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; B2 L&#x27; R F&#x27; R2 U D F2 D&#x27; U F2 B&#x27;

If I were doing the cross method I would begin with
B&#x27; R U&#x27; F2 D2 F (cross) and assuming I was observant I would see the 
the easy short cut and do U L U&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; to finish the cross and 1st 
pair in 11 moves

This completes the cross and 1st corner/edge pair in 11 moves.
However, during a 15 section pre-inspection I saw this move,
B&#x27; D2 U F&#x27; D2 R D U R2

and looking at it later I found a shorter way,
B&#x27; D2 U F&#x27; L B2 L&#x27; D&#x27;

So that is an example of how I approach the first step now.  I&#x27;m 
trying to get used to the different types of scenarios and hopefully 
see the direct solve every time.  I don&#x27;t know if the 8 move solve is 
actually the direct solve (fastest possible way to solve it) but 
getting to the cross/1st pair in 8 moves is much more desirable to me 
than doing it in 11 (assuming I saw the shortcut).  At 3/turns per 
sec average for the whole cube that&#x27;s 1 less second it took me to 
solve the cube (which could be the difference between a 17 and 16 
second average for the pros).  However all this assumes that seeing 
the direct solve, or very close, is possible in 15 seconds, which is 
what I&#x27;m trying to figure out with trying this method out.

Hope that makes sense,
Chris

best average is 25.6 seconds, im a little slower than that right now.

not at at all really.  I need to start working on things again.

Weekly?
when im working on improving on the cube i spend 2-4 hours on it 
that day, somedays i dont touch the cube.  most the time i spend an 
hour or less per day.

I try to find the one that is best setup with the cross pieces to 
easily put the whole extended cross (cross and first pair) together.

          <div class="email-content">Hey I just realized something.  I&#x27;ve never had the third layer solved <br>
after completing the first two layers.  I can only recall one time <br>
that this has ever happened and that was my weird lucky case of 3.xx <br>
seconds but I don&#x27;t think the cube was fully scrambled.  If I only <br>
look at real solves (from fully scrambled) then I&#x27;ve estimated that <br>
I&#x27;ve solved the cube (virtual and real form) about 52,000 times since <br>
I started.  I figured that number out a while ago for the statistics <br>
part of the records page.<br>
<br>
Ok so the probability of running into the case where the third layer <br>
is solved is the same as the probability of running into the pieces <br>
already oriented correctly case and then the pieces already placed <br>
correctly placed case.  This is 1/216 * 1/72 = 1/15552<br>
<br>
So the probability of me NOT running into the case where the third <br>
layer is solved after the first two layers should be 1 - 1/15552 or <br>
15551/15552<br>
<br>
Since I&#x27;ve solved the cube 52,000 times, the probability that I&#x27;ve <br>
never seen this case for every cube I&#x27;ve solved should be<br>
(15551/15552)^52000 = 0.03530506 or about a 3.53% chance that I&#x27;ve <br>
never seen this case.<br>
<br>
I guess that doesn&#x27;t seem too strange now that I see the number.  <br>
Anyway it was just a weird side thought.  Has anyone else ever not <br>
seen that case?  Has anyone seen it a lot of times (relative to the <br>
probability I mean).  Does anyone else have any other cool <br>
probability occurences?  Has anyone ever solved the cube just by <br>
doing random turns?  Apparently my occurence happening three times <br>
out of one hundred doesn&#x27;t seem too terribly far-fetched now that I <br>
think about it.<br>
<br>
OK just wanted to go on that random tangent.<br>

I bought a 4x4x4 just before Christmas. I was pretty keen to work it 
out, but clearly not as committed as you because only ever played 
with it for a hour or two at a time! :)

Friends from school call me Jas, but everyone else just calls me <br>
Jasmine.<br>
<br>
&gt; How often do you come to this site?<br>
<br>
Every second day on average.<br>
<br>
&gt; How long do you spend on this site?<br>
<br>
Long enough to read the posts. Unless I&#x27;m really busy, in which case <br>
I just read a few and try and catch up on the rest later.<br>
 <br>
&gt; What is your Average time to solve a Rubik&#x27;s cube?<br>
<br>
Between 1 minute and 1 1/4 minutes.<br>
 <br>
&gt; Are you improving a lot, a little, or not at all?<br>
<br>
Not at all. In fact, I think I&#x27;m going backwards.<br>
<br>
&gt; How much time do you spend solving Rubik&#x27;s type puzzles? Daily? <br>
&gt; Weekly?<br>
<br>
Haven&#x27;t cubed much at all for the past 2 months. Probably why my <br>
times aren&#x27;t so good at the moment. :/<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you spend more time on this site or more time solving Rubik&#x27;s <br>
type <br>
&gt; puzzles?<br>
<br>
At the moment, more time on this site.<br>
<br>
&gt; How long have you been able to solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube?<br>
<br>
About 15-16 years.<br>

I agree, the Eastsheen (as sold in the Xmas package) is a fast 2x2x2.
I definitely think a well trained cubist could average 7 seconds with it.

          <div class="email-content">I too would welcome, if more attention is paid to the Rubik&#x27;s cube in 
disciplines other than speedcubing, such as cube art, computer cubing 
and even scientific research. Scientists in particular are not at all 
keen to learn its solution. e need to bring the cube into those n 
traditional fields.

hey guys:<br>
im around 35-50 with the cube right now, and i&#x27;ve been cubing for about 4-5 months.  i only know 5 permutations and their inverses, and i use Dan Knight&#x27;s advanced method for the orientations.  i was wondering if i were to bother memorizing the other permutations and memorize more for the F2L  i could get sub 20 or so???  <br>

apparently Dan Knights was able to average sub 20 with his advanced method..  I have no idea how, but he did..A strong F2L is key in this matter though.  I would assume anyway.  I think you should definately finish learning the PLL algs, and then really work hard on the F2L.  Just my 2 cents..  Im not a master or anything.

          <div class="email-content">Brent, it depends on your golas. If you want to average below 20, <br>
you should learn all permutations. When it comes to F2L, I would <br>
recommend that you do not start learning them one by one ... I think <br>
that will hurt you in the long run. Try to do it yourself, try to <br>
develop those algorithms yourself. Most of them are either obvious <br>
or simple to come up with. Yes, you may use an algorithm that is 1 <br>
or 2 moves longer than what is on the page, but what is important is <br>
that you will gain certain &quot;insight&quot; into how the F2L work. And that <br>
is _very_ valuable. More valuable than just memorizing them all and <br>
applying them mechanically. F2L is not like LL and should be <br>
approached diferently. I recommend that you just play around with <br>
the F2L without measuring your time - just keep on solving the F2L <br>
over and over again, do not even finish the LL, and ignore the time. <br>
Do it for a month and then take the stop watch. You will see a big <br>
difference. Then, once you have your F2L in, say, 15-20, go to those <br>
algorithms for the F2L and learn only those that are shorter and <br>
more elegant than those you developed yourself. I believe that even <br>
with using sub-optimal algs for the F2L, you can average around 15 <br>
easily. Given that you need, say, 8 seconds for the LL, that would <br>
give you a 23 sec. average, which is not bad at all.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Indeed!  The F2l for me is something that you need to learn on your <br>
own.  Learning a bunch of algs will cram your short term memory and <br>
make you perform worse in the long run.  It is best that you set <br>
speedcubing aside and just try and focuss on the f2l and generating <br>
your own techniques.  Then after you have a stronge f2l sense, start <br>
applying the speed back into your life and watch as your times drop.  <br>
It&#x27;s like magic!!!  But be warned your first times may be pretty bad!!!  <br>
Just stick with it!!!<br>

cubing to various subjects, not only does it help for me to understand

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I agree with jessica about the F2L thing. I just started to see how the F2L algs work, but I&#x27;m not memorizing them just yet... It a kind of &quot;cube intution&quot; when you play around with the F2L to find algs on your own. I&#x27;m starting to do this too.

          <div class="email-content">     Hi all!  Just wanted to see what this group was all about.  I&#x27;m <br>
a first year college student at University of Maine in Orono, and <br>
bought my first Cube from Toys R Us over Thanksgiving break.  A few <br>
weeks later, I converted it into a makeshift speedcube (makeshift <br>
because department store cubes are most definitely NOT made to be <br>
speedcubed with... ;) )Since then, I have gone from not being able to <br>
get two like colors side by side, to being able to solve the standard <br>
3x3x3 in 1:03.  Not a bad time, but not a good time either, as I&#x27;m <br>
seeing from the sites I&#x27;ve visited.  The method I use is the layers <br>
method as prescribed by the book that came with the Cube.  I am, <br>
however, working on the corners method, and hope to chisel my time <br>
down with that.<br>
     I purchased a 4x4x4 cube a few weeks ago, and I&#x27;m down to 5:19 <br>
on that, using a method similar to the corners method, but a bit more <br>
elaborate due to multiple edge/center pieces.  I also have a 5x5x5 in <br>
the mail (SHOULD BE HERE TOMORROW!!!!) that I hope to be able to <br>
break 10 minutes with.  If anyone has any tips, algorithims, <br>
orienting moves, permutations, etc. I&#x27;d love to hear them!  I&#x27;m <br>
always on the lookout for new and exciting techniques!  Have fun and <br>
keep cubing!<br>

This is what sometimes happens when one spouse cubes and the other 
doesn&#x27;t. 
If I tell you the names I have heard given the Rubik&#x27;s cube, I would 
be thrown out of this group for using foul language....
In spite of that, I love the cube....

Many people in this group csan solve the cube blindfolded, but I 
can&#x27;t. All I can do is twiddle designs. it would be nice to go to 
Guinness with that, but I am too old to entertain such fantasies.

          <div class="email-content">the best advice in the world for being able to look ahead is to NOT 
CUBE AT FULL SPEED. I don&#x27;t know if you are, but make sure that 
you&#x27;re just going slow and relaxed. If you&#x27;re going at three moves 
per second or something, then lower it to at most two moves per 
second. This makes it so very simple to look ahead. Then when you get 
to the LL, start going fast again. when I first heard about going 
slow, I tried it and I set a new record right away. It really helps 
alot.

i like that so many of you put cube vids of some kind on your sites. <br>
some are vids of your speed attempts, or solution steps (which are <br>
great when done slow...helps to learn a whole lot more), or animated <br>
cubie adventures.<br>
<br>
my question is, for everyone who has made a vid of some kind, what <br>
program do you use? obviously i&#x27;d love a freebie, but just wondering <br>
what everyone uses. something that makes a decent quality vid, but <br>
doesn&#x27;t have a 2 year learning curve...and sound is nice...gotta love <br>
the &quot;click, click&quot; of a cube vid.<br>
<br>
thanks<br>

          <div class="email-content">I do a method alot like the Lars method.  

When making the 2x2x2 first start by making a 1x2x2 on one layer of 
the cube, and then put the corrosponding edge in its place and then 
put the 1x2x2 with it so theres the 2x2x2.  When picking a corner to 
solve look for the easiest.  When there is a corner-edge pair 
already together(like there is most of the time) then your set.  How 
my method differs from Lars method is that I do not make all the 
edges &quot;good&quot; then use only two layers to finish the f2l.  I just go 
straight for solving the rest of the f2l after the 2x2x3.  

i hope some of that makes sence to you, if not i&#x27;ll try to explain 
better.

For the Fridrich method,  after making the cross on one layer, you 
just put the corner-edge pairs together and put them in their 
correct places.  You do that 4 times.  I think there are 22 or so 
different situations that jessica has on the site. That covers all 
possible situations unless the corner or edge is in the wrong slot 
in the f2l.

          <div class="email-content">For all of the other f2l, I can look ahead ok.  But the first one is<br>
hard to follow during cross.  Supposedly, when you master F2L, you can<br>
see more than 1 edge corner pair right after solving the cross? (right<br>
now, I only sometimes see both edge and corner, usually just corner).<br>
 I&#x27;m sure you have to look ahead during cross to be fast on first f2l,<br>

it: http://www31.brinkster.com/rubiks82
What I would do if I were you is just keep solving it the way you are

you do certain algorithms, and all that. That way, you&#x27;ll be able to 
understand other solutions much, MUCH better. Hopefully. That&#x27;s 
basically what I did.

          <div class="email-content">speed-cuber,
ur explanation on Lars Petrus&#x27;s solution helped me a lot, but i get 
kinda confused on step 4, (could u elaborate more) where u say..
&quot;First get it into the position below, with the top color facing the 
bottom. Put that cube right underneath it&#x27;s correct position. In the 
example, the top color is orange.&quot;  

and, &quot;get the edge that goes right below the corner piece so the 
white facelet is facing the white center&quot;.. are u that talking about 
the middle layer&#x27;s edge piece and the white piece on the same plane 
as the center white piece?

(btw, on step 3, where u find out if the edges are incorrect, the 
four rules that Lars said also works, right?, and when u say &quot;facing 
the center&quot;, do u mean the edge piece is on the same layer or plane 
as the center piece?)  

oh yea, i think ur missing the pic near the bottom in step 4. :)
thanks

          <div class="email-content">If you are new to the cube and average over 2 mins, I think the Jessica method (layer by layer) way is very good to learn.  It&#x27;s very systematic.  Go to puzzlesolver.com and they will teach you to do a very simple version of it.  There are only like 6 algs that you have to memorize and use repeatedly.  Then, as you get better, you start learning detailed algs and while you learn, you also become more fluent with the cube (triggers) and the more you learn the better the time will be.  Though it may not be the most simple, it&#x27;s a good learning experience to work your way up to that sub-20s mark...I&#x27;m at 29s.  For cube-lubing, I find that if you can&#x27;t get your hands on stuff like silicon spray or lube oils from online, cooking oil do fine (machine oil do a better lube job but could be bad for the cube, it&#x27;s up to you).   --- &quot;drunkenpike <br>

Put that cube right underneath it&#x27;s correct&gt; position. In the &gt; example, the top color is orange.&quot;  &gt; &gt; and, &quot;get the edge that goes right below the corner&gt; piece so the &gt; white facelet is facing the white center&quot;.. are u&gt; that talking about &gt; the middle layer&#x27;s edge piece and the white piece on&gt; the same plane &gt; as the center white piece?&gt; &gt; (btw, on step 3, where u find out if the edges are&gt; incorrect, the &gt; four rules that Lars said also works, right?, and&gt; when u say &quot;facing &gt; the center&quot;, do u mean the edge piece is on the same&gt; layer or plane &gt; as the center piece?)  &gt; &gt; oh yea, i think ur missing the pic near the bottom&gt; in step 4. :)&gt; thanks&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,&gt; &quot;James Potter &gt; &quot;  wrote:&gt; &gt; I have a site with a few different solutions, you&gt; might want to &gt; see &gt; &gt; it: http://www31.brinkster.com/rubiks82&gt; &gt; What I would do if I were you is just keep solving&gt; it the way you &gt; are &gt; &gt; until you are very familiar with the cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris, welcome to the cube and to the group!  There are quite a few <br>
corners first people in the group who average around the 25 second mark, and <br>
a few who average even less than that, so good luck, and keep us posted on <br>
your progress!    Hope you enjoy the 5x5x5 ...<br>

PS Hope you enjoy the 5x5x5 ...<br>
<br>
&gt;      Hi all!  Just wanted to see what this group was all about.  I&#x27;m<br>
&gt;a first year college student at University of Maine in Orono, and<br>
&gt;bought my first Cube from Toys R Us over Thanksgiving break.  A few<br>
&gt;weeks later, I converted it into a makeshift speedcube (makeshift<br>
&gt;because department store cubes are most definitely NOT made to be<br>
&gt;speedcubed with... ;) )Since then, I have gone from not being able to<br>
&gt;get two like colors side by side, to being able to solve the standard<br>
&gt;3x3x3 in 1:03.  Not a bad time, but not a good time either, as I&#x27;m<br>
&gt;seeing from the sites I&#x27;ve visited.  The method I use is the layers<br>
&gt;method as prescribed by the book that came with the Cube.  I am,<br>
&gt;however, working on the corners method, and hope to chisel my time<br>
&gt;down with that.<br>
&gt;      I purchased a 4x4x4 cube a few weeks ago, and I&#x27;m down to 5:19<br>
&gt;on that, using a method similar to the corners method, but a bit more<br>
&gt;elaborate due to multiple edge/center pieces.  I also have a 5x5x5 in<br>
&gt;the mail (SHOULD BE HERE TOMORROW!!!!) that I hope to be able to<br>
&gt;break 10 minutes with.  If anyone has any tips, algorithims,<br>
&gt;orienting moves, permutations, etc. I&#x27;d love to hear them!  I&#x27;m<br>
&gt;always on the lookout for new and exciting techniques!  Have fun and<br>
&gt;keep cubing!<br>
&gt;<br>

And the step three rules on Lars&#x27; site still work.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all: I did not know whether to post this here, or at the wc page, or at <br>
the official-cubing-society page.<br>
<br>
So anyway ... I have been thinking about how to establish an &quot;official&quot; <br>
timing process for speedcubing.  It seems we need a system which:<br>
<br>
1. can be agreed by the majority of speedcubers<br>
2. is fair, i.e. does not have a loophole that a nasty speedcuber can use to <br>
his/her advantage.<br>
3. can produce accurate, regular times, using fancy equipment (for official <br>
records, etc.)<br>
4. can be imitated at home without too much trouble / inconvenience<br>
<br>
The thing is, we can all cube in our living rooms and have our times, but <br>
there is no harm in trying to get together some sort of official  set of <br>
rules that are sensible, and are not made up by some hack over at Guiness.  <br>
If there was an official society we could work it out through that, but <br>
there is no society at the moment, it seems.<br>
<br>
So, how about this, just to see if the ball can get rolling ...<br>
<br>
1.  The solving of the cube is preceded by a 15 second inspection period <br>
during which time the speedcuber (SC) may examine the cube.<br>
<br>
2.  The cube is not visible to the SC before the 15 second inspection <br>
period.<br>
<br>
3.  The 15 second inspection starts as the SC sees the cube.<br>
<br>
4. The cube starts inside circle 1 (15 cm diameter) that is itself inside <br>
another circle (circle 2, 30 cm diameter), that is on a table (or any flat <br>
surface).<br>
<br>
5. During the 15 second inspection period the cube can be handled and <br>
rotated by the SC but the SC may not move a single face of the cube in any <br>
way, at any time.<br>
<br>
6. Before 15 seconds has elapsed the CS must:<br>
a) return the cube to the inside of circle 1<br>
b) place both hands on the table outside circle 2<br>
<br>
7. If at the moment that the speed time starts, the cube is not inside <br>
circle 1, the SC is disqualified; if any part of the cube is touching circle <br>
2, the SC is disqualified.<br>
<br>
8. If the SC&#x27;s hands are not both placed on the table outside the circle at <br>
the moment that the timer starts, the SC is disqualified.<br>
<br>
9. If any part of the CS&#x27;s hands is inside circle 2 at the moment that the <br>
timer starts, the SC is disqualified.<br>
<br>
10. The 15 second inspection period is followed immediately by the solving <br>
time, without any time laspe.<br>
<br>
11. Once the SC has finished solving the cube the SC places the cube <br>
anywhere inside circle 2<br>
<br>
12. The solving time stops once the cube touches the circle and is no longer <br>
in contact with the SC.<br>
<br>
13. The SC&#x27;s time will be disqualified if:<br>
a) any part of the cube is not inside circle 2 (the area of circle 2 <br>
includes circle 1)<br>
b) there are not four corners touching the surface of circle 2 (i.e. one of <br>
the faces is misalligned)<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">That may be fine and dandy for competition but at home i dont think 
it is really that relevant.  Its just more stress and home solves are 
supposed to be relaxed.  but thats just me.  If i were going to do 
timings of myself and at home i still wouldn&#x27;t use the cirlce thing, 
its just to much to remember and disqualifications is just another 
way to give some one the boot.  Lets not make things too technical
but i also forgot my brain at home today :(

<br>
&quot;oh, i&#x27;m sorry dan, we cannot accept your time of 9.67 seconds, <br>
because the corner of your cube is touching the wrong circle&quot;<br>
<br>
where he places his cube on the table has absolutely no correlation <br>
with how fast he can solve the cube. and who cares where my hands go <br>
after i&#x27;m done? positioning my hands takes time, albeit a small <br>
amount of time. but we&#x27;re timing how long it takes to solve a cube, <br>
not how long it takes to solve a cube and place your hands onto the <br>
table. granted, placing the cube onto a device that stops the clock <br>
takes time as well, but that is a necessary procedure.<br>
<br>
you wouldn&#x27;t tell a quarter-mile sprinter, &quot;the time stops when you <br>
cross the finish line, remove your shoes, retie the laces, then place <br>
your feet within these 2 circles.&quot;<br>
<br>
i understand your desire for a standardized timing procedure...and i <br>
agree it&#x27;s crucial. and i do appreciate the fact you recognized that <br>
tournament timing and home timing are acceptably different scenarios. <br>
but i thought most of the timing bugs (excluding, perhaps, what <br>
exactly constitutes a lucky case) have been worked out. there is a 15 <br>
second study time. then you pick it up, which starts the clock, solve <br>
it, then put it down, which stops the clock. seems pretty good to me.<br>

i&#x27;ve been using a cube that a friend of mine gave me about 2 years <br>
ago...i absolutely love it for speed cubing. it has a great tension <br>
level, and turns very smooth. and i&#x27;ve never done a thing to it. and <br>
the stickers haven&#x27;t even curled!!<br>
<br>
my friend owned a daycare, and one day i noticed it sitting in a box <br>
off toys, and asked for it. she gladly gave it to me. but this has no <br>
relevance to my question.<br>
<br>
the colours are: t=purple, f=green, r=red, l=orange, b=blue, d=yellow<br>
<br>
from this colour scheme, can anyone tell me anything about the cube?<br>

          <div class="email-content">What i found to be a lot better than stickers is model paint.  It is 
a lengthy procedure but definately worth it.  You can spend 5-6 bucks 
and have enough paint to do a bunch of cubes.  I think this is much 
more better than stickers.  But thats just me

I suggest you go to a local sign shop and ask them if you can have or purchase some high performance vinyl film. This is what they use on signs and pinstripes on cars. The sign shop here gave it to me for free, they just made me solve the cube for them a few times. It works great, and the colors come in many different shades. It has yet to wear out at all, it is very light, and you should be able to get enough to resurface a hundred cubes.<br>
<br>
I also tried PlastiCote paint, but it sucked. It was comfortable and it had great grip, but it picked up dirt and dust so much that I nearly ended up with a brown cube before it had a chance to wear out. I love the vinyl film.<br>

I guess you&#x27;re trying to watch it with an &quot;old&quot; divx codec. You need

          <div class="email-content">That almost works, but I think you missed one u&#x27; move, before the <br>
last B2.  I think this is what you meant:<br>
u&#x27;B2-L2u&#x27;L2u&#x27;L2u&#x27;L2u&#x27;-B2dF2d&#x27;B2dF2d&#x27;-u&#x27;B2u<br>
<br>
mrtrickypants, what you&#x27;ve encountered here is the parity problem.  <br>
You can use the alg above (which does exactly what you&#x27;re looking <br>
for) or you could put one of the two edges at the UF position, and <br>
use:<br>
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2<br>
<br>
Then, you should be able to pair them up without a problem.<br>

oh and make sure that the edges are in the FR and FL spots when you 
do this.

I agree much easier than 4x4 but might take more time, because there 
are so many pieces.  It does resemble the 3x3 more than any other 
sized cube.  Also to get it back, I first put in the Corners and 
middle edges, and then assembled it in layers. Once you get one 
layer, put it on a table, and then go up.  
Good luck,

Kenneth

ps when you assemble it, time yourself and post your time, there is a 
record for it at speedcubing.com

Just look for similar colors next to each others (a 2x2x1 corner

A) Place all peices on top face, rotate with corisponding center <br>

<br>
B) Locate peices and move directly to bottom faece.<br>
<br>
B seems faster then A of course but A is a lot easier... for <br>
example.. In A, if you need to move FU to FD and you have the correct <br>
peice in RD, you need to do FRUR&#x27;F2 and that happens alot. Plus it&#x27;s <br>
harder to keep track of the peices on the bottom and locate them. But <br>
in A of course it wastes moves puting them on top THEN bottom, but <br>
the number of moves is almost the same if not less most of time time, <br>
due to that FRUR&#x27;F2 move in A. So which one?<br>

Sorry, I don&#x27;t have anything useful to say as I don&#x27;t understand the 
question. I noticed an unfortunate typographical error in B though 
(and a less unfortunate one).

Can you explain what you mean by the two methods? Which face are you 
solving, top or bottom?

Well the best alg to switch two diagonal corners that I know is: Keep 
the solved 4 corners on D and the ones needing switching in U; R&#x27; F&#x27; 
U&#x27;F U R(6,6).  In your case If they are already oriented, the best I 
know is: With the ones needing switching in the U: R2 U F&#x27;U F U&#x27;R2 
U&#x27;F&#x27;U&#x27;F(11,13)  Although I do not know if they are the best algs, I 
assume they are cuz they are from www.speedcubing.com under the 
corner&#x27;s first algs.  

Some other things to think about.  If you do a two-look approach for 
the corners, what would be better: orientations then permutations? Or 
permutations, then orientations?
While thinking about this I came up with pros and cons for both 
methods.
Orientations then permutation:
7algs for orientation, and 2 algs (one 9 moves, and one 11moves) for 
permutation; 9algs total.  
I think this would be easier to recognize, because for me it is 
easier to recognize the permutations when the corners are already 
oriented.  The down side is the two permutation algs are longer.

Permutations then Orientations:
2 algs (one 7 move, and one 6 move) for Permutation, same 7 algs for 
orientation; 9algs total.
I think this is a little harder to recognize, because one must see 
the permutations with out the comfort of having them already 
oriented.  The good side is that the algs for the permutations are 
much shorter.

Or you could do it all in one step and it would take more time for 
the recognition and 41algs, but would save many moves!

I think I over answered your question, sorry,

-Kenneth

You probably mean this one. I find a 5 move average for the 2x2x2 
hard to believe. I don&#x27;t think I can do better than 6.

From: ilovemycube &lt;clubs-mail@...>
Subject: Tony Snyder&#x27;s system (36 moves!) [Yahoo! Clubs: Speed 
Solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube]

I exchanged e-mails with Anthony Snyder.
His system works like this:
A: 2x2x2 block (same as Lars Petrus)
B: last two edges of first layer
C: last three corner edge pairs of F2L
D: four edges and one corner of top layer
E: last three corners of top layer

According to Tony, this system averages 36 moves. This 36 consists of:
A: 5 moves
B+C: 13 moves
D: 8 moves
E: 10 moves

So Tony builds up two layers in 18 moves!
And his top layer system also takes 18 moves!

Frankly, I find it hard to believe stage B+C can be done in on 
average 13 moves.
In my opinion B would take about 3.5 moves.
And C would take about three quarters of 26 moves, so 19.5 moves. 
That would total 23 moves. Which would still be quite good, because 
added to the 5 moves of stage A, would build up F2L in 28 moves 
(compared to my 32 moves). Cubin4speed and I already discussed this 
system. And I thought it would take about the same number of moves as 
the F2L system.

His top layer system is also interesting. I will try to figure out 
how many different algorithms stage D takes.
Stage E is rather straight forward.

I asked Tony to tell about his secrets on our club. Hopefully he will join us.

On http://www.speedcubing.com I added a page with algorithms for the 
&#x27;corners first&#x27; method. It describes how to solve the corners of the 
top layer in one algorithm. The average number of moves is 8.61. 
These algorithms may disturb the edges of the first two layers. But 
that will not be a problem.
Next step is a list of algorithms for the edges.

Any help to complete my algorithm lists will be appreciated!!! There 
is still a lot to do.

&gt; 1.  I have solved the entire star but the last layer (last star) is<br>
&gt; it possible to know what orientation the missing piece needs to<br>
&gt; be?  <br>
<br>
The star is similar to the Rubik&#x27;s cube - an even number of flips <br>
only. Count how many of the pieces in the last unsolved layer are <br>
flipped (for each piece turn the layer so that that piece is in the <br>
correct position and see if it needs flipping). If this is an odd <br>
number, then the missing piece should be flipped, otherwise it isn&#x27;t.<br>
 <br>
&gt; 2.  Is it possible to glue the broken piece to the puzzle?<br>
Don&#x27;t know.<br>
<br>
&gt; 3.  How do I solve the last layer, is there ever a parity problem?<br>
There can be, since pieces on opposite sides of the puzzle have the <br>
same colours. If the last layer needs two pieces swapped, then you <br>
must swap two identical pieces as well to accomplish this.<br>

Hi Heath,

   I don&#x27;t know whether this is useful to you or not.
   There is a sequence that swaps two adjacent corners keeping them
upright and minimizing changes to the other cubies: R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27;
U R&#x27; U&#x27; L
  If you precede this with L2 B F2 and undo it afterwards F2 B&#x27; L2 you
get the diagonal upright corner swap.

I realize that L2 B F2 R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L F2 B&#x27; L2 is 17
moves, but it&#x27;s clean.

   If you don&#x27;t like 17 moves, I&#x27;ve an 18 move one.try R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27;
L U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27;!

   I&#x27;m still looking for sharter ones that only involve the last level.

Thanks for the replys.  I want this alg for the homer simpson cube 
in particular, thats why i want the shortest alg i can find. (its 
very awkward to turn).  And since its a 2x2 cube you dont have to 
worry about it messing up the edges..

I tried using cube explorer to find the alg, but since you cant 
ignore parts of the cube i&#x27;ll have to try alot of different 
combinations....i found one that was 14 moves.  Then I tried Rons 
cube solver, which would be great because you can ignore parts of 
the cube ya know. but i didnt have time for it to search through all 
the possible combinations...

i think i&#x27;ll keep looking :D

this is just an update on my search for an alg.  and to thank the 
people who posted

starting with a 3 look last layer is good.

speedcubing.com has great algorithms for this method.  Also, look at Dan Knights page.

<br>
At some point in the past, I was trying to improve my 2x2x2 method as <br>
well - I used Ron&#x27;s mini-cube solver, and let it find the shortest <br>
solution, which is unfortunately 11 moves.  What I use is actually <br>
very close to what Kenneth gave.  Here&#x27;s my alg (with trigger <br>
groupings and cube rotations):<br>
(R2 U&#x27;) y (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) y&#x27; (R2 U) y (R U R&#x27;)<br>
<br>
If you don&#x27;t like the fact that there are 3 cube rotations in that, <br>
and don&#x27;t mind D face turns, this is a slight alteration that can be <br>
used instead to eliminate 2 cube rotations:<br>
(R2 D&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; D) (R2 U) y (R U R&#x27;)<br>
<br>
Hope these help.<br>

Hi

I agree 3 look last layer is better choice. 
Because you can develop this to 2 look in future. 
1. orient edges
2. orient corners
3. Permute all.
If you don&#x27;t like the third step, you can try Orient and permute 
corners, Orient and permute edges.  2 steps. 

Acutually, I use the latter method. It is because I already knew most 
of the last step. 
This is an alternative but not many people chose because only a few 
resources are available. 

So in my web site I focused on how to recognize the first step 
(orient and permute corners). Most of the algorythms I learned from 
Ron&#x27;s site. 
Anyway you need to learn more than 40 algorythms!  
Good luck.

Recently, I added small videos of my permution of last edges. 
You can see that from ELL page.

<br>
Hi.  There are lots of ways to solve the last layer in two looks, perhaps <br>
the most obvious four being:<br>
1. orient all, permute all<br>
2. permute all, orient all<br>
3. permute and orient corners, permute and orient edges<br>
4. permute and orient edges, permute and orient corners<br>
<br>
Jessica&#x27;s method (1) actually requires learning a lot more algorithms than <br>
options (2) or (3)!  Despite this, in my opinion it is the superior of the <br>
four listed because the recognition factor is weighted the best.  But that&#x27;s <br>
partly personal, and if you find it really difficult / unintuitive to <br>
identify permutations of corners and edges together, then go for one of the <br>
other two!  Corners first, then edges, is just under half a move quicker, on <br>
average ...<br>
<br>
Details are:<br>
<br>
orient all: 41 algs., average 9.22 moves<br>
permute all: 14 algs., average 11.21 moves<br>
Total: 55 algs, 20.42 moves<br>
<br>
permute all: 14 algs., average 8.10<br>
orient all: 30 algs., average 12.80<br>
Total: 44 algs, 20.90 moves<br>
<br>
permute and orient corners: 25 algs., average 9.18<br>
permute and orient edges: 19 algs., average 11.27<br>
Total: 44 algs., 20.45 moves<br>
<br>
permute and orient edges: 13 algs., average 7.87<br>
permute and orient corners: 42 algs., average 11.73<br>
Total: 55 algs., 19.60 moves<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have a question on the following method:<br>
<br>
&gt; permute and orient corners: 25 algs., average 9.18<br>
&gt; permute and orient edges: 19 algs., average 11.27<br>
&gt; Total: 44 algs., 20.45 moves<br>
<br>
I was wondering why there are only 25 algs for permute and orient the <br>
corners.  Are there only 26 cases for the corners when the f2L are <br>
complete?  The reason I was wondering was, I solve corners first, and <br>
there are 42 algs for me to permute and orient corners. So why is <br>
there a difference?<br>

(B2 R2 U2 B2 R2 B2 R2 B2 R2 U2 R2 B2) for the &quot;+ permutation&quot;. I can&#x27;t
find a shorter sequence. Someone else?

The CubeSolver applet can find solutions for this group within the blink of an<br>
eye.<br>
There are no solutions shorter than 12 moves. But there are hundreds of<br>
solutions of 12 moves.<br>
This is my favorite solution because of the pattern (almost the same as Gilles&#x27;s<br>
solution):<br>
R2F2U2   F2R2F2R2F2R2   U2F2R2 (12,24)<br>
<br>
Another useful algorithm is the edges three cycle (UF, DB, DF):<br>
R2D2R2   F2R2D2R2F2 (8,16)<br>
<br>
In general I use the following solution:<br>
= permute corners<br>
= solve several double pairs of edges (using R2U2R2U2R2U2, M2U2M2U2 and<br>
rotations)<br>
= solve + permutation or 3 cycle<br>

I use two sequences:
1. r2 U2 r2 U r2 U2 r2 U&#x27; where r is the center slice next to R.
Counted in the usual way is 12 moves. If the center slice is equal to
the other layers it&#x27;s only 8 moves.
2. R&#x27; L&#x27; D2 R L U R&#x27; L&#x27; D2 R L U also 12 moves.

   I&#x27;ve used the first one for a long time the second one  for a
shorter time. The second one may prove faster in the long run, but I
don&#x27;t know.

<br>
your posting inspired me to write this message. It seems to me that <br>
a 5 seconds gap between the best time and the second best is too big <br>
for a &quot;legal lucky time&quot;. I am imagining here a fictitious pyramid <br>
of best times that get progressively more frequent as the times <br>
increase. <br>
<br>
I would like to collect some statistical data from all sub-30 cubers <br>
about their shortest times. I will do some statistical analysis of <br>
it and post it here. Here is what I have in mind:<br>
<br>
My best times:<br>
<br>
11-12 2 in 20 years of cubing<br>
12-13 10-15 times in 20 years of cubing<br>
13-14 1 in 50<br>
14-15 1 in 20<br>
15-16 1 in 10<br>
16-17 1 in 5<br>
17-18 1 in 2-3<br>
<br>
Please, post your data (your best guess) so that we can get some <br>
idea about the lucky times and thus have a better understanding of <br>
the chances involved. Thanks!<br>
<br>
Jessica<br>
<br>
&gt; ahh, dont you just hate it when you get a lucky solve!!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; i just solved the cube in 12.76 seconds... 2 look LL, but quite a <br>
&gt; bit of the f2l was already together and all i had to do was place <br>
&gt; it.  I wish this solve wouldnt of been luck. still i almost cant <br>
&gt; believe how fast i got it, it beats my best lucky time by 5 <br>
seconds, <br>
&gt; and my best non lucky time by 6 seconds.  <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; well i guess i just wanted to tell someone about this time <br>
&gt; lol :D...now i gotta try and get that without luck.<br>

Hi, I have some plots of my progress on the web.<br>
* recent plot:  http://www.cc.rim.or.jp/~midorin/mad-p/cube.png<br>
* plot since converting to LBL: http://www.cc.rim.or.jp/~midorin/mad-p/cubeall.png<br>
* real-time for x axis: http://www.cc.rim.or.jp/~midorin/mad-p/cubedate.png<br>
* moving average of 10avg: http://www.cc.rim.or.jp/~midorin/mad-p/avg.png<br>
<br>
I use a tricky (and cheat-ish) algorithm to judge &quot;miss&quot;<br>
records.  First calculate standard deviation.<br>
Mark times slower than 2sd from average as &quot;miss&quot; records;<br>
e.g. poped out and recovered, OLL misrecognition, etc.<br>
Then recalculate average and sd excluding these &quot;misses&quot;.<br>
(What cheat-ish is that I do not exclude the other extreme :P).<br>
<br>
I am also interested in &quot;theoretical&quot; distribution and<br>
how it varies among solving methods.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Maybe this is one for the &quot;Crazy Records&quot;, but I think you&#x27;ll find it an<br>
interesting and complex puzzle in itself:<br>
<br>
How many quarter turns of one face can you perform with both hands fixed<br>
on the cube? That is, without letting go or changing grip?<br>
<br>
I presented this challenge to some friends, first to see if they could<br>
manage just one full turn. They succeeded with not the best grip, so it<br>
was a bit awkward for them. They were totally shocked to see me do two<br>
full turns with complete ease. My most recent record, though, is<br>
actually 3 complete turns, or 12 quarter turns.<br>
<br>
Am I the first person to perform the move &quot;R12&quot;?<br>
<br>
This is really a one-off challenge, so it would be interesting to note,<br>
how many attempts did it take you to reach:<br>
<br>
R4 :<br>
R6 :<br>
R8 :<br>
R10:<br>
R12:<br>

I believe that R16 might be possible (ie. 4 complete turns).<br>

Wow! After trying a bit harder I managed to do R20. That&#x27;s 5 complete<br>
turns. I used a thumb and forefinger grip to do the turning, although my<br>
thumb had to roll sideways 90 degrees to make the last quarter turn. But<br>
R19 can definitely be done without any thumb rolling.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Anyone who looks at Ebay would see the Rubik&#x27;s Cube Atari game for <br>
sale.  I went to Atariage.com and found out that you can download <br>
most of the games as a rom.  So I downloaded it and an emulator, and <br>
it is kind of fun.  I will put them in the file section of the cubic-<br>
puzzles group.<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cubic-puzzles/<br>
<br>
It took me a while to figure out how to play, so if you do play here <br>
is how it works:<br>
First unzip the zip file.  Then drag the .bin file into the .exe <br>
file.  It will then load up.  The game is like taking the stickers <br>
off of a Rubik&#x27;s cube.  The little man has a color.  Move him around <br>
with the up down left right.  When you click he will swap colors with <br>
the color he is on.  You cannot go onto a color that you are.  Hit F1 <br>
to start and hit F2 to change games.  All odd number games count <br>
moves; all even number games are timed.  My favorite game is number <br>
12, because it fast, and it is timed.  I got 2min and 30s can anyone <br>
beat me?<br>

13-14 2 times in 1 year of cubing
14-15 never
15-16 3 times
16-17 5 times
17-18 15 times
18-19 1/30
19-20 1/15
20-22 1/8
22-24 1/3

Btw, I often don&#x27;t agree with the usual definition of &quot;lucky&quot;. Of
course, a skipped step is nice, but &quot;non lucky&quot; configurations can be
very fast too. The best example is Konishi&#x27;s:
http://www5.gateway.ne.jp/~katsu-k/cube_video.html
I consider times as lucky if I can&#x27;t reproduce them at will. They are
outliers regarding standard deviation.
But I think the usual definition makes more sense for sub-20 cubists.

Gilles.

If Ron&#x27;s applet can find a solution to this one, I think I&#x27;ll ask for
the source code to be fixed! ;-)

Great to read that the show was aired. Is there someone who
has it on VHS? If not, a file on CD would be great as well.
I have never seen the show which was produced two years ago
when there were only about 5 people who have ever done a
cube blindfolded. It&#x27;s great to see the increasing number
in the unofficial record list.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan,<br>
<br>
I would like to thank you very very much for making this all possible.<br>
Congratulations on this fantastic achievement! You make miracles happen. Also<br>
many thanks to the sponsors.<br>
<br>
To all other cubists:<br>
I can&#x27;t wait to meet you all. You are not alone ;-) There are more stupid<br>
guys/girls like us, wasting their time with puzzling.<br>
If you are still in doubt about joining the event: make a decision! You don&#x27;t<br>
want to miss it all, and then afterwards hear all the attendants talk about how<br>
great it was! It will be a life time memory. Of course we all want to win, but<br>
there will also be lots of fun for those who are not capable of winning. And<br>
remember that competitions are different from cubing at home: anything can<br>
happen.<br>
So go to http://www.rubikswc2003.com and register.<br>
<br>
I will fly over to Toronto a few days before the event. So maybe we can have<br>
some kind of pre-event or warming-up.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

<br>
Our recommended hotel for the championships is the Holiday Inn:<br>

<br>
DO NOT BOOK HERE YET AS WE ARE NEGOTIATING A SPECIAL RATE FOR <br>

Holiday Inn Toronto-Don Valley<br>
1100 Eglinton Avenue East, Toronto, Ontario, M3C 1H8<br>
visit our website at www.holidayinndonvalley.com<br>
<br>
<br>
This hotel is on the corner of Eglinton Ave and Don Mills Road....5 <br>
minute walk to venue....<br>
<br>
<br>
I would strongly advise everyone to print a copy of the venue site at <br>
www.osc.ca<br>
<br>
<br>
The venue will be formally making the announcement of our event on <br>
their web site once the contract is fully signed etc....<br>
<br>
<br>
any question please contact me...<br>
<br>
oh by the way......2 months ago I was asked by my colleague the <br>
purpose of the different age categories for the event...as one of you <br>
out there had an issue surrounding that.<br>
<br>
my response is as follows:<br>
<br>
if we have 100 people coming from all parts of the world WHY would <br>
they come all the way over to Canada with a chance of them leaving <br>
here with nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
The reason for the grouping was to have more of an opportunity to <br>
walk away being a winner.<br>
<br>
therefore if we group into 3 categories we now have 4 winners ie<br>
<br>
3 winners of each category along with an overall champion in addition <br>
to individual awards for acheivements etc.<br>
<br>
This way we give everyone more of a chance. One thing i am creating <br>
is a Rubik&#x27;s Gift pac for all competitors which will see <br>
memorabilia,tee shirts and other items..<br>
<br>
therefore 1: everyone walks away a winner and there are more chances <br>
to cash in on a larger prize.....<br>
<br>
<br>
We had to do it this way to make everyone happy and to get more <br>
people to come(hence the need for more variance in prizes).<br>
<br>
If anyone has any other items we should be aware of please contact us <br>
at wc2003@....<br>
<br>
<br>
all for now...<br>

check the layout of the Imperial Oil Auditorium. Contestants will be <br>
house underkneath the stands...fyi...away from the audience...<br>
<br>
and I have successfully designed a podium where contestants WILL NOT <br>
SEE the spectators. Only the spectators will see the contestants.<br>
<br>
ie you will be behind the glass(1 way).....<br>
<br>
this should reduce the nerves for those who fall into that category.<br>

I plan to go to Toronto, but not to compete in speedcubing. My

   I don&#x27;t know if these times count because I&#x27;m not back up to speed
yet. I didn&#x27;t track lucky times. 

   After about 11 months of cubing in August of 1982:

15-18 a handful of times
18-19 5 times
20-22 1/10
22-24 3/20
24-26 1/4
26-28 2/5

who has the means to go, definitely should.  Yeah the competitions 
are going to be cool and exciting, but meeting all the other cube 
people that you know will be even cooler and more exciting.  This is 
definitely going to be a life memory for everyone who goes.  That

who has the means to go, definitely should.  Yeah the competitions 
are going to be cool and exciting, but meeting all the other cube 
people that you know will be even cooler and more exciting.  This is 
definitely going to be a life memory for everyone who goes.  That 
being said if there&#x27;s a get-together a few days before with Ron, I&#x27;ll 
definitely come a few days early to be a part of that.

Can&#x27;t wait to meet you guys,

     Is anyone here working out their own sequences/algs etc, and not

   Did I understand you correctly a while back that you&#x27;re halfway
through the algorithms you are memorising? How many are there?
   Which is your LL strategy?

 Ryan Heise &lt;rheise@...> wrote:Maybe this is one for the &quot;Crazy Records&quot;, but I think you&#x27;ll find it an
interesting and complex puzzle in itself:

How many quarter turns of one face can you perform with both hands fixed
on the cube? That is, without letting go or changing grip?

I presented this challenge to some friends, first to see if they could
manage just one full turn. They succeeded with not the best grip, so it
was a bit awkward for them. They were totally shocked to see me do two
full turns with complete ease. My most recent record, though, is
actually 3 complete turns, or 12 quarter turns.

Am I the first person to perform the move &quot;R12&quot;?

This is really a one-off challenge, so it would be interesting to note,
how many attempts did it take you to reach:

R4 :
R6 :
R8 :
R10:
R12:

I believe that R16 might be possible (ie. 4 complete turns).

Discover the complexity of this unlikely puzzle!

comfortable with left hand as well as right hand (i&#x27;m
not ambidextrous) while cubing, I&#x27;m making up my own

need to).  As for perms, Ross Palmer&#x27;s list is pretty
much dead on for right handers.

Thank you very much.

By the way: next week, I will be in another German TV show together
with Dror Vomberg from Israel who is also one of the fastest blindfold

&gt;Hi Simon,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    Did I understand you correctly a while back that you&#x27;re halfway<br>

<br>
Hi David.  I am just a sheep, following in the paths of the mighty --  I am <br>
learning Jessica&#x27;s system and ... I am almost there!!!  Only THREE <br>
orientation algorithms to go!!  As far as how many algorithms, I am not <br>
sure:<br>
f2l: they are not really algorithms, but if you call them that then about 60 <br>
or so<br>
oll: about 65 (there are only 59 but I have learnt a few extras to avoid <br>
cube rotations, so still 3 to go)<br>
pll: about 25 (only 21 but again have learnt a few extras)<br>
... so that&#x27;s a rough total of about 145 algorithms.<br>
<br>
It will be sooo good to complete f2l and know that a solved state is only 2 <br>
looks away.  Also, I can&#x27;t wait to get back to f2l, although I must say that <br>
I am starting to enjoy the orientation algorithms, they&#x27;re kind of neat.<br>
<br>
The other thing is, I have not yet actually started to experiment proper <br>
with speedcubing: right from the start I have always just concentrated on <br>
developing a relaxed, smooth technique, and my times are hovering around the <br>
35 second mark. (I am tackling the cube the same way that I would prepare <br>
very fast piece of music).  Anyway, sometime soon I am going to start <br>
cranking up the speed, and that should be excellent fun.  But for now, <br>
patience, and finish of these orientation algorithms.<br>

Hi Kenneth.  

I think I know why there is a differece: I am using &quot;algorithms&quot; more
widely than you are.  There are 25 algorithms, but you will need to
also execute inversions and reflections with some of them to resolve
all possible cube states.  Presumably if you include inversions and
reflections the number rises to 42?

about 2 or 3 seconds better each month!  Here&#x27;s the breakdown for the <br>

I play the sax too. Played it for band in school, I didnt take band 
this year so i might be a little out of practice.  I started off 
playing alto, but the last couple years I played almost all bari sax

          <div class="email-content">Hi Justin,

   You wrote, > Who has the time for that? &lt; 

   Excellent question. I&#x27;ve thought about it and the answer seems
anything but simple.

   I&#x27;m not sure at all that it would be any faster for me to learn
what others have worked out. 

   On the other hand, there is enough variation in the way people
learn that I can&#x27;t say that any one thing is automatically true. Some
people might learn more quickly figuring it out themselves.

   As to how much time anyone has to do this at all, I can&#x27;t say. The
world nowadays seems made up of people who don&#x27;t have enough time. You
make time for what you want, and some of that depends on your
timetable. Are you aiming for August or have you given yourself more
time than that to get sub 20 seconds?

   I hope I have confused the issue thoroughly! :)

Yes and it does. It&#x27;s a lot smoother. Still no high speed moves 
though.

one time i memorized a certain solution to a particular scramble, 
about 35 moves long, in around 17 seconds...not really an alg 
though, because i couldn begin to so it now......but i knew it for a 
lil while :D

For a 2nx2nx2n it would be at least 24n-22 moves. For a (2n+1)x(2n+1)
x(2n+1) cube it would be at least 24n-14 moves. (Larger of course 
for 2x2x2 and 3x3x3).
I&#x27;d rarely get a chance to use such long moves though. I&#x27;ve never 
had to use the 218 move algorithm in solving a 20x20x20 for 
instance, but I know it for if the situation should arise.

Oh dear, memorization is a dirty word in my vocabulary. :-) In cube 
art, you  need thre things:
* set of sequences to move the cubies around
* those zequences are used to build patterns oin individual cubes
* make sure there is a proper match from cube to cube (particularly 
vicious for 3D non-cubical designs, such as Vasarely)
To acommodate those needs, you don&#x27;t memorize, you visualize. And 
don&#x27;t you dare  to peel patches off mabually and rearrange them 
manually, because I say so! And, far more importantly, because such 
mishandling could very easily produce a pattern that ius not in the 
Rubik&#x27;s cube group! That is not cube art at all.
You start with a solved cube. That means you have to be a cubist, 
although you don&#x27;t have to be as fast.
Now, I wonder why there are so few cube artists, and even fewer 3D 
Rubik&#x27;s cube designers?

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

The longest sequence that I memorized is: F&#x27;RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;BU2B&#x27;UFBL&#x27;D2LDF&#x27;D2FD&#x27;B&#x27;
(20,24). It is the first nice pattern that I learned in 1981. Years later I
still know and use the algorithm, even though it is not optimal. The stupid
thing is that I learned this algorithm by saying it loud. I can only execute it
while saying it softly.

Of course I know much longer sequences, but these are not algorithms. They are
more like easy regular ways to achieve something without learning a difficult
but shorter algorithm. Actually for most other puzzles I always look for easy to
remember sequences, hardly ever for shorter ones.

My favorite long sequence is: (M2UM2D&#x27;)3 x&#x27; (M2UM2D&#x27;)3 ME&#x27;M&#x27;E M2E2S2 which is
(slice 31, full 50, quarter 80). With this sequence you can fool someone who
just learned the easy M2E2S2 pattern.

Btw. This week speedcubing.com welcomed its 100,000 visitor since the start. We
had visitors from 127 countries. Thanks to all! Cubing is alive!

Have fun,

Ron

I&#x27;m sure this depends on how much your puzzle has been used (and <br>

Thanks- I&#x27;ve had it since christmas and it&#x27;s pretty used, but not 
really loose. It moved really quick after lubing- almost faster than 
the cube I have that I just lubed on the same day. :)

There&#x27;s a limit, but it&#x27;s big, at least assuming all the algorithms 
have finite length then there can only be countably many algorithms 
and finitely manyones with distinct effects.

          <div class="email-content">Short answer? About 90-100 for just the 3x3x3, with a total of around <br>
130-135 including other size cubes and the megaminx.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s the long answer - for the 3x3x3, I memorized:<br>
 - 5 algs for the F2L (for cases where edge and corner are already in<br>
   position), although I know how to solve the other 36 cases (I just<br>
   didn&#x27;t memorize any algs for them)<br>
 - 7 for LL corner orientation<br>
 - 3 for LL edge orientation<br>
 - 11 other LL orientation cases (I think)<br>
 - 21 permutations<br>
<br>
So, I know and use 47 total algs for the 3x3x3 - 83 if you count the <br>
other F2L stuff that I didn&#x27;t really memorize, but can still do. <br>
Additionally, there are things like the checkerboard pattern, or <br>
other algs that I don&#x27;t use during a solution, which would probably <br>
add no more than about 5 or 10 to this number.  There are a few LL <br>
permutations which I can do in a couple different ways, especially <br>
depending on whether I&#x27;m doing a real cube, or an applet cube.  <br>
Throwing this all together, I&#x27;d say about 90-100 algs for the 3x3x3, <br>
if you count everything.<br>
<br>
For the 2x2x2 cube, I use a different approach, and some different <br>
algs, but I&#x27;d say it probably only adds about 5 permutation cases and <br>
2 or 3 orientation cases.  For larger cubes, there are 2 parity algs, <br>
plus 3-4 different algs that I use to piece together centers and <br>
edges.  So for all cubes, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m at a total of around 110-115.<br>
<br>
If you add non-cubes to the mix (specifically the megaminx), then <br>
I&#x27;ve got some more:<br>
 - 3 LL edge orientation algs (though two translate directly from the<br>
   cube, so they aren&#x27;t extras)<br>
 - 5 LL edge permutations (though they are all very similar, so they<br>
   should hardly count separately)<br>
 - 8 LL corner orientations<br>
 - 4 LL corner permutations (though, like the edge permutations, they<br>
   are very similar, and should hardly count as more than 1)<br>
This adds 20, so I guess that in total, I&#x27;m up to around 130-135 algs <br>
for my puzzles.<br>

I had a super 2x2x2 from Rubik&#x27;s. I discovered too late it was
assembled with glue and you can&#x27;t take it apart without breaking it.

I&#x27;ve caclulated PI into 3 million digits, and i even printed it out (40 some pages front and back with size 2 for the letters).  Really, i think the world record for the most digits being memorized was by a chinese or japanese guy who memorized thousands (iv&#x27;e read it somewhere)  and there is even a PI day!  (3.14- 3rd month, 14th day, or March 14).  i&#x27;ve calculated PI into 15 million once, but it froze up my computer every time i tried to print it out.<br>

Its also coming up this year too. It was fun. I got a piece of pie and 3 dollars and 14 cents. lol Fun, fun times... well any way i memorized them in sets of 5. pretty easy, i memorized the 75 digits the day i went to school to do the contest.

I want to say Katsu&#x27;s 6 sec video is not lucky case according to the 
current unofficial rule. But this attempt does not match the criteria 
of No.4 (All record times must be achieved on a thoroughly and 
randomly scrambled puzzle.)
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/records-rules.html
That&#x27;s why he does not post this record. 
He tried how fast he can solve 3x3x3 physically in some condition. 

I know Jessica should post this. 
I just did some math. 
These records are from top 5 averages of 3x3x3. 
I agree with Gilles SD is mathematically reasonable. 
But some people can solve consistently. 
(I mean very small SD. )
So 70-75% of best average seems reasonable time for the best.

is a story how some MIT students went to Vegas and won millions of <br>

cool thing is that I think speedcubers would be very good at card <br>
counting.  Here is an excerpt from the book where Kevin, the main <br>
character, is learning how to count cards, and it starts to become an <br>
obsession: &quot;Five Hours a day, seven days a week, Kevin matched high <br>
and low cards, then divided by the number of decks left in the shoe.  <br>
Over and over again until the technique became more instinct than <br>
skill.&quot;  Sounds familiar doesn&#x27;t it.  Anyway if anyone wants to go <br>

  I am reading a book called Bring Down the House, by: Ben Mezrich.  It <br>
  is a story how some MIT students went to Vegas and won millions of <br>
  Dollars by counting cards.  It is very easy and fun reading.  The <br>
  cool thing is that I think speedcubers would be very good at card <br>
  counting.  Here is an excerpt from the book where Kevin, the main <br>
  character, is learning how to count cards, and it starts to become an <br>
  obsession: &quot;Five Hours a day, seven days a week, Kevin matched high <br>
  and low cards, then divided by the number of decks left in the shoe.  <br>
  Over and over again until the technique became more instinct than <br>
  skill.&quot;  Sounds familiar doesn&#x27;t it.  Anyway if anyone wants to go <br>
  make some money in Vegas, and wants to make a counting team, I turn <br>
  21 in October, so give me a call.  :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, back in 8th grade (around 6 years ago now) in a single night I memorized 60 decimal places of pi for the heck of it.  I can rattle these 60 off without thinking at all.  If I type it into a keypad I can get as far as 80 sometimes.  I have memorized up to 100 places but I forget it in a matter of days.  But the first 60 are cemented into my head for some reason:
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944/592306 the / comes after the 60th place and then I went as far as I could without expending any mental effort.  I think the first couple numbers have a nice rythm first with a kind of &quot;bouncing&quot; 5&#x27;s : 15926535 then &quot;bouncing&quot; 9&#x27;s:8979 then 3&#x27;s 323 and so on.  Just find the natural rythm of the numbers.  Maybe I should try memorizing some more....  Thanks a lot, that&#x27;s all I need is another obsession (or rather a rekindled old obsession) to take away from memorizing my cube algorithms.
Might also be of interest to you that one day in 8th grade, sitting in my earth science class, I memorized the periodic table to the end of the lanthanide series.  Same thing with them, i can ramble those off in my sleep if I feel like it, but I can&#x27;t seem to get anything after the lanthanides to stick!  Weird.  Good luck to you!

  this is really off topic i know, but I remember a few people in this 
  club(back before our archives got deleted by the switch to yahoo 
  groups) said they had memorized pi to quite a few decimal places.  
  Well i kinda wanna c how many i can memorize (and sorta have a bet 
  with some one).  so how hard is it to learn 100 decimal places? Any 
  tips from anyone here who has done it? 

  I know to not just learn them as 100 separate numbers, but to make 
  them more like triggers on the cube :D (hey atleast i mentioned the 
  cube in this post) 
  but im sure some of you guys can give me a little more help.

  i found a site that has pi to 50,000 decimal points!  So im sure im 
  not going to run out of numbers to learn :D

  thanks in advance

830 places learn them in batches of 10 (3-3-4). Sometimes you get 
palindromes or squares or primes. You can learn them pretty fast.

You can get it to a few hundred million places if you look around. 
There used to be a site with over 6 billion places but I don&#x27;t know 
if it still exists.

          <div class="email-content">I know an alg that is 30 moves. It&#x27;s one that I learnt about 15 years 
ago and for some reason it stuck in my head, despite the fact that I

I&#x27;m doing the LL then I can always avoid it.

It&#x27;s an LL edge alg which flips two opposite edges and leaves the 
rest of the cube intact. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a more efficient alg which 
does the same thing but I&#x27;m too slack to check! Dearie me. I&#x27;ll never

          <div class="email-content">When I solve, I don&#x27;t really think of F2L as solved by algs, just by 
intuition so I have no idea how many &#x27;algs&#x27; I&#x27;d use there.

For the LL I know about 10 (this doesn&#x27;t include inversions). The way 
I solve is a fairly minimalist approach. I have 4 main LL algs. Any 
LL state can be solved with a combinations of these algs (including 
repetitions and inversions of the 4 main algs). The other half dozen 
algs just mean that I can solve certain cases a little faster.

It doesn&#x27;t seem like many algs, but if I&#x27;m warmed up and &#x27;in the 
zone&#x27;, I can get under a minute with this minimalist approach. If I 
wanted to get down to under 40s then I&#x27;d definitely have to expand my 
alg repertoire, but I don&#x27;t think I have the commitment for that at 
the moment!

  Why would someone want to learn the decimals of PI?!?

  (if you want to decimals of 4/3, maybe I can help you)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine,

   There&#x27;s a generic sequence for flipping two edges.

   Instead of giving you specifics I&#x27;ll try to put this in English. :)

   Turn one side to put one of the last level edges on the middle
level. Moving only the middle level, remove the edge piece from that
side. Flip that side over. Moving only the middle level replace the
edge piece to its place on that side. Turn that side to return the
edge (and its two corners) to the LL.

   Rotate LL to put the other edge piece to be flipped on that side.

   Do in reverse what you did to the first edge.

   I hope my description works.

I agree - I actually stopped doing it for a while (call me lazy), but <br>
it&#x27;s great to see more participation again.  I thought for those who <br>
may not know about it, this would be a good opportunity to provide <br>
some information and a link.<br>
<br>
Basically, each week, there is a set of 13 scrambling algorithms.  Go <br>
to the page, use the scrambling algs provided, and time yourself (13 <br>
are provided, in case you pop on one of the first 12).  The results <br>
are posted by the middle of the week, as well as the scrambling algs <br>
for the following Sunday contest.  For more information or rules, or <br>
to participate, go to:<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
I want to add another point to this discussion.<br>
You could learn several algorithms for each case of a step, and try to achieve<br>
an easier next step. You could f.e. orient all LL edges while solving the last<br>
corner/edge pair of F2L. Most of the time these new algorithms are longer on<br>
average than the shortest algorithm for each case of a step. But the benefit<br>
could be that either the next step is easy (in this case the corner orientations<br>
are easy) or that you could even skip the next step (you will have a bigger<br>
chance of skipping the OLL).<br>
I have been working on such improvements and the things I have noticed are:<br>
1) I have many more (what Jessica calls) &quot;spikes&quot;: very good times, several<br>
seconds better than the normal averages. If I get the cases that I already know,<br>
then I have a 1 in 12 chance of skipping PLL.<br>
2) Anticipating the next step takes some extra time. Most of the time a second<br>
or so. But after a looooooooooooot of practice it should be possible to get this<br>
second down to almost zero.<br>
At the moment the spikes and the extra anticipation almost cancel each other.<br>
But the SD will be influenced by the spikes. I am not sure if in the end these<br>
extra tricks will pay off. I hope so!!!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>

http://www.speedcubing.com<br>
<br>
&gt; I want to say Katsu&#x27;s 6 sec video is not lucky case according to the<br>
&gt; current unofficial rule. But this attempt does not match the criteria<br>
&gt; of No.4 (All record times must be achieved on a thoroughly and<br>
&gt; randomly scrambled puzzle.)<br>
&gt; http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/records-rules.html<br>
&gt; That&#x27;s why he does not post this record.<br>
&gt; He tried how fast he can solve 3x3x3 physically in some condition.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I know Jessica should post this.<br>
&gt; I just did some math.<br>
&gt; These records are from top 5 averages of 3x3x3.<br>
&gt; I agree with Gilles SD is mathematically reasonable.<br>
&gt; But some people can solve consistently.<br>
&gt; (I mean very small SD. )<br>
&gt; So 70-75% of best average seems reasonable time for the best.<br>

  this is really off topic i know, but I remember a few people in this 
  club(back before our archives got deleted by the switch to yahoo 
  groups) said they had memorized pi to quite a few decimal places.  
  Well i kinda wanna c how many i can memorize (and sorta have a bet 
  with some one).  so how hard is it to learn 100 decimal places? Any 
  tips from anyone here who has done it? 

  I know to not just learn them as 100 separate numbers, but to make 
  them more like triggers on the cube :D (hey atleast i mentioned the 
  cube in this post) 
  but im sure some of you guys can give me a little more help.

  i found a site that has pi to 50,000 decimal points!  So im sure im 
  not going to run out of numbers to learn :D

  thanks in advance

  -Heath

Speed cubing is the oldest discipline in Cubreland, but others are 
emerging. Cube art and computer  stuff are examples. The former is my 
discipline, and the latter refers to computer programs written by 
people dealing with the cube. There is also recreational mathematics, 
dealing wuth application of mathematical reasoning to solving Rubik&#x27;s 
games and other puzzles.

Maybe it is wrong of me to say so, but speed cubing is tge most 
obvious challenge and therefore the most developed. You need two 
things: a fast algorithm and a fast cube. Beyond that, it is the sill 
of the speed cubist to beat the others in a setting, where 
miliseconds may cout, such as in Toronto. To be able to contribute to 
the other areas, one has to be a cubist (not neccessarily a 
speedcubist) PLUS possess some specialized knowlrdge (computer 
programming, mathematics) that will be needed in those disciplines.

On a side note I finally solved the bandaged cube for the first 
time!!  I&#x27;m so happy!  I&#x27;ve had it for a while, but never worked on 
it seriously until yesterday actually.  I got a lot of ideas for it 
and today, when I picked it up, I was able to do it!  I&#x27;m afraid to 
scramble it again but I know I have to :)  So anyway just a random

Please. That would be silly. More than 220 million is not useful.

Hi Chris,

Seen on speedcubing.com: &quot;December 16, 2002 Chris Hardwick solved a
Rubik&#x27;s cube blindfolded using his normal solving system. Amazing!&quot;

So, you can do it or not?

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">What I did for that blindfolded solve (using my normal system) was to 
lay a coordinate system on the cube
ULB is &quot;1&quot;
UB is &quot;2&quot;
UBR is &quot;3&quot;
UL is &quot;4&quot;
UR is &quot;5&quot;
UFL is &quot;6&quot;
DLB is &quot;7&quot;
DB is &quot;8&quot;
DBR is &quot;9&quot;
DL is &quot;10&quot;
DR is &quot;11&quot;
DFL is &quot;12&quot;
DF is &quot;13&quot;
DFR is &quot;14&quot;
FL is &quot;15&quot;
FR is &quot;16&quot;
BL is &quot;17&quot;
BR is &quot;18&quot;

I don&#x27;t memorize any information for UF and UFR because I can infer 
their location and orientation before I do the OLL based on the 
positions and orientations of the pieces I have memorized.

The first letter of the location represents where I place the 
number.  So when the cube is scrambled, white is the bottom color, 
and I see the DB piece (the DB piece when solved) is in FR, and I see 
the white sticker of that piece is on the R face, then in the FR 
slot, on the right face side of that piece I memorize the number 8.  
I do the same for each piece.  So on the scrambled cube I have 18 
numbers memorized in various locations.  Then each time I turn a face 
I shuffle the numbers of the 8 pieces on that slice in my head.  So 
if I do the move &quot;R&quot; then UFR moves to UBR, UR moves to BR, etc..  I 
would either do that for each turn or for several turns in a group 
(like PLL and OLL).  That&#x27;s how I did that solve.  I didn&#x27;t plan the 
solution at all before I started.  All I did before I put the 
blindfold on was to memorize the position the cube was in.

What I meant by my last post is that I definitely cannot plan the 
entire solution to a cube before I start.  All I meant to say was 
that for the first 6 pieces I solve when I speed solve, that I am 
getting better at planning the solution to those and only those 6 
pieces.  Sorry if what I said was confusing.

I often get confused by very simple things, *I* am sorry.
Now it&#x27;s clear, thanks, and still quite impressive!!

But if you can solve the cube blindfolded using your normal technique,
then maybe you can just do it virtually in your head, remember the 50
moves you do, and forget all but this sequence (remember macros, of
course). Then solve the cube very fast.
Ok ok, it would take more than the minute James was dreaming about ;-)

          <div class="email-content">This sounds familiar David J. I remember someone showing me a more

useful algs. One of them was an adjacent corner swap and the other (I

forgot about the opposite edge flip.

I was getting a bit confused by your description. I followed the gist 
of it enough for it to seem kinda familiar, but not enough to 
actually implement it properly. Perhaps you could give me the 
notation? And the orientation of the cube at the start of the alg 
(eg. hold the cube with the two edges to be flipped in the left/right 
of the top layer)

Thanks. :)

Do you have a home page?

I think David means the following algorithm:
LEL2E2L (now the edge at UL is flipped)
U2 (prepare another edge, in this case UR)
L&#x27;E2L2E&#x27;L&#x27; (inverse of 1st part)
U2 (correction move)

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hey, it works! Thanks guys. Now that I&#x27;ve tried the alg with my cube 
using Ron&#x27;s notation, I understand David&#x27;s explanation in prose. :)

As for your other question Ron, the answer is &#x27;sort of&#x27;. I don&#x27;t 
really have a site in the way that many other people here have a 
site. I have a random collection of links and pages. A few years ago 
a thought it would be good to learn HTML so I signed up for some 
cyberspace with Yahoo and started experimenting. I didn&#x27;t really have 
anything I particularly wanted to say online, so the webpages were 
just a means to an end (ie. learn HTML).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine,

   I use a slightly different notation from Ron&#x27;s cause I can never
remember what his middle layer slice letters mean.

   I use r for the slice next to R, u for the slice under U, and b for
the slice in front of B. Using Q for &quot;cube&quot; I also use QR, QU, and QB
for rotating the whole cube.

   So the notation for the two flip I described is R&#x27;u R2 u2 R&#x27; (then
U, U2 or U&#x27;)  R u2 R 2u&#x27; R (U&#x27;, U2 or U).

   Another quick one of the same length I know for flipping two across
from each other on the same level is r U r U r U2 r&#x27; U r&#x27; U r&#x27; U2.
This one seems quicker for the hands than the other.

I made a solve today of 25 seconds, but I didn&#x27;t even have to do a permutation OR an orientation, so the possibility of this lucky case is very rare.

Sunny days will come back soon, and I&#x27;ll have other things to do.
But everyone can do this, all you need is a low-end video camera and a
free evaluation version of a video editing software.
Anyone?

ok....everyone calm down...i found the site i was looking for.
it was hiding at the very obvious website -- puzzlesolver.com

phew!

btw: just got back from the domincan (a moment to brag)...while i was

wondering how many of you have worked with a cube like this (textured 
somehow), and what your times are.

a Braille Rubiks Cube for blind people. It didn&#x27;t work very well,

<br>
Being one of the moderators of this club, I decided to delete some <br>
recent and older posts on the message board. Messages on this club <br>
will be found by search engines, years after, so any private or <br>
personal talks will not be allowed.<br>
<br>
There are some unwritten rules here:<br>
= we are all friends, and our club is supposed to be fun<br>
= our club is about (speed) cubing, so please try to stay on topic<br>
= some off topic posts are allowed of course, if at least a little <br>
related to cubing<br>
= the message board is not a chatroom nor an e-mail system<br>
<br>
Oh wait: now we have some written rules ;-)<br>
<br>
Thanks to all people who are helping each other.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope we will have a great cube season!<br>
The chat room is getting busier and busier, with new guys on the <br>
block. Please join us during the weekends. It is fun, and you can <br>
learn a lot from other guys.<br>

Have fun,<br>

interest in the cube.  I&#x27;ve tried all the helpful hints from <br>
everyone.  As far as lubrication goes, the only thing i use now is <br>
silicone spray, which is not uncommon among speed cubers.  Every <br>
month or so I swab my cube with the silicone.  Also comes the <br>
problem of stickers coming off.  The idea of using the  model paint <br>
in place of the stickers is definetly a good one.  Anyways, getting <br>
to the point.  I&#x27;m designing a prep. kit for the cube which would <br>
include silicone spray and the paints.  There are a few more <br>
additions i&#x27;m making to it, but i would love to get some advice and <br>
feedback on what should go in the prep kit. thnx to all <br>

This is an unfortunate rumor/misunderstanding.  If you can solve the <br>
cube, come to the world championships, and you will be able to <br>
compete.  To paraphrase the main organizer - &quot;anyone I see walk in <br>
the door with a cube in their hand is getting up on stage to <br>
compete&quot; - so there it is.  You will set a time when you get there, <br>
so as to have competitors of similar abilities competing together.<br>

If you have an assembley cube like me I think you have to get a new one. In Sweden I can buy them for about us$4 so I just buy new ones now and then. If you have a cube with springs I guess you can just tighten them.

I am with Grant on this. I will not walk into the  championship with 
one cube, but with a suitcase full of them. Do do and display 3D 
designs I have no choice. I would love to bring just one (or even 
fve) cubes, but alas, you cannot do 3D designns from five cubes. You 
need minimum eight cubes. Designs from 8 cubes are raher  boring, and 
if there is just one soul I may impress, I have to do it with at 
least 27 cubes, so as to have corners, edges and centers present. 
Actually, if the design ia to be &quot;interesting&quot; I hav to bring far 
more than that. :-(

I use Solder Seal Gunk silicone spray, sold in the Home Depot. It&#x27;s also
excellent for lubing. I use the method on Ton&#x27;s Puzzle Building Corner and
it works great.

The same thing happened to me (with ACE brand). With enough brute
force, I was able to turn each of the faces, breaking the bonds the
lube had formed.  The cube works great now.  I doubt that you have
ruined the cube.

My theory is that there was some residue in the cube, either from old
lubricant or worn down pieces, that turned into cement when added to
the lube.  Perhaps cleaning out the cube well before lubricating will
help me in the future.

          <div class="email-content">Funny you should mention that, I just made a 3x3x3 textured cube.  The textures include: sponge, sandpaper, velcro, cotton, foam, and felt.  I haven&#x27;t even had it for 24 hours, but I had the idea over a few months ago.  I just timed myself and for my 3rd or so time solving it I got a 4:45, very very slow, but I wasn&#x27;t exactly turning on the juice or anything.  I&#x27;ll practice some and post an average for you later.  For the record my regular 3x3x3 record hovers around 35-40 seconds.

  ok....everyone calm down...i found the site i was looking for.
  it was hiding at the very obvious website -- puzzlesolver.com

  phew!

  btw: just got back from the domincan (a moment to brag)...while i was 
  laying on the beach, i worked on my &quot;braille&quot; cube. was a perfect 
  time to do it...just lying there with my eyes closed anyway. my 1st 
  attempt was really slow, cause i kept falling asleep. but just 
  wondering how many of you have worked with a cube like this (textured 
  somehow), and what your times are.

          <div class="email-content">Official color scheme can be found in the legal section of the 
Rubiks.com site. Official color scheme has been in effect since 2000.

Stickers will be supplied to contestants. no paint. paint is not a 
part of an official Rubik&#x27;s product.

No registration deadline however i would suggest signing up asap for 
hotel rooms rates.

won&#x27;t different color orientations make it alot easier for some, and

alot easier to see the exact cubie that you want. I once saw a

it. LOL
By the way, will the competition cubes be &#x27;studio cubes&#x27;? I&#x27;m also

          <div class="email-content">I just did a run of 12 solves all with my eyes closed, 10 second inspection time on all.  I lubed the cube too before this run, which may have been a factor in the much faster times than I previously posted.  Also I was using a First layer, second layer, last layer method, but I moved on to a F2l, LL method.  This proved much easier than I thought it would be blind.  Anyway, here are my times:

3:02.20 High, Discarded

An interesting challeng indeed!  Anyone who can should try it.

  Funny you should mention that, I just made a 3x3x3 textured cube.  The textures include: sponge, sandpaper, velcro, cotton, foam, and felt.  I haven&#x27;t even had it for 24 hours, but I had the idea over a few months ago.  I just timed myself and for my 3rd or so time solving it I got a 4:45, very very slow, but I wasn&#x27;t exactly turning on the juice or anything.  I&#x27;ll practice some and post an average for you later.  For the record my regular 3x3x3 record hovers around 35-40 seconds.

    ok....everyone calm down...i found the site i was looking for.
    it was hiding at the very obvious website -- puzzlesolver.com

    phew!

    btw: just got back from the domincan (a moment to brag)...while i was 
    laying on the beach, i worked on my &quot;braille&quot; cube. was a perfect 
    time to do it...just lying there with my eyes closed anyway. my 1st 
    attempt was really slow, cause i kept falling asleep. but just 
    wondering how many of you have worked with a cube like this (textured 
    somehow), and what your times are.

not that i think it would make a huge difference on your times or 
anything, but just a small point; i don&#x27;t think you should have an 
inspection time. unless you mean a 10 second inspection time while 
your eyes are closed...which may have been what you meant. pick up 
cube, close eyes, mix like crazy, inspect, solve, open eyes...cheer

at least that&#x27;s how i do it

and nice times btw. mine aren&#x27;t that fast yet. of course, i&#x27;ve only 
done the thing on the beach, topped up with dominican rum...and no 
watch...

Wait  a minute! I wouldn&#x27;t call those designs spectacular. I am 
looking for people who can do that. I hope to find them in Toronto. I 
seem to be unable to find them on the Web. But thanks, anyway.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, my inspection times are not visual.   I use the Ultimate Rubik&#x27;s Cube Timer, I scramble it under my desk where I can&#x27;t see it using the supplied algorithm, then I hold it by the corners so I can&#x27;t feel the textures.  then I hit The start button and start feeling around on the cube (you don&#x27;t get much done in 10 seconds).  Then when it dings I start solving, still under the desk, so I can&#x27;t see it.  When I think it&#x27;s solved I stop the timer, then I look at it, if it really is solved, I accept the time.

And I do think the dominican rum might be a bit of a set back, albeit a fun one ;)  Hehehe.  More people need to try their hand (really bad pun) at texture cubing though.  It sure is neat!

Daniel

  not that i think it would make a huge difference on your times or 
  anything, but just a small point; i don&#x27;t think you should have an 
  inspection time. unless you mean a 10 second inspection time while 
  your eyes are closed...which may have been what you meant. pick up 
  cube, close eyes, mix like crazy, inspect, solve, open eyes...cheer

  at least that&#x27;s how i do it

  and nice times btw. mine aren&#x27;t that fast yet. of course, i&#x27;ve only 
  done the thing on the beach, topped up with dominican rum...and no

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve got a couple questions:<br>
<br>
1) Cubes may have tiles (stickers will be provided to put on over <br>

top, as with tiles)?<br>
<br>
2) Does this sticker vs. paint/tile restriction apply to all puzzles <br>
(Cubes, megaminx, etc.), all cubes (2x2x2 - 5x5x5), or only the 3x3x3 <br>
cubes?  Specifically, I have a tiled megaminx (though I know that&#x27;s <br>
not an official event, I&#x27;ll be making a record attempt), and would <br>
like to paint (with nail polish) my other-sized cubes, since their <br>
stickers are wearing off.  Will these puzzles not qualify for <br>
records, if painted?<br>
<br>
3) Do all size cubes need to use the &quot;original&quot; colors (Blue, Green, <br>
Red, Orange, White, &amp; Yellow)?  I recently got the Eastsheen cube set <br>
from Mefferts (2x2x2, 4x4x4, &amp; 5x5x5), and they have purple in place <br>
of orange.  Is this okay?<br>

I think that they could.  In under 6 months.  But one would have to 
be totally dedicated, quit their job, or drop out of school, and 
practice 5-8 hours a day!  It took me about 10 months from my first 
solve to get to 25s average.  I was devoted for the last 8 of the 10 
months to improving my speed.  It took me around an hour to 3 hours 
of practice a day. So I think that theoretically this could be done, 
but realistically it would be very difficult.

I have a suggestion on cases. Check on Pelican Cases. You can get the 1120 with pick and pluck foam for only 27 dollars. It has unconditional lifetime gaurantee, is completely sealed, and corrosion proofed. That may be a bit extreme, but these cases are excelent considering the price. You can also get the foam custom cut to fit your needs.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Color scheme is colors on opppsite faces. Two cubes having identical <br>
colors  do not neccessarily have identical colot schemes.<br>
<br>
A Rubik&#x27;s cube solution is independebt of color schreme, prompting <br>
Singmaster to devise his notation for faces and rotations. I see this <br>
notation used by speed cubists in this club. For this reason, I think <br>
having an official color scheme is not really neccessary. However, if <br>
we are to have such a scheme, then it is god of Dan to announce it at <br>
this early stage. I recommend that those speed cubists who wiosh to <br>
participate in Toronto use this color scheme as part of their <br>
training to &quot;get in into the system&quot;, nd improve the chance of <br>
winning.<br>
<br>
is pontification sounds almost sacriligeous coming from a mere cube <br>
artist, who will exhibit, not compete, and therefore win no records. <br>
Make no mistake, though: color scheme is very important in cube art. <br>
Color scheme determines the appearance of the 3D design. there is <br>
something called opposite colors and adjacent colors. For example, <br>
the Landry Staircas in http://cube.misto.cz has gren-yellow as <br>
opposite colors and red,orange,white and blue as adjacent colors. <br>
Only white and red is seem by the outside world. If I were to use the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s color scheme, and retain red and white as adgacent colors, I <br>
would have blue-gren as opposite colors.<br>
<br>
Hana a kostky<br>
<br>
Aquestion for Dan: do cube artists have to adhere to the official <br>
color scheme for them to exhibit? I guess this would not apply to a <br>
single-cube art, such as picture cubes.<br>

          <div class="email-content">this would be possible if you had 100% dedication. youd need a month or 2 to get used to the cube and the method and youd probably see you times slowly getting better every week. this has been happening to me for quite a while. my times went from >1 min to 1 min to 50 sec to 45, 40, 37 and now im at 37 but feel they will now drop to 35 and am still learning or improving approx. 20 algs in the past 1.5 months.  of course, i spend all of my time with the cube and practice for 3-8 hours a day with school and all day without. definitely possible.

<br>
  All WC2003 Competitors Please Take note!!<br>
  -------------------------------------------<br>
  Since I am one of the ones who uses a now non official color scheme<br>
  (Blue/White), and from the outpour received, since the announcement <br>
  last weekend, I took it to heart and went to bat with the Owners <br>
  regarding the issues surrounding the color schemes of the cube(which <br>
  in my opinion makes no different what so ever - manufacturer&#x27;s <br>
  produced it that <br>
  way).................................................................<br>
  .....................................................................<br>
  ........................AND I WON!!!!!.........................<br>
<br>
<br>
  Therefore there is now &quot;NO COLOR SCHEMES RESTRICTIONS&quot; for this <br>
  championship.<br>
<br>
  - Two types of cubes can be used for this event:<br>
  ------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
  1-Newly Designed Competion cubes or<br>
  2-Your own cube in your own colored scheme(must use original color&#x27;s)<br>
  and new stickers will be supplied(Documentary/Camera&#x27;s). Tiles ok<br>
  (stickers will fit over tiles for those C4 Cubists)<br>
  3-no cutting corners or rounding of edges on any facelet of the cube<br>
  (includes atom). 3x3x3 cubes will be preinspected(dismantled) prior <br>
  to each event round. Sanding imperfections of the plastic permitted.<br>

Chris said SEVERAL times the &quot;extended cross&quot; method is NOT a 2*2*2 
with two edges to complete the cross (he only said that he HAD tried 
it  but it was&#x27;nt always efficient).

So he decided to build ONE of the 4 corner+edge pairs DURING the 
cross, but he doesn&#x27;t try to insert the pair all the time, it 
depends.  The goal is to build CROSS + 1st  PAIR  in the same time, 
that&#x27;s all.

The advantage is you can continue solving just after the cross, and 
look for 2nd PAIR while you are inserting the first, WITHOUT any 
pause.

I hope my english is understood, bye

I believe white noise is a complex tone generated by adding many frequencies to one tone. It ends up sounding like a waterfall. The beauty of it is, it contains enough frequencies to destructively interfere with many other noises. It greatly lowers distraction. I think a lot of people play it loudly at night to better their sleep.<br>

          <div class="email-content">There seems to be some confusion about the new method I&#x27;m trying, and 
I know I&#x27;ve already used a lot of message space about it already so 
I&#x27;ll try to keep this short.  Basically this &quot;extended cross&quot; method 
you&#x27;ve been hearing about is the name I gave to an idea I came up 
with.  I think that Tony Snyder also uses this approach in the 
beginning of his solution, though I don&#x27;t know if he does the direct 
solve or not.  The only thing to the extended cross method is that I 
combined the first two steps of Jessica&#x27;s F2L strategy into one 
step.  Instead of solving the cross, saying &quot;ok I&#x27;m done with the 
cross,&quot; then solving a corner edge pair (which once you&#x27;ve done those 
two steps you&#x27;ve created a 2x2x2 block with the remaining two edges 
in your first layer) I just do it all in one step.  Yes it is true 
that sometimes I form the corner edge pair while solving the cross 
and then I place the pair to finish the cross and first pair (which I 
call the &quot;extended cross&quot;).  But I also do it a number of other 
ways.  Depending on the setup of the cube I try different 
approaches.  My goal is to be able to direct solve the cross and 1st 
pair (the &quot;extended cross&quot;) every time.  By direct solve I simply 
mean to solve those 6 pieces in the fewest number of moves possible.  
So the only thing I do for this method is just to try to solve the 
shape that the cross and first pair form (which I call the extended 
cross) rather than solve a cross, and then after that solve a 
corner/edge pair.

To address your other question, triggercross, as far as I know no one 
else uses this method (except maybe Tony Snyder).  If anyone else 
does use this approach please let me know!  I don&#x27;t want to take 
credit for an idea someone else might have already come up with.  But 
this is not a trick that all the sub-20 people know and use.  It is 
very very possible to achieve an average of sub-20 seconds without 
using this approach to the F2L.

Also for your other question I think most, if not all, sub-20 cubers 
try not to rotate the cube during the F2L.  I might be wrong but I 
think it&#x27;s true to say that.

Hope this helps clear up about the &quot;extended cross&quot; method, which is 
really just the term I give for the shape that is made up of the 
cross and the first pair.  If anyone still has any questions feel 
free to e-mail me at foozman17@... and I&#x27;ll answer you 
through personal correspondence.

later all,
Chris

I have a similar problem. I cannot find anyine, who creates 3d

Actually, that&#x27;s only true in Euclidean geometry. In non-Euclidean 
geometries it isn&#x27;t true - in fact, the ratio is never equal to pi 
and isn&#x27;t constant either.
e.g. in spherical geometry the ratio can be anything in the interval 
[2,pi), depending on the circle.

Partly true except transcendental means rather more than this. For 
instance the cube (I guess I&#x27;d better make this on topic, in a very 
tenuous way) root of two is not transcendental but it&#x27;s decimal 
expansion doesn&#x27;t repeat. Indeed any real irrational number has a 
decimal expansion that doesn&#x27;t repeat.
In fact, pi is transcendental (over Q) because it doesn&#x27;t satisfy a 
polynomial equation (over Q).

I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve only heard of Albert. Who are the other two?

  > Pi is most usually approximated as 3.14 but is in fact a

  Partly true except transcendental means rather more than this. For 
  instance the cube (I guess I&#x27;d better make this on topic, in a very 
  tenuous way) root of two is not transcendental but it&#x27;s decimal 
  expansion doesn&#x27;t repeat. Indeed any real irrational number has a 
  decimal expansion that doesn&#x27;t repeat.
  In fact, pi is transcendental (over Q) because it doesn&#x27;t satisfy a 
  polynomial equation (over Q).

          <div class="email-content">Hi, everybody!<br>
This is my first message. I!ve been visiting this page and only now I <br>
decided to write. I bought my first cube in 1982, when it was really <br>
a world fever. I solved it ( with the help of a small book - I have <br>
to tell the truth) and put it appart. In the last three years I began <br>
again my contact with this wonder puzzle. I have bought several <br>
cubes, because the quality is very poor and here in Brazil we can&#x27;t <br>
find good ones. <br>
When I see cubers on this page that can solve in 20 or 30 seconds and <br>
are really speedcubers, I think that I should never join this group <br>
because my lowest time is 2 minutes (please don&#x27;t laugh, I try to do <br>
my best). Anyway, that&#x27;s alright. How many persons in your city can <br>
solve the cube?<br>
In the LL e began with a cross, because we&#x27;ll have only six <br>
algorithms to do in order to orient the LL.<br>
<br>
A hug from brazil to all cubers of this page!!!<br>

It does change some of the centre pieces too. Namely, two of the 
centre pieces on the U face are swapped (those not on the edge 
slice, nor corners of the centre) and two on the R face (those on 
the S slice).

No, this is not Dan Gosbee, the Chiwef, but Hana Bizek, the mere cube 
artist. :-) But I can answer those questions for you, I think.
1. There is a fee of 20 Canadian dollars to cover some sort of a gift 
pack that will be given out, so &quot;no one leaves without a prize.&quot; 
2. The event will be held at the Ontario Science Centre  in Toronto.

There is a website, periodically updated, that&#x27;s how I know. Its URL 
is http://www.rubikswc2003.com where this and more is written for 
those who desire  such information. If you forget the URL, go to 
http://www.speedcubing.com . It is there as clickable link.

I guess there is no age limit, either youngest or oldest. The 
criterion is that you have to be omething  lke sub 30, really fast! 
If you can meet the time limit, they will take youregardless of age, 
although they have age categories.

Keep in mind that this is a very high-class, international 
competition to which those with my average don&#x27;t belong. I wull be 
exhibiting cube art, not competing.

This is an open event and all are most welcome to attend. There is 
also &quot;No Time limits&quot; or qualifications/pre requisites other than 
being able to solve the cube to enter.

If you can do it we expect you there....If you show up with one in 
your hand, your on the stage......!

There, you can even hear pink, brown, blue, and violet noise.  I <br>

          <div class="email-content">Jess,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the great timer!  As a frequent user, I just had a couple <br>
suggestions to think about, since you&#x27;re working on it :-)  I thought <br>
I&#x27;d share them here, in case anyone else had opinions on my thoughts <br>
that they&#x27;d like to express.  Here they are:<br>
<br>
1) Allow the user to add puzzles to the list.  I use the timer for my <br>
5x5x5 cube and the megaminx (and may for use it for other puzzles <br>
some time), but I just select a different puzzle from the list, while <br>
timing these.<br>
<br>
2) Update 2x2x2 scrambling alg generation, so that you don&#x27;t get <br>
things like U D, which is really just U2, or even worse U D&#x27;, which <br>
is equivalent to a mere cube rotation.  There is also a similar <br>
problem with the 4x4x4 scrambling algs, such that you&#x27;ll get things <br>
like U u U2, which can be condensed to U&#x27; u.  Also, I don&#x27;t know if <br>
your generator would possibly make an alg with something like D d u <br>
U, but that should be caught as well - only N-1 of available parallel <br>
slices should be moved without a move of at least one perpendicular <br>
slice.<br>
<br>
3) Have a checkbox, or something, to indicate that you are doing a <br>
Sunday Contest run.  Checking the box would clear the display of <br>
previous attempts, change to a 3x3x3 cube, and not show any <br>
scrambling algs.  I sometimes find while doing the Sunday Contest, <br>
and using your timer, that I start to just mix up with the timer&#x27;s <br>
alg, and have to undo it before using the correct scrambling alg.<br>
<br>
Anything else I&#x27;ve missed?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I will state this again for clarification on cubes for the <br>
championships...<br>
<br>
all competitors have 2 choices.<br>
<br>
a-you bring your own cube<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
b-you use a supplied competition cube designed especially for this <br>
championship by myself and Mr. Rubik.<br>
<br>
Cube Rules: NO EXCEPTIONS!!!<br>
<br>
-use any color scheme you choose<br>
-no rounding of edges ie: if the plastic has a right angle then your <br>
not allowed to sand the angle portion down....you are only permitted <br>
to sand imperfections in the plastic. All 3x3x3 cubes WILL be <br>
dismantled prior to each round.<br>
-STICKERS - MUST BE NEW AND YOU MUST USE THE NEW RUBIK&#x27;s LOGO. new <br>
Stickers will be supplied to competitors prior to the event. Please <br>
note that the type of stickers is irrelevant.<br>
-Tiles- permitted. Will be stickered if required(over top of tile).<br>
<br>
<br>
Please note that these rules have been in place for years and the <br>
sticker portion was a request of our sponsor&#x27;s for the camera&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
Championship cubes which are to be supplied are &quot;NOT&quot; the Studio <br>
cubes as everyone has been saying.<br>
<br>

It will not be possible to add new puzzles yourself.<br>
Right now I&#x27;m thinking about only making this for the 3x3x3 but maybe <br>

I have one of those too. I got mine from Toys &#x27;r&#x27; us in Linköping, Sweden. 
I must say I think its a bit too easy actually, its like those . After solving it four or five times I have not touched it at all.

It seems like it exist a twin version also, mabye that is more of a challenge.

i would say that person should do the run over again, but should be like a piece pop. Like a person can be allowed 1 corner pop and 1 edge pop. Corner pops have never happened to me, so my view on this might be wrong.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s happened to me a few times. It&#x27;s really creepy, because the 
cube is perfectly solvable, but then at the end it&#x27;s impossible. And 
you can&#x27;t actually feel the corner piece turn, you just hear a sort 
of click.
But I agree, it should count like a piece pop.

          <div class="email-content">My Experience with purchasing from mefferts have been a bit mixed:
I purchased a 4x4x4 a 5x5x5 and a square 1 puzzle.  I recieved the 4z4z4 
cube and the 5x5x5 cube about 2 days before the square 1.  I had ordered the 
yellow-opp white 5x5x5 but I recieved the white-opp blue color scheme.  The 
cube worked beautifully, but the scheme was wrong.  I cantacted them about 
this and they sent me a replacement right away.  The only problem with the 
replacement was that its construction was far worse than my other cube.  I 
can scramble it and start solving and it will at some times literally fall 
apart in my hands.  I&#x27;ve re assembled it, tried tightening things down, but 
still if I turn it enough, it falls apart in my hands.

I kept the blue-opp white cube and sent the other one back.  The cube I kept 
works beautifull and the only problem I ever encounter is the occaisional 
twisting of any one of the center corner pieces.  It is very easily fixed in 
sub 1 second time.  I have dis assmebled and reassembled this cube a few 
times, I have also lubed it.  I am completely pleased with this cube (except 
the color scheme, but I got used to it).  So do be careful, one cube was 
absolutely wonderful, but the other one I would pay 15 cents for.  Anyone 
else had issues like this?  Thanks!  Hope that helps.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan,

   How funny that this should come up. For the first time in a long
time this happened to me this morning.

   I thought that there would be no manually twisting corners allowed,
since someone could rotate two in place pretty quickly.

   If I get this right one competition will be twelve cubes, throwing
out the high and low times. May I make a suggestion that it be
thirteen cubes and each competitor gets to throw out one score of
their choosing. This way everyone gets one mistake or bad take or
popped or rotated corner piece, or whatever. 

   Regards,

   David J

corners _can_ get twisted involuntarily by rough cubing. It happened <br>
to me, too, but very very rarely. Treating it as a pop makes sense.<br>
<br>
I have another question. Unless I am mistaken, the rules say that <br>
the fastest average out of 10 (total 12 attempts) will determine the <br>
winner (one pop allowed). So, if you get two pops, you are out, <br>
correct? I would like to discuss this a bit more. <br>
<br>
Most of us will bring our own cubes, well lubed, easy to turn, and, <br>
unfortunately, also easy to pop. We will all be under huge pressure <br>
trying our best. As most of you noticed, poppage is much more <br>
frequent when there is something in stake in front of people at a <br>
big event than during your practice runs in the privacy of your <br>
home. The chances of getting two poppages in 12 attempts are, IMHO, <br>
pretty high. During the 1st championship, we had three attempts and <br>
the best time determined the winner. Because the cubes were new and <br>
only three attempts allowed, poppage was rare. My guess is that if <br>
we are going to disqualify everybody who gets two poppages, we may <br>
experience heavy loss here ... <br>
<br>
I agree that average is more important than the best time, but for <br>
the WC, I would rather see the BEST time out of 10 to determine the <br>
winner. This would allow more than 2 pops, it would keep the <br>
championship interesting and undecided till the very end, and, on <br>
top of this, the one who manages to achieve the shortest time, wins. <br>
Under the current conditions, I can see somebody winning with an <br>
average of 20 simply because that person went slower to <br>
prevent &quot;catastrophic&quot; solves that would either ruin the average or <br>
lead to disqualification.<br>

          <div class="email-content">My only fear with having the best time win the championship is what 
happens if someone happens to get an 8 or 9 second F2L (not 
impossible but difficult from what I understand) and then the last 
layer happens to solve after that?  Would the world record then stand 
as a lucky 8 seconds?  Would that person be declared &quot;the fastest 
cubist in the world?&quot;  Personally I think that one of the unofficial 
top ten cubists, or someone who comes and doesn&#x27;t happen to be part 
of the internet community (and happens to be ridiculously fast) 
should walk away with that title.  Or say someone gets just an &quot;OK&quot; 
F2L for you real pros (10 or 11) seconds and the same thing happens.  
What do we do with that time even though some other cubist is CLEARLY 
the faster of the two.

Also I have had the corners twist on my cube when I was careless or 
not paying attention during a trigger.  Since it happens for the same 
reasons as a piece pop (being careless or nervous) I count it as a 
piece pop.  From my experience with these I&#x27;ve noticed that I can 
usually feel that I&#x27;ve twisted a corner, or I can spot them readily 
during the OLL step at which point I stop and count the time as a 
piece pop.  Should the cubist stop as soon as they realize and 
say &quot;I&#x27;ve twisted a corner&quot; or should they solve the cube until only 
that corner is twisted and then say &quot;I&#x27;ve twisted a corner&quot; ?

Just my two cents.

          <div class="email-content">Chris,

you can construct &quot;unjust&quot; situations with every system. You can 
ruin an obviously best average with another pop, which would be 
unfortunate, too. 

I personally think that the chances of seeing an 8 or 9 seconds are 
astronomically small given that something like that likely never 
happened to anyone (at least not to me). Yes, we may see a 12 or 13, 
but that is, actually OK, because those times do happen on ocassion.

Another idea would be to take an average of the 3 fastest times to 
prevent what you mentioned. This would give us a chance to have more 
than one pop but still stabilize the outliers. What do you think?

<br>
I would be inclined to just finish the cube with a corner out of <br>
place. It&#x27;s the easy way to proceed.<br>
<br>
Ruleswise, that could mean that the time would count even if one <br>
corner was twisted wrong. Yeah, it&#x27;s a little weird, but I don&#x27;t see <br>
how it could be abused.<br>
<br>
&gt;I have another question. Unless I am mistaken, the rules say that<br>
&gt;the fastest average out of 10 (total 12 attempts) will determine the<br>
&gt;winner (one pop allowed). So, if you get two pops, you are out,<br>

<br>
I thought it was 12 attempts plus one possible pop?<br>
<br>
You can (almost) always reassemble the cube and finish with a 5-10 <br>
seconds worse time. Don&#x27;t know if that will be legal, but I can&#x27;t see <br>
why it shouldn&#x27;t be.<br>
<br>
So if you pop twice, it will hurt your average with 0.5-1.0 seconds. <br>
That seems appropriate to me.<br>
<br>
I think part of cubing skill, both in solving and preparing your <br>
cube, is to not break the cube while solving. If you get two pops in <br>
less that 13 attempts,  you should probably slow down a bit.<br>
<br>
The competition has to be by some average, IMAO!<br>

No - it is a lot more than that if you can change the stickers. e.g. 
You could have a green-green-green corner etc.

If you can change the pieces but not the stickers then it is 
12*number of solvable positions.

Hi,

          <div class="email-content">Hi Lars,<br>
<br>
it is good to see your input on this.<br>
 <br>
&gt; You can (almost) always reassemble the cube and finish with a 5-10 <br>
&gt; seconds worse time. Don&#x27;t know if that will be legal, but I can&#x27;t <br>
see <br>
&gt; why it shouldn&#x27;t be.<br>
&gt; So if you pop twice, it will hurt your average with 0.5-1.0 <br>
seconds. <br>
<br>
It depends on the type of the &quot;pop&quot;. You can easily lose 3 cubies <br>
depending on when and how the pop occurs. That can add MUCH more <br>
than 5-10 seconds and I doubt that the jury would accept the time as <br>
valid, albeit long.<br>
<br>
I also think that an average of some sort is probably a good idea, <br>
but not from 10, but say 3 best times. This makes a lot of sense <br>
because it is the middle ground solution. It allows for more pops, <br>
yet eliminates the influence of very lucky times.<br>
<br>
Another thing I am concerned about is the time schedule. I am <br>
surprised that nobody has done this math yet. I mean, each <br>
contestant would have to solve the cube 12 times, right? If we get <br>
one hundred contestants, which does not seem as an overkill given <br>
the recent popularity of the cube, we have 100x12x1=1200 minutes= <br>
20h of PURE competition. And that assumes 1 minute per person, <br>
including the person coming to stage, inspecting the cube, solving, <br>
replacing the cube. Actually, I think 1 minute is WAY optimistic <br>
referring to Dan Gosbee&#x27;s words &quot;if you come and have the cube, you <br>
are on stage&quot;. We would need 3 full days just for the 3x3x3 cube to <br>
do this. On top of this, keeping track of whose cube is whose will <br>
not be that easy. You will need a lot of people who will mix the <br>
cube (those should also be able to solve the cube reasonably fast in <br>
case they mess up the mixing). Who will do that??<br>
<br>
Considering the time constraints, based on the number of <br>
contestants, it might be the case that solving the cube 3 times and <br>
counting the fastest will be the ONLY plausible way, in the end! <br>
Yes, we could do multiple parallel sessions in different rooms or <br>
have 10 people on stage doing the cube at the same time and that <br>
would help solve this problem. But if we do this, we need to talk <br>
about this ahead of time because arrangements like that will require <br>
big changes in the physical setup of the competition and a large <br>
number of cube mixers.<br>
<br>
DanG, what is your view on this?<br>
<br>

&gt; That seems appropriate to me.<br>

True enough.  If I figured this out right, then allowing the stickers <br>
to be put anywhere, you would get:<br>
(54!) / ((9!)^6) ~= 1.010973e+38 possibilities.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Regarding a good method of choosing the winner of a cube <br>
championship, my own view is that doing 13 cubes and discarding the <br>
worst two and best one time would be fairest: no extra cubes for when <br>
you pop. If you pop then that either reconstruct the cube and then <br>
complete it or declare that as a cube you are discarding if you can&#x27;t <br>
be bothered to complete it. <br>
<br>
The cubes you choose to discard should be chosen after the 13 cubes <br>
have been solved (although if you don&#x27;t finish a cube then that <br>
should be one of your discards).<br>
<br>
If you did 15 and discarded worst 3 and best 2 then I think many <br>
people would be too exhausted to do well. If you did 11 cubes and <br>
discarded the worst, or the worst two and best one then I think it <br>
would be too random, but I am not too convinced by my own argument <br>
here, so perhaps it would be okay.<br>
<br>
Personally I am VERY likely to pop 2 cubes in a set of 12, and on <br>
some cubes also have a high chance of rotating a corner in one or <br>
more solves so I think pops should be manually corrected. I don&#x27;t <br>
agree that you should get an extra cube because it is your own fault.<br>
<br>
I have experimented for a while with manually twisting the corners <br>
instead of using algs to try and finish the cube quicker, but I don&#x27;t <br>
think it gains except in a few specific cases. A rule whereby <br>
unethical manipulation of the cube is not allowed and would be dealt <br>
with by a predetermined commitee may have some relevance here.<br>
<br>
Also, most of my cubes have rounded insides but I am not a world-<br>
beater in regards to my times. What is the problem with sanding <br>
inside the cube, can anybody else see that an unfair advantage would <br>
be gained? This restriction only benefits those that don&#x27;t sand.<br>

&gt; Another thing I am concerned about is the time schedule.... If we<br>
&gt; get one hundred contestants, ... we have 100x12x1=1200 minutes= <br>
&gt; 20h of PURE competition. And that assumes 1 minute per person, <br>
&gt; including the person coming to stage, inspecting the cube, solving, <br>
&gt; replacing the cube.<br>
If I understand the way the contest is going to work, it would <br>
actually be much longer per person.  I believe that for each attempt, <br>
you will walk on stage, give up your cube for judges&#x27; <br>
inspection/scrambling, preinspect, and solve.  I&#x27;d think that would <br>
take an easy minute even for the fastest of cubists.<br>
<br>
&gt; I also think that an average of some sort is probably a good idea, <br>
&gt; but not from 10, but say 3 best times. This makes a lot of sense <br>
&gt; because it is the middle ground solution. It allows for more pops, <br>
&gt; yet eliminates the influence of very lucky times.<br>
Perhaps this doesn&#x27;t give as accurate of a sampling as an average of <br>
10, but I agree that if there are really that many contestants that <br>
want to participate in the &quot;average&quot; event, we may need to skip on 12 <br>
attempts (13 with a pop).  To accomidate the possibility of multiple <br>
pops, avoid taking too long, and avoid the &quot;un-fair&quot; advantage <br>
someone may incur by an intentional pop, maybe we could do it <br>
something like this:<br>
- 6 attempts (no extras for piece pops)<br>
- Best average of &quot;middle&quot; 3 wins - drop best time and worst two times<br>
- Pops can be discarded, by choice of contestant, or reassembled and <br>
solved the rest of the way.  This would include fixing the accidental <br>
rotation of a single corner.<br>
<br>
I think it&#x27;s reasonable to say that if you pop 3 or more times in 6 <br>
solves, and it drastically affects your average, then that&#x27;s probably <br>
fairly representative of your abilities, right (except, of course, <br>
the nerves involved)?  Also, only doing 5 (or 6) attempts, reduces <br>
the likelihood that an extremely lucky case would be included in the <br>
average.<br>
<br>
Thoughts?<br>
<br>
Btw, I tried rotating one corner in place and couldn&#x27;t do it.  I was <br>
able to it on my old OddzOn cube (with silver metal screws), but my <br>
new one (Also OddzOn, but with black plastic screws) won&#x27;t do it, <br>
even though it is well broken in.  I think OddzOn cubes are a bit <br>
better now than they were a year or two back - I hardly ever pop <br>
pieces, even though the cube is plenty loose for triggers.  If you <br>
have problems with a lot of piece pops, you could still break in a <br>
new cube in time for the competition :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I believe that for each attempt, <br>
&gt; you will walk on stage, give up your cube for judges&#x27; <br>
&gt; inspection/scrambling, preinspect, and solve. <br>
<br>
I thought this would be done only in the beginning. During the <br>
contest, you do not get to touch the cube, I suppose, with the <br>
exception of competing, of course. Inspections before each attempt <br>
would make the event impossible and boring to watch.<br>
<br>
&gt; - 6 attempts (no extras for piece pops)<br>
&gt; - Best average of &quot;middle&quot; 3 wins - drop best time and worst two <br>
times<br>
&gt; - Pops can be discarded, by choice of contestant, or reassembled <br>
and <br>
&gt; solved the rest of the way.  This would include fixing the <br>
accidental <br>
&gt; rotation of a single corner.<br>
<br>
Several points here. Do we want the winner to be the one who gets <br>
frequent very good spikes but also bad spikes (due to trying hard to <br>
go as fast as possible) or the most consistent, but a slower winner? <br>
To put it another way, would you be comfortable with having the <br>
winner someone who solved the cube 6 times between 17 and 18 seconds <br>
(which gives the average between 17 and 18) rather than a person who <br>
will have 15.8, 16.7, 16.9, and 21.0, 19.8, 18.5 (average 18.12)? I <br>
personally think that the winner should be the second person. After <br>
all, that 15.8 will likely be one of the fastest times during the <br>
competition. I am still in favor of taking the average of the fastest <br>
three as the rule.<br>
<br>
Finally, I also believe that rules must be simple and non-ambiguous. <br>
Once we start allowing pops, twisted corners, as valid times or even <br>
give the contestants chance to count/discard at their will, the <br>
competition will be less &quot;clean&quot;. All times that will count should be <br>
clean solves, IMHO. <br>
<br>
Also, the rules should not force the contestants to go slower just <br>
because two pops will disqualify them. The rules should promote the <br>
fastest times and not consistency. By going for average of three best <br>
times out of 6 or 7, we get a chance to speed up, to take risks, to <br>
try to do the impossible while not risking your neck. If you get the <br>
first three pops, yes, you will be under pressure to not have any <br>
pops because you need at least three valid attempts to not be <br>
disqualified.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all, <br>
<br>
This discussion seems similar to Guiness or cube association things <br>
to me! <br>
<br>
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF WC2003? <br>
<br>
I think to get together and transfer each experience and see other&#x27;s <br>
techniques are more more important than just competition. <br>
Is WC2003 the last cube contest forever? <br>
If we could hold WC2003 successfully, we can keep holding this kind <br>
of event hopefully. <br>
<br>
This is my opinion. <br>
I mostly agree Lars comment. <br>
I rarely meet corner rotation but this can not be abused. <br>
I often met more when I used corner first method before I changed to <br>
Guus&#x27;s. <br>
Probably this not dependent on method, just by cube condition. <br>
<br>
According to official rule, &quot;If a puzzle-defect occurs, the <br>
contestant should still do his/her best to fix the defect and finish <br>
the attempt. No help is allowed to fix the cube.&quot; corner rotation can <br>
be treated as same as other pop. <br>
<br>
I believe average of 6 or 10 is better for our contest. <br>
(I prefer not allowing extra trial for pop. We, Japanese cubist, have <br>
own Sunday contest so far 59 times, we do not allow 13th trial. )<br>
<br>
To do slower is one of the strategy to avoid any kind of pops. <br>
<br>
Jessica, I have a question. <br>
A lot of sub20 cubist, like you and Ron, say to do slower! <br>
Isn&#x27;t it true? <br>
In competition, you guy do much quicker? <br>
<br>
I propose one prize for best average, one for the best time ever. <br>
So contestant can think and choose how to compete in WC. <br>

          <div class="email-content">That has been brought up a lot.  I think the best idea I have heard so far is to use clear coat nail polish on the stickers after putting new ones on.  (Haven&#x27;t tried it myself yet though).  Has anyone ever tried super-glue?  (I would recommend taking the cube apart before using super glue.)<br>

yeah, you should take your cube apart before using superglue, i tried that once with my cube assembled and got some in the crack, ripped open my cube and almost glued my fingers together during the process... i would assume it would work.

RyGuy, try(heehee, that rhymed) moving your site to 
www.brinkster.com. It&#x27;s also free, and it has no ads at alll. Plus 
alot of bandwidth.

          <div class="email-content">Dear Masayuki,<br>
<br>
&gt; I think to get together and transfer each experience and see <br>
other&#x27;s <br>
&gt; techniques are more more important than just competition. <br>
<br>
I agree. If majority of people think that this discussion is not <br>
needed, let&#x27;s not discuss it further.<br>
<br>
&gt; If we could hold WC2003 successfully, we can keep holding this kind <br>
&gt; of event hopefully.<br>
<br>
Interesting idea. I am somehow skeptical that we will be able to hold <br>
WC every year, but perhaps, we could have annual meetings, where the <br>
cubers from all over the world would gather. Something like the Dutch <br>
Cube day.<br>
<br>
&gt; I mostly agree Lars comment. <br>
&gt; I rarely meet corner rotation but this can not be abused.<br>
<br>
Imagine this: The cuber breaks the world record and slams the cube on <br>
the sensor, cameras looking closely, and ... there is a twisted <br>
corner on the cube ... Now, you need to explain people, including the <br>
press, that this is what happened &quot;by accident&quot; that the cube is now <br>
unsolvable, and that it did not give any advantage to the solver. <br>
Hmmm ... This is why I think that all times that count should be <br>
clean solves.<br>
<br>
&gt; Jessica, I have a question. <br>
&gt; A lot of sub20 cubist, like you and Ron, say to do slower! <br>
&gt; Isn&#x27;t it true? <br>
&gt; In competition, you guy do much quicker? <br>
<br>
No. It is not the speed that causes the break ups, it is the NERVES!! <br>
And, BTW, the &quot;go slower&quot; rule applies ONLY to the F2L. In the LL, <br>
you can and should speed up as much as you can because that step is <br>
more &quot;mechanical&quot; than the F2L where you have many different choices <br>
to choose from.<br>
<br>
&gt; I propose one prize for best average, one for the best time ever. <br>
&gt; So contestant can think and choose how to compete in WC. <br>
<br>
That&#x27;s an EXCELLENT idea. I like it.<br>
<br>
Jessica<br>

I think we should try to estimate the number of contestants, at least <br>
roughly, because this will likely determine the competition rules.<br>
<br>
Assuming we get around 100 people, I think we need to think seriously <br>
about how the competition will look.<br>
<br>
Ideas:<br>
<br>
1. Parallel runs<br>
2. More than 1 person on stage<br>
3. Qualifying round based on best of three attempts to get the <br>
fastest 20 people and then those 20 compete in the finals, or <br>
something like this<br>
<br>
I insist that if we want to keep 12 attempts for everybody with cube <br>
preinspections before every round, the total amount of time for the <br>
competition will be totally unreasonable. Remember, we are planning <br>
many other interesting categories, yet the competition is for two <br>

<br>
Thanks for your comments. <br>
I wish WE, NOT GUINESS, COULD decide competition rules. <br>
<br>

That&#x27;s true, Jessica. <br>
Number of contestants is also important to decide how to have <br>
competition. <br>
At least, final or semifinal should be held in the standard which we <br>
decide. <br>
<br>
I also don&#x27;t think WC every year, hope to have every 4 year like <br>
olympic. <br>
(I don&#x27;t think I can keep my average, but it is still interesting to <br>
see.)<br>
<br>
I got an idea about corner rotation based on <br>
&quot;If a contestant puts an unsolved cube back on the timing device / <br>
table, then:<br>
- if the cube needs only one move to solve, 2 seconds are added to <br>
the contestants time. &quot; <br>
<br>
Why we do not follow this, not allowing manual correction, just add 2 <br>
second. <br>

I am light years ahead of you in thought surrounding how the event 
will run.

The actual announcement will be made as to rounds and how many 
contestants are going at one time etc etc...

i estimate approx 100 contestants who actually appear and i have it 
all timed out to the last minute.

However, I would like to continue these discussions as the end point 
will result in a much highly tuned event for all....I gather so much 
info from it all and I am fine tuning how things will actually run.

We are doing this for US cubists so i need and appreciate these 
comments..

Please kepe in mind that we have 2 days worth of time. therefore 
timing is everything...

Lets continue...

(My Group has no Polls feature.  Why?)
Your group allows members to hide their email address from the group 
moderators. Unfortunately, the Polls feature is not compatible with 
this type of membership so it is not allowed on groups which allow 
this type of membership. 

So if we want to run a Poll we have to do it somewhere else.

if you are lightyears ahead, why do not you share with us the details 
proposed by you? All I have seen are the provisional rules and 
regulations on the WC2003 page. While they do answer some of the 
questions and issues raised here in the last few days, much remains 
to be answered. I noticed the head-to-head elimination-style 
competitions. How do you plan to use them? To eliminate the number of 
contestants? Are you going to use seeds? Based on what? Most 
importnatly, how do you manage to do so many disciplines and so many 
rounds (12) in just TWO days?

A PIECE OF THOUGHT FOR EVERYBODY: The first championship in 1982 took 
place in two days and this was just the 3x3x3 cube, 19 contestants, 
and 3 solves. We also have two days in Toronto, however many more 
disciplines, possibly over 100 contestants and many more rounds.

          <div class="email-content">I always use clear nail polish on my new cubes, it lasts for quite a while, 
but not indefinately.  It flakes off after a bit.  I just ended up painting 
my first cube, but my second cube, my 4x4x4 and my square 1 have all been 
nail polished for about 10 months and the stickers are in good condition.

          <div class="email-content">Jessica&gt; 3. Qualifying round based on best of three attempts to get the<br>
Jessica&gt; fastest 20 people and then those 20 compete in the finals, or<br>
Jessica&gt; something like this<br>
<br>
I thought there were some qualifying rounds written on wc2003 page<br>
a long ago...  I suggest parallel qualification.<br>
<br>
1. Divide contestants into two groups.  Make 50 pairs if we have 100 contestants.<br>
2. In each pair, one solves and the other scrambles.<br>
3. After 13 solves, exchange rolls in pairs.<br>
4. We may need 10 inspectors to watch any pairs won&#x27;t cheat.<br>
<br>
It has a (possibly big) disadvantage that we will need 50 timing<br>
devices!  10 sets of timer, scrambler, and judge to run qualification<br>
parallel in 10 would be better...<br>
<br>
According to my experiences with world campionships on a video<br>
game called BattleTech (see www.virtualworld.com), I suggest:<br>
<br>
a. Do not keep contestants wait long.  It will distract everyone.<br>
b. Schedule WILL be delaying.  Make the timetable with a lot of allowances.<br>
c. Prepare enough timing devices, spare batteries, etc.<br>
   Having one broken is quite easy.<br>
d. Food, drink, restrooms, ... There should be at least several<br>
   &quot;caretakers&quot; whose responsibilities are not for records or rules.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents.<br>

looks like I&#x27;m number 14 now that I checked back.  The linux version is much 
better, so if you have linux installed, use that.  The windows version only 
allows a 3x3x3x3 cube, the linux version allowes from 2x2x2x2 to either 
5x5x5x5 or 6x6x6x6.  Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">To all those youngsters eager to solve a 4D Rubik&#x27;s cube, take an 
advice from an old lady: you cannot go to Toys&#x27;R&#x27;Us and purchase a 4D 
cube, for Pete&#x27;s sake!  This is a very high physics combined wih 
mnathematics. The subject is knwn as general relativity. I am not 
really familiar with the subject.  All I know is that a boundary of a 
4D cube is our ordinry 3D cube in the same way as a 2D &#x27;cut up&#x27; cube 
is a boundary of a 3D cube. I visualize and solve a 3D cube, but once 
a computer program must be employed for me to do something, then I do 
not consider that a  full understanding of the subject, unless I 
develop and formulate the program (and the algorithms behind the 
program) myself. Old ladies have their own funny ways. :-)

&gt; The windows version only allows a 3x3x3x3 cube, the linux version<br>

&quot;If you cannot find any other unmatched edge, then do the sequence

Depends on the generators. The entire cube group is a 2-generator 
group. (Not sure about the supergroup - I&#x27;d have to check that.)

I am assuming that you mean the standard two-generator group such as 
&lt;U,R>.

You already mentioned edge orientation being fixed. The edge 
positions are unconstrained, apart from the usual total parity 
constraint on edges+corners.

The corner orientations are not constrained further - i.e. you only 
need the total twist to be zero as usual.

The corner positions are interesting though. Of the 6! permutations, 
only 5! are really possible (ignoring the total parity constraint 
again). I won&#x27;t go into details (see Singmaster&#x27;s Notes on the 
Rubik&#x27;s Cube for example), but what it means in practice is this:
If you solve the RDF/RDB corners, the four U corners can be put into 
position with a single turn of the U face. If this is not the case, 
then it cannot be solved using only U and R moves.

The &lt;U,R2> group has the above constraints, but also has fixed corner 
orientation, and the FR/BR edges form a separate orbit.

I don&#x27;t think the supergroup can be a 2-generator group. In 
particular C4xC4xC4 is not a 2-generator group, and as this occurs as 
a normal subgroup of the supergroup.

Indeed, it&#x27;s easy to see if the cube is solvable by moves taken from
&lt;U,R>, ONCE you have solved 2 additional corners. But I was looking
for some equation (labeling corners and their positions maybe) that
can tell you directly.
As I asked: &quot;What additional constraint on corners position do you need?&quot;

Where can I find the &quot;Singmaster&#x27;s Notes&quot;?

Gilles.

There are many 2-generator groups with subgroups that are not 
2-generator groups though. (I haven&#x27;t thought about whether that 
would be true of normal subgroups.)

To add to what I wrote above:

 http://www.mat.bham.ac.uk/J.N.Bray/Pres/A6.html 

see the subgroup M2 of S6 for example (my original examples that I 
had been thinking of were for infinite groups, but this, like the 
cube group, is a finite group).

That&#x27;s probably true. At first I thought that it may not be because 
the possibility of twisting the entire cube non-trivially but having 
a cube that looked the same because of the stickering, but now I 
think that that is unlikely to be possible.

Actually, I think you&#x27;re on to something there.  I came up with this <br>
equation by multiplying together the number of combinations for each <br>
color and then simplifying.  I didn&#x27;t take into consideration the <br>
fact that there are 24 different orientations of the cube.  For <br>
example, take a solved cube.  In my case, I have:<br>
U=Blue<br>
F=Red<br>
L=White<br>
R=Yellow<br>
B=Orange<br>
D=Green<br>
I could take off the stickers from F, B, L, and R, and move them to <br>
L, R, B, and F respectively, and come up with a different <br>
configuration of stickers.  However, a simple rotation around y will <br>
bring it back to the initial state.  I don&#x27;t know if this is possible <br>
with all sticker configurations, but it seems to make sense that it <br>
would be.  This could divide the above equation by as much as 24.<br>
<br>
Am I wrong, here?<br>

   This problem is a real pain in the butt! Good going guys, How am I
supposed to sleep tonight? :)

   So, anyway I&#x27;m looking for a way to get a handle on this.

   If I start with a 1x1x1 cube and six different-color stickers I get
(1 fixed position * 1 color) * (1 position * 5 stickers) * (1 position
* 4 stickers) * (1 position * 3 Stickers) * ( 1 position * 2 stickers)
 * (1 position * 1 sticker) = 120 possibilities. Am I picturing this
right?

   If I can see the 2x2x2 clearly I&#x27;ll try to post later. Please feel
free to do this ahead of me.

The cube group is generated by the two move sequences

R2FLD&#x27;R&#x27; = 
(URF,BDR,LFD,LDB,LBU,LUF,FRD) (FU,DR,FR,UR,DF,BD,RB,DL,BL,UL,FL) 

and 

UBLUL&#x27;U&#x27;B&#x27; =
(UBR,LUF)- (ULB)+ (UR,BU)+ (UL)+ 

There are many others too.

I don&#x27;t think there is such an easy way to do this. When I&#x27;ve had to 
write part of a computer program that checks for solvability, I 
simply took the corner permutation, applied some permutations that I 
know are possible in order to solve three of the corners, and then 
check if the other three are correct.

It&#x27;s out of print. You&#x27;ll have to try to find it second hand.

I&#x27;m not sure normal is enough either. However C4^3 occurs as a normal 
subgroup of the centre of the supergroup, and that probably is enough 
to show the supergroup is not a 2-generator group.
BTW, I did find C2^13 as a subgroup of the ordinary cube group.

   I would like to make a suggestion for one more event at the wc2003<br>

Either 
a) slow down
b) grip the cube more gently
c) make sure that a move is complete, that is, lined up, before making
the next move
d) tighten the cube up

          <div class="email-content">Well, I think you&#x27;re close, but not quite there.  If you take my <br>
original equation {(54!) / ((9!)^6)}, adjust it to compensate for <br>
cube rotations (divide by 24), take into consideration that there are <br>
only 6 stickers (not 54), and finally consider that there is only 1 <br>
sticker per color (not 9), you get a new equation of:<br>
[(6!) / ((1!)^6)] / 24<br>
which simplifies quite nicely:<br>
(6!) / (6 * 4) = 5 * 3 * 2 = 30<br>
<br>
So, if my equation is right, there are only 30 possibilities, not <br>
120.  Let&#x27;s look at why...<br>
<br>
First, it&#x27;s easier for me to look at the colors as fixed and the <br>
positions as varying than the other way around.  Hopefully this <br>
doesn&#x27;t confuse things too much.  To make this a little shorter, I&#x27;ll <br>
call the colors C1, C2, C3, etc.<br>
<br>
For starters, let&#x27;s place C1 - there are 6 available positions, but <br>
allowing for cube rotations, you can always move it to U, leaving <br>
just one possible &quot;configuration&quot;.<br>
<br>
Next, place C2 - With C1 on U there are 5 available positions, but <br>
for four of them (F, B, L, and R) the cube can always be rotated so <br>
that C2 is on F.  So, with two colors, there are two possible <br>
configurations, U=C1, D=C2 or U=C1, F=C2.<br>
<br>
Now, it gets a little more confusing with this approach.  If C2 is on <br>
F, then the cube rotation is fixed, and there are four different <br>
possibile positions for C3.  If C2 is on D, however, any of the <br>
possible positions for C3 (again F, B, L, and R) can be rotated to F, <br>
so there is only one possible position for C3.  For C1, C2, and C3, <br>
this leave a total of 5 possible configurations.<br>
<br>
Now, things are much simpler.  Because the first 3 colors are placed, <br>
the orientation of the cube is fixed.  C4 has 3 possible positions, <br>
C5 has 2, and C6 has just one, for a grand total of:<br>
5 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 30<br>
<br>
This has the same end result of ignoring cube rotations while placing <br>
stickers (6!), and then accounting for it at the end (divide by 24).<br>
<br>
Hopefully this makes sense.<br>

Actually, I gave this some thought last night and after heading 
along the wrong track concluded that it is trivial that the 
supergroup is not a 2-generator group. In fact, it is easy to show 
that it can&#x27;t be an n-generator group for n&lt;6 and since it is 
clearly generated by {U,D,F,B,R,L} it follows that the supergroup is 
a 6-generator group.

To see that a set of 5 generators {v,w,x,y,z} can&#x27;t generate the 
supergroup consider their action on the centres. In this regard they 
all commute and have order 1, 2 or 4. Thus the centres can be in at 
most 5^4=1024 configurations with 5 generators but the centres can 
be in 2048 configurations in the supergroup, so 5 generators does 
not suffice.

does anyone here have that old album &quot;how to solve the cube puzzle&quot;?<br>
i&#x27;ve converted most of the tracks to mp3, but cause of a warp, the <br>

Well, I don&#x27;t know about spray paint.  I got the suggestion of trying <br>
nail polish.  It&#x27;s a little more tedious, but it looks nice and <br>
doesn&#x27;t seem to scratch very easily.  To get it to look right and be <br>

In the oven? Doesn&#x27;t it melt?

Use the lowest possible heat setting (under 150 degrees Fahrenheit) <br>
and only leave it in there for 15-30 minutes... It&#x27;s just fine.  The <br>

Any subgroup of the centre is going to be normal, of course.

C4xC4xC4 is also a subgroup of the ordinary cube group, although the 
ones I found were not normal.

e.g. &lt;U,D,FUD&#x27;LB2L&#x27;U&#x27;DFUD&#x27;B2L2U2> is such a subgroup.

In fact, you can find C4^4 as a (non-normal) subgroup, e.g.
(UFR,ULF,UBL,URB)(FR,FL)
(UF,UL,UB,UR)(FR,FL)
(DFR,DLF,DBL,DRB)(FR,FL)
(DF,DL,DB,DR)(FR,FL)
I&#x27;m not sure if C4^5 is possible by using edge flips.

Let me get the teminology straight..

a contestant (or competitor)is a person who competes in the 
championship in one or more of the speedcubing events.
a participant is a person, who participates in the championship, 
without neccesarily competing.
therefore:
a cube arist is a participant but not a contestant, because he merely 
exhibits cube art (unless he also doubles as a speed cubist and 
competes).
you are a participant, but not contestant, because of conflict of 
interest, as you say (and I understand perfectly)...
Right or wrong?

          <div class="email-content">Well, this brings up an interesting question - the one of &quot;what is a <br>
random position on the cube and how is it generated in Cube <br>
Explorer&quot;. The low average and &quot;too high&quot; number of 16&#x27;s _could_ be <br>
caused by the mixing algorithm in Cube Explorer. Say, the program <br>
makes 25 random moves to generate the &quot;random&quot; position. However, <br>
among all possible 18^25 positions one can obtain this way, each <br>
particular position will be generated different number of times. <br>
What I am saying is that some positions will be obtained more often <br>
than other positions. Thus, the random 25-move does not sample the <br>
space of possible positions uniformly but in some biased way. What <br>
is almost obvious (Richard, can you prove it?) is that those more <br>
frequently generated positions will be those that have &quot;shorter&quot; <br>
optimal solves. Consequently, you will see an unusual number of <br>
short optimal solves.<br>
<br>
If Cube Explorer generated random positions by simulating what <br>
happens when you take the cube apart and then randomly assemble <br>
while paying attention to the last three cubies (two corners and one <br>
edge) to make the cube solvable, we would see different statistics.<br>

This is roughly what I would expect. When Richard Korf did this 6 
years ago using only 10 positions, he got 17.5 average. Personally I 
think there are no positions that need more than 20 moves. All of 
this is of course speculation, and a proof of this is very far away.

I think cube explorer does mix the cube by building it up randomly 
and not by using random moves. I&#x27;ll have to check the source code to 
be sure.

Let&#x27;s see - confidence intervals. 16-17 years old, right?

You&#x27;re making a whole load of unwarranted assumptions here. For a 
start, you&#x27;re assuming you know the distribution of the number of 
moves required to solve the cube. You&#x27;re trying to use tests without 
specifying your distribution. You&#x27;re ignoring the type I and type II 
errors of the test. You&#x27;re trying to apply some kind of version of 
the central limit theorem. You don&#x27;t know if the scrambles are 
independent, what degree of randomness they have (and computers, 
don&#x27;t forget, can&#x27;t actually generate random numbers, only pseudo-
random numbers, and what would the distribution of those numbers be? 
Do you know? 100 is a small sample size, whatever yuo might say - 
it&#x27;s roughly 0.00000000000000023120% of the size of the space. 
Moreover, the actual question in hand is deterministic, not 
probablistic anyway.

Have you made numerical estimates of upper bounds of the number of 
positions that can be reached in a given number of moves? Have you 
noted that as well as the reduced word in the group there are going 
to be other equivalent words of different lengths? Have you 
considered the number of relators in the cube group (relative to 
your set of generators)? Have you tried to figure out how many 
equivalent moves there are within a certain distance of each other?
Have you ever considered any formality in your arguments - made 
explicit your assumptions and so forth? Have you considered the size 
of the isomorphism classes of each of the various cases that were 
looked at?

The fact is that nobody knows the answer to this question, but it 
could be worked out. To argue on the evidence of a very small number 
of cases - and with some very dubious statistical assumptions at 
that - is not going to convince me. As far as I&#x27;m aware, the 
diameter hasn&#x27;t been proven to be less than 29 (in the face-turn 
metric) yet. There may be a certain amount of empirical evidence 
that it is less, but there is a whole lot more of unchecked cases.

It hasn&#x27;t even been proved that the diameter of the group is less 
than

See Mike Reid&#x27;s patterns page:
http://hedgehog.math.arizona.edu/~reid/Rubik/m_symmetric.html
It is 20 face turns or 24 quarter turns.

Yep.  And the 20 face turn solution needs 28 quarter turns: the shortest 
solution uses 22 face turns, and takes 24 quarter turns 
(R&#x27;U2BL&#x27;FU&#x27;BDFUD&#x27;LD2F&#x27;RB&#x27;DF&#x27;U&#x27;B&#x27;UD&#x27;).  I personally consider the superflip 
to be a position for which the shortest known solution is 24 moves, but it 
depends on whether you classify a half turn as one move or two.  I take it 
in your books a half turn is one move?

used a face turn metric (considering R, R&#x27;, and R2 equally) when <br>
counting total number of moves in a solution or algorithm.  I think <br>
that most/all would agree that the average would be much higher than <br>
19, and the maximum much greater than 20, if you were counting <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi James: welcome to the club.

As far as this problem you have posted goes, I wonder: what is your 
non-dominant hand doing?  When I am doing a trigger with one hand, my 
passive hand is holding the cube in a way that seems to stop other faces 
from moving incorrectly.  Hope that helps: good luck!.

What method are you using to solve the cube?
S.

PS check out these trigger videos, maybe they will help:

PPS you might find a dry silicon-based luibricant works better than a 
petroleum-based one

hey, thanks for offering, but i found what i was looking for
http://www.ggonsalves.com/combin.html

so i can say i want 3 digit combos that use the numbers 1-4, and it 
will give me just that...which i can print or save...yeah

          <div class="email-content">The method I use was invented by Lars Petrus. http://lar5.com/cube/
I assume it is popular next to Jessica&#x27;s method.. I never looked at hers but I read that her method is popular. I am going to stick with Lars&#x27;s because I like it.

Would sanding down some of the cube help with the stuck cubies? I opened my cube some and noticed where it might be getting hung up and if I could round it out, it would help me. Any advice in this area?

What method do you use?

And I am curious. Is there a method out there that basically makes the cube look &quot;random&quot; until the last few moves where everything is put together? I think it would be fun to impress people with this type of method. Especially people that never played with Rubik&#x27;s cube before. Because every method I have seen you notice a pattern in the cube so everything looks rehearsed to anyone paying attention :)

I assume it is popular next to Jessica&#x27;s method.. I never looked at hers but I read that her method is popular. I am going to stick with Lars&#x27;s because I like it.

Would sanding down some of the cube help with the stuck cubies? I opened my cube some and noticed where it might be getting hung up and if I could round it out, it would help me. Any advice in this area?

What method do you use?

And I am curious. Is there a method out there that basically makes the cube look &quot;random&quot; until the last few moves where everything is put together? only takes 19 moves average... if you want to memorize all that lol

its called the God method or something. except, theres more than a million (billion? TRILLION?) that you have to learn

 I think it would be fun to impress people with this type of method. Especially people that never played with Rubik&#x27;s cube before. Because every method I have seen you notice a pattern in the cube so everything looks rehearsed to anyone paying attention :)

It sounds like a:  your hands aren&#x27;t used to the way your cube is 

turning.  This takes some time to grow on you and you will soon be 

able to hoan your overturning to your advantage.  Your hands are 

probably used to a stiff cube so you are still turning like it is a 

stiff cube, i dunno if this is making sense.

b: vaseline is an ok lubricant, instead you should use silicon or 

something else that won&#x27;t eat you plastic.  Try wiping the inside out 

and see how your cube turns, and then if you want to lube it try 

silicon.



What method are you using?

them I can work on but one. Since I first played with one Christmas, 

I have been having a problem of getting the cubies to lock up when I 

am turning. I put some vaseline in the cube to make it turn better 

but that made the problem worse because I overturn the cube. I am 

having trouble fixing my problem.. has anyone else experienced the 

same problem? How did you fix it? Sometimes one face will turn as a 

result of my finger being in the way (like I turn the left face but 

before I complete it, the right and back face will half way turn and 

mess up what I am doing)

Just learn to do the cube fast without any stops. If you can see what last layer moves to use without having to stop turning the cube most non-cubers wont notice that the cube is getting quite ordered.

<br>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone knew if Mr. Rubik can solve the Cube himself...<br>
I have a lot of paper articles in my collection.<br>
In one of the articles, dated october 1981, there is a photograph of Mr. Rubik<br>
solving a cube, accompanied by the following story (translated from Dutch):<br>
&quot;<br>
Mr. Rubik, the inventor of the cube, the puzzle that drives many people mad,<br>
tried to solve his own invention in 1 minute, in the London department-store<br>
Harrods.<br>
He failed.<br>
He had been swanking to many customers in the department-store, that he could<br>
solve the puzzle in 1 minute. While he was solving it, his face became very red.<br>
It took him 2 minutes and 22 seconds to solve it, while moving like a madman.<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
So yes, Mr. Rubik was able to solve it. And yes, he probably could normally<br>
solve it in 1 minute.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone I have a question.  Lately my averages have been <br>
improving a lot and I&#x27;m trying a lot of different things while I <br>
cube.  Whenever I try something and get a fast average, or series of <br>
fast times, I keep trying it for all my solves.  Anyway I just set a <br>
new record average trying something new, and I was wondering if <br>
anyone else did this.  I noticed that almost always I have a tendency <br>
to go &quot;too fast&quot; and this causes my times to slow down.  Even when I <br>
try to concentrate to slow down, after 3 or 4 trials I speed up and <br>
go &quot;too fast&quot; again.  Anyway today I tried singing one of my favorite <br>
songs while I was taking an average.  I was singing the Nanook suite <br>
off of Frank Zappa&#x27;s album Apostrophe, which is really the first 4 <br>
songs, so I could sing for a while.  Anyway I noticed that if I tried <br>
to go at my usualy pace (too fast) that it was so fast I couldn&#x27;t <br>
concentrate on singing the song and doing the cube so I was forced to <br>
slow down on the cube.  Then &#x27;lo and behold I was getting really <br>
really fast times!!  Well I finished that song and another one and it <br>
kept working.  I realized I can&#x27;t sing the same song all the time or <br>
else I&#x27;ll get sick of it so I started counting aloud how many moves I <br>
was doing during the F2L.  This worked the same way, if I tried to go <br>
my usual &quot;too fast&quot; pace I couldn&#x27;t count intelligibly so I had to <br>
slow down on the cube.<br>
<br>
Also I noticed that I tend to go &quot;too fast&quot; during the LL too and <br>
lock up my cube a lot.  So now I&#x27;ve started saying out loud &quot;slow <br>
down&quot; every time I feel I&#x27;m starting to go too quickly during the LL <br>
or when I lock up the cube.  Sometimes I say it 3 times during the LL <br>
and sometimes only once.  Anyway it actually helps!  If I slow down <br>
just a little but I don&#x27;t lock up the cube and the LL goes smoother <br>
and quicker.<br>
<br>
I guess I was just curious if anyone else has tried talking or <br>
singing while they cube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all.  <br>
Since I began cubing six months ago I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to <br>
make my mark on the cubing world.  I&#x27;ve come up with something that <br>
should do that.  This summer I plan on having a underwater cube <br>
solving marathon.  I will be using a customized snorkel, and I will <br>
be underwater for 12 hours.  In this time frame I will not take any <br>
breaks from the water, but only try to solve as many cubes as <br>
possible.  I will be using two cubes that will have some <br>
modifications for underwater purposes, and i will have a few people <br>
responsible for scrambling and to tally up solves.  All opinions are <br>
welcome on this...and criticism (constructive) is welcome too.  I <br>
would enjoy some feedback on this.                         <br>

          <div class="email-content">good luck on that... But maybe you should paint yourself purple and pretend you&#x27;re a raisin.  You&#x27;ll be very very wrinkled by the time you&#x27;re done.<br>

What kind of mods on the cubes though?  And will this be in a local public pool?  A bathtub?  Sounds exciting!<br>

Worse things are at hand tho...like the need to go to
the bathroom...hopefully there&#x27;s no need to piss in
the pool..lol...The modifications to the cube are
quite simply this: weighted pieces...i guess thats the
only real modification...i may put tiles on it or
paint it, im not sure if model paint will wear away in
the water.  This attempt will take place in a friends
pool.  I&#x27;m not sure public pools would take so kindly
to me solving cubes at the bottom.

          <div class="email-content">Richard approached me with this idea and hopefully our Cube Crew in 
Jefferson will be able to help him out with his goal.  Hopefully my 
parents will let me use the pool for a cubing event, and don&#x27;t worry 
i am a certified life gaurd, we are taking safety considerations 
seriously and trying to make it a fun event.

For the cube modifications, i got thinking if we use lubed cubes that 
the silicone will just wash out, making the cubes stiffer than 
usual.  We are hoping to break in cubes just for this event, and add 
weights, and we will have to expeiriment with the colors and see if 
the paint will work.

The whole bathroom break could be the biggest chalenge, anyone who 
was spent any amount of time in a pool, or lake, or ocean, can 
understand the ambundunt amount of trips to the bathroom, unless yo 
decide to contaminate the H2O.  

The snorkel idear won&#x27;t be too hard to rig up...

and our last problem is communication.  Richard had a cool idea of 
putting a penny in a container at the bottom of the pool after each 
solve.  If you guys have any ideas for tallying up solves, that would 
muchly be thanked upon :)

Also feel free to comment on anything, we would like to hear 
everyones ideas, good or bad, naughty or nice, helpful or hateful, 
criticizum or support, we want it all!!!!

I&#x27;ve talked too much

          <div class="email-content">I can talk while cubing, but waht you need to do is teach yourself to 
turn off your brain while doing the cube. It&#x27;s like letting your 
hands have a brain of their own. You can talk or do anything while 
doing it, but you also watch the cube. But your hands should be doing 
it, not your brain.
Hoep this doesn&#x27;t confuse you alot, because it did to me while Iw as 
typing it. ;)

          <div class="email-content">Did you solve it alone, or with an instruction manual? I assume it 
was alone, as it took you 22 years. :)
If you used the book called The Simple Solution to the Rubiks cube, 
then I personally would advise you burn it or something similar. It 
has a good method, but the last layer alone takes about a minute 
using it. Try the book Conquer the Cube, or check out Lars Petrus&#x27; 
page and Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s page.
Or you can use the Simple Solution book if you find a new way to do 
the last layer.

Now, to answer your question: I think I used a layer by layer way the 
first time I solved it, but I don&#x27;t remember. I sort of twisted it in 
a solving-ish manner until it was done. Then I used that book I told 
you about, then I turned to Lars Petrus&#x27; solution.

I assume you&#x27;ve thought of this, but in case you didn&#x27;t, be careful not to make the snorkel very long, unless you have a check valve. Breathing your own CO2, if even just a little more per breath, I believe would be very exhausting over the coarse of 12 hours, or 10 minutes for that matter.<br>
<br>
On the bathroom subject, it&#x27;s chlorinated... who cares. :-)<br>
<br>
How do you intend to stay under water? Perhaps sitting with a cinder block on your lap would help. Just floating, face down at the top, I think would suck. Just my $0.02 USD.<br>

just got a minimum time (for number &quot;9&quot;) of 1 ms!  Anyone ever beat that ;-) <br>

Shame my overall times are rubbish though ... I have still not managed to <br>
get into the 12 second zone, although once I got 13.996 with a maximum time <br>
(for number 2) of 4.5 seconds, so I know it is possible, though how Ron <br>
managed a sub-6 second time is beyond me.  Ron: do you lubricate your mouse <br>

The layer-by-layer method is a great mthod if you want to just solve the cube whenever you feel like it. Most other methods like the one you described is great for trying to solve the cube as fast as possible. If you want to go for speed, do not use the layer-by-layer method. 

As for the last layer... I never could figure out how to fix the bottom edges with the layer-by-layer method. I use the-build-a-2x2x2-cube-and-then-build-a-2x2x3-then-finish-the-two-layers method... What is nice about it is that when I finish the two layers (rather quickly), the bottom edges are already orriented right and it only takes one 9-12 move sequence to fix those.

          <div class="email-content">It is possible for someone to use a layer by layer method and achieve 
sub 50-40 times, but i don&#x27;t think you can get anylower.  the good 
thing about the layer by layer method is that you can easily adapt it 
to the F2l or the Lars method.

I think this will be quite dangerous eaven if you avoid the CO2 problem. Normaly if you dive while holding your breath the increased presure will compress your lungs untill the pressure in your lungs are equal to the water pressure around them. If you plan on breathing via a long snorkel your lungs will be connected to the surface and the presure cant build up. So at 2m deapth you will have a 20% higer water pressure than lung pressure and I think this will put to much stress on your lungs. At least I remember reading about this beeing a reason to avoid long thin snorkels when diving.

remembered hearing that long snorkels were dangerous, but I wasn&#x27;t <br>
sure.  However, I did a little searching, and DON&#x27;T USE A LONG <br>
SNORKEL!!  From an info page on snorkeling:<br>
&gt; Once a diver gets down to about three feet of depth the water<br>
&gt; pressure on the outside of the chest cavity is too much for the<br>
&gt; body to overcome and makes breathing very difficult or not<br>
&gt; possible.<br>
<br>
For the full text, go to http://supersnorkel.com/new_page_6.htm .  To <br>
say &quot;I think this will put to much stress on your lungs&quot; is probably <br>
the nice way of putting it.  If you are 5-7 feet down from the <br>
surface (at the pool&#x27;s bottom), you would probably not be able to <br>
breathe through your snorkel, and would have to come up after just a <br>
couple cubes.<br>
<br>
You may want to consider doing this in a very shallow section of the <br>
pool and/or sit on a chair in the water, so that your head is just <br>
below the surface of the water, and use a normal length snorkel.  <br>
However, I imagine that even the pressure at that depth would get <br>
very physically tiring over the course of 12 hours.  You may have <br>
more success if you could find some way to float, face down in the <br>
water for 12 hours, thus virtually eliminating the water pressure <br>
factor.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Okay, you guys found a point I hadn&#x27;t even thought of<br>
with the pressure differential, but it still stands<br>
with short snorkels, what I was saying. Even with a<br>
short snorkel make sure not to exhale out the same way<br>
that you inhaled. It would lower you VO2 max for each<br>
consecutive breath, because you would always be<br>
inhaling your last breath&#x27;s exhaust.<br>
<br>
I think that the chair on the bottom of the shallow<br>
section is the best idea by far. Maybe I&#x27;ll try this<br>
same endeavor in the ergonomic seats of my spa. What a<br>
great feeling, solving cubes with jets on my back. :-)<br>

Well, I know  nothing about underwater activities, but of couse I 
know that the index of refraction is water is different  from the 
indx of refraction of air. I suppose if a speed cubist and a scuba 
diver are one and the same person, underwater cubing could be done. I 
really would like ro see it, but I don&#x27;t want anyone to be hurt 
because of laws of physics.  I am certainly unable to do it myself. 
Just a  nice, sedentary, cube art is as far as I dare to go. :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
I&#x27;m glad that so many of you have informed me of the snorkel <br>
problem.  I will have to experiment with different lengths (making <br>
sure they are not too long).  The one thing I cannot do, is float <br>
belly down for 12 hours.  I want to actually be under the water.  <br>
With all this new information I think the only way to perform what <br>
I&#x27;m attempting, is to definetly be in the shallow end.  I&#x27;m hoping <br>
it doesn&#x27;t take away from the experience.  Does anyone have any idea <br>
what should be done for communication purposes?  If I need to tell <br>
someone something, I&#x27;d like to be able to write them a message or <br>
something. Also...I had a dream I was snorkeling...and a wasp went <br>
in my snorkel and I inhaled it.  WORST DREAM EVER!  So something <br>
will have to be put over the top to keep insects from attacking me.  <br>
To keep from floating to the top I&#x27;ll either make a weighted belt or <br>
put a padded weight in my lap or something...a lot of time for <br>
planning yet...so its all good.  Thnx for the input everyone :)<br>

Anyway, for communication you could use those signs that are 
waterproof, but washable. They&#x27;re sort of like Whiteboards, but I 
don&#x27;t kow where you&#x27;d get one.

          <div class="email-content">Ok I have an idea for speed sloving. <br>
Now it&#x27;s just an idea so don&#x27;t bark<br>
at me. Anyway, if both the top and<br>
bottom are solved (left and right<br>
for finger tricks) I can solve it<br>
in about 5 seconds (about 1/12 of <br>
my total solving time). I use this<br>
as my default method although I am<br>
begining to realize that solving the<br>
top and bottom layers can be pretty <br>
inefficent (corners and then place<br>
all top and bottom layer edges <br>
indiviually). I was wondering if <br>
there is anybody out there that knows<br>
of a fast approach to this. This <br>
might be a nice Sunday afternoon <br>
kind of project for someone with<br>
someone with free time on their <br>
hands. Another approach might just<br>
be solving the top and bottom layer<br>
edges after solving the corners <br>
because I can solve the corners<br>
relativly fast. All constructive <br>
input will be appriciated. I&#x27;d like<br>
to make sure my method is not good<br>
before I memorie all 40 some odd <br>
orientation and umpteen premutation<br>
combinations. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Thnx for the reply...sorry the more descriptive bit
got deleted.  I know the frustrations that come with
deleting stuff by accident...anyway, i will adress
your list of problems.  1) going to the bathroom. 
This seems to be one of the biggest issues...not
really much i can do about controling that area.  2) 
food and water, although there is a need for such
things, I won&#x27;t be able to have either.  People around
the world go weeks without food, i think i can go 12
hours :P.  3) comfort (temp, etc)  The marathon will
take place during the warm hours of june or july, the
pool should be at a somewhat warm temperature by then.
 I&#x27;ll be able to move around down there as much as I
need to. As suggested earlier by someone, I will
probably wear a weighted belt to keep me under, I
don&#x27;t want to float to the surface during this one.
I&#x27;m going to be in the shallow end with my head only a
couple feet from the surface. 4)foggy goggles.  to be
honest with you, i never thought of that, and it&#x27;s a
good thing you brought it to my attention. 
Unfortunately tho, I don&#x27;t know how to prevent them
from fogging up...if anyone knows how to stop that plz
share.  5)  The insanity.  This one i think scares me
the most.  As i&#x27;ve mentioned before, I&#x27;m not sure how
i will react to being underwater for 12 hours and
knowing my goal is not to reach the surface.  Thats
the beauty of this tho, to test mental boundries.  By
no means will this be any extraordinary physical
achievment.  I&#x27;m curious to see how much my times will
drop tho.  As of now I have a sub-35 second average
with F2L and 4 look, and by then i will have my 3-look
down, so I&#x27;ll most likely be sub-30. Anyways...   If
everything works out allright, I may bring this all to
guiness, but june is far away, only time will tell.

anti-fog spray!...spary the inside of the goggles.<br>
<br>
You should be able to find this at a local paintball store, if there <br>
are any around, or you can order it off the net.. <br>

and countless others.  Also I know my attempt is very
small compared to other things that have taken place. 
At any rate, the biggest thing for me is to prove to
myself I can do this. After this I may go on to try 18
hours, 24 hours, etc.  Only time will tell in that
case.  It would be unrealistic of me to try something
on a large scale right away... i can&#x27;t picture myself
underwater for 2 days.  When and if i complete my
task, guiness will be my next step.  As far as renting
the tanks go...I dont have the money for such
things...otherwise i would have been all over

          <div class="email-content">OK ...<br>
<br>
Test 1: 100 cases out of 43252003274489900000, margin of error = 0.127 <br>

<br>
Test 2: 10 cases out of 1212, margin of error = 0.57 moves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Can someone please explain what seems to me an anomaly?  In both tests the <br>
margin of results was four [moves] (16-19; 11-14) with similar distribution. <br>
  Why is the margin of error not wider in the first test, considering the <br>
tiny sample space that it occupies?<br>

&gt;Just for fun I used Cube Explorer to solve 10 random last layers,<br>
&gt;optimally.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The mean was 12.8 moves<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;one case required 11 moves, 2 cases required 12, 4 were 13, 2 were 14.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Because of the small sample, the 95% confidence level was relatively<br>
&gt;wide,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;(12.23,13.37)...but, according to Helmsetter, the average of the 1212<br>

   You might want to pracice for a few hours with your hands
underwater, but your head above. The reason for this, beside testing
which cubes will work underwater for a long time, is that your hands
might swell up. This can happen within an hour and a half.

          <div class="email-content">Lars! You do have a sense of humor. Now what do you think about my 3d 
designs as they appear in http://cube.misto.cz ? Just a nice, 
easygoing pastime, like the artists themselves. Guinness is nnot 
involved at all. We are just exhibiting, not competing. BYW, I fail 
to understand the scramble for records.

All you need to know in 3d design construction is parity-pair induced 
design symmetry and some judicious twiddling. No program exist to 
accomplish this task. That is another thung I don&#x27;t understand. Why 
rely so much on computer prgrams, when we have brains to figure 
things ourselves.

&gt; Hi everybody.<br>
&gt; I&#x27;m having problems with the scrambling algs. for 4x4x4, 5x5x5, <br>
&gt; pyraminx and Megaminx.<br>
This is an idea I came up with a while ago for scrambling larger <br>
cubes.  I&#x27;m not going to offer to code it at this point, but it <br>
shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.  The basic idea is to define a priority to <br>
each of the slices in the cube (faces included), kind of like what <br>
Richard did for blindfold cubing, and restrict allowed scrambling <br>
moves based on this priority.  For example, the slices on a 4x4x4, in <br>
order of priority (highest to lowest), would be U, u, d, D, F, f, b, <br>
B, R, r, l, L.  After any given move is applied, the next move must <br>
be either:<br>
1) perpendicular to the previous move or<br>
2) parallel to the previous move, but of lower priority<br>
<br>
In other words, if my first random move is d2, then it cannot be <br>
followed by any moves of U, u, or d.  Another restriction is that <br>
you&#x27;d have to make sure you only move N-1 parallel slices in <br>
succession on an NxNxN cube.  For example, on a 4x4x4 cube, the <br>
sequence U2 u&#x27; d D&#x27; should not be allowed, even though it is in <br>
proper, descending order, based on priority.  That sequence would be <br>
the same as y&#x27; U&#x27; D2, which is only 2 moves, instead of the desired 4.<br>
<br>
A similar approach can be used for the megaminx, I think, though I <br>
haven&#x27;t thought this through as much.  Define priorities for each <br>
side, starting with U, ending with D, and numbering the upper faces <br>
higher than the lower faces.  Then, instead of worrying about <br>
parallel vs. perpendicular (as on the cubes), only allow moves of <br>
adjacent or lower priority faces.  For example, after a move of the U <br>
face, any other face may be moved.  However, after a move of the D <br>
face, only one of the 5 lower faces may be moved.  I think this will <br>
avoid any negating moves.<br>
<br>
Make sense?<br>
<br>
With the pyraminx, you could almost just pick a random state, and <br>
create the generator for it, since minimal solutions are so short for <br>
it.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents.<br>

The alpha level we picked was 0.05, so the z-score used is 1.96.<br>
<br>
So, the first case is 1.96*(.65/10)= .127<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jess, <br>
<br>
Thanks for your timer. <br>
I made my own program but I lost. <br>
<br>
In my case, I used three variables for one move. <br>
<br>
1. dimension (FB), (RL), (UD)<br>
2. slice F or B, etc. <br>
3. turns 1,2,3 (F, F2, F&#x27; , etc)<br>
<br>
Then, I avoid consecutive dimensions. <br>
So neutralizing moves should not happen. <br>
(I can&#x27;t remember I added one more thing)<br>
<br>
For 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, you can add more slices. <br>
This is not real randomization but I think it is good enough. <br>
<br>
Hope this will help. <br>

the 2x2 cube has a very different mechanism than the 3x3 does.  So 
its different when trying to take them apart.  Taking apart the 2x2 
isnt the hard part, the hard part is putting it back together just 
right.  What I would do is just see if you can open up a little gap 
in the cube without taking it apart, and sparying in some lube 
then.  then work the cube around for awhile, let the lube dry inside 
the cube.  After that have fun.  You wont even have to worry about 
taking the stupid thing apart.

Here&#x27;s my feedback - I think that your expectation is unrealistic!  <br>
Just for fun, I pulled up a 100x100x100 cube on my screen.  Even with <br>
the cube overlapping the top and bottom of my screen, the larger <br>
facelets were only 2-3 pixels, at best.  I think the only way that <br>
this would be reasonably possible is on a 25&quot; or larger monitor <br>
running with 1600+pixels vertically.  Even then, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be <br>
interested in spending the months of my time on it that it would take <br>
(not to mention time for sleeping, eating, etc.).<br>

I don&#x27;t think it can be done in two days - even working around the 
clock - unless there are people around who are amazingly fast that 
we don&#x27;t know about. Also, you&#x27;d need an enormous, high resolution 
monitor.

I think you might be pushing it to get a 50x50x50 done in the time 
the championships last. Remember that the time taken to solve a cube 
is going to be roughly quadratic in the size of the cube (because 
the centres take quadratic time, the edges linear time and the 
corners constant time). Therefore, a 100x100x100 cube should take 
approximately 9 times as long as a 33x33x33 cube (although you will 
also lose time counting which layer you are on, so it may be longer 
yet). It would probably take over 3 days of non-stop cubing and 
maybe up to 4.

Given that nobody, as far as I know can finish the 33x33x33 in under 
5.5 hours (or even quite a bit longer) it follows that it should 
take well over 2 days to solve this. If teams are working on it then 
their strategies may not be compatible either - e.g. centres first 
vs centres last.

40x40x40 may be realistic - but I wouldn&#x27;t be going for it as I need 
to try and set a few records to get some free holiday and if I have 
a go at 40x40x40 I may use up almost all of my time in Canada (which 
will probably, at the time of writing, be under 30 hours).

Almost certainly it would have to be done by somebody who doesn&#x27;t 
submit times on oinkleburger because I don&#x27;t think there who could 
get that size done in the allotted time.

As far as I&#x27;m aware nobody has done bigger than 31x31x31 so far so 
40x40x40 would be well above that anyway - but unless you know of 
someone (or indeed a team of people) who can solve the 33x33x33 in 
under 5.5 hours (and have round-the-clock access to the venue) I 
don&#x27;t think the 100x100x100 can be done.

completed my whole f2l not worrying about the cross.  I think this <br>
could possibbly be an effiecent method to some extent.  I know some <br>
of you are gonna say... &quot;youll end up wasting more algs putting in <br>
the edges to the cross,&quot;  and yes, you probably will.  Unless you <br>
come with some sort of algs that places an edge for your cross <br>
integrated with a final layer alg.  I was thinking that possibly you <br>
could perform one alg that places edge1 and orientates corners, edge <br>
2 cross edge and permute corners, than since youre left with only <br>
edges to fix, how bout an alg to place the last 2 cross pieces, and <br>
an alg to complete the edges?  <br>
This may be way to crazy, but all in all the f2l will be a lot <br>
easier, and faster, but you are left with a messy final step.  I <br>

the general consensus?  I&#x27;m sure some people will show up early and <br>
some later but is 5 days about when everyone plans on being there?  <br>
So everyone has set Monday August 18th as the day to show up (for all <br>
us early people)?<br>

I only ask for the specifics because I would like to go ahead and buy <br>
my plane tickets.  Also is there a plan for lodgings?  Does everyone <br>
want to stay in the same hotel?  Can we all stay in <br>

          <div class="email-content">Sorry to take up a lot of space with posts but I have one more thing 
to add.  I just talked to Dan Gosbee through e-mail and he said that 
as far as the hotel goes, the Holiday Inn where the competitors will 
be staying will allow the same lowered rate for competitors 
regardless if you show up early or not.  I assume that means as long 
as you show up within a certain time frame.  Anyway Dan said that the 
website for the competition will show all the info about lodging 
after it has been updated (I think around May 15th or so).  So I 
guess if anyone knows for sure when they want to arrive in Toronto 
then go ahead and let me know (I&#x27;m curious when to show up myself) 
but I guess it would also work to wait until we know more about 
lodgings.

Later all,
Chris

F2L (first two layers) basically describes any method in which you 
solve the first and second layer at the same time.  The two most 
popular methods are starting with a cross(solve all 4 edges) on the 
first layer, and then inserting each of the 4 corner-edge pairs.  
Most known as the Fridrich method. 
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html   Then there is Lars 
Petrus&#x27;s method.  In which you solve a 2x2x2 corner on the cube, 
expand it to a 2x2x3 block, and so on.  
http://www.lar5.com/cube/index.html 

Or some people (like me) use a varation of those two methods.

          <div class="email-content">I recently contacted Meffert&#x27;s about purchasing individual pieces for <br>
a 4x4x4 cube.  Mr. Meffert, although extremely helpful, was not able <br>
to find anything, as he is discontinuing his line of Revenge cubes.  <br>
Before I go through the tedious, weeklong process of e-mailing <br>
Hessport&#x27;s on the subject, does anyone know where I can purchase a <br>
SINGLE cubie for my 4x4x4 cube?  It&#x27;s one of the four middle pieces <br>
that fits inside the track on the center orb.  It only has one face <br>
showing on the outside of the cube, as opposed to edges that have 2 <br>
and corners that have 3.  Does anyone have this piece laying around <br>
that they could sell?  Or can anyone point me in the right direction <br>
for a vendor of such randomness?  Any input would be much appreciated!<br>

haha... I just had to say that to annoy you :)

Here is what I do.

Take notice that if you do R&#x27;U over and over with a solved cube, it will eventual solve itself. The same principle applies with learning these methods. I always did the sequence over and over again, one right after the other from the state that needs to be solved. The method keeps applying itself over and over and you will solve it once, mess it up a few times, and it will solve itself again. I was able to memorize two sequences a day with this method. I am not sure if anyone else does it this way. This ia lot better than trying to solve the cube, apply the sequence to help solve it, mess up the cube, then solve it again. That is a waste of time. Plus, what are you going to do if you are learning sequences that need to be applied once every 20 times or so? You would waste a lot of time trying to solve the cube to the desired state :)

          <div class="email-content">I memorized them by association.  You can use either a story or the 
algorithm itself.  For example when you see the situation that you 
want to know the algorithm for, pick some random object that happens 
to be nearby; the subject of what&#x27;s on TV, or radio, or whatever song 
you&#x27;re listening to and associate it with the situation.  By 
associate just sort of think of them together and consider them 
the &quot;same&quot; thing.  That way when you think of one you&#x27;ll think of the 
other.  Then do one move and either pick a new object, or how the 
subject changed on TV, the song, the radio, etc. and do a new 
association.  It also works to associate the visual image you see 
after you do the first turn to the image you see before you do any 
turns.  For example I see a situation for the alg I just tried to 
memorize.  Once I see the situation, I recall what the cube looks 
like after I do the first turn.  I&#x27;ve associated what the cube looks 
like after the first turn to what I see before I do anything.  Then 
after I do the first turn I recall what the cube looks like after the 
second turn.  After the second turn I recall the third, etc. etc..  I 
don&#x27;t know if that makes any sense at all but it worked for me.  
After a while I started to think of the algorithms as macros of hand 
movements, rather that single turns.  So I would group maybe 5 moves 
together and say &quot;well those just feel sort of like this&quot; and I would 
remember the algs based on how it felt to do them.

Hope that helps some,

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m 14, and my average is about 30 seconds. With a good cube, anyway. 
Right now I don&#x27;t have a good cube, so my times are around 40 to 
fifty seconds.
I think that most of the sub 20 cubists are over 18, but there are 
probably a few out there. I would definitely suggest you to compete. 
Anyone who has a time under a minute should compete, in my opinion. 
I&#x27;ve heard that the youngest cuber coming is five years old who can 
solve it in 2 minutes or so. Cool, huh?

          <div class="email-content">My favorite way is first just completely clear your mind of <br>
everything, then do the algorithm, then do it again, then do it <br>
again, then do it again, then do it again, then do it again, then do <br>
it again, and so forth and so forth and so forth and so forth and so <br>
forth and so forth... After a while, look away from the paper or <br>
screen or whatever, then do it. Wow, you&#x27;ve memorized to do it! <br>
Usually. If not, then do it again with the paper, and look away <br>
whenever you feel comfortable. Then once you can do it without the <br>
paper, then DON&#x27;T STOP doing it. If you go away at this point, you <br>
will forget EVERYTHING. Usually. Just do it without looking at the <br>
paper over and over and over and over and over and over and over. And <br>
over. THEN leave. Go do something else, come back a half hour later, <br>
and do it again and again and again and again and again and again and <br>
again. You should have it COMPLETELY imprinted into your subconcious <br>
mind now, so you&#x27;ll never have to look at the stupid piece of paper <br>
again, which by now you doubtlessly hate with a passion.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Cubing one handed would be fun and a nice trick to show your friends. Maybe you can even bet you can solve the Rubik&#x27;s cube one handed in under a minute (I believe it is possible). The thing I do not get is solving it using your feet. That, in my opinion, is being too obsessed with the cube. Note: anyone that is doing this, by all means do it, I am not going to make fun of you :)

I cannot find any videos of people solving the cube blindfolded. I know some can do it in 3 minutes. I would not mind seeing such a video. 

I have been thinking about trying to solve the cube in a mirror.. but I might hold off on that. I am trying to get fast the normal way and I do not need to go off and confuse myself :)

          <div class="email-content">There are five or six people at my 1200 student college who can solve the
cube at all, and most of us are under 1:30. I am the fastest, at 48 seconds.
That is with two hands. I have tried to do it one handed and I can&#x27;t break 5
minutes. People think I&#x27;m amazing enough being able to do it (two handed) at
all. If I even tried to learn how to be quick one handed it would turn me
into a celebrity(like I&#x27;m not one already, and I hate being one :-p). Of
course, that&#x27;s what got me into my situation in the first place. I just
liked the prospect of being able to solve it at all, let alone in under a
minute.
 
I&#x27;m rambling. Anyway, like I said, I can&#x27;t even break 5 minutes, but I would
suspect that you need a loose cube, large hands (mine are way too small to
do it one handed effectively(as far as I know), even though they are a
decent size), and a heck of a lot more time on your hands than if you were
just learning regular. But we already knew that, didn&#x27;t we?

Well hello again. Curiosity has stabed me in the back again and I was 
curious, how exactly do you get so fast one handed? What kind of 
finger tricks do you use? If someone has a video of this I would much 
appricate it. Maybe it&#x27;s just a severe case of too much free time 
(pot calling the kettle black).

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s really fun to think of the sptupidest, weirdest things you can 
do with the cube. One handed, with feet, underwater, pogo-sticking(I 
ALMOST did this, I was about five moves away then I fell...) 
unicycling(I&#x27;m learning how to do this), jumproping(never tried 
this, the idea popped into my head today) in a mirror, etc. I&#x27;ve 
done all of these, except the ones I said that I haven&#x27;t.
Another fun thing is to race with your left hand against your right 
hand. Not at the same time, as this would be haard, but separately. 
For me, the left hand is faster, for most, the right hand is faster. 
But it would be cool to improve your non-dominant hand to the point 
where it&#x27;s about as good as your dominant one.

for awhile now, although not all that often, i&#x27;ve been attempting to 
solve a cube while juggling a cube and 2 balls. the juggling pattern 
needs to be adjusted a bit, but it is do-able...takes about 3 weeks, 
but it&#x27;s do-able

never finished tho...got f2l done, and had enough.
maybe someday

also, juggling with one hand, and solving with the other is a good 
challenge

   I downloaded the video (I LOVE the rest of your vids, BTW!!!) and <br>
it showed that you spread the glue across the entire face of the cube <br>
with wreckless abandon.  Now, it may just be that I&#x27;m a newbie to <br>
cubing, but I&#x27;ve always conisdered the inside of the cube, the parts <br>
that rub together, to be &#x27;holy ground&#x27; of sorts, and I never let <br>
ANYTHING that isn&#x27;t super-slick get within a 5 foot radius of this <br>
area.  How is it that you can just spread the glue on the cube, <br>
ignoring the fact that it could, and probably will seep down into the <br>
face of the cube?<br>
<br>
   Being a newbie, I disassembled my 3x3x3 (just a new Oddizon,) <br>
sanded down every surface of the interior mechanism, then before <br>
putting it together, superglued vinyl electrical tape to the surface, <br>
making sure, of course, not to let any glue leak onto the &#x27;holy land&#x27; <br>
of the inside surface.<br>

Neoprene glue does not seep down into the cube. Just rub your finger
over the excess glue.

So Guiness will be there? Really? Last time you wrote that they were 
still deciding. Well, they must have decided.

And how about cube art? How many people are exhibiting in that 
category?

Recently Ifound a connection between chiral symmetry and parity pairs.
But this is more interdisciplinary science than cbe art.

Memorization is a bad word in my vocabulary. I scrupulously try to 
avoid it. In cube art you don&#x27;t memorize, you visualize. But then  
again, you don&#x27;t have to be as fast.

          <div class="email-content">*and OF COURSE GUINESS WILL BE THERE..ITS A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP

hehe.. I have no knowledge of this &quot;championship.&quot; I just figured this thing was popular and I was tired of seeing 22.95 the record when I have seen countless videos of people solving it under.

How could that have stood as the record for 21 years is my question...

22.95 is still the official record however the record we are &lt;BR>
targeting amongst club members is of course 16.92 set by our very own &lt;BR>
Jesse Bonde last December&lt;BR>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] 4x4x4 Pieces<br>
<br>
<br>
  I recently contacted Meffert&#x27;s about purchasing individual pieces for <br>
  a 4x4x4 cube.  Mr. Meffert, although extremely helpful, was not able <br>
  to find anything, as he is discontinuing his line of Revenge cubes.  <br>
  Before I go through the tedious, weeklong process of e-mailing <br>
  Hessport&#x27;s on the subject, does anyone know where I can purchase a <br>
  SINGLE cubie for my 4x4x4 cube?  It&#x27;s one of the four middle pieces <br>
  that fits inside the track on the center orb.  It only has one face <br>
  showing on the outside of the cube, as opposed to edges that have 2 <br>
  and corners that have 3.  Does anyone have this piece laying around <br>
  that they could sell?  Or can anyone point me in the right direction <br>
  for a vendor of such randomness?  Any input would be much appreciated!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I went to the Guinness site last night to see if I could answer my own question, but that site has no record of it because they want you to buy the book. But they also have a form that you can fill out to claim your attempt at breaking a record. I thought one could just fill that out and if the committee or whatever thought it is highly possible (s)he will break the record, they will come out without a Championship. But, I don&#x27;t know. It is not like I every tried breaking a record :)

          <div class="email-content">For all those who have solved a cube one-handed (no matter how <br>
slowly), I was wondering what what was your method?<br>
I am particularly interested in what Chris hardwick does since he is <br>
so fast, but everyone please respond.<br>
I do F2L as per normal system that Jessica made popular (ie cross <br>
then 4 corner-edge pairs), but the last layer I do by permuting <br>
corners, orientating corners, permuting edges, orientating edges. <br>
There is no way I could do a 2-look last layer (orient all then <br>
permute all) as I don&#x27;t consciously know what any of the algorithms <br>
are. Does anybody else do a 2-look last layer, and if so did you have <br>
to relearn them to do one-handed?<br>

Stiff hands is not going to help you solve it one-handed ;)

I do F2L as per normal system that Jessica made popular (ie cross &lt;BR>

corners, orientating corners, permuting edges, orientating edges. &lt;BR>
There is no way I could do a 2-look last layer (orient all then &lt;BR>
permute all) as I don&#x27;t consciously know what any of the algorithms &lt;BR>
are. Does anybody else do a 2-look last layer, and if so did you have &lt;BR>

The best method I have come across so far.

          <div class="email-content">I guess for the most part I use the Fridrich speed system, the only 
exception being that I pay a lot of attention to fewest moves as 
well.  When I see a pair during the F2L I don&#x27;t just automatically 
solve that one (which I would do in speedcubing).  I try to see if 
there is pair that takes less moves, or is in a better position for 
however my hand is gripping the cube at that time.  I do use extended 
cross solves a lot when doing it one handed, however my personal 
fastest time (38.37 sec) I did just solving the cross and 4 pairs.

I do use the normal 2-look LL for one handed.  Most of the algs 
translated well over to one hand for me and were not hard to get used 
to, however some of them I found I knew but I didn&#x27;t.  When I had the 
cube in both hands I can do the alg, but with only one hand I would 
draw a blank.  I think I only have maybe 2 or 3 algs left that still 
give me problems, but yeah I basically just had to practice the algs 
with one hand and &quot;re-learn&quot; them as you say.  Most of the algs were 
easy to get used to though.

The real secret, in my opinion, is not in the method or cool finger 
tricks, it&#x27;s having a good cube.  If you have a good, looooose, cube 
and you practice a lot anyone could get sub-50 second times.

I suppose the only unique thing to one handed cubing, that I do, is 
one handed &quot;triggers&quot;.  Really all this is, is utilizing all of my 
fingers to turn sequences of two faces in quick succession.  Just try 
to use all your fingers and you can do some cool stuff.

Hope this helps,
Chris

Hi Chris L,

   If the Mefferts cube is the same size and type as the Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4
then you can get replacement pieces at rubiks.com

          <div class="email-content">Three or four weeks ago I figured why don&#x27;t I try the Rubik&#x27;s cube (I had it since Christmas but lost interest shortly afterwards). It took two weeks, but I got all my friends to buy a cube.. and I am sure they all will get their friends to buy cubes. I, a shy and unnoticable person, has started some fad in my school :) I practice everyday when I can. I am practicing hoping that I will be a sub-25 seconds cuber.

I hope that it becomes an annual event... I doubt I could make it to Toronto. I will be starting college at the same time. However, if I do go it will be a last minute decision :) I won&#x27;t compete but just hang around and meet some of you :)

I was improving so well i personally received an email from Ron saying how well (and fast) i improved.  the real fact is that anyone can DO it, it&#x27;s just the fact of DOING it.  instead of sleep, you work your brain (maybe not for like a genius, but for me it was tuff).  im in the same area as Ryan (30 second average), however i haven&#x27;t had the time to practice lately...

          <div class="email-content">I have a rubik&#x27;s studio cube, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, its <br>
really great.  I just have a little question.  I have a couple faces <br>
that move really great, but the other 4 just turn with a little more <br>
resistance.  I have narrowed the problem down to the center pieces.  <br>
It seems that the smoother the center pieces turn (when the cube is <br>
apart), the smoother that face turns when the whole cube is put back <br>
together.  Has anyone else observed this?  And if so, does anyone <br>
have any advice as to how to get the other 4 center pieces to move <br>
more smoothly. I can turn the slow center pieces and hear <br>
the &quot;creaking&quot; of the spring.  I dunno if this has anything to do <br>
with it. <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m hesitant to unscrew the center pieces, because the plastic is so <br>
soft I fear that from previous times of unscrewing and re-tightening <br>
will lead to the stripping of the inside.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help in advance!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I am starting to seriously think that the cube I got, being my only one and the first one I even owned, is one of those bad apples you guys get every once in a while :( I played with it for a while, loosened it up (pieces pop out now), and lubed it afterward. I even sanded it some. The center pieces are real loose now... but when I put the whole cube together, it twists with the same resistance it always has :( Any suggestions? My pieces rug against each other with too much resistance.

          <div class="email-content">I already tried his method, it did speed up my cube to what it is 
now, but again, I don&#x27;t want to tweak the screws anymore than I have 
to right now. And spraying silicone on the pieces has nothing to do 
with getting the CENTER pieces to twist smoother, it has something 
to do with the springs inside the centers I think.  Thanks though 
James.

          <div class="email-content">The mirror thing is wicked confusing.  Tried this a while back.   Also, when we talk about one handed here, are we holding the cube in one hand and not letting it touch anything else?  Or are you allowed to use say your lap or a table to push against?  The latter is much much more difficult.

  Cubing one handed would be fun and a nice trick to show your friends. Maybe you can even bet you can solve the Rubik&#x27;s cube one handed in under a minute (I believe it is possible). The thing I do not get is solving it using your feet. That, in my opinion, is being too obsessed with the cube. Note: anyone that is doing this, by all means do it, I am not going to make fun of you :)

  I cannot find any videos of people solving the cube blindfolded. I know some can do it in 3 minutes. I would not mind seeing such a video. 

  I have been thinking about trying to solve the cube in a mirror.. but I might hold off on that. I am trying to get fast the normal way and I do not need to go off and confuse myself :)

  I&#x27;ve started practicing one handed pretty seriously lately and the &lt;BR>
  only secret is to 1) use a good cube and 2) practice a lot.�� That is &lt;BR>
  if you want to get fast.�� As far as finger tricks your cube has to be &lt;BR>
  very very very loose.�� They&#x27;re not really finger tricks (at least &lt;BR>
  what I do when I &quot;trigger&quot; one handed).�� I can do turns like (U&#x27;R) &lt;BR>
  and (R&#x27;D) pretty quickly by doing the first turn with my index finger &lt;BR>
  and then doing the second turn with my ring finger.�� Seriously though &lt;BR>
  the only secret is a very loose cube and lots of practice, at least &lt;BR>
  from what I&#x27;ve noticed.�� So it really is just a case of having too &lt;BR>
  much time on your hands :)&lt;BR>
  &lt;BR>

  &lt;BR>
  P.S. for everyone that&#x27;s asked me about a video of me doing the cube &lt;BR>
  one handed, I&#x27;m working on getting it on the internet, but I do have &lt;BR>
  a video.�� I might be able to get that up pretty soon, anyway I&#x27;ll let &lt;BR>
  everyone know.&lt;BR>

Wow!!  That pretty much sums up my opinion :-)  I&#x27;m lucky if I can <br>
memorize more than 3-4 in a week and not get them confused, so I&#x27;d <br>
say you&#x27;re doing great.  Of course, I don&#x27;t have hours per day to <br>

Also, when we talk about one handed here, are we holding the cube in 
one hand and not letting it touch anything else?  Or are you allowed 
to use say your lap or a table to push against?  The latter is much 
much more difficult.

handed in under a minute (I believe it is possible). The thing I do 
not get is solving it using your feet. That, in my opinion, is being 
too obsessed with the cube. Note: anyone that is doing this, by all 
means do it, I am not going to make fun of you :)

I know some can do it in 3 minutes. I would not mind seeing such a 
video.

but I might hold off on that. I am trying to get fast the normal way

of the sides, can it touch your other hand to push one of the sides? 
Just my opinion.

          <div class="email-content">I think it is a good idea to try different algs for the same <br>
situation and then pick the one you like the best. Don&#x27;t just take <br>
the ones from Jessicas page, also check out other algs on other <br>
pages... an excellent one <br>
is &quot;http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/PetersCubePage.html&quot;<br>
&gt; Ok I know all of you sub-25 cubists out there didn&#x27;t just learn <br>
all <br>
&gt; 50 some odd total algorythems over night. I finally got out a pen <br>
&gt; last night and copied the orientations and premutations from <br>
&gt; Jessica&#x27;s site. As all you you know it&#x27;s a brain full. I was <br>
&gt; wondering if anyone had a sufficent method for memorizing these. I <br>
&gt; know everyone is going to say hard work bla bla bla, and I know it <br>
&gt; won&#x27;t come to me overnight but I was wondering if you had ideas on <br>
&gt; how you memorized it. Thanks.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thank you DanG,

This video is the one that thought that I want to shoot from the 
first.
However, it is the sample of in the meantime because it might not be 
an official measuring method.  
Needless to say, I am enjoying the Speed Cubing.  

And, I think that should there are many persons who are able to shoot 
the one that is excellent even from my video.  
I want to see those videos really. And I want to learn many case.


> ps-you in the Japanese Championships in august?

There is not the feeling that I have august.
Even in the Championships of Japan, I am enjoying the Speed Cubing.  
Speed Cubists are increasing little by little, even in Japan.
This is a very desirable case, needless to say even I am the one.
I am starting the LBL method from about May, 2001.

The speed cube is really interesting.

Welcome to the group Steve!  wow, you used to do the cube in 20 
seconds but now you cant remember anything?? jeez, i guess 20 years 
is a long time.  Check out the links section of this group.  There 
you will find many sites with information.

Well, Dan, I am a female cubist. I even plan to go to Toronto, 
although I will not compete. I will exhibit 3-dimensional, sculpture-
like cube art.You cinstruct your sculpture and create a pattern that 
has to be symmetric on all the design&#x27;s faces. To see those designs, 
visit http://cube.misto.cz and look around. Can you guys lay aside 
your cubes for a few minutes and find for mwe other designers who can 
do this? I am unable to fiund anyone and I have been looking for 5-6 
years. A name and contact information will be appreciated. Thanks.

Well, that&#x27;s woman&#x27;s work...it never gets done. :-)

I remember a conversation thread a while ago pointing out that there 
were very few female speedcubers. I don&#x27;t know why this is so. I love 
the cube, and the Revenge and the Professor cube. It&#x27;s obviously 
something that attracts guys more often than girls. But, to reiterate 
your question, WHY? I&#x27;m sure that there are just as many girls who 
have the ability/intelligence to solve a cube, but if this group is 
anything to go by, the girls just don&#x27;t seem to be interested!

What do others (particularly other female cubers) think?

          <div class="email-content">Thanks.  Yes, many years ago when I was at UCLA, I was in a group.  There was a pattern where you would locate only two squares on the cube and from there it was a matter of a definite pattern.  I could hold the cube behind my back and complete the pattern - amazed everyone.  I just rediscovered the cube and have been playing with it for a week or so.  I can solve it in about 5-10 minutes, but it is very frustrating not to do as well as I did years ago.  I&#x27;ll check out the links section.  Thanks again.  Steve

          <div class="email-content">You are  female cubist, I am a femle cubist, and Jessica Fridrich is 
a female cubist. Of the three of us, Jessica is probably the best 
known, particularly in speed cubing, where she is the author of one 
of the speed cubing methods. I am not a speed cubist at all, just a 
cube artist. :-)

Why so few femles? Beats me. Probably for the same reason there are 
few female mathematicians, physicists and engineers.

          <div class="email-content">Best two handed time is around 23 seconds, best average would be about 33, average average, closer to 35 :)

I switched to my smoother cube for 1 handed and my times have become much better, closer to the 1.5-2 minute range.

I&#x27;ve finally bit down and started to memorize a 2 look LL algorithm set though, so hopefully I will soon be at competative times!  (or at least 25 second area).

  Those times aren&#x27;t bad. My average for feet would be about 7-8 
  minutes I think. With one hand, my average is 1 minute 30 seconds.
  What&#x27;s your time with two hands?

Both skills are required to solve the cube unless the intuition abilities are way more advanced than a normal human being. Me, for example, I solve puzzles mainly on intuition. I am fairly good at it. I am working my way to solve Square-1. Last night I fooled around with it and it took me about 5 minutes to get it into a square shape.

The logic I use is to either confirm what my intution says or to solve it because my intuition is not much help.

Make it two girls. I like math very much, in spite of the fact that I 
am a physicist (and a cube rtist). you have to be able to formulate 
math principles, if you want to go 3-dimensional.

I finished just before the movie ended. Now, I can do it in eight

          <div class="email-content">Cubing in public is a lot of fun and good
practice...You have to keep something in mind tho, we
don&#x27;t want to convince everyone who sees us with the
cube, that its near impossible to solve.  That will
only scare people away, and we want our speedsolving
group to grow. Kinda on a side note tho, i encourage
anyone who has &quot;stagefright&quot; with the cube should cube
in public A LOT b4 the championships (if you&#x27;re going)
 My first solves in public were brutal.  My hands
shook and it was really hard to concentrate.  After a
while you can just get used to it and now i&#x27;m fine. 
It seems like its easier to do in front of strangers
tho.  I&#x27;ve never been arrogant enough to look away at
people during the solve but i&#x27;m sure thats fun too. 
I&#x27;ll be  impressed when someone solves the WHOLE cube
while giving me a stare, not just the PLL.

I do that all the time. Also, talking while solving impresses many. <br>

A real cheesy trick is to not show the cube when it&#x27;s done, but throw <br>

cube is solved, an even blurrier blur while it&#x27;s in the air, and then <br>

 -Really? I guess cubing is all about impressing
people.  I was just saying it may scare people off,
but if I wanted to do that, I&#x27;d show them your method.

Hehe. This reminds me about an online temperament test I took about two weeks ago. It told me I was an INTJ. I researched that type over the Internet and found out I am the same type that Hitler was. I am represent a small minority; 1% of the population. SCARY.

But I am always obsessed about something. For two years it was rocketry. For another few years, computers. Now it is math, but this has lasted longer than any other. Rubik&#x27;s cube is it for now. I hope to stay with this for many years :)

          <div class="email-content">One could always go to a popular movie theater in town and solve it in the lobby. The AMC here in Atlanta, GA USA can get very crowded on weekends. Concerts, malls, ect are good too. I am too nervous to try that with people right now. I can solve the cube around a minute now... impressive to people that can&#x27;t solve the cube but not so impressive to myself.

agree!  But since we are on the topic of Siamese cubes, how many <br>
people have them and what kind of time do you get?  I have one and I <br>
use all of my same algs.  Solving corners first helps a lot on the <br>
Siamese.  I haven&#x27;t played with it for a while, but I remember being <br>
very pleased with my times.  I think that I will go play with it some <br>
more and post my times.  Anyway I bought a Siamese from Mefferts, and <br>
it was a piece of junk!!  So I used the connecting pieces form the <br>
Mefferts cube and the pieces of two of my speedcubes to make the <br>
Siamese cube.  The end result was a very nice Siamese speedcube.<br>

Well this past weekend I went to a prom w/ a friend who lives sorta 
far away, and took the cube to the after prom thing sponosored by 
the school.  I knew quite a few people there, but there were wayyy 
more that i didn&#x27;t know.  I was told to show some ppl the cube.  So 
they would mix it up and ask, &quot;okay whos gonna solve this thing?&quot;  I 
said..umm i dont know, i cant do it lol.  Then they made me do 
it....then again, and again.  After that we went to a party and a 
couple of the people there knew i could do the cube, so they told me 
to do it some more.  

So usually when i do the cube infront of people i dont know, friends 
i know want to see me solve it again and tell every body to come 
watch this! haha, its always fun:)

Why so few femles? Beats me. Probably for the same

few female mathematicians, physicists and engineers.

<br>
Apparently, somebody found my website amongst other Rubiks related <br>
stuff, and thought I might like it, so they sent it to me.  They (the <br>
company that makes it) were wondering if I thought other people that <br>
are into the cube would enjoy the puzzle.  Check it out at <br>
http://www.brain-chek.com/ - I got the PhD version, and can now <br>
successfully solve the &quot;PhD with Honors&quot; difficulty.<br>

Tell me what you think of the concept of the puzzle, and if you think <br>
you&#x27;d enjoy it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, i have been cubing since its release,
early 80&#x27;s i think, i still have my original cube. I
lubed it with vaseline and it is very free moving and
fast. i have had many low 20 second achievements but
to get times around 14, 15, 16 seconds like i have
been reading......I think that those cubes arent
messed-up enough aaaaaaahahaha.

I do have some short cut moves that might help some of
you, they can place several colours in their correct
positions, no matter where they are. I will post them
tomorrow.

To all, happy twisting plastic blocks.

Well this has been somewhat bugging me for awhile. It
seems like 
there arn&#x27;t that many people who can achive sub-25 or
so. Would this 
be in fact because it is such a hard thing to do, or
is the speed 
cubing community so small, and that most people within
don&#x27;t spend 
excessive amouts of time with it (I&#x27;m talking 5-6
hours a day not an 
hour or 2). Mostly I&#x27;m just trying to spark new
conversation. That 
also leads me to another question. Is the rubiks cube
getting 
popular enough again that they are going to hold
another tournament 
after Toranto? Unfortunatly I can&#x27;t go to Toranto
because of money 
and my ability as of now. I&#x27;m assuming that if I stick
with it I 
could be competiton ability in maybe a few months. Is
this going to 
become an anual event?

          <div class="email-content">Forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong, but you&#x27;re fairly new around here, right?  I <br>
think most people here probably use Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer when taking an <br>
average (Go to the downloads section at http://www.Rubiks.dk to get <br>
it).  It provides a random 25 move scrambling algorithm that fairly <br>
effectively scrambles the cube.<br>
<br>
In the past, however, this group has gone through several discussions <br>
about how long the longest and average solutions would be using God&#x27;s <br>
algorithm (shortest possible solution for any given cube state), as <br>
well as how many random moves are enough to sufficiently scramble the <br>
cube.  I think that during the discussions, most people agreed that <br>
we don&#x27;t really know enough to determine how many moves are <br>
sufficient for scrambling algorithms, but 25 has long been the <br>
standard.  I have often wondered if we should use something more like <br>
30-40 random moves for scrambling, but there has yet to be any <br>
definitive statement on this from anyone.<br>
<br>
Regardless of how many moves are required by God&#x27;s algorithm, though, <br>
these averages are requiring people to go through their entire <br>
solution on a majority of the cases.  Excuse my bluntness, but your <br>
statement seems just a bit rude to me - have you ever considered that <br>
these people may just be better than you ever were?  They are <br>
definately better than I will ever be!<br>
<br>
Another consideration is that their cubes may be significantly better <br>
or even just better lubricated.  As one who used to lube with <br>
vaseline, I can say that silicone provides a much faster cube (not to <br>
mention a longer lasting lube).  Also, better cubes are available <br>
than those you can buy at your local Walmart or Target.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents.<br>

i don&#x27;t back gil&#x27;s remarks.
but maybe we shouldn&#x27;t chastise him and his family so quickly.
i think about some of the comments i get after a performance that 
contains some magic element...&quot;you know, it&#x27;s all done with 
lasers&quot;...&quot;how much did you have to pay that audience member to help 
you&quot;...things like that

obviously to anyone &quot;in the know&quot;, those explanations are ridiculous.
but to the people who say them, it&#x27;s just a reaction...a way of 
rationalizing something they can&#x27;t quickly explain...and no one likes 
to be &quot;fooled&quot;, so they just say the first theory that comes to mind. 
and without thinking any further, they accept that as the method.

so maybe that&#x27;s what happen with gil
maybe he wasn&#x27;t meaning to slam those of us who have worked many many 
hours to increase our skills by tossing out a theory that negates our 
efforts...maybe

and keep hostility out of this club or if you feel like ripping on

watches posts.  I also offer any of you to email me directly if you 
like to send criticism or need help understanding something.  But if 
this bashing continues people are going to be afraid to even post a

You obviosusly haven&#x27;t met anybody who is world-class then. I&#x27;ve seen 
the cube been solved under 20 seconds many, many times this week 
after lots of scrambling one of which was solved in 13.09 seconds.

Hi nineteen,

   I use the Deluxe model Rubik&#x27;s cube that was made in the early
1980&#x27;s by ideal. There is a deluxe model in Rubik&#x27;s Game as well. Both
of these have plastic tiles (the game model has peg holes in the
tiles) which don&#x27;t wear out or fall off. These are adjustable cubes,
which most of the newer cubes are not, a little bit heavier than
regular cubes and very durable. they rarely catch, or snag, and can be
looser than regular cubes without popping pieces out.

   Add a little bit of non-oil-based silicone lube and they are very
quick cubes.

   These come up fairly regularly on ebay.

   Some people have great success with Studio cubes from Hungary, but
I can&#x27;t vouch for them.

Hi there Jacob, and welcome to the club.  Now there are many many 
websites out there that can teach you to solve much faster.  First 
thing to do is choose a good speed method. There are three main ones:

Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s method: 
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html
Lars Petrus&#x27; method: http://www.lar5.com/cube/index.html
Corners First method: Email me for a detailed explanation at 
redkbrandon@...

There have been long debates on which is the best method.  The answer 
is that it is all personal preference.  If you learned doing corners 
first (either solving all corners first and then the edges, or 
solving the first layer, and then the opposite corners and then the 
rest of the edges,) then I would just expand that method to a good 
speed method.  (I solve corners first) On the other hand, if you 
learned a layer by layer method, I would suggest learning either 
Jessica&#x27;s method or Lars&#x27; method.

Good luck, and the best way to get fast is to practice.  I have spent 
countless hours doing this little cube, and still don&#x27;t get tired of 
it!

One last thing.  Go to www.Speedcubing.com it has so much info there, 
and a complete set of links.

Have fun,
-Kenneth

<br>
Congratulations on your achievement and welcome to the group.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d say what websites to hit depends partly on your current <br>
approach.  There are 3 main methods when it comes to speedcubing - <br>
corners first, Lars Petrus&#x27; method, and Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s method.  <br>
The Petrus and Fridrich methods are kind of modified layer-by-layer <br>
approaches in which the first two layers are done semi-<br>
simultaneously.  For more on each of these methods go to:<br>
<br>
Corners First - http://www.rubikscuberecord.com/<br>
Fridrich - http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html<br>
Petrus - http://www.lar5.com/cube/index.html<br>
<br>
For more/different algorithms (that may work better for you), check <br>
out:<br>
- http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/PetersCubePage.html<br>
- http://www.speedcubing.com/algorithms.html<br>
<br>
Peter&#x27;s page won&#x27;t really help you much if you are pursuing a corners <br>
first approach, but the second will.  I personally use the Fridrich <br>
system (or I&#x27;m working on it anyways).  Someone else may recommend a <br>
different site for corners first, or a variation on Petrus&#x27; method.<br>
<br>
One last recommendation - check out Dan Knights&#x27; page to get help on <br>
how to execute finger tricks. He&#x27;s also got some great general tips <br>
on speedcubing.  His site is <br>
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/CubeInfo.html .<br>

I don&#x27;t have the talent of Master Katsu, but I&#x27;ll try to record a

Maybe other people can do it too? (with good compression, 10 megabytes
should be enough)

you can always achieve these times?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello, Chris.  I&#x27;m Steve and new to the group.  About 20 years ago - during the craze - I was cubing on automatic and was around 20-25 seconds.  But that was before age set in and I haven&#x27;t been playing with the cube in 20 years.  Would it be too much to ask for your algs that you use for automatic cubing so I can get &quot;back in the grove?&quot; Best regards, Steve Forrest

again to have someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing reply to it. But <br>
from what I do know is that it helps to know the algorythems <br>
visaually. This has helped me a lot. For instance the easiest one to <br>
translate was the orientation which has a 2x2 cube oriented correcty. <br>
(L&#x27; B2 R B R&#x27; B L) You need to see it happening instead of looking <br>
away or at the piece of paper. This way you can see 2 bottom face <br>
pieces rotate around the cube untill you finally reposition it. Well <br>
I hope this helps, it&#x27;s just my opinion, personally I&#x27;m only half way <br>
through memorization of all 55. <br>

Heres what to do...

Say we have the alg- L D&#x27; B L&#x27; D2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; D2 L2 B&#x27; L&#x27; D L&#x27;

If you want to reflect it to use R&#x27;s rather than L&#x27;s then heres what 
I do.

you&#x27;ll need to change all the L moves to the opposite side, and they 
turn the opposite way too.  So L becomes R&#x27; and L&#x27; becomes R, L2 
turns into R2.  Moves like U, B, F, D still turn the same face after 
reflected, only they go the opposite way.  So U would be U&#x27; and so 
on, and also a move like U2 would still be U2

So That alg above reflected would be:

R&#x27; D B&#x27; R D2 L&#x27; F L D2 L2 B R D&#x27; R


Play around with that and you will be able to reflect any alg which 
ever way you want to.  

Hope this helps...

These things aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive though. At school, I loved 
math, science and cubes, but I was also interested in clothes, hair, 
socialising, etc.

That&#x27;s fantastic! I&#x27;ll have to keep this one in mind.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, the 3x3x3 is the classic! I think my next favourite would be 
the 4x4x4, followed closely by the 5x5x5. Actually, it depends what 
I&#x27;m in the mood for. If I&#x27;m in the mood for a puzzle that is going to 
take me a while to solve, then I&#x27;d definitely grab the 5x5x5. I&#x27;ve 
worked on this one enough to be able to solve it, but it still takes 
me ages.

I can say that I definitely prefer cubic puzzles. I&#x27;ve got a few non-
cubic puzzles, like the megaminx and impossiball, but I just don&#x27;t 
get into these as much. In fact, I&#x27;ve hardly touched my megaminx 
since I bought it late last year.

          <div class="email-content">Everyone else has commented on this so I decided I wanted to throw in 
my thoughts too.

When I first joined this group, I was surprised at the amazing times 
people posted. The best I had ever done was around 40s, but usually 
my times were around a minute or more. I had never ever actually met 
anyone who could do it faster than a minute, so obviously I thought I 
was pretty good. It was quite humbling to discover that as far as the 
cubing community goes, I&#x27;m actually not good at all! So I can 
understand that you may find some of these times surprising. One 
reaction to this might be to simply dismiss them as not true. My 
reaction, on the other hand, was to think that there must be a whole 
lot of algorithms and tricks that these people know that I don&#x27;t (I 
quickly discovered that this was very true!). It just made me realise 
that there&#x27;s a lot I don&#x27;t know and a lot I can learn from other 
cubers.

Something else I can say about this group is that people are very 
helpful and supportive. They never make new or less experienced 
cubers feel bad or stupid. On the contrary, people are always very 
keen to offer helpful tips and algorithms, and to congratulate others 
when they achieve new target times. I think this is great.

different cubes at one time its hard to actually say which is my <br>

          <div class="email-content">I remember getting my very first cube when i was 12.  I didn&#x27;t really 
dive into it untill i was about 15, when i first solved it.  I 
thought it was cool that i was the only person i ever knew who could 
solve the cube.  I didn&#x27;t get into speedcubing untill i taught some 
of my friends, and we kind of grew along the same path, improving our 
times and teaching more people.  I am 19 now and with my 4 years of 
cubing only about 1-2 years have been focused on speed and gradual 
learining of the F2l and the 2 look.  I&#x27;m almost there hovering over 
the 30sec makr, and i&#x27;m hoping once i get this 2 look mastered i will 
be down in the 20s for sure.

   That&#x27;s excellent Ross. Congratulations.

   And Congratulations to Lars too. Impressive.

   I&#x27;ve a question for everyone. What is the time that you can always
break (ignore pops)? And how far off this is your best average of 10
(12) and your best?

   When I joined the group in December my answers were:
   always = 1:35
   best average = 1:20
   best = 55 seconds

   now: 
   always = 48 seconds (some days 45)
   best average (s) = about 37
   best 29.5

   I&#x27;ve had faster ones, but they were fairly lucky.

Hi Heath,

Cool way to do a reflection.
In your reflection: > R&#x27; D B&#x27; R D2 L&#x27; F L D2 L2 B R D&#x27; R
you forgot to flip the last L2 to R2
It should be R&#x27; D B&#x27; R D2 L&#x27; F L D2 R2 B R D&#x27; R

Another way to reflect  
L D&#x27; B L&#x27; D2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; D2 L2 B&#x27; L&#x27; D L&#x27; turns up: 
L&#x27; D F&#x27; L D2 R&#x27; B R D2 L2 F L D&#x27; L

Everything turns the other way and F and B switch.

Thanks,

David J

          <div class="email-content">I would say that I was 7-10 when I first saw the Rubik&#x27;s cube (back in 91). I was able to solve a face, but at my age I was not aware that I had actually accomplished nothing. I am 18 now... and this is when I guess you could say I actually got interested in it. I can even do more than one face! Six faces to be more exact :)<br>

I think that the first two corner-edge pairs takes me slightly 
longer than the last two, with the very last pair being the fastest.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone. I&#x27;m just starting to learn the F2L methods, half way <br>
through memorization of the orientations and premutations of the last <br>
layer. I can never make up mind of the F2L, Jessica&#x27;s method or Lars&#x27; <br>
method. As of now I&#x27;m using a combination proposed by Chris Hardwick. <br>
Create a 2x2 section, then bottom edges, and continue to the Fridrich <br>
method. (BTW thanks Chris (along with Jessica and Lars for the <br>
original methods)) Well anyway, when I try to learn how do efficently <br>
pair up 2 pieces and then place those 2 in place (kinda redundent <br>
ain&#x27;t it?) all I really get is a familiar voice in my head: &quot;huh&quot;. I <br>
was wondering if there was a more &quot;English&quot; way of putting this <br>

  I wasn&#x27;t sure at first Heath, but I went thru and my
F2L looks like this(i threw my LL in there too if that
helps:

cross:       2-4  seconds 
1st pair:    4-5  seconds
2nd pair:    4-5  seconds 
3rd pair:    3-4  seconds
4th pair:    2-3  seconds
*F2L total: 15-21 seconds  
LL:         13-15 seconds
TOTAL:      28-36 seconds
*it usually falls in the middle area...around 18
seconds total (F2L).  but there are the extremes.  I
think the sub-20 ppl out there aren&#x27;t spending more
than 12 seconds total on F2L*

yeah...it&#x27;s kind of dumb they way the edit options are set-up...it 
can be the table creator, the group owner, or any member...but if 
it&#x27;s any member, any member can edit any listing, not just their own. 
which could lead to some problems. so if u want any changes, feel

just wondering how far you&#x27;ve got with the 2 in one hand and a cube 
in the other...i&#x27;ve done that a few times, but never on a uni. i 
found that alone a hard enough task. what pattern do u use for the 2 
balls? i use clockwise in my right, even tho i&#x27;m better doing the 
cube in my right, i&#x27;m much better with the 2 in my right and the cube 
in my left.

          <div class="email-content">Juggling + cubing is hard. I can almost always do two layers now. 
The hardest part is that I need to be able to juggle two balls 
without looking at them, which I&#x27;m bad at. I juggle two balls in my 
left hand in a counter clockwise pattern.

That said, if you don&#x27;t want to take the time to get used the <br>
oinkleburger applet, I would highly recommend getting the Rubiks <br>

Thanks for writing back.   How was your Siamese Cube connected?  If it was <br>
assembled the same as it basicly, I would certainly welcome some solutions or <br>
solving methods on it.  I think it would still be important to display it <br>
here on the site.<br>

Done. I uploaded the video:

A good start, but 12 cubes in a row is a bit too much.

Lars, Chris, Frédérick and the other sunday cubers, have you got a

The two letters in the left column correspond with the corner <br>

correspond with the corner at UBR, UFR and FUR.<br>
I learned that UFL stands for up-front-left, as in the corner. So <br>

          <div class="email-content">SInce your + are middle edge pieces, you can perform normal 3x3 algs 
to move them and orientate them. 
YOur  _  is a different story.  There are a couple of ways of going 
aabout it.  I once knew an alg that switches 2 opposite edge pieces 
but i forgot it after learning the centers first method.  Since all 
your centers are together your gonna want to put you_ on opposite 
sides so it looks like this

*****
*****
*****
_***_
*****

Hold this on the F face and perform this move:  d R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F d&#x27; (d 
is the 2nd row from the bottom)
THis will mess up your cube, but from that point you can solve it as 
a normal 3x3.  Check out Chris&#x27;s solution on speedcubing.com, 
Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hi James,<br>
<br>
Yes, the four letter system is a little hard at first, but in the end it will be<br>
very fast to see what to do next.<br>
<br>
UFL and FUL are referring to the same corner, but not to the same sticker. UFL<br>
means the U sticker of the UFL corner. FUL means the F sticker of the UFL<br>
corner.<br>
<br>
If you have the cube tilted so that you only see the U and F face, then you can<br>
see 6 stickers of U layer corners. On the left you have UBL, UFL and FUL. On the<br>
right you have UBR, UFR, FUR.<br>
<br>
For almost all cases there are exactly two stickers of each column that do not<br>
have the U layer color. In the case at the top left these stickers are: UBL,<br>
FUL, UBR, FUR. UFL and UFR have the U layer color. Let&#x27;s take the 4th situation<br>
of the upper left case at<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_corners_no_edge_flips.html<br>
<br>
It says:<br>
 FL<br>
 FR<br>
And the algorithm is BLF&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;LFL&#x27;.<br>
Now do the inverse of that algorithm from a solved cube.  So do LF&#x27;L&#x27;BLFL&#x27;B&#x27;.<br>
Check the stickers at UBL and FUL. They are the same. Therefore that color<br>
becomes the F color, so we have F and F on the left.<br>
Now check the stickers at UBR and FUR. They have opposite colors. These colors<br>
are not the opposite of F (B), so they are L and R.<br>
<br>
Try to do the inverses of some more algorithms and check the corresponding four<br>
letters. You will then understand what the four letters mean and which stickers<br>
to look for.<br>
I always end with yellow on top, so I just look for other than yellow stickers.<br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>

Maybe I can do more than 5, but I certainly won&#x27;t be able to stay<br>
cubing under water for more than 4 minutes.<br>
How many could you solve in 4 minutes?  7 or 8?<br>
<br>
Before starting, I had a 15-second inspection time that allowed me to<br>
see the beginning of the 2 first cubes (I solved them in 2*30 secs I<br>

          <div class="email-content">I completly forgot to dig my conectors back out this weekend when i <br>
was home but anyway the solution is farely easy.  It takes some <br>
getting used to and you can pretty much solve it like any other cube, <br>
you just have to take into consideration the bandaged corner edge <br>
group.  Here is how i would go about it:<br>
<br>
Step one: make cross<br>
step 2:  F2L,  Use the bandaged pair as a corner edge pair, that gets <br>
it out of the way for the most part<br>
Step 3: final layer:  I think most algs are able to be used but not <br>
all.  Sometimes you can use the alg just by turning the top out of <br>
the way so when you execute your turns, you can avoid the bandaged <br>
pair.  I highly recomend a 4 look on this guy because each step is <br>
pretty simple, and you can easily find out which moves to make that <br>
wont interfere with that pair.<br>
I hope this makes some sense, good luck!<br>

had to do every step.  You can find it on my section of

          <div class="email-content">Alright, I realize I may be a little late on my response, but here&#x27;s <br>
the moves needed to solve your situation, along with what each part <br>
of the long sequence does.  In the first part, move only the center <br>
slice for S and M moves.  Note that what you have here is the parity <br>
problem requiring that you swap just two outer edge pieces.  Also, <br>
note that I move UL and BL when I flip them, and them move them back -<br>
 I don&#x27;t have a sequence that just flips them in place.  Oh, yeah... <br>
One last note - small letters refer to just the slice, not the slice <br>
and the face (just a clarification, since some people do this the <br>
opposite way around).<br>
<br>
Flip &amp; Move UL and BU - L&#x27; B L S&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; L S<br>
Re-position UL and BU - B2 U M U2 M&#x27; U B2<br>
Swap URf and UFr (3 steps)<br>
1) Put UFr into URb - b L F&#x27; L&#x27; b&#x27;<br>
2) Swap URf and URb - f2 D2 R2 b R2 f&#x27; R2 f R2 U2 f U2 b&#x27; D2 f2 <br>
3) Put URb back into UFr - b L F L&#x27; b&#x27;<br>
<br>
So, to solve your situation (putting all the moves together), it&#x27;s <br>
(L&#x27; B L S&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; L S) (B2 U M U2 M&#x27; U B2) (b L F&#x27; L&#x27; b&#x27;) (f2 D2 R2 b <br>
R2 f&#x27; R2 f R2 U2 f U2 b&#x27; D2 f2) (b L F L&#x27; b&#x27;)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m relatively sure of my typing accuracy, but forgive me if I messed <br>
something up amidst the 40 moves listed ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, I was about 20 when I first saw a book on how to solve the <br>
cube.  Previously, I had thought it a puzzle only to be played with - <br>
not solved (unless you were much brighter than I, and somehow came up <br>
with your own solution, which is a concept that is still beyond me).  <br>
So, that&#x27;s when I started (I&#x27;m 26 now), but had I been given/come <br>
across the book earlier, I anticipate I would have started much <br>
earlier.<br>
<br>
That said, after months of working on it (maybe even a whole year), I <br>
was still averaging over 1:30.  I eventually lost interest for a <br>
while (maybe a year or two), because I didn&#x27;t see how I could really <br>
get any better (I couldn&#x27;t see doing all that memorization), and <br>
being that far from &quot;the good cubists&quot; I just lacked any motivation <br>
to go on.<br>
<br>
I just got back into it probably about 2 years ago, and still didn&#x27;t <br>
improve much until I had a bit of local competition (got a coworker <br>
involved), finally pushing me under a minute.  Now, I&#x27;m still having <br>
trouble trying to crack that 30 second barrier, but I don&#x27;t think <br>
I&#x27;ll be dropping this obsession any time soon.<br>
<br>
Well, I&#x27;ve taken a simple question, yet again, and said too much :-P<br>

          <div class="email-content">Congrats man!  You know, your video is the first speedcubing video I ever saw, so you&#x27;re kinda responsible for my interest in cubing.  And therefor my grades falling, my girlfriend leaving, and my general disinterest in hygene.. ok, not really, but still, you&#x27;re the guy, and I&#x27;m glad to see that even someone as talented as you can still improve.  I&#x27;m working toward my first sub-30 average, been at the cube for a year now.  Best average I&#x27;ve logged was 32.58 seconds so far, best time is 23.08, so I&#x27;m working on sub-30 average and sub-20 time :)

Congrats man.  And btw, the hair rocks.

Sweet!!!! Im Glad you finally did it Chris.

it seems like everyone is improving lately.  Thats awesome!   I 
really need to get motivated to learn algs again, and then work on 
the F2L.  I guess i need someone to keep telling me to work on them. 
haha..im still improving though, eventhough theres about 7 algs for 
the LL i need to re-learn..

congrats again Chris, keep up the hard work..

hopefully you added a place that can save all the times, show the

          <div class="email-content">in 4 minutes, I could solve 8, but of course that would mean going at 
full speed, and the more you rush, the shorter time you can hold your 
breath for. It is imperative not to panic, no matter what the 
situation, you must remember that you can take air immediately if you 
need to, so just really relax and push yourself to solve the next 
cube. It&#x27;s all about relaxation and minimal movement!

<br>
t = m_a/m_s + r*m_l<br>
<br>
Allow me to explain this.<br>
t is a function that returns the times you should expect when cubing.<br>
m_a is the number of average moves you do that are part of your repitwar (how<br>
 exactly do you spell this?!?). That is... moves you do all the time and can do<br>
 without looking.<br>
m_s is the number of moves per second you perform, on average, for the moves<br>
 that is described by m_a.<br>
r is the interesting variable. It is your average reaction time. If you are<br>
 unsure, visit www.brainconnection.com, click on the brain teasers tab, and find<br>
 one of the two games that test your reaction time. I like the dunk tank :-P<br>
m_l is the number of moves you do that are not part of your repitwar. For the<br>
 experienced cubist (unlike myself), this number may be zero if not close to it.<br>
 For the purpose of correct units for t, consider this number to be unit-less.<br>
<br>
I have tried this with my times and I get remarkably close to my actual average<br>
 (I was off by only one tenth of a second!). I am not sure how it will work with<br>
 others, but that is why I am posting it. If this DOES work, I would say that<br>
 anyone that goes 10% below this time (or some other range.. I am picking a<br>

Wat I would really like is<br>
a. the applet from werner randelshofer (http://www.randelshofer.ch) <br>
to be on the page, with a text box where I can paste a sequence.<br>
b. some other controls to the cube applet<br>
<br>
I am working on something myself, by lack of a really good timer page <br>
(sorry Jess, your&#x27;s IS great!).<br>
<br>
see http://utopia.knoware.nl/users/blonkm/cube.htm<br>
The cube on the page has a little bug in the perform action, but I <br>
have just to post it.<br>
<br>
The applet helps me to find out if I did turn every move correctly.<br>
<br>
BTW: all you have to do is change the sequence shown to a text box, <br>
so I can edit it.<br>

If it is made by Rubik,
PUSH REAL HARD!!!

btw I would make sure that all the pie pieces are in right, cuz if 
not your 2x2x2 will not function correctly.

While we are on this subject, my Esthen(spelling?) 2x2x2 broke and my 
brother put the broken cap back on, and now I can&#x27;t put the last 
piece in do I have to pry the cap back off?  I don&#x27;t know really how 
to go about it.  Any help is much appreciated!

Thanks, 
-Kenneth

P.S.  Anyone else on Academic Probation because of their RUBIK&#x27;s CUBE?

          <div class="email-content">Right,

I also cube in public. I still feel a little awkward cause I&#x27;m used 
to thinking that people think I&#x27;m weird. I notice that they&#x27;re 
absolutely not. Don&#x27;t be ashamed of a talent. Everybody should be 
proud to have such a stamina and determination at a goal.

I usually sit in front of the hotel near my work, where lots of 
tourists find it an interestig site seeing :-)

          <div class="email-content">I just got back from hanging out with some friends and cubing in 
public.  The friends I was with have known me for a while so I am 
comfortable cubing around them.  We went to a coffee shop and I cubed 
while my friends played chess with each other.  Anyway, it was 
weird.  I must not be the type of person to draw attention because no 
one in the coffee shop commented on my cubing.  I was a little 
nervous at first, wondering whether people were staring or whatever.  
But I noticed after doing it a few times that everyone seemed to be 
occupied with whatever it was they were doing so I just relaxed.  I 
timed myself near the end and I was getting some really good times!  
I got a 17, lots of 18&#x27;s and 19&#x27;s and only a few times above 20 
seconds.  I think the nervousness of wondering whether people were 
looking at me or not helped me to go faster, even though I was trying 
to relax.  Anyway I must not put on much of a performance when I 
cube, because no one seemed to notice, so I guess the public 
nervousness thing is all in my head :)

Do most of you guys try to get the attention of others around you, or 
do you just cube?  I guess I came across as the hard to approach type 
of person and nobody wanted to comment, or maybe no one really 
noticed.  Anyway I thought it was curious, but still a lot of fun.

solving Rubiks Cubes... LOL :)
I also love to cube in public. I did it once in an airport, and there 
were two people staring at me, whispering to each other, thinking I 
couldn&#x27;t see them. LOL

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,When you cube in public, and you actually solve it, what do you do to make sure that people could see you could solve it?  I mean, they could look, and see me just turning like crazy- but when i solve it, what, am i gonna wave it around and said &#x27;wow, pretty easy nonsense&#x27;?  Like Chris in the coffee shop, when you solved it, how did you make sure that people could see it was solved?by the way, when i time myself, or get bored, i sometimes &#x27;pretend&#x27; im on stage at wc2003, and EVERYTIME i get like 25 or something.  it&#x27;s crazy- i guess it&#x27;s ALL in your head.Brent

public.  The friends I was with have known me for a while so I am 
comfortable cubing around them.  We went to a coffee shop and I cubed 
while my friends played chess with each other.  Anyway, it was 
weird.  I must not be the type of person to draw attention because no 
one in the coffee shop commented on my cubing.  I was a little 
nervous at first, wondering whether people were staring or whatever.  
But I noticed after doing it a few times that everyone seemed to be 
occupied with whatever it was they were doing so I just relaxed.  I 
timed myself near the end and I was getting some really good times!  
I got a 17, lots of 18&#x27;s and 19&#x27;s and only a few times above 20 
seconds.  I think the nervousness of wondering whether people were 
looking at me or not helped me to go faster, even though I was trying 
to relax.  Anyway I must not put on much of a performance when I 
cube, because no one seemed to notice, so I guess the public 
nervousness thing is all in my head :)

Do most of you guys try to get the attention of others around you, or 
do you just cube?  I guess I came across as the hard to approach type 
of person and nobody wanted to comment, or maybe no one really 
noticed.  Anyway I thought it was curious, but still a lot of fun.

It is, however, the smoothest cube I&#x27;ve ever felt(once I got the screws tuned). Last night, the night after I got it tuned and had it going decently fast, I broke my record by nearly three seconds. I imagine a good portion of that is my actual improvement, but part of it is that I got no catches. My point is, it is a very nice cube for the price(18.00 including shipping). Adam Sherwood<br>

distinguishes them from ordinary cubes? I presume studio  cubes are <br>
more expensive, so they ought to be better, that means more durable <br>

<br>
You  speedcubing guys are lucky. You need to own one such cube. Cube <br>
artists, particularly multi-cube ones, would like to have as many <br>
good cubes as there are cubes they have. In my caae, that means 450 <br>
cubes. Multiply this by 18 dollars/cube and the number you get is <br>
awesome. :-( So I just juggle the cubes I have.<br>

it only cost me 18.00 and it is by far the most awesome cube I&#x27;ve yet to
own. It is not as fast as my Oddzone yet. It is, however, the smoothest cube
I&#x27;ve ever felt(once I got the screws tuned). Last night, the night after I
got it tuned and had it going decently fast, I broke my record by nearly
three seconds. I imagine a good portion of that is my actual improvement,
but part of it is that I got no catches. My point is, it is a very nice cube
for the price(18.00 including shipping). Adam Sherwood

          <div class="email-content">Chris, oh my goodness what an amazing coincidence! I was just about 
to write a post (before I saw yours below) and turns out that the 
first paragraph would have been almost identical!! This evening I was 
also at a coffee shop with friends. They were playing chess and I was 
cubing. No one really paid much attention to us either. I imagine we 
must have looked like a table of geeks though. ;)

Something like that anyway. Check out Ton&#x27;s section on<br>
www.speedcubing.com. By the way, if you by them in<br>
mass quantities, the price lowers since the shipping<br>
is less.<br>
<br>
Still, 450 is a lot.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys,

   Yesterday I rode two buses that I took two months ago. At that time
the best I could do was 46 seconds. Yesterday I did a 33.7 and a 32.8
so I guess I am improving.

   I got all kinds of good reactions. People noticed when the cube was
solved, and it started conversations. I noticed that some people,
especially children, really like it, and I saw people timing me. One
fellow thought that it was trick, that no one could really solve it
like that, but I had someone else mix it. When I solved it (about 42)
he apologised!

          <div class="email-content">Something that I occasionally do when cubing in front of others is 
announce the number of turns I have left of the solution when I&#x27;m 
down to the final LL alg. This seems to impress.

I haven&#x27;t memorised many LL algs (I use a several look LL) but the 
ones I have memorised I&#x27;ve also counted the moves.

          <div class="email-content">Yep. I just checked a few Australia Govt websites (Dept of Foreign 
Affairs and Dept of Health) and saw that they &quot;strongly recommends 
that Australians consider deferring non-essential travel to Toronto&quot; 
due to SARS.

I was just hoping that this sorts itself out before the Championship. 
Not that I&#x27;m competing, I just didn&#x27;t want it to mess things up for 
all you guys.

I&#x27;ve been thinking about moves alot lately and I&#x27;ve been wondering. <br>
You people who have been solving for the past 20 years using the same <br>
method seem, in my perspective at least, do it over and over again <br>
without change. I would think that after awhile you would sub-<br>
conciously be learning more complex algorythems for moves. For <br>
example, if you use Jessica&#x27;s method and you&#x27;re on the step that <br>
pairs up and places the rest of the bottom pieces, you see a pattern <br>
such as 4 pieces out of place and in one algorythem place them all 4 <br>
simotaniously. In more simpilar terms, shortcuts. From my perspective <br>
there can be shortcuts cutting esentially 30+ moves off. Lets just <br>
say for arguments sake that 40 years from now I&#x27;m seated in my <br>
rocking chair with my rubiks cube that I have throughally mastered. <br>

at 4 moves a second that gets you comfortabally under a magical 10 <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmm...  That&#x27;s a kinda fun idea, but I don&#x27;t think it stands up to <br>
the math.<br>
<br>
According to Jessica&#x27;s site, the cross takes 7 moves (if done <br>
properly), OLL takes 9 moves, and PLL takes 12 moves (on average).  <br>
So, in all, you get 7 + 9 + 12 = 28 moves.  This ignores solving the <br>
rest of the F2L.  In order to do that in an average of 7 moves (if <br>
that&#x27;s even possible), you would have to know all possible <br>
combinations to place all four pairs in one sequence.<br>
<br>
For argument&#x27;s sake, let&#x27;s say that you could combine placement of <br>
corner edge pairs together, and instead of averaging 7 moves per pair <br>
(as indicated on her site as the average), you could do two pairs in <br>
that time - that would land you at 7 (cross) + 14 (F2L) + 9 (OLL) + <br>
12 (PLL) = 42 moves on average.  Even at 4 moves per second, you&#x27;re <br>
still not quite hitting 10 seconds, aside from &quot;easier than average&quot; <br>
cases.  Besides - that would be an aweful lot of cases <br>
to &quot;understand&quot; for the F2L.<br>

Will actually &#x27;cancelling&#x27; the wc2003 at Toronto be a possiblity because of this &#x27;S.A.R.S.&#x27; chaos?  Is it a considerable thought, or will we be entering on our own risk to meet death?  (hm...)<br>

hey all.
here are some of the latest figures on SARS.

in all of canada: 324 probable cases - with a population of appx. 
31.5 million people

in ontario: 136 probable, and 125 suspect (total is 261; 129 of those 
have now been released from hospital) - ontario population is appx. 
12 million

number of cases actually in toronto: i&#x27;m not sure, but probably a 
high percentage of the ontario cases - toronto population appx. 5 
million

Okay, maybe that wasn&#x27;t funny, but man, i got a letter from my school 
warning about S.A.R.S and dorm life.  This thing seems very easy to 
spread, so lets all hope that this thing ends by august!  I&#x27;d rather 
be a slow cuber, than a dead one!  (maybe thats a little funnier)

<br>
I am only going to say this 1 time and 1 time only.<br>
<br>
First off, If anyone has issues surrounding the WC2003 event, you are <br>
to bring forth your comments to wc2003 org team NOT THIS FORUM!!!!<br>
<br>
I dont read this forum like you all think I do.<br>
<br>
With that said, I have noticed some rediculous statements on this <br>
site pertaining the the SARS issue here in Toronto. Yes I live in <br>
Toronto and I have to say the entire city of outraged at the World <br>
Health Organization statements pertaining to SARS and this city.<br>
<br>
There is no warrant of their comments nor does any of your <br>
governments have anything other than media reports when they based <br>
their advisory decisions.<br>
<br>
The SARS problem originated from south east asia and i will not <br>
disclose the country.<br>
<br>
There is no epidemic, its only an isolated issue with 12 hospital <br>
here in the greater toronto area 25 miles from the central core of <br>
the city and miles away from the venue.<br>
<br>
Competitors will miles aware from the actual area. This has been <br>
contained and their is no need for anyone to cancel their plans for <br>
this event. <br>
<br>
The organization team is appauled of this issue and are advising all <br>
competitors to continue with their plans.<br>
<br>
The city is safe and what you have read in the media is insulting and <br>
not correct.<br>
<br>
I look forward to seeing ALL of you here in the summer time.<br>

In order get around a 30 turn solution, i think the corners first <br>
method has less turns per solve then f2l. The reason most f2l solvers <br>
are faster is because of the fast recognition and limiting to face <br>
turns, which are much faster than slices.  Thats how i&#x27;m seeing it at <br>

I suggest we wait till August. In the best case it will blow over and

dan, i don&#x27;t think you need to be mad at the questions people are 
asking on this forum (or for asking them on THIS forum...i would have 
thought you would be a regular reader of this forum, considering it&#x27;s 
topic and relevance to your current undertaking).

people are only asking these questions in response to the images they 
are being presented with by the media...which pretty much always show 
masses of torontonians or canadians running around with masks, gowns, 
and goggles on. of course, you and i and most other people in the 
toronto area know there aren&#x27;t any wheelbarrows of victims being 
dumped in the streets, but that&#x27;s because we&#x27;re here. 

if you want to be angry at anyone, express that anger to the media, 
for being a manipulative control mechanism, rather than a tool to 
properly inform people. 

i&#x27;d rather people ask, and give us the opportunity to calmly answer 
them, rather than just not show up out of fear and ignorance.

i&#x27;m sure this is a stressful time for you. so once again, thank you 
for all the working you are doing for us in the cubing community.

I am not mad at anything. i am however concerns when someone asks me 
a question on this forum when i dont view this forum all that often.

As to my involvement in this forum, since i am the chief organizor i 
have had to excuse myself from this forum.

I cant be a competitor AND an organizor at the same time.

The question was directed to myself on this foroum and the question 
pertained to the wc2003 event.

The question should have been directed to the wc2003@... 
address and not this forum.

I have also indicated my involvement in this forum many months ago 
therefore you would have know what my involvement is with this forrum 
if you had of read all the messages in the database.....


Currently i am searching for a way to clam everyone...

With yourself being an active member of this forum could you possible 
assist(since your basically a local to Toronto) us in the calming of 
everyone.....

in return...free cubes from myself..

          <div class="email-content">ok, now that i have calmed down a bit after recieving over 100 <br>
hundred emails regarding sars here is some more info:<br>
<br>
Our first and foremost concern is everyones health and safety. With <br>
that said, if anything came up which required you all to be concerned <br>
about, then I will be the one who sends out an email to all <br>
competitors.<br>
<br>
The country where sars originated from is hosting an upcoming Summer <br>
Olympics. This country is also under World Heath &quot;Advisory&quot; however <br>
we dont see the olympics being cancelled.<br>
<br>
What i am trying to say here folks is that you should not take <br>
everything you see,read in the media to heart.<br>
<br>
Of course the championship organizors will advise, but we have <br>
nothing to advise you on...<br>
<br>
The city is perfectly safe. The problem was an isolated issue at one <br>
of the area hospitals(which by the way is not even in the city of <br>
Toronto). The hospital is in the city next door in the greater <br>
Toronto area.<br>
<br>
Toronto has a population of 4.5 million including suburbs. Our event <br>
is being held at the opposite side of the city which is 40 miles from <br>
1 end to the other approx.<br>
<br>
Yes there have been deaths as a result of sars but all deaths had <br>
other outlining problems which factored into the deaths. <br>
<br>
I/The mayor of City, along with all city officials indicate to myself<br>
(as I have made the calls) that the city is perfectly safe to hold <br>
our event.<br>
<br>
The city officials are now in Brussels or Belguim(where ever the <br>
World Heath Org is located) to have the advisory reversed as it was <br>
certainely unwarranted.<br>
<br>
We even have the American Centre for Disease control up here and they <br>
have also indicated the city is perfectly safe and have said the <br>
decisions from WHO are also false and unwarranted.....<br>
<br>
<br>
I trust everyone will make their own decisions and i look  forward to <br>
seeing all of you.....in the summer time when this sars things is all <br>
blown over...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Perhaps this is just me but I don&#x27;t understand how being the chief organizor has anything to do with your involvment in this forum.  Is there some kind of rule that says the chief organizer is prohibited from reading and posting messages in the speedsolvingrubikscube forum.  Because if so, that really sucks for you because you&#x27;ve already broken that rule several times, so you might as well keep doing it now.

          <div class="email-content">Hmmm well interesting idea. I used to use the corners first method 
but I dropped that for that very same reason- it took too many moves. 
I still currently use it for cubing in public untill I finnish 
learning the Orientations and Premutations of the Last layer. If you 
have some other thoughts on how to get a small number of moves using 
the corners first method let me know. I could never get under 65. The 
placing of the top and bottom edges seemed to take to long.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
Here is a puzzle. I found it by coincidence.<br>
<br>
Find an algorithm that from a solved cube:<br>
<br>
= gives back a solved cube after executing it twice<br>
<br>
AND<br>
<br>
= gives back a solved cube after adding the move U at the end of the <br>
algorithm and executing that new algorithm three times<br>
<br>
<br>
I think this is rather interesting because 3 U moves do not strike <br>
out each other.<br>
There are actually many solutions to this puzzles.<br>

Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">One of the normal perms for the Fridrich method works,

B2 L U L&#x27; B2 R D&#x27; R D R2 solves the cube if you do it twice and 
(B2 L U L&#x27; B2 R D&#x27; R D R2) (U) does indeed solve the cube if you do 
it three times.

This is cool, I want to see if there are more.  Perhaps someone can 
come up with a generalized alg with all the necessary properties.  
Perhaps Richard or another math person who knows group theory?

its called &quot;conflict of interest&quot;

i had to seperate myself from this forum for the above reason...i 
only check the forum once in a while to see how the gang is doing 
and to get feedback on issues surrounding our event...if i see 
issues i look for resolvement, then take that issue and make a 
ruling from what i read in the posts....


you see i am doing this all for the cubists out there ie yourself

If Guiness were to watch everything, they could very well say the 
organizor had something to do with the results of the event thus 
cancelling any records being set at the event.....

see where i am coming from.....


have a good one...

I see your problem. You cannot get aRubik&#x27;s cube in Ankarsa/Turkey. 
Not so long ago you couyldn&#x27;t find a Rubik&#x27;s cube in

You need to go online. Iam told Owe Meffert sells good cubes. Go to

          <div class="email-content">Thank you! I continued finding my average after that. I did a total of 18 solves, then I got tired of solving the cube :) My fastest time after that was 45.8 (no steps skipped). The average of the 18 solves is 59.16 without the fastest and slowest times. I will still consider 1:02.02 to be my average.<br>
<br>
I read that if I give cubing a one day or two day break that my times will improve simply because my subconscious has time to process the information. How true is that? I do not need to try experimenting with it if it will not help (might as well cube hard!).<br>

          <div class="email-content">I remember that when I first joined this group, my times were around 
1:30. Now I can do it in 30 seconds! You&#x27;ll get better quickly.
I don&#x27;t know if taking a break from cubing helps, but take a break 
from timing. If you don&#x27;t time yourself for a week, but continue 
practicing fast, then you do it again timing yourself, it&#x27;ll be 
reeaally fast times, often setting a new record.

Sometimes taking a few days break from cubing works for me.  I dont 
think it has anything to do with the subconscious though, maybe 
gives the hands/wrists some time to relax.  I wouldnt take a couple 
days off if your improving right now.  The only time I do it is when 
my times start to go up.

&quot;This thing seems very easy to spread&quot; is about the same as saying
&quot;Airplanes are dangerous because of all the terrorism&quot;. Four unfortunate
incidents on one September day two years ago and people are scared. How many
airplanes fly across the skies each day? People die crossing the street,
riding a bus, taking a train.

Anyways I&#x27;m sorry to ramble but I am sickened by all these emails by people
who really don&#x27;t really know about SARS except what they read in the papers.

Ironically I don&#x27;t think I can make it to the championships, and the only
reason for this is that my cousin is getting married in November and I can
only take my holidays then. And if you must know, my cousin lives in
Toronto. I tried convincing him to move his wedding three months earlier but
he couldn&#x27;t despite my pleading.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
    Just curious as to how everyone has started preparing for the event.  I&#x27;m learning some new algorithms and will soon take the paint off my cube and put some new stickers.  If I can learn the 50 or so algorithms I have left to learn within the month, I might very well try to compete.<br>
    But how is everyone preparing for the timing method?  Because the method I use, with the Ultimate Rubik&#x27;s cube (r) timer Version 2.1 is as follows:<br>
1. Scramble the cube according to the algorithm.<br>
2. Press the space bar to start countdown for inspection time (I use 10 seconds).<br>
3. Examine the cube while holding it, without turning until I hear the final beep.<br>
4. Solve like a crazy mofo.<br>
5. Press the space bar to stop the timer.<br>
<br>
Seems pretty straight forward, but won&#x27;t this cause problems with the WC2003 protocol?  If I remember reading the rules correctly, the contestants will have 15 seconds to inspect, but them must set the cube down.  They wait for a few seconds, and time begins when they pick the cube up (presumably some sort of pressure sensing surface?).  The time stops when the cube is set down, solved.<br>
    So how are you guys preparing for that lag between inspection and solving, if you are currently unfamiliar with it?  Becuase I know that during my inspection time, I get my fingers all set up for my first move.  Also, I&#x27;ve paid special attention lately, and I may well be starting 2 or so 10ths of a second before the last beep, a bad habit I need to break.<br>
    Has anyone constructed a timing platform similar to what will be used at WC2003?  If so, how?  Then again, am I just making up the whole timing method thing?  Hehehe, it&#x27;s late... or early.. or whatever.  Any advice is appreciated!<br>

I agree Lars.  Im sure that this SARS thing WILL be cleared up though.  Im sure if it were too dangerous chief Mr. Gosbee will let us know- but Im sure this SARS will be cleared by August, so my chances of going to the championships: looks good.  How bout everybody else?  I hear Jason Feng can&#x27;t make it.  Is everyone else making it there?  I hope so.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
    I did my first actual average of 12 solves for a 4x4x4 cube ever.  I&#x27;ve solved the cube several times, but always got too impatient to do the whole 12 in a row.  My average was 2:58.14 and my best time I have logged is 2:20.16.<br>
    I lose a lot of time when I fix the edges though, and I was looking for some advice.  My solution method is:<br>
1. Repair 4 center cubies of one color (say red).<br>
2. Repair 4 center cubies of opposite color (orange).<br>
3. Repair 4 center cubies of one of the remaining colors (say yellow).<br>
4. Repair 4 center cubies of the opposite color (white).<br>
5. Place 1 corner to check where the last two colors should be relative to the first four.<br>
6. Repair remaining 8 center cubies simultaneously.<br>
<br>
This is where it gets tough to describe:<br>
7. Repair all edges (except for possibly 2) in the following manner: (Reflections are not listed, but perfectly acceptable)<br>
    7a. Position an unsolved edge pair in the UF position.  As an example we shall say the UFl cubie is Blue/Yellow with yellow on F and the UFr cubie is yellow/orange with orange on F.<br>
    7b. Position an edge pair with at least one match to the first edge pair in the FL position such that the matching piece has the same color on F as the first edge pair piece.  Ex. uFL is Blue/yellow with yellow on F dFL is Whit/Green with Green on F<br>
    7c. Position the edge pair with the cubie matching the second cubie of the first pair in the FD position such that the matching cubie has the opposite color on F as the cubie in the first pair.  Ex. DFl is orange/yellow with yellow on F, DFr is yellow/green with green on F.<br>
    7d. Perform the following L&#x27;l&#x27;F&#x27;LFl  That will solve at least two edge pairs at a time.<br>
8. If at the end of repeating this sequence, there are only two unsolved edge pieces, do the following:<br>
    8a. Position one of the edge pairs in the FL position. Ex. uFL green/white with white on F, and dFL is yellow/red with red on F.<br>
    8b. Position the other piece in the FR position with the same colors as the first edge pair on F.  Ex. uFR is Green/white with white on F, and dFR is yellow/red with red on F.<br>
    8c. Perform UuFU&#x27;F&#x27;u&#x27;U2<br>
    8d. Solve via an F&#x27; rotaion of the entire cube, then step 7d.<br>
<br>
9. Solve as a standard 3x3x3 cube until LL.<br>
10. If one edge is flipped incorrectly, hold that edge in the UF position and perform r2B2U2lU2r&#x27;U2rU2F2rF2l&#x27;B2r2  (thank you Chris Hardwick)<br>
11. If after all else is solved, two edges have swapped places, perform r2U2r2u2U2r2u2 (Thank you again Chris Hardwick)<br>
<br>
Your cube is solved.  I&#x27;m not sure how similar this is to Chris&#x27;s solution, but this is the way I set about solving it the first night I got it.  I did have to look up the last two algorithms though, those situations were driving me insane.  Also it should be noted that in a different set up of step 7b will lead to a different algorithm in 7d, which would be L&#x27;rF&#x27;Lfr.  I will leave out the description of that for simplicity.  Also in step 8c, the first U is optional, but if omitted it chenges the last U2 to a U&#x27;.  I find it easier to turn both slices at once.<br>
    So, if you understood a single word of that solution, first off congratulations, second off rip it to shreds :).  Any pointers, especially on how to speed up the step 7-8 sequences.  I have problems locating the appropriate cubies in a hurry, and if there is a way to place more than two edges at a time, I&#x27;d like to know.<br>
    Any other suggestions are very very welcome.  And btw, how are those times?  not superb I&#x27;d imagine, but are they consistent with my solving a 3x3x3 in about 30-35 seconds on average?  Thanks all!<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Daniel<br>
<br>
PS, If anyone knows of a similar algorithm to the one in step 10 that is shorter, even if it changes messes up the rest of the 3x3x3 aspect of the cube, I&#x27;d like to know, for use in the 5x5x5 cube.<br>

Weddings are complicated affairs, planned well in advance. Maybe your 
cousin couldn&#x27;t chage his plans, even if he wanted to.

However, since you will be in Toronto, you can drop by and see the 
event. I will be exhibiting cube art. You can come and see me. :-)

Now, to the rest of you: have you considered the people, who live in 
Toronto? They cannot just get up and move because of S.A.R.S. They 
have to grin and bear it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
I was making some videos and when I looked back I thought my <br>
stickers were too ugly to post the videos.<br>
<br>
So since then I have been experimenting how to protect my stickers.<br>
First I tried transparent nail polish on top of the stickers. I used <br>
the little nail brush and applied three layers of polish. This makes <br>
your cube very beautiful and shiny. But the nail polish (at least <br>
the one I tried) isn&#x27;t strong enough. After a few days you begin to <br>
see some cracks and then it gets worse.<br>
<br>
The next thing I tried was transparent lacquer spray. You just spray <br>
from a foot distance and if necessary add some more layers. Lacquer <br>
spray doesn&#x27;t make your cube as shiny as nail polish, but it is much <br>
stronger. So this really works and after more than a week of <br>
speedcubing, I still do not see any cracks. Another good thing is <br>
that lacquer stays a little sticky, which gives great grip on the <br>
cube. You should try it.<br>
<br>
I am also going to try the glue that Gilles Roux proposed on his <br>
page http://grrroux.free.fr/me/me.html<br>
Gilles, are you still happy with the glue?<br>
<br>
Any other suggestions are very welcome.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>

http://www.speedcubing.com<br>
<br>
PS: ChrisH, beautiful solution to my little puzzle. I still think it <br>
is very interesting that it actually works.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have a puzzle that I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out, that I am now <br>
almost completely positive is impossible.  Do the move U on your <br>
cube.  Now, solve your cube using an even number of quarter turns.  <br>
Or you can also try to come up with an algorithm that scrambles and <br>
solves your cube in an odd number of algorithms (from a solved <br>
position).<br>
<br>
It is possible to do this if you count center slice turns as one <br>
quarter turn, namely just do E&#x27; D&#x27;, however I am fairly convinced <br>
that it is impossible if a center slice turn counts as turning the <br>
two outside faces once.<br>
<br>
So anyway I&#x27;m guessing this is just a property of the cube.  If this <br>
is true, then there seem to be these &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; states to the <br>
cube.  Does that mean that when you scrambled your cube it is in one <br>
of these two states and every time you do a quarter turn you switch <br>
to the other state?  Are there any states that are both even and odd, <br>
or is it impossible to have one that is both, hence it would be <br>
impossible to solve the above puzzle?<br>
<br>
Also if having these &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; states were true then it would <br>
be true that scrambling and returning the cube back to the solved <br>
state by repeating the same algorithm will always be done in an even <br>
number of quarter turns.<br>
<br>
I also noticed one other thing about the cube.  When you scramble and <br>
solve the cube simply by repeating the same algorithm from a solved <br>
state, the number of quarter turns seems to always be divisible by <br>
three, and I think the number of face turns as well.  It would also <br>
have to be an even number of turns, since you could consider <br>
repeating the alg n times as one alg that is n*(the number of moves <br>
in the original alg) moves long.<br>
<br>
Is this different for larger cubes?  For cubes in different <br>
dimensions?  Can the 4D cube be solved in a different number if you <br>
always repeat the same alg?  Does this &quot;even&quot; and &quot;oddness&quot; extend to <br>
other cubes and cubes in other dimensions?  Does group theory have <br>
the same properties in 4D, 5D, N dimensions?  LoL I guess you guys <br>
must be thinking &quot;wow, Hardwick is weird&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess this stuff is all explained rather simply using group theory, <br>
which I have not got around to trying to learn yet (laziness).  I was <br>
curious if anyone else has ever noticed this, or if there are other <br>
cool properties to the cube that people have noticed.  Also anyone <br>
let me know if I&#x27;ve said something that is blatantly false (like the <br>
stuff about the number of moves being divisible by 3).  It just seems <br>
that the number 3 comes up a lot there.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Oops..  For the repeating algorthm part in my previous message I 
forgot to mention that the number of quarter turns being divisible by 
3 only works when your alg includes two or more intersecting faces.  
Otherwise you could just do R 4 times and have an alg (R) that solves 
the cube in 4 turns.

<br>
I finally did it: a sub 17 seconds average. See <br>

It was hard work. Three years of practice. Thanks to many people for <br>

Soon I will use a laptop computer and time myself in hundredths of a <br>

HI Ron,

   I only found one so far, the one Chris posted, but I know a sort of
related sequence where 3 algorithms balance out. You probably already
know a version of this.

If you do r U r U r U r U

It flips over two edge cubies opposite each other on the Down side and
two adjacent cubies on the Up side. If you do it again they flip back
upright.

Now if you do r U r U r U r U

then rotate the cube QU QR&#x27;

do it again r U r U r U r U

rotate the cube again QU QR&#x27;

then do it again r U r U r U r U

then all twelve edge cubies are flipped over.


note: r = turn the center slice next to R 1/4 turn clockwise, like you
would turn the R side.
QR&#x27; = rotate the whole cube 1/4 turn counterclockwise like you would
turn the R side.

Stage 7 - pair up 3 edges at once, instead of 2. That should save you <br>
some time. Frequently you can do 3 edges, 3 edges, 2 edges and 2 <br>
edges and will be left either with 2 or none. Sometimes you can even <br>
get 4 edges at once. Occasionally, this strategy will not be possible <br>
to implement like this - generally in this situation a pair of edges <br>
will have each have one half of each of two edges (e.g. both have one <br>
half of the UF edge and both have one half of the FR edge) or <br>
possibly 3 edges will have similar problems (like UF-FR, FR-FL, FL-<br>
UF), but you should be able to get a minimum of 2 edges completed at <br>

sounds very interesting!

what do you mean &quot;Please use (x) (y) (z) R L F B U D r l f b u d &#x27; 
notation.&quot;

x y and z are cube rotations i take it, what are the lower case 
letters for? I want to make sure I do it right :)

  rather know nothing about the cube and be able to do it in 15 <br>
  seconds but while I&#x27;m working on it I think it will help.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone.  I just sat down today and wrote an extended cross <br>
solution page.  It uses those cool little interactive cubes and shows <br>
examples of different level solves (medium/easy to difficult).  I <br>
also show a good example of some strategy for how to get used to <br>
solving the extended cross (whether you start with the 2x2x2 or cross <br>
now).  Anyway this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used these cubes, so <br>
I&#x27;m wondering if the website works for everyone.  Also, assuming it <br>
works, I&#x27;d be interested in some feedback about the site.  If anyone <br>
is interested in the extended cross at all this page should help show <br>
pretty much exactly what I do.  I hope anyone who was interested in <br>
my idea likes this page, and others as well.  I&#x27;d be interested in <br>
any feedback you guys have (good or bad).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Heath!

yes you are right, x y z are whole cube rotations about their 
respective axes. the lower case letters indicate turns of two 
layers... so for example an r would mean the R slice AND the middle 
slice next to it turned clockwise TOGETHER. Another example, a u&#x27; 
would mean the U slice AND the middle slice below it, turned anti-
clockwise TOGETHER.

I hope this clears up any issues you have!

Best of Luck, 
DanH :)

I was attempting one-handed solves a few months ago. It was going 
okay, although rather slowly, until I got to the LL. I couldn&#x27;t get 
through the LL!! My brain knew the LL algs as a whole unit, including 
how the cube moves/feels in my hands. When I tried to do it with one 
hand, which obviously requires holding/moving the cube differently, I 
couldn&#x27;t retrieve the algs from my brain!! Bizarre!

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I have some extra teflon (1 micron thick sheet) lying arouns and was <br>
wonderings how well my cube would perform if I coated all the inside <br>
surfaces with it. It would be a lot of work but I thing the cube <br>
would turn very smoothly. The extra depth it adds to the cubies <br>
would also be nice because my cube is getting way too loose and <br>
pieces are popping left and right. Has anyone ever coated the inside <br>
of their cube with anything besides just lubing it? Any thoughts <br>
would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Also, I need some more algorithms for my corners first method. I <br>
base my method on Adam&#x27;s solution from -- <br>
http://www.ai.sri.com/~cheyer/rubiks/rubiks.html and average about <br>
1:10 but I&#x27;m getting faster every day! I would like the algorithms <br>
to solve all the center slice edges in one algorithm (I&#x27;m too lazy <br>
to figure it out myself) and any shortcuts to place the edges faster <br>
would be appreciated.<br>

The teflon idea sounds awesome. It may not make it<br>

smoother. Let us know how it goes if you do it.<br>

Glad to see another Corners-First solver!!!!  Sometimes I feel so <br>
lonely.  Just to let you and everyone else know Corners-First is just <br>
as fast as any-other method!!!!  Here are some tips (from quickly <br>
going over Adam&#x27;s method.) I solve the corners differently than you, <br>
and I am willing to bet that my way takes less moves on average.  The <br>
way I solve the corners is I solve 4 adjacent corners completely, <br>
using intuition, then I solve the opposite 4 using 1 alg of 42.  I <br>
used the algs found on www.speedcubing.com under corners first.  Now <br>
for placing edges, what you want is found on www.speedcubing.com as <br>
well.  It has all the algs to fill in the keyhole and orient the <br>
edges at the same time.  It will save you the last move you have to <br>
do to orient 2 or 4 edges.<br>
<br>
Hope I make sense,<br>

          <div class="email-content">I finally counted up all of my average moves in my repertoire and such and applied the formula.  It was indeed surprisingly accurate.  I got 32.5 seconds or so from the formula and i have been (as of late) getting times right around 31-34 seconds as averages.  that&#x27;s about a +- 5% deviation from your formula&#x27;s projected value.

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] &quot;Lucky&quot; ~ Formula<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  I derived a math formula the other day that may be used to help determine if a<br>
  time is &quot;lucky&quot; or not.<br>
<br>
  t = m_a/m_s + r*m_l<br>
<br>
  Allow me to explain this.<br>
  t is a function that returns the times you should expect when cubing.<br>
  m_a is the number of average moves you do that are part of your repitwar (how<br>
  exactly do you spell this?!?). That is... moves you do all the time and can do<br>
  without looking.<br>
  m_s is the number of moves per second you perform, on average, for the moves<br>
  that is described by m_a.<br>
  r is the interesting variable. It is your average reaction time. If you are<br>
  unsure, visit www.brainconnection.com, click on the brain teasers tab, and find<br>
  one of the two games that test your reaction time. I like the dunk tank :-P<br>
  m_l is the number of moves you do that are not part of your repitwar. For the<br>
  experienced cubist (unlike myself), this number may be zero if not close to it.<br>
  For the purpose of correct units for t, consider this number to be unit-less.<br>
<br>
  I have tried this with my times and I get remarkably close to my actual average<br>
  (I was off by only one tenth of a second!). I am not sure how it will work with<br>
  others, but that is why I am posting it. If this DOES work, I would say that<br>
  anyone that goes 10% below this time (or some other range.. I am picking a<br>
  number out of the air), the time is considered lucky. Same for unlucky cases.<br>

   Teflon should make the cube very quick. In fact you might be able

   One micron isn&#x27;t very thick how will you stick it to the plastic

          <div class="email-content">Hello. Thank you for giving it a try. That is one more confirmed case for me :-)<br>
If you average what you gave me, 31 seconds and 34 seconds, that gives 32.5 seconds, which you obtained from the formula.<br>
<br>
I thought that this formula might could be used to find out where you are suppposed to be time-wise or even define where a lucky time would fall. Of course, this formula cannot account for situations you know that will cut the time by a big facot but for most solves, it works.<br>

<br>
I will not suggest a method for you but I will give you some advice: Research all the methods you can and find the one you are willing to work at. For example, if you don&#x27;t want to memorize a lot of algorithms, don&#x27;t expect to get very good at the Fridrich method. If you are not motivated enough to learn more than 20 algorithms, stick with what you are doing. You cannot speedcube without a bit of motivation :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
interestingly, the ONLY solutions to Ron&#x27;s puzzle:<br>
<br>
&gt; Find an algorithm that from a solved cube:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; = gives back a solved cube after executing it twice<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; AND<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; = gives back a solved cube after adding the move U at the end of the <br>
&gt; algorithm and executing that new algorithm three times<br>
<br>
are Fridrich&#x27;s L permutation  ( B^2 L U L&#x27;B^2 R D&#x27;R D R^2 is one way of doing this)  and Fridrich&#x27;s R permutation  (this can be done with B&#x27; U^2 B U&#x27;R&#x27;F R B&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27;R U&#x27;B U&#x27;) along with all of their reflections/ symetries. (which leads to only 16 possible &#x27;different&#x27; answers!.  &#x27;different&#x27; meaning that they do different things to the cube).<br>
<br>
I have a proof of this if anyone is interested...(it&#x27;s not that slick, but it does exhibit some interesting qualities of the cube and it&#x27;s group theory).<br>
<br>
and Chris, your observations are very interesting ones.  And your idea of &#x27;odd&#x27; and &#x27;even&#x27; IS the natural way of thinking about it.  People studying groups use a similar idea...which I&#x27;ll try to explain here.<br>
<br>
As you may have noticed, a single quarter-face turn moves the four aproppriate corners in a cycle and the four corners in a cycle.  (at this point we&#x27;re ignoring the idea of orientation) We could say that these cycles are of length 4 because they move four pieces in a cycle, and becasue doing this move four times ( example R^4) brings every piece back to where it started.  So we have a permutation of cube pieces (not an extremely interesting one because it&#x27;s only a quarter turn, but it&#x27;s still a permutation).  <br>
<br>
Now a four cycle includes a lot of pieces ( 4 = a lot?..just bear with me) So can we look at this more clearly by breaking it up?  Well, the smallest possible permutation would have only two pieces, where two pieces just swap, and we&#x27;ll call this simple swapping a transposition.  An interesting fact is that every permutation (no matter how large) can be broken down into a sequence of succesive transpositions.  In english: Instead of studying the 4-cycles in our quarter turn, or any large permutation for that matter, we could just break it up into lots of tranpositions, just little 2-cycles, and study them instead.<br>
<br>
An illustrative example of how permutations can be broken down into transpositions is to consider R^2 B^2 R F R&#x27;B^2 R F&#x27;R on the cube (my favorite 3-cycle of corners)  Label the corners involved A, B, and C, and label them so this sequence of moves sends A to B&#x27;s spot, B to C&#x27;s spot, and C back to A&#x27;s spot.  Well, instead of doing all the &#x27;switching spots&#x27; at once we could have A and C switch places and THEN have A and B switch places (I emphasize the THEN because the order in which these are performed does matter) and these two swaps have the same result as the whole 3-cycle.  <br>
<br>
So we&#x27;ve factored our 3-cycle down into 2 transpositions.  And in the same fashion, every permutation can be broken down into just a sequence of transpositions.  The way that you might break a permutation down is not unique...for our 3-cycle, we could&#x27;ve swapped B and C, and then swapped A and C to get the same result.  But an incredibly interesting fact is that NO MATTER HOW you break a permutation down into tranpositions, the NUMBER of transpositions you get in the end is always the same!  (and here, I finally hit the punch line)  Which led people to classify permutations: a permutation is considered &#x27;odd&#x27; if it breaks into an odd number of transpositions, and called &#x27;even&#x27; if it breaks into an even number of transpositions.  <br>
<br>
And, as one can verify, a 4-cycle will always break down into 3 transpositions....so any 4-cycle will always be an ODD permutation.  Which tells us any one quarter-face turn on the cube is an odd permutation of the corners and on the edges. But the solved cube has 0 corners and edges permuted, which breaks down into 0 transpositions, so to get from a solved cube to a solved cube you must do an even permutation.  (you could posible be doing the simplest permutation out there: doing nothing!, but that&#x27;s still an even permutation)  And as one may also notice, strings of permutations (doing one first and then the other) follow the same odd/even rule of addition of integers....odd permutation followed by an odd permutation is an even permutation.  odd + odd = even....  So this tells us that in using quarter-face turns (an odd permutation) to reach any even state of the cube (or specifically, the solved cube) we MUST perform an even number of them. <br>
<br>
I hope that helps a little.  I would definately suggest picking up a book on group theory if you want a deeper understanding of this.  When dealing with the cube you might be specifically interesed in the Symetric groups and conjugation of group elements.  But overall, don&#x27;t think that learning group theory is a mountain you need to climb in order to understand something else, Group theory is incredibly interesting in itself!  And with your curiousity, I would bet that you wouldn&#x27;t find it boring.  And, all in all, it WILL help you uderstand the personality of the cube much better.  Many of those &quot;hmmm, why does this happen?&quot; questions will be answered much quicker when you understand some universal properties of groups.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The Petrus method is good for fewest moves. It also great for speedcubing. However, I have found myself trying to memorize more moves than found on Mr. Petrus&#x27;s site. I would suggest that if you are going to learn his method, learn all the moves in the beginner and advanced sections (about 7 I think.. maybe more) and then learn many others outside that site to assist you in the F2L.<br>

with the petrus method you need algs to &quot;fix&quot; the edges dont you?

easy. The algorithm is R T R&#x27;, or L&#x27; T&#x27; L depending on where the

that you orient the edges during the F2L, so the LL is reeaally 
simple.

          <div class="email-content">No, you don&#x27;t need algorithms at all to fix edges. Not<br>
once you understand how the exchange it happening. One<br>
quarter turn of any of the three planes that contain a<br>
2x2 of the 2x2x3 can be turned one quarter turn and<br>
still leave one of two moveable faces. So you just<br>
move one of those planes swap a bad edge with the new<br>
good edge and return that plane to the 2x2x3.<br>
<br>
On the flipside, in the sense that an algorithm is a<br>
step by step procedure for solving a problem, you do<br>
need algorithms, I agree. However, if somebody said to<br>
move the drf to ulb you would know to do something<br>
like 2r u&#x27;. It is an algorithm, but it is not one that<br>
you need to know. It just makes sense that you would<br>
move it there.<br>
<br>
So yes you are right, you do need algorithms, I only<br>

they have to memorize procedures when the procedures<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s the &quot;meat&quot; of everyone&#x27;s time. The F2L is the most challenging part of solving a cube. I&#x27;m really not that experienced. I&#x27;m in the mid 40 sec range. So anyone feel free to disagree, but it seems to me that the only real way to get better at solving the pairs is practice and experience. But here are some of my thoughts:<br>
1. After awhile the pairs just sort of pop out at you, so you don&#x27;t really have to look like crazy to find them (but sometimes it seems like the opposite of this happens).<br>
2. After the cross I always look straight at the top layer (I keep the cross on the bottom), for a pair. If I find one, I solve it and look at some of the other slots on the bottom two layers for pieces that I need. <br>
3. I pay close attention to the pieces that get sent to the top layer after I solve a pair, as well as pieces on the top layer that are missing their corresponding piece. That way, I&#x27;ll know which pieces I should be looking for when I get towards the end of an algorithm.<br>

  I am curious what your hints are for the corner-edge placements of <br>
  the F2L. For me, this is the &quot;meat&quot; of my time and if I do poorly <br>
  here I do poorly overall. There has to be a faster way to do this. <br>
  What do you look for first (corner? edge?) and what do you find the <br>
  quickest/easiest methods are for locating and placing these pieces <br>
  at an optimum pace?<br>

If you average what you gave me, 31 seconds and 34 seconds, that gives 32.5 seconds, which you obtained from the formula.

I thought that this formula might could be used to find out where you are suppposed to be time-wise or even define where a lucky time would fall. Of course, this formula cannot account for situations you know that will cut the time by a big facot but for most solves, it works.

I think it depends a lot on your dexterity and how much time you spend searching, but I solve in about that same number of moves using the same method. I generally solve in around 40 with a personal best of 29.84. I spend way to much time evaluating which way will yield the best results, so I bet you could go a lot faster than I can.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m totally with you on the F2L algs not feeling likes algs in the 
way that the LL algs do. For any layer based method, whether it be 
Jessica&#x27;s, Lars&#x27; or a less efficient &#x27;complete 1st layer then 
complete 2nd layer&#x27; method, I think the F2L is really more about 
intuition. This is quite different to solving the LL, in my opinion 
anyway. ;)

My guess is that many people who have spent a lot of time playing 
with layer-based methods would probably feel that solving F2L is 
different to LL (please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong!)

Or maybe it&#x27;s just different ways that people think about things? 
When I was studying Jessica&#x27;s F2L method, I didn&#x27;t actually read each 
alg step-by-step. I just read the general idea, ie. (1) form the 
cross, (2) group an edge + corner, (3) insert edge + corner (4) 
repeat steps 2 and 3 until F2L complete. I then just played around 
with my cube until I got comfortable with the idea. I found that I 
could fairly quickly get comfortable with the idea for general 
solving, but not speedsolving. It takes a while for algs to sink in 
enough for me to be comfortable using them for speed solving.

When stuff feels more like &#x27;just what you do&#x27; (ie. F2L intuition) 
rather than strict sequences (ie. complex LL algs), it kinda makes me 
feel more &#x27;at one&#x27; with the cube. Probably because I&#x27;m actually 
understanding what I&#x27;m doing rather than just blinding applying. What 
do others think?

over your eyes?
sorry, had to be said ;)

to me, i have to agree, i don&#x27;t care where the person puts their 
other hand...it doesn&#x27;t matter really. i&#x27;m not sure about pushing the 
fingers of the other hand, but boy that made me laugh...would like to 
see that video.

so that&#x27;s my &quot;vote&quot;
do what you want with your other hand.

Dan / wc2003 org team: a short time ago you posted the following:

&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen,/I am only going to say this 1 time and 1 time
only./First off, If anyone has issues surrounding the WC2003 event,
you are to bring forth your comments to wc2003 org team NOT THIS
FORUM!!!!&quot;

Although I personally do not mind the speedsolvingrubikscube forum
being used to raise issues about the coming competition I remain
sympathetic with you on this one: we have an official forum and we
should all use it to our advantage.  BUT I also think that if you -
DanG  - use the speedsolvingrubikscube  forum to talk about &quot;issues

to or not!  Even if there is some logic behind why your posts (like
this one, about standards for 1 handed solving) are acceptable and
others are not, the distinction must be a fairly subtle one, so don&#x27;t
be surprised if posts about the event continue to surface in this
forum, even if you would prefer that they did not.

Also, I wouldn&#x27;t be too worried about reading and replying to emails
from this forum, although it is reassuring to hear from you how badly
you do not want to jeopadise any result.  Because you are the main
organisor of the event it will be expected that there will be
ommunication between yourself and the people competing. And afterall,
everything that is exchanged here is hardly private.  

AND A NOTE TO EVERYONE ELSE

If you are interested in the coming world championships and are not a
member of the yahoo wc2003 forum then why not join up?  The forum is
moderated, but that means that what appears there is more reliable
then this one regarding event matters.

I think the main reason people use this forum to talk about issues 
surrounding the upcoming world championship because this forum has 
many more members, and this this forum is used much more than the 
official world championship forum.  I myself very rarely check the 
WC forum.  I do have the posts for that forum emailed to me though.  
So I completely understand why people post these issues here.  I 
also dont think makes much difference, because the main organizer 
for the WC still checks this forum occasionally.  Unless Dan insists 
on all questions for the WC being brought up on that forum.  I think 
doing that would cut down on the amount of replys to the questions 
though.

These are just my thoughts on it.

I did read the rules: the rules have changed since I posted the 27 
move solution, perhaps to prevent it. Unfortunately the rules now 
disallow any solution as any solution is equivalent to the inverse 
of the scrambling algorithm (in the cube group - there may be 
solutions that are not equivalent in the supergroup, but surely that 
isn&#x27;t what is being sort).

A more specific equivalence relation could be set up.
Thus two words might be considered equivalent not if they are 
equivalent in the group in the ordinary sense but if they differ by 
insertion of subwords that are equivalent to the identity (so that 
you can&#x27;t just stick in things like RR&#x27; or RLR&#x27;L&#x27; or 
R2F2R2F2R2F2R2F2R2F2R2F2 etc.). Of course, a formal definition of 
the relation would be required.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jake,

   Thanks for posting this. Very interesting.

   How does this account for slice moves? I count slice moves as one
move - equal to the outer layers, and this creates a problem for some
of what you wrote. L&#x27; R equates to r&#x27;(with a whole cube rotation)

   So first I do L&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U2 R U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U R&#x27; which is
17 moves (I know it&#x27;s not as efficient as Fridrich&#x27;s L permutation)
   If I rotate the cube QR&#x27; I can then go: r&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U2 R U2 L&#x27; R&#x27;
U R U&#x27; L U R&#x27; which is only 16 moves. And it solves itself. 

   Also, has anyone applied group theory to the 2x2x2?

   Thanks again,

   David J

People studying groups use a similar idea...which I&#x27;ll try to explain

this point we&#x27;re ignoring the idea of orientation) We could say that
these cycles are of length 4 because they move four pieces in a cycle,
and becasue doing this move four times ( example R^4) brings every
piece back to where it started.  So we have a permutation of cube
pieces (not an extremely interesting one because it&#x27;s only a quarter
turn, but it&#x27;s still a permutation).

with me) So can we look at this more clearly by breaking it up?  Well,
the smallest possible permutation would have only two pieces, where
two pieces just swap, and we&#x27;ll call this simple swapping a
transposition.  An interesting fact is that every permutation (no
matter how large) can be broken down into a sequence of succesive
transpositions.  In english: Instead of studying the 4-cycles in our
quarter turn, or any large permutation for that matter, we could just
break it up into lots of tranpositions, just little 2-cycles, and
study them instead.

and label them so this sequence of moves sends A to B&#x27;s spot, B to C&#x27;s
spot, and C back to A&#x27;s spot.  Well, instead of doing all the
&#x27;switching spots&#x27; at once we could have A and C switch places and THEN
have A and B switch places (I emphasize the THEN because the order in
which these are performed does matter) and these two swaps have the
same result as the whole 3-cycle.

the same fashion, every permutation can be broken down into just a
sequence of transpositions.  The way that you might break a
permutation down is not unique...for our 3-cycle, we could&#x27;ve swapped
B and C, and then swapped A and C to get the same result.  But an
incredibly interesting fact is that NO MATTER HOW you break a
permutation down into tranpositions, the NUMBER of transpositions you
get in the end is always the same!  (and here, I finally hit the punch
line)  Which led people to classify permutations: a permutation is
considered &#x27;odd&#x27; if it breaks into an odd number of transpositions,
and called &#x27;even&#x27; if it breaks into an even number of transpositions.  
> 
> And, as one can verify, a 4-cycle will always break down into 3
transpositions....so any 4-cycle will always be an ODD permutation. 
Which tells us any one quarter-face turn on the cube is an odd
permutation of the corners and on the edges. But the solved cube has 0
corners and edges permuted, which breaks down into 0 transpositions,
so to get from a solved cube to a solved cube you must do an even
permutation.  (you could posible be doing the simplest permutation out
there: doing nothing!, but that&#x27;s still an even permutation)  And as
one may also notice, strings of permutations (doing one first and then
the other) follow the same odd/even rule of addition of
integers....odd permutation followed by an odd permutation is an even
permutation.  odd + odd = even....  So this tells us that in using
quarter-face turns (an odd permutation) to reach any even state of the
cube (or specifically, the solved cube) we MUST perform an even number
of them.

book on group theory if you want a deeper understanding of this.  When
dealing with the cube you might be specifically interesed in the
Symetric groups and conjugation of group elements.  But overall, don&#x27;t
think that learning group theory is a mountain you need to climb in
order to understand something else, Group theory is incredibly
interesting in itself!  And with your curiousity, I would bet that you
wouldn&#x27;t find it boring.  And, all in all, it WILL help you uderstand
the personality of the cube much better.  Many of those &quot;hmmm, why
does this happen?&quot; questions will be answered much quicker when you
understand some universal properties of groups.

That&#x27;s not completely accurate. It&#x27;s always the same modulo 2 but 
not always the same. That is to say, if you break a permutation up 
into a product of j transpositions and if you break the same 
permutation up into a product of k transpositions then j-k will be 
even, but j-k need not be 0.

It&#x27;s a fairly trivial matter to see that the uniqueness problem is 
equivalent to showing that the identity permutation can&#x27;t be 
expressed as a product of an odd number of transpositions - so this 
is the key thing to show. The existence problem is fairly 
straightforward (for finite permutation groups - it&#x27;s not true for 
infinite permutation groups). The easiest way to get existence is to 
observe that it suffices to show the result for cycles and then to 
use induction on the length of the cycle, together with (a1 ... a
{n+1}) =(a1 ... an)(a1 a{n+1}) (or =(a1 a{n+1})(a1 ... an), 
depending on which direction you read your groups). You also need 
the (almost) obvious detail that every permutation can be expressed 
as a product of disjoint cycles. Sorry if your post touched on this -
 I did look at it, but then I cut out most of it to object to the 
one line so I can&#x27;t recall if you mentioned this.

One obtains that there is a homomorphism from any (finite) 
permutation group into the group of 2 elements {0,1} under addition 
modulo 2. The kernel of the homomorphism is the alternating group.
Since it has index 2 in the full symmetric group it is a normal 
subgroup. The alternating group is generated by 3-cycles.

In particular, if you have the disjoint cycle decomposition of the 
permutation you can quickly figure out if it is odd or even since 
even cycles have odd length and odd cycles have even length.

(For infinite permutation groups, transpositions don&#x27;t generate 
since any finite word in transpositions permutes only finitely many 
elements.)

In fact the symmetric group is generated by close transpositions (1 
2), (2 3), (3 4), ..., (n 1). Similar results hold for the 
alternating group and 3-cycles.

   There&#x27;s an interesting symmetry inside the algorithm B2 L U L&#x27; B2 R
D&#x27; R D R2 can be seen if you do it in a 2x2x2 cube, since B2 and F2,

   B2 R U&#x27;R&#x27;

   You might see the symmetry I&#x27;m talking about.

You&#x27;re in a different permutation group when you allow slices as the 
centres can get permuted also. In any case the actual generators you 
are using are not the transpositions themselves. There is no reason 
why a move can&#x27;t be done one way with an odd number of moves by your 
counting method and another way with an even number of counting 
moves. You need to count things like L&#x27;R, LR and R2 as 2 moves if 
you want to get the number of moves to be equal modulo 2.

Lots of it. The diameter is known for a start. The 2x2x2 has a 
fairly small group. It may well have been &quot;fully&quot; analyzed - 
depending on what you want &quot;fully&quot; to mean. In terms of the cube, 
I&#x27;d have thought optimal solutions would have been worked out for 
every position. It&#x27;s certainly feasible. So also the average number 
of moves needed and the standard deviation of such etc. could be 
worked out, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after.

If you had a lot of time, you could probably get CubeSolver to do a 
lot of the work for you - except it is for 3x3x3 cubes - maybe Ron&#x27;s 
solver would be more effective here. You can effectively fix one 
corner in position and mess the other stuff around. That would give 
you 7!*3^6 possibilities to play around with. The 7! stuff you could 
work out by building up the permutations from transpositions. Then 
to each you could apply orientation algorithms and then cut it down.

You can build up a list of longer algorithms in, for instance, an 
Excel sheet (need about 61 sheets or so at 12*5040 per sheet - of 
course, you could do less, but it will be harder to organize things) 
and then get the solver to cut the length down for you.

I finally got to see the Hardwick movie at pace - in Schiphol 
airport where I was stranded for almost 10 hours on Saturday the 
connection was too slow so I didn&#x27;t actually see any twisting. It 
was like still photography with the cube occasionally changing.

Anyway, after this I&#x27;m not sure Chris is human - he&#x27;s not much 
slower than I am if I use 2 hands! Are machines/androids allowed to 
compete?

Group theory is applicable to any cube,  from 21x2x2 to 5x5x5. As a 
matter of fact, you can apply a corner-solution algorithm to corners 
of any cube. 
Apply a given sequence to a cube to produce a pattern. Another 
sequence will produce a different pattern. ll those patterns 
constitute elements of a mathematical group, whose identity element 
is a solved cube.

There are technical issues here. I tried to post before on this but 
the post didn&#x27;t come through so I guess it was blocked or something. 
Anyway, the usual 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 aren&#x27;t groups if you identify 
positions that look the same.

That&#x27;s not entirely true. If we mark the centres then it is, but if 
we identify two positions that look the same (as in the usual 
solving of 4x4x4 or 5x5x5) then the cubes don&#x27;t have a group 
structure anymore.

For instance, you can do this

x=r&#x27;drd2r&#x27;drFr&#x27;d&#x27;rd2r&#x27;d&#x27;rF2r&#x27;drd2r&#x27;drFr&#x27;d&#x27;rd2r&#x27;d&#x27;r

On a solved 4x4x4 this will result in a solved 4x4x4.

In general, though, it will change the position of the cube.
For instance, suppose y=r&#x27;d&#x27;rd2r&#x27;drF&#x27;r&#x27;drd2r&#x27;drF.
Note that if you do y on a solved cube the lower right centre of the 
F face is a L centre. If you then apply x you will see that this 
centre becomes the upper right centre of the F face. So x moves some 
centres around, but it doesn&#x27;t visually change the solved cube. As a 
result if you identify positions that look the same then you won;t 
get a group.

This is my opinion on it all...i hope it helps a bit.

any more than that and you&#x27;re just gonna end up
getting closer to the solution

a little more than i&#x27;m used to, but it wouldn&#x27;t hurt

lets get this mixed real well :P

I&#x27;m starting to think people won&#x27;t wanna scramble so
much...

i&#x27;m not a big fan of this puzzle anyway...what about
twisting corners?
> Megaminx- 50 scrambling turns
other than the 3x3, i&#x27;ve dealt the most with this
puzzle.  To get pieces sufficently randomized among 12
faces will take at least this much scrambling.  As far
as notation for scrambling, i think it would go
something like:
U-up face
D-down face
L-left face
R-right face
F-front face
Dr-down right face
Dl-down left face
Ul-up left face
Ur-up right face
(from here you could just put axis turns to get
everything mixed up well.  this is something i would
prefer.  but otherwise....:
B-back face
Br-Back right face
Bl-back left face
>>>as far as multiple turns,
clockwise/counter-clockwise turns should be signified
by - and +. multiple turns could be shown by number of
-s or +s 
Part of a scrambling alg could look like this:
Br++ D- F-- Fr+ Fl-- D+ etc etc
++there ya go jess, i hope that helps

Here we differ - I think I&#x27;d have a hard time keeping Ur and Ul <br>

&gt; should look like and how many moves to be applied on the puzzles.<br>
[snip]<br>
&gt; How many moves should be applied to the cubes?<br>
Well, for the competition in the fall, it&#x27;s going to be:<br>
2x2x2/3x3x3 - 25 moves<br>
4x4x4 - 40 moves<br>
5x5x5/megaminx - 60 moves<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d say 25 is more than necessary for the 2x2x2 (maybe only 15 for <br>
that one), but I&#x27;ve often wondered if 25 for the 3x3x3 and 60 for the <br>
megaminx are really enough.  I realize &quot;random&quot; human scrambling and <br>
random scrambles provided by a computer are different, but I&#x27;ve found <br>
that a megaminx still seems too &quot;together&quot; after only 60 moves - I <br>
aim for more like 70-80 when scrambling.  The pyraminx doesn&#x27;t have <br>
very much scrambling to be done - maybe 10-15 for that one as well.  <br>
I&#x27;d say just make sure that each &quot;tip&quot; is offset from it&#x27;s &quot;peak&quot;, <br>
and that not more than 2 &quot;peaks&quot; are pre-aligned and each &quot;peak&quot; (tip <br>
= 1 layer, peak = 2 layers).<br>
<br>
As far as notation, I&#x27;d say that you could hold the puzzle with a <br>
face directed toward you, and one toward the table (down).  Then, use <br>
upper and lower case to specify &quot;peak&quot; or &quot;tip&quot; moves respectively.  <br>
With the puzzle in this configuration, you would have peaks U, L, R, <br>
and B, and tips u, l, r, and b.  An example scrambling alg could be:<br>
u l&#x27; r&#x27; b U R U L&#x27; B etc.<br>
The first four moves offset the tips from the peaks, and the rest <br>
messes up the peaks/edges.  After thinking about it, I think I&#x27;d lean <br>
more toward 15 moves to scramble this (rather than 10 moves).<br>

    observation(s)</strong></a><br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

First, thanks for the correction GameOfDeath2 (interestingly, I wasn&#x27;t able to locate your name).  I also like the fact that since the collection of close transposition (1 2), (2 3), ... (n 1) generate the symmetric group, they you can quickly get that the two elements (1 2) and (1 2 3 ... n) generate the whole symmetric group.  (of course, the choice of the transposition (1 2) is arbitrary)

Second, I admit that my claim that I had found ALL 16 possible solutions to Ron&#x27;s puzzle was a little overzealous and premature.  Those 16 answers do, in fact, work.  But in my &#x27;proof&#x27; that that was  all I made a few incorrect assumptions.  Now, after fixing those mistakes, I find that there are truthfully 100,320 different answers.  (you could say I was a bit off at first!)  And below is a proof that all 100,320 of them exist, and are, infact, the only solutions.

But first I figure I&#x27;ll mention something else.  Today I was computing the number of elements in the cube group with order 2 (this means all possible different actions (sequences) done on the cube which when done twice will bring you back to a solved cube) and I had some fun producing these sequences:

F2 U&#x27; F2 U2 F&#x27; R D&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U2 L2 R2 U2 F&#x27; R U2 F&#x27; L D&#x27;

according to our eyes, doing this once on the cube messes it up quite well.  But do it a second time.

B2 R2 U&#x27; F2 D2 U F D&#x27; R D2 B&#x27; L R D&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U2 F2

doing this twice results in the superflip (from a solved cube we&#x27;ve flipped every edge)

and

F2 R2 D2 U&#x27; L B&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; L2 U&#x27; B L R&#x27; F2 L&#x27; D&#x27; L F U&#x27;

this one done twice results in a supertwist (top four corners have been twisted clockwise a third of a turn, bottom corners have been twisted counterclockwise a third of a turn).

And is the process of looking at what a certain sequence can &#x27;leave behind&#x27; when it is done twice (it can be said that those above &#x27;leave behind&#x27; a solved cube, a superflip, and a supertwist respectivily).  I figured out that no sequence of moves can ever &#x27;leave behind&#x27; (when executed twice) just a flip of two edges or just a twist of two corners.  Of course, these flips and twists CAN be done to a cube.  But just not in the manner that I&#x27;m suggesting.  That&#x27;s what I find interesting.  I wonder what states of the cube CAN be &#x27;left behind&#x27; as a result of doing a sequence twice.  (obviously, no &#x27;odd&#x27; states of the cube (where an odd number of face turns will be used to reach a solved cube) because we&#x27;ve already performed an even number of face turns to get what&#x27;s &#x27;left behind&#x27;).

Oh, and I did get the result that there are 170,911,549,183 different elements of the cube group with order 2....is that consistent with an answer anyone else can come up with?

Anyhow, on with my proof:

So Ron proposed the problem:

>
> = gives back a solved cube after executing it twice
>

well first let&#x27;s suppose that we have a sequence of moves/an action on the cube called X that satisfies both of these criteria.

So doing X twice results in a solved cube, and performing X followed by U three times results in a solved cube.

Note: I am going to write &quot;X followed by U&quot; as UX.  This may seem backwards but just think of it as reading right to left...you&#x27;ll quickly see why I use this notation.

Now a few important points that I will use multiple times:

*1) X^2 results in a solved cube means that X only swaps corners and swaps edges....in other words, if piece A went to spot B, then B must&#x27;ve gove to A&#x27;s spot.

*2) X cannot swap two edges (or corners) that both reside in the bottom two layers.  Why? well suppose X did swap two edges (or corners) that both lived in the bottom two layer.  Since U doesn&#x27;t affect the bottom two layers then X and UX both have the same effect on these pieces.  So (UX) swaps them while (UX)^2 puts them both back in their spots, but then (UX)^3 swaps them again...and we know that (UX)^3 must result in a solved cube...contradiction, so X cannot send two bottom pieces to each other.

Now suppose that X DOES affect an edge piece in the bottom two layers (by affect I mean &#x27;move&#x27;...I&#x27;ll deal with the idea of orientation later).  By *2 this edge piece must exchange places with something in the top layer.  Without loss of generality I&#x27;ll assume that &#x27;UF&#x27; is the edge from the top layer involved in this swapping. (to aviod confusion of notation I use these little guys, &#x27;&#x27;, when talking about a certain cube piece or spot on the cube and won&#x27;t use them when speaking about face movements of the cube...&#x27;UF&#x27; as opposed to UF).  So we have the swapping (&#x27;UF&#x27; &#x27;z&#x27;) where &#x27;z&#x27; is some edge piece in the bottom two layers.  (the parenthesis are short hand for a permutation).

And now I also want to introduce the notation for cube actions acting on a certain cube piece...for this I will use square brackets.  So   U[&#x27;UF&#x27;] = &#x27;UL&#x27; means that U done on a cube moves the piece &#x27;UF&#x27; to the spot &#x27;UL&#x27;.  So our cycle above, (&#x27;UF&#x27; &#x27;z&#x27;), could be writen as X[&#x27;UF&#x27;]=&#x27;z&#x27;.  And the &#x27;movement&#x27; part of Ron&#x27;s initial criteria (ignoring orientation) could be restated as X^3[&#x27;p&#x27;]=XXX[&#x27;p&#x27;]=&#x27;p&#x27; and (UX)^3[&#x27;p&#x27;]=&#x27;p&#x27; no matter what piece &#x27;p&#x27; is.

Hopefuly now you can see why I&#x27;ve choosen to write UX instead of XU for &#x27;do X and then U&#x27;.  Because with the square brackets we want to opperate from right to left.  So that first doing X and then U on a piece &#x27;p&#x27; can be performed step by step with this notation, moving out from the brackets.  UX[&#x27;p&#x27;] = U(X[&#x27;p&#x27;])...you first do X and then U.

So, back to the cycle (&#x27;UF&#x27; &#x27;z&#x27;) where &#x27;z&#x27; is some piece from the bottom two layers.  Now I am going to prove that if this cycle exists then (&#x27;UL&#x27; &#x27;UR&#x27;) must also be a cycle in X.  That is, that X[&#x27;UL&#x27;]=&#x27;UR&#x27;

Now we have that UXUXUX[&#x27;UF&#x27;]= &#x27;UF&#x27;,  Along with the fact that X[&#x27;UF&#x27;]=&#x27;z&#x27;.

So UXUXU(X[&#x27;UF&#x27;]) = UXUXU[&#x27;z&#x27;].

- U doesn&#x27;t affect &#x27;z&#x27; (it&#x27;s in the bottom two layers)

so U[&#x27;z&#x27;]=&#x27;z&#x27;.

And then with this we have that UXUXU[&#x27;z&#x27;] = UXUX(U[&#x27;z&#x27;]) = UXUX[&#x27;z&#x27;] = &#x27;UF&#x27; &lt;-(this last &#x27;UF&#x27; is because of the first line of this paragraph...in these steps we&#x27;ve only affected the left side of my original equality)

  ....(Honestly, pulling out your cube and picturing whats happening here might help you out a little, and I&#x27;ll try to be a non-cryptic as possible)

So UXUX[&#x27;z&#x27;] = U(XUX[&#x27;z&#x27;]) = &#x27;UF&#x27; (what we got above)

and notice that the only thing which U sends to &#x27;UF&#x27; is &#x27;UR&#x27;

(....U[&#x27;UR&#x27;] = &#x27;UF&#x27;).

so U(XUX[&#x27;z&#x27;]) = &#x27;UF&#x27; = U[&#x27;UR&#x27;]

and so XUX[&#x27;z&#x27;] = &#x27;UR&#x27;

( you can think about it as doing the inverse of U ( U&#x27;) to both sides. )

Again, X[&#x27;UF&#x27;]=&#x27;z&#x27;, and X can only swap pieces, So X[&#x27;z&#x27;]=&#x27;UF&#x27;

So &#x27;UR&#x27; = XUX[&#x27;z&#x27;] = XU(X[&#x27;z&#x27;]) = XU[&#x27;UF&#x27;]

And, we know that U[&#x27;UF&#x27;] =&#x27;UL&#x27;

So &#x27;UR&#x27; = X(U[&#x27;UF&#x27;]) = X[&#x27;UL&#x27;]

Therefore, we have finally shown that if X exchanges &#x27;UF&#x27; and &#x27;z&#x27; then it must also exchange &#x27;UL&#x27; and &#x27;UR&#x27;.

Now, in the same manner, using the fact that X[&#x27;UL&#x27;]=&#x27;UR&#x27; and that (UR)^3[&#x27;UL&#x27;] = UXUXUX[&#x27;UL&#x27;] = &#x27;UL&#x27; and all the same ideas that I used in the preceeding arguement you can get that X[&#x27;UB&#x27;] = &#x27;y&#x27; where &#x27;y&#x27; is some edge piece other than &#x27;z&#x27; in the bottom two layer.  (basically, what you get is that because of the first two statements in my first sentence of this paragraph, X MUST move the piece &#x27;UB&#x27;.  It can&#x27;t move &#x27;UB&#x27; to any place on the top layer becasue &#x27;UF&#x27;, &#x27;UL&#x27;, and &#x27;UR&#x27; are already sent somewhere else.  So X[&#x27;UB&#x27;]=&#x27;y&#x27; where &#x27;y&#x27; is not in the top layer and it&#x27;s not already being sent some where else....i.e. &#x27;y&#x27; is a piece in the bottom two layers that&#x27;s not &#x27;z&#x27;.)

So what all of this gives us is that if X touches the bottom layer...3 swappings

X stays in the top layer

Same thing with edges

Orientations- cannot affect corners X doesn&#x27;t move, cannot affect the edges in the bottom two layers that X doesn&#x27;t move

Describe 2,3 cycles of edges

Case 1,
Case 2,

Decsribe 2,3 cycles of corners

Case 1,
Case 2,

Altogether

Final sequence

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

as you may notice, my response that was sent a few minutes ago kind of trains off.  It IS 5 in the morning over here and I&#x27;m extremely tired, but, sadly, that&#x27;s not the reason.  This is due to another one of those horrible &quot;my email just disappeared, and now I want to set fire to the monitor&quot; stories...(I never thought I&#x27;d be a victim).  Well, I DID have the rest of that proof typed out (and, OF COURSE, it was elegant).  I was reading back over it when my email account closed itself because it had been idle for more than 10 minutes.  Luckily I had saved part of it earlier so I reluctantly went back to that...figured I&#x27;d just type myself some notes on where I went from there before I lost it all, and go back and finish tomorrow....the best part about this plan being that I&#x27;d get some sleep.

Well, that was working OK until my computer brings me more bad news...It&#x27;s decided to do a routine shut-down, and tells me that I&#x27;d better use my last few sorry seconds to save everything I can...a sorta &#x27;get the kids down into the seller and make sure the cows tied up&#x27; situation.  Well, I wasn&#x27;t too calm at that point, so the best I managed was a few frantic clicks at anything that was in front of me.  At this point I think I should be grateful, with such careless clicking an accidentally sent email could be the least of my worries (In fact, I think I might&#x27;ve made a bid on a complete set of smurf figurines on ebay in those last few seconds, but I can&#x27;t be too sure).

So anyhow, I apologize.  If anyone seriously gets through as much of the proof as I&#x27;ve already sent, and is hanging on the edge of their seat for the rest.  Then I&#x27;ll try to organize my thoughts again and get it out to you.

I do want to include one last thought though.
Here&#x27;s a sequence that I found which solves Ron&#x27;s puzzle and exhibits the wildest behavior possible ( it swaps 3 pairs of edges and 3 pairs of corners while flipping everything it can....now WHY that&#x27;s the &#x27;wildest behavior possible&#x27;, well, see! I can tell.  you&#x27;re just dying with anticipation.)

U&#x27; L2 D R&#x27; D2 U B U&#x27; B&#x27; D2 U&#x27; R D&#x27; L2 U&#x27;

OK, good night

Well, that&#x27;s not entirely true either.
For instance, if the n-cycle is (1 2 3 ... n) then not any 
transposition will do, in general (although for some n any will do). 
Any close transposition would do with this n-cycle.
To illustrate this consider n=4 and take the the transposition (1 3) 
along with (1 2 3 4). You&#x27;ll find that these do not generate the 
symmetric group. (More generally, (1 2 3 ... n) and (1 k) will not 
generate S_n if k-1 and n are not coprime - here k&lt;=n, of course.)

At least 14 - since the diameter of the group is 14 (of course, it 
depends on what you count as one move). If you go less than the 
diameter of the group then you are excluding some cases so you will 
get a biased scramble. Also, you&#x27;d do well to sometimes use an odd 
number and sometimes an even number of moves (if you use QTM 
anyway) - similarly later.

> 3x3x3

I&#x27;d go for about 30 (HTM) here again as you&#x27;ll probably be sure of 
getting everything covered (I think diameter here is proven only to 
about 42 (QTM) and maybe 29 (HTM), but I may be wrong on the latter.)

> 4x4x4

It&#x27;s got to be a fair bit higher here. Maybe some stats on average 
number of moves to solve would be useful. Since we aren&#x27;t efficient 
you could probably reduce that number by 30-40% or more and you&#x27;d 
likely still be OK.

> 5x5x5

And again here. Really, an awful lot of moves.

Don&#x27;t know the notation here so I can&#x27;t make any suggestions.

> Megaminx

Again, I&#x27;m not sure of any results on the diameter here. My guess is 
take someone who solves it a lot and well (like Grant) and again 
discount the average number of moves by a certain percentage because 
the theoretically best methods are not the ones people use in 
practice.

I can maybe give some ideas to a megaminx one - would have to check 
some notes.

Another way to do it would be to randomly assemble the cube into a 
solvable state and then use some kind of program to solve it to get 
your scrambling algorithm.

Yes, but the quarter turn metric seems more pure in some sense. e.g. 
R2 does take longer to execute than R.
Perhaps, things like R2 could count somewhere between 1 and 2 moves. 
Of course the triangle inequality would need to be checked and it is 
also arguable that moves like RU&#x27; are as fast (or faster) than R2 
anyway.
The last point is true enough. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t see why 
scrambling should always be a fixed length. As long as they are 
sufficient in length varying the lengths occasionally may be useful. 
For instance, it may not be the case that every cube can be solved 
in exactly n moves (FTM) where n is 25 or 30 or whatever, even if 
every one could be solved in under 25 or 30 moves (respectively).

          <div class="email-content">Hello Jake,<br>
<br>
   How did you find these algorithms? More to the point, how did you<br>
recognize them when they&#x27;d been done once?<br>
<br>
David J<br>
<br>
&gt;  Today I was computing the number of elements in the cube group with<br>
order 2 (this means all possible different actions (sequences) done on<br>
the cube which when done twice will bring you back to a solved cube)<br>
and I had some fun producing these sequences:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; F2 U&#x27; F2 U2 F&#x27; R D&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U2 L2 R2 U2 F&#x27; R U2 F&#x27; L D&#x27;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; according to our eyes, doing this once on the cube messes it up<br>
quite well.  But do it a second time.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; B2 R2 U&#x27; F2 D2 U F D&#x27; R D2 B&#x27; L R D&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U2 F2<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; doing this twice results in the superflip (from a solved cube we&#x27;ve<br>
flipped every edge)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; and<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; F2 R2 D2 U&#x27; L B&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; L2 U&#x27; B L R&#x27; F2 L&#x27; D&#x27; L F U&#x27;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; this one done twice results in a supertwist (top four corners have<br>
been twisted clockwise a third of a turn, bottom corners have been<br>
twisted counterclockwise a third of a turn).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And is the process of looking at what a certain sequence can &#x27;leave<br>
behind&#x27; when it is done twice (it can be said that those above &#x27;leave<br>
behind&#x27; a solved cube, a superflip, and a supertwist respectivily).  I<br>
figured out that no sequence of moves can ever &#x27;leave behind&#x27; (when<br>
executed twice) just a flip of two edges or just a twist of two corners.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
    I just got bored today and decided to try a few different puzzles one handed.<br>
<br>
The 3x3x3 took 2:07.47<br>
The Homer 2x2x2 took 3:04.33<br>
The 5x5x5 took 19:13.47 (And really really made my hand sore)<br>
I did do the 4x4x4 once, without timing, but on my second run, when I did use the timer, it exploded.  One of my center cubies broke a while back and I had it superglued together, but it broke with catastrophic effects.  Also, the Square-1 is just about impossible 1 handed (for me at least).  I can solve it, but it&#x27;s kind of hit and miss, especially on the collapsing to a cube part.<br>
<br>
Anyone else got times for their cubes?  Oh, and I did make a one-handed video as well, but I have nowhere to upload it to.  So if anyone would like to host it for me, or if I can post it here (what&#x27;s the max file size?) I will :)<br>
<br>
Thanks all!<br>

Rubix Corner ( <a HREF=&quot;www.dilaigraphics.com/rubix.htm&quot;>www.dilaigraphics.com/rubix.htm&lt;/A> ) ONLY accepts PayPal because 
it&#x27;s the easiest method for internet transactions!  I have Rubik&#x27;s cubes, 
Square 1 puzzles from Zhaofeng, Siamese Cube 2&#x27;s, the Triple Rubi-X and 
others.  I even have items on ebay.  Just look up &quot;Rubik&quot; using the BROWSE

I will see what I can do for you!

My best time one handed is 57 seconds, and with feet it&#x27;s something

james, I&#x27;ve tried it with my feet, I usually hover around 5-7 minutes as well.  It&#x27;s way tough when your cube skews itself and won&#x27;t turn nicely.  That was my problem with the square 1 one handed as well.

It seems you have to provide an email address where they send the <br>
result to. They do not just give the result on the final webpage <br>
(just some spiel about buying a worthless certificate).<br>
<br>
I trust this site even less than I trust the validity of such a <br>
simple test, so I just gave my spammy email address, and they did <br>
send the result to it. I got 167, whatever that is worth. Let&#x27;s see <br>
if this generates more spam to that address.<br>

them once (the 2x2x2 + 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 Xmas Special late last year) and 
it was fine. In fact, I was surprised that it only took two weeks. I 
live in Australia and so I expected it to take longer that.

No offense to you, Jaap, but a score of 167 would probably qualify 
you as a member of MENSA (and maybe you are). However, had I received 
such a score, I would wonder, if they didn&#x27;t hike it up in order to 
make me buy that certificate, just to frame it,and hang it over my

          <div class="email-content">I posted this question about 2 weeks ago and pretty much everyone who 
replied said they started cubing some time between ages 10-20 years.

I&#x27;m sure that there are people who started older/younger than this, 
but the replies make me think that, generally, speedcubing is 
something that attracts teenagers more than any other age group. We 
get hooked at a young age and then can&#x27;t stop!!  :)

          <div class="email-content">A number in itself is pretty meaningless, what matters (assuming an <br>
IQ score matters at all) is what percentage of people can beat a <br>
particular score. For instance, the top 2% (ie eligible to join <br>
mensa) of the population could be those scoring above 147 on one test <br>
but above 132 on another test. I think those numbers are somewhere in <br>
the ballpark for the two main tests used in the world.<br>
<br>
Knowing a little about Jaaps background it is almost certain that he <br>
would be in the mensa bracket.<br>
 <br>
One thing I used to do to amuse myself is try to get IQs in the 300+ <br>
range. This is quite achievable by people with a reasonably high IQ <br>
by taking tests that don&#x27;t discriminate well at the top range of the <br>
test are are really designed for testing those in the middle 60-80% <br>
of the population. Get hold of some tests and try for yourself!<br>
<br>
The world record on the Standford-Binet test is 180 in the two main <br>
areas of that test ie word knowledge and number stuff. It is unable <br>
to distinguish between IQs above that level and hence that is the <br>
maximum score. Less reputable tests may claim to assess an IQ but the <br>
score they give you may be in an area where the test itself does not <br>
distinguish well.<br>
<br>
There are a number of tests available (look on the internet for <br>
sites - I assume there are still many there) that purport to be able <br>
to test people with super-IQs. I am not sure of the validity of such <br>
claims as there are too few people to be able to check the tests are <br>
accurate (whatever accurate means in this context).<br>
<br>
My own definition of cleverness lies in creativity, and although the <br>
Mind Olympics try to measure this I feel it is beyond measurement.<br>
<br>
- stiff_hands<br>
<br>
ps did you know that IQ tests were created to increase the proportion <br>
of people from lower income families getting into higher education, <br>
or is that just a popular misconception?<br>

I&#x27;ve had it done by Mensa before, when I was in my teens (probably 
early-mid teens). It was 174 then but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s meaningless. The 
first part was easier than the second which seemed to rely more on 
acquired knowledge.

this reminds me of something i&#x27;ve seen before...at least i think i 
have. not quite the same but close. an actual physical cube that has 
sliding tiles. one is missing, kind of like the 15 puzzles, and the 
cube twists the same as always, but the tiles can be shifted in and 
out of that slot. kind of like a missing link and cube as one puzzle.

so, am i the only one that knows what i&#x27;m talking about, or has 
anyone else seen this?

person can and *grow* and change (aptitude moves into other areas) but
since the early 1900&#x27;s the tests have given people the idea that if
their score is low that&#x27;s where they are stuck at for the rest of
their lives. Considering the inadequacy of these tests to measure
accurately this is a real drag.

          <div class="email-content">When I ordered from Mefferts, the 4x4x4 cube and the Square-1 I ordered showed up just fine and in a timely manner, however the 5x5x5 cube I ordered was the wrong color scheme when it showed up.  So I contacted the site and mentioned this to them.  They took their time sending me the replacement and when I finally did recieve it, the quality was far less than that of the one I had already.  After about 15 or so twists the puzzle got very very loose, and eventually disintegrated in my hands.
So I sent them back the &quot;correct&quot; color scheme one and kept the other puzzle, which works very well.  I&#x27;m just a bit wary now is all.  And they don&#x27;t accept paypal anyway, or I&#x27;d have ordered from them a long time ago :) Cause the other two puzzles work great, and you just can&#x27;t beat his selection really.

  What were your problems when ordering from Mefferts? I ordered from 
  them once (the 2x2x2 + 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 Xmas Special late last year) and 
  it was fine. In fact, I was surprised that it only took two weeks. I 
  live in Australia and so I expected it to take longer that.

Congratulations for figuring out solutions for the gliding cube.  In fact early today someone already proved that the whole puzzle can be solved by sliding moves only.  I just haven&#x27;t had chance to update my website yet.<br>

          <div class="email-content">A routine I use is to pick an alg, and execute it consecutively on the cube until the particular case comes up... then you should be able to solve it very consistently :)<br>

Repeat for all algorithms, some take longer to come round the cycle than others :)<br>

I&#x27;m sorry I missed your second question.  Your problem is strange.  I cannot duplicate it.  Could you double check your steps?  Please not that when you are ready to solve, and the pattern file is ready(either loaded from a file, or created and saved by yourself), you need to click on the &quot;Record Solution&quot; button to start recording. When you finished solving you can click on &quot;Stop Recording&quot; and save the solution.  This should work.  However, currently my game file does not store solution command buffer. So if you closed the program and later reopen it, you cannot continue to record solution from where you left anymore.  Sorry, this is a little bit inconvenient.  <br>

&gt; That&#x27;s a pretty neat idea.  It looks very nice too.  However, I <br>
&gt; didn&#x27;t find much difficulty in coming up with a solution.  Based on <br>
&gt; what I figured out, I&#x27;d say that it is possible to solve any given <br>
&gt; state with only sliding moves, if you so desire.  I was going to <br>
&gt; solve your 10x10x10 challenge (problem #3), but found that the puzzle <br>
&gt; moved much too slowly.  Is there any way I can speed up or eliminate <br>
&gt; the animation so that I&#x27;m not constantly waiting for moves to finish?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Another thing I noticed, is that when I saved my solution part way <br>
&gt; through, reloaded the pattern file, and loaded in the solution file, <br>
&gt; and played it, it didn&#x27;t get me back to where I had been - is this <br>
&gt; the way it should be?  I was thinking maybe I could do the challenge <br>
&gt; in parts.  Any help you can offer?<br>

&gt; &gt; Currently on Rubik&#x27;s Cube the only move you can do is twist and<br>

&gt; &gt; like if the color tiles can also slide across the face?  Yes, that<br>
&gt; &gt; will be a new puzzle!  Think about it, if the tiles slide by just<br>
&gt; &gt; one tile position then no Rubik&#x27;s Cube algorithm can solve it. <br>
&gt; &gt; This is actually an extremely challenging puzzle.  No one has been<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree, I think that the score is altered by adding about 50 points, 
thereby making you want to buy that certificate more. I took it and 
got a 177. The average IQ is about 100-110, and a genius is above 
130. Boy, I&#x27;m smart. LOL
Actually, I did take a test when I was in 5th grade to get into the 
Gifted and Talented program, and my teacher said I scored reeaally 
high. Maybe I am a genius.

&quot;How did you find these algorithms? More to the point, how did you

-I didn&#x27;t actually invent them myself (I wish I had that capacity though).  I just figured out what I wanted the cube to look like, so that perfoming twice the sequence that got us there would produce the desired outcome.  Then I used &quot;Cube Explorer&quot; to find the algorithms that would generate the cube that I had constructed.  I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve had the joy of working with &#x27;cube explorer&#x27; before, but I&#x27;ve found it to be extremely useful.  You can download this at www.home.t-online.de/home/Kociemba/cube.htm    or, as I usually do, you can follow the link off of Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s web page.

twice for a edge pair flip, or this classic:
L&#x27; F2 L U&#x27; B2 U
twice for a corner pair twist.&quot;

-you are right.  I was working with sequences that were only allowed to flip/twist pieces if they also moved them.  With this restriction my statement is correct...but I was wrong in assuming that this covered all possible sequences, so I was forgetting that I&#x27;d restricted myself....I&#x27;m feeling a little ignorant at this point.

I was just thought to see everyone&#x27;s IQ would be interesting, so it would be cool if everyone went to:

and took the test (just a 15 minute test), and then (if they wanted, of course) post their iq. Just an interesting idea. I got a score of 138 from this test.

          <div class="email-content">No, your description was fine. My post was replying to MrTrickyPants. 
MrTrickyPants was talking about the type of puzzle where one item 
(tiles in his case) is missing and and the other tiles use the blank 
slot to shift around. I was just making the point that there is some 
similarity between what he described and the puzzle I saw because the 
puzzle I saw had one cubie missing and the other cubies used that 
empty space to move around the 3D space in the whole cube. 
MrTrickyPants was talking about the cube twisting as well. The puzzle 
I saw doesn&#x27;t do this, which is why I said his description &quot;reminds 
me a little of a puzzle I found&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone, I had a lot of fun doing the fewest moves challenge, <br>
and anyway, I know a lot of people out there wonder if corner&#x27;s first <br>
method is any good or not, and some may not even understand how it <br>
works.  Well now you can see for yourself.<br>
<br>
Go get your favorite cube, put your favorite color on B and scramble, <br>
<br>
B&#x27; L2 D2 L&#x27; B F2 R B&#x27; L R&#x27; U&#x27; B2 F U B R&#x27; D2 L&#x27; D U2 F B&#x27; L2 R&#x27; U2<br>
<br>
Using this scramble, here is the solution I came up with(look below <br>
if you want to do it in steps):<br>
<br>
B2 L2 U2 B&#x27; U B U&#x27; F&#x27; (U&#x27;D) R&#x27; B&#x27; (U&#x27;D) (F2B2) (RL&#x27;) U&#x27; F&#x27; U F L<br>
F2 U&#x27; (F2B2) D F D (F&#x27;B) R&#x27; F2 R (F&#x27;B) U&#x27; F2 D (FB&#x27;) L&#x27; (F&#x27;B) D&#x27; <br>
(FB&#x27;) L (F&#x27;B) L2 (FB&#x27;) U2<br>
<br>
This solve was just my speedcubing method.  It was not a lucky case, <br>
I would say it was average.<br>
<br>
Step 1: Solve first four corners (this time on F):<br>
B2 L2 U2 B&#x27; U B U&#x27;<br>
<br>
Step 2: Solve center and three edges for first four corners (this <br>
time on B):<br>
F&#x27; (U&#x27;D) R&#x27; B&#x27; (U&#x27;D) (F2B2) (R<br>
<br>
Step3: Solve opposite corners (this time on F)(1 alg of 42):<br>
L&#x27;) U&#x27; F&#x27; U F L<br>
<br>
Step4: Solve three edges on second set of corners, and last edge on <br>
first set of corners:<br>
F2 U&#x27; (F2B2) D F D (F&#x27;B) R&#x27; F2 R (F&#x27;B) U&#x27;<br>
<br>
Step5: Solve last edge on second set of corners, and orient middle <br>
layer edges(1alg of 21):<br>
F2 D (FB&#x27;) L&#x27; (F&#x27;B) D&#x27; (FB&#x27;) L<br>
<br>
Step6: Position middle layer edges:<br>
(F&#x27;B) L2 (FB&#x27;) U2<br>
<br>
Step7: Smile, scramble, and repeat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pros for corners first:<br>
1. Corners take only 15 moves on average(13 for this case.)<br>
2. Lots of slice moves that can be executed lightning fast, saving <br>
other moves.<br>
3. Short solution (43 moves on this case.)<br>
<br>
Cons for corners first:<br>
1. Hard to get used to finding edges and placing them quickly.<br>
2. Lots of slice moves.  Slices are hard to get used to, but once <br>
mastered can be very fast, and can save moves!<br>
<br>
So what does everyone think?  Also am I the only one who thinks that <br>
slice moves should count as one move?  <br>
<br>
Have a nice day,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, I&#x27;m pretty tired right now; I just solved the 10x10x10 <br>
gliding cube in one sitting.  I only stopped once because someone set <br>
off the fire alarm in my building and I had to go outside for about <br>
15 minutes.  Anyway it took me 5 hours and 13 minutes.  Solving this <br>
10x10x10 cube was VERY different from solving a normal 10x10x10 <br>
cube.  It was much easier during the beginning, solving the first two <br>
centers was cake because I could slide the stickers around on one <br>
face to line them up.  However, as each center was finished it became <br>
a lot harder to solve each successive center.  I had to do some <br>
specialized moves to solve the last half of the last center, which <br>
took quite a while.  The edges were very easy compared to a 10x10x10 <br>
except for the last 4, which weren&#x27;t so much difficult just time <br>
consuming.  Basically what I did was to figure out a solution to the <br>
3x3x3 gliding cube, took about an hour, then I expanded it to the <br>
10x10x10.  My solution to the 3x3x3 is very likely not very <br>
efficient, so using it as the basis for my 10x10x10 solve is probably <br>
disugstingly inefficient.  I&#x27;m sure Richard could easily solve the <br>
10x10x10 in the cube root of my time :)  Anyway this cube was a LOT <br>
of fun, so much in fact that I did it in one sitting without getting <br>
bored.  Anyone who likes larger cubes I recommend you try this puzzle.<br>
<br>
If anyone else has the gliding cube program and would like to watch <br>
my 10x10x10 solution let me know and I&#x27;ll e-mail to you.  I don&#x27;t <br>
know if anyone is interested in sitting through several thousand <br>
moves on a gliding cube but hey just thought I&#x27;d offer :)<br>

Later everyone, I&#x27;m off to sleep now...... <br>

something like that. Anyway could you send me that solution? I&#x27;ll need
something to do after college finals when all I have left in my brain is
basic motor skills :). Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Just solved the 10x10x10 gliding cube


Hey everyone, I&#x27;m pretty tired right now; I just solved the 10x10x10 
gliding cube in one sitting.  I only stopped once because someone set 
off the fire alarm in my building and I had to go outside for about 
15 minutes.  Anyway it took me 5 hours and 13 minutes.  Solving this 
10x10x10 cube was VERY different from solving a normal 10x10x10 
cube.  It was much easier during the beginning, solving the first two 
centers was cake because I could slide the stickers around on one 
face to line them up.  However, as each center was finished it became 
a lot harder to solve each successive center.  I had to do some 
specialized moves to solve the last half of the last center, which 
took quite a while.  The edges were very easy compared to a 10x10x10 
except for the last 4, which weren&#x27;t so much difficult just time 
consuming.  Basically what I did was to figure out a solution to the 
3x3x3 gliding cube, took about an hour, then I expanded it to the 
10x10x10.  My solution to the 3x3x3 is very likely not very 
efficient, so using it as the basis for my 10x10x10 solve is probably 
disugstingly inefficient.  I&#x27;m sure Richard could easily solve the 
10x10x10 in the cube root of my time :)  Anyway this cube was a LOT 
of fun, so much in fact that I did it in one sitting without getting 
bored.  Anyone who likes larger cubes I recommend you try this puzzle.

If anyone else has the gliding cube program and would like to watch 
my 10x10x10 solution let me know and I&#x27;ll e-mail to you.  I don&#x27;t 
know if anyone is interested in sitting through several thousand 
moves on a gliding cube but hey just thought I&#x27;d offer :)

Later everyone, I&#x27;m off to sleep now...... 
very..........tired.................

          <div class="email-content">Personally I think the program is great!  The puzzle is a very cool 
idea and I think the program not only looks great but runs great 
too.  I guess my only real complaint is I was wondering during the 
10x10x10 solve if there is a way to cut corners on slice moves?  So 
if a slice is in the middle of spinning (normal move not sliding 
move) can I spin another slice while the first one is moving and the 
animation skips to the end for the first slice and the second one 
just starts spinning, to save time?  Or to make it easier can you 
make an option that allows you to turn the animation for spinning 
moves off, or an option to control the speed of how fast the slices 
spin?  That would save a lot of time when trying to do the larger 
puzzles.  Other than that I think the program is really cool and I 
like it a lot.

In the place where I live, there are no cubists at all. I nknow no 
one personally, who can solve the cube. They all whine that it&#x27;s &quot;too 
difficult.&quot; Oh yes, there is Grant, Jake and JUstin, but those are 
Inteenet friends. We have not yet met.

Cube art? Forget it. For the past few days I ince again went  to 
Google and once again I searched. Nothing new. As far as 3d cube art 
it&#x27;s zip, zilch, zero! Well, sorry I am the one doing 3d designs. The 
other two, Fred Holly (now deceased) and Jacob Davenport are doing 2d 
cube art. Is that all in this whole wide world? Please, help me look.

THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

          <div class="email-content">Ironically I just today thought of the layer-by-layer solution.  I&#x27;m <br>
in the process of recording another solution that will be MUCH <br>
shorter.  Basically what I did for the sliding 10x10x10 cube was to <br>
try to solve it the same way as I do the normal 10x10x10 cube (only <br>
adapted for the different features of the sliding cube).  My strategy <br>
was to solve two opposite centers simultaneously in rows.  Then once <br>
I get those two centers done I solved one other center, then <br>
another.  Then on a normal cube I solve the last two centers <br>
simultaneously, but here since the center pieces are also along the <br>
edges I had to solve the 5th center by itself, then the 6th center by <br>
itself.  The second half of the 6th center gave me some problems <br>
until I figured out how to go about it.  After that I found a way to <br>
put the edges together one half at a time and did the edges for the <br>
bottom row, then the corners for the bottom row.  Then I completed <br>
the 1st 9 layers (like F2L) by using sliding moves.  Then I used a <br>
really stupidly inefficient way to flip around the pieces of the top <br>
layer and move them to their correct spots.  I&#x27;ve done a lot of <br>
thinking and I see how to improve the speed of solving the last layer <br>
by a LOT and also I want to try the layer by layer solution.  Solving <br>
the centers I think could also be made to be pretty fast too, I&#x27;ll <br>
have to mess with this and see which way works better.  I&#x27;m trying a <br>
layer-by-layer solution have with my improved last layer and I&#x27;ll <br>
have that recorded pretty soon (the last layer might take around half <br>
the time my first solution took).  See <br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/20cube.html to see my normal <br>
solution to a larger cube.  I simply tried to adapt this solution to <br>
the sliding cube moves, which worked up until the last layer, which I <br>
hope my new way will be much better.<br>
<br>
Very cool puzzle by the way, I like it a lot :)<br>

I don&#x27;t either. Typically I am quite an ordinary person with the 
slowest average in the whole club. :-) But cube art is not 
speedcubing; different criteria apply here. For 3d cube art you need 
to undewrstand things that are considered very high math. Very 
recently I found out that parity pairs have something to do with 
chiral symmetry. I developed the concept on a very basic, elementary 
level but I can see the connection to chirality.

          <div class="email-content">Man this is all fascinating stuff.   I don&#x27;t care how fast it is, for a brand <br>
new puzzle with 1000 pieces of tiles, it is just amazing a strategy like your <br>
could be applied.  I have to admit though, the only algorithm I could mater <br>
on a Rubik&#x27;s Cube is a layered one, so I really did not know much :-)  Have <br>
you heard of a guy named Ton Dennenbroek?  He&#x27;s the one who first solved the <br>
3x3x3 GC.  He only used sliding moves with layed approach because he said <br>
it&#x27;d be too trivial if he used spin moves as well.  I still can&#x27;t see how.  <br>
Here is his website http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/.<br>
<br>
By the way I have a bad news, for some reason your solution file is not a <br>
finished one.  The cube is left about 95% done.  I can&#x27;t see why this <br>
happened.  All the recorded instructions were good ones, they were just cut <br>
short.  The solution, pattern and game file features should work, but <br>
currently they are not flexible enough.  In other words, the program it quite <br>
stupid in doing these things right now.  So, my recommendation is you use <br>
them very carefully.  Do not try to complicated operations like save, record, <br>
save, record...  etc...   Just save your pattern file before you are ready, <br>
click on &quot;Record&quot; button, then after you finished solving, click on &quot;Stop <br>
Recording&quot;, then save your solution.  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m very busy with my own work right now (still trying to make a living, you <br>
know), I will work on these issues soon.<br>

Yes I could implement the options for you to reduce graphics quality so that <br>
to speed up the moves.  There are tons of ways to improve speed.  But to be <br>
honest I did not think it was necessary because I thought it was a fiction <br>
that anyone would be able to do this puzzle at 10x10x10.<br>
<br>
Guess what?  A member in the World Rubik&#x27;s Game Championship asked me if I <br>
could do a 100x100x100 cube.  That&#x27;s 1,000,000 sub cubes to move around.  But <br>
I think it can be done and it will give you reasonable speed even on your 50 <br>
meg laptop.  It&#x27;s just that it will take me almost rewrite the rendering <br>
engine.  My optimization will come from the fact that a person can only see 3 <br>
faces of the cube at any time, and you also cannot see cubes that are hidden <br>
behind others.  That should cut the number of to be rendered objects by about <br>
90%.  However it will take some very tricky coding.  <br>
<br>
Spinning multiple sliecs at the same time is an intrigueing idea.  It isn&#x27;t <br>
easy for me because of the way I implemented my code.  But it definitely <br>
could be done.   <br>
However it will not increase performance whatsoever in your case because when <br>
a slice is struggling with spinning it&#x27;s taking up all the CPU resources.  <br>
Spinning another slice will just cut the speed of your current one by half.  <br>
So in all you still get the same speed.  When there still head room in CPU <br>
power doing multiple spinning does help you.  I will think about it.<br>

&gt; Personally I think the program is great!  The puzzle is a very cool <br>

&gt; 10x10x10 solve if there is a way to cut corners on slice moves?  So <br>
&gt; if a slice is in the middle of spinning (normal move not sliding <br>
&gt; move) can I spin another slice while the first one is moving and the <br>
&gt; animation skips to the end for the first slice and the second one <br>
&gt; just starts spinning, to save time?  Or to make it easier can you <br>
&gt; make an option that allows you to turn the animation for spinning <br>
&gt; moves off, or an option to control the speed of how fast the slices <br>
&gt; spin?  That would save a lot of time when trying to do the larger <br>

<br>
Whoa, I didn&#x27;t realize that those simple suggestions would take so <br>
much work.  I guess would it be easier just to add a toggle switch <br>
for the animation?  So that on the larger cubes, dragging a face will <br>
simply result in the sliding move or normal move having already been <br>
performed after you let go of the mouse button, rather than watching <br>
the animation of it happening?<br>
<br>
By the way I just did the 10x10x10 cube using a layer-by-layer <br>
approach, the solution file is maybe a little over half the size of <br>
my original one, so it is much shorter.  I&#x27;m still not sure if doing <br>
a layer by layer approach is faster than doing all the centers first, <br>
then the edges.  I&#x27;ll practice both for a while and then take some <br>
times to find out.  Solving layer-by-layer has a lot of long sliding <br>
move sequences, whereas solving the centers adds a lot of <br>
restrictions on the last center.  Maybe they both balance out, but I <br>
have a feeling one is probably a good deal faster than the other.  <br>
Has anyone else attempted this puzzle?  Are there any other <br>
strategies for ways to do this puzzle?<br>
<br>
If anyone wants the shorter solution file let me know, it will <br>
probably take a lot less time to play back.  Also I didn&#x27;t do <br>
anything extra other than just hit record solution then stop solution <br>
when I was done.  I didn&#x27;t really time myself very accurately, but <br>
I&#x27;d say it might have taken maybe 2 1/2 hours or so, maybe 3 hours.  <br>
I think there might be a good way to combine parts of the layer-by-<br>
layer approach with the solving centers first approach.  Anyway I&#x27;m <br>
still very interested in this puzzle and want to try to work on an <br>
efficient solution.<br>
<br>
Later all,<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s a pretty good site. Needs work, of course. I like the part on 
the instructions page where it says:
Step 1: Make a cross on top of the cube
Step 2: Put jack under car
LOL
I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re using an automatic website maker, right? If I 
were you, I would learn HTML. You can make better sites. If you&#x27;re 
interested in learning it, go to www.htmlgoodies.com or to 
www.larissaexplains.com. Those tw oare my favorite HTML help pages.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine,

   I was in my 30&#x27;s when I started.

   I noted at the time that those who thought they could solve it
solved it, and that those who thought they couldn&#x27;t solve it didn&#x27;t.
In general the older the person was the less he or she believed they
could solve it. There were exceptions of course. I think there was a
fellow in his sixties at the world championship round at Magic
Mountain in 1981.

   I think the interest may be there at any age, but the deciding
factor may be faith in oneself...

          <div class="email-content">i agree that it is not so much as the age thing in learning to solve <br>
a cube than it is a mental thing... when i started i was 24 and i <br>
had it in my mind that i could solve it in a minute so i learned to <br>
do it... then i told myself i&#x27;ve gone this far i can do it in 50 <br>
seconds... i did that with the doubt that i would ever get under <br>
40.... well so on and so on... i set new goals everytime i reach the <br>
old one... i&#x27;ve been cubing a little over a year and i&#x27;m down to 24 <br>
seconds pb and 32.6 average... shooting to break 20 and 30 in each <br>
division....<br>

    How do you guys solve it? Is layer-by-layer best? If so, do you just solve the last layer logically, or are there some algorithms out there that could help me out?<br>

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Just solved the 10x10x10 gliding cube


Hey everyone, I&#x27;m pretty tired right now; I just solved the 10x10x10 
gliding cube in one sitting.  I only stopped once because someone set 
off the fire alarm in my building and I had to go outside for about 
15 minutes.  Anyway it took me 5 hours and 13 minutes.  Solving this 
10x10x10 cube was VERY different from solving a normal 10x10x10 
cube.  It was much easier during the beginning, solving the first two 
centers was cake because I could slide the stickers around on one 
face to line them up.  However, as each center was finished it became 
a lot harder to solve each successive center.  I had to do some 
specialized moves to solve the last half of the last center, which 
took quite a while.  The edges were very easy compared to a 10x10x10 
except for the last 4, which weren&#x27;t so much difficult just time 
consuming.  Basically what I did was to figure out a solution to the 
3x3x3 gliding cube, took about an hour, then I expanded it to the 
10x10x10.  My solution to the 3x3x3 is very likely not very 
efficient, so using it as the basis for my 10x10x10 solve is probably 
disugstingly inefficient.  I&#x27;m sure Richard could easily solve the 
10x10x10 in the cube root of my time :)  Anyway this cube was a LOT 
of fun, so much in fact that I did it in one sitting without getting 
bored.  Anyone who likes larger cubes I recommend you try this puzzle.

If anyone else has the gliding cube program and would like to watch 
my 10x10x10 solution let me know and I&#x27;ll e-mail to you.  I don&#x27;t 
know if anyone is interested in sitting through several thousand 
moves on a gliding cube but hey just thought I&#x27;d offer :)

Later everyone, I&#x27;m off to sleep now...... 
very..........tired.................

    Chris, I wanted to see your algorithm for this to see if it was the same as mine, but the link on the website was dead. <br>
    Like I said, I solved it in a pretty basic way, but I still feel pretty smart for figuring out that algorithm lol. -- and to finally solve that thing. It&#x27;s about 4:30 am. Think I&#x27;ll try to get some sleep now, before I get started on a 4x4x4.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Jasmine,

I too was older when I first solved a cube.  Of course, that was 
because I was 28 when they became available in my area for the first 
time.  I agree that belief in your ability to solve them is 
important.  Many people tried them at the height of the initial 
cubing craze with no success.  So many of the people who remember 
this period became convinced either that solving them was impossible, 
or required the solver to be a genius.  These people are essentially 
permanently &quot;innoculated&quot; from picking up the cubing &quot;bug&quot;.  And of 
course there was no internet available to share solutions, provide 
encouragement, or even to estimate how many people had been 
successful.

To Chris, I have received a few emails asking me to post your center approach solution.  I did not post it because it was unfinished.  If you want to finish it I can send you the pattern file where the puzzle was left at, and I will stitch together the two solution files to make it complete.  If you are tired of it by now, I would just post it as is, which is still amazing to watch.<br>

center approach solution.  I did not post it because it was <br>
unfinished.  If you want to finish it I can send you the pattern file <br>
where the puzzle was left at, and I will stitch together the two <br>
solution files to make it complete.  If you are tired of it by now, I <br>
would just post it as is, which is still amazing to watch.<br>

&gt; &gt; Well, I just solved that gliding cube (3x3x3), so I guess I don&#x27;t <br>
need any help afterall. It was a really simple way of solving it <br>
though, but I did figure out an algorithm to switch two tiles. <br>
Actually, it switches three, but if you do it a few times with a <br>
couple of extra moves thrown in, you can make it just switch two. <br>
&gt; &gt;    Chris, I wanted to see your algorithm for this to see if it <br>
was the same as mine, but the link on the website was dead. <br>
&gt; &gt;    Like I said, I solved it in a pretty basic way, but I still <br>
feel pretty smart for figuring out that algorithm lol. -- and to <br>
finally solve that thing. It&#x27;s about 4:30 am. Think I&#x27;ll try to get <br>
some sleep now, before I get started on a 4x4x4.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all you math people I have a question.  I&#x27;ve been thinking about <br>
the number of combinations to the gliding cube in various forms, and <br>
I wanted to write and see if I&#x27;m on the right track.  For the normal <br>
gliding cube, with stickers and looks just like a rubik&#x27;s cube when <br>
solved, I think it has 54!/(9!)^6 combinations.  This is because you <br>
can use a move to switch three tiles, and if you include two tiles of <br>
the same color it appears as if you&#x27;ve switched only two.  So any <br>
position of the stickers is allowable, thus the 54!, and then <br>
dividing by (9!)^6 accounts for the fact that the nine stickers of <br>
each color are indistinguishable from eachother, so you have to <br>
divide out all possible permutations the stickers of the same colors <br>
can have with each other, 6 sets of 9 stickers.<br>
<br>
For the gliding cube that has pictures or numbers on each sticker, so <br>
that every one is distinguishable from every other, I think it has <br>
54!/2! combinations.  This accounts for the fact that you permute 52 <br>
of the pieces, then because you can only switch three at a time, the <br>
positions of the last two stickers are already decided after <br>
permuting the first 52 stickers.  This is where I have a problem.  I <br>
don&#x27;t know for sure whether or not it actually is impossible to <br>
switch just two stickers.  It seems like that would be impossible <br>
given the nature of the cube shape and the normal cube puzzle, but <br>
without a proof I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very smart to just make the <br>
assumption that this is true.  Can you inded switch the positions of <br>
only two stickers using the movement rules of the gliding cube or is <br>
it limited to 3 or more, which would mean that 54!/2! would be the <br>
number of combinations?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m still working on finding a group theory book, I looked around at <br>
the school library and found one that lightly grazed over the theory <br>
of the cube, but it didn&#x27;t really go into much depth, so I decided to <br>
keep looking.  You guys have me interested in trying to find a book <br>
and learning it though.<br>
<br>
If I could get some help with these questions though, that would be <br>
great.  I think the first one part is right, but I&#x27;m not sure about <br>
my answer for the gliding cube with pictures or numbers.<br>
<br>
Anyway thanks for the help for anyone who answers.<br>

In order to lube your cube, you must have a wholey silicon based 
lubricant spray.  I use SNAP silicon spray.  Remove one piece from 
the rubik&#x27;s cube, and either spray a little in the whole of the 
cube, or on the one piece that you are holding.  Then insert the 
piece back into the cube, and play with it for a few seconds just to 
spread the lube around.  Wait 10 or so minutes for the lube to dry, 
then you are ready to go.

          <div class="email-content">Fairly interesting I think is how my cube got lubed.<br>
<br>
First I used some sort of lubricant. I do not know the name. Next I used vaseline... that works OK. I used silcone. None of the lubricants worked very well for weeks.. my cube still did not turn very well. Then, just the other day I left the cube on the car dashboard with the sun shining on it. I came back a few hours and noticed my cube was hotter than hell. I let it cool down (trook about 20 minutes). I turned the faces and noticed how well they turned. Also, all the solicone and stuff was all over in the inside. I guess since the last time I cleaned out my cube I did not get all the lubricants out. Oh Well!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I feel the same way chris.  If I leave a cube unsolved, it does kind of bug 
me until I solve it.  Probably not exactly a good sign, but still.  
Especially if it&#x27;s just the LL that&#x27;s unsolved, that really bugs me.  One 
time, during a lab group, one of the members of my group had a cube in his 
dorm.  About half an hour after lab, which we had held in his room that day, 
called me and asked me if I had solved his cube.  But I didn&#x27;t remember 
doing it.  I remember noticing it was scrambled, but I don&#x27;t think I picked 
it up.  But nobody else in my group can do the cube, so it must&#x27;ve been me.  
That was kinda freaky.  Feel like I&#x27;ve lost a little control over my body :) 
or maybe my mind...

Im alot like Chis H. here.  Most the time my cube is left solved.  
When im tryin to do homework i have to take my cubes somewhere else, 
or i&#x27;ll keep messing with the cubes. lol

   Well I tried your sliding cube, and I like it.<br>

   I guess I may be the fourth person to solve it. It was the first<br>
virtual cube I ever tried, but I finally got used to the commands. I<br>
thought I had recorded my solution, but apparently I hadn&#x27;t, so you<br>

<br>
   You must sit down and solve it. Get yourself a pile of snackfood<br>
fopr energy and just do it. Believe me if you can program it you can<br>
solve it. <br>
<br>
   I&#x27;ve figured a way to make this cube physically, and I&#x27;m trying to<br>

  I&#x27;ll try to post you a solution tomorrow.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris, Your formula for the normal GC looks correct to me.  Has anyone of you <br>
got a sense of how big this number is?   That is roughly 10^38.  According to <br>
the official Rubik&#x27;s Cube facts page http://www.rubiks.com/cubefacts.html , a <br>
3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube has a total of 4.3*10^19 configurations.  So the GC has <br>
more than 2.5*10^18 times the total configurations of the RC!  But isn&#x27;t it <br>
ironic that GC is actually easier to solve?<br>
<br>
Sorry obviously I can&#x27;t help you with your problem for the &quot;tagged&quot; cube.  I <br>
think it would be helpful if you could have an actual tagged GC in front of <br>
you.  I will be working on that soon.  Meanwhile if you are looking for help <br>
with theories, you might find this website interesting : <br>

&gt; Hey all you math people I have a question.  I&#x27;ve been thinking about <br>
&gt; the number of combinations to the gliding cube in various forms, and <br>
&gt; I wanted to write and see if I&#x27;m on the right track.  For the normal <br>
&gt; gliding cube, with stickers and looks just like a rubik&#x27;s cube when <br>
&gt; solved, I think it has 54!/(9!)^6 combinations.  This is because you <br>
&gt; can use a move to switch three tiles, and if you include two tiles of <br>
&gt; the same color it appears as if you&#x27;ve switched only two.  So any <br>
&gt; position of the stickers is allowable, thus the 54!, and then <br>
&gt; dividing by (9!)^6 accounts for the fact that the nine stickers of <br>
&gt; each color are indistinguishable from eachother, so you have to <br>
&gt; divide out all possible permutations the stickers of the same colors <br>
&gt; can have with each other, 6 sets of 9 stickers.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For the gliding cube that has pictures or numbers on each sticker, so <br>
&gt; that every one is distinguishable from every other, I think it has <br>
&gt; 54!/2! combinations.  This accounts for the fact that you permute 52 <br>
&gt; of the pieces, then because you can only switch three at a time, the <br>
&gt; positions of the last two stickers are already decided after <br>
&gt; permuting the first 52 stickers.  This is where I have a problem.  I <br>
&gt; don&#x27;t know for sure whether or not it actually is impossible to <br>
&gt; switch just two stickers.  It seems like that would be impossible <br>
&gt; given the nature of the cube shape and the normal cube puzzle, but <br>
&gt; without a proof I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very smart to just make the <br>
&gt; assumption that this is true.  Can you inded switch the positions of <br>
&gt; only two stickers using the movement rules of the gliding cube or is <br>
&gt; it limited to 3 or more, which would mean that 54!/2! would be the <br>
&gt; number of combinations?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m still working on finding a group theory book, I looked around at <br>
&gt; the school library and found one that lightly grazed over the theory <br>
&gt; of the cube, but it didn&#x27;t really go into much depth, so I decided to <br>
&gt; keep looking.  You guys have me interested in trying to find a book <br>
&gt; and learning it though.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If I could get some help with these questions though, that would be <br>
&gt; great.  I think the first one part is right, but I&#x27;m not sure about <br>
&gt; my answer for the gliding cube with pictures or numbers.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyway thanks for the help for anyone who answers.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Solved the Gliding Cube also today. Tried out the 3x3x3 to get 
warmed up and then went straight for the 10x10x10, it took about 5 
hours. It was interesting to solve the last center. The edges were 
fun to do. I turned it into a 3x3x3 but then kept making stupid 
errors. (due to the lack of resposiveness of the controls.) About 
1/3 of my solving time was watching the animation of the turns, 
that&#x27;s very annoying. (I used a method that I would imagine uses 
more mechanical turns and less sliding then most methods.) There 
needs to be a toggle switch to speed that up. BTW a warning and 
notice for the creator of the game: If during an animated turn, you 
change zoom, the cube resets to the PREVIOUS state before the move 
even if it is almost complete. That screwed me up a few times at the 
end and probably added 20 minutes to my time. I had everything done 
except for one corner, which takes at most 4 &quot;glides&quot; (a hint for 
those out there yet to solve one) and some twists. Since it&#x27;s been a 
while since I posted, here&#x27;s an update... I&#x27;m averaging about 23s 
now (on the non-gliding cube :-))!

          <div class="email-content">My earlier post was in reference to the 3x3x3 gc, but I just tackled the 10x10x10 and it took roughly 1 hour 50 minutes.  straight through.  My computer was compressing divx at the same time though, so it lagged a bit when it turned.  I didn&#x27;t record my solution though, I wanted a warm up run to see how much more difficult than the 3x3x3 it would be.  Not much, just more tedious.  I&#x27;ll record a solution tomorrow, or later tonight if I get bored :)

Cheers all!

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: GC solved


  Solved the Gliding Cube also today. Tried out the 3x3x3 to get 
  warmed up and then went straight for the 10x10x10, it took about 5 
  hours. It was interesting to solve the last center. The edges were 
  fun to do. I turned it into a 3x3x3 but then kept making stupid 
  errors. (due to the lack of resposiveness of the controls.) About 
  1/3 of my solving time was watching the animation of the turns, 
  that&#x27;s very annoying. (I used a method that I would imagine uses 
  more mechanical turns and less sliding then most methods.) There 
  needs to be a toggle switch to speed that up. BTW a warning and 
  notice for the creator of the game: If during an animated turn, you 
  change zoom, the cube resets to the PREVIOUS state before the move 
  even if it is almost complete. That screwed me up a few times at the 
  end and probably added 20 minutes to my time. I had everything done 
  except for one corner, which takes at most 4 &quot;glides&quot; (a hint for 
  those out there yet to solve one) and some twists. Since it&#x27;s been a 
  while since I posted, here&#x27;s an update... I&#x27;m averaging about 23s 
  now (on the non-gliding cube :-))!

          <div class="email-content">Well not actually a mod, as much a different way to play.  When using the 3x3x3 GC try to scramble and solve while keeping the center tiles stationary.  That is only do moves and slides of the fbudlr group, no m&#x27;s.  Does that make sense?<br>
<br>
That is don&#x27;t mix or solve by sliding the middle slices.  Just the outer ones, that way the center tiles are always in the same place relative to each other, like in a regular cube.  This makes it much more difficult, IMHO.  the first two layers are quite simple, but the LL is a fun challenge.<br>

Let me know what you think!<br>

<br>
I agree.<br>
<br>
&gt; that every one is distinguishable from every other, I think it has <br>
&gt; 54!/2! combinations.<br>
<br>
I think it is 54! if the tiles are distinguishable, no visible <br>
orientations. A glide move is a 12-cycle, which is an odd <br>
permutation. You can swap 2 tiles by doing a single glide move and <br>
solving it again. This is similar to a 4x4x4 cube where you can fix <br>
edge parity by doing a slice move and then solving the centres and <br>
edges again.<br>
<br>
If you include orientations of the tiles, then I think all 4^54 <br>
orientations are possible. If you turn a face, and then undo the side <br>
tiles with 3 glide moves, then you will have rotated 9 tiles a <br>
quarter turn. This is an odd number. It is already known that it is <br>
possible to give two tiles a quarter turn on the normal Rubik&#x27;s cube <br>
(and therefore on the gliding cube ANY two tiles can be given a <br>
quarter turn). By combining this it should be possible to give a <br>
single tile a quarter turn.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if things are any different when you restrict yourself <br>
to only glide moves.<br>
<br>
&gt; I&#x27;m still working on finding a group theory book,<br>
<br>
If you want pure math, any good book on Algebra will have a group <br>
theory in it. If you want group theory as applied to puzzles, then <br>
take a look at this recent book:<br>
<br>
1. &quot;Adventures in Group Theory&quot; by David Joyner.<br>
Available from good academic bookshops, or amazon. Second edition is <br>
in preparation. If you get the first edition, do check on David&#x27;s <br>
homepage for the (many) errata of the book.<br>
<br>
or these older books:<br>
<br>
2. &quot;Cubik Math&quot; by Singmaster and Frey (available from David <br>
Singmaster directly)<br>
<br>
3. &quot;Notes on the Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;(5th edition) by David Singmaster (out <br>
of print, fairly hard to find)<br>
<br>
4. &quot;Inside Rubik&#x27;s Cube and Beyond&quot; by Christoph Bandelow (out of <br>
print. German version probably still available from the author, <br>
english version very hard to find).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
Per request from users I have updated the Gliding Cube software.   Most of <br>
the changes are for advanced players who would like to play with very high <br>
dimensions.  You don&#x27;t have to delete your current program since the new one <br>
will just install over it.  Your program&#x27;s registration status will not be <br>
affected.  In other words, if you have registered your program it will remain <br>
registered, otherwise you still have the same number of remaining free runs.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Changes include:<br>
1. Added an option to reduce animation quality.   If you turn on this mode, <br>
spin moves will not be animated, slide moves will only take one middle step.  <br>
I found slide moves could become very confusing if there is no animation at <br>
all, having just one middle step makes it a lot clearer, and it does not take <br>
much time.  <br>
<br>
2. As a result of change 1, I increased the maximum dimension to 20x20x20.   <br>
I think when running in reduced animation mode the game is still very much <br>
playable in this dimension on most decent machines.  <br>
<br>
3. Added text to indicate the number of recorded steps.   This just makes <br>
recording puzzle solvings more interesting.  <br>
<br>
4. Improved the solution file saving code.  Before the solution file could <br>
only be saved once.  If you continue to record you will lose the history <br>
before the first save.  In the new program you can save your solutions over <br>
and over to the same file, no history will be lost.<br>
<br>
Later on I will put these updates to my own web page.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

I think 54!/(9!)^6 is too high. In the set you describe, you&#x27;ll find
cubes you can consider identical, because they&#x27;ll only differ by
rotations of the whole cube (ok, they won&#x27;t be technically identical,
but there&#x27;s no difference if orientation is free).

just HAVE to pick it up and solve it again wouldn&#x27;t you!!&quot; They know 
it&#x27;s true, so they mess it and then I have to fix it again! :

I said in my previous post. I actually always leave it in an ordered <br>

in the checkerboard pattern or some other pattern.<br>
<br>
Like Ping, I also sometimes leave it in a pattern if it&#x27;s on my desk <br>
at work. My thinking was that if I leave it in a pattern then that&#x27;s <br>
more interesting because it suggests that I can cube. If I leave it <br>
messed then people might think that I just don&#x27;t know how to solve it <br>
(unless they already know I&#x27;m a cuber), if I leave it solved then it <br>
could well have just come out of the box that way. So yeah, Ping, <br>
looks like we had the same idea! :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not too fussed about other people touching my good speedcube -- 
as long as it doesn&#x27;t leave my sight. I want to make sure they don&#x27;t 
do anything stupid like pull the stickers off or pull it apart and 
accidentally damaged it -- I&#x27;d be REALLY UNIMPRESSED!

When I found a really good cube (the best I&#x27;ve ever had in 15 years 
of cubing) I went back to the store and bought spares (3 cubes in 
total) so if something did happen to it I&#x27;ve got more.

If I&#x27;m demonstrating, I actually tend to give the cube to someone 
else to scramble. I kinda think it makes it more fun for the observer 
if they get to be part of the demonstration.

hey chris (or anyone else i guess...i just say chris cause i&#x27;m going <br>
to refer to his pge, but i&#x27;m sure other people can probably help of <br>

<br>
when i solve my 4x4, i almost always seem to end up with a parity <br>
problem. specifically, the one where a single edge pair if flipped. <br>
now i love doing that 150 move algorithm to fix that as much as the <br>
next guy, but i seem to remember somewhere in your pages you <br>
mentioning there&#x27;s a way to avoid that early on in the solution. it&#x27;s <br>
been a long time since i&#x27;ve glanced thru your pages, but i&#x27;m pretty <br>
sure you said that.<br>
<br>
so, is there anyway to avoid this?<br>

Brayden,
     Yes, yes, I think all of us have been there at one point or 
another.... that blasted 2x2....  Unfortunately there&#x27;s not MUCH you 
can do.  The 2x2 is a surprisingly complex mechanism, and to 
reassemble it back to perfectly functioning order usually proves to 
be an effort in futility.  At this point, I would recommend saving up 
another $6 dollars and buying a new one.  Tinker around with the old 
one, but be careful, as this tinkering is exactly what broke my first 
2x2 beyond recognition.  Good luck with your future cubing!

Chris

   Nevermind dropping the cube, what if you took over 41 seconds to
solve it?

Hey Everyone!

I hope you are all doing well.  I just wanted to let you know that on 
Sunday, May 4th, I managed to speed-solve a cube during freefall!  
While falling at approximately 130 Miles per hour (209 km per hour), 
it took me 32 seconds, with only 8 seconds remaining until we had to 
open the chute.  The hardest part was dealing with the wind.

It was my first time skydiving, but I wasn&#x27;t nervous because I was 
concentrating on the cube!  hahaaaaa.  I have a video of it, and

          <div class="email-content">I have another unrelated point:<br>
<br>
I was just using Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer, and I realized that it&#x27;s using <br>
what I call a &quot;rolling average&quot;.  This means you can select ANY 12 <br>
consecutive times for your average.  I used to do this in 1999, until <br>
Mirek Goljan told me it was a BIG NO-NO.  In order to consider an <br>
average as a personal record, here is my simple criterium:  <br>
<br>
&quot;You must decide BEFORE you start the first time in the average that <br>
you are going to do an average.&quot;<br>
<br>
This means that if you&#x27;re doing an average of 12 times, and partway <br>
through you realize you&#x27;d rather start counting the average on your <br>
3rd time, you are not allowed to do it.  Technically you are allowed <br>
to stop in the middle of an average and start a new one whenever you <br>
want, as long as you follow the above rule.  We are trying to <br>
simulate competition standards when obtaining personal averages.<br>
<br>
Does anyone still use the &quot;rolling average&quot;?  What are people&#x27;s <br>
thoughts about this?<br>

Sunes (three corner twist) with a sticker move at first and then <br>
backwards after the two Sunes. Would you put it up on your site or <br>
something Chris? Well anyway if you haven&#x27;t tried this I think you <br>
should!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;d say that I use &quot;rolling&quot; averages about half the time.  I only 
recently started using rolling averages, maybe within the last year.  
I guess when I first started doing them I sorted of considered 
it &quot;cheating&quot; yet most people I had heard defined an average as 12 
consecutive times so after a while I didn&#x27;t think much of it.  I 
think an average is more &quot;intense&quot; if it is done as an average, (i.e. 
record 12 times and no matter what, your average is the average of 
those twelve times, not 13 times and your average is the average of 
the last twelve).  I guess I still sort of consider a rolling average 
cheating in a way, yet it doesn&#x27;t seem to break any rules since you 
are still recording 12 consecutive times.  I guess it would be better 
training for competitions and the mental aspects of knowing you have 
to get a fast time if you only allowed yourself the 12 times of an 
average, not just take 25 times and average the fastest consecutive 
12.  I guess I think they both are legitimate averages, but that the 
normal average of 12 is purer in a sense, if that makes any sense at 
all.

just my two cents,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">I actually was thinking about this not too long ago and asked someone about it but I didn&#x27;t get any feedback.  After that I decided that I wouldnt use a rolling average until just the other day I noticed Lars Petrus&#x27;s screen shot of his latest average and it looked as if he was using a rolling average to count as his personal best.  So after that I figured it was okay and have been using it ever since.  I also just got my best average of 12 with the rolling average method.  <br>
<br>
Now after reading your email I agree with you, I think it makes sense to do averages that way if you want them to count as your personal record.  <br>

<br>
If we are talking about the Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 then I am sorry Chris but <br>
you are mistaken!  After much time one can figure it out.  Notice <br>
there are two pie pieces that are different and larger, and mine has <br>
one that is in-between.  Also there are three prongs that do not <br>
twist.  What you do is you put the two long pie pieces in one cubie, <br>
and also put the medium size pie piece in that cubie.  Then wedge <br>
that cubie in-between the three prongs that do not twist.  Then <br>
continue to put the puzzle together.  Then at the end the trick is to <br>
push HARD!!!  Kind of push hard and up at the same time.  Reply if <br>
you get it back together and save your $6!<br>

If you have a flashlight it might help, but if you look into the 
cubies, on every one of mine there are two deep slots and one shallow 
one.  As long as the two long pie pieces are in the deep slots and 
the medium pie piece in the shallow slot, all on the same cubie, you 
should be fine.  
Hope this helps.

Are you sure that you put the three larger pie pieces in one cubie, 
and are you sure that you then wedged that cubie in-between the three 
prongs that do not spin?  If you indeed did that, it should work, or 
we have different cubes.

I hope you get it.

I have never picked up a 2x2x2 cube before but I already know how to solve it. Here is what I would do (and I am sure everyone else does this): Solve the top layer, permutate the corners, orient the corners.<br>
<br>
I assume you know how to do all the algorithms. Look at it this way: the 2x2 is a 3x3 without the edges and centers.<br>

Look into the photos section under fix your 2x2x2.

The third picture is the one you are having trouble with.  The 
picture is called First.  You can put the large pie pieces in any 
cubie, as long as they are all in one cubie.  Then put that cubie in 
between the three non-twisting prongs and you are home free.

Hope you get it!

Subject: [Speed cubing group] A Cube At Rest...
 

hey all.
nothing important here by any means, i&#x27;m just wondering if people 
have a preferred or usual way of keeping their cube. i mean if it&#x27;s 
just sitting there, minding it&#x27;s own business, is it usually solved 
or mixed. do you feel a &quot;need&quot; to have it solved when your done, or 
is it fine if it&#x27;s just mixed and sitting there.

just curious.

          <div class="email-content">Although I really do understand how most of you prefer to leave your 
cubes in the solved state, I must confess that in my house the rule 
is &quot;If you find a scrambled cube, don&#x27;t touch it.  If it&#x27;s solved, 
feel free to play with it.&quot;  The reason is this:  When someone is 
learning blindfold cubing, there are really two skills that must be 
mastered.  (1) Being able to remember how the cube is scrambled, and 
(2) For a given scramble, executing the moves required to solve it 
without looking.  Clearly skill #1 must be mastered before #2.  And 
the best way to be very certain that you have really memorized a cube 
is to put it down for a time, go do something else, then return to 
see how well you remember it.  Also, when you are working on skill 
#2, there are times when you find yourself in new situations, for 
which you must develop a new approach, and this takes time.  Hence 
the rule.  

Besides, consider the other 43,252,003,274,489,855,999 possible cube 
states other than solved.  Assuming that the cube is totally 
scrambled, then it is extremely likely that no other cube on earth 
has ever been in this exact state.  I for one would like to get to 
know each scramble in some detail before I destroy it by solving my 
cube once again.

Hi Lars!

I agree.  I would rather do rolling averages, because they are easier 
and more fun, so maybe I will start doing them in the future. It&#x27;s 
a little frustrating, because if I had been using rolling 
averages I think my best would have been 17.1 instead of 17.3, but no 
biggie - I have to beat it anyway!  haha.

          <div class="email-content">I find it ironic that all the people on this list can solve a 
rubik&#x27;s cube and many of them can do it astonoshingly fast and work  
very hard yet would rather waste money a new 2x2 rather than fix it. 
Someone was playing with my 2x2 an took it apart after seeing me 
take apart my 3x3. Putting it back together was a puzzle all in 
itself and was as fun as solving it. I discovered that the 2 big pie 
pieces had to go in the same cubie and the stationary prongs had to 
go around that but the notched piece I put somewhere else and it 
doesn&#x27;t seem to matter where it goes. Does anyone know what that 
notch is for any way?

guess that they probably wanted to make all of the cubies alike, so <br>
then they made every cubie with two deep and one shallow.  So then <br>
they could not have three large pie pieces, but only two, and one <br>
medium sized.  Do I make sense?  Does anyone know if I am right?<br>

          <div class="email-content">The 2 large and the one with the notch all go in one cubie to lock 
the kernal in place so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck at a diagonal inside the 
cube making it impossible to turn.  The reason one has a notch in it 
is because of molding inside the cubie.  If you look inside the cubie 
you&#x27;ll see a bump in it.  I hope this makes sense

of a tagged GC.   We forgot one important fact: tiles cannot change <br>
orientation when only one type of move is used, but they will change <br>

tile, no matter you use spin or slide, when this tile comes back to its <br>
original position, the mark always remain the same ^ .  But if you use mixed <br>
moves, when the tile comes back, it could become &lt;, &gt;, v, or ^  !   I think a <br>

          <div class="email-content">Just did the 10x10x10 GC cube using a centers approach.  Took 
1hr:18min:27sec to solve it and 3400 something moves, I forgot to 
write it down but it was something around there.  I&#x27;m still learning 
a lot about how to handle each step and I had to take several times 
to stop and think about how to continue.  I still need to work on 
this, Grant I can never seem to solve these larger puzzles in a few 
moves as you or Richard :)  Maybe one day heh heh.  Anyway this is a 
very cool puzzle.  Some day I&#x27;ll tackle the 20x20x20 but my brain is 
kinda fried right now.  I recorded the solution if anyone is 
interested in seeing it.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
    I am in the puzzle market and some puzzles just don&#x27;t seem too fun to me.  I am definately getting:<br>
Megaminx<br>
Pocket Cube<br>
Pyramix<br>
Bart Cube (I love the simpsons and have a homer cube already)<br>
<br>
Just making sure there is nothing from either Mefferts or Rubik&#x27;s that I need to get, the &quot;must have&quot; puzzles.  I have:<br>
5x5x5<br>
4x4x4<br>
3x3x3<br>
square-1<br>
Instant Insanity<br>
Home-made texture 3x3x3<br>
Walgreens picture cube (with pictures of my lady on it)<br>
<br>
any suggestions on other puzzles I would like, please let me know.<br>
<br>
Now for the other part of the topic.  I would like good java/any other language simulations of puzzles.  Oinkleburger has the most favored cube simulation as I understand it, and I like that one.  But are there any java simulations or other programs for the megaminx, pyraminx, rubiks barrel, pyramorphix or so on?  I ask because I ran into a very very poorly done simulation of the rubiks barrel, and I have to say it was more fun than I imagined and I might end up buying one now.  I would like other &quot;try before you buy&quot; things like this.  Any suggestions are welcome!<br>
<br>
Cheers all,<br>

   If a tile slides from the Up face to the Back face to the Left Face

You must realize that I am a multi-cube designer. I use all those 
cubes to construct three dimensional, sculpture-like designs. Look in 
http://cube.misto.cz . I have found only 2 other multi-cube designers 
on the web, they create two dimensional, picture-like designs. I may 
be the only one to do  &quot;sculptures.&quot; if you can find anyone doing 
that, please let me know. Thank you.

I also found this site: http://byrden.com/puzzles/ which has several java puzzles.  The only problem here is it is almost impossible to figure out how to get an entire puzzle rotation to happen and it is almost impossible to get the correct slice to move on anything other than a cube shaped puzzle.  The megaminx gave me a headache here just because the control scheme was so very very very terrible.<br>

  can try all sorts of different puzzles, including all the puzzles <br>
  that you mentioned.<br>
<br>
  This isn&#x27;t entirely try before you buy, but for the initial purchase <br>
  you can try all the other puzzles before you buy, and you can figure <br>
  out which puzzles you might like to actually own in physical form.  <br>
  The current version has 43 different puzzles available, and they are <br>
  listed at http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/features.html .  For general <br>
  Puzzler information or to download it, go to <br>

Your experience in those cube simulator software is very typical.  It 
is actually very difficult to manipulate a 3D puzzle on a computer

develop a good algorithm that makes the puzzle spin and twist exactly

trying to sell my program, but do you have any control problems when 
playing the GC puzzle?  Unfortunately most all of the cube puzzle 
simulation software out there (be it Java, C++) did not implement the 
correct algorithm.  It has even created an impression among some 
puzzle designers that that virtual cubing is not possible ( 
http://www.scottkim.com/thinkinggames/fromphysicaltocomputer/index.htm
l ).  While it is impossible to make up 100% for the missing of a 
physical object, virtual cubing certainly has its advantages, such as 
auto undo, redo, save, playback etc.  So a well designed virtul 3D 
puzzle should have its own place.

By the way, as a 3D game developer myself, I kept wondering why 
Oinkleburger&#x27;s 2D Rubik&#x27;s Cube Java software is so popular.  Could 
you cubists care to explain?

          <div class="email-content">I came up with an alg that flips the orientations of two stickers on 
the same corner, so it is possible to flip just two stickers.  The 
two have to flip opposite directions.  The catch is that it also 
switches 6 other stickers around (2 separate cycles of 3).  The U 
sticker of UFR rotates clockwise, the F sticker of UFR rotates 
counter clockwise.  The L sticker of FL, the L sticker of UFL, the L 
sticker of UL all permute counterclockwise as you&#x27;re looking at the L 
face.  Also the B stickers of each piece RB, URB, UB all permute 
clockwise as you&#x27;re looking at the B face.  Anyway here&#x27;s the alg, f 
u&#x27; f&#x27; u r&#x27; u r u&#x27;  where the lowercase letters stand for the sliding 
move corresponding to that letter.  If you solve the F2L correctly 
(positions and orientations) just by intuition then after you solve 
the positions of the last layer pieces you can use the algs that 
rotate the centers only (by face moves from the normal 3x3x3 with 
designs) with a combo of slide moves to fix the orientations of the U 
face stickers of the cross.  Then you might be able to use this alg 
combined with lots of similar algs and the normal 3x3x3 picture cube 
center rotators to fix the last orientations.  The positions might 
fix automatically just by fixing the orientations using this alg but 
it might be possible that you can end up with a 3 cycle permutation 
of three pieces and all orientations are corret (No idea if this is 
true or not).  There might even be a way of just moving around the 
stickers in the U face that places them and orients them, without 
having to solve them ignoring orientation first.  I think this alg 
and the slice move center rotators are enough to fix all the 
orientations and positions, though I&#x27;m not sure.

I think it would be very cool to try to fix the positions and 
orientations of a larger cube, say 5x5x5.  I wonder how difficult it 
would be, or if it is more time consuming than difficult.  It seems 
you could extend the alg above to use inner slide moves rather than 
outer face slide moves and extensions of that idea to get some moves 
to fix the orientations of edge and center pieces.

anyway this is just my random two cents,
Chris

And why not blindfolded, freefalling in a bathtub, with a timebomb set
to explode after 20 seconds?

Think big.

          <div class="email-content">Ping,
    I can understand the difficulty in making a 3d manipulation in a 2d medium, otherwise I would&#x27;ve tried to write a program myself by now :).  As for the GC program, I found manipulation of the cube very very pleasing as compared to some other programs.  There were a few times where I was slightly annoyed that the wrong slice would move, I noticed this especially when the cube was oriented so that one of the faces was virtually parallel to the screen (no pun intended).  On those occasions it seemed that every now and then a slice that was perpendicular to the slice I was actually trying to move would move instead.  But a simple reorintation of the cube solved that.  I do believe GC had one of the better interfaces I&#x27;ve tried on the whole though.
    As for Oinkleburger, I personally think it is good because of a few things.  First and foremost it is very scaleable, you can do a cube of any size you wish, though above a certain number it becomes difficult for me to figure out how the center cubies and edge cubies match up, because of the &quot;inside out&quot; projection, but that can be chalked up to inexperience.  Second, once you understand how the cube moves on the projection, it is very very easy to make whatever move you want.  That is, the program &quot;knows&quot; very well what move you are trying to perform, unlike the java programs I mentioned.  My only complaint with the program is that it does take some getting used to with the odd projection method.  That is why when I first started cubing, I could not figure that applet out.  But now that I am more familiar with how the cube moves, it makes sense to me.
    One of my absolute favorite implementations of a 3d (actually a 4D) puzzle is the Magic Cube 4D: http://www.superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm .  I prefer the windows version because it is very easy to move the hypercube around, whereas in the linux version the cube is fixed and it is difficult to see some things (There is a way to move it in the linux version if I remember correctly, but it&#x27;s not as nice an interface as windows IMHO).  There are 3 kinds of twists you can make on this hypercube, you can twist about a centerpiece of a solid &quot;Face&quot;, you can twist about an edge piece of a solid &quot;face&quot;, or you can twist about a corner piece of a solid &quot;face&quot;.  The interface is very simple.  To twist clockwise about a centerpiece you right click the center piece, to twist anti-clockwise, you left click.  The same applies to each piece. For cubes larger than 3x3x3x3 you simply hold down the number of the layer you want to twist, then click the piece representing the axis.  To rotate the puzzle in 3 dimensions, you click and drag.  To rotate the puzzle in 4 dimensions, you ctrl+click (if I remember correctly).  No need to drag in 4d, for reasons that are difficult to explain, but obvious if you use the program.  This is nice because there is NO confusion about which direction you would like to rotate which hyperface.  And I believe that this could be easily implemented to many virtual programs.  In fact, it could be implemented on any magic polyhedron with static centers (cube, megaminx, even a pyraminx if you got creative).
I&#x27;ll stop ranting now.  :)  Just thought I&#x27;d give you an implementation of a 3d puzzle that I find very easy to use, since you asked.  And while it is difficult to represent and manipulate 3d objects on a 2d monitor, this program successfully represents and allows simple manipulation of a 3d representation of a 4d object on a 2d monitor, which is impressive!

Hope that is constructive feedback! 

And BTW, ALL CUBISTS HERE need to go to that site above and solve the MC4D.  Only 16 people in the world have EVER solved it.  I know that if I&#x27;m one of them (which I am) the puzzle is not that hard.  You get to join a secret little Yahoo group, you get the satisfaction of solving a tough puzzle, you get your name in the &quot;hall of fame&quot;, and you get a pretty fun understanding of the movement and geometry of 4d objects.  We really need some more people to solve and and some of your brilliant minds to play with this puzzle and bring some new ideas to the group.  And as I said, it isnt&#x27; that tough at all.

Cheers!
Daniel

Yes!  I had quite a bit of control problems, actually.  Don&#x27;t take <br>
this wrong, I think it&#x27;s a great program, but I don&#x27;t want you to get <br>
the idea that your approach to puzzle control is flawless.<br>
1) If I had the puzzle oriented so that I saw mostly just one face, <br>
I&#x27;d often try to do a glide move to that front face, and it&#x27;d move <br>
something (that I can&#x27;t see) in the background.<br>
<br>
2) I found it extremely difficult to get it to respond naturally to <br>
my click/drag operations.  Sometimes, I&#x27;d click/drag, and it wouldn&#x27;t <br>
go, while other times it would go two spaces.  This is especially <br>
true with reduced animation quality.<br>
<br>
3) When doing a long glide movement, I found that if I accidentally <br>
moved off of the row I intended to be gliding, it would glide the <br>
next row over, instead of continuing to move the row I had originally <br>
clicked on.<br>
<br>
Each of these could use some improvement.<br>

I think the greatest advantage of a 2D layout like the one at <br>
oinkleburger.com is the fact that you can see and apply moves to all <br>
sides of the puzzle without rotating it.  Mirrors are great, but they <br>
slow down the graphics, and aren&#x27;t interactive.  Also, it&#x27;s nice that <br>
the Oinkleburger.com applet has built in timing and move counting, as <br>

features are temporarily disabled).  One last thing - it&#x27;s free!  You <br>
can&#x27;t beat free as far as cost is concerned.<br>

Thanks for your reply. It is very informative!  I knew about the 4D <br>

I must have given you the idea that I think my program is flawless.  
Don&#x27;t all salesmen think/talk like that? :-)  Actually I know my 
program is not perfect, but it is better than most of the 3D virtual 
cube puzzle programs out there.  Hey just yesterday there was a long 
conversation about how bad a design a 2x2x2 mini cube was.  So even a 
physical cube has flaws (and every physical cube eventually wears out 
too!).  I&#x27;ll keep trying to make it better though, thanks!

Hi Ping,

   I didn&#x27;t check my algorithms for orientation, so I don&#x27;t know.

   Spin moves can&#x27;t on a 3x3x3 but you can alter the center tiles on a
4x4x4. There is a conservation of parity, so what you do to one tile
you can do backwards to another tile. I&#x27;m not sure about parity on
your gliding cube, but it seems likely.

&gt; don&#x27;t alter tile orientations.  But spin moves really do not.<br>
<br>
Spin moves (normal cube moves) can change the orientations of tiles, <br>
as long as they are face centres, and you do an even number of <br>
quarter turns in total. See for example the move sequences in phase 8 <br>
of the solution on my page:<br>
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube3.htm<br>
<br>
By glide moves we can move any two tiles to the centres of two faces, <br>
use turns to twist those two tiles without disturbing anything else, <br>
and then undo the glide moves we did before to bring everything back <br>
to where it was. This shows that any two tiles can be twisted.<br>
<br>
Let me also just repeat part of an earlier post of mine:<br>
--<br>
If you include orientations of the tiles, then I think all 4^54 <br>
orientations are possible. If you turn a face, and then undo the side <br>
tiles with 3 glide moves, then you will have rotated 9 tiles a <br>
quarter turn. This is an odd number. It is already known that it is <br>
possible to give two tiles a quarter turn on the normal Rubik&#x27;s cube <br>
(and therefore on the gliding cube ANY two tiles can be given a <br>
quarter turn). By combining this it should be possible to give a <br>
single tile a quarter turn.<br>

   To clarify: The the corners and edges of the regular 3x3x3 cubes
are attached to other tiles so they can&#x27;t be rotated alone, but the
centers, not being firmely attached to other colors, can be rotated
[in pairs, but opposite directions].

well, do you have any interest in attempting to solve them yourself 
first?  cause that&#x27;s usually a little more exciting than just

You go into your bedroom for a few days, and don&#x27;t come out until 
they&#x27;re solved.

          <div class="email-content"> 1) (the main subject)- I&#x27;ve been looking for &quot;irregular&quot; cubes such <br>
as the Megaminx and the scewb (however you spell that) and the <br>
bangaged cube and puzzles such as that to buy online. My budget is <br>
not that high so even the cheepest &quot;cubes&quot; you know of would be <br>
helpful. As another note I have the Square-1, but does any have <br>
anything more than a &quot;basic&quot; solution such as the one posed on <br>
speedcubing.com? <br>
<br>
  2) I know this is an almost dead convorsation of crazy records <br>
involving bombs and stuff like that. I haven&#x27;t been here in awhile so <br>
I&#x27;m still going to get in on this stupid crazy record idea... What <br>
about... dropping out of an airplane into the Atlantic. In your right <br>
hand you have a 5x5x5 rubiks cube and in the other hand you have a <br>
Megaminx. (as a side not you haven&#x27;t gotten any sleep for the past 3 <br>
days) You are blindfolded and scilicone spray and vasoline are <br>
sprayed on your fingers before you jump. While you have your 1:00 <br>
free fall till you hit the water you need to break dance with your <br>
legs and do the macarena with your arms. When you get to the <br>
parachute opening you need to 1) have both cubes solved and 2) open <br>
it with your toe while still break dancing. Inside are 187 cublets <br>
and 6 axles. Now in the water you quickly cut your parachute off and <br>
while compleatly submerged, with no goggles, (this part of the <br>
process needs to be memorized too) assemble 6 cubes excluding the 7 <br>
extra pieces and then scramble using a premeditated scrambeling <br>
algorythem for each. NOW while floating on your stomach still with no <br>
breathing equipment you must juggle the 6 cubes behind your back AND <br>
solve each of them. Now go home and gloat :-). **** Do not try <br>
this**** Sorry... had to say it :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I &quot;met&quot; the cube some six or seven years ago, when I was about twelve.<br>
I must have played with it for some time, learnt a solution.<br>
(something which I&#x27;m rather ashamed of, because I really enjoyed<br>
finding the solutions for the 4x4x4, the 5x5x5 and the megaminx on my<br>
own). I got down to average times of around 60s using an algorithm<br>
which probably comprised about 90-100 moves. (I&#x27;m not sure, but I know<br>
that I knew very few LL algs because I didn&#x27;t know &quot;exchange two<br>
diagonal corners&quot; and I only knew one alg for corner orientating. It<br>
then took two or three algs to do the edges)<br>
<br>
About a week ago, a friend of mine was learning to do the cube and was<br>
getting times of around two minutes, so I swaggered up and showed him<br>
what I could do. (a painful process, but I got lucky and did it in 100s)<br>
<br>
I couldn&#x27;t find my old cube, so I went and bought a new one.<br>
Basically, it sucks. It is not too stiff, but it &quot;clicks&quot; as I turn a<br>
face. It has some &quot;natural states&quot; which are situated 1/4 and 3/4 of<br>
the way along a quarter turn. I&#x27;ve been thinking that some filing of<br>
some of the pieces might help, but I&#x27;m rather anxious not to break it<br>
(I switzerland, it cost some 15 euros/$). I was wondering whether<br>
anyone has any tips on making it faster.<br>
<br>
I can solve with fewer than 60 moves going for fewest moves and<br>
probably around 70 when going for speed (I&#x27;ve given some thought to<br>
F2L and I learnt a couple more algs for LL - basically using<br>
variations on the Petrus method: ensuring that all my edge cubies are<br>
orientated before finishing F2L). I&#x27;m still stuck on 70-80 s and some<br>
part of this is due to lack of vision of the peices for f2l, but I<br>
then can&#x27;t speed up my LL because I can&#x27;t get the damn cube to go fast<br>
enough. Help!<br>

          <div class="email-content">That happened to me once. I think the reason it happens is because 
you&#x27;re trying to go fast. Just go slowly during F2L, adn speed up at 
the LL. Hopefully that will help.

I don&#x27;t know how to create one, either, but Jessica Fridrich wrote an 
email to rhis group, outlining the things that would have to be done. 
She is a professor at SUNY-Binghamton. At universities they are 
always forming some sort of associations, so she knows what she is 
talking about. I myself went to a university, even making it as far 
as grad school. :-)What needs is ORGANIZATION and MONEY, the latter 
coming from dues of members. Having this association may be cool, but 
paying $50 a year to maintain it may not be so cool.

   :) Clever, you guys. Close, but no cigar.

   L2R2 = r2 and is a single move; U2 is a single move, and a rock
group to boot!

   An algorithm is a *series of moves* not a single move.

   C&#x27;mon, if it was on that IQ test you would have solved it,
especially since there&#x27;s a glaring hint in the puzzle itself.

I can think of five &quot;real&quot; answers off the top of my head, the first <br>
four of which are LL algs (rotated appropriately):<br>
<br>
1) R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F U R U&#x27; R2 B&#x27; R&#x27; B<br>
2) R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; B&#x27; U2 F B<br>
3) R B L B&#x27; R&#x27; B F R F&#x27; L&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; B&#x27;<br>
4) B2 U B2 U&#x27; B2 U&#x27; D B2 U&#x27; B2 U B2 D&#x27;<br>
5) F&#x27; B U2 F2 B2 D2 F&#x27; B<br>
<br>
For each of these, I&#x27;m sure there are different cube orientations <br>
that could be used, giving a different alg.  Also, you could use a <br>
different alg to produce the same situation, but that&#x27;s kinda cheap.  <br>
Anyways, there are likely very many solutions to this puzzle - <br>
Basically, any situation that has an effect on the cube that is <br>
symmetric across the slice between L and R and swaps pairs of pieces <br>
would be a valid answer.<br>

What&#x27;s to stop it having just one move? Besides, it all depends on 
your set of generators whether it&#x27;s one move or not.

(Also L2R2=r2? What&#x27;s that?)

You should really define your terms.

   Oops. I thought it was known.

   &quot;r&quot; is the center slice next to R, clockwise, same direction as R
done clockwise. Borrowed from 4x4x4 notation. Since x,y,z xx yy zz M,E
etc and the others are so hard for people to remember.

   Here&#x27;s the whole notation.

The three basic turns: 
the single letter, for 90 degree clockwise turns,
the letter and number &quot;2&quot; 180 degree turns,
the letter and the single quotation mark &quot; &#x27; &quot; for 90 degree
counter-clockwise turns. 

For example:
R = Right layer clockwise
R2 = Right layer 180 degrees
R&#x27; = Right layer counterclockwise

Then there are six sides:

R = Right layer clockwise
U = Top layer clockwise
L = Left layer clockwise
D = Lowest layer clockwise
F = Front layer clockwise
B = Back layer clockwise

Then there are the middle layers or  slices:

r = center slice next to R
u = center slice under U
b = center slice in front of B

so r&#x27; would mean turning the center slice next to R counter-clockwise
as you would turn R.
Note: I see no problem if someone uses l, d, and f for convenience.

And finally, rotating the whole cube in your hand (Q stands for cube)

QR = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the right
QU = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the top
QB = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the back

OK?

Great idea. I think you would need some custom software to maintain it,<br>
though.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d also like to see a menu of just the serious records, without all the<br>
crazy ones. Something like:<br>
<br>
3x3x3 cube<br>
<br>
- fastest time<br>
- fewest moves<br>
- fastest blindfold time<br>
- fastest noinspect time<br>
<br>
Each of these with a separate table for best single record, and best<br>
average record.<br>
<br>
Right now, it&#x27;s quite hard to find the &quot;fewest moves&quot; category. When I<br>
forget where it is, &quot;Statistical records&quot; is always the last place I<br>
look.<br>
<br>
Speaking of fewest moves, I think there need to be two subcategories:<br>
<br>
1. Fewest moves in a single attempt. That is, you are not allowed to<br>
take back moves. (this is how I do it).<br>
<br>
2. Fewest moves with as many attempts as you like.<br>

Maybe an easy way to do the first part of my idea would be to just 
have the different records in the category display in a list when

If I can understand the Helmstetter index properly (which I probably<br>

learn simpler compound moves for the rest? (ie. like the compound moves<br>

&gt;Hi Ryan and Simon,<br>
&gt;    :) Clever, you guys. Close, but no cigar.<br>
&gt;    L2R2 = r2 and is a single move; U2 is a single move, and a rock<br>
&gt;group to boot!<br>
&gt;    An algorithm is a *series of moves* not a single move.<br>
&gt;    C&#x27;mon, if it was on that IQ test you would have solved it,<br>
&gt;especially since there&#x27;s a glaring hint in the puzzle itself.<br>
<br>
OK David, if you want a series of moves ...<br>
<br>
UU<br>
<br>
Seriously, with any puzzle I am always attracted to the simplest, most <br>
elegant solution.  U2 seems to be it, in my books.  If that constitutes <br>
&quot;cheating&quot; then you probably need to re-word the puzzle to exclude such <br>
solutions.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s having a genius-level IQ for you :-D<br>
<br>
best,<br>
S.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Here is a puzzle.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Find an algorithm that from a solved cube:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    returns to a solved cube after executing it twice<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    AND<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    returns to a solved cube after executing it once right-handed and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then executing the left-handed version of the algorithm.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  (Or left-handed, then right-handed.)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; L2R2<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Ryan<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;AND<br>

I agree, making the site look fancy is not really important, and doing<br>
anything that requires custom software is not necessary. But if someone<br>
wants these things, maybe someone can volunteer? (I&#x27;m personally not<br>
interested in a fancy site, but I am interested in structure and<br>
navigation)<br>
<br>
As for custom software, if someone wants these features (eg. a user<br>
database, automatically generated statistics, etc.), I&#x27;ll volunteer.<br>
Ron, the idea is to create a tool that generates the static content out<br>
of a database of plain xml files. This means you don&#x27;t need to run a<br>
server program, yet everything still appears to be dynamically generated<br>
to the user.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello guys,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve just picked up a rubiks cube from a friend who was going to dump <br>
it. I want to be able to solve it without using a computer or <br>
refering to notes.<br>
<br>
At the moment I can completer the top and middle slices leaving the <br>
bottom one, without references. However, I get totally lost at the <br>
bottom slice. I have tried to have a look at some internet resources <br>
and follow them but my cube gets even more messed up. The only I can <br>
solve it is by putting the cube configuration into a program and then <br>
getting it to solve it for me.<br>
<br>
Has anyone got any hints or tips on how to do this last layer <br>
intuitively? I&#x27;m not looking for speed at the moment, just being able <br>
to complete it would be nice.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

&gt;intuitively? I&#x27;m not looking for speed at the moment, just being able<br>

<br>
Sure.<br>
<br>
First off, divide the final layer process into two parts:<br>
1. getting the cubies into their correct places (positioning pieces, <br>
sometimes called permuting)<br>
2. twisting or flipping the pieces so that they are oriented correctly<br>
<br>
It does not matter which bit you do first, and which bit second.<br>
When starting off, it is usually a good idea to divide each of these two <br>
stages into two further divisions: corners and edges.  So for example you <br>
could:<br>
1. ORIENT edges (affects edge positions and corners; two algorithms)<br>
2. POSITION corners (affects corner orientations and edge positions; two <br>
algorithms)<br>
3. ORIENT corners (affects edge positions; two algorithms plus one <br>
inversion)<br>
4. POSITION edges (affects nothing else; three algorithms)<br>
<br>
Such a method is called a four-look last layer, because you are finishing <br>
off the last layer in four steps.  The fewer steps you take, the more <br>
algorithms you need to remember.<br>
<br>
A place that tells you how to do the last layer in four looks, as I have <br>
described above, can be found here:<br>
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Intermediate.html<br>
It also gives more general info about the last layer, and a link to explain <br>
the notation, if that is confusing you at all.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps, and good luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">My website, http://www.oinkleburger.com, has a cube applet that keeps
track of how many moves it takes to solve.  The applet has been running
for almost 3 1/2 years, and in that time, the record for the fewest
number of moves required to solve a 5x5x5 was 216 moves in 2 minutes 5
seconds, set by Dr. Richard Carr on March 20, 2003.

This applet counts quarter turns, so a slice move is one move, and a 180
degree turn is two moves.

Here&#x27;s another Dr. C solution that is 235 moves long:

That&#x27;s the part you need to use algorithms for. Go to 
speedcubing.com, and click on algorithms. That should help you.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan and Simon,

   I find it interesting that you both misunderstood.   

   I guess that there is a difference in usage of some language terms.
The idea of &quot;right handed then left handed&quot; is mirror images.

   U2F2U2F2U2F2 becomes U2B2U2B2U2B2

   UU becomes DD

   Which both fail the second part of the puzzle.

   Even if you don&#x27;t get the idea that left hand and right hand are
mirror images it should have been clear that simply repeating the same
moves was was excluded from the second part of the puzzle because that
was covered in the first part of the puzzle.

   Grant&#x27;s examples were all spot on.

   The algorithms which flip over two edges - front and back or left
and right on the last level would also be examples. But there are
others. Two very interesting ones...

Best regards,
  
David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi Rav.

   Welcome to the board.

   There are two approaches to cubing, learn from someone else or do
it yourself. If you believe you can solve it on your own you probably can.

   From a do it yourself point of view the key you may be looking for
is this:

   Once two levels are solved, if you want to do more than rotate the
last level in place, you must involve what you already have solved.
That means you need to take something out of place one way and put it
back another way.

   Regards,

   David J

   Excellent!

   For no particular reason, for #2 above try L&#x27; R&#x27; D2 L R U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D2
L R U&#x27;  I know it&#x27;s two more moves than your alg but it&#x27;s similar.

   And for #5 try D2 b2 D2 b2

   Thanks,

David J

OK David, if U2 does not count I canalways convert it to a 2-<br>

It&#x27;s not particularly efficient though. For instance, twice there is 
a move followed by its inverse and also the orientation of the last 
layer was done in two steps. Further, since the aim was for speed, 
things were probably missed. I&#x27;m sure that it would be possible to 
drop the number of moves a bit if speed wasn&#x27;t an issue. Also by 
learning the OLL algorithms the number of moves in general would fall.

That&#x27;s a rather sad commentary on the life of Dr. C.
Really ought to do something else.
Still, only 103 days to go and then can be done with the cube.

          <div class="email-content">I believe your talking about the combined step 5 and 6 of Lar&#x27;s 
method, or is that 5, 6, and 7. (Please clarify) I don&#x27;t know where 
the number 177 is from, but if you are refering to doing corners 
while preserving edge flip, then I am one of the people doing this. 
If you read the Helmstetter index carefully, some of the algorithms 
ARE compound moves of simpler algs.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Simon,

   If it really does satisfy the rules (I&#x27;m not going to try it) I
guess I can accept it as a computer&#x27;s solution to the puzzle, but then
computers don&#x27;t get things like context. I&#x27;m still waiting for *your*
solution.

   The puzzle was for people not computers. Do you really think in
terms of L&#x27;DRR2F&#x27; instead of L&#x27;DR&#x27;F&#x27;? The spirit of the puzzle is not
found in the computer.

   It wasn&#x27;t a trick question. There are reasonable assumptions that
humans make that are implicit, not explicit. I would have thought I
didn&#x27;t have to explain that an interpretation such as yours wasn&#x27;t
within of the rules.

   It really isn&#x27;t a solution to the puzzle because if the end result
of your long string is U2, it is already excluded. One could do any
algorithm forwards, then backwards, then add U2, at the end. If you
don&#x27;t realize that that *isn&#x27;t* what I was after I don&#x27;t know what to
tell you.

   Regards,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">&quot;The idea of &quot;right handed then left handed&quot; IS mirror images.&quot; But 
I thought it was understood to mean symmetry through a plane. What 
your talking about is symmetry through a line or perhaps point (does 
U become D in your usage?). I don&#x27;t believe this to be the standard 
usage. Ok so if it&#x27;s mirror through a line then a move isomorphic to 
RLD2R&#x27;L&#x27;F&#x27;B&#x27;D2FB should work (among many others). If it is mirror 
through the origin, then it is just the &quot;center&quot; of the group, which 
consists of precisely two elements: the identity and the superfilp.

Why not just write R instead of R&#x27;&#x27; (last line) or even R&#x27; instead of 
R&#x27;&#x27;R2 and then later in that same line R&#x27; instead of RR2?

 You only really need to memerize 3 algorithms. The diagonal corner <br>

a common color except the LL color and see if they need to be <br>

I didn&#x27;t say it had to be fancy, I just thought it would be nice to 
be able to see what records are in each category without having to 
click and search through everyone.

&gt; Hi Ryan and Simon,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    I find it interesting that you both misunderstood.   <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    I guess that there is a difference in usage of some language terms.<br>
&gt; The idea of &quot;right handed then left handed&quot; is mirror images.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    U2F2U2F2U2F2 becomes U2B2U2B2U2B2<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    UU becomes DD<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;    Which both fail the second part of the puzzle.<br>
<br>
Notice that you&#x27;re flipping front-to-back in the first case, and<br>
top-to-bottom in the second case. Surely you want to flip left-to-right<br>
so that:<br>
<br>
    U2F2U2F2U2F2 becomes U2F2U2F2U2F2<br>
 <br>
    UU becomes U&#x27;U&#x27;<br>
<br>
&gt;    Grant&#x27;s examples were all spot on.<br>
<br>
When you flipped U2F2U2F2U2F2 front-to-back (instead of left-to-right)<br>
it failed.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, if you flip Grant&#x27;s first example front-to-back<br>
(instead of left-to-right) it will also fail:<br>
<br>
1) R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F U R U&#x27; R2 B&#x27; R&#x27; B<br>
<br>
However, the question was asked in terms of left and right hands (not<br>
front and back hands, or top and bottom hands), so it seems to me that<br>
all of the examples so far are spot on.<br>
<br>
&gt;    The algorithms which flip over two edges - front and back or left<br>
&gt; and right on the last level would also be examples. But there are<br>
&gt; others. Two very interesting ones...<br>
<br>
To be exact, what is the shortest algorithm you&#x27;ll allow? In my books,<br>
L2R2 is an algorithm (I even have it written down as such in my<br>
notebook). Is it too short? How about U2F2U2F2U2F2? Are slice moves<br>
counted as one? If so, how about U2M2U2M2?  (Same effect as Grant&#x27;s<br>
example 5, but only 4 slice moves, or 6 normal moves instead of 8). How<br>
about Simon&#x27;s perfect U2 solution?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all<br>
    I&#x27;m packing up to go home from college and I already packed away my cube(s).  So I have to settle for my little keychain cube that I had on my suitcase.  Then I got to thinking.<br>
I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to solve the entire cube by using only twists with the keychain part.  That is, hold the cube in your left hand and slip one of your fingers through the keychain hole.  Then twist the puzzle only by gripping with the left hand, and changing your grip with the left hand, but pulling with the ring.  Do you follow?  It would be equivalent of trying to solve a regular cube with your fingers glued to one of the corner cubies and not allowing turns of any faces that don&#x27;t contain that cubie.  ie if the cubie is in the UFR position, you are only allowed to perform UFR, not BLD.  This changes of course after you perform a move.  For example If the piece is in UFR and you perform R2, you may then perform B, D, or R but not U,L, or F.<br>
    I have as yet been unsuccsessful, but I&#x27;ve been at it for a solid 10 minutes. Anyone anyone?<br>

Solving the cube by only turning faces containing a particular corner <br>
piece is not always possible. In fact, it is not even possible on a <br>
2x2x2 cube.<br>
<br>
To see this you first have to realise that if you do a sequence of <br>
moves that bring the corner back to where it started, then that <br>
sequence must have an even number of quarter turns. This is because <br>
you can give a 2x2x2 cube a chekcerboard colouring and each quarter <br>
turn moves the corner from a white position to a black position or <br>
vice versa. To end up where it started it must have changed colour an <br>
even number of times, and so you must have done an even number of <br>
quarter turns to bring it back.<br>
<br>
There is no move sequence that has the same effect as turning a face <br>
not containing the corner by a quarter turn. Such a move sequence <br>
would have to perform an odd permutation on the corners (after all <br>
its effect is just a single quarter turn). However we have just seen <br>
that this sequence must consist of an even number of quarter turns <br>
because the corner piece is back where it started. An even number of <br>
quarter turns must result in an even permutation of the corners. This <br>
is a contradiction, so there cannot be such a move sequence.<br>
<br>
This shows that there is a parity constraint - the permutation of the <br>
corners must be even or odd depending on whether the corner is an <br>
even or odd number of quarter turns away from its home position.<br>
<br>
There is still a very difficult question - is this the only <br>
restriction?  Is it possible to put the edges in any position while <br>
leaving the corners in place? Is it possible to just twist corners <br>
without doing anything else? etc.<br>

    Well since that is not always possible, perhaps mixing it up in that way, then trying to solve it would prove fun.    That HAS to be possible.  Also, would the original challange be possible if you were allowed a up to a set number of other twists, not within the specified group?  Like maybe you are allowed to twist the cube 5 quarter turns that are not in the group?  That might also be fun...<br>

I didn&#x27;t have to think much about this problem because I had already <br>
done it some time ago. The exact same thing occurs on the Bandaged <br>
Cube. There each corner is glued to an edge piece, except for one. <br>
This free corner has to be in the face you are turning. Same problem, <br>
same solution. The first time it took me ages to realise what was <br>
happening though.<br>
<br>
As for training, I studied maths at university. You don&#x27;t need that <br>
for this kind of stuff of course, all you need is a few books, <br>
patience, and lots of practice so that you train your insight.<br>

<br>
Certainly, and it is very difficult I think. I haven&#x27;t really tried <br>
out out properly. It will be hard because you always have to involve <br>
so many faces. If you only use to faces you couldn&#x27;t do more than <br>
RU&#x27;RU&#x27;RU&#x27;RU&#x27; etc.<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, would the original challange be possible if you were allowed <br>
a up to a set number of other twists, not within the specified group?<br>
<br>
Just a quick remark - mathematically speaking it is not a group, <br>
because not all moves are allowed at all times. If however we hold <br>
the cube at the corner, and the moves are given by turning two slices <br>
in unison then it does become a group (which also involves the <br>
centres as moving pieces).<br>
<br>
Tomorrow I&#x27;ll put it into GAP and see how big this group is.<br>
<br>
&gt; Like maybe you are allowed to twist the cube 5 quarter turns that <br>
are not in the group?  That might also be fun...<br>
<br>
For the restriction I found, a single quarter turn would be enough to <br>
fix it. If there are other unresolved restrictions remains to be seen.<br>

Just wanted to say that I&#x27;ve just completed my first Rubiks cube 
without using a computer program. I printed out the last layer 
solution below and followed it through. 

Now I will scramble up my cube and try it again a few times and then 
try and comit the algorithms to memory. Does anyone have any tips for 
this?

I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;ll never become an expert so the intermediate 
level will be fine.

Thanks everyone,

&gt;try and comit the algorithms to memory. Does anyone have any tips for<br>
&gt;this?<br>
<br>
Well the obvious thing is just to do them lots of times: starting with a <br>
solved cube, any of the algorithms will eventually &quot;cycle&quot; back to a solved <br>
state pretty quickly: usually after 2, 3, or 4 goes.<br>
<br>
You will find that different people will have various tips on this, here is <br>
mine:<br>
<br>
Before you start memorizing an algorithm, take time to find a way to execute <br>
it in a way that suits your hands; this may mean doing the moves with the <br>
cube facing in a different direction, or rotating the cube in the middle of <br>
doing the algorithm.  Using a good lubricated cube, you will find that <br>
groups of moves will naturally flow together (triggers), and so instead of <br>
memorizing lots of single moves you may only need to remember two triggers <br>
plus one connecting rotation.  For example take alg. 7 in the orienting <br>
corners:<br>
<br>
Ri U2 R U Ri Ui R U Ri U R<br>
<br>
If I use brackets to show the triggers that I use I do this in basically two <br>
moves (actually I do this on my left side but whatever):<br>
((Ri U2) (R U Ri)) (Ui (R U Ri) U R)<br>
<br>
... and that&#x27;s all I need to remember: two moves, not eleven.<br>
<br>
I may have already seen Dan Knight&#x27;s stuff on triggers, if not that are <br>
worth a visit:<br>

   One can do any single algorithm with both hands. Can&#x27;t you tell
that that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about?

   I understand that you can do U2 clockwise with your right hand and
counterclockwise with your left, but there are two points that you are
missing.

   The first is that doing the same algorithm is only *half* the
puzzle. You aren&#x27;t doing the other half. The word &quot;and&quot; means an
addition . &quot;And&quot; doing the left handed version means a *different*
algorithm, not the same one.

   The second is that a cube may be rotated. When the Up face becomes
the Right face then naturally the left handed counterpart to R is L&#x27;.

   There was no restriction placed on rotating the cube, just using a
genuine flip over.
  
>     UU becomes U&#x27;U&#x27;

   Yes, in an algorithm, but not in isolation. This is an error in
notation.

   One real flip will suffice.

   You are talking about a limitation, in this case, in your notation
method, not a limit to the puzzle. L2 R2 is r2 - one move.

   I answered him separately.

   Look, it&#x27;s no big deal. I developed B&#x27; R&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U R B
(and another one) and thought it was really neat and I wanted to share
it. I liked the way Ron presented his puzzle and I thought you guys
would enjoy working it out.

          <div class="email-content">d_j_salvia, it seems that we&#x27;ve all failed to understand the true
challenge of your puzzle, except for Grant. But even then:

Grant wrote:

He seems to be contradicting you. Both of my solutions satisfy his
definition, but fail your approval:

- L2R2 is symmetric across the slice between L and R, and swaps 4 pairs
  of edges and 4 pairs of corners.

- U2F2U2F2U2F2 is symmetric across the slice between L and R and swaps
  two pairs of edges.

So would it be fair to say that none of us fully understand your
question? Was it a trick question? If not, I think we&#x27;d all be grateful
if you could rephrase it for clarity.

I also have some other questions:

Now let&#x27;s be clear. Does every algorithm have a left handed version? If
so, what is the formula to derive it?

I assume we can use a single formula to derive the left handed version
for any algorithm.

Grant has shown (to your satisfaction) that some solutions do not
require a cube rotation. In fact, all of his algorithms were already
pre-rotated to the position he knew would work if they were flipped from
left-to-right. Mine too.

To be honest, I did not know that you were going to flip my algorithm
from top-to-bottom. If I had known so, I would have given you
F2R2F2R2F2R2 or F2L2F2L2F2L2 or B2R2B2R2B2R2 or B2L2B2L2B2L2.

Maybe part of the trick is that we do not know which way you will flip
it and we must be prepared. In that case, how about:

L2R2F2B2U2D2

?

>    One real flip will suffice.

Ok, so much for that :-)

This algorithm can be flipped without rotating it and it still works.
Does that mean this example (along with Grant&#x27;s example 5 since it&#x27;s
equivalent) has &quot;two real flips&quot;?

Since only one real flip is required, I suppose the rotation is not
necessary to prove that it is a valid solution.

I decided not to look your solution. I&#x27;m not giving up yet!

It is not just the time it takes that is the problem. It is also the <br>
memory (or hard disk) requirements. When you calculate such things in <br>
a reasonable time you would usually need at least 2 bits per <br>
position, which still means 10070391761.71875 Megabytes for the cube. <br>
If you don&#x27;t have that kind of disk space it will take a bit longer <br>
because you would have to many more calculations because for every <br>
position you have to recreate data that you would otherwise simply <br>
look up.<br>
<br>
By the way, the numbers up to 9 moves are known, and were calculated <br>
by Jerry Brian I think. Look at the cube notes on Mark Longridge&#x27;s <br>
site:<br>
http://www.cubeman.org/<br>

Hey Jaap,
In comparison with your great knowledge and intelligence, I may sound like a moron here, but I was wondering- If you mix up the cube only moving the keychain corner, couldn&#x27;t you solve it (however difficult it is) using only the keychain corner?  Im just wondering.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan,

   I can tell that Grant understood it because he responded. Where
there is no response I don&#x27;t know. Did Ron or Chris or Gilles
understand? I have no idea.

   L2R2 failed because it&#x27;s only one move - r2. An algorithm is
defined as a series of moves.

> - U2F2U2F2U2F2 is symmetric across the slice between L and R and

  The result has symmetry, but it fails because it isn&#x27;t another
algorithm; it is the same one done left handed.

> So would it be fair to say that none of us fully understand your
question?

   No. I don&#x27;t even know if others tried to understand.

   It&#x27;s not a trick question. The word &quot;and&quot; really does mean &quot;and.&quot;
I&#x27;ll think about rephrasing it. No promises though.

> Now let&#x27;s be clear. Does every algorithm have a left handed version?
If so, what is the formula to derive it?

   The following is not a solution to the puzzle, but I present it to
illustrate what I mean by right and left handed. With your right hand
turn R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;. That&#x27;s right handed. Now with your left hand
turn L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L. That&#x27;s the left-handed version. How the cube
is facing isn&#x27;t important. You could turn the cube 180 degrees and the
left handed version would still be the left handed version.

> To be honest, I did not know that you were going to flip my
algorithm from top-to-bottom. If I had known so, I would have given
you F2R2F2R2F2R2 or F2L2F2L2F2L2 or B2R2B2R2B2R2 or B2L2B2L2B2L2.

   Yes, you could rotate the cube QU and solve it left handed
F2L2F2L2F2L2 but renotating it after rotating the cube doesn&#x27;t change
the fact that *it&#x27;s the same algorithm.* 

> Maybe part of the trick is that we do not know which way you will

   No it&#x27;s a matter of understanding a property of the cube.

   This is exactly the right one to show that property.

   I write that r2 b2 u2. The outcome is certainly symmetrical. I&#x27;d
love for this one to qualify, by
virtue of its elasticity and symmetry, but it doesn&#x27;t. The order of
the turns in the algorithm is not relevant. All of the different ways
of notating that algorithm, r2 b2 u2, r2 u2 b2, u2 r2 b2, u2 b2 r2, b2
r2 u2, and b2 u2 r2, are exactly the same thing done with the cube
facing different ways: so it fails the puzzle requirement because the
&quot;left handed version&quot; is the same algorithm.

   I meant flipping over the algorithm right to left..

   Cube rotation is allowed, not required.

   Cool. The purpose of the puzzle is to explore the cube and expand
one&#x27;s understanding. Your questions have that effect on me. Thanks.

FYI, David, most people use a &quot;face turn&quot; metric, which would count <br>

<br>
&gt; &gt; - U2F2U2F2U2F2 is symmetric across the slice between L and R and<br>

<br>
Perhaps we could have eliminated a lot of the unneccessary discussion <br>
simply by adding a requirement that the algorithm not be the same <br>
when done &quot;left handed&quot; vs. &quot;right handed&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; So would it be fair to say that none of us fully understand your<br>

&gt; I&#x27;ll think about rephrasing it. No promises though.<br>
<br>
I think, in a way, it could be considered as a trick question.  There <br>
are apparently implied restrictions that are not stated explicitly in <br>
the rules of the puzzle.  While answers like R2L2 or U2 would be <br>
correct as the puzzle was originally stated, if you understand the <br>
spirit of the puzzle, you should know that the person asking the <br>
question isn&#x27;t looking for an answer as simple as U2, etc., etc.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; Now let&#x27;s be clear. Does every algorithm have a left handed<br>
&gt; &gt; version?<br>
&gt; &gt; If so, what is the formula to derive it?<br>
&gt; The following is not a solution to the puzzle, but I present it to<br>
&gt; illustrate what I mean by right and left handed. With your right<br>
&gt; hand<br>
&gt; turn R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;. That&#x27;s right handed. Now with your left hand<br>
&gt; turn L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L. That&#x27;s the left-handed version. How the<br>
&gt; cube is facing isn&#x27;t important. You could turn the cube 180 degrees<br>
&gt; and the left handed version would still be the left handed version.<br>
<br>
Here, I think you&#x27;ve made a bit of a mistake in dictating what <br>
defines right and left handed.  Typically, if you want to refer to <br>
right and left handed, you would simply take the mirror of the <br>
algorithm across the slice between R and L, so &quot;how the cube is <br>
facing&quot; does matter!<br>
<br>
I thought more that what you were looking for was an effect on the <br>
cube that was symetrical across that slice, where the mirror image of <br>
the algs was not the same.  To expect more, the puzzle must be better <br>
defined.  If you take some of the algs I provided, and hold the cube <br>
the way I normally would to execute them, and then do them left <br>
handed, they would no longer be correct solutions.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; Maybe part of the trick is that we do not know which way you will<br>
&gt; &gt; flip it and we must be prepared. &lt;<br>
&gt; No it&#x27;s a matter of understanding a property of the cube.<br>
<br>
As the only person who supposedly understood your puzzle, I don&#x27;t <br>
understand ;-)   Again, I would say that right vs. left handed is <br>
doing the alg&#x27;s mirror across the slice between R &amp; L.  I don&#x27;t <br>
understand where cube rotations or mirrors in other directions come <br>
into play.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; In that case, how about:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; L2R2F2B2U2D2<br>
<br>
Again, rather than a long discourse on this, I think we merely need <br>
to state the the left handed version of the alg must differ from the <br>
original alg.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; Since only one real flip is required, I suppose the rotation is<br>
&gt; &gt; not necessary to prove that it is a valid solution.<br>
&gt; Cube rotation is allowed, not required.<br>
<br>
Okay, I may have completely missed something, but I still don&#x27;t think <br>
cube rotations should be coming into play.  My understanding from the <br>
way the puzzle was stated was that I needed to find an alg such that <br>
I could:<br>
- start with a solved cube<br>
- execute the same alg twice, returning to a solved cube<br>
- execute the alg once (right handed - original sequence)<br>
- execute the alg once left handed (mirror across slice between L &amp; R)<br>
- return to the solved cube<br>
<br>
Implicatied rules being that the mirror is not to be the same as the <br>
original algorithm, and the algorithm should not solve the cube after <br>
being executed once.  Perhaps we could restate the puzzle as such - <br>
Find an algorithm that meets these requirements:<br>
1) Executed once on a solved cube it does not result in a solved cube.<br>
2) Repeated twice on a solved cube, it does result in a solved cube.<br>
3) It is not identical when mirrored across the slice between the L <br>
and R.<br>
4) Executed once right handed and then left handed, it results in a <br>
solved cube where &quot;left handed&quot; implies a mirror of the original <br>
(right handed) algorithm across the slice between the L and R faces.<br>
<br>
I think this eliminates the &quot;simple&quot; cases that were not desired <br>
originally, but still keeps intact the remainder of the puzzle.  Does <br>
this seem right now?<br>

Just because computers have doubled in speed roughly every year 
(which is known as Moore&#x27;s law in the computer biz), may not be 
something that you can count on in the coming years.  This is because 
the sizes of circuits have to be reduced in order for the speeds to 
double.  At some point, no further reduction is possible, because 
there are too few atoms involved for the transistors to continue to 
function.  Quantum mechanical effects kick in eventually, and at that 
point Moore&#x27;s law is no longer something that you can bank on.  For 
more info, you can start with this website: 
http://www.intel.com/research/silicon/mooreslaw.htm

Intel does not predict that Moore&#x27;s law will hold beyond the end of 
the decade.

   Sorry if it seems like squabbling. I like it that Ryan and Simon

   It was explicit in the wording. The whole point was using two
different algortithms, otherwise there is no puzzle, and no point to
the exercise. 

> Here, I think you&#x27;ve made a bit of a mistake in dictating what

  I wasn&#x27;t. I was only stating *what I meant* in terms of the puzzle.
Perhaps that was too limiting.

    It does matter in terms of defining what a mirror image is. The
way I thought about it first &quot;how the cube faced&quot; mattered, then I
found I case where I could rotate the cube and apply the left handed
algorithm which worked. This changed my thinking on the problem. But
you are right I should stick with the original idea.

But I think 177 is excluding inverses. So the number of distinct 
positions is probably around 250, but I haven&#x27;t counted.

I did plan to try to learn all 250 for the WC, but that has turned 
out to be completely unrealistic. I hardly have time to take out the 
trash...

But it would be a very good way to exploit the advantage of the 
Petrus method. With the edges oriented right in the LL, there are 1/6 
as many positions as in the general case. About 250 vs 1500, I guess. 
So any algorithm you learn will be 6 times as useful, and learning 
all 250 would be the way to maximize that advantage.

I think it&#x27;s perfectly doable, and actually very little compared to 
what an elite chess player memorizes about openings. But someone else 
than me will have to actually do it...

Sorry, I think it (that I hear in April) was the other way round 
about reducing entropy whilst solving and the conundrum therein.

Actually, there aer 7776 unique configurations. Perhaps you mean 
isomorphism classes of configurations (under an appropriate 
isomorphism).

with his gigantic cube club, thats pretty cool!!! :) <br>
What is this movie going to be about?  I&#x27;d kinda like to know what <br>
this thing is about.  IF the movie is going to be about cubers then <br>
deffinately Ron and Jessica and some of the elite cubers should be <br>

<br>
I know that Mr. Rubik solved the cube on his own before he started selling the &#x27;awesome puzzle&#x27;, but did he solve it using mathematics?  If so, how exactly did he figure it?  Does anyone know?  (Im sure Ron&#x27;s database has an answer...).  How exactly did he figure it out?  How long did it take him?

          <div class="email-content">I had the opportunity to travel a bit with Mr. Rubik in 1999, and I 
asked him to solve it for me.  His method was to solve the corners of 
the first layer, then insert three of the four edges in the first 
layer. Then he solved the other four corners.  Then he used 
the &quot;empty&quot; edge slot in the first layer and the unsolved &quot;middle 
layer&quot; to insert 3 of the top layer edges. He inserted the last &quot;top&quot; 
layer edge piece simultaneously with the missing &quot;first layer&quot; edge 
piece.  Then he swapped the &quot;middle layer&quot; edges into the right 
locations.  If any of them were flipped, he would flip them, and then 
the cube was solved!

This solution is by far the most &quot;intuitive&quot; solution I know.  The 
only part that takes any sort of algorithm is the flipping/permuting 
of the LL corners, and the flipping of the middle layer edges.  Thus 
you only really need 3 algorithms.  In fact, you can even get by with 
one or two if you get lucky with the LL corner permutation (skipped 
1/6) or the middle-layer edge flippage (skipped 1/8).

I have also heard that it took him about a month to figure out a 
solution.  Once he knew how to solve it, he says he could do it in 
about a minute.  He never claimed to be able to do it quickly - 
hasn&#x27;t he done enough just by inventing it and being the first person 
to solve it?  (heheh!)  

I had heard a rumor that after a month he was only stuck on the last 
step, flipping two edges in place.  Supposedly when he finally solved 
it, he used this move:
Rx U Rx U Rx U2 Lx U Lx U Lx U2  (where Rx means turning the middle-
layer slice in between the R and L faces clockwise RELATIVE to R, and 
Lx means Rx inverse).  I had heard that this algorithm was 
called &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Maneuver&quot;, because it was the crux and final step of 
his solution.

I told him this story, and showed him the algorithm, and he said, in 
his heavy hungarian accent and typically stoic manner, &quot;Yes, eed-iz 
pozzible zat I invented zat.&quot;

I really recommend that you try this method - it&#x27;s SO much fun!  I 
often teach this to beginners when I notice that they are 
naturally &quot;corners-fixated&quot;.  Sometimes, when I need a break from 
speed-solving, but I still want to play with the cube, I just solve 
it over and over using &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Method&quot;, doing it as intuitively as 
possible.

          <div class="email-content">Wow, that is almost exactly like my solution. I think it is very 
good and fairly fast- good for a beginner. You would need to learn a 
fourth algorithm to cycle through the last edged to solve it but 
that is easy -M U2 M&#x27; U2. I use about 15 to solve the corners 
faster, though. Because of it&#x27;s intuitiveness there is always room 
for improvement, it&#x27;s just a matter of how fast you can find pieces 
but like Mr. Rubik, my time seems to be stuck around 1 minute and I 
can&#x27;t seem to get below 50 seconds. I am trying to switch to Fidrich 
method but too many algorithms!!! AAHHHH!

person <br>
&gt; to solve it?  (heheh!)  <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I had heard a rumor that after a month he was only stuck on the <br>
last <br>
&gt; step, flipping two edges in place.  Supposedly when he finally <br>
solved <br>
&gt; it, he used this move:<br>
&gt; Rx U Rx U Rx U2 Lx U Lx U Lx U2  (where Rx means turning the middle-<br>
&gt; layer slice in between the R and L faces clockwise RELATIVE to R, <br>
and <br>
&gt; Lx means Rx inverse).  I had heard that this algorithm was <br>
&gt; called &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Maneuver&quot;, because it was the crux and final step <br>
of <br>
&gt; his solution.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I told him this story, and showed him the algorithm, and he said, <br>
in <br>
&gt; his heavy hungarian accent and typically stoic manner, &quot;Yes, eed-iz <br>
&gt; pozzible zat I invented zat.&quot;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I really recommend that you try this method - it&#x27;s SO much fun!  I <br>
&gt; often teach this to beginners when I notice that they are <br>
&gt; naturally &quot;corners-fixated&quot;.  Sometimes, when I need a break from <br>
&gt; speed-solving, but I still want to play with the cube, I just solve <br>
&gt; it over and over using &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Method&quot;, doing it as intuitively as <br>
&gt; possible.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Dan<br>
<br>
Not only is this method easy to learn, it translates into a good <br>
speed-method!  I use almost the same exact system, except that I have <br>
memorized all the LL corner possibilities (42).  And I can do the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Move in less than 2 seconds (12 moves with slice counting as <br>
1 move, and 18 moves counting slice as 2 moves.)  With this system I <br>
am currently averaging 25 seconds, and still improving (although very <br>
slowly).  Here is a website that goes into detail on that method:  <br>

Less than 2 secs for 18 moves is *very* fast. Have you got a video<br>

has anyone had any luck solving 2 cubes at once? i mean 1 in the left <br>

how about doing this blind?<br>

Phew!  <br>
<br>
David, some time before you joined (I think) Jessica posted a puzzle<br>
you may find interesting.  You can find it in the archives as message<br>
567, but I will paste it in here to save time.<br>
<br>
&quot;While solving the LL, I noticed one interesting position in the LL. <br>
After a simple 4-move commutator B&#x27;U&#x27;BU, you get the same position<br>
except on a different face - on B instead on U. I wonder what other<br>
solutions there might be for this problem and how this problem could<br>
be generalized. Ideas?&quot;<br>
<br>
At first no-one managed to solve it, so after a bit she posted an<br>
answer (of sorts) together with a further aspect to the puzzle<br>
(message 895).  I posted what I think is a proof (message 937) that<br>
completes all aspects of the puzzle, but maybe not?  Whatever: I<br>
thought you---and anyone else---may enjoy tackling it yourself.<br>

Yeah me too, I did find a shortcut to that move though. I find M 
U&#x27;(M U for all you right handed people) much easier th and M&#x27; U&#x27;(M&#x27; 
U) so instead of doing the U2 in the middle turn the bottom 2 layers 
of the cube instead and repeat the first half of the algorithm. This 
still doesn&#x27;t get me even close to two seconds. I&#x27;d like to video too

has anyone had any luck solving 2 cubes at once? i mean 1 in the left 
and 1 in the right at the same time...i guess that&#x27;s obviously what i

how about doing this blind?

or is this just stupidly impossible?

<br>
Hi Brent!<br>
I guess one measure of difficulty for the permutations is how long it takes <br>
actually to execute the algorithm, and in that sense I too find the F <br>
permutation to be one of the harder ones.  But another measure is how easy a <br>
permutation is to identify while finishing off the orientation algorithm <br>
that precedes it, and in that sense the F permutation is, I find, one of the <br>
easiest (perhaps because it is symmetrical, so has no inversion?)<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is the algorithm I used:<br>
<br>
L2F&#x27;L D2R&#x27;B R D2L B L F L&#x27;B&#x27;<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m left-handed; using what I see as standard notation (plus 2&#x27; means rotate <br>
the face anticlockwise), I do it:<br>
<br>
x&#x27; (L2 U&#x27;r U2&#x27;)(L&#x27;U l U2&#x27;r U) (L D L&#x27;U )<br>
right handed:<br>
y2x(R2&#x27;U l&#x27;U2 )(R U&#x27;r&#x27;U2 l&#x27;U&#x27;)(R&#x27;D&#x27;R U&#x27;)<br>
<br>
I have put brackets around parts where I need to shift grip, but I change my <br>
hold while doing the moves around it, so there is no need for any pause at <br>
all.  I trigger the down face at the end with my left ring finger.  I hope I <br>
have converted it to the right side correctly, but I havn&#x27;t checked it!<br>
<br>
Does anyone else do it this way?  How do others do the F permutation, which <br>
is awkward?  I would be really interested to know how other people do it, <br>
and what you think of the way I am doing it at the moment.  Anything to help <br>
shave a tenth of a second off my average ...<br>

          <div class="email-content">I used to hate this permutation, but now it&#x27;s among one of my 
favorites since Peter Jansen showed me a very fast way to perform it 
at the Dutch Cube Day. It&#x27;s also listed on his excellent site:

((R&#x27;U)(RU&#x27;R2))y&#x27;(R&#x27;U&#x27;RU)yx(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R2B&#x27;)

You have to do 2 cube rotations, but the moves in between are all 
standard triggers that can be performed very fast. My average 
execution time is about 2.5 seconds.

<br>
&gt; This solution is by far the most &quot;intuitive&quot; solution I know.  The <br>
&gt; only part that takes any sort of algorithm is the flipping/permuting <br>
&gt; of the LL corners, and the flipping of the middle layer edges.  Thus <br>
&gt; you only really need 3 algorithms.  In fact, you can even get by with <br>
&gt; one or two if you get lucky with the LL corner permutation (skipped <br>
&gt; 1/6) or the middle-layer edge flippage (skipped 1/8).<br>
<br>
I tried this and found I needed 1 algorithm. <br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t count the LL <br>
corners flipping and permuting as an algorithm, because it&#x27;s just the <br>
&quot;obvious&quot; stuff of first layer corner placing. I found that bringing a<br>
FL corner down on the right face and bringing it back on the front<br>
face switched two LL corners: R&#x27;D&#x27;R D FDF&#x27; Hardly an algorithm. I then<br>
used &quot;do a sequence then do it in reverse order brings it back the way<br>
it was&quot; to twirl pairs of corners. (same as orienting a corner on the<br>
FL): RU&#x27;R&#x27;URU&#x27;R&#x27; (first twirl) D RUR&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27; Would you count that as an<br>
algorithm (it&#x27;s not as if you have to memorize it or anything)?<br>
<br>
Then, I found I could use (RL&#x27;)F(R&#x27;L)D2(RL&#x27;)F(R&#x27;L) - cycle three edges<br>
on bottom face/flips adjacent positions - to finish the cube. This<br>
requires some carefull thinking and &quot;premoving&quot; (and because I have no<br>
patience, I also used the reverse of this algorithm, instead of doing<br>
it twice). <br>
<br>
Question: are the &quot;premove&quot; problems more complicated to work out than<br>
learning more algorithms? IOW, is this &quot;one alg&quot; solution easier for a<br>
beginner to learn (obviously not to perform with the instructions in<br>
front of him) than a 7 or 8 step alg?<br>
<br>
Greg<br>
<br>
p.s. If you don&#x27;t know what I mean by premove, perform<br>
F2U(R&#x27;L)F2(RL&#x27;)U&#x27;F2 on a solve cube to get to a position where you<br>
just need to cycle three edges *without* flipping to solve the cube.<br>
Seems like my *single* algorithm will no longer work? try premoving<br>
(LR&#x27;). It will now (with appropriate F and U sides)!.<br>
<br>
p.p.s I asked some time ago about lubing my cube, complaining about<br>
the bad times I was getting. I checked out speedcubing.com and I now<br>
have an acceptable cube (I don&#x27;t think it could possibly be used for a<br>
sub-twenty time, but I&#x27;ll live till then). As could be predicted, my<br>
times have gotten better: frequently sub-60 and once, a fluke 39. (non<br>
fluke, I got a 48.99) :)  <br>

What is an &quot;algorithm&quot; (i.e. a sequence of moves you don&#x27;t really
understand), and what is not? The answer may vary.
You can say you don&#x27;t need any &quot;magic move sequence&quot;, all you need is
basic commutators (that can 3-cycle corners or edges, or flip them)
and rigor (at least for the Megaminx, because a minor parity problem
could occur with the 3^3).
But I doubt a beginner would consider such a solution very easy. There
are a lot of moves and tricks that seem obvious to the experienced
cuber, but out of reach for beginners because they require a deeper
understanding of the cube&#x27;s psychology. That&#x27;s why I consider a method
with a moderate number of magic sequences (5) is a good way to start.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Lars. This is not my fastest permutation, but it&#x27;s the one I 
like the most. I use the alg Lars mentioned. 
If you are lefthanded you can try this:

(LU&#x27;)(L&#x27;UL2)y(LUL&#x27;U&#x27;)y&#x27;x(L&#x27;U&#x27;LUL2B)

or

(L&#x27;U)(LU&#x27;L2)y&#x27;(L&#x27;U&#x27;LU)yx&#x27;(LUL&#x27;U&#x27;L2F&#x27;)

I think both algs can be done in 2-2,5 seconds

You should find an alg you like and learn that one. Relearning takes 
a lot of time.

          <div class="email-content">A few months ago there were some posts on white noise and its <br>
positive effects while cubing.  While listening to white noise i <br>
noticed it sounds a lot like static on the TV.  I&#x27;m sure that the <br>
frequencies between static noise and white noise do not differ <br>
greatly.  To support this idea I took four averages for comparison <br>
purposes.<br>
<br>
The first avg. was done in COMPLETE silence:<br>
&gt; 35.39<br>
The 2nd avg. was done while listenin to my fav. cubing music:<br>
&gt; 33.81<br>
The third avg. was done while listening to white noise:<br>
&gt; 34.45<br>
The fourth avg. was done while listening to static on the TV:<br>
&gt; 34.19<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t usually speedsolve in complete silence so it kind of threw <br>
me off.  My average was better while listening to the static on the <br>
TV than the white noise!  What does this mean?  probably nothing.  I <br>
guess its all a matter of personal opinion.  If anyone is interested <br>
in the my fav. speedcubing music, if you have kazaa, download: <br>
&gt; MatrixII trance mix (my favorite of all)<br>
&gt; Sandstorm<br>
&gt; Ameno<br>
&gt; Halloween dance mix<br>
&gt; Phantom of the opera techno remix<br>
 Like i said before, its all a matter of personal preference, but <br>
i&#x27;ve found that techno works pretty well as far as pace goes<br>

Thanks Lars. This is not my fastest permutation, but it&#x27;s the one I 
like the most. I use the alg Lars mentioned. 
If you are lefthanded you can try this:

(LU&#x27;)(L&#x27;UL2)y(LUL&#x27;U&#x27;)y&#x27;x(L&#x27;U&#x27;LUL2B)

or

(L&#x27;U)(LU&#x27;L2)y&#x27;(L&#x27;U&#x27;LU)yx&#x27;(LUL&#x27;U&#x27;L2F&#x27;)

I think both algs can be done in 2-2,5 seconds

You should find an alg you like and learn that one. Relearning takes 
a lot of time.

OK guys, I may be the fool of the group here, but I have no idea, and I thought about this.  I&#x27;ve been around some cubing stuff and books, and they said: &quot;This solving system can be solved using mathematics&quot;.  Now, HOW in the world can you solve it using mathematics.  Is there a site or something so I can learn how to solve it JUST using mathematics?  Or is there some master (many in this group im sure) than can show how this works?  I would love to learn how to solve a cube just using Physics/Mathematics.  Awesome stuff.<br>

Read the chapter about commutators.

&quot;Lets see how far the Cube could be solved by using only commutators.
It is fairly straightforward to find commutators that flip two edges,
or twist two corners. As conjugates of commutators are still
commutators, all the orientations can be solved using only
commutators. A three-cycle of edges or corners can also be done by
commutation, and so conjugates give every possible three-cycle. By 5.7
every even permutation of edges and every even permutation of corners
is possible. Commutators cannot generate odd permutations as it is
easily seen that every commutator is even. Therefore the Rubik&#x27;s Cube
can be solved completely using commutators only, except possibly for a
single quarter turn.&quot;

For example, if you want to flip 2 edges (UF and UR), you can do:
.        (RER2E2R) U&#x27; (RER2E2R)&#x27; U
i.e.     (RER2E2R) U&#x27; (R&#x27;E2R2E&#x27;R&#x27;) U
The (RER2E2R) that flips an U edge leaving all the other U cubies
intact is easy to imagine and remember.

Same kind of algs if you want to flip corners, or 3-cycle cubies.

Example of a naive 3-cycle edge permutation (UF, UR and UB):
.        (MSDS&#x27;D2M&#x27;) U (MSDS&#x27;D2M&#x27;)&#x27; U&#x27;
(MSDS&#x27;D2M&#x27;) permutes 2 U edges leaving all the other U cubies intact
(maybe you can think of more intuitive moves that reach the same goal).

Following the same technique, you can 3-cycle U corner-edge pairs too.
It&#x27;s like swapping 2 corners and 2 edges (minus a U move).
.    (LU&#x27;R(DE)2R&#x27;UL&#x27;) U (LU&#x27;R(DE)2R&#x27;UL&#x27;)&#x27; U&#x27;
==   (LU&#x27;R(DE)2R&#x27;UL&#x27;) U (LU&#x27;R(DE)2R&#x27;UL&#x27;) U&#x27;

It&#x27;s easy to see how and why it works. You&#x27;ve got a formula that looks
like  &quot; MovSeq U MovSeq&#x27; U&#x27; &quot;.
MovSeq makes a transformation of the U side and scrambles the rest of
the cube.
MovSeq&#x27; will make a similar transformation of the U side and restore
the rest of the cube, because the rest was not affected by the U move
preceding MovSeq&#x27;.

Powerful local transformations, all you need for blindfold cubing!


Gilles.


PS: I don&#x27;t know if this precisely answers your question. Is that
enough mathematical?..

Hi Simon,

   I just drove 83 miles.

   Learn to read traffic well. Drive as smoothly as possible. See how
centered in the lane you can be. See how few corrections you need on a
curve. Doing stuff like that, you know, that exercises your facilities
for looking ahead, pattern recognition, smoothness etc.

Hi Ryan,

   I like the first one especially. The B&#x27; B2 B2 B&#x27; spread through it
adds a bit to it &#x27;cause it&#x27;s uneven. There are interesting aspects to
single positions having multiple solutions.

   The inverse, sort of, to what you did applied to Simon&#x27;s solution
has a Star Wars feel to it: U2 b2 r2 D2 b2 r2 what with r2 D2 in the
middle. This is one of those where it doesn&#x27;t matter whether b2 or r2
goes first, U2 b2 r2 D2 r2 b2 does the same thing. Also U2 and D2 can
swap and can be done as the third and last moves instead of the first
and fourth moves.

Adam! Your first message wasn&#x27;t dumb at  all! If you speedcubers must 
speedcube, pull into a rest area, grab something to eat and drink, 
and indulge! But don&#x27;t do it while driving, when you attention should 
be on the driving. In a heavy traffic, when you have to stnd a long

well, i drive around town all day for a living. and i always have a 
cube sitting in the cup holder. either a 3 or a 4...but always one of 
them. and i find i&#x27;m sometimes wishing that i don&#x27;t make the light so 
i have a chance to cube for a minute! and, as mentioned already, one 
handed cubing is great to practice, as long as it&#x27;s the moves you 
memorized at the previous light.

as far as tickets: i once got out of a ticket because my cube.
when the officer asked to see my license, he noticed my cube and made 
the usual comment, &quot;i haven&#x27;t seen one of those in years!&quot;
he asked if i&#x27;d solved it yet, and i offered to show him.
he let me go.

          <div class="email-content">My brother is starting to get into cubing, so I tried to find one all <br>
over my town; they either didn&#x27;t have it or &quot;were out of stock&quot;.<br>
<br>
So I bought the only thing left, a no-name &quot;Magic Cube&quot;.<br>
<br>
It is, by far, the most horribly constructed mathematical shape ever <br>

<br>
I&#x27;ve lubed it, and it actually turns now, but unless it&#x27;s lined up <br>
perfectly it locks up.  I&#x27;m going to try to stretch the springs (if <br>
there are any).<br>
<br>
In any case, the stickers are just really stupid, and hard to see <br>
without really good light.<br>
<br>
The good news is it came with a miniature &quot;keychain&quot; Magic Cube, <br>
which is the SECOND most horribly constructed mathematical shape ever <br>

If anybody has any experience with these that doesn&#x27;t involve pelting <br>
them into the concrete in slow-turning-frustration, I&#x27;m open to ideas.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think i might have purchased the same exact thing at a walgreens.  
A normal cube and a mini cube with reflective stickers, incredibly 
stiff to turn but with one squirt of silicone loosens right up, jams 
if not alligned to the exact, cannot cut corners.  Yeah...
You probably don&#x27;t want to attempt streching the springs on that cube 
cause there aint any.  I tried that as well and ended up breaking off 
my center piece.  There are no springs just a plastic rod thingy.  
very cheap.  It probably would do ok for any beginer, but getting 
into speedcubing with that thing would be hard

          <div class="email-content">Nevermind.<br>
<br>
I tried to stretch the springs of the very cheap cube, and came to a <br>
horrible realization.<br>
<br>
It has no springs.<br>
<br>
It doesn&#x27;t even have any metal holding the middle cube in; it had <br>
(yes, past tense...you know where this is going) little plastic <br>
things holding it in.<br>
<br>
Needles to say, with two vicegrips trying to bend them a bit, it <br>
snapped like a twig.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a shame, because when properly aligned, it was actually turning <br>
very well; as well as a cube with ball bearings would probably spin.<br>
<br>
The only problem was the alignment thing...oh well; maybe this will <br>
make an interesting DIYer; I&#x27;ve never modded a cube before, so it <br>
could be interesting.<br>
<br>
thanks anyhoo.<br>
