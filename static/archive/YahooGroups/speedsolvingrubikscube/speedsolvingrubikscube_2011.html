      <div class="email-content">
        Hello fellow cube fans! I have posted a series of instructional videos
        at YouTube about how to solve very large cubes (I used a 19x19x19, but
        the ideas would apply to even cubes too) very rapidly. I&#x27;m using
        the Gabbasoft software. My best solve of a 19x19x19 is under 1 hour:53
        minutes. The solve shown is around 2:20. I need a faster computer, and
        the screen grab software slows things down a lot. No excuses, I think
        2:20 is a pretty decent time. :-) The series starts with this video
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ediiiaBedd8&amp;feature=related If that
        link doesn&#x27;t work, just search for &quot;Solving Large Cubes
        Quickly&quot; on Youtube. Please enjoy and comment if you have even
        faster methods. I&#x27;m playing around with the super cube version
        (with the arrows), and have gotten a little bit stuck on fixing the last
        face. I end up with this shape in the middle (even cube). ______________
        | &lt;- | -> | | | | ______________ | | | | | | V | V | ______________
        Anyone have a move to fix this? Also, I have seen pictures like this
        one: http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/images/20cubestart.gif around the
        internet, but I can&#x27;t find that program. Does someone have a
        pointer to that program? Thanks!! -Kelly

        Hello, dyllanusher, Â  Bare Necessities: 1) You need a good speedcubing
        cube. Store boughts are ok until they become a piece of junk. Not the
        best way to invest money. I suggest www.cube4you.com, or some other
        place 2) You need a method.Â Iprefer and suggest Frindrich but whatever
        floats your boat. Go to www.cubefreak.net . There&#x27;s stuff there.
        3)Dedication 4)Practice 5)There is no number 5 6)Number 5 is the most
        important 7)Fingertricks come after you&#x27;ve gotten the basics down.
        And you discover a lot of tricks yourself throughout your journey with
        the cube. Â  for more help, go to www.speedsolving.comÂ .There&#x27;s not
        many people still here on this email thread, but the forum is much alive
        and active. Â  Happy cubing! Sim Â  From: dyllanusher

        The one recommended below is decent, however, it tells you to solve the
        cube from the top down and you should really have her do it from the
        bottom layer up. Attached is the official Rubikâs âYou can do the cubeâ
        instructions. Also, below is a link to the website where this solution
        guide is. This is a good one that I have given to a couple friends that
        have learned from it.

        Hi Dave, Sorry for randomly jumping into the discussion, but since
        I&#x27;m this group, I&#x27;d like to help. So before we say any
        algorithms for the cross, and if I understood your question correctly,
        you should know that the cross can indeed be done intuitively. But if
        you&#x27;re one that needs algs to carry you through, I&#x27;m more than
        happy to tell you. I would recommend this website, for it helps to solve
        intuitively or, if you understand th3e page and the geography of the
        cube: http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine/rubikscubesolution.html But
        here&#x27;s the algorithm if you really need one: 1) Match corresponding
        edge piece&#x27;s adjacent color (i.e. if you&#x27;re solving the red
        side, then you would find a red edge with, say, a yellow edge) to its
        corresponding center. 2) If already matched, then move it straight up to
        its spot with both colors of the edge matched with their centers. 3) If
        the colors are switched when you move the piece up (i.e. the red and
        yellow ought to match, and this case, the red side of the edge is next
        to the yellow center, and the yellow side is next to the red center),
        then use this algorithm: F&#x27;UL&#x27;U&#x27;. That should do it! Use
        those steps again to finish the cross! I hope I helped, and if it&#x27;s
        unclear in any way or fashion, please post back so I can make it clear
        for you! Thanks! Paul --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,
