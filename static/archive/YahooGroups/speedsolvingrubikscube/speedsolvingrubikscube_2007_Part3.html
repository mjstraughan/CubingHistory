          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, I have a great idea for &#x27;chain solving&#x27; and I would <br>
like some feedback.<br>
<br>
It is similar to Hardwick&#x27;s beginner method for edge pairing, but it <br>
solves two edges at once. First, you set up with the pair to be <br>
paired on F. One part is on (uL) slice and the other is on (dR) <br>
slice. I solve it using something I call the &quot;break and restore&quot; <br>
principle, which many cubers should know: break something, do <br>
something useful, the replace it with something not useful, then <br>
restore it. The alg for the &quot;break and restore&quot; would be (Uu&#x27; R U R&#x27; <br>
Uu) and what it does is it solves the above mentioned edge and <br>
brings the bU edge into F.<br>
<br>
Solving two edge pairs using this is simple. Set up the pair to be <br>
solved, but look at the single edge under the (uL) slice. Lets call <br>
the pair to be solved X using the &quot;break and restore&quot; principle and <br>
the edge under the (uL) edge Ex and the second pair to be solved <br>
with Ex, 2x, which is in bU.<br>
<br>
We look at X and use &quot;break and restore&quot;. Before performing it, <br>
however, we should look at Ex and see what edge goes with it. We <br>
then set up 2x in its proper place (which is bU), and apply &quot;break <br>
and restore&quot;, which not only solves X but pairs up Ex and 2x. If no <br>
one understands, I can post a video...<br>
<br>
If you do read this, thanks for taking the time out of your summer <br>
vacation x].<br>

&gt; The only thing I look for is not having &quot;0 oriented edges&quot; for the LL.<br>

<br>
So what you mean is, learn to recognize when inserting the last F2L<br>

          <div class="email-content">I would not recommend using the entire VHF2L system as many of the &quot;2 edges
oriented&quot; cases can be done very quickly.
I would just recommend you to avoid the &quot;0 edges oriented&quot; if you haven&#x27;t
practiced any of the cases.
Some of these are really fast, but some aren&#x27;t.

So unless you are able to tell if you will get a fast or a slow &#x27;0 edges
oriented&#x27; OLL, I recommend you to avoid them completely.

That&#x27;s pretty awesome.  If you have any questions, I&#x27;d be willing to
answer them.  I just did a writing assignment on the 1982 world
championships, which was pretty fun.  Had to present it to the class,
and I delivered my conclusion while solving one-handed.  A real
crowd-pleaser.

get your 195 in darkness or bright light? And does it at some point

even though it was fun for an evening, I&#x27;d rather practice with the

prove that this can never lead to a cube state that can alternatively 
be solved with an odd number of swaps. Jaap has a proof that I like 
better:

No, that solves PLL-parity + orients the two dedges. But uses far to 
many turns. That case is best solved using:

x&#x27; U l+r&#x27;+R&#x27; U x&#x27; &quot;PLL-parity&quot; x U&#x27; l&#x27;+r+R U&#x27; x

Three set up turns + cube orientations at first (l+r&#x27;+R&#x27; is at three 
layer turn), then you do PLL-parity and then undo the set ups.

To solve OLL-parity using my alg you must use some diffrent set ups 
than the ones I&#x27;m using in the &quot;two opposite swap&quot; alg above.

My OLL-parity alg looks like this:

F2 l2 F2 U2 l&#x27; U2 l U2 l2 F2 r&#x27; F2 r U2 l&#x27;

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m sorry, but in most tools/libraries, big numbers are indeed<br>
implemented using arrays (or buffer if you prefer to call them like<br>
that). The fact that the implementation details are hidden and<br>
the jobs done for you doesn&#x27;t change anything, if not the<br>
knowledge of how it works under the hood.<br>
<br>
There is no need to trash someone like that, especially when<br>
what he said is not so stupid at all. If you want to complete his<br>
answer, go ahead, cite your sources, favorite libraries or<br>
languages. At least it would be more interesting than generalities<br>
such as &quot;many languages&quot; (and by the way, there are not so<br>
many mainstream languages which support big numbers<br>
_natively in the language itself_. It&#x27;s mostly provided as libraries<br>
- which &quot;surprisingly&quot; use buffer/array implementation for them).<br>
<br>
So yes, Mathematica, or Maple are good for stuff like that when<br>
you only need to compute some mathematic formula (in other<br>
words for maths oriented stuff, like the original subject of this<br>
thread). For more advanced programs, performance might be<br>
a problem (especially with Maple, which is slow as hell, IMHO)<br>
<br>
If we look at the mainstream languages, in C/C++ for example,<br>
libssl is widely used. OCaml provides Num and Big_int modules<br>
in their standard libraries (but if you look at the implementation,<br>
of course, it&#x27;s also implemented using buffer/array). Seems to<br>
be the same for ADA and perl (but I&#x27;m not an expert in these<br>
languages at all), and I can&#x27;t really talk about .net stuff (VB, C#,<br>
F#) but I would be surprised if it was supported natively in the<br>
language itself. Could you cite languages which support big<br>
numbers natively? (I&#x27;m genuinely interested to know).<br>
<br>
But anyway, there is no need for condescending comments<br>
like that. I&#x27;m sick of reading unnecessary flames every other day<br>
(but I have to admit that it has been quiet for a few weeks now,<br>
how refreshing!). I know we have a lot of young cubers in this<br>
ML, but damn, can&#x27;t we behave a little bit?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll finish my rant by re-using your style (if I may):<br>
I would suggest you learn some more social skills instead of<br>
advertising uneducated and immature ones not suited for pleasant<br>
interactions with other peoples on an ML.<br>
<br>
Ok, let&#x27;s finish on a funny tone<br>

I was planning to host one around my place (Allentown, PA)
unofficially around late fall or early winter... I may try to push to
make it official, if enough people would be willing to come.

This doesn&#x27;t really help, does it? XD

Yeah, I did it in the dark :) It would have been much more but for a
lapse in concentration. It does get to a point where it no longer
increases in speed, and in the dark is quite easy to keep up.

57 is awesome, my best was 48 :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan!

So what if some languages do support infinitely large integers? Not 
all languages do. It&#x27;s not archaic nor useless to know of a simple 
way to do it in languages/tools that do not support it off the shelf. 
Geez!! That&#x27;s like saying it&#x27;s pointless to learn the cube yourself 
when there are solutions out there :-P I thought you were an advocat 
of coming up with own solutions??

If you had read my later posts i did mention that Java has Biginteger 
class, and that Mathcad or Mathematica is better for the job ;-)

Also, sometimes it&#x27;s the solution process that is fun. Not the 
solution in and by itself.

What&#x27;s the fun in giving Mathematica the formula for positions on 
cube size n and ask it for which n&lt;k will n-1 be prime? None in my 
opinion. Finding it myself is fun, but slower ;-)

It seems like i just don&#x27;t care too much for spelling.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan :-)

I agree that your &quot;proofs&quot; on that pages are mostly indicative and 
not conclusive. When you discuss number of swaps you must distinguish 
clearly between the different kinds of cubies. An outer single step 
turn is odd (on swaps) on corners and odd on edges, but the totality 
is even when mixing all diff kinds of cubies together.

A thorough analysis, distinguishing the different kinds of cubies, 
will explain why the orientation parity is possible on the revenge 
cube. With your simplified &quot;proof&quot; it would seem actually 
impossible :-o

Have fun!

The 57 was in semi-darkness, in bright light (in the place you see in 
the video) I believe I got to 48, too, with the method in the video. 
One of my methods that I think is good for a bright environment is to 
hold white and yellow on the sides almost covered with your palms to 
somewhat &quot;create&quot; darkness around them even in a bright room. Then 
you see their light on your palms and the other four lights by doing 
x-rotations.

Cheers!

Yes, if you&#x27;re a library/tool implementer or an interested <br>

&gt; I&#x27;m sorry, but in most tools/libraries, big numbers are indeed<br>
&gt; implemented using arrays (or buffer if you prefer to call them like<br>
&gt; that). The fact that the implementation details are hidden and<br>
&gt; the jobs done for you doesn&#x27;t change anything, if not the<br>
&gt; knowledge of how it works under the hood.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There is no need to trash someone like that, especially when<br>
&gt; what he said is not so stupid at all. If you want to complete his<br>
&gt; answer, go ahead, cite your sources, favorite libraries or<br>
&gt; languages. At least it would be more interesting than generalities<br>
&gt; such as &quot;many languages&quot; (and by the way, there are not so<br>
&gt; many mainstream languages which support big numbers<br>
&gt; _natively in the language itself_. It&#x27;s mostly provided as libraries<br>
&gt; - which &quot;surprisingly&quot; use buffer/array implementation for them).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So yes, Mathematica, or Maple are good for stuff like that when<br>
&gt; you only need to compute some mathematic formula (in other<br>
&gt; words for maths oriented stuff, like the original subject of this<br>
&gt; thread). For more advanced programs, performance might be<br>
&gt; a problem (especially with Maple, which is slow as hell, IMHO)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If we look at the mainstream languages, in C/C++ for example,<br>
&gt; libssl is widely used. OCaml provides Num and Big_int modules<br>
&gt; in their standard libraries (but if you look at the implementation,<br>
&gt; of course, it&#x27;s also implemented using buffer/array). Seems to<br>
&gt; be the same for ADA and perl (but I&#x27;m not an expert in these<br>
&gt; languages at all), and I can&#x27;t really talk about .net stuff (VB, C#,<br>
&gt; F#) but I would be surprised if it was supported natively in the<br>
&gt; language itself. Could you cite languages which support big<br>
&gt; numbers natively? (I&#x27;m genuinely interested to know).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But anyway, there is no need for condescending comments<br>
&gt; like that. I&#x27;m sick of reading unnecessary flames every other day<br>
&gt; (but I have to admit that it has been quiet for a few weeks now,<br>
&gt; how refreshing!). I know we have a lot of young cubers in this<br>
&gt; ML, but damn, can&#x27;t we behave a little bit?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ll finish my rant by re-using your style (if I may):<br>
&gt; I would suggest you learn some more social skills instead of<br>

          <div class="email-content">My reply was more a comment to the stuff on the page Stefan referred 
to. Indeed in later post u admit it&#x27;s not a proof.

By inconclusive proof i mean a proof which is not &quot;generalisable&quot;. 
Like a proof that says something about a car but not about all 
vehicles in general for instance. Not an excellent example btw. So 
yes i actually meant its not a proof.

False, incorrect analogy. For cubers it&#x27;s worthwhile to solve the 
cube on their own. For programmers it&#x27;s worthwhile to do programming 
stuff on their own. Why you suggest programming big integers to a 
cuber, that&#x27;s not clear to me.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

There may be reasons why a programmer (who may also be a cuber) HAS 
to stick to one language and not swap to another language just to 
solve one problem (in this case HUGE integers). This may result in 
more problems than it solves. It&#x27;s not useless to have at least some 
idea about how external libraries may have been coded. I was 
suggesting about arrays for representig huge integers as a way that 
will work in general in every language that i know. I guess any 
language that does not even have arrays is capable of making some 
class coded w basic features that will emulate arrays. How efficient 
this will be may vary. Maybe i was naive in thinking that solving the 
problem was fun. Especially if one is just in interested in the 
answer anyway ...

 I live in South Pasadena, CA, and you can contact me via email at<br>

As for where this money is going: basically, I need to break even.<br>

Of course it&#x27;s inefficient to use datatype integer for each element 
of the array. Better would be byte or smallint or equivalent, 
otherwise much space (and speed) is wasted. Use of hexadecimal 
numbers is elegant but less intuitive unless you are mathematically

To fill in the gap here (and hopefully correct) you mean that it&#x27;s not 
about what type of value is stored, but how the calculation is done. 
Using hex or binary a base 16 or base 2 can be used, which makes it as 
efficient as possible for a machine that cna only work in binary.

Likewise for a human the most efficient method is to work in the 
decimal system (if you use your 10 fingers that is).

>From a machine point of view: The early Crays (and I would assume
later ones too) had units that could do base 10 just as fast as base
16... . Yes, I know, this doesn&#x27;t apply to the computers 99.99% of the
population has access to, but still...

>From a programmer&#x27;s point of view: A library that has been around for
a long time has probably been tweaked tremendously and could probably
do base 10 faster (doing it in base 16 first and then converting) than
a lot of programmers could program the same algorithms in base 16...

As for using bytes or smallints, it&#x27;s wrong to use those instead
because lots of commonly used CPUs do a lot of operations on 8-bit,
16-bit, 32-bit, etc. units at the same speed. So doing it on 8-bit
units would be 4 times slower than doing the same operation on 32-bit
units. In addition, SOME CPUs actually are slower on units that are
smaller than their &quot;native word&quot; size...

There&#x27;s a lot more to it, but this should clear things up sufficiently.

That alg is based on a diffrent version of the &quot;second layer J-PLL&quot;. 
This morning I worked out a OLL-parity that is based on the same 
moves as my 12 move two piece swap im the first post of this thread. 
This new alg is also a 15 turn thing and looks like this:

r2 B2 D2 r&#x27; D2 l D2 l&#x27; D2 B2 l&#x27; B2 r&#x27; B2 r2

It seems 15 turns is the shortest alg for the OLL-parity. I have 
found two of them and there are some others, wery simmilair to those 
I found knowned before of the same length but non shorter. Maybe if 
you can find a variation that does the moves U2 and D2 (or likwise) 
in sequence, then you can change those to a E2 and that way reach 14 
turns. But I think there are no more ways to get below 15 turns.

// Kenneth

BTW: That diffrent version of the &quot;second layer J-PLL&quot; looks like 
this : F2 D2 r D2 r&#x27; D2 l D2 l&#x27; D2 F2

          <div class="email-content">I was thinking mostly in terms of wasted storage. 4 byte spent for 
each integer versus only 1 byte (or less if using compression

most systems, but even then space is wasted if using integer vs byte

Hmmm, i had no idea using byte/smallint would be up to 4 times slower 
versus integer. So that means we would sacrifice speed to be able 
deal with even larger integer representations. Today memory is cheap 
so then using smaller datatypes does seem like a waste. Then i learnt 
something ;-)

I suggest we stop this topic here it&#x27;s WAY off topic :D

          <div class="email-content">  I think you are a little bit confused about this.

I&#x27;m not quite sure what you guys meant with base-10 and
base-16/2 computations.
A computer is a binary machine, base-10 doesn&#x27;t mean much for it
unless you simulate it. Base 16 is closely related to base-2 so we
can just assume it&#x27;s the same. It&#x27;s just a faster way of writing it  
_for us_
as human, on a piece of paper.

Now, back to the storage. You don&#x27;t waste anything by using 4byte
instead of 1. On most computer 1byte = 8bit. Hence you can store
a value up to 255. On 4 byte you&#x27;ll store up to 2^32-1.

Of course, you&#x27;re not going to store the number 1911 as:
[1, 9, 1, 1] using 4 byte and using a base-10 representation. That
would be quite naive and inefficient. In this particular case, 1911
is 777h, so you&#x27;ll just use 16bit or 2byte to store this value. You
really need only 11bit but since it&#x27;s not a multiple of 8, it&#x27;s not very
pratical.

In other words, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you are using an array
of 4byte or 1byte, because you&#x27;ll use all of it anyway. If you use an
array of 4byte per element, you&#x27;re just not going to use the 2nd element
before the first one is completely full. Said differently, it&#x27;s just all
memory, and using an array is just a practical way of representing a
bitstream.

8bit, can represent up to 2^8-1, if you add 1bit you can now  
represent the
number 2^9-1, if you had another bit... Computing big numbers on
a computer is just a matter of reserving a block of memory which
contains enough bit to represent the big number. And this block of
memory is just manipulated as an array. I hope I&#x27;m clear on the
explanation.

Now, there is in fact a difference in using an array of 4byte vs. 4byte.
The memory usage will still be the same (because the memory is
allocated to have an certain number of bit anyway), but instead of
accessing part of this big number and manipulating it using 1byte
chunk, it&#x27;s faster to do so using 4byte chunk (or even 8byte chunk
on 64bit computer), because the computer internally is anyway
going to really manipulate 4byte numbers.

I hope it clarifies, (but we are way off-topic on this thread)

In the naive implementation one would do something like this:

bignumber = array[size] of datatype; //holds up to *size* digits 
integer

For this simple scheme the datatype directly affects how much total 
storage is going to be used. Of course there are clever ways to hold 
more information into the datatype than the naive representation 
allows.

If people just want to know the answer to Chris&#x27; question use 
Mathematica. If they want to have fun implement their own biginteger 
class and own primality checks!!

I think it is interesting to see the different methods of how to
handle larger numbers in computation.  I still have a question though,
which Lucas did a lot to help answer already.

Here is the part of one of Lucas&#x27; posts that I am referring to:

What has me curious is the idea of a way to prove whether or not there
are an infinite number of Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constant primes (to use
Lucas&#x27; term here since it is much shorter).

I mean can we assume that there are a finite number of Scrambled
Rubik&#x27;s constant primes and try to lead that to a contradiction?  I
haven&#x27;t really studied number theory with much rigor, other than what
I saw in my combinatorics class about using modular arithmetic with
prime numbers for code breaking and such, and just little things I&#x27;ve
learned here and there.

Can anyone suggest any reading I could do to try to learn more about
primes?  Is the level of this Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constant prime problem
so difficult it would probably require a math PhD or University
researcher to figure out, or could an amateur math enthusiast like me
sketch out a proof using contradiction or some other more rudimentary
method?

That is my main question really.  What I am concerned about is whether
or not there are an infinite number of Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constant
primes or a finite number.  If there are a finite number I would find
that absolutely fascinating, and would also be curious as to exactly
how many there are.

Yes I know I am asking a lot of questions, but I find this topic
fascinating.

Bah!, I continue =)

The Motorola MC68x00 family processors has got a built in &quot;BCD&quot; format 
BCD = &quot;binary coded decimal&quot;. The format is splitting the bytes into 
nibbles and stores a decimal number in each of them = two decimals per 
byte (basicly hex digits but only using numbers 0-9). It also has got 
special instructions for handling arithmetics on these.

Maybe not fast as binary operations but pretty OK and it saves memory.

1) The number of Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constant primes is infinite

It seems as if this would be the case, but as this is a conjecture I 
obviously have no proof of it, which is what I am interested in 
trying to find.

Maybe this would relate to the conjecture that the Mersenne primes 
are infinite.  Mersenne primes are 1 away from a highly divisible 
number, which is what happens for Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constant primes.

I am writing this as my conjecture half as a joke respone to Per&#x27;s 
comment, but I seriously do want to know the answer to this 
question.  So I guess in a sense I really am serious, is there a way 
to prove whether my conjecture is true or false?  Would it be shown 
in a similar way to any approach to prove that the Mersenne primes 
are infinite, assuming this conjecture is ever proved in our 
lifetime?

Depends on the operation. Addition and subtraction indeed would take 
four times as much time because they obviously have linear 
complexity. But if you&#x27;re doing multiplication or division, the 
factor increases, to 16 in case of the naive algorithm (the one we 
learned in elementary school, with quadratic complexity), less in 
case of better algorithms like Karatsuba and very large numbers. I&#x27;m 
not sure about division/roots/etc, but it could be even more costly. 
Since most interesting stuff you want to do with large numbers is not 
just addition and subtraction but also includes multiplication and 
division, the overall runtime is dominated by those slower 
operations. Thus for the normal programmer implementing just the 
simple elementary school algorithms, expect a time factor somewhat 
close to 16 if you choose 8-bit digits instead of 32-bit digits.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I mean can we assume that there are a finite number of Scrambled<br>
&gt; Rubik&#x27;s constant primes and try to lead that to a contradiction?  I<br>
&gt; haven&#x27;t really studied number theory with much rigor, other than what<br>
&gt; I saw in my combinatorics class about using modular arithmetic with<br>
&gt; prime numbers for code breaking and such, and just little things I&#x27;ve<br>
&gt; learned here and there.<br>
I really don&#x27;t think so. I really, really, really, really think that the <br>
Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constants are not anything special except each being 1 <br>
less than a number highly divisible by primes up to 23 (and having a few <br>
other definitional properties). That, of course, suggests that especially <br>
the lower numbers are more likely to be prime, of which three are...<br>
Number theory really seems useless for this; group theory and general cube <br>
theory seem like they have more to say (about each individual n).<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;re wondering why I have such a strong negative opinion on this, look <br>
at Mersenne primes, for example:<br>
They&#x27;re also (large products)-1, and only because of their power-of-2 <br>
structure (I think) is there a reasonably good recursive test for primality. <br>
(GIMPS, anyone? I&#x27;m checking 2^37,534,969-1 :-)<br>
But no one has been able to do any proofs by contradiction, infinite <br>
descent, induction, or anything else, conclusively proving their abundance <br>
(finite or infinite).<br>
And if mathematicians considering these &quot;nice&quot; numbers for years have not <br>
been able to do anything, is there any reason to believe we can find <br>
something here?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d advocate working either on the constants themselves, or primality <br>
checks/factoring in general. Does Jaap have any good ideas?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; That is my main question really.  What I am concerned about is whether<br>
&gt; or not there are an infinite number of Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constant<br>
&gt; primes or a finite number.  If there are a finite number I would find<br>
&gt; that absolutely fascinating, and would also be curious as to exactly<br>
&gt; how many there are.<br>
Keep in mind that the number may either be finite or infinite, though that <br>
may actually be impossible to prove.<br>
(Who else loves &quot;Gï¿½del, Escher, Bach&quot;?)<br>
I don&#x27;t actually think it is impossible, but in math nowadays you can <br>
certainly be more certain about being uncertain than ever before :-)<br>
<br>
My statement of &quot;definitely NOT&quot; depends on a little assumption about the <br>
relative normality of Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constants -but considering that I&#x27;ve <br>
never encountered good number-theoretical stuff like this, I don&#x27;t think <br>
that reasoning is justifiable enough.<br>
See http://www.mersenne.org/math.htm, which links to <br>
http://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/NextMersenne.html. Both have some good <br>
observations about Mersenne primes, but nothing there is actually proven...<br>
<br>
<br>
On another note, I investigated whether any Rubik&#x27;s Constant (without <br>
the -1) is the product of others. This is not implausible, since they&#x27;re all <br>
only divisible by the primes up to 23. But the answer is no:<br>
The highest power of 2 in the nth constant is:  Cu[n,2] = -14 - 26*n + <br>
(35*n^2)/2 + 23*Mod[n, 2]<br>
The highest power of 13 (and 17, 19, and 23) in the nth constant is: <br>
Cu[n,13] = Floor[(-2*n + n^2)/4]<br>
(=Cu[n,17] =Cu[n,19] =Cu[n,23])<br>
The ratio of Cu[n,2]/Cu[n,13] steadily declines toward 4 as n increases (if <br>
you&#x27;re troubled by that this is infinite for n=2 and n=3, take the <br>
reciprocal and invert the argument tha way). For the product of several <br>
constants (c[1], c[2], c[3], c[4]...) to equal another (x), the sum of all <br>
the Cu[c[i],13]  must equal Cu[x,13]. However, since Cu[n,2]/Cu[n,13] <br>
decreases, the sum of the Cu[c[i],2] will be larger than that of Cu[x,2] <br>
(for each amount of &quot;three&quot;, there will be more &quot;two&quot; in each of the <br>
products than can in total fit into x). So, the powers of  2 and the powers <br>
of 13 in a product of Rubik&#x27;s Constants can never both match those of <br>
another, and no product of Rubik&#x27;s Constants can equal another at.<br>
(And this proof IS correct - no guesses or assumptions here)<br>
<br>
Still open is if the product of one set of constants can equal that of <br>
another.<br>
If someone wants the factorizations of the constants up to some large n (the <br>
rows are the exponents of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23, delimited by <br>

Thanx for the info. How will we know whether we are buying the old or 
new version (if from a local store). Will there be yet another new 
packaging or at least a sticker indicating it&#x27;s the new version? 
Hmm ...

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

1) I would prefer Twin Cities.  I myself live in Shoreview; The Twin
Cities would be about 20 or so minutes, vs 1+ hour.

3)I *would* be willing to scramble/judge, but only if I got to do so
in addition to compete.

4)What events?  Hmm, I&#x27;m quite amateur at solving twisty-type puzzles
now, so at least for me, all I would like to see is the classic 3x3x3.
 I am starting to learn blindfold solving, so that event would be nice
too, even if I am not competing [that is, if someone can actually
blindfold solve here in the states.]

You might want to make another post at Twistypuzzles.com &#x27;s forum,
because I know there&#x27;s a handful of members there.

Anyway, keep me posting at Tranceriver [at] Gmail.com and let me know
what happens.

scramble.)<br>
<br>
1) I saw Dan&#x27;s F2LExample video located here:<br>
http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/videos/F2LExamples1.wmv ; and he<br>
scrambles .. unbelievably quickly.<br>
<br>
2) Here&#x27;s another video which the cube just scrambles like magic:<br>
http://youtube.com/watch?v=gM4Cy4lQXJ8 (I know this isn&#x27;t a real<br>
scramble.)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure exactly how &#x27;teachable&#x27; this is, but could someone<br>
provide some general algorithms or &#x27;nice&#x27; finger tricks that flow<br>
really well together? Tips on how to make the cube look like it&#x27;s<br>
scrambling *really* quickly?  Video tutorial or something?<br>
<br>
Some of my &#x27;scrambling&#x27; short-snippits type finger trick mixing<br>
algorithms go sort of like:<br>
<br>
[D R&#x27; D U] done in the Z-perm way like Dan Knight&#x27;s alg ;<br>
<br>
[R&#x27; U R&#x27; U] finger trick followthrough with pinky on last U<br>

I mess around with stuff like a bunch of M&#x27;s with my third right<br>

random U&#x27;s and U2&#x27;s done with my left index.  I mix these up in a<br>
random sense which<br>
gives me a random scramble.<br>
<br>
I hope this is making some sense.  So if someone could give me some<br>
tips or things like that, that would be excellent.  I see some people<br>
scrambling the cube extremely fast, and I&#x27;d love to be able to do<br>
that.  Perhaps some finger tricks that run extremely smoothly together<br>
without any regrips and that uses all faces to look like the cube is<br>
being 100% completely mixed?<br>

          <div class="email-content">What does a high school speedcuber do in his spare time during summer? Help other speedcubers, even though he isn&#x27;t the best.
   
  I use the tips of my fingers to scramble. Whenver I scramble, people&#x27;s jaws just drop down (I love seeing that). I scramble with my right fingers and hold with my left hand. Have your right thumb on FE on the R slice and your ring, middle, and forefinger on B in the natural hand position. Do the same with your left hand on L. An &quot;algorithm&quot; I use is (U D&#x27; R&#x27; F R) and repeat it as many times as I feel like doing. Once in a while, I regrip and repeat. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll add some U&#x27;, L, or do something with my left hand. Sometimes, I do l (thats lowercase L), do my &quot;algorithm&quot;, and repeat. Regrip, etc. You get the idea.
   
  For my fingers, I use my right forefinger for U. I then follow through with my ring finger with D&#x27; and immedieatly do R&#x27;. Near the end of R&#x27; I use my forefinger and pull F, then turn back to R using my whole wrist. I repeat, then regrip whatever way, add some stuff with my left hand, etc.
   
  You can also do this with your left hand: just mirror whatever was described. I do it on my right because I&#x27;m right handed. Hope it helped.

large venue if there&#x27;s not that many people, because that would hurt<br>
our chances for subsequent events).  Besides, it&#x27;s only an hour drive,<br>
and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s too much of a sacrifice for people to drive.<br>
 <br>
&gt; You might want to make another post at Twistypuzzles.com &#x27;s forum,<br>

value (I have experimented with them all).
It functions fine on a PC though, and with the default stackmat value.
What OS are you running?

The issue with the mac is a strange one.
CCT only recognizes the stackmat with values of 1-7,
and even then it flips out, displaying and recording many seemingly random
numbers.
This happens both when the 15.165.165 checkbox is on and off, regardless.

Of course, this may be superfluous, depending on your OS.

rotation (rotating as though doing F).  Quite often I&#x27;ll do a U2 D&#x27; 
by doing U&#x27; D&#x27; at once with my left index on U&#x27; and right ring on D&#x27; 
then doing the other U&#x27; while I regrip for an R&#x27; F or something with 
my right hand.  Often I&#x27;ll end with an R2 since I usually let go of 
the cube with my right hand after doing that (depending on my grip), 
and then I can just hold it with my left and look at it.

I&#x27;d never really thought about that before.  This kind of stuff is 
really individual to each cuber and what kind of moves they like 
doing.  I&#x27;d say just do a bunch of algorithms and see what 
fingertricks flow nicely for you.

Is your stackmat the new one that can store best times in memory?

Strange.  I&#x27;ve not tried CCT on Linux yet.
Anybody have comments?

If you receive no help here, e-mail Ryan at cubetimer@...
He may have a solution.

I know it doesn&#x27;t really help your cause, but I have the stackmat with
the time/date displays and the memory, and I had no problems getting
it to work, didn&#x27;t have to change anything.

But at least you know it does work.

I tried everything including that. But it would only help my brother if 
it worked. My problem is that it does not select any sond capture 
channel for me and it does not respond to my manual settings, as i 
mentioned i my previous post. Dunno what to do about that.

It turns out that the Linux driver has issues with microphone sound

Shelley,
I&#x27;m glad to hear that you got it functioning under Windows. As I 
heard mentioned, any problems people are having are probably due to 
driver issues. I believe that soundcard drivers can get away with 
altering the signal in ways imperceptible to the human ear, but still 
mangling the signal in ways such that our program can&#x27;t handle. This 
is a difficult problem for Ryan and I to fix, since we don&#x27;t have the 
resources to test hundreds of soundcards. Ideally, we would develop 
some sort of USB connection with our own driver. This would hopefully 
eliminate many of the problems people have encountered. Don&#x27;t think 
we haven&#x27;t looked into it! As an interesting project for anyone 
looking for something to do, I noticed about a year ago that the 
stackmat&#x27;s communication port is exactly the same as the comm. port 
for a TI-83 plus. TI sells (sold?) a silver USB cable for $20 (gah!) 
that I gave to Ryan. He spent last winter break trying to adapt the 
cable for use in our program. We figured interpreting the signal 
would be easy, since we had already &quot;cracked the code&quot;. 
Unfortunately, we were never able to get any sort of raw data from 
the stackmat with the cable, not that we really knew what we were 
doing. Java has very limited USB support. Anyone with the cable, a 
stackmat, and some computer knowledge could spend some time figuring 
out how to get raw data from the stackmat. If you figure out how to 
do so (on any OS), let us know! I&#x27;d be glad to add support for such a 
feature to CCT.

Jeremy Fleischman

PS: For people who are unable to get CCT working with their stackmat, 
there are USB soundcards you can buy. This eliminates some of the 
variables in your setup, if you&#x27;d like to try to buy one. Ryan has 
some that are known to work on both his and my computer, in various 
OS&#x27;s. I&#x27;ll ask him to post the make/model here.

          <div class="email-content">I<br>
am currently studying Mr. Ryan Heise&#x27;s method in solving the cube. The<br>
method that I used before shifting into this one was the Fridrich<br>
method. I managed to memorize all the algorithms for PLL and OLL, but I<br>
had to play with the cube often so as not to forget the algorithms.<br>
That seemed to be one of my sickness. Because of that, I decided to<br>
learn a method that would allow me to solve the cube without the help<br>
of any memorized sequences of moves.<br>
<br>
Enough of that short history of mine. :) My questions are these...<br>
<br>
1)<br>
Can I also use the Heise method for speedsolving? I can go sub-35 with<br>
the Fridrich method before deciding the learn the Heise method. I&#x27;m<br>
just making sure that I won&#x27;t waste my time learning this new method<br>
and that I can achieve the same thing (or even better ;)) with this<br>
method, even though I think that being able to solve the cube without<br>
using memorized sequences is a great thing...<br>
<br>
2)<br>
I am trying to grasp the concept being used in the third part of the<br>
solution (the one that solves the edges and any two corners) but I<br>
can&#x27;t still do it. I can do this step separately (solving the edges<br>
FIRST and THEN solving the two corners). What I want to learn is doing<br>
this entire stage using the advanced method (where one should make two<br>
pairs and then insert the remaining edges. Can anybody here tell me the<br>
strategies they use in doing the two pairs and inserting the edges?<br>
When I am doing this stage in my solves, I always feel that I am doing<br>
a lot of unnecessary turns, slowing down my time. I&#x27;m not even sub-2<br>
(as in 2 minutes!) using this method. I think that learning the<br>
advanced method would lead me to sub-2 minute times and eventually even<br>
faster times.<br>
<br>
3) After I learn the 3rd stage using your help, I<br>
would like to focus on the first stage of the Heise method. To those<br>
who can do the cube fast with this method, could you guys give me tips<br>
on doing this step faster. I think the problem with me is that I always<br>
have a hard time looking for the pieces that I need for the squares,<br>
especially the last two outer squares. <br>
<br>
Thank you in advance... ;)<br>

If it is a newer Rubik&#x27;s you can&#x27;t do that bucause the centres are not 
fixed with a screw anymore. Nowdays they are using unreplaceable rivets 
instead.

You will need a D.I.Y or a Rubik&#x27;s Studio cube if you like to play with 
screws and springs =)

Or, do as I did. I used a hacksaw to cut the rivets im my anny cube and 
then replaced the spider for an, really good, old 80&#x27;s replica spider 
intead. It&#x27;s my best speedcube so far.

My best average with it so far is 28.36 seconds, although I&#x27;m quite<br>
slow and probably not a good person to measure. E.g. I&#x27;m in the 30-40<br>
second range with Petrich (Petrus F2L + Fridrich LL).<br>
<br>
When I get time I&#x27;d like to write out my system for speed cubing.<br>
There are surprisingly very few patterns that you need to learn how to<br>
deal with, but they are not rigid patterns like in traditional<br>
systems. So, each pattern has a number of variations but if you know<br>
what to look for, you can easily spot it as the same pattern and apply<br>
the same strategy.<br>
<br>
As an example of what I mean, there are about 30 different<br>
configurations of the last 3 corners that can all be solved using the<br>
same pattern. Rather than learning and memorising 30 different<br>
algorithms, you need only learn one strategy and learn how to<br>
recognise the pattern in its different variations.<br>
<br>
Similarly, in the previous step when manipulating the two corner/edge<br>
pairs, there is a small set of patterns, each with many variations.<br>
Once you learn just a few strategies for how to solve this step, you<br>
can handle a wide variety of different situations.<br>
<br>
The speed cubing &quot;system&quot; that I have in mind would consist of a<br>
thought process, or a &quot;decision tree&quot;. It would tell you &quot;First look<br>
for this pattern; then do this strategy...&quot;, and so it would be a<br>
rather different approach from the usual exhaustive case table approaches.<br>

Haha :-) The secret is to keep track of the edges all the time while<br>

It&#x27;s strange, as I&#x27;m getting better, I&#x27;m starting to see the corner<br>

just kind of go, &quot;Yep, I saw that coming&quot;. If I slow down (i.e. fewest<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi

I for one never said using less moves is slower. I myself try to 
learn new algorithms that come up sparingly so I can lower my avg 
move count. More important to me (for speed) is usually if the 
algorithm is suited to be performed as a 2-generator, since that 
speeds up the execution. I know e.g. there is a 10 move T permutation 
but my 14 move T is way faster.

Reading what Ryan says about &quot;it&#x27;s about patterns&quot; this sounds like 
the Heise method is potentially faster than CFOP. I mean, less moves, 
and still pattern recognition, right?

I do have a vague memory of someone posting this idea (less 
moves=slower), but Yahoo won&#x27;t let me search on vague terms.

Why do you alway have to pick down on things?, of course he means in 
implicity. Like &quot;Petrus is not as fast as Fridrich&quot;, you heard that one 
a lot =)

That&#x27;s what I meant (sorry for making it sound more stupid than it<br>

It&#x27;s just not that simple, if I did an average with Fridrich it would<br>
require more thinking than Petrus, even though I&#x27;d use more moves. But<br>
that&#x27;s my own fault for not practising Fridrich.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I&#x27;ll just say that it CAN be the case:
total solution time = time spent doing moves + total delay time spent 
between steps. 

So theoretically it MAY be the case that an on average longer 
solution will have much shorter time for delay (better recognition 
and lookahead) and hence reach a shorter total time.

If im not very wrong pure CFOP is on average about 50-55 turns. Some 
other methods have claimed only 40-45 or 45-50 turns on average but i 
don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re any faster just because of that :-)

Ideas along the same line are actually also mentioned in Fridrich&#x27;s 
own description of her method and speedcubing in general, though 
total solution length is not explicitly mentioned :-)

in one-handed speedcubing?<br>
<br>
In terms of the standard 3x3 and two hands, size is definitely not an <br>
issue; the exception being monstrously large or dwarfishly tiny hands.<br>
<br>
While dexterity and strength of hands is much more important than <br>
size, it seems as if people with smaller hands (not children, for <br>
they often lack dexterity at young ages--but grown adults whose <br>
palms/fingers are just genetically smaller) would have to work much <br>
harder to be proficient at one-handed speedcubing.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts?  Anyone encountered hand-size issues at any time?<br>
<br>
&gt;From Wikipedia, which cites the Oxford English Dictionary:<br>
Average length of male hand: 18.9 cm<br>
Average breadth of male hand: 8.4 cm<br>
Average length of female hand: 17.2 cm<br>
Average breadth of female hand: 7.4 cm<br>
<br>
I couldn&#x27;t find any information as to when hands stop growing.<br>
<br>
It may also be more prudent to look at palm size and finger length <br>
separately, rather than the entire hand.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m in Houston for the next 2 months working and I am glad to know anyone<br>
that lives here or near here to meet, do some cubbing, tell jokes or just<br>
drink something.<br>
<br>
So... what do you think?<br>
<br>

Why do you alway have to pick down on things?, of course he means in 
implicity. Like &quot;Petrus is not as fast as Fridrich&quot;, you heard that one 
a lot =)

&gt; Can anybody here tell me the strategies they use in doing the two<br>
&gt; pairs and inserting the edges?<br>
<br>
For the two pairs, it is best to figure this out with your own study,<br>
and following the fundamental techniques:<br>
<br>
http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/fundamental_techniques.html<br>
<br>
About 50% of the time you&#x27;ll find that 1 pair is already made and you<br>
just need to make the other one. If there is no pair, most of the time<br>
there will be a broken pair that is already aligned and just needs to<br>
be joined (3-4 moves). If neither of these cases appear, then just<br>
solve the edges and corners separately.<br>
<br>
For fitting the edges between the pairs, many cases are just 3-cycles<br>
of pairs and you need only know one strategy for dealing with them:<br>
<br>
http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/pair_3_cycles.html<br>
<br>
In other cases you may find you can solve using only R-U turns, and<br>
other times R-U-L. There are also some advanced techniques involving<br>
F2 and D which also preserve the edge orientation but I haven&#x27;t<br>
written about them, yet. But for R-U and R-U-L strategies, they are<br>
simple enough that you can experiment with them by yourself.<br>
<br>
&gt; After I learn the 3rd stage using your help, I<br>
&gt; would like to focus on the first stage of the Heise method. To<br>
&gt; those who can do the cube fast with this method, could you guys<br>
&gt; give me tips on doing this step faster. I think the problem with me<br>
&gt; is that I always have a hard time looking for the pieces that I<br>
&gt; need for the squares, especially the last two outer squares. <br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind is which colour is your main colour. Let me<br>
define what this is: there is one colour that you will not use at all<br>
in stage 1, and the colour opposite to it is your main colour. At the<br>
beginning there will be several candidates for the main colour, and<br>
the candidates are reduced after you make a choice for each square.<br>
For example, when you build a non-matching square, the common colour<br>
usually becomes the main colour from then on. Being aware of the main<br>
colour (or main colour &quot;candidates&quot;) will help your eyes to target<br>
only corner pieces that contain the main colour.<br>

Yes, the main debates have been whether intuition is slower, whether<br>
colour neutrality is slower, and perhaps others. It has been argued<br>
that both of these things can cause (1) fewer moves and (2) slowness,<br>
but it hasn&#x27;t (to my recollection) been argued that (1) causes (2). It<br>
is a common error related to causality:<br>

saying &quot;It&#x27;s just a rubik&#x27;s cube&quot;. He relaxed a little. &quot;Oh, cool. How <br>

&quot;About thirty seconds&quot;.<br>
&quot;Do you know why I stopped you?&quot;<br>
&quot;No&quot;<br>
&quot;There&#x27;s been a burglary in the area&quot;.<br>

are you on drugs?, ever been arrested? on probation?, etc.), they <br>

I guess one might also argue that the same problem aplies to bigger 
cubes also. When i started off with rubiks.com 5x5x5 cube it felt 
really too big for me to handle fast. But it has improved over the 
years. Maybe we could gather some empirical data on this somehow?? ..

I for one welcome it. I don&#x27;t know why this has to be a sport for  
people with big hands. May the fastest brain + hands win.

What do the WCA guys say?

          <div class="email-content">i don&#x27;t think that having bigger hand is much of a help because then
your finger maybe push 2 layers at once or if you hand are very big
they have to bend farther back just to reach the cube.

also I am not positive but it seems like it would be easier to be more
dexterous with smaller hands.

there is probably an optimal size range though.

I&#x27;m much more comfortable doing OH using ES 2x2x2 than with a normal 
Rubik&#x27;s 3x3x3. Those are a little to big for me and I have not got 
small hands.

Last year I purchased a (really cheap, poor quality) 3x3x3 that is 
about the same size as the ES 2x and thought I colud use that one for 
OH... But it really sucked, almost impossible to twist :(

personally i would guess retooling costs would be a bit prohibitive.

          <div class="email-content">I myself have just started experimenting with OH cubing, and I find <br>
it rather difficult--I&#x27;m sure a lot of it is because I&#x27;m a beginner, <br>
but some of it is also because I have relatively small hands.  I&#x27;m <br>
sure with enough practice, skill is much more important than size, <br>
but the disadvantage may still be there.<br>
<br>
I for one, do rather wish for a larger palm to give my fingers more <br>
room to turn quicker and more freely.  Some of the fingertricks are <br>
also very hard for me, but I&#x27;m practicing.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know much about larger cubes; I&#x27;ve only solved the 5x5 a few <br>
times, and those haven&#x27;t been speed runs, so I used my whole wrist <br>
for all the turns, no fingertricks, although those are harder to pull <br>
off on the larger cubes because of the added rigidity on those.<br>
<br>
I would actually really like a modified (meaning smaller) 3x3 for OH <br>
speedcubing purposes.  All I can think of are the little keychain <br>
ones... but those would be worse.  Hmm... wonder if I could custom <br>
order/build one?<br>

          <div class="email-content">for my case,

i was up in the angular crest mountain road park by the side to enjoy the view of the city night lights when cops approached me and asked what i was doing at that place that late. i told them i was just enjoying the view and playing with my cube. so i demonstrated to them my sub-20 solve. 

they were quite impressed after which they said to me, &quot;get the hell out of here kid, good job with the cube though&quot;. some white redneck cop too LOL.

          <div class="email-content">Hi folks,<br>
<br>
Just found this group, and I thought I&#x27;d introduce myself. <br>
<br>
My name is George Madrid, and I&#x27;ve been cubing since about 1978 or 1979. I picked the <br>
cube up again about a year ago - a lost artifact of my childhood, and I discovered that <br>
there was an entire community of speedcubists out there. I thought I&#x27;d join in.<br>
<br>
My current average solve time is about 90 seconds, and I have a personal goal to bring <br>
that down below 60 seconds. I use my own system, which I suppose is a combination of <br>
the Friedrich F2L and the Petrus LL. I&#x27;ve recently begun study of the PLL algorithms in an <br>
effort to trim some seconds off my time. Honestly, though, I lose more time in the F2L. <br>
Once I get the F2L, I&#x27;m usually about 20 seconds from a solved cube, so any hints or <br>
pointers to hints on the F2L are welcomed. <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m currently working on serious finger-tricking, too, and I&#x27;m getting fed up with my cube. <br>
It gets caught up on itself all the time, and I&#x27;m trying to figure out of that&#x27;s my lack of <br>
dexterity, or the cube being too loose. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I probably won&#x27;t post much, since I suspect I have a lot more to take away than to <br>
offer this group at this point, so thanks an advance for any advice, pointers, help that y&#x27;all <br>
offer. Please forgive me if I ask too many newb questions.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Begin here:
http://dougreed.no-ip.org/~doug/f2l/f2l.htm
Solve the cube slowly many times and workout your own F2L methods.
Then go to:
www.cubeloop.com - a site with a substantial F2L section.
There you can compare what you do with what they&#x27;ve got,
and you can modify your methods as you see fit.

Another alternative is to memorize algorithms for F2L.

          <div class="email-content">Probably someone took a piece out or it falled and it was put back in the wrong way...that way the cube is unsolvable...

take an edge out* and put it back flipped...then try again the solver...if it still says it&#x27;s wrong, maybe you have a wrong corner

*turn a face 45º, push the edge up and the 2 pieces behind it down...should be easy

          <div class="email-content">I proposed this idea a while back.<br>
I&#x27;m still working on the right-click thing, but meanwhile I stumbled across <br>
the idea of doing this through the search bar in Firefox.<br>
I used the ideas (and code) from http://libdev.plymouth.edu/post/31 to <br>
create two &quot;search engines&quot;: one for animating an alg generator, and another <br>
for a solver.<br>
<br>
You can &quot;install&quot; (really, it&#x27;s just a matter of clicking and allowing <br>
Firefox to add these to a list of search engines) them from here:<br>
http://cube.garron.us/tools/index.htm<br>
<br>
I created a short demo install &amp; use video (with the generator search only): <br>
http://archive.garron.us/vid/demo/algsearch.mp4<br>
<br>
The best part: while one of the two is selected as your current search <br>
engine, you actually can display an alg with a right-click:<br>
http://archive.garron.us/vid/demo/alg_right_click.mp4<br>
(but only if an alg &quot;search engine&quot; is selected)<br>
<br>
Hope some of you like this, and use it :-)<br>
<br>
As mentioned, I&#x27;m working on a permanent right-click version, and <br>
(hopefully) configurability on the applet page<br>
<br>

----- Original Message ----- <br>
&gt; From: Lucas G.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Anyhow, the idea would be to create a browser extension (I would like it <br>
&gt; for Firefox :-) that allows a user to highlight an algorithm in a text and <br>
&gt; animate (or display the result of) the alg in a new tab. AnimCube (my <br>
&gt; preference) or Randelshofer&#x27;s applet can be employed for this.<br>
&gt; It would look something like this: <br>
&gt; http://archive.garron.us/img/algclick.png<br>
&gt; And then open a new page, like this: <br>
&gt; http://archive.garron.us/img/algnewpage.png (here with an FMC helper page <br>
&gt; as an example display applet) <br>

<br>
Please don&#x27;t take this advice because your cube will look pretty tatty<br>
afterwards. If you are going to replace the stickers, buy a<br>
replacement set from cubesmith.com - at least when you put the<br>
stickers back on it looks brand new.<br>
<br>
If you don&#x27;t know how to go about solving your cube, and you want to<br>
get it back into shape (to start learning of course) - the best bet is<br>
to take it completely apart and then fit it back together in the<br>
correct way. This is because at the moment you don&#x27;t know if you have<br>
an edge flipped, two edges swapped, a corner twisted, or any<br>
combination of all these which are all impossible to correct just by<br>
turning the cube.<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t worry about taking it apart, just turn a face 45 degrees as<br>
mentioned before, pop out an edge piece, and then dismantle it from<br>
there. It&#x27;s very easy to put back together also.<br>

          <div class="email-content">If you want to replace all of the stickers, be sure you get the color scheme right. Or if you don&#x27;t want new stickers, get someone who knows how to solve the cube solve it for you and they will be able to fix the problem. If it is really bad (most of the stickers have been rearranged and the person whom you hired has no idea what goes where) just replace the entire thing.

          In addition to my last post, I see what Patrick said does make a bit
more sense than I thought, if someone has taken off stickers and
replaced them in order to get closer to the solution, then it&#x27;s
probably better that you replace all the stickers :)

          <div class="email-content">Welcome, George!

I too have been cubing since the early 80s (though if you had a cube 
in 1978 or 1979, you were definitely very early, it wasn&#x27;t generally 
available in the US until 1980). 

The F2L tips already mentioned are very helpful. There are plenty of 
videos out there of people showing the techniques, and it&#x27;s helpful 
to watch their hand positioning to pick up the finger tricks.

It also helps to get together with other cubers--at least I learn 
better that way.  Where do you live?

My wife teases me becuase I too once said I&#x27;d be happy if I got my 
time under a minute, which is about as fast as I ever did it in the 
80s, but now I&#x27;m not happy if a solve is over 30 seconds.  I&#x27;ve been 
speedcubing about 2 years now, but I don&#x27;t practice as much as most 
people in here (you could get to sub-30 in a few months with 
consistent practice).

good luck with your cubing!

I think the size can play a bigger part on OH cubing, though...Ryan Patricio has pretty long fingers, and I think the Dzoans too...

I&#x27;d guess 

L U&#x27; L&#x27; - (U2S2)*2 - L U L&#x27; or similar
(S being of course the layer between F and B)

would be much much faster?? 

Maybe this one is more bld friendly:
F2 U B2 *H-perm* B2 U&#x27; F2 ??

Well, (1 2 10 12) is a 4-cycle. I would first do (1 2 10) and then (1
12) together with 2 corners.

Yes i was a bit confused whether he meant 2 swaps or a 4-cycle. My 
suggestion replaces avgalens suggestion.

The exact best solution will depend on what corners are acceptable to 
mess about with ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Kirk,
Like anything else from 30 years ago, my memory is a little fuzzy. I was
living in Scotland when I got my first cube. I don&#x27;t know if that means it
was earlier or later. I remember who my teacher was because she confiscated
it, and if my math is right, that would put it in either late 1979 or early
1980.

I had already checked out the Doug Reed page, and I found it very helpful.
It greatly improved my intuitive understanding of the F2L moves, which in
turn, has helped me to memorize algs for those F2L permutations which I
wasn&#x27;t able to do both quickly and intuitively. I think my problem lies in
finding the cubies quickly enough. I don&#x27;t have the &quot;vision&quot; yet, and I
spend most of my time looking for two that match.

Lately, I&#x27;ve been timing just the F2L portion of my solve. When I go slowly,
it&#x27;s somewhere between 55-65 seconds. When I try to go quickly, sometimes it
goes as slow as 90 seconds because I mess up more. Can you or anyone
recommend ways to improve my vision and find the next cubes so that my pause
between algs is lower?

It&#x27;s hard to imagine that I&#x27;ll get it down to 30. I&#x27;m not sure I have the
time to devote to it, but I am spending time on it every day lately. Part of
me is annoyed because I&#x27;ve done a lot of work learning a lot of new
techniques, and finally gotten back down to the same time I was able to
average using the &quot;Simple Solution&quot; that I learned back in the 80s.

Oh, are there any cubing groups in the Boston area? Has anyone compiled a
website with lists of cubing groups/clubs/whatever?

Anyway, thanks to everyone for their advice. I&#x27;m still having fun.

George

Anyway here are some

This is my own site. The applet is on the &quot;animated cube&quot; page
I also wrote a bookmarklet for this. Look under the tools section on

2. http://solvethecube.co.uk/
This site is by Joël van Noort. It also has a cube image generation

3. http://cube.garron.us/tools/alggen.php
This one can actually be used in the FireFox search bar

As a reference site www.w3schools.com is very good. But it&#x27;s not a 
site i would recommend as an &quot;idiots guide to web development&quot;. 
There&#x27;s a number of good html books. But in order to make dynamic 
sites more is needed. 99.99% of all webhotels do support php and 
mysql. So a book on php/mysql may be very handy also. I still haven&#x27;t 
found a good book that explains in some detail how to actually do 
good web DESIGN. With that i mean how to design databases efficiently 
and more advanced stuff on interaction between web pages (dataflow). 
I have by and large learnt most of what i know from a bit of trial 
and error and some &quot;lucky googling&quot;. At university i only learnt 
standard languages like java and pascal (delphi). No course had any 
web programming, which is odd. I guess it&#x27;s for some reason not of an

I&#x27;m almost certain you weren&#x27;t referring to this page, but it probably
does what you want.

http://puzzlingaddiction.com/Cube/f2l/movelist.html

Just paste a list of algs into that form.  For example, you could try these:

L2 B&#x27; F U2 R B2 F2 L&#x27; U2 B&#x27; F R2
U&#x27; B U2 L&#x27; F2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B U F2 L2 U2 L&#x27; B&#x27;
L2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R F2 L&#x27; F R U2 R2 F L&#x27; R

For each alg, you&#x27;ll get a list of links to an applet that will show
the moves of the alg.  Also, there are some other links for doing
various translations on the algorithm.

<br>
Tim actually got the one I had found before.<br>
<br>
But all the other ones are useful too.<br>
<br>
In case you were wondering, I&#x27;m using these applets to figure out and <br>
type out all 48 algorithms (it&#x27;s really only 24 and reverses/mirrors of <br>
them) for the CMLL table on Gilles Roux&#x27;s website.  Just because I&#x27;m <br>
not good at mirroring and reversing in my head.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s almost done, so if anyone wants a copy of all the written-out <br>
algorithms, just let me know.<br>
<br>
You could check them for me too, while you&#x27;re at it. :)<br>

Thanks. Yes, you are right.

Currently we have:
2s) For competitors with hearing disabilities, judges may replace the vocal 
instructions with hand signals.
2t) For competitors with physical disabilities, judges may give help with 
starting and stopping the timer.

I will add an article for visual disabilities in the next version.

Have fun,

Ron

Well, I always make sure that the cubes i buy are official rubik&#x27;s <br>
brand (even 4x4s and 5x5s).  They seem to work best (easiest) for <br>

cube, there are tons of places to buy from.  I personally buy from ebay <br>

Cubesmith.com does not sell puzzles.
Mefferts.com does not sell rubik&#x27;s 3x3&#x27;s.

I have no experience with either cube4you.com or 9spuzzles.com, so I 
cannot comment on either.  However rubiks.com works fine for me for 
buying DIY kits.  My current best speedcube is just a plain old store-
bought cube, not a DIY or anything fancy.

          <div class="email-content">For Rubik&#x27;s Studio Cubes, check eBay.

I have tried cube4you.com/9spuzzles.com DIYs, rubiks.com DIYs
(although it&#x27;s been a while), and Rubik&#x27;s store bought cubes. From my
experience, the store bought cubes could be used for speedsolving,
although they take some wear. But, I prefer DIYs because I can cut
corners with them, unlike the store bought cubes. For store bought
cubes, you could check places like Wal-mart.

As far as differences between the Chinese DIYs and rubiks.com DIYs,
there isn&#x27;t much. Besides the fact that the former can be in different
colors (which are made of different material, and thus differ between
each other), they&#x27;re pretty similar. If you have the money, I&#x27;d say to
try both and see which one fits your liking better, but if now, it is
safe to say to go ahead and get a rubiks.com DIY, as it can make a
very good speedcube.

          <div class="email-content">The Chinese DIY uses Studio Cube-like center caps, and come with 
corner caps. My personal preference is to put the corner caps in. The 
older Chinese DIYs were about 1.5x as heavy as a rubiks.com DIY, but 
now they&#x27;re about the same. Also, get the type-A DIYs; the type-Bs 
are pretty awful. I personally still use a rubiks.com DIY because it 
has been so well worn. Also, make sure you get Cubesmith stickers: 
the PVC stickers that come with the cube will last less time as a set 
of Cubesmith stickers. If you get Cubesmith tiles, they&#x27;ll be there 
practically forever.

thousands.  If you need further help, I am willing to help, just ask.

Good luck.

difference than simply the type (screws and whatnot). I have seen some
very good transparent cubes (which only come in B), and I have an okay
gold cube (which also only comes in B).

          <div class="email-content">In my humble opinion, comparing 1981 cubers to 2007, the cubers today
are far better than cubers back in 1981.  I can get times under 20
seconds with rather stiff cubes, and I&#x27;ve seen it done even faster,
with times in the 17&#x27;s and 18&#x27;s with very stiff cubes.

But in any case, cubers today have to be better than they were before.
 There is very open communication now, and with the internet and the
sharing of ideas, improvement is very fast for everyone.

This isn&#x27;t to say that Minh Thai&#x27;s accomplishment wasn&#x27;t amazing.  It
was, but comparing cubers today to cubers back then just isn&#x27;t doable.
 Who would win between Capablanca and Vishy Anand?  Certainly Anand.
With computers assisting, the training has become much more precise.

I can almost guarantee that Magnus Carlsen will surpass Anand and
Kramnik.  Why?  Computers and even better developed today then when
Anand and Krmanik grew up playing chess.  This is why we have cubers
doing 15 second averages within months of picking up the cube.

People are better now.  But let&#x27;s not compare Babe Ruth to Barry
Bonds.  Or John McEnroe to James Blake.  Cy Young to Roger Clemens, or
Fritz Kreisler to Itzakh Perlman to Vadim Repin.

Times change, generations change, and all of us owe something to the
people of the past.  Without their work and their foundation, we would
be must worse off.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks! actually i had a rubiks.com cube the one i told you about that
i lost. it&#x27;s not exactly DIY.. its the one with a blank cube with pvc
stickers included and lube. i loved it and im missing it hehe =D but
it was my first cube so that&#x27;s why i still asked coz i didnt know
which cubes are actually good. 

the problem now is, i live in the philippines (southeast asia). I had
my first one delivered to a friend who came to visit here. now i dont
have anyone to ship to, and international shipping costs like twice
the DIY cube. I love cubing but i still cant afford that im still a
student and under my parents roof =p is there anyone who knows where
to get a good cube probably nearer here? Thanks! and thanks again for
those who replied! much appreciated!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any good domino sites/methods to recommend? How much <br>
better is a spindled version compared to a grooved version (this is <br>
what i have - and after lubing it it pops too easily). And finally, <br>
has anyone done any move counts for domino solving. Im at about 45 <br>
turns on average, but i feel this can be improved A LOT.<br>
<br>
And i have a comment, about solved states. I have seen that Stefan <br>
solves the 2 sides into mirrored  states, whereas i dont do this. I <br>
solve the 2 sides to same state. Theoretically solving into mirrored <br>
states gives 2 possible solutions whereas how i do it the solved <br>
state is unique.<br>
<br>
My solution: White=1,2,3&gt;4,5,6&gt;7,8,9 Black=1,2,3&gt;4,5,6&gt;7,8,9<br>
Stefans solution White=1,2,3&gt;4,5,6&gt;7,8,9 Black=3,2,1&gt;6,5,4&gt;9,8,7<br>
(or Black=1,2,3&gt;4,5,6&gt;7,8,9 White=3,2,1&gt;6,5,4&gt;9,8,7)<br>
Numbered from left to right &gt;:new row.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys, yesterday i was just cubing and getting some awesome times<br>
for me, i was getting all sorts of 15/16sec solves (and i normally avg<br>
like 19sec) so i went and grabbed the video camera, on it i caught a<br>
13.82 sec solve and i decided to do one more solve when i got this<br>
11.75 sec solve,  i have the scramble if you guys want to see, wasn&#x27;t<br>
lucky at all, but everything flowed together unbelievably, this was my<br>
best solve ever.<br>

I am sure all of you (or most of you) have see the symmetry solve<br>
video ( http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=nw6NuN4WZFM - from<br>
speedcubing.com ).<br>
<br>
A while ago I did something similar (solving 2 mirrored cubes at the<br>
same time) but the difference was that one of the cubes was in my back.<br>
I find it quite funny to practice too. (I have one video of it but the<br>
solve time is about 3 minutes and the quality is poor.)<br>

If someone wants to try and beat 1 minute...<br>

I got this idéa about a core ball 3x3x3. Use a ball intead of the 
spider and connect the centres to the ball as normally using screws 
and springs. Then redesign the internal parts of the edges and 
corners so they look like the ones in a Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4.

A cube made like that, I belive, won&#x27;t pop nor lock up as much as the 
ones whe have today.

          <div class="email-content">I dont know... i visited lots of toykingdoms and all they have are
crappy imitations probably made in china. also national bookstores.
but i did buy a 2x2x2 imitation in nat book thats really good, smooth
without lube. but i still want a 3x3x3 =p and btw, so far i think
there&#x27;s no competitions in the philippnes, but i dont know. are there
really toys r us here? i havent seen one yet. and im really hoping for
a DIY, which is really rare, if ever, an item to sell in  toy stores
that target only kids (well, in the philippines anyways). but hey,
thanks for the infos :) i&#x27;ll try and check ebay.

to all the filipino cubers here in the group, Mabuhay sa inyo!!
hehehe!! (nagulat nga ako na may pinoy rin d2 eh =p)

thanks for all the help, everybody!

          <div class="email-content">Hmm... that is interesting.  I sat down and did an avg of 100 solves
yesterday using JNetCube, you can see the results here:
http://z12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?showtopic=1111

I just skimmed it just now to see if I saw any .01, .04, etc and I see solve
4, 52, 56 and solve 78 have those times.  So I am guessing it is not a bug,
and just a coincidence, or possibly something with his computer.  This might
be way out there, but could it be a computer problem, or Java problem that
has a delay in stopping the timer which won&#x27;t allow it to see on those
times?  It is tough to tell.

          <div class="email-content">Agreed.

Even I personally am (slightly) faster at 46 while hardly practicing  
than I was at 21 obsessing over it for hours every day.

Communication and cooperation are incredibly powerful ways to solve  
problems. Cooperating teams of smart people will always beat lone  
geniuses.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I agree.  Tyson is right.  The world is becoming more efficient, and
the cube is just 1 perfect example.  I eventually think the amount of moves
it takes to solve a cube will be factor behind a record.  Methods like
Heise, Petrus, Roux, etc. will be the dominant methods in the future since
those have a lower move count. Maybe that is just me, but I see that
happening.  You can only go so far with 50 move avg, or a 40 move avg, etc.
The lower move count will win the race.

I think it was Johannes who posted this several weeks/months ago here.
I use it for solving my 2x2x3!

I cant see that happening anytime soon, that other methods will take 
over Fridrich&#x27;s dominance. &quot;Everyone&quot; knows it and practices it a 
lot. It takes more than a low move count to make a good fast overall 
method. At least for 3x3x3 cube. For larger cubes however i believe 
that more move effcient ones will start to dominate. New systems will 
appear sooner or later. The systems you mentioned are well suited for 
fewest moves, at least for time limited fewest moves. But for 
speeding i think they are a long shot from taking over. Fridrich 
extensions are much more likely candidates for methods that may 
dominate in the future. One indication of this is the very few sites 
dedicated to these methods compared with Fridrich. I dont mind if i&#x27;m 
proven wrong, this is only my personal view :-)

          <div class="email-content">I think that the movecount of a method is important, but it has to be<br>
weighted next to how much time it takes to figure out and execute each<br>
move. Comparing just Heise and Fridrich, the beginning of Heise will<br>
probably be significantly faster with practice, but the last steps,<br>
where everything but three corners are solved and then the corners are<br>
finished with a commutator, may take less moves than OLL/PLL but they<br>
may never be as fast to execute because of the huge amount of<br>
fingertricks and triggers in last layer algorithms. You can execute a<br>
memorized sequence of 14 moves (like a T-perm) faster than 14 moves<br>
you have to figure out.<br>
<br>
To take this to the extreme... well, look at Per&#x27;s FMC solves. He<br>
routinely gets under 30 moves, but he&#x27;s not going to speedsolve like<br>
this! Even if you can solve the cube in 10 seconds on average, 6 hours<br>
of inspection is not acceptable.<br>
<br>
Well, I guess the point is that for a 3x3x3 cube a significant<br>
decrease in movecount also means a decrease in turning speed and an<br>
increase in thinking speed, so it may not be as useful as you would<br>
think to decrease the number of moves. But, as Per said, things are<br>
different on a larger cube. Your turning speed during an algorithm may<br>
not be much higher than your turning speed during an intuitive step.<br>
Using a more optimal solution, especially in a reduction method, can<br>
give you a significant edge, and if you practice it enough you may not<br>
lose any time.<br>

I&#x27;d just like to point out how freaky these results are: Every one of<br>
the people listed above were on the other side of 40 in their previous<br>

30s, which is very freaky.<br>
<br>
Is there something about this week&#x27;s scramble that created luck across<br>
so many different methods? I thought the edge situation was very<br>
advantageous, but even people who ignored that did very well this week.<br>

This is to say that a) yes, there could be a bug on his system, but b) it&#x27;s

I suggest that he try upgrading his JVM and try again.

          <div class="email-content">&quot;Bug&quot; may be too strong a word as well. It could just be that for  
some reason Java on that OS and computer can only produce 67 distinct  
measurements per second. The consequence would only be that the times  
are off by 0.01 second occasionally.

It would be interesting to see the distribution for all other  
decimals. Are there further patterns?

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Yes the edges were very good this week. I might have had all edges 
done in 14/15 turns but chose to postpone some edges in favor of 
getting some cancellations on corner cycles. Had i had only one more 
corner done after my start i could have been 6/7 turns shorter. Now 
that would have been one of my best linear solves ever!! Congrats to 
everyone with excellent solutions this week :-)

I guess the rules allow for you to provide your goggles to a judge, for him to accept them and then give them to you for your attempt.

            I dont know... i visited lots of toykingdoms and all they have are

crappy imitations probably made in china. also national bookstores.

but i did buy a 2x2x2 imitation in nat book thats really good, smooth

without lube. but i still want a 3x3x3 =p and btw, so far i think

there&#x27;s no competitions in the philippnes, but i dont know. are there

really toys r us here? i havent seen one yet. and im really hoping for

a DIY, which is really rare, if ever, an item to sell in  toy stores

that target only kids (well, in the philippines anyways). but hey,

thanks for the infos :) i&#x27;ll try and check ebay.



to all the filipino cubers here in the group, Mabuhay sa inyo!!

hehehe!! (nagulat nga ako na may pinoy rin d2 eh =p)



thanks for all the help, everybody!

&gt; A Swedish cuber posted a strange problem on our national forum. He<br>
&gt; has saved all solves he has done with JNetCube. A total of 1668<br>
&gt; solves. Not a single one of those solves are xx.01, xx.04, xx.07,<br>
&gt; xx.10, xx.13 and so on. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyone knows if the bug is in the timer, in a Java-library or mabye<br>
&gt; in his computer.<br>
<br>
The resolution of Java&#x27;s timer is limited by the resolution of the<br>
underlying operating system&#x27;s timer. In Linux, the resolution is quite<br>
good (~1ms), while in Windows 98 it is quite bad (~60ms). What this<br>
means is that if a Java program is run on Windows 98 and it makes a<br>
call to System.currentTimeMillis(), the time returned will be accurate<br>
only to a resolution of about 60ms. So, my guess is that these numbers<br>
result from the operating system&#x27;s timer resolution along with rounding.<br>

          <div class="email-content">yeah they are usually on the left.

not sure how much that would cost to print because you have slight
color variation of black on the cubies in between the stickers but if
you could deal with it just being black there i could print a shirt
for you for preview. (but it would have to wait till Thursday because
thats the next time i can go to school).

          <div class="email-content">since most ppl are right handed and they use that hand the most, preferably put it on the left so it does not get obstructed when the wearer uses their hand.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

The (UFL,DFR,UBR) surely is a tough one, at least as long as 
orientation matters.

A way that is easy to understand is the following:

U - R2 D&#x27; R2 D R2 - U2 - R2 D&#x27; R2 D R2 - U

This is actually nothing but the following conjugated commutator:

U&#x27; [U2,R2 D&#x27; R2 D R2] U

(The R2 D&#x27; R2 D R2 part can be replaced with R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 B R)

The following will also do:

[U2,R&#x27; F2 R F2 R], saving 1 turn. Not quite so easy to understand :-o
[P,Q]=P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; (P then Q then P inverted then Q inverted)
Also recall that if P is a sequence m1m2m3....mk then 
P&#x27;=mk&#x27; ...m3&#x27;m2&#x27;m1&#x27; ,invert the order of moves and also invert every 
move.

south of Sweden on during this time of the year so he&#x27;s probably not 
around but I&#x27;m not sure. Maybe Anders Larsson can join us if he has 
the time, I ask him when I get the chance.

Best thing I think is that you send me an e-mail when you know the 
date of a free day you can use for a cube meeting. Easiest way to 
find a place to send the mail is probably using the link in the 
column to the right =)

The centers of the not DIY cube were filled in with some putty to be <br>

Can anyone help? Thank you!<br>

Sorry for the delay in my response... I am travelling in Australia 
for a month.

I&#x27;ll be in Boulder mid-July, but I think some of the other guys are 
getting there mid-August. Maybe all of the local cubers can get 
together sometime in late August or September.

Send me an email at:  danknights &quot;at&quot; gmail, if you want to set 
something up.

That&#x27;s pretty normal.  I think that the entire side of the center
piece is slightly concave.  The indentation that you see is the part
that doesn&#x27;t contact other pieces while turning.  After a lot of use,
the area around the center of the surface starts to wear flat, but the
middle part doesn&#x27;t get any wear, so it doesn&#x27;t change.

          <div class="email-content">Hi group.<br>
<br>
Here I present my 3-step ELL for direct solving the 4x4x4. This step <br>
is best preceeded by the use of CLL but COLL is also useful (or even <br>
ZB).<br>
<br>
The first two ELL stages solves only two pieces at the time (**See <br>
note at bottom of post), but in step three the last four edges are <br>
solved and not only that, parity is also fixed then.<br>
<br>
This list is compleate and all algs are pretty short, (many are <br>
probably optimal but there are no tools to test such things around =)<br>

..1..2..<br>
<br>
 F-side<br>
<br>
case number: (nr of moves) (cube orientations) alg<br>
<br>
The numbering in the case descrition tells which two edges that are <br>
being solved, nr 1 and 2. These edges initially are palced at <br>
positions 1-8. Even edges (really only nr 2) are oriented at even <br>
places and the other way around at odd places. Same thing goes for <br>
the odd edge (nr 1).<br>

<br>
Now, is this hard to learn?<br>
<br>
It is rather many cases but there are not many algs used because of <br>
the many symmetries and the fact that the algs in ELL 1-2 affects <br>
more than two peices and can be used for more than one case.<br>
<br>
If you alredy know CLL then it is not much work to learn this.<br>
<br>
Ok, why then?<br>
<br>
Number of moves my friends, I usaly hit 85-90 turns solving F3L <br>
compleatly intuitive, sometimes a bit less but seldomly much more. <br>
Add to that my LL and you get some 125-130 moves totaly and that is <br>
about 25 less than if you solve your 4x using centres-edges-3x3x3. I <br>
belive this is not harder to do, just shorter.<br>
<br>
How many seconds does 25 4x4x4 turns takes for you?<br>
<br>
To use this for a 5x5x5 you only need to add an extra ELL step to <br>
solve the mid edges, easiest is to do that step as the first ELL step <br>
and use 3x3x3 ELL alg.<br>

** Note: Because of number of cases, if I solve three at the time <br>
there are 8*7*6 cases (8!/5!) in ELL 1, now it&#x27;s 8*7=56, ELL 2 has <br>
got 5*6=30, if three edges was solved then it would become 6*5*4=120.<br>

Have you memorised all of this yet? If so, very well done-it will do 
miracles for your 4x4x4 fewest moves ;-) Do you have something 
similar coming for 5x5x5 ELL? Would central edges first be the best 
extension?

I have been working on my 4x4x4 LL for about a year now and all the 
time I had CLL + this ELL 1 first so I had a long time to learn the 
cases for ELL 1 and 2. And as I said, there are not many algs used 
and I know exactly how they work so It&#x27;s almost intuitive by now.

I&#x27;m actually using more algs than these to work on ELL 1+2 at the 
same time if there are good cases = both dedges paired = use 3x3x3 
ELL algs. Or one of the edges at the B-side and one at the F-side is 
alredy solved, then I got algs for most of the cases. If one side is 
solved and the rest is oriented I got algs for all cases (3-dedege 
PLL&#x27;s, it was my previous approach but some algs was too long so I 
changed to this). I can also work on ELL 1 while solving the corners 
by swtiching from CLL to COLL, XCLL (orient edges while doing CLL) or 
even ZB (if i know the alg =)

Can&#x27;t get to a full four step for 5x5x5 because of to many cases. One 
possible approach is to use normal 3x3x3 OLL + PLL as the first two 
steps aming at corners and mid edges and then use my 3-ELL for the 
dedges.

But best is to use paralell cycles (example doing m&#x27;+r instead of 
single r-slice turns if a mid edge is paird with a corner edge) and 
hope to get a four step in the end. That has got the backside effect 
of getting two unorientd mid edges left to do in ELL 3 in 50% of the 
cases and that&#x27;s not good. To avoid that when it is about to happen I 
usally add the 3x3x3 ELL as the second or third ELL-step but using 
only the mid slice instead of three layers to solve the three cycle 
(normally I have got one side fully compleated at this point so there 
is only a three cycle left to do for mid edges). If I get all mids 
pemuted but two unoriented initially, then I unsolve those parallell 
to the ELL 1 cycle and then try, if possible to get them back 
oriented parallell to the next cycle to do. If that&#x27;s not possible, 
then I go 3x3x3 cycle for those.

I did a 10(12) average for the 5x5x5 LL using that method yesterday 
and got 46.5 turns and I think that&#x27;s pretty normal.

Have you tried using algos like:

R&#x27; D R (ed) R&#x27; D&#x27; R (e&#x27;d&#x27;) on 5x5x5 ??? Block 3-cycle, sorta in-
between pure 5x5x5 alg and 3x3x3 alg ;-)

(e is the layer between d and u, corresponding to E on 3x3x3)

Obviously you&#x27;d need to turn last layer onto F by turning the cube 
physically.

Yes =) that&#x27;s exactly what I ment with &quot;...is to use paralell cycles 
(example doing m&#x27;+r instead of 
single r-slice turns if a mid edge is paired with a corner edge)...&quot; 
Diffrence is that I would write the alg as:

(x&#x27;) U&#x27; R U (m&#x27;r) U&#x27; R&#x27; U (mr&#x27;)

But you can do more weird things = diffrent cycles - like this one:

(x&#x27;) r U&#x27; R U&#x27; m2 U2 r&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; m2 U2

Even more weird, add only two l-turns and you get a third cycle:

(x&#x27;) r U&#x27; R U&#x27; m2 U2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; m2 U2 l

Three diffrent cycles in 14 turns. Imagine what you can do to a 100 
layer cube =P

This is my approach, not pure CF doe:

1) Solve the four F2L pairs at first = wery easy to do, normally the 
first pair is done or only one turn away.

2) Do CLL

3) Choose the best side (U or D) to use for FL and put down the edges 
using MU turns. The first two you pair with centres so you also solve 
those in this step (do not do opposite sides as the two first, if you 
did RD edge and R centre first then do F or B but not L as second by 
putting down F (or B) centre, D centre and the edge that goes between 
them as a 1x2x2 block.)

4) Do ELL

Done!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Segnet,

If I were you would just leave it, and reglue tiles when they fall off
naturally. You only need a tiny amount of superglue in the centre of
the underside of the tile to stick it back on, and using only a tiny
amount of glue will ensure that it doesn&#x27;t spread out towards the edge
of the tile when you press it down and glue the pieces together.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

If one can get a grip on how commutators work, the easiest way to 
understand how to twist 2-corners is probably like so:

[R&#x27; D R F D F&#x27;,U or U2] or [R&#x27; D2 R F D2 F&#x27;,U or U2]

For adjacent or opposite twists. Then there&#x27;s also 2 mirrored 
sunes ... or the well known (L B&#x27; D2 B L&#x27; U2)*2. Spoilt for choices :D

          <div class="email-content">Actually he needed to be 4.44 seconds faster in average to break the WR.

(I think the misunderstanding comes from the fact that speedcubing.com links
to the times done in the year 2007, not the ones done in all competitions
ever. And in this case, in 2006, Michael Fung had an average of 59.21seconds.)

          Hi Segnet,

If I were you would just leave it, and reglue tiles when they fall off
naturally. You only need a tiny amount of superglue in the centre of
the underside of the tile to stick it back on, and using only a tiny
amount of glue will ensure that it doesn&#x27;t spread out towards the edge
of the tile when you press it down and glue the pieces together.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Arnaud,

I would love to do &#x27;average of 5&#x27; for Square-1 and Megaminx and Clock.
There are some reasons why I think we should not do it:
1) the popularity of the events is not big (54, 44, 85 competitors on world 
ranking), although caused by several factors.
2) there are only a handful of top cubers, the rest of the competitors are 
intermediate or low level
3) the puzzles are (extremely) hard to scramble

These events, with all respect, are not main events (yet).
Given the limited time for a competition we have to make choices. I prefer 
to have more events with time per event reserved relative to the popularity 
of the event.
My vote would be to keep it like this for now.

Have fun,

Ron

If Cubesmith offers pieces for it, it must be a Rubik&#x27;s brand. ;)

My suggestion is to lubricate it and just turn more carefully.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

Let me address your reasons 1 by 1:

1) Popularity: I agree that these puzzles are less popular than others. That 
is why they are usually side-events on another stage or on another day. This 
ensures that they don&#x27;t take time/focus away from the main events. Events 
like Fewest Moves and Blindfolded (especially multiple blindfolded and 
 >3x3x3 blindfolded) don&#x27;t have a lot of competitors alsoe, but take up much 
more time than Square-1, MegaMinx, Clock, etc do.
2) Top/Rest-difference: I agree that the difference between the absolute top 
cubers and the rest is bigger than on most main-events. A big part of the 
explanation is that the top cubers seem to practice these puzzles much more 
than the rest does. Timewise, that means that top cubers will be done very 
fast, even if they do 5 solves. Having a cut-off time limit for who gets to 
do an average (just like on 4x4x4 and 5x5x5) would prevent events from 
taking to long. Such a cut-off time would also motivate &quot;the rest&quot; to 
practice these puzzles more. The exact way of determining the cut-off time 
could be in the form of World-Record-Average-Time) * n, where a good value 
for n might be between 2 and 3.
3) Scrambling: I agree for MegaMinx, but not for Clock and Square-1. I think 
the problem is more to find scramblers that know the notation. This issue is 
also adressed by having a cut-off time, because that would keep the number 
of puzzles that need to get scrambled about the same.

It just seems inconsistent and unwanted to me to have
1. Clock be a &quot;mean of 3&quot; while Pyraminx is an average of 5.
2. MegaMinx be a &quot;mean of 3&quot; while 5x5x5 is an average of 5 with a cut-off 
time.
3. Square-1 be a &quot;mean of 3&quot; while luck and easy solves has such a big 
influence.

I hope I have written all of this down in a way that makes both your 
consernes and my thoughts about them clear.

Hi Arnaud,

I would love to do &#x27;average of 5&#x27; for Square-1 and Megaminx and Clock.
There are some reasons why I think we should not do it:
1) the popularity of the events is not big (54, 44, 85 competitors on world
ranking), although caused by several factors.
2) there are only a handful of top cubers, the rest of the competitors are
intermediate or low level
3) the puzzles are (extremely) hard to scramble

These events, with all respect, are not main events (yet).
Given the limited time for a competition we have to make choices. I prefer
to have more events with time per event reserved relative to the popularity
of the event.
My vote would be to keep it like this for now.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hey Arnaud, Ron, everyone else :)

The idea of that the fastest only do an avg of 5 is not really in line
 with the comon ideas of the WCA I think? This would mean that only
the &#x27;fast&#x27; people, which are only a few in these sides puzzles, would
have a chance of doing an average of 5 while the big majority of
cubers can only have one or 2 attempts depending on the format. So we
would end up with a single solve record list of quite long, but there
would only be about 10 solvers on the average list! A while back there
was the same issue on 5x5 I think?

          <div class="email-content">Having a cut-off time is definately not ideal, but apparently it is necessary for SOME competitions. But those cut-off times can also be a great motivator. I have personally done a lot of training to reach some common cut-off times (3 minutes for 5x5x5, 2 minutes for 4x4x4 and 10 minutes for 3x3x3_blindfolded). I hardly ever practice puzzles like MegaMinx, Clock, Pyraminx, etc. This is partly because I know I will get to do all solves during a competition anyway. If those puzzles would have a cut-off time, I know I would practice them more often also.

For the US Open 2007 and for Worlds, qualification rounds are necessary. Those qualifications are basically just cut-off times. They have motivated me to break 24 seconds on 3x3x3 and 1:30 on 4x4x4.

Managing time during competitions is very important and ideally every competitor should get the same amount (5) of attempts. But if there is not enought time, I would prefer to see the top cubers do 5 fast solves and the rest do 2 slow solves rather than everyone doing 3 solves. Let&#x27;s make this concrete: Arnaud van Galen (me) and Erik Akkersdijk both participate in a time-cramped competition on the MegaMinx.

Current situation: Erik does 3 solves (done in 6 minutes) and Arnaud does 3 solves (done in 15 minutes).
Alternative situation: Erik does 2 solves (done in 4 minutes), and 3 more solves (6 more minutes for a 10 minutes total) and Arnaud does 2 solves (done in 10 minutes).

Spectators would much rather see Erik do 5 solves instead of seeing Arnaud do 3 solves.
Erik would get a more balanced result, especially if he has a bad/pop solve and a perfect/lucky solve.
Arnaud will hopefully be satisfied that he broke his personal record and will practice more at home to qualify for all 5 solves next time.
Both Erik and Arnaud will have had the same amount of time on stage.
The event will be done 5 minutes (33%) faster.
The only disadvantage for the competition is that there is 1 extra scramble needed (current = 3+3, alternative = 5+2)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

It&#x27;s always better to be safe than sorry. I know for sure that in the 
past some competition events were set up as combined final. This is 
often done like that to have some kinda safety net. If time allows 
those were occasionally changed to ordinary qualification+final 
rounds, instead of just the scheduled combined final. Sometimes, also 
the &quot;entry limit&quot; was lifted if it was seen that time allowed more 
participants. I honestly think it&#x27;s better to play safe than to 
gamble with jam-packed programs if things start to go haywire 
timewise.

My 2 eurocents ;-)

should i take it completely apart and lube each piece, or just spray

          <div class="email-content">As far as my personal experience with the 5x5x5, I didn&#x27;t get an
average in the first two competitions I went to (one because of speed,
one because of time constraints), and since I wanted to get an average
and be on the records list I was motivated (as Arnaud said) to
practice more, but also to go to more competitions. 

Timing is a big problem, anyway, and if a competition is under strict
time constraints (such as having to be over by sunset because it is
outside) there won&#x27;t be time to give everyone an average. Although it
would be the most fair to give everyone the same amount of solves,
fairness has not always been the most important consideration; if it
was, the best solvers would not be allowed to have looser cubes than
everyone else...

          <div class="email-content">What do you mean by that?  Are you saying that it would be more fair
for everyone to use competition-provided cubes that may or may not be
anything like what they&#x27;re used to?  Then the people used to the kind
of cube which is provided are at an advantage.

And anyone can have a loose cube, not just the best solvers.

That is completely unrelated to fairness.  Everyone has the opportunity to
get a cube that they feel is comfortable.

Anyways, I couldn&#x27;t agree more with Arnaud on this one.

          <div class="email-content">Imagine a competition where someone and his friend show up. They each
can solve the cube in 9 minutes. If they have an average of 5, then
they&#x27;ve consumed and hour and half of a stackmat station.

You can a little bit get around this by saying the first round is best
of 1, times of less than 5 minutes can continue to the next round,
which is a combined average with the previous round.

But this has the downside of wasting a round (9m-9o) to weed out these
people. Also, 9p and 9g2 could potentially conflict.

When you have 10 stations, it&#x27;s not too big of a deal, but this might
affect a small competition to the point where other side events could
have to be cancelled.

Yesterday I found you can combine the 12 move alg above with 
Hardwick&#x27;s PLL-parity to solve the combined case. If you start with 
the reverse of the PLL-parity and then merge the 12 move pice swap 
you can save some turns and also change a U2+D2 to E2, like this:

u2 r2 Uu2 r2 E2 l D2 r&#x27; D2 r D2 B2 r B2 l (15)

And that saves one turn and two in the total and that gives: 276 / 24 
= 11,5

Closing in on sub 40 for the whole LL =)

like the RU moves for Step 4 Edges, They are better than the FRU algs.

          <div class="email-content">I finally got a 5x5 and occasionally get into a situation where the <br>
whole cube is solved except one of the edge pieces has the middle cubie <br>
flipped.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve seen this on a 4x4, but didn&#x27;t think the 5x5 had parity issues. <br>
Once I get into this state I have a hard time fixing it without messing <br>
up the cube and starting over.<br>

What am I doing wrong?<br>

<br>
Ah. Perhaps this is true for the 3x3x3, where you can buy DIYs and<br>
make them as tight or loose as you want within a week, but it is not<br>
for the 5x5x5 event. Getting a loose cube there, one that times in the<br>
2:20s and below are possible on, takes a lot of time and effort,<br>
months or even up to a year depending on who you ask. If you want a<br>
cube that is truly fast, you have to move fast on it, and I think that<br>
only someone who can achieve fast times can produce a cube that these<br>
times can be achieved on. Perhaps the exception is the Olympic Cube,<br>
but so far the only speedsolver with one of those (to my knowledge)<br>
would definitely be considered one of the best solvers in the world.<br>
<br>
Besides - I have yet to see a competitor who solves the 5x5x5 in over<br>
4 minutes average use a Rubik&#x27;s 5x5x5 that I would consider loose and<br>
I have yet to see a competitor who does it in under 2:30 use a Rubik&#x27;s<br>
5x5x5 that I would not consider loose. Even if you could get a loose<br>
5x5x5 out of the box, the disparity is definitely there.<br>

          <div class="email-content">My 4x4 was very stiff before I lubed it. Afterwards it turns very 
smoothly, but I have to be a bit more careful with it when turning or 
I&#x27;ll get pops.

          <div class="email-content">I thought I knew something about cubes!<br>
 I feel like the bear (or wolf) on the droopy/chilly cartoons.<br>
my jaw dragging the floor.<br>
<br>
how on earth is it possible to work a cube so dang fast!<br>
<br>
anyway, I&#x27;ve gathered there is a lot to know that i don&#x27;t!<br>
<br>
like whats the &quot;other than Rubik&quot; manufacturers that make various <br>
cubes/(functional puzzles)<br>
<br>
I have several 3x cubes. only one is Rubik. the others are junkik.<br>
I think they where called &quot;wonderful puzzler&quot; I don&#x27;t like them they <br>
don&#x27;t turn well, and a PAC man one, a key ring and necklace (mini&#x27;s)<br>
<br>
and a 2x that I took apart out of curiosity, and lost an inside <br>
center piece. (now it locks up when you turn it)<br>
<br>
I own a 4x that broke a week after i got it. actually it was the 2nd <br>
one. I pitched the first one after it broke (mistake, or i could fix <br>
this one). it was the center pieces that would break.<br>
<br>
<br>
I own a &quot;Mefferts&quot; 4x and 5x. never had them break, but have had <br>
tiles come unglued. (lost a blue one on the 4x )(yes I can solve)<br>
<br>
I own two &quot;alexanders star&#x27;s&quot;, one &quot;missing link&quot;, &quot;magic I&quot; <br>
and &quot;Magic II&quot;,a 3x &quot;ball&quot;, and a similar &quot;rubiks globe/world&quot; and <br>
some I dont know what they are<br>
<br>
I own tons of others also as I collected every functional puzzle I <br>
could get my hands on. even so, I Know of many I still dont have.<br>
<br>
any newby info about who makes what,whats good/ what to avoid/ would <br>
be apreceated.<br>

selling cubes, selling parts, giving instructions, etc.  google is your <br>
friend.<br>
<br>
also, if your 4x4 that broke is a rubik&#x27;s you can buy replacement <br>
pieces at www.cubesmith.com.  a center broke for me and i recently <br>
bought a replacement center.  so next time dont throw it away ;) just <br>
buy a replacement peice :).<br>
<br>
i use cubesmith for all my replacement stickers, etc. its a very good <br>
site, offers a lot of good items, service is great, products are geat.<br>
<br>
just some info from another cubing amateur... there are some amazing <br>
cubers here that i&#x27;m sure will give a lot better info :) but thats my 2 <br>
cents.<br>

          <div class="email-content">THX Jeff, I feel like a real dweeb for throwing it out, but that was 
years ago when they just hit the market.
I was a lot more stupid then HAHA!
 I know i didnt line out many questions. knowing how to ask them is 
one issue. Im sure i will pick up on some venacular by reading other 
postings. then i will be able to ask intelegently sounding Q:&#x27;s

          <div class="email-content">Are you sure it as you describe? Perhaps I am going to make a fool of
myself, but I think that position is impossible. If you solve as much
as possible you will see that it&#x27;s not in fact the middle cubie of the
tredge that is flipped, but it&#x27;s actually the two outer edges which
are flipped.

This is the only parity which occurs on the 5x5x5, and you can fix it
using a standard 4x4x4 OLL parity fix, and ignore the middle layer.

          <div class="email-content">I think he&#x27;s saying everything&#x27;s paired up, except one tredge, which
has the two wings swapped, giving the impression of having the central
flipped.

In that case, you would use the 4x4 &quot;OLL Parity&quot; alg.  Many use r2 B2
U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2.

Also, you can use the &quot;sloppy&quot; version, which is the same alg, but
with double layer turns instead of slices on the l&#x27;s and r&#x27;s.  it will
 swap the UL and UR tredges and swap and rotate URF and ULF.

Everyone can turn fast. You don&#x27;t have to solve the cube to turn fast
on it to try loosening the 5x5x5. And besides of it, it is more likely
that people become fast cubers because they take a lot of time and
effort to practice. So if someone never had a loose 5x5x5, apparently
they don&#x27;t practice a lot. So they will likely not be fast 5x5x5
cubers anyway. You have to suffer a bit (or maybe a lot) to become a
fast cuber and have a loose cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

For 5x5x5 I can prepare a new cube in one week to set times under 2 minutes.
Basically what I do is scratch a very thin layer from the inner side of the 
outer edges. Check out
http://www.speedcubing.com/images/outeredge.jpg for some details (red part 
is scratched and smoothened a bit with a thin knife, maybe 0.1mm is enough).

The new version of rubiks.com 5x5 seems is much even better, because for 
that version they already made the inner parts smaller.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">do you mean like F2 U&#x27; R&#x27; L F2 R L&#x27; U&#x27; F2?  that refers to what side 
you turn and how many time you turn it in what direction.  If you have 
a cube close pick it up and i will try to explain.  Hold it so that 1 
face is facing you directly.  the face you are looking directly at is 
called F.  The face on the opposite side of the cube is B.  The side on 
the right of the cube is R, and the side on the left is L.  The side on 
top is called U, and the bottom D.  here is a sideways view of what i 
attempted to explain.  maybe this works better for you.  yes i 
accidentally uploaded a 2x2 picture, but it gives the same concept.  
http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/1189/cubexo9.png

The 2s and &#x27;s represent which way you turn the specified side, and how 
many times you turn it.  Lets use U2 for an example.  U2 means you turn 
the top face 2 time.  you will never see U&#x27;2 or U2&#x27;, because no matter 
which way you turn the top face 2 time, it will always end up the same 
way.  The &#x27; mark represents a counter-clockwise turn.  R&#x27; would a be a 
turn of the R face counter clockwise (toward you).  A regular R turn 
would be turning the R face clockwise (away from you).

We will put several of these marks together to create what is called as 
an algorithm which does certain things to certain pieces on the cube.  
For exapmle, the algorithm written at the top of this post is the PLL 
(Permutation Last Layer) counter-clockwise 3-edge swap.


Now on to 4x4 and 5x5.  The have more able turns, but yet the same 
number of faces.  for example, on the 4x4 you can turn the face just 
inside the R face.  This is called the r face.  The face just inside 
the L face is called the l face.  The face just below the U face is 
called the u face, and so on.  The 2 and &#x27; rules still apply for these 
faces too.  Note: the typical u turn does NOT mean turn the U face and 
the u face together, but only the u face.

This page helps desribe the 4x4 notation a bit better, and has pretty 
pictures. http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-presolution.html (thanks 
to Chris Hardwick for his wonderful site).

phew, well i hope this helped a little bit, and that notation was what 
you were talking about.  If not i wasted my time, but anyone is allowed 
to copy this and use this as a tutorial for free :)

          <div class="email-content">to Pedro:
yes, you can use R2&#x27; for finger tricks, but are not written out 
in &quot;official&quot; algs, as R2 can be done 2 different ways.  It is up to 
the cuber on how they wish to perform that move.  R2 can be performed 
as R2 or R2&#x27;, but universal notation is still written as R2 no matter 
which direction the cuber decides to turn it.  But you bring a good 
point that algs can be interpretted in whichever way each cuber sees 
best.

to Segnet:
here we go again :)  with the basic knowledge from my other post, 
this should be easier to explain.

I don&#x27;t know the &quot;official&quot; move for the middle &quot;face&quot;.  Here is what 
i use, and what i see most often.  There are 3 middle moves.  middle 
vertical, middle horizontal, and middle &quot;flat&quot; (couldn&#x27;t find another 
word for it...). (there are 3 middles because there are 3 dimensions)

The first two middles are easily explained.  the first is the middle 
in between the R and L faces.  It can be turned up and down.  this is 
called MR.  it takes on all the properties of the R face just 1 
column to the left (the middle column).  so if it is MR&#x27; you pull MR 
down.  If it is just MR the you push MR up.  counter-clockwise MR 
(MR&#x27;) is the same movement as R&#x27; just on the MR face instead of the R 
face.  I think you get it.  The next middle is the MU face.  It is 
inbetween U and D.  Same as before, the MU takes on the same 
properties as the U face.  MU&#x27; is turned like U&#x27; just on the MU face 
(same direction).  the move MU you would push the MU face from right 
to left.

The last middle is hardest to understand in my opinion.  It is 
inbetween F and B.  it is called MF and takes on the properties of 
U.  instead of being able to see it change on the F face, it is now 
hidden behind it, and you need to tilt the cube to see it.  here is a 
MF&#x27; turn: http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/4558/cube2rr9.jpg.



Now to the ()s.  They are simply used in algs to place moves together 
to be used in finger tricks without moving the cube.  (R U R&#x27;) is an 
easy one.  try doing that in one fluent move.  That&#x27;s pretty much.  
you can learn more about finger tricks on google :D


-i&#x27;m probably wrong on something in here so someone correct me.

          <div class="email-content">In my algorithms I always write n2&#x27; when the side n is turned
anti-clockwise (in the way I perform the alg). This way you can show
the more inexperienced cuber exactly how to do it. I know it&#x27;s not
perfect, but it&#x27;s better than nothing, and it is just as useful as
bracketing moves to show finger trick sequences.

I don&#x27;t really know what you mean by &quot;official&quot; algorithms, perhaps
official scrambling algorithms don&#x27;t use this but they don&#x27;t really
count :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

That diagram is awful. But I do half agree with you, by making some
cuts with the knife (48 in total) to the wing edges you can make the
cube much nicer for speedcubing with not much effort, but I don&#x27;t
personally think it would always go from being new to a &lt;2 min
speedcube immediately. However, I&#x27;ve only ever had one 5x5x5, and I&#x27;ve
had it for getting on for 4 years, and it&#x27;s still a little stiff, even
with a LOT of practice and cutting with a knife. Perhaps I should
clean it inside :)

          <div class="email-content">The issue was the fairness of the competition (in relation to reaching a cut-off time). Eastsheen 5x5x5&#x27;s are generally available (I bought a 4x4x4 with pictures in a bookstore in Chicago) and if a &quot;30 seconds 3x3x3 solver&quot; can get 2nd place with a new cube at a big tournament like the US Open, than I consider that prove enough that fairness is guaranteed.

PS1. This topic has gone from a &quot;congratulations on your WR&quot;-topic to a &quot;let&#x27;s change the rules&quot;-topic (my fault) to a fairness-topic (not my fault). If anyone wants to add to the &quot;let&#x27;s change the rules&quot;-topic or to the fairness-topic, it might be better to start another topic.

PS2. Congrats Jonathan, on your amazing 5x5x5 results!

This is the image i sent to 7towns before they improved the 5x5x5

          <div class="email-content">well by &quot;official&quot; i meant the most popular universal notation.  
there technicaly is no official notation (thats why official was 
in &quot;&quot;), it is rather whatever the author decides to write it as.  
Yes, R2&#x27; can be used, but it is not as popular to use as R2 that can 
be done either way.  Notation can be done however each individual 
person wants to do it, since there is no right and wrong way, as long 
as you clearify how to perform each notated move.  I was simply 
describing the most common notation.

yes, you can use R2&#x27; for finger tricks, but are not written out

the cuber on how they wish to perform that move. R2 can be performed 
as R2 or R2&#x27;, but universal notation is still written as R2 no matter 
which direction the cuber decides to turn it. But you bring a good 
point that algs can be interpretted in whichever way each cuber sees 
best.

to Segnet:
here we go again :) with the basic knowledge from my other post, 
this should be easier to explain.

I don&#x27;t know the &quot;official&quot; move for the middle &quot;face&quot;. Here is what 
i use, and what i see most often. There are 3 middle moves. middle 
vertical, middle horizontal, and middle &quot;flat&quot; (couldn&#x27;t find another 
word for it...). (there are 3 middles because there are 3 dimensions)

The first two middles are easily explained. the first is the middle 
in between the R and L faces. It can be turned up and down. this is 
called MR. it takes on all the properties of the R face just 1 
column to the left (the middle column). so if it is MR&#x27; you pull MR 
down. If it is just MR the you push MR up. counter-clockwise MR 
(MR&#x27;) is the same movement as R&#x27; just on the MR face instead of the R 
face. I think you get it. The next middle is the MU face. It is 
inbetween U and D. Same as before, the MU takes on the same 
properties as the U face. MU&#x27; is turned like U&#x27; just on the MU face 
(same direction). the move MU you would push the MU face from right 
to left.

The last middle is hardest to understand in my opinion. It is 
inbetween F and B. it is called MF and takes on the properties of 
U. instead of being able to see it change on the F face, it is now 
hidden behind it, and you need to tilt the cube to see it. here is a 
MF&#x27; turn: http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/4558/cube2rr9.jpg.

Now to the ()s. They are simply used in algs to place moves together 
to be used in finger tricks without moving the cube. (R U R&#x27;) is an 
easy one. try doing that in one fluent move. That&#x27;s pretty much. 
you can learn more about finger tricks on google :D

-i&#x27;m probably wrong on something in here so someone correct me.

          <div class="email-content">well, I took my meffert&#x27;s 5x apart last night and dowsed each tiles <br>
edge with CA glue.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m glad i took it apart to do this as I would most definitely have <br>
glued the cube into one massive block of resin. (not good)<br>
<br>
after all was dry, i went to re-assemble it.<br>
OMG! I thought i was never going to get it back together I ended up <br>
after a lot of work with 3 bottom rows together, and the two top rows <br>
3/5th the way assembled<br>
<br>
so i had 3 complete rows bottom-up, and three complete rows back-<br>
forward.<br>
<br>
the rest was a big struggle that required some strategic manipulation <br>
to get the last middle edge piece in (MFU).<br>
then came the last of the center pieces, edge pieces RUf and LUf,   <br>
and corners, and finally the last (rFU) and (lFU) edge pieces.<br>
<br>
everything&#x27;s back together, and working great.<br>
now I wont have to worry about loseing the tiles.<br>

But I will have to disagree with you about the availability of the
Eastsheen 5x5x5 cubes. I do not know of any seller on the North
American continent other than opticubes.com of those cubes, since your
example is of a 4x4x4 cube...

And a little digression isn&#x27;t necessarily bad. :)

Apply that to a solved cube.  You&#x27;ll see what it does.
Apply it again and it&#x27;ll solve it.
The alg swaps two opposite edges and two opposite corners on the top layer,
and it preserves orientation.

so, for you who bought from cube4you/9spuzzles, I&#x27;d like to ask some things:<br>
<br>
they say that type a is better than c, that&#x27;s better than b...is that right?<br>
and how are their stickers? any good? better than Rubik&#x27;s? better than Cubesmith?<br>

another thing...<br>

for you who made a blind cube, how did you do it? which material did you use to make the different textures?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys and gals,<br>
<br>
I am PJ age 36 from UK, I am not a total beginner nor am I an <br>
intermediate, I can solve a rubik cube in avg of 3 to 5 mins using a <br>
weird 3 stage 1-side then 2-side leading to 3 or 4 needed flipped <br>
edge solving.<br>
<br>
Found this group and Jasmine and Dan website and is under process of <br>
attempting to learn to speed cube.  My question is this, is there an <br>
easy way to remember the algorithm involved leading to the 1st stage <br>
of cross and then the rest of the algorithm leading to 1st 2 layers <br>
to Last layer to solved cube?<br>
<br>
All them letters and all the methods of leading to solved cube is <br>
like mind boggling!  I know practise make you perfect and faster, but <br>
watching these guys in action and solving the cubes in under 30 <br>
secods is fast and yet they don&#x27;t seems to be noticing where the <br>
colours edges are, they just pound away from scrambled to solved.  IS <br>
there a 1 way non colour oriented solution from scrambled to solved <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey PJ,

The memory part, only you can find your best way of learning. For me,
repetition is best. That way it becomes muscle memory and i don&#x27;t have
to think. Not thinking allows me to look ahead for pieces; so i can do
the algorithm right away. You repeat this, so you *almost* never stop
during the solve. Thats what i think your perceiving when you are
watching those sub 30 solves. So no method where you don&#x27;t need to
know where the pieces are.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, Corwin.

So down to repeating over and over and over again till it come 
natural.  I guess the 1st 2 layers thing will take me some time to 
grasp!  But at some point I do refer back to my old methods of 
solving which is confusing somewhat.  Just need to get used to the 2 
layer methods.

My method of solving is this way (I try my best to describe the 
scrambled to solved moves)

Stage 1 - 2 sets of moves, 1st bring all corners to correct oriented 
cubelet. 2nd bring any 3 edge cubelet leaving the 4th unsolved as 
this will be solved in Stage 2.

Stage 2 - 2 sets of moves, 1st check corners r in correct position 
before rotating 3 corners at once. If no corners are in correct 
poition then do 2 corners swap till all corners are in correct 
position. 2nd bring in edges using unsolved as guide to slot in edhes 
for 2nd side, on the last edge may need to repeat to bring in 2 last 
(1 unsolved and 1 final edge) to complete 2 side - top/bottom or 
left/right or back/front.

Stage 3 - 2 set of moves reposition edges in correct place and flip 
them to complete solved cube.

My errors is once I got the cross and corners sorted I got the 2nd 
side corners sorted and therefore got me confused cos it an habit of 
doing 1 side then 2nd side!

If you want me to write the moves out I could do once I get used to 
writing the moves ok and all the state you can find possible.  Or 
does someone regconise this methods of cube solving?

Been cubing on and off since late 80&#x27;s but managed to do a complete 
cube solved in early 90&#x27;s has used something like 3 cubes 1 my mum 
got from USA in the 80 (broken in pieces the screw to axis worn away 
the insides) brought another cube but non-offical and still have 1 to 
this date and works like a charm but not ideal for speed cubing so 
shall soon order one from Dan Harris site one day and try that.

His second best blindfolded time at Czech Open 2007 was 55.xx seconds.
Some other results he had:
13.15 average in 3x3 first round.
59.xx average in 4x4 final.
1:52.xx average in 5x5 final.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s the most amazing thing about Matyas. He&#x27;s the best or among the
best in almost every event. Most guys have to focus on a few events,
but I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of how much time you spend on serious
cubing. 

I, myself, have just started cubing again after a nine-day visit at
the Roskilde festival. I lost a little speed but not much. I&#x27;m hoping
to get a sub-60 average for 4x4 before the WC07.

Are you still using Eastsheen? A sub 60 avg with eastsheen is in my 
opinion a better achievement than sub 55 with rubiks/studio revenge :)

Good luck!!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per!

I switched to Rubik&#x27;s 4x4 quite a while ago. My 57s competition time
at German Open was made with a Rubik&#x27;s version. I&#x27;m getting sub-60
single times quite often now. Around one or two out of 12 solves. I
can still improve a lot, I think, especially on the 3x3-step.

there&#x27;s an option called Network Timer, at the top...you can either host a server or connect to one...you just need your ip and a port

how are your times? we could race sometime...

          <div class="email-content">Corwin is right. lubing it will make it pop, but you will have a good 4x4 speedcube. my advice: go ahead and lube it, but don&#x27;t overdo it. lube the pieces like a regular 3x3, but DO NOT lube the center mechanism.

          <div class="email-content">i have had rubik;s diy and usually they either pop to much or aren&#x27;t
loose enough for me. and by 4 part i mean it has a screw, a spring, a
small washer for the bottom side of the spring then a large washer for
the top side. Where as most cubes have just a screw, a spring and a

I didn&#x27;t really understand what you meant :P

http://pjgat09.gotdns.com/old/P3110019.jpg

there is a 5x5x5 edge picture...could you make an after/before
comparison or maybe put arrows or something to show where I should
modify them, please?

I&#x27;m not a sub-2 solver (neither I see myself there soon), but I guess
a better cube can just help my times :)

          Hi guys,

His second best blindfolded time at Czech Open 2007
was 55.xx seconds.
Some other results he had:
13.15 average in 3x3 first round.
59.xx average in 4x4 final.
1:52.xx average in 5x5 final.

Have fun,

Ron

No suprise there.... he is amazing.  Did he break the
4x4 BLD WR too?

Congrats Matyas.

  That&#x27;s the most amazing thing about Matyas. He&#x27;s the
best or among the
best in almost every event. Most guys have to focus on
a few events,
but I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of how much time you
spend on serious
cubing. 

I, myself, have just started cubing again after a
nine-day visit at
the Roskilde festival. I lost a little speed but not
much. I&#x27;m hoping
to get a sub-60 average for 4x4 before the WC07.

Are you still using Eastsheen? A sub 60 avg with
eastsheen is in my 
opinion a better achievement than sub 55 with
rubiks/studio revenge :)

Good luck!!

  Hi Per!

I switched to Rubik&#x27;s 4x4 quite a while ago. My 57s
competition time
at German Open was made with a Rubik&#x27;s version. I&#x27;m
getting sub-60
single times quite often now. Around one or two out of
12 solves. I
can still improve a lot, I think, especially on the
3x3-step.

Yes i was a bit confused whether he meant 2 swaps or a 4-cycle. My 
suggestion replaces avgalens suggestion.

The exact best solution will depend on what corners are acceptable to 
mess about with ;-)

That&#x27;s the wrong edge piece. You need to make cuts to the wing edges
(both edges either side of that centre-edge).

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody,

Just got back from the Czech Open..! It was a nice competition. I
didn&#x27;t get manz personal successes, but most people did: Especially
Mathyas, but also Erik Akkersdijk. Congratz to both of them.

I know Kai Jiptner has a video of the 3x3 bld record.

I shot the 4x4 BLD record (just missed the first 2 minutes of the
solve approximately), and also the 5x5 BLD record (also missed the
first bit of the whole thing, but I got the part where he started
solving, and the memorization part is boring anyway :)). I&#x27;ll upload
them sometimes when I feel like it... Be patient :p.

- JoÃ«l.

Using CCT, you can all have the same scramble, see what everyone

have to start a server to race your friends. The server is listed on
the website. Just go to connect to server or ctrl+n.

2 times lucky?? Or 5 cubes in under 10 minutes blindfolded, that can&#x27;t

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ....

I think your problem is that Internet Explorer renamed the file for 
you during download. Change the .zip extension to .jar and you should 
be ok. Alternatively try to dl again with firefox this time. It 
shouldn&#x27;t mess up the file. Gosh i absoluty f***** hate what IE does 
to files sometimes in it&#x27;s stupid eagerness to &quot;help&quot;.

Good luck!

What? What happened to the problem you were having earlier? Something <br>
about it hanging on the splash screen? Is that gone now? If so, then <br>
you should be able to just double-click on the file CALCubeTimer.jar, <br>
it&#x27;s no different than doing the command prompt stuff I told you to do.<br>

What? What happened to the problem you were having earlier? Something 
about it hanging on the splash screen? Is that gone now? If so, then 
you should be able to just double-click on the file CALCubeTimer.jar, 
it&#x27;s no different than doing the command prompt stuff I told you to do.

I&#x27;m glad I could help.

  Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
We are going to have a Caltech Summer competition this year. It will<br>
be on Saturday, August 25 at 10:00 am in Winnett Lounge at Caltech<br>
(registration will be at 9). We will have 3x3x3 speedsolve, 3x3x3<br>
one-handed, 3x3x3 blindfolded, 4x4x4 speedsolve, 2x2x2 speedsolve, and<br>
Pyraminx. Entry fee is $5 for the first event and $2 for each<br>
additional event you compete in.<br>
<br>
Also, Caltech Fall will be held on Saturday, November 10 at 10:00 am<br>
in Winnett Lounge. We don&#x27;t know the events or cost yet, but just keep<br>
that date clear.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I tested this out the other day.  I went ahead and shaved off a tiny bit on
each of the inter parts of the out edges.  I put it back together, and it
makes a considerable different.  Before my cube was decent, but still hard.
Now it moves real freely now.  I think just 10 or so more solves will make
it perfect.  Thanks Ron for the tips.

          <div class="email-content">Kai Jiptner and I were discussing the following after he reached 2nd <br>
place on 3x3x3_bf at the Czech Open last week:<br>
1st = 54.83, 2nd = 3:50.29.<br>
This means 1st place is 4.2 times faster than 2nd place.<br>
<br>
Challenge: Was there ever an event during a competition where there was <br>
a bigger difference between 1st and 2nd place?<br>
<br>
Answer: Probably not (but let us know if we are wrong), untill a couple <br>
of hours later. 5x5x5_bf: 1st = 10:05.16, 2nd = 1:15:41.90. Difference <br>
= 7.51 times faster. (and this is an alternative answer: 3x3x3_mbf: 1st <br>

picture, and also this one:

And you will see Ron&#x27;s picture is actually pretty good when you understand
what part he is drawing.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, that image is correct, and I also shaved off that very bottom part a
big, directly below and to the left of the red line.  I just used a sharp
knife and ran it back and forth to shave up a bit.  Ron said 0.1 of a mm, so
I just did a couple strokes until I think it was enough.

It&#x27;s cycle method but at least it&#x27;s something.

That phrase is pretty stupid. Just as the real cube was making a 
comeback... Darn you product testers!

          <div class="email-content">Let&#x27;s summarize:

1) Using the Rubik&#x27;s brand is mostly done for marketing purposes. Having six faces so you can&#x27;t see all colors at once is the only other good reason to make it look like a cube.
2) It doesn&#x27;t turn, scramble, solve or involve insight. It isn&#x27;t even a puzzle.
3) The &quot;mechanism&quot;/electronics were basically ripped/copied from another puzzle (search for a previous post by Stefan Pochmann)

So at first glance, it just looks like it is a purely commercial toy and not a brain-challenge. BUT if you actually start playing with it (preferably later in the evening, with friends and in a silly/tipsy mood), it turns out to be pretty fun to do anyway. I could easily leave it untoched for a month, but when I play with it, it is fun!

I guess there may be a different answer depending if you are 
interested in the time ratio or time difference.

For 4x4x4 blind 8 mins and 12 mins has a difference of 240 secs and 
the ratio is 1.5 (3/2).

Take pyraminx speed 4 secs and 20 secs. Difference only 16 secs but 
the ratio is a staggering 5.

These are made-up examples :D

In multiple blindfolded the first one had 7/7 and the second one had 4/5.

&quot;speed solve rubik&#x27;s cube&quot; yielded several useful sites. The links
section of this group also has plenty.

So did you actually look, or did you come straight here and expect
people to spoon feed you information? We are much more likely to help
those who help themselves. Keep that in mind.

Have a nice day

in form that came with my 3x3x3 R/C.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve never learned another method. I don&#x27;t consider myself a speed <br>
cuber, but can do it in less that 2 min. easy.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve since purchased a meffert&#x27;s 4x and 5x and have learned how to <br>
solve using the solution for the 5x on that site. (but still use my <br>
already learned method to set the bottom 4 corners) and bottom edges.<br>
then I use:<br>
1) B u&#x27; B&#x27; u B&#x27; r&#x27; B r and<br>
2) B H&#x27; B&#x27; H B&#x27; M&#x27; B M and<br>
3) B d B&#x27; d&#x27; B&#x27; l B l to move and set 3 sets of edges<br>
<br>
<br>
also sometimes a slice is in BL+ BR+ FL- and FR- so I do<br>
move 1,2,or 3 above then...<br>
<br>
 (UuH) D&#x27;<br>
<br>
then do move 1,2,or 3 again.<br>
and then move D&#x27; and u&#x27;,H&#x27;, or d to put it all back again. then a <br>
variation of that for the points and crosses around the centers<br>

precede with F and R turns as required then...<br>

4) b u&#x27; b&#x27; u Bb&#x27; r&#x27; b r B for the points and<br>

<br>
undo the F and R turns previously made.<br>
<br>
often I turn the mirror of the above moves looking at the left face <br>
instead of the right face as above noted as needed.<br>
<br>
(I haven&#x27;t been good enough to do the inverse of these moves yet <br>
without messing up) I just do them twice when I need too.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve  tried to solve the 4x and 5x with a method I found online at <br>
www.alchemistmatt.com/cube/5by5cube.html (step 6) that solves the <br>
centers first then sets the edges together, and then goes about <br>
solving just as if it where a 3x3.<br>
<br>
I like this idea, but am finding it very difficult as there are too <br>
many algs to remember for moving the edges around without disrupting <br>
the centers.<br>
<br>
I also find it uncomfortable to work the back of the cube like that <br>
does.<br>

anyone got a helpful idea?<br>

rubik&#x27;s cube under 1 minute with practice.  I&#x27;ve heard stories of
people averaging sub-20 with beginner layer by layer methods.  Unless
you&#x27;re sight-solving with a blindfold method, I refuse to believe that
you can&#x27;t solve under a minute without a bit more practice.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I just read the first couple paragraphs (up to the algorithms)
and your last one. AlchemistMatt&#x27;s site is very bad, in my opinion.
The fastest solve I managed to pull of using his method was still
super-6 (centers 2.5-3 min, edges 3 min, 3x3x3 1 min). The concepts
are okay, but the algorithms are not. Centers should be done
intuitively and the first 10 edges also intuitively. Check out
bigcubes.com.

There is also nothing stopping you from making cube rotations and
applying the algorithms from a different angle.

Hope it helps.

Well, my experience is that although doing this modification did
improve the cube a bit it is definitely not a &#x27;silver bullet&#x27;... it&#x27;s
still hard to turn, especially the outer slices, and I don&#x27;t feel that
I would be able to &quot;set times under 2 minutes&quot; with this cube unless I
did serious strength training on my fingers and wrists.

I did do an average of 12 on the cube, to see if it would improve a
bit with time, and the best solve of the average was 2:14. That&#x27;s not
that bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t be any more likely to call my cube &#x27;fast&#x27;

          <div class="email-content">Maybe you guys didn&#x27;t shave enough off... or maybe use more silicone to make
them run smoother.  Of course you have to use your cube more to make it more
loose, but it did a real job on my 5x5.

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Adam P. Larsen&quot; &lt;aplarsen@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">I blew mine up once too.  I think I superglued it together the last
time, so I won&#x27;t be able to take it apart and give you (and everyone
else) really good directions.  However, I do remember most of how I
did it because I had to do trial and error to re-assemble, and I was
unable to find any kind of hints on the web.

Make sure you have all the pieces first.  I was missing one for the
first several attempts, and I made it nowhere.  There should be a
3-dimensional cross with 6 axles on it.  There should be 3 pieces that
are shaped like chess rooks (like a castles spire) that fit over the
axles and spin freely.  The other 3 rook shapes are just like the 3
fixed axles on the cross.  You should also have 12 pieces shaped like
strange sandwiches.  3 of them are different from the others...they
have a side that is longer than the other.  The last, of course, are
the 8 cubies.

Pick one of the corners to be your cornerstone.  Make it
red-yellow-blue if your cube has one.  Start assembling the bottom
level of the cube, with the blue side down.  You must assemble it
correctly, but I&#x27;m assuming you knew that if you&#x27;re blindsolving. ;)

Once you have the 4 bottom cubies lying on the table, take 2 of the
sandwiches with a longer side and drop them between the cubies so that
the longer side of the sandwich is inside the slot on the cornerstone
side.  MAKE SURE that the longer of the 2 sides is slid into the
cornerstone cubie.  Failure to do this will result in a locked up
cube.  For example, if your cornerstone is R-Y-B, one sandwich will be
between the 2 cubies with a red face, and the other will be between
those with a yellow face.  Again, the longer sides must be in the
cornerstone cubie.  The 9-degree angle of the sandwich should point
toward what will be the center of the cube.

Take 2 of the even-sided sandwiches and place them in the other 2
spaces between the cubies.  The 4 sandwiches will probably slide
together toward the center, but you&#x27;ll fix that in the next step.  

Take the third uneven sandwich piece and slide it into the
cornerstone.  Again, the longer side needs to be on the cornerstone&#x27;s
slot.  Half of this sandwich should be sticking out because there are
no cubies on the top.  Take 3 of the even sandwiches and slide them
the same way, so that you have a layer of 4 sandwiches hanging out
above the bottom row of cubies.

Now, you can drop the cross into the middle. Drop the cross into the
space so that the 3 fixed rooks are touching the 3 sides of the
cornerstone cubie.  Use the cross to push the 4 bottom sandwiches out
away from the center of the cube while you drop it into place.  Slide
the rest of the rooks onto the other 3 arms.

>From here, it&#x27;s going to be tough.  I really can&#x27;t picture how I did
this step anymore.  You&#x27;ve got a solid start at this point, so it
should alright to do trial and error to fit the last 4 cubies on.

The cubies then need to slide over the sandwiches while they are being
pushed over the rook pieces.  Did one of the cubies break or pull
apart?  That&#x27;s the only way I can think of this cube coming apart.  If
that is the case, then it should be the last cubie to be added to the
assembly.  Put the other 3 on, and then slide the panel into place,
followed by the rest of the separated cubie. 

It should be completed.  I would hold it very carefully and rotate
across all 3 axes.  Make sure you don&#x27;t allow the broken cubie to come
apart and make it all explode again.  One you&#x27;ve determined that it&#x27;s
solid enough, slide the broken cubie apart and glue it together as you
put it back on.

If no panel came off, I have no idea how to put that last cubie on. 
I&#x27;m not even sure how they would have put it together at the factory.
 If that is the case, however, I&#x27;d find which one of the panels was
attached at assembly time and try to pry it apart.  Otherwise, it
would be really difficult to re-assemble...or take apart while
blindsolving, for that matter.

Good luck...let us know how it turns out.  And if I&#x27;m wrong on the
piece count inside, let me know that too.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve
ever typed this all out, so I&#x27;d like to know if I remembered it
correctly (it was 5 years ago when mine broke).  I wish I could post
pictures, but I&#x27;d have to break a glue bond to get mine apart again.

          <div class="email-content">How would you physically modify a 4x4x4 to run smoother?  I bought one<br>
(Rubik&#x27;s) on 9spuzzles and it was a piece of shit, so I took a file and some<br>

initially a lemon.  All my attempts were unsuccessful, showing no benefit,<br>
but detriment instead.<br>
<br>
I have a new 4x4x4 that I&#x27;m beginning to break in, and after reading your<br>
posts (Ron, Pat, etc.) I&#x27;m curious if any of you have reduced the thickness<br>
of plastic of certain pieces in the 4x4x4 and successfully decreased the<br>
internal friction (similar to how you&#x27;ve done with the 5x5x5).<br>

<br>
<br>
  I started solving with the solution that was available from the mail <br>
  in form that came with my 3x3x3 R/C.<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ve never learned another method. I don&#x27;t consider myself a speed <br>
  cuber, but can do it in less that 2 min. easy.<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ve since purchased a meffert&#x27;s 4x and 5x and have learned how to <br>
  solve using the solution for the 5x on that site. (but still use my <br>
  already learned method to set the bottom 4 corners) and bottom edges.<br>
  then I use:<br>
  1) B u&#x27; B&#x27; u B&#x27; r&#x27; B r and<br>
  2) B H&#x27; B&#x27; H B&#x27; M&#x27; B M and<br>
  3) B d B&#x27; d&#x27; B&#x27; l B l to move and set 3 sets of edges<br>
<br>
  also sometimes a slice is in BL+ BR+ FL- and FR- so I do<br>
  move 1,2,or 3 above then...<br>
<br>
  (UuH) D&#x27;<br>
<br>
  then do move 1,2,or 3 again.<br>
  and then move D&#x27; and u&#x27;,H&#x27;, or d to put it all back again. then a <br>
  variation of that for the points and crosses around the centers<br>
<br>
  precede with F and R turns as required then...<br>
<br>
  4) b u&#x27; b&#x27; u Bb&#x27; r&#x27; b r B for the points and<br>
  5) b H&#x27; b&#x27; H Bb&#x27; M&#x27; b M B for the crosses<br>
<br>
  undo the F and R turns previously made.<br>
<br>
  often I turn the mirror of the above moves looking at the left face <br>
  instead of the right face as above noted as needed.<br>
<br>
  (I haven&#x27;t been good enough to do the inverse of these moves yet <br>
  without messing up) I just do them twice when I need too.<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ve tried to solve the 4x and 5x with a method I found online at <br>
  www.alchemistmatt.com/cube/5by5cube.html (step 6) that solves the <br>
  centers first then sets the edges together, and then goes about <br>
  solving just as if it where a 3x3.<br>
<br>
  I like this idea, but am finding it very difficult as there are too <br>
  many algs to remember for moving the edges around without disrupting <br>
  the centers.<br>
<br>
  I also find it uncomfortable to work the back of the cube like that <br>
  does.<br>
<br>
  anyone got a helpful idea?<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow, thanks for all the info. Unfortunately, it was a pop, so no
pieces were damaged. That made the last piece impossible(at least for
me) to pull it over the wedge thing. I plan on buying a 2x2 eastsheen
later, so hopefully that doesn&#x27;t happen again. Thanks though. Oh and
you did get all the pieces right =)

          <div class="email-content">I think you need to know the colorscheme of your cube. An easy way is this (somewhat philosophical):<br>
<br>
There are 3 elements on the cube, spread on opposite sides each:<br>
Water (Green-Blue)<br>
Fire (Red-Orange)<br>
Light (White-Yellow)<br>
<br>
If you look at a cube you always see three colors and from that you can immediately know what the other three are. If you want to know your color-scheme even better you can practice by looking at only 2 colors and calculate the other 4 (hint: BOY or Blue-Orange-Yellow). A very good way to practice this is Ortega on a 2x2x2 or Centers on a 4x4x4.<br>
<br>
If you learned how to do F2L intuitively, check to see if you don&#x27;t wast to many moves. 7 moves is the average.<br>
<br>
Learning F2L from all angles is a good thing and if you learned F2L intuitively this should come naturally. This also means that d and d&#x27; turns will not be necessary very often. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use cube-rotations to avoid a B&#x27; U B situation though!<br>
<br>
And 4 to 7 seconds for cross should become 2 to 3 seconds. You can plan those 7 moves for 15 seconds!<br>
<br>
It seems that you know what you can do to improve so all you need to do is train, train, train and than practice, practice, practice.<br>
<br>
(P.S. I don&#x27;t use regular F2L myself. I use a simpler but slower version of it called keyhole. I can average around 15/16 seconds for Cross+F2L)<br>

If you look on all of the cubies, you should be able to find one that
has a seam on it.  That&#x27;s where mine came apart.  One of those
slide-over panels should be able to pop off, even if it requires a bit
of forcing.

I watched your videos on 5x edges and centers. an excelent job! very 
helpfull. however, Im haveing trouble seeing it slow enough to get it 
down. can you put the algs for the edges in writing here?
thanx

it looks like you are dividing it into 2 parts with a setup move in 
between.
does it matter where you &quot;store&quot; the completed edges?are there any 
spots you should not put them to avoid messing them up?

yesterday I discovered a method(on the 4x ) that puts an edge 
together and stores it in the U slice. when it&#x27;s full you turn the 
cube over (make U the D and D the U ) and build and store 4 more.
leaving 4 working edges. then there is more special moves to fix them.
I dont have it down yet. (i like your method better).

I&#x27;d love to have it in writing so i can print it out.
does your method also work on the 4x? of cource you wont have a 
center edge piece to aim for. one will just have to imagine one I 
guess.

Thanks for the help Jon, your site is very helpful with the java 
cubes and all, and it will be even better when it can clear up some 
uncovered details. it left me with a lot of questions...

like this...(quotation from your site)
&quot;pairing up edges can be done almost entirely with the method shown 
below, the idea is a very familiar one, fix something, replace it 
with something else that isn&#x27;t fixed to move the fixed group out of 
the way, then restore what part was broke while fixing the first 
group.&quot;

this is so generic, it leaves me wondering how to setup, where to 
position the edges, where not to put solved ones etc...
how not to undo already done edges.

how many solved edges are able to be done this way before another 
method must be used, if any.

forgive me if I&#x27;ve missed something here, I am a beginner at cubing, 
Ive only &quot;learned algs&quot; to blindly handle what needs done. never 
really understanding whats going on. just being amazed every time I 
get to a solved state. (following detailed instructions)
and have been able to get somewhat good at it on the 3x.
being &quot;intuitive&quot; is something I&#x27;m not to good at yet.

          <div class="email-content">Yes. That&#x27;s normal. If you want a cube more suitable for 
speedcubing, you can try your luck with another store bought cube, 
or you can buy one of the DIY kits from Rubiks.com, which allows you 
to adjust the tightness of the screws.

          <div class="email-content">well not to be a party pooper but that is actually mine and frank morris&#x27; site, maybe i can help you with your misunderstandings. the main idea in the beginner edges method is that you do have a lot of freedom so that&#x27;s why it sounds so generic, if you&#x27;re using the basic method there is very few things you can do to screw up fixed edges already, and there isn&#x27;t really a setup just get the pieces across from each other as shown in the example applet, slice them together, and when you kick it to either side, don&#x27;t replace it with an edge you&#x27;ve already fixed.  simple as that.  however i recommend that you check out the advanced method as it is much better, and the same basic ideas apply, the only difference is there is a ring that you dpnt want fixed edges ( either E or M for most cubers) if you&#x27;d like to message me on yim feel free to do so at anytime, glad you like the site

  When I got my 4x4 Rubiks, it was very tight.  However, I messed with it
somewhat, then added silicone, and within a couple days it was perfect for
me.  I am not sure how common it is, but it is the same now as it was back
then, and I really like it.  Sub-60 second solves are for sure possible on
it.

          <div class="email-content">Perhaps you would consider sending it to me then? :) I lubed my brand
new 4x4x4 with silicon, and it immediately went too loose. It has more
lock-ups than a high security prison.

Now I am desperately in need of a competition 4x4x4 :(

Cheers,
Dan

          <div class="email-content">Hmmm ..

More tips? Well dont shave off too much or you will have problems 
with twisting corner centers. There should be some sanding mod that 
fixes this terrible problem, but i haven&#x27;t figured out how yet. 
Another thing to do to make the cube more loose that i haven&#x27;t got 
round to try out yet is to shave off underneath the &quot;center plates&quot;. 
No not the small external ones, i mean the bigger ones below that. 
Those who hold the central edges and corners in place. Do this at 
your own risk !! You have been warned.

Yet another (expensive) tip is to make hybrid cube witk rubiks.com 
pieces and mefferts core. Then yuo get adjustable tension and smooth 
well moulded cubies. The mefferts molding has a lower quality IMHO :D

          <div class="email-content">If it really bothers you use some Goo-Gone to get it off, but it&#x27;s not
like it will affect your new tiles adversely if you leave it on. Old
glue makes new stickers look kind of lumpy, but since you&#x27;re using
tiles it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. The next time you resticker the glue
will come off with the stickers/tiles.

          <div class="email-content">For speeding up F2L, nothing helps like practice, practice, practice.
Focus on looking ahead so that you see what you&#x27;re going to do next as
you&#x27;re working on your current pair. A good exercise is to do your F2L
a little slower than you would normally do, but try to make your
movements continuous, without pausing to look for pieces in between moves.

I got down to the last two edges and cant seam to fix it.
I have them in LF and RF
edge piece dFR matches HFR
I turn dRUR&#x27;d&#x27; (like in the video)
and it messes up an edge piece that was in UB and puts it in 
(uR,HR,dL)

also tried the parity fix ((Dd) B2)x5
doesnt seam to do anything but mess everything up again.

HELP PLEASE!

You should use the 4x4x4 dedge flip (parity) alg.  It works on the 5x5 too<br>
-- flips two edge wings obviously.  I&#x27;ve run into the ((Dd) B2)x5 alg<br>
before, however it can be written like this: ((Rr) U2)x5 (inherently<br>
easier), and this solves along the M slice instead of E.  I wasn&#x27;t ever sure<br>
how to apply it, unless the last 4 tredges made up 2 &quot;edge flip/swap&quot; (with<br>
parity) cases (on bigcubes).  Maybe it&#x27;s a quick parity fix if you can<br>
notice a parity on the last 4 edges without having solved any?  (Clancy?)<br>
Bigcubes doesn&#x27;t list that alg anyways, but it is shorter than the common<br>
4x4x4 edge flip parity fix, though obviously doesn&#x27;t isolate one tredge.<br>
<br>
As for your situation... look at the bigcubes page about the last two<br>
tredges and figure out which of those situations you have (Clancy and Frank<br>
listed all of them).  When you say:<br>
<br>
&quot;I got down to the last two edges and cant seam to fix it.<br>

I turn dRUR&#x27;d&#x27; (like in the video)<br>
and it messes up an edge piece that was in UB and puts it in<br>

          <div class="email-content">yes that parity alg isn&#x27;t the greatest, i like the 4x4 dedge flip much better, but there is a number of algs on the edges page that will fix parity.  there is a way to tell very early in the last 4 edges if you have parity or not, and u can use any of those algs to fix it, and it will usually leave you with an easy case, this was left as a &#x27;self-discovery&#x27; point for people that use the page, as explaining all the dynamics of it can get pretty ugly.  

 ... we don&#x27;t know what orientation those pieces have by how you&#x27;ve
 explained, and the orientation of each piece plays a part in determining the
 situation.

this is a very true statment.  i recommend just taking a picture or making a quick colored line drawing for us to check and then we can associate it to the proper case on the l2e page for bigcubes.  you might even be able to do it yourself, just look for a case that matches yours, if you can&#x27;t find one, then you need to flip one of the tredges upside down and you will have a listed case.  hope this helps, if not bust out a picture and we&#x27;ll get you fixed up

A quick search led me to construct this algorithm:

R&#x27; U2 L F&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L F L&#x27; U2 R

Hope it&#x27;s useful. For obvious reasons, no such algo with only L,U and 
R turns exists for this purpose ;-)

          <div class="email-content">
taking a photo seams to be a good idea. however I resorted to doing
this (which messes up the centers)

::uL and uR need swapping (no flipping)
::Bu&#x27;B&#x27;uB&#x27;r&#x27;BrD
::rotate whole cube CW 90 deg (makes B the R face)
::do above moves again except for the last D
::bring the u and D slices back again.

if a parity problem shows up I rotate D2 and do the mirror of the 
above moves on the appropriate slices

and the same thing again only subbing a different horizontal slice 
and also using the appropriate vertical slice

this moves 3 edges around and then back again from the other side
ultimately only switching the R and L edges
but it messes up the work i did on the centers so i had to fix that 
again with the same move only doing all slice moves and one bB&#x27; move

on my next scramble I will take photos.
anything I can leave off? (reduce # of photos taken)?

I have another question...I&#x27;ve noticed that some of you are talking 
about &quot;the last 4 edges&quot; vs &quot;the last 2 edges&quot;
am I trying to do too much? should i stop at having 8 solved edges? 
before I change strategy? or should I go for 10?
whats easier to do/remember?

should i post the photos in the photo section here? or put them 
somewhere else?

          <div class="email-content">first of all, somebody said less than 10 posts ago that they developed
another cube timer.

secondly, if you were to search the group for &quot;cube timer,&quot; you would
find several good results.

Please do at least a search before asking your question because it can
be answered quite easily on your own.

Could you please extract the program from the .rar folder.  I don&#x27;t 
have WinRar and I can&#x27;t open it.  I&#x27;m really interested in your

          <div class="email-content">Hi :)

Seriously, WinRar is a MUST HAVE application. It will replace your 
Winzip or whatever you have already. And is much more powerful. It 
can extract .zip as well as .rar files. But not only that, it can 
extract also .iso and .jar archives.

Download and install it rather than complain about it ;-)

Hmm interesting ;-)
I think there is incorrect data in the memory and app cant write it...
I have to solve...this problem.
Thanks anyway!

          <div class="email-content">This is a really nice looking timer, a lot of options. :)

I have a lot of problems though: I get an error when I try to accept
my time, it keeps saying it&#x27;s not a &quot;floating value&quot;. It says all my
best times are 22.00, and I can&#x27;t delete them. When I try to exit, it
says it can&#x27;t create options.xml, and I have to end the program a
different way. It didn&#x27;t save my options either. And is there a way to
see the scrambles for your solves?

I meant a &quot;scramble viewer&quot;, where you can see how the cube should look like after the scramble...

and you don&#x27;t have to replace the Best Mean button...just add a Best Average one : ) as average is more common (specially on cubes)

That&#x27;s a commutator.  It&#x27;s not the only alg, it&#x27;s an example of the
thousands of possible commutators on the 4x4x4.  Also, edges cannot be
flipped on the 4x4.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, pop a single edge out
and try to put it back flipped over.  Impossible.  In fact, you can&#x27;t
even solve a swapped pair.  Try to just pair up two matching edges,
but facing opposite directions.  You can&#x27;t.

<br>
Some of my coworkers play it and have gotten me started in trying to<br>
learn more about it and learn to play better (see sets quicker). <br>
There are only 1080 different possible sets, well within the range of<br>
just simply memorizing all of them.<br>
<br>
I have no idea if that would be useful, but it seems just simply<br>
studying all 1080 by rote, or having a system to categorize all of<br>
them would make the game much easier.<br>
<br>
Yes I realize that this is an ugly brute force solution, and that most<br>
Set players have elegant strategies and practice quite a bit to &quot;see&quot;<br>
sets without having to think, but I wonder if this is a viable way to<br>
train to play very competitively?<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a very fun game.  I stink at it, but I do enjoy playing it quite<br>
a bit.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I think you could maybe reduce the amount of work by considering the
harder cases. Sets which have 3 elements the same and one different
(like 1 solid red diamond, 2 solid red diamonds, 3 solid red diamonds)
are so easy to spot that even if you didn&#x27;t know the rules you might
intuitively know that was a set. The sets which have all 4 elements
different are much harder to spot, so it might be a good idea to
memorise those. I usually pick two cards that could be in a set and
mentally work out which other card could make a set. If it&#x27;s there,
great, if not, move on. With practise you can do this pretty fast (and
probaly faster than any of your co-workers, unless they are into this
stuff like we are ;) )

Good luck!
DanH :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

Dan Harris got me into Set a few months ago and it was an instant favourite, although Dan 
beat me every time ;). As with everything you get better with practice. 

When I don&#x27;t see a set immediately, I try to isolate one of the four features and work out 
by elimination if they have to be the same or have to be different. In a lot of situations you 
can do this very quickly because there&#x27;s at least one feature that has a very uneven 
distribution. 

For example: if you have only one green card and two reds, I try to work out if I can make 
a red-green-purple set. This can be done quickly since there are only two possible purple 
cards that match. If there&#x27;s no such set, I know it has to be an all purple set, which makes 
it a lot easier to continue.

Good luck,
Lars

fall within +/- one standard deviation of the mean, and 95% are within
+/- two.  It&#x27;s just a measure of spread.

          <div class="email-content">So I have been a very bad cube member there days. This is the first 
time I&#x27;ve checked this forum in about 12 weeks :(. As I was browsing 
though, this message caught my attention.

What makes it a tiny bit feasible is that I am now in Denver and 
would have a really good venue and logisitical support to offer (as 
well as food and drink).

What makes this a bad place to host one is that there aren&#x27;t enough 
cubers. I can think of: you, me, a couple of my co-workers, MikeG, 
Pat. But that is all. Not enough. (My definition of enough is 12.) 
Could hit up the local colleges I guess..., but too much work for me.

Although...., if there is the slightest inkling of interest from out-
of-staters to come participate, then I think I could make it happen, 
with some help of course. Denver is a nice central place to have 
one, and there hasn&#x27;t been one in this state yet. So it&#x27;s not a 
terrible idea.

I did some looking and found your 3x3x3 project as well. what would 
reealy be cool would be &quot;translucent&quot; stickers on a clear cube. I dont 
know how you would do white. perhaps a tinted grey or &quot;smoke&quot; color 
instead.

will you build for hire?

I saw this video on youtube, with the guy using a program that simulates the stackmat...it has the red and green lights, same number style and so...<br>
<br>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzzTeTOCI1U<br>
<br>
he says &quot;huskyomega&quot; did the software...in fact, he has 2 videos showing it<br>
http://youtube.com/watch?v=PthNZrSxoQ8<br>
http://youtube.com/watch?v=qaK_o4rL2Pg<br>
<br>
he said to someone who asked to search google for &#x27;OmegaStudioTournament Display&#x27;...I tried, but just found videos...<br>
<br>
so I was wondering if anybody here uses it and/or knows where I can download. I already got an USB mouse to make the pads, so I just need the software : )<br>
<br>
thanks in advance...<br>

          <div class="email-content">GUNK lubricant sucks. It takes forever to dry, smells very very 
toxic, and wears away relatively quickly. I recommend something like 
CRC (red can) instead. I personally haven&#x27;t used SNAP yet: been 
wanting to for awhile.

Tyson,

It&#x27;s also possible to identify the SNAP lubricant by taste, just
squirt a little on your tongue and it tastes of strawberries and
chocolate.

          <div class="email-content">Why do you think you can die from tasting lube? I wouldn&#x27;t drink an entire can, but unless you have a very strange allergy it seems relatively harmless to me. But don&#x27;t try this at home kids!

The problem I have is that Dan Harris had some lubricant with him at the Italian Open that he kept referring to as &quot;the shit&quot;. I always thought that was because of the good lubrication, but now I am just envisioning Dan actually tasting &quot;the shit&quot; :)

Dan, can you tell me which lubricant that was exactly and if that is still the best you know?

Why do you think you can die from tasting lube? I wouldn&#x27;t drink an entire can, but unless you have a very strange allergy it seems relatively harmless to me. But don&#x27;t try this at home kids!

The problem I have is that Dan Harris had some lubricant with him at the Italian Open that he kept referring to as &quot;the shit&quot;. I always thought that was because of the good lubrication, but now I am just envisioning Dan actually tasting &quot;the shit&quot; :)

Dan, can you tell me which lubricant that was exactly and if that is still the best you know?

so I was wondering if there&#x27;s anybody who knows it and could help me...how am I going to make pads that are separated, like on the stackmat? is it posible using this circuit? or do I need another? or are all mouses like that?

thanks again

          <div class="email-content">Aren&#x27;t there two pins which connects this black box with the rest of
the board? So you could solder two wires to these pins and it should
work fine, except this black box is there for more than just being
pressed ;). You also could try to open this box, to be sure.

          <div class="email-content">I think each black/white box is connected by 3 pins...you can&#x27;t see at the last pic, but there are 3 pins below...and here&#x27;s a picture from the bottom:
 
 http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s107/Pedrosino/mouse.jpg 

the buttons are at the top...you can see 3 pins for each button and 2 (vertically) for the little capacitor (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the word)...

I asked on an electronics forum, and they said I could take the buttons out and connect them by wires...so, to do that, I&#x27;d have to use a weld iron on the bottom and pull the buttons out, right? or no?

I have seen others try this, so I figure I will as well. <br>
<br>
I am in Spokane Washington until Friday evening on business.  After <br>
5pm, I have exactly nothing to do, so if there are any cubers in the <br>
area, it would be great to meet up and cube a bit.  Shoot me an email <br>

the buttons are at the top...you can see 3 pins for each button and 2 (vertically) for the little capacitor (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the word)...

I asked on an electronics forum, and they said I could take the buttons out and connect them by wires...so, to do that, I&#x27;d have to use a weld iron on the bottom and pull the buttons out, right? or no?

          <div class="email-content">Wow, this could be a pretty bum deal for us.

My trick is to spray a bunch of the silicone into the cap and use a
q-tip to apply to the cross inside, as well as the sides of the
cubies.  It prevents overspray, allows for quick application, and only
takes a few minutes to dry.  I found that spraying directly into the
cube wears out my stickers faster, takes forever to dry, and results
in a temporary &quot;locking&quot; condition where the cube like to freeze in
the middle of turns.

Anyway, I&#x27;m using this:

M2 U M E2 M (E2+U&#x27;) M2

Do the (E2+U&#x27;) as a double layer turn (u&#x27;) after half the E-move and 
it works as one turn.

It is rather tricky t odo the alg if you are not used to it but in 
time it get&#x27;s easy. It&#x27;s worth practising it until it can be done 
fast because there are not many shorter LL-algs out there.

          <div class="email-content">I agree.  Listening to music does affect my times.  I prefer listening to
music with no lyrics, or a real slow song.  I seem to get distracted when I
play a song that I know very well, because I want to sing it and it ruins my
concentration.

          <div class="email-content">Interestingly, while cubing is the only time I enjoy techno music.  I
find fast paced, up beat music with few or no lyrics works well for
me.  Some songs are also nearly impossible to solve cubes by though.

I&#x27;m curious how music affects others as well.

Same music I get at competitions so that I&#x27;m prepared for that.

What does that mean? I first thought it&#x27;s some English saying, but 
google found only two hits and one is titled &quot;Hot Shaved Pussy Pics&quot;:

I agre, lyrics distract me, but only on blindfold solves, since I 
like to say what I&#x27;m going to do aloud, so I don&#x27;t listen to any 
music while BLD. During a normal solve, I listen to whatever I have.

Also, the title of the webpage for the 2nd one is GUNK Silicone Lube,

          <div class="email-content">a z-perm is a permutation that switches all 4 edges (usually) on the 
last layer.  it can be used to switch other edges, but in regular 
cubing it usual is used in Permutation Last layer.  It switches 2 edges 
that are adjacent to each other (switched in pairs), but retains the 
orientation of the entire cube.  After that poor explanation, here is a 
picture of it (thanks to Chris Hardwick for his wonderful site and

          <div class="email-content">Depends on the metric. There are the quarter turn metric (QTM) counting 
only qouarter turns and there a U2 are two turns.

But in half turn metric (HTM) there it is only one turn.

There is also a slice turn metric (STM) and also a quarter for that 
(SQTM), both counting slice turns a one turn. Those are otherwise two 
turns M = R + L&#x27;

          <div class="email-content">Any double turn is counted as 2, so yes, I2 is two turns. M,S,E -slice
moves- are counted as two turns. Anti slice moves are counted as two
turns. (Ra, Ua, Fa). Anything else is counted as 1 turn. Hope that helps.

          <div class="email-content">Jeff,

Like Kenneth Gustavsson said, it does depend on the metric.

But in competitions, when 25-turn scrambles are used for the 3x3x3, U2 counts as one turn.  A half turn metric (HTM) a.k.a. face turn metric (FTM) is used.

For the fewest moves event, FTM is used as well, so U2 counts as one turn here as well.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve never put another washer on the outside like Pat describes.  
but like in all things cubing, there&#x27;s more than one way to do 
things.  

i&#x27;ve just put the spring on the screw, then a washer, then put them 
into the center piece, then screwed them into the core making sure 
to keep the screw straight (keeping it straight is very important).  

once the screws are all in, I usually keep the caps off first and 
play around with it to see how tight it is, then adjust the screws 
until it feels comfortable for you (and maybe go a little tighter at 
first), then put the center caps on and break it in.  I&#x27;ll also not 
lube it right at first because i want to wear it in a little, so i 
usually keep the screws tighter and do some solves or turns wear i&#x27;m 
trying to wear it in a little.  then take it apart, wipe the cube 
dust off, and lube and go.

good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Haha, that&#x27;s such a cool algorithm. Easy to remember, fun to do, got a
nice rhythm to it. Though you should probably add a U&#x27; at the end, so
it becomes (R2 U R2&#x27; U2&#x27; R2 U R2&#x27; U&#x27;)x2

Great, just from reading this thread I now know five ways to do the
same permutation. I&#x27;m going to end up confusing myself when I run into
it in competition :P

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

For the finger trick&#x27;s part, they really aren&#x27;t as difficult as they
seem. Believe it or not, they are just flicking the U layer. For just
U, you place your right index finger on URB and push to you. your
index finger should end up to next to the RUF, the previously URB.
Once you have that mirror it on the left hand. So left index on ULB,
flick. Now you practice UR&#x27;. As you turn the top face, turn your wrist
down. When you are doing this correctly, it should look like one fluid
motion. Master that, then mirror on left, so it would be U&#x27;L. Once you
have UR&#x27; and U&#x27;L, practice RUR&#x27; then L&#x27;U&#x27;L. When doing this trigger,
make sure the R and L&#x27; (First turns of both) are fully turned, as you
cannot cut corners when two faces are turned the same direction. After
that, should be able to pick up other triggers fairly quickly. I will
mention the U2 and U2&#x27; though. First, U2. So you do the first U
normally, flicking with the index finger. As you finish the the U, you
bring the middle finger behind the UBR piece and flick. This motion
may seem uncomfortable, so stretch your fingers first! After you can
do U2 fairly quickly. Try doing U2R&#x27; then RU2R&#x27;U2. Mirror for the left
hand too. I hope this helps!

oh and also, if someone really wants to learn how to cube, they will
take the time to learn the the few algortihms required to solve the cube.

Write the 4 algorithms down on a small piece of paper so that they can<br>
carry the solution around with them. They will gradually memorise it<br>
over time, but will be able to apply the solution almost immediately.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&quot;Fingertricks&quot; (it&#x27;s almost ridiculous to call them that) are interesting.<br>
I&#x27;m under the assumption that people who are involved in activities that<br>
require some level of technical hand work are inclined to use<br>
&quot;fingertricks&quot;, or to intuitively learn to develop them.<br>
<br>
Musicianship most often requires the development of refined technique in the<br>
fingers.  In learning music there is always the goal to make<br>
faster/cleaner/smoother transitions, work for speed, etc.<br>
<br>
Cubing is the same.  &quot;Fingertricks&quot; (&#x27;technique&#x27; is probably the more<br>
appropriate word; are they fooling anybody?  -maybe) I learned while<br>
learning the cube.  It was intuitive to try to develop finger technique,<br>
make smooth transitions between turns, trigger move combinations, etc.<br>
<br>
The &quot;practice, practice, practice&quot; statement applies here too.  Fluency will<br>
come with time.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I find that R&#x27;U2 R U2 R&#x27; F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; works quite well (avg
under 1.5 sec).  The key to this algorithm is the transition between
the (R&#x27; U2) and the (R U2).  It must be very smooth with no delay. 
The rest of the alg should be executed pretty much as one finger
trick.  For the last finger trick, as you are doing the second to last
U&#x27; with your left index finger, you should reposition your right hand
so the thumb rests on the UFR piece, so that the F&#x27; can be executed
with the thumb.  You should try practicing it more.  However, of
course, different people will prefer different algs, so you should
also give those other algs a try.

Good luck!

The difference is just the packaging.

If I recall correctly, A5 is the cheapest, just comes wrapped in 
plastic.

          <div class="email-content">&gt;Is there a way of solving the cube intuitively, without<br>
&gt; &gt; algorithms. I saw Ryan Heise&#x27;s method. But commutators may be a<br>
&gt;little<br>
&gt; &gt; difficult to teach. Any suggestions?<br>
<br>
Commutators are not difficult to teach if you approach it the right<br>
way.  I tutor math to kids of all ages at my job, and so far I&#x27;ve<br>
taught one 10 year old how to solve the cube, and I am in the process<br>
of teaching about 10 more kids how to solve it.<br>
<br>
I teach standard layer by layer, only at no point do I show them<br>
algorithms.  The first layer is pretty intuitive I&#x27;d argue (with<br>
practice) so I just show them intuitive techniques for that.  When<br>
solving the middle layer I show them the standard alg R&#x27; D2 R D2 F D<br>
F&#x27; only I show them how the first part breaks out the corner in such a<br>
way as to make it able to line up with the middle layer edge.  I call<br>
this the &quot;setup move&quot;.  Then after the &quot;setup move&quot; they just have to<br>
replace the corner using the regular way I show them so fix corners to<br>
solve both the corner and middle layer edge.  So in their minds this<br>
isn&#x27;t an alg at all, it&#x27;s a &quot;setup move&quot; followed by simply fixing the<br>
corner again.<br>
<br>
For the LL I teach<br>
1) orient LL edges<br>
2) orient LL corners<br>
3) permute LL corners<br>
4) permute LL edges<br>
<br>
Everything here except orienting the LL edges is done with<br>
commutators.  For orienting the LL edges I show them the typical F R U<br>
R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; algs only I describe to them what is happening at every<br>
single step, and why you make each move.  The kids do need some<br>
reptition and practice at this step, but eventually they learn to<br>
understand why the edges orient when you do those moves.<br>
<br>
For the last three steps I use commutators.<br>
<br>
If the student/child/person learning is right handed I have them use<br>
the alg R&#x27; D2 R F D2 F&#x27; U F D2 F&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R U&#x27; to orient the corners.  I<br>
teach this not as an alg but as using what I call the &quot;storage spot&quot;.<br>
<br>
The DBL location is the &quot;storage spot&quot;.  If the UFR corner is<br>
misoriented they first start by pulling it into the &quot;storage spot&quot; by<br>
doing either R&#x27; D2 R or F D2 F&#x27;.  Once it is in the storage spot they<br>
have &quot;stored&quot; it.  After that they must &quot;unstore&quot; it the other way. <br>
So if they stored with F D2 F&#x27; they unstore with R&#x27; D2 R.<br>
<br>
If they have a sune case I teach them how to orient one corner twice<br>
in the opposite direction as the way it actually twists.  Thus it is<br>
still done with commutators.<br>
<br>
For permuting the corners I tell them to just use the storage spot. <br>
Say they have the cycle UFR-&gt;UBR-&gt;UBL I teach them that the corner in<br>
UFR is &quot;wrong&quot; since the colors don&#x27;t match the center colors.  <br>
<br>
Then I have them do R&#x27; D2 R to &quot;store&quot; the corner to DFL.<br>
<br>
You get the idea.  The alg, if you even want to call it that, that I<br>
show them to use is R&#x27; D2 R U R&#x27; D2 R U R&#x27; D2 R U2 R&#x27; D2 R<br>
<br>
For orienting the edges I show them the same idea.  They use a<br>
&quot;storage&quot; spot only the storing move is now M D2 M&#x27; and the &quot;storage<br>
spot&quot; is the DF location.<br>
<br>
So if they have the edge 3 cycle UF-&gt;UR-&gt;UB I have them do M D2 M&#x27; U M<br>
D2 M&#x27; U M D2 M&#x27; U2 M D2 M&#x27; which simply repeatedly uses the storage spot.<br>
<br>
This is actually Joel van Noort&#x27;s solution, only I adapted it to use<br>
my own terminology for when I teach it.  I&#x27;ve had success teaching a<br>
10 year old this method and she can now solve the cube now matter how<br>
scrambled it is in about 4 minutes on average and she&#x27;s getting<br>
faster.  I have about 10 other students at various stages of the<br>
solution all around the ages of 8-13 who I am showing the same method.<br>
<br>
In my opinion I recommend to *never* show someone by just showing them<br>
the algs.  Show them using commutators because then they understand<br>
100% what they are doing to solve the cube, and most importantly they<br>
understand why everything they&#x27;re doing works.  If my students stop<br>
cubing for 6 months I want them to be able to pick it up again and<br>
still remember how to solve it.  That&#x27;s why I show them why their<br>
solution works, and not just algs to memorize.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

This pattern is called cube-in-cube-in-cube. The easiest way to do
this is to do the cube in cube first and then twist the 2 additional
corners. However if you just want a short algo for this search it
using a cube solver like ACube or Cube Exlorer. I believe the optinal
solution is like 18 or so. The one i mentioned is 32 turns using
&#x27;basic principles&#x27;. First moving 6 c/e blocks to make the cube in cube
then another 12 to twist last 2 corners. Don&#x27;t want to give the algs
now, besides im on holiday ;-

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, now i can make that pattern =) However, that algorithm does
not twist the two corners. For those that do not know how, turn L2 so
the two corners are on next to each other (1,4) and use A (z&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;UR x2
z). After, do U&#x27; and use A&#x27; (z&#x27; R&#x27;U&#x27;RU x2 z) U. Then reverse setup
moves, L2.

Hey Alexander,

I have to admit I had never thought to teach the same idea for edge 
orientation as for corner orientation!  I think that&#x27;s a great 
idea!  I&#x27;ll let the BL location be the &quot;storage spot&quot; and they will 
solve it using the same idea.

Thanks for the suggestion!  I had honestly never thought of that.  
Yes I did try to make all the steps parallel to all the others to 
help with learning it.  I like your idea for the edge orientation 
even better than the way I have already been showing it, plus it 
keeps all the steps parallel to each other and makes it easier to 
learn.

Joel, if your site mentions edge orientation this way I apologize 
that I missed it/forgot it.  I remembered your commutator approach, 
but I had not thought to orient the edges that way, and if your site 
has this method I must have missed it.

Thanks Alexander, I will be sure to implement that new edge 
orientation step in the future for anyone I am teaching.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Alexander,

I just took a look with my cube and I can see how something like R&#x27; 
E2 R U F E2 F&#x27; U&#x27; would work to flip an edge, but I&#x27;m a little 
hesitant to use that idea because of the U turns.

I had previously thought of using this alg, which I use for central 
edges in 5x5x5 BLD R&#x27; E&#x27; R2 E2 R&#x27; to flip an edge, but I had never 
given it a shot.  The part that has me hesitant is that the inverse 
is different from the original.  I try to make all my commutator 
parts be their own inverse for simplicity.

I may just stick to teaching F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; to orient edges, but 
I&#x27;ll ask Keeley, the girl I&#x27;ve already taught how to solve, to try 
the R&#x27; E&#x27; R2 E2 R&#x27; method to flip edges and see which she likes 
better.  Also I&#x27;ve noticed younger kids, in general, have a hard 
time doing slice turns because their hands are smaller.

Still I will have Keeley try the slice turn way to flip edges and 
see what she thinks and try to report back on which way she prefers.

          <div class="email-content">Here are my answers:

1. I&#x27;d say: Watch different movies from differnt cubers and let them 
inspire you. Don&#x27;t copy everything you see, just make sure you find a 
comfortable way to execute the sequences.

2. Well... In the end you want to be able to recognise the pairs from 
all angles and go from there. I guess your way, you&#x27;ll end up doing 
some useless U moves.

3. I always break down the algorithms in parts, and I try to explain 
where the pieces go, so the algs make sense in a way. For some steps, 
I first let them practice RUR&#x27;U&#x27; a 100 times, until they get it, and 
then I learn them how to solve the corner-orientation by using that 
move repeatedly. (RUR&#x27;U&#x27; RUR&#x27;U&#x27; D) * 3  D, for example.

Why does hardly any cuber use the Waterman Method? I only know of 
Josef Jelinek. It seems really fast, with a nice balance of 
intuition and memorization.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not surprised.  The FURU&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27; edge orientation method is so easy to both<br>
explain and learn.  It&#x27;d also probably be better to start teaching<br>
commutators with face turns instead of slice moves.  May I place a bet on<br>
Keely&#x27;s preference?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m imagining little kids trying to perform slice moves with stiff cubes -<br>
my mom has trouble slicing on her cube.<br>
<br>
Teaching edge orientation with commutators in this way could be explained as<br>
a side note after they understand the whole method, but clearly giving it as<br>
knowledge only and admitting the ease of the previous edge orientation<br>
method.<br>
<br>
I wish I&#x27;d seen your beginner method sooner Joel.  At some point the<br>
&quot;Beginner Method&quot; link on all sites gets ignored.<br>

          <div class="email-content">You could do it Dan Knight&#x27;s way.

Do R&#x27; and U2 like DanH just said. For the next R, place your thumb at the FDR corner. Execute the R and just as your thumb comes up to the U layer, perform a U&#x27; with your right thumb and do another U&#x27; with your left index finger. This finger trick performs the second U2 quite fast and sets you up for the rest of the algorithm.

PS To perform the first U2 turn in the algorithm, first perform a U with your right index finger. Immediately (however you spell that word) after you do the first U, do the second U with your middle finger. That way, your index and middle fingers follow each other. If you are left-handed just mirror it. Hope this helps

            This is probably the best algorithm for this case, in my opinion of

course. Try the beginning like R&#x27; (right hand) U2 (right index finger)

R  (right hand) U2&#x27; (right thumb)... and the rest follows naturally.

          <div class="email-content">There is something called look-ahead. Its pretty self explanatory. The basic idea, is to go slow, look ahead around the cube to find pieces, put those pieces together while at the same time looking for the next pieces (this is used in F2L). Also, DO NOT GO FAST! Unless you can recognize stuff super good.

The way I learned F2L was first I mastered the cross, and I practice F2L by going slowly and looking ahead for the pairs. Gradually, increase your speed.  A metronome would help too.

            Right now my times are about 30 seconds when I can recognize the F2L

situation I&#x27;m in, but there are only a few cases I can recognize

quickly.  (My OLL and PLL are pretty good.) Is there a way to look

around the cube quickly yet comprehensively?

No good, 1:29.xy. I just wanted to do a final solve before I went to 
sleep, so I was sitting relaxed on my bed with only little light.

That happens when you reply to the wrong message, ha!

Random. I always twist randomly for 40 seconds, that&#x27;s 100+ moves. If 
I had the scramble, what would you do with it? Try to reconstruct my 
solve until the last layer?

> Something I wonder: How long did it take you to recognise you got

About a second, I think, but I don&#x27;t really remember. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s 
about as easy to recognise as a 3x3 LL skip.

I wouldn&#x27;t. ;)

I use it as an excuse when I get to an edge-cycle for LL. I count it 
as a &quot;corner permutation&quot; skip, which isn&#x27;t as lucky as an OLL skip.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Brian,

As much as I use extended cross, and as much as I advocate it, I
really think dual solving is the more important of the two.  I of
course recommend using both in combination as the ideal approach, but
if nothing else I would recommend dual solving simply for the fact
that it increases your chances of every good case you can see when
starting your solve, and in most cases by nearly doubling the odds.

http://tinyurl.com/ytvufs

Honestly the reason I use dual solving is simply based on the math
you&#x27;ll find on the above page.  I think the math argument is
convincing enough just by itself, but of course I will also say that I
think it is easy to adjust to without very much practice.  Also it is
very nice to have easy crosses, not even X-crosses, nearly double the
time as with only one color solving.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Well, it&#x27;s a 3.7% chance assuming you always have correctly flipped LL 
edges. I thought we had defined a 5% luckiness rule-of-thumb. So it&#x27;s 
hard to say. But for me I never count that as being lucky. For me 
being able to pull off the PLL is good enough. I&#x27;m not very familiar 
with PLLs. At first it was always a suprise to see those cases, the 
pause it takes me, makes up for it being somewhat lucky.

But does this mean you know all the ZBLL algs? Because that would be 
incredible. I&#x27;ve been being much more consistant with ZBF2L, which I 
think is easier to focus on for me now that I don&#x27;t cube much.

I have still be averaging about 2:35 on 5x5, so I&#x27;m not entirely out 
of shape. I&#x27;m considering the CalTech competition next month? Who&#x27;s 
going to be there?

Subject: [Speed cubing group] TI-83/84 Scrambler

Hey guys,

I&#x27;m not sure if this was ever made, but here is a program file for a 
scrambler for the TI-83/84 calculator series. It&#x27;s not an 
&quot;application&quot; of any sort, and this proved helpful to me since I 
didn&#x27;t want to lug around a laptop just to properly scramble my cube; 
hand scrambles suck, frankly.

By the way, I think this is kind of messy, so if you have any 
suggestions for cleaning it up, just speak up. :)

[code starts here]

ClrHome 
8->A 
8->B 
8->C 
For(X,0,24,1) 
While C=B 
randInt(1,6) ->C 
A+B->D 
If C=A 
Then 
If D=7 
Then 
C->E 
While C=E 
randInt(1,6) ->E 
End 
E->C 
End 
End 
End 
B->A 
C->B 
iPart(X/5)+1- >Y 
15fPart(x/5) +1->Z 
If C=1 
Output(Y,Z,&quot; U&quot;) 
If C=2 
Output(Y,Z,&quot; F&quot;) 
If C=3 
Output(Y,Z,&quot; R&quot;) 
If C=4 
Output(Y,Z,&quot; L&quot;) 
If C=5 
Output(Y,Z,&quot; B&quot;) 
If C=6 
Output(Y,Z,&quot; D&quot;) 
randInt(1,3) ->W 
If W=1 
Output(Y,Z+1, &quot;&#x27;&quot;) 
If W=2 
Output(Y,Z+1, &quot;2&quot;) 
End

[code ends]

-> = STO> button found above the ON button.
The = sign can be found in 2nd->TEST
iPart(), fPart(), randInt() can be found in MATH
Everything else should be obvious or is located in PRGM.

I might make one for 2x2 or 4x4 soon, and I&#x27;ll update you guys if I 
do.

-Tim

          <div class="email-content">Way ahead of you on the opposite color solving :D. In other words: I thought of the idea of solving the opposite color for X-cross myself.
When I was practicing X-cross, I saw that my opposite side (yellow) had tons of good F2L pairs. Seeing that this would go to waste, I decided to utilize this by solving on the yellow and the white side as my X-cross. Seeing the math behind it, it makes sense. 

Thanks to everyone for helping in X-cross!

Brian

Subject: Re: [Speed cubing group] Extended Cross

Hey Brian,

As much as I use extended cross, and as much as I advocate it, I
really think dual solving is the more important of the two. I of
course recommend using both in combination as the ideal approach, but
if nothing else I would recommend dual solving simply for the fact
that it increases your chances of every good case you can see when
starting your solve, and in most cases by nearly doubling the odds.

http://tinyurl. com/ytvufs

Honestly the reason I use dual solving is simply based on the math
you&#x27;ll find on the above page. I think the math argument is
convincing enough just by itself, but of course I will also say that I
think it is easy to adjust to without very much practice. Also it is
very nice to have easy crosses, not even X-crosses, nearly double the
time as with only one color solving.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">By no means is that lucky. You would solve the last layer in one step as you always would.

If you know a two step last layer, it&#x27;s not lucky to get an OLL with 4 edges correctly oriented 
or a PLL with the corners correctly placed.

Kind regards,
Lars

me it was really easy and I was almost immediatly as fast as with my
regular cross color. I think the reason why is that I have never
really learnt the order of the F, R, B, L colors. :-P

My fastest competition time, 11.84, was made with opposite cross
color. I think that&#x27;s the reason why I had a much faster time for that
round at German Open than most others, because due to looking at the
yellow side I discover a double xcross in 10 moves. Yesa, it was hard
to see but I have practiced at it a lot and managed to get a very fast
F2L.

I also start very often with xcross or a 2x2x2-block which I expand to
an xcross.

I do not use Vista and have no idea what causes this problem. On 
closing Cube Explorer I do some cleanup, freeing dynamical created 
arrays etc. . If anyone finds internet resources for this problem (is 
CE really the only program where this happens?) let me know.

L2 x&#x27; M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2 U2 x L2 is how I would approach this. I 
don&#x27;t know Macky&#x27;s notation, but I&#x27;m guessing 1-4 is on top, 5-8 on 
bottom, and that 24 and 57 are diagonally opposite from each other. 
I&#x27;m sure you could use a setup move for this.

 This only happens with Cube Explorer. No other programs/tools I use<br>
have this problem. This is what happens:  <br>
<br>
 execute cube411.exe, wait untill the pruning tables have been<br>
loaded, then press the top-right X to close the program. A &quot;Do you<br>
really want to quit&quot; pop-up appears. If you choose &quot;no&quot; everything<br>
returns to normal. But.... if you choose &quot;yes&quot; then you get a modal<br>
dialog window with a critical icon and an &quot;OK&quot; button<br>
(http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualbasic.constants.vbcritical.aspx<br>
[1]) that displays the message &quot;Format &#x27;%p&#x27; ung��ltig oder nicht<br>
kompatibel mit Argument.  <br>
<br>
 It would be nice if you could fix this, but because I have a<br>
workaround (logoff or end process) I don&#x27;t really mind.<br>

          <div class="email-content">As we are discussing these problems... I use Vista also and I want to know if one thing just happens in Vista. I recently started using the JNetCube timer and after some solvings, the 3 seconds countdown buzzer stops working. Do any one have this problem??

This only happens with Cube Explorer. No other programs/tools I use
have this problem. This is what happens: 

execute cube411.exe, wait untill the pruning tables have been
loaded, then press the top-right X to close the program. A &quot;Do you
really want to quit&quot; pop-up appears. If you choose &quot;no&quot; everything
returns to normal. But.... if you choose &quot;yes&quot; then you get a modal
dialog window with a critical icon and an &quot;OK&quot; button
(http://msdn2. microsoft. com/en-us/ library/microsof t.visualbasic. constants. vbcritical. aspx
[1]) that displays the message &quot;Format &#x27;%p&#x27; ung��ltig oder nicht
kompatibel mit Argument. 

It would be nice if you could fix this, but because I have a
workaround (logoff or end process) I don&#x27;t really mind.

I do not use Vista and have no idea what causes this problem. On 
closing Cube Explorer I do some cleanup, freeing dynamical created 
arrays etc. . If anyone finds internet resources for this problem
(is 
CE really the only program where this happens?) let me know.

The Cube Explorer problem is indeed a Delphi (6) problem according to <br>
http://entwickler-forum.de/showthread.php?t=20219. I don&#x27;t know if <br>
there is a fix. Maybe a search for this problem translated to english <br>
would give more results.<br>
<br>
For everyone that is having Vista problems, there are 2 pre-SP1 patches <br>
that are now available. They didn&#x27;t fix this problem, but they have <br>
improved the rough edges of Vista. These fixes will be included in <br>
Vista SP1 and will probably become available through Automatic Updates. <br>
They are final and you can get them from the Microsoft site. Read more <br>

Sometimes that happens to me, too, and when it does, I usually either reboot the timer or just watch the countdown visually.

  As we are discussing these problems... I use Vista also and I want to know if one thing just happens in Vista. I recently started using the JNetCube timer and after some solvings, the 3 seconds countdown buzzer stops working. Do any one have this problem??

  This only happens with Cube Explorer. No other programs/tools I use
  have this problem. This is what happens: 

  execute cube411.exe, wait untill the pruning tables have been
  loaded, then press the top-right X to close the program. A &quot;Do you
  really want to quit&quot; pop-up appears. If you choose &quot;no&quot; everything
  returns to normal. But.... if you choose &quot;yes&quot; then you get a modal
  dialog window with a critical icon and an &quot;OK&quot; button
  (http://msdn2. microsoft. com/en-us/ library/microsof t.visualbasic. constants. vbcritical. aspx
  [1]) that displays the message &quot;Format &#x27;%p&#x27; ung��ltig oder nicht
  kompatibel mit Argument. 

  It would be nice if you could fix this, but because I have a
  workaround (logoff or end process) I don&#x27;t really mind.

  I do not use Vista and have no idea what causes this problem. On 
  closing Cube Explorer I do some cleanup, freeing dynamical created 
  arrays etc. . If anyone finds internet resources for this problem
  (is 
  CE really the only program where this happens?) let me know.

As we are discussing these problems... I use Vista also and I want to know if one thing just happens in Vista. I recently started using the JNetCube timer and after some solvings, the 3 seconds countdown buzzer stops working. Do any one have this problem??

This only happens with Cube Explorer. No other programs/tools I use
have this problem. This is what happens: 

execute cube411.exe, wait untill the pruning tables have been
loaded, then press the top-right X to close the program. A &quot;Do you
really want to quit&quot; pop-up appears. If you choose &quot;no&quot; everything
returns to normal. But.... if you choose &quot;yes&quot; then you get a modal
dialog window with a critical icon and an &quot;OK&quot; button
(http://msdn2. microsoft. com/en-us/ library/microsof t.visualbasic. constants. vbcritical. aspx
[1]) that displays the message &quot;Format &#x27;%p&#x27; ung&amp;uuml;ltig oder nicht
kompatibel mit Argument. 

It would be nice if you could fix this, but because I have a
workaround (logoff or end process) I don&#x27;t really mind.

I do not use Vista and have no idea what causes this problem. On 
closing Cube Explorer I do some cleanup, freeing dynamical created 
arrays etc. . If anyone finds internet resources for this problem
(is 
CE really the only program where this happens?) let me know.

  I do not use Vista and have no idea what causes this problem. On 
  closing Cube Explorer I do some cleanup, freeing dynamical created 
  arrays etc. . If anyone finds internet resources for this problem
  (is 
  CE really the only program where this happens?) let me know.

In fact, I&#x27;m not sure it even exists, since even though many websites
mention it, its details are nowhere to be found.

Can anyone find any actual substantial information on this method?

          <div class="email-content">Hey that are some great new features of which I&#x27;m sure quite some
people were looking forward too. I notice that the more moves you turn
off the quicker it gets which is great. Also I notice that when you
put the initial cube rotation on it takes a bit longer to come up with
algorithms. A feature which I&#x27;d really really would love if it was
able to put each single possible move on or of, so only allow R2 moves
to simulate a domino. Also maybe the posibility of slice moves would
be very great.
I thank you for this nice program!

So how do I run the program? I asked before but got no answers. :x
I went to program and pressed CUBE, and it just says prgmCUBE. What do
I do?

As far as I know there are no Swedish cuber bearing your name, probabky 
the real name fell out and yours was duplicated.

 Hey that are some great new features of which I&#x27;m sure quite some<br>
 people were looking forward too. I notice that the more moves you<br>
turn<br>
 off the quicker it gets which is great. Also I notice that when you<br>
 put the initial cube rotation on it takes a bit longer to come up<br>
with<br>
 algorithms. A feature which I&#x27;d really really would love if it was<br>
 able to put each single possible move on or of, so only allow R2<br>
moves<br>
 to simulate a domino. Also maybe the posibility of slice moves would<br>
 be very great.<br>
 I thank you for this nice program!<br>

can just issue a &quot;kill&quot; command to terminate the program.  And I&#x27;m not<br>
even sure it&#x27;s cube explorer causing the error, it could just as<br>
easily be wine.  I thought I&#x27;d mention it on the off chance it&#x27;s<br>
related to the Vista bug though!<br>

Yes! And i guess many people do. All you have to do is to start a 
server (i usually take the server port 8080), then you give your IP and 
the port to your friend in order that he connects. Then you 
automatically goes to a &quot;room&quot; where the competition happens.

Lately I&#x27;ve been hearing about Z-permutation and R-permutation and such.

I figured out what Z-permutation is, as shown on Lars Petrus site, but
he only shows one way to resolve it, which I don&#x27;t like since it has
middle slices. Could anybody give me a site that has all of the last
layer permutations, as well as all of the possible algorithms to
resolve them? Thanks

          <div class="email-content">Hi Lars, Dan, all Set players here,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve looked a little into the math of the game Set recently and have<br>
found a strategy I think I like, at least for a beginner like me.<br>
<br>
My biggest problem so far has been not knowing which types of sets to<br>
look for.  There are 1080 different possible sets, with sets of each<br>
type listed below:<br>
<br>
# of sets with all 4 characteristics different: 216<br>
# of sets with 3 characteristics different: 432<br>
# of sets with 2 characteristics different: 324<br>
# of sets with 1 characteristic different: 108<br>
<br>
So 1/10 of the different possible sets have 3 of the characterstics<br>
(color, shading, shape, number) the same, while 2/5 of the different<br>
possible sets have 3 characteristics different and only 1 the same.<br>
<br>
I think my beginner strategy will be to try to look first for sets<br>
with only 1 characteristic the same, and 40% of all the possible sets<br>
are of this type.  If I fail to spot one I&#x27;ll look for sets with 2<br>
characteristics the same, and 30% of the different sets are of this type.<br>
<br>
So in a sense I am covering 70% of the different possible sets looking<br>
for sets of only 2 types.  I don&#x27;t know if this will be a good<br>
strategy, and if for example I see a board with a lot of reds I may<br>
try to see if I can find sets with only 1 characteristic different<br>
even though only 1/10 of the sets are of this type in general.  Still<br>
this seems like an efficient strategy as far as a beginner&#x27;s strategy<br>
goes.<br>
<br>
Does that sound reasonable?  What do you other set players think?  I&#x27;m<br>
interested in getting better, but I want to add some structure to how<br>
I think about finding sets rather than just staring at the table and<br>
hoping one pops out at me.  I&#x27;ve used the second strategy up until<br>
this point and it doesn&#x27;t work very well for me ;-)<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi Chris,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Dan Harris got me into Set a few months ago and it was an instant<br>
favourite, although Dan <br>
&gt; beat me every time ;). As with everything you get better with practice. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; When I don&#x27;t see a set immediately, I try to isolate one of the four<br>
features and work out <br>
&gt; by elimination if they have to be the same or have to be different.<br>
In a lot of situations you <br>
&gt; can do this very quickly because there&#x27;s at least one feature that<br>
has a very uneven <br>
&gt; distribution. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For example: if you have only one green card and two reds, I try to<br>
work out if I can make <br>
&gt; a red-green-purple set. This can be done quickly since there are<br>
only two possible purple <br>
&gt; cards that match. If there&#x27;s no such set, I know it has to be an all<br>
purple set, which makes <br>
&gt; it a lot easier to continue.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Good luck,<br>
&gt; Lars<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Extended cross is hard... I still have the habit of too much regripping in cross ehehe. Anyway, know your color scheme, and force yourself not to regrip. Try to find ways to solve the cross without regripping. 

This is how I think of the cross:
For example, if I see a red edge on F, I know then that the cross piece on R would be green. Across it, the edge piece would be orange and to the left, it would be blue. We know this because we have the color scheme memorized. Also, each edge piece does not need to be in its exact spot. As long as you place the edge pieces correctly, simple perform a D turn to get the colors matched. In other words; put the edge pieces in the correct color scheme, so that you can do D to put them correctly.

          <div class="email-content">Sorry for the late reply...I was on vacation for the last week.

I actually ended up going down to this and won it with a time of
1:10.19.  It was a lot of fun...a really nice group of people and
quite a few young cubers who had just learned to solve in April.

Because I knew the page would be archived soon, I pulled down a copy
and saved it so I could show my friends:
http://www.aplarsen.net/cube/canton%20story.htm

As it says in the story, the organizer of the contest called Tyson
just before we started solving.  He was really nice over the phone and
wished us all luck.  It made quite an impression on all the people
there.  So, nice PR, Tyson. =)

Around 90 non-europeans have registered at the moment.
So most competitors are by far from Europe, but still a nice group of 
non-europeans.
Largest group per country is Hungary with now 52 competitors. Then come USA 
and Poland.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Timothy,

Only multiple blindfolded and fewest moves have large waiting lists.
With the extra qualification rounds on Friday for some other events, there 
is no reason to not come because of waiting lists.

Have fun,

Ron

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Canton Illinois competition?

Sorry for the late reply...I was on vacation for the last week.

I actually ended up going down to this and won it with a time of
1:10.19. It was a lot of fun...a really nice group of people and
quite a few young cubers who had just learned to solve in April.

Because I knew the page would be archived soon, I pulled down a copy
and saved it so I could show my friends:
http://www.aplarsen .net/cube/ canton%20story. htm

As it says in the story, the organizer of the contest called Tyson
just before we started solving. He was really nice over the phone and
wished us all luck. It made quite an impression on all the people
there. So, nice PR, Tyson. =)

 It would be great if the World Championship would indeed be filled<br>
with competitors from all over the world.  <br>
<br>
 1 week after the World Championship there will be another<br>
tournament: the Dutch Open 2007<br>
(http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=DutchOpen2007<br>
[1]). It might be a nice idea to plan a trip across Europe in between<br>
those tournaments and participate in both!  <br>
<br>
 Maybe we could even setup a &quot;hosteling system&quot; where cubers from<br>
certain countries would offer others a place to stay during their<br>
traveling. I personaly live in Rotterdam and can spare a room for a<br>
couple of days/persons. If anyone is interested, just let me know.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody, <br>
 <br>
I am new Rubik cube fan from Turkey and I want to introduce myself. I am 30 years old and male. I meet Rubik cube when I was child but I learned to solve it a few months ago. Now I can solve it only layer by layer method and it takes at least five minutes. But already I am working on it. Today I find two web sites; Jessica Friedrich and Lars Petrus pages. I tried to understand petrus&#x27;s method but I could reach until 4Th step. After this step it is really difficult to understand for me. but I don&#x27;t give it up.<br>
I will work on it.<br>
I hope I will learn more special methods with this group.<br>
 <br>
kind regards,<br>
 <br>
Süleyman<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Süleyman!

I´m brazilian and learned to solve the cube at the age of 29, almost like you. I´m 31 now and still improving my times!!

I started learning the Friedrich method from the www.speedcubing.com after a friend taught me the layer by layer method. Don´t worry, you don´t need to learn all the algorithmics at once. You can improve your layer by layer method with some algorithmics from the Friedrich method. I did like this, some situations were too bad in the layer by layer method, like when an edge from the second layer is in the right place but in a wrong way (you have to orient it), so I looked for this case algorithmic in the Friedrich method. And then I kept learning some new algorithmics for some special cases until I learned all of them.

I suppose that you don´t have much time to play with the cube like all those 15 year old people (I wish I had), so you won´t improve fast, but keep in mind that your times will decrease fast in the beggining as you start learning some more algorithmics, and then when you reach 2 minutes it will be harder to get fast, but you will! Then you must learn some other things like better algorithmics, fingertricks and antecipating the next move.

Good luck! And keep practising.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Fw: hello

Hello everybody, 

I am new Rubik cube fan from Turkey and I want to introduce myself. I am 30 years old and male. I meet Rubik cube when I was child but I learned to solve it a few months ago. Now I can solve it only layer by layer method and it takes at least five minutes. But already I am working on it. Today I find two web sites; Jessica Friedrich and Lars Petrus pages. I tried to understand petrus&#x27;s method but I could reach until 4Th step. After this step it is really difficult to understand for me. but I don&#x27;t give it up.
I will work on it.
I hope I will learn more special methods with this group.

kind regards,

Süleyman

          <div class="email-content">Hi, I&#x27;m Rick. I started learning to cube about 5
months ago at the age of 51. I also found (and still
find) many web sites quite confusing. I recently found
one that I think seems a bit more understandable to
me. It is:

       http://www.freespaces.com/jasa86/cube.htm

Intro F2L was particular helpful to me. I think it is
basically thye Friedrich method but I like his
explanations better. The guy&#x27;s name is Jason Thorn, if
I recall correctly. I hope it is helpful to you as
well. I guess I average about 75 seconds. I average
about 60 seconds using another method but it has
nowhere near the potential for speed that Friedrich
has. My current difficulty is recognizing/locating
corner/edge pairs. I need to learn to look ahead and
hope that will still come with time. Anyway, I think
that site is worth taking a look at. Sometimes when I
try to access this site it is down, but it always is
comes back up pretty soon.

                             Good luck suleyman!

Hi Süleyman!

I´m brazilian and learned to solve the cube at the age of 29, almost like you. I´m 31 now and still improving my times!!

I started learning the Friedrich method from the www.speedcubing. com after a friend taught me the layer by layer method. Don´t worry, you don´t need to learn all the algorithmics at once. You can improve your layer by layer method with some algorithmics from the Friedrich method. I did like this, some situations were too bad in the layer by layer method, like when an edge from the second layer is in the right place but in a wrong way (you have to orient it), so I looked for this case algorithmic in the Friedrich method. And then I kept learning some new algorithmics for some special cases until I learned all of them.

Hello Kev,

For the network feature to work, you need two people. One person will
be the server and the other will be the client.

Have the server start JNetCube in server mode and pick a port. Any
port will work, but you can use port 1234 for this demonstration.
After the server has started, then the client will start his timer in
client mode and enter in the information for the server. The client
will type in the IP address of the server (which the server can find
by visiting whatismyip.com ) and port 1234 (or whatever port you
started the server on).

Then, the client connects to the server and you two will be connected.

If that isn&#x27;t working for you, then odds are the server is behind a
router and you must connect to the router and configure &quot;port
forwarding&quot; and must forward port 1234 (or whatever port you want) to
the server computer&#x27;s local ip address. For more information on port
forwarding with you particular router, see your router manual and it
will be in there.

Anymore questions, let me know.

Thanks,
-Chris

 months ago at the age of 51. I also found (and still
 find) many web sites quite confusing. I recently found
 one that I think seems a bit more understandable to
 me. It is:
 
 http://www.freespaces.com/jasa86/cube.htm
 
 Intro F2L was particular helpful to me. I think it is
 basically thye Friedrich method but I like his
 explanations better. The guy&#x27;s name is Jason Thorn, if
 I recall correctly. I hope it is helpful to you as
 well. I guess I average about 75 seconds. I average
 about 60 seconds using another method but it has
 nowhere near the potential for speed that Friedrich
 has. My current difficulty is recognizing/locating
 corner/edge pairs. I need to learn to look ahead and
 hope that will still come with time. Anyway, I think
 that site is worth taking a look at. Sometimes when I
 try to access this site it is down, but it always is
 comes back up pretty soon.
 
 Good luck suleyman!

put it down as the system he used because it was still new at the time
and he was experimenting with it a lot.

          <div class="email-content">You see Suleyan... that´s what I said about having 15 years old (or 16 in this case!).

Under 30s in 3 months! He must do this all through the night!! I´m doing this for almost 2 years and I still have to learn 4 more algorithmics to know the Friedrich completely. What else, I rarely beat the 30s barrier (my record is 27.7). People call me crazy because I go to work walking and solving the cube (blindfolded because I have to pay attention to the traffic), but this is when I can practise.

Maybe we should have age categories in the tournments :)

me. It is:

Intro F2L was particular helpful to me. I think it is
basically thye Friedrich method but I like his
explanations better. The guy&#x27;s name is Jason Thorn, if
I recall correctly. I hope it is helpful to you as
well. I guess I average about 75 seconds. I average
about 60 seconds using another method but it has
nowhere near the potential for speed that Friedrich
has. My current difficulty is recognizing/ locating
corner/edge pairs. I need to learn to look ahead and
hope that will still come with time. Anyway, I think
that site is worth taking a look at. Sometimes when I
try to access this site it is down, but it always is
comes back up pretty soon.

Good luck suleyman!

I&#x27;m also new. I&#x27;m Raku (13) from CA.
I started in January and my record is 16.59. I use Fridrich and still
have a lot to learn for OLL (about 40). I&#x27;m trying to learn blindfold,
but I always get stuck on Edge Permutation.

            I dunno what makes me laugh more.  The fact that I could&#x27;ve beaten

tyson in this competition, or that second place is LBL.

But yes, when done with the LL on top, that scramble gives a 3-move
xcross.  Not too rigged.

          <div class="email-content">I think most people used to scramble their cubes with the Last Layer on top.

But since the WCA defined an official way to scramble cubes in a
competition, I believe more and more people scramble their cubes this way
rather than another.

So that&#x27;s why some people find a scramble easy whereas someone else won&#x27;t !
(Not to mention if different methods are involved ;-))

I didn&#x27;t notice anything funny about that, but it brings up a 

question that I&#x27;ve been wanting to ask for ages.

How are people supposed to hold a cube for a scrmable? LL color on 

bottom? I&#x27;ve never seen it stated explicitly anywhere, but this is 

what I&#x27;ve always assumed. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. If there&#x27;s no 

convention there really should be.

In which case, I coulnd&#x27;t find anything terribly easy with that 

scramble. I guess slightly good for starting a Petrus block...

I don&#x27;t have Cube Explorer here, but I&#x27;ll wager that there is a 17

  I am J.Bernett orlando from Tamil Nadu(India) coming with my dad. My dad might compete only in 333 multi bld(nowadays he has no time to practice). I am competing in many. I have not yet met any American cuber. I am eager to meet and learn from the greats Mr.Frank Morris, Mr.Chris Hardwick et al.

  Just can&#x27;t wait.

If you look at the colors of the rainbow/spectrum green is in between red-orange-yellow-green-blue. This matches my perception that blue is darker than green. Is the 

WCA telling me I am colorblind?

The official rules are the inverse of the rule you gave. White (or lightest) on top, green (or darkest adjacent) on front.

  WCA rules say lightest color (white) on top, darkest adjacent color
  (green) on front. 

  But yes, when done with the LL on top, that scramble gives a 3-move
  xcross. Not too rigged.

I don&#x27;t remember with whom I talked about this last Sunday but I said that
only 8 competitors were allowed to go in the 3x3 OH final at the World
Championship.
In fact the number is 16, which is much much more comfortable. ^^

          <div class="email-content">thanks for posting this.  definitely come a long way in a few 
years.  It&#x27;s interesting to see how our current times compare to 
those from just a few years ago.  Personally, my times won&#x27;t be good 
enough to win any competitions, but maybe they will be fast enough 
to have placed well relative to these here or relative to the times 
from the first WC in Hungary.

          <div class="email-content">I recently attended my 20 year high school reunion.  The organizers <br>
learned that I could cube and wanted to incorporate it somehow since <br>
the cube craze was something we all remember and is so &quot;80s&quot;.  During <br>
dinner they gave out little awards for things like who had run in the <br>
most marathons, who had been in school the longest, who traveled the <br>
farthest to get there, etc., the last of which was who has the most <br>
unusual hobby.  It was a classic cubing in public momentthey passed <br>
my cube around so a few people got to scramble it, someone had a <br>
timer, and I did it in about 27 seconds--which is pretty good for me, <br>
especially considering I don&#x27;t cube too well in public and there were <br>
some of my old buddies heckling me with stuff like &quot;that one&#x27;s orange, <br>
no green, no blue!&quot;.  No one there had seen anything like that before, <br>
so I have to admit they were pretty blown away and applauded rather <br>
enthusiastically when going down the row to vote for who had the most <br>
unusual hobby, so I won a one pound chocolate bar, which represents <br>
the most significant item I&#x27;ve won with this unusual hobby ;-)  <br>
Personally, I thought the lady who made chain mail (the armor, not the <br>
spam) had the most unusual hobby, but I&#x27;ll take it anyway.<br>

Yes, there is a 17-move solution.

Is there one? Seeing so many channels on youtube devoted to cubing, i
say someone should start one, assuming there isn&#x27;t one already. It
would be neat, as it is a video hosting site, we could have weekly
video contests and tutorials for the beginners. Tell me what you guys
think about it.

          <div class="email-content">Yes Mr.Arnaud, I have improved but my dad, I do not think, has improved. Japan Open 2007 results might be the indication for you about my present performance.
  I wish to be part of Dutch Open 2007 also. But you know, it will be very very costly. I think many cubers might compete this year in Dutch Open 2007. 
  I hope many of your cousins, relatives and trainees would have improved a lot too. Very eager to meet you all again.

I am J.Bernett orlando from Tamil Nadu(India) coming with my dad. My dad might compete only in 333 multi bld(nowadays he has no time to practice). I am competing in many. I have not yet met any American cuber. I am eager to meet and learn from the greats Mr.Frank Morris, Mr.Chris Hardwick et al.

Just can&#x27;t wait.

It&#x27;s good to have strong belief in your abilities, and with his good
results he must have been quite confident.

But as we knows records are easier to set in practice than in
competition :)

<br>
I read through Bob&#x27;s nice competition how-to at cubewhiz.com, and am<br>
interested in hosting a competition. I figure it&#x27;ll either be sometime<br>
during January/February, but I&#x27;d like to know how many people are<br>
interested before I actively undertake this. The only reason why I<br>
think I&#x27;ll get it going in January/February is because I&#x27;ll probably<br>
need the time until then finding an appropriate venue and ensuring<br>
that a WCA delegate can come. ;)<br>
<br>
I live about an hour north of Philadelphia and about 15 minutes west<br>
of Phillipsburg, NJ, and the venue will most likely be around here<br>
(possibly in Philly if I absolutely cannot get one here in the Lehigh<br>
Valley).<br>
<br>
Let me know if you&#x27;re interested! I only have a handful of locals who<br>
would probably attend. XP<br>

Still fantastic, but interesting to know. Do we know what OLL it was

below.. :D

As far as being serious, i dont think anyone can figure out the exact 
lowest, as there is no exact speed (turns/sec) that is the fastest 
possible accomplishable speed.  we know that every solution can be 
solved in 26-27 moves max, and assuming someone will eventually get 9 
turns/sec, i would say 3 seconds is a fairly good guess.  NOTE that 
this is assuming that they already know the optimal solution for that 
specific scramble.  And with a lucky solve (under 27 moves), who 
knows how low someone can go...

hoping that made sense, but it was based on assumptions

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I now have an updated version of my 4x4x4 solver program.<br>
<br>
This program uses IDA*-type searches using pruning tables it generates<br>
itself, so it is relatively quick to download. This program also<br>
supports single-slice turns, twist turns, and block turns. It tends to<br>
be rather slow when solving in terms of twist turns, so I don&#x27;t<br>
particularly recommend using twist turns. It appears to use about<br>
400MB of RAM, so it probably should not be used on a system with less<br>
than 512MB, and I am not sure how it performs on a 512MB system. It<br>
also uses roughly 49MB of disk space for each metric that is used.<br>
<br>
The program solves the 4x4x4 cube using 5 stages, similar to the way<br>
the Thistlethwaite algorithm uses four stages to solve the 3x3x3 cube.<br>
The five stages are the same as in my previous program that used large<br>
&quot;perfect&quot; pruning tables in disk files, except in this new version,<br>
stage 2 utilizes additional turns that my previous program did not<br>
use. So worst case single-slice turn metric solve for the new program<br>
is 77 turns.<br>
<br>
The program can be downloaded in the form of a .ZIP file. That file<br>
expands to a .rtf documentation file and the executable file (.exe).<br>
Since the program file is an executable, I recommend scanning it with<br>
anti-virus software before running it (but of course I believe I have<br>
uploaded a virus-free file). The link for the file is:<br>

could this be related to the extremely high resolution &quot;wide&quot; screen

or did i goof up on install?

or perhaps the problem still exists?

          <div class="email-content">Yes Rafeal, you are right. Age is very important factor. But it is not enough. For instance, I haven&#x27;t found good quality cube. I don&#x27;t believe when I see one hand solver on video. Because, I cant turn with two hand my cube sometimes. I used soap for slippery between cube parts. now it turns more freely but not so much good. Also colors are important. my cubes are not standard. surface color is different. So it is really difficult to apply some tutorials.
but as I said before; you are right. most important factors are age and time. it is really difficult to find time for practice.

You see Suleyan... that´s what I said about having 15 years old (or 16 in this case!).

Under 30s in 3 months! He must do this all through the night!! I´m doing this for almost 2 years and I still have to learn 4 more algorithmics to know the Friedrich completely. What else, I rarely beat the 30s barrier (my record is 27.7). People call me crazy because I go to work walking and solving the cube (blindfolded because I have to pay attention to the traffic), but this is when I can practise.

Maybe we should have age categories in the tournments :)

me. It is:

http://www.freespac es.com/jasa86/ cube.htm

Intro F2L was particular helpful to me. I think it is
basically thye Friedrich method but I like his
explanations better. The guy&#x27;s name is Jason Thorn, if
I recall correctly. I hope it is helpful to you as
well. I guess I average about 75 seconds. I average
about 60 seconds using another method but it has
nowhere near the potential for speed that Friedrich
has. My current difficulty is recognizing/ locating
corner/edge pairs. I need to learn to look ahead and
hope that will still come with time. Anyway, I think
that site is worth taking a look at. Sometimes when I
try to access this site it is down, but it always is
comes back up pretty soon.

Good luck suleyman!

about 24 or 25 seconds. i&#x27;m proud to<br>

 about 60 seconds using another method but it has<br>
 nowhere near the potential for speed that Friedrich<br>
 has. My current difficulty is recognizing/ locating<br>

corner/edge pairs. I need to learn to look ahead and<br>

 that site is worth taking a look at. Sometimes when I<br>

 &gt; Rubik cube when I was child but I learned to solve<br>
 &gt; it a few months ago. Now I can solve it only layer<br>

 &gt; But already I am working on it. Today I find two web<br>

 &gt; tried to understand petrus&#x27;s method but I could<br>

 &gt; I will work on it.<br>
 &gt; I hope I will learn more special methods with this<br>

about 60 seconds using another method but it has<br>
nowhere near the potential for speed that Friedrich<br>
has. My current difficulty is recognizing/ locating<br>
<br>
corner/edge pairs. I need to learn to look ahead and<br>
hope that will still come with time. Anyway, I think<br>
that site is worth taking a look at. Sometimes when I<br>

&gt; Hello everybody, <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I am new Rubik cube fan from Turkey and I want to<br>
&gt; introduce myself. I am 30 years old and male. I meet<br>
&gt; Rubik cube when I was child but I learned to solve<br>
&gt; it a few months ago. Now I can solve it only layer<br>
&gt; by layer method and it takes at least five minutes.<br>
&gt; But already I am working on it. Today I find two web<br>
&gt; sites; Jessica Friedrich and Lars Petrus pages. I<br>
&gt; tried to understand petrus&#x27;s method but I could<br>
&gt; reach until 4Th step. After this step it is really<br>
&gt; difficult to understand for me. but I don&#x27;t give it<br>
&gt; up.<br>
&gt; I will work on it.<br>
&gt; I hope I will learn more special methods with this<br>
&gt; group.<br>
&gt; <br>

          <div class="email-content">When I said age is important, it´s was thinking about the free time available for those who are older. Of course, if I had plenty of time to cube, like Matyas probably has, I would be able to be more competitive, but probably wouldn´t beat Matyas because this CHILD is insane!! 54s for the blindsolving is incredible! It takes me more than that just to memorize the cube...

I agree about time being an important factor, but why would age be? It
seems that lower twenties seems to be a good age if you look at the
top 25 top cubers, but MÃ¡ty&amp; aacute;s and Ron prove that age is
not really that important.

Yes Rafeal, you are right. Age is very important factor. But it is
not enough. For instance, I haven&#x27;t found good quality cube. I don&#x27;t
believe when I see one hand solver on video. Because, I cant turn
with two hand my cube sometimes. I used soap for slippery between
cube parts. now it turns more freely but not so much good. Also
colors are important. my cubes are not standard. surface color is
different. So it is really difficult to apply some tutorials.
but as I said before; you are right. most important factors are age
and time. it is really difficult to find time for practice.

You see Suleyan... thatÂ´s what I said about having 15 years
old (or 16 in this case!).
Under 30s in 3 months! He must do this all through the night!!
IÂ´m doing this for almost 2 years and I still have to learn 4
more algorithmics to know the Friedrich completely. What else, I
rarely beat the 30s barrier (my record is 27.7). People call me crazy
because I go to work walking and solving the cube (blindfolded because
I have to pay attention to the traffic), but this is when I can
practise.
Maybe we should have age categories in the tournments :)

for about 3 months. I average
about 24 or 25 seconds. i&#x27;m proud to

cube. i solve it in about 4 mins. haha. im still working on my 3x3x3

one that I think seems a bit more understandable to
me. It is:
http://www.freespac [3] es.com/jasa86/ cube.htm
Intro F2L was particular helpful to me. I think it is
basically thye Friedrich method but I like his
explanations better. The guy&#x27;s name is Jason Thorn, if
I recall correctly. I hope it is helpful to you as

about 60 seconds using another method but it has

          <div class="email-content">Well, the bounds have been reduced to 26 moves. So if we can figure<br>
out how to calculate this 26 move solve in our head, and can turn at a<br>
constant 3 turns per second, theoretically you could average 8.6. If<br>
you could keep a constant 4tps you could average 6.5<br>
<br>
Also, alot were proved to be less than 26, so the average would<br>
probably closer to 5s!<br>

Is it practical to assume limits based on this magical

26 number?



How do you propose we average 26 turns *in a method*?



No clue?



30 turns?



Still nothing?



35 turns?



It&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;ll wait.



On a side note:



These FAQs, topics, etc.  Is it that no one checks the

archives before asking questions?  Or the archives are

impossible to sort through?

I tried to use your program, but it wouldn&#x27;t work. I always got the 
message it wasn&#x27;t initialised correctly, and it wont start. I tried 
start it both from command prompt and from windows explorer. What am 
i doing wrongly???

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Fastest possible times

Hi I&#x27;m new to the group and just sort of a casual cuber (best 3x3x3 
around a minute and a half) but I was wondering if anyone has studied 
or knows if there is an absolute lower limit to how fast it is actually 
possible to solve any given scramble?  It seems that with all the 
math/group theory/etc on all the various scrambles and algorithms that 
are known that there should be some mathematical and physical limit 
beyond which it would be impossible to solve it any faster even taking 
into consideration the expertise of the person and the lube/speed 
abilities of any given cube.  I see these records and videos of people 
doing it in like 7 seconds and I just don&#x27;t see how anyone could get 
much faster than this even with lucky solves...but as I said I am just 
a beginner.

Sorry for the long question.  Just wondering.  Any hints or advice 
appreciated.  

Thanks

deathrisingup

          <div class="email-content">just getting back from a business trip. wanted to celebrate my first <br>
success at a totally blind 3x3x3 cube solve.<br>
<br>
I have made several attempts at this with the same random scramble.<br>
what I did was use cube explorer to generate an alg so i could return <br>
to that state and try again once I made a mistake.<br>
<br>
that way I would not have to re-memorize another set of numbers just <br>
because i messed up an alg.<br>
<br>
I had one other totally blind attempt that I went all the way through <br>
without messing up an alg, and would have had a completely solved <br>
cube. but I had used the wrong setup move (i think) and 2 corners <br>
where not oriented correctly.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m using Bill McGaugh&#x27;s method, but I&#x27;m thinking about using a <br>
different numbering order that is more intuitive for me.<br>
<br>
I cant say what my time was. I wasn&#x27;t trying to speed through it by <br>
any means.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m just proud to say &quot;I DID IT&quot; YAY! (party noises heard, confetti <br>
and balloons flying)<br>

an hour or so and couldn&#x27;t find it...<br>
<br>
I am playing with the Gabbasoft program on a 9x9x9 cube. Very<br>
interesting. My method for solving the 5x5x5 works pretty well, except<br>
that I just make up solving the last two centers as I go. I can&#x27;t seem<br>
to adapt the algorithms published for the 5x5x5. I can&#x27;t work it out<br>
in my head in under an hour... :-) for the 9x9x9... Is there a<br>
published move for swapping arbitrary center tiles? I don&#x27;t care if it<br>
scrambles the edges, since I do those later.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I know this doesn&#x27;t answer your question full (ie give you direct
algorithms) but the centres on the large cubes can be fixed by using
commutators (see Joel van Noorts commutator tutorial on
www.solvethecube.co.uk for a VERY good explanation of commutators in
general).

For example, do (without multi-slicing, so only turning one layer of
the cube at a time) (r&#x27; d&#x27; r) U (r&#x27; d r) U&#x27; on a solved 5x5x5. You can
see that 2 corner pieces appear to have swapped (although this is
impossible it can be explained by a cycle of 3 corners where two
corners are the same colour).

You can extend these types of algorithms to larger cubes, just move
the layers that are required. Solve as much as you can intuitively,
and then finish of the remainder with commutators.

<br>
  just getting back from a business trip. wanted to celebrate my first <br>
  success at a totally blind 3x3x3 cube solve.<br>
<br>
  I have made several attempts at this with the same random scramble.<br>
  what I did was use cube explorer to generate an alg so i could return <br>

<br>
  that way I would not have to re-memorize another set of numbers just <br>
  because i messed up an alg.<br>
<br>
  I had one other totally blind attempt that I went all the way through <br>
  without messing up an alg, and would have had a completely solved <br>
  cube. but I had used the wrong setup move (i think) and 2 corners <br>
  where not oriented correctly.<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;m using Bill McGaugh&#x27;s method, but I&#x27;m thinking about using a <br>
  different numbering order that is more intuitive for me.<br>
<br>
  I cant say what my time was. I wasn&#x27;t trying to speed through it by <br>
  any means.<br>

By the way, anyone want to beat Matyas new unofficial blindfolded relay ?

I think he is actually disappointed to have done that in more than 60

Congratulations Matyas !

For example with the Pochmann v1 method, setup this case:

L F2 R&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; R2 F2 L&#x27; U&#x27;

To solve corners, the general algorithm is R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27;
F R

So if you to the setup move F instead or R&#x27;, you will end up with 2
misoriented corners because you did one setup move wrong. ;-)

nice for it to have a name.

I also found a very instructive video on YouTube that helped a lot. I
very nearly finished a 19x19x19 on GabbaSoft&#x27;s simulator yesterday
except that apparently the Undo stack gets VERY confused after it does
9999 moves... sigh. Instead of undoing, it did about 6 random moves
which I was never able to fully reverse manually.

I might be able to create an &quot;install kit&quot; that might help. Or I

          <div class="email-content">I forgot to add that the pyraminx I had at Finnish Open, which you
also tried, is heavily modified, because once one of its bearings fell
off after like one or two weeks after buying it, so it became very
unstable and it was hard to speedsolve it anymore. Fixing the pyraminx
was kind of brutal thing to do, since the screws to adjust the
tightness are located inside the corner pieces, so I cut the tip of
the corner pieces with a small saw to get access to those screws and I
also removed all the bearings to make it smooth to turn (similar to
rubik&#x27;s cube, no &quot;clicking&quot;). I&#x27;ve heard that there have been other
cases where one or more of the bearings has fell off, which has caused
the pyraminx to become unstable and popping all the time, so the
quality of the meffert&#x27;s pyraminx is maybe a bit questionable (at
least for speed solving), although I don&#x27;t have much experience with
pyraminxes, so maybe most of the Meffert&#x27;s pyraminxes are just fine. I
haven&#x27;t tried any other type of pyraminxes than the normal Meffert&#x27;s
one, so maybe someone else could say a word about the other types of
pyraminxes. There are several kind of pyraminxes at Meffert&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m
not sure if the mechanism is indentical in those (I guess so though).

<br>
I decided at 12:30 in the morning that I&#x27;d try three cubes <br>
blindfolded. Two cubes was relatively easy; I can do it in under nine <br>
minutes on average, but the jump from two to three was larger than <br>
from one to two, strangely enough. I scrambled three cubes, but <br>
unfortunately, all three cubes had different stickering: one with my <br>
signature purple stickers, one with orange stickers, and one with a <br>
set of &quot;skidproof stickers&quot; from cube4you (probably the first to ever <br>
actually use them, but don&#x27;t quote me on that), so memorizing was a <br>
bit strange.<br>
<br>
Scrambles were relatively easy, no parities on any of the three <br>
cubes. Did I mention that I like cycles that can be completed in one <br>
setup move? :) For example, L (Z-Perm) L&#x27;. Additionally, I like using <br>
M2(P) for edges as it reduces thinking. I also did long, but <br>
effortless algorithms (the 3-orient I use I hate mirroring) so CO <br>
turned out to be 60+ moves on a solve. EO were all setups for one <br>
algorithm, (U R&#x27; F R)x5 on two solves. CP was just a bunch of 3-<br>
cycles (but I have trouble memorizing CP).<br>
<br>
Perhaps in the near future I can actually attempt a multi-BLD. It&#x27;s <br>
really nerveracking in the realm of speedcubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">But a lot of those will be identical to solve. For example:

1) All corners are correctly permuted
2) Edge 1,2,3 need to be rotated &quot;clockwise&quot;

This situation is completely identical to edges 2,3,4 needing to be rotated clockwise, just as 3,4,5 and 4,5,1 and 5,1,2.

It is really difficult to calculate this. Just perform your logic on the 3x3x3:
(4!/2 * 4!/2)/4 = 36, yet there are only 21 PLL&#x27;s. (and some people don&#x27;t count mirrors and say there are only 14)

I guess the &quot;easiest way&quot; to find out is to write an optimal solver that solves all 720 cases, corrects for cube rotations and compares the algs :)
Or you could skip the optimal solver part, but that wouldn&#x27;t be as helpfull to Erik because he would like to learn all 523 PLL&#x27;s so he can finally get a sub 60 solve.

  Sorry it isn&#x27;t working for you Per. It appears it must be something 
  to do with the Windows software on your computer. Or possibly a 
  problem with sufficient memory. You might try Windows Update to see 
  if there is any .NET-related component to be installed. I don&#x27;t know 
  what Windows you are using, but I am using XP (Home version for USA)

  I might be able to create an &quot;install kit&quot; that might help. Or I 
  could look into installing and using a different compiler (non-.NET) 
  to build another executable.

here is the link to the article that i learned from

http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/
&lt;http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/>



on a side note here, I was having trouble mixing up the setup moves used
for say...edge orientation vs permutation. or corner orientation vs
permutation.

the way I got past this was to recognize that the B layer is used as a
&quot;transport&quot; layer for EO,(RM alg) and L for EP.(t-perm alg) the R for
CO, (in alg, once or twice) and the F layer for CP (t-perm) that helped
me not get them mixed up.

it&#x27;s possible i used one or the other or the reverse of on or the other
when un-doing the setup.(possibly resulting in a twisted corner)

Or then again I might have just forgot something or did one to many
maneuvers. (I have a 3.5 yo son running around here)



here is the starting mix i used...

U&#x27; F R B R2 U B&#x27; F2 L&#x27; D2 F&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; F2 R&#x27; U&#x27;

which should give you:

these I remembered more &quot;visually&quot; or by spacial relation no so much the
numbers

EO 0101 1001 1111

CO 0111 1110

I didnt remember actual sequences for permutation I just remembered
where each corner belonged and made a number of it , i figured the
sequence out one piece at a time as I went

CP 13  48   56 27

EP 21  103     98  75    116  412

I did EO first, then CO, then CP, then EP

I did some cheating on EO as all wrong edges are across from each
other.(didn&#x27;t use setup moves, just turned the whole cube)

the corners that ended up wrong where either UFL, or UFR (cant remember
which) and DBL, or DBR (cant remember which)

also to note: I only used 3 algs, RM, IN, and T-perm (as listed in the
above link) (I didn&#x27;t use the &quot;out&quot; alg.)

I&#x27;m not sure if I did it the easiest way or not, but I wrote a short
program to print all of the possible PLLs and removed duplicates.  It
found 152 cases.  The output is here:

I have Visual Studio latest version installed so it cannot be a .net

152 seems like a logical number and is about the number I felt there

  Yes, the amount of PLL&#x27;s is of course fewer if you first include all
  possible U moves....
  152 seems like a logical number and is about the number I felt there
  would be, yet I&#x27;m not going to learn all of them probably ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m planning to hold a competition in Pleasantville, New York (about<br>
45 minutes north of New York City) on Saturday, November 3.  The<br>
contest will start at around 9:30 AM.  Right now I&#x27;m trying to get an<br>
idea of how many people would be interested.<br>
<br>
Right now I&#x27;m planning on holding the following events: 3x3<br>
speedsolve, 2x2 speedsolve, 4x4 speedsolve, 5x5 speedsolve, 3x3<br>
one-handed, 3x3 blindfolded, magic, master magic.<br>
<br>
Other events may be held if there&#x27;s enough interest.<br>
<br>
The venue is the Pleasantville Presbyterian Church at 400 Bedford Road<br>
in Pleasantville.  Registration will probably cost $5.00 to cover the<br>
cost of the room.<br>
<br>
Email me or post here if you&#x27;re interested or have any requests for<br>
other events.<br>

          <div class="email-content">as it stands its only a thought about hosting this event. i dont even 
have any info reguarding a venue. once that is set in then i will 
discuss a list of events. however it will depend on how many people 
will show up on what events we can do. if there are alot of people it 
will be harder to do more events. 

Does anyone live in the area that might be able to think of a good 
location ie (schools science centers, libraries...etc)

I realize that a small brute-force program like this will not be very optimised, but 1 day for (7!/2)*(7!/2) = 6350400 possible PLL&#x27;s seems to be very long. 

I tried &quot;guestimating&quot; the number for 7 and further, but I could find the logic. Hopefully the next part will be readable in web/mail/html:

      Number of adjacent faces
     Number of possible configurations

As you can (hopefully) see for a regular 3x3x3 (4 adjacent faces) 22 out of 36 PLL&#x27;s are unique (61%), For a regular Megaminx (5 adjacent faces) the numbers you calculated are 152 out of 720 (21%) so I didn&#x27;t expect the 7252 out of 21600 (34%) to be the next value. Are you sure the numbers are correct or am I misinterpreting them?

I got the program working on a win2003 server machine, so i will 
continue to track down the malfunctionality on my own desktop winxp 
pro machine. Making a version that runs independently of .net 
framework would be very nice. Also i like installers to tell me if 
any dependent component is missing. Though IMHO a cube solver 
shouldn&#x27;t have any such dependencies at all ... ;-)

using the older Visual Studio .NET 2003.

I now see I was using the &quot;wrong&quot; project type. I believe I can create
an .EXE that doesn&#x27;t require the .NET framework. I&#x27;ll do that tonight.

Mine calculated 7 in 50 minutes, and the result is 129618.

> As you can (hopefully) see for a regular 3x3x3 (4 adjacent faces) 22
out of 36 PLL&#x27;s are unique (61%), For a regular Megaminx (5 adjacent
faces) the numbers you calculated are 152 out of 720 (21%) so I didn&#x27;t
expect the 7252 out of 21600 (34%) to be the next value. Are you sure
the numbers are correct or am I misinterpreting them?

I don&#x27;t see any reason why they would be wrong. Especially because
that would mean that I made the same mistake, which just doesn&#x27;t seem
very probable. If you are really concerned about this, write your own
version and let&#x27;s see how the results differ.

For the second question, just do a slice, replace the group with the
egder that will fit the slice back, put that into place, and slice
back to fit centers + pair up the set up edges.

Good luck.

          <div class="email-content">Hopefully this will be clearer than my last copy/paste from Excel:

Number of adjacent faces, Number of allowed possibly unique configurations, Number of found unique configurations, unique percentage
1, 1, 1, 100%
2, 1, 1, 100%
3, 3, 3, 100%
4, 36, 22, 61%
5, 720, 152, 21%
6, 21600, 7252, 34%
7, 907200, 129618, 14%

I find it fascinating that the unique percentage of 5 and/or 6 adjacent faces don&#x27;t follow the downward trend. I can find 3 different ways to explain this:

1) We should make separate trendlines for odd and even number of faces. This would result in two downward trends. I think this is very likely and I would suspect 8 to be around 20% and 9 around 9%.
1-3-5-7 = 100%, 100%, 21%, 14%
2-4-6 = 200%, 61%, 34%
2) The 152 for 5 is incorrect and should be higher (about twice as high)
3) The 7252 for 6 is incorrect and should be lower (about twice as low)

Would it be possible to calculate number 8 also or would that take to much resources?

  I don&#x27;t see any reason why they would be wrong. Especially because

  There are robots out there which *do* find solutions within 20 moves.<br>
<br>
  http://www.mechatrons.com/rubotii.htm<br>
<br>
  With an improved mechanics more than two moves/second should be <br>
  possible and an average of less than 10 seconds will be realistic.<br>
  I personally do not think an *average* less than 10 seconds will ever <br>
  be realistic for humans.<br>
<br>
  Herbert<br>
<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; What would the limit be for a robot?<br>
  &gt; <br>
  &gt; It could find a 20 move solution instantly, so the problem would <br>
  be <br>
  &gt; how fast it could execute it. Humans have shown that 10 moves a <br>
  &gt; second is physically possible. A robot should be able to do at <br>
  least <br>
  &gt; that, so that seems to say that 2 seconds or better is possible.<br>
  &gt; <br>
  &gt; I have two somewhat conflicting thoughts on that.<br>
  &gt; <br>
  &gt; 1. I think the cubes themselves can be twisted much faster that <br>
  that<br>
  &gt; 2. I think it will be *very* hard to build a robot that turns <br>
  faster <br>
  &gt; than a human<br>

          <div class="email-content">Evens involve parity (and more symmetry).
I was going to send this in another email:

By some logic, and agreement with the terms sofar,
{1, 1,     3, 22, 152, 7252, 129618}
I get PLLs[n]= (((n-1)!)^2) / (2+2*(Mod[n,2]))+x
The mod comes from parity. The x goes
{3/4,1/2,     2,4,8,52,18}
x comes with all the rotationally symmetric cases that don&#x27;t show up enough
to cancel out. Its significance should dwindle, but it&#x27;s interesting to
study.
For odd n, it seems that x=((n-1)^2)/2 . This makes sense, but I&#x27;m not sure
reasoning extends: basically, there are n-1 edge permutations
isomorphic under rotations, and this is multiplied by the
differently-isomorphically-constrained (ouch!) corners, which appears to be
(n-1)/2 sofar.
For even n, the issue is fancier, and probably needs some curious
combinatorics.


So, by some simplification, the fraction representing the percentages you
seek should tend to:
( ((n-2)!)^(-2) + (1+Mod[n,2])^(-1) )*2/n

The first terms in the parentheses dwindles quickly, leaving:
2/(n(1+Mod[n,2]))

Evens: 2/n
Odds: 1/n
(Will someone provide an intuitve explanation?)

So we&#x27;ve got two tightening, hyperbolic lower bounds on alternating terms.
The pecentages I get are:
{100., 200., 100., 62.5, 21.1, 33.4, 14.3, 25.0, 11.1, 20.0,
9.09, 16.7, 7.69, 14.3, 6.67, 12.5, 5.88, 11.1, 5.26, 10.0}
By the simple approximation:
{100., 100., 33.3, 50.0, 20.0, 33.3, 14.3, 25.0, 11.1, 20.0,
9.09, 16.7, 7.69, 14.3, 6.67, 12.5, 5.88, 11.1, 5.26, 10.0}

That&#x27;s 25% and 11% for 8 and 9 (both a teensy bit low).
8, if I&#x27;m right, should be 12700800+x, where x is probably in the low 100&#x27;s.
(I&#x27;m not trying that brute-force. It takes Mathematica 17 seconds just to
increment a variable 1.2*10^7 times, and I have no inclination to set up 51
megachecks.)

I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reasonable closed-form expression for both even and odd
cases (which can easily be combined), but I don&#x27;t want to figure out how
many rotations don&#x27;t cancel.

Subject: Re: [Speed cubing group] Re: Megaminx PLL


Hopefully this will be clearer than my last copy/paste from Excel:

Number of adjacent faces, Number of allowed possibly unique configurations,
Number of found unique configurations, unique percentage
1, 1, 1, 100%
2, 1, 1, 100%
3, 3, 3, 100%
4, 36, 22, 61%
5, 720, 152, 21%
6, 21600, 7252, 34%
7, 907200, 129618, 14%

I find it fascinating that the unique percentage of 5 and/or 6 adjacent
faces don&#x27;t follow the downward trend. I can find 3 different ways to
explain this:

1) We should make separate trendlines for odd and even number of faces. This
would result in two downward trends. I think this is very likely and I would
suspect 8 to be around 20% and 9 around 9%.
1-3-5-7 = 100%, 100%, 21%, 14%
2-4-6 = 200%, 61%, 34%
2) The 152 for 5 is incorrect and should be higher (about twice as high)
3) The 7252 for 6 is incorrect and should be lower (about twice as low)

Would it be possible to calculate number 8 also or would that take to much
resources?

Mine calculated 7 in 50 minutes, and the result is 129618.

expect the 7252 out of 21600 (34%) to be the next value. Are you sure
the numbers are correct or am I misinterpreting them?

I don&#x27;t see any reason why they would be wrong. Especially because
that would mean that I made the same mistake, which just doesn&#x27;t seem
very probable. If you are really concerned about this, write your own
version and let&#x27;s see how the results differ.

          <div class="email-content">The number of PLL cases for 4 adjacent faces is 72, not 36.

When you have an even number of adjacent faces, the corners and edges
can both be either an even permutation or an odd permutation. When you
rotate the last layer of the 3x3x3 cube (4 adjacent faces), a
quarter-turn does 4-cycles on both the corners and edges. Since
4-cycles are odd permutations, odd permutations are reachable for both
corners and edges (but they must be the same, both odd or both even).

For the Megaminx, a fifth-turn does 5-cycles of the corners and edges.
Since 5-cycles are even permutations, the corners can never be in an
odd permutation, nor can the edges.

So likewise, I believe it&#x27;s 43200, not 21600, for 6 adjacent faces.

  Evens involve parity (and more symmetry).
  I was going to send this in another email:

  By some logic, and agreement with the terms sofar,
  {1, 1, 3, 22, 152, 7252, 129618}
  I get PLLs[n]= (((n-1)!)^2) / (2+2*(Mod[n,2]))+x
  The mod comes from parity. The x goes
  {3/4,1/2, 2,4,8,52,18}
  x comes with all the rotationally symmetric cases that don&#x27;t show up enough
  to cancel out. Its significance should dwindle, but it&#x27;s interesting to
  study.
  For odd n, it seems that x=((n-1)^2)/2 . This makes sense, but I&#x27;m not sure
  reasoning extends: basically, there are n-1 edge permutations
  isomorphic under rotations, and this is multiplied by the
  differently-isomorphically-constrained (ouch!) corners, which appears to be
  (n-1)/2 sofar.
  For even n, the issue is fancier, and probably needs some curious
  combinatorics.

  So, by some simplification, the fraction representing the percentages you
  seek should tend to:
  ( ((n-2)!)^(-2) + (1+Mod[n,2])^(-1) )*2/n

  The first terms in the parentheses dwindles quickly, leaving:
  2/(n(1+Mod[n,2]))

  Evens: 2/n
  Odds: 1/n
  (Will someone provide an intuitve explanation?)

  So we&#x27;ve got two tightening, hyperbolic lower bounds on alternating terms.
  The pecentages I get are:
  {100., 200., 100., 62.5, 21.1, 33.4, 14.3, 25.0, 11.1, 20.0,
  9.09, 16.7, 7.69, 14.3, 6.67, 12.5, 5.88, 11.1, 5.26, 10.0}
  By the simple approximation:
  {100., 100., 33.3, 50.0, 20.0, 33.3, 14.3, 25.0, 11.1, 20.0,
  9.09, 16.7, 7.69, 14.3, 6.67, 12.5, 5.88, 11.1, 5.26, 10.0}

  That&#x27;s 25% and 11% for 8 and 9 (both a teensy bit low).
  8, if I&#x27;m right, should be 12700800+x, where x is probably in the low 100&#x27;s.
  (I&#x27;m not trying that brute-force. It takes Mathematica 17 seconds just to
  increment a variable 1.2*10^7 times, and I have no inclination to set up 51
  megachecks.)

  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reasonable closed-form expression for both even and odd
  cases (which can easily be combined), but I don&#x27;t want to figure out how
  many rotations don&#x27;t cancel.

  Hopefully this will be clearer than my last copy/paste from Excel:

  Number of adjacent faces, Number of allowed possibly unique configurations,
  Number of found unique configurations, unique percentage
  1, 1, 1, 100%
  2, 1, 1, 100%
  3, 3, 3, 100%
  4, 36, 22, 61%
  5, 720, 152, 21%
  6, 21600, 7252, 34%
  7, 907200, 129618, 14%

  I find it fascinating that the unique percentage of 5 and/or 6 adjacent
  faces don&#x27;t follow the downward trend. I can find 3 different ways to
  explain this:

  1) We should make separate trendlines for odd and even number of faces. This
  would result in two downward trends. I think this is very likely and I would
  suspect 8 to be around 20% and 9 around 9%.
  1-3-5-7 = 100%, 100%, 21%, 14%
  2-4-6 = 200%, 61%, 34%
  2) The 152 for 5 is incorrect and should be higher (about twice as high)
  3) The 7252 for 6 is incorrect and should be lower (about twice as low)

  Would it be possible to calculate number 8 also or would that take to much
  resources?

How can you say it&#x27;s brute-force even though you haven&#x27;t seen it?

As Bruce said, the mistake in your numbers is that you calculated
evens as (n!/2)*(n!/2), when it should be (n!*n!)/2.

Hey,

In my opinion, Rubik&#x27;s 2x2 is awful. Anything else available (except 
Chinese knockoff 4x4s) are okay for speedcubing.

But this robot solves only a prepared cube, where all six center

          <div class="email-content">Oh wait... that&#x27;s not an explanation of the part that didn&#x27;t get filmed.

So the night before, John performed the 3 cups trick and in the end, there
were potatoes under the three cups.  We call up John for a mystery event,
and the cover is on the table and John looks at me and says, &quot;There&#x27;s a
potato under there isn&#x27;t there?&quot;  He had found two potatoes in the morning,
and deduced I had taken the third.

But we went along with the plan.  &quot;You have 15 seconds to inspect the
potato.  Please make sure that this is a real potato, and I haven&#x27;t done
anything to it, no secret compartments or loaded springs.  Now please place
the potato down.  But how do you solve a potato?  Well, in order to solve
this puzzle, Leyan here is going to show you a new algorithm.&quot;

And then you have Leyan doing his solves, and that&#x27;s where the video begins.

Yeah, so we were sitting around still marveling at how cool John&#x27;s magic
show was, and well.. John was staying in the hotel room with me and Toby.
That night, I think he, Bob Burton, and some other folks stayed up until 6
AM hanging out in the hotel so he came back to the room quite late.  I heard
the door open, so I was semi-awake, and then I felt something brush by my
ear.  When I woke up, there was a potato next to my head.

So I found the three potatoes he used for the magic show, and decided to
hide two of them... one in his jacket, another in his shoe, and then I took
the third potato and came up with the idea.  Originally, Chris Dzoan was
supposed to do the potato swap but he wasn&#x27;t in a good position...

Definitely one of the most nervous moments for me during the competition.
We kind of had to play it by ear because Chris was out of position, so I
just swapped the potato and threw the potato to him instead.

Leyan&#x27;s distraction was great!  Actually, Chris Pelley has a video of Leyan
doing that &quot;algorithm-solve&quot; in Orlando Florida.  I think Leyan and I were
by the pool and he &quot;solves&quot; a cube in 3 seconds.

          <div class="email-content">[I sent this in the morning, but it didn&#x27;t get delivered.]<br>
Good point about the evens. How could I forget that if  I explicitly used it<br>
to calculate values?<br>
Let me revise:<br>
<br>
So, by some simplification, the fraction representing the percentages you<br>
seek should tend to:<br>
(1+(1+Mod[n,2])*(((n-2)!)^(-2)))/n<br>
<br>
The first terms in the parentheses dwindles quickly, leaving:<br>
1/n<br>
<br>
(Will someone provide an intuitve explanation?)<br>
I will, this time.  The total 100% assumes, without loss of generality, that<br>
a certain piece is fixed. However, that corners can rotationally &quot;switch<br>
roles&quot; in a non-symmetric PLL exactly n times, and so 1/n should be<br>
non-isomorphic under rotation. The extra (x), again, depends directly on the<br>
number of PLLs that don&#x27;t show up n  times in the 100%, such as the n-edge<br>
clockwise cycle (for odds) or the edge-across switcher (evens).<br>
<br>
So we&#x27;ve got a tightening, hyperbolic lower bound.<br>
The pecentages I get are:<br>
{100., 100., 100., 31.3, 21.1, 16.7, 14.3, 12.5, 11.1, 10.0,<br>
9.09, 8.33, 7.69, 7.14, 6.67, 6.25, 5.88, 5.56, 5.26, 5.00}<br>
<br>
By the simple approximation:<br>
{100., 50.0, 33.3, 25.0, 20.0, 16.7, 14.3, 12.5 ...}<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m still sure there&#x27;s a reasonable closed-form expression for both even and<br>
odd<br>
cases (which can easily be combined), but I don&#x27;t want to figure out how<br>
many rotations don&#x27;t cancel.<br>
<br>
<br>
This would make a great combinatorics project:<br>
<br>
First, get a closed form for the exact n-sided minx values.<br>
Then, add more sets of n edges, with different considerations of parity.<br>
(for example, 3 sets of 4 permutations list a 4x4x4 PLL -how many are<br>
there?)<br>
<br>
Then consider these questions for OLL. How many OLL&#x27;s are there for larger<br>
cubes, &quot;minxes&quot; with more sides, or<br>
both (such as , how many OLL&#x27;s are the on the rim of a face of a Gigaminx?).<br>
<br>
What if the corners don&#x27;t have 3 sides (octahedron-minx has 4, icosaminx has<br>
5)?<br>
http://users.skynet.be/gelatinbrain/Applets/Magic%20Polyhedra/octa_f1.htm<br>
http://users.skynet.be/gelatinbrain/Applets/Magic%20Polyhedra/icosa_f0.htm<br>
(and these have some other issues, too, depending on defitition)<br>
<br>
I would love to know the sequence of number of OLLs and PLLs on a simplified<br>
giga-icosaminx :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Just some points on the 4x4x4...

I bought 2 Rubik&#x27;s Studio 4x4x4, and they were quite nice out of the
box but not amazing. I used them for a little while without lube to
&quot;wear them in&quot; but I got impatient so then against advice and my
better judgement I lubed them. At first I thought, WOW, they felt very
slick but after playing a bit they immediately became too loose and
locked up a lot (especially the outer layers).

I bought the new cubes because my best 4x4x4 (the one with the tiles)
had become a little too loose and was popping a lot. In it&#x27;s day it
had been an amazing cube. So I decided to take them apart, and I built
a new cube from the old edges, corners, and core, and the new
centre-pieces. And this new cube is once more amazing. So it seems
that if you have an old cube that was good and is now getting too
loose, it can be rescued with new centre-pieces. The edge pieces also
feel different to the ones in the new cube, I used to use rubik&#x27;s lube
in it and now the edges seem to have a waxy, shiny coating which seems
to help smooth movement a lot. Perhaps that is also a factor.

          <div class="email-content">So I&#x27;ve become interested in the 7x7. It&#x27;s an odd order cube making <br>
it much less frustrating than say the 6. I wish that there was a way <br>

color scheme, but still the red and orange are too close in shade <br>
for my liking. Ever since I started using the Ctrl button for doing <br>
180s, my times have started going down a lot, but I&#x27;m wondering from <br>
the people that have been doing this a lot longer, what good times <br>
are, what a good turning rate should be.<br>
<br>
My last solve was a 21:14.12 using exactly 666 turns (creepy, I <br>
know). Now If I could have done 1 turn/sec that should have taken <br>
11.1 minutes. On the UWR listing I see people getting sub-15 with <br>
over 900 turns, which I can&#x27;t imagine. Those solves are faster than <br>
1 turn/second!<br>
<br>
Maybe I just need more practice...<br>
<br>
I just tried again and got 20:58.45 over 592 turns. I think that my <br>
centers phase there was horrible (a lot of solving all the center <br>
pieces into the wrong center, which is strange). I think that what <br>
helped in this plast solve was that I was doig a much more <br>
methodical edge pairing step. I was following what I normally do for <br>
5x5 edges, with some extra two layer turns whenever things where <br>
already paried with outer edges. I&#x27;d do the inner wings and then the <br>
outer ones. I think this makes recognition a ton easier. I came up <br>
with a way of doing last two centers without commutators now too. <br>
With computer solves, I immediately just resort to doing the LL as 4-<br>
look CP, CO, EO, EP. This is helping for the times I&#x27;m currently <br>
getting. I try for ZBF2L if I can, but then forcing myself do do <br>
only the 2 CP algs that don&#x27;t flip edges... hem.<br>

            You could also post any questions on my chatterbox, and I or other

cubers can help you (we also wouldn&#x27;t have to flood this mailing

list). I wish people would stop calling it my method, though. Because

it&#x27;s not.

Grrr... I wish I had seen John&#x27;s flyers a day earlier. I thought he&#x27;s 
a cuber who happens to know some magic, now I know it&#x27;s the other way 
around and he&#x27;s a professional (and quite good) magician. So I sadly 
missed his show, walking through the park instead (which was nice, 
too, but...).

Cheers!

I believe I should be able to make it to the Pleasantville competition.

Pennsylvania and Virginia would be farther for me, and I would say
Pennsylvania is a possibility, and Virginia rather doubtful.

I just came home from swedish open and I can tell you a few results<br>

Mátyás Kuti solved 8(!) cubes blindfolded in 27:18. Memorization time<br>
was 15:00. He also solved a 4x4 blindfolded in 7:1x. Not a WR but<br>
still a very good achievement.<br>
<br>
There were also new WRs for Master Magic with 1.83 single and 2.06 by,<br>
I think it was, Mate Horvath and Milan Baticz.<br>
<br>
I myself did very well and ended 3rd in 3x3OH with 26.21avg and 3rd in<br>

          <div class="email-content">I disagree about Master Magic not being a puzzle. A lot of people seem to think that Magic/Master Magic is only meant to be moved from solved-on-front to solved-on-back. I have even met some pretty fast magic solvers that couldn&#x27;t actually solve the magics.

If you own a magic, scramble it, make it change shapes, scramble it some more and then try to get it back to one of the two solved states (you can choose either one depending on the &quot;scramble&quot;). To me, that is how Magics are meant to be solved!

  5x5. Megaminx&#x27; are sold out, and master magic isn&#x27;t really a puzzle, but
  quite fun none the less.

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Twisty Puzzles - What to get?<br>
<br>
<br>
  My family moved recently, and for my help in getting everything done, <br>
  my mother has offered to but me any twisty puzzle I want, as long as <br>
  it&#x27;s not overly expensive. I already have a 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 2x2x2, and a <br>
  timer. I&#x27;ve narrowed the choices down to either a 5x5x5, a Megaminx, <br>
  or a Master Magic. Do you guys have any suggestion as to what I should <br>
  get? (It doesn&#x27;t have to be one of the three above-mentioned puzzles.)<br>

basically my friend usually registers with the name &quot;Danny Parks&quot; but
he must have put &quot;Daniel Park&quot; this time on accident so i don&#x27;t know
if there is some way to merge them cause its kinda bad to be taking up
2 ranks even if its that low on the ranks.

          <div class="email-content">So I&#x27;m suprised to see that this has not yet been mentioned. Last <br>
weekend at the CalTech competition, there were a few Olympic cubes <br>
(two 5, one 6, and one 7 I believe).<br>
<br>
First of all, THEY EXIST! THEY ARE REAL! And they turn pretty nicely. <br>
I didn&#x27;t play with the 6 at all but I heard it didn&#x27;t turn so well <br>
relative to the others. The 5 turns better than the regular brand. The <br>
7 was very easy to turn and hardly ever locked up.<br>
<br>
I set a 19:13.09 on my second attempt, the first wasn&#x27;t timed (but <br>
probably faster). I had forgotten about the 10 minute limitation of <br>
stackmat timers. Strange that my fastest Gabbasoft record is just over <br>
15 minutes. I was pretty sure I&#x27;d break 15 on it, but it didn&#x27;t happen.<br>
<br>
On a side-note, I&#x27;d like to remind myself on here, that I owe AdamZ <br>
$15-16 (you accept PayPal right?).<br>
<br>
It is not yet clear (propably even less clear than in the past) when <br>
these beautiful feats of engineering will be available to the general <br>
public. I would like to purchese a 7 for $2000 (USD), but that is not <br>
an acceptable offer for anyone it seems.<br>
<br>
There are at least five 7&#x27;s in existance. Frank has three. He used an <br>
Olympic 5x5 for his offical times, and this was decided to be allowed <br>
by WCA. (Not that I care either way, but I thought someone here might <br>
find that good to know.) It seems such cubes are allowed.<br>
<br>
The results page on WCA.org is missing my 5x5 times on the Final <br>
round. I came in 3rd. I already e-mailed Ambie and them, but just <br>
thought I should mention it here to increase the likely hood that it <br>
will get fixed.<br>
<br>
It was a pretty nice tournament I thought, but not as great as some of <br>
the other ones I&#x27;ve been to. Though I must, say some fairly nice <br>
rewards where given. Ambie artwork, chalk, deck of playing cards, <br>
buble gum, chocolate, bubble solution, stickers, M&amp;Ms, and possibly <br>
other randomness. I was amused. I actually don&#x27;t have playing cards, <br>
and really wanted some. I also want &quot;Set&quot; cards, I recommend that you <br>
get some, they are awesome, but I digress.<br>
<br>
There was a last minute-ish decision to run a second round of 5x5 it <br>
felt like. This I was very happy with, and set a 2:15.xx time in, as I <br>
vaguely recall.<br>
<br>
Btw, I recommend you guys who fly, to show up 2-3 hrs prior to the <br>
flight leaving for domestic ones. Me... well I missed both my incoming <br>
and outgoing flights and had to take later ones. On the upside, I got <br>
to fly back with ChrisK in the seat next to me. That made the flight <br>
feel like nothing, just a bunch of good quality cubing.<br>
<br>
The only issue I ahve with the Olympic cubes are the black stickers. I <br>
mean sure, it makes sence to have black stickers on white plastic, but <br>
it is too distracting I have found (Frank first mentioned this). Um, <br>
another thing, why not black plastic? So the black and the dark-blue <br>
stickers are quite close and very confusing under poorly-lit <br>
conditions. This is a good excuse for my time on it.<br>
<br>
I found the trip fairly pleasent. The airport security not so much. <br>
The 7x7 made the competition entirely worthwhile for me though.<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Screw does not stay stable in DIY cube.<br>
<br>
<br>
  I have a white 3x3x3 DIY cube from puzzleproz, and on one side. The<br>
  screw turns as I turn the side sometimes. It&#x27;s slight, but after an<br>
  hour or so, it will get really tight or really loose, because the<br>
  screw has changed. I don&#x27;t know why it happens with only this one<br>
  side, and it didn&#x27;t used to. How can I fix this problem, without<br>
  super-gluing it? I would like to leave it adjustable for later...<br>
<br>

You would think wrong

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/magic.htm#posit

Master Magic has 16 * 12 / 2 = 96 flat square shapes.
It has 10 * 16 * 12 + 3 * 16 * 12 / 2 + 2 * 16 * 12  / 4 = 2304 flat shapes
>From my experience playing with it, I would guess that the number of 
differently connected 3D shapes is between 500 and 5000 and that is just the 
shapes, not taking into account how the rings look at that moment.

If someone knows how many differently connected 3D shapes Magic/Master Magic 
has, let me know please.

          <div class="email-content">I note that Dan&#x27;s algorithm generates a &quot;two-tone&quot;
cube-in-cube-in-cube-in-cube (two colors on each face) while the
pictures from Daniel&#x27;s links showed a &quot;three-tone&quot;
cube-in-cube-in-cube-in-cube. Not to worry. Just do Dan&#x27;s algorithm
followed by doing one of the two parts again to get a &quot;three-tone&quot;
pattern. Or it can also be done using the latter part followed by a
two-corner twisting algorithm applied as a 2x2x2 alg on the 4x4x4.
Using Dan&#x27;s convention of lower case for double layer turns:  (U&#x27; L&#x27;
U&#x27; F&#x27; R2 B&#x27; R F U B2 U B&#x27; L U&#x27; F U R F&#x27;)(b2 r&#x27; d r d&#x27; r&#x27; d r u r&#x27; d&#x27; r
d r&#x27; d&#x27; r u&#x27; b2).

Or you can swap those two 2x2x2 corners instead of twisting for a
&quot;four-tone&quot; cube-in-cube-in-cube-in-cube (again with lower case
meaning double-layer moves): (U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; R2 B&#x27; R F U B2 U B&#x27; L U&#x27; F U
R F&#x27;)(r b r&#x27; b2 r u&#x27; b u r2 b2). Using similar ideas, you should be
able create other variations of &quot;four-tone&quot;
cube-in-cube-in-cube-in-cube patterns, or various
cube-in-cube-in-cube-in-cube-in-cube patterns on a 5x5x5.

Lots of different cube in cube in cube in cubes:

     I don&#x27;t know from firsthand experience, but my
understanding is that if you let the superglue dry
completely, as Dennis said, it does not serve as an
adhesive, but rather builds up the structure of the
threads to allow them to get a firmer bite. I think it
should allow you to still make adjustments. However,
too much adjusting may very well be the reason that
the screw has become as loose as it is.

Don&#x27;t worry, this IS cubing related :) So, if I had an array from<br>

<br>
Example array 0..11 becomes 5 10 9 0 11 8 7 2 3 4 1 6<br>

          <div class="email-content">Side-note: First of all I recommend studing the ways that ACube 
and/or CubeExplorer store this structure, becasue this obvious way 
to do it turns out to be wasteful in the number of bits used. Even 
if you compressed it some, you would need 4 bits times 12 entries. 
This can be accomplished in much less, say an int from 0 to (12!-1), 
which would be mearly 29 bits.

So one way of doing this is to approach it mathematically:

The defiantion of the odd/even-ness is called the &quot;signature of a 
permutation&quot; and can be defined using the following:

Say f is your permutation (bijective) mapping, and let P
(x_0,...,x_11) := Product over i&lt;j of (x_i-x_j). For instance P
(x_0,x_1,x_2) = (x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)(x_1-x_2).

sgn(f) = P(f(x_0),...,f(x_11)) / P(x_0,...,x_11)

This will be -1 or 1, 1 being &quot;even&quot;, -1 being &quot;odd&quot;.

You can make a C function that is P, and just compute it this way, 
but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most efficent.

          <div class="email-content">Ill take a slightly less techinical approach than Doug did, but here&#x27;s
essentially the way I do it in blindsolving:

Your permutation can be written in disjoint cycle notation as: (0, 5,
8, 3), (1, 10), (2, 9, 4, 11, 6, 7)

where (a,b,c) means the thing in position a goes to position b, then
the thing in position b goes to position c, then the thing int
position c goes into position a, or a->b->c->a.

Any permutation can be written as the product of disjoint cycles, and
it&#x27;s very easy to determine the signature of a cycle like this.

If a cycle written in this manner has n elements (3 in my abc example)
then it takes n-1 transpositions to perform it.  Thus the signature of
the permuation is simply (n-1) mod 2, where 0 implies an even
permutation and 1 implies an odd permuation.  With the product of
disjoint cycles as your example, the overall signature is given by
summing the individual signatures and taking that mod 2.  So your
signature is (3+1+5) mod 2 = 9 mod 2 = 1 => odd permuatation.

Clear as mud yet?

At any rate I believe this method of testing to be more difficult to
implement in a program than Doug&#x27;s method.  Thought a different
perspective might help though.

  Side-note: First of all I recommend studing the ways that ACube 
  and/or CubeExplorer store this structure, becasue this obvious way 
  to do it turns out to be wasteful in the number of bits used. Even 
  if you compressed it some, you would need 4 bits times 12 entries. 
  This can be accomplished in much less, say an int from 0 to (12!-1), 
  which would be mearly 29 bits.

  So one way of doing this is to approach it mathematically:

  The defiantion of the odd/even-ness is called the &quot;signature of a 
  permutation&quot; and can be defined using the following:

  Say f is your permutation (bijective) mapping, and let P
  (x_0,...,x_11) := Product over i&lt;j of (x_i-x_j). For instance P
  (x_0,x_1,x_2) = (x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)(x_1-x_2).

  sgn(f) = P(f(x_0),...,f(x_11)) / P(x_0,...,x_11)

  This will be -1 or 1, 1 being &quot;even&quot;, -1 being &quot;odd&quot;.

  You can make a C function that is P, and just compute it this way, 
  but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most efficent.

I&#x27;ve usually done it by counting the crossed pairs, see Jaap&#x27;s page:
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/theory.htm#perms.

In Perl it could be something like this:

sub parity {
    my @array = @_;
    my $p = 0;
    for my $i (0 .. $length-1) {
        for my $j (0 .. $i-1) {
            $array[$j] > $array[$i] and $p = 1-$p } }
    $p }

It should be quite easy to understand even if you don&#x27;t know Perl, but
if you want it in some other language let me know.

          <div class="email-content">Hi again,

I uploaded the Perl subroutine below to
http://funktio.freehostia.com/parity.pl with proper formatting. If
you like more verbose style, see
http://funktio.freehostia.com/parity2.pl . If the server is down, wait
a while and try again.

In J, there&#x27;s a built-in primitive to get the parity of a permutation:

C.!.2 ] 5 10 9 0 11 8 7 2 3 4 1 6

Returns -1 (thanks to Doug I finally understand why it&#x27;s 1 and -1).
And if you want to get it in the cycle-notation, use

C. 5 10 9 0 11 8 7 2 3 4 1 6

and you get |8 3 0 5|10 1|11 6 7 2 9 4|

But I guess you are using less exotic languages. :)

That is for the cross. Hard to understand, but it&#x27;s one of the few web pages that actually explain cross very well.

F2L is based on intuition. Find algorithms only for those super hard cases.

&quot;Practice, practice, practice.&quot;

Not sure if this &quot;full cube in cube&quot; version was posted in this 
thread yet.

First do the following: U&#x27; L2 F2 D&#x27; L&#x27; D U2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R2 U F&#x27; L&#x27; U 
R&#x27;. Now do the following &quot;2x2x2 cube in cube&quot;:

(Rr)(Uu)&#x27;(Rr)(Ff)(Uu)2(Rr)2(Ff)&#x27;(Uu)&#x27;(Rr)(Ff)&#x27;

1 turn cancels to give 26 totally!!

Have a third party in the audience either record people&#x27;s times (and <br>

Have each competitor hold a secondary timesheet that they are to <br>

assign each competitor a different competitor randomly, and have <br>

Have every event recorded in it&#x27;s entirety by a video camera. This <br>

          <div class="email-content">For Belgian Open, I prepare all timesheets for each event in a different
enveloppe.

When a round starts, I open the enveloppe and I call the competitors so that
they bring their puzzles.
When a competitor has finished 5 solves, the sheet is returned to the
scoretaker (=the guy behind the computer) and after encoding the times, the
scoretaker has to put the enveloppe back in the enveloppe immediately.

When all times are recorded, the enveloppe is closed using a simple sticking
band (&#x27;scotch&#x27; ??).

So if a competitor says his times are not encoded correctly, opening the
right enveloppe is enough to find the scoresheet.

I suppose I should work out an entire answer but I can quickly offer
advice about a useful first step toward a solution. If you rewrite
your permutation as a set of disjoint cycles it is much easier to
answer if it is an even or odd permutation. In your example the cycles
would be:

 (0 5 8 3)(1 10)(2 9 4 11 6 7)

The lengths of the cycles determine the answer.

          <div class="email-content">Do you know what happened when your results were left out? If so,
please share. Was a time sheet actually lost? Was your name left off
the competition spreadsheet? Was it just an error in copying the data
over? I think knowing that information would be helpful in making
useful improvements.

I think the current system for recording times as outlined in the WCA
regulations works pretty well as it is, especially when you consider
that thousands of results have been recorded this way, and errors like
what happened to your results are quite rare. Caltech has been using
color coded time sheets (we&#x27;ve done it before anyway. I wasn&#x27;t present
at Caltech Summer) which makes organization easier, and as long as all
the competitors have a name entry in the spreadsheet, we know when all
times have been entered.

But keeping all the time sheets together in a box or envelope right
after entering them is a good idea. It&#x27;s more organized and secure
than just a pile by Mark&#x27;s computer, and wouldn&#x27;t require extensive
restructuring of competition logistics.

I don&#x27;t know about you, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to go through hundreds of
photos or hours of video to find a lost result. With our current
system, it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary. And have you met anyone who could
identify names/faces of every competitor at a competition?

Having competitors maintain backup records is right out. Competitors
don&#x27;t handle time sheets or any other record keeping, period. That&#x27;s
the whole point of having judges as opposed to people reporting their
own times.

Also, let the competitors know they can&#x27;t take their time sheets after
the end of the competition anymore. It&#x27;s not as common as it was in
the past, but some people, e.g. first time cubers like to take their
time sheets as a souvenir (or sometimes even other people&#x27;s time
sheets, to sell on eBay).

          <div class="email-content">Ya, the taking and keeping of timesheets is a bad idea, but it was so 
popular back in, say the WC03 days.

But I was trying to open up a fairly general discussion, I&#x27;ve already 
accepted the lost of my times. I don&#x27;t want it about me.

Now speaking of Mark... There was no MARK! It was his birthday I 
guess. Oh and it was Brittney&#x27;s too. Two ppl that didn&#x27;t show up that 
I was expecting to. I think that if mark was there things would have 
gone much smoother.

all the cards are (or maybe two people, in case one gets tired or

dimensionless and has no length.  Most of the problems were phrased <br>
something like this &quot;What is the probability that a randomly selected <br>
point on AC will be on segment BC?&quot;  These we did as (length of <br>
segment BC)/(length of segment AC) and got 5/9 for this particular <br>
problem.<br>
<br>
However for the question &quot;What is the probability that a randomly <br>

approach this the same way?<br>
<br>
(length of the intersection of segments BC and AB) / (length of <br>

<br>
I chose zero for the length of the intersection because the <br>
intersection is a point with 0 dimension.<br>

Does it make sense that the probability is 0 for something like <br>
this?  What I find interesting is that it is possible in choosing a <br>
point on segment BC that you choose the point B.  But considering the <br>
infinite number of possible points to pick this probability would <br>
seem to tend toward 0, but always be a positive number since the <br>

<br>
So I can convince myself that this probability *is* zero and that it <br>
*tends to* 0 but I don&#x27;t know which it actually is.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,

Indeed, the probability should be zero.  The intersection of AB and BC
is indeed only point B.  Therefore, if we select a point at random on
BC, only if it is point B will it be on AB.  Otherwise, it is not on
AB.  Since a line (or even any line segment that is not a single
point) consists of infinitely many points, the probability is
(one/infinity).  However, though you would expect a positive number,
it is so small (infinitesimal) that it is zero.  You could think of it
sort of as the limit of 1/x as x approaches positive infinity.

Seems like I do it almost identically, just looping in opposite
direction. I got the idea from

Isn&#x27;t bool C++?

TIMTOWTDI as always, I use &#x27;s = s-1&#x27;.

          <div class="email-content">I like the simplicity of Herbert&#x27;s routine. It doesn&#x27;t need to make a
copy of the array (or allocate storage for such an array), and the
code is quite compact. However, if by &quot;most efficient,&quot; you mean
fastest execution, it appears from my own unbiased :-) test, that my
routine is faster. While both our routines have similar nested for
loops, note that my inner loop generally gets &quot;short-circuited&quot; by the
break statement or possibly skipped entirely due to the continue
statement. So although my routine has the extra code to clone a copy
of the array, the savings in fewer inner loop executions more than
makes up for it.

While in my routine I used the ^= operator as Doug also suggests, I
personally don&#x27;t like to mix int and bool types the way Doug suggests.
A C# compiler won&#x27;t even compile such code. A bool would be more
properly complemented using the ! operator. And bool was in C++ first
(although a rather late feature of C++), and was in neither K&amp;R C nor
the original ANSI C. A Wikipedia article talks about a new C
&quot;standard&quot; referred to as C99 that supports &quot;bool&quot; through including a
stdbool.h header file.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

This technique is pretty useful for someone of your speed who is
trying to get a bit faster. But I would just like to give a view from
the perspective of a sub 15 cuber. I almost always see a corner and
then look for an edge, simply because the corners are more obvious
with their cross colour sticker. But simply focussing on the corner
may limit your speed in the F2L because you may choose moves which are
more difficult to execute than is necessary.

Take for example (do this on a solved cube) R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 F&#x27; U F U

Now, if you are focussing on corners you would probably solve the pair
 in this cumbersome way... something like U y&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; y R U R&#x27;.
However, if you are focussing on edges in this case you may well do U2
 R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; which is much more elegant.

With more experience you will be able to get around this by learning
more techniques or algorithms per F2L case. Most of it is just a
matter of practise, so what I am meaning to say is that focussing on
one group of pieces is fine for now, but don&#x27;t make it a permanent
habit if you want to be sub 20 or faster. And also, with practise you
will start to be able to see more pieces at the same time, and choose
the best pair to solve. Once you are able to start doing this, you
will see a big improvement in your times. A big part of it is having
the F2L algorithms become totally mechanical, so you can devote 100%
of your brain &quot;resources&quot; to looking ahead for the next pair. This is
one of the reasons why I am against learning an intuitive F2L as
opposed to learning a set of algorithms, I personally think that with
intuitive F2L it takes much much longer to become completely &quot;F2L
mechanical&quot;, and therefore will hold you back in your progress for
longer than necessary.

Why rotate the cube? Even if I saw just the corner first, I&#x27;d do U&#x27; R
U R&#x27; U R U R&#x27;.

A fewest moves type of cuber like me might think that F2 U&#x27; L&#x27; U L F2
is even more elegant. :)

          <div class="email-content">Well stated. Indeed not only does every finite set of numbers have measure zero but even some infinite sets, like the rational numbers, also has measure zero. Rigorous discussions of this topic are at the level of measure theory which is customarily a graduate level course for math majors. Rather advanced for grades 2 - 12 but it is a good idea to approach these ideas intuitively as well. But it is probably better to stick with the probability of zero rather than infinitesimal.

          <div class="email-content">I have a friend who has a keychain cube that, unlubed, turns really
well.  I can solve it in under 25 seconds.

So to answer the question, some keychain cubes turn really well and
some don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s the same with regular Rubik&#x27;s cubes although I think
a good keychain cube is more rare (but they exist).

          <div class="email-content">I am interested in these larger cubes, and I planned to buy them when
they are released, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be willing to spend $2000 on
one! That price is simply outrageous!! If that&#x27;s what they are going to
cost, then Doug might be the only person keen enough to purchase one. ;)
Even if they were hundreds, rather than thousands, I still doubt many
people would buy them. If a 5x5x5 is significantly under $100 (e.g.
$US30 on rubiks.com), then I would expect the 6x6x6 and 7x7x7 to be
under $100 as well.

          <div class="email-content">I honestly didn&#x27;t believe for a moment that the big cubes would cost
anything like $2000. However, I did believe there was a chance that Doug
was willing to spend a rather large sum on the 7x7x7 if it meant getting
one right now instead of whenever they are eventually release!! Hmmm...
I guess that this means either Doug is really really obsessed by big
cubes, or just that I believed him to be really really obsessed by big
cube! ;)

          <div class="email-content">Correction. It was given to him directly from the creator, no ebay.

So the only thing I exaggerated was &quot;swiftly [rejected]&quot;.

There are like five or six 7&#x27;s in existance. It&#x27;s nice how Frank has 
what three? Well I would have never made an offer to Frank, that is 
such an insult I&#x27;m sure. But I don&#x27;t see anything preventing him 
from actually selling one if he really wanted to.

Though conversely, if I had one I wouldn&#x27;t sell it.

I kind of think of they are cute. I always have loved miniaturizations that
actually work. While they do have a higher liability to pop, you eventually
learn to handle it so it doesn&#x27;t. And yes, the stickers suck. But there are
many things you could use to replace them, like colored electrician&#x27;s tape,
or even epoxy or nail polish if you want to be really steady handed. (Does
anyone know how durable good nail polish is?)

If you decide to paint, you will have to deal with the hole in all the
center pieces, just one shortcut they took with cubes this small.

The second cube I converted into an octagonal barrel was a &quot;middle size&quot;
cube an inch across. I&#x27;ve had thoughts of converting one of the keychain
sized ones to a barrel.

I haven&#x27;t faced such a problem, but I wonder if it would help to add
some glue to the tip of the screw before screwing it to the core, so
that it wouldn&#x27;t loosen up so easily.

&quot;Push Finger-trick&quot; - a sequence of three moves which take the form a<br>

The push and pull come from Ian Winokur&#x27;s terms in Team Blindfold cubing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Overlap Insertion&quot; - an insertion which overlaps pieces of the same<br>
colour. For example, if there was a yellow sticker at UR, and one at<br>
FR, the FR piece could be inserted into the U layer by R U R&#x27;,<br>
overlapping the yellow piece at UR. A non overlap insert would be F&#x27; U&#x27; F.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m going to have to say no to the first two. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be 
a good idea to ever name those. But if I *must* I would use &quot;roll&quot; 
and &quot;push&quot; or perhaps post-fixed with &quot;-trigger&quot; (respectively). 
Thus out useage of &quot;push&quot; would be contradictory and hence 
confusing. I predict a similar nitpick from team BLD stuff.

I also like the word &quot;flick&quot; for xy&#x27;x&#x27;y stuff.

As for the 3rd one, I&#x27;m not clear on what you mean. When you 
say &quot;insertion&quot; do you mean c/e-pair insertions?

          <div class="email-content">Agreeing with Dan. If that is a view from some 45 deg-ish angle 
looking at two adjoining faces... then you have two *identical wing 
pieces*. They would belong to the same spot when solved, hence not 
possible. So either someone fiddled with your stickers to get it 
that way, or you made a typo somewhere.

I perform the U in R U R&#x27; as a push with my right index finger.<br>
<br>
Maybe it is because I am not a native English speaker, but pulling to me means &quot;positioned before the object and then moving it in a forward motion&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t seem possible to me on a cube unless you would put glue on your fingers.<br>

<br>
<br>
  I would like to propose a couple of new terms which I can&#x27;t see<br>
  defined anywhere (checking Macky&#x27;s glossary and at least a few other<br>
  sources).<br>
<br>
  &quot;Push Finger-trick&quot; - a sequence of three moves which take the form a<br>
  b&#x27; a, ie side a is turned, then side b is turned in the opposite<br>
  direction, and then side a is turned back. eg R U&#x27; R&#x27;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Pull Finger-trick&quot; - a sequence of three moves which take the form a<br>
  b a&#x27;, ie side a is turned, then side b is turned in the same<br>
  direction, and then side a is turned back. eg R U R&#x27;<br>
<br>
  The push and pull come from Ian Winokur&#x27;s terms in Team Blindfold cubing.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Overlap Insertion&quot; - an insertion which overlaps pieces of the same<br>
  colour. For example, if there was a yellow sticker at UR, and one at<br>
  FR, the FR piece could be inserted into the U layer by R U R&#x27;,<br>
  overlapping the yellow piece at UR. A non overlap insert would be F&#x27; U&#x27; F.<br>
<br>
  If nobody has any problems with these, I will use them on my site.<br>
<br>
  Thanks,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, the fingertrick isn&#x27;t all 3 moves.  In R U R&#x27;, the real
fingertrick is U R&#x27;.  in R U&#x27; R&#x27;, the fingertrick would be R U&#x27;.

On an alg like R U R&#x27;, you only cut one of the two corners, if that
makes sense.  You only cut corners on the R U transition, not on the U
R&#x27; transition.

Push and Pull make sense, but the fingertricks themselves are always
the same direction.

Well actually... maybe it&#x27;s your preception of the term &quot;finger

          <div class="email-content">I think you both have points:

Arnaud, I can see where you are coming from, For example, if you did
just R, it would be exactly the same as the R in R U R&#x27;. Hence the
only &quot;trick&quot; is the U R&#x27;. But for me, a finger-trick is a sequence of
moves that can be performed fluently without pauses, although having
tried it out on my cube it seems there are a lot more possible finger
tricks than I ever imagined.

Doug, you seem to think the same way I do. For instance, I believe
that (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*infinity is a finger trick :)

it looks correct on the quoting of it below, must be a Yahoo forum 
issue.

So if I where to get to this point with having 3 layers solved, I 
would apply 3x3 algs to solve the corners and get as much of the 
edges in the right spot as you can.

Start out with a Y-Perm or V-Perm to get the CP right.

You should be able to form a pair using 2 or more 3-wing cycles. I 
assume you can do those since you got to this point.

Actually the easiest thing to do to finish pairing the wings up, is 
to do some good old r/D conjugation moves. Like (r&#x27;D2r-U&#x27;-r&#x27;D2r-U-
r&#x27;D2r) = blah and do (blah)-U2-(blah)-U2.

As for the &quot;orientation parity&quot;... you&#x27;ll probably want an alg. 
Here&#x27;s one that Hardwick came up with: r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r 
F2 l&#x27; B2 r2. It swaps the two wings on UF slots.

I made a quick figure in MSPaint and what you want is nothing more 
than a double edge swap. You can place the edges into same layer 
first like so: R D2 L2 (assuming the red centers=U and green 
centers=F.

Now the easiest to understand fix would be:
R&#x27; L&#x27; u2 R L U R&#x27; L&#x27; u2 R L U&#x27;

however (Ll)2 f2 (Ll)2 U (Ll)2 f2 (Ll)2 U&#x27; is more efficient.

Then simply undo the setup moves like so: L2 D2 R&#x27;

Both ways are just a conjugated commutator in technical terms.

(u is the inner layer just below U and f the inner layer just behind 
F. I use block notation:(Ll)2=L2 l2)

Is that supposed to be an legitimate excuse? Most cubing world 
records are held by a 14 year old.

          <div class="email-content">Your welcome. And one is never too young or too old to learn new 
things about the cube. Good luck, I hope you try and work out a few 
things on your own now. Why would I be annoyed?

Btw, refrain from changing the subject line in this forum. (I think it 
confuses stuff like those that use gmail.)

Everybody seems to have their own definition, for example see message
#37169: http://tinyurl.com/2y3hup

I wouldn&#x27;t consider executing all those moves a single finger trick,
but maybe that&#x27;s just me.

Then he doesn&#x27;t know the complete method. You may have the same 
problem with other methods if you dont learn all the 
steps/exceptional cases. It&#x27;s NOT a method problem if he cannot 
always solve them layer by layer ;-)

<br>
I just finished uploading my 4x4x4 stuff to my website, it is more or<br>
less complete now so you can learn all about the 3x3x3 reduction<br>
method for solving the cube (which is quite topical at the moment).<br>

          <div class="email-content">When I devised the original keyboard layout for the cube simulator, I<br>
intentionally left out keys for B/B&#x27; with the assumption that, in<br>
physical solving, we would rotate the cube towards us slightly anyway<br>
before performing B/B&#x27;. Such moves could therefore be simulated by<br>
performing a cube rotation followed by U/U&#x27;.<br>
<br>
Several people have expressed their discomfort with the lack of B/B&#x27;,<br>
while some have even made good arguments for adding B/B&#x27;, including<br>
that it would, by consequence, also allow you to perform f/f&#x27; (using<br>
B/B&#x27; simultaneously with a cube rotation in the opposite direction).<br>
<br>
Mainly, I am writing this email to find out what fingers speed cubists<br>
use, on real cubes, when performing B/B&#x27;. Joel van Noort wrote to me<br>
in December 2006 that he uses his ring fingers to perform B/B&#x27; and<br>
suggested that I therefore map the &quot;W&quot; and &quot;O&quot; keys to B and B&#x27;.<br>
<br>
Are there any other suggestions? I am willing to consider reserving<br>
two pairs of keys for this to support the two different ways our<br>
wrists can turn to access the B face.<br>

 Actually you now see where bladez740 is coming from. He is the one<br>
that said only the UR&#x27; would be the finger-trick.  <br>
<br>
 I perform and actually &quot;think&quot; of RUR&#x27; and RU&#x27;R as 1 move. Mostly<br>
this is because I use keyhole and I use those type of 3 moves<br>
constantly to insert the first 3 corners after the cross and also for<br>
the 4 middle layer edges.  <br>
<br>
 I am still having trouble with the word pull. Can somebody tell me<br>
if my understanding of this word is wrong or otherwise explain to me<br>
why that fingertrick would be called the pull..... My interpretation<br>
of the word pull once more &quot;positioned before the object and then<br>
moving it in a forward motion&quot;. I think of tractor-pulling for this<br>
where the tractor (finger) is ahead of the heavy object (cube) and<br>
tries to move away from it.<br>

 I think you both have points:<br>
 Arnaud, I can see where you are coming from, For example, if you did<br>
 just R, it would be exactly the same as the R in R<br>
U R&#x27;. Hence the<br>
 only &quot;trick&quot; is the U R&#x27;. But for me, a finger-trick is a sequence<br>
of<br>
 moves that can be performed fluently without pauses, although having<br>
 tried it out on my cube it seems there are a lot more possible<br>
finger<br>
 tricks than I ever imagined.<br>
 Doug, you seem to think the same way I do. For instance, I believe<br>
 that (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*infinity is a finger trick :)<br>

 &gt; I can&#x27;t imagine a real speedcuber thinking that way! I finger<br>
trick <br>

 &gt; conclude you are not a &quot;real speedcuber&quot; :).<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Well actually... maybe it&#x27;s your preception of the term &quot;finger <br>
 &gt; trick&quot;. But I totally diagree with you on this.<br>

 &gt; &gt; Well, the fingertrick isn&#x27;t all 3 moves. In R U R&#x27;, the real<br>
 &gt; &gt; fingertrick is U R&#x27;. in R U&#x27; R&#x27;, the fingertrick would be R U&#x27;.<br>
 &gt; &gt;<br>
<br>
 &gt; &gt; On an alg like R U R&#x27;, you only cut one of the two corners, if<br>
that<br>
 &gt; &gt; makes sense. You only cut corners on the R U transition, not on <br>
 &gt; the U<br>
 &gt; &gt; R&#x27; transition.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Push and Pull make sense, but the fingertricks themselves are <br>
 &gt; always<br>
 &gt; &gt; the same direction.<br>

 &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Push Finger-trick&quot; - a sequence of three moves which take the<br>

 &gt; &gt; &gt; b&#x27; a, ie side a is turned, then side b is turned in the<br>
opposite<br>

 &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Pull Finger-trick&quot; - a sequence of three moves which take the<br>
<br>
 &gt; form a<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; b a&#x27;, ie side a is turned, then side b is turned in the same<br>

 &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; The push and pull come from Ian Winokur&#x27;s terms in Team<br>
Blindfold<br>

 &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Overlap Insertion&quot; - an insertion which overlaps pieces of<br>
the <br>
 &gt; same<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; colour. For example, if there was a yellow sticker at UR, and <br>
 &gt; one at<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; FR, the FR piece could be inserted into the U layer by R U R&#x27;,<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; overlapping the yellow piece at UR. A non overlap insert would<br>
<br>
 &gt; be F&#x27;<br>
 &gt; &gt; U&#x27; F.<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; If nobody has any problems with these, I will use them on my <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan,

It&#x27;s cool that you remember this e-mail I sent you.

I&#x27;d like to add that, when thinking about it again, I realised that 
on some algs I also use my middle finger to do B&#x27;.. Like, there is 
one OLL alg (P shaped) that starts with RUB&#x27;, and doing the B&#x27; with 
a middle finger makes it a lot quicker (copied it from LarsV). So I 
guess the e and i keys would also make sense, maybe. But I would be 
interested to see what the rest of the community thinks.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :)

I have to correct my previous post. I was rushed when i gave the 
solution to that position. It&#x27;s not correct. The actual solution is 
like so (Yellow=U,Green=F):

L&#x27; R - (Rr)2 b2 (Rr)2 U (Rr)2 b2 (Rr)2 U&#x27; - R&#x27; L (12-btm)

Still a fairly simple conjugate...

Cheers!!

          <em>From:</em> d_funny007 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Wed, 05 Sep 2007 23:38:39 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">So I just opened a package from SPeedstacks. My old timer has been <br>
failing on me, frequently it just goes crazy and loops though a <br>
bunch of 0s, then 1s, 2&#x27;s etc.<br>
<br>
The new timer has a feature to keep track of date and time of day <br>
even while &quot;off&quot;. I find this handy. There are 2 added buttons, and <br>
I can see how from an electronics point of view how easily it could <br>
be to incorporate soemthign like that. The plastic is much more of a <br>
brighter metalic blue than my other. The output jack is shiny metal <br>
instead of black plastic (this I know increases the cost of <br>
materials), that minor improvement makes me happy for some reason.<br>
<br>
The stack mats themselves (over-sized mouse pads) now come in a <br>
variety of colorful designs, I got the &quot;bubble one&quot;. I was a bit <br>
disappointed in that they are nwo half the thickness I was <br>
accustomed to, say from Gen 1 days, but it rolls up much nicer this <br>
way, and I appreciate the thick cardboard cyclinder they use for <br>
packaging, and am keeping.... perhaps drill some holes in it to <br>
attach some rubberbands to turn into a DIY ping pong ball holder!<br>
<br>
The Large Tournment Display itself, is now round/oval (as we all <br>
know), but to a suprise, I found no power cord! They are now only <br>
powered by EIGHT D-cell batteries that do not come supplied (I will <br>
be making a trip to the supermarket forthat and lube soon). This I <br>
find rather unacceptable, why 8? And why D-cell? C-would be more <br>
convienent and easier to find in stores.<br>
<br>
Anotehr beef I have is that the instructions aren&#x27;t explicit about <br>
how to mount the post to a table... although it wasn&#x27;t hard to <br>
figure out. I find it as an oversight. The post itself is not only a <br>
single short stick. It&#x27;s barely higher than my monitors right now. <br>
The height is not at all adjustable. They used to be two piece, but <br>
I guess they wanted to make a bigger profit? Well they claim the <br>
decision was made for &quot;stablity reasons&quot; which I&#x27;m not quite <br>
believing.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s just taller than 7 cubes high (so like 7 times 2.25 inches plus <br>
oh a half inch and whatever that is in metric units). I suppose this <br>
is okay, but if it was a big audience, you would certainly want it <br>
to stick up nice and high above the crowd I&#x27;m sure.<br>
<br>
Oh almost forgot to mention, the timer can also save 3 times in a <br>
memory (technically 4 if you count what is on the main display). <br>
This was made to correspond to 3-3-3, 3-6-3, and Cycle tiems in the <br>
world of cupstacking of though. It can easily be adapted for my use <br>
of storing 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 times :).<br>
<br>
Cost for timer, mat, and display? Around $138 USD after taxes. So <br>
not bad, but I expected more from their tournment displays. I hope <br>
this Review helps ppl come to a decision on wheather or not to buy <br>
this stuff. ANd if other cubers here have opinions on these items to <br>
share, please do.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I use my right ring finger for a B&#x27; in a BLD alg (and actually use my <br>
right pinky for B in that same alg), and have always wondered why <br>
those <br>
two keys (&quot;W&quot; and &quot;O&quot;) that are so conveniently in place don&#x27;t do <br>
anything. They would aid in speed and accuracy.<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;d vote for M&#x27; on &quot;.&quot; because I use my right ring finger for <br>
it. <br>
I suppose &quot;X&quot; would work for others, and they should both work that <br>
way <br>
if this is to mimic real handling.<br>
I&#x27;m not sure if M should go anywhere, then... &quot;C&quot; and &quot;,&quot; ?<br>
<br>
Another idea I&#x27;m entertaining is the replacement of Rc on &quot;Y&quot; with M&#x27; <br>
and Lc on &quot;B&quot; with M. The redundant cube turns are then only covered <br>
by <br>
the closer hand.<br>
<br>
Would it be too much work to make the keymap configurable?<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I like B/B&#x27; on &quot;W&quot;/&quot;O,&quot; and think that there should at least <br>
be <br>
an M&#x27;.<br>

<br>
Yes, to me also, R B R&#x27; &quot;feels like&quot; R U R&#x27; after a slight cube rotation.<br>
<br>
On the simulator, it can be performed (Rc&#x27; R) U (Rc R&#x27;) or<br>
equivalently l U l&#x27; since l/l&#x27; are directly supported.<br>
<br>
&gt; The exact way would depend on the turn done before the B/B&#x27; ...<br>
<br>
True, I can personally see three ways to perform B/B&#x27; depending on the<br>
previous move:<br>
<br>
1) index finger: probably the previous move is R? If so, I think we<br>
don&#x27;t need a special key for it, since RUR&#x27; can be performed lUl&#x27; as<br>
suggested above.<br>
<br>
2) thumb: probably the previous move is L&#x27;? e.g. L&#x27;BL. To be<br>
consistent, I will not support this since I do not support thumb push<br>
moves anywhere else either. For example, L&#x27;UL must be performed by<br>
switching hands, and using the index finger of the opposite hand to<br>
pull rather than using the same hand to thumb-push. I think people got<br>
used to scheme this rather quickly, it was just necessary to make best<br>
use of the keys available.<br>
<br>
3) ring finger: probably the previous move is L? This finger trick was<br>
completely new to me, but there is a nice symmetry about adding it:<br>
the index finger is wired up to U and F, while the ring finger is<br>
wired up to D and B. The other combinations are then supported using a<br>
cube rotation in either direction.<br>
<br>
I think this nice symmetry also corresponds, in a pragmatic way, to<br>
the degrees to which our wrists can comfortably twist in any one<br>
direction. (1) is quite a contortion without a cube rotation, whereas<br>
(3) is much easier to reach without a cube rotation.<br>
<br>
Another goal here was to be able to support f/f&#x27; (double-layer turns),<br>
and the direction of the wrist twist in (3) seems to match the way<br>
wrists would twist to support f/f&#x27;.<br>
<br>
So my current thought is to just add (3) and not (1) or (2).<br>
<br>

Pedro wrote:<br>
<br>
&gt; PS.: you could add M moves too :p<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t do that Dave :-) To explain, there was a principle that I<br>
followed when designing the movement engine inside the simulator:<br>
<br>
    Each finger press simulates what a finger press can do<br>
    on a real cube.<br>
<br>
There are some moves on a real cube that actually involve pressing<br>
multiple fingers simultaneously, and M is one of those. If you just<br>
press M by itself, what actually happens is r&#x27;. So if you want to<br>
force R back to its home position, you actually need to press r&#x27; and R<br>
simultaneously.<br>
<br>
As well as having a justification in mimicking the physical world,<br>
this has other advantages:<br>
<br>
- It allows the player to learn only a small set of primitive keys,<br>
which can be intuitively combined to perform more complex moves.<br>
- Since there are only a limited number of keys available on the<br>
keyboard and it is not possible to assign a key for every possible<br>
finger trick, this scheme is actually the secret to making the<br>
keyboard controls fit on a keyboard.<br>

I will do this eventually, since it will also address the issue of<br>
using the simulator on non-QWERTY keyboards.<br>
<br>
However, there is a lot of infrastructure that needs to be set in<br>
place before this can happen (accounts/logins/preferences), and I<br>
don&#x27;t quite have the time for this just yet ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

When are we going to get a consensus as to what cube rotation 
notation to use?

The notations that i can remember just now are:

1 - x,y,z notation as explained here >> 
http://www.speedcubing.com/moves.html

2 - Prefix notation (Q) QR, QR2, QR&#x27; etc...

3 - Postfix notation (C or c) Rc, R2c, R&#x27;c etc ... or also i have 
seen Rc2, Rc&#x27; ...

As i have mentioned many times i think notation is a task for the 
WCA. In other federations/sports there is official &quot;notation&quot; or 
metrics. Like using meter not foot, kg not lb. Etc... The longer we 
go on without an official complete notation the more variations we 
are going to develop, and reading algorithms becomes very confusing, 
unless the sites/books care to explain the notation being used.

(Inner slice turns also have differing notations. As well as block 
moves.)

One idea would be to have websites officially approved by the WCA if 
they follow official notation fully ;-) I guess most serious sites 
would like to be approved :D >>> uniformity

My recurring thoughts,

like: (LD2L&#x27;F&#x27;D2F)=blah and to do things like (blah)(U^n)(blah)&#x27;(U^n)&#x27;.

What I do in practice is (Sune)(mirrored Sune) or the inverse.

Reading your post... I think you have CO confused with soemthing else, 
that looks a bit like the 6-edge flip alg that is somtimes used but it 
is x5. It looks a bit like the alg for two 2-corner cycles too.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

A poor mans solution to orienting corners is to actually rotate 
them &quot;in situ&quot; with short algs. Not using 3-cycles for orientation 
purposes. This also lessens the burden of keeping track of 
permutation but makes for longer solutions.

A corner can be twisted with for example:

R&#x27; D2 R F D2 F&#x27; (ccw) or
R&#x27; D R F D F&#x27; (cw)

Use this to twist 2 corners like so (example):

R&#x27; D R F D F&#x27; U F D&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27; (alg + U + alg backwards + U&#x27;)

Using these short algs is not very good for cases where you have to 
twist 3 corners.

In such cases one can use:

(R&#x27; D&#x27; R D)*2 or (D&#x27; R&#x27; D R)*2 to twist each of the corners, the rest 
of the cube will be restored. Example:

(R&#x27; D&#x27; R D)*2 U (R&#x27; D&#x27; R D)*2 U (R&#x27; D&#x27; R D)*2 U2

The concept(s) should be easy to understand.

 I can&#x27;t do that Dave :-) To explain, there was a principle that I
 followed when designing the movement engine inside the simulator:
 
 Each finger press simulates what a finger press can do
     on a real cube.
 
 There are some moves on a real cube that actually involve pressing
 multiple fingers simultaneously, and M is one of those. If you just
 press M by itself, what actually happens is r&#x27;. So if you want to
 force R back to its home position, you actually need to press r&#x27; and R
 simultaneously.
 
 As well as having a justification in mimicking the physical world,
 this has other advantages:
 
 - It allows the player to learn only a small set of primitive keys,
 which can be intuitively combined to perform more complex moves.
 - Since there are only a limited number of keys available on the
 keyboard and it is not possible to assign a key for every possible
 finger trick, this scheme is actually the secret to making the
 keyboard controls fit on a keyboard.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I have been tutoring math through a franchise company called <br>
Mathnasium for almost a year and a half now.  You can see their <br>
website at www.mathnasium.com<br>
<br>
Anyway I have noticed a fascinating, to me, trend in the way most <br>
every student answers one particular type of question on one of our <br>
assessment tests.<br>
<br>
There are 2 questions on our middle school test that ask to order <br>
fractional amounts from least to greatest.<br>
<br>
What fascinates me is that close to 95% of all students who take the <br>
test miss this question, and I&#x27;d say 80% of those in the same manner.<br>
<br>
The first question has decimals from 0 to 2 to be put in order from <br>
least to greatest.  Below is an example:<br>
2 0.04 1 0.35 0.96 0 0.75<br>
<br>
Most students, even many extremely bright students(!), answer like <br>
this:<br>
0.04 0.35 0.75 0.96 0 1 2<br>
<br>
Also there is a second question asking them to order fractions:<br>
2/5 9/10 1 1/16 0 3/4 2<br>
<br>
Most students, again even some of our brightest math minds(!), answer <br>
like this:<br>
1/16 2/5 3/4 9/10 0 1 2<br>
<br>
What fascinates me is that they all place any fractional amount to be <br>
less than 0, yet still non-negative.<br>
<br>
Again I know this post probably makes our students out to sound dumb, <br>
but many students who miss this question in this manner have <br>
excellent problem solving skills and often then have very good <br>
computational skills and accuracy.<br>
<br>
I am fascinated by this because I have seen students who struggle in <br>
math, as well as extremely bright students, answer this problem the <br>
very same way.  Does anyone know what is going on here from a <br>
developmental standpoint?  Most of these kids are aged 11-13 who are <br>
missing this question in this way.  I know this age group is when <br>
abstract thinking begins to develop.  But is the order type of the <br>
reals an abstract concept?  It seems to make sense, but then again <br>
I&#x27;ve been working with numbers for so long perhaps I&#x27;ve forgotten any <br>
struggles I went through at that age to develop a concept of the way <br>
the real numbers are ordered.<br>
<br>
I would be very interested in any feedback, as I find the topic of <br>
mathematical development fascinating, particularly in this one area <br>
where I&#x27;ve seen so many students miss this question, and nearly all <br>
in the same manner!<br>

(Granted, it&#x27;s a bit more expensive now...)

So it&#x27;s not like Mefferts never restocks anything.

&gt;<br>
&gt;Each finger press simulates what a finger press can do<br>
&gt;on a real cube.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;There are some moves on a real cube that actually involve pressing<br>
&gt;multiple fingers simultaneously, and M is one of those. If you just<br>
&gt;press M by itself, what actually happens is r&#x27;. So if you want to<br>
&gt;force R back to its home position, you actually need to press r&#x27; and R<br>
&gt;simultaneously.<br>
<br>
I really don&#x27;t think of it as forcing R back simultaneously:<br>

http://archive.garron.us/vid/temp/Arne.mp4<br>
The center slice just moves...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve probably lost some records on the simulator because I pressed the wrong<br>
keys for M&#x27;...<br>

<br>
Although you may not think of it that way, I was not trying to design<br>
the interface around a logical conception of moves, but rather a<br>
physical simulation of moves based on the notion of &quot;finger presses&quot;.<br>
Indeed, watching your video, M involves more finger presses than U. To<br>
become more aware of this, imagine trying to perform M one-handed. You<br>
will quickly see that extra fingers are needed to press on extra stickers.<br>
<br>
It is these finger presses that I am trying to simulate, and that is<br>
the whole basis for the design of the simulator.<br>
<br>
Perhaps customisable keyboard layouts should be the next thing on the<br>
todo list... Each finger will still correspond to what can be achieved<br>
by a single finger press, but I suspect there may exist layouts better<br>
suited to different methods. (Maybe, even, I should have mapped r&#x27; as<br>
an index finger pull move)<br>
<br>
But for now, the sequence MUMU would be performed on the simulator<br>
using (MI)J(MI)J where (MI) can be pressed simultaneously with the<br>
thumb and middle finger, then followed by the index finger to execute<br>
U. That seems to be a rather fluid motion.<br>
<br>
Watching your video, it almost seems as though &quot;X&quot; should be mapped to<br>
 r, and that would assist slice moves in the reverse direction.<br>

=).  I am a dvorak typer as well.<br>
<br>
I would definitely recommend colemak before deciding on dvorak.  From<br>
the looks of it, it seems to be more efficent, but even /less/<br>
compatible with computers that don&#x27;t have the internet.<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;re a programmer, I would suggest colemak over dvorak (even<br>
though I haven&#x27;t tried colemak), because it doesn&#x27;t mess around with<br>
the punctuation as much as dvorak does.<br>
<br>
I think sometime this year I&#x27;m going to give colemak a try, and see<br>
which one I like better.<br>

&gt; i have concidered chaning to dvorak but wont the keys be messed up so <br>
&gt; in games that us WASD controls be all wird?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;   <br>
Sure. That&#x27;s a problem. I disable Dvorak mode for such kinds of games.<br>
I still suffer from WASD, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t play that kind of<br>
game very often.<br>
<br>
I have been a Dvorak typist for more than 20 years.<br>
I needed a month or two before being able to play NetHack diagonal move.<br>
Now I have no problem with hjkluybn.<br>
It&#x27;s just a training like OLL or PLL. You can get used to.<br>

First try: 104wpm (on QWERTY). Fun!<br>
<br>
I was once addicted to the dvorak concept... But as with James, I<br>
found it a terrible layout for typing UNIX commands and eventually<br>
switched back to QWERTY.<br>

<br>
WOW!!!!!!<br>
<br>
That layout is actually very good.<br>
<br>
http://colemak.com/Compare<br>
<br>
Colemak not only performs well on standard English text, but it<br>
performs *exceptionally* well on UNIX commands:<br>
<br>
QWERTY same hand: 46.88%<br>
QWERTY same finger: 9.76%<br>
<br>
Colemak same hand: 17.28%<br>
Colemak same finger: 3.2%<br>
<br>
Dvorak same hand: 49.76%<br>
Dvorak same finger: 10.56%<br>
<br>
The statistic that interests me most is &quot;same finger&quot; repetition, and<br>
even on standard english text Colemak outperforms Dvorak and QWERTY in<br>
this respect. Colemak sacrifices some hand alternation to achieve<br>
this, but even then, it is only a negligible sacrifice for a huge benefit:<br>

 I figure that if people can get sub30 onehanded with both hands<br>
(Erik, not Dan) people can also drive on both sides of the road :)  <br>

  But good point, I almost forget about those &quot;alternative&quot; English<br>

 I was once addicted to the dvorak concept... But as with James, I
 found it a terrible layout for typing UNIX commands and eventually
 switched back to QWERTY.

 WOW!!!!!!
 
 That layout is actually very good.
 
 http://colemak.com/Compare
 
 Colemak not only performs well on standard English text, but it
 performs *exceptionally* well on UNIX commands:
 
 QWERTY same hand: 46.88%
 QWERTY same finger: 9.76%
 
 Colemak same hand: 17.28%
 Colemak same finger: 3.2%
 
 Dvorak same hand: 49.76%
 Dvorak same finger: 10.56%
 
 The statistic that interests me most is &quot;same finger&quot; repetition, and
 even on standard english text Colemak outperforms Dvorak and QWERTY in
 this respect. Colemak sacrifices some hand alternation to achieve
 this, but even then, it is only a negligible sacrifice for a huge benefit:

Dvorak seems interesting but completely useless for languages like French
which uses ´ and ` a lot.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I guess for us who have to use alt gr+accent+key it doesn&#x27;t really 
matter what layout one uses. But if you have all the accent 
variations needed already in the layout then swapping the layout 
would be cumbersome.

Anyway, im just using default qwerty since im a slow typist, even 
though coding is my work (it&#x27;s mostly copy/paste with variations 
anyway ...)

          <div class="email-content">Well, Dvorak was developed to optimize typing in the English language,
which probably wouldn&#x27;t help you too much if you don&#x27;t type in English
all that often. However, looking through the keyboard layout options
on my computer, I see that Dvorak layouts for other languages (French,
German and Spanish) are also available.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I&#x27;m 99% sure that adding some negative integers and fractions would 
make them (the more bright ones at least) &quot;wake up&quot; and get the order 
correct. I have no idea what the problem would be with the given 
numbers. Interesting ... :-o

Then again, i was stupid enough in grade 7 to say that 0.5 * 10 = 
0.50 :-P (Quite hilarious now!!)

I once watched a documentary with job interview intelligence tests 
and one guy was asked &quot;One bottle beer has 5% alcohol, how much 
alcohol do 10 bottles have?&quot; and I think he answered &quot;50%&quot;.

Here&#x27;s a nice video: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BJXvaF85ts0

Whenever my boss visits me and uses my keyboard he&#x27;s annoyed that I 
switched it to English layout (which differs slightly from the German 
one) so dvorak or others might drive him mad.

Did some of you who switched to dvorak already improve speed? As far 
as I can see, Macky got 100 wpm with qwerty and 86 with dvorak.

          <div class="email-content">I just started recently also.  44 WPM yesterday (compared to 95-100 in
QWERTY).  Whenever I go running now, I just think of words in my head
and type them in Dvorak in the air--that&#x27;s my main practice time. 
Funny, I can&#x27;t do that with QWERTY any more (even though I can still
type QWERTY).

Unfortunately my school&#x27;s computers won&#x27;t let you change to Dvorak, so
I have to stay fluent in QWERTY this year.

          <div class="email-content">I dropped from 75 to 55. So a loss of 20 wpm, not too different from
yours.

The thing is, cohesive statements are easier to type for me; it may be
so for other people as well. Plus, words like &quot;barbarian&quot; are awkward
on qwerty, imo.

Also, it took me a while to figure out what was wrong with these... I
think it was the result of just assuming that all integers are greater
than or equal to one, and not really noticing that zero there, just
thinking of it as another integer.

I skimmed through these lists and saw decimals, followed by integers.
So I initially didn&#x27;t see anything wrong here.

I also agree with Per that negatives would be an easy &#x27;wake-up&#x27; call.

currently just barely faster than my top Dvorak speed. At least with
QWERTY I can look at the keyboard to get my bearings if I have to. In
any case, I don&#x27;t do all that much typing on computers that are not
mine, so it&#x27;s probably not too big a loss.

          <div class="email-content">Nice work, Ryan

if we can still make suggestions, I have 2 : )

you could change the average &quot;style&quot;, couting 12 solves and droping the fastest and slowest, as &quot;usual&quot;, instead of just 10...to avoid lucky and unlucky times : )

also, you could make a &quot;give up&quot; option/button/whatever on the blindfold simulator, so we can see how close (or far) we were from solved ; )

Great job so far, keep it up

 I once watched a documentary with job interview intelligence tests 
 and one guy was asked &quot;One bottle beer has 5% alcohol, how much 
 alcohol do 10 bottles have?&quot; and I think he answered &quot;50%&quot;.
 
 Here&#x27;s a nice video: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BJXvaF85ts0

I did come across Colemak and many other non-standard keyboards (there
are a bunch here, for example 
http://www.geocities.com/smozoma/projects/keyboard/layout_capewell.htm?200729?20078).
But since I still need to type very frequently on computers that
aren&#x27;t mine (school computers, for example), I decided to switch to
Dvorak in the end, which I can at least easily use on new computers.
I&#x27;m a bit annoyed with Dvorak&#x27;s l on pinky as well, but all these
alternative keyboards are all considerably better than QWERTY.

When it does get to be that I only have to type on my own computer,
I&#x27;ll probably change again. The backspace key should definitely be in
a different place--maybe like in Colemak, or I&#x27;ll buy a Kinesis
keyboard. But I hope that by then people will have come to some sort
of a consensus on which layout is the best for English.

would look to do things faster in other areas of life. Qwerty is just
horrible for speed if you think about it. Plus, we all don&#x27;t want to get
RSI, because then we couldn&#x27;t cube :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Pedro,

The teacher said the probability *is* zero.  I don&#x27;t know to which 
level of math she has taken, but she teaches proofs in geometry very 
precisely.  My college 1st semester analysis class graded proofs on 
the level of exactness that she grades at for high school geometry, 
so I imagine that she is very well versed on high school level 
subjects.

I have no idea of the extent of her knowledge of measure theory, but 
she did say the probably *is* zero.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan, and others,

No I have never explicitly asked a student to explain their ordering to 
me, though I would like to try with the next student that answers this 
way.

Also, the test is timed but not strictly.  They have roughly 1 hour to 
90 minutes to take the test because they know their parents are going 
to be picking them up within that time frame.  We do not actually time 
the test, but practically they have at most 90 minutes to take the 
test.  The middle school assessment probably takes about 60 minutes on 
average for most students, to get an idea of how long the test is.

I have gone over the test with several students, and most of the time 
the very bright students who miss the ordering problems in this 
particular way will see the problem, blush, and then procede to correct 
it, almost always without any prompting from a tutor.

Those who don&#x27;t catch their error right off the bat will see it when we 
describe each fraction as a certain shaded portion of a circle.  
Describing the number zero as no portions, or none, of the circle being 
shaded will have an &quot;ah-ha!&quot; moment and procede to correct it.

I feel as if most students know the answer, but due to either time 
pressure, or them not being 100% certain, answer in the way that most 
students miss this question.

I just find it interesting that so many students answer this way, and 
yet most all of them spot their error very quickly and seem to 
understand what they have done wrong after very little prompting from 
the tutor who goes over the test with them.

I just wish I knew what was going on from a psychological or 
developmental standpoint.

What I have in mind is a rather simple technique to recalibrate the<br>

to right across each of the three rows and hits &quot;save&quot;. The applet can<br>
then use this information to correctly remap the the keys.<br>

Hi Stefan,

i&#x27;m interested in joining you. i looked for a cheap hotel a few days
ago and this hostel sounds really good and(!) cheap :). In case you
don&#x27;t know me: I&#x27;m from Germany and a big fan of your BLD methods :P
(and non-smoker).

Ok, I suggest that anyone who wants to stay there reserves a bed by 
emailing the hostel at info@... and mentions either &quot;Rubik&#x27;s 
cube group&quot; or &quot;Stefan Pochmann&quot;, so they can hopefully put us 
together in the same room(s). I&#x27;ll let them know about this in a 
moment. Maybe also mention it in this thread so we know about it.

I didn&#x27;t reserve my bed with the website system but emailed them some 
questions and they suggested/offered that I reserve just by email to 
avoid extra fees for the system. I&#x27;ve reserved a bed for me for four 
nights, from October 4-8.

Tim, I do know you a bit, I&#x27;ve seen quite competent comments from you 
in Pat&#x27;s forum and on the youtube page showing Matyas&#x27; 3x3 bld 
record. Looking forward to meeting you.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Clarification: The 4/6-bed rooms aren&#x27;t reserved &quot;by room&quot; but &quot;by <br>
bed&quot;. So I didn&#x27;t reserve a 4-bed room for me but only a bed in one, <br>
and you don&#x27;t have to ask me to include you in &quot;my room&quot;. Just <br>
reserve a bed for you mentioning our group like I suggested in my <br>
previous message. There are lockers available and I&#x27;m told they&#x27;re <br>
pretty big so we can store our stuff there comfortably. Not sure yet <br>
whether they already have locks or we have to bring our own.<br>
<br>
The 2-bed rooms are reserved as a whole, meaning a single person <br>
would have to pay for both beds. You can see this and some more info <br>
about prices under &quot;Rates and Booking&quot; on their website. Do the <br>
&quot;search&quot;, just don&#x27;t complete the reservation this way.<br>
<br>

             Self and Bernett are interested in joining you, if you are interested. How much does it cost ? Will they mail us confirmation of our accomadation.? I need their confirmation letter by mail to submit to visa officer to get our visa.
             Can we register by e-mail ?

          <div class="email-content">Hi !<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve never heard of a ufo solver program so far, so I made one,<br>
quickly written, but enough to find every solution within a second<br>
(with my computer) while taking very little memory : <br>
<br>
http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/clement.gallet/ufo_solver.cpp<br>
<br>
Sorry for windows users, I can&#x27;t produce a compiled version, you have<br>
to compile it (or find someone who can compile it). Beware, the<br>
location of the hash table library depends on the compiler.<br>
<br>
No needs for a doc, just change in the beginning of the code the depth<br>
of the search.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone!<br>
<br>
I was very angry with me this week and I would like to avoid this feeling for the next new cubers. When I started learning speed cubing, I quickly found that great site www.speedcubing.com and then started memorizing all those algorithmics. I never thought I could do that for all 119 algorithmics of Friedrich method, but slowly and patiently I could. After that, I continued a long time without beating my average under the 30s. As I thought that knowing all those algorithmics would make me become faster soon, I started to research about speed, algorithmics and other things, when I ralized that the algorithmics that I memorized are not so good for speed. Did I miss anything in the speedcubing site? As I was a new cuber I didn&#x27;t know the difference among algorithmics (speed, fewest moves...).<br>
<br>
So my suggestion is that maybe you (Ron, Chris, Ton, Peter, Tyson, whoever) could add a comment in those algorithmic pages (like in &quot;Overview of all algorithms for corners of first layer and edges of second layer&quot;) explaining that although you&#x27;ve provided the shortest algorithms, sometimes they are not the best ones for speeding. Something like that. I think this would be good for the new ones.<br>
<br>
In the beginnig I said I was very angry with me, not with the speedcubing site, because I know it was my fault not understanding that by my own before. I know I should have searched for this information before learning each one of those algorithmics, but I also think that this comment in those pages would help unexperienced people like me to begin in a right way to speedcubing using that wonderful site.<br>

I have heard that harris chan uses special techniques that either help 
him do a oll skip or soomething like that. If someone has any knowledge 
of these techniques could you please respond.

          <div class="email-content">Well i know that i use COLL&#x27;s. Its easier the ID COLL&#x27;s then it is to <br>
ID G permutes and its faster then doing 1 OLL to get to another OLL. <br>
Rather you use one COLL to get to PLL with only 4 PLL&#x27;s to memorize. 2 <br>
Edge Switch with 1 H permute and 1 V Permutation and 1 Z permutation. <br>
ALthough there are 40 Plus algs to remember, Easy to ID when you <br>

Prices about 16-22 Euros per person per night (including breakfast), 
depending on room size. Yes you can register by email (see my 
previous posts in this thread). About the letter I suggest you ask 
them. They seem very friendly and helpful, so maybe they&#x27;d do it.

The &quot;...&quot; was supposed to be &quot;ginkgo.hu&quot;. It&#x27;s just the address on

I know you play scrabble quite a lot, so I was wondering if you know a
good internet site where you can play english scrabble against others.
I know a great site for swedish scrabble, but it would be nice to be
able do challenge other cubers. :-)

The most serious place to play is www.isc.ro, and download their
client to connect to the Internet Scrabble Club. 

But for challenging other cubers, I think the best place to play is
www.scrabulous.com, or get the Scrabulous application for facebook :)

refer to &quot;UDFBRL/xyz/MES/udfbrl notation&quot; and it&#x27;s not defined anywhere.

But if/when there&#x27;s going to be an official standard notation, IMHO it
should be the one that&#x27;s currently being used by almost everybody.
Changes should be made only if there&#x27;s a very good reason. I&#x27;m sure
many cubers would continue using xyz and ESM even if they weren&#x27;t
included in the standard.

And to me, &quot;&lt;PU>&quot; instead of &#x27;y&#x27; seems like an overkill...

&gt; I would like to see a standard notation for all Rubik&#x27;s cube<br>
&gt; literature. I have written a Word document with a notation that I<br>
&gt; would like to see become standard. You can access it in the files<br>
&gt; section, it&#x27;s called notation.doc<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I have also written to the WCA and hopefully, they will discuss it,<br>
&gt; take into account your feedback, and in some time publish a WCA<br>
&gt; standard for notation. <br>
<br>
If we wish to discuss standardisation, let&#x27;s first see if any of the<br>
existing notations are already sufficient for the job.<br>
<br>
Fridrich&#x27;s page presents a notation in which move variations are<br>
represented by a lowercase suffix. This notation is supported by the<br>
popular AnimCube applet. For example, Rs2 indicates a 180 degree slice<br>
move relative to the right side. Fa&#x27; indicates an reverse 90 degree<br>
anti-slice move relative to the front side. Uc2 indicates a 180 degree<br>
cube rotation relative to the up side.<br>
<br>
It was also suggested to use the suffix &quot;m&quot; to indicate the opposite<br>
direction of &quot;s&quot;, since in Fridrich&#x27;s definition of &quot;s&quot;, Rs&#x27; = M (= Rm).<br>
<br>
Another proposal, quite independent of the above, was to use [R], [U],<br>
[F] to indicate cube rotations. Although, this may conflict with yet<br>
another proposal for big cubes, which uses R[N] to indicate which<br>
layer or cut plane is to be turned. E.g. R[1] is the standard R. R[2]<br>
is what most of us(?) know as r, and so on.<br>

Whoa, you use T-Code or TUT-Code??! I read about T-Code once, but I<br>
never realized that I knew anyone who used it. That&#x27;s pretty hardcore.<br>
<br>
The main language I type in is English, but since switching to Dvorak,<br>
I&#x27;ve had a hard time typing Japanese, which requires me to use QWERTY.<br>
I don&#x27;t think learning T-Code or TUT-Code is worth the effort for me<br>
right now, but do you know of a way to use something like IME standard<br>
with Dvorak or any custom layout?<br>

www.autohotkey.com>, its a program intended for personalized shortcuts but
can be used to swap your keyboard layout with the right scripts. Maybe not
as elegant as using the language bar, but it works just fine with the
Windows Japanese IME.
You can also mess with registry settings, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.

 algorithmics and other things, when I ralized that the algorithmics
 that I memorized are not so good for speed. Did I miss anything in the
 speedcubing site? As I was a new cuber I didn&#x27;t know the difference
 among algorithmics (speed, fewest moves...).

 whoever) could add a comment in those algorithmic pages (like in
 &quot;Overview of all algorithms for corners of first layer and edges of
 second layer&quot;) explaining that although you&#x27;ve provided the shortest
 algorithms, sometimes they are not the best ones for speeding.
 Something like that. I think this would be good for the new ones.

 speedcubing site, because I know it was my fault not understanding
 that by my own before. I know I should have searched for this
 information before learning each one of those algorithmics, but I also
 think that this comment in those pages would help unexperienced people
 like me to begin in a right way to speedcubing using that wonderful site.

          <div class="email-content">Did you need to take lessons and an exam to get the &quot;right-side&quot; license or was it just an administrative procedure?<br>
<br>
And if you ever move back to australia, would you need to get an &quot;upside-down&quot; license (ok, lame joke)<br>

<br>
<br>
  This topic is quite interesting to me at the moment. As many of you<br>
  know, Peter and I moved to the US earlier this year. We bought a car<br>
  recently which required us to get US drivers licences (or &#x27;licenses&#x27; as<br>
  they spell it here). In Australia and England, we drive on the left, but<br>
  in the US they drive on the right, so we had to learn everything<br>
  opposite! Now I&#x27;m licenced to drive on both sides of the road! :)<br>

  &gt; I figure that if people can get sub30 onehanded with both hands<br>
  &gt; (Erik, not Dan) people can also drive on both sides of the road :) <br>
  &gt; <br>
  &gt; But good point, I almost forget about those &quot;alternative&quot; English<br>
  &gt; ways of doing things.<br>

          <div class="email-content">So I gave my 1 year old nephew a broken in 3x3x3 so it would be easy<br>
for him to turn and my mother noticed him turning it in front of a<br>
mirror the other day and he seemed to recognize that his own actions<br>
were reflected back at him and he dropped the cube, put his hands on<br>
the mirror and realized that the &quot;baby in the mirror&quot; was in fact him.<br>
 Chalk another developmental milestone up for the influence of cubing.<br>
 Sorry if this story is off-topic and unwelcome but I thought it was<br>

          <div class="email-content">Since there are a lot of videos of competition solves being put on YouTube, I&#x27;m proposing a tagging scheme that will make it easier to search for and identify solves (until enough people decide to sabotage). I&#x27;ve done it for all my competition videos.<br>
Basically, either at the end of the description or in the tag field (which is limited in space, so you might want to reserve it for other keywords), you would put the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
WCA_<br>
    -To indicate a WCA competition video.<br>
WCA_ID<br>
    -The WCA ID of the solver.<br>
    -Multiple, if necessary.<br>
WCA_comp<br>
    -The string used to identify a<br>
     competition in the WCA database.<br>
WCA_event<br>
    -The event (333, 555bf, etc.) of<br>
     the solve in the video.<br>
    -Possibly multiple (in case.<br>
WCA_year<br>
     -The year of the competition.<br>
      (Could become useful in the future)<br>
WCA_country<br>
     - The nationality of the solvers.<br>
    -Multiple, if necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
If applicable:<br>
WCA_WR<br>
    -World Record (at the time).<br>
WCA_NR<br>
    -NAtional Record (at the time).<br>
<br>
-I&#x27;m not sure whether these should be exclusive...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Very optional:<br>
WCA_continent<br>
    -Continent of the solver<br>
WCA_time<br>
    -Time of the solve:<br>
     WCA_3_55, WCA_54_83,<br>
     WCA_10_05_16<br>
WCA_NaR, WCA_ER, etc.<br>
    -More specifics...<br>
WCA_single / WCA_average<br>
    -Again, more info...<br>
WCA_round<br>
    -WCA_preliminaries, WCA_finals ,etc.<br>
     This might not be consistent, though...   <br>
<br>
-Anything else?<br>
<br>
<br>
The spelling should follow the conventions used in the URLs for the WCA database:<br>
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/index.php <br>
There&#x27;s weird stuff like &quot;pyram&quot; and &quot;333bf&quot; , so watch out...<br>
<br>
<br>
My 2:19 BLD solve ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_PUFL2HTdI ) has the following tags in the description:<br>
<br>
WCA_ WCA_2006GARR01 WCA_CaltechSummer2007 WCA_333bf WCA_2007 WCA_Germany WCA_NR<br>
<br>
I left out: WCA_Europe WCA_2_19_46 WCA_single<br>
<br>
<br>
So: this would be very convenient for people either curious or looking for something. A search for &quot;WCA_&quot; would give every tagged competition solve video...<br>
It would make it easy to find any videos from a specific competition, from a particular person, of certain puzzles, etc.<br>
&quot;WCA_WR&quot; and &quot;WCA_333bf&quot; would return all blindfolded world record videos...<br>
For an example, here are all (sofar: my) posted videos of national records: http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=WCA_NR<br>
This even works if a person in a video is not posted on his own channel (well, obviously), or if there are mutiple solvers in a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=671Ih43j1Fo<br>
<br>
 This is basically fully optional (since tagging is not open, it will require cooperation from video uploaders). If people don&#x27;t want to spend the time on it (does anybody want to write a web form to generate tags?), then it&#x27;ll just quietly fail. But if it becomes a convention, it would be a really cool tool. Maybe (if this gets reliable enough) the database could even have links to Youtube searches.<br>
<br>
By the way, thanks to Michael Gottlieb with helping me on some of this.<br>

Maybe try my rubiktimer, it exports to Excel and the web.

JNetcube could also work I think.

          <div class="email-content">Maybe if Chris Hunt reads this, he can put a special form up on 
strangepuzzle so that anything that is uploaded there already has the 
tags set, by selecting the wca user id and some extra fields. This 
could be copied to youtube when posting there. 

Unfortunately I think that relying on people&#x27;s own tags and good will 
won&#x27;t work.

          <div class="email-content">That sounds really cool and useful. I would tag my videos immediately,
if i had any from an official competition.

And in my opinion WCA_NR and WCA_WR shouldn&#x27;t be exclusive. If i want
to find all national records from hungary for example, i would be very
surprised if almost none of the videos show Mátyás Kuti ;)

What about a similar tagging system for videos of unofficial solves?
There are much more videos of people showing their skills at home and
i find it at least as interesting to watch them as watching
competition solves.
HC_ for home cubing? :D

convention, it would be a really cool tool. Maybe (if this gets
reliable enough) the database could even have links to Youtube searches.

          <div class="email-content">It was more than just an administrative process. We had to do a road
sign test, a general knowledge test, and a driving test. Apparently in
some US states they let you just swap over your foreign licence for an
American one, but not where we live (Virginia).

I found the tests here to be easier than in my home town (Canberra,
Australia), but the administration of getting a licence was much more
difficult!

          <div class="email-content">What about this very simple idea:<br>
<br>
R, U and F mean single layer turns.<br>
r, u and f mean multiple layer turns.<br>
<br>
I have purposefully removed D, B, L, d, b, l, M, E, S, x, y and z. They will no longer be necessary and this will hopefully end the confusion that beginners have about D moving in the opposite direction of U, B opposite to F, etc. I have also made sure that r means exactly the same thing on every size cube. Right now r means double layer turns on 2x2x2 and 3x3x3. But for bigcubes it means single layer (slice) turn on most websites and it even means double layer turns in the official scrambles.<br>
All layer turns can be followed by a suffix of 1, 2 or 3 to indicate how far clockwise that layer should be turned. 1 is the default so if there is no suffix, it means one.<br>
All layer turns can be proceded by a numerical prefix that indicates at which layer to start the turn. 1 is the default so if there is no prefix, it means 1. The maximum value for the prefix is the size of the cube (so 2 for a 2x2x2 and 5 for a 5x5x5)<br>
<br>
The numerical prefix is extremely powerfull and can replace cuberotations (xyz) and slice-turns (MES). This is a little difficult to explain, so let&#x27;s give some examples to make this clear:<br>
<br>
On a 3x3x3:<br>
1R (or just R) would be the same as R is now, Starting 1 layer from the right side you do a single layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
1r (or just r) would be the same as R but should never be used for clarity. Starting 1 layer from the right side you do a multiple layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side). This is not possible because there are not multiple layers.<br>
2R would be the same as M&#x27; is now. Starting 2 layers from the right side you do a single layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
2r would be the same as r is now. Starting 2 layers from the right side you do a multiple layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
3R would be the same as L&#x27; is now. Starting 3 layers from the right side you do a single layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
3r would be the same as x is now. Starting 3 layers from the right side you do a multiple layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
<br>
On a 4x4x4<br>
1R (or just R) would be the same as R is now, Starting 1 layer from the right side you do a single layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
1r (or just r) would be the same as R but should never be used for clarity. Starting 1 layer from the right side you do a multiple layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side). This is not possible because there are not multiple layers.<br>
2R would be the same as r is now. Starting 2 layers from the right side you do a single layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
2r would be the same as rR is now. Starting 2 layers from the right side you do a multiple layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
3R would be the same as l&#x27; is now. Starting 3 layers from the right side you do a single layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
3r would be the same as Lx is now. Starting 3 layers from the right side you do a multiple layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
4R would be the same as L&#x27; is now. Starting 4 layers from the right side you do a single layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
4r would be the same as x is now. Starting 4 layers from the right side you do a multiple layer turn clockwise (as seen from the right side)<br>
<br>
What do people think of this notation? It seems incredibly clear, uniform and complete to me. If the removal of DBL and dbl is to controversial it could be added easily.<br>

  &gt; I would like to see a standard notation for all Rubik&#x27;s cube<br>
  &gt; literature. I have written a Word document with a notation that I<br>
  &gt; would like to see become standard. You can access it in the files<br>
  &gt; section, it&#x27;s called notation.doc<br>
  &gt; <br>
  &gt; I have also written to the WCA and hopefully, they will discuss it,<br>
  &gt; take into account your feedback, and in some time publish a WCA<br>
  &gt; standard for notation. <br>
<br>
  If we wish to discuss standardisation, let&#x27;s first see if any of the<br>
  existing notations are already sufficient for the job.<br>
<br>
  Fridrich&#x27;s page presents a notation in which move variations are<br>
  represented by a lowercase suffix. This notation is supported by the<br>
  popular AnimCube applet. For example, Rs2 indicates a 180 degree slice<br>
  move relative to the right side. Fa&#x27; indicates an reverse 90 degree<br>
  anti-slice move relative to the front side. Uc2 indicates a 180 degree<br>
  cube rotation relative to the up side.<br>
<br>
  It was also suggested to use the suffix &quot;m&quot; to indicate the opposite<br>
  direction of &quot;s&quot;, since in Fridrich&#x27;s definition of &quot;s&quot;, Rs&#x27; = M (= Rm).<br>
<br>
  Another proposal, quite independent of the above, was to use [R], [U],<br>
  [F] to indicate cube rotations. Although, this may conflict with yet<br>
  another proposal for big cubes, which uses R[N] to indicate which<br>
  layer or cut plane is to be turned. E.g. R[1] is the standard R. R[2]<br>
  is what most of us(?) know as r, and so on.<br>

I&#x27;ve been using Dvorak for about 14 months now and I like it a lot. I can still type about 60wpm on QWERTY, too, so I run into no problems with typing in public places

And yes, I realize this is not really relevant to the topic at hand  :)

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Proposal: Standardized YouTube Tags for <br>
Official Solves<br>
<br>
<br>
Since there are a lot of videos of competition solves being put on YouTube, <br>
I&#x27;m proposing a tagging scheme that will make it easier to search for and <br>
identify solves (until enough people decide to sabotage). I&#x27;ve done it for <br>
all my competition videos.<br>
Basically, either at the end of the description or in the tag field (which <br>
is limited in space, so you might want to reserve it for other keywords), <br>
you would put the following:<br>
<br>
WCA_<br>
-To indicate a WCA competition video.<br>
WCA_ID<br>
-The WCA ID of the solver.<br>
-Multiple, if necessary.<br>
WCA_comp<br>
-The string used to identify a<br>
competition in the WCA database.<br>
WCA_event<br>
-The event (333, 555bf, etc.) of<br>
the solve in the video.<br>
-Possibly multiple (in case.<br>
WCA_year<br>
-The year of the competition.<br>
(Could become useful in the future)<br>
WCA_country<br>
- The nationality of the solvers.<br>
-Multiple, if necessary.<br>
<br>
If applicable:<br>
WCA_WR<br>
-World Record (at the time).<br>
WCA_NR<br>
-NAtional Record (at the time).<br>
<br>
-I&#x27;m not sure whether these should be exclusive...<br>
<br>
Very optional:<br>
WCA_continent<br>
-Continent of the solver<br>
WCA_time<br>
-Time of the solve:<br>
WCA_3_55, WCA_54_83,<br>
WCA_10_05_16<br>
WCA_NaR, WCA_ER, etc.<br>
-More specifics...<br>
WCA_single / WCA_average<br>
-Again, more info...<br>
WCA_round<br>
-WCA_preliminaries, WCA_finals ,etc.<br>
This might not be consistent, though...<br>
<br>
-Anything else?<br>
<br>
The spelling should follow the conventions used in the URLs for the WCA <br>
database:<br>
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/index.php<br>
There&#x27;s weird stuff like &quot;pyram&quot; and &quot;333bf&quot; , so watch out...<br>
<br>
My 2:19 BLD solve ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_PUFL2HTdI ) has the <br>
following tags in the description:<br>
<br>
WCA_ WCA_2006GARR01 WCA_CaltechSummer2007 WCA_333bf WCA_2007 WCA_Germany <br>
WCA_NR<br>
<br>
I left out: WCA_Europe WCA_2_19_46 WCA_single<br>
<br>
So: this would be very convenient for people either curious or looking for <br>
something. A search for &quot;WCA_&quot; would give every tagged competition solve <br>
video...<br>
It would make it easy to find any videos from a specific competition, from a <br>
particular person, of certain puzzles, etc.<br>
&quot;WCA_WR&quot; and &quot;WCA_333bf&quot; would return all blindfolded world record videos...<br>
For an example, here are all (sofar: my) posted videos of national records: <br>
http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=WCA_NR<br>
This even works if a person in a video is not posted on his own channel <br>
(well, obviously), or if there are mutiple solvers in a video: <br>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=671Ih43j1Fo<br>
<br>
This is basically fully optional (since tagging is not open, it will require <br>
cooperation from video uploaders). If people don&#x27;t want to spend the time on <br>
it (does anybody want to write a web form to generate tags?), then it&#x27;ll <br>
just quietly fail. But if it becomes a convention, it would be a really cool <br>
tool. Maybe (if this gets reliable enough) the database could even have <br>
links to Youtube searches.<br>
<br>
By the way, thanks to Michael Gottlieb with helping me on some of this.<br>

While the topic of standardized notation has come up again, I guess
thought I would express some of my thoughts about notation. The basic
objection I have to a lot of the notations that are being proposed is
that they do not adhere to the mathematical principles and conventions
that were the basis of the original notation system developed by David
Singmaster.

To Singmaster, his notation was not merely a notation, but a
mathematical notation. U, D, R, etc. were not just ways to move a
Rubik&#x27;s cube, but were mathematical symbols denoting elements of a
mathematical group (a group called the Rubik&#x27;s Cube group). (With cube
rotations, inner layer moves and double layer moves, it becomes
necessary to use an even larger mathematical group. The 4x4x4 and
5x5x5 supercubes use even larger groups, of course.)

Mathematical groups by definition have an associated group operation.
In Singmaster notation, the group operation is denoted as a
&quot;multiplication&quot; operation. In standard mathematical notation,
multiplication generally is implied if no operator symbol is used
between variables. For example, abc means a times b times c. Since the
group operation in Singmaster&#x27;s notation is denoted by multiplication,
we can simply write FRU to mean F &quot;times&quot; R &quot;times&quot; U, which of
course, really means apply the move represented by F, followed by the
move represented by R, followed by the move represented by U.

Since the group operation was represented as &quot;multiplication,&quot;
repetition in Singmaster&#x27;s notation is represented by exponents. So to
represent the move that represents doing R twice in a row, one writes
R with an exponent of 2. To write the result of doing (U followed by
R) seven times, one writes (UR) with an exponent of 7. (Parentheses in
mathmematical expressions are used to show precedence of operations,
especially to override default precedence rules. Here parentheses are
used around UR since standard precedence rules have exponentiation as
higher precedence than multiplication.) Inverses would be written
using an exponent of -1. The use of a &quot;prime&quot; symbol or apostrophe has
become a common shorthand for inverses.

I could mention that (in mathematical texts) sometimes a group
operation is represented by addition instead of multiplication. Then,
repetition would naturally be represented by multiplication. However,
I think cubers prefer writing &quot;F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;&quot; to &quot;F+R+U+R&#x27;+U&#x27;+F&#x27;&quot;.
Besides, mathematicians generally use the addition operator for groups
only when the group is abelian (commutative), and the Rubik&#x27;s cube
group is not an abelian group.

Of course, exponentiation is generally indicated by use of
superscripts. This is not always practical, so we generally just write
&quot;R2&quot; instead of an R with a superscript 2. Since this introduces a
sort of two-character symbol, we often resort to use spacing between
symbols, instead of running them together as we would when
mathematical formatting is used. While an exponentiation operator
(some computer languages use ** while others use ^) could be used,
this clearly would make the notation much more cumbersome.

It seems to me that a lot of speedcubers are totally unaware that cube
notation started out as a mathematical notation. Having a notation
that is consistent with mathematical notation is worthwhile for times
when you want to discuss mathematical properties of cube sequences, or
talk about move sequences in relation to commutators and algorithms
with setup moves (conjugation). A lot of conventions are being used
that go against mathematical conventions. &quot;*&quot; is quite commonly used
for repetition, but that symbol tends to be associated with
multiplication, not exponentiation, so it is mathematically
inconsistent with &quot;multiplication&quot; denoting the group operation.
Multiple-letter symbols is also inconsistent with mathematical
notation because of ambiguity between multiplication and
multiple-letter symbols. I think mathematicians would generally have
the 2nd letter be a subscript in such a situation to avoid ambiguity.
Of course, with subscripts you have the same type of formatting issues
as you have with superscripts.

People also try to impose non-mathematical meanings to parentheses,
such as showing triggers or finger-trick sub-sequences within a bigger
sequence. Also, the direction of half-turns (which really doesn&#x27;t
matter mathematically) is sometimes indicated by use or non-use of &#x27;
along with the 2. At least such usage is not really violating any
mathematical conventions. Anyway, it seems to me that a notation that
is intended to describe how to use your hands/fingers/whatever to turn
the cube has no need to be mathematical in nature. Merely using
parentheses around triggers does not tell me whether I should us my
left thumb, my right index finger, or my chin to make a particular
move within the sequence. I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing a better (even
non-mathematical) notation for better describing &quot;how&quot; to execute, in
addition to having a mathematical notation for describing &quot;what&quot; to
execute.

I also realize that for really big cubes, extending Singmaster
notation in a manner consistent with mathematical notation conventions
may be problematic. I guess the *mathematical* approach would have to
use symbols for the axes, and subscripts for layers, but even then
multiple-layer moves become awkward if you try to keep conformity with
standard mathematical notation.

That&#x27;s a really interesting post, thank you. I, (probably like most of
the younger cubers in this forum) didn&#x27;t realise that there was a
mathematical element to Singmaster&#x27;s notation, although now you have
pointed it out, it seems rather obvious.

However, I can&#x27;t see the problem with choosing a non-mathematical
standard for notation, we are trying to choose the best notation to
describe speedcubing moves on the cube, not the best way to point out
mathematical concepts, at least that&#x27;s what I intended the standard to
be used for.

For instance, you make the point that * is used for multiplication,
not exponentiation, which is of course true. But it makes much more
sense in cubing algorithms to think of (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*2 to mean R U R&#x27; U&#x27;
R U R&#x27; U&#x27;, rather than R U R&#x27; U&#x27; to the power R U R&#x27; U&#x27;, which doesn&#x27;t
really mean anything in cubing terms.

 I agree with Dan, very interesting as backgroundinfo, but not all<br>
that useful for a notation that will be used mostly for scrambling<br>
and representing fingertrick friendly algorithms.  <br>
<br>
 I am having trouble with this part &quot;In Singmaster notation, the<br>
group operation is denoted as a multiplication &quot; operation&quot;. I don&#x27;t<br>
understand this choice. Obviously FFFF means F+F+F+F (4F) and not<br>
F*F*F*F (F^4) and that is where the notation deviates from math.  <br>
<br>
 I think that the notation we are looking for should be more focussed<br>
on the mechanical properties of the cube. n layers for a nxnxn cube, 3<br>
axis, and 4 possible rotations for all axis/layer combinations. That<br>
is why I proposed the n[RUFruf][1234] notation. <br>

 &gt; <br>
 &gt; While the topic of standardized notation has come up again, I<br>
guess<br>
 &gt; thought I would express some of my thoughts about notation. The<br>
basic<br>
 &gt; objection I have to a lot of the notations that are being<br>
proposed<br>
is<br>
 &gt; that they do not adhere to the mathematical principles and<br>
conventions<br>
 &gt; that were the basis of the original notation system developed by<br>
David<br>
 &gt; Singmaster.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; To Singmaster, his notation was not merely a notation, but a<br>
 &gt; mathematical notation. U, D, R, etc. were not just ways to move a<br>
 &gt; Rubik&#x27;s cube, but were mathematical symbols denoting elements of a<br>
 &gt; mathematical group (a group called the Rubik&#x27;s Cube group). (With<br>
cube<br>
 &gt; rotations, inner layer moves and double layer moves, it becomes<br>
 &gt; necessary to use an even larger mathematical group. The 4x4x4 and<br>
 &gt; 5x5x5 supercubes use even larger groups, of course.)<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Mathematical groups by definition have an associated group<br>
operation.<br>
 &gt; In Singmaster notation, the group operation is denoted as a<br>
 &gt; &quot;multiplication&quot; operation. In standard mathematical notation,<br>
 &gt; multiplication generally is implied if no operator symbol is used<br>
 &gt; between variables. For example, abc means a times b times c. Since<br>
the<br>
<br>
&gt; group operation in Singmaster&#x27;s notation is denoted by<br>
multiplication,<br>
 &gt; we can simply write FRU to mean F &quot;times&quot; R &quot;times&quot; U, which of<br>

the<br>

 &gt; repetition in Singmaster&#x27;s notation is represented by exponents.<br>
So to<br>
 &gt; represent the move that represents doing R twice in a row, one<br>
writes<br>
 &gt; R with an exponent of 2. To write the result of doing (U followed<br>
by<br>
 &gt; R) seven times, one writes (UR) with an exponent of 7.<br>
(Parentheses in<br>

 &gt; &gt; If we wish to discuss standardisation, let&#x27;s first see if any of<br>
the<br>
 &gt; &gt; existing notations are already sufficient for the job.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Fridrich&#x27;s page presents a notation in which move variations are<br>
 &gt; &gt; represented by a lowercase suffix. This notation is supported by<br>
the<br>
 &gt; &gt; popular AnimCube applet. For example, Rs2 indicates a 180 degree<br>
slice<br>
 &gt; &gt; move relative to the right side. Fa&#x27; indicates an reverse 90<br>
degree<br>
 &gt; &gt; anti-slice move relative to the front side. Uc2 indicates a 180<br>
degree<br>
 &gt; &gt; cube rotation relative to the up side.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; It was also suggested to use the suffix &quot;m&quot; to indicate the<br>
opposite<br>
 &gt; &gt; direction of &quot;s&quot;, since in Fridrich&#x27;s definition of &quot;s&quot;, Rs&#x27; = M<br>
 (= Rm).<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Another proposal, quite independent of the above, was to use<br>
[R], [U],<br>
 &gt; &gt; [F] to indicate cube rotations. Although, this may conflict with<br>
yet<br>
 &gt; &gt; another proposal for big cubes, which uses R[N] to<br>
indicate<br>
which<br>
 &gt; &gt; layer or cut plane is to be turned. E.g. R[1] is the standard R.<br>
R[2]<br>
 &gt; &gt; is what most of us(?) know as r, and so on.<br>

 Very good tutorial. I think you covered every possible situation<br>
without having a lot of algorithms.  <br>
<br>
 Some things I liked:<br>
 * References to other sites<br>
 * Your continuing reminder that &quot;it is hard at first, but becomes<br>
easier&quot;<br>
 * Doing Corner Orientation before Corner Permutation (easier to<br>
recognize the &quot;1 good corner&quot;)<br>
 * Story about &quot;what next&quot; including advanced methods as well as<br>
tournaments and becoming the next World Champion  <br>
<br>
 Some things I didn&#x27;t like:<br>
 * Doing edge permutation as the second step for the last layer.<br>
Finding the &quot;1 good edge&quot; is difficult and might require to do U +<br>
inspection 4 times only to realize that there isn&#x27;t just &quot;1 good<br>
edge&quot;<br>
 * The translation from beginner to OLL/PLL will be pretty difficult.<br>

&gt; To Singmaster, his notation was not merely a notation, but a<br>
&gt; mathematical notation. U, D, R, etc. were not just ways to move a<br>
&gt; Rubik&#x27;s cube, but were mathematical symbols denoting elements of a<br>
&gt; mathematical group (a group called the Rubik&#x27;s Cube group). (With cube<br>
&gt; rotations, inner layer moves and double layer moves, it becomes<br>
&gt; necessary to use an even larger mathematical group. The 4x4x4 and<br>
&gt; 5x5x5 supercubes use even larger groups, of course.)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m with you that the mathematical &quot;sense&quot; should not be lost. I&#x27;m<br>
also sorry that after all the effort you put into your email, it<br>
wasn&#x27;t correctly understood by the first two respondents ;-)<br>
<br>
However, apart from R*2 which is clearly wrongheaded (if * is taken to<br>
mean multiplication rather than exponentiation), I wouldn&#x27;t say these<br>
proposals really violate mathematical principles. The main thing that<br>
is being proposed by each person is really only a new naming<br>
convention for the individual moves, with the principle of<br>
multiplication and remaining the same as before (again, with the<br>
exception of the wrong R*2). e.g. proposing [R] or Rc as alternative<br>
names for x, or Rs (Fridrich&#x27;s) and 2R (Arnaud&#x27;s) as alternative names<br>
for the inverse of M.<br>
<br>
Some of the naming conventions were inspired by programming language.<br>
e.g. using R[N] as a sort of array indexing into the layers or the cut<br>
planes along an axis from the given side.<br>

This program works great! Thank you very much. I&#x27;m finally happy using
Dvorak in all the languages I need to type in.

At this pace, it looks like Tyson might beat me to 100 wpm.

 Did anyone check if macky is actually spending time on learning<br>
dvorak?  <br>
<br>
 It might just be a brilliant trick to get all speedcubers distracted<br>
and spending time on re-learning how to type while he is spending that<br>
time on getting sub-12 averages. The end result would be that he is<br>
World Champion while the rest can now type 10 WPM slower than before<br>

I think it is interesting to discuss varied topics here, because we<br>
can discuss them from a speed cubists perspective in a way that would<br>
not necessarily be meaningful outside the context of this community<br>
(e.g. how it relates to PLLs and colour schemes, and learning<br>
technique comparisons).<br>

one or two messages is fine, no1 is going to complain about that, but
when a topic starts to span more than 20 or 30 messages and it&#x27;s not
directly related to 

&quot;discuss(ing) speed solving Rubik&#x27;s cube and other Rubik like puzzles.
Feel free to ask any questions, provide any tips, or just talk about
the cube&quot;,

 such as boasting about how many WPM someone can type in a particular
keyboard layout, I think I have a right to ask whether its a relevant
topic for this forum.

          <div class="email-content">I agree entirely with Dan. I wasn&#x27;t going to say anything about it 
hoping it would pass, or waiting till Chris brings it up, but this 
is getting *far* off topic to the point of spamming a lot of people.

I respect Dan&#x27;s opinion on this matter. So unless Chris says 
otherwise I think I might start deleting some of the new ones that 
pop up that are not at all related.

 Did anyone check if macky is actually spending time on learning<br>
 dvorak?  <br>
 <br>
 It might just be a brilliant trick to get all speedcubers distracted<br>
 and spending time on re-learning how to type while he is spending that<br>
 time on getting sub-12 averages. The end result would be that he is<br>
 World Champion while the rest can now type 10 WPM slower than before<br>

is not at all related to the cube, riddles, links to flash games,<br>

 Subject: [Speed cubing group] Proposal: Standardized YouTube Tags for 
 Official Solves
 
 Since there are a lot of videos of competition solves being put on YouTube, 
 I&#x27;m proposing a tagging scheme that will make it easier to search for and 
 identify solves (until enough people decide to sabotage). I&#x27;ve done it for 
 all my competition videos.
 Basically, either at the end of the description or in the tag field (which 
 is limited in space, so you might want to reserve it for other keywords), 
 you would put the following:
 
 WCA_
 -To indicate a WCA competition video.
 WCA_ID
 -The WCA ID of the solver.
 -Multiple, if necessary.
 WCA_comp
 -The string used to identify a
 competition in the WCA database.
 WCA_event
 -The event (333, 555bf, etc.) of
 the solve in the video.
 -Possibly multiple (in case.
 WCA_year
 -The year of the competition.
 (Could become useful in the future)
 WCA_country
 - The nationality of the solvers.
 -Multiple, if necessary.
 
 If applicable:
 WCA_WR
 -World Record (at the time).
 WCA_NR
 -NAtional Record (at the time).
 
 -I&#x27;m not sure whether these should be exclusive...
 
 Very optional:
 WCA_continent
 -Continent of the solver
 WCA_time
 -Time of the solve:
 WCA_3_55, WCA_54_83,
 WCA_10_05_16
 WCA_NaR, WCA_ER, etc.
 -More specifics...
 WCA_single / WCA_average
 -Again, more info...
 WCA_round
 -WCA_preliminaries, WCA_finals ,etc.
 This might not be consistent, though...
 
 -Anything else?
 
 The spelling should follow the conventions used in the URLs for the WCA 
 database:
 http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/index.php
 There&#x27;s weird stuff like &quot;pyram&quot; and &quot;333bf&quot; , so watch out...
 
 My 2:19 BLD solve ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_PUFL2HTdI ) has the 
 following tags in the description:
 
 WCA_ WCA_2006GARR01 WCA_CaltechSummer2007 WCA_333bf WCA_2007 WCA_Germany 
 WCA_NR
 
 I left out: WCA_Europe WCA_2_19_46 WCA_single
 
 So: this would be very convenient for people either curious or looking for 
 something. A search for &quot;WCA_&quot; would give every tagged competition solve 
 video...
 It would make it easy to find any videos from a specific competition, from a 
 particular person, of certain puzzles, etc.
 &quot;WCA_WR&quot; and &quot;WCA_333bf&quot; would return all blindfolded world record videos...
 For an example, here are all (sofar: my) posted videos of national records: 
 http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=WCA_NR
 This even works if a person in a video is not posted on his own channel 
 (well, obviously), or if there are mutiple solvers in a video: 
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=671Ih43j1Fo
 
 This is basically fully optional (since tagging is not open, it will require 
 cooperation from video uploaders). If people don&#x27;t want to spend the time on 
 it (does anybody want to write a web form to generate tags?), then it&#x27;ll 
 just quietly fail. But if it becomes a convention, it would be a really cool 
 tool. Maybe (if this gets reliable enough) the database could even have 
 links to Youtube searches.
 
 By the way, thanks to Michael Gottlieb with helping me on some of this.
 
 Propositionally,
 -Lucas Garron

          <div class="email-content">Interesting idea, and oddly enough I&#x27;ve thought of this notation too.
In my version, though, there are still turns for all six faces to aid
clarity, and the operators ² and &#x27; are still there. I&#x27;m fond of the
old Singmaster notation, and personally I think it is easier to read
if there is a turn for each face anyway.

I also thought some changes to make it a little more efficient: R
alone means 1R (and 1r is never used), r alone means 2r (because it is
the smallest multiple-layer turn that makes sense, and because that
fits in with the scrambling algs we currently use for big cubes), and
sequences like R² should always be written with the ² in superscript
(so it is not confusing).

To describe algorithms, I thought of one more bit of notation: if you
write 3,5r it means that you turn the third through fifth slice of R
clockwise as one move, so that it&#x27;s equivalent to 5r 2r&#x27; but done all
at once just like an M turn. Doing M on a 5x5x5 would be written as
2,4r&#x27; in that case. Of course this isn&#x27;t a necessary addition, but it
would make it easier to describe certain algorithms.

It&#x27;s an interesting proposal, anyway, and I think it would make even
more sense if there was some kind of diagram, because it really seems
to be a consistent and easy notation for cubes of any size.

They will no longer be necessary and this will hopefully end the
confusion that beginners have about D moving in the opposite direction
of U, B opposite to F, etc. I have also made sure that r means exactly
the same thing on every size cube. Right now r means double layer
turns on 2x2x2 and 3x3x3. But for bigcubes it means single layer
(slice) turn on most websites and it even means double layer turns in
the official scrambles.

how far clockwise that layer should be turned. 1 is the default so if
there is no suffix, it means one.

at which layer to start the turn. 1 is the default so if there is no
prefix, it means 1. The maximum value for the prefix is the size of
the cube (so 2 for a 2x2x2 and 5 for a 5x5x5)

          <div class="email-content">Glad you like it, hopefully others will too. I would like to make a diagram, 
but I have no idea how to do that.

I have thought long and hard about whether or not I should omit LBDlbd. The 
reason that I decided to omit it is beginners. I have taught a lot of people 
how to solve the cube and none of them understood why R is a movement away 
from the body while L is a movement towards the body. It took me a long time 
before I actually got used to B and B&#x27; in notation because I had to think 
which way it should turn. Arguments for including LBDlbd were that notation 
would be shorter 3R&#x27; versus L and because removing LBDlbd seemed offensive 
to lefthanded solvers.

I was also doubtful about using R3 instead of R&#x27; because it looks strange at 
first. I really dislike the &#x27; because it is to small. Especially when you 
are reading it on a laptop screen and without spacing between turns. After 
scrambling MegaMinx for a while (a4 F4 d3 e4) i found that I would just 
perform moves with 3 or 4&#x27;s in it in a counterclockwise direction without 
thinking about it.

I don&#x27;t like using superscript or subsript because I don&#x27;t know how to 
generate it on a computer and I think it makes algorithms look to much like 
math. Actually why do we call it algorithms instead of (move-)sequences?

&quot;r alone means 2r&quot; That is a very confusing sentence. Please don&#x27;t ever 
think like that again!

&quot;write 3,5r &quot; That&#x27;s a nice addition, but I don&#x27;t think anyone will ever use 
that type of &quot;multiple layer inner slice&quot; moves.

To summarize:
Positive:
Using only RUFruf is elegant, mechanically correct and easy for beginners. 
Adding LBDlbd is only useful because we have gotten used to that notation.
Adding a prefix (or prefixes) that indicates the starting layer (and ending 
layer) is very elegant, makes r behave consistent on all sized cubes and can 
replace xyz and MES notation.
Adding a suffix of [123(4)] makes sequences more readable in print.
Negative:
Because prefix and suffix can have the same numeric value spacing becomes a 
requirement to prevent ambiguity.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: A standard notation


Interesting idea, and oddly enough I&#x27;ve thought of this notation too.
In my version, though, there are still turns for all six faces to aid
clarity, and the operators ï¿½ and &#x27; are still there. I&#x27;m fond of the
old Singmaster notation, and personally I think it is easier to read
if there is a turn for each face anyway.

I also thought some changes to make it a little more efficient: R
alone means 1R (and 1r is never used), r alone means 2r (because it is
the smallest multiple-layer turn that makes sense, and because that
fits in with the scrambling algs we currently use for big cubes), and
sequences like Rï¿½ should always be written with the ï¿½ in superscript
(so it is not confusing).

To describe algorithms, I thought of one more bit of notation: if you
write 3,5r it means that you turn the third through fifth slice of R
clockwise as one move, so that it&#x27;s equivalent to 5r 2r&#x27; but done all
at once just like an M turn. Doing M on a 5x5x5 would be written as
2,4r&#x27; in that case. Of course this isn&#x27;t a necessary addition, but it
would make it easier to describe certain algorithms.

It&#x27;s an interesting proposal, anyway, and I think it would make even
more sense if there was some kind of diagram, because it really seems
to be a consistent and easy notation for cubes of any size.

They will no longer be necessary and this will hopefully end the
confusion that beginners have about D moving in the opposite direction
of U, B opposite to F, etc. I have also made sure that r means exactly
the same thing on every size cube. Right now r means double layer
turns on 2x2x2 and 3x3x3. But for bigcubes it means single layer
(slice) turn on most websites and it even means double layer turns in
the official scrambles.

how far clockwise that layer should be turned. 1 is the default so if
there is no suffix, it means one.

at which layer to start the turn. 1 is the default so if there is no
prefix, it means 1. The maximum value for the prefix is the size of
the cube (so 2 for a 2x2x2 and 5 for a 5x5x5)

And can you run your program on more samples (thousands) are does that take <br>

Finally, can you analyze Petrus F2L also?<br>

Hmm, I just noticed that the block-style method not only has one less<br>
step, but even needed fewer moves *per step*, on average 5.54 moves<br>
(22.15/4) vs CFOP-style&#x27;s 5.71 moves (28.54/5).<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think we need a notation that allows for all moves that a human would 
perform during cubing.
MES should be possible, because the alternative would be something like L R&#x27; 
x&#x27; and that deviates to much from human perception of that move.
xyz should also be possible because humans rotate the cube a lot.
ruf (dbl) should also be possible AND consistent across different sized 
cubes.

I think I found a way to communicate all of that for any sized cube in a 
very short and easy notation that is both easy enough for beginners and 
powerful enough for experts.

How much notation do we need? Do we need the M&#x27;s, E&#x27;s, and S&#x27;s?

Where is the balance between having what we need to communicate, and too
much? I think this is a difficult question to answer, so some varied
opinion might suffice.

No, I didn&#x27;t intend to use 3r3 R. I just missed that one. That is a big flaw <br>
in my notation. Double layer turns from LDB are not possible.<br>
I see 3 resolutions:<br>
1) use 3r3 R. Bad idea because it turns 1 physical move into two notational <br>
moves<br>
2) use 3,2r3. Works<br>
3) use l. Requires the inclusion of LDBldb.<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it, wouldn&#x27;t x,y[RUF][123] be enough to allow for all <br>
moves? I don&#x27;t think ruf would be needed anymore. I can see 2 ways to use <br>
x,y<br>
1) x means starting layer, y means ending layer. On a 5x5x5 4,3R would mean <br>
that slice 4 and 3 would be turned clockwise<br>
2) x means starting layer, y means number of layers. On a 5x5x5 4,3R would <br>
mean that slice 4, 3 and 2 would be turned clockwise.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s a lot of options. What do you think?<br>
a) This notation is no longer interesting enough to replace the existing <br>
ones<br>
b) Let&#x27;s just include LDBldb<br>
c) I like x,y[RUF][123] option 1<br>
d) I like x,y[RUF][123] option 2<br>
e) I have another idea........................<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I have thought long and hard about whether or not I should omit<br>
LBDlbd. (...)<br>
<br>
Well I can see two problems with not including LBD, other than those<br>
that you mentioned. First: when you do L, you (of course) turn from<br>
the left side; if a beginner encounters 3R&#x27;, they will have to do a<br>
turn that is counterclockwise when looking at the right side, but<br>
performed on the left side, and I think that this would be very<br>
confusing. Second: if someone gives you an algorithm like 3R&#x27; U 3R,<br>
and you aren&#x27;t aware of the context, it could be L U L&#x27; on 3x3x3 or<br>
something totally different on a bigger cube. The advantage of L is<br>
that it always means the outer layer - L U L&#x27; is the same idea on<br>
every size cube.<br>
<br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t like using superscript or subsript because I don&#x27;t know how to <br>
&gt; generate it on a computer and I think it makes algorithms look to<br>
much like <br>
&gt; math. Actually why do we call it algorithms instead of (move-)sequences?<br>
<br>
I guess this goes back to the days when the only people who could<br>
solve cubes were mathy types. But it&#x27;s a tradition, and it does have<br>
the added advantage of having the nice short form of &#x27;alg&#x27; - try to<br>
find such a nice abbreviation of &#x27;sequence&#x27;!<br>
<br>
&gt; &quot;r alone means 2r&quot; That is a very confusing sentence. Please don&#x27;t ever <br>
&gt; think like that again!<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so wrong with it (do you have a problem with the<br>
idea itself or the phrasing?). I suppose I could rewrite it to be<br>
clearer - &quot;if you see just r, without a number to the left of it, it<br>
can be understood to mean 2r, because that is the smallest<br>
multiple-layer turn that is logically necessary.&quot; As far as the idea<br>
is concerned, why not try to preserve some kind of notation we use now<br>
as much as we can? It takes less space to write anyway, just like how<br>
people would rather write &#x27;RFU&#x27; than &#x27;R+ * F+ * U+&#x27;.<br>
<br>
&gt; &quot;write 3,5r &quot; That&#x27;s a nice addition, but I don&#x27;t think anyone will<br>
ever use <br>
&gt; that type of &quot;multiple layer inner slice&quot; moves.<br>
<br>
Oh? You&#x27;ve never done an (rl&#x27;) or M&#x27; move on a 4x4x4? I think that<br>
isn&#x27;t nearly as easy to understand as 2,3r. It would even be (rm&#x27;l&#x27;)<br>
on a 5x5x5, rather than just 2,4r. Also, on the 5x5x5, I use things<br>
like 2,3r for patterns and more complicated commutators all the time.<br>
It&#x27;s just like the reason to introduce an M move on the FRULBD system<br>
- even if you don&#x27;t use it much, some people might use it quite a lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as x, y, z - these are necessary in some form, and just<br>
rewriting them as 3r, 4r, 5r, etc. is not consistent enough to work.<br>
But I think that something like cR, QR, [r], or rot(R) would be better<br>
than x, just because it is easier to understand quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
One thing to remember.. I&#x27;m not trying to debate the merits of your<br>
system as much as promote my own similar one. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I had used silicone spray for a long time, but can&#x27;t find the kind I 
liked (yellow can, prestone was the brand).  if you can find it, I 
thought it worked very well.

someone suggested silicone oil, which I now use and like even more.  
With the sprayd, you can&#x27;t get the lube right where you want it, but 
the oil you can add small drops which is also less messy.  One small 
bottle lasts a very long time--I rarely need to re-lube the cubes.  

I use 100% pure silicone oil, which I bought at a hobby store that 
sells remote control cars--the oil is used for the cars&#x27; shocks 
(which I think are plastic parts, like the cube).  I just grabbed 20 
weight for no particular reason (there were numerous weights and 
brands), but it works very well.  

anyone else tried silicone oil?  i&#x27;m curious if the other weights 
also work well.  

I&#x27;m no expert on lubing or cubing (though I did get my first sub-20 
solve last week!), but I love the way my cubes feel now, and i&#x27;ve 
been using the same bottle for over a year and it is still 80% full.

happy cubing

Why not? I think some people already do it, or at least something 
similar. Petrus solvers start with two of these blocks, Johannes and 
Ryan maybe with three? Also, keep in mind that each of the blocks can 
usually be solved with very few turns (5.54 on average, and the 
fourth block is actually a CE pair which takes slightly more moves on 
average, so the first few must take less), so I think with some 
practice it can&#x27;t be all that hard to do.

It&#x27;s currently too slow for thousands, but I&#x27;ll do 100 for both 
methods.

> Finally, can you analyze Petrus F2L also?

Not yet. Right now I can only solve a full piece directly. I can&#x27;t 
tell the program to &quot;orient&quot; only.

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes, i have to agree with dan on this. This forum does not have it&#x27;s 
own off topic section where this would have fitted comfortably with 
no objections. But this thread is getting out of hand. Even if one 
wants to ignore the thread it makes it harder to navigate the other 
cube related stuff. Without only reading a fraction of it all i think 
i can say the only relevant issue of that thread was how different 
layouts will affect Ryan&#x27;s animated cube applet. It&#x27;s a nice feature 
to allow for many keyboard layouts.

What do most people do with the time saved form using a different 
layout?? Cubing ??? ;-) ;-)

 cube related stuff. Without only reading a fraction of it all i<br>
think <br>
 i can say the only relevant issue of that thread was how different <br>
 layouts will affect Ryan&#x27;s animated cube applet. It&#x27;s a nice feature<br>
<br>
 to allow for many keyboard layouts.<br>
 What do most people do with the time saved form using a different <br>
 layout?? Cubing ??? ;-) ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I dont think this approach is quite new. Lars Vandenbergh has a java 
solver that works by the &quot;expanding blocks&quot; approach. At least it 
started with finding short 2x2x2-blocks (anywhere). Then looking into 
expanding these later. But i cannot quite recall how it was done 
after 2 steps (2x2x3). I know we talked about expanding to either f2l 
or f2l minus a c/e (3 steps according to Stefan).

Another interesting approach would be to analyse the x-cross approach 
(x-cross then insert 3 c/e pairs, this also has 4 steps) and compare 
that with what Stefan has done. One might also look into what Mirek 
(Goljan)used to do: after f2l-1 c/e pair insert the last block while 
making a 2x2x1 on LL. Then learn all algs for the last &quot;L&quot;. He said 
there is slightly more algs than for normal CFOP but overall the 
solutions are shorter. I have no idea if he is willing to share 
details of his old approach...

And also as discussed before i dont thinkthere is a DIRECT 
correlation between solution length and solvin time for speedsolving. 
Recognition and minimising delays plays a great part in 
this &quot;formula&quot;.

Best wishes,

          <div class="email-content">My gut reaction is that this seems like a viable strategy for
speedcubing.  If you solve diagonal 2x2x2 blocks it turns back into a
Fridrich F2L with 2 remaining corner/edge pairs.  If you solve 2
adjacent 2x2x2 blocks it seems like a sort of Petrus solve mixed with
2-gen.

I can already get F2L move counts of around 28-30 if I take 5-10
seconds time to think about what to do for each block.  I imagine with
practice this would be much easier and go much more quickly.  Also
sometimes it feels an awful lot like extended cross at the begininng,
just a bit easier since you don&#x27;t worry about the cross edges.

If the math proves that the move count is usually lower, I don&#x27;t see
why it&#x27;s not something all Fridrich solvers should switch to.  It
seems with enough practice seeing these blocks would be quite easy,
the same as F2L pairs.

I certainly will keep practicing and see if I can speed up my F2L by
using this idea.  I feel like &quot;greedy block&quot; F2L really could be a
viable speedcubing strategy.

          <div class="email-content">Thinking about this further, it seems that ideas that Fridrich solvers
use like partial cross, and X-cross, are just crude versions of greedy
block.  It seems that the reason they speed up Fridrich solves is that
they are a step in the direction of a true greedy block style, thus
making them slightly more efficient than cross followed by F2L pairs only.

Does that seem like too big of a jump in thought?  It sounds
reasonable to me as a first thought.

&quot;dvorak&quot; as perhaps being a side-challenge at the next cubing<br>

The &quot;greedy&quot; refers to the algorithm, or rather the way the program 
chooses which pair or block to solve next. It just means that I don&#x27;t 
consider all 4! possible orders, but start to look for the easiest 
(shortest solution) of the four, then solve that, then repeat with 
the remaining three. This is intentional, as I want to reflect how 
humans solve. And humans - at least for speedcubing - don&#x27;t consider 
all possible orders but instead start with the easiest one (or the 
one they see first, which might very well be the easiest one in most 
cases).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm

Oh and &quot;optimal&quot; was meant to refer to the solutions of the method 
steps being as short as possible, thanks to using a program.

Btw, I haven&#x27;t checked the order in which the program solved the 
blocks of those Sunday Contest scrambles, but I checked ten other 
solves it generated and while it could have started by solving two 
diagonally opposite 2x2x2 blocks, it never did that. It always 
extended the first one to a 2x2x3. Makes me think that starting with 
opposites might be a bad idea.

Cheers!
Stefan

http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/L1/ece.htm

I&#x27;ve always thought a method like this was viable if one had enough time to
practice it thoroughly.  Fridrich is fast because it can be done with very
little thought at very high turning speeds. Even though it&#x27;s less moves, the
downfall of block methods is of course that one has to follow three pieces
to build the next &quot;block,&quot; making it harder to obtains such fast speeds and
still have a fluent solve. You also now have to examine edge pieces on the
bottom layer, making recognition still harder.

Good luck to those trying this out, I hope it works.
Maybe I should start speedcubing again......

If it&#x27;s not too hard to run this in your program: assuming you have <br>

2?<br>
<br>
I am particularly interested in cases where the cross edge is &quot;flipped&quot; <br>
(meaning it would take a minimum of 3 moves to solve) and cases where <br>
the cross edge is not flipped, meaning it would take a maximum of 2 <br>
moves to solve).<br>
<br>
Again I don&#x27;t know if that is time consuming to run, but I think it <br>

I don&#x27;t think the second approach will ever be better. It&#x27;s almost the
same as the first one, only difference is that the first step (1x2x2
block) is split into two steps (edge + ce-pair).

Right now the methods I can describe to the program must be a 
sequence of method steps, each step containing one or more subgoals 
that are then solved in any order. The two methods I&#x27;ve used so far 
are thus described as:

1. Cross
2. The four CE pairs

1. The four 2x2x2 blocks

I could do what you asked if I let the program always solve the same 
2x2x3 block. I can&#x27;t tell it to solve any of the possible four, and 
then solve the last cross edge. But like Johannes already said, 1) 
should win this.

Btw, please don&#x27;t call it &quot;greedy block&quot; unless you also want to call 
the other method something like &quot;greedy CFOP&quot; or &quot;greedy CF&quot;. The 
greed is not really part of the method I&#x27;d say.

Cheers!
Stefan

On the other hand, each step needs to solve fewer pieces. So while 
I&#x27;m not shocked by the discovery, I also didn&#x27;t expect it. Both ways 
have their (dis)advantage and I didn&#x27;t know what would take fewer 
moves (I still don&#x27;t, as that first sample set was quite small).

I&#x27;d say equal weightings, yes, because I don&#x27;t explicitly add any 
weighting. If the opposite 2x2x2 takes fewer turns than the other 
two, then it&#x27;ll be chosen. It&#x27;s just about which of the three 2x2x2s 
can be solved with the fewest turns. I actually search all three 
possibilities in parallel and in case of several subgoals needing the 
same lowest amount of moves, it&#x27;s somewhat random which will win 
(depends on the search graph structure and how I traverse it, which 
is mostly guided by the order I try the different possible moves).

That said, &quot;opposite&quot; does have a natural disadvantage since there&#x27;s 
just one, while there are *two* &quot;adjacent&quot; ones. Didn&#x27;t think about 
that before.

I thought that the opposite 2x2x2 might have an advantage because it 
has more freedom to move, so I was thinking this might be enough to 
overcome the disadvantage of having one more piece. When I (not my 
computer) solve for fewest moves then I usually start with three 
2x2x2s (to build F2L minuns one pair), and without having stats to 
know for sure, I&#x27;d say my second 2x2x2 is &quot;opposite&quot; not that rarely. 
So I was surprised the program, in ten attempts, never thought that&#x27;s 
a good idea. But I&#x27;m not good at this, anyway.

Cheers!
Stefan

That argument sounds a bit odd, I feel there&#x27;s a missing step, 
arguing that fewer pieces means fewer moves. The greed itself doesn&#x27;t 
care about the number of pieces, only about the number of moves. 
Greedy here was meant as making the locally optimal choice, i.e. 
choosing the subgoal that needs the fewest moves right now but 
ignoring what this will lead to globally, i.e., how many moves the 
remaining subgoals need afterwards. And there certainly are 
situations where those four pieces of the opposite block take fewer 
moves to solve than the three pieces of an adjacent block.

Cheers!
Stefan

Yeah, I should&#x27;ve explained more. An adjacent 2x2x2 is basically a<br>
subset of the opposite one. Both include a square (1x2x2 block), but<br>
the opposite 2x2x2 also needs an extra edge. Intuitively it seems to<br>
me that an adjacent 2x2x2 should, on average, require less moves.<br>

I would hope that the goal is to do both. At some point in a cuber&#x27;s 
life, he/she must encounter the mathematical aspects of the cube to 
become truely proficent. Trying to separate cubing from math seems 
regretable to me.

I think we should keep our notation choices mathematically-sound.

This whole business with things like &quot;3R&quot; I&#x27;m not liking. And when I 
write things like &quot;R2&quot; I prefer to superscript it, I think it helps 
it become more readable, regardless of spacing.


As always, I love hearing Bruce&#x27;s old-school knowledge on this stuff.

Yes, which makes these alternatives approximately as bad as each other.<br>
<br>
The issue? Non-math people are in fact trying to do algebra on move<br>
sequences (e.g. (...)*2) but are notating the algebra from a position<br>
of mathematical ignorance. There is nothing wrong with being a<br>
non-math-type person, but if you want to design a notation involving<br>
some algebra, then your notation is going to look rather silly if it<br>
obviously contradicts the principles of the underlying algebra.<br>
<br>
In the algebra,<br>
<br>
  abc = a*b*c (standard maths from school) and<br>
  abcabc != (abc)*2   but rather<br>
  abcabc = (abc)(abc) = (abc)^2 = (abc)2 in ascii shorthand<br>
<br>
Similarly<br>
<br>
  a2 = ascii shorthand for a^2 = a*a = aa<br>
<br>
What is the problem with (abc)*2? It assumes that abc is a number,<br>
which it is not, or it assumes that abc=a+b+c, which also it does not.<br>
Since, it is really moves that are being multiplied by moves, what is<br>
really meant is:<br>
<br>
    abcabc =  (by associativity)<br>
    (abc)(abc) = (by exponentiation)<br>
    (abc)^2 = (by ascii shorthand)<br>
    (abc)2<br>
<br>
Hence the notation (RUR&#x27;U)2 rather than (RUR&#x27;U)*2, and the notation<br>
R2 rather than R*2.<br>

That&#x27;s actually the notation I use in my 4x4x4 solver program (for
double-layer half-turns). Only I think of it as pretending the number
to be an exponent (like when we write &quot;R2&quot;). (I notice Ryan seems to
look at it that way, too.)

With regard to the expression Doug mentioned: &quot;(R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)x2&quot;

As aznseashell pointed out, I would interpret the x2 as a cube
rotation, unless the actual x-like multiplication symbol is used
instead of the letter x. There is a Unicode character for the
multiplication symbol (code 00D7 hex), but I tend to stick to standard
ASCII characters on this forum, or other contexts where I am in doubt
about the general acceptability of such characters.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I would strongly suggest that a cube notation must work WITHOUT 
superscript or subscript!! It must be possible to write the notation 
in a plain and simple text editor with standard ascii symbols. 
Actually we should stick to the ansi standard, the first 128 symbols 
of the ascii table only :-)

My 2 cents,

          <div class="email-content">I wanted to make a post in a form similar to Ryan&#x27;s. I think all 
programmers in the group have a very valid point about 
super/subscript. If you&#x27;ve ever tried copying algs from Jessica 
Fridrich&#x27;s site where subscript is used, you know how annoying it is 
that your text editor it does not understand the codes.

It also makes comparison of two algorithms impossible if they are in 
a different format.

          <div class="email-content">I would like to continue the discussion on algorithm standard 
notation, with a special interest:

I would be very interested e.g. in an algorithm web crawler so we 
could make a Rubik&#x27;s cube algorithm search engine. However, this is 
difficult without a standard notation.

Maybe already we can think of some extra html that can help achieve 
this goal. (I&#x27;m starting to drift off the notation topic now).

E.g. &lt;div class=&quot;puzzle-algorithm type-3x3x3 notation-standard alias-
sune&quot;>RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;&lt;/div>

You could even link to a special XML file that contains the 
algorithms in a more machine readable format:
&lt;puzzle-algorithms>
  &lt;puzzle-algorithm>
     &lt;type>3x3x3&lt;/type>
     &lt;notation>standard&lt;/notation>
     &lt;alias>sune&lt;/alias>
     &lt;definition>RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;&lt;/definition>
  &lt;/puzzle-algorithm>
&lt;/puzzle-algorithms>

(I sure hope this XML comes out nice in your reader)

This is what is commonly known as a microformat. See  
http://microformats.org/

If we can make this into a usable format we can start building 
crawlers. Of course a lot of personal work is involved since everyone 
needs to update they&#x27;re web pages. For databases like Ryans 
(http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/database/) and mine (alglist.ning.com) 
this is a matter of implementing it once, but it is also very 
interesting for the hundreds (thousands?) of personal pages out there.

What are your thoughts? Maybe we can come up with a &quot;standard&quot; before 
the real WCA notation standard arrives.

          <div class="email-content">Understandably for a group like speed solving a standard notation for 3x3 cubes is of paramount interest. Maybe a slight extension for 4x4 and possibly 5x5. The question I have is about the notating of moves for a cube of arbitrary, NxN, size. For 4x4 and 5x5 there is the use of lower case letters for face names to indicate inner slice but this technique does not extend to arbitrary depths. The only method I can imagine that will extend is to allow for a number to be placed before a face letter to indicate depth of slice. Of course you always have the issue of zero or one based notation and it is always simple to allow for an absent depth indicator to default to mean the face (zero depth).<br>
<br>
Even for 5x5 cubes this is an issue since the middle layer cannot be easily specified with the lower case notation. Adding middle slice move notation for the X, Y and Z axes recovers direct access but adds three new symbols and doesn&#x27;t help for larger but still feasible cubes like the 7x7.<br>
<br>
If one does use a number to indicate slice depth then the appended 2 for a 180 degree turn becomes a problem which can be remedied by changing the symbol used to just about anything else. Every move can then be indicated by three parts, only one of which is there in every case. First, any number of digits indicating depth which defaults to zero depth if the digits are not present, second, a face name initial and third, a twist indicator which is absent for clockwise, prime for anticlockwise and an asterisk (or similar symbol) for a double twist. This does have the virtue that it essentially defaults to the standard notation for the 3x3 and it allows the specification of arbitrary moves for NxN cubes.<br>
<br>
I actually use a slightly more elaborate notation which assigns a meaning to lower case (all the slices from the face to the slice) and M, S, and E for middle slices and lower case for them specifying slices from the middle to the slice indicate by the number.<br>

The full ascii table has 256 characters/sysmbols. But only the first 
128 are common for all variations of the localised ascii-tables, or 
code pages. Hence to have only worldwide characters in our notation we 
should stick to these common symbols only.

          <div class="email-content">It seems to me that there is a tension between describing cube moves  
in a mathematical sense, and describing hand movements that a human  
does when speed cubing. And maybe the same notation should not be  
used for both.

Personally, I find the xyz stuff that changes the *meaning* of the  
regular moves (U becomes F etc) completely unusable. I would want a  
notation where you could add finger hints, but the basic move  
notation was the same. This would mean you had to stop thinking of U  
as &quot;the side facing up&quot;, and instead consider it &quot;the green side&quot;.  
This is perfectly doable, but would probably less useful to those who  
only care about hand and finger movements.

          <div class="email-content">I have to agree with Lars on the idea of not using the same notation
for move notations in a mathematical sense as for hand
movements/speedcubing.

Why not have a &quot;Descriptive&quot; notation for speedcubing and a &quot;Pure&quot;
notation for cubing approached from any sort of matematical standpoint?

I personally wouldn&#x27;t mind learning two notations.  In fact I think it
would be interesting to have a notation that fits both speedcubing,
and math in a pure sense.  It would make a lot of debates easier, and
one could just preface their message or e-mail with a phrase &quot;The
following written in descriptive notation&quot; or &quot;the following written
in pure notation&quot;.  Even &quot;pure&quot; notation sounds a little snooty.  Why
not &quot;standard&quot; notation for pure mathematical notation, and
&quot;descriptive notation&quot; for speedcubing and hand movements notations?

I think that European cubers should help us out on the lube. I&#x27;m

The actual &quot;cube lube&quot; in syringes or from that one site, is however 
allowed if it is placed within a 1 quart or smaller zip-lock (or any

Also be careful with too much of certain personal items such as: 
hair gel, facial cleanser, deoderant, or perfume/cologne. All of 
these had to be disposed of for me to pass through security. They 
are quite strict about liquids. As a cuber, I also like to use hand

I understand what you mean, but I don&#x27;t think it would work as a
notation for everyone. With your own 3x3x3 method, for example, if a
solver is truly color neutral, they could end up permuting the last
layer on any color - and if every color was given a unique letter, a
solver would need six separate tables of last layer algorithms. R U R&#x27;
U R U2 R&#x27; only works when the last layer is U, and unless you force
everyone to do a white-cross Fridrich solve (which I know many people
would not want to do at all) you are simply not going to have everyone
end up with a last layer on the same color.

Besides, if you are solving on a void cube or a 4x4x4 - or even a
standard 3x3x3 with a different color scheme - this notation would
instantly become useless. What is the &#x27;green&#x27; side if there are no
green centers, or no fixed centers at all? If U is yellow and D is
white, for example, how are you to treat a cube where white and yellow
are adjacent? A web page of algorithms can&#x27;t insist that the reader
use exactly the same color scheme, especially since all unmodified
3x3x3s solve the same way.

That said, having an &#x27;absolute&#x27; color notation (as opposed to the
&#x27;relative&#x27; notation of UFRLBD) is useful, especially in the Fewest
Moves event where you will often be turning the cube very often. It&#x27;s
probably better to use the notation privately, though, because it
won&#x27;t apply to every solver or every cube. I&#x27;ve often used something
like GBYWRO to describe the first letters of the colors on the cube,
or a standard notation with U=white and F=green, just to make sure
that the turns I do can be replicated later from a uniform position.

So, you&#x27;ve written to the WCA? Well... the WCA only needs notation 
for:

1) Scrambling the cubes.
2) Fewest moves solutions.

So no fancy extensive notation is needed here.

For 1), UDLRFBudlrfb are enough, and lower case letters should mean 
turning the outer two layers, for *all* cubes, as that&#x27;s what the WCA 
scramble generators use. For fewest moves scrambles if you insist on 
repetitions, parentheses can be used like (U R F)3.

For 2), I as a competitor would like to be able to specify first a 
translation like Y->U, W->D, O->F, R->B, G->L, B->R. That is, specify 
my color scheme. Then I could use my color letters to write down my 
solution. I find it more natural to write the colors, as I tend to 
rotate the cube a lot and I don&#x27;t want to always have to mentally 
translate the color back to UDLRFB, which wastes time, is error-
prone, and is completely artificial and unnecessary! The argument 
that the 4x4 doesn&#x27;t have centers and therefore sides can&#x27;t be 
specified by color is void here, as there&#x27;s no 4x4 fewest moves event 
as far as the WCA is concerned.

Cheers!
Stefan

Easy, yes, but it also wastes time, is error-prone, and is completely 
artificial and unnecessary. This almost killed my solution at the US 
Open.

However... I also remember that I preferred UDLRFB notation for 
repeating my not yet finished solution (had to do that sometimes, 
when I made a mistake and didn&#x27;t remember what I had done). So I 
think next time I&#x27;ll simply write UDLRFB on my center pieces.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Then my old computer science textbook is wrong ;-) It does say that 
the ASCII table is 256 characters (8 bits) whereof the first 128 
characters are common amongst the different localised codepages. It 
refers to the first 128 chars as the basic or ANSI part of the ASCII 
table and the latter 128 chars as the extended ASCII table. Anywhow, 
discussing this is sidetracking the topic at hand: notation for 
cubing.

Let&#x27;s leave whether ASCII is 7 or 8 bits to a later discussion. It&#x27;s 
not really an interesting discusison anyway. I may just as well list 
the symbols that im quite sure are common for all codepages, and not 
refer to names of codepages/character collections :-o

I think limiting a standard notation solely for practical purposes 
(speedcubing events) is a bit too short sighted. And how can one be 
sure what events will occur at a future point of time? I personally 
endorse the development of an official WCA cube notation that should 
cover at least any regular sized (nxnxn) cube. Remove all ambiguity, 
be intuitive, use commonly available symbols only. And WCA should 
further encourage websites to comply with the official notation. This 
would make life easier for a lot of people, not only those who attend 
official WCA competitions.

How about a constructive proof to that one?

If we can find a u,r,f only sequence that emulates B,L or D then we 
should be done. Equivalently (i think) if we find a cube rotation 
using only u,r,f then we are also done. By symmetry we than can do 
all possible cube rotations. And cube rotation pluss u r or f will 
then enable us to do any outer layer turn. Of course solving the cube 
like that will give extremely LONG solutions, but it answers the 
first question (that the cube is solvable solely with u,r,f. How to 
efficiently/practically solve with u/r/f is another matter :-)

That seems impossible to me, because the BLD-corner isn&#x27;t moving
anywhere with just &lt;u,r,f>.

          <div class="email-content">> the BLD-corner isn&#x27;t moving anywhere with just &lt;u,r,f>.

This is trivially true. But the centers move, so it is not clear 
either way if every cube state is solvable in this group in light of 
this observation.

I can show that this problem is &quot;if and only if&quot; (necessary and 
sufficent to) the following proposition: &quot;The move M can be written 
using only u,r,f.&quot;

This, in turn, can be solved using a computer program I&#x27;d imagine. 
If it is possible, then this would make for a boring proof, but a 
proof nonetheless...

Yes, and that seems like an easy way to prove that all positions are
solvable using just &lt;u,r,f>. With some experimenting I found this: ((r
u2 r&#x27; u2)35 r2)3 = R2. Let&#x27;s see who&#x27;ll be the first to find a
90-degree turn.

The question how many moves are needed is quite another story...

> I&#x27;m a bit confused at Johannes&#x27;s post.

Which one, and what&#x27;s confusing? I just can&#x27;t see how you would
emulate any of {B,L,D,x,y,z} using &lt;u,r,f> because all those moves
move the BLD-corner and that&#x27;s not possible using &lt;u,r,f>.

I&#x27;ve changed my mind; only positions with even permutation are
solvable using &lt;u,r,f>. So emulating U, F or R is impossible.

I don&#x27;t have a proof (yet), but I&#x27;m confident.

I meant the positions where both corners and edges have even
permutation... So J-perm is impossible, etc.

Counter proof: u&#x27; is solvable by u and has odd permutations for both
corners and edges.

Sorry, I&#x27;m tired. In a way, the position reached after doing &quot;r&quot; does
have an odd permutation on edges and corners. But centers are off,
too, and this is closely related to that. When centers match with the
BLD-corner, edges and corners must have an even permutation or
otherwise it&#x27;s not solvable.

Ignore the edges. The permutation of corners+centers always stays 
even. Each quarter turn is a 4-cycle of corners and a 4-cycle of 
centers. So emulating U/F/R is impossible because that&#x27;d be a 4-cycle 
of corners only, and thus an odd permutation.

Thanks Macky, I had already forgotten about the keychain thread. I 
found it (or at least a part of it):
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/
15595

Btw, the reason I asked myself this was the current &quot;notation&quot; 
thread. I was thinking we could scramble even with &lt;u,r,f> only, at 
least the 3x3. So that would reduce the notation further. Yes I know 
that &lt;U,x,y> would be enough, but that would require long algorithms 
because at least every second &quot;move&quot; would have to be a cube 
rotation. I&#x27;m still interested in how long optimal solutions would be 
in &lt;u,r,f>.

I also wrote a scrambler a few months ago that first generated a 
normal scramble and then translated it to &lt;U,u,R,r,F,f> so that the 
end result would be the same scrambled cube (just probably the cube 
would be rotated as a whole). I thought this could make scrambling 
faster but it didn&#x27;t. Well, maybe I just didn&#x27;t practice it enough.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Doing a bunch of random PLLs on a solved cube will give you a fairly 
random PLL...

But also, if you do any alg enough times you get back to solved 
position. In the case of the PLLs, I think doing them 2 or 3 times 
will take you back to where you started.

You can also mix using only 3 types of turns, to preserve a 2x2 block, 
then solve as nomral to get to PLL step faster.

Are you trying to practice &#x27;recognization&#x27; or &#x27;execution&#x27; more?

All of the PLLs can be generated from the J-perm, U-perm, and U.<br>
<br>
If you apply these randomly, over and over again, you will eventually<br>
encounter the different PLLs.<br>
<br>
Once you figure out the generators for practicing a particular step,<br>
you can also use my generator tool for recognition or execution practice:<br>

Never happened to me before, but that&#x27;s a very interesting nightmare.
What makes the cube unsolvable? Is a piece mis-oriented? Does the cube
end up like with a single swap of corners or edges? Or did you just
forget?

I bought my tickets from http://www.kayak.com for about $715 and I&#x27;m
staying here: http://www.ginkgo.hu/

There are hotels in the area, in additional to the Novotel obviously,
if you check speedcubing.com, but if you&#x27;re on a tight budget this
hostel looks pretty reputable and it is affordable.

Hope that helps,
Chris

the cheapest flight.  Doing so usually will find you a price 5-10
dollars cheaper because they will offer the same flight without
charging a surcharge you pay with flight search engines.  I found a
flight out of NJ for around 600, so I was pretty content with it.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I just finished learning ZBF2L!  I&#x27;ve been working on learning this <br>
for the past 10 months, and it feels great to say I finally know all <br>
of it.  I will say that it wasn&#x27;t as hard as I thought it would be to <br>
learn, it just takes time.  I can also understand exactly how a lot <br>
of the algs work, so that made learning it easier as well.  My best <br>
average with ZBF2L + COLL/PLL is 12.97 seconds.  I think that with a <br>
lot of practice, sub 12 is possible with just ZBF2L.  I&#x27;m going to <br>
start learning ZBLL in a few weeks.  I want to give myself a small <br>
break from learning algs.  I hope to have ZBLL learned in two years.<br>
<br>
I want to thank a few people.  First, thanks to Chris Hardwick, since <br>
he was my inspiration to even begin learning ZB in the first place.  <br>
Thanks to Lars Vandenbergh, Chris Hardwick (again), Zbigniew <br>
Zborowski, and Bob Burton for their ZBF2L pages.  I got most of my <br>
algs from any of those sites.  Thanks to Ron van Bruchem for his Cube <br>
Solver program.  When I couldn&#x27;t find a case I liked on any of the <br>
aforementioned pages, Cube Solver was a great help.  Finally, thanks <br>
again to Zbigniew Zborowski and Ron van Bruchem for inventing such a <br>
beautiful method.<br>
<br>
ZBLL, here I come!<br>

advise for learning a ton of algs, like learn as many as you can in a
day and then just practice those for a while before learning more, or
learn a couple a day every day or what? What worked best for you?

I think it is 306 algs, not exactly sure.

Thanks Chris &amp; Bob. got my ticket. mine was more than yours, but
I&#x27;m late in planning and coming from Boise, so it is what it is.

Now I just need something to do for a couple of days after the
tournament. Anyone have suggestions for good places to travel to in
Hungary??

see you in Budapest!

          <div class="email-content">Well, it is essentially cheating but the latest release of my cube<br>
emulation puzzle had this feature until I decided to &quot;improve&quot; it. As<br>
everyone here knows cubes consist of three types of cubies: face,<br>
edge, and corner. It is fairly easy to choose to make one or more of<br>
these types invisible which produces some cubes of interesting design.<br>
However, I also implement to include all the naturally embedded cubes<br>
so the 3x3 has a 1x1 at its core. I had to slightly alter the code so<br>
the next layer down would be drawn in these situations which did away<br>
with the eerie hole in the middle effect. I think I&#x27;ll add in a way to<br>
easily convert from solid cube to shell cube because it really is a<br>
nice look. If anyone has a Mac and is interested in seeing the current<br>
effect it is available for free download at my web site: <br>
<br>
http://www.cubicityllc.com<br>
<br>
Watch for a minor update very soon to put back in that exact empty<br>
center appearance. It looks particularly cool on larger cubes where<br>
you only see the edges and corners. However, the larger cubes (of<br>
arbitrarily large size) are only available in the donation supported<br>
version.<br>

    Just wanted to take a moment to introduce myself, then ask a couple of<br>

    I have, like many of y&#x27;all, been cubing since the original Rubik&#x27;s Cube<br>
came out... For me, that was 7th grade... I actually worked out my own<br>
method for solving... In hindsight, I&#x27;m amazed I got to where I could<br>
consistently solve it in under a minute, because it was horribly<br>
inefficient... I relied tremendously on quick recognition and look-ahead<br>
while performing a permutation... Anyway, I got to where I was averaging<br>
just about 45 seconds or so... And like many others back then, I used WD-40<br>
or Vaseline for a Cube lube :)Never entered any contests, but it was a blast<br>
working on, since I love math, riddles and puzzles... Just seemed to fit<br>
together so well into those areas...<br>
    Now, with the re-emergence of the Cube in the public eye, I&#x27;ve really<br>
started digging into speed cubing... Will probably dig into my own methods<br>
and such later, but now I&#x27;m just working on finger tricks (which I never did<br>
before) and getting my average time down... I&#x27;ve started with the Fridrich<br>
method as a starting point, since it is somewhat similar to how I did my<br>
solutions back in the day... <br>
    My first question is, for those solving CFOP, what do you look at / for<br>
in your 15 second preview? Sequences? Cross only? Whatever? :)<br>
    The second question relates to blindfold cubing... I&#x27;ve got to where I<br>
can solve U blindfolded, but of course, that&#x27;s child&#x27;s play compared to the<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

First of all I think that we should not try to find a universal notation.
There is no notation that could work for all puzzles.

For 3x3 I propose the following notation:

U D F B L R: normal moves

First group of extensions:
&#x27; for counter clockwise moves
2 for half turn moves
2&#x27; half turn moves executed counter clockwise

Second group of extensions:
c for cube rotations (Rc is rotate cube similar to R move)
m for middle slice moves (Rm is middle slice similar to R move, currently 
defined as M&#x27;)
w for double moves (two slices at the same time, so Rw is the same as RRm)
s for slice moves (Rs=RL&#x27;)
a for anti slice moves (Ra = RL)

Third group of extensions:
() for performing the moves inside the parentheses as one finger trick
()n for performing the moves inside the parentheses n times
[] for cancelling out the moves inside the block if they can be combined 
with an earlier step of the solution

Second group goes before first group.
First group can be combined with second group.
Second group cannot be combined with second group.

Feedback is welcome. But please come with a counter proposal.

Thanks,

Ron

Hi :-)

I think limiting a standard notation solely for practical purposes
(speedcubing events) is a bit too short sighted. And how can one be
sure what events will occur at a future point of time? I personally
endorse the development of an official WCA cube notation that should
cover at least any regular sized (nxnxn) cube. Remove all ambiguity,
be intuitive, use commonly available symbols only. And WCA should
further encourage websites to comply with the official notation. This
would make life easier for a lot of people, not only those who attend
official WCA competitions.

          <div class="email-content">Hi again guys,

We also need a notation for 4x4 and 5x5.

They can be similar to the proposed 3x3 notation.
So Rm is the middle slice of a 5x5. And Rw are the two outer slices.

The only thing we need to add are the moves:
u d f b l r
They represent the inner slice of a side.

Currently WCA uses multislice notation for 4x4 and 5x5. Where r means 
technically R + inner slice R.
In the proposed notation it is written as Rw.

We could add another move for doing 3 layers at the same time, similar to 
RwRm on a 5x5.
Proposal: ww. So Rww is 3 right layers.

Feedback?

Have fun,

Ron

about the big cubes and double layers, I think lower case letter could remain meaning double layers...so r = 2 right layers

the inner R slice would be rR&#x27; or r&#x27;R...I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s too hard...

and 3 layer turns could be written as rRm...or rM&#x27;...I like the M, E and S...but Rm is fine too

My 1 cent (our currency is about 1/2 dollar ;P)

 We also need a notation for 4x4 and 5x5.
 
 They can be similar to the proposed 3x3 notation.
 So Rm is the middle slice of a 5x5. And Rw are the two outer slices.
 
 The only thing we need to add are the moves:
 u d f b l r
 They represent the inner slice of a side.
 
 Currently WCA uses multislice notation for 4x4 and 5x5. Where r means 
 technically R + inner slice R.
 In the proposed notation it is written as Rw.
 
 We could add another move for doing 3 layers at the same time, similar to 
 RwRm on a 5x5.
 Proposal: ww. So Rww is 3 right layers.
 
 Feedback?
 
 Have fun,
 
 Ron

we keep getting this msg in this forum. why don&#x27;t you first check older post first for any helpful information regarding one handed. if you still cant find what you are looking for ask again.

it would also be helpful to look for good one handed tip sites like that of chris from NY, not sure what the URL is...

          <div class="email-content">I have three cubes:<br>
<br>
Two 25th anniversary cubes, and one white DIY cube.<br>
<br>
The white DIY cube sucks. Even at its loosest, it turns at such an<br>
incredibly sluggish rate. Also, it turns in strange intervals, rather<br>
than in a smooth motion. Keeping the screws too loose results in the<br>
center caps not closing, and keeping them too tight results in it<br>
being too hard to turn. Sucks either way.<br>
<br>
The two 25th anniversary cubes also suck. I have substantially<br>
loosened them by putting salt in them (I don&#x27;t have sand) and turning<br>
them a bunch, then washing them.<br>
<br>
Lube has caused nothing but problems. I use a &quot;Gunk&quot; 100% silicone<br>
lubricant. The lube just creates a mucky mess that makes the cube<br>
harder to turn. This does not change after 20+ tries. I have given<br>
each application 30 minutes to dry, and I let all of it sit for more<br>
than an hour before putting it back together.<br>
<br>
The 25th anniversary cubes turn in very jerky movements. Once movement<br>
has initialized, they move very freely, but they take a little<br>
pressure to start turning. Thus, if I wanted to turn it a very small<br>
amount, it&#x27;s difficult because of their jerky motion. They have rivets<br>
under the center caps, not screws.<br>
<br>
Well, I&#x27;m out of options now. I want to know why this seems to work<br>
fine for everybody else, but ends up sucking for me. I think the lube<br>
I&#x27;m using is fine, and I don&#x27;t see how I could possibly get three<br>

Wait for about 10-15 minutes for the lube to dry.

          <div class="email-content">Hey

May I ask where you got your white DIY and what plastic quality it is?
This may be the problem with the DIY. Also, I believe anything even
near unscrewing the screws so far that the center caps doesn&#x27;t close,
is overly overly overly excessive. Turning accurately is more
important then having the &quot;perfect speedcube&quot;. I can average around
20-22 with a brand new store bought cube. Tuning your cube is totally
up to you, but the more you play with a cube, the better it gets.

You said you put salt inside your cube? This doesn&#x27;t sound like it
would help at all. If you want to sand your cube, I suggest taking it
apart and actually use sandpaper to grind down the edges. 

About your silicon, I have no experience with that brand, but you have
to work it in. Some silicon with initially make the plastic stick
together, making it very sticky when you turn it. If it is like that,
you have to &quot;work&quot; your silicon in. After I lubricate my cube, it
takes at least a week to be at it&#x27;s best. Before that, it is too
slippery.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, I use gunk yet my cube is pretty good.  Different types of lubes
and cubes go down to personal preference; I like gunk, a lot of people
don&#x27;t.

And it is quite possible that you just got 3 bad cubes.  Lots of cubes
are really bad; depending on where you got your DIY, that could affect
how you like it, and then getting 2 bad 25th&#x27;s isn&#x27;t that unlikely.

          <div class="email-content">Interesting idea, but I think it puts too much pressure on the competitor
during inspection. The way we do it at the moment for inspection means that
the competitor only has to listen out for the judge&#x27;s instruction. The rest
of the competitor&#x27;s concentration can be devoted to actually inspecting the
cube.

If the competitor has to focus on the timer during inspection, even if only
for the last 5 seconds, then they&#x27;ll end up breaking their concentration for
those 5 seconds (by constantly looking at the timer so as to avoid
&#x27;inspection&#x27; penalty), or they&#x27;ll end up forcing themselves to finish
inspection early &#x27;to be safe&#x27; from an inspection penalty.

For these reasons, I&#x27;d prefer to keep it as is.

is not something to can be timed to the precision of hundredths.  That is
why inspection is timed only to the second.  You can&#x27;t distinguish between

          <div class="email-content">The precision is not the issue in my opinion. The issue is to make 
it easier for the judge to determine if the competitor has exceeded 
his 15 s or not.

And yes, it puts more responsibility on the competitor. But less 
pressure on the judge to rule no penalty, +2 s penalty or 
disqualification.

Hi Dan,

I&#x27;m a bit late, but I didn&#x27;t know about your suggestion.
A common notation is good, but I can see different purpose.

In your document, you mention fingertricks. I understand that people
want a grand unified notation to share tricks and sequences efficiently.
But is it the role of the WCA to decide such things? Why not PLL
labeling? ;-)

As Stefan answered, an official notation is useful in competitions for 2
things: Scrambling and judging fewest-moves. I really don&#x27;t think we can
find a good general purpose notation, so let&#x27;s focus on these 2 points.

1) Scrambling

The notation we have is ok for now, but it has to be described in the
regulations.
- U, D, L, R, F, B for clockwise outer layer turns.
- u, d, l, r, f, b for clockwise 2-layer turns (4^3 and 5^3 only).
- &quot;&#x27;&quot; and &quot;2&quot; suffixes.
(no need for repetitions, since normal scrambles must be used for
fewest-moves events)

2) Fewest moves

Making fewest-moves competitions more practical is required.
You know that sophisticated notations already lead to confusion in the
past and that it&#x27;s a long task for a judge to check many solutions. So,
my first thought is we should stick to a very simple notation (see
above: UDLRFB+&quot;&#x27;&quot;+&quot;2&quot;).
I make heavy use of inner-slice moves, but the fewest-moves metric is a
cut-plane metric, so inner-slice moves are not welcome (and not really
useful).
Cube rotations are theoretically not required (I don&#x27;t use them, I
prefer to write easy to read solutions:
http://grrroux.free.fr/belgique2007/my_fmc.JPG), but we need them to
avoid heavy translations (color scheme to UDLRFB for example, see
Stefan&#x27;s post).
How should we call rotations. Rc, PR, x? Personally I don&#x27;t care, but
xyz is confusing for newbies.
The most important thing is we need an *official solution checker*, like
Cube Companion, that checks for validity and computes solution length.
Charles, would you create a modified Cube Companion that fits WCA needs?
With such a tool, even clueless organizers may propose a fewest-moves
event.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">It would be more difficult for the judge to call out when 10 seconds
are up using the stackmat, since it&#x27;s difficult to see the timer from
the side. Also, with a generation 1 stackmat, the timer is on the
right edge, so if the judge is on the left side of the competitor,
he&#x27;d have to look around the competitor to check the time during the
inspection. It&#x27;s easier for the judge to use a stopwatch.

And what Tyson&#x27;s saying is that it doesn&#x27;t really matter if the
competitor exceeds his 15 seconds by .01 seconds... that&#x27;s why the 2
second penalty is after 16 seconds anyway.

But if we did end up using a stackmat to time the inspection, we
should probably use a stopwatch too for the judges&#x27; convenience.

          <div class="email-content">My white cube is my best by far.  I got mine from Ed&#x27;s Thinkshop 
before he closed.  I haven&#x27;t bought from any other places, but if you 
can find a grade &quot;a&quot; white cube that seems to be one of the fastest 
and smoothest.  I&#x27;ve never used anniversary cubes personally.  The 
lube that I use is silicone spray and I take my cube apart and spray 
each piece on all sides and let it sit until dry and then give each 
piece a quick rubdown to remove any excess and then rebuild.  After 
about a day of screwing around with it the cube is generally fairly 
fast.  For tune-up lubing I would suggest getting 80 weight &quot;Shock 
Oil&quot; which you can buy at many hobby shops in the RC car sections.  A 
few drops works pretty well.

Now that Ed is closed and I&#x27;m sure many of the people in this group 
have bought from him, who would you all recommend for DIY kits?  
Puzzleproz, CubeforU, Cubefans, etc?

Thanks and hope that helps though I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve been given all the 
advice before by now.

          <div class="email-content">Just to add my input to this. I think that using stackmat for timing 
preinspection is a terrible idea. Mainly, it would confuse the heck 
out of the general audience. And secondly, is the point here - that 
it would be tough for the judge to call the &#x27;5 seconds remaining&#x27; 
warning.

          <div class="email-content">Really? Nobody wants to discuss this in the WCA forum, even though 
Anders provided the link? Ok, then I&#x27;ll add my comment here as well 
so you guys don&#x27;t miss it.

It has been suggested to simplify the starting procedure. Basically 
the judge wouldn&#x27;t interrupt us anymore like he does now. From start 
of inspection to end of solve the judge only watches, while the 
competitor can inspect and then solve on his own, like we do at home. 
I&#x27;m a strong advocate for this.

http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=937#937
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=180

With Anders&#x27; suggestion the competitor would have to get an &quot;Ok (I 
saw your inspection time)&quot; signal and thus the competitor must again 
interact with the judge, which I don&#x27;t like. I as a competitor want 
to focus solely on the cube, not at all on the judge, and I certainly 
don&#x27;t want an unnecessary interruption between inspection and solve.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Maybe I should explain why I got the idea of using the stackmat 
timer for the inspection time.  The first reason was to provide a 
more objective and traceable measure of the inspection time. When 
using a stopwatch, I find that the judging of +2 s penalty or 
disqualification is rather subjective and non-trivial for the judge. 
Furthermore, the competitor can easily challenge the decision of the 
judge. With a timer that is controlled by the competitor, the time 
used for the inspection will be measured in an indisputable manner. 
(This point towards a related issue: How strict should the rules of 
using more than 15 s inspection time be implemented?)

Another reason was to minimise the interaction between the judge and 
the competitor, which is done if the competitor himself take care of 
the timing. In my original thoughts, the judge should be quiet 
during the whole inspection time, but later I thought it would be 
better if the judge announced when five seconds are left of the 
inspection time (rule A3d1).

Another minor issue is when the competitor puts down the cube and 
apparently stops inspecting before 15 s has passed. The judge has 
difficulties to interpret the situation. Should the judge directly 
cover the cube or should he wait until the 15 s has passed? If using 
the stackmat timer, the inspection is over when the competitor stops 
the timer.

People are strange (or lazy ;) Thus, I also make double posts.

Well, the interaction does not necessary be so strong here. If the 
judge looks at the display, he can see the inspection time and does 
not need to give the competitor an OK. He just observe.

into problems...mostly about the first 2 layers. I&#x27;m averaging about<br>
40-45 seconds on my rubik&#x27;s 3x3, I have it pretty loose so that<br>
doesn&#x27;t seem to be slowing me down. My F2L time is averaging about<br>
30-35 seconds, and I know all my PLLs and most of the OLLs, LL in<br>
general is 8-10 seconds. I was wondering how far y&#x27;all look ahead in<br>
the inspection phase, do you look past how to do the cross? I&#x27;m not<br>
sure of the correct term, but when placing the corners on the F2L do<br>
you keep the cube stationary, that is to say, do you rotate the cube,<br>
or solve all 4 corners from the same angle? also do you memorize<br>
certain algs when placing the corners, or is it truly intuitive?(just<br>
to clarify I do match the corners with their edges and place them<br>
together, what I gather is called intuitive F2L?)just wondering if you<br>
had some feedback for a newbie...thanks!<br>

I don&#x27;t see how this minimises (or even reduces) the interaction.

Yeah, I agree.

I don&#x27;t usually have strong opinions about changes to the rules, but I
really think this suggestion increases the distraction for the
competitor during inspection. The way we do it at the moment means the
competitor can leave their eyes focused on the cube for the whole
inspection.

It has been a while since we have seen each other. I keep going to all those

Hi Dan,

Unfortunately I had to give that mobile back when I left the UK. :( I&#x27;ve
just emailed you a different mobile we&#x27;ll have while over there.

If anyone else wants the number, let me know and I&#x27;ll email you.

See you in Budapest!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Bernett!

Yes I am very much looking forward to meeting you and your Dad when 
you arrive!  Both of you were very big inspirations to me to learn to 
improve my memory, and I am very excited to meet you both!

I paid HUF at the hostel when I arrived, and I think the receptionist 
said she could accept Euros as well.  There is a bank very close to 
here where I withdrew money from my account.

Also Tyson, the exchange rate is actually pretty good for USD.  Things 
do not cost a lot compared to the same things in the US.  After I 
withdrew some money from an ATM in Forints I checked my balance from 
my bank and I am getting roughly 176-177 Forints to the Dollar.

By the way the money changers in the airport charge a roughly 10% 
commission, so only change enough money there to get to where you need 
to go by airport shuttle or taxi or somethig.  Withdraw the money you 
need to get around in the city from a bank or ATM.  There you will 
only be charged a small fee for using the ATM, same is in the US when 
using your ATM card at a bank that is not yours.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, ATM is pretty much always the way to go. Peter and I travel quite
a lot and we always just get local currency from an ATM. Chris - that
exchange rate you are getting from the ATM (176-177HUF to 1USD) is very
good! Happy to hear this.

So, who else is staying at the conference hotel (Novotel Congress)?
Everyone who&#x27;s mentioned their accommodation here has said they are
staying somewhere else!

How are people transporting their cube lube with them?  You can&#x27;t carry it on the plane because it&#x27;s liquid and/or flammable...  Just curious.

 I arrived in Budapest today, and am staying at the Ginkgo hostel.  
 It&#x27;s a really neat place, and to all the others staying here I think 
 you&#x27;ll like it.  The staff is very friendly and the other people 
 staying here that I&#x27;ve met so far seem very friendly too.
 
 If anyone arrives early let me know, maybe we can get together for 
 some sightseeing.
 
 Also Frank, if you get this sorry I missed you at the airport.  My 
 plane ended up being delayed and landed about an hour and a half later 
 than I expected.  Sorry if you had to wait for me, but I didn&#x27;t have a 
 way to get in touch with you.  Hope to see you soon, and sorry if you 
 had to wait!
 
 See you all soon in Budapest!
 Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey Pedro,

I took the airport &quot;Minibus&quot;.  It goes direct to the Ginkgo hostel.  
Also the ATM is just the automated machine at the bank where you get 
your money.  I think it stands for Automated Teller Machine 
technically.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, as Chris said, ATM = automatic teller machine. We regularly just
call them ATMs in many many countries. You may have a different name for
them?

BTW, I&#x27;ve been to Budapest before, and I easily got cash out of the wall
using my Australian visa card, so you should be fine. I&#x27;ve used my
Australian visa card in many countries around the world and it&#x27;s been
great. Also, I always get a better exchange rate at an ATM with my visa
card than I&#x27;d ever get at a currency exchange place.

I just noticed the table can be sorted by any column, so by sorting 
by &quot;Where are you staying&quot; the persons are grouped by that.

Well, ideally more people would enter their data, and write just the 
ho(s)tel name in standard format in that column... sigh.

Cheers!

 I&#x27;m not sure how much email/internet access we&#x27;ll have in the week leading
 up to the competition.
 
 We&#x27;re arriving in Budapest in the afternoon on 3 October, and we&#x27;re staying
 at the competition hotel (Novotel Budapest Congress).
 
 Looking forward to seeing everyone soon!! :D
 
 Jasmine

Especially when its web page is rubikscuberecord.com for the price 
of a peanut. Especially when its first one tv bilndfolded faker or 
not on this web. Especially when the best cuber official 3x3x3 is 
adolescent, average speed or blindfolded. 

Very fun

I and my brother, Kåre, are staying at the conference hotel. We will
arrive on wednesday evening. I guess I will recognize a lot of faces
when I get there. It will of course be nice to meet all you cubers I
haven&#x27;t met before too. 

I&#x27;m happy to see that there are so many cubers registered. This will
be a fantastic competition, I&#x27;m sure.

I know this might be a little late, as some people are already at Budapest, but...<br>

does anybody (preferably from the US, as it would make the price lower) have an &quot;extra&quot; stackmat timer or one that you could sell to me at the competition?<br>

 I think being in 8th grade has something to do with it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I was in Budapest in June. Sadly i cannot go this time :-(

The best way to get a taxi is to call City Taxi, also do this from 
the airport. If you just take a taxi outside the terminal you will 
pay a lot more than needed...

City Taxi = 36(1) 347-8062 

The best way to waste money on taxi is to get the hotel lobby to book 
the taxi for you ;-) Call yourself! They speak ok english :-)

To get around town just use tram or metro. Cheap and fast. Buy a 
multi-day ticket to save even more !! These tickets and a useful 
transportation map is available from all metro stations at least.

Happy Buvös Kocka :D

 I took the airport &quot;Minibus&quot;.  It goes direct to the Ginkgo hostel.  
 Also the ATM is just the automated machine at the bank where you get 
 your money.  I think it stands for Automated Teller Machine 
 technically.

if it works, can I pay you in Euros? I think I&#x27;ll just take Euros with me for Budapest...no reason to carry dollars too...

so, is it fine for you? (1 euro = ~1.42 dollar, so if it was 30 dollars, that would be about 21 euros)

could you message me privately?

thanks again

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

If you hand carry your lubricant it must be smaller than 100 ml and 
be contained in a seal(ed|able) plastic bag. Furthermore it should 
not be explosive, toxic or flammable (the usual tags).

However i would say it&#x27;s quite safe to carry any silicone spray in 
the check-in luggage. Particularly inside the toiletries. But of 
course this is at your own risk!!

 &gt; Hi :-)<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; If you hand carry your lubricant it must be smaller than 100 ml<br>
and<br>
 &gt; be contained in a seal(ed|able) plastic bag. Furthermore it should<br>
 &gt; not be explosive, toxic or flammable (the usual tags).<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt; However i would say it&#x27;s quite safe to carry any silicone spray in<br>
 &gt; the check-in luggage. Particularly inside the toiletries. But of<br>
 &gt; course this is at your own risk!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,

I arrived in Budapest this afternoon and went to the Novotel Congress. I
was extremely UNIMPRESSED to be told that even though I had booked and
PAID for the hotel back in August, they were full and told me to go
elsewhere (or rather, they were offering to organise for me to go
elsewhere). Apparently there is some other big conference there which is
more important to the Novotel than our cubing championships, so they are
telling some cubers they can&#x27;t stay at the Novotel today and possibly
tomorrow (regardless of whether you had booked and paid well in
advance).

BTW, Peter and I are not the only ones affected by this. The Novotel
told us about 10 bookings were being moved &#x27;elsewhere&#x27; (but not all to
the same place, the Novotel gave us a choice of which other hotel to
use).

So, Peter and I are at the Mercure Buda tonight (was the 2nd choice
hotel on speedcubing.com). The Novotel promised that we can move back to
the Novotel Congress later. I&#x27;m extremely annoyed about this, and will
be even more annoyed if they don&#x27;t sort it out asap!! Especially since
they were perfectly happy to charge the FULL stay to my credit card
weeks ago!! Surely they would have known weeks ago if there was a clash
with another big conference!!! BTW, in case you are wondering, the
Novotel is paying for our stay at the Mercure since we had already paid
the Novotel in full for our stay.

without your silicone spray? Are you lubing them the day of the
competition? Scramblers don&#x27;t tend to like that.

solves on video today, and i put two of them up on youtube.  I think<br>
one is like 2:15 and the other is 2:25 or so.  What i think most of<br>
you will find interesting is i use K4 for my method.  The 2:15 was<br>
kind of lucky in the last step, i only had to do one commutator<br>
(instead of my normal three) but it was still a legit solve.  <br>

 One of the fastest methods I know is to only use this scramble: U&#x27;  <br>
<br>
 If the scramble is more complex you might consider learning a method<br>
and the ones (yes, plural) that are considered fastest at this moment<br>
are called Fridrich/CFOP, Roux, Petrus<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to congratulate everybody with their great results at the <br>
WC07 in Budapest, especially Yu Nakajima and Mátyás Kuti!! And of <br>
course my Dutch friend Erik for doing so well on Megaminx, 4x4 and <br>
feet! :)<br>
<br>
I myself had a great competition. I don&#x27;t think I could have done <br>
any better in the 3x3 finals... The finals were great, and many <br>
people did such great averages!! It was really exciting, and that is <br>
what makes the sport so much fun.<br>
<br>
I would also like to make a small note about my website:<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll have to move my website to a different location soon. Soon, <br>
there will only be a blank page. I&#x27;ll try to find a decent host <br>
soon, and my site will be back with pics from Budapest at some <br>
point, but it might take some time.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows a good reliable hosts that supports php, drop me a <br>
line, please.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

          <div class="email-content">After having discussing with some cubers at the WC, I understood<br>
that my multislotting file wasn&#x27;t clear enough, so I propose a new<br>
exercise here : The F2L Fewest move challenge:D<br>
<br>
How proceed : Just scramble your cube as usual an try to build<br>
your F2L with the Fridrich method (Cross + 4 Pairs). The only rule is<br>
that the first step of your method who matches one of fridrich one&#x27;s<br>
must be the cross ( No extended cross allowed).<br>
<br>
You can : Solve the cross while solving ONE piece from a F2L pair<br>
Solve the cross while preparing ONE F2L pair<br>
<br>
The idea is to work on pair during the transition times, that was<br>
the goal of multislotting.<br>
<br>
I offer here a few example of what it could be.<br>
<br>
Scramble 1 : L&#x27; R&#x27; F2 U2 L2 B2 U&#x27; B&#x27; F D2 L2 F&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; U2 D2 L2 D L<br>
B&#x27; R D B F2<br>
<br>
Solve :<br>
<br>
L&#x27; F D R&#x27; D : Solve DF, DL and DR edges + adjust D layer for the<br>
DB edge<br>
U : Prepare FL pair<br>
L&#x27; D&#x27; : Solve cross ( 8 moves )<br>
L&#x27; U&#x27; L : Solve FL pair ( 11 moves )<br>
R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 : Prepare FR pair considering BL pair<br>
R U2 R2 U R : Solve FR pair and prepare BL pair ( 20 moves )<br>
U2 L U L&#x27; : Solve BL pair and prepare BR pair ( 24 moves )<br>
U2 B U B&#x27; : Solve F2L ( 28 moves )<br>
<br>
5 moves/pair<br>
<br>
Scramble 2: D L2 D2 L2 B L2 U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L2 R2 B2 L D2 L&#x27; R2 F2 U R2 L&#x27; U2<br>
L&#x27; B2 U&#x27; F<br>
<br>
Solve :<br>
<br>
L&#x27; D L&#x27; B&#x27; : Solve DB, DR and DL edges<br>
U&#x27; : Prepare BL pair<br>
B&#x27; D2 : Solve cross ( 7 moves )<br>
U B&#x27; U&#x27; B : Solve BL pair ( 11 moves )<br>
U&#x27; L&#x27; B U B&#x27; L : Solve BR pair ( 16 moves )<br>
D F&#x27; U2 F D&#x27; : Solve FR pair and break FL pair ( 21 moves )<br>
L&#x27; U L U L&#x27; U&#x27; L: Solve F2L ( 28 moves )<br>
<br>
5.25 moves/pair<br>
<br>
Scramble 3 : D&#x27; L&#x27; F2 B L&#x27; F2 L&#x27; B2 R2 F D&#x27; F2 D2 L2 B&#x27; R U L&#x27; D B2 U<br>
D&#x27; L2 U&#x27; L&#x27;<br>
<br>
Solve:<br>
<br>
F&#x27; B D2 L&#x27; : Solve DL, DF and DR edges<br>
U&#x27; : Prepare FR pair<br>
L&#x27; D&#x27; : Solve cross ( 7 moves )<br>
U&#x27; R U R&#x27; : Solve FR Pair ( 11 moves )<br>
L U R&#x27; U2 L&#x27; U R: Solve BL pair considering BR pair ( 18 moves )<br>
D2 U2 F U2 F&#x27; D2: Solve FL pair and prepare BR pair ( 24 moves )<br>
U B U B&#x27; : Solve F2L ( 28 moves )<br>
<br>
5.25 moves/pair<br>
<br>
Does someone has any other idea for those scrambles or for new ones?<br>
<br>
Thats is what I&#x27;ve called multislotting a few years ago, but I saw<br>
that my multislotting file on this forum wasn&#x27;t clear enough. Thanks<br>
to dennis Nilsson, we now have a clear website explaining the basic<br>
ideas<br>

Arguably, the most challenging was the blind events, where competitors<br>
studied puzzles, donned blindfolds, and solved cubes by memory. Matyas Kuti,<br>
14, of home nation Hungary stunned the Rubik&#x27;s community by solving 18<br>
successive cubes while blindfolded over a span of just 46 minutes (he was<br>
able to take off his blindfold between puzzles and briefly study each new<br>
cube): a performance that tournament spokesperson Ray Hodges hailed as a<br>
work of &quot;genius.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know how they got that.  It was 15 cubes, and yeah, he was much<br>
better, by orders of magnitudes, than what they describe here.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Masayuki,

I guarantee you we are not teasing him.  This was on the first night that we
arrived.  None of us speak Japanese and Macky was not around to translate.
To make matters worse, Japanese font was not installed on the Hungarian
computers at the hotel so I could not google translate.  Toby was racing
Mitsuki, Yu Nakajima, and a few other cubers from Japan and we couldn&#x27;t
really communicate, so Toby started communicating by what he knows best:
YouTube videos.

It was an amazingly stunning moment that night, when Toby and Mitsuki were
able to connect through something as silly as a YouTube video.  I will never
forget it.  Language can be such a difficult barrier to cross, and it was
nothing short of a precious golden moment to be treasured forever as cubers
from the United States and Japan shared a long hearty laugh.  This may be my
most treasured moment from my entire experience in Budapest.

The e-mail sent from my account was actually sent by both me and Mitsuki.  I
figured it was difficult for non-English cubers to communicate to this group
so I opened up my gmail, typed in the address, wrote &#x27;says hi&#x27;, and Mitsuki
typed his name.  It was a way for me to learn his name as well since I
didn&#x27;t know how to ask him his name as I don&#x27;t speak Japanese.

I realize the e-mail and thread is filled with inside jokes, but I was
incredibly impressed at our ability to communicate despite not knowing a
single word of each other&#x27;s language.  It shows the power of the cube in
connecting all of us, and I am very fortunate to come back to the United
States having made new friends from all around the world.

-Tyson

          <div class="email-content">Tell me about it.
Once I did an interview for the local paper and before putting it in
they mailed me and asked to check it. They noted about all facts down
wrong. Even after I corrected them there were still things in it that
embarrase me. I told them there was a japanese 2x2 cuber who was very
fast but who was not yet at a competition and they put in it that he
is a cheater or something. Press suck and never listen well to what
you say....

I&#x27;m a speedcuber for almost 2 years now, and I&#x27;m studying journalism at the moment in Brussels.
In the near future, belgian articles about speedcubing will be 100% correct. :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I just successfully completed the 6x6x6 blindfolded tonight after three tries over the <br>
course of the championships.  Many thanks to Frank for letting me use his 6x6x6 cube  for <br>
the attempts.  The first try I was off by a couple centers and edges.  It looked like I had <br>
done an extra U turn at some point as well as an incorrect center cycle or two.  For the <br>
second attempt it looked like I was only off by a setup move somewhere in the middle.  <br>
For the third and successful solve I memorized in 1 hour 3 minutes and the total time was <br>
1:48:52.93<br>
<br>
I used exactly the same method as I would use for 5x5x5 except that there are now 4 <br>
center orbits, 2 wing orbits, and the corners.<br>
<br>
I have to say thanks to Frank for letting me use his 6x6x6 for these attempts, and many <br>
thanks to Daniel Beyer, Matyas, Dror, Stefan, Marcus, and the many other blindfolded <br>
cubers who inspire me to get better.<br>
<br>
I will post the pictures on my site when I get back from Hungary, but for now I was too <br>
excited and had to post.<br>
<br>
Also many, many thanks to Panayiotis Verdes of Olympicubes for inventing such a fantastic <br>
puzzle.  It was incredibly stable and easy to use for the purpose of blindfolded cubing as <br>
well as speed solving.<br>
<br>
Happy BLD cubing everyone,<br>
Chris<br>

          <div class="email-content">It may be possible to get software for other layouts. I have an iPAQ
with a touch screen which comes with Qwerty as default. However, I&#x27;ve
installed Fitaly and never use Qwerty on it. FYI, Fitaly is yet another
keyboard layout - it is optimised for single-point entry. See
http://www.fitaly.com/ and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITALY if you
are interested.

  Stretch your wrist.  Several times a day through out it.  Only stretch it until it hurts/stretches a little.  I used to get carpul tunnel pains a lot from typing and video games(before i cubed).  Stretching the wrist backwards and forwards on a regular basis as kept the pain from getting any more then being a little uncomfortable.<br>
Prob wanna take a break from cubing until you get back to your normal self as well.<br>

You are learning algs from my site? That is great!

I should confess, that allthough I&#x27;ve been pressing you to learn new

I&#x27;m not sure about your problem, but I had a similar problem.

For most of last year (spring of last year until spring of this year),
I had a lot of pain and loss of mobility in the DIP joint of my left
index finger.  That&#x27;s the joint next to the fingertip.  I can&#x27;t
remember if the pain started with an injury to the finger or built up
gradually.  As a result of this problem, I wasn&#x27;t able to cube nearly
as much as I would have liked to.

I went to my doctor who tried putting it in a splint for a few weeks
to see if it would heal up.  It didn&#x27;t, so I went to a hand
specialist.  He said that my primary doctor hadn&#x27;t left the splint on
for long enough, so he gave me another splint to wear (I think it was
for 6-8 weeks).  This also didn&#x27;t help.  It was pretty funny when
people asked me why I was wearing a splint.  They would think I was
joking when I said it was from too much Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  I went back to
the hand specialist, and he gave me a steroid injection in the joint.
Over the next 2-3 weeks, the finger got a lot better.  It&#x27;s not quite
as flexible as the corresponding joint on my right hand, but the pain
is gone, and I&#x27;m back to cubing without problems.

I agree with Corwin&#x27;s advice on your problem.

David

          <div class="email-content">Hi, I&#x27;ve tried to turn everything to the max and I tried on 2 
computers, but the result is the same.
But I&#x27;ve noticed that the pc timer now recognizes when I turn on my

Unfortunately not when I press the reset button or when the stackmat 
starts or is stopped. :(
I don&#x27;t know what to do with this CCT timer...
Any help?

Very impressive. Congratulations, Chris!

I saw most of you first attempt in the hotel lobby in Hungary and I
was pretty amazed that you almost solved it then.

I&#x27;m also happy that I got to try the 7x7 finally. My time was
16:04.95. Thanks to Frank Morris for lending me the cube.

at the WC07 in Budapest i tested my new solution for the 4x4. its <br>
special for roux solvers. so the beginning and the end are exactly like <br>
the 3x3 roux-solution. its written in german and in english.<br>
at home i had a best of 1:35 with this method, but i think its possible <br>
to get times around 1min.<br>
so if your interested in it, test it and send me mails if you have more <br>
ideas or if my english is not right (i&#x27;ve never written in english <br>

It&#x27;s a real shame, you told me that you didnt bring the 6x6 or 7x7

I know I need algs on paper if I&#x27;m going to learn them.

:/

I saved Joel&#x27;s PLL page locally as well as soon as I Joel said it might
be down for a while. I&#x27;ve also got Dan H&#x27;s printable OLL and PLL pages
saved to my iPAQ. :)

16-year-old Hungarian, Matyas Kuti, has been crowned the Rubik&#x27;s Cube World<br>
Champion, needing an average of 12.48 seconds to solve the puzzle. Kuti not<br>
only scored well in the 4x4 and 5x5 categories, but also did well<br>
blindfolded.<br>
<br>
However, the honour of the fastest-solved cube goes to Yu Nakajima, who<br>
needed just 10.88 seconds to solve the classic 3x3 puzzle, falling just<br>
short of the world record by a little more than a second.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
So... look for Matyas during the Nobel Prize ceremony because of his ability<br>
to travel forward in time 2 years.<br>

seconds beats 10.88 seconds!

Unfortunately for Dan H, most of the news articles have quoted the 10.88
second solve as the fastest of the competition. Don&#x27;t worry, Dan, I know
yours was the fastest solve, I was watching it! :)

Likewise. It looks like every Worlds is better than the last one. Too 
bad I couldn&#x27;t be there, I&#x27;m setting my hopes on either the next one 
or a US open to attend.

I&#x27;d love to meet the new fast guys Yu Nakajima and Mátyás Kuti and 
many others too! They are an inspiration to all of us.

good luck to everyone preparing for the next one

Almost correct. Yu Nakajima did indeed get a sub 13 average, but 
13.04 (or 13.05 with a fast single time) would&#x27;ve still been enough 
to beat second place Andrew Kang.

On the other hand, if your &quot;you&quot; referred to Tyson specifically (you 
replied to his message) then you were correct.

Cheers!
Stefan

Maybe there were some reporters in Budapest who just liked going to 
Budapest for work, and didn&#x27;t give a f*** about the cubes. :)

                It is a nice feeling to have met you in Budapest. Thank you so much for giving me your 555 stickers. It is a special and lucky one for me!!!<br>
                The most I enjoyed in wc-2007 is 555 finals. I was confident that I could reach finals before the world cup. It was very nice and stiff competition 6 finalists finished sub 2 min(including me). I felt great when I raced with the 555 world greats - you, Ookusa, Fredrick, Ron, Matyas, Erik, Milan, Yugi et all.<br>
                However, I did not correct/learn my mistakes in edge pairing up, as you were busy yourself. Could you explain/teach/correct my mistakes so that I can improve further.<br>

(speed)cubing. Many journalists dont care about checking facts and 
background. They have their &quot;angle&quot; and that&#x27;s all they care :-(

          <div class="email-content">Don&#x27;t really know what to say here. Cross solving comes with 
practice, and that&#x27;s about it. Maybe a good idea would be to stick 
with a single cross color, and sit down and don&#x27;t start solving until 
you DO see how to solve it in 7 moves. Don&#x27;t care about the 15 
seconds at first, just sit and stare the cube down until you see it. 
Then close your eyes and do it. Rinse and repeat.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
King Ho Wong, whom many of you met in Budapest, wrote a nice 4-page <br>
story on the championship and me, which may be found in todays DN <br>
newspaper, for those of you with access to norwegian newspapers (and <br>
who can understand norwegian, surely). If I figure a way to scan it <br>
I&#x27;ll do that, and translate it for you as well.<br>
<br>
I also participated in a talkshow yesterday, friday night even. Not <br>
for long, but I got to answer a few questions and solve the cube on <br>
TV. Clip may be found here: http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/109997<br>
<br>
Still in norwegian of course, but at least there&#x27;s some cubing action <br>
going on. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

I am working very hard at finding a loctaion still to have a 
competition on the East coast in Virginia. Things are looking good 
for a room at a Best Western. I need my brother to check out the room 
before I agree to it. If this is the location then things will work 
out just fine. The room holds about 50-55 people hopefully this is 
big enough for our competition. If this is the room that I am getting 
it will be about $300 for the room so there will be a charge for the 
competition. Hope to see some of you there.

Why I am called a champion? Well, I am a champion of the cube since 
I can solve it! (and yes, I beat one Vanhala ! ;)

I met Miss Sweden (see photosection, album &quot;Puctures from Sweden&quot;)

<br>
Well, speed TETRIS is actually the next thing on my agenda :-)<br>
<br>
I have also been thinking about a TETRIS/Rubik&#x27;s cube hybrid game,<br>
where you have a falling cube, with missing pieces/holes in it, and as<br>
the cube is falling, you need to rotate and twist it into a shape that<br>
will fit best with the uneven shape of the ground.<br>

&gt; Hey guys,<br>

&gt; King Ho Wong, whom many of you met in Budapest, wrote a nice 4-page <br>
&gt; story on the championship and me, which may be found in todays DN <br>
&gt; newspaper, for those of you with access to norwegian newspapers (and <br>
&gt; who can understand norwegian, surely). If I figure a way to scan it <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ll do that, and translate it for you as well.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I also participated in a talkshow yesterday, friday night even. Not <br>
&gt; for long, but I got to answer a few questions and solve the cube on <br>
&gt; TV. Clip may be found here: http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/109997<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Still in norwegian of course, but at least there&#x27;s some cubing action <br>
&gt; going on. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I would also like to add my congratulations to the champions in the<br>
various competitions (so like, 5 times to Matyas??) and to the<br>
finalists. I very much enjoyed meeting many new (and fast!) cubers as<br>
well as those from WC05 and 03.<br>
<br>
&gt;From the results of the 3x3 speedsolve, I am compelled make some<br>
observations. I am surprised that no one has made a post about this; I<br>
know I&#x27;m not the only one who has been thinking in this direction.<br>
<br>
Of the 16 finalists, I would say that half or more had at least some<br>
chance of winning the competition (of course, some had a greater<br>
chance than others). Yu Nakajima also led the second round in average,<br>
but his 14.54 in the first round shows that he can have a relatively<br>
slow average on a bad round. Andrew Kang had a 15.84 first round and<br>
Mitsuki Gunji, too, finished the second round with a 14.92. With one<br>
more second on any solve that counts in the average, Mitsuki wouldn&#x27;t<br>
even have made the final. At the other, unlucky end are Jean Pons, who<br>
had a 12.48 in the first round but just missed the podium in the<br>
final, and Edouard Chambon, Thibaut Jacquinot, and Harris Chan, who<br>
have all shown themselves to be a better cuber than me but who did not<br>
perform their best in the final. Had luck played out differently, we<br>
could have seen a very different final ranking.<br>
<br>
The problem is that being the best just means that you have a greater<br>
chance of winning the competition than anybody else, not that you are<br>
going to win it. Suppose Yu had made a few mistakes, and suppose I had<br>
some U permutations and had gotten a sub-13 average, which is very<br>
possible. I would have won the competition by luck. You would have had<br>
a most unwilling champion, apologizing to both the Japanese and the<br>
French and desperately explaining to the media that it was a fluke<br>
(not that most of them would have cared). With there having been a<br>
pretty realistic possibility of something like this happening, we<br>
should be happy that Yu, a cuber we can agree is one of the very<br>
fastest in the world, won the competition.<br>
<br>
I like World Championships because they give us a good measure of the<br>
current level of the top cubers, but I&#x27;m becoming more and more<br>
uncomfortable with the idea of the title of &quot;World Champion.&quot; Simply<br>
because of the role that luck plays in speedcubing, that title means<br>
just that the cuber who holds it won the World Championship, not<br>
necessarily that he is the best in the world, as it is usually taken<br>
to imply by the media. If no method that improves on Fridrich is<br>
discovered, in two years there will be even more clustering at the<br>
top. The difference between first and tenth may even be the luck on<br>
the permutations. Are five solves in the final round of one<br>
competition, world championship though it may be, enough to choose the<br>
World Champion for the next two years...the one cuber that, thanks to<br>
the media, will be best known by the non-cubers around the world as<br>
presumably the best cuber in the world?<br>
<br>
In any case, I know we have to choose a World Champion based on just<br>
the results of the World Championship (or is there some sport where<br>
the world champion is not the winner of the world championship?).<br>
Somebody has suggested using all solves from a competition to<br>
determine the overall ranking separate from the ranking in the final<br>
round, and there are also other ideas that I know some people have. I<br>
understand that it&#x27;s difficult to change the system we already have,<br>
but I find this important enough that it should at least be given a<br>
discussion.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s obvious that no single competition is enough to determine who the<br>
best cuber is. The World Championship should not be thought of as the<br>
competition to determine the best cuber but the competition to decide<br>
the World Champion, no more.<br>
<br>
How, then, can we best determine the best cuber during a certain<br>
period? What I&#x27;d like to see is some average of all averages that each<br>
cuber had during a certain year on the WCA database. I know there are<br>
many problems to ranking by this approach--setting the minimum number<br>
of averages, cubers can theoretically stop competing for the year to<br>
give themselves a better rank, etc--but it would still be a more<br>
accurate measure of a cuber than any that exists today.<br>
<br>
On a completely different WC topic, are we not counting Stefan&#x27;s<br>
Megaminx solve as a world record? There&#x27;s no way to tell from the<br>
database which solve within the same round came first, but can&#x27;t this<br>
be entered in manually, if we do accept this as a world record? I have<br>
personally encountered two other similar cases: Nathaniel Christian&#x27;s<br>
4.20 2x2 at Horace Mann 2005, which, if accepted, is very possibly the<br>
world record that lasted the shortest time (about 10 seconds), and my<br>
own 2:50.32 3x3 blindfolded at Caltech Spring 2005. <br>
<br>
Finally, I apologize for getting third in 3x3 blindfolded. That was<br>
possible only because of the easy solve, meaning because of luck.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Interesting thoughts and comments.

I think everyone at the competition (well, all the speedcubers that is,
not the media!) all know that there was a relatively large number of
people who *could* have won the 3x3x3. While watching the finals I
recall having a conversation with some other cubers about how incredibly
close it was, and that it really was impossible to predict who would be
standing on the podium at the end. This is quite different to say,
Worlds 2003, where it was easier to guess in advance who would probably
be in the Top 10 or Top 5.

BTW, please don&#x27;t take this as trying to detract from Yu Nakajima&#x27;s win.
He performed fantastically and deserves our congratulations! :)

For those of us who went to Worlds 2005 and Worlds 2003, it was both
amazing and wonderful to see how far speedcubing has come in 4 years. My
recent competition times (mostly in the 20 to 30 second range) are
nothing special now, but in Worlds 2003 they would have gotten me into
the semi-finals! I recall back at Worlds 2003 that any sub-20s solve
would get an applause from the crowd. Now, it almost has to be a sub-12s
before anyone bothers to clap!

Congratulations to everyone who participated! It was a great
championships!!

Go cubing!!! :D

<br>
Dear Mr.Frank Morris,<br>
It is a nice feeling to have met you in Budapest. Thank you so much for <br>
giving me your 555 stickers. It is a special and lucky one for me!!!<br>
The most I enjoyed in wc-2007 is 555 finals. I was confident that I could <br>
reach finals before the world cup. It was very nice and stiff competition 6 <br>
finalists finished sub 2 min(including me). I felt great when I raced with <br>
the 555 world greats - you, Ookusa, Fredrick, Ron, Matyas, Erik, Milan, Yugi <br>
et all.<br>
However, I did not correct/learn my mistakes in edge pairing up, as you were <br>
busy yourself. Could you explain/teach/correct my mistakes so that I can <br>
improve further.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I took apart the super stiff 5x5 cube that I&#x27;m breaking in (rubiks.com<br>
version) and I discovered that 4 of the centers turn around the<br>
central spider with even smoothness/tension.  One of the remaining two<br>
is about twice as tight as the first 4, and the last one is easily 3-4<br>
times as tight as the first 4.  I&#x27;m trying to remove the center caps<br>
on these two centers to see if I can adjust anything on the inside,<br>
but I&#x27;m having a hard time.  I&#x27;m using a razor blade to cut the<br>
grooves where the the center cap meets the center base, but after much<br>
cutting I can&#x27;t get the center cap to budge.<br>
<br>
Am I missing something about how the center portion is put together? <br>
Is the center cap not detachable?  Or is it glued from the inside such<br>
that cutting the sides like I am will not loosen it enough to remove it?<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help.  I&#x27;ll probably just end up buying another 5x5<br>
cube, but I&#x27;d like to at least take a stab at fixing this one, even if<br>
it does only end up as a spare parts cube eventually.<br>

I think the best way would probably be to cut out that rivet, fill the
hole in both the center cap and the spider with some sort of putty,
and then put a screw.  you&#x27;ll probably be happier in the end with a
DIY 5x5.

No, there&#x27;s no way that i know of to do that. However the reverse is 
possible if you are careful. Making a loose rivet firmer. It can be 
gently knocked back into the core. Use some pointed metal like a big 
nail to make sure you hammer only on the rivet head, and place the 
cube on firm ground (concrete or tiles), not a carpet or anything. But 
of course this is done solely at your own risk. Do NOT prosecute me as 
i have already disclaimed any responsibility ;-)

There already are some approaches like this, at least a few combining 
statistics/rankings of several events to offer a view on who&#x27;s the 
best overall cuber of puzzler. None of them can claim to determine 
*the* best cuber/puzzler, though, as each statistic can be tweaked in 
many ways, like you already mentioned above.

I&#x27;m totally fine with the &quot;world champion&quot; as it is, as there&#x27;s no 
way to really determine the best person anyway. World champion, like 
you said, only means you won the world championship.

Are tennis or chess or soccer or many other sports any different?

No, we&#x27;re not counting them as world records. The rules are quite 
clear about this:

9i2) Regional records are recognised at the end of a round. If a 
record is broken twice or more in a round, only the latter is 
recognised.

          <div class="email-content">Again congrats to all winners. All winners deserve to win except me. I am a lucky winner.
  Even in other games, sometime better teams are eliminated and the so called winner is the world champion for the next 4 years! 
  Everyone knows I am not the best in 555 bld. But, &quot;I am the world champion&quot;. I could not believe this. Similarly, in multiple cubes blindfolded although I did only 3 cubes, I finished third. Again I was lucky. Luck favours sometime. 
   
  I think this kind of result only encourages many to compete. Anything can happen on the day. If we could predict the winner before hand, then the number of participants will come down. Then there is no fun. 
   
  I simply love cubing irrespective of different rules/formats/strategies of ranking. 
  I think only 333 speed solving event winner may be dedcided by a different better rules, if any.

          Hi everyone,

I would also like to add my congratulations to the champions in the
various competitions (so like, 5 times to Matyas??) and to the
finalists. I very much enjoyed meeting many new (and fast!) cubers as
well as those from WC05 and 03.

>From the results of the 3x3 speedsolve, I am compelled make some
observations. I am surprised that no one has made a post about this; I
know I&#x27;m not the only one who has been thinking in this direction.

Of the 16 finalists, I would say that half or more had at least some
chance of winning the competition (of course, some had a greater
chance than others). Yu Nakajima also led the second round in average,
but his 14.54 in the first round shows that he can have a relatively
slow average on a bad round. Andrew Kang had a 15.84 first round and
Mitsuki Gunji, too, finished the second round with a 14.92. With one
more second on any solve that counts in the average, Mitsuki wouldn&#x27;t
even have made the final. At the other, unlucky end are Jean Pons, who
had a 12.48 in the first round but just missed the podium in the
final, and Edouard Chambon, Thibaut Jacquinot, and Harris Chan, who
have all shown themselves to be a better cuber than me but who did not
perform their best in the final. Had luck played out differently, we
could have seen a very different final ranking.

The problem is that being the best just means that you have a greater
chance of winning the competition than anybody else, not that you are
going to win it. Suppose Yu had made a few mistakes, and suppose I had
some U permutations and had gotten a sub-13 average, which is very
possible. I would have won the competition by luck. You would have had
a most unwilling champion, apologizing to both the Japanese and the
French and desperately explaining to the media that it was a fluke
(not that most of them would have cared). With there having been a
pretty realistic possibility of something like this happening, we
should be happy that Yu, a cuber we can agree is one of the very
fastest in the world, won the competition.

I like World Championships because they give us a good measure of the
current level of the top cubers, but I&#x27;m becoming more and more
uncomfortable with the idea of the title of &quot;World Champion.&quot; Simply
because of the role that luck plays in speedcubing, that title means
just that the cuber who holds it won the World Championship, not
necessarily that he is the best in the world, as it is usually taken
to imply by the media. If no method that improves on Fridrich is
discovered, in two years there will be even more clustering at the
top. The difference between first and tenth may even be the luck on
the permutations. Are five solves in the final round of one
competition, world championship though it may be, enough to choose the
World Champion for the next two years...the one cuber that, thanks to
the media, will be best known by the non-cubers around the world as
presumably the best cuber in the world?

In any case, I know we have to choose a World Champion based on just
the results of the World Championship (or is there some sport where
the world champion is not the winner of the world championship?).
Somebody has suggested using all solves from a competition to
determine the overall ranking separate from the ranking in the final
round, and there are also other ideas that I know some people have. I
understand that it&#x27;s difficult to change the system we already have,
but I find this important enough that it should at least be given a
discussion.

It&#x27;s obvious that no single competition is enough to determine who the
best cuber is. The World Championship should not be thought of as the
competition to determine the best cuber but the competition to decide
the World Champion, no more.

How, then, can we best determine the best cuber during a certain
period? What I&#x27;d like to see is some average of all averages that each
cuber had during a certain year on the WCA database. I know there are
many problems to ranking by this approach--setting the minimum number
of averages, cubers can theoretically stop competing for the year to
give themselves a better rank, etc--but it would still be a more
accurate measure of a cuber than any that exists today.

On a completely different WC topic, are we not counting Stefan&#x27;s
Megaminx solve as a world record? There&#x27;s no way to tell from the
database which solve within the same round came first, but can&#x27;t this
be entered in manually, if we do accept this as a world record? I have
personally encountered two other similar cases: Nathaniel Christian&#x27;s
4.20 2x2 at Horace Mann 2005, which, if accepted, is very possibly the
world record that lasted the shortest time (about 10 seconds), and my
own 2:50.32 3x3 blindfolded at Caltech Spring 2005. 

Finally, I apologize for getting third in 3x3 blindfolded. That was
possible only because of the easy solve, meaning because of luck.
Tyson, when we get something to eat the next time, I&#x27;m paying.

Best,
-macky

          <div class="email-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
there&#x27;s this variation of pochmann&#x27;s old method, by patrick. <br>
<br>
http://pjkcubed.com/blindfold-guide.html<br>
<br>
by only using one algorithm, T-perm. what&#x27;s different about this<br>
method is that it requires orientation of all cubes so that especially<br>
the corner cubies can easily get into position 2 (standard position<br>
like in 3-cycle), so that it can exchange with the cubie at position<br>
3. still the same with pochmann&#x27;s is the permutation of edges. all<br>
steps are separated, meaning its CO-EO-CP-EP. setup algorithms are<br>
extremely easy, due to the orientations.<br>
<br>
what do you think of this:<br>
<br>
do you think its a nice method to combine the permutation phase? like,<br>
after i setup for corner permutation, i immediately setup edge<br>
permutation? i did it already with paper. i know its possible. but for<br>
you guys, how effective is this variation? for me its kinda hard to<br>
memorize and recall pairs. example, lets say corner perm is (12345),<br>
and edge perm is (98765432).for the first move, what i need to do is<br>
setup corner 1 in the 2 position (something like F2 D&#x27; F2), then<br>
mentally locate where ive put edge 9 (if ever the setup algo moved<br>
that particular edge.), then put it in position 4, as like in<br>
pochmann&#x27;s original method ( in this case, it wasnt moved, so setup is<br>
 D&#x27; L2). do T perm, undo the setup for edge, then undo setup for corner. <br>
<br>
of course since corners are always fewer than edges, then it&#x27;ll come<br>
to a point that i only have to do edges.<br>
<br>
so what do u think? :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello Chris

THis is the same thing I discovered a while ago, when I tried to 
loosn&#x27; up my VERY stiff 5x5x5.
At first I replaced the middle edges pieces with my very loose 5x5x5 
ones, but that didn&#x27;t make a lot of change.
Then I removed the center cups on two of the centers just to find 
out that the screws in there doesn&#x27;t change a thing when you turn it.
At last, I contacted Ton who told me that this 5x5x5 can&#x27;t be tuned 
and that I need to find a better one.  Bad luck for me...
This is the reason I couldn&#x27;t practice my 5x5x5 blindfold for the 
WC07, because every time I tried to practice with my old one after 
about 6 minutes of memorization I turned the cube less then 4 turnes 
and it will explode on me.

P.S. it was great seeing you again.

think people including myself would appreciate some pictures of 
what&#x27;s down there - how it looks opened.

I think that you should just get a new 5x5. Have the spare parts is 
very important I&#x27;ve found. I have four, but only two good cores. 
Similarly, even though I steadily by spare x-centers from cubesmith, 
I still probably only have enough for about 3 cubes. Recently I even 
lost a +center for the first time - in my own room. How does that 
happen? *shrugs*

If you have significant plastics experience or know someone that 
will do it for you, the option of taking out those rivets and 
converting it to screw as suggested in this thread is quite 
possible, but I would say not worth the work. Nifty mod though... 
I&#x27;m sure ppl on twistfourm have done this. Maybe I can ask over 
there if anyone wants to do a bunch of these modded cores and sell 
to the serious 5x5 cubers...

Btw what is a good rule-of-thumb on when a 5x5 is too loose and 
needs to be retired?

I&#x27;m am fairly new to cubing, but this is how I personally do it.
When I get to the OLL stage, I use:

F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;
or 
F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;
(As required to form the cross on the top)

Once the top cross is in place, there are only 7 OLL algorithms 
required to get to PLL. Those 7 cases and algorithms can be found on 
Bob Burton&#x27;s page here in the &#x27;All Edges Flipped Correctly&#x27; section:

http://www.cubewhiz.com/oll.html

Currently I have all but 5 of the PLL algorithms memorized. Once I have 
those completely memorized, I&#x27;ll be moving back and memorizing more 
OLL&#x27;s. 
After that, work on my F2L algorithms. I&#x27;m doing it in this reverse 
fashion because by the time I get to learning new F2L alg&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll 
pretty much have it down pat anyway.

I hope this helps.

I learned OLLs in two stages. Doing them over and over (regardless of
the OLL state of the cube) for execution, and doing normal solves for
recognition.

You could also learn your OLLs two a time, such that one is the
inverse of the other. That way for at least one of each pair you&#x27;ll be
able to practice seeing as well as doing it.

          <div class="email-content">The approach NB describes is highly recommended. I think it&#x27;s an <br>
ideal stepping stone (almost necessary) to learning OLL. The 7 <br>
corner-only cases need to be mastered early.<br>
<br>
This step however, would seem trivial compared to the rest of OLL <br>
though. So make sure you have gotten this far first.<br>
<br>
I would like to point out the obvious. OLL algs (well any alg) <br>
has &quot;finite order&quot;. In this case what I mean is that if you do it <br>
enough times you will get the OLL case back. This is usually 2 or 5 <br>
iterations before coming back to the setup.<br>
<br>
After this, I would recommend learning the more complicated cases <br>
that only have 2 edges flipped - leaving the all edges flipped cases <br>
for later. (Don&#x27;t follow strictly though, just a guidline.) Learn <br>
them roughly the order of the length of the alg. Some sites already <br>
lay them out in roughly this manner.<br>
<br>
As a sidenote, I don&#x27;t know OLL. So take my advice for what ever <br>
it&#x27;s worth.<br>

I was giving my recommendation. Learn the 7 alg&#x27;s I mentioned, and 
expand from there.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

>From 1980-83 I was a CLL/ELL cuber.
In 2000 I restarted cubing, and began to learn OLL/PLL.

This was my approach:
1) start with orient edges, then orient corners (9 cases)
For edges you need to learn cases N2 and N3, and for corners H1 - H7 from 
this page:
http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_orientation.html

2) learn all cases with 4 edges flipped (8 more cases)
Cases F1-F8.

3) learn other cases in groups

Of course you can learn the OLL algorithms from any site.

Have fun,

Ron

The approach NB describes is highly recommended. I think it&#x27;s an
ideal stepping stone (almost necessary) to learning OLL. The 7
corner-only cases need to be mastered early.

This step however, would seem trivial compared to the rest of OLL
though. So make sure you have gotten this far first.

I would like to point out the obvious. OLL algs (well any alg)
has &quot;finite order&quot;. In this case what I mean is that if you do it
enough times you will get the OLL case back. This is usually 2 or 5
iterations before coming back to the setup.

After this, I would recommend learning the more complicated cases
that only have 2 edges flipped - leaving the all edges flipped cases
for later. (Don&#x27;t follow strictly though, just a guidline.) Learn
them roughly the order of the length of the alg. Some sites already
lay them out in roughly this manner.

As a sidenote, I don&#x27;t know OLL. So take my advice for what ever
it&#x27;s worth.

(http://www.its.caltech.edu/~leyanlo/) was very useful. The OLLs are
listed with notes like which ones are similar in execution and which
ones are inverses. It can help you separate everything into groups of
similar cases which you can then learn together.

&gt; just be performed twice (..) to get a solved cube<br>
<br>
I dont know how to learn OLL efficient, but actually, what you said about PLL algorithms <br>
applies for ANY cube algorithm (not just the ones used by CFOP systems, but every possible <br>
move sequence). Not twice of course, but there is a number n for every algorithm so that this <br>
algorithm applied n times results in the state from which you started (n is called the order of <br>
the permutation). For example: Sune has order 6.<br>
<br>
Since there are &quot;only&quot; 57 OLL algorithms and every OLL algorithm just changes the <br>
orientation of the last layer, the order of every OLL is smaller than 57, most of them much <br>
less.. Just choose one OLL, do it over and over again, after some time (if you did it right every <br>
time) you will get back to where you started.<br>
<br>
This is how I learned the corner orientation algorithms and it worked fine for me :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s what I posted on the TP forum a while ago:

For OLL, I&#x27;d learn one algorithm at a time. Some OLLs cycle after a
very small number of cycles, so you&#x27;ll end up with an oriented LL by
executing one OLL repeatedly after 3-4 applications. If not, learn
it&#x27;s inverse and solve execute one OLL and then the other, and switch
the order you execute them after a while.

I learned quite a few OLLs very quickly this way (less than a minute
each).

But if that doesn&#x27;t work, watch how the OLL shifts displaces F2L and
restores F2L. Then you can see how the first few moves work and then
restore F2L without &#x27;knowing&#x27; the algorithm.


Pretty much the same thing Tyson and Shelley said...

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I am having great difficulty trying to attain good times while<br>
practicing on my own or while a crowd is watching me. While the latter<br>
can be explained by nervousness and shaking caused by the nervousness,<br>
I am unable to find a reason why my times, well, comparatively suck<br>
while just practicing.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough, I make very good times when competing online. Example<br>
here: http://www.speedsolving.com/showpost.php?p=17611&amp;postcount=10<br>
<br>
With the exception of Rubik&#x27;s Magic and OH solving, my times are all<br>
generally 15% slower than the averages I attain during online<br>
competitions (23/105/150 compared to the 20/90/130 I got here).<br>
<br>
I am expecting that something similar will happen at the Pleasantville<br>
competition, based on my performance and times at my previous<br>
competitions, where a considerable number of my solves were much<br>
faster than my home averages.<br>
<br>
I was wondering what I could do to overcome this, and if anyone else<br>
experienced anything similar?<br>

 Yes, but your post says nothing about how to learn, memorize and
 recognize the 50 other OLLs the original poster was asking about.

          <div class="email-content">1) Find a great site with all 57 cases.
2) Memorize the algorithm by doing it over and over again.
3) Experiment and try to set up that OLL case so you can recognize it. (i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this step)
4) Keep practicing.

In other words: just do it over and over again. how else do you learn it?

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Best way to learn OLL?









  


    
            I learned PLL by performing the algorithms, since most of them can

just be performed twice, or be performed once followed by their

inverted/mirrored algorithm to get a solved cube. But OLL is a little

different since performing an OLL algorithm will give you another OLL

situation. So it&#x27;s harder to set up the cube to solve for OLL. How do

you recommend learning it? It&#x27;s also a lot harder since there&#x27;s almost

three times as many algorithms to remember.

          <div class="email-content">People think that playing with an unlubed cube helps break it in a bit
better.

My best solution to this was I had a friend who wanted to play with a cube,
but didn&#x27;t actually want one so I let her use one of my new ones.  She broke
it in very nicely for me.

This argument ignores the fact that OLL algorithms can be
applied to any of 4 rotational positions for the last layer, but
except for some symmetrical cases, only one of the four rotational
positions will be correct for applying the algorithm. There are
actually 27*8 = 216 total LL orientation cases (including the solved
case, and taking the rotational position of the last layer into
account). Also, 57 doesn&#x27;t count the solved case.

However, if you look at what the possible cycle structures that last
layer positions can have, I don&#x27;t think you can have any last layer
algorithm (not merely OLL or PLL) with an order larger than 36. You
can have a 9-cycle of corner facelets and a 4-cycle of edge facelets,
giving the order of a position as LCM(9,4) = 36. For example, L U L&#x27;
F&#x27; L&#x27; B L B2 U B U&#x27; F U has order 36.

I also note that the OLL cases do not have unique inverses if you
ignore how individual cubies are permuted. This means that two OLL
algs for the exact same case may not necessarily have the same order.
For example, R L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; L F R F&#x27; has order 3, but M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2
M U M U M (which solves the same OLL case) has order 2.

Finally, I note that for any alg (for the standard 3x3x3), it&#x27;s been
proven that there are none with an order higher than 1260.

Wow... My name right between Yu Nakajima and Mitsuku Gunji!! :) 
That&#x27;s nice of you ;).

I think Erik is indeed one of the best allrounders of this moment. 
(as well as Matyas) He was top 3 in 3 events (feet, megaminx, 4x4) 
at worlds, and missed the top3 of the 5x5 event by an inch (.28 
seconds to be precise). He&#x27;s also one of the best on the 3x3; missed 
the finals by .02 should have been in it.

I&#x27;ve also see what he&#x27;s working on behind the scenes, and I know 
that he&#x27;s one of the most dedicated and motivated cubers right now, 
memorizing specialised algs a lot!

          <div class="email-content">Erik is experimenting novelty(new algms) and sharing it a lot with cubing community. Thats why he comes ahead of Matiyas Kuti, in my opinion. However, Matiyas is the most amazing cuber.
   
  I am not surprised when many very good cubers failed to make it to finals. We all know it is going to be only 16. Always the 17th ranked player in the semi-finals is considered as unlucky. Similarly 4th ranked player in the finals also considered as the most unlucky. This time it was Erik in both the case.

          <div class="email-content">If everyone in the semi-finals share their thoughts or their state of mind when they were on the stage, it might me very interesting and we can learn a lot from it, I think. I recall, Chris Hardwick telling me, he is always nervous before competition. <br>
   <br>
  What was in my mind when I stepped up to the stage is sub 15 avg. <br>
  first solve = 12.27 sec (PLL skip) . I took more than a sec to recognise the PLL skip.<br>
  2nd solve = 20.xy sec - I made a mistake in F2L. So I focused my mind on my next solve and visulised it as if I am doing all the 7 setps fluently(cross + 4 f2l + oll +pll)<br>
  3rd solve = 16 sec - Took more than 2 sec time to recognise PLL . I am still very poor in recognising PLL.<br>
   <br>
  I kept telling myself i.e, the next two sub 15 sec solves might help me to be in the finals. I can not do any better. What I feared most was POP.<br>
   <br>
  4th solve - I took my standing for the solve. I finished my OLL @ 11 sec. The split sec look at the timer spoilt everything. I had a bad pop and ended my dream with 26.xy sec<br>
   <br>
  5th solve - I knew I am not in the finals. Still, I wanted to do my best. I visualized the whole solve i.e, how I have to do the final one in my minds eye. Everything went very well and I did it in 14.55 sec. <br>
   <br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;d definitely be willing to post my thoughts.  I do always get 
nervous before I go up for a competition round, but I&#x27;ve found that 
sometimes it helps me and sometimes it hurts.

I don&#x27;t want to give excuses for myself, but I did not perform as 
well at the blindfolded events as I would have liked because I was 
very nervous.  Obviously this is my own fault for how I train at 
home, and John Louis and Bernett gave me ideas at the after party on 
how to train my nerves better for future competitions for a mental 
event such as blindfolded cubing.

I did my 4x4x4 blindfolded solves first and I got a DNF on my first 
solve that was off by a setup turn and probably a couple 3 cycles, 
so not close at all.  This completely shattered my confidence and I 
just got scared that I would DNF the next solve.  I feel like I 
completely buckled under the pressure after that for my second 4x4 
solve and for my 5x5 solve.

One thing I learned is to take a break for a few minutes between 
blindfolded solves if you DNF, just to get your nerves back in 
check.  I just did all my solves one right after the other which is 
what I do at home, but this clearly is different from competition 
where you get nervous after a DNF.  At home if I DNF there is no 
pressure so I don&#x27;t care.

Congrats to Matyas and to Bernett for their performances in the 
blindfold events, and the big cube blindfolded especially.  I am 
glad I had such an experience with losing my confidence as I did at 
the WC to teach me that I was training very poorly for these events 
at home, and to try to remedy that in the future.  I may not ever be 
at the forefront of big cube blindfolded again, but I will hopefully 
remain in the top 3 for a long time to come.  That is my goal at 
least ;-)

So Bernett to answer your question yes I do get very nervous before 
a competition, but now I think that is because I train poorly at 
home and in the time leading up to a competition.  This is something 
I am now paying attention to and that I am going to try to fix 
before any future competition, especially for the blindfolded events 
which are still my main focus.

And also I just want to say it was incredible meeting so many cubers 
in person again, especially all the ones from Europe!  I don&#x27;t want 
to sound all negative with this post, because this trip and this 
competition were both absolutely amazing, and I had an absolute 
blast!  I hope to see all of you again in 2009 wherever the WC may 
be!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bernett,

Thanks for sharing.

I am never nervous for a competition.
I do not pay attention to what other competitors are doing. I only focus on 
setting a good personal average, and then hope it is enough.
My main problem is being too eager and then mess up the cross or an F2L 
pair. Which has happened a lot to me recently. This is the reason why I 
don&#x27;t practice extended crosses. I have problems enough to solve a cross in 
the first place.
Another problem is the finger pressure. When it does not count my fingers 
feel very light. But during a competition I want to go fast and then I lock 
up because of too much finger pressure.
It is crucial for me that I have warm hands, so when it is kind of cold I 
always have my hands in my arm-pits.

In the first round I said to myself that a sub 17 average would be enough to 
proceed.
My first 3 solves were done while intentionally going very slow, without 
making mistakes.
After 3 decent solves I said to myself, OK, now you can go top speed and 
finally break your personal best. Immediately I had two bad mistakes. :-)

In the semi final I said to myself that a sub 15 average would be enough to 
proceed.
My first solve I went very slow again, but somehow I still messed up the 
very easy cross. Screwing up my first solve is traditional for me. For my 
second solve I thought I had to compensate my first solve, but instead I 
messed up the cross again. It is so familiar. :-)
My third solve had only 1 small mistake, so I started thinking that I could 
be in the final.
My fourth solve was fast, until I messed up an easy PLL, and was lucky to be 
able to track back and still do 17.

I think in general people perform worse in a competition, with some 
exceptions.
Additionally, being involved in the organisation of a competition also does 
not help.

I am not the fastest in practice and UWR, so I think that finishing 25th in 
the world championship is the right place for me.
Not bad for a 40 year old. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s very interesting to hear what&#x27;s going on in someone else&#x27;s mind.

Even though I&#x27;ve been to a lot of tournaments and have had some
success, I still get quite nervous. The tension that is part of a big
final is something I&#x27;ve never really gotten used to.

You have to sit and wait between solves and you have no control over
how long this will take. In the meantime you&#x27;re being left alone with
your thoughts. You try to stay in a positive frame of mind and enjoy
the moment, but at the same time you want to run away from it and
escape from the stress.

Then when the judge calls you, you suddenly have to make a switch and
perform. In one split second, you have to forget about all your
emotions and start focusing on corners, edges, red, green, orange,
blue, white and yellow.

That being said, I think this is one of the aspects of competition
that make it so exciting and worthwhile. The reward you get from a
good performance is even more satisfying when you know you&#x27;ve gone
through a tough time doing it. Nerves can also help you to stay sharp
and make you want to try harder. 

Also, I don&#x27;t think you should try to train yourself not to be nervous
at all. It would be like learning not to feel relieved about anything
anymore. Feeling nervous in challenging situations is such a primitive
reflex. You just have to learn to suffer through it.

          <div class="email-content">Normally I don&#x27;t get nervous at competitions around here because I<br>
know most of the people and so I feel like I&#x27;m cubing around friends<br>
and there is little pressure.  At this competition, I felt a lot more<br>
pressure because I knew if I didn&#x27;t do well, I wouldn&#x27;t make the<br>
finals.  My nervousness got to me and I made a lot of mistakes on the<br>
last day.  In the semi finals, I had a 2 second penalty on my 3rd<br>
solve which turned what would have been my best solve into my worst<br>
solve.  I kept telling myself I needed to go faster which caused me to<br>
rush and then I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see ahead.<br>
<br>
Then, for the one handed finals, I was so nervous my hands were<br>
shaking.  I knew there were a lot of fast people and a lot of people<br>
who could beat me and so I knew that I needed to do well to have a<br>
chance.  This created a lot of pressure which caused me to make<br>
mistakes.  I was penalized twice in this round because I would get<br>
jammed and then rush the end and it wouldn&#x27;t be aligned correctly. <br>
When the judge asked me to initial the card, I could barely do it<br>
because my hands were shaking so badly.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, like Chris said, it was really great to meet a lot<br>
of cubers that I have never met before.  The whole trip was a good<br>
experience and it was a lot of fun.  It was a good experience to feel<br>
the pressure when competing with the best in the world and hopefully I<br>
can use it improve for the future.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll have the chance to<br>
see some of you again soon at another competition.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I am just experimenting with different styles of being relaxed since 
the Belgian Open 2007 and I think the best way for me to stay 
relaxed is just to practise the 5x5x5 until I am standing/sitting 
behind the timer, I did this at the Dutch Open 2007 and it got me 
3rd place for the 3x3x3(of wich I am happy about it) and to think 
about something completely else instead of the event you are going 
to do.

For one handed I am still experimenting, I never shake untill I am 
at the PLL then I can barely move the cube and I have to force 
myself not to look at the timer.

But the worst way to think( wich I am doing constantly doing sadly 
enough ) is: &#x27;&#x27;You have paid much money to travel to this 
competition, you had to sit far too long in the car/plane and after 
this competition you will have to wait a few months or more!! Do not 
mess up these 5 solves!!&#x27;&#x27; And to be honest I do not eat breakfast
(just drink orange/apple juice) at competition day, or else it will 
get out very quickly...

This handy tactic worked well at an competition to be a bit less 
nervous: The rest is nervous, so you just stay calm &lt;-- and it 
works, I saw a few cubers getting nervous in a competition before I 
was up and I allready knew I was going to win.

I hope this is/was interesting to read,

reflex. You just have to learn to suffer through it - Lars.

                  Yes, to be nervous is common. But I think there are ways to convert it into positive frame of mind and negative frame of mind. When I watched Tennis matches, Cricket matches, I often heard  the commentators speaking about the state of the mind of the players. Both the players are equally good technically. Both are nervous. Then, why sometime finals become all one sided match ? 
              The big match winners are mentally stronger than their opponent, at least on that day. In those matches if you loose somewhere, still you can bounce back to recover and level it and win it from there. But cubing is such a fast game, you can not recover. So, I think I can not just sink in the nervousness. Instead I should learn to convert the nervousness to only positive enengy and not negative energy.
   
  >I do always get nervous before I go up for a competition round, but I&#x27;ve found that sometimes it helps me and sometimes it hurts - Chris.
   
             Why it clicks only sometime ? Why not always ? Again, I think it depends on how you are taking the nervousness - positive or negative. I makes me to believe there is a way to convert the nervousness to only positive enenrgy/thoughts.
   
             I think, when you know your competitors are much below your level, your nervousness is positive. But, when they are on par with your level, one should learn to hold the nerve and convert it into positive. 
   
             Finally, Of course, the question of nervousness arise only when you want to win.

Even though I&#x27;ve been to a lot of tournaments and have had some
success, I still get quite nervous. The tension that is part of a big
final is something I&#x27;ve never really gotten used to.

You have to sit and wait between solves and you have no control over
how long this will take. In the meantime you&#x27;re being left alone with
your thoughts. You try to stay in a positive frame of mind and enjoy
the moment, but at the same time you want to run away from it and
escape from the stress.

Then when the judge calls you, you suddenly have to make a switch and
perform. In one split second, you have to forget about all your
emotions and start focusing on corners, edges, red, green, orange,
blue, white and yellow.

That being said, I think this is one of the aspects of competition
that make it so exciting and worthwhile. The reward you get from a
good performance is even more satisfying when you know you&#x27;ve gone
through a tough time doing it. Nerves can also help you to stay sharp
and make you want to try harder. 

Also, I don&#x27;t think you should try to train yourself not to be nervous
at all. It would be like learning not to feel relieved about anything
anymore. Feeling nervous in challenging situations is such a primitive
reflex. You just have to learn to suffer through it.

          <div class="email-content">What&#x27;s &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; nervousness supposed to be? The way 
I see it, nervousness is nervousness - you either deal with it, with 
various degrees of success, or you don&#x27;t.

Being nervous is a natural reaction from the body or the brain when 
you absolutely need to perform. I guess that back in the days when we 
evolved these curious ... err... &quot;liabilities&quot;, nervousness actually 
did help. I suppose, otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t sit here being nervous. 
Unfortunately nobody cubed back then. :(

You guys seem to remember a lot from your solves. I typically forget 
everything about a solve right after it. Most of the time I can&#x27;t 
recall the cases at all. I&#x27;m inclined to think this is a good thing - 
my mind was so focused at cubing, all the other things I&#x27;d usually do 
gets second priority.

I&#x27;m usually considered by friends to be a very &quot;cold&quot; person. That&#x27;s 
not to say I&#x27;m not nervous on stage when cubing, of course, but I 
think it helps me focus when I need to. Just close your mind from the 
outside world. Be one with the cube, etc. :).

I don&#x27;t know how I accomplish this. Maybe that&#x27;s just how I am. So 
I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t really offer any direct advice.

at Fewest Moves, but I have already gotten 33 at an official competition and 
25 at an unofficial competition and I don&#x27;t even know OLL/PLL or ELL.COLL 
yet. Do the FMC experts don&#x27;t go to official competions anymore?

If you look at the results from worlds:
Mirek and Per missed worlds
Guus, Gilles Roux and Lars Petrus DNF-ed.
42 for Dan Harris was not spectular
35 for Zbigniew shouldn&#x27;t have been enough to win I think.

Common people, let&#x27;s break this record!

Wow, that&#x27;s a long time considering second place is only 398 days.

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Bruce Norskog&quot; &lt;brnorsk@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Sun, 21 Oct 2007 03:18:42 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">In the thread entitled &quot;Best way to learn OLL?&quot; (starting with message<br>
38390), the concept of the *order* of last layer algorithms was<br>
mentioned. I wrote a GAP program to determine the order of all 62,208<br>
last layer positions, and get a distribution of how many of each order<br>
there are. The results are in the table below. (I have used asterisks<br>
due to Yahoo stripping out extra spaces in the hope that the table<br>
will look somewhat like a table.)<br>
<br>
Basically, any alg for the cube, when executed repeatedly, eventually<br>
gets you back to the starting position after some finite number of<br>
times. The number of times the alg must be executed to get back to the<br>
starting position is called the order of the alg. Algs can be<br>
considered equivalent if they generate the same cube position starting<br>
from the solved cube. Of course, equivalent algs have the same order,<br>
so the order of a position can be considered the order of any alg that<br>
generates that position from the solved cube.<br>
<br>
In the table, I separate positions where all cubies are oriented from<br>
positions which have at least some incorrectly oriented cubies. I call<br>
these PLL cases and OLL cases, respectively, in the table.<br>
<br>
There are a total of 24*24/2=288 permutations of the last layer<br>
cubies. There are 27 possible corner orientation configurations, and 8<br>
possible edge orientation configurations. So the total number of LL<br>
positions (including the solved cube case) is 288*27*8 = 62208.<br>
<br>
order * PLL cases * OLL cases * ** total<br>
----- * --------- * --------- * ** -----<br>
** 1 * * * ** 1 * * * * ** 0 * * * * * 1<br>
** 2 * * * * 51 * * * ** 940 * * * * 991<br>
** 3 * * * * 80 * * ** 3,186 * * * 3,266<br>
** 4 * * ** 108 * * * 17,076 * ** 17,184<br>
** 6 * * * * 48 * * * 14,702 * ** 14,750<br>
** 9 * * * ** 0 * * ** 4,752 * * * 4,752<br>

          <div class="email-content">So I was looking through some records to see who has the most sub
sequential improvements for 3x3 avg in comp. The WCA database isn&#x27;t
very accommodating so I thought I would just post here and ask if
anyone else knew who has the longest run of improvement.

(i have 8 btw i don&#x27;t know if i will get a 9th at Pleasantville though
>_&lt; but i can dream)


yeah so if you know someone with 9+ in a row please post

thanks,

But you can communicate with them by mail (you know: paper, ink, letter and

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

In fact the workd record for fewest moves isn not more than about 400 
days old. Even if Mirek did 28 turns already 1000 days ago it was 
under the old 90 minutes time limit. There&#x27;s a (grace) WCA rule 
saying that when rules are changing it&#x27;s not enough to equal a record 
to ditch out the old one. It has to be beaten. IMHO 90 and 60 minutes 
cannot really be compared. 90 minutes allows much more search and not 
solely focusing on finishing the start off after a limited search ... 
On the other hand the current rules now allow for use of stickers, 
which i think only a few know well how to utilise well. Also the 
scrambles vary a LOT in &quot;complication&quot;. I think it&#x27;s just a 
coincidence that 28 hasn&#x27;t been beaten yet. For example in Budapest 
quite a lot of the top FM&#x27;ers got a dnf, for various reasons. Sooner 
or later 25 will be beaten in official competition. It may happen 
this or next year or even in 5 yrs, but for sure it will happen :D As 
i see it there&#x27;s about 10 ppl at least who now are able to do that in 
60 minutes ;-) (Noone mentioned and noone forgotten!!)

Have fun!!

That&#x27;s only what you chose to do. I was standing and cubing (with a 
second cube) while waiting for my next competition solve.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Lars Petrus might also have won with an easy continuation to his 11-
move start. 5 turns to finish off the edges and then 2 easy corner 3-
cycles done at the end directly, for 33 total. Inserting those cycles 
would be even better :D But Lars never uses that technique i think ...

Stress -> No sleep -> No result.
In the last 30 minutes, I wasted my time doing wrong scrambles, trying
to get the 35- solution I found a few minutes before.
I left the room with a standard length 2*1x2x3 skeleton
(L&#x27;FR&#x27;UL&#x27;B2DF&#x27;DR2UR [*]), and now at home, it looks so easy of course.

Congratulations to Zbigniew!


[*] Per, you&#x27;ll notice corners just need a 3-cycle, maybe you can have
fun with it. :-)

          <div class="email-content">Alright, I&#x27;m posting this to speedsolving.com, twistypuzzles.com, and speedsolvingrubikscube...<br>
I&#x27;m not going to try to defend or justify this idea: if you like it, try it, and if not, then don&#x27;t participate.<br>
<br>
Here, I&#x27;m posting 12 scrambles for the Prepared Solve Challenge (#1, just in case anyone wants more). It&#x27;s unofficial, and will run indefinitely.<br>
You can take any of the scrambles below, and use whatever tools you want in order to solve that scramble in the shortest time possible. It&#x27;s like a &quot;one-step-stop,&quot; but doesn&#x27;t need to be a normal, full solve with a regular method. You can use Cube Explorer to find an optimal solution, try FMC in many different ways, write a program to take in reams of solutions and pick a &quot;highly finger-tricky&quot; one, try a few different methods, write a solver for your normal method that seearches for short steps or skips... Whatever you&#x27;re willing to do to solve the scramble quickly.<br>
<br>
As for me: sometime, I will probably write a program to search for Fridrich and MGLS solutions with a cross on any face. One of them ought to have a PLL skip and nice cases.<br>
<br>
Beautifully, this won&#x27;t require any regulation. If someone says that she/he solved PSC1.5 in 6.34 seconds with a certain algorithm/solution, it counts (as long as the solve was done on that exact scramble with proper procedure -video evidence is good); &quot;lucky&quot; is an irrelevant concept. I would set up a site for submission of best times, but that would require annoying PHP coding...<br>
There are still ways to cheat, but those who will be good at this, I think, are trustworthy.<br>
<br>
So, feel free to pick any scramble, work on it, and share your solution and solving time. You get all the preparation time and attemps you want. If you want to, you can do all the scrambles and take an average, or average your bests for each. In a sense, this is an attempt to figure out the ultimate limits of speedcubing, so the more people try this, the more we see what&#x27;s possible. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what times Nakajima, Harris Chan, Katsu, Macky, etc. get if they try this...<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, below are the 12 scrambles, generated by Cube Explorer (all are 19 moves or less).<br>

Wow...I didn&#x27;t know...I thought he&#x27;s just been taking a break at
cubing and picking photography as a new hobby or something :O

Btw, he did SC last week (12.26, one penalty), and it&#x27;s on his new blog,
http://4none.tistory.com/122 &lt;http://4none.tistory.com/122>  (He saw my
SC on that week and
had the blood flowing with the urge to cube again :D) He went to a cube
meeting last night or something. And they were talking about how there
was going to be a competition in Seoul and stuff.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Yes that is of course allowed. What -I- would do is to give ACube 
the inverse scramble and ask it to give me ALL optimal solutions in 
desired metric. Then i carefully select one of them and practise it 
a lot. Note that ACube will at first give you list of suboptimal 
solutions. These MAY be better to perform than the shorter ones...

In the end this will be quite similar to &quot;speedscrambling&quot; i guess ;-
)

Have fun!!

<br>
A lot of us work very hard to make cubing a respectable sport in the world.<br>
I believe that someone should be appreciated for his ability to solve a cube<br>
by regular means.  We shouldn&#x27;t have to spice things up and lie to impress<br>
an audience.  What we do already is very impressive.<br>
<br>
We should always do our best to maintain honesty about our sport.<br>
Basically, don&#x27;t go doing something that&#x27;s impossible.  Now, if you go on<br>
stage, and stare at a cube for 15 seconds and then solve it blindfolded<br>
because you&#x27;re not Matyas Kuti and you memorized it before, well, I<br>
understand the practicalities of that... but I would strongly recommend you<br>
take a moment to think about what you&#x27;re doing.<br>
<br>
Imagine... Matyas Kuti solves a Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded.  The rest of the<br>
world thinks it&#x27;s retarded, because some other guy did it blindfolded with<br>
one-hand in 1 minute.  And it took Matyas 1:03 to solve his cube?  (Matyas<br>
rocks btw...)<br>
<br>
I would like to avoid that, and I&#x27;m hoping you would too.  Let&#x27;s not fuel<br>
the ignorance of the public.<br>

just a freak show.

But yeah.. how is one expected to solve a cube without any inspection
whatsoever? Even if you don&#x27;t get the official tournament 15 second
inspection, you still have to look at it, even for a fraction of a
second, before you begin. Otherwise you&#x27;re just turning faces
randomly. I wasn&#x27;t aware random turning is the only proper way to
solve a cube. No wonder everyone thinks it&#x27;s so hard.

          <div class="email-content">I *did* solve the cube blindfolded underwater on a TV show... hasn&#x27;t aired yet (French version of BATG btw). Ok, I got it memorized first, because we were in a jaccuzzi, and it wasn&#x27;t that comfortable, but anyway, I did *solve* it underwater (terrible time of 1:33). So this is very possible, especially to people like Matyas.

            Well, solving without inspection is doable. We&#x27;re talking about TV

shows who want us to do things that are not possible for the sake of

So ... you just want to go from &quot;looks fake&quot; to &quot;is fake&quot;?

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I recently tried to show some kids how to solve the cube. I need some<br>
help here. I use CFOP, so thats what I tried to show them.<br>
<br>
The cross and the first layer are very easy, most kids get that right<br>
away when I show it to them. The second layer takes a bit more time<br>
but is also not a problem.<br>
<br>
But the last layer is. How do you teach someone to solve the last<br>
layer without telling them &quot;here is a sheet of algorithms.. just learn<br>
them&quot;. I usually show them one of the two common edge orientation<br>
algorithms, so that they can orient all four edges correctly with just<br>
one algorithm. Then I usually show a sune, but thats already very<br>
frustrating because most kids dont seem to see how to use sune to<br>
correctly orient all four corners. I then show one edge 3 cycle and<br>
one corner 3 cycle algorithm.<br>
<br>
Does anyone has a better way? Maybe a very intuitive one, which kids<br>
can UNDERSTAND and not just learn, it does not have to be CFOP-LL! Or<br>
maybe a good way how to EXPLAIN those stupid algorithms so that they<br>
can understand it?<br>
<br>
I just hate it to tell kids who really want to learn how to solve the<br>
cube that they have to learn some stupid move sequences without<br>
knowing what happens (and why it works). I remember Chris Hardwick<br>
explaining something like this, but I cant find the post.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Florian :-)

I guess it would be better to teach kids some easier method than 
CFOP. By the sound of it you are orienting LL in 2 steps. But even 
that is already advanced, and requires a lot of memorisation unless 
you really understand the sequences, which i strongly doubt that kids 
will do.

I will suggest teach them the cross - fine. Then teach them working 
corner for inserting edges. Then very simple orient/permute edge 
stuff. Then finally teach them how to use corner mono-twists like 
R&#x27; D R F D F&#x27; or R&#x27; D2 R F D2 F&#x27; for the corners.

Personally i DO use sune stuff for corner orientation. But that does 
not &quot;easily&quot; cover all corner orientation cases. When some corners 
get oriented several times it becomes really tricky to understand how 
that works (i assume so anyway).

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

I&#x27;m aware that this is an area where my page lacks. The problem is
that I learned solving the cube shape just by playing with it a lot
and also with the help of the diagram on Jaap&#x27;s puzzle page. So I
don&#x27;t have any method or algorithms and hence I can&#x27;t really explain
how I do it myself. 

I hope I can one day work out something nice and easy so I can
complete the method on my page. In the meantime you can have a look at
the methods on Jaap&#x27;s puzzle page.

The problem you have with the notation is probably due to the fact
that you keep the puzzle upside down. The algorithms assume that you
keep the small piece of the middle layer on the left. I guess I could
have documented that better.

Kind regards,
Lars

 I guess it would be better to teach kids some easier method than 
 CFOP. By the sound of it you are orienting LL in 2 steps. But even 
 that is already advanced, and requires a lot of memorisation unless 
 you really understand the sequences, which i strongly doubt that kids 
 will do.
 
 I will suggest teach them the cross - fine. Then teach them working 
 corner for inserting edges. Then very simple orient/permute edge 
 stuff. Then finally teach them how to use corner mono-twists like 
 R&#x27; D R F D F&#x27; or R&#x27; D2 R F D2 F&#x27; for the corners.
 
 Personally i DO use sune stuff for corner orientation. But that does 
 not &quot;easily&quot; cover all corner orientation cases. When some corners 
 get oriented several times it becomes really tricky to understand how 
 that works (i assume so anyway).

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s how I would want to try to teach the LL:

-1. Orient edges (T-orient, repeated)
-2. Orient corners (Same as how Pedro described, except LL on top)
-3. Permute corners (I used L D2 L&#x27;, instead)
-4. Permute edges (M D2 M&#x27;, it&#x27;s almost the same! :P)

I taught my sister Petrus LL with the EO step first, though.

I like to hold yellow on the left and then...
- for corners repeat (R U&#x27;) (R&#x27; U) *until* LUF is yellow
- for edges repeat (M&#x27; U) *until* LU is yellow

With the &quot;until&quot; there&#x27;s no need for memorizing a specific numbers of 
repetitions and you just need to learn the 6 moves for all of OLL.

Cheers!
Stefan
