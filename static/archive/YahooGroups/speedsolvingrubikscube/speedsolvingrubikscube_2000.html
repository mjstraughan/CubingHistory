          <div class="email-content">In general there are two schools of thought about
speedsolving.<br>1. Know and learn many move sequences, so that
anything you encounter can be solved with very few
sequences.<br>2. Know and learn only a few sequences which can be
performed more quickly. Although you may have to apply
these sequences more often, and therefore make more
decisions, these decisions are easier to make so thinking
time is cut down.<br><br>These two ideas are
illustrated by the two main webpages about
speedsolving:<br><br>Jiri Friedrich&#x27;s
page:<br><a href=http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html target=new>http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html</a><br>Lars Petrus&#x27;
page:<br><a href=http://u1.netgate.net/~mette/lars/cubedude/ target=new>http://u1.netgate.net/~mette/lars/cubedude/</a><br><br>I am not really a speedsolver (usually 85 secs or
so), and therefore much prefer Lars&#x27; method which has
few sequences to memorise.<br><br>Both pages above
use essentially a layer method (though Lars does the
first two layers differently). Are there any
speedcubers out there who do a corners first method like Minh
Thai did?<br><br>Jaap<br>Jaap&#x27;s Puzzle Page:

          <div class="email-content">I use Jiri&#x27;s method speed solving, or I know a
whole bunch of moves so anything that comes up I can
solve in a few moves. I have never tried the other
method, of learning fewer moves. I want to try to learn
Lars Petrus&#x27; solution but I&#x27;ve never really sat down
to do it. I can say though that decision time
doesn&#x27;t take that long when you have to choose from a
larger number of moves that you&#x27;ve memorized. I&#x27;ve
broken them down into sections. For example the third
step of the solution I use is after the first two
layers are solved and the purpose of this step is to
orient all the bottom layer pieces so that the whole
face shows one color. There are 40 different
situations to choose from but my decision time is at longest
a little more than a second. Sometimes some of the
patterns are very similar so if you look for that similar
characteristic then you&#x27;ve automatically eliminated at least 30
of the situations if you see one of those similar
characterictics. The only drawback is that you have to practice
the moves a lot as they come up by the laws of
probability so the moves that are rare to come up you
especially need to practice or when they do come up you may
realize that you don&#x27;t remember them so well which really
kills your time.<br><br>I&#x27;ve never heard how Minh Thai
solved the cube he used a corners first approach? Is
there anywhere to read up on that type of solution?
That sounds interesting.<br><br>I want to try to learn
Lars&#x27; solution so that I can have a basis of comparison
between the two main methods of speed solving, how many
moves does it take, on average, for his method? Jiri&#x27;s
is about 55 or 56 moves on average.<br><br>Chris</div>

          <div class="email-content">I have a question for anyone out there that speed
solves. ilovemycue I know that you are faster than me so
maybe you can help me answer this. How can I solve the
first two layers faster? Yesterday I was timing myself
for solving just the first two layers, and once I
warmed up I could do it in 16-20 seconds on average,
with a few times at 14 seconds (not including any
lucky times). Does anyone have any tips for solving the
first two layers faster? I use Jiri Fridrich&#x27;s solution
so preferably without having to learn a new solution
:-) It might also have been because I was tired (I
was taking my times right before I went to bed).
However after I practiced solving the first two layers my
times improved slightly, to about 24-25 seconds on
average for a period of a few minutes. Also should I use
any finger shortcuts and if so how often? If anyone
has any tips or hints or can help me then I&#x27;d really
appreciate it. Thanks in advance.<br><br>Chris</div>

          <div class="email-content">I also have good days (&lt;23 avg) and bad days
(>25 avg). The difference is in the second phase (four
times a corner of the first layer and an edge of the
second). I think it is because you need to be really sharp
to immediately find the combination of those two
cubelets. On bad days I need relatively a lot of time to
find those two.<br><br>A method that also works fine,
is the following:<br>- solve the 4 edges of the
first layer (cross)<br>- solve 3 corners of the first
layer<br>- solve 3 edges of the second layer (using the not
solved corner of the first layer to &quot;insert&quot; the
edges)<br>- solve the last corner of the first layer together
with the last edges of the second<br><br>This method
will take about 5 or 6 moves extra, but you can focus
on solving one cubelet at a time. So it takes almost
the same time.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>Ilovemycube</div>

          <div class="email-content">(note: most of this is from my home page)<br>I
use Jiri&#x27;s method, and I usually do the first two
layers in 11-12 seconds. Here&#x27;s what I recommend:
<br>solve the cube, stopping and writing down the number of
moves you took for each stage. <br>Try to solve as fast
as you can while still counting, that way it&#x27;s more
like when you&#x27;re speed-solving. Do this 50 times or
so, and then find out your average moves for each
stage. <br><br>I did this and here&#x27;s what I got:<br>1.
(Cross) 6.0 moves<br>2. (4 corner/edge pairs) 27.28<br>3.
(orient) 8.74<br>4. (permute) 11.84<br>5. (total)
53.86<br><br>I think I can do better for #2. So make sure that
you are getting 27 or 28 for #2. <br><br>Suggestion
#2: when you are putting in your last pair in stage
#2, you can often put it in several ways. (like R U&#x27;
R&#x27; or R&#x27; F R F&#x27;). If you are careful, you can almost
always avoid the orientation cases with all edges
flipped.<br><br>Suggestion #3: One other important observation that I have
had is that during the first two layers, triggers
usually slow me down because they are too fast to watch
the pieces. I find my best times for the first two
layers are when I am doing really rythmic continuous
moves alternating between hands, at 3-3.5 moves per
second. <br><br>Suggestion #4: Another hugely helpful
observation that I&#x27;ve made several times this past year, and
then forgotten, is to really really try to look ahead
during the first two layers. This means that I force
myself to actively examine the whole cube, especially
the back side, while my hands are busy putting in the
current corner-edge pair. Whenever I remember to do this,
I seem to drop a whole second from my times. While
my hands are doing a move sequence, I am raising my
eyebrows and trying to peek around to the back of the cube
to see what pieces are there.<br><br>Suggestion #5.
As an exercize, try to solve the first two layers
without EVER changing the orientation of the cube. Do
this 100 times. This might be difficult at first, but
with some practice you will get used to it. Then take
these ideas and try to optimize your speed-cubing so
that you use as little turning of the whole cube as
possible, while still allowing some turning when it makes
the moves faster for your hands. The less you have to
turn the cube around, the easier it is for you to look
ahead.<br><br>Suggestion #6: It is also very important to minimize the
number of moves during your first two layers. There are
often shortcuts available that get rid of uneccessary
moves while you are inserting a corner-edge pair,
especially during the first few corner-edge pairs when you
have still have some &quot;empty&quot; slots left. Also, when
the last move of inserting one corner-edge pair is R&#x27;
and the first move of the next pair is going to be
R&#x27;, try to anticipate this and just do R2.<br><br>Dan</div>

          <div class="email-content">I agree mostly with cubin4speed.<br><br>here are
some of the things that I have found most
helpful.<br><br>1. When finishing the cross make a very strong
effort to look around for your first corner edge pair.
This may require slowing down the last moves of the
cross. I have found that I can lose the most time here
if I am not on top of things.<br><br>2. from here
looking ahead is the name of the game. One rule to stick
with most of the time is: solve the first corner edge
pair that you find. If you see another pair that is
set up better just as you are moving into the pair
you saw first...changing could throw you off... just
track where those pieces are going and be ready for
them as soon as you finish the ce pair you started.
(exceptions may be the 3 move case vs. an 8 or 9 move case
(most of the others won&#x27;t even mess up the second pair
very much)).<br><br>3. Really take advantage of empty
corner edge slots for putting pairs together before
putting them in the right place.<br><br>4. Practice a lot
going slow but with no stalls for
recognition.<br><br>5. Practice, Practice, Practice...This stage more
than any other just gets better and better the more
you do it.</div>

          <div class="email-content">There&#x27;s not one answer.<br>Cubin4speed keeps the
cross at the bottom.<br>Some other very fast cubists
(below 20 secs average) keep the cross at the left, half
left half top, or even top. I keep the cross at the
left.<br>As long as you make sure that you have a good view
of what is going to be the top layer, either side is
OK. So you could keep the cross at the top, but then
hold the cube a bit backwards at the top.<br><br>I see
one big advantage of keeping the cross at the bottom:
you have the cube in the correct position for the
first part of the top layer. So you will need less
thinking time.<br><br>Both left and bottom have the
advantage that you can combine the moves of the right and
upper side in short cuts.<br><br>The best would be to
never turn the cube at all. So build the cross at the
bottom, and keep it there.<br><br>Good

learning how to solve the orientation of the edges (3

the cases with 4 flipped edges (8 cases). This is

awkward for your hands. Do you redraw the pattern so the
move is easier for your hands, and try to learn it
that way? Or do you continue recognizing the pattern
the first way, and then rotate the cube to make the
move easier for hands?<br><br>Not critical; I was just
curious as to how different people tackled this.

          <div class="email-content">I found that the easiest way for me to learn the
moves was to print out Jiri&#x27;s move list and to just go
down the list move by move and check them off on the
sheet when I had memorized it. He arranges the moves in
pretty good sequence for memorizing. When you&#x27;re doing
it fast though I don&#x27;t think it matters because no
matter how you memorized the moves it seems that if you
are used to doing each move then you can still decide
without losing much time. <br><br>I found out that a lot
of the times moves that felt bad for my hands got
better if I try it from a different angle. Just keep
trying different angles till you find the one that feels
the best. <br><br>By the way for those of you
wondering about my homepage I have no idea why it messed up
but it works now. I guess geocities&#x27; servers were
messing up.<br><br>I have a question about recording
record times. When is a time too lucky to consider? I
usually consider a time too lucky if it only takes one
algorithm to solve the third layer instead of the usual
two. Are there any other situations you should
consider too lucky or is it usually only the third layer
that you really look at to decide?<br><br>Also, on a
random note, recently I&#x27;ve been trying a move for fun
that I can do extremely fast. It has no purpose really
but it just feels good to my hands. The move is R&#x27; U
R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R U It&#x27;s kind of cool too because the
move can be repeated any number of times without
losing speed. I&#x27;m still trying to get my hands used to
it so I haven&#x27;t timed myself but I&#x27;m pretty sure
I&#x27;ve done a few times in under 1.5 seconds. Does
anyone know any other moves that can be done really
fast?<br><br>Later,<br>Chris</div>

          <div class="email-content">here are some of my thoughts on
the<br>Orientation case:<br><br>learning the orientations is like
programming a good application. Design is a key element. I
would highly recommend starting with a good plan (you
have a good start by asking these questions). Most
important, before you start learning them know how you want
to learn them. Once you sort of know them, you won&#x27;t
want to change. these are the recommendations I
have.<br><br>1. learn them in an order that allows you to
practice them in real solutions of the cube.<br>this means
learn the two six move cases for the edges and then all
of the corner cases. At this point, you can solve
the cube edges, corners, permutation. (cubin4speed
argues that just using this method you can solve the
cube in an average of sub 20 seconds) I agree for the
most part (you have to be solving the first two layers
in 10s). Anyways, this is a good start.<br>Then like
ilovemycube suggested, learn the cases where none of the
edges are solved (these are the hardest to learn and
most infrequent and have the longest number of moves)
However, seeing that none of the edges are solved is easy
and quick so you can incorporate these moves into
your solution while still speed solving.<br>Then
tackle the rest of the moves...<br><br>2. Take the time
to learn the moves the way that is best for you. Try
all of the different moves, experiment with the
different ways to hold the cube, try to find places where
you can use triggers (NOTE: I would not recommend
finishing any move with a trigger because it distracts your
recognition of the permutation). I would say that you should
let the move dictate your starting configuration and
then like you said, redraw the case for your way. It
doesn&#x27;t really matter how you recognize the case and
where you start it.<br><br>3. practice each case
manytimes before you start learning the next (mor important
as you get further along)<br><br>4. learn the
mirrors (where neccessary) while you are learning the
other move.<br><br>5. have patience.<br><br>6. One
other thought is that when getting ready for the
orientation case (right after finishing the F2L) instead of
turning the whole cube to get it to the right position,
just turn the up face. I have found this quicker.</div>

          <div class="email-content">I know a that there are people who do the first
two layers holding the cube so that the cross is on
the bottom so this isn&#x27;t new I know. I&#x27;ve started
doing the cross and the corners and edge pieces with
the cube flipped over, I form the cross on the bottom
and then finish the first two layers. I&#x27;m still
trying to get used to it but from the times I&#x27;ve
practiced it my hands don&#x27;t feel that they get in the way
of each other or anything so it seems like it would
go pretty well. I do like the fact that I never need
to flip the cube, which saves the sum .5 or .6
second it takes to flip it :-) I was curious though
becuase I used to hold the cross kind of half left and
half back, on a kind of diagonal. Is doing the first
two layers the same as the 3rd layer algorithms, you
just have to customize it for your hands or is there
one way that is better or faster than another? I
haven&#x27;t gotten used to holding the cube upside down
enough to try it fast but once I do I&#x27;ll probably know
the answer to my own question, whether one is faster
or not. But if anyone who does the cross upside down
likes it, or thinks it&#x27;s terrible or anything I&#x27;d like
to hear about it. I&#x27;m trying to find the way that&#x27;s
the fastest I can do but still comfortable to my

          <div class="email-content">I solve with the F2L on the bottom and I like
it.<br><br>My impression is that you can be comfortable and
fast using any orientation of the cube once you get
used to it (probably after months of practice). So in
my opinion it&#x27;s best to choose your orientation
based on factors like visibility, minimization of
whole-cube rotation, and overall continuity of the
solution.<br><br>Actually, I used to solve my cross on the top and then flip
it over for the rest of the solution, which caused
me to get lost sometimes when starting the F2L. I&#x27;m

          <div class="email-content">I agree with the comments of cubin4speed. I
started out forming the cross on top and keeping it there
while finishing the F2L. Main problem was finding the
cubie pairs quickly. This was particularly difficult
for the so called &#x27;separated on bottom&#x27;
cases.<br><br> So I recently began forming cross on top and
flipping cube over and solving bottom to top. I haven&#x27;t
yet been able to form cross on bottom and keep it
there; obviously this would be better. But so far, it
seems a bit easier to find the cubie pairs while
holding the cross on the bottom. Once I master the hand
movements, it should be a quicker method.<br><br>Question:
After I&#x27;ve got the cross on the bottom, I&#x27;ve been using
the right upper front corner and right front edge as
my &quot;target slots&quot; when placing the cubie pairs. Is
there a better approach? And for example, after I&#x27;ve
inserted a pair into those right &quot;target slots&quot;, say the
next pair I see are separated and belong in the back
left slots, what do I do? Right now, I&#x27;m reduced to
turning the cube to get the &quot;target slots&quot; into front
right positions to orient myself for the memorized
move. I hope this makes sense. Any help? Thanks.</div>

          <div class="email-content">In regards to slowcuber&#x27;s question:<br>Yes! I
know exactly what you mean about always using the
front right as your target slot. When your new target
slot is in the back or left, keep it there whenever
possible!<br>This may be hard at first, but soon the moves will
make sense from any position. <br>If you use this idea
AND take advantage of all empty slots to shorten your
moves (as explained by ilovemycube), then you will
almost never have to turn the cube or waste turns of the
U layer during the F2L. On a good run you can cube
straight through the F2L without any pauses.<br><br>I took
a month or two off from timing in order to practice
this, and when I started again, I had cut my times by
about 20%.<br><br><br>A while back I recommended trying

I recently picked up a cube, looked up Jiri and
Lars&#x27; sites, and started cubing. By the time I could do
it without looking at the instructions, I was at 5
minutes. Before I knew it, I was down to 3:30, and now I&#x27;m
stuck at 2:00. I now use Jiri&#x27;s method, except I have a
few legacy sequences still from Lars, and I place the
bottom corners/middle edges separately.<br><br>This is
using Meffert&#x27;s assembly cube (it looked kosher on the
web page) which is the only one I have for now.
<br><br>It takes me 15 seconds to form a cross, a minute to
finish the F2L, and 30 seconds to: orient to cross,
position corners, flip corners, move sides. I&#x27;ve tried to
think out the F2L logically, but recognition is killing
me! Anyone have any secrets for recognizing where two
cubies are and putting them together? Does Jiri&#x27;s sheet
work for you? <br><br>I tried thinking:<br> 1. Is the
face color on the corner:<br> a. down<br> b. in a
straight line with the connected cubie<br> c. in an &#x27;L&#x27;
with the connected cubie<br> 2. Are the bottom

          <div class="email-content">I used to use a method very similar to the one
you&#x27;re using now.<br><br>Depending on what you want your
times to get down to there are different things you can
do.<br><br>If you want to get your times down to about a minute
or so I would work on the F2L. Here are some ways to
practice that I found helpful,<br><br>1) Practice each of
the move situations for puting the edge piece and
corner pieces in the most. You want to get to the point
where you can do these without having to think too hard
while doing them. Decision time just comes from
practice. The more you work on solving the F2L the faster
your decision time will get.<br><br>2) Practice the
moves you use for the 3rd layer, and if possible try to
find shorter ways of doing the same move, for example
if you can find a move that rotates 3 corners in
less moves then use that.<br><br>Basically the way I
used to solve the cube was to solve a cross, then the
first two layers by inserting the edges and corners
into each of the 4 groups. Then I would orient the
edges of the third layer, place the edges, place the
corners, and then orient the corners. When I was using
this method my record time was 36 seconds and I think
I averaged in the high 40&#x27;s<br><br><br>If you are
interested in getting your times under 30 seconds or so then
I would go ahead and learn all of the moves for the
Fridrich method and practice practice practice
:-)<br><br>About the first two layers though, I would say practice
making the cross (without timing yourself). If you
practice this for fewest number of moves then eventaully
you&#x27;ll be able to recognize more positions and solve the
cross in fewer moves consistently. Usually I&#x27;ve found
that the cross can be done in 7 moves or
less.<br><br>Also practice the first two layer moves (also without
timing) just to get used to them. After enough practice
your decision time will start to noticably improve. I
hope this helps.<br><br>Chris</div>

under 10, would get pretty close. What if you were to
study all of the first two layer algorithms so that you
knew where each piece that it moved went to. Then use
a lot of finger shortcuts for each move. Just
before doing this though you would take a quick mental
picture of where the pieces are, and in your head you
would know where they went so you could decide where
the next group was (which would take a lot of
practice) but wouldn&#x27;t this allow you to solve the F2L in
extremely fast times leaving the third layer to be done in

          <div class="email-content">I think it&#x27;s definitely helpful to know how each
move affects the cube, although I&#x27;d be impressed if
anyone could actually implement this technique without
adding significant recognition/processing time. (You
would probably have to update/reinforce your mental map
in between doing each pair, and it&#x27;s usually hard
enough to find one pair to work on let alone recognizing
another future pair before starting work on the current
pair.)<br><br>Actually, it&#x27;s already possible to turn the cube at 4 moves
a second _without_ pauses during the F2L, just by
looking ahead (if you&#x27;re really on top of it). I don&#x27;t
think it&#x27;s possible to sustain 5 moves/second over a
sequence of 35 semi-randomly distributed moves, even with
triggers, and even if you know the whole thing in advance,
unless you have time to practice the sequence a
lot.<br><br>For example, I once memorized the solution to a
completely random state of the cube. (about 57 moves.) I
practiced a few times, but I could never do it much faster
than 17 seconds. I admit that it had some of my slower
moves in it, but still that means that practically
knowing the whole thing in advance I couldn&#x27;t do more
than 3.5 moves per second.<br><br>This leads me to
believe that rapid &quot;one-at-a-time&quot; turns (4/sec no
triggers) and careful looking-ahead will yield the best
times for the F2L, and furthermore that about 8 seconds
is the minimum (32 moves / 4 m/s). I&#x27;ve therefore
almost entirely phased the finger-shortcuts out of my
F2L because they cut down on fluidity and looking
ahead.<br><br>Anyway, prove me wrong and let us know how it turns out.</div>

When i do a move, it&#x27;s hard to explain, it&#x27;s almost
like I&#x27;m watching a story, as crazy as that sounds.
Each time you do a move on the cube look at what the
cube looks like and associate it with something that
it reminds you of. Then when you get that set in
your head do the next move and associate it with
something. When you&#x27;re solving the cube and you come to that
move again the first thing that will pop into your
head is the first part of the &quot;story&quot; that you created
by practicing the move and then you&#x27;ll remember what
the design is after the first move, therefore you
remember the first move. The rest come the same

I would bail and look for another pair. There are
some situations though that you would want to take
that pair. Say you solved the FR and FL pairs already
and then this situation comes up. If both of the last
two pairs have a piece not in the U layer (already in
the BR or BL position) then take the first pair you
see and put it together. Here&#x27;s a short move that can
also be helpful in your position. Say the corner you
need is in the URF position with the color of the
cross facing upwards. And the edge piece that it pairs
with is in the BL position, the side of the edge with
the color of the back face is on the back face. If
this happens turn the U face so that the corner is
directly over the edge piece, they will connect and look
solved. Then (assuming that the now solved edge pair in
BL, which is upside down, needs to go the BR
position) do the move B2 R B2 R&#x27;. This will solve the edge
group into the BL position.<br><br><br>>Situation:

corners are. Scan the U face for an edge that doesn&#x27;t
have the color of the U face. For example if the U
face is green look for an edge in the U layer that
doesn&#x27;t have any green on it, it will belong in the F2L.
Then while you scanning for the edge at the same time
try to see where each corner is. Once you find the
edge you should hopefully remember where it&#x27;s corner
is, if not turn the cube quickly again to find the
corner (make sure to remember where the edge is!) then
pair them up and place them. With practice this
situation should get easier.<br><br><br>>Another pain:

misunderstanding here somewhere. If the pair needs to go to the BR
position and it is directly above it and in the correct
position to do the move then yes you can do it from a
different angle, so the move would be B U2 B&#x27; U&#x27;B U B&#x27; from
the way you are looking at it but in your head you&#x27;re
still doing the same move (just mentally rotate it so
that it look the same way that you are used to doing
it)<br><br><br>>And, for the &quot;separated on top&quot; moves, you have
learned the moves to place them when the target slot is
BL, BR, FR, or FL, and regardless of where the two

same moves and they still have to be in the correct

          <div class="email-content">I just figured out that for some reason there is
a move planted in my head somehow that I do
repeatedly when I scramble the cube that I never realized I
did. If I do L2 B2 then it sets off this next move
that I do without realizing I&#x27;m doing it, without
think about it at all, it&#x27;s very strange. The move in
all is<br><br>L2 B2 (sets off the move) U L R&#x27; B&#x27;
L&#x27;<br><br>The reason that I noticed the move was because I must
have a longer move that is somehow triggered by doing
this move because yesterday while I was speed solving
I scrambled the cube to the exact same position 3
times. The first time I was just scrambling the cube, I
think I did the above triggered move a few times. Then
I studied the cross and solved it. Then I just
started randomly scrambling the cube. I remember doing
the above triggered move a few times. When I started
studying the cube to pick which face I would do the cross
on I noticed that it was in the exact same position!
So I solved the cross the same way as before but did
the F2L pairs differently so that a different
situation come up for the 3rd layer algorithms. Then after
I did that I started randomly scrambling the cube
and it came to the exact same position as before! I
must have some really long trigger move that I repeat
or something without thinking about it that is set
off by some move. It&#x27;s the starangest thing though.
The move I wrote above is so burned into my head that
if I do L2 B2, unless it&#x27;s associated with another
memorized move I know, then I just immediately, and almost
as if I&#x27;m not controlling my hands I do the rest of
the move. It took me forever to try to write down the
moves. I had to do the move over and over and try to
notice what the next move was wach time. Has anyone ever
experienced this? Or scrambled to the same position more than
once?<br><br>heh heh or have I just gone waaaaaay too far off the
deep end? :-)<br><br>the voices have been talking

          <div class="email-content">I have definitely experienced this same thing.
You just scramble the cube so much that you
inevitably start developing a sequence that you regularly
repeat. I have had the exact same solution two times in a
row, which was wierd because the second time I
realized it and started expecting what was
coming.<br><br>Solution: Now when I scramble it I do about 5 or 6 totally
random turns then keep doing my fast more regular mixup.
I also just try to include random triggers here and
there, and spin the cube in the middle to change which
face is up...All this seems to work pretty well.</div>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve decided to try and learn all the moves
necessary to do the 3rd layer in one algorithm. There are
1211 total, and seeing as I already know 53 of those
moves (each move from the two algorithm method can be
used) so I need to learn 1158 more moves. I figured I&#x27;m
going to learn these in steps. First I&#x27;m going to learn
all the moves where all four edges need to be
flipped, around 150 or so, then I want to learn all the
ones where all the edges are fine, and corners need to
be flipped. Then I&#x27;m going to learn the rest, with
two edges, in groups, like C&#x27;s and L&#x27; and all. I was
curious if anyone knew of anyone else who&#x27;s ever tried to
do this. I know that it&#x27;s going to take literally
years to learn all the moves, but I&#x27;m going to try to
incorporate the moves I know into my solution method so that
I can start to learn them really well. <br><br>The
reason I wanted to switch is that I&#x27;m using the Cube
Explorer and Cube Optimizer program at
<a href=http://home.t-online.de/home/Kociemba/cube.htm target=new>http://home.t-online.de/home/Kociemba/cube.htm</a> to find all the moves and they all seem to be
between 11 and 16 moves. I figured if I can on average
cut almost 10 moves off my solution, and work on the
first two layers, I finally figured out what you all
meant about taking advantage of empty slots during the
first part. For example I see how to put a corner or
edge in using only 5 moves instead of 7 or 8. I
figured that I could do the cube in 13 or 14 seconds on a
good time and under 20 pretty much every time. If
anyone has any info on this then I&#x27;d be glad to hear it.
I figured if I memorize the moves right, in groups,
then I won&#x27;t forget them as I&#x27;ll know to practice each
group, and it should also be relatively easy to
recognize the positions. I tried just recognizing the
positions (position and orientation of the pieces) of the
third layer after solving the first two and it usually
takes around 2 seconds, so I figure with practice I
might be able to cut that to under 2 seconds. Anyway if
anyone is interested I can give you the moves I know so
far, or you can download the Cube Explorer and
Optimizer program to find them. Or if anyone would also
like to try this then let me know. It would be cool to
be able to learn the moves with someone. I&#x27;ll post a
message on here if I recognize a position and am able to
do the 3rd layer in one move when I speed solve, and
how much time it takes. I don&#x27;t know very many moves
but when I see one I know I&#x27;ll let you all know how
it went. Anyway if anyone has any info on this
please let me know, I&#x27;d be interested in hearing
it.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Chris</div>

          <div class="email-content">In response to your 2nd question when I first
examine the cube before solving I decide what moves I&#x27;ll
do to solve the cross, and then I try to find a pair
and figure what it&#x27;s position will be so I already
know the move for the first group. If the setting
overall is complicated and I can&#x27;t seem to figure out the
orientation on the first pair after I will solve the cross
then I just try to figure out where the pieces will
be, and while I&#x27;m solving the cross I try to figure
out what their orientation will be. I think that it
is best not to look at the cube after you&#x27;ve done a
step, but rather to examine it while you&#x27;re doing
whatever move you&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;m not sure about the 2 sec.
pause in Dans video, but from what I remember I think
he just slowed down to about 1 move per sec. but I&#x27;m
not sure. Anyway in response to your question yes I
think it is quicker to go ahead and have an idea of
where the first corner-edge pair will be after solving
the cross. It may take more time examining the cube
before you start but it will help your times a
lot.<br><br>Chris</div>

moves. Then as a move turns up again and again, I start
to try to remember the next several turns, R&#x27; U&#x27;.
Usually you can see how the move finishes from the last
three turns or so.<br><br>I also say the move to myself
as I am doing it when I am learning a new move, I
find this really helps me.<br><br>And then eventually
the move is remembered all in my hands. Your hands
can remember a surprising amount of moves.<br><br>My
huge problem is finding the cube pairs quickly in F2L;
that to me is the biggest challenge with this method.</div>
