Stupid me forgot to mention that I didn&#x27;t bother writing down &quot;2&quot; for 
the vertical turns. So try:

(l2 U&#x27;) (r2 U&#x27;)*4 (R2 U&#x27;)

If you understand parities, this is real easy. In a certain easy to 
reach shape you can change parity with a single twist. Think about it.

I kind of do. I don&#x27;t have a good way of getting to the star-shape <br>
though. There must be some easy to memorize alg that does this and <br>
then I can use it&#x27;s inverse to come back.<br>
<br>
In fact I don&#x27;t know any of the algs to get from star-shape to cube-<br>
shape. I think there are 5 cases right? Erm... if I feel ambitious <br>
enough I&#x27;ll try to learn them.<br>
<br>
Another question that comes to mind for me is: Is it a necessary <br>
requirment to get to star-shape in order to flip the parity of the <br>
puzzle? Or in otherwords, is there existance of an alg that changes <br>
parity without encountering the star-shape?<br>
<br>
Okay, I&#x27;m going to mix up my sq-1 now! I only solve it a few times a <br>
year, but it&#x27;s an hour away from the new year, I&#x27;m alone, and <br>
avoiding alcohol at all costs... :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Happy New Year to all our puzzle friends!<br>
<br>
2006 was a great year for cubing.<br>
<br>
We had 33 official WCA competitions (2005: 24).<br>
If you want a competition near you, then why not organize it yourself. <br>
We can help! I am looking very much forward to new countries, <br>
especially China, India and Russia.<br>
<br>
We had 822 3x3 solvers in WCA competitions (2005: 517).<br>
<br>
The only WRs that weren&#x27;t broken in 2006 were:<br>
- 3x3 Fewest moves (though it was equaled)<br>
- Rubik&#x27;s Clock (single and average)<br>
Source:<br>
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?<br>
regionId=&amp;eventId=&amp;years=&amp;history=History<br>
<br>
We had 6544 unofficial world record items posted on speedcubing.com. <br>
(2005: 4405). This is an average of 17.93 per day.<br>
<br>
We had many many tv appearances, including some big ones in USA, Japan, <br>
Korea and Taiwan. Our hobby is getting more and more popular.<br>
<br>
I hope we will meet again this year.<br>
You don&#x27;t want to miss the World Championship 2007 in Budapest!<br>
It will be announced soon.<br>
<br>
Let 2007 be a year in good health for us all, with more competitions, <br>
in more countries, with more competitors, with better results, under <br>
fair conditions and with more fun!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

Viewing the message on yahoo.com that link gets broken and doesn&#x27;t 
show the history. Short enough version:

You are going to love this: /(-3,-3)/(0,-1)/(2,-4)/(4,-2)/(1,0)/(-3,-3)/

As some of you may remember, I compiled some &quot;combined world rankings&quot;<br>

2006 has been compiled.<br>
<br>
Combined rankings is the sum of a persoon&#x27;s 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5<br>
final world ranking for that year, and aims to show the best overall<br>
cubers of that year.<br>

Dude... Sinpei Araki rocked on that show!  Japanese television is <br>
always orders of magnitudes crazier than anything in the United States. <br>
  Roller coaster blindfold solve?  Electrodes attached all over his <br>
head?  Insane...<br>
<br>
They&#x27;ll be sending him to Cape Canaveral and launching him into space <br>
next.<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t understand a single word of that video, but it was awesome.  I <br>
think the WCA might want to consider mandating blindfolds like his for <br>
all future competitions.<br>
<br>
I know he probably doesn&#x27;t know much English (and I apologize for not <br>
knowing any Japanese), but if someone knows him, do let him know that <br>
video was of fantastic!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Before reading this I found a better one myself. It&#x27;s almost the 
same:

/(3,3)/(1,0)/(4,-2)/(-4,2)/(-1,0)/(-3,-3)/

It should be obvious why it works... it&#x27;s a quick conjugation of 
the &quot;/&quot;. This nice thing aboout this one is that all it does on the 
top layer is an H-Perm and leaves the edges in place on the bottom.

          <div class="email-content">Okay so I said I might do this a few days ago and finally did... Some 
of you are gonna think I&#x27;m crazy for doing this or have too much time 
on my hands...

I translated this Warren Liao youTube video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZLJy982deQ

It&#x27;s been a hobby of mine to translate Chinese texts. I&#x27;m pretty bad 
at it though, but I enjoy the practice. I&#x27;ve only studied Manderin for 
4 semesters so if someone here can offer me some tips/corrections that 
be nice.

However, it is exaushtive and includes pronuniciations. I was 
following a format I&#x27;d do for my Asian studies courses.

So probably no one&#x27;s gonna read it, but I expect Jon to since he sort 
of asked for it. Please, nobody link this in the youTube comments... I 
just would rather not have it there.

It is a *.doc so you need MS Word, OpenOffice, or something equivalent 
but should be new enough to interpret Asian chracters. I&#x27;m also 
betting that most of you don&#x27;t have any Chinese fonts installed... so 
it might not look right so I included a sample screen capure of how it 
should appear.

Check it out here if you are interested: http://www-
personal.umich.edu/~dlli/Translations/

I couldn&#x27;t make out a few of the chracters and used &quot;&lt;?>&quot; as a 
placeholder. If you know what those should be, tell me plz.

It&#x27;s a lovely video, really... (they did do some time snips so it 
appears more impressive than it really is, but still incredibly 
impressive).

          <div class="email-content">Thanks to that post (and my incredible baredom lately), I&#x27;ve fianlly 
managed to start timing myself on the sq-1. I got a 3:52 on my first 
timing.

I&#x27;m inspired to take up sq-1 now. I should be breaking 90 sec soon. I 
am coming up with lots of nifty algs and learning them quicker than I 
would have expected. I think Patterson would be proud of me :).

I&#x27;ll be posting an UWR once I feel confident about it.

I&#x27;m using a method where I first go to star-shape and then get to cube-
shape, (unless it&#x27;s obivous how to get there directly, but I&#x27;m also 
going to learn a set of algs that go from one square side to square-
shape). Next, I solve a layer intuitively (D layer). I then check for 
parity and do a parity alg if necessary (although it&#x27;s messes up a lot 
of things... and I have to resolve a layer). Then I do either a &quot;J-
Perm/L-Perm&quot; or an &quot;N-Perm&quot; and finish up.

I&#x27;m learning all 5 cases for star-to-cube. I almost know all 
the &quot;PLLs&quot;, but I might not want to learn V and Y... although Y is not 
a bad case to do.

The biggest problem I have now is to come up with better 3-edge cycle 
algs. I&#x27;m not happy with how complicated the ones I found are.

Too bad they don&#x27;t actually say anything interesting. I didn&#x27;t realize 
how lame the commentary was till I started concentrating on what they 
where saying. I was dazzled by the actual cubing. In contrast, that 
Japanese video that was recently posted on speedcubing.com would 
probably have very interesting commentary. Too bad I know absolutely 
no Japanese. Any one care to translate..., just a little (whatever you 
think is interesting - factual, but not obvious to us)?

I&#x27;m starting to think that in general commentary sucks on Chinese TV 
shows. (I have 3 chinese tv channels on satellite that I watch.) It 
would be much better if talk shows do their *homework* beforehand and 
skip the obvious questions.

Thanks, Jon.

well under two minutes contingent on no mistakes, and I&#x27;ve got

I&#x27;m doing the same get-to-cube as you are (star->cube unless I 
recognize the pattern), but then I&#x27;m pretty much doing the method 
Lars Vandenbergh describes on his page (separate corners, separate 
edges, solve corners, solve edges) with a few more substeps in there 
since I haven&#x27;t learned all the algs yet.  Ultimately I hope to 
learn optimal getting-to-cube, but that&#x27;s not a top priority.

          <div class="email-content">A really sharp scrape-rite if used properly can get most of it. But 
first, it&#x27;s probably in the sticker-removal where your efforts are 
best spent. It is possible to remove stickers in such a way as to 
minimize the amount of residue left.

Probably because I&#x27;m so used to doing it, I just rub the gunk off with 
my thumb. And even if I use other approaches I always finish off by 
using my thumb, I like how it gives it a fine coat of skin oils (thus 
making it easier to peel a sticker next time).

Never use alcohol to on the exterior of your cube. It&#x27;s not going to 
do anything. On a separate note, the use of acetone can soften the 
plastic a bit and yield a smoother feel to a cube, but use short 
exposure times.

Anyways, the solution I offer is to use a product called &quot;Goo Gone&quot;. I 
got myself a large volume of it and it is great with dissolving just 
about anything sticky and/or oily. (I use it to clean my pots and pans 
sometimes when they get really ugly, but it&#x27;s synthetic so is probably 
posionous if ingested...)
 
I don&#x27;t believe it disolves the cube plastic, but I&#x27;ve always tried to 
keep the exposure to a minimal. It&#x27;s very strong, I apply it with a 
cotton swap and immediately wipe it off with a cloth or tissue.

Will S. needs a real speedcube though, that one in the clip doesn&#x27;t 
look so great...

His technique could still use a lot of work. He is consistant, seems 
to know his stuff well, and his reaction time isn&#x27;t bad. Practicing a 
good cubing style and aquiring a cube that is loose enough to do U/U&#x27; 
using the index fingers - I believe are what would help his times the 
most.

&quot;He probably practices this every day&quot;??? I&#x27;m sure if he did that then 
he&#x27;d be breaking 30s by now. This guy actually has a life though, 
unlike some of us o_O...

He kissed her on the cheeks! But he&#x27;s married... so I don&#x27;t know about 
that. (I am the type of person that woulnd&#x27;t touch another woman once 
I get married.) I think that girl is really hot!

I say we boycott them. Real cubers don&#x27;t look for records in that book 
anyway. They suck. And the 42 cubes guy should be ashamed. Not because 
he&#x27;s so slow but because he has the gall to pretend he&#x27;s any good. 
Guinness authoritative for records? Yeah right.

 You know... his technique could use a lot of work, but it&#x27;s just not a

oh, another thing I found is that using that blade from cubesmith is actually worse (at least for me). It lefts more &quot;goo&quot; on the cube that using your hands to peel the stickers...

 Hm, I was always under the impression that before applying stickers,
 you should clean off the surface very cleanly...I was wondering how
 pro cubers resticker their cubes at competitions when the need for it
 arises. Though, perhaps I was under the wrong impression...?

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I just wanted to post about a fun opportunity I had on New Year&#x27;s <br>
Eve.  The organization that runs our New Year&#x27;s Eve party downtown <br>
read about me in that article I was in in my local paper and hired <br>
me to do a cubing workshop downtown on New Year&#x27;s Eve.  They gave me <br>
a fairly long room and a good amount of space in the city museum <br>
just after you come in off the street.  I brought my Stackmat timer <br>
display and Stackmat so I could do demonstration solves as well as <br>
let other cubers try the mat.<br>
<br>
I did manage to find 3 other cubers, one guy solved on the mat in <br>
about 2:30, another guy in about 3:10.  Another lady could also <br>
solve it but didn&#x27;t get through a whole solve on the timer.<br>
<br>
I mostly showed people speedsolves, a couple blindfolded solves, and <br>
spent the largest part of my time describing the steps of a beginner <br>
method.  I showed people how to form the cross, how to solve the <br>
corners, then from there just described the flow of the solve after <br>
that.<br>
<br>
They gave me 5 cubes to put on the table in front of me for anyone <br>
to use, and they were constantly in people&#x27;s hands and people were <br>
trying them out.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d say at it&#x27;s largest I would be solving for a crowd of about 40 <br>
people, and sometimes as few as 5-10.  I was basically in the <br>
entrance to the museum so people were constantly passing through and <br>
just watching for a few minutes, but at times a large number of <br>
people would stop to watch.<br>
<br>
I attempted 5 blindfolded solves during the workshop and DNF&#x27;d 3 of <br>
them, but got 2 of them successfully.  The successful times were <br>
something like 2:45 and 3:10.<br>
<br>
I was really trying to pitch that the cube is not as hard as people <br>
say it is, and that all it takes is a little bit of persistance.  I <br>
told people that if they do get frustrated I recommend trying to <br>
find some hints on the internet, which is what I did.  I also said <br>
that if anyone did want to figure it out on their own, it&#x27;s <br>
absolutely possible and all it takes is some persistance with it.<br>
<br>
The workshop was fun, I met a lot of former cubers who could solve <br>
in in the 80&#x27;s but couldn&#x27;t remember their whole method now so I <br>
would show those people the next step for whatever step they were <br>
stuck at.  People were usually passing through to the rest of the <br>
museum, and I was right by the front door so I usually only had time <br>
to show people 1 step.<br>
<br>
There were a LOT of kids who kept coming up and trying out the <br>
cubes.  A couple of the kids I was able to show how to get a cross <br>
on one side, and every single one of them was totally hooked and <br>
didn&#x27;t want to leave when their parents said they had to.  A good <br>
number of them asked their parents if they could go and buy a cube <br>
which I thought was cool ;-)<br>
<br>
I got the &quot;I used to peel the stickers&quot; comment about 5 times during <br>
the time I was there heh heh, which wasn&#x27;t so bad I was kind of <br>
expecting more :-)  I mostly just said &quot;Well that works true, but it <br>
sure takes a while ;-)&quot;<br>
<br>
Anyway I had a blast, and the people who managed to come to the <br>
workshop really seemed to enjoy trying out the cubes and learning <br>
the first step or 2 of the beginner method I was showing.  People <br>
absolutely went crazy over the blindfolded solves, even on the times <br>
when I DNF&#x27;d since there were still a good number of pieces solved.  <br>
The two solves I got successfully the crowd applauded.  For BLD <br>
cubing I was also pitching that it&#x27;s not impossible or even super <br>
difficult.  I told people I don&#x27;t have a photographic memory and <br>
that I just memorize the instructions to myself of how to solve, so <br>
in effect after I stop looking at the cube (I didn&#x27;t have a <br>
blindfold so I just looked down at the floor and held the cube high <br>
over my head while solving) I have no idea what the cube looks like, <br>
I only know what to do in order to solve it.<br>
<br>
Anyway I didn&#x27;t get any pictures sadly, but I wanted to do a writeup <br>
about it since it was so much fun.<br>
<br>
The best part.  Not ONCE - not one single time did anyone say &quot;Oh <br>
hey the cube is back!&quot; or &quot;Oh that 80&#x27;s toy, wow I haven&#x27;t seen one <br>
of those in years!&quot;.  I think the cube is already &quot;back&quot; - I never <br>
hear comments about how it&#x27;s on the comeback or how it&#x27;s an old 80&#x27;s <br>
fad, everyone is just used to it again now!<br>
<br>
I did meet a few people who hadn&#x27;t physically messed around with a <br>
cube since the 80&#x27;s but nobody said anything about how they hadn&#x27;t <br>
even seen a cube since the 80&#x27;s, or mentioned how the cube was <br>
an &quot;80&#x27;s fad&quot; that was coming back.  That makes me really happy, I <br>
think cubing is continuing to grow and hopefully will continue even <br>
through 2007!<br>
<br>
Hope everyone had a Happy New Year - and as always happy cubing,<br>
Chris<br>

Not a second one, true, but at least he does have all letters and 
he&#x27;s the only one:

  &gt; If you understand parities, this is real easy. In a certain easy <br>
  to <br>
  &gt; reach shape you can change parity with a single twist. Think about <br>
  it.<br>

  I kind of do. I don&#x27;t have a good way of getting to the star-shape <br>
  though. There must be some easy to memorize alg that does this and <br>
  then I can use it&#x27;s inverse to come back.<br>
<br>
  In fact I don&#x27;t know any of the algs to get from star-shape to cube-<br>
  shape. I think there are 5 cases right? Erm... if I feel ambitious <br>
  enough I&#x27;ll try to learn them.<br>
<br>
  Another question that comes to mind for me is: Is it a necessary <br>
  requirment to get to star-shape in order to flip the parity of the <br>
  puzzle? Or in otherwords, is there existance of an alg that changes <br>
  parity without encountering the star-shape?<br>
<br>
  Okay, I&#x27;m going to mix up my sq-1 now! I only solve it a few times a <br>
  year, but it&#x27;s an hour away from the new year, I&#x27;m alone, and <br>
  avoiding alcohol at all costs... :)<br>

  Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
  As some of you may remember, I compiled some &quot;combined world rankings&quot;<br>
  lists for 2005 and 2004. The final version (not taking into account<br>
  errors which hopefully aren&#x27;t present but may have crept in...) for<br>
  2006 has been compiled.<br>
<br>
  Combined rankings is the sum of a persoon&#x27;s 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5<br>
  final world ranking for that year, and aims to show the best overall<br>
  cubers of that year.<br>
<br>
  2006<br>
  1. Ron van Bruchem (Netherlands)<br>
  2. Lars Vandenbergh (Belgium)<br>
  3. Joel van Noort (Netherlands)<br>
  4. Bernett Orlando (India)<br>
  5. Frank Morris (USA)<br>
  6. Michael Fung (Netherlands)<br>
  7. Tomasz Zolnowski (Poland)<br>
  8. Andrew Kang (USA)<br>
  9. Matt Walter (Canada)<br>
  10. Dan Harris (United Kingdom)<br>
<br>
  The full spreadsheet is available at<br>
  http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/wcacombinedrankings2006.xls - so you<br>
  can see where you rank for 2006.<br>

  I was *so* close to spending new years in Chapel Hill too! I would 
  have, if I knew for sure I could hang out with chris there. However 
  our means of contacting him are somewhat limited these days... >_&lt;.

  ---------------------------
  It is always great news to hear that cubing is in the media again.
  However, it used to be that various media things would be stashed 
  somewhere on the internet for us to grab. I really pride myself on 
  my collection of cubing in the media clips and have noticed a huge 
  decline in people archiving such things.

  I used to hope to collect every single piece of cube-in-media clips 
  in the last 10 yrs... having things on youTube for a short while is 
  no good. grrr...

  Anyhow, two things I would really like to have: a clip of DanK on 
  the Ellen D. show, and a clip of Will S. on Oprah.

  Also I want to take this opportunity to point out some new cube 
  sightings I made! Episode 1x21 of &quot;Angel&quot; features a cube and 
  Pyraminx. There is also one episode of &quot;Buffy&quot; that has a cube on 
  one of the character&#x27;s nightstands (impling they cube). I forgot 
  which one, and wonder if someone here knows.

  I have yet to watch &quot;Happyness&quot;... :(. But for those of you who 
  have, how many scenes is there a cube? Just the one? (I hope not!)

one who compiled these lists :) ) - the 2x2x2 is more of an event like
the magic or clock. I feel that the 2x2x2 cube is much more about
mindless execution of a system compared to the skill it takes to
solve, than the 3x3x3 cubes and upwards.

I can&#x27;t explain myself very well, but heres what i mean, in
HYPOTHETICAL numbers.

if the threshold were say 10% skill (seeing shortcuts, looking ahead,
special tricks, etc) and 90% mindless execution
3x3x3 could be 20:80
4x4x4 30:70
5x5x5 50:50

but 2x2x2 5:95
magic 0:100

etc

Megaminx could be included in the list, but then it would discount too
many people as you have to have a solve in all the events to feature
on the list. So in short I discounted 2x2x2 becasue it adds very
little about a persons skill.

But of course you&#x27;re welcome to compile an alternative list!

However, I don&#x27;t understand why you don&#x27;t list the 2x2x2?

          <div class="email-content">I did a search on &quot;lubricant&#x27; to find older posts on this topic with
high hopes that I could find a more definitive answer as to what type
of lubricant to use. 

I actually just came back from Lowe&#x27;s after purchasing a can of Teflon
Silicon Spray, but after reading some of the messages, I decided
against using it. As a result, I decided to finally use my Cube Lube
that I obtained when I purchased a DIY kit from Rubiks.com. I have two
questions on this matter: 1) How much of the cube lube should I use? I
put about 1/4 of the syringe in, and 2) Immediately after putting the
Cube Lube in, I began playing around with my cube and noticed that
there was some Lube dripping and seeping out from all over my Rubik&#x27;s
Cube. Is this a sign that I put too much Cube Lube in? And of course,
the Cube Lube will eventually dry up won&#x27;t it?

Thanks.

I don&#x27;t agree with this one. Putting the 2x2x2 almost on a par with the magic as a puzzle 
is absolutely ridiculous. The top guys have recorded averages of under 5 seconds and I 
think that takes tremendous skill.

But great work nonetheless.

Kind regards,
Lars

Hmm, actually the only person &quot;f a s t e r  t h a n  j e a n&quot; is 
Thijs Feenstra (Francois doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;j&#x27;). But Francois is the

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Lars on this one. Solving the 2x2 fast requires a lot of
looking ahead.

Great work by the way - and it makes me sad that I did not participate
in a 5x5 event yet.

Maybe, is it possible to integrate this kind of &quot;combined rankings&quot; in
the WCA database (kind of like a bonus feature) ?

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I kinda like that idea too. :-)

But seriosly, I see that a lot of people find 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 the
main events, but I think that 2x2 is quite a big event too. But then
again one-handed maybe is bigger than 2x2.

          <div class="email-content">Yesterday morning I was in Marrkech Airport and I was cubing one-handed in
the line for the check-in. Then the Italians in the line next to me
applaused and they I asked me if I was the World Champion.

I replied that I was &quot;only European Champion&quot;.
Then they asked me if they could record a solve and I agreed.

The solve was just 25 seconds (which I can reach more and more nowadays).
:-)

But I have to say I didn&#x27;t reach sub20 in a long time (thanks to a very low
level of practice).

So if you happen to see that video (one guy starts the video by talking in
Italian - saying that I was the European Champion I guess), please send it
to me. :p

(Congratulations Gunnar :-))

Did you do the compilation by hand, or were you using some sort of

to develop a list with a few more events.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I did the compilation by hand. I copied 3 lists into excel from the
world rankings. I sorted them alphabetically. Went down the list of
5x5x5 competitors, and deleted the ones on the 4x4x4 and 3x3x3 that
didn&#x27;t appear on the 5x5x5. Of course if they appeared on 5x5x5 but
not in 4x4x4 or 3x3x3 they were deleted too.

Then add up the rankings of the remaining competitors, and sort by
combined total.

But I&#x27;m sure that if you can get the permission, you should be able to
run a script against the new WCA database to easily produce these
lists. Best bet is to ask Ron.

I would like to see my list as part of the official rankings, but I&#x27;m
sure the events/categories will get modified if Ron ever decided to
add it, such as including the 2x2x2 or something like that.

I personally think that the 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5 events only make
up a nicer and more important list than any other combination.

Dan :)

Good luck on your workshop, and yes definitely let us know how it goes!

Also, in case anyone is interested here is the video from when I was 
on the news talking about the workshop I held.

http://www.wral.com/news/local/video/1118393/

My appearance is right at 40 seconds into the video.

          wow! incredible! I am really surprised to see my name in top-10. I really don&#x27;t know I deserve it or not. But I am motivated.Thanks Dan.
          So many great cubers missing in the top is unbelieveable. Perhaps a different strategy to workout the combined ranking considering the avg and not the single best solve is a good alternative option.

          <div class="email-content">Cube lube is actually floorwax. Eventually it will dry up, but the effect will remain for about 2 weeks. I use 1 small drop on every side of every edge (2*12=24), you could also use 1 small drop on every side of every corner (3*8=24). You really shouldn&#x27;t use more, maybe even less. I can use 1 syringe to apply to a 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 for about 6 times.

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Lubricant


  I did a search on &quot;lubricant&#x27; to find older posts on this topic with
  high hopes that I could find a more definitive answer as to what type
  of lubricant to use. 

  I actually just came back from Lowe&#x27;s after purchasing a can of Teflon
  Silicon Spray, but after reading some of the messages, I decided
  against using it. As a result, I decided to finally use my Cube Lube
  that I obtained when I purchased a DIY kit from Rubiks.com. I have two
  questions on this matter: 1) How much of the cube lube should I use? I
  put about 1/4 of the syringe in, and 2) Immediately after putting the
  Cube Lube in, I began playing around with my cube and noticed that
  there was some Lube dripping and seeping out from all over my Rubik&#x27;s
  Cube. Is this a sign that I put too much Cube Lube in? And of course,
  the Cube Lube will eventually dry up won&#x27;t it?

  Thanks.

          <div class="email-content">I strongly disagree about the 2x2x2. For me the 2x2x2 is about 25% seeing shortcuts/inspection, 25% looking ahead and only 50% mindless execution. My best solve ever was at Dutch Open 2006 and I saw the entire solve during inspection. Execution was really slow, but I still got a 5.69s.

Actually I decide which method I am going to use and which color to start on halfway during inspection. On the 3x3x3 I always use the same method and always start on the same color.

But you are right, it is your list so don&#x27;t include it if you don&#x27;t want to. I will make two alternative lists soon including the 2x2x2. The first one will have the ranking system you came up with (absolute position on each list) and the second one will have an alternative ranking system (relative position, based on the number of competitors in each discipline)

  I didn&#x27;t include the 2x2x2 because in my opinion (remember I am the
  one who compiled these lists :) ) - the 2x2x2 is more of an event like
  the magic or clock. I feel that the 2x2x2 cube is much more about
  mindless execution of a system compared to the skill it takes to
  solve, than the 3x3x3 cubes and upwards.

  I can&#x27;t explain myself very well, but heres what i mean, in
  HYPOTHETICAL numbers.

  if the threshold were say 10% skill (seeing shortcuts, looking ahead,
  special tricks, etc) and 90% mindless execution
  3x3x3 could be 20:80
  4x4x4 30:70
  5x5x5 50:50

  but 2x2x2 5:95
  magic 0:100

  etc

  Megaminx could be included in the list, but then it would discount too
  many people as you have to have a solve in all the events to feature
  on the list. So in short I discounted 2x2x2 becasue it adds very
  little about a persons skill.

  But of course you&#x27;re welcome to compile an alternative list!

Good :-)

Oh well, you&#x27;re of course by far not the only one. I think many 
people even still haven&#x27;t read the rules at all. So every now and 
then I try to bring the issue up if there&#x27;s an opportunity like that.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone !<br>
<br>
I was wondering how many stickers can we remove from a 3x3x3 cube, so<br>
that the cube is still solvable in one way ?<br>
<br>
For the corners, we can remove the 3 stickers from one corner, and one<br>
from every other corner safely, and we can surely remove some other<br>
one, but which one (I&#x27;m allowing here to swap two corners, as we don&#x27;t<br>
know yet if it&#x27;s better to allow swapping 2 corners or 2 edges)<br>
<br>
For the edges, we can remove the 2 stickers from one edge, but for the<br>
others ??<br>
We can remove one sticker of two edges, so that the remaining color of<br>
the first is opposite to the remaining one of the second.<br>
What else ??<br>
<br>
And for the centers ?<br>
We can remove all of them except two adjacent one. But what if we can<br>
still solve the cube with another color scheme ??<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have already tackled this question about 4.5 years ago. The answer 
is known to be 21 stickers maximal that can be removed while 
maintaining uniqueness. 4 from the centers, 10 from the corners, 6 
from the edges, and then another one somewhere due to the dependence 
between CP and EP.

I had to prove this rigoriously for a math club talk I gave back 
then.

I could still be wrong. I&#x27;m not too confident about this anymore. I 
spent a lot of time on this question and that was what I came up 
with. Back then I was quite confident of this number. I&#x27;m betting 
someone is going to try really hard to disprove it though.

  Well, it&#x27;s not anything for me. There&#x27;s a man there, his name is Cecil
  Smith. He donated a bunch of Rubik&#x27;s Cubes to the Smithsonian. Prior to
  that, he had a collection of cubes... about 6000 of them. Probably a very
  unique peak into the pasttime of our hobby... if you&#x27;re interested.

          <div class="email-content">For the corners im almost very sure that you can remove 12 stickers.

Example Yellow=U, Red=F:
U layer remove UFL:Yellow,Red,Blue
               UBL:Orange,Blue
               UBR:Orange
               UFR:Green

D layer remove DFL:Red,Blue
               DBL:Orange
               DBR:Green
               DFR:Red
For the edges im thinking you can remove 7 But i have to look for it 
a little bit harder :)

But what i think now is this:
White,Blue edge remove White and BLue
White,Green Remove Green
Yellow,Blue remove Blue
Yellow,Red remove Yellow
Orange,Blue remove Blue
Orange,Green remove Orange

for center i come up with you can remove 4.

total count 23 strickers removed.

          <div class="email-content">Summary: Why is the corner always shown in the proper position already?<br>
<br>
Hi all.  I&#x27;m relatively new to speedcubing, about two weeks, although<br>
I&#x27;ve been solving it with slower methods (see below) for years<br>
off-and-on.  I&#x27;m barely sub-2mins at this point and have decided to<br>
tackle things one step at a time, meaning right now I&#x27;m only timing my<br>
F2L step.  (Currently about 0:57 average, and basically Friedrich<br>
method.)  One thing about all these F2L algorithm sites has got me<br>
really perplexed and I&#x27;ve also thrown in a couple misc questions<br>
afterwards as well.<br>
<br>
-- Question 1 --<br>
<br>
On all these algorithms they always show the corner properly<br>
positioned or the edge properly positioned as the starting point,<br>
except of course when both are in the top layer.  But my question is:<br>
 What if this is not the case?  What if the corner is in fact in the<br>
bottom layer but not in its proper slot?  What I assumed one was to<br>
do, and what I currently do, is execute the &quot;algorithm&quot; until the<br>
point where both pieces are in the top layer either joined or in the<br>
&quot;potential set&quot; position.  Then twist the U face until things are<br>
properly oriented and do the actual insert.  This is all fairly<br>
intuitive.  I guess that&#x27;s what makes me suspicious of my own methods<br>
though -- although I _prefer_ to, should I really have to use even an<br>
inkling of intuition while reading a site containing a gazillion F2L<br>
algorithms?<br>
<br>
What mystifies me is why none of these sites has gone right out and<br>
say that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to do, explicitly.  Moreoever there<br>
are those &quot;black box&quot; algorithms that could ONLY work if things were<br>
oriented exactly as described.  One example that I can think of off<br>
the top of my head, but which is not all that &quot;black&quot;, is (R U R&#x27;<br>
U&#x27;)x3.  Assuming the two pieces in question are not in the proper slot<br>
what I&#x27;m forced to do is the first TWO repeats, position U face, then<br>
do the insert.  That one&#x27;s easy though... the black box algorithms<br>
which really do disturb the cross across multiple moves I wouldn&#x27;t<br>
want to even begin to try such an approach with.  <br>
<br>
All this leads me to believe I&#x27;m making more work for myself than I<br>
should be.  If this was how folks were &quot;supposed&quot; to do it then the<br>
algorithms wouldn&#x27;t be listed as a continuous run-on stream of moves<br>
as they are.  Even while typing this I wondered if maybe it was a<br>
mathematical constraint that at least one of these cases would always<br>
exist as-illustrated on a scrabled cube.  I just scrambled one, and<br>
the answer of course is nah.  All 4 corners ended up in the bottom<br>
layer, I only have one corner in the proper slot and its edge piece is<br>
buried in another slot.  Sure, I could &quot;punt&quot; and just kick one corner<br>
up to the top layer but why not join it at the same time.  Once again<br>
I&#x27;ve led myself back into thinking that these are not algorithms at<br>
all but mere guidelines and you cannot simply use muscle memory.  That<br>
of course I think is wrong based on what I&#x27;ve read here but just don&#x27;t<br>
see how.  Heck, if they&#x27;ve gotta spell out simple mirrors of these<br>
algorithms they certainly don&#x27;t want me to actually *gasp* _think_, do<br>
they? ;)<br>
<br>
Any help at all with this would be greatly appreciated.  I&#x27;m making<br>
good progress either way; it&#x27;s just really bothering me wondering what<br>
I&#x27;m &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing.<br>
<br>
<br>
-- Question 2 --<br>
<br>
Is there any substance _equally_ as good as Rubik&#x27;s Cube Lube?  Cost<br>
isn&#x27;t necessarily a concern.  Yeah, I know, folks say look for 100%<br>
silicone lubricant.  But those same folks say that one must let it dry<br>
for 15-20 mins before it stops being sticky.  So obviously it&#x27;s not<br>
exactly the same stuff.  I haven&#x27;t personally used Prestone; after 15<br>
minutes of drying time is it really AS GOOD as the Rubik&#x27;s stuff is<br>
fresh?  I have an old cube that I&#x27;m lubing every other day... if<br>
15-minute dry Prestone is similar to what 2-day-old Rubik&#x27;s Lube feels<br>
like then I think I&#x27;ll have to keep ordering the real stuff.  <br>
<br>
<br>
-- Question 3 --<br>
<br>
On a lighter note, how come you never see anything at _all_ on the<br>
Philip Marshall method anymore?   I learned it many years ago, put<br>
down the cube for a few years, and still remembered it when I picked<br>
it back up just recently.  (I doubt many casual-type solvers are able<br>
to remember their solution of choice after so many years!)  Only 2<br>
series to remember and and average solve of 65 moves; quite elegant. <br>
His site&#x27;s apparently gone and I had to find a cached copy on<br>
archive.org to do further reading (<br>
http://web.archive.org/web/20060412171633/www.olympus.net/personal/prmhem/<br>
if you&#x27;re never seen it ), so I&#x27;m wondering if he has passed away. <br>
(One of his pages said he was 75 years old, I believe.)  Still<br>
surprising that nobody has done a writeup of it and uploaded it on a<br>
working server.  Anyway no matter how many years I practiced I could<br>
never get below about 3:00.  Then just recently I do some<br>
experimenting with Friedrich and Petrus and almost immediately was<br>
under 2:00.  Good stuff!  Although I&#x27;m quite sure I won&#x27;t be able to<br>
remember all the algorithms if by chance I don&#x27;t happen to pick up a<br>
cube for several years.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jason

The F2L should be more intuitive than you think. The algorithms just
provide more optimal ways of pairing the pieces--&quot;guidelines&quot;--but you
should really understand how the algorithms work. Yes, you need to
think a bit! -_-

Once you understand how the algorithms work, you&#x27;ll find somewhat
intuitive ways that you eventually put into muscle memory for
situations where things are not set up as pictured. There is almost
always some sort of setup involved in F2L.

For your two other questions... sorry, no comment ^^;

          <div class="email-content"><br>
&gt; -- Question 1 --<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On all these algorithms they always show the corner properly<br>
&gt; positioned or the edge properly positioned as the starting point,<br>
&gt; except of course when both are in the top layer.  But my question is:<br>
&gt;  What if this is not the case?  <br>
<br>
The algorithms you will see are the &quot;standard&quot; positions for F2L, when<br>
the corners is in the top layer, or in the correct position but<br>
twisted, and the edge is in one of 10 possible states (4positions x 2<br>
orientations on the top layer, and 1 position x 2 orientations in the<br>
correct slot) <br>
<br>
What if the corner is in fact in the<br>
&gt; bottom layer but not in its proper slot?  <br>
<br>
There are several ways to go. If the corner is in the bottom layer,<br>
and the edge is in the top layer, you could simply do R U R&#x27; (with the<br>
corner initially held in the DFR position), to bring it into the top<br>
layer, and then use a standard algorithm. You could learn the various<br>
patterns of corner and edge position/orientation to see what move you<br>
could choose which brings up the corner and pairs it up with the edge,<br>
giving you a simple 3 move insert into the correct slot (R U R&#x27; for a<br>
seperated pair, or R U&#x27; R&#x27; for a connected pair)<br>
<br>
For example, do L&#x27; U&#x27; L U R U&#x27; R2 U2 R on a solved cube<br>
The FL corner is in the FR slot. We can&#x27;t use a standard algorithm,<br>
but no matter. When the cross colour is on the right hand side, and<br>
the other colour matches the colour of the edge on the U-face, we<br>
bring the edge round to the front (U2), and they pair up with R!. NOw<br>
you have a connected pair, which you can insert in 3 moves (L&#x27; U L).<br>
Now R&#x27; restores the cross. There are not many new patterns like this<br>
to learn, and most of them you can see on the fly.<br>
<br>
You could also just try to ignore it, and find another pair that is in<br>
a standard position. In the above position, you could have chosen to<br>
do R&#x27; U2 R2 U R&#x27;, solving the FR pair, and now the FL pair is in a<br>
standard position.<br>
<br>
The same is true for the edges, if they are stuck in the midde layer<br>
you could bring it out, learn new patterns, or ignore it. If both<br>
pieces are stuck in the middle layer, I would usually ignore it, but<br>
if forced, I would simply bring the corner piece out and then solve<br>
that position.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; What mystifies me is why none of these sites has gone right out and<br>
&gt; say that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to do, explicitly.  <br>
<br>
That&#x27;s because there are so many possible scenarios it is hard to<br>
present them all in one comprehensive format. F2L requires a lot of<br>
experience and practice to do well, so don&#x27;t expect that just if you<br>
know the standard algorithms that you will be sub 10 seconds F2L. It&#x27;s<br>
a lot about seeing short-cuts, using empty slots, choosing the pair<br>
order smartly, and being able to fuse everything together with no<br>
pauses, at a fast turn rate. This does not happen overnight. The best<br>
way to become proficient at F2L is do a lot of practice by yourself,<br>
understand how the algorithms work (most are simply pair up the<br>
pieces, and insert them), and also practice with a master of the cube<br>
to pick up lots of tips from them. Be patient!<br>
<br>
<br>
One example that I can think of off<br>
&gt; the top of my head, but which is not all that &quot;black&quot;, is (R U R&#x27;<br>
&gt; U&#x27;)x3.  Assuming the two pieces in question are not in the proper slot<br>
&gt; what I&#x27;m forced to do is the first TWO repeats, position U face, then<br>
&gt; do the insert. <br>
<br>
Not bad. Do L U&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; L F L&#x27; U on a solved cube, is this the case you<br>
mean? The procedure is simple, solving into the BL slot (or mirrored<br>
solved into the BR). Move the corner away from the area where the slot<br>
is (U&#x27;), do this little finger trick (L F&#x27; L&#x27; F) click click, and<br>
suddenly the pieces are set up for a 3 move insert, (L U L&#x27;). This<br>
works when the pieces are situated over a slot that is adjacent to the<br>
slot you want to solve to. For the opposite slot, you can discover a<br>
nice algorithm, there is a nice one involving a double top-layer turn<br>
(u) :)<br>
<br>
 That one&#x27;s easy though... the black box algorithms<br>
&gt; which really do disturb the cross across multiple moves I wouldn&#x27;t<br>
&gt; want to even begin to try such an approach with.  <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; All this leads me to believe I&#x27;m making more work for myself than I<br>
&gt; should be.<br>
<br>
A few years ago I thought it would be a good idea to come up with<br>
standard algorithms for each of the 4 slots, thats 164 in all! Luckily<br>
I realised before I had tried to memorise all those that you don&#x27;t<br>
need to do that, knowledge of the standard algorithms + tricks +<br>
experience is all you need. And once you&#x27;ve got the hang of that, it&#x27;s<br>
not hard work at all. But it may be hard work getting there, but you<br>
would expect that if your aim is to solve in under 20s!<br>
<br>
 Once again<br>
&gt; I&#x27;ve led myself back into thinking that these are not algorithms at<br>
&gt; all but mere guidelines and you cannot simply use muscle memory. <br>
<br>
You surely can use muscle memory :) It&#x27;s very useful for doing mirrors<br>
of algorithms, if you only know the letters and have to translate<br>
those into the mirrored version of an algorithm, it is very slow. BUt<br>
if you use muscle memory, you intuititively have a very good idea of<br>
what movements your hands should do to mirror the algorithms. Hone<br>
that skill, and mirroring algorithms becomes a doddle.<br>
<br>
Good Luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">The problem with the &quot;1 small drop&quot; is the darn syrenges seem to stick
fairly often and suddenly you have a steady stream dripping out your
cube.  Or perhaps I&#x27;ve just been unlucky with them.

What kind of floorwax is it?  And if I may ask... are you buying
syrenges of the stuff from Rubik&#x27;s (or otherwise)?  No doubt a whole
_large_ bottle of it from the floorwax manufacturer would cost the
same, if you definitely knew it was chemically exactly the same. 

In my last Cube Lube order the instructions sheet did give some clues
in the accidental ingestion precautions:
&quot;800-228-5635 (Shine-up-SC Johnson &amp; Sons, Inc)&quot;.  I take it that
&quot;Shine-Up&quot; is the product in question.  I&#x27;m going to be ordering that
pronto.  If it turns out that it does not act exactly the same,
meaning the proportions or something else has been adjusted, one only
needs to call the 800 number posing as a physician to squeeze the info
outta them.  (Tell them that a 2 year old girl has swallowed some and
they&#x27;ll tell you whatever you want to know, trust me.)

          <div class="email-content">Dan Harris!  Thanks for the response.  In fact it was your site that I<br>
was primarily using for the algorithms.  I also used Jason Thong&#x27;s<br>
site for the detailed descriptions but always have yours open as well<br>
for the setup sequence -- really appreciate that part of the site.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; For example, do L&#x27; U&#x27; L U R U&#x27; R2 U2 R on a solved cube<br>
&gt; The FL corner is in the FR slot. We can&#x27;t use a standard algorithm,<br>
&gt; but no matter. When the cross colour is on the right hand side, and<br>
&gt; the other colour matches the colour of the edge on the U-face, we<br>
&gt; bring the edge round to the front (U2), and they pair up with R!.<br>
<br>
Ah!  Leaving the cross broken up here for an extra instant definitely<br>
has an advantage.  Great tip!  What I currently do in this situation<br>
is the join, restore cross, then insert.  Certainly a couple extra<br>
moves but at my level (and tps) it makes no difference.  This right<br>
there answers my original question -- yes you join things when you<br>
can.  You just took it an optimized step further for me.<br>
<br>
&gt; Do L U&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; L F L&#x27; U on a solved cube, is this the case <br>
&gt; you mean? The procedure is simple, solving into the BL slot<br>
&gt; (or mirrored solved into the BR). Move the corner away from the<br>
&gt; area where the slot is (U&#x27;), do this little finger trick (L F&#x27; L&#x27; F)<br>
&gt; click click, and suddenly the pieces are set up for a 3 move insert,<br>
&gt; (L U L&#x27;). This works when the pieces are situated over a slot that <br>
&gt; is adjacent to the slot you want to solve to.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s the case I meant, alright.  And yet another optimized move I&#x27;ll<br>
add to my arsenal in time.  <br>
<br>
Thanks again for all your help.  You know, it&#x27;s a funny thing --<br>
listening to your descriptions of these moves it&#x27;s apparent that you<br>
have [once did, or still do] have mnemonics or at least English<br>
descriptions for some of these situations. (e.g. &quot;move the corner away<br>
from the area where the slot is&quot;, etc.)  I did spend several days<br>
studying your site and scribbling notes to come up with similar mental<br>
explanations before I even started drilling on them.  It would be<br>
great to see such descriptions on the site as well!  Although yes one<br>
learns much more from forming them oneself.<br>

Ok, are you referring to:

1) that I do inspection with two hands, or
2) that I maybe stop the cube not only with fingers?

For #1 I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal because I personally don&#x27;t
benefit anything from doing it. I just forget about that rule
sometimes. About #2: I tryto stop with fingers always, but this can&#x27;t
be a very big deal neither for an unofficial solve. I even hard a few
days ago that this rule is taken away.

In the article they mentioned &quot;F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;. That&#x27;s Front clockwise,

I just wish they could get the notation correct. &quot;Up&quot; instead of
&quot;under,&quot; though I can perhaps see where they could have mistaken it.
Some of my friends get &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Bottom&quot; mixed up.

This article just goes to show the growing popularity of the cube.
It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m thinking about solving a few cube for my school&#x27;s

So we will be doing the preliminary round to 3x3x3 speed solve and
one-handed speed solve.  In order to qualify for the second round in speed
solve, you need to record an average of five under 28 seconds.  For
one-handed speed solve, you need an average of 50 seconds.

Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Well spelling it out like that is great, but what I was just getting 
at was that &quot;double move&quot; does not have a clear meaning or you seemed 
to be trying to use *their words*, which might not help. All I was 
saying was that &quot;double move&quot; is not &quot;well-defined&quot;... at least not to 
me.

I guess I was being nit-picky as usual (no more than certain ppl here 
though). But I would appreciate it if people where to correct me on 
stuff. Well except when things are being taken to a silly literal 
level like I&#x27;ve been seeing lately. I take cube-terminology very 
seriously though.

On the other note, I like to add a bit of math just to enlighten 
people every now and then. It wasn&#x27;t even targeted to the orginal 
poster, just thought someone here might enjoy reading it. Plus, I like 
to show that I&#x27;m a mathy guy, and perhaps seek out other like-minded 
individuals that didn&#x27;t know that about me.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been getting really into square-1 for the past couple days. And <br>
I&#x27;m starting to see some dramatic differences in the consistancy of <br>
my times. Sometiems this is simply due to the lack of parity. But I <br>
was curious what counts as non-lucky for sq-1.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m pretty new at it, but I&#x27;ve already encountered some really <br>
bizzare cases.<br>
<br>
So if step 1 of my method is to get it into cube-shape and the <br>
scramble given starts it off at cube-shape, is that automatically <br>
counted as lucky?<br>
<br>
Also sometimes things pair up very quickly and I can just solve like <br>
the corners of a 2x2x3. I got an 0:11.xx time today and thought that <br>
that must be lucky because even the #1 single attempt on the URW <br>
listing is below this.<br>
<br>
Although I have what I consdier a non-lucky PB of 0:36.04 and a PB <br>
average of 1:23.xx, I still get times over 5 minutes every now and <br>
then, I must be dong something wrong. I sometimes mess up an alg and <br>
it goes really bad.<br>
<br>
Another big question I had, which I am sure is in the WCA rules, but <br>
I&#x27;d rather have an unbiased discussion here (plus I&#x27;m too lazy to <br>
read it at the mmoment) - What counts as solved and is there a 2s <br>
penalty, and what would constitue a 2s penalty?<br>
<br>
Today I had a solve where my last step was skipped and it caught me <br>
by suprise. I immediately stopped the timer, but then saw that the <br>
middle layer was in &quot;kite-shape&quot; (both layers matched up with the <br>
left half of the middle layer though).... should this be a DNF or 2s <br>
penalty? (although... it takes me more than 2s to fix something like <br>
that in a solve)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, due to my motivation to do sq-1 these days, I check to see <br>
if there was another US competition around the corner. As it turns <br>
out, just the one in San Fran. is posted on speedcubing. I think we <br>
need someone to host one on the east coast (or midwest) sometime in <br>
the next few months. I&#x27;m itchin&#x27; for some action!<br>
<br>
So ya, I&#x27;m curious if there are any plans for such a tourn., if any <br>
of you know.<br>
<br>
A really bizzre thing that happend to me just now. I was looking at <br>
US2006 results for the category and was curious how I would rank <br>
among those (single attempt) times. I took a hard look at Craig&#x27;s <br>
time as I was scrambling. The next thing I know, the time ended up <br>
getting on that very solve was *exactly* 1:15.47, which was Craig&#x27;s <br>
best time at that comp. So..., it looks like you&#x27;ll be gettin&#x27; some <br>
competition, man. :0<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have been really annoyed by this for a long time. I was curious if <br>
it was just me and how frequently it occurs for you guys.<br>
<br>
Sometimes when I slam my timer very hard, it casues the time to <br>
vanish and for it to go into this strange loop. I find this annoying <br>
because I am more like to slam on a spectacular solve time. It <br>
wasn&#x27;t too big of a problem for me, but I think there is a simple <br>
solution.<br>
<br>
I wonder how the rubiks.com timer fairs with slamming (although you <br>
almost never slam with it since it&#x27;s based on photo-resistors)...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m hoping that they fix this problem (as well as allow computer <br>
interface, wjhich we have all been yearning for the longest time). <br>
I&#x27;d think that the designers would have thoughly tested for stuff <br>
like this and placed in proper safe-guards.<br>
<br>
I suspect it has to do with the battery being temporarily knocked <br>
out of place (it&#x27;s the only non-moving part really). Thus they could <br>
simply place a &quot;very beefy cap&quot; in parallel with the battery cell <br>
and that should fix things. Capacitors are wonderful things... (as <br>
are inductors). Plus for Gen3, they could increase the number of <br>
batteries needed. Or even better, an optional additonal battery. <br>
Another thing, would be to go to something more acessible to <br>
consumers like AAA size. What do you guys think? Is the extra weight <br>
worth it?<br>
<br>
As for the form-factor, it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m even used to the placement <br>
of the rest button now. A &quot;hold switch&quot; or &quot;guard&quot; could still be <br>
useful for the people not used to the timer though. Hem... OR! place <br>
the buttons in a more hard-to-accidently-hit location such as an <br>
area on the side (perpendicular to the slamming action, and <br>
inconspicuous).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Doug mate, you&#x27;re getting yourself into a real minefield here.

We have had huge debates about this in the past on the FMC group, and
on the speedcubing group too.

I described HTM as the standard metric, because that is the official
metric used in official WCA FMC competitions.

And even after describing all those metrics, you forgot to mention
SQTM (Slice-Quarter Turn Metric) :)

All the best,
DanH

Is this after you lube a Studio Cube, or do all/most Studio Cubes come

purchased a Studio Cube and it is extremely tight! (Unfortunately I
ran out of lube and will have to wait a week or two before it arrives

Why do people have this fascination for number of turns when 
performance is measured in time units??
Low turn count is just a rough indication of possible speed. Good 
flow, lookahead and minimising pauses is the main key to speed. As 
well as being calm and collected, focused ... :-D

A 60 move solution may be quicker than a 40 move one, because each 
step is easier/faster ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

I think move count is more important in the cross than for any other
stage, because the are no &quot;algorithms&quot; as such. A solution to the
cross is likely to involve some awkward moves, maybe turning 4-6 faces
of the cube, so it is important to minimise turn count to always get
your cross under 2 seconds.

But you&#x27;re right about the rest of the cube, I would like to see
someone execute an average FMC solution faster than someone using a
speedcubing method because without lots of practice on the FMC persons
part, the speedcuber would win :)

Dan :)

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Another big question I had, which I am sure is in the WCA rules, but <br>
&gt; I&#x27;d rather have an unbiased discussion here (plus I&#x27;m too lazy to <br>
&gt; read it at the mmoment) - What counts as solved and is there a 2s <br>
&gt; penalty, and what would constitue a 2s penalty?<br>
<br>
In my opinion the rule should be (but I don&#x27;t know what WCA say about<br>
sq-1): If one layer (Up or Down Layer) need 45 or more degrees<br>
rotation to fix it than it is a 2s penalty. (If the two layers need 45<br>
or more than it is a DNF, although the cube is just one middle layer<br>
move away from solution. But one slice move on 3x3 away is (I think)<br>
also DNF.)<br>
<br>
&gt; So if step 1 of my method is to get it into cube-shape and the <br>
&gt; scramble given starts it off at cube-shape, is that automatically <br>
&gt; counted as lucky?<br>
<br>
In my opinion it is lucky, because you skip the whole first step. (Not<br>
only skipping the first step, you also have the possibility to look<br>
ahead for your second step during inspection.)<br>
<br>
&gt; Today I had a solve where my last step was skipped and it caught me <br>
&gt; by suprise. I immediately stopped the timer, but then saw that the <br>
&gt; middle layer was in &quot;kite-shape&quot; (both layers matched up with the <br>
&gt; left half of the middle layer though).... should this be a DNF or 2s <br>
&gt; penalty? (although... it takes me more than 2s to fix something like <br>
&gt; that in a solve)<br>
<br>
How can you wondering if this is a 2s penalty??? If the middle layer<br>
is in kite-shape the cube is not even &quot;almost solved&quot; (defined as on<br>
move away from solution), because it takes 3 twists and at least 2<br>
&#x27;180 degrees moves&#x27; to fix it (so total at least 3+2=5 moves). So of<br>
course in this case it is a DNF.<br>

A couple more questions for the Jan 13 competition (that might be of 
general interest)

- I just wanted to confirm that there will not be a 2x2x2 contest.

- How will 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 contests be run? My suggestion would be 
to use the European style format: Everybody does 1 run, top 12 or 16 
do a second run, top 6 or 8 finish out an average of 5.

Mainly, just make sure everyone knows the format beforehand (and 
doesn&#x27;t find out in the middle of a solve :-)

I won&#x27;t be making it into the second round on 3x or 3x-onehand, but 
I&#x27;ll just shoot for as good an average as I can get (and thanks for 
having first round be an average).

See everyone next week!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jeff,

We are not planning a 2x2x2 competition at this time.

Here is the following format for the events:

3x3x3 Speed Solve, 28 seconds will advance into the second round, and a 
certain number will advance to the final round.  This number will be 
either 8 or 12.  I&#x27;m trying to gauge the competitiveness of the 
competition.  I think we could have 12 cubers all under 17 seconds for 
an average.  The level of competition in California is quite high.

3x3x3 One-Handed solve, 50 seconds will advance into the final round.

3x3x3 Blindfold Solve, essentially, you get about 12 minutes of stage 
time.  You may do three attempts if each attempt is under 4 minutes 30 
seconds.  You may do two attempts if each attempt is under 6 minutes 
and 30 seconds.  Otherwise, you will get one attempt.

4x4x4 Speed Solve, everyone gets two attempts.  If both attempts are 
under 3 minutes, you finish the average of 5.

5x5x5 Speed Solve, everyone gets two attempts.  If both attempts are 
under 4 minutes 30 seconds, you finish the average of 5.

  Ah great! Thank you. I want the whole thing.

  http://www.yousendit.com/ was shown to me by Hunt, and I think it&#x27;s a 
  great way of sending files if you have no better means. If it&#x27;s small 
  you can just e-mail it to me. (doug cube [one word] at gmail, will do)

  I can host it somewhere if other&#x27;s want it. I do have some web space 
  still.

  I&#x27;m betting it&#x27;s in the dreaded FLV format. I have a player for it, 
  but can convert it for you guys too.

cross on top but then keep the cube like this.

But anyway the algorithm doesn&#x27;t work to orient edges. You have to use
something like F L D L&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; to do it.

Nope. That has been explicitly allowed since Jul 2006.

I know it was an unofficial solve so it doesn&#x27;t really matter much. 
Just want to remind people so they don&#x27;t forget it in competition. 
Would be sad if you used two hands in competition just because you&#x27;re 
used to it from practice. I personally prefer to practice competition-
style, up to the point that for Germany 2006 I covered the cube after 
inspection, talked with an imaginary judge, and didn&#x27;t sit but stand.

  How much would you pay to see a sub-12 average in a competition? If 25 
  people put in $50, we could fly him to the United States. I&#x27;m

Just one question.  What makes you think he wants to fly to the states to compete in a 
competition? (I&#x27;ll leave it at one question for now...)

2345.htm (sorry for the strange url, but I don&#x27;t have hosting anymore)<br>
<br>
There are 4 tabs on the bottom for the 4 different rankings:<br>
Single_Absolute_Rank: Like Dan&#x27;s list<br>
Average_Absolute_Rank: Like Dan&#x27;s list but based on averages<br>
Single_Relative_Result: Competitors best single times compared to <br>
events best single times<br>
Average_Relative_Result: Competitors best average times compared to <br>
events best average times<br>
<br>
I think absolute times are simple to understand. I include relative <br>
times to show how everyone compares to the best. For example: <br>
<br>
Person	Frank Morris<br>
2x2x2	1.16<br>
3x3x3	1.34<br>
4x4x4	1.11<br>
5x5x5	1.00<br>
Total	1.15<br>
Ranking	1<br>
<br>
means Frank is 16% slower than the best 2x2x2 solver (Frank Morris: <br>
4.12, Anthony Hsu: 3.55)<br>
34% slower than the best 3x3x3 solver (Frank Morris: 14.07, Toby Mao: <br>
10.48)<br>
11% slower than the best 4x4x4 solver (Frank Morris: 56.85, Michael <br>
Fung: 51.16)<br>
and that he is the best 5x5x5 solver<br>
This results in him being 15% slower overall compared to the best <br>
solvers.<br>
<br>
I hope I made it clear how these rankings work and that people agree <br>
they are all useful. Hopefully Stefan will include all of these lists <br>
on speedcubing.<br>

<br>
a friend of mine was thinking about a possible new category of competition.<br>
Would it be interesting (possible) to blind solve, using cubes for blind people(the ones<br>
that have textures or symbols that you can feel with your fingers)?<br>
Even the inspection would be done blindfolded, maybe in the same 15<br>
seconds of a normal competition, because people can always &quot;feel&quot; the<br>
cube during the solve.<br>
Is there a competition that includes something like this? Would it be a nice idea?<br>
I didn&#x27;t try to do this kind of solve because I don&#x27;t have a cube for<br>
blind people, but I would like to see what happens with solving time.<br>
What do you think?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I agree with Clancy here.

I wouldn&#x27;t treat a blind person solving a blindman&#x27;s cube as a sighted
person trying to solve the blindman&#x27;s cube without looking.  For all of us
who are fortunate to have the use of our eyes, our ability to distinguish
shapeds by feel is not absolutely crucial to our every day needs in the
world.

There will actually be a very interesting opportunity at the exploratorium
on Saturday.  They have what is called the &quot;tactile dome.&quot;  It&#x27;s a maze
inside the dome and essentially, it&#x27;s completely dark.  As a sighted person,
it takes a bit of time to get through, but when blind people go ahead and
try to manuver, they can get out really quickly.

The exploratorium has reserved for me 15 spots at 6:45 PM this Saturday.
Spots are first reserved for the Caltech and Berkeley Rubik&#x27;s Cube club (as
they&#x27;re the ones I booked it for), but if anyone else is interested, please
contact me and I&#x27;ll see what I can do.

I&#x27;d definitely be interested in a dice cube like that, and i think 
red would be the best color.  Yeah, $80 is a lot, but i agree it&#x27;s 
reasonable.
When can i get one?

Hmmm ... in response to Dan&#x27;s joke :-) I just might to bring a couple 
of stackmats, a bunch of scrambles, and run an informal 2x2x2 
competition on the side.

Bring your 2x2x2 cubes folks, and we&#x27;ll see what we can pull off!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I find that this forum, although it is quite nice, is rather useless 
for *tracking* information. There is no categories or sticky topics 
or anything like that. Proper bulletin boards are much better in this 
respect. Though one can always search for topics (key words) in this 
forum, the search is painfully slow and will only search a number of 
posts backwards in time at a time.

If someone wants a nice project, make some software that reads all 
posts in this group and makes a proper fast searchable index.
Hint: all urls for posts are very similar. Just make the software 
visit all the urls (posts) in a big loop, and with some error 
handling for missing posts. Stefan, are u up to this challenge as 
well ?? There&#x27;s many many programmers on this forum ...

Cheers!

Don&#x27;t know exactly. But Yu Jeong-Min said:

&quot;yeah I use Joy cube, well.. I link site http://cubenjoy.com but you 
can&#x27;t buy cube.. this site only Korea&quot;

And he said it feels and sounds different from DIY cubes (don&#x27;t know 
which ones were meant).

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody,<br>
<br>
I just came back from visiting Matt Walter in Canada. I will upload <br>
some pics and movies to my site, in the near future. I had a great <br>
time overthere. It was really cool to see where he lives, and to <br>
meet his family. When I was there, we found some cool new algs. Matt <br>
found a very interesting F2L alg (not shortcut, but an alg), and I <br>
was able to make an OLL alg, based on that alg:<br>
<br>
R&#x27; U&#x27; (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) U R<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s very nice, especially if you do both U&#x27; with the left index. <br>
It&#x27;s just 1 move more than the alg most ppl use. Then, in the <br>
airplane from Toronto to Chicago, I found that a modification of <br>
this alg leads to:<br>
<br>
R&#x27; U&#x27; (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) U R<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s kinda long 19 moves, but it can be done fast, and might be <br>
usefull for BLD cubers.<br>
<br>
Well.. that&#x27;s it.. cyou guys later!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m very new to the Rubik&#x27;s world.  I learned how to solve a 3x3x3 <br>
cube well with my eyes open and then I decided that I wanted to see <br>
if I could solve it blindfolded.  I went to cubefreak.net to read up <br>
on tips/methods for solving the 3x3x3 cube blindfolded.  I understand <br>
and can do the orientation but I don&#x27;t understand the cycle method <br>
for premutation.  Here is a quote from the site.<br>
<br>
Cycle Decomposition Algorithm <br>
1. Locate the smallest number that has not been written (the first <br>
time this number is 1).<br>
     a. If such number exists, write down &quot;(&quot; and then that number.<br>
     b. If all numbers have been written, stop.<br>
2. Find the last number that was written. Determine to which spot <br>
this corner needs to be moved.<br>
     a. If the number of this spot has not been written, write it <br>
down and repeat step 2.<br>
     b. If the number of this spot has been written, write &quot;)&quot; to end <br>
the cycle. Go to step 1.<br>
<br>
Could anyone explain that in different words?  I Especially don&#x27;t <br>
understand the part (1a) about if such number exists.  What makes the <br>
number exist?  Anyway, any help on rewording this so maybe some day I <br>
can solve a Rubik&#x27;s cube blindfolded would be appriciated.<br>

However, the second algorithm is much faster and one turn shorter than the current algorithm I use to solve that position:<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] New OLL alg?<br>
<br>
<br>
  Hey everybody,<br>
<br>
  I just came back from visiting Matt Walter in Canada. I will upload <br>
  some pics and movies to my site, in the near future. I had a great <br>
  time overthere. It was really cool to see where he lives, and to <br>
  meet his family. When I was there, we found some cool new algs. Matt <br>
  found a very interesting F2L alg (not shortcut, but an alg), and I <br>
  was able to make an OLL alg, based on that alg:<br>
<br>
  R&#x27; U&#x27; (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) U R<br>
<br>
  It&#x27;s very nice, especially if you do both U&#x27; with the left index. <br>
  It&#x27;s just 1 move more than the alg most ppl use. Then, in the <br>
  airplane from Toronto to Chicago, I found that a modification of <br>
  this alg leads to:<br>
<br>
  R&#x27; U&#x27; (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) U R<br>
<br>
  It&#x27;s kinda long 19 moves, but it can be done fast, and might be <br>
  usefull for BLD cubers.<br>
<br>
  Well.. that&#x27;s it.. cyou guys later!<br>

towards math-minded individuals, although I think that even the math <br>
community is shifting away from such atrocious wordings these days...<br>
<br>
So first I&#x27;m going to apply this to EDGES. You have some sort <br>
of &quot;canonical&quot; numbering (or more precisely, ordering) that you should <br>
pre-determine for yourself. You can go with Macky&#x27;s numbering although <br>
I have a hunch that not even he would recommend it for everybody.<br>
<br>
Bascially you assign the numbers 1 though 12 to the edge pieces.<br>
<br>
For myself I chose the ordering 1|-&gt;UF, 2|-&gt;uL, 3|-&gt;UB, 4|-&gt;UR, 5|-<br>
&gt;DB, ...blah blah..., 12|-&gt;FR, and it really doesn&#x27;t matter as long as <br>
you are very familiar with it.<br>
<br>
So his instructions assume that you have this list of numbers 1,...,12 <br>
on a piece of paper and are in a process of crossing them off (but of <br>
course this is really an abstract process to be done mentally).<br>
<br>
1a) is to locate the smallest number on this &quot;list&quot; that has not yet <br>
been crossed off. The first time though the instructions none of the <br>
12 numbers will be crossed off, and thus the number you pick will be 1.<br>
<br>
You write down (or do so mentally): &quot;(1 &quot; for step 1a).<br>
<br>
1b) says that if all the numbers have been crossed off the &quot;list&quot; than <br>
stop. It is essentially a &quot;terminating condition/case&quot; in a <br>
recursively-defined algorithm. (It&#x27;s so obvious to math ppl... but <br>
useless for non-math ppl to state things this way, since you won&#x27;t <br>
automatically see it for what it really is: a recursive procedure <br>
similar to that studied in computer science.)<br>
<br>
The reason 1b) is written there is so that the task does not go on <br>
indefinately... (the last step is to go back to step 1)<br>
<br>
I think you should try to figure out the rest of it yourself. Another <br>
thing to notice is that you don&#x27;t have to assign the numbers 1,...,12 <br>
to the edges. It could very well be A,...,L or you could &quot;name&quot; a <br>
particular edge &quot;Platapus&quot; and another one &quot;Elaphant&quot; or something. <br>
Whatever makes sence to you. I apply chinese numbers for the edges and <br>
english numbers for the corners.... It&#x27;s all up to you.<br>
<br>
I posted a BLD program in the files secion a long time ago that you <br>
might find helpful. Better yet, I&#x27;m going to write up an example using <br>
my program&#x27;s output if I can find it. This post, however, is getting <br>
too long.<br>

&gt; Could anyone explain that in different words?  I Especially don&#x27;t <br>
&gt; understand the part (1a) about if such number exists.  What makes <br>
the <br>
&gt; number exist?  Anyway, any help on rewording this so maybe some day <br>
I <br>
&gt; can solve a Rubik&#x27;s cube blindfolded would be appriciated.<br>

Why not just use ACube&#x27;s ordering? Both for edges and corners. That 
way the ordering is sorta standardised. Theoretically there&#x27;s no 
special benefit to any particular ordering, since a scramble permutes 
the cubies (hopefully) randomly.

Just my idea anyway ...

Actually, on the subject of cube clubs, I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a cube club
started here at the University of Texas at Austin. There&#x27;s a bunch of people
who know how to cube, and I&#x27;ve been wanting to somehow organize all of them.
I&#x27;m curious as to what you guys do during meetings and how the club is run.
I attempted starting one in high school, but our principal shut it down
(apparently solving Rubik&#x27;s cubes aren&#x27;t &quot;academic&quot;). But even then, I
wasn&#x27;t really sure how to set up the meetings. Any ideas would be greatly
appreciated.

Does that mean fewest moves solving? Current OWR is 28 turns shared by 
Zbigniew Zborowski and Mirek Goljan. Or is he talking about a more turn-
efficient speedsolving method ???

&quot;The record-setter said his next goal in the world of Rubik&#x27;s Cube
is to break the record of solving the puzzle with the shortest path. &quot;

Mhh... Interesting...

If that&#x27;s true then we have a problem. No, actually *they* have a 
problem. I&#x27;m certain these cubes are not allowed in WCA competitions.

          <div class="email-content">Cho just told me that they were actually not allowed in official competition
since you can see the B sticker of the UB face if you focus a little.

So in competition they just use the same brand but with non translucid
cubes.

Sorry for the confusion.

The last statement they made on twistypuzzles.com was that &quot;the
machines [6x6x6 and 7x7x7] will be in your hands lifetime...&quot;

Now that&#x27;s a conservative estimate.

Um, first off someone tell me if I&#x27;m using this forum incorrectly 
(like replying in the wrongarea or something) and um.... yeah, tell 
me.  So I guess I really got worked up over nothing.  In fact I awoke 
the very next day to a great suprise: the box tha twas sitting under 
the christmas tree had peen painted like a 3x3, and I was then 
allowed to open it only to find EVERY last cube I had ever lost. 
Ever.  So I thought that was pretty cool.  And most of them somehow 
wound up in my brother&#x27;s room: he still won&#x27;t let me teach him how to 
solve one, and he&#x27;s determined to do it on his own (I suppose I 
really respect his wishes).  My collection is now up to a whopping 
(for me at least)83 cubes, even if four of them are broken.  Not as 
spectacular as it might seem however: 25 five of them are just simple 
generic cubes that I bought at a craft store for one dollar each. 1
$!!!!!!  You just can&#x27;t pass them up at that price!  And as for the 
method I use, it is a creation of my own.  I titled it The Stupid 
Method once I learned about other methods online... I&#x27;m so stupid 
sometimes.  However I am forgoing(sp?) that method in favor of the 
faster, and and much more logical, Lars Petrus method: kudos to you.  
If I wasn&#x27;t so sure you sold your soul to the devil to come up with 
that, I&#x27;d say you were God.  I hope I didn&#x27;t offend anyone, but if I 
did I guess you&#x27;ll just have to suck it up.  Alas my 15 minutes on 
this computer grows short, and I must bid you all a fond farewell.  
LOL.

          <div class="email-content">By the way, in order to be allowed to do all 5 one-hand solves, your 
first two attempts must both be under 90 seconds.  This restriction 
will be lifted if we have the time.

&quot;The record-setter said his next goal in the world of Rubik&#x27;s Cube

is to break the record of solving the puzzle with the shortest path. &quot;



Mhh... Interesting. ..

          <div class="email-content">I think the reason why Yu Jeong-Min is so much better than the rest of 
us is indirectly related to the fact that he&#x27;s a high school drop out.  
I think that he simply has been dedicating time and has found a passion 
for the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  Most of us here also have a passion for the 
Rubik&#x27;s Cube, but we all have other responsibilities in life, whether 
it&#x27;s school, a job, or family.

Imagine what would be possible, if we were paid to practice speed 
cubing?  If for some reason Rubik&#x27;s Cube could become a profession like 
chess?  Then I&#x27;d imagine we&#x27;d see more people at Yu Jeong-Min&#x27;s level 
very soon.  But for now, I&#x27;m sure if you were to put in as much time 
and dedication into Rubik&#x27;s Cube as Yu Jeong-Min, we&#x27;ll see some sub-12 
second averages from you quite soon.

          <div class="email-content">The advice I give to people who ask how to get real fast is to have  <br>
no job, no school, no friends, and not watch TV.  I credit my jobless  <br>
summer of 1981 when I cubed for 10 hours a day for 3 months with  <br>
getting me up to speed in a real way.<br>
<br>
If this became a professional sport where you could make millions,  <br>
you would see people being selected from a much bigger talent pool,  <br>
practicing full time for years, starting at age 5-8, with coaches and  <br>
nutritional aid as well as illegal drugs, and the records we consider  <br>
extremely impressive today would be blown away many times over.<br>

I bought a generic one in june 2003, and it was my best(*) cube for 3<br>
years before becoming definitely loose.<br>
I bought another one 2 weeks ago that looks just perfect(*).<br>
Meanwhile, I tried to build good cubes from DIY kits, but I couldn&#x27;t<br>
find the right balance.<br>
<br>
But you&#x27;re right, all of the generic cubes can&#x27;t be perfect, some may<br>
even be good for nothing. Open the box, and check it.<br>

Studio cubes or any other brand have never been better in the last<br>

          <div class="email-content">Maybe you are being optimistic. You&#x27;d still need a rechargable 
battery inside, presumably Li-ion or even Li-polymer to meet the 
charge density requirements... The amount it can charge from the 
energy generated by your turning action is going to be proportional 
to how much drag/friction you want on it. I suspect that for this to 
work the cube isn&#x27;t going feel rather &quot;tight&quot; unfortunately.

If someone is willing to pay me $2800 for R&amp;D, I can design 
something like that... I spent the last semester learning a lot 
about PCB design :), battery recharge circitry, and writting USB 
drivers.

          <div class="email-content">More like:
RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;(U2)
actually, but I don&#x27;t think it refers to that specifically. It can be 
mirrored in any way or done in a different gripping as well. The last 
U2 there is optional for positioning the corners to where they 
orignally where. Some cubers use it to refer to the inverse as well, 
but I tend to to call it&#x27;s inverse the &quot;anti-sune&quot;.

Although usually refering to the specific algorithm, in more loose 
terminology it may be used to refer to a category of cases similar to 
what it solves for. I have been trying to coin the term &quot;sune-ish&quot; for 
a long time.

It&#x27;s an extremely useful algorithm for twisting corners, especially  
when you don&#x27;t care about edge permutation. FOr beginners, it is quite 
powerful when composed with itself. It is established that it can be 
performed in under 0.7s. I can do its inverse in about 0.65s, takes a 
lot of practice though.

          <div class="email-content">I just found something about him :
In his 3x3 OH unofficial record average of 30.88, he says &quot;I Need New LL
algos.&quot;.

So according to this he changed some of his algorithms. But apparently he
found some pretty good ones. :D

          <div class="email-content">I always tend to cringe at the kind of logic that states that one&#x27;s
ability derives from the fact that they do nothing else in their life.
 All we know is that he dropped out of high school, but this can only
provide so much evidence.  We don&#x27;t know how much time he *actually*
spends practicing or doing other hobbies.  Others can generate their
own algorithms and still be fast without the help of standard-use
internet algorithms.  It&#x27;s really all about how strong your motivation
is and how focused and dedicated you are to improving your muscle
memory in an active manner.

By saying &quot;it&#x27;s only because he isn&#x27;t in school,&quot; it&#x27;s indirectly
discrediting his speed and making it sound like he didn&#x27;t accomplish
anything special.  It&#x27;s always possible that he is just good at the
Cube and would still be good even if he were enrolled in school. 
Sure, you have more time when not in school, but the article said he
does a fair share of his cubing at night anyway (correct me if I am
wrong).  I bring this up because I personally hate it when people
discredit my own abilities as something anyone could do given that
they do nothing else in life.  &quot;Oh you got what score on this? Yeah
well you probably spent your life studying&quot; or &quot;Yeah I could kick your
ass at this sport too if I had no life.&quot; Just because someone hasn&#x27;t
experienced a certain degree of improvement in a certain time
threshold doesn&#x27;t make accomplishments any less impressive.  &quot;Oh I
could get a 4.0 GPA too if I really wanted to.&quot; Whatever -- there&#x27;s no
point in being bitter just because you haven&#x27;t experienced something
before, especially if it is something that you can actually strive to
achieve.

If you want to achieve something you have to put in the effort and
brains, simple as that.  I&#x27;ll probably get flamed for this, but I saw
a lot of whining in response to that article.  Sometimes people are
naturally gifted at certain things.  I&#x27;d be more interested in looking
into his approaches.  Do you really think time is the sole factor of
improvement? Not so much.  Does practicing the execution of a Sune
50,000 times make you inherently faster than someone who executes a
Sune 5,000 times? Probably little correlation by that variable alone.
 The people who are fast are the ones that actively try to gain speed
as they cube, and use their mind and muscle to put it all together. 
Effort and repetition yields results with far less iterations compared
to a much greater number of iterations where the effort involved is
far smaller in magnitude.  If anyone disagrees with this notion,
please tell me your thoughts.

I just tend to view the &quot;he&#x27;s good because he does nothing else&quot; logic
as bitter/whiny/jealous.  You can be that fast too if you really
wanted to.  10 seconds is by no means the fastest approachable
barrier.  Just because you haven&#x27;t seen it done before doesn&#x27;t make it
any less possible, but you can surely extrapolate what you know you
can do and to what extent improvements can be made.  And, given
improvements in techniques and active focus in practice, the goal
becomes ever so closer.

I&#x27;ve been planning on going since pretty much last worlds...its just a matter of convincing my 
parents.  I&#x27;m not too worried about the cash...That can always be worked around, its the time 
off school...First Year University isn&#x27;t good to miss, right around midterms...

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not really sure about this but the name of your silicone sounds like it was made for auto parts. If it was, it might contain acetone.  My friend used something like that and it worked beautifully on most cubes.  The thing is, the plastic of the cube tends to stick together at first as if they were slightly melted.  Not to worry, they&#x27;re fine.  Once we pulled them apart, it worked amazingly and lasted for quite awhile.  I choose to use a more basic form of silicone.  I disassemble the cube and spray the pieces with a nice coat.  I then let it dry completely and put it back together and I tend to get nice results.  This could take a few hours to a few days.  Anyway, check your silicone to see what kind of chemicals are in it because the name keeps telling me it&#x27;s for auto parts.

Good Luck,

Rory

          <div class="email-content">This is a difficult thing to do...some swimming glasses can be bad, as they compress your head/eyes, and that can take your concentration away...
   
  about what Dan suggested, i think is not that good...I mean, you have to memorise, stop the timer, then you put your hands/arms and the cube inside that &quot;thing&quot;...but...how will you start the timer on this part?
  and making all that movements can make you forget some of your memo...
   
  we could do as Tyson said, look for another sports that use blindfolds and see what they do...if it&#x27;s good enough, we can use it

If I have my eyes open I can see signals of my assistent in the 
audience.

I disagree. I envision something like this:
http://www.leitermann-shop.de/WGROUP/1015786.htm

I.e. something that&#x27;s leakproof like swimming goggles and very easy 
to close for the solving part.

Any time above zero seconds can be used for rehearsal and thus should 
count.

 Hey it looks like the glass picture is only for a regular pic

I don&#x27;t think those would be perfect.  Why not just use the standard blindfold such as the ones that Leyan, Tyson, Stefan, etc. use?  That appears to go far enough down your nose were you can&#x27;t see underneath, and it is lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t put stress on your head (could be adjustable if it did).

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the tip Rory,
and I re checked my silicone and it is for car parts and household
parts as well (i.e door hinges). The label doesn&#x27;t say there&#x27;s acetone
 in it, but it does say theres petroleum distillates, heptane,
isobutane and propane. I never heard of any of these chemicals except
for propane so I&#x27;m not sure of their reactions to plastic.

 My friend used something like that and it worked beautifully on most
cubes.  The thing is, the plastic of the cube tends to stick together
at first as if they were slightly melted.  Not to worry, they&#x27;re fine.
 Once we pulled them apart, it worked amazingly and lasted for quite
awhile.  I choose to use a more basic form of silicone.  I disassemble
the cube and spray the pieces with a nice coat.  I then let it dry
completely and put it back together and I tend to get nice results. 
This could take a few hours to a few days.  Anyway, check your
silicone to see what kind of chemicals are in it because the name
keeps telling me it&#x27;s for auto parts.

  I always tend to cringe at the kind of logic that states that one&#x27;s
  ability derives from the fact that they do nothing else in their life.
  All we know is that he dropped out of high school, but this can only
  provide so much evidence. We don&#x27;t know how much time he *actually*
  spends practicing or doing other hobbies. Others can generate their
  own algorithms and still be fast without the help of standard-use
  internet algorithms. It&#x27;s really all about how strong your motivation
  is and how focused and dedicated you are to improving your muscle
  memory in an active manner.

  By saying &quot;it&#x27;s only because he isn&#x27;t in school,&quot; it&#x27;s indirectly
  discrediting his speed and making it sound like he didn&#x27;t accomplish
  anything special. It&#x27;s always possible that he is just good at the
  Cube and would still be good even if he were enrolled in school. 
  Sure, you have more time when not in school, but the article said he
  does a fair share of his cubing at night anyway (correct me if I am
  wrong). I bring this up because I personally hate it when people
  discredit my own abilities as something anyone could do given that
  they do nothing else in life. &quot;Oh you got what score on this? Yeah
  well you probably spent your life studying&quot; or &quot;Yeah I could kick your
  ass at this sport too if I had no life.&quot; Just because someone hasn&#x27;t
  experienced a certain degree of improvement in a certain time
  threshold doesn&#x27;t make accomplishments any less impressive. &quot;Oh I
  could get a 4.0 GPA too if I really wanted to.&quot; Whatever -- there&#x27;s no
  point in being bitter just because you haven&#x27;t experienced something
  before, especially if it is something that you can actually strive to
  achieve.

  If you want to achieve something you have to put in the effort and
  brains, simple as that. I&#x27;ll probably get flamed for this, but I saw
  a lot of whining in response to that article. Sometimes people are
  naturally gifted at certain things. I&#x27;d be more interested in looking
  into his approaches. Do you really think time is the sole factor of
  improvement? Not so much. Does practicing the execution of a Sune
  50,000 times make you inherently faster than someone who executes a
  Sune 5,000 times? Probably little correlation by that variable alone.
  The people who are fast are the ones that actively try to gain speed
  as they cube, and use their mind and muscle to put it all together. 
  Effort and repetition yields results with far less iterations compared
  to a much greater number of iterations where the effort involved is
  far smaller in magnitude. If anyone disagrees with this notion,
  please tell me your thoughts.

  I just tend to view the &quot;he&#x27;s good because he does nothing else&quot; logic
  as bitter/whiny/jealous. You can be that fast too if you really
  wanted to. 10 seconds is by no means the fastest approachable
  barrier. Just because you haven&#x27;t seen it done before doesn&#x27;t make it
  any less possible, but you can surely extrapolate what you know you
  can do and to what extent improvements can be made. And, given
  improvements in techniques and active focus in practice, the goal
  becomes ever so closer.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah.  It&#x27;s probably okay to use as it sounds like it did wonders on your cube.  It might not work on all cubes though as your friend&#x27;s proved.  If the lube gives you problems on any other cubes, I would see what other lubes are available.  Otherwise I&#x27;d just be careful.

 and I re checked my silicone and it is for car parts and household
 parts as well (i.e door hinges). The label doesn&#x27;t say there&#x27;s acetone
  in it, but it does say theres petroleum distillates, heptane,
 isobutane and propane. I never heard of any of these chemicals except
 for propane so I&#x27;m not sure of their reactions to plastic.

  My friend used something like that and it worked beautifully on most
 cubes.  The thing is, the plastic of the cube tends to stick together
 at first as if they were slightly melted.  Not to worry, they&#x27;re fine.
  Once we pulled them apart, it worked amazingly and lasted for quite
 awhile.  I choose to use a more basic form of silicone.  I disassemble
 the cube and spray the pieces with a nice coat.  I then let it dry
 completely and put it back together and I tend to get nice results. 
 This could take a few hours to a few days.  Anyway, check your
 silicone to see what kind of chemicals are in it because the name
 keeps telling me it&#x27;s for auto parts.

I&#x27;m also very excited to go to Hungary in October. I&#x27;ve already
started my praparation for the competition, being that I only practice
a few events and will probably ddo so for the whole year. The event
that I try to get better in is 3x3, 3x3OH, 2x2 and 4x4.

By the way, are you still working on the ZBLL Chris? Anyone else?

<br>
No I don&#x27;t practice ZBLL anymore.  I do still remember some of them,<br>
as well as some of the ZBF2L.  During a speed solve I will use a ZBLL<br>
if I recognize it quickly (and if I even know that case), and<br>
sometimes I use ZBF2L instead of just regular F2L say if all LL edges<br>
are flipped wrong and I can quickly do ZBF2L to flip all 4 correctly -<br>
plus I have to know that case, and I don&#x27;t remember all of them.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t really practice the method anymore though.  Pretty much all I<br>
do now is 3x3x3 speed to maintain, and BLD for all cubes.<br>

Wrong. Can&#x27;t speak for Leyan and Tyson and their blindfolds, but I 
could&#x27;ve easily looked underneath the blindfolds I&#x27;ve worn if I had 
wanted to.

That&#x27;s flawed. Will fail in 50% of all cases. But I know a method for 
solving the cube using only &quot;U&quot; and cube rotations.

I solve with the right hand and Cross is still the hardest part of the solve
as it can be tricker friendly :-) or cube rotation friendly :-(.
For F2L, Usually Cross on the bottom but sometims on the right too.

I think that&#x27;s the difference between sub and over 25 OH guys.
Sub25 don&#x27;t care anymore about their hand but just solve the cube.
When you reach between 25 and 40 : your attention is focused on solving the
cube but still, you have to think a bit at how your hand is going to do that
Over 40 : Most of the time is dued to &quot;hand thinking&quot;

Well, that&#x27;s just my opinion.
(I&#x27;m not sub 25 yet :-(((( )

Why can&#x27;t we just put the cube underneath the table, and have your
chest (front) almost touching the edge of the table, so that you can&#x27;t
possibly look under to see the cube? The judge could probably tell if
you&#x27;re cheating or not when you&#x27;re doing it that way. Or...put it
under the table AND put on the blindfold? tha

I understand that you don&#x27;t practice ZBLL anymore. There is so many
cases so I guess only very few could master the method or at least put
in the neccesary effort to learn it.

Your BLD times are really amazing. What times do you think is possible
for the bigger cubes. sub-5 for 4x4? sub-15 for 5x5?

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

It&#x27;s interesting how people use different hands for OH and regular
cubing. I, myself, am a little ambidextrous, but I&#x27;m mostly
left-handed. Still, I mostly use my right hand for regular cubing but
my left for OH. It&#x27;s just what feels natural for me. I guess that I
use left hand for OH because it&#x27;s easy to use the some RU-algs that I
use for regular cubing. 

When I during F2L get a case that I would have solved with a LU-based
alg I tilt the cube so that the cross gets on the left side and I can
do UR-algs instead. These cases where cross is on left is usually the
fastest for me.

I&#x27;ll probably go to europe on June or July, so if it was on that time, I could participate : ( well, other way, I&#x27;ll just save money to travel maybe to the US (closer to me)...or start making competitions here in Brazil : )

  Wrong. Can&#x27;t speak for Leyan and Tyson and their blindfolds, but I 
  could&#x27;ve easily looked underneath the blindfolds I&#x27;ve worn if I had

          <div class="email-content">Hey Gunnar,

Yeah I still think the ZB method has merit, and I think it would be
fast if someone mastered it.  I&#x27;m afraid though that unless the times
of Fridrich plateau soon (which I don&#x27;t think they will) or someone&#x27;s
paying profession becomes speedcubing I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see too many
people learning the whole ZB method.  The closest person so far that I
know of is Doug Li, who last time I heard knows quite a large amount
of ZBLL and also quite a large amount of ZBF2L.  My money is on Doug
Li to be either one of the first, or literally THE first person to
learn the whole method.  Not to put pressure on Doug, it&#x27;s just that
he knows so much of the method already, I can easily see him finishing
the rest.

As for BLD, thanks about the times.  It&#x27;s just about practice really,
same as any other event.  I just choose to put all my effort into BLD,
which is why it gets easier to do it more quickly.  I can&#x27;t claim that
for 3x3x3 BLD though lol, I&#x27;ve been trying for some time to improve my
times there with some minor success, but nowhere near the rate I get
on the bigger cubes.

As for the limits, I still don&#x27;t really know.  I predict a &quot;perfect&quot;
4x4x4 solve would be memorization in maybe 2:15 and solving in 2:40 so
maybe a limit of just under 5 minutes.  This would be made more
possible by not having edge or corner parity, or having a little luck
on your side as far as number of centers already solved at the start.

A &quot;perfect&quot; 5x5x5 solve in my opinion would be a nearly perfect 4x4x4
solve (since the 5x5x5 contains the 4x4x4) as well as an exceptionally
fast solve for the +centers and central edges.  I believe if you could
do the 4x4x4 within the 5x5x5 in 5:30-6:30 then you could get sub-10
overall.  So I estimate a sub-10 5x5x5 solve would be possible, and
yeah maybe something in the sub-5 range for the 4x4x4.

I don&#x27;t think the limits are anywhere near being reached for the big
cubes BLD yet.  I sure would like to try to push them as much as I
personally can though ;-)

I predict a sub-5 solve for 4x4x4 BLD in competition including
memorization in the next 5 years.  I&#x27;ll also go ahead and predict a
sub-10 5x5x5 BLD solve in competition including memorization in the
next 5 years as well.  I mean I have no basis for this prediction
other than my own gut feeling, but I&#x27;ll put that out there for what
it&#x27;s worth.

Hi,

All you need to do is find the &quot;Fly To&quot; tab on the left hand sidebar
and cut and paste these coordinates:

47 30.72 N, 19 1.50 E

If you paste that in there exactly it takes you to the museum (or at
least what I am 99% certain is the museum, I couldn&#x27;t get the street
address to work on mine).

most cubers use it and yu jeong min has acheived sub 12 with it. Some
problems i think you&#x27;re experiencing are probably associated with the
f2l. your corner and edge do not have to be set up like they are in
the pictures for you to do them. the edge can be in the incorrect slot
but it is still possible to connect it to the corner. 

the f2l is the most important part of the solve. get that solid and
youll be sub 15 in no time

          <div class="email-content">i think out of the best methods in the cubing scene today,(fridrich,<br>
petrus, roux) fridrich is prolly fits your &quot;efficient and fast algos&quot;<br>
the most. the appeal of the system is that the cross is very easy and<br>
alot of room. f2l is in its basic form the same thing four times.<br>
while there is intuition to learn it, in the end, most of what you do<br>
during that step is your own &quot;algorithms&quot;. then OLL and PLL have<br>
extremely fast recognition and execution with enough practice, simply<br>
becasue there aren&#x27;t that many cases(relatively speaking) and they are<br>
very distinct(orientation then permutation). <br>
<br>
petrus is really only different from fridrich until the LL. and for<br>
petrus i think the building of the blocks are alot more intuitive and<br>
dont have the repetition that f2l has. maybe thats jus cause im a<br>
fridrich user. <br>
<br>
roux i think is like petrus with a more intuitive LL. but it really<br>
doesnt fit what you seem to be asking for. aside from the whole M<br>
issue, the last layer begins with COLL, which i personally think<br>
recognition is relatively hard compared to OLL. and then the edges are<br>
alot more intuitive then jus algorithms.<br>
<br>
idk thats jus my 2 cents. psht why did i type so much<br>

          <div class="email-content">I should have warned you that many people find they get noticeably 
slower when they start using F2L.  The cases are often hard to 
recognize when you&#x27;re starting.  It gets easier, though, with 
practice.

For cross, try counting the number of moves it takes you to do a 
cross.  If that number is frequently in the 8, 9, 10 or higher 
range, read Dan Harris&#x27; cross page at cubestation.co.uk or Macky&#x27;s 
cross page at cubefreak.net.

When you just do the moves, how do your 22 seconds break down?  How 
long is cross, F2L, OLL, PLL usually?

          <div class="email-content">As you are probably well aware from reassembling it 5 times, the 
eastsheen 4x4 is basically a 5x5 with a bunch of hidden pieces.  So 
between each edge pair, there&#x27;s a hidden edge which would be visible 
on the 5x5.  What happens is that that thing comes mislocated and 
blocks the movement of slice turns.  So what you should do is 
experiment to find out exactly which edge pair(s) is/are creating 
the issue, then pop that edge pair and carefully put it back in, 
putting the hidden edge in first, then the two others one at a time.

Good luck!

Why is that an issue? People are using different cubes, too.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Lars :-)

How would you possible use that to cheat? One would need to &quot;mark&quot; 
many more cubies to &quot;cheat constructively&quot;. And besides, they are 
official branded rubiks.com cubes. Would be very awkward to ban them. 
Well, no need to ban from other than bld-events of course ...

Happy cubing :-)

If these are the only generators allowed then it will solve only 50% of cases but you can 
solve in fewest moves possible in the induced metric.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been practicing blindfold, though I&#x27;m not quite ready to solve a  
full cube yet..

One of the problems you face is to bring the cube back to it&#x27;s  
original orientation after an algorithm, including various setup  
moves and rotations. Just being able to know where one center is,  
reduces the possible orientations of the cube from 24 to 4. With a  
second center marked, you&#x27;d be able to ignore this part entirely.

This is probably a minor factor for the experienced solvers, but it&#x27;s  
certainly a real one.

I think you should take if off...there were too many lucky solves, or
outliers that fasten the entire avg. Without those lucky cases it
would have been 10 around seconds...May be I&#x27;ll sub 10 without 5 lucky
cases in the near future!

Why is it that applett times are so much faster than real-life times?  Is it

up a &quot;face&quot; class and have 6 instances of that running.  Each face

just a matter of correctly writing the F, B, R, L, U, D functions.

Yeah. Harris, can you possibly make a video with split screen, showing<br>

The speed simulator just has stickers, no pieces.<br>
<br>
The cube database (http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/database/) tracks<br>
pieces.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t distinguish between position and orientation - I treat each<br>

Yeah, I actually have those programs to capture the screen. I&#x27;m shot
some, but it laggs my computer soo much that I had to stop the
program, otherwise the applet with totally freeze.

So applet for the cube activity, and another camera for the typing
(frankly I&#x27;m got a video with the screen and finger in the same view,
but the webcam got this horrible white noise...and my hands weren&#x27;t
ridiculously moving that fast anyways :P) The problem is that I can&#x27;t
have split screen videos...I only have Windows Movie Maker to edit my
videos. Anyone know or have a video editing program that can do that?

This one I did a while ago to test out the program...wasn&#x27;t that fast XP:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmBXacmlmbA

And this one&#x27;s with the horrible white noise...TURN OFF the volume:

I&#x27;m not sure if I can do that, especially in under two seconds<br>
including recognition. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with pairing from the<br>

My biggest problem with F2L is not recognizing the cases but finding<br>
enough pieces to do them with. If I have two matching pieces in the<br>

that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true very often after the cross, so that slows<br>
me down a lot.<br>

&gt; long is cross, F2L, OLL, PLL usually?<br>
<br>
Something like 3 / 10 / 5 / 4 seconds. But it varies. Bad F2L cases<br>
can take two or three seconds more, good OLL cases (I use 2-step<br>
currently) take two or three less.<br>

There is this store on ebay.co.uk that has quite a lot of stuff :
http://stores.ebay.co.uk/Rubiks-Puzzles-and-Games

On Mefferts : I am surprised there are no 2x2&#x27;s anymore. You can by the
assembly cube though.

Otherwise : www.rubiks.com should have more sotck soon.

Hope this helps,
Gilles

Seriously, I think these are realistic goals for this year. 1 of them 
has already been done and it has only been 2 weeks this year. 
Imposing is a big word, but I am interested what most people think 
will be accomplished this year. I don&#x27;t know why I wrote average of 
10 OH, I think this should be changed to average of 5 OH because all 
competitions seem to be average of 5.

My personal bests so far are 19.88 SS, 28.29 AVG, 43.47 SS-OH, 59.05 
AVG-OH. I am still using working-corner/keyhole + 4 look last layer.
I am hoping to improve those to sub 15, sub 20, sub 30, sub 40 but I 
am more into the bigger cubes.

          <div class="email-content">I have seen a lot of misinterpretations of the term God&#x27;s Algorithm 
in the past. Many people tend to think of this one (unknown) 
algorithm that you can apply to any scrambled cube to solve it 
without caring for the number of moves.

God&#x27;s Algorithm means just the opposite. Given one scrambled cube, 
God&#x27;s algorithm would be any algorithm that solves the cube in the 
least amount of moves. It has been proven that any cube can be solved 
in 28 moves or less. It has also been proven that there are some 
cubes that can only be solved in 20 moves or more.

God&#x27;s Algorithm is not reachable by speedcubers. It is not even 
reachable by the best Fewest Moves solvers. It can only be calculated 
by computers using big amounts of memory and cpu-power as Ryan Heise 
pointed out.

Finding one algorithm that is capable of solving the entire cube 
(allowing for cube rotations) is really obvious: R (actually R&#x27; or B 
would work just as well). A more usefull approach, such as &quot;Gilles&quot; 
(F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;) or &quot;my&quot; http://z12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?
showtopic=410 is a really fun exercise to do yourself.

          <div class="email-content">Serious answer: Group simular cases and then learn them 1 (or 2) at a 
time. For example on the OLL, there is a group of 7 cases for the 
corners only (Group &quot;1&quot;). You can split this group in subgroups with 0 
corners correct (2),  corner correct (2) and 2 corners correct (3). 
Pick one subgroup and see if some cases are inverses/mirrors of each 
other. If there are simular algorithms learn them at the same time, 
otherwise just learn them one at a time. Then switch to the next 
subgroup, etc.

I guess that´s the reason...you can just memorise the typing for the algs, and do that faster...and you can see across the cube...

but that&#x27;s not my case...I&#x27;m slower on the simulator than on real cubing

The best humans can hope for is a human-Thistlethwaite method. there 
would still be 1000&#x27;s of algorithm to learn and i cannot imagine how 
fast recognition would be possible. But one can dream on ... Btw im 
no fan of memorising algs so it wouldn&#x27;t be for me ;-)

I doubt it&#x27;s even close to top-50 on google&#x27;s ranking. Come on, we

I don&#x27;t think that is actually possible, but it might be possible for people
to APPROACH God&#x27;s Algorithm. I don&#x27;t think that will happen anytime soon. I
think it is important to mention that Fewest Moves was 1 of 2 records that
wasn&#x27;t broken last year. Everybody seems to focus on speed and not on
theory. Maybe this will change in a few years when the limits of the
Fridrich / Petrus / Roux methods have been reached and another method needs
to be developed. Or maybe finding a &quot;21&quot;-er might get people more interested
in the theory of the cube again, after all a &quot;20&quot;-er was found decades ago!

If you mean a 21-er fewest moves that has been reached already. The 
best unofficial solution by human for fewest moves was 19 turns. 
Several people have achieved 21 turns, but not in official competition 
yet - still 28 is the best, to a large extent due to the 1 hr 
limitation!!

Well, what you normally do is get a random sequence of faces such that
you can&#x27;t have the same face twice in a row and you can&#x27;t have
something like R L R, and then you assign them a random turn value
(for example, choose from R, R&#x27;, R2). You can choose the turn values
as you choose the faces or after you have the sequence of faces,
depending on your programming style.

You might benefit from reading the source code for some other cube<br>
applets on the web.<br>
<br>
Most of the current ones were derived from Kornell&#x27;s original applet:<br>
<br>
    http://www.javaonthebrain.com/java/rubik/<br>
<br>
including:<br>
<br>
    http://www.lar5.com/cube/downloads.html (from Lars Petrus)<br>
    http://software.rubikscube.info/AnimCube/ (from Josef Jelinek)<br>
<br>
If you prefer to see code separated into different classes, then Lars&#x27;<br>
version may be easier to read. The others are crammed into a single<br>
class, optimised for size.<br>
<br>
There is also Werner Randelshofer&#x27;s applet which is written completely<br>
from scratch, although its animation is not quite as smooth as the<br>
Kornell-based ones:<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi!!

I just wanted to say that I know is part of the sub-25 average club.
:-) I just got this average:

Average: 24.75 seconds
22.68, 29.31, 22.74, 23.21, 22.66, 27.98, 24.13, 23.12, 26.23, 25.48,
(29.84), (21.43)

There were no lucky times. I have practice OH very much lately and I
have managed to get a sub-10 average for LL one-handed. During this
average the F2L also was very fast and I was able to look ahead much
and the trigger were faster than ever.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, I came up with this theory a while ago.  It used to be Máté in 
first, Mátyás in second, then Milán in third, and Máté has an accent 
in his last name also, so 1st place had an M and 3 accents, second had 
an M and 2 accents, and third had an M and 1 accent.  That&#x27;s why Bob&#x27;s 
so far behind...
I was discussing with a friend a while ago a strategy for improving 
the UWR for master magic.  Our conversation was something like &quot;So 
let&#x27;s find a hungarian with his first name starting with M and tons of 
accents...&quot;  We got the weirdest looks from people who were listening 
in on our conversation...

I don&#x27;t know... if your cube isn&#x27;t good enough you may have a serious
broken/popped pieces situation on your hands. You wouldn&#x27;t want to do
this with a 5x5x5, for example...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bernett!

How are you doing?

This approah for 4x4 solving sounds difficult.. But hey, some ppl 
thought F2L was way to difficult to apply once :), so you can never 
be sure.

If you hate parity, maybe you should try a cage method. If Per is 
about to finish his cage, and he has to swap UFr and UBr edges, then 
he can simply do once move: r, and that leaves him a 3-edge-cycle. He 
can do this, because at this point the centers are not solved yet. 
That is one of the benefits about doing centers last: easy parity 
handling.

Good luck!!

- Joël.

P.S.: How is BLD cubing going for you..? Did you make any progress 
lately?

Explain to me how this would eliminate &quot;parity&quot; - having to swap 2 
singular edges occasionally!! Even if you proceed by building those 
2x2x2 blocks around d corners u cannot be sure the situation never 
arises. Or if i&#x27;m wrong please explain to me why im wrong about this. 
No matter what method/procedure you may try the &quot;parity&quot; is bound to 
show its ugly head in one way or another, unless somehow being able 
to &quot;see&quot; parity before doing anything and do some adjustment (inner 
layer quarterturn) at the very beginning ;-)

On the other hand reducing to 2x2x2 is not feasible. Recognition is 
too terrible even for those used to pair up edges and no do &quot;direct 
solving&quot; :-o

- If you attempt to reduce a 4x4x4 to a 3x3x3, the pieces may not always<br>
  fall into the 3x3x3 cube group, and in this case wouldn&#x27;t be solvable<br>
  using only 3x3x3 moves.<br>

<br>
On any NxNxN cube (N &gt;= 2), the corners always follow the same<br>
restrictions, so there can&#x27;t be any new corner parity issues introduced<br>
by larger cubes. And if you successfully bind the neighbouring pieces<br>

Yes of course Ryan. But if you end up with 2 edges swapped you don&#x27;t 
have those nice 2x2x2 corner blocks emulating a plain 2x2x2 cube in 
the first place. That&#x27;s my point. The reduction to 2x2x2 may have to 
involve an edge swap - the parity. So you won&#x27;t have an easier ride 
with respect to parities than for 3x3x3 reduction. Well except that 
you eliminate the permutation parity. You will still have 
the &quot;orientation parity&quot;. Clear now ??

You eliminate one of the 2 parities of 3x3x3 reduction but you have a 
MUCH harder ride getting there. It can likewise be said that when you 
have reduced to 3x3x3 solving you also have no parities. It&#x27;s just 
that sometimes it just SEEMS like it&#x27;s &quot;normal 3x3x3&quot; solvable. The 
(2) parities may still be there. It&#x27;s just like a 3x3x3 with 2 
swapped edges or a singular swapped edge. A real 3x3x3 is not 
solvable when this happens (by wrong assembly) but the 4x4x4 will be 
because the &quot;edges&quot; are really 2 edges ;-)

The parity problem in &quot;big cubes&quot; refers specifically to the problem of<br>
joining pieces together and &quot;not knowing&quot; if you&#x27;re doing it with odd<br>
(incorrect) parity.<br>
<br>
This can happen in the 3x3x3 reduction because people don&#x27;t know when<br>
they are joining the last edges together whether they are joining them<br>
with even parity or not. But in a 2x2x2 reduction, we KNOW exactly how<br>
each edge piece should be joined with the corner.<br>
<br>
Yes, suppose you solve all the edges except for the last two, and<br>
the last two are wrong. Then you just solve the last two edges, and<br>
that&#x27;s that! Yes, there is a parity issue here, but it is not the<br>
commonly known &quot;big cube&quot; parity problem.<br>
<br>
In fact, this parity issue that you are referring to is just the normal<br>
one that can even occur in normal 3x3x3 cubes. Suppose you solve a<br>
normal 3x3x3 cube edges first, and you solve all of the edges except for<br>
the last two, but you find the last two edges swapped. What do you do?<br>
You just swap them! There&#x27;s nothing special here, you swap them, while<br>
swapping two of the unsolved pieces in the process.<br>
<br>
In the 4x4x4, when you get to the last two edges, you can solve them<br>
while affecting two of the unsolved centres also.<br>

  I would definitely be interested in an every-year event.  I brought this issue up before, we could have an event called the &quot;US Open&quot; that alternates every year with the US Nationals.  While Worlds will be towards the end of the year, we could make this tournament early summer, maybe late May or early June.  If you need any help whatsoever setting any of it up, I can help you out in any way, just send me an email.

Thanks.

  Hi Everyone,

  This mainly concerns US competitors so I&#x27;ll be moving the discussion to the
  Caltech group after this. I was wondering how people would feel about
  having a regular tournament in Las Vegas every year?

  I know the East Coast people really wanted stuff out there, and I am working
  on places such as Philadelphia or New York, but I potentially have a pretty
  regular opportunity in Las Vegas. Potentially, we could make an agreement
  until 2011, but I wanted to gauge the interest because this would be
  somewhat of a commitment.

          <div class="email-content">Practice, Practice, Practice.  All I can say is practice.  As for the cross, I still do the cross on top first and then flip the cube.  My friends have told me I should do it with cross on the bottom and it does have its advantages, but for me, it has become somewhat of a habit.  Either way works, but you will have some advantages with the cross on the bottom.

 Video is courtsey of Dan Dzoan.  It should be noted that this event will NOT
 be sanctioned by the WCA.  Ever.
 
 Thanks to Chris, Lars, and Bob for being such good sports.  We picked you,
 because we knew you wouldn&#x27;t sue us.

          <div class="email-content">I also would be very interested in this. It&#x27;s hard to make it to the 
world competition when it&#x27;s over seas, and since US Nationals 
alternate with it, if i can&#x27;t make it to the world competition then i 
can&#x27;t make it to any major events that year. Las Vegas would be 
pretty fun, though i think like New York or Chicago or some place 
like that would be really awesome. Thanks for all the work you put 
into this Tyson!

          <div class="email-content">As a high school student, I&#x27;d like to touch on that.  Kirk is right that it might be difficult for younger cubers, such as myself, to go to Vegas.  I have been to Vegas twice and enjoyed it very much.  I know that my parents would not let me go unless I was either with one of them or with a friend and one of his parents.  Also, they don&#x27;t have to stay on the strip.  There are plenty of hotels around that will be an easy drive, or possibly walk, to the competition.  On the matter of what is on the strip, some of it can be a little much for, say, a 15 year old.  You could always distract them with the Blue Man Group (if you haven&#x27;t seen them in concert, GO!!! It&#x27;s worth it!!!!) or mindless arcades (always fun).  And if they&#x27;re only in town long enough for the competition, they&#x27;ll probably spend most of their time at the competition.  However, Kirk is right, we can&#x27;t over look the fact that Vegas has its negative influences on teenagers.

If you build 2x2x2 blocks on the 4x4x4, you can indeed avoid the permutation
parity but not the so-called &quot;orientation parity&quot;.

If you know a bit of 4x4x4 Blindfolded using 3 cycles, you also know exactly
where each piece has to go.
Therefore you avoid the &quot;permuation parity&quot;, but you can still have an
&quot;orientation parity&quot;.

I also do not think your comparison with the 3x3x3 is correct.
When you solve edges first and that you find only 2 edges swaped at the end,
this situation can be solved very easily by the move &quot;U&quot; (or R or whatever
face you are working on), then transforming your 2 edge swap into a 3 cycle.
For the bigger cubes, you can do as much Us as you want, you will never
solve the parity with it.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I also pretty much agree with all of the points discussed so 
far.  A big tournament every year would be great, and I definetely 
think it should be held over 2 or 3 days.  This would provide for 
more time for events, and have more events in total.  As for the 
location, I think it would be a good idea to switch it around each 
year.  Las Vegas would probably not be ideal.  So maybe, San 
Francisco this year, if we were to start it this year, and then 
somewhere on the east coast, then possibly southern California, etc.  
This way, more people would be able to participate in such large 
events.

know that my parents would not let me go unless I was either with one

have to stay on the strip.  There are plenty of hotels around that

matter of what is on the strip, some of it can be a little much for, 
say, a 15 year old.  You could always distract them with the Blue Man 
Group (if you haven&#x27;t seen them in concert, GO!!! It&#x27;s worth it!!!!) 
or mindless arcades (always fun).  And if they&#x27;re only in town long 
enough for the competition, they&#x27;ll probably spend most of their time 
at the competition.  However, Kirk is right, we can&#x27;t over look the 
fact that Vegas has its negative influences on teenagers.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Ok Ryan, i suggest you have a go at reducing to 2x2x2 from 4x4x4. let 
me know if you find a way to avoid &quot;parity&quot; - swapping 2 edges. My 
bet is that you will realise you were wrong about the parity.

In fact the parity will be much worse to fix with those 2x2x2 blocks. 
Chris&#x27; or Fredericks &quot;edge-swap&quot; does mess with centers. But for 
3x3x3 reduction you will not see this because similar color centers 
are being swapped. With 2x2x2 blocks this may involve 2 center swaps 
with 4 different colors involved! Of course this is fixable with a 
supergroup algorithm like (R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U)*2. But the whole parity 
fix becomes lenghty and quite nasty.

The 5x5x5 supercube actually does not have a &quot;pure edge parity&quot;. If 2 
outer edges need to be swapped you will also see this as 2 edge-
centers being swapped too. The inner layer turn r,l,u,d or whatever 
that caused the edge-parity has the following cyclical decomposition:

wing edges : 1 4-cycle, odd permutation > parity
corner centers: 2 4-cycles, even permutation > no parity
edge centers: 1 4-cycle, odd permutation > parity

Kind regards,

Per

          <div class="email-content">If you would turn a 4x4x4 into a 2x2x2 wouldn&#x27;t you get possibilities for
(other) parities also? It is an interesting approach, but I don&#x27;t think it
will ever be fast.

Jaap Scherphuis had a nice challenge that might be relevant to this approach
that would avoid such parities: First scramble as a 2x2x2 (only inner
slices), then as a 3x3x3 (only outer layers). Solve as a 3x3x3 first, then
as a 2x2x2.

But, the time taken is more for me. I think the other way to eliminate
parity is dissolve 444 to 222 first and then solve it as 222.
>            I am confident many of you would have tried already. I like to

curious to learn how to dissolve 444 into 222.

Being sub 25 OH is still a long way to go for me. I am still using
keyhole/working corner + 4 look last layer and average just below 60 with
this.

My solve would break down like F2L: 40s, LL: 20s, which is 67%, 33%.
Your solve breaks down like F2L: 15s, LL: 10s, which is 60%, 40%. 

This either means my F2L is slow and LL is fast, or your F2L is fast and LL
is slow.

How do one-handed solves of others break down?

I have tried both versions.

One was much harder than the other. I guess the latter was the harder

PS! I cannot think of what other parities one would have by reducing 
to 2x2x2 first on a 4x4x4 randomly scrambled using allowed turns.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

If you do f2l in the fridrich way with cross first then 4 c/e pairs i 
guess cross at bottom/right/left is faster than cross top. It&#x27;s 
easier to trigger with many U turns than with many D turns :D

For doing intuitive f2l i guess orientation won&#x27;t matter too much. 
With &quot;f2l&quot; down it can be harder to track the cubies because cubies 
may more easily become &quot;invisible&quot; but one will also on the other 
hand have more D turns, same as i said for cross-first.

There is not really a right or wrong here, it&#x27;s just consensus that 
with cross not on top it will be faster. And besides, lookahead to 
OLL/PLL will be better with LL up ;-) ALL LL-algs i have seen on 
websites have LL up !!! In early 80&#x27;s, when i started out, everyone 
finished with LL as D. Times have changed, quite literally too ;-)

Average: 24.39 seconds

23.40, (31.54), 20.88, 25.84

On a sub 20 solve, F2L must be done in 10 seconds absolutely because I am
still somewhat just over 10 seconds for LL on average.

Really fast solves feature fast F2L and relatively basic OLL and PLL. But 25
seconds is totally reachable for nearly all cases now for me (exept a few
PLL cases :-(

I will look forward to do that in competition in 2 weeks in France. :-)

My advice : lube your cube and burn your fingers :D
I just burned my right index yesterday but nonetheless it doesn&#x27;t seem to
affect the times (ok it&#x27;s not that bad but..still) :-)

&gt; I am sorry but I do not agree with you.<br>
&gt; If you build 2x2x2 blocks on the 4x4x4, you can indeed avoid the permutation<br>
&gt; parity but not the so-called &quot;orientation parity&quot;.<br>
<br>
I think this little argument has stemmed from a blurred definition of<br>
&quot;orientation parity&quot;. I think we need a different name for different<br>
things.<br>
<br>
This &quot;orientation parity&quot; is really more precisely named:<br>
<br>
    the &quot;pseudo 3x3x3 edge orientation parity&quot;.<br>
    <br>
That is, it occurs when the pseudo edges of a pseudo 3x3x3 have an odd<br>
orientation parity.<br>
<br>
And the &quot;permutation parity&quot; is really more precisely named:<br>
<br>
    the &quot;pseudo 3x3x3 permutation parity&quot;.<br>
<br>
That is, it occurs when the pseudo pieces of a pseudo 3x3x3 have an odd<br>
permutation parity.<br>
<br>
Both of these pseudo parity problems are unique to pseudo cubes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then there are normal (non-pseudo) parities, involving the actual (not<br>
pseudo) pieces. Unlike the pseudo parity problems where the whole pseudo<br>
cube has an odd parity, in normal (non-pseudo) parity problems, the<br>
whole cube has (it must!) an even parity, but an even number of<br>
categories of pieces each have an odd parity (giving a total even<br>
parity).<br>
<br>
We don&#x27;t normally consider these &quot;problems&quot;. The only place I&#x27;ve heard<br>
these described as &quot;problems&quot; is in blindfolded cubing where many people<br>
(except perhaps Stefan) prefer to use algorithms that preserve the<br>
parity of each individual category of pieces. Obviously, in say the<br>
3x3x3, this only works in half of the cases, and in the other half,<br>
these people say it&#x27;s a &quot;problem&quot; :-) (and I understand that, but it&#x27;s<br>
not the problem J.Bernett was trying to avoid at all.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Then, also, there is this parity problem in the 4x4x4 cubes which comes<br>
from doing centres first:<br>
<br>
    the &quot;indeterminate centre parity problem&quot;.<br>
<br>
That is, we can&#x27;t tell if they have an even permutation parity just by<br>
looking at them. But we can avoid the problem by doing the centres last.<br>
As long as everything else is ok, we know that the centres must be even.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, so now we have different names for different things, and I can<br>
finally say this:<br>
<br>
<br>
The pseudo 3x3x3 edge orientation parity problem cannot occur in a<br>
reduction to a pseudo 2x2x2 simply since a pseudo 2x2x2 doesn&#x27;t have<br>
pseudo edges, and there is also no pseudo corner parity problem since<br>
corners always follow the same restrictions on any NxNxN cube (N &gt;= 2).<br>
If there is a parity problem, it&#x27;s just not a pseudo parity problem and<br>
is obviously not what J.Bernett&#x27;s 2x2x2 reduction was intended to avoid.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure many people have seen the reduction to a pseudo 2x2x2 cube as a<br>
way to avoid the pseudo 3x3x3 parity problems (and in fact all pseudo<br>
parity problems). These strategies are not intended to eliminate all<br>
parity issues altogether, though. As you know, that&#x27;s impossible. They<br>
are just intended to eliminate the pseudo parity problems.<br>

          <div class="email-content">My post came a little late, I didn&#x27;t think parities through like it has been
done in the previous threads. I could however see that parities would occur
and could not be fixed with the &quot;standard&quot; algs.

I use a 4 look last layer and I hate OLL-parity, but PLL-parity is just
another edge-cycle to me that doesn&#x27;t hurt my time at all.

I think the only way to do OLL-parity without losing time is to keep some
LL-edges disconnected untill you reach the 3x3x3 LL part of your solve. Than
you can connected the last edges AND solve OLL-parity in 1 step with only a
few algorithms. You would loose some time during OLL, but you would win some
time during the earlier edge pairing. (You could also develop OLL algorithms
that include the OLL-parity fix, but that would require very many new
algorithms)

          <div class="email-content">I started cubing when I was 10 (1986) and the only method I could find (all
layer by layer) had LL on top. LL was:
1. Edge Orientation,
2. Edge Permutation,
3. Corner Permutation,
4. Corner Orientation.
Step 4 literally twisted 1 corner at a time using (F D F&#x27; D&#x27;)*2.

As soon as I started speedsolving (2006) I turned the cube upside down for
step 4 and did (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*2.

Times had changed for me, but the other way around!

(just to be clear, I don&#x27;t use that method anymore and I keep LL on top all
the time now)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per and Ryan,

A few minutes ago I solved a 4x4 by first making it into a 2x2.
These were my experiences:
- three 2x2x2 blocks were made without any problem, although it was very hard to find the correct pieces belong to the block
- from then on my movements were so blocked that I had to use 3-cycles (for centers and for edge pieces) to make three more blocks
- the last two blocks I solved corners (already &quot;solved&quot;), then centers, then edge pieces all with 3-cycles.
- solving these two blocks was a pain, because for some 3-cycles I had to do set up moves, where a few times I messed up the earlier blocks again
- at the end of the blocks I had two edges pieces swapped, since this situation was not solvable with the earlier 3-cycles I considered this a &quot;parity&quot; and a &quot;problem&quot;
- after applying the orientation parity algorithm some centers of other blocks were messed up again
- after solving these centers again, the 2x2 phase was easy.

My conclusion: bad system for 4x4.

Have fun,

Ron

  Hi :-)

  Ok Ryan, i suggest you have a go at reducing to 2x2x2 from 4x4x4. let 
  me know if you find a way to avoid &quot;parity&quot; - swapping 2 edges. My 
  bet is that you will realise you were wrong about the parity.

  In fact the parity will be much worse to fix with those 2x2x2 blocks. 
  Chris&#x27; or Fredericks &quot;edge-swap&quot; does mess with centers. But for 
  3x3x3 reduction you will not see this because similar color centers 
  are being swapped. With 2x2x2 blocks this may involve 2 center swaps 
  with 4 different colors involved! Of course this is fixable with a 
  supergroup algorithm like (R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U)*2. But the whole parity 
  fix becomes lenghty and quite nasty.

  The 5x5x5 supercube actually does not have a &quot;pure edge parity&quot;. If 2 
  outer edges need to be swapped you will also see this as 2 edge-
  centers being swapped too. The inner layer turn r,l,u,d or whatever 
  that caused the edge-parity has the following cyclical decomposition:

  wing edges : 1 4-cycle, odd permutation > parity
  corner centers: 2 4-cycles, even permutation > no parity
  edge centers: 1 4-cycle, odd permutation > parity

  Kind regards,

  Per

If someone has a 4x4 solver, it would be nice to have an OLL parity fix that
only affects 2 center pieces.
Thus avoiding the reconstruction of the blocks messed ud by the center
movements.

          <div class="email-content">Switching it around yearly would be a good idea.  I don&#x27;t mind Las Vegas, but switching it around would allow easier access for others to make the event a fair location for all.  Maybe start in Las Vegas, then move to maybe Austin, or Denver, then over to the east coast, etc.  All those locations are debatable.

  Yeah, I also pretty much agree with all of the points discussed so 
  far. A big tournament every year would be great, and I definetely 
  think it should be held over 2 or 3 days. This would provide for 
  more time for events, and have more events in total. As for the 
  location, I think it would be a good idea to switch it around each 
  year. Las Vegas would probably not be ideal. So maybe, San 
  Francisco this year, if we were to start it this year, and then 
  somewhere on the east coast, then possibly southern California, etc. 
  This way, more people would be able to participate in such large 
  events.

Whoa, that was a quick conclusion. Your experience (especially all 
the 3-cycles) sounded a lot like my first attempt to solve a UuRr 
scrambled 4x4 with those moves, took me 30-40 minutes. Then I found 
easier ways to do things and practiced quite a bit and got a 1:20-
1:30 average.

Cheers!

Swap Ul with Ur, and swap the 2x2x2 block based on ULB with the 2x2x2 block

ISn&#x27;t it a nice parity fix ?
The algorithm must be long though...

          <div class="email-content">Thanks!  The case was fairly easy.  I think it was a 4 move cross and
so I was able to set up an F2L pair while forming my cross except by
setting that up, it actually set up another F2L pair also so it was a
little bit lucky.  Also, if you watch the last F2L pair that I insert,
I end up undoing those exact same moves as the first half of my OLL
(anti sune i think?).  So, if I had done a U&#x27; before inserting my last
pair, I would have had a free OLL =p.  Overall I was pretty lucky with
the cases I had.

&gt; In fact the parity will be much worse to fix with those 2x2x2 blocks. <br>
&gt; Chris&#x27; or Fredericks &quot;edge-swap&quot; does mess with centers. But for <br>
&gt; 3x3x3 reduction you will not see this because similar color centers <br>
&gt; are being swapped. With 2x2x2 blocks this may involve 2 center swaps <br>
&gt; with 4 different colors involved!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me describe a strategy that works:<br>
<br>
- First attach all the edges to the corners.<br>
- Second, attach the centres to the corners.<br>
- Third, solve as a 2x2x2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, let me describe which parity problems this avoids:<br>
<br>
- It avoids the pseudo parity problems.<br>
- It avoids the indeterminate centre permutation parity problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, let me describe which parity problems this doesn&#x27;t avoid:<br>
<br>
- The normal ones which are always present and impossible to avoid<br>
  whatever method you use. I don&#x27;t consider these really problems, they<br>
  are part of normal solving and we have to accept them.<br>

Now, let me explain why I entered this conversation:<br>

Of course you can&#x27;t eliminate having to swap 2 edges. This is true even<br>
on a 3x3x3. That doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t avoid pseudo cube parity<br>
problems.<br>

When I do world records I don&#x27;t even say anything. 

So anssi, what exactly do you mean by this comment? There&#x27;s nothing
wrong with being happy about the record. Dan has never said or even
implied that he&#x27;s better than anyone so I&#x27;m not quite sure why you
made such a comment on his video. In fact, he&#x27;s a pretty modest guy
and is a very friendly guy to compete with.

Couple notes about this results.  Final Round from the Caltech Winter 2007
competition was 12 people, not just 8.  It was not a national championship.
And the 12th place guy didn&#x27;t do so well, but he&#x27;s a loser anyway so we
don&#x27;t really care about him.  Total competitors was 101, and spectator count
over the course of the day was probably around 10,000 people with about 650
people watching during the final round.  So there is certainly a lot of
pressure.

That is a real inviting response.

To learn the F2L, I&#x27;d recommend checking out cubestation.co.uk .  Click on the 3x3 guide on the left.  If you need further help, feel free to ask.

          <div class="email-content">Try to solve the cross on the left or on the front. It can help you
with recognizing the remainder of F2L, and it will help you transition
to a full-fledged cross down solve. I use it, and it helps me to
achieve a 15-17 second F2L solve. As with your first question, you
need to be patient and continue to work at what you find is slow. If
there is one algorithm that takes you awhile, just because it doesn&#x27;t
flow nicely from your hands to the cube, just try to find another
algorithm performing the same action, and just do it over and over,
until it becomes muscle memory. Then you will be able to achieve very
fast time, or so I have found.

My friends have told me I should do it with cross on the bottom and it
does have its advantages, but for me, it has become somewhat of a
habit.  Either way works, but you will have some advantages with the
cross on the bottom.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I think maybe the confusion arises from what is meant by an edge. For 
those used to 3x3x3 reduction some like to think they are 
constructing &quot;edges&quot; whereas what they are doing is making edgepairs. 
For 2x2x reduction those edgepairs will not even exist.

As for 2x2x2 reductions unsuitability as speedsolving method 
conclusions can be drawn not only from those few attempts made by 
some peop0le but also from theoretical points of view, especially 
with regards to recognition. If making theose blocks are possible 
without resorting to 3-cycle and parity fixes, that would really 
require exceptional lookahead and recognition.

There&#x27;s other ways of eliminating any parity that might work if 
spending some time making up nice algorithm.

Personally i find the following promising:

Start by completing 2 opposite layers.
Proceed by &quot;diffusing&quot; the middle layers edges to their respective 
layers, such that 1 of those inner layer has all edges solved. Parity 
is now fixed by a quarter turn of that layer. It only affects 
unsolved edges/centers. Fix the rest by a few fast/easy 3-cycles on 
edges/centres. I know people have worked on very similar approaches 
to this already :-)

Yes, finding a method that eliminates all possible parities for 4x4x4 <br>
is a great idea. However, reducing to 2x2x2 is flawed due to many <br>
reasons already mentioned. I do believe that fast methods with no <br>
parity, or trivial parity fix(es) MUST exist. We have just not found <br>
them yet :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Forgive me if this has already been brought up, but reading these
posts made me think of this.

Would it be a viable solution method for the 6x6x6 cube to reduce to a
4x4x4 cube?  You could build 2x2 center blocks across the entire cube,
then 2x1x1 edge pseudo blocks until you were ready to solve as a 6x6x6.

This would leave you with all the parities of the 4x4x4 cube, and I
don&#x27;t think anything else.  There would be the case where you would
have to solve a 6x6x6 parity of the edges in order to create the last
2x1x1 pseudo edge block, but if you were smart about it you could save
this step until the very end, solve it as a pure parity, and always
avoid the 4x4x4 OLL parity case.  You would still have the possibility
of the PLL parity though, if I&#x27;m not mistaken.

Anyway sorry if this has already been brought up, but I thought it was
an interesting idea.

  Hi guys,

  This week I had a visitor from the Vatican:

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris :-)

Just to make sure i got you correct, you want to reduce to a 4x4x4 
cube like so : 1+2+2+1 layerwise?

I guess it&#x27;s doable but i have a great doubt about it&#x27;s speed 
compared with normal 3x3x3 reduction or also lbl methods. My cage 
method is a pseudo lbl method - centers last.

There aren&#x27;t many around who may have a go at such an approach, 
unless with gabbasoft or other computer simulation ;-)

alg orients the pi case for corners and preserves everything else in <br>
only 15 turns STM, 18 QTM (I&#x27;m not sure but as I remember I got 16 <br>
turns HTM from CubeX for this case). The alg is not only short, it&#x27;s <br>
fast too =)<br>

<br>
Do cube orientations to get the B-turns to the U-side for faster <br>
execution.<br>
<br>
The alg is based on two well knowned algs : F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; <br>
and B&#x27; R B M&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; B M but the first part is done as fron the <br>
backside of the cube and also mirroed to get the moves back to the <br>
right side and also saving two turns.<br>

I often trial for algs and find a lot of them but this was probably <br>
the first time I hadf a real WOW!! when I found it, (because I know <br>
this is a hard case).<br>

Kenneth Gustavsson &lt;kenneth@...> escreveu:                                  Hey! I just found a great alg for one of the hardest LL cases. The 
 alg orients the pi case for corners and preserves everything else in 
 only 15 turns STM, 18 QTM (I&#x27;m not sure but as I remember I got 16 
 turns HTM from CubeX for this case). The alg is not only short, it&#x27;s 
 fast too =)
 
 The alg: B&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R2 B M&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; B M
 
 Do cube orientations to get the B-turns to the U-side for faster 
 execution.
 
 The alg is based on two well knowned algs : F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; 
 and B&#x27; R B M&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; B M but the first part is done as fron the 
 backside of the cube and also mirroed to get the moves back to the 
 right side and also saving two turns.
 
 I often trial for algs and find a lot of them but this was probably 
 the first time I hadf a real WOW!! when I found it, (because I know 
 this is a hard case).
 
 Any BLD cubers who like this? (I assume you do =)

&gt; Yes, finding a method that eliminates all possible parities for 4x4x4 <br>
&gt; is a great idea.<br>
<br>
J.Bernett did not say &quot;all possible parities&quot;, he said 4x4x4 parities,<br>
which you are interpreting how you like, but I think it has a more<br>
obvious interpretation, based on common descriptions of the 4x4x4 parity<br>
problems you find on various 4x4x4 solution web pages.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even on Chris&#x27; page, this is what he considers to be the 4x4x4 parity<br>
problems:<br>
<br>
    http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4speedsolve3.html<br>
<br>
They are the pseudo 3x3x3 parity problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
Does anyone think &quot;pseudo 3x3x3&quot; is not a useful term to describe what&#x27;s<br>
going on here? When we build a pseudo 3x3x3 with an odd orientation or<br>
odd permutation parity, then it is not solvable using legal 3x3x3 moves.<br>
This is the pseudo 3x3x3 parity problem. It is the typical one that<br>
people think about when solving a 4x4x4 by a reduction to 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
And it seems obvious that this is what J.Bernett means by 4x4x4 parity<br>
problems in his email.<br>
<br>
I am really surprised that people think he meant something different.<br>
<br>
Please tell me which points below you agree/disagree with:<br>
<br>
1. By &quot;4x4x4 parities&quot; J.Bernett means the ones described on Chris&#x27;<br>
   page.<br>
2. The parity problems that I refer to as the pseudo 3x3x3 parity<br>
   problems are exactly the same as the problems described on Chris&#x27;<br>
   page.<br>
3. Therefore, by &quot;4x4x4 parities&quot; J.Bernett is talking about what I<br>
   refer to as the pseudo 3x3x3 parity problems.<br>

          Thank u for your replies. Infact, I do not know anything about it. It suddenly flashed in my mind that it may eliminate parity.But now I understood it will not eliminate parity.

          Hi Bernett!!

Explain to me how this would eliminate &quot;parity&quot; - having to swap 2 
singular edges occasionally!! Even if you proceed by building those 
2x2x2 blocks around d corners u cannot be sure the situation never 
arises. Or if i&#x27;m wrong please explain to me why im wrong about this. 
No matter what method/procedure you may try the &quot;parity&quot; is bound to 
show its ugly head in one way or another, unless somehow being able 
to &quot;see&quot; parity before doing anything and do some adjustment (inner 
layer quarterturn) at the very beginning ;-)

On the other hand reducing to 2x2x2 is not feasible. Recognition is 
too terrible even for those used to pair up edges and no do &quot;direct 
solving&quot; :-o

Hi J.Bernett,<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t agree with Per. Here is a 2x2x2 reduction strategy that avoids<br>
parity problems:<br>
<br>
1. Attach the edges using an algorithm to swap 2 edges and 2 centres.<br>
2. Attach the centres using an algorithm that cycles 3 centres.<br>
3. Solve the pseudo 2x2x2.<br>

I agree with you now.

But if you go back to &quot;wings 3 cycles&quot; and &quot;centers 3 cycles&quot; method, then a
parity problem can appear.

Do we agree on this ?

Actually no I didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t assume, I read. And *if* you have 
looked around and weren&#x27;t satisfied, *say so*.

I guess I&#x27;m just not the spoon-feeding-and-petting-you kind of guy, 
but the slap-you-in-the-face-so-you-start-thinking-and-become-able-to-
do-things-on-your-own kind of guy.

Oh hey wait a minute. My reply did give him two explicit pieces of 
advice: practice and look for existing tutorials. I guess after all I 
did try to help him get that ability to do research that you 
mentioned. On the other hand, there are people (won&#x27;t say names) who 
just try to keep him &quot;computer illiterate&quot; by feeding him a link.

I think there&#x27;s no tutorial besides the ACube.txt file that comes 
with it. I recommend writing input into file in.txt and using this 
run.bat file:

java -cp ACube3.jar ACube q a &lt; in.txt > out.txt

Then you just double-click the .bat and it produces the out.txt file.

Pretty much, yeah, except more like the original (with the fishing,

Maybe you guys really ought to stop using the term &quot;problem&quot;. It&#x27;s 
highly ambiguous, mostly I think because it&#x27;s a &quot;problem&quot; only for a 
specific method. And only by loose choice: why do you call something 
a problem at all when you actually have no problem solving it?

Ryan did a good job offering several more precise terms in message 
32723 but it might be better to explicitly abolish the word &quot;problem&quot; 
completely. Just talk about even or odd parity maybe?

Cheers!
Stefan

P.S. Let me throw in the 4x4-via-pseudoDomino idea again.

  Actually no I didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t assume, I read. And *if* you have

  Oh hey wait a minute. My reply did give him two explicit pieces of

  did try to help him get that ability to do research that you 
  mentioned. On the other hand, there are people (won&#x27;t say names) who

I do not &quot;assume&quot; the competition took place, instead I &quot;believe&quot; it. 
No need to assume something that has been stated. Btw, I don&#x27;t know 
the competition took place. I don&#x27;t even know whether I existed 
yesterday. I try to be careful with that word.

He didn&#x27;t state that he had looked around so why should I assume he 
had? To the contrary, *not* giving this information is a strong 
indication that he had *not*.

But yes, I admit more precisely I should&#x27;ve said &quot;I don&#x27;t assume more 
positive information than stated&quot;, as I clearly did assume negative 
information from negative evidence.

> Anyways, the point is, the person was simply asking for advice.

And I did give him two pieces of advice and I&#x27;m convinced they&#x27;re 
good ones. Do you disagree? I even wrote it as a question, inviting 
him to elaborate on what he had done so far. All that in a single 
sentence, I call that an achievement.

          <div class="email-content">Stefan&#x27;s answer was valid advice. There isn&#x27;t any magical algorithm or
technique that will suddenly make the Fridrich method easier to learn.
It&#x27;s all practice.

If I were new to a community, usually I&#x27;d try to find out whatever I
could on my own before asking such an elementary question. There are
plenty of links on cubing around the web, and even in the Links
section of this group. If he had provided some evidence of research or
effort, e.g. &quot;I tried this site and this site, but they don&#x27;t really
have what I&#x27;m looking for,&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ve been practicing for two months,
but I don&#x27;t seem to be getting any faster. Do you have any advice?&quot;
his question would probably invite a more helpful response.

          <div class="email-content">This is a weird discussion to watch.<br>
<br>
First, Bernett thinks reducing the 4x4x4 to a 2x2x2 might eliminate <br>
parity.<br>
<br>
Second, Per doesn&#x27;t understand why, because you still might encounter <br>
the situation where you will have to swap two pieces. Once you have <br>
the 2x2, you won&#x27;t have parity, but you might have to swap 2 pieces if <br>
you want to get there, which will still require some ugly long <br>
algorithm (unless you do centres last or something).<br>
<br>
Third, it kinda looks like Ryan is backing up Bernett, saying you <br>
won&#x27;t have the parity as it occurs when you make a pseudo 3x3.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; The parity problem in &quot;big cubes&quot; refers specifically to the problem <br>
of<br>
&gt; joining pieces together and &quot;not knowing&quot; if you&#x27;re doing it with odd<br>
&gt; (incorrect) parity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, here is where the confusion probably is. I think Per does not look <br>
at &#x27;parity problem&#x27; this way. I think Per has a more &#x27;pure&#x27; definition <br>
of &#x27;parity problem&#x27;, and for him &#x27;parity problem&#x27; is just having to <br>
swap two pieces... A situation that can also occur when you want to <br>
make 8 2x2x2 blocks on the 4x4.<br>
<br>
Am I right Per?<br>

What do you mean you &quot;don&#x27;t need&quot; the dollar sign? Is saying &quot;.02 
cents&quot; equivalent to saying &quot;$0.02&quot; ?

          <div class="email-content">Of course not -- .02 cents is totally different than .02 dollars. 
They are different units of measurement.  If someone is trying to say
&quot;That&#x27;s just my two cents&quot; then they could either say &quot;2 cents&quot; or
&quot;.02 dollars&quot; or whatever, but &quot;.02 cents&quot; is... eh, not a whole lot
in terms of, equivalent thought-mass? Idk.

Yeah I know, I had already read the Verizon story (thanks Shelley for 
the link), at least the first 20-30 minutes of it. If I weren&#x27;t aware 
of humankind&#x27;s very real stupidity, I&#x27;d bet it was a fake so he could 
sell those tshirts. Unbelievable those people got jobs in a 
technology business.

Reminded me of something similar, a butchery chain here quite often 
instead of for example 6.49 EUR/KG they wrote 6.49 KG/EUR and when I 
told them about it they just weren&#x27;t able to grasp what the problem 
is. I really should&#x27;ve asked them to give me 649 grams and then give 
them 0.10 EUR. I really should&#x27;ve. Oh how I regret not having done it.

Cheers!
Stefan

  Well .02 cents is different from .02 dollars. I mean if I said .02
  gallons it would mean two-hundredths of a gallon, and so .02 cents is
  two hundredths of a cent, whereas two cents is two hundreds of a dollar.

Good, someone read it :-)<br>
<br>
In that message, I tried to get people to say precisely what they mean<br>
by &#x27;parity&#x27;.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately it was to no avail. People are still throwing around the<br>
word &#x27;parity&#x27; when they might mean something else.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; it might be better to explicitly abolish the word &quot;problem&quot; <br>
&gt; completely. Just talk about even or odd parity maybe?<br>
<br>
I understand that you want to avoid words that don&#x27;t have a clear<br>
scientific meaning, however this word is extensively used in scientific<br>
and mathematical papers to describe a situation that is difficult to<br>
overcome, or a question that is difficult to answer. (Of course, people<br>
can disagree about degrees of difficulty, but the word is useful to<br>
express the author&#x27;s motivations. It is still the author&#x27;s<br>
responsibility to convince the readers that it is a problem that&#x27;s<br>
interesting to them, also.)<br>
<br>
In our field, may I suggest that<br>
<br>
- &#x27;parity&#x27; just refers to the odd/even state of something, whereas<br>
- &#x27;parity problem&#x27; refers to a situation that is difficult to overcome,<br>
  related to parity.<br>
<br>
This makes it rather useless to say things like:<br>
<br>
    &quot;You can&#x27;t avoid parity&quot;<br>
    &quot;You can&#x27;t avoid odd parity&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course you can&#x27;t avoid these because parity always exists, and it<br>
frequently alternates between odd and even, all the time while you&#x27;re<br>
solving.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s why when people are throwing around the word &#x27;parity&#x27;, I really<br>
think they might mean something else, and they should be clear what they<br>
mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
Message 32723 describes a number of &#x27;parity problems&#x27; rather than<br>
describing a number of &#x27;parities&#x27;.<br>
<br>
For example, the problem of not being able to determine the parity of<br>
the 4x4x4 centre pieces just by looking at them, is a problem, not a<br>
parity.<br>
<br>
Whereas, the odd/even status of the edge permutation is a kind of<br>
parity, not a parity problem.<br>

  Of course :-). Btw, congrats for posting message #32768. Nice 
  milestone.

We can interpret Bernett&#x27;s question the way we like.<br>
Ryan takes the more scientific way.<br>
I am thinking of a method that is very suitable for speed solving AND that does not require an extra 5 second step 50 percent of the time.<br>

I tried one approach. It didn&#x27;t help much. Neither did Ryan&#x27;s approach for me.<br>
Bottomline for me is that I did not find a good new method.<br>

  In that message, I tried to get people to say precisely what they mean<br>
  by &#x27;parity&#x27;.<br>
<br>
  Unfortunately it was to no avail. People are still throwing around the<br>
  word &#x27;parity&#x27; when they might mean something else.<br>
<br>
  &gt; it might be better to explicitly abolish the word &quot;problem&quot; <br>
  &gt; completely. Just talk about even or odd parity maybe?<br>
<br>
  I understand that you want to avoid words that don&#x27;t have a clear<br>
  scientific meaning, however this word is extensively used in scientific<br>
  and mathematical papers to describe a situation that is difficult to<br>
  overcome, or a question that is difficult to answer. (Of course, people<br>
  can disagree about degrees of difficulty, but the word is useful to<br>
  express the author&#x27;s motivations. It is still the author&#x27;s<br>
  responsibility to convince the readers that it is a problem that&#x27;s<br>
  interesting to them, also.)<br>
<br>
  In our field, may I suggest that<br>
<br>
  - &#x27;parity&#x27; just refers to the odd/even state of something, whereas<br>
  - &#x27;parity problem&#x27; refers to a situation that is difficult to overcome,<br>
  related to parity.<br>
<br>
  This makes it rather useless to say things like:<br>
<br>
  &quot;You can&#x27;t avoid parity&quot;<br>
  &quot;You can&#x27;t avoid odd parity&quot;<br>
<br>
  Of course you can&#x27;t avoid these because parity always exists, and it<br>
  frequently alternates between odd and even, all the time while you&#x27;re<br>
  solving.<br>
<br>
  That&#x27;s why when people are throwing around the word &#x27;parity&#x27;, I really<br>
  think they might mean something else, and they should be clear what they<br>
  mean.<br>
<br>
  Message 32723 describes a number of &#x27;parity problems&#x27; rather than<br>
  describing a number of &#x27;parities&#x27;.<br>
<br>
  For example, the problem of not being able to determine the parity of<br>
  the 4x4x4 centre pieces just by looking at them, is a problem, not a<br>
  parity.<br>
<br>
  Whereas, the odd/even status of the edge permutation is a kind of<br>
  parity, not a parity problem.<br>

Do you have a &quot;quick&#x27;n dirty&quot; solution to running several inputs to 
ACube also? Preferably having all output/input in same file/s? I 
guess this may be easier in xnix/bash than poor old dos/win-
commandprompt ...

-Per

Would there be any interest in an application taking a sequence of 
cube turns and turning it into ACube input? This will save time for 
people using ACube to search for algorithms :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan,<br>
<br>
&gt; Let me describe a strategy that works:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - First attach all the edges to the corners.<br>
&gt; - Second, attach the centres to the corners.<br>
&gt; - Third, solve as a 2x2x2.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Now, let me describe which parity problems this avoids:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - It avoids the pseudo parity problems.<br>
&gt; - It avoids the indeterminate centre permutation parity problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, you are right when you do the centers last... But that is quite <br>
similar to Per&#x27;s cage method I&#x27;d say. Only then you do it with <br>
messed up corners, joining the edges with their corners...<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Now, let me explain why I entered this conversation:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - Because I saw an idea being shot down on false grounds, and I <br>
wanted<br>
&gt;   to set the record straight so that people could open their minds <br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, it&#x27;s possible to alter the alg in many ways because of the 
symmetry in the case. I myself does as I wrote it but mirrored in L 
(I&#x27;m a lefthand cuber). 

One little improvment is: the R2-move can be done as l+R. That will 
put the B-side at top before the last part of the alg and you can 
continue from there doing U M&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U M

// Kenneth

P.S Maybe you gys like my H-alg, It&#x27;s a bit crazy but most 
triggerable because it uses only Q-turns (18 of them) : F U R d&#x27; R U&#x27; 
R&#x27; d R&#x27; U R d&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; d R&#x27; F&#x27;  or F 2x(U R d&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; d R&#x27;) F&#x27;

Double Sune and a U-PLL does the same job, guess that is faster ;-)

Well yeah, just write all inputs into the in.txt file I suggested. 
Though I&#x27;d not call that &quot;dirty&quot;.

A while back Josef started work on different input syntaxes, I did 
one where you could for example say (UF,UR)(UFR,URB). Don&#x27;t know the 
current status, though, he seems busy with other stuff.

Cheers!

<br>
There has been an overwhelmingly negative response to J.Bernett&#x27;s idea<br>
of a 2x2x2 reduction to avoid parity problems.<br>
<br>
- Per said it was impossible.<br>
- Gilles agreed and said it was impossible(*)<br>
- Ron said it was a bad idea.<br>
- (*) Gilles then changed is mind and saw that it was possible.<br>
<br>
Now I think I have managed to convince a few people that the idea is<br>
possible. But, J.Bernett&#x27;s question still remains unanswered!<br>

&quot;Is there a good way to implement this method?&quot;<br>

realised it is quite unpractical as well.<br>
<br>
I do realise that it&#x27;s a good idea to think about different methods. <br>
Even crazy methods or ideas can even lead to new, better ideas. I <br>
for example, got an idea during trying to make a 2x2... When I had a <br>
2x2x2 block, I extended it to a 3x3x3 block, so would only have to <br>
look at one side during the rest of the solve. I wouldn&#x27;t have have <br>
tried that if Bernett didn&#x27;t post his idea.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan,<br>
<br>
If you quote me then please quote me correctly. I never said it was a bad idea.<br>
In two different messages I said that the approaches taken were not suitable for my interpretation of the question.<br>
1) by making the 2x2 blocks block-by-block (my first try)<br>
2) by swapping two edge pieces and two centers (your suggestion)<br>
<br>
There may be other approaches that are better and suit my interpretation of the question.<br>
But the way you communicate I am not interested in a discussion with you.<br>
So I will do the investigations myself at home, and if I find something I will publish it to this group.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Are you tired of the same old thing over and over again?  Probably not.<br>
Most of us are here because we don&#x27;t mind spinning that Rubik&#x27;s Cube,<br>
matching up the colors on every side, over, and over again, and quite<br>
quickly might I add.<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t get my wrong, online competition are fabulous.  They&#x27;re a great way to<br>
keep us motivated, but I&#x27;m not a very fast speed cuber by today&#x27;s standards,<br>
and I&#x27;d like a chance to win &#x27;something&#x27; every week.  Whether it&#x27;s flipping<br>
burgers, or underwater basket weaving, I&#x27;d like to have a chance to see my<br>
name at the top of a list.  After all, not all of us are blessed with sub-13<br>
averages.<br>
<br>
Just an idea... we&#x27;ve been having a lot of fun with our Caltech Mystery<br>
Puzzle at our competitions.  Such classics such as &quot;Name That Dzoan&quot;<br>
(similar to &#x27;Name That Tune,&#x27; but with a Dzoan) will certainly stand the<br>
test of time as one of the most epic competitions ever.  Why not make this<br>
into an online competition?<br>
<br>
I still hold the world record for Ball in Cup I believe at 0.39 seconds.<br>
I&#x27;m quite proud because this record was achieved using a method that I had<br>
developed.  Anyway, stay tuned.  The online mystery puzzle competition<br>
awaits you!<br>

No... Anssi meant that it&#x27;s funny to see how different people react
when they do world records.

Ok, every edge/center swap is a &quot;parity-fix&quot; so of course you avoid 
the problem that way. Cunning ... but slooow.

I, like Ron, consider this from a speedsolving perspective. Don&#x27;t 
tell me that ur proposed method can be fast. I&#x27;m  not gonna believe 
you.

We need much better ways of eliminating or reducing parity-fix to 
something trivial - like for instance my suggested 2-opposite layers 
first, then diffuse middle edges - strategy. Honestly i think such a 
method is speed-feasible whileas urs is not. But hey it&#x27;s only my 
strong belief!! Nothing more :-)

It&#x27;s kinda weird, he doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;profile&quot; on speedcubing.com at
all...I&#x27;d thought that any faster/experienced cuber would know of the
site called speedcubing.com! Meh...then again, Gungz wasn&#x27;t on the

          <div class="email-content">Haha.  Dude, I can&#x27;t believe I owned that pound of apple sauce.  Chris
Krueger and Dan Dzoan are doing stuff for me right now.  Can you do the
following for me:

Rubik&#x27;s Cube competition history in Europe
Rubik&#x27;s Cube competition history in Asia

Actually, I just noticed this was sent to speedsolving Rubik&#x27;s, and not my
personal e-mail.  Anyway, maybe other people can chip in on this one too.
I&#x27;m looking for basically something that details the history and current
state of competition development in the individual countries in Europe and
Asia as well as a little bit about the perspective of the cubing development
in Europe and Asia as continents.

Things to look at are France, The UK, The Netherlands (Dutch Cube Days,
Dutch Cube Championships), the Japaneses tournaments, the formation of the
KRCR (Korea), the organizatino of the Taiwanese National Championships, and
also the cube development in the Scandinavia region.

The idea is to write a document to show a non-cube person (with money) that
cubing is developing and on the rise, and that it can really take off.  Talk
about what the various countries have been doing to get organized, and how
that&#x27;s developing.  The rise of immensly fast cubers in Korea is definitely
something that probably should be included.

We want to show investors that there is an international market for Rubik&#x27;s
Cube as well.

I could use some help. I&#x27;m one person, and unfortunately, I have a full

In short, I need to create a document, an information pact that details the
history of Rubik&#x27;s Cube competitions. I need help writing the individual
sections, detailing from how these competitions started, what they are now,
their procedures, and their trends. In other words, when are US Nationals
held, how do they relate to the World Championships, etc.

I will work on an outline of this document right now, but I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t
be able to write this entire document myself. Please send me an e-mail if
you can write a section or two.

There&#x27;s a large meeting, and I&#x27;ve got some people who want to some pretty
amazing things for the Rubik&#x27;s Cube competition scene. There are already
talks with ESPN, but the person I&#x27;m working with needs information about
competitions.

Let me know! My deadline is Wednesday night.

You justed answered some on my questions on AIM, so I&#x27;d be more than happy
to help you. I don&#x27;t have school much this week, so I can help you. I don&#x27;t
know much about the competetions, but if you would direct to a webssite that
has the information on it or tell me yourself, I&#x27;d be happy to help you type
some up. Whatever I can do to make cubing bigger and better.

          <div class="email-content">Frank, thanks for your help.  Could you do these for me:

Early Rubik&#x27;s Cube Competitions - WC 1982, WC 2003
Cubing performance between 1982 and 2003 (Dan Knights and 20.00 average)

Caltech Rubik&#x27;s Cube Club 2004 Competitions
Cubing performance, rise of Shotaro Makisumi

The idea is to illustrate to a non-cuber the incredible development of
cubing performances.  Remember when Macky started competiting, he was miles
above everyone else.  We want to show a non-cuber that people these days are
now awesome.  (And that they should give us money.)

&gt;<br>
&gt; of course you avoid the problem that way. Cunning ... but slooow.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Per :-)<br>
<br>
This is all that I was arguing.<br>
<br>
I do respect you for realising that his basic idea is now possible, and<br>
all along I have thought this was an important first step for everyone<br>
to recognise. Finding faster methods that aren&#x27;t &quot;slooow&quot; is the next<br>
step :-)<br>
<br>
I think it is only fair that someone defend J.Bernett&#x27;s idea, since<br>
after all, his idea turned out to be correct. It really is a difficult<br>
position to be in, however, when you are the ONLY person defending it.<br>
It is sad that not one other person was willing to stand up and say<br>
&quot;Maybe J.Bernett&#x27;s idea is possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe it has been entertaining to some people to watch me fight it alone<br>
:-) Well, yes even I find debates entertaining to watch sometimes.<br>
<br>
At the same time, they are also painful to others. I&#x27;m sure you will<br>
notice that this one had exclamation marks a-plenty being thrown around.<br>
<br>
To Per, I did feel rubbed up the wrong way by some of your comments such<br>
as &quot;Why is it so hard to admit ???&quot; because I had already stated earlier<br>
the very thing you were asking me to admit. I felt like you were not<br>
really reading my emails carefully enough. Emails that I had invested a<br>
lot of time into.<br>
<br>
To Gilles, I want to just make it clear that, although you disagreed<br>
with me, I felt you did it in a very respectable way. And thanks for<br>
finally agreeing with me :-) (And sorry for not getting back to you<br>
about the wings 3-cycle thing, I am trying to find out what that means,<br>
but don&#x27;t know, yet).<br>

Anyway, just send me an email (look in the One-Handed unofficial records to

Good luck !

          <div class="email-content">Hey don&#x27;t worry Ryan.
Everything is fine. :-)

A wing is actually the name given in a method for the 5x5 to the
&quot;non-central-edges&quot; (to be concrete : UrF and UlF are &quot;wings&quot;).
Now you can apply the word wing to describe the UrF and UlF on the 4x4 too !
So that the word edge can be preserved and used as the &quot;group of 2 wings&quot;,
which makes an edge if you look at the 4x4 in a 3x3 way.

I hope this is understandable. :p
I think it&#x27;s just a nice and convenient word to talk about those pieces.

Hmmm ... (UF,UR)(UFR,URB) ... Just give the cyclical decomposition. 
Interesting. But wouldn&#x27;t you still have to convert that to the old 
input format? (specifying all 20 cubies)??

The optimal i guess would be a java GUI frontend with a cube &quot;applet&quot; 
built into it, and of course also ACube as the backend-engine. And 
with several input-options. Would need a &quot;middle layer&quot; which 
converts some new input format to the old one.

It would also be interesting to lift some of the restrictions of 
ACube. Like if it has already found a x-turn solution, sometimes 
worse solution may still be interesting. But they will get lost with 
current implementation. Also the &quot;all&quot; search should be an option at 
runtime, not only on start-up ;-)

I didn&#x27;t know that Josef was still working on it. Hope he reads the 
forum :-)

I confirm that. You&#x27;re in my eyes the most traveling cuber, having 
competed in eight different countries despite just nine competitions. 
Only Ron and Ton have competed in more (nine) countries and they&#x27;ve 
been in more than twice as many competitions.

It&#x27;s one of the things I&#x27;ve noticed from my fun stats I&#x27;m working on. 
Oh hey, who can guess which competition drew competitors from the 
most countries? (I realize it&#x27;s an awkward sentence, improve it if 
you can.)

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes, writing code for the conversion is what I did. If I remember 
correctly, I had finished it, but I don&#x27;t know whether he already 
integrated it.

Ugh. GUI. I prefer text. GUI is for kids.

Nope, it only had competitors from eight different countries, that&#x27;s 
a shared 9th place. But for having only 19 competitors, eight 
countries isn&#x27;t bad.

I still have to go to Italy, Japan, Taïwan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,

It&#x27;s probably easier to hold this record if you live in Europe.  In  
California, you can drive for 6 hours, and you&#x27;ve merely gone from San

Yep, that&#x27;s it, followed by WC2005 with 17 and Euro2006 with 16. So 
in a sense, cubing *still* isn&#x27;t as big as it was in the early 1980s.

IMHO 2x2x2 reduction is still a STUPID idea for 4x4x4 speeding. But 
as agreed, theoretically doable (naturally). A cube can of course be 
transformed from one valid random position to another legal position 
with valid/legal turns  only :-P

For me...

learning F2L intuitively took less than an hour...
learning a 4-look LL took two days to memorize the algorithms...
learning a 3-look LL took a week to memorize the algorithms...

basically, just memorize several new algorithms every day, and maybe
take the weekend off by just reviewing what you have memorized so far.
trying to learn too many algorithms in too short a time period is not
very good.

          <div class="email-content">3-look LL means solving the last layer in 3 steps. 4-look is solving<br>
it in 4 steps.<br>
<br>
Full Fridrich involves learning F2L (completing the first two layers<br>

73 algorithms (53 OLL + 21 PLL.) OLL being orienting the edges...and<br>
PLL being permutating the last layer. <br>
<br>
A 3-look LL usually involves learning all of the PLL algorithms, and 8<br>
of the OLL algorithms. This comes to a total of around 30 algorithms.<br>
<br>
A 4-look LL involves memorizing about 8 of the PLL algorithms, and 8<br>
of the OLL algorithms.  <br>

 It sounds like it could be Guimond, which is written up

To me, it is easier to learn the secrets behind how the cube works.<br>

F2L uses a table of 22 algorithms, but almost all of those are derived<br>
from two basic tricks, described in point (1) on this page:<br>

Bear with me here. I&#x27;ve been working on 4x4x4 methods recently. It&#x27;s a<br>
wall of text, but I might make some useful points...<br>
<br>
I think that virtually any 4x4x4 solution is possible, if you plan out<br>
your method enough. For example, you could reduce it to a 3x3x4, then<br>
reduce that to a 3x3x2, and solve it like a Domino.<br>
<br>
But how do you tell if a certain method can ever be fast? There are<br>
two factors, move count and lookahead. If you have a total of 60<br>
seconds of lookahead, there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re getting sub 1:30.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if any of you have ever solved the Alexander Star, but<br>
I&#x27;ve been working on speedsolving it, and the lookahead is awful. For<br>
all of you Megaminx solvers, since the Alexander Star is<br>
mathematically equivalent to the Megaminx edges, do you think you<br>
could solve the Alexander Star in under 60 seconds, if it was lubed as<br>
well as your Megaminx? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really possible because<br>
lookahead is so terrible. On the Alexander Star, since the solved<br>
state is so hard to identify, it&#x27;s very difficult to see what you&#x27;ve<br>
already done, so when you&#x27;re looking for a new piece it&#x27;s easy to<br>
forget where you want to put it by the time you&#x27;ve found it. No matter<br>
how well it&#x27;s lubricated, you need almost zero recognition time to<br>
solve that quickly, and it&#x27;s simply not going to happen on that puzzle.<br>
<br>
I think it&#x27;s going to be the same way with the 4x4x4 -&gt; 2x2x2<br>
approach. Even if it can be done in an average of, say, 120 moves (of<br>
which 85% is the pairing up stage), you&#x27;re not likely to be able to do<br>
2 moves per second when you can barely see what you&#x27;re doing. Try<br>
this: scramble a 4x4x4 like a 2x2x2, then like a 3x3x3. Now try to<br>
solve the 3x3x3 in under 30 seconds. This is the kind of situation<br>
you&#x27;re going to face, and that is the kind of speed you&#x27;re going to be<br>
looking for.<br>
<br>
Another thing to think about is to compare the 2x2x2 reduction<br>
strategy to a corners-first cage method. In a sample 2x2x2 reduction<br>
method you have the following steps:<br>
- Put edgewings next to their corners.<br>
- Put centers next to their edgewings.<br>
- Solve like 2x2x2.<br>
Whereas in a corners-first cage method you have the following steps:<br>
- Solve corners like 2x2x2.<br>
- Put edgewings next to their corners.<br>
- Put centers next to their edgewings.<br>
I think the comparison between the two methods makes it obvious which<br>
is easier. Notice the steps are just rearranged, so in theory each<br>
method takes the same number of moves. But in the first method, you<br>
have to match up things that are scattered around the cube to other<br>
things that are scattered around the cube. When you&#x27;re doing the<br>
centers, too, center pieces of the same color are scattered around the<br>
cube, so you have a lot less leeway in your cycles. In the second<br>
method, on the other hand, after you&#x27;ve solved the corners it&#x27;s easy<br>
to see where everything goes, and similar pieces are placed next to<br>
each other immediately. They have the same movecount, but the first<br>
has much more recognition time.<br>
<br>
So, while a 2x2x2 reduction method might be interesting, it can not be<br>
efficient for speedcubing. If all you&#x27;re looking for is speed, it<br>
would be much better to learn a corners-first or cage method...<br>

Thats cool but not really what i was looking for. Also the input 
string at the bottom is not in ACube format. For instance twisting 2 
edges (UF and UR) your GUI will say -UF -UR and not FU RU. Or does 
ACube really support that format? I wasn&#x27;t aware of that :-)

What sense does it make to ask us (especially with that little

&gt; the input string at the bottom is not in ACube format.<br>
<br>
Sure it is.<br>
<br>
&gt;From the ACube documentation...<br>
<br>
&gt; For orientation of corners only the first letter of the triple is<br>
&gt; important. So UFR is equivalent of URF but not e.g. FUR.<br>
&gt; You can also precede the double or triple by &#x27;+&#x27;, &#x27;-&#x27;, or &#x27;@&#x27;. It<br>
&gt; affects the orientation of the given cubie in the same way.<br>
<br>
<br>
e.g.<br>
<br>
+UFR is the known piece UFR twisted clockwise<br>
+? is an unknown piece twisted clockwise<br>
<br>
The program logic was much simpler if &#x27;+&#x27; was used for both known and<br>
unknown pieces, and it also happened to be the way I always notated<br>
cubes by hand.<br>

corners, LL corners, FL edges, LL edges and finnaly ML edges. That&#x27;s 
a method that fits the the description pretty well.

the +/- possibilities.

besides im mostly interested in an &quot;ACube-companion&quot; that will 
transform a move sequence to a valid input string. Then one can take 
an algorithm for a method case and use ACube to find more personally 
suitable algs. Ryan i think your page can do that with a little 
modification ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know if this has been tried before (tell me if you invented it<br>
or if you know that someone did), but I&#x27;ve thought of a method for<br>
4x4x4 that&#x27;s related to both Per&#x27;s method and the centers-first method<br>
(and also to a 2x2x2 :P) and I think that if you can find and execute<br>
an edgewing commutator in about three seconds you could probably<br>
average about 1 minute on this method.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s the idea:<br>
1) Solve all centers. Use whatever approach you want. This should take<br>
about 14 seconds on average.<br>
2) Solve all corners, then orient them in relation to the centers. Do<br>
it like a 2x2x2, or 3x3x3 corners. This should take about 6 seconds on<br>
average, or maybe a little less.<br>
3) Solve all edgewings. I use mostly single-piece commutators, but<br>
some 3x3x3 moves if I get a matched pair. For three-cycles, always<br>
solve (at least) two pieces at a time. If you use purely commutators,<br>
you have to find and deal with 12-13 &quot;steps&quot; (three-cycles, pairs of<br>
transpositions, or a parity step). If you can do each in about 3<br>
seconds this will take you 40 seconds. Commutators may not even be the<br>
best strategy here.<br>
<br>
I know that anyone used to corners-first will (at first) have a<br>
difficult time trying to find the three-cycles, but after a while<br>
finding them and setting them up will be easy. If you already use a<br>
method that uses commutators (Per? Kirjava?) this will probably be<br>
pretty easy for you, and if you are good at 4x4x4 blindfold (Chris?<br>
Mátyás? Marcus?) you just have to get used to seeing what you&#x27;re doing<br>
 :).<br>
<br>
You may not like the 2x2x2, you may not like me, but if you have an<br>
extra ten minutes try solving a 4x4x4 like this a few times. I don&#x27;t<br>
know if you&#x27;ll like it, but, as they say, there&#x27;s only one way to find<br>
out!<br>

<br>
As some of you may remember, we were talking about questions and<br>
statements we hate to hear a little while ago.  I have a new one for<br>
the list.  &quot;Do you need some kind of drug to do that?&quot;  At first, I<br>
didn&#x27;t hear him (I was listening to my iPod)  &quot;What?&quot; I asked.  He<br>
repeated himself.  Stunned, I simply answered &quot;No&quot; and kept on solving<br>
with my iPod on so I didn&#x27;t have to listen to questions like that<br>
again.  I think listening to music is the second best defense to these<br>
questions.  It tells people that you&#x27;re not going to hear their<br>
questions so why bother.  The best defense is probably telling them to<br>
#%$@ off with less colorful language, but sometimes... *sigh* (I have<br>
yet to resort to this and probably never will, but I am often tempted<br>
to try).  Anyway, that&#x27;s my two cents.<br>

Of course, I could add twists, if it were *really* that important, (when<br>

  Hey guys!

  I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of videos of speed cubers and I see a lot of
  them use this program on their PC(or MAC) that when they press the
  space bar the time starts and when they press it again the time stops.
  It can be seen in this video: http://4none.goodmeet.net/909-tt/615&lt;http://4none.goodmeet.net/909-tt/615> 
  So if any could tell me the name of this program or give me the link

  o, and is it speedcubber or speedcuber or speed cubber or speed cuber?

That slide puzzle must be one level from the computer Klotski 
game. &quot;Blocks&quot; is also very similar but has many game-elements that 
do not make it into a real-life puzzle ;-) Like magnets and black-
holes ... I saw a guy with such a puzzle in Paris during EC 2005. 
Cannot recall who that was, i think it was a swede :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Kenneth,

Can you ask your brother if he also had a manual with instructions or 
setup-positions?

I really love the puzzle. It is very hard to solve it, but not 
impossible. A lot of people will get it after sliding for 10/15 
minutes. (Allthough a guy I know who is very good in puzzles had it 
in like, 3 minutes.. It took me a lot longer the first time..)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per!!

Thanks a lot for the name &#x27;Klotski&#x27;.. That was KEY :).

I think quite a few cubers in this group might want to try. In case 
ppl want to play the original setup, you can try this JAVA applet:

http://www.puzzleworld.org/SlidingBlockPuzzles/sqroot.htm

There are also different setup positions. This is a hard one:

http://www.puzzleworld.org/SlidingBlockPuzzles/superc.htm

Or you can choose from any of these:

http://www.puzzleworld.org/SlidingBlockPuzzles/4x5.htm

Hope you guys like this stuff ;)

          <div class="email-content">Huh? What do you mean? He gave very little information, fitting even 
a lot of published methods (not to mention the infinite amount of non-
published ones), and caused several people to guess what it could be. 
Even if someone guesses correctly, how could he/we verify? He has to 
ask his scoutmaster anyway. Why waste everybody&#x27;s time with a useless 
guessing game and not simply ask his scoutmaster directly?

Please notice that my comments like these are always an attempt to 
improve communication quality and make the world a better place. 
Maybe that&#x27;s hormonal.

          <div class="email-content">Lack of videos could be explained by lack of money for a video camera 
or lack of motivation to make videos.

Lack of similar competition times can be explained by 1) the much 
higher number of attempts in practice compared with competitions and 
2) nervousness etc caused by the competition environment. Ron for 
example needed quite a few competitions to get times like he can 
regularly do in relaxed practice or even moments before or after his 
official attempts.

Also, I think even for Yu Jeong-Min his 11.76 is an exception. His 
record average of 100 is 13.52 so his 13.40 average in the final 
competition round is what should be expected.

Simply don&#x27;t take the unoffical results seriously. The official 
results are what counts. Thibaut for example reported an 11.63 
average-of-100 but in my eyes Yu Jeong-Min is much better simply 
because he performs when it really matters.

Cheers!
Stefan

he also had a 13.19 on 102 cubes, using DIY http://4none.goodmeet.net/909-tt/644 (that I imagine is not his usual cube)

I could make a video of a full average as well, but I don&#x27;t think many people would be interested on watching a 15-16 avg video...

 Lack of similar competition times can be explained by 1) the much 
 higher number of attempts in practice compared with competitions and 
 2) nervousness etc caused by the competition environment. Ron for 
 example needed quite a few competitions to get times like he can 
 regularly do in relaxed practice or even moments before or after his 
 official attempts.
 
 Also, I think even for Yu Jeong-Min his 11.76 is an exception. His 
 record average of 100 is 13.52 so his 13.40 average in the final 
 competition round is what should be expected.
 
 Simply don&#x27;t take the unoffical results seriously. The official 
 results are what counts. Thibaut for example reported an 11.63 
 average-of-100 but in my eyes Yu Jeong-Min is much better simply 
 because he performs when it really matters.

Noone is demanding that you IMMEDIATELY fulfill any/every suggestion;-
) 

No it&#x27;s not urgent as such. I will make my own application that 
transforms a sequence of moves into an ACube input string format, 
possibly including layer-restrictions. 

As part of this i will implement a good &quot;sequence purifier&quot; that will 
allow say : D U&#x27;&#x27;nonsense 2 F2D&#x27; and convert that to a series of 
valid tokens, in this case : D U&#x27; F2 D&#x27;. This part is already coded 
and was easy. I may add conersion of repetitions (....)*n and 
commutators [P.Q]= PQPQ&#x27; to &quot;linear&quot; format later ... and nested 
versions of all these so it would transform for instance : [F R 
D&#x27;[L,B],U F2 (RDB)*2] to :
F R D&#x27; L B L&#x27; B&#x27;. U F2 R D B R D B2 L B&#x27; L&#x27; D R&#x27; F&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; 
F2 U&#x27; (correct afaik)(note that a B B was converted to B2!!)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan, and everyone,

As one of the moderators I can try to clarify how I approach what I 
use as my own personal posting guidelines if that helps.  I looked at 
the settings of this group and I don&#x27;t really see anything that e-
mails a set message to all newly registered members.  As an 
alternative maybe we could compile any guidelines about posting ideas 
into a file and put it in the files section?

As far as how I approach posting guidelines I always and without fail 
delete posts that:
1) Are empty
2) Are solely sexual or religious in nature
3) Are selling or advertising a good or service or thing not related 
to cubing in any way
4) Are so deragatory or mean as to offend my sensibilities, and I do 
try to be lenient here

I also delete files that are solely sexual or religious in nature, and 
would do so to any files I noticed that had no or extremely limited 
content (basically like an empty post).  I do this in order to free up 
room for people who want to post files more related to our group 
discussion.

I view this group more as an ongoing conversation, and I try as hard 
as possible not to interupt that conversation.  Again I can&#x27;t speak 
for Ron or Doug, but those are the limitations I give myself for 
deleting any content in this group.  Otherwise I let things carry on 
as they carry on and I try not to interupt.

As far as off topic posts go I think they contribute wonderfully as 
long as they satisfy a couple of ground rules:

1) They need not be totally cube related.  Loosely cube related 
material is always allowed unless it is used to try to let slip by a 
post that is basically just a post as I described above from the list 
of posts I always delete. 

2) Posts completely unrelated to cubing are also allowed as long as 
they are marked off topic and as long as the material in the post is 
interesting to enough people as to warrant it being a side 
conversation within this larger conversation.  Only if a large number 
of people request for an off topic post to be deleted would I actually 
delete it though.

Anyway that&#x27;s how I approach posts on this group.

Hope this helps, let me know if there is anything else I can answer or 
if I didn&#x27;t fully answer your question or get your meaning.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">i can understand not everyone has access to video cameras, but in this world of technology i&#x27;m sure everyone knows someone that has a camera they can use, i know if i was doing sub 13 averages of 100, i&#x27;d find a camera, and be motivated to share what my very hard work had accomplished.

i can appreciate that the best work is done at home, i am no exception to that, but i don&#x27;t do 16 averages at home then come in to comps and do 22 averages.  i  don&#x27;t see how the competition pressure could be such a huge difference.  ron does great at most competitions, and more importantly he doesn&#x27;t say that at home he has 11 second averages, he conveys his skill very accurately and has a lot of documentation to back it up.  same with yjm, he had numerous amazing sunday contest videos, then when the time came he walked into a competition and wiped the floor, first comp ever and a sub 12 average.

using the example you did, how can i possible be expected to believe those averages from thibaut. average of 12 was 11.63 and average of 100 12.5.... when i look at competition times, he has had 23 total solves, only 3 are sub 15, how can your times be nearly 25% worse in competitions?  also, 7.56 f2l average...first that sounds pretty low for a cuber that has usually averaged well over 15 seconds in comps, second how do you stop to take time when doing all these amazing solves to note each f2l time?  i hate to say it but i don&#x27;t believe it and i think it takes away from people like yjm that are actually able to do it.  it really does a discourtesy to misrepresent yourself to other cubers since its makes the difficult seem easy, or the impossible seem possible.

unofficial records are a joke because these little embellishments get out of hand and people claim crazy things. i think its kind of lost it purpose as a gauge of at home performances, which is why i don&#x27;t have any unofficial records, except for things that dont&#x27; happen at competitions like supercubes and relays.  i like the idea and its a great part of speedcubing.com, but i think it has lost some of its value because of things like this.

<br>
These are good, although I didn&#x27;t necessarily mean things your post<br>
might get deleted for, but just guidelines to help promote healthy<br>
threads.<br>
<br>
Some of the more interesting guidelines from:<br>
<br>
    http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1855.html<br>
<br>
- Mail should have a subject heading which reflects the content of the<br>
  message.<br>
<br>
- Use mixed case.  UPPER CASE LOOKS AS IF YOU&#x27;RE SHOUTING.<br>
<br>
- Read all of a discussion in progress (we call this a thread) before<br>
  posting replies.  Avoid posting &quot;Me Too&quot; messages, where content is<br>
  limited to agreement with previous posts.  Content of a follow-up post<br>
  should exceed quoted content.<br>
<br>
- If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you<br>
  summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just<br>
  enough text of the original to give a context.  This will make sure<br>
  readers understand when they start to read your response.  Since<br>
  NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the postings from<br>
  one host to another, it is possible to see a response to a message<br>
  before seeing the original.  Giving context helps everyone.  But do<br>
  not include the entire original!<br>
<br>
- Read both mailing lists and newsgroups for one to two months before<br>
  you post anything.  This helps you to get an understanding of the<br>
  culture of the group.<br>
<br>
- If you are caught in an argument, keep the discussion focused on<br>
  issues rather than the personalities involved.<br>
<br>
- &quot;Reasonable&quot; expectations for conduct via e-mail depend on your<br>
  relationship to a person and the context of the communication.  Norms<br>
  learned in a particular e-mail environment may not apply in general to<br>
  your e-mail communication with people across the Internet.  Be careful<br>
  with slang or local acronyms.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I finally did an update to my website http://www.vanderblonk.com. I <br>
made a 10 min. video about speedcubing and I&#x27;d like to know what you <br>
think (it&#x27;s not for speedcubers, more for beginners). I know it&#x27;s in WMV <br>
and I&#x27;ll try to get a Flash or Mpg version there.<br>
<br>
Also some of you might know my animated applet page, where you can <br>
demonstrate algs. (to see it just click the &quot;animated applet&quot; button on <br>
the page). I improved it and it has a lot more options now, most notably <br>
you can add any parameter the applet understands in the url.<br>
<br>
Some of the options are:<br>
- change applet by adding e.g. &amp;applettype=petrus to the url<br>
- 4x4 and 5x5 applet, by adding &amp;cubesize=4 or &amp;cubesize=5<br>
- stickers, this one I like in particular, e.g. http://vanderblonk.com/cube/<br>
cubeapplet.asp?alg=UF&#x27;U&#x27;FU&#x27;RUR&#x27;&amp;stickers=f2l<br>
<br>
And of course if you have a website with algorithms you can insert a link <br>
to the applet page that demonstrates your algorithm.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll add more features soon.<br>
<br>
have fun!<br>

I don&#x27;t have a camera, but I also don&#x27;t have under 13 seconds averages. If I
was that good, i I would ask one of my friends to use their camera. Its not
that every time people should upload videos, but one video at least shows

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I have updated my site: http://www.vanderblonk.com. I added a video<br>
introduction to speedcubing. Let me know what you think. I am working<br>
on converting it to Flash or MPG, as I know not everyone will be able<br>
to view the WMV movie.<br>
<br>
I also know a lot of people have been using my cubeapplet page with<br>
the configurable RubikPlayer, so I decided to improve that one as<br>
well. Just click on &quot;Animated Cube&quot; on the page to see it, and you<br>
might recognize it.<br>
<br>
I now changed the page to not only be able to take the &#x27;alg&#x27; parameter<br>
in the url, but any parameter the applet understands. <br>
<br>
Some other possibilities:<br>
- switch applet by adding &amp;applettype=jelinek or &amp;applettype=petrus<br>
- showing algorithms using the Randelshofer 4x4 and 5x5 applet <br>
<br>
Personally I like &amp;stickers=f2l<br>
http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?alg=UF&#x27;U&#x27;FU&#x27;RUR&#x27;&amp;stickers=f2l<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hm, my other reply didn&#x27;t show up from a few hours ago...

Anyway, I agree with you, Clancy. I don&#x27;t post unofficial averages
either, although I did compete in the Sunday Contest quite often
several months ago. As far as competitions go, I do get nervous, like
at the second round of Berkeley Fall. After the first two solves, I
was extremely nervous--on top of normally being somewhat nervous. I
mean, I hit two good times, and I thought something nice might result,
so I was extremely nervous. But I still managed to get decent times
close to my &quot;at home&quot; average--not to say that I was happy with the
times, since I was locking up and losing my grip...

And of course, there&#x27;s one person who should probably come to mind in
terms of honesty in actual performance... a certain young cuber who
showed up to Caltech Winter 2006 and started posting incredibly faster
averages not too long after.

sunday contest videos, then when the time came he walked into a
competition and wiped the floor, first comp ever and a sub 12 average.

solves, only 3 are sub 15, how can your times be nearly 25% worse in
competitions?  also, 7.56 f2l average...first that sounds pretty low
for a cuber that has usually averaged well over 15 seconds in comps,
second how do you stop to take time when doing all these amazing
solves to note each f2l time?  i hate to say it but i don&#x27;t believe it
and i think it takes away from people like yjm that are actually able
to do it.  it really does a discourtesy to misrepresent yourself to
other cubers since its makes the difficult seem easy, or the
impossible seem possible.

  These are good, although I didn&#x27;t necessarily mean things your post<br>
  might get deleted for, but just guidelines to help promote healthy<br>
  threads.<br>
<br>
  Some of the more interesting guidelines from:<br>
<br>
  http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1855.html<br>
<br>
  - Mail should have a subject heading which reflects the content of the<br>
  message.<br>
<br>
  - Use mixed case. UPPER CASE LOOKS AS IF YOU&#x27;RE SHOUTING.<br>
<br>
  - Read all of a discussion in progress (we call this a thread) before<br>
  posting replies. Avoid posting &quot;Me Too&quot; messages, where content is<br>
  limited to agreement with previous posts. Content of a follow-up post<br>
  should exceed quoted content.<br>
<br>
  - If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you<br>
  summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just<br>
  enough text of the original to give a context. This will make sure<br>
  readers understand when they start to read your response. Since<br>
  NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the postings from<br>
  one host to another, it is possible to see a response to a message<br>
  before seeing the original. Giving context helps everyone. But do<br>
  not include the entire original!<br>
<br>
  - Read both mailing lists and newsgroups for one to two months before<br>
  you post anything. This helps you to get an understanding of the<br>
  culture of the group.<br>
<br>
  - If you are caught in an argument, keep the discussion focused on<br>
  issues rather than the personalities involved.<br>
<br>
  - &quot;Reasonable&quot; expectations for conduct via e-mail depend on your<br>
  relationship to a person and the context of the communication. Norms<br>
  learned in a particular e-mail environment may not apply in general to<br>
  your e-mail communication with people across the Internet. Be careful<br>
  with slang or local acronyms.<br>

Hi Chris,

I&#x27;m not quite sure how that would benefit the cause: most people 
wouldn&#x27;t check the file section to find a &quot;guidelines on posting&quot; file 
(unless you edited the home page to instruct them to do so)

Maybe (and I don&#x27;t know how this is done as I&#x27;m not a moderator, but I 
know the caltech group does it) you could require moderator approval to 
join the forum, then when you approve someone email them a pre-written 
set of rules.  This would, though, probably decrease the number of 
people who join, which is not a good thing.  And it would be a large 
time commitment on the moderators&#x27; parts.

So, I&#x27;m working on BLD solving using the method found on macky&#x27;s <br>

positions, permute, and the back out the set-up moves).  Most of the <br>
time however i screw up my moves.  I guess I&#x27;m down to like 3 options: <br>
1. Suck it up and learn how to not get lost.<br>
2. Learn algorithms for more specific cases (I&#x27;m willing to memorize <br>

3. Think about set up moves differently (let me know if anyone has any <br>

          <div class="email-content">If you get lost in a setup, try to remember the pieces you just solved and think about how 
you would have done the setup, rather than just trying to remember what you did. You 
should also try learning the R&#x27;FRF&#x27; cycles, they really help for cases like this. Good luck 
with BLD, it&#x27;s a lot of fun.

Tyson does these cases using (R&#x27;FRF&#x27;)x3 twice. For example, (245) can
be done by something like D-(R&#x27;FRF&#x27;)x3-D2-(L&#x27;BLB&#x27;)x3-D, mod different
directions (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, Tyson).

For (2 4 5), I would use:
Setup: D
Alg: R2 D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; L2 D R2 D&#x27; L2 D2 R2  (11f*)
Undo Setup: D&#x27;

27 turns is just too many turns for me.

This alg can be decomposed into another alg with a setup:

Setup: R2 D&#x27;
Alg2: (R2 D&#x27; L2 D)^2  (8f*)
Undo Setup: D R2

but I just think of it as a separate alg.

I know I&#x27;ve seen Alg2 or a variation of it on someone&#x27;s web site, but
I don&#x27;t recall where.

Well, very fast ~27 moves. I can sub-3 (R&#x27;FRF&#x27;)x3-D2-(R&#x27;FRF&#x27;)x3-D2.
 
I&#x27;ve seen that algorithm before, but isn&#x27;t doing x2 and
R2U&#x27;R2U&#x27;L2UR2U&#x27;L2U2R2 faster?

OK, I just found (RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-l2-(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-l2.

          <div class="email-content">Extending with that last idea, if you learn the following 8, the only
set-up move you&#x27;ll need for these cases (two corners across a diagonal
in either U or D, the third corner in the other layer) is a turn in
either U or D, whichever layer has the lone corner.

(245): [(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-l2]x2      (254): [l2-(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3]x2

Memorizing these should be easy. In addition to the obvious
regularity, note the following:
1) The lone corner is always unmatched with the other two and is in
the L layer.
2) In each pair, doing l2 later (first column) rotates the corners

I think I&#x27;ll switch to this.

 So, I&#x27;m working on BLD solving using the method found on macky&#x27;s 
 site.  Thus far i can do everything right up to corner permutation (i 
 save it for last).  My main problem is i get lost in my set up moves.  
 (ex. cycle: (2 4 5)I would execute U&#x27; L2 D F2 to put them in 2 3 4 
 positions, permute, and the back out the set-up moves).  Most of the 
 time however i screw up my moves.  I guess I&#x27;m down to like 3 options: 
 1. Suck it up and learn how to not get lost.
 2. Learn algorithms for more specific cases (I&#x27;m willing to memorize 
 definitely.
 3. Think about set up moves differently (let me know if anyone has any 
 ideas.
 I appreciate any help... i&#x27;d like to hear what my best option is.  
 I&#x27;ve had many a messed up BLD solve and only one successful, from the 
 start solve.  Thanks!

Yes of course I know inputting a sequence of twists would be fast if you<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

A strange discussion again. Ultimately a GUI with many input options 
is the ideal solution. This would serve:

1) Manual editing like your web-page does already
2) Copy/paste a sequence from some source
3) Manipulate a cube (applet) to get the move sequence

With the following additional advanced options:

- activate the &quot;all-search&quot; runtime, not while starting ACube (this 
requires tweaking Josef&#x27;s (&quot;open&quot;) code.
- select layers restrictions (already supported, but made more human-
friendly)
- option to select only &quot;best solutions&quot; (default) or some threshold 
value or some maximal distance from optimum (again requires tweaking 
ACube code...)

A useful option for many purposes would also be a non-gui application 
where we specify a sequence for the input and everything else is just 
like ACube is now already ...

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Well, I&#x27;m pretty slow executing algs, nowhere near 9 turns/sec! I can
do the optimal FTM alg faster than I can do the 26-turn algs. When I
started BLD solving, I tried to use 26-move algs, but I wasn&#x27;t happy
with them. I found the optimal FTM alg (R2 U R2 U L2 U&#x27; R2 U L2 U2 R2
for (682)) with Cube Explorer.

I like Johannes&#x27; alg ((R2 U R2&#x27; U&#x27; R2) D2 (R2 U R2&#x27; U&#x27; R2) D2) better
than the one I gave, because of its even nicer &quot;structure&quot; (easy to
memorize) and is easier to execute than the optimal FTM alg. Thanks.
So I&#x27;m starting to use that one instead. My thanks to Per, too, for
listing the other algs that do the same thing.

I like to set up  (682), (571), (246), or (135) using U and D layer
turns. The corner that doesn&#x27;t change layers (U/D) is in the front.
The lone corner is aligned with that corner.

Then I do &quot;the alg,&quot; its left/right mirror, its up/down mirror, or its
L/R-U/D double-mirror (depending upon which case is set up, of
course). The first turn moves the side (L/R) where the &quot;front corner&quot;
and &quot;lone corner&quot; are. The 2nd turn moves the layer (U/D) where the
lone corner was. (&quot;The alg&quot; here can be either of those algs listed
above - they start the same way.) This is fairly simple for me. Some
people may prefer using less variations of the alg, or more variations
to handle more of the cases directly. Perhaps, in the future, I will
use front/back mirror variations as well, but I&#x27;ll stick to four until
I get really comfortable with that.

Me too. Thanks, Johannes. Now I&#x27;m thinking of going with just
(731): (R2&#x27;DR2D&#x27;R2-U2)*2 and (375): (R2U&#x27;R2&#x27;UR2-D2&#x27;)*2

I can&#x27;t sub-2 the one you posted though! 2.2 is about the fastest I
managed for any one of these.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have been working on a problem in probability and combinatorics <br>
that was proposed to me by my high school Discrete math teacher.<br>
<br>
Since the problem was proposed to me in class I know the answer <br>
already, but I&#x27;m trying for the first time to actually prove it.<br>
<br>
Here is the setup of the problem, and I&#x27;ve pretty much basically <br>
proved it, but I have a question on the very last step.<br>
<br>
The problem is as follows:<br>
<br>
Given n distinct numbers your task is to find the largest one.  You <br>
may only look at the numbers one at a time, and once you have chosen <br>
the number you believe to be the largest one the game stops and that <br>
number is revealed to either be the largest or not the largest.<br>
<br>
Also you are not allowed to know the magnitude of any of the <br>
numbers.  So out of 10 numbers, the largest one could be the number <br>
10, or it could be the number 400,000,000.<br>
<br>
One example of this game is to have somebody else write n distinct <br>
numbers written on notecards, but you&#x27;re not allowed to see them or <br>
even to know the magnitude of the numbers.  The cards are then <br>
shuffled up.  You then pick cards one at a time.  When you think <br>
you&#x27;ve found the largest number you say so and the game stops.  You <br>
then turn all the cards over and see if the number you picked was <br>
indeed the largest out of all n numbers.<br>
<br>
Here is an example game.<br>
<br>
Let n=5 and my 5 numbers are<br>
<br>
1) -40<br>
2) 25.6<br>
3) -2,761<br>
4) 100,000<br>
5) 57<br>
<br>
Clearly the 100,000 is the largest number, but again I have no idea <br>
of the magnitude of these 5 numbers.<br>
<br>
These numbers are written on notecards and I choose them at random.  <br>
Here is an example of me playing the game where I would choose the <br>
correct number as the largest number.  Say the first number I choose <br>
was the 57.  I would rather see more numbers than think this number <br>
is the largest one.  So I don&#x27;t say anything.  I pick another <br>
number, and say the one I choose is -2,761.  This number is smaller <br>
than 57 so I know this isn&#x27;t the largest number.  I would then <br>
choose to pick another number.  Say the next number I pick is 25.6.  <br>
I would know this number isn&#x27;t larger than 57 so this can&#x27;t be the <br>
largest number.  I then choose to pick another number.  Say the next <br>
one I pick is the 100,000.  I would choose to take this number <br>
because it is the first number larger than the largest one I&#x27;ve seen <br>
so far, the 57.  It turns out that this would be correct.<br>
<br>
Using the same numbers here is an example of a game where I lose and <br>
don&#x27;t choose the correct largest number.<br>
<br>
Say the first number I pick is the -2,761.  I would then choose <br>
another number.  Say the next number I choose is the -40.  I would <br>
again choose to see another number, and say I pick the 57.  It turns <br>
out that I would actually choose the 57, since it is more than the <br>
largest I have seen so far, which is -40.  In this case though, the <br>
largest number is the 100,000 so I have chosen incorrectly and would <br>
be considered to have lost this game.<br>
<br>
What I did to solve this problem was to create a strategy based on <br>
however many numbers, n, that there are.  This is the only piece of <br>
information that I know about the game when I start, because again I <br>
have no idea of the magnitude of any of these numbers.<br>
<br>
If there are n numbers, I have to choose how many I will look at <br>
before I allow myself to choose a number that I think is the largest <br>
number.  If I have 10 numbers, should I let 2 go by to get an idea <br>
of the magnitude, or 3?  This is the strategy I have to find out.<br>
<br>
The way I did this was to consider choosing the cards as an ordered <br>
n-tuple of the positive integers 1 through n.<br>
<br>
The integer 1 here represents the card with the smallest value.  The <br>
integer 2 represents the card with the second smallest value.  The <br>
number n represents the largest number out of the n.<br>
<br>
A choosing game can be represented as an ordered n-tuple of the <br>
numbers 1 through n.<br>
<br>
Even though the rules of the game are that once you choose a number <br>
to be the largest one you stop the game, you have to stretch this a <br>
little for creating an ordered n-tuple.  Let&#x27;s say that after you <br>
choose the largest number, your choice cannot be changed.  But you <br>
do continue turning over cards until you turn over all of them.  <br>
Consider this your check to see if the number you picked was indeed <br>
the largest.<br>
<br>
So the first example game I played could be the ordered 5-tuple <br>
(4,1,3,5,2).  The 4 means I first turned over the 4th largest <br>
number, here the 57.  The 1 means I turned over the -2,761 which is <br>
the smallest number.  And so on for the rest.  In the example I <br>
never actually turned over the -40 card, the final 2 in the 5-<br>
tuple.  But let&#x27;s say I continued even after choosing the 100,000 to <br>
make sure that it was indeed the largest number.  If the card after <br>
the 100,000 turned out to be an even larger number I could not have <br>
chosen it though, my choice of the 100,000 was final.<br>
<br>
The second example game I played could be written as the ordered 5-<br>
tuple (1,2,4,5,3) or it also could have been the game (1,2,4,3,5).  <br>
Since the last two can change after I had chosen the 4th largest <br>
number.  The part of the game that comes after the number you choose <br>
doesn&#x27;t matter, and can take all the possible permutations of the <br>
remaining numbers.<br>
<br>
Anyway what I did was to adopt the following strategy.  First I let <br>
some portion of the n numbers &quot;go by&quot;.  By this I mean that I know I <br>
will never choose a number out of the first group of numbers I look <br>
at.  The strategy I was using in the two example problems I gave was <br>
to let 2 numbers go by.  I knew from the start that I would never <br>
choose a number in that first group of 2, because I still don&#x27;t have <br>
any idea of the magnitude of the numbers.  After the first two have <br>
gone by I remember the largest number I have seen so far.  If I see <br>
a number after the first two that is larger than this largest number <br>
from the first group I pick it no matter what.<br>
<br>
My goal here was to find the odds, given n numbers, of correctly <br>
choosing the largest number by employing this strategy and varying <br>
the number of numbers I let go by from the start.<br>
<br>
So I took n numbers and always let the first one go by.  This gave <br>
me a chance of (1/n)*sumation(i=1 to i=n-1, 1/i) which you can write <br>
as (1/n)*[1+(1/2)+(1/3)+(1/4)+(1/5)+(1/6)+...+(1/n-2)+(1/n-2)].<br>
<br>
For example if there are 100 numbers, then I let n=100 and the odds <br>
are 5.2% that I would indeed choose the largest number.  These odds <br>
aren&#x27;t very good.<br>
<br>
So I looked at the odds, given n numbers of letting 2 go by.  This <br>
chance is (2/n)*sumation(i=2 to i=n-1, 1/i) or written out that&#x27;s<br>
(2/n)*[(1/2)+(1/3)+(1/4)+(1/5)+(1/6)+...+(1/(n-2))+(1/(n-1))]<br>
<br>
And if n=100 the chances are 8.4% to choose the correct largest <br>
number.<br>
<br>
I then looked at the general problem of letting k numbers go by.  <br>
The odds to correctly choose the largest number employing the given <br>
strategy for having n numbers and letting k go by is <br>
(k/n)*sumation(i=k to i=n-1, 1/i) or written out that&#x27;s (k/n)*[(1/k)+<br>
(1/(k+1))+(1/(k+2))+(1/(k+3))+...+(1/(n-2))+(1/(n-1))]<br>
<br>
So now the problem is basically solved except for one part.  Given n <br>
numbers, how many should I let go by?  Now the sad part is I know <br>
the answer, because we did this problem in class.  The answer is to <br>
let n/e of the numbers go by.  Round to the nearest whole number <br>
when you do this division.<br>
<br>
So again it spoils this problem a little bit that I know the <br>
answer.  But I&#x27;d really like to know how to prove it for real.<br>
<br>
This is the part I don&#x27;t know how to do.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve tried doing this:<br>
<br>
limit as n-&gt;infinity of (k/n)*sumation(i=k to i=n-1, 1/i) to try to <br>
see if I could somehow reduce to this:<br>
<br>
limit n-&gt;infinity of [(n-1)/n]^n which I know evaluates to 1/e<br>
<br>
Also the odds of correctly guessing the number, employing the <br>
strategy of letting the first n/e numbers go by approaches 1/e as n <br>
approaches infinity.  I verified this by trying out many different <br>
games with different values of n, and finding that at n/e the odds <br>
are always better than any other value of k for that game.  I don&#x27;t <br>
like the empirical solution to this problem, where you test and find <br>
that the odds are approaching 1/e, but is this the only way?<br>
<br>
Is there a way I can use the following:<br>
<br>
limit as n-&gt;infinity of (k/n)*sumation(i=k to i=n-1, 1/i) to somehow <br>
prove that when you take this limit the sum inside does in fact <br>
approach 1/e?<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help.  I&#x27;m very excited to have even gotten as far as <br>
I have gotten, to know the general odds letting k numbers go by out <br>
of n total, but I&#x27;d like to know how to take this problem to the <br>
very last step and achieve the result we did in class assuming I <br>
didn&#x27;t know how many to let go by out of n numbers and wanted to <br>
discover this best number k.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help,<br>

Yes I can. I am not addicted to posting the same message over and over 
again. Apparently there was a problem at yahoo groups, which was also 
shown on the groups home page yesterday, where posts from gmail were 
delayed. At the time I posted the problem was not known, so I assumed 
something went wrong when posting. I tried to post with all kinds of 
browser settings, and now they&#x27;re all there, duh... I apologize for all

          <div class="email-content">&gt; And of course, there&#x27;s one person who should probably come to mind <br>
in<br>
&gt; terms of honesty in actual performance... a certain young cuber who<br>
&gt; showed up to Caltech Winter 2006 and started posting incredibly <br>
faster<br>
&gt; averages not too long after.<br>
<br>
I think it&#x27;s blatantly obvious who you are talking about, and I would <br>
defend this person for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1. he/she (guess which one) once held the unofficial world record for <br>
single solve, so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any doubt they have the speed <br>
to put up excellent times;<br>
2. because of their gender being in the minority and the reputation <br>
of being the #1 cuber in the world of that gender (until a certain <br>
Dzoan came along), they very likely felt much more pressure than <br>
others in the public eye, which I feel could very easily cause a huge <br>
difference in time between at-home and in-the-spotlight.<br>
<br>
In a similar vein, let&#x27;s keep in mind that Thibaut beat out the <br>
current world champion in competition.  You think going up against <br>
the official #1 doesn&#x27;t create some intense nervousness?  I&#x27;d say <br>
chances are good that this person is legit also.  Just because YJM <br>
and some others handle the pressure well, doesn&#x27;t mean everyone does.<br>
<br>
FWIW, I&#x27;ve never been in a comp, but when I solve in front of my co-<br>
workers, my times are very often 25+% slower than when I am at home.  <br>
So I am unswayed by arguments that such a difference is unreasonable.<br>

Being the unofficial record holder doesn&#x27;t mean anything.  Do you know<br>
how easy it is for my friend Kent Adams to be the unofficial record<br>
holder?  He averages 10.5 seconds for an average of 100.  His<br>
blindfold times are all under 70 seconds, and he can swallow a<br>
scrambled cube and crap it out solved.  He&#x27;s simply better than<br>
EVERYONE else in the world.  He just chooses not to post, because he<br>
feels the unofficial records are meaningless.<br>
<br>
And to be honest, they are.  Many top cubers in the world have stopped<br>
posting, because we realize they don&#x27;t mean anything.  Stop using<br>
unofficial world records as evidence for anything.  It&#x27;s like writing<br>
your own history book, and then using it as proof.  (Hmm... I know<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Miles =)

For the adjacent case you can put only one of the corners in proper 
position by turnin the U-layer and then use the usual three-cycle 
corner permutatin of nine moves (+ U = 10). That is the shortest alg to 
solve the case. The opposite case is the hardest of them all and needs 
at least 11 turns HTM (maximum depth for the 2x2x2 is 11 HTM). To solve 
the case easy you can use a usual 3x3x3 N-permutation or any other PLL 
that swaps those corners.

Hi Clancy, I&#x27;ll definitely consider this when I next get time to work on<br>
it, which will hopefully be in March. But yes, there are a lot of<br>
features I have been planning / wanting to have for a while, as well as<br>
all of those features that users have suggested, and so the next update<br>
will probably be a big one.<br>
<br>
Some features that I would really love to implement are:<br>
<br>
- A &quot;fewest moves&quot; mode<br>
- Some sort of player profiles feature.<br>
- A virtual room in which you can both a) chat with each other, and b)<br>
  share the same cube with each other. The intention is that you could<br>
  teach someone how to solve the cube in this room.<br>
- In the head-to-head battles, use the profile pictures (if they exist)<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s true,

A better way to have phrased my question might have been to mention it 
is the &quot;Marriage problem&quot; or at least that is how it was proposed to 
us in class when I first saw this.

My question though is how do you know to divide n by e?  Why don&#x27;t you 
divide by pi^2/4?  That&#x27;s pretty close to e.  Where does the e come 
from is my question.

The farthest I&#x27;ve gotten is that I&#x27;ve found an expression that tells 
you the general odds for letting k girlfriends go by out of n 
potential wives of correctly choosing the best wife.  This expression 
is:

(k/n)*summation(i=k to i=n-1, 1/i)

But how can I maximize these odds by finding the right value for k?  
Clearly k has to be a portion, or fraction, of the number n since the 
number k changes as n changes.

I&#x27;ve thought about rephrasing the above sum as follows:

let k=p*n where p represents the portion of the n you let go by.  
Clearly this p should evaluate to 1/e if I solve correctly.

I&#x27;m trying to find a way to use this substition for k and also to 
approximate the entire sum as a continuous function, where the normal 
rules of calculus would make this much easier to maximize the value of 
the function.  I&#x27;m thinking that maybe the sum as n approaches 
infinity could be thought of as an infinite Taylor series expansion of 
some continuous function, which I could then differentiate to try to 
maximize the value for k.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  The entire reason I&#x27;ve 
brought this up is that I realized when solving this problem that I&#x27;ve 
never really had to maximize a discrete function before and I&#x27;m not 
sure which tools to use to make this easier.

And no I&#x27;m not trying to figure out the Marriage problem to use it to 
get married :-)  I think one fatal flaw in that idea is that you have 
to correctly guess the number n of girlfriends you expect to have in 
your entire life.  Maybe this does lead to an interesting more general 
problem, or number game if you like that better, where given some 
unknown number of numbers whose magnitude you do not know you have to 
find the largest number.  From there adopt a strategy to find the 
largest one, and find the strategy that gives you the greatest odds of 
finding the number.

The chances of finding the largest number would have to be less than 
1/e since you are also guessing what n is.  That seems interesting, 
but before I try that I&#x27;m still stuck on the regular plain old 
Marriage problem! ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Your sum works out to the sum of (nx^n)/n! but the n in the top 
cancels with one from the bottom, so it&#x27;s (x^n)/(n-1)! . The power 
series of e^x is x^n/n! That should help some. If you don&#x27;t see how 
to get that first part, just start adding your fractions. The leading 
term of the polynomial is large enough to make the other terms 
negligible. 

If you want a fun math problem, prove there are no 2 integers the sum 
of whose squares is 12,345,678. I did that as a junior in high 
school, no knowledge past algebra is necessary. Give it a try.

          <div class="email-content">In my opinion, directly evaluating a limit is almost never the best 
way to do something. Anyway, why does your high school have a 
discrete mathematics course? Seems a little too specialized at that 
point. Do they do that before or after calculus?

I think he&#x27;s talking about separate occasions.

Don&#x27;t know about that, but for sure they become a joke if people stop 
posting their real times altogether.

The current world record holder should not be allowed to vote for

          <div class="email-content">Craig, I mean no offense to you, but it&#x27;s conceivable that your fingers 
were on the puzzle for every single one of those solves when you 
stopped the timer.  I think that&#x27;s just the way Magic goes.  Because 
times are already at around 1.0x, it&#x27;s necessary to take advantage of 
every little thing.  It&#x27;s just very difficult for a judge to say when a 
solve is valid and when it isn&#x27;t.

Of course we can consider scrapping any of the events.<br>
But in that case please come with a good way of deciding on it.<br>
Magic is one of the popular events.<br>
It is good to have variation in the events.<br>

It varies a lot, but I&#x27;m pretty sure June 8 or so is last day for high 
school in vegas.

IMHO 2x2x2 reduction is still a STUPID idea for 4x4x4 speeding. But 
as agreed, theoretically doable (naturally). A cube can of course be 
transformed from one valid random position to another legal position 
with valid/legal turns only :-P

          <div class="email-content">>_&lt; Mathletes like me study modular arithmetic in middle school.

I&#x27;m guessing you wanted something like this:

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that two integers a and b exist
such that
a^2+b^2=12345678.
Since a^2 and b^2 are either both odd or both even, a and b are also
either both odd or both even. If they&#x27;re both even, however, then
a=2a&#x27;, b=2b&#x27; for some integers a&#x27; and b&#x27;, and substitution gives
4a&#x27;^2+4b&#x27;^2=12345678,
which is a contradiction since 12345678 is not divisible by 4.
Therefore, a and b are both odd. Let a=2c+1, b=2d+1 for some integers
b and d. Substituting into the first equation, we get
4c^2+4c+1+4d^2+4d+1=12345678
4c^2+4c+4d^2+4d=12345676
c^2+c+d^2+d=3086419
c(c+1)+d(d+1)=3086419.
But either c or c+1 is even, so c(c+1) is even, and similarly d(d+1)
is even, which gives the desired contradiction.

This is still basic modular arithmetic though, working in mod 2
repeatedly instead of jumping straight to mod 8. I just squared each
number from 0 through 7 and reduced them mod 8 to find the quadratic
residues, so that was still just basic modular arithmetic. But I guess
most high schoolers don&#x27;t think of even*odd=even as 0*1=0 mod 2.

I&#x27;ve just looked at the original video again, looking at the endings
of the solves frame-by-frame. It appears to me that Craig is in fact
releasing the puzzle before putting his fingers on the timer. In the
2.78 (although that one doesn&#x27;t really seem to matter), it appears
that his hands become completely separated from the puzzle two frames
before his fingers reach the timer. But as his fingers move down they
seem to catch up with the puzzle again (although it seems that his
fingers are behind where the puzzle is). In the other solves, the
puzzle is still up in the air when his fingers are first seen in
contact with the timer. In some cases it looks like there could still
be contact with the fingers or thumbs on the last frame before he&#x27;s
touching the timer, but it is rather hard to tell because of motion
blur and the camera angle.

I can&#x27;t say without a doubt contact there is no contact with the
puzzle when he touches down on the timer, but I don&#x27;t see any
clear-cut case of him having simultaneous contact with the puzzle and
timer either.

Maybe video review could be made a mandatory part of Magic judging...

  Yeah, that&#x27;s the approach I was thinking of. Assume the numbers exist 
  then, redefine them in terms of odd and even until you get the n(n+1)
  is odd contradiction. I didn&#x27;t know anything about modular arithmetic 
  back then. (Not that I know a whole lot about it now either). Thanks 
  for the replies. By the way, I&#x27;ve been working diligently on the 
  homework you assigned and I may be posting my findings soon.

Voting is the best way to decide what events to keep and which ones 
to scrap. But this voting should only be for major tournaments like 
US Nationals, WC, EC etc.. Smaller local competitions should be more 
free to choose obviously.

My 2 cents ...

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I then looked at the general problem of letting k numbers go by.  <br>
&gt; The odds to correctly choose the largest number employing the given <br>
&gt; strategy for having n numbers and letting k go by is <br>
&gt; (k/n)*sumation(i=k to i=n-1, 1/i) or written out that&#x27;s (k/n)*[(1/k)+<br>
&gt; (1/(k+1))+(1/(k+2))+(1/(k+3))+...+(1/(n-2))+(1/(n-1))]<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So now the problem is basically solved except for one part.  Given n <br>
&gt; numbers, how many should I let go by?  Now the sad part is I know <br>
&gt; the answer, because we did this problem in class.  The answer is to <br>
&gt; let n/e of the numbers go by.  Round to the nearest whole number <br>
&gt; when you do this division.<br>
<br>
Hi Chris<br>
<br>
This is close to a demonstration, it gives you the idea :<br>
<br>
you have : sum_{i=k}^{n-1} 1/i  &lt;=  int_{k-1}^{n-1} dx / x<br>
and sum_{i=k}^{n-1} 1/i  &gt;=  int_{k}^{n} dx / x<br>
<br>
So : k/n ln(n/k)  &lt;=  k/n sum_{i=k}^{n-1} 1/i  &lt;=  k/n ln((n-1)/(k-1))<br>
<br>
as ln((n-1)/(k-1))  ~~  ln(n/k)<br>
<br>
k/n sum_{i=k}^{n-1} 1/i  ~~  k/n ln(n/k)<br>
<br>
Then you study the function f:x -&gt; x/n ln(n/x)<br>
f&#x27;(x) = (1/n) ( ln(n/x) - 1)<br>
<br>
so f&#x27;(n/e) = 0<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Erik!

Why not pay a small fee for a permanent site with huge storage and 
high bandwidth?
I have good experience with hosting site at siteground.com

Also watch the following thread:
http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5946

Good luck!!

It would be UFR, UBL, and DFL for the example i gave.  Thanks.

If you can write very simple html with hyperlinks you can make an OK 
site. And as others have mentioned, host your vids at YouTube and 
link to them from your page(s). The youtube page(s) will show you the 
code to insert into your own page(s) :D

However, you can only store like 15MB of information, so you should host all videos on youtube or something, then just link there or embed the video on your webpage.  15MB of text is quite a large amount.  If you need some help, feel free to email or PM me.

Once cubing is on TV and has commentators and referees, we can start 
worrying about video review.

Commentators: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s looking mighty close there, Jim. We&#x27;ll 
just have to wait for the ref&#x27;s decision. And here comes Tyson.&quot;

Tyson: &quot;After further review, the solve stands as ruled.&quot;

The guy with the five DNFs for *regular* solving?

Hmm, maybe not, as he didn&#x27;t compete blindfolded.

organizers to borrow a cube, and then fail to solve one with your eyes open
on the stage.

There are some jerks in this world, but this one had us seriously
considering a two-year ban from WCA competitions.

Guah... if we had charged an entry fee, I wouldn&#x27;t have cared.

P.S.  As much.

          <div class="email-content">It would be difficult to write official regulations concerning people like
that, but they seriously break an unwritten code of conduct, not just in the
cube world, but out of consideration for people in general.  I also remember
a blindfold solver at WC 2005.  Let me quote him:

&quot;The world record for the blindfold solve is about 2 minutes.  Since my
[speed solve] solution takes 90 seconds, if I memorize in 10 seconds, I&#x27;ll
have the world record.&quot;

Now, what is wrong with that statement?

          <div class="email-content">I think  there are different cases :

- If you don&#x27;t know anything about the cube, having Gungz&#x27; Cube or a very
stiff cube will not make a difference.
- If you are a medium cuber with a bad cube, I think a good cube could help.
- If you are a good cuber with a good cube, I think it is not good to use
someone else&#x27;s cube since you are perfectly used to your cube and the force
you need to use to perform the moves optimaly.

his color scheme to be like Gungz and Macky. I think we can all agree
something like that won&#x27;t improve your performance significantly.

          <div class="email-content">there a saying in tennis that goes like this:

&quot;It&#x27;s not the racket, it&#x27;s the player&quot;

it&#x27;s mostly true. A good cuber is not made because he has a good cube. It&#x27;s
both. It&#x27;s easier to get good times, but not required.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been living in London for the past two years and I found that the
London Tube is a great place to cube. The light is very bright and white
-- excellent for cubing. I broke lots of personal cubing records on
train. If the train is quite busy and I have to stand (and thus hold on
to the handrail) then I just practice one-handed cubing with the other
hand.

          <div class="email-content">Just after WC 2005, I had an idea for a super cool color scheme :

Green and Blue opposed (Bottom and Top)

And then for the side colors, it would go like this : White - Yellow -
Orange - Red
The idea was to have those in a special order so that it would go &quot;darker&quot;
when you turn the cube to the right.

But after a few hours of practice, I found out that it wasn&#x27;t going to
improve my times at all :p

So the conclusion is : any color scheme is good, as long as it is easy to
recognize

Open this page:
http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/generator.html

Then type:

    iif;dkhheifhh &lt;enter>
    hhijkhhdldsee &lt;enter>
    u &lt;enter>

Now it is set up to drill PLL cases. Each time you press spacebar, it
should generate a random PLL case.

You don&#x27;t need to actually solve it using the simulator keys, but you
can practice just looking. That is:

- press spacebar
- try to recognise the case
- press space
- try to recognise the case
- ...


You could come up with other generators to also drill OLL cases, or F2L
cases.

CORRECTION: On the last line, you should type:

baffles me is how someone could even imagine that a cuber would think 
that the cube is what separates one cuber from another. Millions of 
people wore Michael Jordan&#x27;s shoes and there was only one Michael 
Jordan. You don&#x27;t need to explain that to me. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure 
if you were taking me seriously, or were just playing along. I&#x27;m 
still not really sure. I did get the impression that you (Tyson) were 
getting slightly hostile. Yeah, I&#x27;m not Gungz and neither are you, so 
what? I don&#x27;t want to be Gungz, but I do think he&#x27;s pretty cool and 
his blog is my favorite website right now. There&#x27;s a lot of good 
stuff in there. I also don&#x27;t want his cube, although I wouldn&#x27;t mind 
having a Joycube. They look nice.

I live in North Carolina.  It&#x27;d be great to have a tournament that close, and I&#x27;d definitely 
come.  Mid-July would probably be better given that school, for the most part, is no longer 
in session.  Great to hear of an east coast tournament though!

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

It sounds like i&#x27;m pretty much using the exact same method as you right now, however, 
my times are in the high twenties-low thirties.  Other big differences are I do F2l 
completely intuitively with the exception of 2 algorithms, and i don&#x27;t even know all of the 
G-permutations.  My advice to you though is stop memorizing for a while and concentrate 
on what you know and learning that better.  Look at the cube and learn what you&#x27;re doing 
and how that affects the rest of the cube.  Anyone will tell you that you&#x27;re not fast at F2L 
until you understand exactly what it is that you&#x27;re doing regardless of whether or not 
you&#x27;re using algorithms.  Just do tons of solves and work on case recognition for all the 
different steps of the solve.  Other than that there&#x27;s not much else you can do to get 
faster.  Learning more algorithms is only going to get you so far.  I hope this helps.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

A good cube ALWAYS helps. My times dropped 4-5 secs immediately when 
switching from old non-brand Hamleys cube (sanded and lubed by me) to 
a rubiks diy-kit cube. A good cube means EVERYTHING (almost). As Ron 
says: never practice with a bad cube. Likewise, never compete with a 
bad cube. In my experience trying to practice a slow/stiff cube to 
become faster on a good cube does not work. Practice on a cube very 
similar to the one used in competitions ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey! i was searching up how to restick new stickers after seeing <br>
that some of the pictures had crooked andmessed up stickers. I dont <br>
have that problem because of a special trick my father taught me <br>
though :D. He had given me some industrial reflective stickers <br>
because my original ones were waring off so thats when i was about <br>
to stick em on then he told me not to.<br>
<br>
Generally he taught me a simple trick to stick the stickers on your <br>
cube practically perfectly. All you need is a toothpic, scapple, box <br>
cutter, pin, or anything very small but strong, your stickers, a few <br>
Q-tips and dishwashing liquid/soap mixed with some water and some <br>
varsol if you want. First of all you must remove the old stickers <br>
and clean off the excess glue with the varsol, wipe the extra off <br>
and make sure it&#x27;s free from the sticky stuff. Next wet the face of <br>
the cubie with some of your dishwashing soap with the q-tip (enough <br>
so it doesnt instantly evapourate but less than when it is dripping <br>
off). Now wet the back side(sticky part of stickers)with the soap as <br>
well, make sure the q-tip is wet all around so none of the thin <br>
hairs can stick on to the stickers back. Now simply stick it on to <br>
the cubie&#x27;s face which you wet with soap. Use your small object, i <br>
used a scappol (very thin and small box cutter/paper cutter) and <br>
adjust the sticker so that it is in teh spot you want. Finally apply <br>
straight-down pressure making sure you dont move your stickers out <br>
of place, let dry for a few minutes and move on to the next cubeie.<br>
<br>
Sorry for any spelling mistakes, and if any part is unclear.<br>
<br>
P.S. i used Palmolive -spring sensational diswashing liquid mixed <br>
with some water. And when you&#x27;re applying the soap on to the cubie, <br>
try not to create bubbles or else there might be trapped air in the <br>
sticker.<br>

This is the best response I&#x27;ve heard thus far from both sides. I fall 
under the category of medium cuber with a bad cube (34.96 secs 
fastest nonlucky), and I am sure that my time would increase by 5 
secs with a better cube, any cube, whether it is Gungz&#x27;s or not. Some 
of the better cubers will find very little, if any, increases in 
their speed just because they use Gungz&#x27;s cube.

The main point is that the popularity itself of the cube will not 
matter, but the smoothness of its turns will make a difference 
primarily for medium cubers such as myself.

It&#x27;s the mirror of the alg listed on Dan Harris&#x27;s webpage:
http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/index.php?page=3x3x3/cfop/oll/ollcasealledgesflippedcorrectly

Case #56
l&#x27; U&#x27; L U R U&#x27; r&#x27; F

I find this one slightly faster:
(l&#x27; U&#x27; L U) (R U&#x27; r&#x27; F)
comparing to:
(Rw U R&#x27; U&#x27;) (R&#x27;w F) (R F&#x27;)
But maybe my grip is not optimal on this 2nd alg.

What are you guys thinking?

Hi Per, 

One of the reasons I left this group is because of all the flack I got
for attempting to get a consensus for an official notatation.

There is no &quot;official&quot; notation. 

There&#x27;s a notebook in files for notation schemes. I invite everyone to
make make use of it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi David :-)

Well it can be debated whether we have an &quot;official&quot; notation or not.
But at least we have a &quot;common&quot; notation. The W postfix is certainly
not part of that IMHO. I&#x27;m sure 95% of the cubers here use lowercase
letters for wide turns/double-turns. So Macky, if you read this, set a
consensus for other cubers and update your site with the most commonly
used notation so as to not cause confusion. And i recommend (mild
command) Ron to add these double turns to the notation page on his
site also. Maybe (defninitely!) it&#x27;s a job for WCA to set official
rules for 3x3x3 notation!? Even we have disagreements here, it should
be fairly easy to let the &quot;majority&quot; decide this and come up with a
proper OFFICIAL notation. As for larger cubes the WCA may also decide
on official notation for these, at least for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, but it&#x27;s
less urgent in my opinion. A notation for larger cubes should also
take into account even larger cubes (olympicubes) and since these are
not publicly out yet we can wait.

Best regards,

-Per

PS! Personally i do not like xyz (cube rotations) notation but we may
as well include them in an OFFICIAL notation ;-) And they&#x27;re already
on the beforementioned scc&#x27;s notation page :D

          <div class="email-content">The file downloaded from strangepuzzle should be called JNetCube.jar and you
can execute the program by either double-clicking JNetCube.jar (if using
windows) or by opening a command prompt, navigating to the directory with
JNetCube.jar, and type:

java -jar JNetCube.jar

If that doesn&#x27;t work for you, then you probably need to install Java. You
can get that here:

Actually no I didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t assume, I read. And *if* you have 
looked around and weren&#x27;t satisfied, *say so*.

I guess I&#x27;m just not the spoon-feeding-and-petting-you kind of guy, 
but the slap-you-in-the-face-so-you-start-thinking-and-become-able-to-
do-things-on-your-own kind of guy.

Oh hey wait a minute. My reply did give him two explicit pieces of 
advice: practice and look for existing tutorials. I guess after all I 
did try to help him get that ability to do research that you 
mentioned. On the other hand, there are people (won&#x27;t say names) who 
just try to keep him &quot;computer illiterate&quot; by feeding him a link.

Try other algs.  Just because Macky likes an alg doesn&#x27;t mean it has 
to work that well for you.  I&#x27;m not saying that Macky&#x27;s algs are bad, 
or that they won&#x27;t work for you, but don&#x27;t limit yourself to only 
using those.

I&#x27;m sure you realize that &quot;here&quot; isn&#x27;t too good of a representation of
the cubing community. The w notation originated in the Japanese
speedcubing community, where it was already in use when I joined the
forum in early 2003. Because of the language barrier, most Japanese
cubers avoid this English forum. Moreover, perhaps because of the
recent interactions between the Korean and Japanese communities,
Korean cubers also use the w notation. Of course, many non-Asian
cubers who visit Japanese and Korean sites also understand the notation.

Based on http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/statistics.php,
the top 5 countries with the most competitors are

USA 501
Japan 220
Korea 99
Poland 79
France 73

As you can see, w notation isn&#x27;t as uncommon as you believe, and I&#x27;m
sure more cubers will become familiar with it as they visit Yu
Jeong-Min&#x27;s blog.

> > > Please all who have sites using that notation change to official 
> > > notation!!

After seeing these statistics, I&#x27;m certain that you won&#x27;t be so
unreasonable as to still ask the entire Asian cubing community to
switch to an &quot;official&quot; notation. Further, I don&#x27;t see any reason why
I should change the notation on my website. I already explain at the
top of my page of notations that &quot;The notation used on this site is
the most commonly used notation (RLUDFBxyzEMS) with suffix &quot;w&quot; for
double layer turns adopted from JSCC [Japan Speed Cubing Club]
notation.&quot; That said, I&#x27;d be happy to include a link to the notation
on speedcubing.com as well as explicitly mention that cubers outside
the Japanese and Korean communities may not understand the w notation.

Of course, I do see the advantage of having an official notation for
WCA. If we take a majority vote now as you suggest, even including all
the Asian cubers, the lowercase notation will win without a doubt. My
concern for pushing such a plan is its possible damaging effect on the
relationship between WCA and the Asian communities. After all, WCA is
World Cube Association, and I believe that it should maintain a good
relationship with cubers anywhere in the world. A compromise, such as
the recognition of other well-established notations, would be a much
better plan.

I apologize if this reply sounded somewhat harsh. The only reason for
this is that I don&#x27;t appreciate your tone thus far in this discussion.

Next time, please take the time to do your research before using an
unsoftened imperative.

          <div class="email-content">Like Macky, I do not think this a problem.
The only difference is that instead of using the minor case, a w is added
after the letter.
This doesn&#x27;t look like too hard to learn.

I would be more concerned if French cubers started to use the French
notation !
H = Up
D = Right
G = Left
B = Down
P = Back
(I don&#x27;t remember) = Front

That, in my opinion, would be a big problem.
The &#x27;Asian notation&#x27; (if we can call it like that) is fully understandable.
There is no need to impose one of these 2 notations.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Ok, even if there are more cubers using the W-notation, i still think 
it&#x27;s a good thing to avoid &quot;duplicate&quot; notation. Then we can have a 
discussion which notations are better avoided. If we want to 
be &quot;professional&quot; i think this is a good and important thing.

There are a few japanese here at this forum at least. I don&#x27;t really 
know to get a unified singular notation across, other than making it 
WCA official. We can of course also do without wide turns. As they 
are just combined outer and inner turns, with existing notation.

Even if standardising the notation is not practically possible, i 
think it&#x27;s a good idea. But the world has not even managed to 
standardise other units of measure, like length, weight, shoe sizes, 
shirt sizes. So we may just have to live with this &quot;mess&quot;...

It is allowed to hope though ...

And Macky, i mentioned your name because you were one of the few that 
i know using the W-notation, and you are a famous influential cuber ;-
) No offense :-)

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s a practical suggestion.

Instead of trying to force the entire planet to use one notation that  
someone somehow decides will be the best for everybody for all time,  
somebody (it could be the WCA, but also anyone who wants to) could  
put up a registry of notations. It would just be a web page for each  
notation, explaining how it works and how you translate to other  
notations. Ideally in several languages.

I imagine it would just be a standardized link in some corner of each  
page, or near notation sections saying &quot;This site uses Revised  
Peruvian Roux notation&quot;


This is good for those of us who have a cube web site, since you  
don&#x27;t have to write a page explaining the notation you use, you can  
just link to an existing page that explains it much better than you  
could.

It is also good for readers of those sites, since they can get the  
notation explained. I can&#x27;t read most the sites out there, since they  
use notation I don&#x27;t know exactly what it means (knowing fairly well  
what it means doesn&#x27;t really help). I assume that&#x27;s even more true  
for the average web surfer looking for cube info.

It would also be good for whoever sets up this registry. Not only  
would that entity be loved and respected by a world of cubers, the  
advertising income from such a well trafficked site would be killer.

So... somebody should really do this. I won&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s open to anyone.

The first notation I learned (in 1981) was something called &quot;HAMA-
HAMA&quot;. (Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ever was used outside Sweden?). 

H = Höger (right)
V = Vänster (left)
M = Mig (me = F)
D = Dig (you = B)
T = Toppen (the top)
B = Botten (the bottom)

All consonats

Then to write a turn (only face turns possible) you add a vovel after 
the face letter:

E = mEdurs (clockvise)
O = mOturs (conter clockvise)
A = hAlvt varv (half turn)

Sune looks like this:

HE TE HO TE HE TA HO

Then you start to add them two by two and make small words of them 
HETE-HOTE-HETA-HO!!! Wery easy to remember =) =) =)

I would suggest also making it available in XML format so websites
that don&#x27;t want their visitor to leave the site can just grab the data
and render it on their own site.  Granted, this does take away from
the advertising cash-grab that would be available for the site with
the monopoly on the notations, but this would be more community based.

I wish more cubing sites made things available in an RSS type of feed.

Yes, I can acknowledge that most webmasters within our community would
not be able to use an XML feed at this stage. However, it does not
mean they could not learn. I am sure many of these people said the
same thing about basic JavaScript and CSS to start with, too.  But if
an XML feed was available, perhaps that would be all the motivation
required to enable an amateur web developer to learn something that is
such a major technology.  And those of use that can use it can take
advantage of it immediately.  I know i would love to have the news on
speedcubing.com in an RSS feed that i can subscribe to, as an example.

Yeah and while we&#x27;re at it, I suggest all those Asian guys simply 
learn English, that would improve worldwide communication and

Two easy facts:

1) I DO wish a unified single OFFICIAL notation, but i know that many 
people object to that or don&#x27;t see the need. I still think it would 
be a good idea. I&#x27;m allowed to think so. But hey, even in chess they 
have at least 2 common notations, british and international. Or 
whatever they are called.

2) My comments about web-design were in respect to the previous post 
about XML/RSS. I myself design web-pages at my work and i don&#x27;t use 
any of that. I work with PHP/PostgreSQL. And indeed quite simple 
HTML/JS. But hey it works. I&#x27;m not trying to put anyone down here ...

Best regards,

Per

and the other statement, tell me what you were trying to accomplish by saying this:

Most &quot;cube-page-designer s&quot; only know basic html with tables, 
 paragraphs images and links. It&#x27;s technically challenging for non-
 programmers to write sophisticated web-pages

you have no indication or idea of anyones potential or exisiting coding abilities and it does sound pretty condescending to me, sounds like you think most cubewebmasters are low level programmers and only use very basic ideas/code to post things.  whether or not this is true, whats the point of saying this?

chess does have 2 notations, its descriptive and algebraic

Hi :-)

I wrote *most*. But i guess i should have written *some*. If you want 
to flame me for that then fine! I do know for a fact from other posts 
that SOME cubers have basic skills writing web pages. I&#x27;m allowed to 
say that i&#x27;m a more experienced web designer than many other cubers 
making their web pages.

Not everything written here in this group has to be &quot;objective&quot; 
or &quot;proven&quot;.

And im not gonna respond anymore about cube notation or webpage 
design. It&#x27;s like sticking my hands into a burning flame. Not worth 
the trouble ...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

Two years ago pretty much everyone here agreed that there wasn&#x27;t an
official notation. It&#x27;s interesting to see that one has sneaked in the
back door.

The trouble I have with that notation is that it is a fingertrick
ntation, not a pure notation and that it steals lowercase letters from
an older scheme. The scheme that Macky gives wisely uses other letters. 

Lars has a good idea, however I wish to note that I put forward a
similar idea two years ago. I created a notebook for the different
notations, so that newcomers could find and understand them, and save
people duplication, but NO ONE put their notation in there.

For xyz why not use Q like I do? Especially since the axes are not the
same ones in use in math and map-making. 

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

In the notation I use &quot;r&quot; stands for the slice moves, not a slice and
a side move together. Not only is that part of the notation I use over
30 years old, it is the same as the 4x4x4 notation.
Why should cubers who use a lot of slice moves be treated like
outsiders when their notation is a genuine central notation and what
Per calls &quot;official&quot; notation is not?

Cheers,

David J

Hi :-)

I have posted about that topic also in the past. My idea was to use 
some postfix modifier, not prefix. Since all other notation is post-fix 
based. One could use Rc (c-cube), RC (C-cube), RP (P-puzzle) for the 
same as you would use QR. xyz is not intuitive and does not extend 
easily to other puzles. With my idea (or urs) physical turns of 
tetraminx or megaminx (and others) is easy to denote with basic 
notation.

Actually i have one more minor notation grudge. I would love to see the 
old slice/antislice notation being used more widely. It was part of the 
Singmaster notation from which todays most widely used notation is 
actually a subset (sort of).

-Per

PS! Made an exception to my promise here ... ;-)

          <div class="email-content">David,

The WCA changed the scrambling program for r to designate the outer two
slices.  In order to notate a single slice on the WCA scrambling program,
you would need to write something like r R&#x27;.

The reason for this is SOLELY for the scrambling program.  It is much much
faster for us to scramble this way, and we determined the integrity of the
scramble to be intact.

So in terms of the WCA scramble program, this is how we do things.  I do not
comment on anything outside of the WCA scramble program.

I requested an RSS feature on speedcubing.com by sending an email to 
Ron a while ago and got the reply that &#x27;we prefer to have people go to 
the site&#x27;. I think a lot of the people who avoid RSS for 
commercial/statistics reasons don&#x27;t realize that you can set RSS to 
show a summary and have the full text only available on the site. That 
would get _more_ people to the site, because with RSS it&#x27;s becoming a 
lot easier to check very often if there is anything good.

          <div class="email-content">Let me clarify.

I&#x27;m quite pissed off right now.  I guarantee there will be a 
significant amount of trash talking in this group.  I guarantee a lot 
of it will come from me.

But those who know me know that I am a very rational being.  This group 
will also be a forum where we will come up with requests for evidence, 
or simple steps that certain posters can take to restore credibility to 
their name.

I am not an unreasonable man.  If you claim a x-second average, and 
your average time in competition is x + 7 seconds, and your best time 
in competition is x + 1 second, but it was a PLL skip, we&#x27;re going to 
be suspicious.  Honestly, you&#x27;re better off not posting to begin with.

This forum will also be a place where we can discuss statistical tests 
to determine who is within range of credibility, and who is not.  In 
the future, I&#x27;m going to suggest these steps to the world, so you don&#x27;t 
piss me off.  Because otherwise, I&#x27;ll end up doing something like this.

1.  Don&#x27;t play 1. d4.  I don&#x27;t know how to respond to it, and I usually 
end up in a really bad position.
2.  If you&#x27;re a parent and your kid is playing a chess game, don&#x27;t make 
any gestures.  Stand behind the kid, so he can&#x27;t see you.
3.  Don&#x27;t lie on speedcubing.com.  If you do lie, when you post video 
evidence, include sound.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s too easy for you to speed it 
up.
4.  Don&#x27;t drink and drive.  Drunk dialing me, and telling me that 
you&#x27;ve had a beer, five shots of vodka, and are currently driving on 
the highway is the dumbest thing ever.  Call me, and I will come pick 
you up so you don&#x27;t have to drive.  If I&#x27;m playing a chess game, leave 
a message, and I&#x27;ll call you back when I&#x27;m done.  In the meantime, 
drink as much vodka as you want, as you&#x27;re not driving.
5.  Are you an attractive single female?  Stop messing with my head.
6.  Wipe off your hands if they&#x27;re sweaty and you&#x27;re about to shake 
hands with someone.

Here are a list of questions that you shouldn&#x27;t ask me.  In fact, I 
will be printing out index cards with the answers to these questions.  
If you ask me one of these questions, I will hand you a card.  If you 
receive a card, don&#x27;t talk to me for 5 minutes.

1.  OMG!  ZOMG!  Are you REALLI Tyson Mao?!?
2.  Were the girls really that dumb?
3.  Can you REALLY solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube?
4.  How do you solve it blindfolded?  (Allowed if you can solve it with 
your eyes open.)
5.  So did you have fun on the show?  (If I didn&#x27;t have fun, I wouldn&#x27;t 
have done it.)

A list of things not to say.

1.  I used to be able to solve it in like a minute.
2.  My friend/ex-girlfriend/neighbor/father&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s dog&#x27;s pet hamster 
could solve those things WITHOUT LOOKING in 5 seconds.

Gosh, the list goes on and on.  We&#x27;ll let this forum be a place where 
you can complain about these statements too.

Oh, and one more thing not to do.

1.  Solve the Rubik&#x27;s Cube behind your back in 27 seconds, and then 
speed solve it in front of you in 21 seconds.
2.  Rock back and forth like an idiot while someone scrambles your 
cube, and then speed solve the cube in 21 seconds AFTER solving the 
cube behind your back in 27.

Grarh.

If any good can come of this, I hope you&#x27;re all entertained.  Because 
I&#x27;m quite pissed off, and even though I&#x27;m pissed, at least someone 
should benefit from it.

 <br>
 finally something we agree on<br>
 <br>
 &gt;&gt;I do know for a fact from other posts that SOME cubers have basic skills &gt;&gt;writing web pages. I&#x27;m allowed to say that i&#x27;m a more experienced web &gt;&gt;designer than many other cubers making their web pages.<br>
   <br>
 well of course you&#x27;re allowed to, but who wants to sound arrogant and rude? there was no point to that statement except to make you look superior to most other web page designers.<br>

 no but a point is always nice<br>

 <br>

Man, I better to good in OH this week-end if I do not want to fall in
Tyson&#x27;s &quot;suspects list&quot; :p
In my case, it&#x27;s x+1 for single solve (though it was not a PLL skip :p) and
x+6 for average...:-(
But it was done last year, I think I improved a bit since then. :-)


Thanks to your post, I see a good objective of your group and I will join
(which I didn&#x27;t wanted to before since I didn&#x27;t see any real meaning of it
besides unleashing anger and stuff like that) if I am accepted of course. :p

But you acknowledge it as a PLL Skip.  Which is fine.  We all have PLL 
skips, but it&#x27;s best not to post those averages in unofficial times.

You want to post times unofficially that you can reproduce in 
competition.  You don&#x27;t have to necessarily reproduce them, but be 
within the ball park.

solve especially (mm...sum 16 is good :D)

Serious cubers shouldn&#x27;t post such records.
Though it&#x27;s ok to send them to strangepuzzle on video, but as it is well
said in SCC posting rules : &quot;You should be honest when posting records.&quot; &amp;
&quot;You should only post *single records* if they are not lucky cases.&quot;

          <div class="email-content">Yes it&#x27;s a great system because of the phonetics, I still remember 
algs from the early ages just because of the names, the case you get 
from doing U2 M2 U2 M2 me and my brother still refer to as HAVATA-
HAVA-BA =) (you cannot write M-turns so it has to be R nad L).

After I wrote the post about the system yesterday Lars Petrus sent me 
a mail where he asked me &quot;if it was Andrejs Dunkels notation&quot;. 
(Andrejs Dunkel is a pretty well knowed Swedish mathematician and 
also author of a number of books in matematics). But I did not know, 
so I asked Anders Larsson who I know also knows about HAMA-HAMA if he 
knew...

Here is a translation of the answer I got from him:

Yes!, Andrej Dunkels presents the HAMA-HAMA language in his wonderful 
little booklet &quot;Qben - med tiden rätt vriden&quot;** from the year 1981. 
In the booklet he also admit the following:
 
&quot;A big thanks goes to Julianna Szendrei, Budapest, for many idéas, 
not at least the one for the HAMA-HAMA language&quot;

(end qoute)

** That translates to &quot;the cube - in time right turned&quot;. But in 
Swedish that rimes =)

Intresting is: there is most likeley a Hungarian version of HAMA-
HJAMA, does anyone know anything about that?

  Hi Clancy!

  Two easy facts:

  1) I DO wish a unified single OFFICIAL notation, but i know that many 
  people object to that or don&#x27;t see the need. I still think it would 
  be a good idea. I&#x27;m allowed to think so. But hey, even in chess they 
  have at least 2 common notations, british and international. Or 
  whatever they are called.

  2) My comments about web-design were in respect to the previous post 
  about XML/RSS. I myself design web-pages at my work and i don&#x27;t use 
  any of that. I work with PHP/PostgreSQL. And indeed quite simple 
  HTML/JS. But hey it works. I&#x27;m not trying to put anyone down here ...

  Best regards,

  Per

  surprised if anyone than can solve a rubiks cube or not, would be 
  able to see r and know exactly what to do and then see Rw and have 
  their head explode (except per). i&#x27;ve never had any problems with 
  various notations except the x,y,z convention doesn&#x27;t match the math 
  x,y,z system, but again its not that hard to adjust. both systems 
  are equally valid and easily interpreted, so why repress one because 
  its not the one you&#x27;re most comfortable with? i have always found 
  macky&#x27;s page easy to learn from and very comprehensive, if he&#x27;s going 
  to change it hope he adds more ideas and content and doesn&#x27;t waste 
  his time with trivial bits like notation.

The stickers are made of pure vinyl, a plastic material, so yes they 
are waterproof! But whether the glue is water-resistant is another 
matter... I wouldn&#x27;t think so. Maybe that&#x27;s what you are really asking??

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson!

Yes that&#x27;s how i interprete lowercase faceletters. But how about 
scrambling revenge/professor? I know the scrambling for them also 
uses double-outer turns. How are they designated? Like r? or (Rr)? I 
would say (Rr) is most common, but yes then we have a &quot;disagreement&quot; 
between 3x3x3 notation and 4x4x4/5x5x5 notation.

Why am i sticking my hand in the flames again? ;-)

Are you being serious..? I thought you were joking, but this sounds 
kinda like you are being serious here...

To me.. this post looks really weird.

About people asking questions about you being Tyson Mao etc.: Come on 
dude, why should you care? The way you are complaining and talking 
about it all the time makes me suspect that you just like the 
attention, and I don&#x27;t blame you.

If people like to solve the cube in 27 seconds behind the back in 27 
seconds, I gonna let them. I really can&#x27;t be bothererd.

I&#x27;m quite pissed off with your post too. I was accused earlier of 
being rude when commenting about cubers web-coding skills, which was 
only meant as a response to a request about xml/RSS.

What you suggest is way over the line. People respond very 
differently to the special atmosphere/pressure of a competition. Some 
even do better in competitions than in training :-0 Unofficial times 
and official times are just two different cups of tea. They should 
not be seriously compared. That however is no reason to scrap 
unofficial times, or forcing people not to post unofficial times if 
they do not have matching official times. I have no reason to doubt 
that 95% of the times reported are true anyway. And the remeining 5%? 
Well, they are really just fooling themselves Tyson if the times are 
bogus. Why would we care? WCA database shows us all the facts we need 
about official competitions and results. People can draw their own 
conclusions ...

Really i guess you are just pissed that someone achieved such good 
bld time, while you cannot yet match it ...

          <div class="email-content">I sometimes plan to create (almost alredy did) a axis notation and 
also a metric for it, ATM = axis turn metric.

The basic idéa is to notate turns around one axis X, Y or Z and then 
more than one slice or even a cube orientation is possible in one 
note:

For a 3x3x3 a R move looks like this : X001 or x001 (does not matter 
if it is X or x). R&#x27; looks like X003 and a R2 like X002. An L&#x27; is 
X100 (the turning direction looks at the cube from the axis side, in 
this case R, Y looks from U and Z from F). To write a cube 
orientation you simply write X111. To write a anti-slice (Ra) then do 
X301. A M-turn is X030. A M-slice + cube orientation X101. You can 
also notate moves like QR+M&#x27;+L2 = X321 (yes David, I also use Q =). 
That &quot;QR+M&#x27;+L2&quot; counts as one single turn ATM, the X321-turn =)

Then, if the cube is a 4x4x4 an R is X0001. But, because of R, U and 
F are the rightmost turn-digit you can shorten it to only X1 for all 
sizes of cubes, X10 means &quot;turn the second slice from right&quot; so the 
alg F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; can be written like Z1 Y1 X1 Y3 X3 Z3 (does not 
look that terrible).

It also has the benefit that it can be adapted to any size of cube. 
What do you use for notation for the third slice from left for a 
11x11x11 cube? =) =) =) Or for a 7x for example, those are for real.

Is this a good idéa? (I think it is =)

That idea is not new. It&#x27;s been discussed occasionally in the 
fewestmoves group when the metric debate comes up from time to time. 
So far, afaik, no computer algoritm exists for such axis metric. FMC-
companion does calculate the other common metrics: htm,stm,qtm,sqtm :-

Evidence is not being produced and discretion is not being used.  Let 
me make my week long statement.  Then, I&#x27;ll just delete the group.

I can match 1:16 and I have.  There are certain things must happen with 
a solve for that to happen though.  Do me a favor and rehearse a few

          <div class="email-content">Indeed, you&#x27;re right Joel.

I&#x27;m not bothered by those &quot;cheaters&quot;. 
When you beat them in competition, that&#x27;s enough.
I don&#x27;t care weather they average at home sub 16, and i beat them at competition with nearly sub 20 averages. Them i&#x27;m just a better cuber. Cubing  (in competition ) also involves handling stress, so aal the credit if someone can. Then he&#x27;s the better cuber.

            Tyson...?



Are you being serious..? I thought you were joking, but this sounds 

kinda like you are being serious here...



To me.. this post looks really weird.



About people asking questions about you being Tyson Mao etc.: Come on 

dude, why should you care? The way you are complaining and talking 

about it all the time makes me suspect that you just like the 

attention, and I don&#x27;t blame you.



If people like to solve the cube in 27 seconds behind the back in 27 

seconds, I gonna let them. I really can&#x27;t be bothererd.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I don&#x27;t have a problem with all the good posted times lately. so why 
would ia make a group? What for? Anti-Tyson group. Now that is plain 
stupid. Im don&#x27;t have grudges against YOU. But the way you judge many 
people for lack of &quot;competition evidence&quot; is out of line ... IMHO ...
One must distinguish apples and oranges ...

-Per

Oh well this is gonna be another useless thread ... Let people have 
fun playing the cube, and post what times they want. I&#x27;m sure Ron 
receives a lot of unbelievable times that do not get posted ....

don&#x27;t be ridiculous.  the faster you are, the more consistent times
will be.  when it takes 60 seconds to solve, averages are less
consistent and especially so are the times.

So about what range of time would you say the 7 seconds rule can be
applied? under 30 seconds? cause i average around 35 or so but my
times can range from high 20s to high 30s.

Okay, I see your point. But you guys still scare me. I likely won&#x27;t go
to a competition for at least another 3-6 months because of my
schedule, but if my best average to date is 42 seconds, and I pull off
a 50 second average in competition...

I mean...I think there&#x27;s a difference...competition you get five
solves...with the fastest and slowest being dropped. But when I take
an average, I use JNetCube Timer and solve twelve times. Although the
past three averages I have taken were all under 45 seconds, I still
consider those to be good averages - not ones I could consistently
achieve in competition - almost sort of lucky, if you will. My best
average however, would have been 45 seconds instead of 42 if I had
taken only the first five solves, instead of all twelve. (I got
&quot;lucky&quot; with the last 6 solves, four of them being under 40. So that
was what brought my average down.) 

If I were to take my more standardized, less lucky averages of around
45 seconds...if I took only the first five solves instead of all
twelve, it would likely come to an average of 50 seconds. 42? 50? Kind
of a big difference...factor in the nerves of being at your first
competition...another 5 seconds...55 seconds. Hmmm, 42 seconds...55
seconds...big difference. This guy must be a liar.

I wonder where I will be in several months...

You guys still scare me. ;p

You see what you are doing Tyson? Scaring innocent cubers!! It&#x27;s a 
bloody shame!!

Andy, please go to a competition whenever you want to. The only 
person talking about suspicious other cubers is Tyson. Really, if 
you are a cuber, you need some social interaction with other cubers.

It is.  Sorry about that.  I apologize.

Andy, you have nothing to worry about.  The easiest way for people to
believe what you can do is just for you to go to a competition, talk to
people, and show them that you are a reasonable person.  I am confident that
you are, so you have nothing to worry about.

Don&#x27;t be scared of Tyson. He is fighting his battle almost alone :-)
But if you go to competition maybe better select one where Tyson is 
not judge/organiser/participant? :-P

We want as many as possible to come to competitions and have tons of 
fun and meeting other weird cuboholics like ourselves :-)

give us a reason not to be. Most cubers don&#x27;t give us a reason to be
suspicious. We understand that people with slower times are going to
have bigger standard deviations, especially in high stress situations
like in competition. But if you claim something like an sub-80 BLD
average, we want proof, and you&#x27;d better be able to back it up in a
competition setting.

It&#x27;s not obvious to me. And I&#x27;m the guy who once thought Tyson&#x27;s 1:13 
(or something like that) video was sped up when it wasn&#x27;t. I think 
bad quality video can falsely give you the impression of unrealistic

...or else?

But hey, who is &#x27;us&#x27;? I mean, I understand you want proof, and I 
understand your post completely. I just can&#x27;t understand what Tyson&#x27;s 
post is about.

With rehearse do you mean I can practice the same scramble a few 
times? Also, what kind of times do you achieve?

I very much agree with Tyson, I just have a different tolerance level 
for what to believe, tend to have a higher desire to believe.

I&#x27;d phrase that as &quot;we&#x27;d like proof&quot;. He has no obligation for proof 
and we have no right to demand proof, we can merely ask for it.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,

I don&#x27;t get all the fuss about this...
Most people (95%) are honest, those who aren&#x27;t are just fooling
themselves. And, some people (like me) just get very very nervous at
competitions (you should&#x27;ve seen my hands during 2x2 at EC shake). 
One can&#x27;t demand presenting evidence of their skill, most people don&#x27;t
have a cam or similar. Plus you would have to record all your cubes or
you&#x27;ll mis a PB. For people who are completely unknown (Frank
Dickerson) and also others, I don&#x27;t tell they are not that fast, I&#x27;m
just curious if they realy are fast. I&#x27;m not saying they cheat untill
i&#x27;ve seen &#x27;proof&#x27;, just being curious. Posts like on this subject is
(I think) very bad for speedcubing sport/hobby/obsession/etc. Lets all
be happy and enjoy the thing we have in common, CUBE!
Erik

reason, we wanted to capture the best features of the original Cube<br>
speed, intelligence, challenge, and the tactile experiencein an <br>
electronic version that will provide several different challenges for <br>
you to conquer! Packed with six games that test your speed and your <br>
smarts, multiple levels, single &amp; multiplayer games, lights, sounds, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ken,

I like the axis notation. When scrambling I often add R301 and R103
after a Q or two, when I start to hit duplicate CLL&#x27;s.

I had pretty much the same thought for the 11x11x11. So, yes, I think
it&#x27;s a good idea. Some common things may develop shorter notation,
like Rodd (R01010101010) Reven (R10101010101) Rother (R01020302010)
Rascal (R32132132132) Rabbit (R01223332210). :) 

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">i think tysons main point isnt&#x27; for the people that do some certain times, its people that say they consistently break the world record for events at home, and when time comes to perform, its not even close.  honestly, no one knows or cares if you claim a 22 average at home and get 30 at a comp.  its the huge exaggurations of world class performance that are out of line.  

and per you are so rude i can&#x27;t handle it, you haven&#x27;t don&#x27;t 1/100 what tyson has done for the cube community and anyone lucky enough to attend one of the tournaments he organizes will enjoy the best and largest cube competitions there are in the world, so far only second in attendance to the world champoinships.   per i think you take so much offense to this because you are a big offender, you openly claim to be as good as frank at the big cubes, post absurd times unofficially, and your competition times aren&#x27;t even close; you claim sub 2&#x27;s, and can barely hit sub 3 in competition.  

andy i encourage you to come to one of tyson&#x27;s compeitions he&#x27;s a great guy, and good friend, dont listen to anyone talk shit about him

 Don&#x27;t be scared of Tyson. He is fighting his battle almost alone :-)
 But if you go to competition maybe better select one where Tyson is 
 not judge/organiser/participant? :-P
 
 We want as many as possible to come to competitions and have tons of

Whenever I have a ring of people around me talking loudly and
pointing, I tend to shake a lot while I&#x27;m solving. Do any of you have
suggestions for calming down and solving under pressure? My times were
not horrible, but they were about 7 secs above average (my average is
43 secs btw). I&#x27;m getting better at remembering algs under pressure,
but the shaking just continues.

Thanks,
Joshua

what tyson has done for the cube community and anyone lucky enough to
attend one of the tournaments he organizes will enjoy the best and
largest cube competitions there are in the world, so far only second
in attendance to the world champoinships.   per i think you take so
much offense to this because you are a big offender, you openly claim
to be as good as frank at the big cubes, post absurd times
unofficially, and your competition times aren&#x27;t even close; you claim
sub 2&#x27;s, and can barely hit sub 3 in competition.

Just lube your cube again afterwards and it i perfect. :-)

(I still use my first cube, a rubiks.com cube and I have been using it for 2
years now :-))

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

Here are some more pictures of Chinese cube meetings.
Again: you can scroll forward on the bottom of the page.

http://bbs.mf8.com.cn/dispbbs.asp?boardID=14&amp;ID=2124&amp;page=1

http://bbs.mf8.com.cn/dispbbs.asp?boardID=14&amp;ID=3226&amp;page=1

This is one the unofficial competitions:
http://bbs.mf8.com.cn/dispbbs.asp?
boardid=13&amp;replyid=30751&amp;id=2544&amp;page=1&amp;skin=0&amp;Star=6
They have some pretty cubers over there.
Check out the results of one of the competitions.

Here is a picture of Danyang at an International toy and gift fair in 
Hong Kong.
http://bbs.mf8.com.cn/dispbbs.asp?boardID=13&amp;ID=3037&amp;page=1 

Soon I will post a video of a live tv appearance by Danyang Cheng. He 
solves the cube blindfolded 1:25. You can also see a 3 year old girl 
solving on live tv.

Is any of you going to China this year? Preferrably Guangzhou or 
Shanghai. We need someone to supervise for an official competition in 
China.

Thanks and have fun,

Ron

I agree.

I think a good idea would be to create a cheater record list so that they
would post their record in it. Wouldn&#x27;t it be funny ? :D

I actually have a blacklist of record posters. There are a lot of fake record posters.
Some guys think posting garbage is fun. Sometimes I laugh indeed.
People try strange with cubes. :-)

  I agree.

  I think a good idea would be to create a cheater record list so that they
  would post their record in it. Wouldn&#x27;t it be funny ? :D

I wasn&#x27;t rude until you started to attack me for no good reason. You 
interpreted some of my comments out of context and went haywire as 
far as i can see it.

I&#x27;m not claiming to be as good as Frank on the big cubes. He is 
beyond my level now. I haven&#x27;t practiced seriously for half a yr 
because i have no good cubes. I know this may seem lame to you, but 
im really badly affected by competition nerves, and i reach my zone 
only when being fully focused in a quiet room for about an hour or 
so. If you think that is not good enough, then so be it. That&#x27;s how 
it is. I expect you to OFFICIALLY apologize in this group for saying 
my times are fake. As said before comparing unofficial times and 
official times is useless. They are achieved in different 
atmospheres. I&#x27;m not so cold that im unaffected by competitions, and 
i participate for fun. And i follow this group and post here for FUN. 
If you feel you have to attack me in every post you make, can you 
please do so in private instead? Doing it here is pathetic.

I had a strong reaction to Tyson because his reaction was way out of 
line. One is always innocent until proven otherwise. And as Ron has 
said (and i knew it of course) some unofficial time posted are so 
absurd that they never even hit the unofficial record lists.

Maybe it&#x27;s typical american to always be so sceptical about everyone 
else? Yes i feel provoced now to say this. I do see that pattern 
sometimes...

Can we now all cool down and be friendly with eachother? I hope so ...

what tyson has done for the cube community and anyone lucky enough to 
attend one of the tournaments he organizes will enjoy the best and 
largest cube competitions there are in the world, so far only second 
in attendance to the world champoinships.   per i think you take so

to be as good as frank at the big cubes, post absurd times 
unofficially, and your competition times aren&#x27;t even close; you claim 
sub 2&#x27;s, and can barely hit sub 3 in competition.

  I requested an RSS feature on speedcubing.com by sending an email to 
  Ron a while ago and got the reply that &#x27;we prefer to have people go to 
  the site&#x27;. I think a lot of the people who avoid RSS for 
  commercial/statistics reasons don&#x27;t realize that you can set RSS to 
  show a summary and have the full text only available on the site. That 
  would get _more_ people to the site, because with RSS it&#x27;s becoming a 
  lot easier to check very often if there is anything good.

  With rehearse do you mean I can practice the same scramble a few 
  times? Also, what kind of times do you achieve?

  Cheers!

If they follow the rules, I think it&#x27;s ok to post &quot;bizarre&quot; times. I
don&#x27;t see why a sub-80 BLD avg would be impossible. And if someone
posts fake times, of course it matters! If we want to keep this
community a nice and friendly place, everybody should be able to trust
each other.

I think it&#x27;s quite harsh to say that thinking makes someone worthless. :S

What do you mean? I always thought it&#x27;s ok to set unofficial records
at home. If only the ones done in competitions count, why do the UWR
lists at SCC exist??? Please explain your point, I&#x27;m confused...

And before someone says my OH records are fake, I can promise they are
for real. I was tired and my hands were shaking like crazy in Helsinki
Open, I hope I&#x27;ll do a lot better in my next competition.

Hey, i think what he meant was that those times are worthless then, not 
that the person is worthless :-)

          <div class="email-content">Well, based on the way you can post your records on speedcubing.com, it is on the verge of impossible to decide whether a time is valid or not.  Therefore, you have to use your own judgement.  There could be 10 sub-80 seconds average BLD cubers out there, who knows.  Just because they don&#x27;t post their records or discuss online doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t exist.  However, by the response I have seen of the community, people stress when they see a bizarre record posted.  So I ask the question again, does it matter that they posted an amazing time?  It really doesn&#x27;t.  If you believe it, fine, if you don&#x27;t, fine. Yes, we want to keep this community friendly and fair, but as I said, UWR&#x27;s posted are pretty much impossible to confirm 100%.

Yeah, I think it is okay to set UWR&#x27;s at home too.  But from what I have seen, they aren&#x27;t taken too seriously.   Can you please explain to me more about the lists at SCC, I am not familiar with those.

&quot;And before someone says my OH records are fake, I can promise they are
for real. I was tired and my hands were shaking like crazy in Helsinki
Open, I hope I&#x27;ll do a lot better in my next competition.&quot;

Did someone say your OH times were fake?  I am actually impressed by some of the times posted, and I believe most of them, but some people here definitely get irritated when they see an amazing time.

          <div class="email-content">yes you were rude you&#x27;re just too thick headed to see it, you think that its ok to assert yourself over other people?  i&#x27;ve never said i was better than anyone at anything, even when i am, i&#x27;m just not a jerk like that, i don&#x27;t want to make anyone feel inferior for any reason.<br>
<br>
and being rude to me i could care less, we obviously don&#x27;t like each other and that&#x27;s fine by me, but to attack tyson is totally out of line, he&#x27;s done more for cubing than you have dreamed of, and anyone should respect the massive amounts of hard work he does to make our sport better.<br>
<br>
i have many witnesses that you openly proclaimed in the rubiks chat room you were as good as frank, just another lie if you say you didn&#x27;t.  you aren&#x27;t and never were as good as frank, and if you think i&#x27;m going to apologize you can dream on, you&#x27;re a liar, i called you on it, and you&#x27;d be a bigger man if you would just admit it instead of trying to keep on this path of lies.  you started attacking people and i&#x27;m coming to the defense of myself and my friends, against your i&#x27;m-superior-to-everyone attitude.<br>
<br>
if you want to continue in private then mail me in private and don&#x27;t respond here, you&#x27;re not going to bully me around.  i still say your strong reaction comes from the fact you know you are in the group that exaggerate their times, and took personal offense at what he said.<br>
<br>
if you insult my country of origin again, it just prooves how much of a loser you really are, you have no valid arguments to defend your crappy performances and attitudes so you attack the country i live in.  i don&#x27;t call norway a frozen desolate shithole so maybe you should back off, feel free to quit responding whenever you&#x27;ve decided you look like a big enough idiot.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The super bowl starts about 3PM PST on Sunday (tomorrow). I just watch it
for the commercials, the Seahawks didn&#x27;t make it so I really don&#x27;t care who
wins... but I&#x27;ll be cheering the Bears. :)

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s fine to argue about something in a forum (I would encourage<br>
people to do so), but this dicussion is getting ridiculous, there is<br>
no need to either launch personal attacks (in public) or insult<br>
countries. There are enough divisions in the World for us not to add<br>
one. By the way, I will probably come 6 months to Caltech (starting in<br>
April this year) to finish my master&#x27;s thesis and I am really looking<br>
forward to meet the great cubers from California (hoping to be welcome<br>
:-P), so please to not start an open war between America and Europe.<br>
We should all be a community that is proud of cubing.<br>
<br>
I wish everybody can forget and forgive what some people said and<br>
start focusing on some real problems.<br>
<br>
To get back to the initial topic of this thread, I agree that &quot;cube<br>
cheaters&quot; are not welcome and should not expect any repect from other<br>
cubers, but having a hard boundary (such as that x+7 avg in<br>
competition) is not the solution and no one can discriminate another<br>
cuber for having set a very good UWR at home.<br>

I wish you all some happy cubing,<br>

Thanks, Pedro. I, of course, knew the total already. I just wanted
someone else to point it out.  So, nearly 15% of all videos on
strangepuzzle are of a single person. I am of course just kidding
around, i don&#x27;t want anyone to misinterpret my post - what with the
over all tone of the board lately.  Just thought i would put the 1000
videos into perspective. 

But congratulations, nonetheless. It is a great site. Chris, have you
found the number of submissions are down given the popularity and ease
of Youtube now?

Actually, I think YouTube might be helping people submit videos that do not
have any other means of hosting their videos. For the past few months, most
videos sent to me are links to YouTube, Google Videos, and MySpace videos. I
admit it takes a little effort to get the videos off YouTube and onto
StrangePuzzle, but it&#x27;s getting easier and faster as I keep doing it over
and over again. I&#x27;m not really sure how much longer people will want to use
strangepuzzle, but I guess I&#x27;ll see what happens...

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

Of course im willing to drop it. But i think your attack contained 
much more (untrue) accusations than what i had done towards Tyson. 
That&#x27;s what really got me annoyed. Please accept that not all can do 
same times in competition as at home. That&#x27;s a fact. It&#x27;s so obvious 
that it doesn&#x27;t need any proof. I said i believe there are bogus 
UWR&#x27;s but that they are quite few and very obvious, and why make a 
fuzz about it? Most care much more for OWR&#x27;s in the first place. 
UWR&#x27;s do have it&#x27;s place however. Not everyone is able to go to 
competitions. Too many topics are now into this hot-pot and it got 
too personal and heated. As i mentioned to you in PM let us both 
delete some of our latest posts. They are pointless :-)

You can sign up to win something, but... I&#x27;m glad I did read the 
rules before I submitted my info. They *do* ask for my country, 
however in the rules I found:

&quot;This Sweepstakes is open only to legal U.S. residents [...]&quot;

I&#x27;m disappointed. Not because I can&#x27;t win, but because of the 
deception.

In any case, even if people don&#x27;t use strangepuzzle that much anymore

I did watch it again but I still don&#x27;t see something really 
suspicious. If there&#x27;s something specific I should look for, can you 
tell what it is and the time into the video when it happens?

Also... speedsolving using my blindfold method I average about 50 
seconds and I think I can drop to 40 with a few more algs and good 
recall during actual blindsolving. When I use it for speedsolving I 
always have to look for what to do next, which doesn&#x27;t take much time 
but it&#x27;s still slower than when I have memorized and have good recall.

Boris Konrad (one of the world&#x27;s top memorizers) tried blindcubing a 
bit and said he averaged 40 seconds for memorization and got down to 
30 in good cases.

With enough practice I&#x27;m convinced sub-70 blindcubing average is 
easily possible. Real average, that is, not just best average-of-10. 
And probably there are better methods out there.

Hey Stefan!

I have noticed that the flash based video sites like YouTube, GoogleVideo,
MySpace... etc all have noticeable low quality with the extreme compression.
I&#x27;m not sure flash is a good way to share videos, but I guess it helps
reduce the amount of people that &#x27;borrow&#x27; videos from websites or save them
on their computer. Also, many of the videos on YouTube have audio sync
issues and some lose audio completely during the flash conversion.

I like keeping all the videos on strangepuzzle local and of the same format
because it&#x27;s easier and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the links dying. Storage
space isn&#x27;t really an issue, so I don&#x27;t mind having all the videos on the
server. I use the WMV format not because I&#x27;m a huge Microsoft fan, but
because most users use Windows or OSX and both systems can play WMV out of
the box (as far as I know). WMV is also pretty dang good at shrinking video
sizes down without hurting the quality.

Yes it&#x27;s the flash-streaming that reduces the quality. I guess they 
use some kinda &quot;rough streaming&quot;-algorithm to make it fast and 
efficient. Sorta like low quality, but fast, decoding codecs. It 
would be far too costly to reduce the quality upon user upload :-)

PS! So Chris, be glad that you don&#x27;t have this issue on this site. So 
the better quality there will attract people to post vids on your 
site instead :-)

Hi Chris,

can you judge the myvideo.de quality? Here&#x27;s a video of me on it 
compared to the same on youtube:

http://www.myvideo.de/watch/446550
http://youtube.com/watch?v=A_GjdBoirHU

The first frame does look better and later frames compared on both 
sites (though I never really got the exact same frame) looked much 
better on myvideo.de. Plus when I uploaded my video there, it was 
online pretty much instantly, compared to several hours waiting for 
youtube.

Cheers!
Stefan

I understand the need to argue in certain forums, but do we have to

Oh, yes of coarse. No doubt the low quality is to save bandwidth and reduce
download time for slower connections. YouTube is probably one of the top
sites visited. It&#x27;s pretty awesome, no doubt.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

The video looks less sped up than the video of Tobias:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6KwzjCXv3w

My position is that if someone has done the effort to become very fast at solving (blindfolded), he is so much into our hobby that he will be trustworthy IN GENERAL.
There will always be exceptions, but who are we to be the judge? Is it easier to frown than to believe and be inspired?

I have had some e-mail contact with the Chinese cubers and recommend that to anyone having doubts.
Instead of fighting here, we can talk to them and ask them how they do it.
Just watch the pictures that I linked to, and you will see that the Chinese cubing community is similar to any other cubing community.
They just want to have fun and compete in a fair manner.

I was told that one of the Chinese cubers uses a method where &quot;he solves orientation and position at the same time, and each time solves two corners or edges.&quot;
Could be Stefan&#x27;s system, or another system??
We should think of better systems than the one we are using now.

Anyway, I have a new video coming up, where Danyang is solving on live tv in 1:25. It is a 20 minute performance.
Please wait a little more, because they have some slow servers over there... :-)

Have fun,

Ron

My point was that crappy videos can be deceiving. They can still be a video 
of a true event.
Is your point that a crappy video is a proof of someone who is cheating?

Anyway, we can forget about that video, because we have a new video.
A few points here:
- Danyang solves blindfolded in 1 minute 25 seconds
- he solves it live on tv for a huge audience
- he solves successfully after a failure in his previous attempt (I would be 
more careful the second time...)
- you see the scramble (please let noone say it was a bad scramble)

Here is the video (10MB):
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/a/videos/Danyang_tv_85s_bld.wmv

My conclusion: Danyang is great! (and so are all other fast blindfolded 
solvers)
Maybe we can learn something from him.

I will post the full 102MB video later. Need to find a good place to host 
it.

Have fun,

Ron

I think you&#x27;re missing something here. Yes Tobias looks sped up, but
the fact that it&#x27;s soooo chopppy makes it understandable. Also the way
it is choppy is funky, it skips back and forth, which also makes it
understandable. Whereas the other vid... its just fast.

The 102 MB video contains a lot of Chinese talking. :-)

But here is the video of 3 year old En-xi Xie solving in 1 minute 54 
seconds. (6MB)
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/a/videos/En-xi_Xie_tv_3 years_old.wmv

I wish she could be in an official competition.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Nice David, I like Rabbits =)

One more improvment I came up with yesterday is that you can put a 
inverting &quot;-&quot; (minus sign) as a prefix. You then look at the cube 
from the oppsite side. This is aspecially good for bigger cubes 
because then you can use &quot;-X1&quot; for L instead of X30000 if it&#x27;s a 5x 
and x30000000000 if it&#x27;s a 11x. Same goes if it is the second layer 
from left, just do -X01 instead of X03...0 and so on.

Oh he&#x27;s nobody. Except he holds the official 3x3 world record for

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron, <br>
<br>
I totally agree with you. Instead of demanding evidence at a certain <br>
tone, it&#x27;s much to just wait patiently and see what happens. Like <br>
now, I was also very curious about this Danyang Chen, but after this <br>
video, I am quite convinced that it&#x27;s all true.<br>
<br>
&gt; I was told that one of the Chinese cubers uses a method where &quot;he <br>
solves orientation and position at the same time, and each time <br>
solves two corners or edges.&quot;<br>
&gt; Could be Stefan&#x27;s system, or another system??<br>
&gt; We should think of better systems than the one we are using now.<br>
<br>
Sounds a bit like Stefan&#x27;s method, but then with three cycles. I <br>
believe there are a few people who combine Stefan&#x27;s method with <br>
three cycles... Dont know how this sounds, but I can&#x27;t resist <br>
mentioning that I once predicted everybody would solve like that in <br>
the future. I still think that this method has great potential, like <br>
Stefan&#x27;s M2 method ;).<br>
<br>
&gt; Just watch the pictures that I linked to, and you will see that <br>
the Chinese cubing community is similar to any other cubing <br>
community.<br>
<br>
Maybe I missed something here, but where are these pictures?<br>
<br>
-Joël.<br>
<br>
Oh. P.S.: The video of Tobias doesn&#x27;t look sped up to me. But then <br>
again, maybe that&#x27;s your point.. :)<br>

            Hi guys!

after about half a day of events we figured we had my computer with a webcam and wifi connexion, so basically, you can follow the competition there:

http://sylmuzox. free.fr/roissy/ webcam_html. htm

or in java there:

http://sylmuzox. free.fr/roissy/ webcam_java. htm

Have fun!!!

sorry for being so late... but the 3x3 final is still to come!!!

François

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Michael Gottlieb&quot; &lt;mzrg@...&gt;<br>

          <em>Date:</em> Sun, 04 Feb 2007 14:40:45 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve noticed that there have been a lot of flames here recently...<br>
<br>
Now this is stupid and it really has to stop. There is absolutely<br>
nothing to be gained by attacking someone over the internet,<br>
especially on a cubing forum. I thought that this group was &quot;All about<br>
speed solving the Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;, but it seems personal attacks are<br>
more important than that!<br>
<br>
Just think about the future... These posts are all saved. In years,<br>
people won&#x27;t look back and say &quot;Oh, look how rude Per was, Clancy was<br>
totally right&quot;, they&#x27;ll look back and say &quot;Oh, Per was sort of rude,<br>
but look how much Clancy overreacted&quot;. Maybe Per was arrogant or rude<br>
(I don&#x27;t think he was, but that&#x27;s just me) but Clancy&#x27;s reaction was<br>
thoroughly unwarranted. Before you flame me, Clancy, just look over<br>
Per&#x27;s posts and ask yourself if he really deserved what you threw at<br>
him...<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s have an example. At a competition, if someone says &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m<br>
sub-16 now!&quot; and you&#x27;re just barely sub-20, are you going to yell at<br>
them and insult them for being arrogant, just because they&#x27;re better<br>
than you at something? Are you going to yell at them if they say that<br>
&quot;most cubers are not sub-16&quot;? No, of course not. That would get you<br>
thrown out of the competition. So then why are you showing the same<br>
behavior here?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I&#x27;m being condescending for a reason... I respect all of you<br>
for your dedication, speed, and sense of community, but nobody<br>
benefits from online arguments (and you should know this). Flaming has<br>
no place among adults. Unless it&#x27;s obvious to everyone that someone is<br>
being consistently rude, arrogant, and annoying, flaming them is only<br>
going to bring you down to their level. It&#x27;s rude and arrogant to<br>
insult someone for being rude and arrogant! (Yes, I&#x27;m being rude and<br>
arrogant as well - but at least I&#x27;m trying to fix things...)<br>
<br>
So if someone&#x27;s being a bit rude, unless they&#x27;re going and explicitly<br>
insulting you, it isn&#x27;t that important and you don&#x27;t have to react.<br>
Let it go. It makes the forum a better place and it doesn&#x27;t completely<br>
ruin your reputation.<br>

I have become a member of the Chinese forum. So maybe I can find some more <br>
interesting stuff.<br>
<br>
These are taken at one of their unofficial competitions:<br>

<br>
They have some pretty good cubers over there. Check out the results of one <br>
of the competitions. And they improved again since then.<br>

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Video Please<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi Ron,<br>
<br>
I totally agree with you. Instead of demanding evidence at a certain<br>
tone, it&#x27;s much to just wait patiently and see what happens. Like<br>
now, I was also very curious about this Danyang Chen, but after this<br>
video, I am quite convinced that it&#x27;s all true.<br>
<br>
&gt; I was told that one of the Chinese cubers uses a method where &quot;he<br>
solves orientation and position at the same time, and each time<br>
solves two corners or edges.&quot;<br>
&gt; Could be Stefan&#x27;s system, or another system??<br>
&gt; We should think of better systems than the one we are using now.<br>
<br>
Sounds a bit like Stefan&#x27;s method, but then with three cycles. I<br>
believe there are a few people who combine Stefan&#x27;s method with<br>
three cycles... Dont know how this sounds, but I can&#x27;t resist<br>
mentioning that I once predicted everybody would solve like that in<br>
the future. I still think that this method has great potential, like<br>
Stefan&#x27;s M2 method ;).<br>
<br>
&gt; Just watch the pictures that I linked to, and you will see that<br>
the Chinese cubing community is similar to any other cubing<br>
community.<br>
<br>
Maybe I missed something here, but where are these pictures?<br>
<br>
-Joï¿½l.<br>
<br>
Oh. P.S.: The video of Tobias doesn&#x27;t look sped up to me. But then<br>
again, maybe that&#x27;s your point.. :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m kinda new at cubing and use a beginner method but I get close to 1<br>
minute solves usually and I want to start learning the Fridrch Method.<br>
The cross is uderstandable, but the I am having trouble understanding<br>
the F2L.<br>
<br>
I get that you&#x27;re supposed to insert 4 corner-edge pairs, and I see<br>
that there are a lot of pictures with algs that show you how to do it,<br>
but I always incounter atleast 2 porblems<br>
<br>
1.The corner and edge are really far away from each other, and don&#x27;t<br>
look like the picture<br>
<br>
2.The pictures only show 2 or 3colors when there are 6 colors<br>
<br>
I know this is probably a dumb question, but I have been trying for<br>
over a week to understand the F2L and I was hoping someone else  might<br>
have had this problem and could help me. Thanks for reading! And sorry<br>
about any speeling errors.<br>

It&#x27;s very easy to fake a blindfold video in at least three different  <br>

I would personally be very careful about accusing people of cheating  <br>

The consequences if you&#x27;re wrong are unpleasant and permanent.<br>

stopped in 2000 and didn&#x27;t start cubing again until recently. I

Oh cool. A puzzle. I&#x27;m sorry, I cannot resist, I have to name 3 and
you get one for free:

1. put on a blindfold. Have a friend stand out of sight and they tell
you exactly what to do. Sound can be mixed in later (or turn off sound). 
2. the most well known trick has been used to let people drive a car
(!), blindfolded: under your blindfold is an earplug, which could
easily be to a cell phone, and your instructions are spoken by that
same friend.
3. reverse the video of you scrambling a cube in a very
&#x27;blindfold-solving&#x27; like way. However, a reversed video is usually
quite easy to detect.
4. you practice a blindfold solve over and over again, until you have
completely memorized it. Then you tape, at full speed.

I don&#x27;t mean to give people ideas, I just want everyone to be aware of
these, so we can spot them more easily.

I recommend you look at Jason Thong&#x27;s site.

http://www.freespaces.com/jasa86/intro_f2l_intro.htm

 You&#x27;re basically dealing with only one pair at a time, which only has
3 colours. 

About the pieces being seperated or far away...you might want to look
at his advance tutorial too, about bringing pieces stuck in other
slots out:

http://www.freespaces.com/jasa86/non_standard_f2l.htm

Hope that helps

I just got back from Roissy. These are the results as far as I can remember them:

2x2x2 winner: Lars Vandenbergh, 6.5x average
3x3x3 winner: Thibaut Jacquinot, 14.0x average, 2nd was Eduard Chambon, 3rd was 
Jimmy Coll
4x4x4 winner: Lars Vandenbergh, 1:14.xx average
5x5x5 winner: Frederick Badie, with new single and average European records.
3x3x3 one handed winner: Gilles van den Peereboom, with new single and average 
European records.
3x3x3 blindfoled winner: Jimmy Coll

It was a well organized event and a great start to the 2007 season!

My videos aren&#x27;t sped up, there just very low quality.
My best average ever is like 19.40 so it&#x27;s not impossible to solve 17.xx.

Also in competition, i averaged +/-23 seconds, and it has been like 8 months ago, so i guess i&#x27;m credible.

            Hi guys,



The video looks less sped up than the video of Tobias:

http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=g6KwzjCXv3w



My position is that if someone has done the effort to become very fast at solving (blindfolded) , he is so much into our hobby that he will be trustworthy IN GENERAL.

There will always be exceptions, but who are we to be the judge? Is it easier to frown than to believe and be inspired?



I have had some e-mail contact with the Chinese cubers and recommend that to anyone having doubts.

Instead of fighting here, we can talk to them and ask them how they do it.

Just watch the pictures that I linked to, and you will see that the Chinese cubing community is similar to any other cubing community.

They just want to have fun and compete in a fair manner.



I was told that one of the Chinese cubers uses a method where &quot;he solves orientation and position at the same time, and each time solves two corners or edges.&quot;

Could be Stefan&#x27;s system, or another system??

We should think of better systems than the one we are using now.



Anyway, I have a new video coming up, where Danyang is solving on live tv in 1:25. It is a 20 minute performance.

Please wait a little more, because they have some slow servers over there... :-)



Have fun,



Ron

I did watch it again but I still don&#x27;t see something really 

  suspicious. If there&#x27;s something specific I should look for, can you 

  tell what it is and the time into the video when it happens?



Also... speedsolving using my blindfold method I average about 50 

  seconds and I think I can drop to 40 with a few more algs and good 

  recall during actual blindsolving. When I use it for speedsolving I 

  always have to look for what to do next, which doesn&#x27;t take much time 

  but it&#x27;s still slower than when I have memorized and have good recall.



Boris Konrad (one of the world&#x27;s top memorizers) tried blindcubing a 

  bit and said he averaged 40 seconds for memorization and got down to 

  30 in good cases.



With enough practice I&#x27;m convinced sub-70 blindcubing average is 

  easily possible. Real average, that is, not just best average-of-10. 

  And probably there are better methods out there.



Cheers!

  Stefan

 Now this is stupid and it really has to stop. There is absolutely
 nothing to be gained by attacking someone over the internet,
 especially on a cubing forum. I thought that this group was &quot;All about
 speed solving the Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;, but it seems personal attacks are
 more important than that!
 
 Just think about the future... These posts are all saved. In years,
 people won&#x27;t look back and say &quot;Oh, look how rude Per was, Clancy was
 totally right&quot;, they&#x27;ll look back and say &quot;Oh, Per was sort of rude,
 but look how much Clancy overreacted&quot;. Maybe Per was arrogant or rude
 (I don&#x27;t think he was, but that&#x27;s just me) but Clancy&#x27;s reaction was
 thoroughly unwarranted. Before you flame me, Clancy, just look over
 Per&#x27;s posts and ask yourself if he really deserved what you threw at
 him...
 
 Let&#x27;s have an example. At a competition, if someone says &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m
 sub-16 now!&quot; and you&#x27;re just barely sub-20, are you going to yell at
 them and insult them for being arrogant, just because they&#x27;re better
 than you at something? Are you going to yell at them if they say that
 &quot;most cubers are not sub-16&quot;? No, of course not. That would get you
 thrown out of the competition. So then why are you showing the same
 behavior here?
 
 Anyway, I&#x27;m being condescending for a reason... I respect all of you
 for your dedication, speed, and sense of community, but nobody
 benefits from online arguments (and you should know this). Flaming has
 no place among adults. Unless it&#x27;s obvious to everyone that someone is
 being consistently rude, arrogant, and annoying, flaming them is only
 going to bring you down to their level. It&#x27;s rude and arrogant to
 insult someone for being rude and arrogant! (Yes, I&#x27;m being rude and
 arrogant as well - but at least I&#x27;m trying to fix things...)
 
 So if someone&#x27;s being a bit rude, unless they&#x27;re going and explicitly
 insulting you, it isn&#x27;t that important and you don&#x27;t have to react.
 Let it go. It makes the forum a better place and it doesn&#x27;t completely
 ruin your reputation.

around 10 minutes.  My spread is a little less drastic than 10s,
usually I&#x27;m averaging 25-27 for the first few solves, then I drop to
the 23-25 range.  I have definitely noticed the cube needs warming up
as much as I do.  Interestingly a hair dryer or leaving it in a warm
car seems to keep the cube sufficiently ready.  The heat can be murder
on the stickers though!

Hi,

I recently ordered new DIY kits from Rubiks.com. Last friday, I 
assambled one of them, and it works like a charm.

Hi!

It all depends on how long I have not been cubing, and how tired I am. 
When I am really in shape, I am usually getting good times after 5 
minutes. When I am not warmed up, but awake and focussed, practicing 
the 5x5 seems to work as a very good warm-up for the 3x3. 3x3 is so 
easy after a few 5x5 solves. This doesn&#x27;t work when I am tired, though.

          <div class="email-content">I like warming up with simple beginner&#x27;s method because I stop a lot 
less when I look for only one piece instead of 2 for f2l and last 
layer is easier to spot. After about 2 or 3 solves that decrease my

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

For Corner Orientation (CO), I memorised a bunch of patterns. It&#x27;s 
very much like OLL, but the algorithms I use don&#x27;t permute any 
pieces (just twist a few corners). I don&#x27;t only recognise these 
cases on the U and D faces, I can often recognise them on the 4 
other faces as well. 

Here&#x27;s a file that can be used for this, Marcus Stuhr posted it a 
while ago: http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/6343/corners8sh.png

I also learned some patterns that involve solving corners on more 
than one layers, such as:

(RU&#x27;R&#x27;U R&#x27;FRF&#x27;) * 2 and (RU2 R&#x27;U2 RUR&#x27;U&#x27;) * 2

Learning to recognise the patterns rather than memorising the 
orientations of individual pieces really sped up my CO memorization 
times. For easy cases, CO can literly be memorized in the blink of 
an eye. It&#x27;s almost like recognising 2 OLL cases. One last thing, 
you might want to post questions about blindfold cubing on the 
blindfold cubing group:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube

Is this the cube?

http://tinyurl.com/26vr86

I&#x27;m in the mood to try one of these cubes, but I have no idea how to order
one because I only know English. It appears that as soon as you add the cube
to your cart you are asked to log-in. When I click the button that looks
like it might create an account, I am greeting with a big form of stuff I
can&#x27;t read. :)

Anyone want to tell me how to order one of these cubes? :)

the basic turns but i do struggle with the fronts the backs and R&#x27;. I<br>
cant grasp how its done so that the cube isnt on the edge of falling<br>
off or the cube gets caught. I&#x27;m pulling down the face with either my<br>
thumb or pushing up with my right index finger and im not sure if<br>
thats really how your suppose to do it, so i was wondering if anyone<br>
has a video showing how to do each type of turn one handed or has any<br>

Who else would be interested in going to a competition in Denver sometime over the summer?  I know there are a lot of other competitions in May and Worlds in August, so it would be tight, but I think we could manage.  Tyson, you were thinking Vegas for a competition as well, do you have anymore details on if it will be there and when?  Denver is a pretty good spot actually (not just because I live 4 hours away).

          <div class="email-content">I took about 6 weeks off cubing and have been trying to catch up on <br>
posts. I&#x27;m about 600 messages behind...<br>
<br>
Hope it&#x27;s not too late to contribute to this thread.<br>
<br>
I attempted this today for the first time. It took incredibly long. <br>
doing 4 of the blocks was not too bad. I solved those 4 blocks into <br>
the bottom layers and then proceeded by using a combination of (u) <br>
turns and Sunes to solve combinations of centers and edges to match <br>
the corners. When down to the last few pieces I chose to solve edges <br>
first then the remianing centers. I was lucky and did not encounter <br>
parity. I used commutators for the last edge cycle (same algs <br>
Hardwick uses for bld, I&#x27;m sure). For remining centers I used things <br>
like Sunes and other short (7-8 turn) CLL algs to setup into <br>
possitions where I could just do an alg to spin the U centers a half <br>
turn without effecting any other supercube aspect.<br>
<br>
I also freely used interchanges with the Dd layers to swap in blocks <br>
with center colors I needed for this. These where typically 3 quick <br>
turns that greatly speed up things. I exploited the mixed-2x2 aspect <br>
of it as much as I could to set things up nicely.<br>
<br>
I then mixed it up again and solved the 4x4 layer-by-layer and found <br>
that I&#x27;m faster just doing that.... so I don&#x27;t think this &quot;segmented-<br>
2x2&quot; approach is very useful. Although if you have yet to try it, <br>
it&#x27;s pretty fun, I guess.<br>
<br>
Today: I&#x27;m averaging about 3:30 layer-by-layer. I&#x27;m averaging about <br>
1:58 solving centers-first. I think that the 2x2 idea took me nearly <br>
5 minutes.<br>

one of my (at the time) non-cubing friends suggested it. I saw no good <br>

seemed to be a new question in the community. It was not discussed at <br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Heise for the most part. However, I do agree with 
Stefan, that the word &quot;problem&quot; should be phased-out from out 
community (when it comes to certain topics). It&#x27;s a perfectly 
acceptable word to use in mathematical and scientific journals sure, 
but I find it&#x27;s not befitting for our uses and is a word that is 
abused and often leading to confusion.

I like the new terms Heise has defined in regards to parity. There 
are lots and lots of different types of parities (or precieved 
parities) in puzzle solving (it&#x27;s not just restricted to NxNxN 
cubes). And parity alone has to do with the common &quot;modulo 2&quot; 
issues, there are higher-order &quot;parities&quot; that might occur in other 
puzzles. Thus, the word &quot;parity&quot; alone carries very little 
information and we need to start being more precise about what we 
are actually talking about to avoid such endless bickering that may 
in actuallity be about nothing.

At the same time, Pat has made valid points. We cannot expect such 
things from the novice or those who are not native English, nor can 
we make assumptions about what ppl know. 

Anyways, it&#x27;s all about mutual-respect and being sensitive to where 
the other person is coming from.

btw, what&#x27;s so speical about the post number that Stefan mentioned?

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t see how that link helps.

Per&#x27;s question was for ACube specifically. I forget if Per is an 
experienced programmer or not, but it sounded to me like he was 
surveying interest in such a program. It would be very simple to 
write for an experienced programmer such as... (well you fill in the 
names, I don&#x27;t want to single ppl out).

I wrote a program that did something similar a couple years ago. It 
took a scramble and produced the stuff you had to memorize for BLD 
solving using cycles. I&#x27;m a bit busy, so if there is some interest 
in the program Per&#x27;s talking about, I&#x27;m willing to send out my 
source code to help with this. Should be a 5 minute modification to 
it or something.

Likewise, it would be a fun programming exercise for a beginner, or 
a challenge to the experts on how few lines it can be coded in... 
It&#x27;s pretty tempting to me actually. Curse my lack of sleep.

But to answer Per&#x27;s original question, I am interested in using such 
a tool. It would be incredibly helpful! So much so, I&#x27;m wondering 
why I don&#x27;t have one already. (I&#x27;ve always had to do it manually by 
hand, because I&#x27;ve never had to do batch runs in those situations.)

This would have been this type of discussion I would have loved to 
be apart of, but I was taking a break from cubing last month and 
hadn&#x27;t checked this fourm at all. If I was around, you wouldn&#x27;t have 
been the only one defending the idea... sorry you had to feel so 
alone about it. I&#x27;m going to continue to try more of these solves to 
find a decient way of forming the blocks. It&#x27;s FUN!

          <div class="email-content">No. I think the word &quot;edge&quot; and &quot;wing&quot; should be used interchangably 
for the 4x4 (though usually &quot;edge&quot;). &quot;edge&quot; does not mean a &quot;pair of 
wings&quot; to me, EVER. To be clear, &quot;edge piece&quot; or &quot;single edge&quot; could 
be used to stress what a person is talking about though.

It feels to unnatual to use the world &quot;wing&quot; for 4x4 though... not 
sure why, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious what is meant.

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody,<br>
<br>
Quite a few people asked me to write a blindfold tutorial. It&#x27;s now <br>
pretty much finished, but before uploading it to my site, I want <br>
some feedback. I can of course, read the whole document scanning for <br>
errors, but I usually don&#x27;t find my own typo&#x27;s in a document that I <br>
wrote myself.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I would like to ask a few of you to read it, and make <br>
suggestions for improvement. I especially want to ask people that <br>
don&#x27;t know anything about BLD cubing to read it, to see if they <br>
understand it.<br>
<br>
Basically my questions are:<br>
<br>
- Do you see any typo&#x27;s / wrong English?<br>
- Do you understand the tutorial, or are you missing some <br>
information?<br>
- Do you have any other suggestions to make this tutorial better?<br>
<br>
You can find the file in the &#x27;files&#x27; section of this group. It&#x27;s <br>
called &#x27;Joels_Blindfold_Tutorial.zip&#x27;.<br>
<br>
You can post feedback by replying, or by e-mailing me: jnoort[at]<br>

I am not sure he has future plans for China this year.

You can ask him at the Belgian Open if you want. ;-)

(In my opinion, I am not sure he would be interested in hosting a
competitition, and I am not sure he knows all the rules that have to be
known to be a WCA delegate for a competition.)
But surely he could set up a small meeting, if he is interested of course.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

If you want to use your right hand, it all depends on how you solve with 2
hands.
If your right hand usually is performing the algorithms while your left hand
is holding the cube, you will need to change the way you solve the cross,
F2L, OLL and PLL.
In fact, you will have to mirror everything.

So in a nutshell, you will have an adjustment period in which you will have
to learn to recognize all the cases from another angle and also perform
algorithms using U and L only (or mainly at least).

As for the videos, I do not have any. Just practice and you will find the
tricks yourself quite quickly I think. :-)

Good luck !

          <div class="email-content">Gilles is absolutly correct.

Why is it so you may ask? When holding the cube in your right hand 
the R-face is facing your palm and is therfore wery hard to twist. 
The L-face is on the other hand (!) free to turn. Most people I know 
are using their left hand for OH if they are right handed and right 
hand OH if they are lefties (like me).

So, insted of starting the hard work to learn all your algs in L-U 
instead of R-U, you can use your left hand for OH.

An other thing many OH-solvers does is to reduce their set of algs 
and do more steps in LL instead, mostly 2-step OLL is used. Why 
that?, it is not always easy to do the algs for OLL OH, you will mess 
up a lot in the beginning because of hard to do algs. But if you are 
using a reduced set of algs, you can get used to the algs much faster 
= less errors.

          <div class="email-content">HI DOug,

It&#x27;s interesting that this has come up, because the original way that
I solved parity involved thinking of the 4x4x4 as a 2x2x2.

What I did was swap two corners upright like a 2X2X2 like: R2 B2 R F
R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R then turn the slice a quarter turn u or u&#x27; then repeat R2
B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R. This covers the basic parity function. I then
sorted it out using sequences that have an even number of turns.

Not very efficient, but interesting nonetheless.

Really? Do you mean many of the 300+ that have recorded a OH solve, or
many of the top OH cubers? There is a huge difference.  I use a two
look last layer for OH, myself. Is this my problem? Can some of the
top OH solvers offer up their opinion on this concept?

I myself reduces to 3-step only for some cases, those where I know I do

the case, maybe you should try that?

 If you want to use your right hand, it all depends on how you solve with 2
 hands.
 If your right hand usually is performing the algorithms while your left hand
 is holding the cube, you will need to change the way you solve the cross,
 F2L, OLL and PLL.
 In fact, you will have to mirror everything.
 
 So in a nutshell, you will have an adjustment period in which you will have
 to learn to recognize all the cases from another angle and also perform
 algorithms using U and L only (or mainly at least).
 
 As for the videos, I do not have any. Just practice and you will find the
 tricks yourself quite quickly I think. :-)
 
 Good luck !

Okay, that makes sense.  Let me ask you this, then.  When you do a 3
look last layer, what is your &quot;set up&quot; algorithm? To clarify, I mean
the algorithm you execute first on the OLL case to get it to one that
you can perform easier/quicker.  Or does it vary depending on the
case?  I think the popular one for 3LLL is F (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) F&#x27; and its
inverse. 

I ask this because I had thought that using (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) r (R&#x27; U R U&#x27;)
r&#x27; and its inverse would be better as it does not upset corner
orientation and would allow you to know the resulting case from that
initial look.  Effectively making it a 2 look, however, the OLL
portion would be a rather long algorithm.  Of course, I thought of
this after I had learned full Fridrich.  Do any of the 3-look-cubers
currently do this, or would be willing to try for a bit and see if it
helps your times?

          <div class="email-content">Well, I&#x27;m not using OLL/PLL =) For 2H I&#x27;m using CLL/ELL. But I&#x27;m 
using mostly MU-algs for ELL and M are not fun to do OH so I&#x27;m using 
my old system for that. There I do VH for the last pair and then I 
solve edges permutation and one of the corners in one go, last step 
solves the three last corners. For some of the cases where edges are 
in Z-position I got pretty complex algs to solve those and the corner 
so I&#x27;m reducing there. Then I do Sune to solve two edges permutation 
and then I go from there as it was a simpler case.

I got some pretty short ELL&#x27;s that only orients edges and does 
nothing to the corners:

M&#x27; U M U2 M&#x27; U M (two in an angle)
M&#x27; B&#x27; R B M B&#x27; R&#x27; B (two strait, hold B as U and it&#x27;s easy to do)
F2 M F2 U M2 U&#x27; B2 M B (all four)

But, as I said, M is not fun to do OH =)

          <div class="email-content">I have been working off of your intermediate result of
(k/n)*sumation(i=k to i=n-1, 1/i)

I am not convinced that is right though as I have yet to check the 
top halfo f your message carefully, but I stopped at the part where 
you say &quot;limit as n->infinity of (k/n)*sumation(i=k to i=n-1, 1/i) 
to try to see if I could somehow reduce to this:&quot;... This value is 
in fact ZERO.

If your expression is correct we are supposed to hold n fixed, then 
maximize the value for k, in the calculus sence, and THEN take the 
limit. I am stuck on the maximization part though....

          <div class="email-content">So I spent a half hour on the problem Chris proposed without much <br>
luck. I re-read it and do agree with the expression he got for the <br>
value we are to maximize finally. And it is now clear to me that <br>
taking it&#x27;s derivative w.r.t. k is not the right approach. It <br>
yielded things like &quot;(1/n sum_{i=k}^{n-1} 1/i) - (k/n)(pi^2/6 - sum_<br>
{i=1}^{k-1} 1/i^2)&quot; which was immpossible to set to 0 and solve for <br>
k in terms of n... and so forth.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; So : k/n ln(n/k)  &lt;=  k/n sum_{i=k}^{n-1} 1/i  &lt;=  k/n ln((n-1)/(k-<br>
1))<br>
<br>
The above assertion I perfectly agree with Clément and think it&#x27;s an <br>
ingenious method to attack this problem. I can&#x27;t believe how rusty <br>
I&#x27;ve gotten.<br>
<br>
After this line, I get confused by your argument. What do you <br>
mean &quot;~~&quot;? It does not seem well-defined to me. I would like to see <br>
a rigourous solution from this point of the proof forth. I guess <br>
you&#x27;d have to show things about uniform convergence and stuff and <br>
then swap the order of defferentiation and limit or something (I <br>
forget). It is okay to take the limit of the inequallty and get <br>
inf&lt;=BLAH&lt;=inf which is useless. It is not okay to take the <br>
derivatives wrt k on all sides of the inequlity of course, so how do <br>
I proceed???<br>
<br>
I suppose we *could* say that:<br>
<br>
lim_{n-&gt;inf} (k/n sum_{i=k}^{n-1} 1/i) = lim_{n-&gt;inf} (k/n ln(n/k))<br>
<br>
to avoid the nasty upper bound all together. It follows easily that <br>
it&#x27;s &quot;&lt;=&quot;, but it can be an &quot;=&quot; due to the one of the definitions of <br>
Reimann integral. (Though one side of this equality is infinity.) <br>
Somthing needs to be said about uniform convergence in order to <br>
introduce differeniation and swapping the order of one side to <br>
proceed I&#x27;m betting.... I know there are some math folk here more <br>
knowledgable than me about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Doug<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; as ln((n-1)/(k-1))  ~~  ln(n/k)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; k/n sum_{i=k}^{n-1} 1/i  ~~  k/n ln(n/k)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Then you study the function f:x -&gt; x/n ln(n/x)<br>
&gt; f&#x27;(x) = (1/n) ( ln(n/x) - 1)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; so f&#x27;(n/e) = 0<br>

          <div class="email-content">There has been one small but successful tournament in Boise in 
September 2005.  we had 10 competitors I think, 5 from Boise area 
(myself included) and 5 from around the Northwest.  

If we had enough interest from others in the region, I&#x27;m confident 
we could host another tournament here.  and the next one should be 
even better--you always learn a few things the first time.  It&#x27;s not 
that expensive to fly in here, and it&#x27;s a doable drive from Colorado 
or Washington, etc.

Frank works at a hotel downtown and I&#x27;m pretty sure we can get just 
about whatever size space we need there.

fully understand it, i am by no means a very advanced cuber which is 
probably why i struggled a bit.  Its more detailed than other 
tutuorials ive read and i understood the edge permutation stuff, but 
it looks good overall.  At one point i think you made a typo while 
writing the T perm by making the last move a F instead of F&#x27;, 
probably isnt a big deal but may be confusing, unless its on 
purpose, im not sure. thats all.

I guess I would say that I&#x27;m familiar with it, if that&#x27;s all you 
where asking.

I don&#x27;t recommend getting one though, they are a bit pricey and I&#x27;d 
rather spend my money on new stickers and cubes. I lost interest 
after solving it a few times. Also, I doubt it&#x27;s built for speedy 
execution of algs.

          <div class="email-content">Bob, 

I was thinking more about travel from the region around here 
(northwest and mountain west and even west coast).  But $450 RT to 
NJ seemed high (I know I&#x27;ve flown into JFK for about $300), so I 
just went to cheapflights.com and plugged in EWR (Newark airport) to 
BOI and there were several in the mid $200s round trip. 

Cheapest flight was $239 round trip.  

maybe you need a new travel agent.  ;-)

JFK is usually even cheaper than EWR (but I know that&#x27;s a pain on 
the ground from Rutgers so probably won&#x27;t help you).

best regards, 
Kirk

Not a big deal if you are already comfortable with them... I got the 
impression this was more for general benefit and geared towards 
preventing confusion amonst newcomers.

Hey, I was freaked out when I first saw it spelled &quot;colour&quot;... lol.

Also, it&#x27;s not necessary to be facetious with statements like &quot;all 
those Asian guys should learn English, that would improve worldwide 
communication and collaboration dramatically.&quot; Although a counter to 
that would be that we Americans should learn Chinese (or perhaps 
Japenese) for the same reason. (And this is where I relish in the 
fact that I know both :).)

push the envelope and barely scrape by with barely any participants.
There&#x27;s no sense in doing an official competition in someone&#x27;s living room,
right?

So if you can guarantee 15 cubers, it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea to have a
competition in Colorado.  Nothing has ever been held there before.

Speaking of which, I am getting very close to a lock with Chicago for June
15 to June 17.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s a cool idea. The ATM part of it, I already thought of about 5 
years ago. &quot;ATM&quot; is a common acynoym for something else so I&#x27;d 
choose a different letter. (Not that I claim to be the first to have 
considered it.) I thought of it mainly as a way of counting the 
length of an alg and to be a different metric that programs can 
optimize for.

This notation you talk about could be useful for stuff like 7x7, but 
for now I don&#x27;t see any need for it for 3x3.

As for the &quot;Q&quot; or &quot;C&quot; notatation that someone mentioned, I don&#x27;t 
care for it. I am fairly comfortable with the xyz notatation however 
I did not originally like it. I am curious why those xyz 
designations are the way they are - who came up with it in the first 
place?

On a sidenote, before coming online to seek cubing resources, I used 
to use square brackets with lower case letters, so for instance [u] 
for y. &quot;()&quot; where for triggers as they commonly are, and &quot;&lt;>&quot; where 
for common algs such as I&#x27;d write &quot;&lt;sune>&quot; in the middle of an 
alg. &quot;.&quot; for pauses. &quot;-&quot; for logical joins of two short algs. &quot;{}&quot; 
for fingering comments. &quot;//&quot; for general comments. &quot;^&quot; for multiple 
compositions. &quot;+&quot; for treating a case as composition of two other 
cases... Also, I wa always a big supporter of the MES extension and 
the later mes for 5x5. I would always superscript the &quot;2&quot; on paper 
for things like R2 and still do.

          <div class="email-content">Alright.  Well, I know there are a couple competitions in May, you have one about ready for June, I know Bob is setting one up for sometime in the early summer, and saw about 3 others thinking about it on the east coast.  Plus there is Worlds in October that most will be saving up for.  So, with that said, who would definitely be interested in traveling to Denver, Colorado sometime over the summer (that would fit among almost everyone&#x27;s schedules)?  Please reply here stating whether or not you&#x27;d be interested.  I&#x27;m sure we can get at least 15 cubers to go, but I want to find out for sure.  Worse comes to worse, we can try it here the following summer.

Also, Tyson, is anything going in Vegas, or was it moved to Chicago?  If things don&#x27;t work out in Chicago, maybe we can shoot for Denver and combine the two possible tournaments.  Please let me know when you get time.

Thanks
Pat

  I&#x27;d want to see a total of at least 15 cubers. I&#x27;d prefer that you don&#x27;t
  push the envelope and barely scrape by with barely any participants.
  There&#x27;s no sense in doing an official competition in someone&#x27;s living room,
  right?

  So if you can guarantee 15 cubers, it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea to have a
  competition in Colorado. Nothing has ever been held there before.

  Speaking of which, I am getting very close to a lock with Chicago for June
  15 to June 17.

It&#x27;s like asking for a scrambled eggs and getting an omlette. You 
can&#x27;t be disapointed but you still have grounds for a complaint.

I think he is looking for an &quot;anti-ACube&quot;, something that takes the 
result (an alg) and can produce the original input string (well it&#x27;s 
not unique due to the many options of ACube, but the standard one 
would do fine). I&#x27;d like to use such a tool as well, and that&#x27;s why 
I&#x27;m so eagar to see something done about it. Anyways, it really 
don&#x27;t have to be complicated, I&#x27;m sure it can be done in under 40 
lines of C, or under 50 if going for robustness and useful error 
messages.

Also I am inclined to agree with Stefan&#x27;s comment about GUI&#x27;s being 
for kids. Text-based tools are more useful in for research-purposes.

In combination with ACube, it would be possible to use one of the 
solutions to populate the rest, or to use a sub-optimal one to 
generate a set of optimal soultions. This is very useful if you 
think about it... (well for reseachie stuff anyhow)

-----------------------------------
Also, sorry for early... how I reply to stuff without reading the 
entire thread as Ryan suggested under his &quot;posting-guildlines post&quot;. 
I&#x27;m almost caught up now, plus I deleted a bunch of spam and 
accidental double posts while I was at it... don&#x27;t I feel good about 
myself now :) ? BTW, that flame war between Clancy and Per lasted 
terribly long, I&#x27;m suprised Ron didn&#x27;t put a stop to it. I don&#x27;t 
appprove. At the same time, at least one of the posts &quot;demanding&quot; a 
stop to it, I also felt was out of line. I&#x27;d like to point out that 
it&#x27;s not in any non-moderator&#x27;s place to use &quot;imparative&quot; language 
in telling ppl to stop doing something here. Be nice 
and &quot;suggestive&quot;. Another thing. Personally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 
typically necessary for one person to defend another here; people 
can defend themselves in many cases. It seems a few of us here take 
things a bit too personally perhaps. Those sorts of attitudes 
witnessed earlier can CLEARLY lead to escalating tensions, and who 
here really wants that?

In addition, I&#x27;d like to point out that certain people simple don&#x27;t 
see eye-to-eye, and may never get along with each other - that is 
life. Avoid them. There are people here I avoid. I&#x27;m sure lots of 
people avoid me. I simple accept it as a fact of life. I recommend 
that instead of the *benign* thing Clancy and Per do of &quot;dropping 
the issue&quot; or having a &quot;ceasefire&quot; to just ignore each other. I 
realize that sounds a bit extreme, but I highly recommend it. Life 
will be much simplier that way.

It&#x27;s enevitable, running into people in the world that we just can&#x27;t 
get along with no matter how hard we try... or how open-mided we 
each think we are. COOL?

Weird how, knowing how to solve a sq-1 (as I recently have about a 6

David. You mentioned that you no longer participate in this forum

          <div class="email-content">So Chris..., are you comfortable with 15% of the vids being from a 
single person?

I find that 150 something videos from the same person is rather 
gross and in some ways unfair (when compared to the total number 
that is). I would like to see limitations put into place so that 
that doesn&#x27;t happen. Perhaps it can be category-based, submission-
time-based, how recent it is, the quality of the videos, the solve 
time compared to other videos of the same category, or simply just 
ask the puzzliest which ones they&#x27;d like to be removed. And such a 
limitor could be raised as the total number of videos increases 
surely.

So that&#x27;s my *opinion*; it&#x27;s your space/bandwidth and you should do 
with it as you see fit of course. *overtly sidesteps another 
possible flame war, LOL* Either way, I&#x27;d like to hear you address 
this point.

Curious, me being such a computer geek and all..., what is your 
current space limitation and are you hosting them on your own local 
servers, Chris?

Another thing, you have a limit on the total size of a single file 
that may be submitted right? (it was the case the last time I 
checked) Well, I had at one time wanted to submit a rather large 
file, but 150 small clips takes up way more space than a single 
large one in this case. I want to make a higher quality 5x5 clip... 
or maybe even a really time-consuming 4x4 bld if I get ambitious 
enough, now that would be interesting to have online. So how fair do 
people think that is?

Anyhow, congrats on the 1000 videos, and I have no doubt that you 
will soon break 2000!

At this point, I have no issues with a person having several videos online.
When space becomes an issue, I will limit the amount of videos each person

I&#x27;m currently using an external web host and I&#x27;m very pleased with the

I accept videos of any size or format. All videos are processed by me
manually before uploaded to the server (which is why it takes a few days
sometimes). Videos are converted to WMV 320x240. Video size is usually ~1MB
per 30 seconds. I once asked people to limit video length to 5 minutes, but
that limitation is no longer there.

Hey, 

Thanks for reading it. I remember the typo; I copied it to an applet 
once, and the applet didn&#x27;t work, because of that F/F&#x27;. I changed it 
in the applet, but apparently, I forgot to chance the text. I&#x27;ll 
modify it :).

Exactly how advanced are you? Can you give me a description about how 
long you have been cubing, what methods you use/algorithms you 
know... How much PLL/OLL&#x27;s do you know?  Plus:  What parts were very 
clear to you, and what parts are not clear?

The reason I made this tutorial for &#x27;advanced&#x27; cubers, is: there&#x27;s no 
point in making a blindfold tutorial for people that can&#x27;t solve a 
cube with their eyes open (I think). The same idea applies to people 
who only just started. I would advise cubers to first practice until 
they can solve the cube in at least 30-40 seconds before starting 
with my tutorial. This is of course, just a general guideline.

Thanks,

Joël.

Rubik&#x27;s Cube certainly lends itself better to graphical representation<br>

The metric was my first reason for this. Because I&#x27;m using a method 
(still learning, I know some 100+ cases of the about 300 total) where 
I do CLL and also orient the edges in one go. there I use a lot of 
turns like M+L2 and if I&#x27;m counting ATM my solves are about 3-5 turns 
shorter than if I&#x27;m counting STM. Using my FS-F2L instead of Fridrich 
I can get averages down to about 45 ATM (but not as fast as if I&#x27;m 
doing Fridrich =)

This may be a bit of topic but maybe intresting anyway?

Here is an example alg : r U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; M+R2 U2 R (16 QTM, 11 HTM, 
10 STM, 9 ATM)

The alg is based on the usual pi-OLL. and I&#x27;m using it to solve the 
CLL pi case where all corners are permuted already and I also orient 
two edges at the same time.

The same idéa for orient the edges while doing CLL is applicateable 
on many algs, just insert a M-turn before or when starting a &quot;R U R&#x27; 
U&quot; (or similair) and then restore it when possible or else, after the 
main part of the alg, like in this sune variation R+M U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; 
U M&#x27;.

Gotcha there. I started working on that type of CLL a few years ago 
when I meant up with another cuber summer of 2002, who made the 
suggestion. I used to know a lot more, but ever since I started doing 
ZBF2L ~95% of the time I don&#x27;t get to practice that alg set much and 
forgot some important ones.

The example alg you give, I&#x27;ve actively used for several years and 
still use today. I like seeing more people thinking &quot;outside the box.&quot;

I used ELL/CLL for a few years before I switched to a more COLL 
approach. 45 ATM is still a bit long to me. I use an F2L system that 
is more ATM count friendly though compared to the popular way of doing 
it... I think I was around 40 ATM if I go back to using ELL. However, 
those ELL alg as rather &quot;clunky.&quot; Some of mine took me longer than 5s 
for me to execute.

I&#x27;m well aware that I&#x27;m about 25 years to late to actually &quot;invent&quot; 
anything =)

But I like to spread good idéas.

// Kenneth

BTW: forgot to write about one of my tricks for CLL + edges 
orientation. If your CLL ends in R&#x27; F R F&#x27; (or similair) then do L&#x27; U R 
U&#x27; M&#x27; instead and you do not orient any edges in the end of the alg. 
Example: CLL = R U2 R&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F R F&#x27;  COLL = R U2 R&#x27; U2 L&#x27; U R U&#x27; M&#x27;

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Thanks for replying.

Maybe I should be more clear about orientation indeed. Well, in 
fact, I don&#x27;t really memorise orientations. The only time I&#x27;d do 
that is when an edge is flipped in it&#x27;s position, but even then, you 
don&#x27;t have to think about this as a &#x27;flipped&#x27; piece.

Really, when learning the method, you should forget the 
word &#x27;orientation&#x27; as it is distracting.

I&#x27;ll modify it though.

Arxon was one of Ideal&#x27;s marketing brands in Germany. Ideal made
Rubik&#x27;s Game in 1982. They went out of business.

Both are available regularly on eBay. The Game cube is far superior,
and usually sells for less than the Arxon in the sealed versions. You
can&#x27;t tell the Arxon cube without the packaging, but it had pretty
much the same quality as the Ideal cubes made in Hungary, England and
Hong Kong.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
Recently I checked a lot of videos of very fast cubers, to spot <br>
possible improvements.<br>
I think Gungz has shown that pure finger speed is very important.<br>
But he and some other fast cubers have one more thing in common: a 1 <br>
second break after the cross. It looks like after the cross they take <br>
a good look around the cube to find several pairs. After that they <br>
solve F2L in one flow of fast moves.<br>
<br>
This week I tried it too. Taking a 1 second pause, even if I spot a <br>
pair already. IMHO it works! Setting 12-14 second times is easy like <br>
this. A minute ago I finished my first two official rules averages of <br>
the week: 13.19 and 13.17. Very consistent times, and without any <br>
effort. Not world class, but hey, I am 39! :-)<br>
<br>
Please try it also, and tell me about your results.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

That is a really nice observation.  After reading your message I also
have started practicing this way.  It feels a bit weird, but so far I
like it a lot.

<br>
I just took an average and got sub-15 trying to pause for about 1<br>
second after the cross.<br>
<br>
16.22, (13.06), 14.61, 13.15, 14.42, 14.10, 13.23, (18.54), 16.60,<br>
13.73, 13.51, 16.33 = 14.59<br>

For me sub-15 is quite exceptional, so I plan on trying to do this in<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Ryan, that was what I was getting at, just didn&#x27;t think I needed to explain.  Sorry about that.  I think the 1 second could definitely be reduced some.  Yes, it is helping look for pairs, but with further practice, that looking can be reduced, at least a little time, maybe not a full .75, but a half second.

  I understand, and agree.

  If we go back in history about 5 years when many of the best people here
  were averaging closer to 20 seconds, they had discovered that if they
  slowed down, they would actually finish with a faster time.

  Now these same people are closer to 13 seconds, and indeed they are
  twisting more quickly than they were 5 years ago.

  &quot;Slowing down&quot; was the training method, but the lesson was to train the
  mind to actively look out for certain things to improve decision making.
  Now they can do the same thing at higher speeds than 5 years ago.

  Similarly, &quot;breaking for 1 second after the cross&quot; is the training
  method to learn the underlying lesson. I see no reason why this 1 second
  couldn&#x27;t be reduced in another 5 years.

Actually, if you are not a master of F2L (like me), then the passage

the whole solve, I loose a lot of time there.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody,<br>
 <br>
Firstly, apologies to the speedcubing group, if you are uninterested in FMC<br>
then please do not bother with this post, I only posted in here to more<br>
quickly get hold of some of the regular readers of both your group and the<br>
FMC group.<br>
 <br>
I am really sorry for my prolonged period of absence and negligence with the<br>
FMC pages for the past few weeks. I can only offer in my defence that I have<br>
been snowed under with both university work, and work work, followed by a 10<br>
day stint in Germany, and then food poisoning! :(<br>
 <br>
I&#x27;m sorry that you had to also post your results in the FMC forum, when they<br>
should have been readily available on the website.<br>
 <br>
All the results have been posted now (bar the Xmas ones, again sorry!), and<br>
the ratings have been updated. FMC 140 was an amazing week, despite<br>
everything we still had 13 entries! plus 2 computer generated ones,<br>
unapproved of course. <br>
 <br>
I hope to see you all for FMC #141, which will kick off at midnight on<br>
Monday 12th Feb :) at www.cubestation.co.uk <br>
 <br>
All the best,<br>
DanH :)<br>

In my opinion, they&#x27;re not quite smooth enough, and here&#x27;s what you
can do with that kind of cubes, to give them the smoothness they deserve:

&gt; &gt; Hello,<br>
&gt; &gt; I was reading about blindfolding for a few weeks already, but I<br>
&gt; &gt; really started<br>
&gt; &gt; practicing/learning this past weekend (using Tyson&#x27;s tutorial,<br>
&gt; that I<br>
&gt; &gt; found more<br>
&gt; &gt; intuitive in describing and adapting the effect of the algorithms).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; After only a few days I was able to consistently orient corners<br>
&gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; edges and<br>
&gt; &gt; permute corners in a reasonable time.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Before moving to the hardest/longest part (permuting edges), I&#x27;ve<br>
&gt; &gt; been practicing<br>
&gt; &gt; a few scrambles a day but sometimes I don&#x27;t quite see how to<br>
&gt; permute<br>
&gt; &gt; pair of<br>
&gt; &gt; corners easily.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Maybe it&#x27;s really simple and I&#x27;m just blind... ;)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; For example, how would you invert?<br>

  contests accept one. I know that there are a lot swedish cubers that
  are registered members of the swedish cube site, svekub.se, that
  hasn&#x27;t yet competed and he might be one of those. I&#x27;ll try to find out
  who it is.

googling his youtube nick i found this. 
http://dubremix.wordpress.com/2006/10/23/rubiks-cube/

A short translate: 
Aparently one of our local IRC operators are realy good on Rubiks
cube. Hi admit that hi has cheated a bit. I think he memorized all the
twists. 
And then a link to a video of Tyson and som info about Tobys world
record. 

His name on IRC (quakenet) is HellMagic and first name seems to be Tomas.

I&#x27;ve asked many cubers, and it seems that very few cube solvers like<br>
sudoku, It&#x27;s a bit strange.<br>
They are 2 rather different puzzles, since the puzzle is physical,<br>
mechanical , and so special.<br>
But after solving many sudoku grids during the last months, I find in<br>
it the same kind of interest. It&#x27;s about seeing the configurations<br>
fast and imagine lucky tricks based on a few patterns.<br>
<br>
If sub-15 is considered as a good 3x3x3 time, I wonder what a good<br>
time would be for an evelish grid.<br>

Take a look at mine: 

Scramble: R B&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R B2 L F U2 R U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; F U2 F2 L&#x27; U L&#x27; B2 F2 R L&#x27;
F&#x27; L

Cross colour = D

Double x-cross: y2 x r&#x27; F U&#x27; y r U2 r&#x27; R U&#x27; R2 U R&#x27; (11)

F2L 3: U2 L U L&#x27; (4)

F2L 4: R U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; (7)

OLL: (R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R) U&#x27; (8)


BTW Gungz got the scramble from me lol

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan!

That three-cycle of edges is the exact algorithm I found &amp; use 
myself :). 

After I saw it became a 3-cycle... And looking at the length of the 
whole video, and thinking about the creator of the video, I was 
guessing the T-Perm was also gonna come up somewhere in the video :D.

A long while ago I actually had a file that had all the PLL&#x27;s, and 
the angle where to start from to get 1 step closer to the solution.

It&#x27;s very funny that such a brilliant guy like you invents something 
I did a long while ago :D... (Just joking, eh?)

The other one was from the same seller and contained two gyro cubes,
but no deluxe:

          <div class="email-content">$59 for 11+ cubes, not bad.  You could easily re-sell for more than that.

  Yes that was one of them.
  The other one was from the same seller and contained two gyro cubes,
  but no deluxe:

irc://irc.ircstorm.net/rubik (for those of you with an IRC client) or
http://strangepuzzle.com/chat.php

His nick on that network is tomasu if any of you want to chat with
him. His full name is Tomas Kristiansson and he is indeed from Sweden.

I believe he said the solve was a memorized scramble, but I&#x27;ll have to
double check with him. He was contacted by Hyundai via youtube, and
they took the last few seconds of his video to use in the commercial.
I am not sure if he is a member here, but if he is not I can forward
any more questions to him, or catch him on one of the two IRC networks.

The three ways I was thinking of are

A. Pre-memorize. That is, look at the cube before you start the  
camera. Any blindfold solver can do this in a few minutes. Clearly  
impossible to catch.
B. Rehearse the solve. The obvious extension of A. Keep doing  
blindfold solves of a position until you&#x27;ve reached the fake time  
you&#x27;re aiming for. If you make sure to use an actual blindfold method  
rather than something else, this is undetectable as well (&quot;hellsna&quot;  
used a speed solving method, which gave his treachery away).
C. Use a see through blindfold. All blindfold solvers seem to hold  
the cube where they would be looking if the blindfold *was*  
transparent, so that should be very hard to detect as well, but you  
need to not make any obvious &quot;looking&quot; moves.

This seems pretty impractical, unless the solver just isn&#x27;t a cuber  
and needs detailed instructions. It couldn&#x27;t be used to beat any  
speed records.

This is the same as 1 with more deceptive technology. I see how it  
could be useful to deceive a live audience. But not for making fake  
blindfold videos.

And THANX for FINALLY making me understand how Criss Angel did his  
blind driving in Vegas!!

Yep. And it won&#x27;t look like a blindfold method.

This is a combination of my main ideas (A &amp; B), so we agree on that.  
It&#x27;s completely undetectable and easy to do without any need for help  
from potential witnesses.

Except that the good ones are unspottable if executed reasonably  
well. I&#x27;d fall back the excuse that the bad guys already know these  
tricks, so letting the masses know helps in making us less gullible.  
But mostly it&#x27;s just an interesting thing to talk about.


I think the realistic approach is to just accept these videos as  
entertainment, and use competitions to judge how fast people actually  
are.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, last week I found a nice algorithm for a PLL case (the Y case in<br>
Fridrich&#x27;s web). I have been loking for this algorith in several webs<br>
but I haven&#x27;t found it. The algorith is the following one:<br>
<br>
(U&#x27;) B&#x27; R B R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R2 U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R F&#x27;<br>
<br>
Using two layers twist (first you have to rotate the cube for put the<br>
face B in U):<br>
<br>
U&#x27; R U l&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R2 U R&#x27; U&#x27; l&#x27; U R U&#x27;<br>
<br>
You can see this movements using a applet in my forum:<br>
<br>
http://www.rubikaz.com/foro/viewtopic.php?t=2653<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to know if somebody had seen this algorithm before. I think<br>
that it is very good.<br>
<br>
Note: Observe that I am applying two OLL algortihms but it is<br>
different to this one (the number of movements is different):<br>
<br>
F R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;- F&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;- R&#x27; F R F&#x27;<br>

Wow. That&#x27;s pretty impressive.

If you want to make it look like a &quot;solo&quot; blindfold solve, it  
probably has to be quite a bit slower, though?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

I find that Rubik&#x27;s Lube is good for the present day cubes made under
license to Seven Towns - Winning moves, Milton Bradley, Hess
(Rubiks.com) DIYs, but not for the older Ideal cubes.
It&#x27;s slick for the new cubes, and lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s too
tacky for the older cubes - slows them down. 

YMMV

          <div class="email-content">Upon closer inspection I&#x27;d say that you are correct. 
The one on the right looks to be a clone of the Gyro!
I thought the color of the photo was off, but you&#x27;re right about the
roundness, and also the tiles on the one on the right are slighly larger.

Related to this: last year I found clones of Wonderful Puzzler cubes,
which were themselves clones of Ideal&#x27;s.

Just by some lube in a car shop (except the special type that will destroy
your cube, I do not know the reference...please someone help me on this :p)

So I think the 2nd option is really good. Your lube bomb will last

&gt; That&#x27;s a really great functionality you added. I&#x27;m suprised no one has <br>

<br>
Maybe it is too difficult to devise a set of generators and input them<br>
every time, so I&#x27;ll think about adding a bookmark feature so that you<br>
can save a setup and come back to it. Then I could also provide some<br>
presets for PLL, OLL, F2L drills, etc...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey people,

I wanted to post this anyway, but this is the thread where it fits 
most...:

Usually, we see videos of people solving cubes blindfolded recieving a 
lot of criticism. People say: &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s played backwards&quot;, or &quot;Look at 
that thing on the white sticker, he can feel it&quot;. I must say, really 
interesting how humans make up their own explanations for something 
they don&#x27;t believe; i&#x27;ve seen real original theories. If anyone wants 
inspiration on how to make fake blindfold videos, I suggest you lookup 
Tysons video (the one that wasn&#x27;t really meant to go over all of the 
internet).

But here is something completely different, and also kind of funny: In 
this video, all the cubers are saying it&#x27;s fake, and this one guy, who 
claim to know the guy in the video, has to &#x27;dissapoint&#x27; al us cubes. 
He knows for fact that it&#x27;s real, because he knows this guy :). Take a 
look:

You should figure this out quickly, or push back the date.  I&#x27;d prefer that

I must say though, I owe Leyan a lot.  He has a &quot;finger-tricked&quot; scramble,
and he&#x27;s helped me look good in front of girls at bars because I&#x27;ve done his
scramble blindfolded several times.  He&#x27;s a great friend watching my back!

(Sadly, I have no confidence on the dance floor.)

&gt; U&#x27; F&#x27; B&#x27; D F&#x27; B&#x27; (you can imagine my surprise at this point...)<br>

The second part... (R2 D&#x27; U F2 D2 U2 B2 D&#x27; U R2) can be done faster as <br>
(M2 E M2 E). However, that scramble was extremely unlikely given that <br>
it is at most 10 STM from solved position (8 in Axle Turn Metric...).<br>

          <div class="email-content">This was really cool. I definately learned something from watching it. 
Although I think the optimal algs for 3-cycle of edges is not too hard 
to memorize and is much faster. The H-Perm for sq-1 is fairly trivial. 
I do (try to) speedsolve sq-1, but I&#x27;m always suprised to run into 
things like T-Perm and end up doing it the long way (as a J-Perm and 
then edges). I also never knew an alg for 3-cycle of corners. Now I 
will start using this idea in my speedsolving.

Not counting this, I only use 6 algs for speedsolving (a circular 4-
edge cycle, 3 algs for edges without parity, and J-Perm and N-Perm). 
I&#x27;ve been albe to get several sub-1 minute times this way. How would 
you do E-Perm using your idea?

Oh and btw, I think that was the first time I heard you speak. Your 
English is not bad at all.

          <div class="email-content">Wow! I&#x27;m *very* impressed.

I love solving sudokus, especially the very hard ones. I can only go 
at half your speed though I estimate. Maybe even only a third. I think 
Hardwick is somewhat interested in sudokus as well. However, I think 
solving one on a computer is like solving a cube on the computer... 
too slow and not nearly as fun. (Although Ryan&#x27;s java applet might be 
a good conter-example.) I much rather solve on paper.

I&#x27;m curious, are you faster or solwer on paper and by how much?

Are there Sudoku competitions you go to? You seem to very experienced. 
I generally don&#x27;t pause as much though, I continue go around leaving 
more clues if I can&#x27;t proceed, even though they might not be terribly 
helpful. Maybe that&#x27;s something I need to change...

How long would it take you to solve a random websudoku puzzle at the 
Evil level on paper? This is a good way for me to guage your true 
speed. I solve about 10 of them per day and have not been getting any 
faster.

Yes, that&#x27;s why in a video, you should make very obvious the scramble is
perfectly random.

printer.
I &#x27;ve been practicing for a few months on a french site,
http://e-sudoku.fr. Daily online competitions are very challenging! 4
grids a day (different difficulties), 1000 competitors, daily and
weekly rankings. I was ranked 11th last week, my method has started to
pay, so I&#x27;m not a newbie anymore, but I feel that a professional
speed-sudokist would be much much faster.
I remember I couldn&#x27;t stand the interface at first. Pen and paper were
more friendly and faster. But when you get used to it, multiple
candidates appear more clearly, and the eraser is cleaner.

That&#x27;s one of those which take four repetitions. I don&#x27;t remember how 
to do them. I just try to connect neighbours correctly to get closer 
to solved.

You people with the English. It never ends.

Yeah I watched those final episodes a few days ago.

Oh and you don&#x27;t hear my many bad attempts, from recording the first 
piece to finishing the whole video it took me about four hours.

About the countries where people are from, I recently started using

Yes, Thibaut averaged 13.51, and the day before, we saw him averaging
sub-13.

How is it possible? He&#x27;s cheating, obviously! Everytime. That&#x27;s the
only explanation.

<br>
So I&#x27;m giving another attempt at starting up a cube club; this time at UT<br>
Austin. I was wondering if anyone who has started a successful club has any<br>
suggestions as to how to run a meeting, or the club in general. I tried once<br>
before to teach the cube in front of a group, but it didn&#x27;t work out too<br>
well (though I did bring in a few people). I&#x27;m thinking if I can get enough<br>
people involved here, we can have more competitions here in the Texas area<br>
(there hasn&#x27;t been one that I know of since the Caltech Dallas competition).<br>
Any help is appreciated. I really want to make this work.<br>

  Hi,

  I have done an analysis of the 4x4x4 that shows all positions can be
  solved using no more than 68 turns. This is a five-stage analysis like
  others I have done, but this one allows any of 36 single-layer turns
  and any of 27 double-layer turns (adjacent layers turned together) to
  be counted as a single turn.

  Stage 1: 10 turns max.
  Stage 2: 15 turns max.
  Stage 3: 12 turns max.
  Stage 4: 15 turns max.
  Stage 5: 16 turns max.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Patrick,

I&#x27;ll use stage 1 as an example. If you look at the table for Stage 1,
it has three columns.

The &quot;distance&quot; number gives a number for how many turns from &quot;solved&quot;
a position is. The number in the &quot;positions&quot; column gives the number
of positions there are at that distance out of the 1,608,475,077
positions for that stage. Stage 1 solves corner orientation (2187
positions) and puts a set of 8 edges into the set of home positions
for those edges (24!/(16!*8!) = 735,471 positions). Total positions is
2187*735,471 = 1,608,475,077. The table indicates that 1,283,292
require 10 turns to solve. The table accounts for all 1,608,475,077
positions for that stage, so there are no positions that require more
than 10 turns to solve.

Note stage 1 has three &quot;solved&quot; positions. This is because you can put
the white/yellow facelets of the corners onto the U/D faces, onto the
F/B faces, or onto the L/R faces. That is because there are no fixed
centers on the 4x4x4 that you have to align the corners with.

Generally, most positions can be considered equivalent to some other
positions by using symmetry. The &quot;unique&quot; column gives the number of
positions that are unique when using symmetry to group such
symmetrically equivalent positions together. Thus, using symmetry
reduces the number of positions that the computer has to keep track
of, and reduces the amount of storage required to perform the calculation.

The analysis starts with the positions at distance 0, and iteratively
finds all the positions one turn farther away than the positions at
the previous distance.

My first five-stage analysis (for single-slice turns) was described at:

http://cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal/?q=node/view/62

That may provide some additional information if you haven&#x27;t read that
already.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bruce :-)

Just to make sure. You set the search up with those blockturns 
belonging to the list of generators? Or you did a &quot;post-analysis&quot; to 
reduce your earlier numbers by merging singular turns to blockturns? 
I guess that allowing far more generators than previously slowed down 
the search considerably ??

Kind regards,

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

The analyses for the five stages were done from scratch, not from
somehow using the results from the ealier single-slice turn metric
calculation. It used basically the same program code with some
differences to use the larger set of distance-1 moves within each
stage. More distance-1 moves does result in longer execution time, but
I think it&#x27;s only a proportional (approximately) increase in execution
time.

I really like your work with &quot;Thistlethwaite-approach&quot; for 4x4x4 
cube. Would it be possible to carry out similar analysis for axial 
metric? In axial metric every sequence of consecutive turns around R-
L or F-B or U-D axis will count as 1 turn only. So for instance R2 l&#x27; 
or U d2 D&#x27; will both count as 1 turn only! 

Best regards,

When I was at Rutgers Fall, I was talking with someone who also
suggested that metric. There was also some discussion on this forum
recently of that metric with respect to notation systems for big cubes
(especially bigger than 5x5x5). So it seems there is probably enough
general interest in that metric to make it worthwhile. I&#x27;ll probably
consider this in the near future.

There are also quarter-turn metrics that could be computed. I believe
there are also alternative ways of breaking down solving the 4x4x4
into five stages that could be considered. So there are plenty of
possibilities to consider for future calculations of this type.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bruce :-)

For axial metric you would get a rather enormous large number of 
generators: 3*3^4 = 243, but some of these (9) are just cube 
rotations so the total number would be 234 if i&#x27;m correct !!

So, rather than having this enormous number of generators i guess it 
would be possible to instead just go along with the 36 basic 
generators (single layer turns) and just use those algs with shortest 
axial-metric (reduction analysis)as you go along finding best algs 
for each case of the 5 steps. Either way it&#x27;s gonna be a bit more 
dirty than what you have done so far i guess...

Problem with the second aproach is that you may hav to go along with 
sequences longer in normal metric, but that turn out to be shorter in 
axial metric. And maybe you already have a better idea to deal with 
this?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">preach on.  i met my gf in a tattoo shop and i was in the back solving.  she came back there since i changed the music playing over the pa system in there, and she asked me if i could finish it etc, etc...  we started talking a lot online and  eventually i taught her full petrus.  she too averages around 50 or so, and best solve is 36.  and is also very hot, i&#x27;m indeed fortunate :)

the cube i&#x27;m pretty sure also got me my job right now.  my interview consisted of about 10 technical questions on networking, and the other 15 minutes was the VP and operations manager scrambling a cube for me over and over.  ( i had it in my resume in the personal section)  i left pretty sure i had it, and 2 days later they called and offered me the position. :)

First of all, 234 would not be such a big number for a computer to 
handle. The depth of the search would likely be greatly reduced so I 
do not see much of a speed issue. There would however be an 
increased number of bits for each node to to carry its own 
transformation/turning info I suppose.

Secondly, I am not confident of that number. I would hold one corner 
piece fixed and then obtain the number 3*((4^3)-1). This might not 
bold well with the multi-phase approach Bruce has in mind though, 
but does offer a much lower number of 189 for the first twist and 
126 for following twists. Not sure how helpful that was...

36.  and is also very hot, i&#x27;m indeed fortunate :)


Speaking of hot girlfriends...  I meant my most recent non-gf after 
she noticed my cubing skills. (I&#x27;ll leave it to the reader to 
discern why I prefer to use the term &quot;non-gf&quot; when it comes to my 
personal life.) So after a couple of hours of meeting, and much 
alcohol... some bad choices where made, let&#x27;s just say. On a 
sidenote, I did get to see all her tattoos.

Anyhow, I ended up giving her one of my new cubes and told her she 
should learn how to solve it, along with some links to beginner 
sites. I wonder if she ever put in the effort.

In retrospect, I don&#x27;t recall ever successfully teaching any girls 
how to cube (several guys though), despite actually getting a few of 
them cubes for no good reason.

central nbc shows a show called 1 vs 100.  The premise is that 1<br>

The gimmick is that the 100 people, the &quot;mob,&quot; is made up of specific<br>

why not speed cubers?  Most people look upon us with something<br>

          <div class="email-content">They&#x27;re not really all &quot;brainy&quot; questions; there&#x27;s a lot of pop 
culture and such.  When they had a group of 6 &quot;Child geniuses&quot;, they 
were all gone pretty quickly except for one.
And sometimes half the battle is deciphering what the question means.
Then again, in episodes where one of the groups is &quot;Tropicana Girls&quot; 
or something, they&#x27;re usually the ones who go away quickly.

So, I&#x27;m not saying we&#x27;re screwed, but it&#x27;s not like being smart is 
necessarily all it takes.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody,<br>
<br>
Last weekend I went to the New York Toy Fair to help Techno Source intoduce its newest toy, <br>
the Rubik&#x27;s Revolution. You may have seen the video of it on speedcubing.com. I uploaded <br>
pictures from the Toy Fair to my website. You can view them here:<br>
<br>
http://s92824201.onlinehome.us/toyfair2007.htm<br>
<br>
I also appeared on Fox and Friends last Saturday morning (I solved the 3x3 in 10 seconds in <br>
that clip). To see to the video:<br>
<br>
1. Go to www.foxnews.com<br>
2. Click on &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; at the top of the page.<br>
3. Enter &quot;rubik&#x27;s revolution&quot; into the search box.<br>
<br>
Also, you can go to www.rubiksrevolution.com for more info.<br>

  Wow, the timing for this might be very good. I&#x27;ve been talking with 
  the producers at NBC about &quot;Identity.&quot; I will bring it up.

Would you mind sharing your impression of the revolution, and tell us (me)
what it is? I&#x27;ve been to the website several times and I&#x27;ve watched that
video a while back, but I can&#x27;t tell what people are doing. It looks like
the puzzle doesn&#x27;t move at all and you press the centers like the game Simon
or something??

Thanks
-Chris

<br>
Instead of typing &quot;rubik&#x27;s revolution&quot;, just type &quot;rubik&#x27;s&quot;. Also, you must select the &quot;videos&quot; <br>
tab at the top (there is also a tab called &quot;stories&quot;).<br>
<br>
The Revolution is not a &quot;puzzle&quot;; there is nothing that you &quot;solve.&quot; Instead, it&#x27;s a toy that <br>
has 6 built in games that are based on the lights in the centers. The games test your <br>
memory (like Simon), speed, and dexterity, similar to the original cube. There is also a <br>
multiplayer game that involves passing the cube around in a circle. The Revolution <br>
provides challenges that are different from the original yet are still fun. The best part is <br>
that there is no pass/fail to the Revolution; anyone can pick it up and have fun with it. The <br>
game was designed for everyone, not just a group of puzzle-solvers. I find it to be a fun <br>
toy that anyone can have success with.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey sorry but if there is no answer, there are 2 options :

- people don&#x27;t have an answer
- people find your questions too hard (and thus have no answer, so that
makes only 1 option)

But really, there is no reason why the entire group would ignore you
particularly.

Personally I just checked the 5 precedent messages you sent (which did not
receive an answer afterwards), but it&#x27;s just because I either don&#x27;t have
anything to say, either that I don&#x27;t know.

So don&#x27;t fall into depression. :p

Have fun !

          <div class="email-content">Wow, that comment about showbiz clout was in jest, but wow! That&#x27;s
really very neat.

Yes, some of the questions are pure knowledge, but some can be very
tricky.  Yesterday they asked: Which has more sheets?  A) A ream of
paper.  B) A 4 pack of bounty mega rolls, C) All the beds in the MGM
Grand Las Vegas.  (not sure on specifics, but that&#x27;s the jist).  I
mean is there really any way someone could know that for a fact off
the top of their head?  (it was the hotel in this case)

It&#x27;d sure be fun though!

Yes, some of the questions are pure knowledge, but some can be very
tricky. Yesterday they asked: Which has more sheets? A) A ream of
paper. B) A 4 pack of bounty mega rolls, C) All the beds in the MGM
Grand Las Vegas. (not sure on specifics, but that&#x27;s the jist). I
mean is there really any way someone could know that for a fact off
the top of their head? (it was the hotel in this case)

It&#x27;d sure be fun though!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Actually it depends what center you are talking about. For a &quot;corner-
center&quot; you can do like Frank says. For an &quot;edge center&quot; turn 2 outer 
layer about 45 degrees, with the layer with missing centers being the 
innermost of these 2. Then insert the little protruding part of the 
popped center under the middle centers and the cubie should snap into 
place quite easily with a little force.

Best of luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-) Another option is to remove an edge-triplet or tredge. Start 
with removing a wing edge. Then the last 2 edges should come out 
without too much hassle. Be careful not to pop out exceesive cubies 
from the cube :-) Now you have access to the 3 centers behind the 
removed edges. For assembly i now normally first insert the 2 corner 
centers. Then the middle edge and edge-center together as one unit. 
Then i snap the 2 wing edges into the cube one by one ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Ignoring moves that are simply whole cube rotations (and the
identity), I believe there are a total of 3*(4^4-4) = 756 moves in the
axial metric (as Per calls it). As Doug indicates, you can keep one
layer for each axis fixed, and you reduce the moves by a factor of 4
to 189. I think just these 189 moves will allow computing optimum
solutions in the axial metric for stage 1 of the five stages I&#x27;ve been
using. That&#x27;s 3 times the number of block turns for stage 1. Stage 1,
fortunately, has a fairly &quot;small&quot; number of positions, so I don&#x27;t
think it will be too time-consuming to calculate.

For the other stages; the number of moves are greatly reduced because
some layers are restricted to half-turn movements only. These stages
don&#x27;t have full symmetry in the turns allowed (except stage 5), but if
fixing a corner is still valid for these stages, then I think stage 2
will require the use of 100 moves out of the 328 axial metric moves
that would be applicable. I believe the run-time of my program is
approximately proportional to the number of symmetrically distinct
positions times the number of moves in the set of moves that&#x27;s used.
Stage 2 seems to be a very time-consuming stage with 2.7 billion
symmetrically distinct positions, so I think even 100 moves is rather
signifcant. The number of block turns for this stage was 41 so the
time should more than double. So stage 2 may take a few days to run.

I tied to get a video of a feet solve but failed. I had a capture tool 
that at least did work but it was a trial version and it had expired a 
couple of weeks ago. I will look for another one later today.

But if I can make a video I can ensure you a sub 20 solve because I 
have improved and now averages sub 20. My single is 14.47 seconds =) =)

BTW: I also tried solving one Magic using my left hand and one using

Also watch this. Makes me think humanity is doomed, not just because 
of that cube but also because of the unnaturally rolling marbles etc.
http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=2868423

Notice how media already helps selling it as an &quot;update&quot; to the 
original when in reality it&#x27;s a complete downgrade. Everything that 
makes the real Rubik&#x27;s Cube great, is *not* in this new thing.

They actually call it an &quot;electronic Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; when it&#x27;s no 
Rubik&#x27;s Cube at all. Can we sue them for violating their own patent/
copyright/whatever?

I so hope people will buy it in masses, realize the deception, and 
return it to the stores.

Thanks, the &quot;videos&quot; tab was the key. Watched it now. That was just 
disgusting. The positive attention this thing gets, particularly in 
combination with the real thing... makes me real angry.

<br>
Thank you!<br>
<br>
&gt; Some points I stumbled on, the whole cube rotations are not very nice<br>
&gt; for my feeling as well as the point that you can see very much of the<br>
&gt; cube...<br>
<br>
As for the rotations, I&#x27;m using the same idea as the puzzlingaddiction<br>
cube, where you hold a key and make a move to turn the entire cube,<br>
except that in my cube it&#x27;s Ctrl and in the puzzlingaddiction<br>
simulator it&#x27;s Shift. Although it feels cumbersome, if you keep one<br>
hand on the Shift/Ctrl part of the keyboard and another hand on the<br>
mouse, you can do half turns and cube rotations with very little delay<br>
(with practice, of course).<br>
<br>
Also, you can hold the / button to see the back of the cube if you<br>
want. Keep in mind that if you make turns while you&#x27;re looking at the<br>
back of the cube you will turn on the normal cube (though I may change<br>
this).<br>
<br>
I know that recognition is (and will always be) harder than it is for<br>
the Gabbasoft cube, but I prefer the cube to be in an isometric view<br>
for better recognition of individual stickers (especially on large<br>
cubes) and a faster &#x27;max speed&#x27; (while doing algorithms) since you can<br>
see where you have to drag to turn any side. If you don&#x27;t like the<br>
isometric view, my cube simulator may not be the best one for you.<br>
<br>
&gt; I realy like the speed of it though!<br>
<br>
Thanks again!<br>

relationships and cubes), my cube appeared in some of our wedding
photos, e.g. http://peter.stillhq.com/wedding/Wed6.jpg  Tehehe! BTW,
Peter may look annoyed in this photo, but he&#x27;s not, it was just all part
of the fun. We (including the photographer) all thought it was hilarious
to include some cube shots. :)

I&#x27;m pretty sure my cubing didn&#x27;t have anything to do with Peter and I
getting together. However, it&#x27;s good thing that Peter finds my cubing
obsession to be quirky and interesting!

So, the cube has never led to a relationship for me, but it has led to
free stuff. The most recent being a free cocktail at a DC bar 2 weeks
ago. I was demo-ing to a friend when the waiter walked past. The waiter
thought it was so cool that he called lots more waiters over to watch,
and also grabbed his digital camera and asked to record me solving (to
which I agreed). After this, he brought over a free cocktail! :)

I&#x27;m half way though the photos and saw the video clip of you. &quot;It 
would take a team of scientists to do that.&quot; LOL. (I think one

As for the &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Revolution&quot;... it&#x27;s kinda large looking and I&#x27;m 
still waiting to be convinced it&#x27;s not just some glorified &quot;boop it&quot; 
toy. It has a built-in speaker I see. So who among us is getting

Oh, I finally saw that car commercial that is a parody of that one

          <div class="email-content">I strongly agree with every point Stefan makes here. Although instead 
of &quot;we drop&quot; they should be the ones forced to drop it. Gosh, would 
Mr. Rubik himself really approve of such &quot;weakly-related spin-offs&quot;? 
Perhaps he sold the rights to his name to Seven Towns and they are to 
blame?

Either way, someone is profitting way too much from exploiting the 
image of our beloved cube.

Erm... still with I was there for that Toy Fair, heck I didn&#x27;t even 
know about it till it was over. I love NYC.

I think you mean &quot;inserts,&quot; I&#x27;d reserve the term &quot;tiles&quot; for just the 
plastic pieces that cover the paper inside. And from what I saw over 
at twistyforum, they tend to do the same. Sometimes to be explicit I 
say things like &quot;8 tile-halves&quot;.

I do think that fully water-resistant Magics would be great to have 
around...

I&#x27;m part of the cube enthusiast community and after reading about <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Revolution and watching some videos, I have two questions:<br>
<br>
- As far as I understand, the Revolution can&#x27;t be twisted. Can you <br>
tell why it was made look like the original Rubik&#x27;s Cube?<br>
<br>
- It seems to be quite similar to a toy called &quot;Brain Warp&quot;. Do you <br>
know that one and can you tell the differences between the two toys <br>
besides the Rubik&#x27;s Cube shell? If you don&#x27;t know Brain Warp, here&#x27;s <br>

It does not work as it should on a Swedish keyboard layout. The 
keys &quot;/&quot; and &quot;+&quot; is not located at the same places as for a US 
keymap. So I can&#x27;t make a bigger cube, just a smaller :-( The same 
keys are at the numeic keyboard too but those does not wor either 
(well, not for me at least)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m relatively new to cubing, and recently bought a Rubik&#x27;s brand 5x5. <br>
I&#x27;ve read that although some are good, some aren&#x27;t and will never be <br>
good for speedcubing. Is there a way I can tell which category mine <br>
falls into, without lubing and a lot of breaking in? Obviously that&#x27;d <br>
make it non-returnable, and if it&#x27;s a bad one I&#x27;d like to be able to <br>
trade it in.<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] New NxNxN simulator


  I programmed an NxNxN Rubik&#x27;s Cube simulator in Java. It&#x27;s different
  than the puzzlingaddiction.com and gabbasoft simulators in that the
  view is isometric - you can always see three of the faces equally.
  The program uses a click-drag interface; you can hold keys to do half
  turns or to turn the entire cube.

  I&#x27;ve gotten some pretty good times with it (nonlucky sub-6 on 2x2x2,
  2:33 on 5x5x5). If you don&#x27;t like the squashed look of the
  puzzlingaddiction.com cube, or the slow turn speed of the gabbasoft
  simulator, I encourage you to check this out.

  You can find it at
  http://www.mzrg.com/java/IsoCubeSim/index.shtml&lt;http://www.mzrg.com/java/IsoCubeSim/index.shtml>
  (Please read the documentation before you ask questions.)

  This is my first major Java program, so constructive criticism is
  welcomed.

          <div class="email-content">This is a very common question. There is plenty of information on 
websites about this, you just have to look around.

It is well known that those cubes do not have regular screws; they 
emply rivets instead and are not user-adjustable (with few 
exceptions). The Meffert&#x27;s Assembly cubes are not allowed for 
competition and in general, we as a community don&#x27;t endorse them for 
speedcubing (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). They are prone to lock-ups 
due to their stricter alignement requirements. Plus, their tiles are 
not fun to work with at all, and they do not have screws or metal 
parts whatsoever.

Assuming you are a beginner to advanced..., I would recommend a DIY 
cube.

beginner solution is, in my opinion, an excellent way to get a

started out on a somewhat different method, the second one on Mark 
Jeays&#x27; site. It&#x27;s much more intuitive and requires even less

not lead as well into a more advanced method.
Jasmine&#x27;s beginner solution:

Mark Jeays&#x27; solution page:

Other than that, make sure that you fully understand the notation and 
the idea that the center pieces are stationary, and keep trying until 
you get it. If your experience is anything like mine, you&#x27;re likely 
to mess up a few times at first, even if you understand it. Good luck!

Well, you don&#x27;t want to extract it to a folder. You have to try to get<br>
the .jar file to run. Try right-clicking; there should be a &quot;run&quot;<br>

Yeah, it works great!  It&#x27;s an excellent program.  This is just a personal preference, but I like 
the ability to freely rotate the cube such as in http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/JPuzzler/
JPuzzler.html.  Maybe if you ever rewrite the program you could make this an option.  
Seriously though, great work!

There is nothing wrong with the method that is illistrated on 
rubiks.com. That 8 step method on video illistrates a perfectly 
legitamate and easy to follow method. It does take some figuring out 
to make sure you are prepared for all the possible cases that can 
occur after each step, but that&#x27;s part of the fun of it.

It&#x27;s a good building block to the full Fridrich method, so it will 
certainly not be a waste of time for a beginner who wants to 
eventually become sub-30.

I just gave it a few tries and got 68.78, 58.40, 56.19, and 61.23 
seconds.

So what do you mean by &quot;takes too long&quot;? Learning anything for the 
first time that is worth while to learn is sure to take a long 
time... becasue if it didn&#x27;t than everyone would know how to do 
it. :)

Another piece of advice..., do not try any spray adhesive. I tried it 
a year ago and it left a big mess. My reasoning was to have something 
not permenent that holds well. It did not hold too well and left too 
much of a mess.

&gt;<br>
<br>
I recommend the following:<br>
<br>
A common OLL alg is FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;. I really hope you know Singmaster <br>
notation by now, and if not look it up and master it first... This alg <br>
is easy to remember since it is just F-(the move)-F&#x27; where <br>
the &quot;trigger&quot; RUR&#x27;U&#x27; is commongly refered to as simply &quot;the move&quot;. <br>
This will take care of the problem when there are two flipped edges <br>
located front and back.<br>
<br>
So for your case of all 4 flipped, I would do it twice, and then turn <br>
the whole cube a quareter turn in any direction about the U-D axis, <br>
and then execute once more. Not even close to optimal, but this alg <br>
can be done quite fast (roughtly 0.8 sec I reckon).<br>

*makes comments as I watch*:

And in response to the &quot;everybody who&#x27;s good at cubing is good at 
math,&quot; I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s not true the other way around sadly.

&quot;six axes&quot; sounds misleading to me. I&#x27;d go with &quot;six axels&quot; 
or &quot;three axes&quot;. Any one with a different opinion? It still dones&#x27;t 
sound right to me... erm.

&quot;No job, no friends, and a cube&quot; sounds like my life this month.

Whow! that was pre-cube tat for Clancy...

Leyan&#x27;s ~5 turns/s, I&#x27;d say.

&quot;Wierdos&quot;? AWH, that&#x27;s a terrible thing to say about us.

&quot;Solved infront of 1,000 staff members&quot; OMG, that would have been 
terrifing for me.

This video seems to focus on S.F. cubers. Yet Grimsley is missing, 
and that&#x27;s a shame, cuz he&#x27;s freakin&#x27; hilarous on video.

I like the simplistic black and white text inserts, and the crisp 
choice of font for the clip.

Any word on the status of other cube documentaries folks?

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t&#x27; know exactually the answer to your question.
But what I do know is that it usually takes quite some time to make a good
competition cube.

So you shouldn&#x27;t decide to throw it away right now only because it turns a
little bit badly.
Actually, it is quite common that they turn pretty badly at the beginning.

To ease things up, you can always use some lube. But even so, during the
first few days/weeks, it will still turn very well.

To sum up : Just use it. It should turn better with time. ;-)

Good luck !

          <div class="email-content">My 5x5x5 is from Toronto 2003, and it has only been a really nice
competition cube for the past few months. I have used lots of lube on
it, played with it lots, and also taken the time to cut all of the
wing edges so they pass through the center-edge pieces more smoothly.

Sadly, it&#x27;s already becoming a bit too loose, and during a recent
demonstration I had a cube explosion, very similar to Lars at German
Cube Day :)

So to sum up, only time will tell whether your cube will be superb or
not, and it would be impossible to tell without using the puzzle.
Unfortunately, the cube/mechanism quality isn&#x27;t sufficient (in my
experience at least) to render the cube useful for any long period of
time (especially compaed to the amount of time taken to break it in)

All the best,
DanH :)

          <div class="email-content">Just a small point to mention, checking out Ton&#x27;s great page from the
link below just reminded me of it.
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Speedcube/makinga.htm

I bought some DIY cubes from Gilles van den Peereboom recently, and
after putting them together extremely carefully, I was surprised to
find that they performed amazingly well. Before that, I had only seen
such results from Joel&#x27;s DIY construction skills.

So, spurred on by this success, I sent an email to Dave Hedley Jones,
to ask him if he would kindly send me some official DIY cube screws so
I could put together another couple of DIY cubes which I had (sans
screws) hidden away in the cupboard. After receiving the screws, I put
te cubes together in exactly the same way, and they were very scratchy
and horrible.

The difference? The screws. Gilles&#x27; DIY screws were long, thin gold
screws, with large, thin, flat heads, and the screw thread only
extended for the bottom third of the screw. The rest of the screw was
smooth. Dave&#x27;s DIY screws were silver, the heads were fat and round,
and the thread was present for the whole length of the screw. It is
easy to see how this probably explains the majority of the difference.
 In short, if you want to put together a top quality DIY cube, make
sure you have screws similar to the first ones, or try out some of the
methods for modifying the screws as described on Ton&#x27;s page.

Hope this helps!
DanH :)

          <div class="email-content">Wow, that&#x27;s kinda impressive to reach such understanding level of DIY cubes.

Well, I&#x27;m glad the ones I bought from Rubiks.com were good ones. :p

(I still have one left of that order, and it&#x27;s already been reserved by
someone. sorry :p)

Maybe he misunderstood you. That sounds like the screws of the 
Studio cubes, certainly not the DIYs you mean. Do they look like this?
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/images/M2_Washer.JPG

Most important question: What&#x27;s the diameter of the heads?  Do they 
fit into the cylindrical hole of the center pieces?

Cheers!

Four yellows on top after F2L? You mean they&#x27;re already oriented so 
you just have to skip the step?

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I&#x27;d like to add that it&#x27;s also possible to unpack .jar files with for 
instance WinRar if you are on the windows-platform. I guess some 
other compression tools may also do this. This will give you a bunch 
of class-files. These again can be decompiled by a number of java 
decompilers. There is no guarantee however that the decompilation is 
done 100% correctly. But in most cases it works, unless some source-
code obfuscation has been actively used. Decompiling will NOT restore 
the original code&#x27;s comments. Comments are naturally ignored when 
making the class-files (bytecode) in the first place.

Michael sent me a new version with &#x27;o&#x27; and &#x27;p&#x27; working as &#x27;+&#x27; and &#x27;-&#x27; 
to change the cube size and it works perfectly :-) Great program, and 
surprisingly small code :D

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody,<br>
<br>
I just finished writing a sweet online tool. I noticed some pages <br>
have like 30 applets on a page, and this is somewhat awkward to <br>
browse through, especially for people who have computers that are <br>
kind of slowish. For example, I loved Leyan Lo&#x27;s bld algorithms <br>
(http://www.its.caltech.edu/~leyanlo/), but I found the amount of <br>
applets on that page a little too much.<br>
<br>
Therefore I wrote a little script where you can input an algorithm, <br>
and the script will generate the HTML codes for the imagecube image <br>
+ a link to an applet in a pop-up window. I first wrote it in c++, <br>
but then Michiel van der Blonk encouraged me to convert this to <br>
PHP.. And since I am no PHP expert, I learned a lot from doing this.<br>

Tell me what you think about it ;).<br>

Since Andy was paid by TechnoSource to promote the product, I don&#x27;t
think any opinion we get from him could be completely honest.

Tyson or Leyan, what are your opinions?

 And in response to the &quot;everybody who&#x27;s good at cubing is good at

 This video seems to focus on S.F. cubers. Yet Grimsley is missing,

Actually, this past Friday Matt Walter and I just happened to visit
the website of the Canadian documentary, Cubers&#x27;, that had laid
stagnant for quite sometime.  To our surprise, the site has been
redone and offers a hint on when it is going to be released. Sadly,
not for another year!

          <div class="email-content">Thank you for the advice, I guess I&#x27;ll just give it a try. I have 
another question, though.
I&#x27;m planning to buy stickers for it from Cubesmith, along with 3x3 
tiles and stickers, but my order isn&#x27;t quite to $10 yet. Would it be 
a good idea to buy a couple of X center pieces for the 5x5, as I hear 
that they are liable to break?
Thanks again,
-Tom

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan,

Yes, I completely agree.
I think the problem is caused by the fact that the bad screws are not 
(automatically) insert completely straight into the kernel. You have to be 
really careful, because when the screws are not correctly aligned, you will 
have many pops on one side, where the other sides feel too stiff.

I recently bought some DIY cubes from Cube 4 You.
See http://www.cube4you.com/catalog_7.html
They have three versions and the one with the long thin screws are way way 
better than the other two versions.

Have fun,

Ron

Subject: [Speed cubing group] DIY 3x3x3 Screws


Just a small point to mention, checking out Ton&#x27;s great page from the
link below just reminded me of it.
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Speedcube/makinga.htm

I bought some DIY cubes from Gilles van den Peereboom recently, and
after putting them together extremely carefully, I was surprised to
find that they performed amazingly well. Before that, I had only seen
such results from Joel&#x27;s DIY construction skills.

So, spurred on by this success, I sent an email to Dave Hedley Jones,
to ask him if he would kindly send me some official DIY cube screws so
I could put together another couple of DIY cubes which I had (sans
screws) hidden away in the cupboard. After receiving the screws, I put
te cubes together in exactly the same way, and they were very scratchy
and horrible.

The difference? The screws. Gilles&#x27; DIY screws were long, thin gold
screws, with large, thin, flat heads, and the screw thread only
extended for the bottom third of the screw. The rest of the screw was
smooth. Dave&#x27;s DIY screws were silver, the heads were fat and round,
and the thread was present for the whole length of the screw. It is
easy to see how this probably explains the majority of the difference.
 In short, if you want to put together a top quality DIY cube, make
sure you have screws similar to the first ones, or try out some of the
methods for modifying the screws as described on Ton&#x27;s page.

Hope this helps!
DanH :)

          <div class="email-content">The Rubik&#x27;s Revolution is basically a collection of six
hit-the-flashing-button games where the buttons are located on the
center of the six faces.  The game has speakers that yell out
instructions or make an exploding sound when you lose.  The cube does
not twist or turn in any way.  The only reason why it has the
trademark Rubik on the product is because the game is cube-shaped and
uses the six Rubik&#x27;s cube colors.  I for one find this game incredibly
childish and somewhat annoying and would not want to purchase one for

          <div class="email-content">yeah from what i&#x27;ve seen its yet another attempt to ride the rubiks name to fortune, in the 80&#x27;s they jammed the name on anything they could to sell more, and it seems that trend is coming back.  this thing is just a cube shaped bop it kind of toy, and really has absolutely nothing to do with cubing.  also i received the same email chris did asking if i&#x27;d like to try it before it was released yadda yadda, and i haven&#x27;t heard anything back still, which isn&#x27;t a big deal because as soon as i found out it wasn&#x27;t cube based at all, i&#x27;m not really interested.  i&#x27;m sad the rubiks name will be further squandered on junk, and am very surprised the boys in corporate allowed this one through.  i&#x27;m also very eager to hear the response to stefans poiniant email :)

          <div class="email-content">I am sorry but I have to disagree with you.

First, how do you determine how a game is good or not ?
I think nobody can say one game is better than another, it is possible to
say that there are differences but I do not think one game can be called
better than another.

Second, maybe the new Rubik&#x27;s Revolution will please new people who
eventually will start playing with the Rubik&#x27;s Cube. Who knows ?

If you want to talk about &quot;ethics&quot; or something like that (&quot;preserving&quot; the
brand), you should have other concers than see the Rubik&#x27;s brand attached
with that new game. What about AIDS medication ? Shouldn&#x27;t it be forbidden
to make money on that ? The discussion will go on forever.

I say : GO GO RUBIK&#x27;s, MAKE MONEY ! :D

yes i am not one to contend which is better, because that is a very subjective idea. however i do believe it is deceptive and they are trying to use a something that doesn&#x27;t even relate to promote this new toy. its not a puzzle or a rubiks cube by any stretch of the imagination so what other reason to make it look like that then to deceive people into buying it.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I always keep a dozen around just in case. Due to the price, I&#x27;ve 
simply purchesed a whole 5x5 for pieces as well. It depends on how 
frequently you break them. When I&#x27;m practicing 5x5 all the time, I 
break 1-2 per week.

In genral, I always inflat my orders on cubesmith up to $10 by 
purchesing the regular 3x3 stickers, you can never have too many of 
those. Plus I resell them to my friends for the same price.

I&#x27;ve never had any other piece break on me, not even 4x4 centers 
(except about half of them on the Meffert&#x27;s brand one I had). The 
second most breakable piece are the corners I hear, but that *should* 
only happen if you have dropped it a few times on a hard enough 
surface. The +centers are easy to lose after a bad pop, but never 
break from what I&#x27;ve heard.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m in the same boat as Dan. I got mine from Toronto 2003 as well 
and it&#x27;s becomming quite loose. True explosions are still very rare 
for me, but I try to be careful by holding on to the center pieces 
that might twist in place during outer-layer turns.

At some point it needs to be retired. So it is a good idea to start 
preping a new 5x5 if you haven&#x27;t already. I have a backup one in 
which my times would probably be 30s slower, a 3rd one that is half-
preped, and some that are brand new.

I&#x27;m considering making a hybrid cube out of a loose one and a tight 
one. Any suggetions folks, on the piece combinations I should be 
trying?

          <div class="email-content">Brillient! I think there&#x27;s always been a need for such a tool for 
cube site creators.  Thanks for this contribution, I will definately 
use it whenever I need a cubeimage.

In the past, I&#x27;d load a page up with java applets before I knew any 
better. Lars&#x27; cubeimage is perfect for speeding up a page without 
losing much integrity.

I like that you didn&#x27;t hard-link the cubeimage php script to your 
website. I think there is way too much stealing of bandwidth that 
occurs this way.

I&#x27;m not sure how obvious of an issue this is, but you allow for 
plenty of illegal choices for the U and F face color selection. I 
was testing it with options such as U=yellow, F=yellow and U=yellow, 
F=white and didn&#x27;t get error messages. There should be a way to 
dynamically error filter in the &quot;form&quot;. Wonder if this is even worth 
changing...

          <div class="email-content">Per&#x27;s right about IE, I&#x27;ve known it for a long time. But just to be 
nitpicky, it&#x27;s not that you should append the &quot;.jar&quot; extension. You 
should get rid of the &quot;.zip&quot; part of it too. There are some minor 
complications there however.

Windows likes to hide extensions by default, and there are many 
levels of this that are possible to set. It is a setting in 
the &quot;Tools > Folder Options... > View&quot; dialogue box. I tend to go 
all out and &quot;Show hidden files and folders&quot;, uncheck &quot;hide 
extensions for known file types&quot;, and even uncheck &quot;hide protected 
operating system files&quot;. I don&#x27;t recommend most ppl do al of the 
above though.

Having files floating around that look like &quot;*.*.*.*&quot; is gross and 
an abomination of FAT32 long filenames I think. I once did a project 
where there was some coding of a FAT driver involved, and I had to 
learn about implementing how hard drives actually store the 
information on a rather low level. (writing code to follow data 
clusters and lots of ickyness) It turns out that without external 
RAM, long filenames are a major overhead (for things like PDAs, cell 
phones, portable media players). Okay I&#x27;m off-topic entirely now.

Similarly there is this thing with &quot;.*&quot; files in linux that I find 
annoying.

I had to order them separately from somewhere else and it came in a 
bag of 1,000. What am I ever gonna do with so many?

I want to point out that the use of washers is optional. Another 
possibility is to use more than one washer per axle in some way. Try 
these differences, they have a dramatic effect ont he feel of the 
final cube and one may be more suitable to one&#x27;s cubing style than 
others.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug &amp; everyone else,

I just modified the script, you can also use it an &#x27;algorithm 
viewer&#x27; now. You can also copy and paste the URL to show someone 
else what an algorithms does.

Thanks for liking the script. I worked pretty hard on this.

About the illegal choices for U and F faces: I know this... If this 
happens, it will only listen to the &#x27;U-face&#x27; setting, and whatever 
it wants to do next for the &#x27;F-face&#x27;. Has to do with lazy coding, 
really, but if you just enter these settings like a pro cuber would, 
it should work fine.

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, you can get free Java decompilers and decompile .class files to view the code.  I am still trying to get this to run on my computer.  I think I need to download the correct Java Env. first.  To make this into an applet, you just have to make each class extend as an applet (if I remember right), then implement the applet onto the page with HTML.

  But there was no .zip part...it opens that box asking where you want the file to be saved and the filename is just JNetCube and file type is ZIP file (or whatever is called)

  I just added .jar and worked : )

  but you better get Firefox anyway : )

  complications there however.

First of all, this is an example of a site like Joel mentioned that <br>

it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve seen it. Something makes me think it was <br>
not <br>

presentation.<br>
<br>
You are going to have to phrase your questions much better to get an <br>
answer because I can&#x27;t make much sence of it. Avoid using words <br>
like &quot;that&quot; unless it&#x27;s obvious what you are refering to. Frankly, I <br>
find post that appear &quot;rushed&quot; like this to be insulting. Think <br>
about <br>
what you are asking first. Instead of using the word &quot;pieces&quot; it&#x27;s <br>
better to indicate &quot;corner&quot; or &quot;edge&quot;. Also, try a few other sites <br>
to <br>
make sure you fully understand our usage of the term &quot;cross&quot;.<br>

I got a very quick, extensive and friendly answer to my above inquiry 
from the Executive Vice President of Techno Source, and upon further 
request he allowed me to post it here. Have a look at it first, I&#x27;ll 
comment below.

--------------------------
Mr. Pochman, 

Thanks for taking the time to contact Techno Source.  Rubik&#x27;s 
enthusiasts are very important to us and we have worked with many top 
speedcubers during the research and development of our new product.

There are a few things I would like to share with you about the 
Rubik&#x27;s Revolution. 

First, it is in no way meant to replace any of the existing Rubik&#x27;s 
items.  The 3x3 cube is one of the greatest toys/puzzles ever made 
and it will continue to be sold everywhere in the world.  We actually 
expect more people will try the 3x3 and other Rubik&#x27;s items due to 
the increased interest our new items has brought to the brand.  So 
there is no need to be concerned that this is our hope, or goal.

Second, we were challenged by the Rubik&#x27;s brand holders to try to 
create an &quot;electronic Rubik&#x27;s cube&quot;.  After much research with people 
of both sexes and all ages, we identified four key criteria for being 
&quot;truly Rubik&#x27;s&quot;.  We started with that essence, and built the 
Revolution from the ground up to embody what is &quot;Rubik&#x27;s&quot; and to 
compliment the existing product by bringing a new way to experience 
Rubik&#x27;s.  We believe we have accomplished this. The Revolution is a 
fun and challenging puzzle that offers a different experience, but a 
Rubik&#x27;s experience.

Third, as to why it can&#x27;t be &quot;twisted&quot;, it can&#x27;t because it is 
different than the 3x3.  However, the tactile experience of moving 
the cube in your hands, and the motion itself, seems to provide a 
feeling that is very much in the spirit of the original.  Which was 
extremely important.

Fourth, I was not aware of the product you sent us a link to.  It 
seems like an interesting game, but it is not nearly as versatile as 
the Revolution which contains many ways to play.  

In the end, I know that for many people, there is only one Rubik&#x27;s 
Cube--the original 3x3.  I can understand why they feel that way.  I 
would agree that nothing can replace that item, and we would never 
try.

However, people who have played with the Revolution have really 
enjoyed it for reasons that are both similar, and different, from the 
3x3.  This includes people from all over the world, of all ages, and 
both genders.  It also includes several of the world&#x27;s top 
speedcubers--and Rubik&#x27;s enthusiasts.  I hope that when the product 
ships this summer, you will also give it a try before you decide 
whether, or not, you will enjoy it.

If you don&#x27;t, that is ok too.  The 3x3 will still be there, as will 
the 4x4, and the 5x5.  We don&#x27;t expect everyone to love our item, but 
we know that many will, and that this will only bring more admiration 
to the Rubik&#x27;s name.

Sincerely, 

Eric

--------------------------

Now it&#x27;s me again, Stefan. My first impression was a positive 
surprise that not only did I get an answer, but one as extensive and 
personal as this. Secondly, I got to realize that maybe they do truly 
just misunderstand what the Rubik&#x27;s Cube is really about.

That is, their understanding differs from mine, and apparently that 
of all the cubers I&#x27;ve seen comment on this so far. For me, Rubik&#x27;s 
Cube is first and foremost a puzzle. Not a toy. The &quot;revolution&quot; is a 
simple toy, unless there&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve missed so far, or they 
have a different understanding of the word &quot;puzzle&quot; (Mr. Levin does 
call the revolution a puzzle, as does their website).

Also, his mail made me aware of a different perspective. It 
sounds like they *started* with the cube and turned it to an 
electronic toy. I saw it as starting with the toy that has nothing to 
do with the cube, and turn it into a cube. Quite the opposite 
direction. Hard to tell what&#x27;s more realistic and whether it matters. 
But it could mean that they were less defrauding and instead more 
incapable of making something really good, with &quot;good&quot; again being 
subjective.

That said, I still think the thing is a blatant deceptive rip-off 
having nothing to do with the cube. Though I mostly blame their 
marketing department. In any case, if they really had contact with 
top cubers during research/development, it&#x27;s hard to believe they 
didn&#x27;t see the negative feedback coming.

Cheers!
Stefan

So who were these top speedcubers?  Andy, it sounds like you didn&#x27;t
get to see this beforehand.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll answer your second question. I personally would recommend Roux 
method which can be found here 
http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html
Not many people use it, and IMHO it can be as fast if not faster than 
the fridrich method. However, if you want to go with the 
mainstream/everyonedoesit method go with fridrich. It&#x27;s proven, and 
very easy to understand, if not too easy at finding pieces and 
executing. Just takes practice. You can find any number of websites 
that teach fridrich.

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

1. Doug is right.
2. My best guess, judging your information and what the document is 
about, is that you mean you can make the cross, but then the corners 
of the bottom layer are not solved. This means that you have to solve 
4 corners; solving 1 corner 4 times.

I don&#x27;t really think this site is intended to be a tutorial. You are 
much better off finding a website that explains more. Use google.

          <div class="email-content">They did send out e-mails to a bunch of speedcubers.  My brother and I 
both got e-mails about the Rubik&#x27;s Revolution, but when we replied, we 
didn&#x27;t get a response.  The person in charge was very buzy setting up 
for the toy fair.  Given the timing of the e-mail, I&#x27;m completely sure 
that even if we had given any suggestions or feedback, there&#x27;s no way 
they would have taken anything into consideration.  By that point, the 
product had already been manufactured  I don&#x27;t really know if they 
consulted any other speedcubers earlier in their process, but my 
thinking is that they didn&#x27;t.

I have no problem with just letting them be.  Let them sell their 
product.  I think if any of us were offered money to promote the 
Rubik&#x27;s Revolution and appear on TV talking about the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, 
we&#x27;d probably take it.  Maybe I&#x27;m wrong?  I guess I was just fortunate 
enough to get media with the actual Rubik&#x27;s Cube.

          <div class="email-content">yea i definitely hate that it is nothing like the rubiks cube.<br>

i think it just goes with the general trend of american society right<br>
now. they keep on dumbing things down for the children. i mean even if<br>
the rubiks cube seems hard, the point is to persevere and gain a<br>
feeling of accomplishment from actually learning something.<br>
now they are just creating a pick up and play version to exploit a<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Yesterday I bought a rubik&#x27;s puzzle that I had never seen before called the Brain Racker.  To <br>
sum things up its a slide puzzle on the surface of a sphere, and instead of squares it&#x27;s built <br>
with equilateral triangles.  At first I was skeptical but after a while I realized it&#x27;s really a pretty <br>
cool puzzle.  I just went on rubiks.com and searched for it, but nothing came back.  Makes <br>
me wonder if the local toy store put it out early.<br>
<br>
All in all, if you see one, I recommend picking it up.  It&#x27;s pretty fun to mess with and there are <br>
a bunch of different &quot;solved&quot; states so it doesn&#x27;t get boring.  <br>
<br>
If I&#x27;m way off though and this puzzle has been around for a while, I just haven&#x27;t seen it just <br>
ignore the message.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Alright then,

ill be more specific. Look at the cube where it says &quot;placing the 
first layer corners.&quot; When I said &quot;what if you dont have 3 peices 
like that?&quot; I am not talking about a line of peices I am talking 
about these peices, The middle green peice, The bottom middle green 
peice, and the bottom right corner. If you do not have these peices 
after you have the white cross then how do you get them into the 
position stated above? Also when I said &quot;3 peices&quot; It does not 
matter what side I am referring too because both sides have 3 peices 
on it, it should have been pretty obvious. When somone says cross on 
a cube it should not be that hard to identify what they are talking 
about, I have checked some websites and the word &quot;Cross&quot; means the 
same thing and shows the same thing on each website.

Like I said, search for a website with more explanation...

We all understand the words cross. We just didn&#x27;t understand what 3 
pieces you were referring to. I am too tired right now (4:21 AM in 
the Netherlands) to explain it all.. If you want to learn how to 
solve a cube, I suggest you go to my website 
(www.solvethecube.co.uk), or find another good tutorial using google.

Another good tutorial is here:

http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html

Good luck,

Joël.

Hey Koen,

That&#x27;s right Koen... This stuff is addictive. I just couldn&#x27;t 
stop... I spent hours looking for bugs in the code, and it cause a 
lot of frustration. So it&#x27;s really nice that you appreciate my 
work :).

I know I should be practicing, but man... I dont know. I guess I 
still have friday and saturday to get back in shape a little.

Cyou!

Joël.

(and not even fast):

- Wow.
- Wow.
- I can&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s doing that while he&#x27;s talking. Unbelievable.

I don&#x27;t know about you guys but I believe these people shouldn&#x27;t be 
allowed to drive a car. Why? Because if they were capable of 
maneuvering a car through traffic, with all the lights and the 
steering, accelerating, breaking and occasional talking, then they 
wouldn&#x27;t be impressed by Andy&#x27;s button pushing at all. Since they 
*are* impressed quite a bit, that tells us their driving skills must 
be like non-existent, and they&#x27;re a danger to everybody else and need 
to be taken off the streets.

I once was worried about today&#x27;s youth, but apparently it&#x27;s the

          <div class="email-content">Yeah Joel,

Ive tried looking up some sites most of them dont explain themselves 
properly. I dont know if you clicked on the link or not but if you 
looked at it you would have seen the 3 peices on both sides. It 
doesnt matter what side I was referring too because both sides have 
3 peices, which are the bottom middle and the middle right and 
bottom right peices. He said &quot;try a few other sites
to
make sure you fully understand our usage of the term &quot;cross&quot;. --- 

like you said we already all know what the term cross meant. So I 
dont know what hes talking about. Well im not saying I dont know how 
to solve a rubiks cube. Its just that the way I solve it, It just 
takes a while to do, so im just trying to find a faster/easier way 
to do it. But I am ok still with the time 2:07 I just think I could 
do it faster. Thanks for the sites though ill check those out.

I fixed the graphics, so that you won&#x27;t have extra pixels in places<br>

cleaner now, especially for the bigger cubes.<br>
<br>
I also added a rectangle that, if you click it, will let you set the<br>
keys for the various operations in the program. As of this version,<br>
you have to set it every time you start the program, but it will only<br>
take a minute, so it shouldn&#x27;t be that much of a problem. There may be<br>
bugs with the dialog boxes themselves; I had to get something done<br>

Not just that, they try to make it sound like this thing is actually 
*better*. That&#x27;s an insulting blasphemy to the real cube. Some quotes 
from their website:

&quot;Revolution&quot;
&quot;the first electronic Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;
&quot;the next Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;
&quot;It is a challenge worthy of the Rubik&#x27;s name.&quot;
&quot;Ideal for puzzle lovers&quot;
&quot;It&#x27;s rare that a follow-up can match or even surpass the original in 
respect to creativity, game play, and fun, but Techno Source has 
developed a product that achieves this feat.&quot;

And some from that Fox video:

&quot;Classic puzzle getting a facelift.&quot;
&quot;The new Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;.
&quot;The Rubik&#x27;s Cube is new and improved.&quot;
&quot;new &amp; improved cube&quot;
&quot;sort of an update cause they don&#x27;t move&quot;
&quot;It does provide new challenges that the old cube doesn&#x27;t offer, for 
example the fact that it&#x27;s electronic&quot;.

I don&#x27;t know whether to laugh or cry.

No cheers...
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Notice how they called the fact that is electronic a challenge. They sure<br>
hit the nail on the head there, though they didn&#x27;t intend to. In the cube<br>
documentary, it pointed out that because it never needs to be charged or<br>
have batteries replace, it was a great puzzle. Now, the puzzle touted as an<br>
&quot;update&quot;, requires batteries and is much less convenient. Plus, how can you<br>
call it an upgrade if it is a completely different product. Its like calling<br>
a Rubik&#x27;s cube an upgrade of the jigsaw puzzle. It doesn&#x27;t make sense.<br>

A little message from Brussels...

The Belgian Open is a succes so far. The ambiance is good, and all 
cubers are getting along really well. Mátyás Kuti broke quite a few 
World Records, including the world record for solving the 5x5 
blindfolded. Watching him was amazing! He&#x27;s really good :).

My best guess more results will follow sunday evening or maybe on 
monday :)..

But I am pretty sure a few reports from competitors will come online in the
following days after the competition.

Today was really really great. Though I could not attend the competition
all day, I witnessed amazing achievements.


More results will follow tomorrow (just keeping you all in the suspens :p)

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody...

I don&#x27;t have full results, but I do have one important newsflash:

The new World Record for solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube is 10.34 seconds. 
Edouard Chambon&#x27;s first solve in the semi-final, if I recall correctly.

Edouard was really in a good shape, very impressive... The finals of 
the 3x3 were exciting, and the top-3 cubers were pretty close 
together. But for details you&#x27;ll just have to wait :P.

Oh, I got 1 tiny little succes: My first official BLD solve with 
Stefan&#x27;s M2 Method... Pretty slow, but it has potential.

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Probably the most incredible record was the 7 blindfold solves in 21 minutes.

During the multipal blindfold, i went for a quick bite. 
With the purpose to see the end of the solves.
When I came back everyone was still memorising there cubes.

Only Matias, the only one who attemt 7, was allready zipping his coke, watching the others.
Also his magic records were incredible. Avering below 1 second is the fastest thing i&#x27;ve ever seen.

He&#x27;s really a rare talent, both incredible fast and perfect and fast memorisation.

And then thinking he&#x27;s only 13 years old.
These won&#x27;t be his last worldrecords, i&#x27;m sure.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Leyan,

Condoleances for &#x27;loosing&#x27; the WR on bld cubing... 

Second, some videos were taken, but I must say I think the ppl at 
competitions in Europe are not really good at documenting and 
sharing videos of records with the community.. (not like you guys at 
Calltech).

There were a lot of camera&#x27;s aimed at Matias during his important 
solve, so I guess there must be at least SOME footage, but I don&#x27;t 
know who shot it and when it will be available..

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Realy amazing stuff indeed, 
Thibaut and Edouard were incredible fast! (I just have to say I did a
11.94)
Don&#x27;t forget matyas&#x27; great magic records!!!!
Crazy fact: Gilles vd Peereboom solved at least 3 of his 5 cubes one
handed in the 2 handed finals.
It was nearly getting annoying hearing all the time: and the first
place for... Matyas Kuti... ;)
No just kidding, great job!
Erik

          <div class="email-content">Yes, me and sander have discussed with him, his methods.

Incredibly enough he uses the same as us: Pochmann, but his own variant.
With 3 edge cycles and more algoritmes for cornerns

Amazing indeed, great stuff.  Anyone discuss with him his system and 

memo techniques?

Hi Ron, 

Which one of the three are talking about? The (c) one? I think I&#x27;ll
try buying it from there soon...need to make a good cube quickly
before it&#x27;s too late.

Thanks,

Harris

Yes, I think it is the c type (at least that is what I see from the 
pictures).
I bought a DIY kit with a, b and c type.

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">The Blindfolded World Record was amazing. He started to solve after just 26
or 27 seconds of memorzation. In the evening I learned that his strategy was
: &quot;take a bit more time on the first attempt, just to make sure, and then
take more risks on the 2nd one&quot;. :D :D
I also learned that he is going to practice One-Handed Cubing !!
And when I asked him what his next goal waq, someone said &quot;All the world
records !&quot;. He did not deny afterwards :D :D :D

I am also glad to see the Belgian Open 2007 as the 2nd competition for the
most World Records broken.
It&#x27;s funny to see that right now 80% of World Records are held by Europeans.
(But this is gonna change at the next competition I am sure ;-).)

I once more want to thank everyone. The competition really was a great
experience. I love organizing this competition. I am already thinking about
the next one !  (ok, I do not have many ideas yet but still :p)

I will see most guys again in German Open. :-)
Bye Bye !

That&#x27;s not my method then, at least not the way I see it. I see the 
core point of my idea as &quot;solve one piece at a time&quot;. Would like to 
get to know more about how Mátyás solves now, and about how he 
memorizes.

          <div class="email-content">Stefan, I do not know if this is useful for your method? It&#x27;s an alg 
I found a couple of days ago. It does the same as a T-PLL but also 
orient the two edges:

R U&#x27; R&#x27; - F&#x27; U F - R B&#x27; R B R2 - U

First part = undo pair, second = fix a little, third = redo pair, end 
in a U turn.

Skål!

// Kenneth

BTW: The &quot;third part&quot; is the shortest alg for solving that pair, wery 
useful =)

Maybe you&#x27;re not old enough. In a few months, when I&#x27;m finished with 
university and just have the job and the cubing to do, I&#x27;m gonna 
become a real good cuber.

<br>
Thanks to Gilles for the (perfect) organization of this Belgian Open. <br>
Thanks also to Robert who scrambled this magic cube, and to Gilles<br>
(roux) who judged me.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if the ancient WR was a lucky case (maybe OLL skip)..<br>
I&#x27;ll answer to the question (that 3 persons has already told me) : <br>
<br>
The cube wasn&#x27;t lucky at all : No X-Cross, no OLL skip, no PLL skip,<br>
no pair which inserted alone. It was just a perfect cube (with a<br>
better PLL it would be 9.5). The lucky I had was just to look at the<br>
good place at the good moment.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to Mattyias, who was really incredible on his<br>
blindfold solve.<br>

Thanks... I&#x27;m still using solely &quot;stories&quot; and I hope/think I just 
need to practice more often to become fast. We&#x27;ll see.

Btw, I need to make fun of Matyas now. Cause he made a mistake. 
Overall he has attempted blindsolving 19 cubes and only succeeded 18 
times, DNFing one 5x5. Ha! What a loser!

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">I know for the edges he makes up story, and for the corners he uses numbers and lettres.
And all of this in 25 seconds!!!
If he practices some more, he can solve the cube blindfold after 15 seconds preinspactation.:p

He just told me he used your site to learn the basics and then modified by always inserting three edges.

I usually can&#x27;t do double moves as fast as single moves, and the normal

amazed to see all the videos of M�ty�s on strangepuzzle, and I knew when he <br>

amazing records in all of the events he does.  The 3x3 single solve WR <br>

I saw Erik Akkersdijk doing this alg pretty fast. He also adjusted 
the algorithm to match his style more. Maybe you should ask him.. ;)

It may look a little odd but if you are used to do d-turns it&#x27;s easy 
to do. (I often use d instead of U + cube orientation, aspecially in 
F2L so I&#x27;m much used to it)

Don&#x27;t know if you guys find it fast, I like it much because it&#x27;s 
short and the only part that is a bit tricky to do (for me) is when I 
change grip between the l2 and f2 moves and also cube orient in the 
same go. So the alg I realy do is: l2 d&#x27; R2 d l2 (QU&#x27;) r2 d L2 d&#x27; r2 d

          <div class="email-content"> My master magic is now almost to the good shape.
But there is a problem i still can&#x27;t fix.

If I look at it as 6 parts of 2 squares above each other, the shape is now in stead of 123456, 654321.
Like: the two on the left, or on the right, followed by the second on the left, now on the right.
I accidently changed the ordre in wich they are supposed to be.

If someone can imagine how my master magic must be look like now, please help me before i do it by force.:(

It is back to the 2x6 shape, but all the pieces are messed up.

             My master magic is now almost to the good shape.

But there is a problem i still can&#x27;t fix.



If I look at it as 6 parts of 2 squares above each other, the shape is now in stead of 123456, 654321.

Like: the two on the left, or on the right, followed by the second on the left, now on the right.

I accidently changed the ordre in wich they are supposed to be.



If someone can imagine how my master magic must be look like now, please help me before i do it by force.:(



Thanks

Objet : [Speed cubing group] Master magic



Hello all,



I&#x27;ve done it again. My master magic is totally messed up,but for the first time, even after trying for several hours, i can&#x27;t get him back to starting positioning.



It is back to the 2x6 shape, but all the pieces are messed up.



Has anyone tips or even a link with explanations to get a master magic back to normal?

Hi

I asked this in his forum:
>Hi, Could you say what are the differences between the 3x3 DIY Kits
(a,  b,c) and which is better for speedcubing?
 Thanks     

 And the reply: 

>a is better than c , c is better than b , I think so but b is cheap
than a and c , and with a paper box c is just like the Rubik&#x27;s black
diykit    

The post:

Well, what do you think ? Is the a) kit the best for speedcubing?   or
maybe the c)...

Can you juggle four other objects? I used to juggle a lot (though I<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Alejandro,

I think type a) is a regular DIY cube like the ones on rubiks.com.
Type b) may be the version with the black screws.
The picture of c) at
http://www.cube4you.com/59_Black-DIYKit-3x3x3-(c).html
looks like the one I consider the best. The kernel is white-brownish and the 
screws look long and seem to have a thin thread.

Maybe you should ask the owner of the website, and then tell us all. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

Hi

I asked this in his forum:
>Hi, Could you say what are the differences between the 3x3 DIY Kits
(a,  b,c) and which is better for speedcubing?
 Thanks

 And the reply:

>a is better than c , c is better than b , I think so but b is cheap
than a and c , and with a paper box c is just like the Rubik&#x27;s black
diykit

The post:

http://bbs.cube4you.com/thread-38-1-1.html


Well, what do you think ? Is the a) kit the best for speedcubing?   or
maybe the c)...

Thanks,
Jan

You could also go to this page (you&#x27;ll have to guess the weight of the

Dobbs Ferry is less than 15 minutes from my house.  Come pick them up and shipping is

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I have re-run stages 2 and 3 of my five stage 4x4x4 analysis for twist<br>
turns. This time I&#x27;ve allowed the following additional 2-twist<br>
sequences that were not considered in my previous twist-turn analysis<br>
for these stages:<br>
<br>
(Ff) F = F2 f<br>
(Ff)&#x27; F&#x27; = F2 f&#x27;<br>
(Bb) B = B2 b<br>
(Bb)&#x27; B&#x27; = B2 b&#x27;<br>
<br>
This reduced the maximum number of moves for each of these two stages<br>
by 1. So these stages take up to 18 twists each instead of the 19<br>
twists my previous twist-turn analysis gave. So this now gives 83<br>
twists (instead of 85) as an upper bound for the number of twists that<br>
may be needed to solve the 4x4x4.<br>

cool that idea about a video of the belgian open.

I haven&#x27;t anything myself.
But it&#x27;s good to take a look here: http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=BelgianOpen2007

And then, look at multimedia.

I also know Oliver Nagy has filmed lots of records, so u could mail him or visit his site.

            Hello,



For those of you who don&#x27;t know it yet I am currently making a movie

about the Belgian Open 2007 (will be around 15 to 20 minutes).



But I miss some very important videos (in possibly good quality):



Edouard Chambon (3x3): 10.36 seconds

Frédérick Badie	(5x5): 1:44.47 minutes

Milán Baticz (2x2): 3.68 seconds

Mátyás Kuti (3x3 blind): 1:20.30 minutes

Máté Horváth (Master Magic): 2.02 seconds

Milán Baticz (Master Magic): any solve

Lars Vandenbergh (Square-1): 19.46 seconds

Mátyás Kuti (5x5 blind): 21:08.41 minutes (end of the solve)



If any of you has one or more of them, please email me at &quot;sgowal _at_

gmail _dot_ com&quot; so we can discuss how I can receive it/them.



Of course the final movie will be available to anyone even though it

may take some time until I finish it (maybe 2 weeks).



Thanks,



Sven

again. I had the 3x3x3 cube in the late 80&#x27;s and havent picked it up <br>

learned how to solve the 3x3x3 again and can do it in under 2 minutes <br>
and im getting faster. I have also bought a 4x4x4 and a 5x5x5 and am <br>
learning to solve them as well but im running into some road blocks. <br>
Does anyone have any solutions guides they would recomend. Thanks in <br>

          <div class="email-content">As for me it was just a mistake : I forgot to push some buttons after
aligning the clocks.

For the Clock event, I put full responsibility on organising.
I had no opportunity to practice beforehand.

For the magic, I did not have that problem, nor for the 3x3 OH and 3x3
speedsolve.
For the 3x3OH : it was just pressure.
(Congratulations again Milan ;-))

          <div class="email-content">This technique is common practice for judges to check if the moves are
influenced by the direct obstruction of the space between the eyes of the
competitor and its cube.

If the moves get slower or if the competitor cannot continue his solve until
the hand is removed, then the judge can have doubts. Some judges even use
sheets of paper to do this.

Of course you have to be very vareful not to touch the competitor nor its
cube so that you do not disturb the competitor in any way.

I am sorry but what the judge did seems completely normal.
To tell the truth, if it were me, I would have done it 2 or 3 times during
the solve.

          <div class="email-content">You can cheat by looking under the blindfold.  If the blindfold isn&#x27;t 
very tight, this is easily done.  Solving it behind the back makes it 
more difficult to manipulate the cube.  My execution times behind the 
back are always slower than if I do it in front of me.

One solution, although not very practical at this point, is to have a 
screen that goes between the solver and the solver&#x27;s hands so that the 
audience can still see the cube, but the solver cannot.

          <div class="email-content">i don&#x27;t remember who said this, but i think under the table is a great idea for this.  if there isn&#x27;t a large lip on the far side, the audience and judges should still be able to see it, and it doesn&#x27;t hinder movement like behind the back does.  the only issue is after its solved bringing it back up to the table takes time, but eh nothings perfect

 very tight, this is easily done.  Solving it behind the back makes it 
 more difficult to manipulate the cube.  My execution times behind the 
 back are always slower than if I do it in front of me.
 
 One solution, although not very practical at this point, is to have a 
 screen that goes between the solver and the solver&#x27;s hands so that the 
 audience can still see the cube, but the solver cannot.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think that that is a bad idea. It does prove a lot, and has 
minimal risk of distraction. Plus, I think that a cuber should be 
able to cope with such distractions. An accidental bump, flicker in 
lighting, or sudden loud noises from the audience should not be much 
of a problem for an experienced cuber.

I think it&#x27;s a good idea, and shows that the judge was being 
proactive in detecting forms of cheating.

          <div class="email-content">Blacked out goggles sound the best IMO.  I think once we get enough around, that would work out well.  Before each competitor goes, the judge can check to make sure they are indeed unable to see through them.  The current way is nice, yes, but there is that point where they can look under the blindfold.  With goggles blacked out, that is pretty much impossible.

Good question. I have always placed my blindfold on my forehead before 
memorization and then slipped it down to my eyes just before starting. 
No body has pointed out anything wrong in what I do. So I would hope 
that it is okay. I can&#x27;t think of a reason why it would not be okay.

Anyone with a definitive answer?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Lazy Ass :)

I checked the regs, and this particular rule doesn&#x27;t seem to be in.
But there is a regulation...

# B4b) The competitor may manipulate the puzzle only after the judge
has verified that the competitor has properly donned the blindfold.
The judge must not delay the competitor by more than 1 second.

Seems a bit of a funny rule to me, I bet not many judges know it...

          <div class="email-content">As far as I know this is common practice, at least in competitions I
attended the last year. I did the same thing with a paper at the
Belgian Open... I absolutely trusted the people I was judging (and any
participant at that competition for what it&#x27;s worth), but I think it&#x27;s
comparable to an illusionist who uses a steel ring to prove to the
audience something is floating in the air .. if you catch my drift. 

Personally I don&#x27;t feel comfortable doing this as a judge , because 
A) To the competitors or audience it might be interpreted as the judge
not trusting the competitor (which could be a good thing as well, but
most of the time the competitor in question is in fact someone with a
good reputation).
B) I don&#x27;t know if blindsolvers notice and get distracted with this
routine... I try to do it very carefully... but am not sure

But because of the first point (A) I just made, I think this routine
should be done to all competitors in blindfold events, or none of them.

I checked what the official regulations are, but they say nothing
about the judge checking the blindfold while the competitor is already
in the solving phase.

If they stop and tell the judge, this good for them morally and the other competitors competitively as the competition results aren&#x27;t skewed, but it also means that the solve has to be nullified for that competitor so now the situation becomes a bit more complex.

If I wanted to cheat and was looking under the blindfold, doing this
wouldn&#x27;t help the judge to notice it. I would just do some
T-permutations etc. while the hand/paper was there and continue
solving after I could see the cube again. But I don&#x27;t think anyone is
going to seriously do that.

Did you also do it when you were judging me..?

I am almost certain Ron also did it with me, while I didn&#x27;t feel 
anything.

I do remember that Mathyas noticed it in this case. I could see him 
being annoyed by it, an he was definately distracted, but NOT like 
any response one would have when he was able to see the cube and his 
sight was blocked (just te be clear about that). The judge probably 
touched him in one way or another.

Well, yes I still like the idea of those goggles I suggested 
recently. Those weren&#x27;t swimming goggles, though, but protective 
glasses for welding. The key idea is that the judge can check 
*before* the whole attempt, and thus with no need to rush, that the 
glasses sit tight on the skin, and that the front part can be closed 
by the competitor quickly and safely, somewhat snapping into place so 
that there&#x27;s really no way to see through.

I believe all the blindfolds I have used in competitions so far 
would&#x27;ve allowed me to see the cube, had I wanted to.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I agree. Especially with the clock one small misalignment (especially on the side you can&#x27;t see) would cause a DNF and now this means a DNF for the average also. Just look at the results from the Belgian Open (http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/competition.php?competitionId=BelgianOpen2007&amp;allResults=1#clock) 1/3 of the competitors had a DNF, including 2 people that would (probably) have been 2nd and 6th.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I remember the judge checking Mathyas during his second solve. I also think he was touched, because his reaction was that of someone that was in full focus and then suddenly disturbed.

I really like Stefans idea of the welding glasses.
They wouldn&#x27;t allow people to cheat,
Disturbing checks would not be necessary (they could be done in advance),
People with glasses wouldn&#x27;t lose time,
They wouldn&#x27;t put as much strain on the eyes/head is swimming goggles,
It could even look &quot;tough&quot; ;-}

Now how would we acquire a dozen or more of these without spending any/too much money?

  Hi Koen,

  Did you also do it when you were judging me..?

  I am almost certain Ron also did it with me, while I didn&#x27;t feel 
  anything.

  I do remember that Mathyas noticed it in this case. I could see him 
  being annoyed by it, an he was definately distracted, but NOT like 
  any response one would have when he was able to see the cube and his 
  sight was blocked (just te be clear about that). The judge probably 
  touched him in one way or another.

  Hello,<br>
<br>
  For those of you who don&#x27;t know it yet I am currently making a movie<br>
  about the Belgian Open 2007 (will be around 15 to 20 minutes).<br>
<br>
  But I miss some very important videos (in possibly good quality):<br>
<br>
  Edouard Chambon (3x3): 10.36 seconds<br>
  Frédérick Badie (5x5): 1:44.47 minutes<br>
  Milán Baticz (2x2): 3.68 seconds<br>
  Mátyás Kuti (3x3 blind): 1:20.30 minutes<br>
  Máté Horváth (Master Magic): 2.02 seconds<br>
  Milán Baticz (Master Magic): any solve<br>
  Lars Vandenbergh (Square-1): 19.46 seconds<br>
  Mátyás Kuti (5x5 blind): 21:08.41 minutes (end of the solve)<br>
<br>
  If any of you has one or more of them, please email me at &quot;sgowal _at_<br>
  gmail _dot_ com&quot; so we can discuss how I can receive it/them.<br>
<br>
  Of course the final movie will be available to anyone even though it<br>
  may take some time until I finish it (maybe 2 weeks).<br>

          <div class="email-content">You know, that happens to me?  (Or at least it did when I cubed more.)  
I&#x27;d do like, a 12 or 13 second solve on JNetCube, try the scramble 
again, and get a 17 second solve.  Sometimes I guess you go faster when 
you aren&#x27;t thinking about things.

Leyan and I were in New York and I challenged him to a game of Brain 
Ball.  It&#x27;s a game where you strap a headband to your head (not to your 
arm, because it&#x27;s a headband) and it reads your alpha and theta waves.  
Whoever is more calm wins, and it pushes the ball towards the other 
players.  So Leyan and I tried and I lost terribly (because I&#x27;m always 
stressed and he&#x27;s always asleep) and then we tried one while blindfold 
cubing.  It was a draw, so then we just kept the game going regular 
style, except I started solving the cube and it turns out, my brain 
activity was very VERY low while solving the cube.  Probably lower than 
if we had not been doing anything at all.

Sorry, I couldn&#x27;t improve it, just made it brighter.
By the way, who should we thank for the original video?

Yes, I think it is indeed type a)!

Check out the other Chinese site:
This is type a:
http://www.9spuzzles.com/syssite/home/shop/1/pictures/productsimg/big/4_20070226023059_3.jpg
This is type b:
http://www.9spuzzles.com/syssite/home/shop/1/pictures/productsimg/big/19_20070226230113_4.jpg

Do you see the different screws? Type a is the one that rules!

Have fun,

Ron

Thanks.

Yes, I already did it.
http://bbs.cube4you.com/thread-38-1-1.html

But it seems that he thinks that a) is better :)

Another question
Has someone some experience with Finger&#x27;s DIY?
http://www.9spuzzles.com/

Are they the same that the cube4you?

Lately there are many DIY&#x27;s in different webs, and as I see that there
are good and bad cubes, I only wanted your recommendation
Thanks again.

Oh thank you for clarifying it Ron! I was about to order like 3 DIY
type (c) (well...my parents aren&#x27;t convinced of buying from China

And Stackmat timers and Tournament Displays. Speaking of which, has
everyone seen the new style of the second generation? It has the date
and time displayed even when in off mode.  You can also save 3 times

          <div class="email-content">A long, long time ago I recall watching a cartoon in which the main <br>
character, a robot, becomes a speedcuber and competes. Until today, I <br>
had no idea what the name of the show was (cursed memory). Apparently <br>
it was the second episode of &quot;Whatever Happened to Robot Jones&quot;. I <br>
remember watching the episode and thinking &quot;Hah, that&#x27;s impossible.&quot; <br>

Looking at these two sets, I agree I&#x27;d expect type A to be much 
better. Though, less because of the screws but because of the 
springs. The type B springs look too strong.

          <em>From:</em> yahoogroups@...<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Sat, 3 Mar 2007 20:04:17 -0800<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
After 2-3 weeks of intermitted learning/practice, I finally managed  <br>
to solve the 3x3 blindfolded. And it really feels great.<br>
I learnt using the .doc from Tyson. I still mess up quite a lot  <br>
during execution (the main problem is that usually don&#x27;t know where I  <br>
mess up... maybe I should get a camcorder to try to identify my  <br>
mistakes), but I sometimes have a successful solve, which is great.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my main issue right now is that I&#x27;m freaking slow. around  <br>
10-15min. This is very frustrating and I would like to get any tips  <br>
about how I could improve this time.<br>
<br>
Both my memorization time and my execution time are slow. So any tips  <br>
would do it.<br>
For the memorization I tried with numbers, but didn&#x27;t work very well  <br>
with me. So I&#x27;m currently just memorizing the path, which has a major  <br>
disadvantage, IMHO, because I need to visualize the path, and it&#x27;s  <br>
hard to do it while looking at the cubies (because I have to move/ <br>
rotate the cube to find the colors of the next one, which is messing  <br>
up my brain which tries to visualize the path..). So I&#x27;m losing a lot  <br>
of time looking at the next cubie and then recalling the path from  <br>
the beginning with the cube in the standard position. Maybe I should  <br>
try not to use the cube to visualize the path and do it only in my  <br>
head. I don&#x27;t know, you tell me :)<br>
<br>
For the execution, I sometimes have difficulties with setup moves,  <br>
especially for edges. And I&#x27;m always afraid of not remembering it if  <br>
I just do it intuitively. So I have a tendency to double check,  <br>
triple check every move I&#x27;m doing, which is of course quite slow.  <br>
Also I seem to have a hard time recognizing if the rotation is  <br>
clockwise or counter clockwise. this is really strange because if I  <br>
just do the solve mentally, without really executing it, it is fine,  <br>
I perfectly see what I have to do. But for some reason, when I&#x27;m  <br>
actually doing it, my brain seems to freeze ;) Anyone had the same  <br>
experience?<br>
<br>
I really would like to at least get sub-5min, and possibly sub-3min.<br>
So if anyone recognizes some of the same early difficulties than  <br>
mine, please let me know how you solved them.<br>
Or any general tips to improve time would do it too.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Quôc<br>

&gt; Hello,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; After 2-3 weeks of intermitted learning/practice, I finally <br>
managed  <br>
&gt; to solve the 3x3 blindfolded. And it really feels great.<br>
&gt; I learnt using the .doc from Tyson. I still mess up quite a lot  <br>
&gt; during execution (the main problem is that usually don&#x27;t know where <br>
I  <br>
&gt; mess up... maybe I should get a camcorder to try to identify my  <br>
&gt; mistakes), but I sometimes have a successful solve, which is great.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyway, my main issue right now is that I&#x27;m freaking slow. around  <br>
&gt; 10-15min. This is very frustrating and I would like to get any <br>
tips  <br>
&gt; about how I could improve this time.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Both my memorization time and my execution time are slow. So any <br>
tips  <br>
&gt; would do it.<br>
&gt; For the memorization I tried with numbers, but didn&#x27;t work very <br>
well  <br>
&gt; with me. So I&#x27;m currently just memorizing the path, which has a <br>
major  <br>
&gt; disadvantage, IMHO, because I need to visualize the path, and it&#x27;s  <br>
&gt; hard to do it while looking at the cubies (because I have to move/ <br>
&gt; rotate the cube to find the colors of the next one, which is <br>
messing  <br>
&gt; up my brain which tries to visualize the path..). So I&#x27;m losing a <br>
lot  <br>
&gt; of time looking at the next cubie and then recalling the path from  <br>
&gt; the beginning with the cube in the standard position. Maybe I <br>
should  <br>
&gt; try not to use the cube to visualize the path and do it only in my  <br>
&gt; head. I don&#x27;t know, you tell me :)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For the execution, I sometimes have difficulties with setup moves,  <br>
&gt; especially for edges. And I&#x27;m always afraid of not remembering it <br>
if  <br>
&gt; I just do it intuitively. So I have a tendency to double check,  <br>
&gt; triple check every move I&#x27;m doing, which is of course quite slow.  <br>
&gt; Also I seem to have a hard time recognizing if the rotation is  <br>
&gt; clockwise or counter clockwise. this is really strange because if <br>
I  <br>
&gt; just do the solve mentally, without really executing it, it is <br>
fine,  <br>
&gt; I perfectly see what I have to do. But for some reason, when I&#x27;m  <br>
&gt; actually doing it, my brain seems to freeze ;) Anyone had the same  <br>
&gt; experience?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I really would like to at least get sub-5min, and possibly sub-3min.<br>
&gt; So if anyone recognizes some of the same early difficulties than  <br>
&gt; mine, please let me know how you solved them.<br>
&gt; Or any general tips to improve time would do it too.<br>

do not pay attention, the tips turns without touching them.

So in this case again, the puzzle you use is very important.

After reading that you did your last 3 solves in the 3x3x3 finals one-handed, I thought to myself, what if one of those solves was under 17.9?  Even if you followed all the one-handed rules, it still wouldn&#x27;t count because it was done under the wrong category, right?

Congrats on a great tournament (what seemed like one though I wasn&#x27;t there to partake in it)!

I got 13.08 on the first one but I bet there are lots of people here

who can get under 10 seconds (and I have tried only five times).

          <div class="email-content">I got 9.96 seconds :)

First i used keboard but couldn&#x27;t get under 20 seconds.
After that with mouse, it&#x27;s much easyer.
So, i prooved sub-10 was possible.

Now the cube:)

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
I got one of the official Rubik&#x27;s Timers a little over a year ago, and<br>
it has recently started becoming faulty to the point of being<br>
unusable.  The timer stops whenever it feels like during the solve. <br>
Usually, I put the cube down for pre-inspection, pick it back up, and<br>
before I set it back down again the timer starts on its own and stops<br>
at 1.00 seconds.  If I do manage to set the cube down and pick it back<br>
up to begin solving, the timer will stop on its own in the middle of<br>
the solve (it usually doesn&#x27;t make it past 5 seconds before it does this).<br>
<br>
Has anybody else who has this timer experienced this problem?  Any<br>
tips on how to fix it?  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a battery issue as the<br>
power doesn&#x27;t go on and off, it&#x27;s just the internal timer is messed<br>
up.  I&#x27;d really have to hate to buy another one of these, seeing as<br>
how they are $100.<br>
<br>
Any advice at all would really be appreciated.  Thanks!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Iono, the timer seems kinda useless (no offense to the guy who designed it).
My brother got one, and it just seems like a waste of money, since it&#x27;s not
the standard for cubing anyways. My brother sent the guy who designed it
some emails, but he never responded, and so my brother gave up trying to use
it.

&gt;  &gt; &gt; Hello,<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; After 2-3 weeks of intermitted learning/practice, I finally<br>
&gt;  &gt; managed<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; to solve the 3x3 blindfolded. And it really feels great.<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; I learnt using the .doc from Tyson. I still mess up quite a lot<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; during execution (the main problem is that usually don&#x27;t know <br>
&gt; where<br>
&gt;  &gt; I<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; mess up... maybe I should get a camcorder to try to identify my<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; mistakes), but I sometimes have a successful solve, which is <br>
&gt; great.<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Anyway, my main issue right now is that I&#x27;m freaking slow. around<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; 10-15min. This is very frustrating and I would like to get any<br>
&gt;  &gt; tips<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; about how I could improve this time.<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Both my memorization time and my execution time are slow. So any<br>
&gt;  &gt; tips<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; would do it.<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; For the memorization I tried with numbers, but didn&#x27;t work very<br>
&gt;  &gt; well<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; with me. So I&#x27;m currently just memorizing the path, which has a<br>
&gt;  &gt; major<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; disadvantage, IMHO, because I need to visualize the path, and it&#x27;s<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; hard to do it while looking at the cubies (because I have to move/<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; rotate the cube to find the colors of the next one, which is<br>
&gt;  &gt; messing<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; up my brain which tries to visualize the path..). So I&#x27;m losing a<br>
&gt;  &gt; lot<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; of time looking at the next cubie and then recalling the path from<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; the beginning with the cube in the standard position. Maybe I<br>
&gt;  &gt; should<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; try not to use the cube to visualize the path and do it only in my<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; head. I don&#x27;t know, you tell me :)<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; For the execution, I sometimes have difficulties with setup moves,<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; especially for edges. And I&#x27;m always afraid of not remembering it<br>
&gt;  &gt; if<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; I just do it intuitively. So I have a tendency to double check,<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; triple check every move I&#x27;m doing, which is of course quite slow.<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Also I seem to have a hard time recognizing if the rotation is<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; clockwise or counter clockwise. this is really strange because if<br>
&gt;  &gt; I<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; just do the solve mentally, without really executing it, it is<br>
&gt;  &gt; fine,<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; I perfectly see what I have to do. But for some reason, when I&#x27;m<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; actually doing it, my brain seems to freeze ;) Anyone had the same<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; experience?<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; I really would like to at least get sub-5min, and possibly <br>
&gt; sub-3min.<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; So if anyone recognizes some of the same early difficulties than<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; mine, please let me know how you solved them.<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Or any general tips to improve time would do it too.<br>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br>

  Hi guys,<br>
<br>
  I got one of the official Rubik&#x27;s Timers a little over a year ago, and<br>
  it has recently started becoming faulty to the point of being<br>
  unusable. The timer stops whenever it feels like during the solve. <br>
  Usually, I put the cube down for pre-inspection, pick it back up, and<br>
  before I set it back down again the timer starts on its own and stops<br>
  at 1.00 seconds. If I do manage to set the cube down and pick it back<br>
  up to begin solving, the timer will stop on its own in the middle of<br>
  the solve (it usually doesn&#x27;t make it past 5 seconds before it does this).<br>
<br>
  Has anybody else who has this timer experienced this problem? Any<br>
  tips on how to fix it? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a battery issue as the<br>
  power doesn&#x27;t go on and off, it&#x27;s just the internal timer is messed<br>
  up. I&#x27;d really have to hate to buy another one of these, seeing as<br>
  how they are $100.<br>
<br>
  Any advice at all would really be appreciated. Thanks!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t agree. I like having a timer that gives me random scrambles (3x3x3, 4x4x4 and 5x5x5), has an inspection option, keeps 100 times in memory and calculates avarages for you. Off course, all of this can be done with a computer/laptop, but those are bigger/heavier, batteries run out faster and they are more expensive (and also not the standard).

However I do think it is smart to also practise with a stackmat timer so you get used to it. Also, an update to the scrambling algorithm would be welcomed by me. (Including options for 2x2x2, 6x6x6 and 7x7x7. Doing U D&#x27; doesn&#x27;t make much sense on a 2x2x2). I really do like the notation of the scrambling algorithm: 2B&#x27; meaning turn 2 B layers counter clockwise. This notation is easily scalable to cubes of any size!

Conclusion: Nice device, but not perfect

  Iono, the timer seems kinda useless (no offense to the guy who designed it).
  My brother got one, and it just seems like a waste of money, since it&#x27;s not
  the standard for cubing anyways. My brother sent the guy who designed it
  some emails, but he never responded, and so my brother gave up trying to use
  it.

First of all, is your problem that you can&#x27;t solve the 5x5x5 at all or<br>
that you&#x27;re having trouble doing it consistently / quickly?<br>
<br>
What method are you planning to use? If you haven&#x27;t chosen one yet,<br>
I&#x27;d suggest a centers-first strategy (see bigcubes.com), but if you&#x27;ve<br>
picked one we need to know which one it is before we can help you.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey <br>
  I&#x27;m new to the Rubik&#x27;s Cube I have only been cubing for about a month <br>
now and I average about 1 minute.(I think that&#x27;s good and I know that&#x27;s <br>
like slow motion to most of you here) I&#x27;m trying to get better but I <br>
don&#x27;t know where to start. <br>
   What I do is solve F2L intuitively and that <br>
takes me about 40 seconds then I orient the last layer and solve. The <br>
LL takes me about 20 to 15 seconds. For the last layer I use common <br>
algorithms found on Macky&#x27;s site. Other than that that&#x27;s it. <br>
Where should I begin to get better? F2L? What&#x27;s the average time I <br>
should get for that? Any tips other than more practice?<br>

          <div class="email-content">ive been cubing about the same for about 20-25 days my fastest time i 
got was about 1:06 which is pretty good compared to me :). I use 
tysons method and got better at that, Im not sure about the Fridrich 
or how to do the f2l even so I cant help much here.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I try to write god&#x27;s algorithm in order to solve the pocket cube with<br>
a friend but we are facing to problems. We tried to reduce the<br>
88000000 possibilities with equivalence classes by using the 1152-fold<br>
symmetry and 2-reflections but we don&#x27;t manage to generate all the<br>
78000 concerned cubes (mistake at depth 3 &#x27;-_-).<br>
<br>
Is there any better approach to write god&#x27;s algorithm for 2x2 and<br>
could you help me by giving the different steps of such an algorithm ?<br>
How to represent the cube ? (integer list, bytes)<br>
Mhhhh i forgot, the language used is Maple (and can&#x27;t change :] )<br>
<br>
Thx :)<br>

Will you please inform me when Grada and Peter have Daniel&#x27;s 4X4 
solve on video? Daniel is offically the youngest to have solved the 
4x4 in competition (unfortunately not an official category otherwise 
it would have been another world record in the Belgium competition) 
and I very much regret that I didn&#x27;t film it.  

with regards, Michel.

I heard a lot good stuff about this site. I looked and it also seems<br>
great to me! Sooo much choice... But.. what is all the difference?<br>
I&#x27;ve heard about type a/b/c screws etc. Also I see a white DIY with<br>
(b) behind it with stickers for 4.76 euro&#x27;s and then I also see a<br>
white DIY also with stickers coming with it for 5.72 euro&#x27;s... it says<br>
(a). What is the difference and what is best?<br>
<br>
Ok, another question... I don&#x27;t have paypal which seems the only way<br>
of paying obviously, but when I tried to make an account I always had<br>
to fill in credit card things, and I don&#x27;t have one, also I don&#x27;t<br>
think I can have a credit card of my own since I&#x27;m not 18 yet (I will<br>

          <div class="email-content">C4Y: I have not personally ordered from this site, but previous posts
indicate that type (a) is most likely the best--something about having
longer screws, maybe it&#x27;s a little more sturdy than the others.

PayPal: I think you can do direct withdrawal from your bank account if
you have a checking account. If you can get a CheckCard against your
checking account, that will work the same as a credit card. Of course,
if you don&#x27;t have a checking account, then I think you&#x27;re out of luck
until you can get your own card or borrow someone else&#x27;s.

really do like the notation of the scrambling algorithm: 2B&#x27; meaning 
turn 2 B layers counter clockwise. This notation is easily scalable

memorizing it. Of course I didn&#x27;t do the whole cube at once, I&#x27;d solve

I&#x27;m not using numbers anymore, but it tooks me 2 weeks to do a full  <br>
solve<br>
blindfolded. But I don&#x27;t have much time to practice, and I didn&#x27;t  <br>
know all the<br>
permutation algorithms (this helps quite a lot if you already knows  <br>
them,<br>
especially to fix the parity). So much of the time it took me, was to  <br>
learn new<br>
PLL algorithms.<br>
<br>
Actually I never wrote the numbers down, I just learnt the corner  <br>
orientations,<br>
try to do it blindfolded. Then learnt the edges orientations, try to  <br>
do it blindfolded.<br>
Then try to do both. And so on... Until my first full solve.<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;m really really slow at the moment (10-15min), but again, I  <br>
don&#x27;t have<br>
much time to practice (I&#x27;m only doing 2 or 3 solves a week... for the  <br>
moment,<br>
I&#x27;m waiting for my vacations ;) ). But I&#x27;m still really happy that I  <br>
managed to do it.<br>
I know it&#x27;s not as hard as people seem to think at first, but you  <br>
still get a sense of<br>
accomplishment when you get your first full solve. It&#x27;s magical, it&#x27;s  <br>
like xmas<br>
when you open your gifts. You remove your blindfold and... surprise!  <br>
it&#x27;s solved! :)<br>
<br>
Good luck, and have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">The orientation of the 8 corners are described by a number from 0 to 
2186 (3^7-1). If use use a terneary base encoding, that will save 
lots of space. [only 12 bits]

For permutation, you define a natural ordering of the cubies and 
then construct a factorial-base number by counting the number of 
corners to the left of it that is higher in order than itself. 
Hence, the permutation may be given by a number from 0 to 40319 (8!-
1). [only 16 bits]

The entire state can be stored using 28 bits, so one &quot;long int&quot; or 
two &quot;ints&quot; in C/C++. I would use transformation tables for the 
moves. I&#x27;d also have a function that consturcts pruning tables to 
speed up the runtime.

You can also consider the possiblity of fixing one of the corners in 
proper permutation and orientation and then not apply any turns that 
change it. So if you assert the DBL piece to be solved then yor only 
generators would be U,F,R (so there would be 9 first turn 
possiblities and 6 possiblites for the remaining turns, so that you 
don&#x27;t cancel out a previous turn). Exploiting symmetry your first 
turn can only be 1 of 2 things really.

If one corner is fixed, than this would reduce the number of bits 
nessesary to store state as well. [3^6 for orientation, 7! for 
permutation... so like 10+13 bits for state]

In conclusion, represent a cube using a pair of ints! (assuming you 
get exactly 16 bits out of an int, which is standard on most 
platforms)

          <div class="email-content">Okay I understood how to represent the cube.
But the problem is that this pair of ints only stores orientation and
permutation but doesnt store the algorithm executed to reach this state. 

I mean the programm i want to write aims to, given a random state of
the pocket cube, answer the optimal algorithm in less than 14 moves
(half turn metrics). So if I generate all the states and encode each
state with 2 ints, how do i know which algorithm was applied to get
this state? 

Moreover I dont understand how to generate every single state in a
suitable time, even by using &lt;U,F,R> generator, because except first
step which allows 9 moves, other allows 6 turns and it would involve
6^13 moves to apply to the cube?

I have no idea what coding ablities you have, and I am not an expert 
on the matter. But I would suggest using &quot;class&quot; to store &quot;node 
information&quot; which would be the state coupled with the sequence it 
took to get there or something.

Due to the size of this tree structure, it is important to use a 
good &quot;branch and bound&quot; algorithm with depth-first seraching scheme. 
Deeper pruning tables should help too.

Using a multi-phase apporach might increase the efficiency of the 
serach a great deal. Using a 2-phase search, it is still possible to 
find optimal sequences. Doing a 3-way, 2-phase search is possibly 
even better. What I mean is to find optimal turns to get into the 
subgroup where you only need &lt;U2,F,R> to solve and then go from 
there to solved state. Basically work through sub-groups.

I caught you saying &quot;answer the optimal algorithm&quot;. I&#x27;m sure you 
mean &quot;an optimal algorthm&quot; since it is typically not unique. Another 
way to go is to return with ALL of the HTM optimal solutions... that 
might be more helpful for a cuber I would think.

You could contact the ACube author and/or the Cube Explorer guy for 
help. Both of their programs utilize similar data optimization 
concepts.

          <div class="email-content">Typically, a God&#x27;s algorithm calculation for the 2x2x2 would be done 
something like this.

First come up with a way of representing the cube. Typically you use 
three generators, as in &lt;U,F,R> which would fix the DBL cubie. That 
leaves 729 possible orientation combinations of the 7 remaining 
cubies and 7! or 5040 permutations of the cubies. 729 * 5040 = 
3674160 total positions. Of course, this number is also equal to the 
total positions without a reference cubie, 88,179,840, divided by the 
number of ways to orient the cube, 24. You need to have routines to 
convert a cube position to a number, and a number to a cube position.

Now create an array with 3674160 elements, one array element per cube 
position. If P is a number representing the permutation of the 
cubies, and T is a number representing the orientation (twist) state 
of the cubies, then you can represent the position with a single 
number, 5040*T + P. Initialize all elements of the array with a 
special number, say -1,  indicating you haven&#x27;t determined the 
distance of that position yet. (Note, naturally you could simply use 
a two-dimensional array 729 x 5040.)

Set the array element whose index corresponds to the solved cube to a 
value 0, since we know the solved cube is a distance of 0 from the 
solved state. (Typically the solved cube would correspond to an index 
of 0, but that&#x27;s not necessarily the case.)

Next apply all the moves that you consider as a single move to the 
solved state. Set the corresponding array elements for those 
positions to 1, since we know those positions are a distance of 1 
from the solved state.

Search the array for all elements having a value 1, and try all the 
moves again for each of those positions. Set all of those 
corresponding array elements (if the current value is still -1) to 
the value 2.

Repeat the previous step, except search for elements containing 2 and 
set the elements corresponding to new positions reached to 3.

Keep repeating this procedure to get elements of distance 4, 5, 6, 7, 
8, 9, 10, and 11. You should then have the distance for each position 
(if using half-turn metric). (Quarter-turn metric rrequires up to 14 
moves.)

Then for any cube position, you can look up its distance, try 
applying each move until you find a position whose distance from the 
array is one less. That&#x27;s the move (or at least one possible move) to 
use to solve the cube from that position. You could make a separate 
array to store a code representing the move to make for each position 
(or use a bit-encoded number to store all such moves).

Finally, I&#x27;ll note that you could use conjugation by the 48 
symmetries of the cube to further reduce the number of positions you 
need to represent. This will reduce the number of positions that need 
to be represented, but it will not reduce the positions by a full 
factor of 48 (but it may be quite close to a factor of 48). I note 
that the symmetries of the cube (48) * the number of ways of 
orienting the cube as a whole (24) = 1152. I assume this is where you 
got the number 1152 that you mentioned. You could also use the 
concept of inverse positions (antisymmetry) to get close to another 
factor of two reduction in the number of positions. Since 3674160 is 
such a &quot;small&quot; number of positions, it is probably not worth the 
effort to do this symmetry (or antisymmetry) reduction, unless you 
really want to know the distance distribution in terms of these 
reduced number of positions.

          <div class="email-content">Well, there you have it! A perfectly laid out plan of attack. I 
would call this a &quot;complete pruning table with back-tracking 
approach&quot;. It would have a very quick, O(1) runtime after creating 
the table, which you only have to do once.

That table (two dimensional random-access array) would take up 10.56 
MB if consturcted optiamally. More like 14.70 MB if you just use a 
long-int for cube states. Filling the table shouldn&#x27;t be too bad 
with only about 3.67 million entries. Another thing to point out is 
that you don&#x27;t need any bulky STL stuff to do any of the things he 
mentioned.

You need to have transformation routines in place to generate 9 
cubes given one. Input function to accept a cube state string and 
convert to internal value. An output function to convert from the 
internal value back to a cube state string.

This program sounds fun to code now... could be used for speed 
programming competitions with a given outline of course.

Bruce, care to take a guess how much time a table like this would 
take to fully populate? (on a current desktop machine with average 
specs) I&#x27;m horrible at making these estimates.

  i have the right sune + left sune one and its inverse, as well as the <br>

          <div class="email-content">You are stuck in the centers solving phase it sounds like. How many of 
the centers do you solve before geting stuck?

It is recommended to solve one, then the one located opposite it, then 
any of the remaining four. The fourth center should be located 
adjacent to the third center you solved. Each center is solved without 
destroying the centers already solved in a previous step. For the last 
two centers, those are solved at the same time, since if you solve one 
the final one is automatically solved.

You never solve a layer completely in the &quot;bigcubes method,&quot; which we 
experts prefer to call a &quot;centers first approach&quot;.

It sounds to me like you are stuck after solving 3 centers. I 
recommend viewing Frank&#x27;s tutorial video. My suggestion here is to use 
moves of the form XYX&#x27;, where X is a two-layer turn and Y is an outer 
layer turn. Something like (Rr)&#x27;F&#x27;(Rr) just helped me solve a center 
piece on F, with F,U,B being the not-yet-solved centers.

(Side-note: sequences/operators of this form are called conjugators.)

I have a 2x2 square formed on F now. I can &quot;grab stuff&quot; from the back 
as well. I would try to expand to a 2x3 block by attaching a 1x2 
block. I see one in the back but it&#x27;s not setup properly so I do a B&#x27; 
first. To place it I do (Rr)2&#x27;F&#x27;(Rr)2. My 2x3 block on F is now on 
(u,e) which is not very desirable (unless I hve a 1x3 block on B), so 
I do F&#x27; to place the 2x3 block on (l,m). I then try to either place 
one x-center next to the 2x3 block or to form the remaining 1x3 block 
elsewhere. (I know y&#x27;all can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing but...) in this case 
I have and x-centers at (U,f,l) and (B,u,l). The +center is at (B,d,m).

Here I do U-(Ll)&#x27;B2(Ll) to form the 1x3 block in the back. I do B(Rr)
2B2(Rr)2&#x27; to finish the 4th center on F.

Now I got lucky and see the folowing pattern on U:
yyb
bbb
bbb

I&#x27;d instinctively do a U before continuing, although there is a case 
where I can &quot;catch a 1x2 block at B&quot; this way... I don&#x27;t always see 
the optimal path.

In this case I see U center pieces at (B,d,l) and (B,u,m) so I do 
(assuming I did the U turn mentioned): (Rr)B(Rr)&#x27;-B-(Rr)B(Rr)&#x27;. Now 
I&#x27;m done with centers, yippie.

The cases I illustrated here can be set up using inverse turns... that 
way you can see what I&#x27;m seeing and then do what I did.

Concerning Input and Output fonctions, okay. But, excuse my english,
what do you mean by transformation routines ? And why 9 cubes given one ?

long-int has already been explained so i think it&#x27;s okay but which
dimension for your array give those 14.7 MB ?
And i still don&#x27;t understand how to get one optimal algorithm from
this integer-array because int only code orientation + permutation,
and don&#x27;t give the algorithm used to get this state.
Maybe i&#x27;m wrong, but by &quot;Filling the table shouldn&#x27;t be too bad 
> with only about 3.67 million entries.&quot;, you were talking about ints
for permutation and orientation (cube states so), not algorithm.

I use B R&#x27; D2 R B&#x27; U2 B R&#x27; D2 R B&#x27; U2 for that case, feels a bit more
comfortable to me but it&#x27;s the same alg.

For Sune/Anti-Sune I use R&#x27; U L U&#x27; u&#x27; R2 u R2 U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U and its mirror.

If you have installed Cube Explorer (only since version 4.10), you 
will see a table called &quot;fullCornerF.prun&quot; of size 1.44 MB in the CE 
directory . This table holds the *full* pruning table for the corners 
of the cube. It is used in the solver for incomplete cubes if all 8 
corners have well defined positions and orientations.
Of course this pruning table is a superset of the pruning table for 
the Pocket cube. It&#x27;s generation only takes a few seconds, so for the 
pocket cube this time should be even smaller, also the size of the 
pruning table should be smaller.
The size of &quot;fullCornerF.prun&quot; can be explained in the following way: 
The 40320 corner permutations are reduced to 2768 symmetry classes  
by the 16 symmetries of the cube, which preserve the UD axis. We have 
2187 possible corner orientations. So we need a table with 2768*2187 
entries which hold the pruning information (distance to start). 
Because I store the distances modulo 3, we only use 2 bits per entry, 
so we need 2768*2187/4 = 1513404 Byte.

x = turn the whole cube in direction R
y = turn whole cube in direction U
z = turn whole cube in direction F

The first time you start learning algorithims, it is diffcult. I
printed a set of about 10-12 off, and went through learning them. The
more you learn, the easier it is to learn new algorithims. Also make
sure its your fingers than memorize the algorithims, no your brain!

Hope to have helped,
Joey

That looks very interesting but near the end I sadly lose it. Can you

layer I use common algorithms found on Macky&#x27;s site. Other than that<br>
that&#x27;s it. Where should I begin to get better? F2L? What&#x27;s the<br>

 month now and I average about 1 minute.(I think that&#x27;s good and I
 know that&#x27;s like slow motion to most of you here) I&#x27;m trying to
 get better but I don&#x27;t know where to start. What I do is solve F2L
 intuitively and that takes me about 40 seconds then I orient the last
 layer and solve. The LL takes me about 20 to 15 seconds. For the last
 layer I use common algorithms found on Macky&#x27;s site. Other than that
 that&#x27;s it. Where should I begin to get better? F2L? What&#x27;s the
 average time I should get for that? [:-/]  Any tips other than more
 practice?HELP [:((]

Guess it&#x27;s time for me to catch up. I&#x27;ve been slackin&#x27;.

My times got back up to about around 3:05, a big difference with 
where I was in September - 2:23-ish.

Was that a lucky solve? faster than average perhaps?

anybody have any ideas on what I can do?  Is it just lots and lots of

How about flipping a single edge on a 3x3x3? My best time is 2.09 for
that. (Hey, you never know when you&#x27;ll get a really bad pop.)

Woah, 1.25 on a Stackmat.

Also got 1.95 for swapping two corners which is pretty good I think.

&quot;some item also have more discount,like the DIYKIT

More than 5 piece 10%~20% off
More than 20 piece 15%~25% off
More than 50 piece 20%~30% off
More than 100 piece 25%~35% off&quot;

You should email him and ask more details. I&#x27;m pretty sure they come
with rather good stickers.

Sure, I just quickly wrote down the moves after the solve because I

scramble:
R&#x27; B L2 D2 R B2 U&#x27; D&#x27; R2 L&#x27; D F&#x27; L R2 U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; B D2 R&#x27; U2 R&#x27; B&#x27;

2x2x3-block: z&#x27; y&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; U&#x27; R2 x&#x27;
Orient edges: U&#x27; y L F&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; y&#x27;
Another square: R U R U2 R2
c/e-pair: U
2nd c/e-pair: R&#x27; U2 R
1x2x3 on LL: U2 R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27;
ZBLL: z&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; L R U2 L&#x27; U L U L&#x27; U R&#x27; (L-L&#x27;)

I know all ZBLL cases that have a 1x2x2-block (square) on the LL. I
often either build that while solving the last c/e-pair or, like in
this solve, make a 1x2x3 in the LL so that R-layer becomes LL.

Thanks a lot, that&#x27;s really fascinating. Is anyone else solving like 
that? And is this how you regularly solve or do you go different 
routes as well? I&#x27;m beginning to understand how you can so low 
average move numbers...

Until the ZBLL it&#x27;s all easy to understand now, that&#x27;s nice. What 
threw me off was mainly the non-matching 1x2x3 and that I didn&#x27;t know 
you knew those ZBLL cases, those two together just didn&#x27;t let me see 
a clean last step.

Cheers!
Stefan

The idea is that the pruning depth does not change by more than one <br>
by each move. So if the current pruning depth mod 3 is for example 2 <br>
and after applying a move it is 0, you know that the distance <br>
increased by one (because only 2+1 = 0 mod 3). If it becomes 1, you <br>
know that it decreased by one. So applying only moves which decrease <br>
the pruning depth mod 3, you will find the goal state very fast. The <br>
search time is a linear function of the maneuver length, because if <br>
the maneuver length increases by one in worst case you have 18 <br>
additional moves to check (in FTM, 12 in QTM). <br>

Yes, I go different routes as well, it depends on the case and what I
see first. If the last c/e-pair that goes into F2L is simple, I might
just solve it and go with a regular 2-look LL. I know ~50 algs for
skipping OLL and I use those if possible, though.

I also like Heise very much, but there are many situations I can&#x27;t
deal with quickly (not yet) so I only use it in speedsolving if I see
patterns I&#x27;m already familiar with. Most speedcubers think (from what
I&#x27;ve heard) that even basic Petrus is too complicated for speedcubing
so I&#x27;m almost certain that nobody else uses these ideas.

Yeah, it was almost impossible to see what&#x27;s going on without any
explanation. I have to add that this solve was very exceptional, I
usually average 16-17 seconds and 45-50 moves.

The same thing happened to me.
Just put it flat on a table and press the tiles down back where they
should be. After a bit of pressure they should go back, you might end
up doing this alot after solving it.

6 permutations * 9 orientations = 54 positions

One of them is solved and some cases appear more than once so I think
the final number is 49. Many corner 3-cycles are obvious commutators
and a bunch of reflections, so there&#x27;s not much to memorize.

Hi Ryan,

It seems to work fine for me, but there are so many cube rotations
that it&#x27;s not very easy to follow. In plain UDFBLR: R&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; F2 L&#x27; D
F&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; F L F L2 F2 L F&#x27; L2 F L2 F&#x27; L F L2 F&#x27; L&#x27; F L&#x27; F&#x27; L R F2 L&#x27;
F L F L&#x27; F R&#x27;
 
> P.S. study the last 9 moves - you don&#x27;t need ZBLL :-)

Those are indeed pretty straightforward. :-) I hadn&#x27;t really tried to
understand this alg because it seemed so complicated, but looking at
those last moves first the whole alg is starting to make sense now.
Thanks!

The stickers are high quality, and pretty cheap. It&#x27;s much easier than
trying to buy the vinyl film and trying to cut it yourself. Cubesmith also
offers tiles and many other options. Check it out, it may be worth your
while.

Hmm, I can&#x27;t follow. What last 9 moves, U2L&#x27;ULUL&#x27;UR&#x27;L or 
RU2L&#x27;ULUL&#x27;UR&#x27;? Both have non-trivial effects for me. And what does it

&gt; The idea is that the pruning depth does not change by more than <br>
one <br>
&gt; by each move. So if the current pruning depth mod 3 is for example <br>
2 <br>
&gt; and after applying a move it is 0, you know that the distance <br>

you <br>
&gt; know that it decreased by one. So applying only moves which <br>
decrease <br>
&gt; the pruning depth mod 3, you will find the goal state very fast. <br>
The <br>
&gt; search time is a linear function of the maneuver length, because <br>
if <br>

But if you are interested how to reduce the pruning table size even
more: For the bigger tables in CE I do not use 2 Bit per pruning table

one byte (3^5=243 &lt; 256).

That is cleaver. I&#x27;m sure some places it&#x27;s standard to teach this in 
a computer science class, but it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve heard of it.

Other possiblities that are quite dense:
17 ternary numbers can be packed into 27 bits
29 ternary numbers can be packed into 46 bits
41 ternary numbers can be packed into 65 bits

Aligned possiblities:
 10 in  2 bytes
 20 in  4 bytes
 40 in  8 bytes
 80 in 16 bytes
161 in 32 bytes
323 in 64 bytes

So it seems &quot;5 in 1&quot; is the best way to go.

Is the source code availible? Do you know if ACube utilizes this 
optimization?

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. study the last 9 moves - you don&#x27;t need ZBLL :-)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Hmm, I can&#x27;t follow. What last 9 moves, U2L&#x27;ULUL&#x27;UR&#x27;L or <br>
&gt; RU2L&#x27;ULUL&#x27;UR&#x27;?<br>
<br>
The latter. See below:<br>
<br>
http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?alg=DR2U&#x27;RURU&#x27;RD&#x27;<br>
<br>
&gt; And what does it mean you don&#x27;t need ZBLL?<br>
<br>
Sorry, that was a reference to earlier discussions I had with<br>
Johannes, but I will try to explain what that was about.<br>
<br>
Most methods, including ZBLL and Fridrich, were designed on the<br>
premise that symmetry is a &quot;good thing&quot;. Symmetry means that in a<br>
great many cases we can simply rotate the cube around, and then solve<br>
the case using a rotation of an existing algorithm instead of an<br>
entirely new one, for example. In other words, symmetry reduces the<br>
number of cases that we need to memorise.<br>
<br>
However, the position that I will argue is that symmetry is what makes<br>
cases difficult in the first place, and is what leads us to memorisation.<br>
<br>
There are three reasons why I think symmetry is &quot;bad&quot;:<br>
<br>
1. A system in which the solver only thinks about symetric positions<br>
does not have closure. That is, the solver cannot make a single move<br>
on its own without breaking out of the system and becoming lost. This<br>
is why it is possible for Fridrich solvers can become lost in the<br>
middle of an algorithm from cube amnesia. Simply, their system only<br>
recognises the beginning and end of a sequence, and they are trapped<br>
in a mindset that prevents them from being able to see the middle on<br>
the same level as the ends.<br>
<br>
2. Symmetric positions tend to make the shortest paths non-obvious.<br>
e.g. when all of the unsolved pieces are on the last layer, and we<br>
have the typical symmetry of U rotations, there are less hints<br>
provided by that cube state as to how to start to solve that position<br>
intuitively. Each move will appear to move the cube pieces further<br>
away from where they should be (breaking the symmetry that is formed).<br>
<br>
3. Symmetric positions tend to require longer, more complicated<br>
solutions than asymetric positions. In a perfectly symmetric position,<br>
the only way to proceed is to go out the way you came in (or a way<br>
that is &quot;equivalent&quot; to the way you came in). If your system (i.e. the<br>
set of moves/operations you are restricting yourself to) is such that<br>
the way in is 1 move, then entering a symetric position is a waste of<br>
2 moves. However, if your system is such that the way in is 2 moves,<br>
then you are wasting 4 moves.<br>
<br>
My method is fundamentally asymmetric. It recognises that while<br>
asymmetric steps result in far too many cases to memorise, they also<br>
make the cases easier to solve so that you do not need to rely on<br>
memorisation.<br>
<br>
Now back to the case given:<br>
<br>
http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?alg=DR2U&#x27;RURU&#x27;RD&#x27;<br>
<br>
This is a typical position within the Heise system: the front F2L<br>
column is free, the edges have been oriented, and the two corner/edge<br>
pairs have been formed. The design of this step is such that it has<br>
the following properties:<br>
<br>
- Maneuvers from one position to another are very short (typically<br>
between 3 and 7 moves).<br>
- You never need to move too far away from a recognisable position.<br>
<br>
It is possible to move between different states in this step using<br>
only a limited number of strategies, one of which is demonstrated by<br>
this sequence. In this particular case, we are dealing with strategies<br>
involving three correct edges on top. We always deal with three<br>
oriented edges on top, with the following permutations:<br>
<br>
- 3 edges in correct order (as above)<br>
- 2 opposite edges correct<br>
- 2 adjacent correct + 1 incorrect (2 varieties)<br>
- no correct adjacent edges (2 varieties)<br>
<br>
.. along with one or two corner/edge pairs.<br>
<br>
In each case, the edge permutations are fundamental and dictate the<br>
kind of strategy that is needed.<br>
<br>
The overall point was that if you make yourself familiar and<br>
comfortable with the asymmetric positions, then you will find you<br>
don&#x27;t need to memorise large numbers of algorithms such as ZBLL. The<br>
operations will be short enough that you will be able to see them.<br>
<br>
Finally, to clarify how the above strategy fits into my system when<br>
the steps are done in the normal order, here is a description of how<br>
my method works in the advanced case:<br>
<br>
1. 4 (potentially non-matching) squares<br>
2. Edge orientation<br>
3. 1 corner/edge pair<br>
4. Edges + 1 corner<br>
5. Last 3 corners<br>
<br>
The relevant step is (4) in which we manipulate the edge permutation<br>
while manipulating 1 of the corners. It sometimes (often!) happens<br>
that you end up with more corner/edge pairs by this stage just by<br>
chance, or because you have preserved them, and then you are able to<br>
skip step 5 entirely. I&#x27;m sure Johannes will be familiar with this<br>
experience.<br>
<br>
The webpage describing this approach is still a work in progress, however:<br>
<br>
http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/method/<br>
<br>
I will hopefully have more time soon.<br>
<br>
P.S. I should point out that my interest in designing this method is<br>
in fact for speedcubing. That is, my goal is to find techniques that<br>
enable few moves but ALSO a framework for allowing the solver to do<br>
this at high speeds. I would still say it is in its infancy in this<br>
respect. My fastest average with this method is 28.36 seconds and so<br>
it has a long way to go.<br>

Yes and no. Pulling out the corners would be slower, though, I remove
the edge first.

Cool! I just found a nice method for swapping two adjacent edges... I
don&#x27;t need to be too afraid of popping in a competition anymore. :P

&gt; That is cleaver. I&#x27;m sure some places it&#x27;s standard to teach this in <br>
&gt; a computer science class, but it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve heard of it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Other possiblities that are quite dense:<br>
&gt; 17 ternary numbers can be packed into 27 bits<br>
&gt; 29 ternary numbers can be packed into 46 bits<br>
&gt; 41 ternary numbers can be packed into 65 bits<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Aligned possiblities:<br>
&gt;  10 in  2 bytes<br>
&gt;  20 in  4 bytes<br>
&gt;  40 in  8 bytes<br>
&gt;  80 in 16 bytes<br>
&gt; 161 in 32 bytes<br>
&gt; 323 in 64 bytes<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So it seems &quot;5 in 1&quot; is the best way to go.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Is the source code availible? Do you know if ACube utilizes this <br>
&gt; optimization?<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
<br>
Please forget about the source code in Delphi. It is confusing, all<br>
the GUI stuff mixed together with a lot not very well designed classes<br>
and objects. I just am working on rewriting some essential code for an<br>
console program in pure C and hope to get it so clear, that it makes<br>
sense to make it public.<br>
I do not beleave ACube uses this sort of optimization because it is<br>
only important for really big tables, lets say &gt;100MB.<br>

&gt; Cheers!<br>
&gt; Stefan<br>
&gt;<br>
I am not familiar with this matter, but it would be essential that the<br>
overhead to extract the values form the table is small. For example,<br>
when I pack 5 ternary numbers into a byte, I do not use the order<br>
(0,1,2,3,4) (5,6,7,8,9) (10,11,12,13,14) etc. but <br>
(0,1,2,3,x) (4,5,6,7,x+1) (8,9,10,11,x+2) etc., where x is about 4/5<br>
of the maximum index. So you do not have to do a div 5 arithmetic but<br>
more or less a div 4 arithmetic to compute position of the index in<br>
the table.<br>

Hi everybody!<br>
<br>
I wanted a new rubik and a lot of people suggested me the hungarian <br>
one of the &quot;studio&quot;. It works very well. When I did the order on <br>
ebay I also bought the 2x2, 4x4 and 5x5  all togheter on this page:<br>

<br>
I &#x27;ve remeined very disappointed of the 4x4 and 5x5 because they are <br>
too small and turn not good. I&#x27;ve tried to open the 4x4 and it has <br>
been very difficult to put it back in order because inside it has <br>
not the &quot;ball&quot; but a lot of small pieces.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Seems to me that only the 3x3 in a studio cube... the 2x2, 4x4 and 5x5<br>
are eastsheen (at least they look like it).<br>
<br>
You can make the 4x4 and 5x5 eastsheen turn really well if you lube<br>
them. You can also adjust the screws on both on them.<br>
<br>
The 2x2 should turn well as soon as you lube it.<br>
<br>
I have my self a 4x4 studio that I prefer to my eastsheen 4x4. I don&#x27;t<br>
practice 5x5 much, but the eastsheen feels good.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi, thanks for reply.

I&#x27;ve seen that this guy propose two offers. The 4x4 and 5x5 cubes of 
the studio are bigger than the one wich I came. You can see on ebay 
that he make to different offert with a 2x2 3x3 4x4 5x5, one is 
everything hungarian, in the other offert only the 3x3 si hungarian.

I&#x27;ve checked and I&#x27;ve seen that on the cubes wich i became (4x4 and 
5x5) I cannot tune the screws because there are not the springs. Are 
there the springs in the rubik 4x4 and 5x5 of the studio?

Can I tune them ?

Are there other marks wich produce 4x4 and 5x5 ?

Thanks a lot!

doesn&#x27;t appear on my computer. Probably the file transfer to my server
created an error.

An easy solution might be to just skip the part where it breaks (click
on the timeline some seconds after the problem occured).

Gilles can you host it (once fixed)? Thanks

 An easy solution might be to just skip the part where it breaks (click
 on the timeline some seconds after the problem occured).
 
 Gilles can you host it (once fixed)? Thanks

          <div class="email-content">I confirm that my FTP client broke the movie... it is now &quot;hopefully&quot;<br>
correct.<br>
<br>
&gt; No problem, as long as it is less then 9 gigabytes.<br>
&gt; (You did a GREAT job!)<br>
<br>
Great thanks. You can directly take the movie from my website<br>
http://rubik.talk-sep.net/?page=videos .<br>
<br>
By 9 gigabytes do you mean that you can host the full quality movie<br>
(The DV file is 6 GB, but I guess I can make a medium quality of about<br>
700 MB), I don&#x27;t think it is really necessary though.<br>
<br>
Do you guys think the 80 MB version is ok or is there a lot of people<br>
that want a better quality movie?<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone for their support and contributions.<br>

 Hi Joel,
 
 can you explain what you mean with &quot;amount of applets on that page a 
 little too much&quot;? How did it appear to be slow? And what browser did 
 you use on what OS?
 
 Cheers!

Thanks very much for the movie, lots of great cubers there! Thank you
for not showing any of my slow solves also ;)

It&#x27;s a shame the light was coming from behind us, good for cubing but
not so great for taking movies... so considering this you did a really
great job.

40 animated cubes in 40 applets use to be definitely too many on a low
end computer (500MHz, 256MB, Win2000+IE5, MS JVM, unknown embedded
graphic chipset).
Very long loading/initialization time, slow page scrolling, I remember
my computer freezing completely on some pages.

Hi Stefan,

When I go to Leyan&#x27;s page, and try the &#x27;blindfold cubing&#x27; section, 
it takes a while to load, and then scrolling through the page is a 
bit awkward. And I know some people have slower computers than mine. 
I use IE 6 and Windows XP.

- Joël.

Scrolling down is awkward for me, too, at least on my laptop that&#x27;s 
now about 4 years old. When I scroll down, the applets visible before 
scrolling get their bottom repeated a few times, and new applets 
scrolling into the view aren&#x27;t displayed at all until I stop 
scrolling.

However. I downloaded Leyan&#x27;s files onto my local computer for 
testing. It still showed the same bad effect. Then I removed the 
fixed background image from the CSS file. And this made the page 
scroll perfectly alright. I&#x27;ve also googled for it and many people 
have reported fixed backgrounds slowing down scrolling considerably.

So at least in this case and for my computer, the applets themselves 
were *not* the problem. The fixed background was. Pedro, Per, I hope 
you now see I&#x27;m not as dumb as you might&#x27;ve thought, when I say I 
have good reasons to believe it&#x27;s not the applets, then I do have 
good reasons.

Also: Why does everybody seem to think all applets are the same? 
They&#x27;re not! Already their .class or .jar files differ a lot in size, 
and how the applets compute what they show can use very different 
amounts of resources as well. I think I could write an applet that 
can use all your cpu/memory if you just use it *once* on a page.

Josef&#x27;s page btw uses his applet 99 times and it&#x27;s no problem for my 
laptop:

          <div class="email-content">Yes of course not all applets are the same. Not all flash-content is 
the same either. At the end of the day speed is a very subjective 
thing. For me a 20 sec solve is fast, but for Joel it&#x27;s a disaster 
time. It&#x27;s generally a good idea to make web pages as small as 
possible. This seems to have been forgotten as most people now have 
fast connection unlike in the modem/isdn days. That said, some 
countries still have for the most part very slow internet connection. 
This is the case in Philippines where my wife is from. OK folks, 
those who didn&#x27;t know it yet, im happily married :D Designing with 
combination of imagecube and applets is a good idea imho. An image 
loads much faster than an applet. If you design the &quot;first&quot; page 
without applets you will also (maybe) avoid the delay of starting up 
the jvm until it&#x27;s really needed. You may not need interactivity, so 
a picture may be good enough. What Stefan says about making scroling 
faster doens&#x27;t contradict anything i have said. However fixing a 
given code like fixing the html/php/css or whatever is an expert 
solution!

(For those making webpages i have a simple tip: use gif&#x27;s not jpg or 
bmp for cube diagrams. Standard bmp files are VERY big. Jpg is good 
for pictures (photographs) but less suitable for simple diagrams. For 
diagrams gif will be quite a bit smaller in most cases and will be 
lossless. Jpg is not lossless unless so chosen. And if you want 
lossless jpg it&#x27;s just same as bmp ;-) Png format is also ok if using 
only 256 colors. Internet explorer (up to version 6 anyway) has some 
issues with transparency of png files.)

Hey Stefan,<br>
<br>
Those applets on Josef Jelinek&#x27;s page do form a problem for me. Same <br>
story as with Leyan&#x27;s page. Takes long to load, is awkward to scroll <br>
through. <br>
<br>
You say the applets on Leyan&#x27;s page were *not* the problem, but I am <br>
definately sure they were at least adding to the problem, since I <br>
don&#x27;t have the same problem on the parts of the site without applets.<br>

          <div class="email-content">>From what I&#x27;ve read over the years, and from my own experience, this
estimate sounds about right to me. The F2L is often about 2/3 of the
total time of my solve (I average ~28 seconds). Excluding lucky solves,
any variation in my times is almost entirely due to the F2L. So a normal
F2L for me is a bit under 20 seconds, a good F2L for is mid-teens, and a
really fast F2L for me is low teens.

Note that this 2/3 F2L estimate is about right once you&#x27;ve learnt things
and have done some practice. I recall when I first moved to F2L (but
couldn&#x27;t yet recognise/execute cases properly) I had *huge* variation in
my F2L times!!

Happy cubing,
Jasmine

          <div class="email-content">I agree with you jasmine, time spend on F2L is about 2/3 of the total
time, When I was at 15s avg, i used to do my F2L In about 9.5-10s and
the LL in 4.5-5s. To my mind, the limits are about 6-7s for F2L and
3-4s for the LL.
It would be great that sub12 cubers (except Nathan M. alias The New
Dan Gosbee:))) explain us the time he spend on each step, but I think
its probably close to what I said.

Keep on cubing everyone.

Yeah ok, though that&#x27;s exactly what I meant. It *was* slow for me 
until I removed that background. So I was not talking about 
differences between my computer and yours for the same page, but 
between two versions of the page on the same computer.

Anyway, thanks Joel for mentioning Josef&#x27;s page is still slow on your 
computer. I&#x27;ll try Josef&#x27;s page on my very old PC when I visit my 
parents again.

Btw, I do think using images before applets might be a good idea and 
I might start using it on my own site, too. After all I&#x27;m the guy who 
repeatedly asked people in the TwistyPuzzles forum to not use huge 
images, for similar reasons. I just don&#x27;t believe a general statement 
like &quot;X applets on one page are too much&quot; is generally valid, since 
not all applets are the same, and not all pages are the same, either.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve got a &quot;metal&quot; cube up on ebay (these were given out at the 2003 World Championships <br>
in Toronto) so check it out if you&#x27;re interested.  The auction ends on Friday.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
just a couple of quick questions about my new twenty color dogic:<br>
<br>
1.  Is lubing it a remotely good idea?  I&#x27;m afraid to since it&#x27;s so intricate, but that could also <br>
loosen it up and make popping less likely.  let me know.<br>
<br>
2. I have solved it up until two final switched pieces.  Is this a valid position/parity error?  It <br>
popped a couple of pieces and I think I put it back together correctly... if it is a valid position <br>
I&#x27;ll just have to figure out some way to switch them back (yay!).  I&#x27;m not using any particular <br>
method, just one that I&#x27;ve made up as I&#x27;m going.<br>
<br>
thanks,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan :-)

I know of 2 such programs:

Clement Keylie Gallet has a C++ program that he used to search for PLL-
parity cases on 4x4x4 with. It was originally designed solely for that 
but has been modified later to be more general. You should contact him 
to hear about the current status of his program.

Also there is a 4x4x4 version of ACube which seems to be hard to find 
on the net. If u need i can send it to you or you may request it from 
Josef Jelinek himself :-)

Be aware that it takes a long time to find 12- or 13-turn algorithms on 
a 4x4x4 even with good algorithms and clever coding. If your input 
state has a (much) longer solution it may take &quot;forever&quot; to find it :-s

Cheers!

Hi, yes I&#x27;ve figured out how to orient everything except for 1-2
corner pieces... whenever i try to solve for the last two top layer
bottom left and right corners... R&#x27;B&#x27;RB sequence and everything
doesn&#x27;t work... any tips?

          <div class="email-content">those videos Tyson made were on Rubiks.com site somewhere, and may 
still be there, and I agree they were pretty easy to follow for 
beginners.  I emailed them to an old friend in another state who had 
never touched the cube but got one for Christmas, and she was able 
to learn to solve the cube just with those videos and a couple of 
pointers from me.

I have them on my PC and can email them if you can&#x27;t find them at 
rubiks.com

happy cubing!

lately i have been studying the peg system for memorization with a

this for memorizing in blindfold solving? does anyone use this method? 
im sure memorizing the numbers may not be too difficult but i want to 
see if this is faster, thanks.

 Just thought it would be nice sharing this. As some of you might know, 
 I went to visit Matt Walter around december and januari. I made a 
 selection of pictures from that trip to put on my website. You can see 
 them here:

 Or go to www.solvethecube.co.uk --> Pictures.
 
 I hope you like them ;). Not only cubes, also a lot of general fun :).

          <div class="email-content">Those videos are also on youtube.com and they are very good. I like
the way he explains corners on the first layer and how it transfers to
putting an edge in the 2nd layer.

getting very use to it now. I used the instructions on Macky&#x27;s site so
i use numbers too. Though i learned that its much easier for me to
imagine the path in which the cubies are moving and using the numbers
as references rather than the main memory scheme. I&#x27;ve so far done 3
sucssessful solves out of about 6 trys, so far so good i think? :D
well good luck on your BLD solves.

          <div class="email-content">Try letting the lube dry for awhile or use a blow-dryer and just go
around the cube for about 20-30 sec on each face this tends to help
cube be less loose and cause pops but still move freely. I eventually
moved to an eastsheen cube and haven&#x27;t had a problem at all with it.

ooh and about the chess part. We sometimes have a training where our
trainer sets up a position and we can look shortly to it, then he
removes the position from the board and chats with us for over 40 sec
(the short term memory usualy last for about 30). After that we have
to reposition the position again on our own board. We succeed often in
this. But, we remember a position not like Daniel does we remember it
in relations and patterns. He is truly amazing. In a way his
calculation and emotional things in his brain are linked. I also saw
some people on TV who could taste words. Very strange, for instance
you&#x27;d say: determent and he tasted a bitter taste...

     I&#x27;ve been looking for a 4x4 and a 5x5 for a while now. I used to<br>
have a Rubik&#x27;s 4x4, but it broke (center piece broke). I&#x27;ve searched<br>
the forum and see that meany prefer Eastsheen 4x4&#x27;s and 5x5&#x27;s over<br>
Rubik&#x27;s, but I want to know for sure before I buy one. <br>
<br>
So what&#x27;s better, Eastsheen 4x4&#x27;s and 5x5&#x27;s or Rubik&#x27;s? And why?<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I have noticed that the &quot;1152-fold&quot; symmetry that benbest_06 mentions
was talked about by Jerry Bryan in the archives of the Cube-Lovers
e-mail list. I include some links to some of these messages at the bottom.

I had mentioned that it should also be possible to use antisymmetry to
further reduce the number of &quot;postions.&quot; Jerry Bryan calculated 77802
&quot;positions&quot; or symmetry classes when you reduce the 88+ million corner
positions by 1152-fold symmetry. I confirm that I also get 77802
symmetry classes. I went another step, though, and used antisymmetry
to get a total of only 40296 &quot;symmetry-antisymmetry classes.&quot; The
table below gives the number of classes of each size.

class size ~ count
---------- ~ -----
~~~~ 24 ~~~~~~~~ 1
~~~~ 48 ~~~~~~~~ 1
~~~~ 72 ~~~~~~~~ 3
~~~~ 96 ~~~~~~~~ 1
~~~ 144 ~~~~~~~ 14
~~~ 192 ~~~~~~~ 11
~~~ 288 ~~~~~~~ 49
~~~ 384 ~~~~~~~ 22
~~~ 576 ~~~~~~ 337
~~~ 768 ~~~~~~~~ 6
~~ 1152 ~~~~~ 3353
~~ 2304 ~~~~ 36498
~~~~~~~~~~~~ -----
total ~~~~~~ 40296

Using these 40296 classes, I recalculated God&#x27;s algorithm tables in
QTM and HTM. The summary of the results are below. I include the
number of positions (in terms of the standard 3674160 positions with a
fixed cubie) for reference.

half-turn metric

distance  classes  positions
~~~ 0 ~~~~~~~~ 1 ~~~~~~~~~ 1
~~~ 1 ~~~~~~~~ 2 ~~~~~~~~~ 9
~~~ 2 ~~~~~~~~ 4 ~~~~~~~~ 54
~~~ 3 ~~~~~~~ 14 ~~~~~~~ 321
~~~ 4 ~~~~~~~ 41 ~~~~~~ 1847
~~~ 5 ~~~~~~ 157 ~~~~~~ 9992
~~~ 6 ~~~~~~ 612 ~~~~~ 50136

~~ 10 ~~~~~ 7013 ~~~~ 623800
~~ 11 ~~~~~~~~56 ~~~~~~ 2644
~~~~~~~~~  ----- ~~~ -------
~~~~~~~~~~ 40296 ~~~ 3674160


quarter-turn metric

distance  classes  positions
~~~ 0 ~~~~~~~~ 1 ~~~~~~~~~ 1
~~~ 1 ~~~~~~~~ 1 ~~~~~~~~~ 6
~~~ 2 ~~~~~~~~ 3 ~~~~~~~~ 27
~~~ 3 ~~~~~~~~ 4 ~~~~~~~ 120
~~~ 4 ~~~~~~~ 13 ~~~~~~~ 534
~~~ 5 ~~~~~~~ 35 ~~~~~~ 2256
~~~ 6 ~~~~~~ 126 ~~~~~~ 8969
~~~ 7 ~~~~~~ 398 ~~~~~ 33058
~~~ 8 ~~~~~ 1301 ~~~~ 114149
~~~ 9 ~~~~~ 3952 ~~~~ 360508
~~ 10 ~~~~ 10086 ~~~~ 930588
~~ 11 ~~~~ 14658 ~~~ 1350852
~~ 12 ~~~~~ 8619 ~~~~ 782536
~~ 13 ~~~~~ 1091 ~~~~~ 90280
~~ 14 ~~~~~~~~ 8 ~~~~~~~ 276

My code for generating the classes, is not very efficient, so my
program actually takes longer to generate the classes than my older
program took to run that did a more brute-force God&#x27;s algorithm
calculation. By the way, my old program took about 26 seconds to run
for QTM, and about 33 seconds to run for HTM (2.4GHz Pentium 4). But I
did not generate lookup tables for the cube moves, so it could be much
faster.

Here are the &quot;links&quot; I mentioned above. They are long and I only give
the base part once, so you will have to paste things together to use them.

          <div class="email-content">Rubik brand 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 pop Eastsheen are made like a 3x3x3 on its
internal parts and tend not to pop as easy. Also since the Eastsheen 
cubes are made from a plastic company are less likely to break if I&#x27;m
wrong someone correct me on this. It also depends on the person to. I
had a Rubik brand 4x4x4 and it was amazing never needed lube, but many
of the centers did break. My Eastsheen needed some spray and is close
to my Rubik 4x4x4 but not the same, but from rubik to eastsheen my
times decreased by over 30sec. I think the big plus for me was the
size difference. The eastsheen are considerably smaller than rubik and
if turning a side is difficult because of the size I would suggest
eastsheen. 

Hope this helps.

Nice article.
I especially like this sentence:
&quot;It is interesting to note that time spent playing chess, even in 
tournaments, appears to contribute less than such study to a player&#x27;s 
progress; the main training value of such games is to point up weaknesses 
for future study.&quot;

Just translate that to speedcubing...

Have fun,

Ron

Better than some other documentaries about this topic, did have some
good moments. But also still a lot of crap. Here&#x27;s an article I can
recommend:

IMHO alg memorisation is also a physical thing. And besides, if that

would be the point ... hehe ;-)

With today computers we can calculate infinite numbers of decimals of 
pi. It&#x27;s not interesting anymore. But those who calculated thousands 
of decimals by hand hundreds of yrs ago really amaze me ;-) And of 
course all those who memorise lots of decimals. Just like cubing it&#x27;s 
impressive but useless ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Well, it&#x27;s still interesting because the number of digits is not 
infinite, but some very large finite number.  Therefore, the mission 
becomes who can calculate at a faster rate.

Seems kind of silly, but the idea of being able to deal with huge 
numbers or many digits of something like pi can be important.  Think 
about what your government uses to send coded messages?  If you had a 
computer that could factor prime numbers really well, they&#x27;d be in 
trouble.

worked out a formula for finding out the next prime, they would be in
trouble.

 This is WRONG!! it&#x27;s proven that pi is an irrational number! It can 
not be written simply as x/y where x and y some (very large) integers. 
If the number of decimals were a very high finite number then pi would 
be rational, not hard to prove ... Multiply by a factor of 10 until the 
decimals vanish .. etc etc ...

That&#x27;s not entirely true; we only have calculated (and can only

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Ah ok maybe that was what he meant and not that pi has a finite 
number of decimals. Even so it&#x27;s not interesting. In order to publish 
a number of decimals one must stop calculation after a finite number 
of iterations (decimals). Technically we CAN calculate infinite 
decimals, it&#x27;s just a matter of persistency who will do the highest 
number. It&#x27;s purely mechanical. No thought process involved. The 
numerical series they use for calculations are the same. It&#x27;s just a 
matter of who had the fastest computer and who let it run for 
longest. Another point is that even if we calculate infinite numbers 
of decimals we cannot store them all! We need an infinite-capacity 
storage device to store infinite numbers of decimals. So i still 
retain that these calculations are not interesting. Of course that&#x27;s 
just my subjective opinion :-)

Forgive my ignorance, but how do we know that pi is a finite number. I&#x27;m
taking High School Geometry and they&#x27;ve always taught us that pi is
infinite.

Just wondering,

Dude! Since when do we need a computer to factor *prime numbers*? 
Gotcha!

1. Pi *is* finite. You probably mean pi&#x27;s *decimal representation*.
2. You completely missed Tyson&#x27;s point.

Only if we have infinite time. Are you claiming you know we&#x27;ll exist 
forever?

Are they? Or maybe *you* just know one way? There are different 
algorithms, they are interesting, and they do require a lot of 
thinking. They don&#x27;t even all have the same goal, for example some 
people have computed few bits very far into the decimal 
representation, *without* computing all previous bits:

http://oldweb.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/pihex/announce40t.html

I recommend reading the abstract and first paragraph of the PDF on 
that page.

I correct myself: we could also achieve it in finite time if we had 
infinitely many computers. Or whatever. In any case, I doubt we&#x27;re 
able to do it.

          <div class="email-content">With his ability to recognize patterns I wonder if he could identify
the scrambles that are the same distance from solved intuitively or by
some other means of seeing the pattern.  If he knew a scramble was
probably 19 or 21 quarter turns from solved he might be able to intuit
a shortest solution.  I say a shortest solution because most likely
there are a number of possible ones to choose from for any given state.

Anyone could learn to distinguish cases requiring even or odd numbers
of quarter turns to solve.  But could he learn to distinguish a 19
move case vs. a 21 move case -  or an 18 move case from a 20 move
case?  Or could he at least have an idea of how to do 1 or 2 moves in
the beginning such that he leaves himself with a solution that is
*probably* only 18-19 moves from solved?  I say 18-19 but really that
could be any relatively small number such that it is possible to
intuit a solution given a lot of time to think.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

My main point is that the decimals of pi in themselves are not at all 
interesting. Will those decimals enable us to do better engineering 
or raise our intelligence or anything like that? Nope ... it&#x27;s just 
aninfinite series of integers with no patterns of repetition ...

There may well be some mathematical algoritms that perform better 
than others. We cannot even save arbitrarily large numbers of 
decimals, so what would be the point og generating überexcessive 
amounts of decimals. The decimals could never be used constructively 
in any fashion.

I guess these calculations have purely philosophical interst for me, 
not any practical interest. Well i leave it open that parallellizing 
the computation may have some interest.

Would massively parallell calculations work for the cube when 
searching for gods algorithm? Why or why not?

15 turn f2l + Helmstedter algs is not really the best way going about 
it when solving fewest moves. For sure you will get very good linear 
solutions, but the best approaches in my experince are based on doing 
insertions at the end ...

He would however probably be very good at the &quot;undoing n random turns&quot; 
game :-) My best ever was undoing 9 turns, but i guess i was lucky when 
i did that. Normally 6 or 7 is already hard :-o

Are there limitaions for number of competitors? Is that not against 
the WCA rules?

>From article 8:

    8b) An open competition is open to anyone. 
    8c) A closed competition may be open to:

    persons with a specific nationality

On the theoretical side the answer is: yes, there can be a limit of 
competitors.
Since it is not in the regulations, the competition organisers are free on 
that subject.
The website of WC 2007 is clear about the limits.

On the practical side the answer is: yes, of course. There is no way we can 
handle 1,000 competitors in Swedish Open 2007.

Have fun,

Ron

 Are there limitaions for number of competitors? Is that not against 
 the WCA rules?
 
 From article 8:
 
 8b) An open competition is open to anyone. 
     8c) A closed competition may be open to:
 
 persons with a specific nationality 
     citizens of specific geographical areas 
     members of specific clubs 
     students / employees of specific organisations. 
     No other distinctions are allowed to declare a competition closed.
 
 (b says it clearly, 8c lists nothing that tells me why this competion 
 is not open to anyone.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

It has been 2 months now that the world championship was announced.
The website has been open for 11 days.

Of course we are looking at ways to manage this situation. But there are 
still almost 7 months to go, so we have to keep our options open.
What we may do is have preliminary rounds for some events on Friday morning.
That is also what the FAQ page says.

This doesn&#x27;t mean that you should wait very long before preregistering. You 
have your chance now!
For example, if we have preliminary rounds, then we will only have them for 
one or more main events. Definitely not for the side events.

Just don&#x27;t think this is easy to do. The number of events per competitor is 
higher than ever.
Currently there is no official way to favor high-ranked competitors. This 
will be one of the things we can do for the next version of the WCA 
regulations.

Have fun,

Ron

I do wonder if this year will be the last WC where anyone can just
sign up and show up to compete. It is inevitable, given the growth
rate of our little hobby, that we will eventually have qualifying
times for a World Championship.   I guess we&#x27;d have to look at other
sports and see how they handle such things.  

Ideally, we&#x27;d say that each country has their own national competition
and send their top X amount of competitors.  But then countries that
don&#x27;t have many people are either left out, or unbalanced in their
representation.  But, thankfully, this is not for me to figure out. 
Good luck, Ron.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Edouard,

I do not agree with your definition of unfair.
Fairness to me is that everyone has the same circumstances.
If you have better light conditions, or can use a different procedure, or 
can compete without an audience, that would be unfair. It is also fair that 
someone has more time to practice than someone else.
You could argue that using your own cube is unfair (given the fact that some 
guys have better cubes than others).

I agree with you that there are many other ways to measure the results.
For example we could take the average of all attempts of a competition.
But there are many arguments why such changes would not be suitable. I won&#x27;t 
go into details here.

We have fair regulations. If you want to be the next world champion, then 
win according to these regulations.

Have fun,

Ron

Ok, I understand.

My personal problem is that I do not have a clue if I&#x27;m able to come 
to a competition that takes palce half a year from now.

What to do then? register anyway and maybe not been able to come is 
not a fair thing to do, I would take someone elses place then, 
someone who is able to come but did not register in time.

So I won&#x27;t register...

I see what you mean. (There would be another option: Judge a
competitor on its best average, done during any preliminary or final
round)

Just consider intermediary rounds as a warm up and as another chance
to break records.
For a slower cuber, they&#x27;re a challenge to be select among the best
and proceed to a new level.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Edouard,

I think you are wrong. Take for example athletics and running, the
guys in the final do not take any advantage from winning previous
heats into the final with them. 

There are no differences in the situations of each timer (at least
there shouldn&#x27;t be), like there are in lanes on the athletics track.

And this format has been the standard for more than 3 years, I don&#x27;t
see any good reason to change it. It is a lot more exciting when you
HAVE to perform in the final, and not rely on good times you have
posted in earlier rounds.

Dan :)

I really don&#x27;t like the idea that each country can only send a fixed
number of competitors, since this is an individual sport and the
nationality shall not be a factor if you can compete or not. For
instance, a lot of french or US top-cubers will not be allowed to take
part and in a WC the point is (according to my opinion) to get to know
who is the world&#x27;s best cubers. If several presumed top-10 cubers in
the world can&#x27;t participate we can&#x27;t be sure that the best cuber wins.

(PS. I also think this should be the case for all other individual
sports like swimming, athletics etc.)

          <div class="email-content">Dan, you&#x27;re wrong.
In running, the man who wins the semi final choose the number of the
line he&#x27;ll run in the final. That&#x27;s a great advantage, more than you
think it is. 

I think the best option could be : 
On 3 rounds : 
1/4 * avg of 1st round + 1/4 * avg of 2nd round + 1/2 avg of the final
= avg who decide who has won the competition.
The final is more important but the other rounds are important too.
I don&#x27;t want now to make the situation change, but just to make you
think about it.........

But you&#x27;re not suggesting to choose the line. You&#x27;re suggesting to 
take the times of the previous runs into account. They *don&#x27;t* do 
that.

P.S. I agree with Ron about not seeing any reason to call it 
&quot;unfair&quot;. Everybody has the same chance to win.

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Edouard on this one, halfway at least.  I wouldn&#x27;t call
it unfair.  However, if you think about it, the person who wins isn&#x27;t
nescessarily the best performing cuber during the event.  What if
someone performed very well in the final round, and low/decent in the
previous round?  They end up taking first in the competition because
they had the best average in the last round.  However, if you look at
someone who performed decent/well in all three rounds, and if average
all of their times together, they may have a higher average overall. 
Therefore, they performed better overall in the competition.

The way I see it now is nice, but I definitely think you should take
in account all rounds to decide a winner, and not just the last.

saw the heading &quot;Prince: Solve the Rubik&#x27;s cube.&quot; It says the prince<br>

problem of world wide water shortage, poverty and environmental damage<br>
is one that resembles a Rubik&#x27;s cube, and we need to solve it.<br>

A very good analogy as he describes it. Now if someone can give him<br>
the algorithms to solve these world problems.<br>

 The way I see it now is nice, but I definitely think you should take in account all rounds to decide a winner, and not just the last.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I agree with Ron (and others). Consider a first-time cuber...the
person might do above his/her &quot;average&quot; times, but as the competition
progress, he/she gets used to the &quot;competition pressure&quot; and starts
hitting nice times that he was able to do at home/unofficially. If you
take into all the solves in the competition, it would bring down the
avg...would that mean that the person is worse?

Taking all the competition times into a grand average is not an option.
For now we have 2 formats for (3x3x3) records: Single and Average of 5.
Competition ranking must correspond to such formats. Otherwise, it
really gets awkward.

But I understand what bothers Edouard, and I think he has a good point
when he says you get no benefit of having a good rank in preliminary
rounds.

Regarding this point, keeping the best average, whatever the round,
could be interesting. Good times in semi-finals would make finals very
challenging.

&gt; it has blue across from white. This has thrown be off a bit. I also<br>
&gt; just ordered one of the Studio cubes (from Hungary) which has the<br>
&gt; yellow/white. Any comments on what the &quot;official&quot; cube should look<br>
&gt; like? What do they use in competition? Should I get an old &quot;Ideal&quot;<br>
&gt; model if I can find one? These look like White/Blue. Maybe I&#x27;m making<br>
&gt; too much of this.<br>
<br>
The competition rules don&#x27;t say anything about the color scheme,<br>
except that you (and the judges) have to be able to distinguish the<br>
colors of the six faces. You can use any color scheme you want in a<br>
competition, so just use the one that you are most used to.<br>
<br>
By the way, you can change the color scheme on a cube by taking the<br>
stickers off and reapplying them the way you prefer, or by taking them<br>
off and replacing all the stickers with a new set of stickers (or even<br>
a new set of tiles) in the color scheme that you prefer. Don&#x27;t do this<br>
if you don&#x27;t need to, but remember that it is an option.<br>

I agree : that&#x27;s hard to create a new format and it will be more

When I mean fair, I mean that the best in that competition wins.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think that taking all the competition times and averaging them
is a good idea.  Personally, I don&#x27;t like the idea because a lot of
competitions have several rounds and normally the first round is in
the morning when I am not warmed up and not fully awake.  I don&#x27;t
normally feel as pressured to do well because I feel like I only need
to qualify.

I remember someone suggesting that the final round could possibly be
an average of 10 or something like that since most finalists are
faster and it wouldn&#x27;t take very much more time to run the round. 
Another suggestion is an average of 9, dropping the 2 fastest and 2
slowest.  This way, it is more representative of a person&#x27;s true speed
and it is less likely that someone just has a good couple of solves.

That&#x27;s a highly subjective view, though, different people have 
different opinions about what&#x27;s the best way to measure. *I* for 
example think the best in the competition is the one who&#x27;s the best 
when it matters, i.e., the one who&#x27;s best in the final.

That&#x27;s just not true. You do have a benefit of having a good rank in 
preliminary rounds: you progress into the next rounds.

One of the justifications for his suggestion was like &quot;other sports 
do it&quot;. Name me a sport which has competitions of several rounds, 
where the results of the previous rounds influence the result of the 
final round in a way similar to what he suggests. The sports I 
remember having been used for analogies in the past: tennis, running, 
jumping, swimming... no, none of those do that as far as I know.

Cheers!
Stefan

No, Edouard was saying something like:
- Semi-finals: Thibaut Tchang averages 12.30 and Stefan Heise averages
17.87.
- Finals: T.T. does 15.03 and S.H. 15.02.
- Isn&#x27;t it a problem to anyone that T.T. can&#x27;t get any benefit from
his wonderful semi-finals average? *At least, in many sports, there&#x27;s
an advantage for performing better*

Cubing is not like many sports, analogies should be cautiously
considered. There&#x27;s a thing that makes cubing a special. You&#x27;re
competing alone. Cubers don&#x27;t really take care to other competitors&#x27;
times in the round, they just try to be as good as they can.
It&#x27;s not like a race, where you need the final round with the best
competitors selected, high-level competition, to make you faster than
what you thought possible.
Past results have proven that a cuber can break records in
semi-finals. Of course, averages often improve between semi-finals and
finals, because of the need of warming up, but that&#x27;s different.

My opinion is that only 1 round would be more logical and perfectly
fair. (...it would be possible...different selection process...WCA
rankings...etc...)

  No, Edouard was saying something like:
  - Semi-finals: Thibaut Tchang averages 12.30 and Stefan Heise averages
  17.87.
  - Finals: T.T. does 15.03 and S.H. 15.02.

  his wonderful semi-finals average? *At least, in many sports, there&#x27;s
  an advantage for performing better*

  Cubing is not like many sports, analogies should be cautiously
  considered. There&#x27;s a thing that makes cubing a special. You&#x27;re
  competing alone. Cubers don&#x27;t really take care to other competitors&#x27;
  times in the round, they just try to be as good as they can.
  It&#x27;s not like a race, where you need the final round with the best
  competitors selected, high-level competition, to make you faster than
  what you thought possible.
  Past results have proven that a cuber can break records in
  semi-finals. Of course, averages often improve between semi-finals and
  finals, because of the need of warming up, but that&#x27;s different.

  My opinion is that only 1 round would be more logical and perfectly
  fair. (...it would be possible...different selection process...WCA
  rankings...etc...)

Hello everyone, interesthing conversation this is.

First of all, i think it&#x27;s not a good idea to take the average of all
the rounds.
For example, at the belgian open, the first round all competitors were
divided into three groups.
Every group had different scrambles, so other competitors could judge
and scramble the other groups.
This way not everyone has the same 15 scrambles if you take the
average of them all.

But in some sports it is true that premiliary round times effect the
&quot;finals&quot;.
Atlethics and swimming was allreaddy mentioned.
Indeed it is a big advantaged if you can shoose the lane you&#x27;re
swimming/running in.
Normally the fastest of the previous round is taking the middle lane.

And there are sports like formula 1, where the time of the previous
round effects the starting row.
I don&#x27;t think anyone would dissagree this is a big advantage if you
have the best qualification time.

Personally I would prefer as others said an average of more then 5
solves in the finals.
Seems to me that is the fairest.

Greetings Tobias D.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Edouard :-)

I think you are actually confusing fairness with representativeness! 
Everyone has to go through the same rounds with same rules and 
scrambles as everyone else. Whether the times in the final really 
represent a person&#x27;s true speeed is another matter. It&#x27;s not related 
to fairness. It&#x27;s just my own subjective opinion on the matter...

Bon courage :D

Isn&#x27;t this the point of the waiting list, though? You sign up now if
you think you may be going.  If you end up going, great, you already
reserved your spot. If you don&#x27;t go, you have the courtesy to let the
organizer know before hand, and then the next person on the waiting
list is bumped up into the now available spot.  

So basically, just register.

I would not have any problem if semi-finals and finals would be really
different, the final being a tough competition where competitors
&quot;fight&quot; against each others, watching others performance, where you
could really feel the pressure. And not &quot;just another identical round
where competitors cube alone&quot;. A very special one.

An analogy with another sport where skill and nerves are important
could be made: Archery.

<br>
I recently got two black DIYKits (tagged as &quot;Best for speedcubing&quot;)<br>
from 9spuzzles.com, the cube is really really nice, especially after<br>
lubing, but the stickers really suck..<br>
<br>
Did I have bad luck or can anybody confirm that? They seem to be<br>
synthetic/plastic (dont know the exact english word), no paper. They<br>
peel of quite easy and while doing U or U&#x27; (with my index fingers) I<br>
always seem to scratch on the stickers with my fingernails (and my<br>
fingernails are not that long).. After one week of playing with it,<br>
nearly every not-center sticker is scratched :-(<br>
<br>
What kind of stickers are there and what are the best ones? I read<br>
about PVC, PET and those papery things which look ugly as soon as they<br>
get wet. Finder (the guy owning 9spuzzles) told me that the cube I got<br>
came with PVC stickers and that they are the best. I also have some<br>
Ideal/Arxon and Studio Cubes and the stickers are MUCH better.. Where<br>
can I get stickers of that quality?<br>
<br>
I read about cubesmith.com, are those stickers as good as I read?<br>
Anybody has experience with shipping to germany?<br>

          <div class="email-content">There are a *lot* of different models for this in different sports.  
Pretty much any way you can think of is done by some sport.

In long jump, everyone gets three jumps. The top N jumpers after that  
get 3 more, but the end result is still the best jump of all 6. Note  
that that is a &quot;best of&quot; sport, while we care about averages.

Ideally, everyone would get some statistically significant number of  
solves, such as 10 or 50, and we&#x27;d then find the best average cuber  
at the end of that. sadly, this would take weeks and drive everyone  
crazy. So we need something faster, while still trying to make it fair.

One model is that everyone starts doing solves, and after every (say)  
3 moves you throw out the lower (say) half, while keeping a running  
average. Once you only have sub 20 cubers around, things can go very  
fast.

Note that I&#x27;m not saying we should do this, just brain storming.

And note that there is a conflict between fairness and excitement. If  
the best cuber always wins, things get boring, and it&#x27;s less nerve  
wracking for the competitors. Many sports (wrestling, table tennis  
etc) are changing their rules to have shorter and more exciting games  
to become more spectator and TV friendly.

Also, like Gilles said, the 2007 WC has to be run under the 2007  
competition rules, so it&#x27;s too late to try to change anything for that.

          <div class="email-content">I am too young and inexperienced to join you in this discussion. However, I hope you will let me express my thoughts.
  I had noticed in some competition results that the time in semi finals is worse than  those disqualified after 1st round. Won&#x27;t it bother those disqualified in the first round? Then why first round, semi and finals?  Let all the competitors compete in all 3 rounds. Then the thrill is missing.
  For me my final time was worse than semi and first round in the only competition I competed. Still, no regret. Finals is finals - testing of ones mental, physical and emotional skills together. It was a thrill for me.

That&#x27;s just not true. You do have a benefit of having a good rank in 
preliminary rounds: you progress into the next rounds.

One of the justifications for his suggestion was like &quot;other sports 
do it&quot;. Name me a sport which has competitions of several rounds, 
where the results of the previous rounds influence the result of the 
final round in a way similar to what he suggests. The sports I 
remember having been used for analogies in the past: tennis, running, 
jumping, swimming... no, none of those do that as far as I know.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ian,

The main reason why I am personally against 12 solves in a final is easy.
The WCA is there for ALL competitors, not for the FASTEST competitors.
Remember our mission is: more competitions in more countries with more 
people and more fun, under fair conditions.
So if we should add attempts, then I think we should add them for all 
competitors, not only the finalists.

We have to run a final in 30 minutes. The media are not planning to stay for 
hours.
We want to show them blindfolded final, then 3x3 final, then they go again. 
And we will be on the news in the evening.
What we are doing now is have 16 instead of 12 competitors in final. This 
way it will take a bit longer.
So basically we have to choose between 8 competitors with 12 attempts, or 16 
competitors with 5 attempts.
I prefer the latter.

About accepting all solves of a competition for the end result.
Last week I won a local competition with the following results:
1st round: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average 10.00 seconds
semi final: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average 10.00 seconds
final: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average 10.00 seconds
Overall competition average: DNF.
Any other method: finals would be boooooooooooooooooring.

The winner is the one who wins the final. Like Rune said: the pressure in 
semi final is different.

Have fun,

Ron

I agree. (Read my post above, the 3x3x3 finals should be something
special)
But I don&#x27;t like averages of 12-2 in competition. There&#x27;s a reason
people often forget, it&#x27;s about the audience (well, in most cube
competitions, including major ones, there&#x27;s almost no audience expect
cubers and their parents). 12*n times means dilution, too many times
to keep an eye on. And boring.
Averages of 5-2 are ok, but final rounds should not be too fast (not 8
unsynchronized and parallelized competitors). Maybe only 4 competitors
at the same time, with a speaker announcing their names, reading the
times, and making the pressure go up.

It&#x27;s good to read back the report. Sorry for refusing to play that 
game in that restaurant :). I don&#x27;t really know why, but I was 
totally not in the mood for it. But I had a nice meal there anyway.

Yes, that other roommate of us was a very cool guy. I actually 
planned going to bed early, and I ended up talking to this guy for 
an hour or so. His name was Yo (short for Yo Ske, not sure how to 
write it). He was travelling all by himself, so I thought it would 
be nice to give him some company. He was actually quite interested 
in the cube too :).

          <div class="email-content">Right, and you can keep the best competitors in the semi-finals for
the very end of the finals (reverse order).
Better show, and this way there&#x27;s an advantage(?) for those competing
later, since they know the times they have to beat to keep a good ranking.

How would making the final avg 12 solves decrease the amount from each country?  I don&#x27;t think that would have the slightest impact on it.  I also don&#x27;t see how this would be unfair.  The fairness would remain the same.  The representation of the performance of each solver in the final would be improved.  And increasing the avg among all rounds is great too, just improves the accuracy, however, it isn&#x27;t nescessary (nor is the &quot;plan&quot; I am talking about on throughout this post).

Woah, wait a sec.  Are we basing the way an event occurs off what the media needs/wants?  I personally think that the event should occur, regardless of media, and then media comes afterward.  The time the media &quot;plans&quot; to stay should be irrelevant.  I sure hope that speed-solving events don&#x27;t begin to revolve around the media the slightest.

> Overall competition average: DNF.

I don&#x27;t understand that logic.

Lastly, I just want to give you my opinion on this.  Make 12 solves in the final would basically just give more representation to how well a solver performs.  5 is a low amount to average by, and yes, it works fine as it is.  But to give a more accurate representation to who really is the best at any given event would be to increase the amount of solves, 12 happens to be a good number.

 The main reason why I am personally against 12 solves in a final is easy.
 The WCA is there for ALL competitors, not for the FASTEST competitors.
 Remember our mission is: more competitions in more countries with more 
 people and more fun, under fair conditions.
 So if we should add attempts, then I think we should add them for all 
 competitors, not only the finalists.
 
 We have to run a final in 30 minutes. The media are not planning to stay for 
 hours.
 We want to show them blindfolded final, then 3x3 final, then they go again. 
 And we will be on the news in the evening.
 What we are doing now is have 16 instead of 12 competitors in final. This 
 way it will take a bit longer.
 So basically we have to choose between 8 competitors with 12 attempts, or 16 
 competitors with 5 attempts.
 I prefer the latter.
 
 About accepting all solves of a competition for the end result.
 Last week I won a local competition with the following results:
 1st round: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average 10.00 seconds
 semi final: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average 10.00 seconds
 final: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average 10.00 seconds
 Overall competition average: DNF.
 Any other method: finals would be boooooooooooooooooring.
 
 The winner is the one who wins the final. Like Rune said: the pressure in 
 semi final is different.
 
 Have fun,
 
 Ron

 I remember thinking that, after days (or even years) of buildup
 leading to the finals of WC2005 in Orlando, the finals seemed to go by
 in the blink of an eye.
 
 I&#x27;ve always thought that 5 solves is too few in the finals and I&#x27;d
 really like to see it change to an average of 12.  Two good solves (or
 two bad ones) wouldn&#x27;t affect an average of 12 nearly as dramatically
 as they would affect an average of 5.
 
 I know this means that the finals will take longer than they currently
 do but I don&#x27;t think it would take too much longer since the 3x3 is
 quick to scramble and quick to solve (espeically by the caliber of
 finalist that we have today).  Further, the 3x3 is the main event in
 every tournament so I&#x27;d be okay with the 3x3 event getting even more
 time in tournaments.
 
 I have e-mailed Ron privately about this and I know he&#x27;s against it.
 Anyone else have thoughts on an average of 12 in the finals?
 
 Ian

          <div class="email-content">Changing the finals to 12 solves means competitors who make it to the finals get more <br>

For logistic reasons we also have to do some events of WC 2007 on Friday.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Patrick,

Thanks for your feedback.

I was trying to make three points:
1) if we have more attempts, ALL competitors should have more attempts
2) in special competitions like World Championship the final cannot take 
ages, because we have to think of our sponsors (and therefore of the media). 
I prefer to have more people in the final than the proposal to make the 
final longer by doing more attempts per competitor.
3) deciding the winner on the proposed measurements has flaws.

Please react to these three points.

Have fun,

Ron

The idea of an average of 7, which was said by someone, is a good idea
I think. But still removing the best and the worst is good.

All these questions and answers shows one thing : a lot of people
think that it have to be changed, like me. Of course, that&#x27;s easier to
critisize than to propose something better.
Ron, of course, we don&#x27;t have to average all the solves but average
all the averages.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
while we&#x27;re at talking rules, there&#x27;s an other one I&#x27;ve always considered as unfair (and I mean unfair...). The judges are given a cube to scramble and they have to scramble it whenever it&#x27;s possible with white on top and green on front. That&#x27;s fine to me, because this way everyone gets the same cube. But then the judges who takes the cube to the competitor can somehow move it around so for example for some competitors they&#x27;ll still be having white on top and green on front, but actually, since no one is paying attention to that, some won&#x27;t.<br>
Since we want to be fair with scrambling, why wouldn&#x27;t we want to be fair with giving the cube to the competitor. It especially makes sense in bld events where inspection is counted within the solving time, because some people will have to find their reference centers and some won&#x27;t (that&#x27;s maybe 0.5 to 1s , but that&#x27;s still not really fair).<br>
Of course you can consider that it&#x27;s good for you when you&#x27;re one of those who get their centers right, but shouldn&#x27;t we all get the *same* cube when we see it at first?<br>
I don&#x27;t really care, but that&#x27;s one rule that always seemed unfair to me. what do other people think about it?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Edouard,

If we want to go to average of 7, then we should also do it for earlier
rounds. I wonder how much it helps to better decide the winner. I am
sceptical. I have never felt that the best guy did not win.

> a lot of people think that it have to be changed, like me.
I don&#x27;t hate change either. I am just trying to make sure that we take
more things into consideration. I haven&#x27;t seen a good proposal yet.

I know, but with your proposal (1/4, 1/4, 1/2) finals might become very
boring.

Have fun,

Ron

I pose here that it is not manageable to make sure that the correct side

They *already* get more representation, full five more solves those 
who only make it to semi-finals. Why don&#x27;t you attack the *current* 
situation as well?

Also, can someone please provide a definition for &quot;unfair&quot; that 
matches usages like above? Everybody has the *same* chance to make it 
to the finals, nobody&#x27;s unfairly favored. How is it unfair? It&#x27;s not 
like we&#x27;re adding a second to the time of each Asian or something 
like that.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, I get all the points here.
It is realy not done to make the finals another format than the rest.
Also I think that the 1/4 1/2 finals should be of somewhat influence
but not the way that some people can&#x27;t win anymore before they have
even done their first solve in the finals. I like the idea of 2,3,4
people doing a whole average and then the next. The order is then
decided by the results in previous rounds, so the one with the best
results begins last. This is also done in other sports like ice
skating, bobsleading, tennis etc. I like the idea of a larger average
(I suggested avg of 7 earlier) but it is also true that the whole
competition should last longer then. An avg of 6 then maybe? ;)

          <div class="email-content">Well, about the fairness issue, my point is: of course you can consider it
fair having everyone getting the same randomness, but this way, some will
get lucky and some wont, and statistically therell always be someone
getting many times bad settings and someone getting many good settings.

Using the same position of the cube for everyone ensures that no matter how
you usually look at the cube, at least you can work at it, that is, know
that youll have to do the same (x/y/z) rotation, and make it be part of
your method. This way you avoid part of luck, and since everyone starts in
the exact same position no one can ever claim to have been disadvantaged.

But I see what you mean, Ron, you say, since its random, its random for
everyone. But some *will* get lucky. And some wont. While this way, youll
never have to deal with a unhappy competitor who says, hey, I got my cube in
a difficult rotation on the table, and this guy here got it right as he
wants it. Of course some people will be advantaged by having the cube
positioned with their own setting, but there are 2 possibilities then if
youre not using that exact same system: you can either work on doing some
xyz very fast before even starting to memorize OR change your method so that
you get the same setting.

What I dont understand is that you claim everyone is equal with the exact
same scramble, but would you still think it would be fair to have the same
scramble done in different orientations on different cubes? Thats what Im
pointing out. I hope you get my point.

How this can be realized in competition has yet to be found, but theres no
way you find a random scrambling orientation unfair and a random table
orientation fair. Because if you say that a random table orientation is
fair, then I suggest that you orient the cubes randomly before scrambling.
And why not having random scrambles for everyone? Everyone would get the
same randomness of scrambles, say 25 moves HTM, wouldnt they?

The only remaining question is how can it be done and ensured the cube is
in the right position before uncovering the cube for the competitor and what
if the judge forgets to set the cube and the competitor complains. Thats
another point.

Hope Im not sounding too harsh, dont have time to reread.

François

          <div class="email-content">To put down the cube randomly is only a logical continuation of the random scrambling (in the sense that practically nobody plays identically with anybody else; different systems (or variations in the system), choise of first colour etc.). It´s an illiusion to believe that all have the same chances from the beginning.

I believe you have 3 seconds to start the solve after the puzzle is
uncovered until you get penalized 2 seconds.

&quot;A4d2) The competitor must start the solve within 3 seconds. Penalty:
2 seconds.&quot;

You could easily use 0.5s to 1s to find your reference centers before
starting.  Someone please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.

Hey... there. A name is always a good thing to put in your emails.  So
you live in the Toronto area? That is great, be sure to come out to
the competition. You have nothing to lose, and lots to gain. 

I will be at the competition, but alas i will not be competing. There
will be a number of first time competitors, so don&#x27;t be worried. I
can&#x27;t say at this moment the times needed for each event.  I&#x27;d
estimate that sub 30 will get you past the first round of the 3x3,
though. 

The schedule has not yet been made, we need to wait on a couple of
items, including a better idea of the total number of competitors.
Often at one day competitions, there is only one round for most
events.  But we will see.

Keep checking the website, there should be an interesting announcement
next week.

Hope to see you there!

Absolutely anyone. We want as many cubers there as we can get.  If you
can solve a cube, come and compete.  If you are fast, you may even win
money and pay for the cost to come to Toronto. We have $2500 in cash
to be won.  Check the site.  Good times will be had.

What about the unfairness of the competitors that have to go first in
this scenario of having a set orientation?  

I actually think that using a set starting orientation for each
scramble increases the unfairness factor.  More specifically, the
&quot;unlucky&quot; cubers who go first.

For example, i know that many of the cubers use the same white cross
to start. So i if i don&#x27;t go first, i am happy. I watch someone that i
know uses the same starting face color and see they had to waste the 1
second doing a y2 x&#x27;.  And then when i go up there, i know what i have
to do without even looking at the cube. I should be able to do it in
one motion as i pick up the cube, almost eliminating the delay
altogether. 

Whereas if it is just a total random orientation, we all have an equal
chance of getting it in a good position, and an equal chance of having
it in a bad position.

How can someone win that cash?  Is it possible you may get more cash?  It is called the 
Canadian Open, so it is open to anyone, as Dave said, but this is the first non-world 
championship that has taken place in Canada.  It would be awesome if this happen twice a 
year, or maybe even more, just so Canadians have a good chance to compete without 
crossing the border.  Any questions about the competition just ask, someone will always 
answer them!

          <div class="email-content">I have 2 things to say: practically, youll never get a stage big enough for
having everyone competing at the same time, so THAT is something we cant
get round. 2nd thing is, theres no way (or give me one very good reason?)
to see why scrambling cubes with the same orientation is equal for everyone,
while handing them in random orientations is not. Its not coherent. If you
want to make it random, make it random all the way, or not at all. 

And Im not really getting the point of what you said: why should I bother
looking that the guy is doing y2x when I know Ill have to do y2x, for a
set table orientation? If I know theyll be giving me the cube with yellow
front and green top, I know Ill have to do x, and I can practice at home
in this fashion, picking up the cube while doing x. If its set, no one
will get lucky or unlucky, because itll be the same for every single cube
youll ever solve in competition. But if I dont know, maybe Ill be
advantaged, and maybe not, but for sure, if I get a 1:21 bld solve with an
unlucky orientation at the beginning, Ill be pretty pissed.

It all looks to me like when we first chose the stackmat as the official
timing device, the point was, we do count the time to pick up and drop the
cube, you just have to practice at home so youre used to picking it up fast
and dropping it down quickly. Here, you just have to be doing whatever xyz
you need very quickly, during the motion to lift the cube.

But really my main point here is the coherence between scrambling and
starting orientations. Whatever is chosen has to be coherent, and I dont
feel it is very logical as it is now.

Well that sounds great! So far i&#x27;ve gotten 13 friends to start cubing
at my school with the help of 3 other friends, i know that theres 3 of
us lookin to go for sure now, but in 2 months im sure we can get the
others faster, so hopefully we can get some more competitors.

Russ! Nice to &#x27;meet&#x27; you. That is awesome, i had no idea we had so
many cubers in this area. Definitely try and talk them into coming,
too.  Just make sure you guys register, so we know how many people to
expect.   I hope to see you there so i can meet you in person.  If you
need anything else, you can contact us through the site.

Craig, i am not sure i understand your question.  But, you can win
cash by placing 1st, 2nd or 3rd in any of the Second Tier events.  If
you win more than one event, you will win more cash. 

We are going to approach companies to see if any want to give cash or
prizes in exchange for some sort of advertisement at the competition.
So it is entirely possible that the current pot size of $2500 CDN will
increase. If you know of any companies that may be interested, let me
know.  The media will be informed of the competition, as well, to
increase the exposure of any advertisements. 

And if this one goes over well, and i believe it will, the plan will
be to have this annually. The Science Centre is becoming quite interested.

   I can see pros and cons to all of this.  However, allowing more attempts  in the final is a good thing in my mind, and I don&#x27;t think it would be necessary  to have the same amount of attempts throughout the entire competition.  The  final, in my mind, would be the most logical place to have more attempts.
  
 In regards to the sponsors/media, have they complained about time constraints?  I understand they don&#x27;t want to spend forever, but I mean, how long is forever. The final can&#x27;t be deadfully long, as least from my view.

About the flaws regarding this idea, can you mention them so I can try to proprose solutions?

Thanks

&gt; But really my main point here is the coherence between scrambling and<br>

<br>
I agree, 100%.<br>
<br>
The argument against it, which has already been stated, is that it might<br>
not be manageable, although I&#x27;m not convinced of that yet.<br>
<br>
I view the cube orientation as part of the scramble, and ideally it<br>
would be included in the scramble sequence. If there is a really good<br>
bunch of pieces to start with, and the judge hands you the cube with all<br>
of those pieces right before your eyes, on the near side of the cube,<br>
but hands the cube to a second competitor with that bunch of pieces on<br>
the far/underside of the cube, then it is possible that the second<br>
competitor will not, in the limited inspection time available, get<br>
around to looking at that particular bunch of pieces, and start with an<br>
inferior opening. I think it is like running the 100m race, and placing<br>
each of the runners at the start line, but at different orientations,<br>
with some initially pointed in the right direction, and some pointed in<br>
the wrong direction.<br>
<br>
By including the cube orientation in the scramble, we also prevent the<br>
same colours from always appearing on top, and the cube becomes<br>
completely randomised. This is essentially what I do here:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed/<br>
<br>
A randomised orientation is built into the scrambling algorithm since it<br>
uses double-layer turns as well as single-layer turns. Each competitor<br>
may choose their own colour scheme, but the scrambles and orientations<br>
will be identical relative to that colour scheme. I think it is the most<br>
fair way, but it is a matter of figuring out a &quot;manageable&quot; way to do it<br>
in real competitions.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Putting down the cube in a certain color configuration gives an  <br>
&gt; unfair advantage to people who always start with the same colors over  <br>
&gt; us color neutral solvers.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The only fair way is the random way.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t agree.<br>
<br>
Suppose there are two possible ways of choosing the orientation of the<br>
cube (constant, random) and two types of solvers (fixed-color,<br>
color-neutral). For a color-neutral solver, neither orientation<br>
changes the solver&#x27;s time, because ths solver doesn&#x27;t have to spend<br>
any time finding the starting color. For a fixed-color solver, the<br>
constant orientation does not change the solver&#x27;s time, since the<br>
solver spends no extra time finding the starting color, but the random<br>
orientation increases the solver&#x27;s time, since the solver spends extra<br>
time (however short it may be) finding the starting color.<br>
<br>
My conclusion is that using a constant orientation gives neither type<br>
of solver an advantage or a disadvantage (since both solvers spend<br>
zero time looking for their starting color), but using a random<br>
orientation gives the fixed-color solver a disadvantage against the<br>
color-neutral solver (since the fixed-color solver has to spend extra<br>
time looking for their starting color whereas the color-neutral solver<br>
does not).<br>
<br>
So I think that the only fair thing to do would be a constant<br>
orientation, and that a random orientation would have a bias towards<br>
the color-neutral solver.<br>

I agree with Ron. Not manageable.

But since you&#x27;re talking about fairness and scrambling, let me add a
few points to the list.

If fairness means that all competitors solve the same configuration
under the same conditions, it means:
1) All puzzles should follow an officially defined color scheme.
2) Keep all competitors waiting to solve a same scramble away from the
competition area and live video feed.
3) Use a scramble technique that defines centers position too (and put
the puzzle on the table this way).
4) Make sure the puzzles are correctly scrambled. We often have to ask
unexperienced volunteers to scramble puzzles, especially before final
rounds. Everybody knows mistakes do happen (otherwise, you&#x27;re a
dreamer, or hypocritical). Should we change the WCA regulations and
ask for the judge to check for the scrambled puzzle, telling the
scrambler to solve/rescramble when there&#x27;s a mistake?
5) More points we talked about, I can&#x27;t remember. :-)

with white on top and green on front. That&#x27;s fine to me, because this
way everyone gets the same cube. But then the judges who takes the
cube to the competitor can somehow move it around so for example for
some competitors they&#x27;ll still be having white on top and green on
front, but actually, since no one is paying attention to that, some won&#x27;t.

in bld events where inspection is counted within the solving time,

won&#x27;t (that&#x27;s maybe 0.5 to 1s , but that&#x27;s still not really fair).

I don&#x27;t agree.

*YOU* need a constant orientation of centers because it is an unfair
advantage for YOUR method (otherwise, YOU loose time looking for YOUR
centers and restoring their position).

Well, *I* don&#x27;t care about the centers, because with MY method, I need
the green/orange/purple corner located at DBL. I need MY corner there
to get the same kind of unfair advantages.

A perfectly color neutral solver, thanks to his superior skills, do
not need that kind of unfair advantages.

Gilles.


PS: It reminds me the last cube marathon when we insisted on having
random orientation.

  Russ! Nice to &#x27;meet&#x27; you. That is awesome, i had no idea we had so
  many cubers in this area. Definitely try and talk them into coming,
  too. Just make sure you guys register, so we know how many people to

since i dont have one and i didnt go for BLindfolded because im still
rusty doing it so enhh. And congratz on your sub-30! im sure theres
more to come very soon :p. Hope to see everyone there on teh day of
the competition!

that&#x27;s what I said on my early post...if you can stablish that the cube will be scrambled with, say, green on front and white on top, why is it so bloody hard to make the judge put it down that way? o.O

François Sechet &lt;frsechet@...> escreveu:                                  I have 2 things to say: practically, youll never get a stage big enough for
 having everyone competing at the same time, so THAT is something we cant
 get round. 2nd thing is, theres no way (or give me one very good reason?)
 to see why scrambling cubes with the same orientation is equal for everyone,
 while handing them in random orientations is not. Its not coherent. If you
 want to make it random, make it random all the way, or not at all. 
 
 And Im not really getting the point of what you said: why should I bother
 looking that the guy is doing y2x when I know Ill have to do y2x, for a
 set table orientation? If I know theyll be giving me the cube with yellow
 front and green top, I know Ill have to do x, and I can practice at home
 in this fashion, picking up the cube while doing x. If its set, no one
 will get lucky or unlucky, because itll be the same for every single cube
 youll ever solve in competition. But if I dont know, maybe Ill be
 advantaged, and maybe not, but for sure, if I get a 1:21 bld solve with an
 unlucky orientation at the beginning, Ill be pretty pissed.
 
 It all looks to me like when we first chose the stackmat as the official
 timing device, the point was, we do count the time to pick up and drop the
 cube, you just have to practice at home so youre used to picking it up fast
 and dropping it down quickly. Here, you just have to be doing whatever xyz
 you need very quickly, during the motion to lift the cube.
 
 But really my main point here is the coherence between scrambling and
 starting orientations. Whatever is chosen has to be coherent, and I dont
 feel it is very logical as it is now.

 What about the unfairness of the competitors that have to go first in
 this scenario of having a set orientation? 
 
 I actually think that using a set starting orientation for each
 scramble increases the unfairness factor. More specifically, the
 &quot;unlucky&quot; cubers who go first.
 
 For example, i know that many of the cubers use the same white cross
 to start. So i if i don&#x27;t go first, i am happy. I watch someone that i
 know uses the same starting face color and see they had to waste the 1
 second doing a y2 x&#x27;. And then when i go up there, i know what i have
 to do without even looking at the cube. I should be able to do it in
 one motion as i pick up the cube, almost eliminating the delay
 altogether. 
 
 Whereas if it is just a total random orientation, we all have an equal
 chance of getting it in a good position, and an equal chance of having
 it in a bad position.

<br>
I do like the idea of having an orientation for each scramble. However, it is extra work for judges. Yes, I know it doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but competitions are hectic enough as it is. Suppose a scrambler forgets to orient a cube correctly and a judge brings it up and sets it down without checking it. The competitor later talks to other people and comes back complaining that their cube was not oriented correctly. It would be a nightmare for us as judges. Of course, ideally the judge would always check the orientation, but there&#x27;s really no simple way to do this, without more or less removing the cube from the cover and replacing it, all while trying to conceal it from the competitor.<br>

The time it takes for the stickers to be delivered to you depends on
where you live. I live in Australia and the stickers come in about 2
weeks. I think that he will post when he gets the machine fixed or
buys a new machine.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
Wow, we are debating this (I think) minor issue as if it were a major <br>
problem of mankind.<br>
<br>
François, I agree with you that it would be perfect if we could make <br>
the circumstances 100% the same for all competitors.<br>
So it would better if all competitors have the same scramble and the <br>
same orientation, than the same scramble and a random orientation.<br>
<br>
IMHO there are currently too many things that can go wrong to <br>
guarantee the same orientation for blindfolded solving.<br>
Some examples:<br>
- scrambler puts down the puzzle in a different way under the cover<br>
- when &quot;organising&quot; the scrambled puzzles on the table, someone <br>
accidentally rotates a puzzle or cover<br>
- when picking up the puzzle, the judge rotates the puzzle (he is <br>
often seeing the covers/puzzles from a different angle)<br>
- when transporting the puzzle, the puzzle is rotated under the cover<br>
- when putting down the puzzle, the puzzle is rotated under the cover <br>
or with the cover<br>
<br>
The biggest improvement I think we could make is to have a puzzle <br>
cover that:<br>
- perfectly fits the 3x3 cube (so no rotation is possible under the <br>
cover)<br>
- has colors on the outside that show how to place the puzzle under <br>
the cover, and how to position the puzzle on the Stackmat<br>
Then we leave 5% chance of failure, in case of ignorance or mistake <br>
by scrambler/judge or if there are too few covers for the <br>
competition. Chance of failure increases if a competitor uses a <br>
different color scheme.<br>
<br>
If someone can make this cover for a cheap price then I can guarantee <br>
that we will use it and change the regulations.<br>
If not, then let us forget about it and just for this one time <br>
believe me that it is not manageable.<br>
<br>
On a side note: would it not be the fairest if there would be only <br>
one cube that we were allowed to use in a competition, and that we <br>
would need to solve the same scramble all the time, with a standard <br>
orientation? And all competitors must use the same system, and start <br>
with the same color. That would be perfect! (Although very boring...)<br>
In Belgian Open 2007 I think I had 8 parities in 4x4. One other <br>
competitor told me he had 0 parities. Now that is unfair! :-)<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron!

Are you saying that 4x4x4 cube orientation affects the likeliness of 
getting parities? Or are you just joking? ;-) Unless you really can 
see how to avoid parities early, whether you have parities on 4x4x4 
is just luck/random. One could argue that after centers/pairing edges 
one should be able to tell which of the parities exist and solve both 
parities with same algorithm if both parities are present ;-)

I would hope that if the machine was still out that he would send me
email right away explaining that. I did pay for the order already. How
would I know that he doesn&#x27;t have the ability to create the stickers.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I can wait 2 weeks, I just would like some
feedback on what is going on. If you have a business, you should keep
your customers informed. Sending an email takes no time at all, or
maybe an automated email telling you that they got the order and blah
blah blah. Maybe he will see this post and reply on this forum.

Thanks,
Alfredo

          <div class="email-content">I agree with François as well.<br>
<br>
In general, I think we need to better brief the judges on these <br>
orientation issues. In US06, I got really pissed off and vented to <br>
Zamora that judges kept pulling the cube away from me (like by 8 <br>
inches!) and &quot;fixing&quot; the orientation so it&#x27;s squared up to the mat. <br>
I DON&#x27;T WANT THAT! He agreed and warned the judges, but thoughout <br>
the competition it was a dismal thing to keep control over. In <br>
actuality, it&#x27;s not that hard to explain to even a non-cuber to not <br>
do that sort of thing. I&#x27;m sure I wasn&#x27;t the only one annoyed by <br>
that and I&#x27;m sure it happens in other competitions, especially the <br>
ones where instead of a simple sheet of paper, the &quot;official cover <br>
box thingy&quot; is used. Speaking of which..., I always hated how some <br>
of them are &quot;stickered,&quot; it&#x27;s a tiny bit confusing for some people I <br>
would imagine.<br>
<br>
Specifically for BLD events, I believe having a set orientation is <br>
critical to *fairness*. Someone talked abut the 3s we get to figure <br>
out the orientation, before a 2s penalty. Well I&#x27;d rather spend <br>
those 3s examining other things to get as much of an &quot;edge&quot; as I <br>
can, as I would assume the &quot;correct-orientation-recieving cubers&quot; <br>
get to have. I would even take it a step further, and stipulate in <br>
the rules for BLD that you are allowed to request a specific <br>
orientation given to you.<br>
<br>
For the speed events, we do get to set it down in the orientation we <br>
want at the end of preinspection so it&#x27;s much less of an issue, but <br>
those pesky judges... and their 5 minutes of &quot;training&quot;. I&#x27;d much <br>
rather have a fellow cuber do this for me, since they understand <br>
better. At the same time, there is of course the possiblity of what <br>
François (or was it Ryan?) mentioned, about how it&#x27;s possible for a <br>
competitor to purposely hinder you when in judging capacity. My <br>
solution. Have judges to judge the judges, and judges to judge them, <br>
lol. (j/k)<br>
