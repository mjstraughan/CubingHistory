Somewhat. Actually second, but I forgot to click the &#x27;start recording&#x27; 
button. And I did tutorial->fast->slow cause I hadn&#x27;t thought about it 
beforehand. But yeah, I&#x27;m happy to get a fluent fast solve right away. 
I really didn&#x27;t want to waste time with many attempts until one good 
one comes along...

Cheers!
Stefan

I dusted off my java skills and have been pounding away at the<br>
problems.  Now that I&#x27;m back into the groove of programming in java,<br>
they are falling much more quickly.<br>
<br>
Problem 12 is giving me serious fits though.  I can&#x27;t seem to find a<br>
quick way to find the number of divisors of a VERY large number...if<br>
you guys have any tips ;)<br>

Ha, after solving that one they already tell me &quot;Your current rating 
is 1% genius.&quot;!!!

What is a &quot;very large number&quot; for you?

&gt;<br>
<br>
Well I just naturally assumed that any number with over 500 divisors<br>
must be pretty dang big... is this an incorrect assumption?<br>
<br>
I have tested all triangle numbers up to 13999986 so far (the 5291st<br>
triangle number) with the highest number of factors up to this point<br>
being 320.  The testing has become quite slow at this point.<br>

What am I missing?<br>

well i use an algorithm to swap the edges that are &quot;in

I&#x27;m planning on having all my stickers available before the 
tournament, as well as tshirts and 2x2 magics.  You don&#x27;t need to 
pre order as that will be too much to keep track of.  I&#x27;ll be there 
2 days early so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be easy to find.

Anyway, I think Sachin already answered your question and Chris, who
hosts the timer on strangepuzzle already created a clock category.

More features to come. I&#x27;m currently in a timer-development hiatus but
I&#x27;ll get back to it as soon as things at work (the real one) cool down
for a bit.

Cheers,
Marco

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

The notation (1;0) can be translated into (30°, 0°)
The first number is for the upper layer, the second is for the bottom layer.

So, for example : (6, 4) = (180° (=U2) ; 120° )

Between two sequences, you have to turn the right part of the cube
(usually writed / ).
It&#x27;s important that usually, thse scrambling/solving sequences are
usable only if the &quot;seperation line of the midle layer&quot; is on the
left. I hope this is intelligible, because it&#x27;s very important.

Good luck ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I had to laugh about your comment on the size of the trophies you got. 
That reminds me a lot of when I came back from Amsterdam after the 
European Championships. The trophy I got back then was huge. We didn&#x27;t 
have a bag or case that was big enough and we had to walk a fair 
distance with our lugage to get to the station and change trains 4 
times so I couldn&#x27;t just hold it in my hands all the time. In the end I 
managed to stuff it in one of our bags but it was still hanging out.

It was also quite a heavy trophy. If you look closely at some of the EC 
pictures, you&#x27;ll notice (from my facial expressions) that I was having 
big difficulties keeping it up in the air while people were taking 
photographs. Those are the things you have to take into your stride 
when you&#x27;re the champion ;)

Yeah, that one&#x27;s really easy. You don&#x27;t have to think at all, just 
submit a few hundred attempts. Nah, that&#x27;s not how I solved it of 
course. It&#x27;s indeed easy, the math is trivial, only the programming 
part is annoying. Now I&#x27;m 2% genius...

          <div class="email-content">thanks for your response, gilles.  i understand the
1&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s, is a 2 basically moving from one side of
a corner to another? and what is a 5. i&#x27;m holding it
with the square one text on the left side. so would
-2,0 be moveing the other side of the corner the flip
line?  are there any applets that demonstrate these
moves?  the specific one i&#x27;m looking at fixes a z type
permutation in the top layer and the notation is:

 	/(3,3)/(0,3)/(1,1)/(-1,-4)/(-3,-3)/

so does this one make it not square then shift it back
or what?

and then this one that swaps fu and fd edges

 
(0,-3)/(0,3)/(1,0)/(2,-2)/(4,0)/(4,0)/(-4,4)/(0,1)/(0,3)/(-3,-1)/(1,-2)/(-1,0)

i don&#x27;t get the 2&#x27;s in this one.  if anyone could make
a slow video of these 2 algs, i would be eternally
greatful. i like this puzzle, but it might not make it
through the day if i don&#x27;t get this notation down. :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
Just a general ramble.<br>
I just came back from a week on holiday in Greece where I set myself the <br>
target of trying blindfold solving again after a break of about 22 years!  I <br>
had a look at Bill McGaugh&#x27;s site before I went <br>
(http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/) and then sat down on the 3 1/2 hour <br>
flight to think my way through it - trying out little bits of the method. <br>
On the subsequent days I had spare time here and there while wife and kids <br>
were doing other things and altogether I&#x27;ve attempted about 10 solves with <br>
about 50% success.  When its wrong its usually a 3-cycle or so because I <br>
just can&#x27;t quite always remember the right edge permutations.<br>
I now see how the blindfold times are so fast - which isn&#x27;t to say I don&#x27;t <br>
think they are very impressive!  I was there at the first blindfold world <br>
record of about 20 minutes in 1982 (I think!) and I remember the effort that <br>
John White the solver had to put into it.  The new methods make it almost <br>
easy (almost but not quite!).  My times are generally around ten minutes <br>
with this method and could clearly be faster with practice and confidence.<br>
Anyway fantastic method and well thought out.<br>
<br>
Anyone got any way to improve my ageing memory of edge permutations I&#x27;d be <br>
glad to take their advice!<br>
<br>
Good luck to all blindfold solvers at the WC.<br>

Anyone who has studied computer science should be able to solve quite
a few of the ones with high points. Problem 107 is at 19 points but is
a standard problem with algorithms that are not to hard to implement.

          <div class="email-content">Hey, folks!<br>
I came up with something similar to this question a while ago, but I <br>
have another doubt...<br>
<br>
I was wondering about the PLL probabilities. One way I&#x27;ve found to <br>
know it was:<br>
<br>
check the number of probabilities for each case and make the % of the <br>
total. So, for example, the U perm have 8 possible cases:<br>
-each of the 4 colors can be the correct side and we have clockwise <br>
and counter-clockwise direction, so 4x2=8<br>
<br>
for the A is the same thing...and etc<br>
<br>
I got 73 cases in total, but I think something is wrong, cause my % <br>
do not match with the probabilities on Fridrich&#x27;s site...<br>
<br>
here&#x27;s what I got:<br>
<br>
                 %<br>
    U - 8       10.96<br>
    A - 8       10.96<br>
    Z - 2        2.74<br>
    H - 1        1.37<br>
    E - 2        2.74<br>
    T - 4        5.48<br>
    V - 4        5.48<br>
    F - 4        5.48<br>
    R - 8       10.96<br>
    J - 8       10.96<br>
    Y - 4        5.48<br>
    G - 16      21.92<br>
    N - 4        5.48<br>
<br>
Total - 73      100.00<br>

So, where I&#x27;m wrong? Anyone knows?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Duncan,<br>
<br>
Thanks for studying my method, and congratulations for succeeding with it<br>
<br>
As far as edge permutations, as I described on the web page, I identify the edges<br>
as letters and make a sentence or two, using the edge letters as the first letters of words.<br>
I also sometimes put 3 letters together into a word.  Other people just memorize everything<br>
as numbers. I think the more advanced solvers just remember the path with pure spatial visualization.<br>
I think it depends on your particular mental strengths.  Sometimes I do 6 or 7 edges with a sentence...and<br>
then just visualize the rest.<br>
<br>
As with everything, its all about practice.  I find remembering the edge perms many times easier than I did a few<br>
months ago. I have a few common themes that I use to construct sentences..a library of possible words...<br>
and the construction of a meaningful sentence is quick and easy...and I am 56 years old.<br>
<br>
I may write up the more advanced (3-cycle) extension of my method soon...world class times should be<br>
very possible with the advanced method (for people who can perform all the algs as fast fingertricks). I think, in  <br>
the near future, I will be able to average 1-2 minutes for memorization and 2-4 for execution with the improved method...and I have very slow hand technique.<br>

Still haven&#x27;t gotten stoopid number 12 though.  But I did make a
slightly more efficient brute force alg.  I&#x27;ve tested the first 10400
triangle numbers with the highest that I remember so far being 480
factors.

Grrr, I know it should be easier than I&#x27;m making it!

And I definately agree, Kåre.  The problems don&#x27;t seem to be hard in
and of themselves, I just royally suck at programming!  And congrats
on an amazing 53 solved so far!

If you use two cycles for permuting the edges, why not solve 
orientation and permutation of edges at the very same time? :)

But I agree, bld solving is pretty cool.. I hope to practice it in 
the airplane a bit tomorrow...

          <div class="email-content">Got it with my slightly more efficient algorithm.  The fact that I was
running it on my ti-89 during class probably didn&#x27;t help the speed,
but it got from the 10400th triangle number to the answer in about 10
minutes.

I&#x27;ll have to port it to java to see how fast it does it there.

Instead of checking all numbers between 1 and n/2 to see how many
divisors n has, I now do this:

if n = P1^n1 * P2^n2 * ... * Pr^nr  with Pi prime and for  all
i=1,...,r , and ni integers.  Then the number of divisors =
(n1+1)*(n2+1)*...*(nr+1)

Worked quite a bit better :)

also, you probably can solve multiple edges at the same time (or at
least parts of multiple egdes at the same time) like on the 4x4x4

Fantastic method?

If you use two cycles for permuting the edges, why not solve 
orientation and permutation of edges at the very same time? :)

But I agree, bld solving is pretty cool.. I hope to practice it in 
the airplane a bit tomorrow...

First my congratulations to Joel! I was there in Eindhoven too.  I 
was working for 999-games, but in my short break i noticed the rubic-
cube stand. I&#x27;m very ashamed I didn&#x27;t know of the Dutch Championships 
before, but I liked to participated. My first time was a new pesonal 
record, 1 minute, 45 seconds. At the two next times i made a mistake 
at the beginning, that was very afwul

but anyway, was the first time for me to compete with cubing! And I 
liked it! Oh, and the first time I saw Joel, while he is living 10 
minutes walking from here... 

Oh, and there was said that I was the 3rd best of the females! Is 
that a good thing? :S

Well, good luck to you all who are going to do the World 
Championships, and Joel, I will visit you sometime :)

greets
Rinie

PS. I&#x27;m sorry for my worse english, that&#x27;s also the reason I don;t 
visit this site often... But now a got the hang of it, I will look 
more in the future!

It was pretty funny to meet you all of the sudden :)... Too bad we 
didn&#x27;t have time to talk...

3rd best of 5 woman? Ok, I&#x27;ll shut up.

If you visit me sometime, that would be nice.. I could teach you to 
be the fastest woman ;) (if you like). That wouldnt be so hard, I 
think.

Going to the airport now,

CU all,

          <div class="email-content">OK so this is what we were doing 20 odd years ago:
We wouldn&#x27;t memorize the state of the cube - but the moves required to put 
each piece back in place.  If a move chosen moved other pieces around we 
would have to remember where they moved to and build that into the 
calculations. That is much, much harder than memorizing the orientation and 
permutation of edges and corners and then having a couple of standard 
algorithms.  I think 20 minutes blindfold using that approach is probably a 
very good time!  So when I say fantastic method I mean in comparison.  Its 
the structure of the method that I like and I agree that with practice doing 
3-cycles, orienting and permuting at the same time and other tricks will 
definitely be within my scope.  At the moment it feels like a lot to hold in 
my head at one time!

Thanks Bill and Matt for tips on edge memorizing.  I tried using the &quot;Major&quot; 
memorization method while I was on holiday for the edge cycles - so far as I 
know this is one of the techniques top memory guys use for number 
memorization but in principle very similar to what you are suggesting.  I 
need more practice!

For edge orientation I remember 3 binary numbers.
For corner orientation I create a sentence based on a (anticlockwise), b 
(blank i.e. no twist required) and c (clockwise) e.g.All Children Buy 
Cherries And Chew Constantly Choking.
For corner permutation I usually have no problem remembering spatially.  But 
I usually memorise the numbers as a double check which is one way having 
extra confidence will considerably reduce my times.
I&#x27;ve tried a few things for edges - the Major method, spatial memory, 
strings of numbers.  I get it right about half the time but I&#x27;m hopefully 
still at a point on the learning curve where it will improve quickly.

Thanks for you comments.

Duncan

Fantastic method?

If you use two cycles for permuting the edges, why not solve
orientation and permutation of edges at the very same time? :)

But I agree, bld solving is pretty cool.. I hope to practice it in
the airplane a bit tomorrow...

Yes, that&#x27;s correct, but keep in mind that they get numbers as input! 
They don&#x27;t memorize them as numbers, instead they translate them to 
mental images using the major method. It&#x27;s because numbers are too 
abstract.

I guess I&#x27;ll never really understand why any blindcuber would want to 
translate a cubie to a number, then the number to a mental image, 
instead of simply translating the cubie to a mental image directly, 
which looks safer and faster to me.

Hi Ron,

I can easily see Ton showing off his 1978 cube since cubes from that
year are very rare. 

Ton&#x27;s cube rates highly among other cubes because 1978 was the first
year of manufacture. Most of those other cubes of his were made after
the name &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; was coined.

Let me tell you about my 1978 cube. In 1978 Bela Szalai, the owner of
Logical Games Inc, discovered the cube while visiting Hungary. One of
the cubes that he took home with him (to the USA) he sent to a
professional game analyst, Sid Sackson, to check it over and estimate
whether it would be successful. I now have this cube.

After the cube got the OK, Mr. Szalai got more cubes from Hungary and
began selling them, and later he began making them. The cubes he made
were marketed first in 1979. It wasn&#x27;t until the next year, 1980, that
Ideal began making them and named them &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube.&quot; Before that
they were called &quot;Magic Cube&quot; and &quot;Charm Cube.&quot;

Anyway, my 1978 cube was one of the first cubes in the USA. Because of
the stickers and the paperwork, you can tell that it&#x27;s from an earlier
batch than Ton&#x27;s 1978. As you might expect it&#x27;s #1 in my collection.

I enjoyed the videos. Thanks for posting them. And of course,
congratulations all around!

Have fun in Orlando!

Hi David,

could you show us a picture of your cube and that &quot;paperwork&quot;? As I 
wrote in my earlier reply, I totally agree with Ton as well, I like 
these old cubes a lot, too.

Combining this statement with your other post (#22052 where you say 
you solve the 4x4 as centers->edges->3x3) makes me think you should 
seriously consider getting a lottery ticket right now!

Out of curiousity, what &quot;method&quot; do you use? I&#x27;m sure part of your 
times is due to your fast times in 3x, but any special &quot;speed&quot; aspects 
to your method (if you want to share)?

Since you are the current world record holder and one of the top 
blindfolders, I&#x27;m sure many would be interested in your approach.

Thanks!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jeff,

I think my method for solving the 3x3x3 cube is exactly the same as 
most people out there.  Uh, just 3-cycles.  I orient the corners, 
orient the edges, permute the corners, permute the edges.  I use the 
same method as Macky and Leyan.  I don&#x27;t really do anything advanced 
like Dave Orser or anything special.  I have a very limited set of 
algorithms.

My fast times are due to my memorization time which I can sometimes do 
under 40 seconds and also the smoothness of executing the algorithms.  
If the memorization is solid, then I don&#x27;t ever have to sit and &quot;think&quot; 
about what the next set of moves are.

Sorry, that was not my intention. I just knew there must be something 
wrong but I didn&#x27;t know what, and my post was my way to say so. What 
is it that you figured out now?

The way you solve 4x4 is not unusual, btw, it&#x27;s how most of us do it. 
And we all end up with the orientation parity half of the time, that&#x27;s 
why it seemed strange you don&#x27;t.

Cheers!

Hey John,

For me this alg is by far the fastest super5x5 parity fix.  Look at
the &quot;+&quot; edges in relation to the centralmost centerpiece.  If those
edges are in an odd permutation you have parity.  So you can solve
parity before you even think about starting to solve edges.

The algs is (R&#x27;r&#x27; U2)x4 R&#x27;r&#x27;

It messes up edges a bit and it switches centers as (blU &lt;-> frU) (flU
&lt;-> brU) (lsU &lt;-> rsU)

Plus it is very fast to execute.

Hope that helps.

Chris

thanks.  I do end up with some orientation parities at the end of
solving a 4x4 but in trying to see what other people did to solve
them, i was never quite able to find a solution to my corner error.  I
 do almost always have to execute a dedge flip (gotten off of your
website stefan because my algorithm was ridiculously long) Only that
corner error seemed to be the one thing that no one else returned. 
that&#x27;s why i figured i must be doing something different.

So you have that the commutator [U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U R U&#x27;,Ll&#x27;] is the identity.

Hi Jeff,

I think my method for solving the 3x3x3 cube is exactly the same as 
most people out there.  Uh, just 3-cycles.  I orient the corners, 
orient the edges, permute the corners, permute the edges.  I use the 
same method as Macky and Leyan.  I don&#x27;t really do anything advanced 
like Dave Orser or anything special.  I have a very limited set of 
algorithms.

My fast times are due to my memorization time which I can sometimes do 
under 40 seconds and also the smoothness of executing the algorithms.  
If the memorization is solid, then I don&#x27;t ever have to sit and &quot;think&quot; 
about what the next set of moves are.

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Rob Butler&quot; &lt;futuese@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Tue, 01 Nov 2005 22:25:10 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content"><br>
<br>
<br>
Columnar F(n-1)L for really big cubes.<br>
<br>
For anyone who might have any interest, here is a brief description <br>
of the technique I used to solve the 20x20x20 Gabbasoft Supercube.  <br>
I have uploaded a series of representative screenshots to the photos <br>
section so you can also see how the solution comes together (folder <br>
name: &quot;20x20 Supercube&quot;).  The technique can be applied to both <br>
regular cubes and supercubes and can be used on even or odd cubes of <br>
any size.  I include in [brackets] the readings of the move counter <br>
and clock at the end of each stage.  To spare you the suspense the <br>
whole solve required just over 9,500 moves and took just under 12 <br>
hours.  N.B.: for this solve I kept White on BOTTOM and Yellow on <br>
UP, thus Red, Blue, Green, and Orange are sometimes referred to <br>
as &#x27;middle&#x27; faces.<br>
<br>
Step 1: solve white centers on bottom (black arrows)<br>
   [move counter: 1255,   timer: 50min, 27 sec]<br>
Step 2: set up white corners together with middle edges <br>
(orange/blue, red/blue, orange/green, red/green)  <br>
   [move counter: 1476,   timer: 1hr, 15 min, 16 sec]<br>
<br>
Step 3: solve an entire column of centers along with the white edge <br>
piece.  With just a little practice and forethought this can be done <br>
intuitively.  Repeat this step as often as necessary until three of <br>
the four middle sides are complete.  To make piece recognition a <br>
little easier for a cube as large as the 20x20x20 I started with the <br>
outermost columns and worked my way towards the middle.  For the <br>
20x20x20 supercube solve this step was repeated 54 times until the <br>
red, blue, and green faces were all complete.<br>
   [move counter: 5812,   timer: 7 hrs, 27 min, 48 sec]<br>
Step 4a: solve half the columns of the remaining F19L middle face <br>
(orange) intuitively.<br>
   [move counter: 6413,   timer: 8 hrs, 12 min, 55 sec]<br>
Step 4b: solve as many of the remaining (orange) centers intuitively <br>
as possible and then solve the remaining centers using three-cycles.<br>
  [move counter: 7248,   timer: 9 hrs, 11 min, 33 sec]<br>
<br>
F19L Complete - move to LL (yellow)<br>
<br>
Step 5: solve LAST LAYER CORNERS.  (N.B.: on the 5x5x5 cube it is <br>
usually advisable to simply use OLL and PLL moves to solve both the <br>
corners and the middle edge of the last layer  thus one only has <br>
the remaining 8 edges left to three-cycle.  On the 20x20x20 this <br>
tactic will not work so simply solve the corners as you will using <br>
either COLL or OC, PC).<br>
  [move counter: 7294,   timer: 9 hrs, 15 min, 33 sec]<br>
Step 6: solve the LAST LAYER EDGES using three-cycles where possible <br>
and a pair swap when necessary due to parity.  On the 20x20x20 <br>
supercube I started with the orbit adjacent to the corners and <br>
worked my way systematically towards the middle edge pairs.  (N.B.: <br>
On a standard cube this will complete the solution but on a <br>
supercube we still have one more step to perform.)<br>
  [move counter: 7857,   timer: 9 hrs, 52 min, 41 sec]<br>
Step 7: solve the LAST LAYER CENTERS using three-cycles.  Again I <br>
started with the outermost `circle&#x27; of centers and worked my way <br>
systematically towards the very center of the yellow face.<br>
  [move counter: 9519,   timer: 11 hrs, 55 min, 56 sec]<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE 1: There are many shortcuts and minor adaptations that can be <br>
applied to make a 5x5x5 solution faster but I use the steps as <br>
outlined above when solving really big cubes.<br>
NOTE 2: Steps 1-4a can all be performed intuitively, while steps 4b, <br>
6, and 7 can all be solved using very similar three-cycles.  Thus <br>
the entire cube can be solved, regardless of its size, using just a <br>
handful of algs.<br>
NOTE 3: If anyone wishes to make use of these pics please feel free, <br>
though I would appreciate being informed.  I actually have many more <br>
pics showing the solution in greater step-by-step detail  64 pics <br>
in total of which I only posted here just enough to hopefully make <br>
the solution path clear to all viewers.  Again the pics are in the <br>
photos section under the folder title &quot;20x20 Supercube&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enjoy solving really big (super) cubes,<br>

Yes. Using symmetries you can reduce corner orientation to 66 non-isomorphic 
algorithms - or less with inversions. If you use set-ups (conjugation) you can take that 
down, although you&#x27;ll have to think the conjugation up on the fly, ensure it is correct and 
probably lose time on both of those.
You can use 76 non-isomorphic algorithms (without set up moves) to solve the edge 
orientations (or, of course, 6 if you use set up moves).

I taught Dave to blindfold cube on the chat here and I sent him a lot of algorithms. I&#x27;m not 
sure what Dave uses now and I can only speculate, but he learned a lot of my intermediate 
system and he used more of it than most people - in particular, he might have learned all 
the corner orientation moves from my &quot;intermediate&quot; system which does corner orientation 
in one algorithm and also edge orientation in one algorithm.

I know that he had learned a lot of moves from the middle stages. I&#x27;d told him that I 
believed that this sort of time (well under 2 minutes) was possible with that system and he 
learned an impressive amount of it.
I sent him some specific permutation moves too, bespoke to his situation, that were in my 
advanced system but not my intermediate one but not too many of those. I guess he 
probably uses a lot of other moves too from other sources or of his own.
Alternatively, I guess he might have switched to a completely different method like a cycle 
method.

Of course, you can use one of 94,518 non-isomorphic algorithms to do both corner and 
edge orientations in one go...

Tyson&#x27;s just a freak, so don&#x27;t worry.  It usually takes me over a minute 
to memorize the cube as well, so you&#x27;re in good company.  Tyson just 
gets lots of practice by stalking girls and memorizing their phone 
numbers :-P

          <div class="email-content">Hmm...but...I was wondering...in how much time do Dave memorise? To do a 1:30 total time, he have to memorise in like 35 seconds...or does he just have a fast execution?
 
Pedro
 
PS.:I&#x27;m a slow executer. I usually memorise on 1:10 or 1:20, and execute in 2:10 or 2:20...So, I&#x27;m around 3:35-3:40 times on good solves. Is there a way to accelerate execution?

Yes. Using symmetries you can reduce corner orientation to 66 non-isomorphic 
algorithms - or less with inversions. If you use set-ups (conjugation) you can take that 
down, although you&#x27;ll have to think the conjugation up on the fly, ensure it is correct and 
probably lose time on both of those.
You can use 76 non-isomorphic algorithms (without set up moves) to solve the edge 
orientations (or, of course, 6 if you use set up moves).

I taught Dave to blindfold cube on the chat here and I sent him a lot of algorithms. I&#x27;m not 
sure what Dave uses now and I can only speculate, but he learned a lot of my intermediate 
system and he used more of it than most people - in particular, he might have learned all 
the corner orientation moves from my &quot;intermediate&quot; system which does corner orientation 
in one algorithm and also edge orientation in one algorithm.

I know that he had learned a lot of moves from the middle stages. I&#x27;d told him that I 
believed that this sort of time (well under 2 minutes) was possible with that system and he 
learned an impressive amount of it.
I sent him some specific permutation moves too, bespoke to his situation, that were in my 
advanced system but not my intermediate one but not too many of those. I guess he 
probably uses a lot of other moves too from other sources or of his own.
Alternatively, I guess he might have switched to a completely different method like a cycle 
method.

Of course, you can use one of 94,518 non-isomorphic algorithms to do both corner and 
edge orientations in one go...

I just tried searching for &quot;UuRr&quot; with the built-in yahoo group search 
function. The first search went over messages 22123 to 13632, the 
second search completed it. What do you mean 30 at a time?

But I agree the google search is still better, thanks!!

Here&#x27;s a clickable link for what Michiel showed (and using English, 
not Dutch google ;-)

          <div class="email-content">well the next step is to assemble 2 more edges and the
corner that goes in between it, if you&#x27;ve flipped your
edges right this is pretty easy to do.  once u get
your corner twisted the right way, if you put it in
the layer with nothing built in it, when its pointed
one way its the color of one edge sticking out and the
other side will bring the other color out. so you find
one of the edges that match one of the other colors
and move it so that you can put it into position, then
move the corner around to the side so its not affected
by the edge&#x27;s positioning turn, move the edge into
place, then bring the corner back.  its always really
hard to explain things via text, but if this doesn&#x27;t
help i can probably make you a video tonite when i get
home from work.  then its putting the last corner edge
pair together and putting it in place which just takes
some practice.  then the last layer has 3 steps,
position corners, orient corners, permute edges.  each
of these last layer steps can be accomplished with 1
algorithm for each, niklas, sune, and allan
respectively.

Hi Stefan,

I don&#x27;t have a photo of the cube, or a scan of the paperwork, yet. 

I&#x27;ll give you two small quotes from the paperwork. 

&quot;The unit pieces are actually hollow with a cover plate which can come
loose and impede turning.&quot;

&quot;.... With new cubes, anticlockwise turning may cause this [the centre
of the face] to unscrew. If so, peel off the colour from the
face-centre piece and you will find a tightly fitting cover plate.
Pressing the screw up into the piece will push off the plate...&quot;

 Cheers,

David J

The color scheme is Red opposite Orange, Yellow opposite White, Blue
opposite Green - with Blue Yellow Orange clockwise, so it&#x27;s BYO not
the BOY arrangement. The Red is lighter, the Yellow is more Gold, and
the Orange is brighter than nowadays.

Hi David,

thanks for the info. If you can some day take pictures of the cube and 
papers it&#x27;d still be great.

But that quote of pushing off the plate is a completely mean joke. 
This kind of center/centercap is by far the worst I&#x27;ve seen:

http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/old_center.jpg

The cap fits into a hole and it touches its sides and bottom. And what 
a surprise, it&#x27;s glued rock hard. No way to get it out nicely. I have 
another cube which has the same pieces except the edges and corners 
don&#x27;t have caps. The way I opened the centers was to cut through the 
cap with a dremel clone, taking out a square piece of it and replacing 
it with a new piece of polystyrol sheet. That was a lot of hard 
annoying work and it&#x27;s not perfect but good enough...

Cheers!
Stefan

Funny... just two weeks ago Edwin contacted me about clock records :-)

If I remember correctly, he said it was in a TV show.

Uh... forgot to say that for this you need to tell me soon after the

German time, will check mails again before I go.

Started some new auctions today, btw.

Hi Stefan,

I don&#x27;t think the first ones were glued. I believe that first year or
so saw a lot of experimentation. Many things were tried, some
discarded, some kept. I know the stickers went though changes.

I think there was an earlier run than the batch my 1978 cube is from. 

Cheers,

David J

Hey all,

Can&#x27;t seem to get it to work.
The java console shows me the following error:

Don&#x27;t know enough about Java to decifer the error. Any help would be 
appreciated.

Hehe, well... I don&#x27;t think any of them are boring on their own, but I 
have many puzzles so I just don&#x27;t have the time to play with all of 
them even though I do spend nearly all my time with cubing. So you 
could say some are less interesting for me than others. But at some 
point I was interested in each of them, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have 
bought them. And I have solved all puzzles I&#x27;m selling, I wouldn&#x27;t 
want to give one away that I can&#x27;t solve yet.

Also, I noticed I&#x27;m more of a solver than a collector, so I don&#x27;t have 
to keep all puzzles I have. Except puzzles from childhood, I won&#x27;t 
give those away because of the emotional connection and some memories.

Other reasons are that I have many duplicates and I really don&#x27;t need 
all of them, and that my room is filled with puzzles which is somewhat 
a burden and I want to get some free space again, and last but not 
least it&#x27;ll help getting a positive bank account balance again.

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes I did! I bought a digital scale the Monday afterwards (cause I 
need it for weighing postal packages anyway). And they differed by 
about 3 grams, about 132.5 versus 135.5 grams. But... the other way 
around, not like Mr T. thought :-). I remember I thought if they 
differ at all I&#x27;d expect it the other one to be heavier cause it&#x27;s 
filled with more silicone, otherwise they should be pretty much 
identical.

Cheers!
Stefan

Thought I&#x27;d start a thread on any media coverage for WC2005.<br>
<br>
One from Sacramento, CA: Channel 58 had a short video item, mostly <br>
likely taken from another station, talking about a competitor going to <br>
the world championships who was going to be doing the cube with his <br>
feet.<br>
<br>
It was Chris Szlatenyi, who I see is listed in the unofficial world <br>
records for 3x w/feet (second in both fastest time, average).<br>

That&#x27;s the only coverage I&#x27;ve seen so far. Others??<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well first of all there are a LOT of people still here.

Anyway congratulations on learning the fridrich method. What do you
mean by finishing with fridrich? Did you learn all the OLL and PLL
algos? If yes then thats great!

Also what are your current times? I have also completed 1 year now and
am averaging just below 40 seconds now :( looks like i too am a slow
learner,

Keep cubing
Sachin.

Jean Pons solved all three of his cubes in less than<br>

A pity that Dan Knights didn&#x27;t qualify, but it&#x27;s simply amazing what&#x27;s 
happened in this sport in just 2 years.  I can&#x27;t wait to see some 
videos.

I bet many more new records will be se this time in the WC&#x27;s.

And 145 competitors for the 3x3x3 event! I never thought so many ppl
would turn up.

&gt; Wow, I just checked out the top 36 on rubiks.com and<br>

&gt; Looks like Bob Peters didn&#x27;t go but there are a few<br>
&gt; new names like Matt Walter who was in the top 36.<br>
&gt; I guess 16.39 s is the new national record for Canada<br>
&gt; unless Matt breaks his own record on Sunday.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Jean Pons solved all three of his cubes in less than<br>
&gt; 15 seconds... <br>
<br>
I had dinner with him just before he left for Orlando.<br>
He had sub-15&#x27;&#x27; times even after some beers.<br>
<br>
His F2L (after cross on top) is just 100% amazing.<br>
<br>
Now that he had the opportunity to train on stackmat<br>
the month before Orlando, I guess he might become<br>
dangerous also in competition.<br>

I guess I should track down a video to answer this, but where does he 
put the cross during F2L?

On bottom.
He solves 3 edges on top, then usually turns the cube
upside-down while inserting the 4th one, and doing some
[D,D&#x27;,D2] in the process.
I have the impression that he usually only needs 2 seconds
to insert the 2 last pairs, averaging 8&#x27;&#x27; for the whole
F2L, &quot;quand il est chaud&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, his world record is so amazing (I watch that video over and over
again). BTW I also do the cross on top (and switch sides when
inserting last edge), but I&#x27;m no where near any record :-): I &quot;only&quot;
average 50 seconds (after 2 months) &quot;quand je suis chaud&quot;.

Btw u should see a doctor if ur wrists still hurt, it might be serious.

Also have u tried any one-footed cubing yet? And do u have any video
of ur solve?

          <div class="email-content">Wowowow.  All kinds of worms here.

1) The competition is just plain STIFF.  Four people missed the 
cutoff by less than 0.1 seconds - ouch!!!  The two names right after 
that are Petrus and Knights...two of yesteryear&#x27;s giants.

2) I must admit a bit of disappointment that Jessica Fridrich is not 
there.  Besides being the world&#x27;s #1 female cubist, she perhaps more 
than anyone has helped bring about this current revival of cubing.  
Ah well.

3) The top 5 should be no surprise at all.  In fact among the top 25 
there&#x27;s just a couple of names I don&#x27;t recognize (the guy from Canada 
and Spain).  I&#x27;m expecting a full-on duel between Jean and Macky, but 
don&#x27;t count the others out.

4) Bob Burton did better on all his 3x3 solves than on his second 2x2 
solve.

There aren&#x27;t any results for the clock or magic, I would love to see 
those.  Well anyways GOOD LUCK to everyone...the final showdown 
begins in 20 minutes!!!

          <div class="email-content">Hello all! I just wanted to say that it was an honor and a pleasure to <br>
meet so many of you at this year&#x27;s world championship. This event has <br>
definitely sparked my interest in cubing again. I&#x27;ve never been around <br>
anyone physically who was faster than myself (24-30ish average) and <br>
seeing practically everyone there smoke me psyched me up. I&#x27;m going to <br>
get active in the community again as much as I can, including actually <br>
updating my web page and adding new content! Final Fantasy online <br>
stole my passion for cubing for like 1.5 years, but I&#x27;ve vanquished <br>
that demon and ready to improve my skills more.<br>
<br>
I want to thank everyone who shared their tips to me and once again <br>
say how cool it was meeting the folks I&#x27;ve only known online for a few <br>
years. That event was awesome! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to wait for <br>
the next one! <br>

P.S. Will people post their pictures/videos from the event, as I <br>
didn&#x27;t get to take any.<br>

If that reporter is correct (always THE question ;P ) Jean Pons would
be world champion.. I&#x27;m anxious to see sunday&#x27;s results. Rubiks.com is
up again so maybe they&#x27;ll be up soon.
Also this quote caught my attention:
&quot;He said the next world championships will be held in 2007, likely
somewhere in Europe.&quot;
That&#x27;s exciting news for us Europeans... 

Looking forward to results, pics and videos!

Good to have the news, but Bah! -- why no details on the Rubik&#x27;s site?!
We wouldn&#x27;t be left guessing if this were a golf or volleyball 
championship...

I too would like to quickly mention how awesome it was to be able to
attend this years world championships.  Meeting everyone was even
better than I could have hoped.  Congradulations to all the winners of
all the events, and to all the world record breakers!

Unfortunately, I have to get back to the daily grind of classes and
work.  I&#x27;ll try to get my pictures up sometime soon.

          <div class="email-content">You are correct. As soon as you touch both foil pads, the timer starts
and then stops when you touch them again.  I haven&#x27;t yet had time (and
lets be honest, the know how) to develop a logic circuit to make it
actually work like the stackmats.  I do feel that it prepared me quite
well for the Dallas tournament though, very little adaptation from my
method with this timer was needed to do decently at the competition.

Basically all thats happening is that the transistor can tell when the
circuit is completed by you touching both pads.  When this happens, it
allows more current to flow through the start/stop switch circuit. 
That&#x27;s the gist anyway.  I believe a young man on the group came up
with a very effective little timer that doesn&#x27;t bother with these
pesky transistors though... Might have a look in the archives for his
post.

This &quot;mind&quot;-work, his great cubing talent, and probably a <br>

Wowowow.  All kinds of worms here.<br>
<br>
1) The competition is just plain STIFF.  Four people missed the <br>
cutoff by less than 0.1 seconds - ouch!!!  The two names right after <br>
that are Petrus and Knights...two of yesteryear&#x27;s giants.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ouch is right, I tied for 38th and was only slower than 36th by 0.06 seconds<br>
:-( Oh well, I had a great time, and congrats to everyone!<br>

          <div class="email-content">This has happened to me as well, though not in the context of a 
cubing contest.  Usually when I have to do something nervewracking, I 
feel pretty good until I actually start, at which point the 
nervousness just EXPLODES.  As with you, I don&#x27;t necessarily feel it 
in my emotions, but it may come out in some other way.

For example, I remember one time when I was performing a skit in 
front of a crowd of 30-40 people.  Emotionally I felt absolutely fine 
even during the skit, but a few minutes into it my stomach started 
cramping like crazy.  It got so bad that I had to make a creative 
exit and leave my skitmates to improvise why I left. :P  So in my 
experience, your emotions may be able to avoid the nervousness, but 
your body will take the hit instead.  Sounds like you are similar in 
that regard?  Sorry it had to be your hands :(

          <div class="email-content">Definetly the best tournament I&#x27;ve been to so far.  It was great to <br>
meet so many of you.  The tournament ran smoothly as far as I could <br>
tell, though I didn&#x27;t get to see any &#x27;behind the scenes&#x27; panic that may <br>
have occured.  Many thanks to the organizers.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m happy with my results in all categories :) Except for my 2nd round <br>
(3x3) results.  A 23.53 average?  What was I doing??  And of course for <br>
5x5 I had a monsterous pop, and didn&#x27;t recover all the pieces.  Grant <br>
and Betty were kind enough to let me use a spare 5x5 cube for my second <br>
attempt.  I was surprised anyone let me borrow one after I blew 25 <br>
pieces out.<br>
<br>
I hope to get a report up soon.  Happy cubing everyone :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I returned to Boston from Disney World at about 11:30 a.m. I had a great time over the <br>
weekend seeing people I haven&#x27;t seen in two years and meeting new people for the first time. <br>
I had fun competing though an outside competition isn&#x27;t as good as an indoor one.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday morning between 8 and 10 a.m. Cory Laviglio, Chris Szlatenyi, and I will <br>
appear on a show on ESPN2 called Cold Pizza (www.coldpizza.tv). We will be on two times for <br>
about 10 seconds during the early part of the show. Then between 9:30 and 10 we will <br>
compete against each other and talk about the cube and the competition for about 5 <br>
minutes.<br>
<br>
I will post pictures later this week when I get a chance.<br>

few pictures, but my cell phone sort of died on the 4th.  I could

Next trip I&#x27;ll be better prepared. Bring enough software to restore my
cell phone if it dies.  Bring a phone cord and have a dialup account
ready in case there is no broadband.

          <div class="email-content">nice =) i wonder.. maybe a reverse mechanism would work. have it in 
contact at rest position.. then pushing down would take it out of 
contact.. and releasing would trigger the contact to start it.. then 
stopping would require a quick (to avoid delays) press.. does this 
sound like it&#x27;d work?

Hey Everyone,<br>
<br>
     Indeed this was an awesome tournament.  I do thank the organizers as it went pretty smoothly.   Congrats to all the people who did well and broke some records- and congrats for those who even showed up!  It was pretty awesome meeting some of the people I chat with online; unfortunately I didn&#x27;t speak to some of you after the tournament, I had a plane to catch ;).  Yeah I had to leave right after the 3x3 final round apparently, which was kind of unexpected. I had a 3x3 shirt that I wanted to everyone to sign, like I did wc2003.   Nonetheless, I had fun and it was cool to meet some cool people.<br>
<br>
     Also to thank everyone else that was there.  It seems there&#x27;s gonna be a wc2007?...hm.  ~peace<br>

          <div class="email-content">Typical Guimond stuff. Not interesting at all. And my English isn&#x27;t alot 
better than your translator&#x27;s, but I think you&#x27;ll get the idea.

&quot;I decided to write to only one of the 3 French guys so I could optimize 
hismetnal preparation, and I chose Jean.
then follows I think parts of the mail he wrote to Jean, and Jean&#x27;s answer:
GG: do you think you did a mistake by posting you average on 
speedcubing.com shortly before the French Champs?
JP: Yes it was a mistake because I had to handle lots of pressure during 
the championship.
GG: blah blah blah but I think you&#x27;ll go to Florida.
JP: yes, Winning moves sent me there (instead of paying me the money 
prize of 300EUR)
GG: good luck
JP: thanks
GG: I don&#x27;t know how many of you will be there, but if Chambon wants 
Pons to win and vice versa, then the pressure will be easier to handle 
and you&#x27;ll have better chances.
JP: yes you&#x27;re right, I think it&#x27;ll be easier that way and I guess we 
can make it to the top 3, with Chambon.

very, very rough translation, but it doesn&#x27;t deserve a lot better.

François

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
I just arrived home, and I am feeling pretty sad now that it is all <br>
over. I had such a fantastic time it was unbelievable. I can&#x27;t <br>
really sum up in words everything that I am feeling right now, but I <br>
really feel sorry for the guys who couldnt make it because you <br>
really did miss out on an awesome weekend.<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t mention everybody here of course, so I won&#x27;t even try, but I <br>
had a really brilliant time with you all.<br>
<br>
I feel fairly happy with my performances, I set yet another NR for <br>
the 3x3x3 and also captured the Megaminx NR! So not too bad :) But I <br>
feel very humble to be placed so highly (17th out of 150 or so), <br>
against such world class competition. Naturally Congratulations to <br>
Jean, who did a great job, and to Edouard, whom it was a real <br>
pleasure to finally meet for the first time. Also Macky, who did so <br>
well to come third place with the huge pressure of cameras following <br>
his every move, I&#x27;m sure at one point they even followed him to <br>
the &quot;restroom&quot;...<br>
<br>
Also Congratulations to Chris Hardwick, who had the toughest job <br>
when it came to getting the fasetst time for your country, I salute <br>
you! I must mention Lars V and Frank as well, who proved dominant on <br>
the larger cubes (Lars on Square-1 also), and of course Yuki whose <br>
fantastic talent at the 4x4x4 has inspired me to improve my times <br>
even more.<br>
<br>
Finally, thank you to Ron, Ton, and Tyson, without your behind the <br>
scenes organisation we would not have had half as much fun.<br>
<br>
It is a bit of a shame that the competition was held outdoors in <br>
such strong, direct sunlight. Of course, the light made it hard for <br>
all competitors, but I&#x27;m sure that some people coped with the heat <br>
much better than others. Maybe that&#x27;s the home advantage? I don&#x27;t <br>
think that it would be a good idea to have another competition <br>
outdoors, but that&#x27;s not to say that it wasn&#x27;t a great event.<br>
<br>
One final request, I want to make a page on my site with all the <br>
pictures that people have taken from the Worlds, organised day by <br>
day. If you took some pictures, and do not have the capability of <br>
uploading them to a website, then please send them to <br>
dan@... - I would love to see them and get them <br>
online. Also, if you can get pics online, still send them to me! I <br>
really love to see all your media.<br>
<br>
I am definitely going to spend more time working hard on improving <br>
my puzzles, and I hope that I will be able to give the French a good <br>
run for their money next time! :) And Stefan, I will beat you on the <br>
clock next time for sure...<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone for such an amazing time, I have so many great <br>
memories already.<br>
<br>
See you soon!<br>
<br>
Dan H :)<br>

California who mailed them to me.
Although the stickers are light-years better than the

Does anyone else find that the cubesmith&#x27;s textured stickers have actually
less grip than the regular ones?
Do they get more grip with use?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll do my little write up in a bit...but I have one question Dan...

Did you and Joel ever figure out who was saying my name right???

For all of you who have no idea what that means...Joel Van Noort and 
Dan were having the biggestargument on how to Say my name...I believe 
they were pronouncing it the same, but with dan&#x27;s accent it came out 
differently...but w/e...My write up to come when I have the time to 
write it...

nice =) i wonder.. maybe a reverse mechanism would work. have it in 
contact at rest position.. then pushing down would take it out of 
contact.. and releasing would trigger the contact to start it.. then 
stopping would require a quick (to avoid delays) press.. does this 
sound like it&#x27;d work?

<br>
I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I am going stir crazy waiting for the<br>
results!  I don&#x27;t even know my placement in a couple of the events I<br>
competed in!  I e-mailed the rubiks.com contact section about the<br>
results, but I think they are all out and about still in Orlando until<br>
the 9th.<br>
<br>
Anyway I had a wonderful time, I&#x27;d rather save all my comments<br>
memories for a report, which I will write once I get the pictures from<br>
Becky&#x27;s camera, which should happen later today.<br>
<br>
Anyway I had such a wonderful time meeting everyone, from old friends<br>
to new faces.  I hope to see everyone again, and more new faces, in<br>
2007 (which I really hope will be in Europe) :-D<br>

Will soon have a report up with my take on WC2005.<br>

It was in the immediately preceding post from him.  Have noticed before

Yes, that most likely is mine.  I was missing it the day of the
finals, which is why I used Craig&#x27;s Magic.  I assume the plastic is
quite worn.

Btw, thanks again Craig because my black one is not good.

Hi Tyson,

This is from my intermediate method. Does it work for you.

U(FB)2U(FB)2R2BF&#x27;U2R&#x27;U2B&#x27;FR2U&#x27;

16 moves in HTM - it&#x27;s optimal for that metric.

For anyone who has the document (I referenced the link a few days 
ago), it&#x27;s algorithm 4.3.7 (single ring flip, although I didn&#x27;t call 
it that in this document) from page 15.
You can get the double ring flip from 4.5.7 (page 31).

          <div class="email-content">That works.  I&#x27;ll have to play around with it to see if it&#x27;s worth it 
as opposed to setup moves + the 4-flip algorithm.  Oh, Leyan came up 
with a good method of stopping the timer on a Generation 2.  Basically 
start your hands from the outside and slide them in.  It works very 
quickly and you won&#x27;t miss and you won&#x27;t hit the reset button.

&gt;Does anyone know an algorithm to flip the FU, BU, FD, and BD edges?  If <br>

What I would use if I saw this in competition is:

What I should use is:
   B&#x27; R&#x27; B (M U)*4 B&#x27; R B

I need to work on optimizing my solutions for blindfolded.  Hopefully by 
doing that I&#x27;ll be able to pull my times down.

And yeah, props to Generation 2 timers for blindfold solving!  No more

To whoever is posting results on rubiks.com, I&#x27;ve seen a few requests <br>

If the poster/webmaster for rubiks.com reads this group, could we (in <br>

          <div class="email-content">Thats an easy one. Heres what i would do:

First, fold 2 tiles from the right and 2 tiles from the left behind 
the puzzle. Then turn the puzzle 90 degrees counter clockwise. Now 
fold out 2 tiles in the middle to the right and 2 to the left. now 
fold the puzzle in half away from you like a valley. Fld 2 tiles from 
the right down and 2 from the left down. you should have the puzzle 
stacked up. now peel off a tile from the top right side down. Peel 
one tile from the lower left up. Unfold the puzzle. Fold 2 tiles from 
the right and 2 from the left behind the puzzle (like the first 
time). Turn it 90 degrees again and unfold it. Fold the top half over 
the bottom. Then fold it out into a loop and slide the top half one 
tile to the right. Unfold the puzzle, and it should be fine.

Be sure to read this (scroll down to &quot;Getting back to the starting 
position&quot;):

I don&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t be.

Those Jalapeno cubes are very similar to start with as my normal cube,
which I used in Orlando.  With a few grinding solves and a lot of
lube, I think they&#x27;ll be excellent.  I&#x27;ll just have to make sure to
peel off the stickers carefully, so I can transplant them onto a cube
that doesn&#x27;t turn as well.  Rivets aren&#x27;t nearly as big a deal as a
lot of people seem to think.

          <div class="email-content">I second that notion; that was the best. It was great meeting 
everyone and associating new names with faces. Dan, it was great 
cubing with you, and Joel, it was equally awesome discussing 
methods. Finally meeting all the European cubers is a thrill, 
especially Ron and Jean Pons. I had the honor of racing Mr. Akimoto 
in a 3x3x3 solve. Twice. ;) Good times...good times. Oh, a special 
thanks to Mark Polinkovsky for being himself and to the Mark team 
for the hilarious full-contact competition. That right there was 
worth the trip. It was also great meeting up with everyone from US 
Nationals. Ton, Jasmine, Doug, Chris... Great seeing you all again! 
I&#x27;ll post a link to a couple of pictures after I upload them. :) I 
hope everyone got some rest and are catching up with their lives.

Don&#x27;t you mean the &#x27;push pull&#x27;? I thank Katsu for showing me that.

          <div class="email-content">I started using the Petrus method 5 months ago and I think I&#x27;m quite
good at starting with 2x2x2. First I usually create a c/e pair. If
there exists one already, I will use it. After I have a c/e pair I&#x27;ll
use it to create a 1x2x2-block. It is quite simple to do, at
least after some practice. Then I just finish the 2x2x2 by solving the
edge that doesn&#x27;t belong to the 1x2x2-block and after solving it I
place the 1x2x2 with one move. Usually the whole thing takes less than
8 moves.
Well, this how I do it. I don&#x27;t know does it help. Anyway, the best
advice I can give is just pracitce, practice, practice. 2x2x2 is a lot
more complicated to create than cross.

Hey Craig,

No I think we still disagree about this... LOL :).

Anyways, I just got home, and I am very tired, so I am going to get 
some sleep first... But the WC was great. I loved meeting all of you, 
and even though I have been cubing for 2 years, I learned a lot of new 
stuff :).

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
It was great meeting you all in Florida!<br>
Happy to have been part of WC 2005.<br>
Proud to have been part of the organization.<br>
<br>
Yes, competing outside was different. It was hot, and it was hard to <br>
see the times on the displays. But the best have won, so no excuses. <br>
Congrats to Jean, Yuki, Frank, Leyan and all the others.<br>
<br>
Here some statistics from WC 2005:<br>
<br>
1) average age of competitors: 23 years 10 months<br>
2) average age of 3x3 finalists: 18 years 9 months (Jon being 30!)<br>
<br>
I am getting too old for this. :-)<br>
<br>
3) average solve in 1st round: 37.29 seconds<br>
4) average solve in semi final: 20.14 seconds<br>
5) average solve in final: 16.93 seconds...<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t miss the next WC!!!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ron,

I have a slight problem with the Master Magic Event...

It says there that I did not compete at all, and I had witnesses to my
solves, one of them being sub-5 seconds...One was 4.94 I believe, the
other around 5.16, but I don&#x27;t know why it wasn&#x27;t recorded (the judge
wrote them down)  I wasn&#x27;t on the results sheet at WC either, it said
DNS, so maybe there were 2 sheets with my name on them???

Thanx,
Craig

          <div class="email-content">I concur. I had very much fun meeting all the cubers...and there were 
so many! It&#x27;s great to see that our object of obsession is starting 
to gain popularity. =) Congratulations to Jean, Edouard, Yuki, Frank, 
Leyan, and all the other winners and finalists. It&#x27;s amazing how the 
times have improved since Toronto!

Jean and Edouard put up impressive times in the final. I had no big 
mistake, so I have no excuse for the 16 average. They simply 
performed better under the competition condition. The funny thing is, 
Saturday night at dinner, all the Japanese cubers, Jean, and Edouard 
were racing, and the three of us sat in the same order as we did for 
the picture of the three top finishers. I also had the opportunity to 
talk to Jean and Edouard a little in French (I&#x27;ll have to practice 
quite a bit now). Very nice meeting you two!

I started listing everyone&#x27;s name but then decided that it would take 
too long. So, everyone I&#x27;d met before, it was nice to see you again; 
everyone I hadn&#x27;t met before, it was nice meeting you. I wish that I 
hadn&#x27;t had so much homework to do. There were a lot of people I 
wanted to talk to, and I feel that I didn&#x27;t get to do that very much. 
I look forward to meeting you all again in the future.

Of course, much thanks to Ron, Tyson, judges, scramblers, and the 
organizers for putting together a great competition.

And a bad news: it looks like I left my camera outside the main 
building on Monday morning, just before I left. Anyone seen a silver 
Nikon Coolpix in a gray cover? If I promised to send you a picture, 
sorry! I might just have to steal mr. hamster&#x27;s camera.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I know there have been groups in the past for corners-first, blindfold<br>
solving, etc.  Well I created a ZB method group here at:<br>
<br>
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/zbmethod/<br>
<br>
I am going to get very serious about learning ZBLL algs again.  I<br>
already know 1 COLL case for the U orientation, and will be trying to<br>
finish it in less than 5 months.  Then I want to learn the L<br>
orientation (names come from Dan Harris&#x27; page).  After that I want to<br>
take averages, as I think those three orientation cases, plus the no<br>
OLL case orientation, will be enough to average sub-16 fairly often<br>
with ZB.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as far as I am concerned this method is an experiment, but it<br>
sounds like there are others interested in learning.<br>
<br>
In order to make it easier for us to share ideas, if you are<br>
interested in learning please join the group so we can discuss ideas<br>
and things.<br>
<br>
Even if you&#x27;re a skeptic, please feel free to join the group.  Again<br>
this method is an experiment, so I think it would be best to have<br>
people for and against it feel free to discuss how they feel about the<br>
method.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m just going to post here about the creation of this group, I will<br>
try to contain my discussion of ZB to the ZB group in the future.<br>

we found your camera in the restaurant. We handed it over at the 
reception desk and we told them it was yours, so you can have it 
picked up or sent to you.  

Once again I had another great time meeting you all also. And it is 
truely amazing how much the standard has risen. I felt quite bad 
about just missing out on the 3x3 final (I finished 13th in the 
semis) but if I look at all those wonderful averages that other 
people set, I should be quite proud of my placing. 

This was certainly the best Rubik&#x27;s competition I&#x27;ve been to and I 
hope there will be many more.

          <div class="email-content">Well, I guess it is time to put my two cents in...I&#x27;ll write a report 
sometime.

It was amazing meeting everyone for the first time.  I never expected 
everyone to as nice as they were.  Some of the people didn&#x27;t look 
like I expected, but that&#x27;s given when you are making assumptions.  
Thank you everyone who taught me something new, and to everyone that 
was there and I got to talk to and hang out with thank you too.  I 
can&#x27;t wait until I go to another tournament.

Congratulations to all the winners of the different events and 
congratulations on all the world records that were broken, you guys 
are amazing at what you do.

Craig

P.S. - I did a magic average of 100 last night, got 1.56, best 
average of 10 (12 dropping fastest and slowest) was 1.44, and Bob...I 
broke my 1.40 PB soooo many times, and I got one sub-1.3 solve, which 
tied your old world record.  I am coming to get you all in the 
magic...watch out...

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys (and guyesses ...) :D<br>
<br>
Many great things have been said about the WC in Orlando and i agree <br>
with what has been said. It&#x27;s amazing to see so many fast cubers <br>
when there is about zilch (nil) in Norway taking cubing seriously. <br>
12 guys in the final without Lars Vandenbergh or Ron van Bruchem or <br>
Joël van Noort in it. Well, that looks weird to me ... hehehe ... <br>
And a bunch of world and national records were set.<br>
<br>
But im not really too happy with the organisation of the event. My <br>
main complaints are :<br>
<br>
- should be outdoor to provide fairness and better atmosphere for <br>
the contestants<br>
<br>
- poor result service, not very good use of the large monitor <br>
provided ... no info about &quot;side events&quot;<br>
<br>
- discrimination of the &quot;side events&quot; - non rubiks puzles, and also <br>
dicrimination of these as only the winners were called, not 3rd, 2nd <br>
and 1st like for the other events<br>
<br>
- very bad conditions for fewest moves, first day inside in a small <br>
room, second day even worse ... outside sitting by a small table <br>
only ... also first day the scramble was not provided on a sheet <br>
like second day ... and i really hope we can use stickers next <br>
time ... i always end up with cycles in the end .. with no stickers <br>
i can&#x27;t optimise anything :-( ... i gonna propose changes to the <br>
rules fo fewest moves :-)<br>
<br>
Ok, now for some positive feedback. I spoke to Dave Hedley Jones. I <br>
suggested some improvments for the 5x5x5 cube. And actually they are <br>
now doing some re-engineering, so now is a good time to come up with <br>
ideas for improving their puzzles :-) I will send Dave an email to <br>
remind him and then we will see how it goes ...<br>
<br>
It was really great to see the faces behind all the names that i <br>
knew beforehand :-D<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Haha David, I just got on here to post a message about that, since I
just checked slashdot.  You beat me to it.

One of the interesting things I noticed while reading through the
comments is that there are far more people who are amazed rather than
skeptical.  Whenever a speedcubing video gets posted to a site (I
remember one on fazed.org), a lot of people instantly assume its a
fake, and try to think about how they made the fake video.  I think
since people can see that there is a world championships, it adds a
lot of credibility in their minds.

I hope speedcubing.com can handle the slashdotting.  Was the poster a
member of the group, or was it an outsider?

Or for a better solution, make a mirror of the current page using some
mirroring software and host it on some temporary server for now. Of
course you wont like this soultion because none of the scripts will
work, but if u have the scripts and are worried only about the
graphics and stuff then mirroring is a good option.

Let us know how you do it.

Hi John,

What do you mean by &quot;American&quot; cubes? Ideal made some cubes in America
and Logical Games made the &quot;American Cube&quot; before Ideal made any cubes.
I haven&#x27;t tried to make a speedcube out of either, though apparently
the &quot;American Cube&quot; cam lubed with silicone!

For speedcubing I rate the cubes:

1. Ideal Tiled Deluxe Edition
Best all around, no other cube comes close. It has adjusting screws
and is arched underneath the centers - the hard, slick plastic is
thicker than others and is faster unlubed than all the other cubes
lubed. It is a bit heavier than other cubes. Rarely pops or locks up.
Takes silicon spray lube very well, but not Rubiks.com lube. No need
for stickers.

The Rubik&#x27;s Game/Challenge has Deluxe cubes with peg holes. I takes
about 5 minutes to get used to the peg holes which can make for better
grip.

2. The new cubes from Seven Towns (Rubiks.com, Hasbro, Winning Moves
and Hessport)
Comes with arched centers, can be ordered with screws as a DIY. These
never pop. Lighter than the Deluxe, it takes rubiks.com lube well.
Tends to lock up more than the Deluxe. They come with terrible
stickers. Averages 1 1/2 seconds slower than Deluxe for 30 second solve. 

3. Ideal cubes circa 1980-1983.
The ones made in Hungary, England, and Hong Kong are the best. I have
heard that the ones made in Korea are good, too. Avoid the Taiwan-made
cubes.  These have adjustable screws, and excellent stickers. Very few
have arches, but the arched version is the lightest official cube.
Without arches they tend to pop instead of locking up. Averages 2 1/2
second slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve.

4. Rubik&#x27;s studio cubes. Has the best plastic of cubes made nowadays.
Comes with screws but not arches. Pops quite a lot. Averages nearly
three second slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve. I have&#x27;t
used the three I have enough to know the sticker wear.

5. Older Hasbro (etc) cube (before 2000) had screws, but not arches. A
friends older Hasbro speedcube is fairly quick, but I have little
experience with this one. The one I have is terrible.

6. Wonderful Puzzler.
Well made knock-off, came with arches. Never tried to make one into a
speed cube. I don&#x27;t know if they have screws.

7. C*4 cube
Made by Matchbox in the late 80s, with Rubik&#x27;s silkouette and
signature. Lousy plastic. Not a very good cube.

8. Mefferts
These are terrible because they have no pressure and you must stop a
turn with effort. Constantly locks up. Decent plastic, but no springs
or screws.

There are lots of tiled cubes out there which are terrible, leading
the list is the &quot;Old Brand Magic Square&quot; (though Stefan likes the
springs). The only high quality tiled knock-off was called Gyro Cube,
and it has flat centers.

Regards,

David J

Go to Wales and beat the guy up.

Why don&#x27;t you have your own webspace? It got real cheap by now. There 
are also websites that list good hosts, with tests for speed and 
availability, and user feedback. Well, I&#x27;m only assuming there&#x27;s one 
for UK. Here&#x27;s one for Germany so you know what I&#x27;m talking about:
http://www.hostsuche.de/top10_bew_all.php

You can see the #1 in the list has 306 positive feedbacks and 0 
negative. Feedback is what I mainly care about besides the price. If 
you look at their website you&#x27;ll see you can get for example 1GB 
webspace with unlimited traffic for about 3.50 GBP per month.

Cheers!
Stefan

<br>
In the notation I use, where lower case means a slice, instead of<br>
taking the long way around, like L2 R2 D2 L2 F2 L2 R2 B2 R2 D2 which<br>
is 10 moves, or L2 R2 D U&#x27; B2 F2 D U&#x27; which is 8 moves, my 4-spot<br>
pattern is four moves: r2 u r2 u&#x27;.<br>
<br>
The 6-spot pattern is four moves, too: r f r&#x27; f&#x27;.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m interested in the fewest moves needed to solve the cube using this<br>
notation. What metric should these be classified within? What would<br>
the upper and lower bounds be?<br>

Deluxe for Y second solve&quot; stats for Y less than 30? With 30 it&#x27;s not 
really interesting since you don&#x27;t need fast turning or good look 
ahead for that at all. I&#x27;d be more interested in Y=15.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

There is no problem usually to have a webspace anywhere in the world 
these days, as long as the sign-up procedures are possible to do 
with ur knowledge of the language used on the sign-up page. And as 
long as the web-host can offer you the features that you will need : 
php + mysql or apache + tomcat or .net + SQL-Server or whatever.

So Dan, when you finally retrieve all your stuff on Chris Maggs&#x27; 
site you can sign up cheaply in Germany or in UK. Actually, if the 
price is only £3.50 month i can pay it for you ;-) But you will 
still ned to be the webmaster :D

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Very thorough analysis.  I would add a few minor points.

1) The Ideal tiled model is MAJORLY expensive (I think $300 is not 
unheard of)!

2) I would also caution against the Korean cubes which appear to be 
hit or miss.  The ones I got already came with some nasty lube that 
looked like earwax.  It was impossible to get it all off and when I 
added silicone...the cube was toast.  It would not turn without 
sticking.

3) Virtually all Ideal cubes, except maybe the Hungarian ones, have a 
color scheme of white-opp-blue, yellow-opp-green.  If you get a tiled 
or game cube I&#x27;m not sure how easy it is to switch over to 
the &quot;standard&quot; white-yellow.  Stickers are not much of a problem 
thanks to Cubesmith, though you may need some extra solvents to get 
all the gunk off from the old ones.

BTW, I am now forcing myself to use white-yellow.  A new convert 
after 20+ years of doing it the &#x27;wrong&#x27; way.

Slice HTM, surely.

Well.. the upper bound cannot /exceed/ Mike Reid&#x27;s figure of 29, which 
is the current upper bound in HTM.  Presumably this could be reduced, 
but you&#x27;d have to persuade someone to repeat Reid&#x27;s calculations for 
your new metric.

As for the lower bound, I don&#x27;t currently have the energy to do the 
standard counting argument, taking into account commutation of moves on 
the same axis -- but you almost certainly know how to do this anyway.  
Since it is the argument that gives 18 (rather than 20) as the lower 
bound for HTM, you probably wanted something better than that.  

Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have an optimal solver for this metric, so I 
can&#x27;t try likely-looking candidates...

Regards
Mike

I just checked up, he&#x27;s not registered with a BT phone line, or he

Since we talked about this on Sunday, I&#x27;ve switched to this as my
primary alg for the case, but I do it in reverse.  M&#x27; U2 M2 U2 M&#x27; U M2
U M2 U2.

I think this is actually the same alg that I posted a while back, but
abandoned because I couldn&#x27;t get fast with it.

After practicing this time for perhaps 50 repetitions it&#x27;s slightly
faster than my old alg, and still improving.  I really like M U algs
for the edge perms, because I can do them quickly.

I didn&#x27;t realize you posted both algorithms.  I only remembered the

You need to talk to Ian Winokur.  He was telling me about his
brother&#x27;s program.  I thought he said the link was www.jwinyeh.com,
but I tried that and it didn&#x27;t exist.

I guess I really should have written it down...

Anyway, you upload whatever algs you want into the program, and it
gives you cases to practice based off the algs.  You can customize it
to give you OLLs, PLLs, ZBLL, etc.

Those stats were accurate for me when I took them about two years ago.

In the Spring tournament in 2004 I loaned Macky one of my Deluxe cubes
and he did a &quot;Champion&#x27;s Solve&quot; 12.29 IIRC. When I got home I found
that I had given him the wrong cube and the one he used, though
adjusted nicely, was not lubed.

I&#x27;d need to get someone quicker than I to get you sub fifteen numbers.

This was the first Official Color Scheme back the, The old 4x4x4s and
2x2x2&#x27;a were that color too. As for switching to the newer Official
Color Scheme, BOY, ask Stefan.

Yeah, the next person who tells me that they solved the cube by
switching stickers I&#x27;m going to invite home to help me change stickers
on a few cubes!

Cool. I prefer the old standard.

What color do you use for the Last Level? I use Red for the Last
Level, but I don&#x27;t use the cross.

          <div class="email-content">All --<br>
<br>
Out of curiousity, I decided to use a &quot;points system&quot; to determine <br>
the &quot;Top Cuber&quot; and &quot;Top Puzzler&quot; at WC2005. I&#x27;ve been thinking about <br>
this as an extra category at competitions.<br>
<br>
**** Quick Explanation:<br>
<br>
&quot;points system&quot; = 10pts for first, 9 for second, etc, through top 10 <br>
or end of competitors or DNF/DNS. If final was only 8 people, I gave <br>
points to #9/#10 from previous round.<br>
<br>
&quot;Top Cuber&quot; = list people by most points based on cubing events listed <br>
on main stage (2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 3x-blind, 3x-onehand, 3x-feet, 3x-<br>
fewestmoves, 4x-blind, 5x-blind)<br>
<br>
&quot;Top Puzzler&quot; = list people by ost points based on all events <br>
(includes &quot;side&quot; events aka Magic, Clock, Megaminx, Square1, Master <br>
Magic, 3x-speed-blindfolded, Magic-onehand).<br>
<br>
**** Results<br>
<br>
Top Cuber<br>
---------<br>
Leyan Lo = 34 pts<br>
Chris Hardwick = 27 pts<br>
Yuki Hayashi = 22 pts<br>
Shotaro Makisumi = 21 pts<br>
Masayuki Akimoto = 20 pts<br>
<br>
Leyan and Chris both placed top 10 in five events - very impressive!<br>
<br>
<br>
Top Puzzler<br>
-----------<br>
Stefan Pochmann = 61 pts<br>
Alexander Ooms = 36 pts<br>
Leyan Lo = 34 pts<br>
Chris Hardwick = 31 pts<br>
Lars Vandenbergh = 30 pts<br>
<br>
Stefan placed in every &quot;side&quot; event except 3x-speedblindfold, winning <br>
three and placing second, third and sixth in the others - he is Puzzle-<br>
Man.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Good evening,

For those of you who were at the world championships and got a UFO puzzle, this might 
be interesting. Wes and I wrote an interactive solver for it. You can find it at
    &lt;http://www.terpstra.ca/puzzles/ufo.php>
By clicking the pieces from the right UFO, you can move them (via the middle) to the left 
UFO. Once the left UFO is completely filled up, the program will find a move-optimal 
solution.

Interesting facts about the puzzle include:
  There are exactly 11! distinct states (12* more if you hold it differently)
    - the included booklet is wrong by 800 states for whatever reason
  Every state is reachable (all moves are odd permutations, so even/odd are both 
reachable)
  The longest distance between any two states is 16 moves

Interesting facts about the solver include:
   It only needs to explore 11 thousand states on average
   It&#x27;s written in Standard ML (compiled by MLton.org) and PHP
   On a decent machine (not that webserver), it needs &lt; 1s

Some useful operations are:
flip two neighbours &lt;http://www.terpstra.ca/puzzles/ufo.php?
gyr=0&amp;grb=1&amp;ggo=2&amp;gbg=3&amp;gop=4&amp;gpy=5&amp;bry=6&amp;bbr=7&amp;bgb=8&amp;bog=9&amp;bpo=10&amp;b
yp=11>
flip  top and bottom pieces &lt;http://www.terpstra.ca/puzzles/ufo.php?
gyr=0&amp;grb=1&amp;gbg=2&amp;ggo=3&amp;gop=4&amp;byp=5&amp;bry=6&amp;bbr=7&amp;bgb=8&amp;bog=9&amp;bpo=10&amp;g
py=11>

... notice that these are really far apart states. :-)

Have fun,

Maria

I&#x27;ve got the latest version of JRE, I downloaded the java3D program,
and I installed the cube program.

However, the shortcut does nothing, save open a box for about quarter
of a second and close it again.  The actual folder the program
downloaded to is full of class files and some MS DOS batch files. 
Nothing I can use to actually run the program.  Any help would be much
appreciated.

You&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m avging about 5s slower now.  It&#x27;s just part of a <br>
general philosophy of mine to try to be more conventional, within the <br>
realm of cubing and elsewhere.  I think I&#x27;m too individualistic.<br>

Wow, I seldom run into folks who like the old scheme!  There is one <br>
other long-time cuber at my workplace and even he likes the new one.<br>
<br>
For LL I was using blue on the old scheme and green on the new.  Now I <br>
am strictly using the new scheme with LL = yellow.  I think that&#x27;s what <br>
most people do.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve decided to better my 5x5 solving after my recent success with my<br>
homemade 4x4 method.  I&#x27;ve gotten my average down to about 9 minutes<br>
this way, but I think that&#x27;s mostly because it&#x27;s a brand new 5x5 and<br>
it doesn&#x27;t turn very well at all yet.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I solve what basically amounts to edges first, and one area<br>
I&#x27;m having entirely too much trouble in is the center pieces on the<br>
final 4 faces (all in a slice).  I finish this step by swapping single<br>
pieces between adjacent faces, and when I can see it, either rows of 3<br>
pieces, or less frequently, groups of two.<br>
<br>
My real problems stem from pieces being on opposite faces from where<br>
they go.  Currently, I have no choice but to move one piece to an<br>
adjacent face, switch the piece into place moving the second piece<br>
onto the adjacent face, and then fix the remaining pair.  It&#x27;s twice<br>
as many moves as it should be, and I suspect there are good tricks for<br>
pieces on opposite faces like on the 4x4.<br>

<br>
1) Why do you prefer logo/non-logo?  Although I don&#x27;t do this, I was <br>
thinking maybe it could help you solve the cross, (mentally <br>
remembering &quot;The white-red piece is now at the top of the logo&quot; or <br>
something like that).<br>
<br>
2) For 3x3 competitions, can you have a logo somewhere other than a <br>
center?  Can you have a logo on more than one square?<br>

> Hey guys,

I&#x27;ve been wanting to get my hands on an original Deluxe tiled cube 
(or 2) for ages and haven&#x27;t been able to find any apart from the odd 
sealed ones that come up on ebay an sell for $300 plus! How rare are 
these cubes and what are the centre caps like? 

I&#x27;ve got 2 Game Cubes that are pretty good, the only problem is that 
the centre caps are a pain to take off to adjust the screws. I&#x27;ve 
actually drilled out the peg holes in the caps of one to make for 
quick adjustment (I don&#x27;t if that would break any competition rules) 
and the screws have a wider thread which makes adjustment a bit 
tedious, but apart from that they are good cubes.

What are the crews in the Deluxe Cubes like David?

I&#x27;ve tried that, but it always comes out in 3 cycles of pieces, which
I have no end of trouble wrapping my brain around.

I&#x27;ve finally figured out a move to swap only two corner pieces on
opposite sides, but I still need moves to swap singles and edges. 
Blocks would be nice, too.

I&#x27;m looking at you, Per.

I met someone in ORLANDO who used CLL, ELL.  I was very impressed with
the speed.  CLL/ELL is very comparable to OLL/PLL, but you never get
hard PLLS.
I am interested in replacing CFOP with the Roux method as my main
method.  So I need to start learning COLL, or CLL. 

 If anyone can help out with CLL algs I&#x27;d appreciate it.

PS is CLL faster than COLL?

I met someone in ORLANDO who used CLL, ELL.  I was very impressed with
the speed.  CLL/ELL is very comparable to OLL/PLL, but you never get
hard PLLS.
I am interested in replacing CFOP with the Roux method as my main
method.  So I need to start learning COLL, or CLL. 

 If anyone can help out with CLL algs I&#x27;d appreciate it

&gt; PS is CLL faster than COLL?<br>
<br>
It is, and especially so when using the Roux method.  Even with<br>
correctly oriented edges before CLL, you can often achieve fast times<br>
with edge flipping CLL algs, simply because they&#x27;re shorter and easier.<br>
<br>
That said, a very good deal of CLL algs are really COLL algs in<br>
disguise.  Take whichever ones are fastest for you.<br>
<br>
For good CLL or COLL alg sites, speedcubing.com, Gilles Roux&#x27;s site,<br>
Lars Vandenbergh&#x27;s, Dan Harris&#x27;, and Bernard Helmsletter&#x27;s sites are<br>
all great.<br>

Thanks for the vid though, i always wanted a slow video of a blindfold

I used to do it every once in a while, if I could see a good start.<br>
Doing a 2x3x1 block every scramble 12 times is harder.  <br>
<br>
  I would like to hear from anybody who uses, or has experimentented<br>
with this method.  WHat are your averages, how many CLL cases do you<br>
know?  What do you use to flip the two edges in UF and UB?  <br>
<br>
I took my first Roux avg tonight.  Avg = 33.85  Best time was 26.88.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, I haven&#x27;t learned a single CLL alg. So Step 3 (Corners)<br>
takes me  about 6 sec.  <br>
The Last 6 Edges take me about 8-10 seconds right now, but I can cut<br>
that down to 5-6 with a little practice.  Step 4 (Edges) is comparable<br>
to OLL/PLL.<br>

For those of you who didn&#x27;t see my color scheme :
It has green on the bottom, blue on top.
For the side colors, here is the weirf thing : it has white, then
yellow, then orange, then red (from left to right) so that it goes

By the way, I improved that alg, it has now 8 moves ( + setup move)
instead of 9(+ setup) but uses the F face :

(U2) M2 U M2 U F2 M2 F2 M2

Though I think the 9 move sequence without the F is faster.

Can you tell us these improvements already? Can we apply them to the 
current cubes ourselves?

Cheers!

True, indeed.  But its pruning tables are too small for it to do this 
job in a reasonable time -- rememember that to get a good lower bound 
we&#x27;d be looking for problems whose optimal solutions were as long as 
possible.  For example, try using ACube to solve the superflip 
optimally in HTM or QTM. ;)

No you haven&#x27;t. Unless you&#x27;re taking the cube apart for this. You 
probably have a 3-cycle including two pieces of the same color, and 
knowing which three pieces you cycle will help you find setup moves 
that have the same &quot;swap two pieces&quot; effect on other sides.

Hehe, good thing I participated in so many events. Magic one-handed 
gave free 8 points cause we only had three competitors. Next time I 
swear I&#x27;ll compete in everything. Nice to see Alexander Ooms already 
at #2 beating all the &quot;top cubers&quot;, btw!

I haven&#x27;t, that&#x27;s true, but only because of poor wording.  The move
swaps two corner pieces from one center with two from the opposite.

Hi Keith,

How rare are Deluxes? I have no idea how many were made. They turn up
regularly on ebay. It is only recently that sealed Deluxes have gone
for that much (two years ago one went for $250 but that was an anomaly
then). In the last 2 years about 5 sealed Deluxe cubes have sold for
less than $70. Recently bidders who nibble have been raising the
prices (by prompting others to bid against them). Earlier this year
three times I almost won a sealed Deluxe under $70 but warring bidders
drove the price way up. Nibbling costs the bidders a whole lot of
money - in England a terrible cube that retails here for $1.00 went
for over $180. 

Some of the used Deluxe cubes I&#x27;ve gotten have no wear on them. They
cost me between a high of $39 and a low of $6. Several recent auctions
contained a Deluxe among other things and the seller didn&#x27;t know what
he had, and few people recognized it. 

The Rubik&#x27;s Game cubes are Deluxe cubes, so the screws are the same -
there are no caps, the screws are beneath the center tiles. However,
there is way you can use different screws. About 15 years ago I broke
the spindle of a Deluxe and substituted the spindle of another cube
with no problem. 

To remove the tiles and get at the screws I use a very sharp 5/8 inch
wood chisel which requires wearing work gloves. I push the edge of the
chisel under the tile as far as it can go, which really isn&#x27;t very far
but is important, before I begin gently rocking the tile back and
forth. I find I need to be patient, and gradually the glue lets go. :)

If you can determine which is the correct side to try to lever up then
you won&#x27;t be working against the structure of the tile and the trough
it sits in. The underside of the tile has two straight edges across
from each other, and two sloped edges across from each other. These
edges are twice the depth of the visible tile thickness, and fit
neatly in the trough. The straight edges lay flat against the trough
in the cubie, and if you try to lever that way you would need to bend
or break the plastic of the tile to free it. The sloped edges are
where the glue is and the right place to pry up because in that
direction the tile will move like on a rocker, with no resistance. You
may see slight indentations on the top of the tile, those are the
slanted edges. Examine the center cubie that the tile fits in and you
may see an additional way to determine which edges are slanted. 

I hope this helps.

Cheers,

David J

I don&#x27;t know how *good* a cuber I am, but I do corners first. Besides
there being fewer algorithms to remember, often by some small change
you can flip edges over as well, and sometimes flipping edges over too
is fewer moves. This also means that the edges can be solved in as
little as 8, 7 or even 5 moves.

Hi Stefan,

Being unfamiliar with metrics - after all, I was asking which metric
it fit into - I took Mike at his word that it was a new metric.

Thanks for the info.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Pedro,

It&#x27;s a standard cube from rubiks.com.  The solve was slow in that I 
wouldn&#x27;t normally be making that much noise.  A good solve portion 
blindfolded for me should take about 60 seconds or less.  My best 
solves are about 45 seconds long.

Orienting the corners was a 5-twist algorithm.  (R U2 R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U)x2 
with some cube rotation.  The song at the end... 
http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/llama.php

The number scheme I use is... for corners... every corner starts off 
with value 1.  If the corner has an orange sticker, add 1.  If the 
corner has a blue sticker, add 2.  If the corner has a yellow sticker, 
add 4.  That&#x27;ll give you the 8 numbers.

For the edges, 1 to 12 goes... (with white on top, green on front) UF

          <div class="email-content">Hi:D

The Eastsheens make the best 2x2x2, but they are not legal in 
seventowns-sponsored competitions like WC&#x27;s. For 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 there 
are different opinions. But these days most of the fast cubers use 
rubiks.com cubes. Some however don&#x27;t have the patience to break them 
in and will prefer Eastsheen here also. Some rubiks.com 5x5x5 are 
really stiff out of the box while others are &quot;reasonable&quot; or &quot;fairly 
nice&quot;.

Rubiks.com cubes u can buy directly from www.rubiks.com or from shops 
in many countries. For eastsheen cubes u can get them from www.puzzle-
shop.de or from www.mefferts.com. I never saw these in shops, but i 
live in Norway so it may be different elsewhere :-)

Cheers!

-Per

PS! Good news is that new versions os rubiks.com 5x5x5 might have an 
improved design for smoother &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; cubing :-)

Oh, and the &#x27; thing? Like, on EO, you do F&#x27; and 4-flip...and you say: &quot;Eff (I don&#x27;t know how to write this...sorry) something, that means F&#x27;.

In &quot;speed-blindfolded&quot; the time for analysis/memorization doesn&#x27;t 
count, only the twisting part does. So Geir usually takes around 3 
hours to plan/memorize a solution using a normal speedsolving method 
(e.g. Fridrich) and then executes it blindfolded in about 30-40 
seconds (from what I&#x27;ve seen in competitions so far).

Cheers!
Stefan

Wow, that&#x27;s the most extreme I&#x27;ve heard so far. Is the auction still 
visible and do you have a link to it? If not, can you tell which kind 
of cube it was?

<br>
At the WC, I&#x27;ve seen a bunch of new ideas for team solving.<br>
<br>
And I came up with the idea of &quot;teamsolving&quot; the clock.<br>
<br>
Here is a video of me and Alexander Ooms setting a time of 17.13 seconds.<br>
However, our best time was 15.11 (and a very very lucky thanks to Dan<br>
Harris 9.25 seconds)<br>
<br>
I thought you would like to see that. :-)<br>

I can&#x27;t upload files larger than 5 MB so I had to split it up with<br>

          <div class="email-content">I had wondered what method Geir was using to do this. So he probably 
memorizes the sub-sequences (&quot;this, then seqA7, then H-perm, etc&quot;) 
and then performs them blindfolded.

I took a look at Tyson&#x27;s 1:58 blindfold from NorCal 2005 - he 
memorized for 49 seconds, then twisted for 69 seconds.

I wonder how the &quot;Fewest Moves&quot; people would do in speed-blindfold - 
could they figure out the final 40-or-so move sequence, memorize it, 
then perform it in 30 or less seconds? Any FMC people want to give 
their thoughts?

          <div class="email-content">I averaged about 27 or so back just before I switched to CFOP again. 
Then, I didn&#x27;t know any corner algs, so Step 3 was two substeps for
me.  I averaged a tad over 22 just now for an average of 30, and I
haven&#x27;t practiced the method in months, literally.  That made my day.

My best times with this method are just over 17.  At present, I use
COLL cases for the Step 3 corners, and I know all but the Bruno cases.
 Using the CLL cases instead, you can save a few moves/seconds here
and there.  An easy example is the U orientation, when all four
corners are permuted incorrectly.

I haven&#x27;t learned any of the optimizations for placing edges or or
anything fancy for Step 4, which I do using the second method
described, if memory serves.  I took an average for this step just now
and got a bit under 6 seconds.  If you work at it and learn the third
method and some or all of the special cases, I don&#x27;t see why you
couldn&#x27;t get faster than that.

As for flipping UF and UB, I would orient them just like normal,
unless the F2L happened to be finished, or only those two pieces
incorrectly flipped, and perhaps an M slice edge shuffle left.  In
those cases, I would orient them with MUMUMU2M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2 or the
appropriate ELL alg, if I saw it. Anything else would be easier
accomplished as M&#x27;UMU&#x27;M&#x27;UM&#x27; as normal.

Hope this helps.

-Mike

This addresses Andy&#x27;s and Alexander&#x27;s Post.

Great Pictures both of you.  But Andy, one thing I couldn&#x27;t help
notice is that you are never smiling.  DId anyone else notice that.  I
know you can smile cuz I saw you.  And did anyone get any pictures
from the time we went to downtown disney and did that huge elimination
race??? Or the handicap race???

Anyways,

          <div class="email-content">Hi all, it&#x27;s cool to see a cubing community on Yahoo, and a lot of<br>
amazing cubers as well.<br>
I&#x27;ve been cubing since the end of July, and starting 2 weeks ago, I&#x27;m<br>
currently trying to learn the Fridrich method, with the 7<br>
Sune/antisune COLL algs thrown in to replace the 57 OLL algs. I<br>
currently average approx. 80 seconds with the method. However, I&#x27;m<br>
running into problems.<br>
I want to be able to average under a minute within a few weeks (I<br>
know, hard!). But:<br>
1. My F2L is 45-50 seconds on average, in my opinion way too long.<br>
2. I just don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; how to look ahead in a solve! (Possible<br>
explanation for #1) I will literally pause for up to 3 seconds between<br>
each pair I complete.<br>
I don&#x27;t plan on learning all 41 F2L algs for a while, and for now I<br>
know 10 of them. They are the ones from my old method (the vanilla<br>
layer-by-layer method), a couple random and more easy ones, and all<br>
the algs where the corner and edge are in the right slot, but not<br>
oriented correctly. This way, I can just connect the corner and edge,<br>
put it in the right slot, then do the respective algorithm. <br>
My opinion is, I should learn the 12 algs in F2L that have the<br>
corner-edge pair connected in the U-layer so that I don&#x27;t have to<br>
waste moves placing them in the right spot and solving, thus shaving<br>
time. But then again, I can&#x27;t tell whether that would be worth it if I<br>
 want to be able to solve under a minute by December (I average 80<br>
seconds right now). <br>
Furthermore, with my old method, where I did the first layer, then did<br>
the 2nd layer, I can perform better. My question is, should I learn<br>
those 12 corner-edge F2L algs, or should I stick with what I&#x27;ve got<br>
and concentrate on those, or should I just go back to my old F2L method?<br>
<br>
Finally, how can I practice looking ahead in any solve?<br>

Thanks for the pics. It was a pleasure sitting in front of you on the bus
back to the airport :)

I would have said hi, but it was early. And as Craig mentioned, you don&#x27;t
smile :) heh

Have a nice weekend!

Only practice will make you look ahead. Actually don&#x27;t even think<br>
about it, when you least expect you will be already doing it. This is<br>
what happends in most cases I think. When your algs are fully on auto<br>
your mind will naturally look for something to be ocupied with.<br>

&gt; those 12 corner-edge F2L algs, or should I stick with what I&#x27;ve got<br>
&gt; and concentrate on those, or should I just go back to my old F2L method?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Finally, how can I practice looking ahead in any solve?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
I had a nice talk with Frédérick Badie during WC 2005 about <br>
improvements on 4x4x4.<br>
<br>
One of the subjects was avoiding the orientation parity, as already <br>
investigated by Chris Hardwick.<br>
I really think there must be an easier way to check this parity, <br>
than to count the cycles. Counting cycles takes quite a lot of time, <br>
because you have to follow all pieces around the cube.<br>
<br>
I am pretty convinced there must be an easier way. Something like <br>
this:<br>
Take the orientation of all edges according to blindfolded cubing.<br>
For each edge pair, count whether the single cubies are oriented <br>
according to that standard. The total number of flipped edge cubies <br>
must have the factor 4.<br>
<br>
I took some randomly scrambled cubes and it was correct, but I am <br>
sure that in fact this hypothesis is not correct.<br>
Factor 2 does not work (1 flipped edge pair has that...)<br>
<br>
Anyway, please find a counter example of the factor 4.<br>
<br>
Or better, please find an easy way to check the 4x4x4 orientation <br>
parity. Maybe you can do this with diagonal cubies or whatever?<br>
<br>
Or proof that the only way is to follow the cycles.<br>
<br>
Thanks and have fun,<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi I recently picked up a Rubik&#x27;s cubeafter over 20 years of not even<br>
seeing one. At that time I was able to do it in about 60 seconds using<br>
a method learned from a book.<br>

A silly question this as I know it was a beginners method (and there<br>
must be better methods), but I&#x27;d like to know what the book was.<br>
Unfortunately all I can remember is that it had a picture of the<br>
youngster who had written it in it or on it - maybe on the back, or<br>

much to go on, but if this rings any bells with anyone, do chirp up<br>

          <div class="email-content">Lars, I feel very sorry for you because you sat in the most gutting 
position of all, 13th place.

Perhaps it should have been 16 go through to the finals, especially 
since the finals were over in about 5 minutes. But perhaps not, 
since I was sitting in 17th place ;)

Even though there were 12 places up for grabs, you can&#x27;t fit 20 very 
decent cubers into it, so it really was a lottery as to who got 
which places at the end of the semis. As we all saw, it was decided 
by fractions of a second. So Ron, Lars, Joel, Michel, Stefan, and 
Taka, don&#x27;t feel bad about not making the finals because you put up 
a stunning performance and showed yourself to be among the worlds 
speedcubing elite. And that&#x27;s definitely something to be proud of.

See you all next time :)

Dan :)

In &quot;speed-blindfolded&quot; the time for analysis/memorization doesn&#x27;t 
count, only the twisting part does. So Geir usually takes around 3 
hours to plan/memorize a solution using a normal speedsolving method 
(e.g. Fridrich) and then executes it blindfolded in about 30-40 
seconds (from what I&#x27;ve seen in competitions so far).

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

I can&#x27;t prove it, but I am almost 100% convinced that counting the
full cycles is the only way.

I also tried something like looking at each piece in terms of BLD
cubing orientation.

That reason this doesn&#x27;t work is that you can switch two pieces that
are oriented the same way using the parity alg + center rotater (so
quite literally only those two pieces switch) and they both appear to
be oriented.

For every orientation case you invesitate, switching exactly two edges
and still having it look the same way in terms of orientation is
possible.  So this method cannot identify parity in all cases.

I think counting cycles, with a year or two of practice, could be done
in the 15 second inspection maybe as much as 75% of the time.  The
problem is you would not have a good plan for starting your solve. 
The solve itself would start very nearly like a no-inspection solve. 
Plus, 25% of the time you would be very near completing the cycles
counting right as the judge says &quot;put your cube down&quot;.  This can&#x27;t be
good for a concentration zone or solving rhythm.

My next goal, and Ron I&#x27;ve already mentioned this to you, is to use a
&quot;one parity method&quot;.  After using ZBLL for a while I came to realize
that 5/6 of the COLL cases can be viewed as having switched only two
corners (which is odd parity if you consider the F2L solved and the LL
face turned correctly).  So what I want to do is to memorize for each
COLL case exactly which two corners are swapped (I already know this
for the COLL cases I know for ZBLL, I just need to learn it for the rest).

So 5/6 of the time I will have &quot;odd parity&quot;, maybe not really but from
my viewpoint of considering the corners I will.  Then I look at the
edge permtutation in relation to the two &quot;solved&quot; corners and see if
it is also odd.

I like this because 5/6 of the time I check for odd permutation of
edges.  The 1/6 is even becase that is the only case where the corners
are fully solved (permutation) in relation to eachother.  So I just
memorize the 1/6 cases that are even and in those cases check for even
edge permutation.

I can do it now already but it is very slow.  However, I believe it
will speed up the method a small amount when fully practiced and here
is why:

Let&#x27;s consider just the scenario where you have OLL parity, the no OLL
parity situation is exactly the same for the &quot;one parity&quot; method or
whatever you want to call it.

Regular solving:
(1/2)*(15) + (1/2)*(15 + 8) = 19

So it takes 19 moves on average to solve the OLL parity case with the
regular method.  This includes 1/2 the time just the OLL parity and
1/2 the time also the PLL parity using Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s 8 move fixer.

One-parity solving:
(1/2)*(15) + (1/2)*(15) = 15

so you save 4 moves on average.

Here is my idea on how it affects the time too:

Regular solving:
(1/2)*(5.25+2.75) + (1/2)*(5.25) = 6.63 seconds to solve parities on
average

One-parity solving:
(1/2)*(5.25) + (1/2)*(4.75) = 5.00 seconds

So you have up to 1.63 seconds to identify double parity without it
affecting your average at all.  If you spend 1.63 seconds every OLL
parity solve just staring at your cube and not doing any turns, as
long as you can always correctly guess double parity or not, then you
will break even with one parity over executing 2 parity algs 1/4 your
solves.

This time difference only gets better the faster you can execute the
double parity alg.

So it won&#x27;t save much time, but it saves time.  And at top level
solving for any puzzle any amount of time saved is good.  Also, on the
rare easy cases where you can identify double parity in .5 seconds you
will save up to 3 seconds off that solve.  That&#x27;s a full second in a
competition mean that comes off your times.

So it&#x27;s a lot of work, for very little gain.  But it&#x27;s gain
nonetheless so I think it will be worth it to learn.  Plus it&#x27;s
something that ZBLL would teach you anyway, so I might as well learn
it now and be comfortable knowing the structure of my ZBLL algs even
more, having already memorized the corner structure of each one.

In short I want to learn it, but I realize that it is a lot of work
for very little gain.

I feel the cycles counting method is worse though in terms of lots of
work for a disproportional amount of gain.  But then again it would be
a gain, so maybe it is worth it, who knows?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

There&#x27;s a point in the solve where I can tell edge parity. So that you
might picture it, generally it follows my 3x3x3 solving method.

Solve:
1 two opposing centers (for reference call them left and right centers) 
2 pair up four specific edge pairs (comprising the middle level)
3 place two middle level edge pairs
4 place four FL corners (on the bottom)
5 place the other two middle level edge pairs
6 pair up two specific edge pairs (DL and DR)

Although some of what remains may be solved, this usually leaves me
with the following still scrambled:
1 Four centers in a line Down, Front, Up and Back
2 Six edge pairs DF UF UB DB UL and UR
3 Last Level corners 

At this point you can learn to see if you have and edge parity
problem, and if you do turn r or l one quarter turn, then solve the
rest with an even number of half turns.

Have lots of fun,

David J

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really necessary to memorize F2L algorithms. Once
you know how to position a corner and its corresponding edge in order
to place them in the first two layers, you can figure out how to
reduce almost any other case to this position. Just play around with
it for a while, and you&#x27;ll end up knowing it without actually
memorizing algorithms. The only F2L algorithms I actually memorized
are the ones for cases that aren&#x27;t quite so intuitive.

As for looking ahead, just keep practicing. Eventually you&#x27;ll start
doing your F2L moves without really thinking about them, and you can
use that time to start looking for the next F2L pair. I&#x27;ve dropped my
cubing average from over a minute to low 30s without really learning
any new algorithms.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I can&#x27;t prove it, but I am almost 100% convinced that counting the<br>
&gt; full cycles is the only way.<br>
<br>
Hi, I think it is not necessary counting the full cycles with the 24 <br>
cubies, but we can calculate a combination between the cycle for the <br>
12 pairs and the orientation for each 12 pairs separatly.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s the method:<br>
<br>
Definition :<br>
Current Pair : Any combinations of two edges cubies.<br>
FirstEdge and SecondEdge are two edges cubies whith the two same <br>
colors.<br>
MyCounter values 0.<br>
<br>
I take one pair.<br>
It&#x27;s my Current Pair.<br>
I add 1 to MyCounter.<br>
<br>
The left part of my Current Pair is my First Edge.<br>
The pair where my Second Edge is becomes the Current Pair.<br>
<br>
If the Second Edge is good oriented (according blindfold), I add 1 <br>
to my counter, else I add nothing.<br>
<br>
The left part of my Current Pair is my First Edge.<br>
The pair where my Second Edge is becomes the current pair.<br>
<br>
If the Second Edge is good oriented (according blindfold), I add 1 <br>
to my counter, else I add nothing.<br>
<br>
I do this until my Second Edge is on the first pair I choose at the <br>
beginning.<br>
<br>
The first pair must be twice the current pair. <br>
<br>
When I finish one cycle, I choose for current pair one pair i have <br>
not seen yet.ETC.....<br>
<br>
Until the 12 pairs have been seen.<br>
<br>
One example:<br>
<br>
On a boy color sheme up/yellow face/blue.<br>
I do an &quot;f&quot; and a b2 move and I flip the UL and UR edges( as we do <br>
when we have 2 edges flipped in a blindfold resolution) . The <br>
parity/signature will be odd.<br>
<br>
I take the UR pair. the left part is yellow/orange.<br>
I add one to my counter , it values 1.<br>
<br>
The other yellow/orange is on the UL pair and good oriented . I add <br>
1 to my counter = 2.<br>
The other UL edge is White/red.<br>
<br>
The other white/red is on the DL pair and not good oriented . I add <br>
nothing and my counter = 2.<br>
The other DL edge is Yellow/red.<br>
<br>
The other yellow/red is on the DR pair and not good oriented . I add <br>
nothing and my counter = 2.<br>
The other DR edge is Yellow/orange.<br>
<br>
The other yellow/orange is on the UR pair and good oriented . I add <br>
1 and my counter = 3.<br>
<br>
My counter = 3 , so the parity is odd.<br>
<br>
Do this with all cycles if they are more cycle.<br>
Don&#x27;t forget the pair already &quot;good paired&quot; and add 1 if it is not <br>
good oriented.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s suppose the cube solved with only the UL pair flipped.<br>
<br>
I take this pair UL and add 1.<br>
The left part is yellow/red. the other yellow/red is on UL pair and <br>
not good oriented. I add nothing. The cycle is finish. the parity is <br>
odd.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

Like commented before, will this really save any time for a complete 
solve? Even if one determines the parity from the give scramble one 
must keep track of it from the outset if one wants to utilise the 
information. This means while doing the centers and also while 
pairing up the edges. Those clever tricks to track/eliminate the 
parity will slow down the solve, i guess more than simply solving 
normally and deal with it at the 3x3x3 stage. Well, that is my firm 
belief anyway. Those who want to prove me wrong, please do so :-) I 
know Chris Hardwick, Ron and yo Frederick at least are interested in 
it.

My idea to deal w parity is to change my own cage method so that i 
would solve complete first layer then opposite layer. Then middle 
layers edges (with trivial inner layer quarter-turn parity fix) and 
no equivalent to the permutation parity of the pairing-up method. 
Then finally do the rest of the centers. One could also use 
empty &quot;dedge&quot;s on those first 2 layers while solving the middle 
layers edges. Im sure it can be fast, but a bit unusual :-) As for 
doing the last 4 centers im sure it can be fast. Once u reach the 
state where all unsolved centers are on opposite faces u need 
maximum 2 algs and u are done :-) And those algs are short. For the 
5x5x5 cube im not really that convinced that this new approach will 
be more efficient than my current approach (or the pairing-up).

Cheers!

Hey now.  It&#x27;s not weird to do it that way.  The only difference
between my method and the one you described is that I leave out 1 edge
group from each face, essentially turning my sovle into a Roux solve.

The parity fix is easy to spot and takes 13 moves to fix.
lU2l&#x27;U2lU2l&#x27;U2rU2rU2r&#x27; (U2).  It shuffles also 3 blocks of centers in
the M slice, as well as swapping the UB and DB edge pairs.

I played around a lot with counting edges and things and eventually
realized that discounting extremely special cases, it&#x27;s quicker to
just move on and finish the edge pairing, and use the parity fixer if
it comes up.  This saves time on solves without parity, and loses only
a trivial amount of time on the solves with parity.

Are u pairing up the middle layer &quot;dedge&quot;s or what. No need for such 
a lenghty parity-fixer otherwise. U fix the parity simply with 
l/l&#x27;/r/r&#x27;. Either will do. Doing one middle layer&#x27;s edges first 
makes it really trivial to see the parity (parity-fix = bringing the 
remaining 4 edges into an even cycle configuration). Instead of 
doing an inner slice turn l/l&#x27;/r/r&#x27; it&#x27;s possible to simply do : U2 
(p&#x27; U2)*5 where p is l/l&#x27;/r/r&#x27;. This will preserve the centers and 
makes even a centers first approach possible when doing middle 
laters edges last.

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Frédérick,

I actually tried something very similar to this over my Christmas
break in 2004.  I was able to get to around 25 seconds as a personal
fastest time, but I averaged around 40-50 seconds to do this.

Having one or more transpositions (cycles between two edge groups
only) slows me down terribly.

I personally was not able to get this method under 15 seconds to
identify parity.  If you find a way to speed it up I would love to
hear how to do it.  I gave up on this idea though, but of course maybe
you have found some really nice modification to it as well.

The advantage of doing it this way is that you can pair up the first 3
edge groups of the 6 left with just r/l turns and U. And finish the
rest by pairing the UBl with the DFl edge and UBr with DFr just by
doing rU2r&#x27;. The whole edge pairing scenario is very simple,
intuitive, and best of all, fast.

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an easy way out and like Per I don&#x27;t think it 
would be worth it anyway unless maybe you can really see it in 5-10 
seconds.

Some in my opinion more realistic time-savers dealing with the 
parities in a centers>edges>3x3 method:

- Do CLL->ELL, solving both parities as part of ELL. It&#x27;s an easy 
2-look LL.

- Recognize and fix orientation parity before solving the last F2L 
pair. Chris should already be able to recognize it since he&#x27;s doing 
ZBF2L and it&#x27;s not hard to learn anyway. Now we just need a fast alg 
that exploits the unsolved slot. Should be shorter/faster than what we 
have so far.

- While pairing up dedges, don&#x27;t flip built dedges anymore (optimally 
don&#x27;t change them at all) and count flipped dedges. Then you could fix 
the parity before starting the 3x3 step. An even shorter/faster alg 
should exist.

Cheers!
Stefan

I had two books at the time, and they both must have been out in
England before the summer of 1981 because we moved house then and I&#x27;d
already had them by then. One of them must have been &#x27;You Can Do The
Cube&#x27; because that kid&#x27;s face is so familiar, although I don&#x27;t
recoginise the cover - maybe an earlier edition had a different cover??

The other one may have been &#x27;Mastering Rubik&#x27;s Cube&#x27; by Don Taylor,
because the cover looks familiar. Or it also may have been &#x27;SIMPLE
SOLUTION TO RUBIK&#x27;S CUBE&#x27; by JAMES NOURSE - also looking familiar.

What I do remember is having an argument in the playground with this
other kid who could do the cube (we were the only two in the whole
school) He said I was cheating because I didn&#x27;t turn the cube upside
down to finish the bottom layer??? Maybe this gives a clue about the
different methods we were using. For about a month we stood in the
yard doing cube after cube after cube for all the kids who had them
(everyone in 80/81 whenever it was). My record was 59 seconds - which
hilariously enough was just counted out loud by my brother without any
kind of watch or timing device. Very scientific :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

Could Chris/Per/Stefan please explain why they think there cannot be a method other than counting cycles?
I would love to see a proof! Or better, I would love to see a proof of a better method. :-)

Yesterday I found a counter example of my factor 4 hypothesis: just swap the edge cubies UrF and URb. You have 0 flipped edge pieces, but you do have parity.
When I started this solve the total number of flipped edge pieces was 14 (=parity, which was the indeed the case), so somewhere in the solve it changed to a factor of 4.

CLL=>ELL is indeed an interesting approach. :-)

Orientation parity during F2L was an idea I already had, and I asked Jaap to find an algorithm for it, using his program. At the moment he is still on tour in Florida. :-)

Stefan, I don&#x27;t understand what you mean with your idea about dedges.

Doing both parities in one is interesting. At the moment I use two algorithms (the normal one by Chris, and the double parity one by Frédérick), but both twist corners because I use multislice moves. It would be great to have a fast algorithm that does not twist corners... It would be great to have a fast algorithm for the orientation parity anyhow. Yuki can do the parity algorithm amazingly fast. I need to train for that. :-)

Is it true that once you solved 3 centers, you cannot change parity anymore when you keep these centers intact? Because then the center positions are fixed?
In that case you only have to count the parity during the first three centers. Which is not a big task.

Thanks and have fun,

Ron

  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an easy way out and like Per I don&#x27;t think it 
  would be worth it anyway unless maybe you can really see it in 5-10 
  seconds.

  Some in my opinion more realistic time-savers dealing with the 
  parities in a centers>edges>3x3 method:

  - Do CLL->ELL, solving both parities as part of ELL. It&#x27;s an easy 
  2-look LL.

  - Recognize and fix orientation parity before solving the last F2L 
  pair. Chris should already be able to recognize it since he&#x27;s doing 
  ZBF2L and it&#x27;s not hard to learn anyway. Now we just need a fast alg 
  that exploits the unsolved slot. Should be shorter/faster than what we 
  have so far.

  - While pairing up dedges, don&#x27;t flip built dedges anymore (optimally 
  don&#x27;t change them at all) and count flipped dedges. Then you could fix 
  the parity before starting the 3x3 step. An even shorter/faster alg 
  should exist.

  Cheers!
  Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Im not saying there isn&#x27;t a way to see parity other than counting 
cycles. All i was saying is that im quite sure it wouldn&#x27;t be worth 
the effort. In general im also sceptical about most kinds of 
tricks/anticipation to avoid &quot;hard cases&quot; later on. For that reason 
im also sceptical whether the ZB-method in one form or another can 
really be faster than pure Fridrich/CFOP. I don&#x27;t think anyone has 
proven yet, timewise, the advantages of a more complex method than 
pure CFOP. Of course there are the occasional really fast solves 
with it, but i haven&#x27;t seen averages with pure ZB/VH or similar that 
compare with the fastest pure CFOP averages. This could of course be 
simply because only a few people are really into zb, and also that 
so far they only master a part of it :-)

I&#x27;m only happy to be proven wrong :-)

It would be great to have a fast algorithm that does not twist 
corners... It would be great to have a fast algorithm for the 
orientation parity anyhow. Yuki can do the parity algorithm 
amazingly fast. I need to train for that. :-)

          <div class="email-content">Well, if you want to solve the edges while solving the last pair for
the F2L, you&#x27;d have a lot more cases than the &quot;basic&quot; ZB-F2L.
But, in the other hand, you&#x27;d have considerably less alg for finishing
the LL because you&#x27;d only have to solve the corners, which is only the
COLL.

That would require a more mathematical approach, but your idea might
not be meaningless ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

You don&#x27;t need to count the 24 cycles, I had forgotten about the 12
cycle counting method that Frederick mentioned.  That can absolutely
detect parity every time.  I personally still found it very difficult,
it is a puzzle all by itself.  Using it would be like solving two
puzzles at once on stage.  You have 15 seconds to frantically (and yes
to get to even 25 seconds I had to frantically twist my cube around)
discover parity, which I believe couldn&#x27;t be done 100% of the time
(who can solve the 3x3x3 in under 15 seconds 100% of the time?).  But
on the times you do discover it, with training, I think tracking the
parity during the solve would not slow you down much at all.  Any
double turn does not change parity, and I had learned how specific
sequences I use affected parity so I didn&#x27;t have to count every move.

I personally think that noticing parity early, say whether or not the
zbf2l case is parity or not would work.  You don&#x27;t have to know ZBF2L,
but you could learn to recognize it, and all the patterns are the same
so it wouldn&#x27;t take much work.

Also, something I found interesting while doing some 4x4 math before
the tournament.

Sometimes the regular parity alg is very fast for me, but sometimes
the double is fast for me.  So I would like to use both but still want
50-50 odds of double parity and not more.  Well call the frequency
that you use the regular parity x (0&lt;=x&lt;=1) and call the frequency
that you use the double parity alg (1-x)

the number of moves on average that it takes you to correct parities
this way is

(1/2)*(15x+23(1-x)) + (1/2)*(23x+15(1-x))
(1/2)*[-8x+23 + 8x +15]
19

So no matter the frequency you switch between the algs, you average 19
moves to solve parities.  That is the same as always using the same
alg.  This works since they are the same number of moves in length.

Also about the centers, when I was practicing solves when I knew the
parity, I would forget about the parity after the 4th center (but I
solve the 3rd and 4th simultaneously always).  They way I put them
together I would correct parity if I needed to just before putting
those 2 centers together.  THe 5th and 6th solve using only conjugates
which don&#x27;t change parity.

If you do solve 3 centers, and correct parity to even while doing so,
then you can only solve in conjugates to finish the last 3, but yes
parity wouldn&#x27;t change after that.

I personaly am very skeptical of the usefulness of coutning cycles,
even with the 12 cycle method, since for me it was so terribly
difficult to try to even get sub-30 seconds.  I think noticing during
the solve might work better personalyl, but I am open to learning
newer or better ways to detect during inspection.

Also what about doing what I saw someone mention in an earlier post,
why not do the OLL when you have OLL parity such that you end with one
flipped edge only.  At this point it would be very easy to discover if
you also had PLL parity.  I&#x27;m sure if we had faster algs to flip just
that one edge to either solve OLL or OLL and PLL parity then this
method would save time.

I average about 6 seconds to do OLL parity with inner slices and maybe
6-7 right now with OLL + PLL aprity alg using just inner slices.  If
we can make this fast, then why not try that route also?  We would
need better algs for inner slice only though in my opinion.  Can we
get somthing with lots of r and l&#x27; moves?  You could perform those
like Bob and I do M&#x27; for the H permutation?

It would be great to have a fast algorithm for the orientation parity
anyhow. Yuki can do the parity algorithm amazingly fast. I need to
train for that. :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

One last thing, I didn&#x27;t address your one question.  I think some sort
of cycle-ish strategy will be required, since you can switch two edge
pieces literally without affecting anything else, not even centers.

That seems like it would be very hard to detect in any type of
orientation method for finding parity.  Two edges can be switched that
were both oriented that would still appear to be oriented.

Just the sheer complexity of it seems to have to require at least the
12 cycle counting method.  Again I have no idea how to prove that, but
it seems like some sort of cycling has to be done.

Just my hunch though :-(

I meant that while you pair up the dedges, you count how many are 
oriented wrong, just like you&#x27;d count how many are wrong for 3x3 
blindsolving. Somehow you&#x27;d need to take care that the dedges you&#x27;ve 
built and counted don&#x27;t get flipped while building the remaining 
dedges.

How about doing OLL + OrientationParity in one go? Chris already shows 
some setup moves for the parity fixer on his webpage. With a few more 
algs and more setup moves doing OLL including parity fix in one go 
seems not too bad to me.

Oh, and try this alg (Frederick&#x27;s alg with setup move) for just 
flipping one edge and swapping two corners:

R&#x27; (Rr)2 B2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 B2 (Rr)&#x27; B2 (Rr) B2 (Rr)&#x27; B2 (Rr)2 B2 U2 
R

Cheers!

I will try your idea about dedges.
Yeah, I use that algorithm! Do you happen to know a similar algorithm (without inner slice moves) for the other orientation parity algorithm that preserves the corner twists and doesn&#x27;t solve the permutation parity?

We need a good 4x4 solver! Even with ACube4 I cannot find the algorithms. :-(
ACube4 works well for other stuff.

Have fun,

Ron

For example, look at the third case Chris describes here:
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4speedsolve32.html

Now try this on a scrambled cube:
B&#x27; R&#x27; (Chris&#x27;s orientation parity fixer) R B

Saves four moves compared to Chris&#x27;s suggestion :-)

Btw I&#x27;d execute it a bit differently (I like pulling U2 with left 
index+middle fingers):

x&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; (Rr)2 U2 x U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr) U2 x U2 (Rr) U2 (Ll)&#x27; D2 
(Ll)2 R U x

Hi Ron,

ACube4? Where do I get that?

How about this alg in three steps:

1. (Rrl&#x27;) R&#x27; F (Llr&#x27;) y
2. Chris&#x27;s orientation fixer
3. y&#x27; (Llr&#x27;)&#x27; F&#x27; R (Rrl&#x27;)&#x27;

I know, I know... quite long... only my first idea that worked.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I haven&#x27;t read all the messages about the subject but I will give you
my thought about the parity problems. I think that the easiest way to
deal with them if to solve the cube until you arrive at the OLL. If
the OLL exist, just do it and then if the PLL exist do it, or if it
doesn&#x27;t exist do the parity problem( for PLL) and do the PLL. On the
case where the OLL doesnt exist you orient all exept one edge. Then
you look if the PLL exist or not. If it does, do the parity problem
(for OLL) and finish by the PLL. If the PLL doesn&#x27;t exist do the arity
problem (which fix both parity problem) and end with the PLL.

I think this is not too difficult after some practice and you always
do one algs for parity or zero. The only think wghich is not very good
if that you have to do the parity algs with the inner slices which is
a little slower. 

What do yiou think of that?

  Yes, I know those are the figures listed on Zbigniew&#x27;s site and I think they are wrong. Since 
the total of the first column adds up to 300, the figures he lists should include the solved 
cases, so the figure for the LL should be 494.

was a sale (orig. $10), but these cubes are really bad! <br>
They&#x27;re the 25th anniversary type, with the shiny white stickers. I&#x27;m<br>
really frustrated, as I&#x27;ve actually slid playing cards into all the<br>
slots and kept them there for a couple hours, and now I&#x27;m putting<br>
cards to try stretching the springs too. If doing this, then lubing<br>
the cube (for a 2nd time) doesn&#x27;t work out (so far, it&#x27;s better, but<br>
not much), then I&#x27;m just gonna return the other one.<br>
Do cubes of the same brand and type vary in quality, or are all of the<br>
25th anniversary ones poor like this? I ask because the first cube I<br>
bought was $14, and it was also a 25th anniversary edition, but the<br>
white face was not shiny, it was pure white. I gotta say, it was also<br>
about 100 times better for speedcubing, all I had to do was apply<br>
silicone spray, and it was a bona fide speedcube.<br>
I actually found a site online where they sell that exact same type<br>
(the good one). Should I buy that kind exclusively? Or is there any<br>
other type that&#x27;s even better for speedcubing? It&#x27;s just frustrating<br>

          <div class="email-content">all those cubes vary in quality.. some are looser, some are tighter, 
some have more even spring tension some don&#x27;t. but cubes usually 
take time to break in and get looser.. to get into the speedcubing 
condition.. say several weeks of intensive cubing.. if not a few 
months..

program:

&quot;What operating system is he running?  I would recommend downloading 
and installing the latest Java SDK which is much bigger then the JRE 
and allows him to compile and run the program on his own machine.  
Then he should download and install the cube program again.  If he 
still has problems, I can help further.&quot;

Hope that helps.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sure you answered the question I was asking, and I probably
wasn&#x27;t clear about it. What I was trying to say was, say I take the
exact brand, say, the Oddzon Rubik&#x27;s cube. Then say out of 100 of that
exact cube, would the quality be the same (low) quality among all 100,
or would there be some great ones, some okay ones, and some bad ones
among them? I want to know if within one specific type, the quality
varies. Or if we know that overall, all Oddzon cubes are bad and all
Studio cubes are good.

          <div class="email-content">You&#x27;re not alone.  I have had very bad luck with all the cubes 
commonly available on the market today.  To my knowledge, there are 
four:
1) 25th AV with white stickers, hexagon package
2) 25th AV with white stickers, on card
3) 25th AV with silver stickers, on card
4) a few leftover Oddzon cubes with a non-anniversary sticker.

Of the first three, I have bought and bought and bought.  Only about 
1/4 of the ones I buy are acceptable for speedcubing with minimal 
preparation.  The other 3/4 are so tight and uneven that I give up 
any hope of breaking them in.  So no, I do not find that any one of 
the three is any better on average than the others.

I have a small sample size on #4 (one cube) but it was so tight I 
could barely turn it.  You&#x27;d think silicone would save the day, but 
it made it even WORSE.

I&#x27;ve heard at least two posters say that if you are willing to work 
with tight cubes for long enough, eventually they will get looser.  
As for me, I try to find a store with a liberal return policy, 
because I can&#x27;t wait that long!

          <div class="email-content">Agreed =) DIY cubes are nice as well. eventually, these pre-
assembled cubes will get too loose and pop too much.. but i think 
DIY cubes will give you more flexibility in adjusting the 
tightness.. =) but i&#x27;m not sure, since i haven&#x27;t used one before.. i 
still have one waiting to be assembled =X

I personally think that the tighter cubes are better when compared 
to the loose ones.. i had one with a blue side that was just hanging 
loose (when i took it apart, the blue center piece had no tension).. 
can&#x27;t speedcube with it.. the blue side would overturn! poor 
manufacturing process!

anyway.. i think those tighter ones are nice cuz they give that &quot;new 
cube&quot; feeling =D as long as the spring tension is even, and it&#x27;s not 
unbearably tight.. it gives me the feeling they&#x27;ll last longer haha

but yeah, they should be the same.. although the studio cubes are 
supposed to be superb.. they&#x27;re supposed to have proper tension etc. 
and you can adjust it.. but i can&#x27;t really say cuz i&#x27;ve never used 
one before

          <div class="email-content">Oh, and from my observations.. it seems that they keep degrading in 
quality! As the newer ones come out, the quality is worse and 
worse.. My pre-anniversary edition cube is great... it has flat 
centers... but you can tell-the plastic is sturdier, thicker.. more 
even surfaces.. the corners don&#x27;t have the stupid caps that let 
water leak in--they&#x27;re visible but sealed.. horrible.. the old ones 
are much better... the white anniversary ones had the problems 
described above.. and the silver ones.. GOSH, what the hell?! the 
center pieces are like.. chipped where the caps are! maybe it&#x27;s just 
mine though. and the plastic is much thinner! you cheapos! stop 
degrading in quality =(

That can&#x27;t be right, according to this nice website &quot;Speed-cubing

Yes, that was an important milestone for me. At sub-40 I realized I 
was addicted and I would never stop cubing completely. Before, it was 
still an option.
When I look at this other nice website, it seems that others never 
had the choice:

...and has anyone tried using a /mild/ abrasive, such as tooth powder --
 assuming you can still get that product?  I think someone (skeneegee,

Man, I&#x27;m so jealous, I&#x27;ve got my roux method average down to lower
than my petrus now, I just need to concentrate on just pushing it
under sub-30 a bit. My biggest flaw is the first two 1x2x3&#x27;s which
take on average 18-20 seconds for me. I think for the last corner-edge
pair I&#x27;m going to have to learn some F2L-style algs. Doing it
intinuitivly takes too long.

I&#x27;m begging for more Roux method resources! :D The sites are all
flooded with fridrich. Could also do with some tips from the pro&#x27;s :)

I also noticed Gilles, speedcubing tend to start at a faster time for
eveyone whenever you yourself get faster at it :)

Well, he surely improved when he got older...
Is there an easy-to-use online chess page where we could try it?

Cheers!
Stefan

There are some, but I don´t like them; in order to encrease the speed for a reply (in blitz) you have to learn how to manipulate the knobs on the keyboard, which more reminds on cubing than on chess. Blitz should be played with heavy, wooden pieces, where halv the victory is won by looking the opponent in his eys as saying: you are a fool! 
Moreover, I havn´t yet got my broad band and staying on line is too expensive for a poor man.
Are my excuses too transparent?

Looks like Chris needs to take a break from cubing. :D

And about the original question, i dont think anyone should have a
problem with stepping in a parallel universe. Just find the universe
in which you are the winner and ur done. But if everyone starts doing
that then the WCA will have to keep many trophies handy. :)

I know someone who wrote a paper on the effect of the shape of the universe on the limits 
of computation, but I don&#x27;t recall the details too well. In particular, certain shapes allow for 
an infinite computation to be done in finite time (from the point of view of the observer) so 
that for instance problems like the Goldbach Conjecture could be proven (even if true) by 
thrashing them out, one case at a time. Conceivably this could be used to solve the cube 
quickly. In the infinite context (which I assume is countably infinite), the energy in the 
signal sent back by the slave would kill the master as it arrived so he&#x27;d only know the 
answer instantaneously but the cube is a finite problem so maybe this would be a 
theoretical method to get an optimal solution back and hence solve the cube in a really 
short time with only partial damage to the solver! Probably not too practicable.

Grinding solves are when you solve the cube normally, but pressing
inward very hard on all of the faces as you turn them.  Basically, you
want each bit of the cube that rotates against another part to wear as
much as possible in its natural pattern.

Does that also mean we could finally solve any cube by pure random 
twisting in finite time with probability 1?

finger shortcuts for the PLL&#x27;s...my slowest ones take about 7 seconds.

I almost broke 30 with my 3LLL yesterday.  Because my old color 
scheme and cross-on-top are so ingrained in my head, I&#x27;ve resigned 
myself to a compromise: I can keep the old color scheme, but I have 
to keep the cross kinda &#x27;bottom-lefty&#x27; as much as possible.  So far, 
it&#x27;s working beautifully.

          <div class="email-content">For those of you familiar with Myers-Briggs type - what personality <br>
types do you think would be most drawn to speedcubing?  My guess is <br>
that the prototypical cuber would be ISTP or INTP.  I think it would be <br>
harder for an F or J to learn cubing, because I&#x27;d think being able to <br>
analyze and adapt are primo considerations.  I&#x27;m also thinking S&#x27;s <br>
would be more interested in speed per se, whereas N&#x27;s would be more <br>
interested in the mathematics of the cube and the like.<br>
<br>
In my adult life I seem to have &#x27;gelled&#x27; as an ISTP.  I was ISFP but <br>
after working in the business world for about 5 years, I got all <br>
hard &#x27;n&#x27; crusty. :P<br>

          <div class="email-content">Actually, just the other day I found out they have full-blown world
championships for RPS.  Check out www.worldrps.com for some stuff
about strategies and whatnot.

At first, I was like &quot;RPS?  That&#x27;s pretty wacky!&quot;  Then I realized
that we all solve rubik&#x27;s cubes as fast as we can, which outsiders
view as crazy as RPS.  I think it would be kinda cool if cubers
started getting into RPS like they do cupstacking.

Congrats Craig for winning the competition!

          <div class="email-content">Interesting!  I would not have expected J&#x27;s to be as common as they 
appear to be at this point.

Quick primer: basically the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) 
divides personality types into 4 &quot;one or the other&quot; scales, for a 
total of 16 combinations:

* I (introvert) vs. E (extravert): pretty self-explanatory.

* S (sensing) vs. N (intuition): Sensors are more concrete and detail-
oriented; iNtuitives are more big-picture oriented.

* T (thinking) vs. F (feeling): Thinkers tend to be more objective, 
Feelers more subjective.  Basically are you more of a head person or 
a heart person.

* J (judging) vs. P (perceiving): Has nothing to do with being 
judgmental or perceptive.  Judgers tend to be better with structure 
and schedules; Perceivers tend to be better with the lack thereof.

So maybe the N means you&#x27;re better at seeing the whole cube as a 
whole, and the J is great for the structured logic of the cube and 
planning ahead.  As an S, too often I&#x27;m thinking, &quot;oh cool!  that 
square is orange!&quot; and as a P: &quot;I think I&#x27;ll do this next.  No, how 
about this.  No, that...wait, what was I doing??&quot;

INTJ&#x27;s often make great scientists, so it looks like the cube is 
right up their alley.  See if this description fits you:

          <div class="email-content">Well congrats Craig, but i still think that RPS is more of luck than
anything else.

Ofcourse if you do some psychologic studies or something and try to
figure out what the other person is going to give maybe that can work,
but that is too far fetched.

And about the world chapms i think its totally silly. It can in no way
be compared to our cubing champs. After all the amout of luck involved
in ours is much much less than for the RPS type.

And Craig dont let out whats ur favourite, maybe someone at your
schoolo maybe reading this and you&#x27;l be dethroned of your championship
status in the next comp :)

 INFP type of personality.

Could anyone tell me what excatly this means? I got a slight idea that
it says im 13rd introvert, quite a bit intutive, lil feelings and
again quite perceving. I think maybe thats right for me.

Btw i&#x27;ve noticed all the posts above me do contain some amount of
introversy. So does that mean we all cubers are introverts to a large
extent?

Hmm...I read a few of the types on the page. So far, it seems that I fit a
little bit of each that I&#x27;ve read. I guess it&#x27;s supposed to be like that
though, I just fit the most in INTJ.

This is pretty interesting. I&#x27;ll read about the rest of the other types once
I have more time - I have a bio lab due tomorrow that I&#x27;ve been postponing
all day.

agree that N&#x27;s are more likely to be interested in the maths side (than S&#x27;s 
are!) but doesn&#x27;t stop us being competitive!  I think J&#x27;s tend to be more 
thoughtful and since a lot of cubing is in the preparation I don&#x27;t see why 
there should be any particular preference for P or J.  The most obvious 
preferenve would be a T over an F I suppose.  I&#x27;me quite evenly balanced on 
these but always come out with a slight F preference.

Emne: Re: [Speed cubing group] I&#x27;m the competitive type...



Hmm...how exactly do you get good at rock paper scissors? I&#x27;ve heard
there
are people who are really good at it (I guess like you) but I&#x27;m still
confined to the luck idea. I&#x27;d definitely like to know if there is some
kind
of strategy behind it. (Oh, and I do find small games fun. :-))

Two questions:

- How many people competed?
- Was that your first attempt or did you participate in earlier 
competitions?

They call me INFJ... wonder why they even mention that
tiny 1% judging :-)

44% Introverted
25% Intuitive
38% Feeling
1% Judging

Stefan - First competition 32 people, I think 6 rounds...

Other people (sorry can&#x27;t remember the name) - I don&#x27;t have a
favourite...I study my opponents.  My first round opponent, a guy in
my class who has been a rival of mine for about 5 years, I tricked
into thinking I go paper every time, and then I went rock on his
scissors...Destroyed him...There is some lucky, and noticing people&#x27;s
patterns or what they are going to throw.  It is also knowing the
person...

Emne: [Speed cubing group] Re: (what&#x27;s yer type) Personality types



Just took that test...question 40 made me stop and think and I figured
it would make or break the answers...but anyways...

I am  ENFP
E        N       F       P
78      62      12      33

# very expressed extrovert
# distinctively expressed intuitive personality
# slightly expressed feeling personality
# moderately expressed perceiving personality

Anyone know what that is trying to tell me??? Am I not meant to be a
cuber???

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody,<br>
<br>
I was just reading some stuff about commutators, and I found an<br>
interesting one (not by myself, I found it in a document):<br>
<br>
RBLF U F&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27; U&#x27;  <br>
<br>
Maybe an interesting way for beginners to insert a middle layer<br>
edge... Easy to remember :).<br>
<br>
Anyway, the question is about how to explain why this commutator<br>
works. In the document, there was a defenition, the support of P,<br>
supp(P), is defined as the set of all pieces that are effected by<br>
algorithm P. The proposition was, if the overlap of supp(P) and<br>
supp(Q) is only 1 piece, than PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; will be a three cycle. Now I<br>
understand why this works for P = R&#x27;D2R and Q = U. But I can&#x27;t see why<br>
this is a way to explain the <br>
RBLF U F&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27; U&#x27; three cycle :(. To me, it looks like RBLF effects<br>
the whole cube... Can anyone please explain this to me? Maybe I got<br>
the defenition of SUPP(P) wrong, or something :(...<br>
<br>
Tnx,<br>
<br>
Joel.<br>

Me, too, but just barely thinking -- which may be appropriate in my 
case ;)

Introverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiving

Shouldn&#x27;t a reputable pseudoscientist provide error estimates for these 
(ahem) quantitative findings?

It might not even out: it is a very short test, with a lot of overlap 
between questions.  But perhaps consistency/inconsistency in one&#x27;s 
answers somehow contributes to one of the scores.  (Nah.)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been doing the 2x2x2 a bit lately and average around 6-7 seconds <br>
using Guimond. Now I&#x27;m seriously considering switching from my 4 LL-look <br>
Fridrich to a CF method. I&#x27;m mostly looking at a pure CF method so that <br>
I can practice the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 at the same time using my current <br>
corners system. What I&#x27;m now is asking for is some suggestions regarding <br>
solving the edges.<br>
<br>
So far my idea has been to finish two 1x2x3 blocks after the corners. <br>
This way I&#x27;ll be left with a classical CF/Roux ending which is nice.At <br>
the moment though I&#x27;m solving the 6 edges for the two 1x2x3&#x27;s one by <br>
one, which takes a little over 20 moves and to much time on average. Any <br>
suggestions on how to lower the number of moves and steps here, without <br>
reaching a ZB number of algorithms?<br>
<br>
Any other tips/suggestions?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well to me also the cube looks scrambled after doing RBLF, but look
closely and u&#x27;ll see that on the top layer, all the corners are in
their original positions only, only their orientation is
affected...that too each one is rotated clockwise.

And since the middle move is a U, we dont care what the rest part of
the cube is like, since it&#x27;ll get arranged anyway.

So when you do a U move now, the top corners get rotated but since
their relative position and orientation is the same, they will get
arranged to their orig. config when u do the reverse moves F&quot;L&quot;B&quot;R&quot;.

The only thing remainin is the edges, those are the one which get
affected as we want.

Hope i could explain what i understood :)

his opponents will think he wants him to throw rock.  So to be on the

But if his opponent is smart, he should throw paper :-)

          <div class="email-content">Well, if my opponents choices were truly random, then my strategy
wouldn&#x27;t matter at all.  If I can detect a pattern in my opponents
choices, then I can try to predict what he will show and pick
something to beat him.  Alternatively, I could try to fool my opponent
by making choices that appear to have a pattern.  And just when I
think he has figured out the pattern and is about to counter
successfully, I could change the pattern to beat him.

Perhaps a good strategy for a tournament would be to memorize a &quot;one
time pad&quot;, or a sequence of truly random choices that no one knows
about.  If you used those choices in a tournament, no one could have
an advantage over you.  On the downside, you wouldn&#x27;t have an
advantage over anyone else, either.

          <div class="email-content">I thought the section about mental preferences was really interesting.
 The fact that rock is seen as more aggressive and paper as more passive.

Unless you were really good at reading your opponent, or knew their
history, I imagine it is mostly random chance, but maybe more like this:

rock 40%
scissors 36%
paper 24%

or something like that.  So maybe it isn&#x27;t 1/3 odds across the board,
but more weighted to your preferences to the throws under pressure.

O-o-oh... so you&#x27;re not just good at the cube, eh. ;)

Sorry, what game is that?  

Obviously you cannot second-guess /random/ coin flips, any more than 
you can second-guess a random RPS player.  (But remember that the 
random player won&#x27;t win an RPS tournament.)

Oh, I see what you mean.  Really, I don&#x27;t see that you can do better 
than to choose whichever has come up more frequently -- unless you 
suspect that the tosser (sorry to any speakers of British English) can 
control the outcome.

[Btw, if you spin coins on their edges, rather than tossing them, the 
results can be surprisingly strongly biased in one direction.]

          <div class="email-content">RPS is not random at all because it is two /people/ playing against one
another. In order to have competed in the RPS World Championship, you must
have competed in a smaller event. This makes it so that every competitor at
the world championship has past RPS data that other competitors can study.

I guess people really good at RPS memorize their competitor&#x27;s tendencies
instead of algorithms. Playing mind games is the key so that you can get
your opponent in their defensive state (which you studied before hand) and
control the game! :)

Hmmm... maybe I&#x27;m being hasty.  The tosser could /inadvertently/ 
control the outcome: e.g., HT and TH might occur more frequently than 
HH and TT (or vice versa), if the coin is picked up and tossed in 
almost the same way every time.  So maybe you&#x27;d have to look at those 
short-range correlations, even if the coin is &quot;fair&quot;.

But the same is true also of the computer programs -- as the results of 
the competitions showed.  That was the interesting thing about the 
programming task: to make a program able to exploit the weaknesses in 
an opponent&#x27;s strategy, as revealed by the way it played.

Let x be the common piece of the support.
Clearly for any piece z which is neither in supp(P) nor supp(Q), 
zPQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=zQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=zP&#x27;Q&#x27;=zQ&#x27;=z.
There is some piece y with yP=x and some piece t with xQ=t. Clearly 
y is in supp(P) and t is in supp(Q). 
Moreover, x, y and t are all distinct 
(if x=y then x is not in supp(P), if x=t then x is not in supp(Q) 
and it y=t then this piece is also in supp(P) and supp(Q) so it has 
more than one piece).
Note that yPQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=xQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=tP&#x27;Q&#x27;=tQ&#x27;=x (because t is not in supp(P)).
For any piece w in supp(P) other than y, wP is not x (and hence is 
not in supp(Q)). Thus wP=wPQ and so wPQP&#x27;=w, whence wPQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=w 
(unless w=x).
Thus PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; fixes all elements of supp(P) except y and x. (It can&#x27;t 
fix x, otherwise x=xPQP&#x27;Q&#x27;yPQP&#x27;Q&#x27; implies y=x.)
Let h=xP. Note h is in supp(P) and h isn&#x27;t x (lest x is fixed by P 
and x is not in supp(P)) so h is not in supp(Q) - i.e. hQ=h.
Thus xPQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=hQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=hP&#x27;Q&#x27;=xQ&#x27;=t.
t=xQ&#x27; is in supp(Q) (t=(xQ^k)Q for some k) but t isn&#x27;t x so t isn&#x27;t 
in supp(P), i.e. tP=t.
Thus tPQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=tQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=xQ&#x27;QP&#x27;Q&#x27;=xP&#x27;Q&#x27;=yQ&#x27;=y. Note tPQ=yQP=yP (as y is 
not in supp(Q))=x.
Now let s be any element of supp(Q) other than t and x.
Thus s is not in supp(P) and so sP=s.
Since s is not t, we have sPQ isn&#x27;t tPQ=x. Thus as sPQ is in supp(Q) 
but isn&#x27;t x it is not in supp(P) and sPQP&#x27;=sPQ, so that 
sPQP&#x27;Q&#x27;=sPQQ&#x27;=sP=s and s is fixed.
Thus PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; fixes all pieces other than t,x and y and further it 
moves y to x, x to t and t to y.
So PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; is a 3-cycle.

Even better, look what I just got:

You have won 14, lost 1, and tied 7 games 

Statistics for 22 games
winning percentage*: 59.09%
won : 63.64%

          <div class="email-content">The traditional answer would be that it depends on the way the 
program checks when a cube is solved. Like if it compares it to 
something designated solved then all you&#x27;d have to do is manually 
change that. However that would require going into the source code. 
Moreover, I&#x27;m thinking that you want to be able to change the goal 
state as an option as well.

Now thinking outside the box (or cube)... I&#x27;m going to apply a 
little bit of algbra here.

Call your starting state A. Then what a program does is find an 
optimal A^(-1). Say f(x) = x^(-1), but optimally so.

Then to get to the identity (solved state) you&#x27;d go A*f(A) = 1 
(where we are composing in our usual sence/direction... it&#x27;s 
actaully the other direction in most conventions, but then all our 
algs would have to be read backwards).

So now say we have a goal state B. Then f(B^(-1)*A) should do the 
trick.

Since A*f(B^(-1)*A) = A*A^(-1)*B = B (since inversion reverses 
order).

Thus I assert that all that needs to be done is to have a pre-parser 
that takes A and B and passes B^(-1)*A into the program.

This would then be a fairly routine cs exercise.

It makes sence right? Also this should work for greyed-out 
stickering possiblities as well.

Let start state algorithm A = R&#x27; F R B&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R B
Let goal state algorithm B = F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;

Then B^(-1)*A is:
F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; - R&#x27; F R B&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R B

A solution the program (ignoring permutation of
course, since Chris was interested in OLLs) might
find this: F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;

Now apply A to a solved cube and then the alg the
program found, you will not reach the goal state.

Where&#x27;s the mistake?

Btw, somebody once showed me this OLL alg:
R U R B&#x27; R&#x27; B U&#x27; R&#x27;
Do that starting with a solved cube. I immediately
replied &quot;hey I know a 6-turn alg for that case so
if I use the inverse of that I&#x27;ll have a 6-turner
for the same case you showed me an 8-turner for&quot;.

Cheers!

During a probablity exam the professor sees someone at the back
flipping a coin and marking his answers. Toward the end of the time
the student is flipping the coin faster and faster. The professor asks
him what he&#x27;s doing and he says that he&#x27;s checking his answers. 80)

Hi Jon,

nice report, thanks. Reminds me I still want to finish my own...

One comment: Don&#x27;t blame the magic rule, blame the judge. The magic is 
allowed to start and end two tiles higher than flat, i.e. about 0.45 
inches off the table. Thus your 1/8 inch off should&#x27;ve been accepted.

Cheers!

in the air. As you toss it, make it rotate instead of flip. Then, make it
oscillate slightly so it gives the illusion that it&#x27;s flipping. If you do it
properly then you can always get the same side. A friend showed this to
me...it was pretty cool.

          <div class="email-content">Exactly.  The type test measures your preferences.  Those preferences 
are OFTEN, but not ALWAYS, associated with certain skills or 
tendencies.  You will always find exceptions.  For example, I seem to 
be the only S so far.  N&#x27;s are just *generally* better at seeing 
patterns.  So call me an exception.  (Or don&#x27;t, considering I&#x27;m 
probably one of the most pathetic cubers here....)

My roommate in college was depressed after finding out he was INTP.  
He wanted to be a scientist so he thought he had to be INTJ.  But the 
16 types are not meant to be rigid boxes - only rough predictors.  
Well, long story short he gave up on science and majored in math 
instead.  :P

I wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if you /can/ beat this program 
consistently, but you don&#x27;t have much evidence here.

Suppose we start from the hypothesis (1) that those win/lose/tie 
percentages really are an accurate reflection of what you would get in 
a very long run of games.  

Now compare the probability of getting the result (9,3,4) under that 
assumption (1) with the probability of getting (9,3,4) in purely random 
play:

Ratio = (.5625)^9 * (.1875)^3 * (.25)^4 / (.3333)^16 = 6.2

This is not strong evidence in favour of (1), as compared with random 
play, and it will be weakened further if you were to make allowance for 
other hypotheses -- as we should: I deliberately chose (1) to be 
maximally favourable to /you/ -- i.e., to give the maximum possible 
value for the relative likelihoods of the 2 hypotheses.

It was a short run.  Try playing several hundred games to see if the 
program will pick up on your strategy.

Yeah, it would be boring to do a proper test. ;)

That sounds correct for one scenario: N players in a knockout 
competition of log N rounds (log to base 2), so there&#x27;s a 50% chance 
of Mr Random progressing from one round to the next.

But if everyone has to play everyone else, I suspect that the 
probability of Mr Random winning is much lower: the winner needs to 
get the highest overall score, and the strong programs that exploit 
patterns in the play of weak programs will be winning significantly 
more than half their games.

I was the judge... :-) Reading the report I still think the writer likes me. :-)

Actually I consider this the same as an always popping cube: you should buy a new puzzle if you cannot follow the regulations with your puzzle.
Yeah, it may sound a bit harsh, especially if you are not the record breaking type for a specific puzzle. But wasn&#x27;t there a wise American who said that all people are equal?

Any complaints about the regulations are welcome at the worldcubeassociation.org forum. We will work on the 2006 version in december 2005.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">The thing that bothers me the most is that the tiles for the magics<br>
are not the same thickness.<br>
<br>
I inadvertently used two magics of different tile thickness to make my<br>
master magic, which is why it hardly ever lays flat when solved<br>
(unless I take a few seconds to work it flat).  I got a DNF and a very<br>
close but still ok solve at RWC because of this.<br>
<br>
For us do it yourselfers who don&#x27;t want to, and can&#x27;t afford to, buy a<br>
master magic on eBay, can we at least petition rubiks.com to either<br>
standardize the tile thickness, or sell blank tiles (again<br>
standardized to the same size) so that we can make our own?<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think they will reinstate the magic DIY kit.  Mr. Rubik has<br>
requested that it not be sold anymore (I was told this when I was<br>
buying strings from rubiks.com).  Also, and I hate to be mean, but I<br>
think the cubesmith price of $6 for a bag of 16 strings is ridiculous.<br>
 If you need magic strings write to the people at rubiks.com.  They<br>
have been selling bags of 16 strings to me for $2 a bag for the past<br>
couple months.<br>
<br>
Anyway, is there a way that we can get the tiles standardized so that<br>
do it yourselfers, who now can&#x27;t buy a DIY kit, can make our own?  Or<br>
do I have to resort to eBay if I want to continue to compete in the<br>
master magic?<br>

Ha ha!  

But I wonder /why/ it appeals to them.  You&#x27;d expect Sudoku to be as 
nerdy -- and hence male-dominated -- as cubing.
I&#x27;ve actually noticed that many (perhaps even the majority) of the 
regular Sudoku solvers on the tram in the mornings are female.  On the 
other hand, they might just be the ones I notice.

Excuse me while I go sharpen a pencil...

You only notice females that do Sudoku, after all why would anyone be
interested in any male doing sudoku or solving some stupid rubik
puzzle anyway?

But according to what Jon wrote (that is was off the table only by 
about 0.125 inches) he *did* follow the regulations. The rules allow 
about 0.45 inches (using an old black magic as reference). So are you 
saying it was higher than he wrote in his report?

I did dispute it at first.  Then Ton came over and I thought that he

You demonstrated your skills to Matt and I as well that first day.  We 
were mighty impressed.  Do a video so others can see how multitalented

Suggestions:

Rendering
1. Raise the specularity and shininess on the stickers, they&#x27;re almost
reflective on new cubes. Perhaps add the logo to the white center.

2. look at a new cube, the reflections aren&#x27;t perfect. Add a really
light bump map to break up the reflections and specular highlights.

3. Get rid of ALL ambient light.  If you need more light, turn on a
point light.

4. Soften the spotlight. You have no decay around the edges of the
light and that circle makes the image look CG.

5. Add more than one light. Usually I use a simple 3 light setup: Key
light fill light and back light.  Make sure that they&#x27;re all not the
same intensity. Key is usually .9  Fill is .5 or so,  back is usually
the brightest. I can see 2 lights in yours, so play around with them
some more. Perhaps use area lights to soften the shaddows?

6. Get rid of the checkerboard table. As somebody who uses 3D
programs, it stands out as a simple procedural texture that you just
threw into the pic.  Perhaps you could find a photo of a piece of wood
and use that as a map? Or you could use a &quot;use background&quot; texture (I
think that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called in Max ... I usually use Maya) and
make the background white. That gives you the effect of the white
infinite room that you see so much on TV commercials, but you still
get the shaddows.

7. If you can, try working with mental ray. It allows you to play with
some really neat lighting stuff. For instance You can set it up to
show bounced light. Set your cube on a white piece of paper red in
front. Look at the paper. See the red?  Mental ray can do that. Look
for tutorials, they&#x27;re everywhere.

In general, your image is just too perfect. Real things aren&#x27;t that
perfect.

Animation - I&#x27;ve tried animating a cube once, and it didn&#x27;t turn out
well. When I finally sit down to do it correctly, I want it to be
fully scripted (IE select a center and the corresponding side turns no
matter how many other twists have happened. Which you unfortunately
can&#x27;t do with just simple grouping)
Anyway, back to you... the best way I found to move a cube is to move
all the pivot points into the very center of the cube. That way when
you select a side, the pivots are always directly below the center
cubie.  The problem I had was when a piece rotated more than 360.
If that happens, the rotation value will go back to 0 when you key the
frame, and when you play the animation, the piece will move in a
strange fasion, so you pretty much have to fix that in the graph
editor after you set the keyframes.

&lt;/long post> *whew
Hope I helped

OK, I was really, /really/ bored, and tried this for 400 throws, 
i.e., 25 complete cycles of the Pochmann sequence:

You have won 79, lost 164, and tied 157 games 
Statistics for 400 games
winning percentage*: -21.25%
won : 19.75%
lost: 41.00%
tied: 39.25%

The percentage of wins for the program increased steadily (but 
slowly) after some tens of games.

Here&#x27;s the result of 300 throws of RRRRRRRR...

You have won 1, lost 150, and tied 149 games 
Statistics for 300 games
winning percentage*: -49.67%
won : 0.33%
lost: 50.00%
tied: 49.67%

As you can see, it threw scissors only once, and is rigged so that it 
won&#x27;t win more than 50% of the games on average.

Hi Joel,

I just watched that company video. Very very stylish, they know how to 
do that. They don&#x27;t know much about cubing, though. The whole time it 
looks like you&#x27;re just scrambling and then suddenly there&#x27;s another 
cut and BOOM the cube is solved. So we don&#x27;t even see you solve the 
cube at all! Anybody could&#x27;ve done that!

I still like it for its style, though :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey Craig,

Yes it does. Equality doesn&#x27;t pertain to capbility and development per
se, but equal under the law, that is, no one is above the law and no
one is below the law. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much money you have or how
stupid you are the law is to treat you the same as everyone else.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Thanks cubekid,

I&#x27;m definatly not making a ton on Magic strings.  I also paid more 
than $2 a bag.  In fact after shipping I&#x27;m closer to $3.50 my cost.  
I was honestly just trying to offer these as a conveinence, because 
people had asked for them. I also don&#x27;t sell as many strings as you 
might think.  It will probably take me 4-5 months to sell the 25 
sets I bought.   

Thnaks

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I recently found that one of my ZBLL algs ends in a really really nice<br>
OLL alg that I have never seen before.  The first half is a setup into<br>
this OLL such that the OLL solves it.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;ve been trying just the OLL itself and I really like it, and<br>
am definitely switching to it.<br>
<br>
To setup do: L R&#x27; U F U&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; R<br>
<br>
To solve do: (R&#x27; U) L y&#x27; (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) (S)<br>
<br>
Also the inverse is very nice and solves the inverse OLL case<br>
To setup do: R&#x27; U L F U F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R<br>
<br>

What are your current algs for those?
How about:

Hmm... I thought it&#x27;s two, but now I see it&#x27;s actually indeed zero. 
Quote from the rules:

I thought the elevation rule was for both start and end. But it&#x27;s only 
for the end. So at the start it must be completely flat (whatever that 
means ;-).

I actually use the exact two algs that you just wrote here.

I think I may stick to my old alg for the second case, that new alg is
a bit awkward for my hands.  For my style though, that first new alg
is so much faster than my old one.

<br>
Well, it&#x27;s sort of a half S turn and half M turn.<br>
<br>
I guess to write it more exactly I would say<br>
<br>
(R&#x27; U) L y (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) x S<br>
<br>
The first y is only a half y turn.  Turn the cube so that you don&#x27;t<br>
have a flat face in the front as an F face, but rather what started as<br>
the FL edge.  The FL edge should be the closest part of the cube to you.<br>
<br>
Execute the (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;) from this angle.  Then do the x as if you were<br>
doing regular x rotation, but rotate with that FL edge still closest<br>
to you.  Also only do it as a half turn.  This way the S turn is<br>
halfway between an M and an S.<br>
<br>
I wish I had a camera and I could show you.  I&#x27;ve gotten it in 1.5x<br>
seconds several times though, so I mean it can be quite fast.<br>

These short runs aren&#x27;t really convincing.  (You would often get 
similar results by using the random number generator on your pocket 
calculator to choose your throws.)

Instead, try to beat the Roshambot consistently over several hundred 
games... the program uses the game history to make its &quot;predictions&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I have always endorsed the idea about fused tiles. The tiles 
themselves do not necessarily have to be very thick. Slightly 
thincker than the ones found on the impossiball will be enough. On 
those tiles only a very small pin is enough to fix them firmly to 
the puzzle pieces (discs). Personally i would love to see those 
kinda tiles on regular cubes and for me i think i might prefer some 
hardened rubber of some kind and not plastic. This will ensure a 
better grip/hold of the cube. 2 kinds of tiles could eb supplied. 
Plastic and hardened rubber.

But realistically i can&#x27;t see it happening. Seventowns have already 
declined remaking the deluxe/game cubes. So i can&#x27;t see why they 
would would be willing with such an extensive redesign of the cube 
either. And also these days one can get very good stickers and tiles 
from cubesmith. The days of really lousy stickers are gone already :-
)

Cheers!

  I hope someone can make cubes like that

  Hi!

I have always endorsed the idea about fused tiles. The tiles 
themselves do not necessarily have to be very thick. Slightly 
thincker than the ones found on the impossiball will be enough. On 
those tiles only a very small pin is enough to fix them firmly to 
the puzzle pieces (discs). Personally i would love to see those 
kinda tiles on regular cubes and for me i think i might prefer some 
hardened rubber of some kind and not plastic. This will ensure a 
better grip/hold of the cube. 2 kinds of tiles could eb supplied. 
Plastic and hardened rubber.

But realistically i can&#x27;t see it happening. Seventowns have already 
declined remaking the deluxe/game cubes. So i can&#x27;t see why they 
would would be willing with such an extensive redesign of the cube 
either. And also these days one can get very good stickers and tiles 
from cubesmith. The days of really lousy stickers are gone already :-

Hey, the other one is fast, too, I just did it 12 times in a row in 
16.97 seconds, i.e. 1.41 on average... :-)

No problems started. Cubesmith is just my hobby, not my carrer.  I&#x27;m 
just trying to provide one place that puzzlers can get supplies 
from.  

In fact I&#x27;d have probably done the same thing. I hate paying too 
much for stuff also.

My best average went from 20.61 to 19.35.  My best single solve went
from 15.7ish to 13.34.  It&#x27;s not too uncommon. :)

You wouldn&#x27;t get the &#x27;advantage&#x27; that the current tiles offer. I suppose if
you really master the technique, you could see every face of every piece on
the top layer at the same time if you use the current tiles.

          <div class="email-content">I used to have a 22.xx average, then I stopped cubing for about a month
because of school. When I picked it up again, I got a new pb average of
19.11 and have been sub-20 since.

I&#x27;m not sure how it happened, but I wish I could apply the same technique
for my classes. I would stop going to class for a month and show up for the

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re interested in seeing how someone might find
that on his or her own, but I thought Id tell you anyway. :)

A long time a go I was looking for a new way to reverse the position
of LL corners. Previously I had worked out R U R&#x27; U&#x27; which affects 4
corners and 3 edges and I thought I could adapt it the LL. The 4
corners were DR UR BR and BL. Since LU wasn&#x27;t affected and DR was I
added F to put LU where RU was and RU where DR was...beginning and
ending with F so F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; which you probably recognize.
Definitely one of my favorite algs.

Later on with similar reasoning applied to its mirror inverse R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;
U F R, I added L to the beginning and U L&#x27; at the end...

L R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; U F R U L&#x27;

L U&#x27; R F&#x27; U&#x27; F U r&#x27; Eight moves in my notation.

It is one of my favorite algs.

While I&#x27;m on favorite algs try F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L F U R U2 R&#x27;  now rotate
the cube QU2 and do the alg again.

Cheers,

David J

Instead they were glued on, except for the centers.  And the

Since I&#x27;m obsessed with color schemes, I think it would be awesome if 
they made one with swappable tiles in about 20 different colors.

the same thing occurred to me. ive been cubing for about 3 years
(though not very regularly) and i just started getting sub-20 times in
the summer. congrats!

I start with an xcross, doing this: (y&#x27;) U R&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27;w L F&#x27;
After that you are facing an easy pair, and when it&#x27;s solved (I 
think most of you do it the same way as me) do U2 and the next easy 
pair is in FL. When that one is done you only need three moves to 
fix the last pair.

  My solution was also 50 moves.  Maybe we did the same solve?

I made an extended cross, got the 6 move B orientation, and a G
permutation.  Is this what your solve was like?

umm, some other things (yes I know I&#x27;m nitpicking, but the devil is in
the details, but there are only 1 real one this time)

Play with the lighting more - look at some still life photos some
people have taken to get an idea of what I&#x27;m talking about. Lights
usually aren&#x27;t that close to the subject. Oh, And again, think about
using area lights, they really do emulate the real world better.

OOh! Idea!  if you get REALLY bored, try making a used speedcube,
peeling stickers, fading colors, chipped edges and all.

Again, wonderful job

<br>
What about JNetCube?  What exactly are you going to do when there&#x27;s a <br>
warning anyway?  Maybe you should just keep a stop watch next to the <br>
StackMat.  I guess I&#x27;m not clear why you want a warning.  Is the <br>
warning so that you&#x27;ll speed up or just so you know to start another <br>
time?  In BLD, if you don&#x27;t have it memorized, there&#x27;s nothing you can <br>
really do so a warning isn&#x27;t going to help.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

The warning would help me speed up. At WC05 the judge warned me at 1 
minute to go. Even though I got a DNF (i messed up earlier in the 
solve) it did help me speed up.

Is there a feature like that in JNetCube?

Was G Guimond there?  If so, was it possible to glean any information 
about his BLD feats (e.g., memorization time)?

http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01.shtml has a good
explanation of the f2l and, at least for me, was very good in teaching
me f2l. it only gives the basic, but half the fun is learning how it
works.

memorization can come later... learn how it works first

My best average went from 20.61 to 19.35.  My best single solve went
from 15.7ish to 13.34.  It&#x27;s not too uncommon. :)

Buy your 2*2*2 from mefferts.com. They&#x27;re much better than rubik&#x27;s 
2*2*2. The shipping costs is included in the price.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
Today I installed a new record post page on speedcubing.com.<br>
<br>
&gt;From now on it should not be necessary anymore to send an e-mail <br>
with a record post. The form should work in any browser, also if you <br>
are using a web e-mail service like Hotmail.<br>
If you accept the cookie from the record post page, your name and e-<br>
mail address will be available next time you post a record.<br>
<br>
This is the first step to automating the UWR record updates.<br>
All records are posted into a database, from where I (still) handle <br>
them manually.<br>
Upcoming steps to be developed are:<br>
1) after I approve a record, it will automatically appear on the <br>
record lists (this would make a HUGE difference for me!) :-)<br>
2) new page with 50 latest posted records (for visitors to see what <br>
changed recently)<br>
3) trusted posters can update their own records (yet even less work <br>
for me)<br>
4) one e-mail address + website reference across all pages (at the <br>
moment all pages are handled separately)<br>
<br>
All this great work is done by Lars Vandenbergh!<br>
Thank you so much Lars! Visit his site at www.cubezone.be <br>
<br>
Suggestions for the UWR pages are very welcome via e-mail.<br>
<br>
Thanks and have fun,<br>

Hi Anssi!

Do you have big problems with your hand?? For how long will you not be 
able to cube??

Will you come to Uppsala 12/11 and break the WR for footcubing?

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations on getting down to 2 min. 

First of all, in short, yes you must learn to read notation if you
ever want to learn any algorithms. It isn&#x27;t hard and it&#x27;s almost
required if you want to get fast.

If you want some great sites, check out the links section at
speedcubing.com.

You can get a genuine Rubik&#x27;s cube from Wal-Mart or Target.

good luck!

The only thing I&#x27;d like to add that we should encourage everybody to
keep their times updated... for the bigger cubes and other puzzles as
well.
The unofficial lists are (in theory) only useful if _everyone_ posts
and updates his/her times.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ...

That would be 2 separate things. Ones best time(s) and the most 
recent ones. If posting the most recent time would make u lose the 
best time in their lists noone would post latest times i guess. So i 
can see the need for 2 separate lists for those 2 different 
purposes. As i understand it that is also the plan. To show best 
time as well as the most recent times. Editing that urself is a 
great timesaver for Ron (and Chris) :-)

Hungarian Prodanov Mitk (19) broke the world record of solving the<br>

This is 5,5 seconds faster than the previous record, set in 1982 - when<br>

That could be a new kind of competition. Give a scramble, let competitors find a good solution (FMC style, but optimized for speed), make them solve as fast as possible...  mmhh... No.


Try #1: 16s

Ul&#x27;U&#x27;L2F
RUr&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;r2UR2UM2UR
U2RUR&#x27;URU2r&#x27;
UM&#x27;U&#x27;M&#x27;U2M&#x27;U&#x27;xU2M&#x27;U2M&#x27;

...
...
Try #20: 8.8s


With this scramble, there&#x27;s a 2x2x2 in 4 moves! Maybe Lars would have found F2L+OLL in 26 fast moves using his technique, leaving an easy permutation. 
UF&#x27;B&#x27;LRUR&#x27;U2R&#x27;F2RFRUR2U&#x27;RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;R2UR2U&#x27;RU+3-cycle -> 35 moves


By the way, recently I did a very fast solve, I managed to keep the scramble and the solution:

L F L&#x27; U B2 R&#x27; L2 F&#x27; U2 F B L D&#x27; F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; F U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; D B2 L2 F2 D2 

z2FRURr2B&#x27;
U&#x27;r&#x27;U&#x27;M&#x27;URU2R2UR&#x27;
U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUlU&#x27;R&#x27;Ux
UMUM&#x27;U2M&#x27;U&#x27;MU2

I had over two week break, then got Stackmat, cubed two days and 
then my wrists started hurting again. I think I will restart this 
week. I must limit myself to 30 solves/day.

The only thing I think that needs updating is the 
word &quot;preinspection&quot;. It is presolve, and it is inspection. So 
preinspection would be the time before you actually start 
inspecting, would it not?  

But as long as you understand that the &quot;preinspection&quot; starts when 
you pick the cube up from the table and finishes when you put it 
back down on the table, then the issue is moot as you are not 
putting it on the table during your inspection as per this rule.  

I do wonder, however, if that means you are disqualified if you 
accidentally drop the cube because it will then touch the table

  what happens if the cube fell from my hand? Can I take it (with one hand) and continue solving? or am I disqualified?

The only thing I think that needs updating is the 
word &quot;preinspection&quot;. It is presolve, and it is inspection. So 
preinspection would be the time before you actually start 
inspecting, would it not?  

But as long as you understand that the &quot;preinspection&quot; starts when 
you pick the cube up from the table and finishes when you put it 
back down on the table, then the issue is moot as you are not 
putting it on the table during your inspection as per this rule.  

I do wonder, however, if that means you are disqualified if you 
accidentally drop the cube because it will then touch the table 
during the solving portion.  This is probably in the rules somewhere 
and someone else will undoubtedly enlighten me.

This is a typical &quot;letter of the law&quot; versus &quot;spirit of the law&quot; type
of thing. The spirit of the law is that the cube is to be solved by
one hand, in this case, unaided by the table. Picking up the cube is
not a violation of the spirit of the law; so it not should it be
necessary to change the wording of the rule.

Cheers,

I don&#x27;t really have much of a problem with it.  It is a &quot;spirit of the 
law&quot; but the letter of the law is also clear.  If you drop the cube on 
the table or if you drop the cube and it falls onto your chest or foot, 
you&#x27;re not breaking the rule because you&#x27;re not using the table or the 
body to manipulate the cube.  Manipulate implies &quot;making a turn&quot; and so 
if you are using the table to apply a force to the cube which turns a 
side, then you&#x27;re breaking the rule.  If you use your armpit to hold 
the cube while your other hand turns the cube, that&#x27;s not good either.

I think that is the point here. Unless Anssi did not copy the entire 
section in question, the rule does not appear to have the 
word &quot;manipulate&quot; in it.  It states &quot;touch&quot; as being the culprit.

Just a naïve question.
When you&#x27;re a beginner, solving with the help of the table is much 
easier. But when you&#x27;re sub-30, is it still valid?

          <div class="email-content">Feet-solving is definitely a tricky one.  It seems that the wording for 
feet-solving should allow the floor to be used because, in the words of 
Stefan, what&#x27;s natural for a person to do with their feet is to anchor 
the cube on the floor and then make a turn.

For one-handed, yes, we should use the word &quot;manipulate&quot; instead of 
&quot;touch&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s the last layer algorithms that get me. I also attribute my lack
of one-handed skill to the fact that my cube is a little stiffer and
my hands are kind of small, so having to regrip the cube every couple
of turns slows me down a lot.

          <div class="email-content">yes i used notation, its not that hard, and its  just kind of something you need to suck it up and do.  i do use  some more advanced techniques now, but i reached around 35 seconds with  the basic petrus method, then i expanded to learn some other last layer  techniques.  if you wanted my advice on what to practice to get  faster, it would be the first 2 steps of the method, building the 2x2x2  then the 2x2x3.  try studying each corner and see how many moves  you can make a 2x2x2 box with each one.  once you know which one  you think is the shortest, study it until you know the moves to make  the box in your head (this is why notation is important)  then  execute building the 2x2x2 blindfolded.  this will help you see  the box to build, as well as helping you to be able to look ahead,  because if you can build the 2x2x2 without looking at what you are  doing, you can be searching for the next 3 pieces you need while doing  the 2x2x2.  and 25 seconds is far from amazing, but thanks
 for  your compliment.  it does take patience, you can&#x27;t just go from 10  minutes to 1 minute in a day or two.  it will come naturally,  don&#x27;t worry about speed, work on efficiency and the speed will come  naturally.

          <div class="email-content">I was thinking about this a bit more.  There is a certain agreement <br>
between the student and the teacher.  The teacher is expected to <br>
further the education of his student without reservation.  When I teach <br>
people blindfolding, I tell them everything I know, even if it means <br>
that they might beat me later on.  I know Leyan and I share blindfold <br>
ideas freely with the hope of pushing the human limits of blindfold <br>
cubing.  I don&#x27;t hold any secrets back so that I can beat him.<br>
<br>
The student, on the other hand, is expected to put forth an effort <br>
equal or greater to that of the teacher&#x27;s effort.  You cannot expect me <br>
to explain to you concept of the cube if you are not willing to put <br>
forth the effort to learn something as simple as notation, which, I <br>
might add, can be learned in about 2 minutes.  If you are constantly <br>
searching for short cuts in order to get by on cubing, your success <br>
will surely be limited.<br>
<br>
We&#x27;re all willing to help you.  I can tell you that an 18 second <br>
average is possible with only OLL and PLL.  (Takahito Domon) and that <br>
Macky can probably solve the cube with a beginner&#x27;s method in 23 <br>
seconds on average (no OLL, no PLL).  However, these people have spent <br>
a considerable effort studying the art of cubing.<br>
<br>
All of us are friendly here.  But we&#x27;ll only put in as much effort to <br>
teach you as you are willing to put in effort to learn.<br>

Aw, don&#x27;t let&#x27;s be hard on a beginner.  Give him a bit of time, eh?  :)

  to explain to you concept of the cube if you are not willing to put 
  forth the effort to learn something as simple as notation, which, I 
  might add, can be learned in about 2 minutes.  If you are constantly 
  searching for short cuts in order to get by on cubing, your success 
  will surely be limited.
  
  We&#x27;re all willing to help you.  I can tell you that an 18 second 
  average is possible with only OLL and PLL.  (Takahito Domon) and that 
  Macky can probably solve the cube with a beginner&#x27;s method in 23 
  seconds on average (no OLL, no PLL).  However, these people have spent 
  a considerable effort studying the art of cubing.
  
  All of us are friendly here.  But we&#x27;ll only put in as much effort to 
  teach you as you are willing to put in effort to learn.

Just to take a philisophical turn, I do believe that some people are <br>
just meant to be better cubers for reasons like faster reflexes, <br>
better visual spacial skills, etc.  I mean not anyone can train to win <br>
the 100m at the olympics, some people are just better built for it, so <br>
if they train as much as you, you can&#x27;t catch up.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t mean that to sound pessimistic, but it seems most disciplines <br>
are this way, I guess we should also qualify?  I just felt like asking <br>
to see what others thought too.<br>

<br>
Yes, I agree with you to a degree.  In many sports, you can only work <br>
so hard.  Once you get to the elite level, physiology takes over.  I <br>
can train as hard as I want, and I might work my entire life off and <br>
manage to run a mile in 4 minutes and 20 seconds, but the elite runners <br>
do it in 3 minutes and 50 seconds, and there comes a point where body <br>
type and things we cannot control are start to factor into our success <br>
overwhelmingly.<br>
<br>
However, with cubing, I think it affects us far less.  Cubing is very <br>
much a mental thing.  The dexterity can be learned just as anyone can <br>
learn to play the violin.  I would believe that cubing is very much <br>
like learning to play music and only a few people in the world have <br>
innate abilities that help them.  Otherwise, for the most part, pretty <br>
much anyone can be sub-20.  Sub-15... is another story, and is like the <br>
3:50 mile.<br>

On the contrary, I feel that we&#x27;re already reasonably close to the
possible limits of human execution.  Think of it this way:  If someone
could conceivably use full ZB (or whatever method with few moves they
choose) and manage between 40 and 45 moves per solve, along with a
turn rate of around 5 turns per second, that&#x27;s still something like 9
seconds on average.

Sure, proportionately, we&#x27;ve got a long way to go, but with the rate
of improvement, and the general refinement of the methods and
processes, I believe cubing will soon reach a point where a sub-13 or
even sub-12 average is not unheard of in competition.  Of course, even
that is leagues away from 9 seconds, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time,
really.

I&#x27;m much more interested in the limits on the 4x4.

I was at the Hungarian event last weekend and their aim was to beat the
previous Hungarian record (which was done several times over the
weekend!), not the world record.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!!

The article is changed now and I don&#x27;t remember what it said before. 
Now it says something like:

Hungarian Prodanov Mitk solved the rubik&#x27;s kub in an amazing time of 
18.5 seconds this sunday. It&#x27;s 5.5 seconds better than the WR was in 
1982 when the Rubiks-fever was on its peak. But he is not the 
fastest cuber in the world. The official WR is 11.75 and is held by 
Jean Pons, France.

That is the spirit of the article. I may have misunderstood some 
details because I&#x27;m swedish and it&#x27;s a norwegian newspaper, but I 
think it&#x27;s OK.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I just got back from the Hungarian Nationals which you may or may not <br>
have seen media about. <br>
<br>
It was a fantastically well organised event, and the aim of the <br>
competition was to bring the cube back into peoples minds in Hungary, <br>
and also to try and break the old Hungarian Record. The event <br>
accomplished both goals, with several records broken and a best time <br>
of 18.21 (I think thats right).<br>
<br>
We then took part in the &quot;Kocka Show&quot; afterwards and showed off lots <br>
of different skills, Stefan and I did team-blindfold solving, and also <br>
blindfolded - where Stefan successfully solved followed by tumultuous <br>
applause; and Jasmine, Stefan and I took part in lots of races of all <br>
sorts with the Hungarians. I also beat Stefan by less than 0.5 seconds <br>
on the 4x4x4, bad luck mate! My proudest moment was setting the <br>
fastest time of the day on stage, 15.87.<br>
<br>
I also set an 11.24 seconds solve while being solved by a TV news <br>
crew, so I am looking forward to seeing the video of that. It was <br>
scrambled by Stefan and timed on his stopwatch, so I guess the time <br>
maybe inaccurate, but we will be able to tell from the video :)<br>
<br>
The city was also beautiful (Budapest), and the Hungarians were very <br>
friendly and welcoming to all. <br>
<br>
If the European Championship of 2006 will be held in Budapest, then I <br>
think it would be a superb event. Because the cube a national <br>
treasure, there is SO SO much more interest within the Hungarian <br>
public, the crowds that turned up were even bigger than at the World <br>
Champs! And the media guys did a great job of publicising the event, <br>
and making sure it ran smoothly.<br>
<br>
I will definitely be voting for EC2006 in Hungary.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve almost sorted my webhosting out now, so when it&#x27;s back up I will <br>
add pics from DCD2005, WC2005, and Hungarian Nationals as well as <br>
reports for all, updated FMC and lots more stuff I promise!<br>

There have been some rumors about the next European championship on <br>
the French forum. Here is a message from Mr Karpiel, president of <br>
Winning Moves France group (they organised last french champs) :<br>
<br>
&quot;Il y aura bien un championnat de France 2006, comme d&#x27;habitude un<br>
vendredi de la deuxième quinzaine d&#x27;avril au Novotel les Halles à<br>
Paris (bloquez déjà ces vendredis).<br>
Il y aura également un championnat d&#x27;Europe à Paris à l&#x27;automne 2006.<br>
J&#x27;aimerais bien que ce soit à la Cité des Sciences à La Villette,<br>
mais ce n&#x27;est pas encore acquis.<br>
La date reste à préciser, entre début septembre et début novembre<br>
2006. Ce sera un week-end.&quot;<br>
T .KARPIEL, Président de Winning Moves .<br>
<br>
I reported above the original french message, but here is a <br>
translation :<br>
&quot;French championship will be organised in 2006, as usual on a Friday, <br>
late April, in Novotel les Halles in Paris.<br>
There will be as well European Championship in Paris (fall 2006). I <br>
would like it to take place at the Cité des Sciences in La Villette, <br>
but it has not been confirmed yet.<br>
The date has not been fixed either, this will be a week-end between <br>
early September and early November.&quot;<br>

          <div class="email-content">It was definitely a great weekend. I had so much fun and I&#x27;m sure
everyone else did too!

I was impressed with how well organised the Hungarian competition was.
There must have been quite a lot of pre-competition publicity as there
were well over 100 competitors in total. I think I heard the number 130?
This is far more than any other competition I&#x27;ve been to (other than
Worlds 2005 of course). Also, as the competition and the cube show was
staged in the middle of a shopping centre it meant that there were lots
of general spectators, i.e. not just other cubers in the audience.

BTW, my proudest moment was beating both Dan *and* Stefan in a 3x3x3
race on stage during the cube show! ;)

Subject: Re: [Speed cubing group] Hungarian Nationals


It was definitely a great weekend. I had so much fun and I&#x27;m sure
everyone else did too!

I was impressed with how well organised the Hungarian competition was.
There must have been quite a lot of pre-competition publicity as there
were well over 100 competitors in total. I think I heard the number 130?
This is far more than any other competition I&#x27;ve been to (other than
Worlds 2005 of course). Also, as the competition and the cube show was
staged in the middle of a shopping centre it meant that there were lots
of general spectators, i.e. not just other cubers in the audience.

BTW, my proudest moment was beating both Dan *and* Stefan in a 3x3x3
race on stage during the cube show! ;)

O, sancta simpliticas!

          <div class="email-content">I really think it would be fantastic if we could order some for
Christmas, but that may be a bit too optimistic.  Nonetheless, I&#x27;m
going to have to get one ASAP. As for times, my gut feeling is to say
that if the cubes turn well, 5 minutes will be hit by many of the top
cubers pretty quickly.  Just a quick look at the data suggests that if
you compare fastest time to number of pieces, then extrapolate the
number of pieces needed to be placed on the 6x6x6 cube, I get that a
world record time may be around 4:02 .  I would certainly not be
surprised if this was high though!

method as they do for smaller cubes (4x4x4 and 5x5x4) on the 6x6x4?  It
seems to me that as the cubes get larger, the widely-accepted
Centers-Edges-3x3x3-Parity approach gets less and less efficient.  What
does everyone else think?

It looks as though the puzzles gain about a minute per solution as the sizes increase.  Just my opinion though.

<br>
This might not be the right forum, but I have a couple curious <br>
questions about the various championships.<br>
<br>
- I saw various country championships that occurred before the WC2005, <br>
with the country winners often getting a trip to WC2005. Was there a <br>
US championship in 2005? (I see that there was one in 2004).<br>
<br>
- Why are the world championships every other year? It seems like the <br>
momentum around cubing is increasing, could having a WC every year <br>
help grow the momentum? Especially if a TV deal (for WC and/or various <br>
country championships) could eventually be worked out, but that&#x27;s <br>
another subject.<br>
<br>
thanks for any info that helps sate my curiousity,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I was pretty surprised too! Basically I just had a really good
smooth solve, and Dan and Stefan both had bad solves. I definitely
remember Dan saying that he&#x27;d really stuffed something up during the
solve (which is obviously true if I was beat him!).

My normal average is ~30 seconds, but I was doing better than average
last weekend and the majority of my solves on stage were sub-30s
(ranging from 22s to 29s).

It&#x27;s finally done testing 22 moves out and no solution so it&#x27;s at least 24 moves (QTM). My 
machine is struggling now so I can&#x27;t test it to 26 moves. Anyway, this is at least as far out 
as superflip in both QTM and HTM.

pictures of us while we were cubing too.<br>
<br>
I wrote a short report, with a couple pictures too.<br>

There are two problems with this (as a general rule for larger cubes):

1. The number of pieces increases quadratically with the side length, not linearly, so it&#x27;s 
not likely that the times would increase linearly (plus you only have 2 steps for this basis 
3->4 and 4->5, unless you can solve the 2x2x2 in negative time!) The centres are the 
main limiting factor (the quadratic factor) - in the 3x3x3 there are 6*1^2 centres (but 
nothing to do if not marked) but in the 4x4x4 there are 6*2^2=24 centres in the 5x5x5 
there are 6*3^2 centres (48 if you don&#x27;t count the very centres) but ther&#x27;s 6*4^2=96 
centres in a 6x6x6. This is probably why centres first is often used on these puzzles. 
There&#x27;s a higher degree of freedom for the longest part which gives more speed. The 
edges (linear) and corners (constant) require less time so it&#x27;s best to do them with more 
constraints. Doing the centres last puts more constraints on the largest part of the puzzle.

2. It is harder to locate pieces. Admittedly, this isn&#x27;t really an issue for 6x6x6 - it does 
become an issue in the really big cubes though. Try finding centre pieces on a cube of size 
11x11x11 or bigger! This really slows things down on larger cubes.

I&#x27;d imagine there&#x27;s a further problem which is that the cube is probably less stable and 
more likely to break up/lock up at speed. The pieces will be smaller and even if the 
overlap problem is solved an increase in the number of slices means the cube is more 
likely to jam. If each slice is just a little off then things will build up quicker. This is only a 
problem for physical cubes, not computer cubes (for which the closest thing is a bad 
mouse) although 1, 2 apply equally to each.

You would need to make replacement parts if the internals are as
delicate as they sound, and if those are expensive you have a whole
other issue.

Either way I will buy a 6x6x6 as I hope they hold up for speedcubing.

Also, will the 10 minute time limit be kept?  If so, I imagine not
many people would compete, other than top level big cube people who
have a fast solution with lots of practice.

The 6x6x6 isn&#x27;t as open to new people who have just figured it out.  I
mean is that just the nature of the puzzle, or should we extend the
time limits?

Im sure it was a great time there in Hungary. The norwegian press 
also published that a new world record was set as u might have seen 
from a link in earlier post here :-P It&#x27;s insane the lack of 
knowledge and interest the norwegian press shows with cubing. They 
claimed they just used the text they got with a photo from a news 
agency. So much for press research ;-) Half a minute w google would 
have told them otherwise. A good thing coming from my contact with 
the press after reading that is that they told me to contact them 
again if i should go to future competitions ;-)

It seems to be the case that the &quot;poorer&quot; the country is hosting 
cubing competitions the greater the organisation actually is. Ron 
was very overwhelmed by the competition in Poland earlier this 
autumn. And now a great competition in Hungary. Well Hungary is the 
home of the inventor of the 3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube so i guess it&#x27;s only 
expected. Dan and Jasmine, were u sponsored to go to this event? If 
so i&#x27;m very jealous :-o

Anyway, back to my writing up my thesis :D

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

if it will be possible to buy the 6x6x6 olympicube somewhere online 
i will buy 2pieces assuming price is less then $100. If the price is 
higher i have to consider how much i really need to have 2. Anyhow 
i&#x27;m afraid they won&#x27;t be around for too long after release and will 
become collector&#x27;s items. But i could be wrong also. Maybe it&#x27;s 
actually a good idea to have Mefferts or Seventowns/Winning moves 
take over the manufacturing/distribution of the cube? These 
companies have quite a solid economy and will assure that the cube 
can be produced for a prolonged time.

Anyhow i guess that if the cube turns well a single time of less 
than 3 minutes will be achieved after a while. I can see that might 
happen with my method if the blocks come up nicely :-) As for parity 
it pretty much depends on which method u are going to use. Treating 
edges &quot;singularly&quot; and not as &quot;quedges&quot; or &quot;3x3x3 edges&quot; i will have 
2 parities for my method. For the common pairing-up method there 
will also be 2 parities after all the &quot;quedges&quot; have come together. 
Getting the last few quedges together might prove quite cumbersome 
though. I guess one needs to resort to pure 3-cycles or other 
tricks. A &quot;quedge&quot; can be flipped with the well know algorithm from 
the 4x4x4 cube simply treating the 6x6x6 cube as a 4x4x4 cube (1-2-2-
1). I hope that should make sense to everyone. This also means there 
will be algs fixing both parities in one go, again treating the cube 
1-2-2-1.

What i suspect becomes more cumbersome in general as cube size 
increases is to find (recognise) edges for pairing up. Again i could 
be wrong. Just because i find it awkward doesn&#x27;t mean everyone finds 
it awkward. Anyhow it will be interesting to see how my method 
(cage) and the reductionist approach (centers first, pairing up 
edges) will compare timewise :-)

Cheers!

Ask Per Fredlund to describe what exactly to sand.  I think he
mentioned Grant Tregay&#x27;s method for sanding down the inside bits of
the outer edge pieces.  Wait for him to post to make sure, but I think
that&#x27;s it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Geocities has very low allocated bandwidths. Once a page there 
becomes really popular there it&#x27;s as good as impossible to get 
access to it. Only good thing about geocities is that it is free and 
they have some tools to build ur homepage. But only use it if u 
don&#x27;t expect many visitors ... sorry Jon :-o

Cheers!

-Per

PS! Im not sure whether geocities has options to pay for more 
bandwidth. Long time since i checked it :D

So they do offer Plus and Pro packages now. The Pro package give u 
ur own domain name pluss 2GB file storage and 100 GB/month bandwidth 
for $8.95 month. I guess that is not bad but there are cheaper ones 
out there with unlimited bandwidth ... To have a clue what bandwidth 
might be needed ask Ron how much traffic there is on 
www.speedcubing.com or those with other cubing sites :-)

          <div class="email-content">Umm ...

On their site they say the following :

&quot;Furthermore, among many other great features, the Parcom 750 offers 
a generous amount of bandwidth--up to 30 gigabytes per month.  Plus 
the setup is FREE!&quot;

This is not exactly unlimited but much higher than the geocities&#x27; 
free solution which offers 3 GB/month. Hosting pictures/galleries 
greatly increases the bandwidth. Use of thumbnails is a good idea :-)

This makes me wonder what size webhosts consider to be unlimited 
bandwidth. Do domain hosts that offer TRUE unlimited bandwidths 
really exist??

I recall last yearr speedcubing.com hit the roof on its bandwidth 
due to hosting a rather large video. I think this was sorted out by 
deleting the video and opting for a more expensive package.

Have fun!

If the problem is just that the page has exceeded the bandwidth limit
then the error message says so and tells the user to try again later.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been doing some thinking lately on these two strategies and <br>
wanted to post about it.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to even rewrite my Xcross page to include this, as I <br>
really really like it.  I think people who use Xcross need to <br>
seriously consider also using opposite cross.<br>
<br>
I learned about opposite cross from Richard Patterson, and basically <br>
I solve either a white or yellow cross.  I know people think this <br>
could be slower, but one of my 14&#x27;s and I&#x27;m pretty sure my 12.xx at <br>
the RWC2005 were done with opposite cross (yellow for me).<br>
<br>
Also, here is some math that is very promising.<br>
<br>
I do Xcross on a single face probably about 25% of the time.  Since <br>
I now solve opposite cross though, my odds for an Xcross is 25% for <br>
yellow and also 25% for white.  So I have an overall chance of 1-<br>
(3/4)^2 = 7/16 = 43.75% chance of getting an Xcross.<br>
<br>
I had recently noticed that I was getting Xcross solves much more <br>
often than I used to, and the reason is I now have a 43% chance of <br>
getting one rather than only 25% or so.<br>
<br>
I know opinions vary on solving other colors, but I like opposite <br>
cross since it keeps your F2L edges the same.  Also it almost <br>
doubles my chances of an Xcross right now, and that is seriously <br>
helping my times.<br>
<br>
Also it works under pressure, I had I think 3 opposite cross solves <br>
in competition at the RWC, and I&#x27;ve used it at Caltech Dallas as <br>
well.<br>
<br>
So anyway, I&#x27;m going to include this on my Xcross site, but I wanted <br>
to post here as I have definitely become a convert to opposite <br>
cross.  I am now definitely an opposite cross and Xcross solver :-) <br>
(Richard, thanks so much for the opposite cross idea!!!) :-D<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; &gt; Just to take a philisophical turn, I do believe that some people <br>
are<br>
&gt; &gt; just meant to be better cubers for reasons like faster reflexes,<br>
&gt; &gt; better visual spacial skills, etc.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Otherwise, for the most part, pretty <br>
&gt; much anyone can be sub-20.  Sub-15... is another story, and is like <br>
the <br>
&gt; 3:50 mile.<br>
<br>
I do agree that some of us just have more of a natural knack than <br>
others at certain types of activities.  Me personally, I am much <br>
better at verbal-type games than spatial ones.  (I wish my interests <br>
were in the same direction as my abilities!)<br>
<br>
For me, psychology is the major blocking point.  If you find yourself <br>
like me, in the below-average category for learning speedcubing, <br>
you&#x27;ll need to have proportionately more perseverence.  Probably much <br>
more.  I just don&#x27;t seem to have it.  After several 50+ second solves <br>
in a row, my mind goes berzerk.  &quot;Slow as molasses!&quot;  &quot;I&#x27;m getting <br>
worse!&quot;  &quot;I can&#x27;t even beat some 6-year-old kid from Korea!&quot; and <br>
that&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m done for the day.  At this point, I don&#x27;t have the <br>
mindset of a speedcuber, even if the potential is there.<br>

That&#x27;s why the standard color scheme is interesting.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll be surprised if the price tops $100 USD, but I guess it depends 
on how many they make and how big the demand is.  If they become 
rare, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll fetch that and more on Ebay.

As for speedcubing with it, the video on their site demonstrates the 
ability to &quot;shortcut&quot; single-layer and double-layer twists (i.e. 
turn R while U and/or U1 are misaligned).  They also depict using 
the index finger to quickly twist the U face, as well as the U1 
layer.  So it seems that speedcubing would certainly be possible.

wow, thats a great method. I decided to try out your XCross and <br>

For several years this was my only cube.  It wasn&#x27;t much good: it had 
nasty paper stickers, over-strong springs, and it was /very/ difficult 
to adjust the spring tension.  I eventually recycled some of the pieces 
to make a 3x2x2...

4th Dimension cubes appear fairly regularly on eBay, but I can&#x27;t 
rememember what they typically sell for.  Sorry!

Dan Harris&#x27;s page has a wealth of advice and training material:

http://www.necrophagous.co.uk/cubestation/cross/cross.php

I&#x27;m just a little doubtful about the usefulness of the colour rules (I 
reckon you can &quot;see&quot; these things anyway), but I can&#x27;t argue with Dan&#x27;s 
speed. ;)

speedcubing, at that point I timed myself and couldn&#x27;t get any <br>
faster than 5min, when lucky - I was using my method, very slow.<br>
<br>
After looking at corners first, Fridrich, 2x2x3 build, etc I decided <br>
that for the amount of time I had available some were to complicated.<br>
<br>
So I use an intuitive Fridrich to get a 2x2x3 block, then use Lars <br>
to orientate the edges and finish the rest of the cube.  Eventually <br>
I will probably use Fridrich to finish the LL.<br>
<br>
The reason I tell you is I just got 5 solves in a row under a <br>
minute, 2 of which under 50sec., only one was a lucky solve.  I <br>
pause alot to figure out my next move, once recognition sets in I <br>
know I will reach 30sec, maybe faster.<br>
<br>
To move any faster, I will eventually have to stick with one method, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone<br>
<br>
<br>
After completely switching to Gilles Roux&#x27;s method, I have achieved a<br>
sub 30 average in my first 3 weeks of practice.  My Best ROUX solve is<br>
21.21 sec.<br>
<br>
(25.00), 26.87, 33.70, 27.28, 25.00, 26.05, 33.56, 32.90, 29.48,<br>
33.65, 30.15, (34.28)      AVG 29.86<br>
<br>
It took me like 7 months to get sub 30 with CFOP, so I am pretty happy<br>
with how well this system is working for me.  <br>
<br>
If I had to start all over, I would not learn OLL/PLL at all.    I<br>
would either learn CLL/ELL  or   I might have done a 3 look LL.<br>
OLL and PLL is 78 algorithms if memory serves correct.  <br>
THis approach would be less. 46 ALgs for last layer. <br>
<br>
1. Orient Edges (2 algs, 5/6 of the time)<br>
2. COLL ( 40 algs, if im not mistaken)<br>
3. Permute edges (4 algs, 11/12 of the time)<br>
<br>
with ZBF2L, you could eliminate the first look entirely, for a very<br>
fast LL.  But all you team[zb] guys will soon prove this method to be<br>
better than OLL/PLL. <br>
<br>
 Another good option is Petrus with COLL.  If the corners are already<br>
positioned, there are many cases to learn to do the LL in one<br>
Algorithm (Step 6/7 index).  All of these cases are comprised of 2<br>
smaller, familiar sequences, making them easy to learn. <br>
<br>
As is turns out, Im gonna go with Roux&#x27;s method.  But dont know too<br>
many CLL algs yet.  I dont use any CLL in my solves yet, I want to<br>
wait until I have them all down.  I Need CLL algs from anybody who can<br>
help me out.  I want to look for the shortest algs for each case.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
and Im so sorry for rambling on...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Fantastic! More roux solvers!

I&#x27;ve just hit sub-30 and I&#x27;m on the trail to sub-20, 18, 15, etc. My
best roux solve is 20.60 though ;) I found that omsetimes, my averages
would be all over the place, but I&#x27;m settling down now.

CLL is nice and I have about 40% of CLL/COLL learnt. the reason I&#x27;ve
learnt some COLL is because I wanted to use the COLL recognition
system, so I learnt a load of COLL cases to get used to it. Eventually
I&#x27;ll be using A full CLL. But that a way off yet. Plus, some COLL algs
are nicer. D&#x27;s and L&#x27;s arn&#x27;t too nice :S

Yeah, I&#x27;ve been comprising a big list of CLL/COLL algs I use/will be
using if you want it. I&#x27;ll finish it and send you a copy.

Oh, I&#x27;d still recommend learning PLL. It comes in so handy for BLD
cubing. (Well, 3-cycles anyway).

What I need is help with the first two blocks :S Any tips? Even my
pair and insert (the last bit of the second one) is quite bad). We
need some kind of F2B algorithm tables ;)

Apart from that, try and nag gilles to update his site :)

I&#x27;m not an expert with the cross, but starting from either white or 
yellow (opposite side) is a Good Idea, since it does not really 
change the rest of the algorithm.
That&#x27;s why the standard color scheme is interesting.
I used it as a fallback strategy, now starting with white or yellow 
does not matter anymore. More and more, the problem is to find a cube 
that does not look lucky.

So I&#x27;m just asking you, what categories would you like to see? <br>
Hopefully I can put up fields for most puzzle categories, so you could <br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s great that more people are beginning to take an interest in the<br>
Roux method.  It&#x27;s got so much potential, it just doesn&#x27;t seem widely<br>
known, yet.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve recently begun learning ZBF2L intuitively (for the most part) in<br>
an effort to better my times.  I only really have 3 or so cases down<br>
for sure, but it really works wonders for your times.  I&#x27;ve also<br>
recently finished learning the rest of COLL, which is a fantastic<br>
system.  My normal average is now between 20 and 21, with my best<br>
times in the 14&#x27;s.  I recognize the cases the same way as on Gilles<br>
Roux&#x27;s site, so hopefully my advice will apply to you guys some.<br>
<br>
I decided to take a few days off from ZB learning and devote time to<br>
the Roux method. And despite not really working on it in months,<br>
earlier today I averaged 20.11 (so close! XP) with a new best time of<br>
15.67.  I&#x27;m still using the second method for orienting and placing<br>
the final edges, and I haven&#x27;t learned any of the special shortened<br>
cases.  Also, there&#x27;s really only one case where I use a CLL instead<br>
of the COLL, just because that&#x27;s what I know.  Anyway, here are the<br>
tips I&#x27;ve got.<br>
<br>
For the 1x2x3 blocks:  GO SLOWLY.  Especially at first.  It&#x27;s easy to<br>
get a good pace going for the first block with inspection and forget<br>
to slow down for the second.  It&#x27;s important.  Work at it.<br>
<br>
Also, try to have several tricks for doing each block.  Know how to<br>
match a corner and edge and insert.  Know how to insert an edge in any<br>
of the three spots on each block, and know how to use block starts<br>
like in the Petrus method.<br>
<br>
For the corners: Don&#x27;t learn them in the order on the Roux site. <br>
Learn the T and U and L cases first.  There are 5+1 reflection for the<br>
first two, and 4+2 reflections for the last.  I think this covers the<br>
bulk of cases you run into.  After that, it&#x27;s up to you, but it will<br>
be smoother sailing because you&#x27;re more used to it.<br>
<br>
Also, try to use everything you&#x27;ve learned all the time during<br>
solving.  Even the things you&#x27;ve only learned an hour before.  Don&#x27;t<br>
worry about how long it takes you to remember the alg.  Just do it. <br>
The more you force yourself to actively use them, the better you will<br>
get at them.  Practice.<br>
<br>
The final six edges is a very important step.  Learn the algs to<br>
orient the cases as well as you possibly can.  They should be second<br>
nature.  You need to be able to perform the ones for the longest cases<br>
 (all edges oriented wrong) in under 3 seconds. Also, work on finding<br>
good ways to place the UR and UL edges as you&#x27;re finishing orienting<br>
so that it becomes one fluid step.  This may take a while (it was the<br>
hardest part for me).<br>
<br>
After you&#x27;ve got all this down, move on to the third method for<br>
recognizing the last six edges, and learn the special cases.  There<br>
are only 26 or so, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too bad.  But sub 20 is<br>
definitely possible without them, so don&#x27;t give up.<br>

If you pay attention to what you do on a daily basis, your left hand

          <div class="email-content">Hi All,
I can do the 2 longest ones (in my mind) pretty fast is my cube 
doesn&#x27;t lock up, but the whle step is still pretty slow for me. I 
have tried reading the other 2 methods (I currently use #2), but I 
have had no luck at learning them. Perhaps I am missing something? 
I&#x27;ll go back and read them again this weekend and hopefully make some 
sense of them. 

I also have a few more plans for the weekend: Solve 2 3x3x3&#x27;s 
blindfolded and also start learing CLL which I have put off for so 
long. I figure having a long holiday break was a good time to 
start. :) Wish me luck!

          <div class="email-content">I think that for CFOP, the extended cross is always the way to go.<br>
<br>
I would pretty much always start with a 2x2 block and then finish the<br>
Xcross.  Usually I could see a 2x2x1 Block and build it, and then<br>
insert the last edge to make the 2x2. ANd THEN find the remaining 2<br>
edges and put them in to finish the X-cross.<br>
<br>
With the Roux method, you take it one step further.  You build a 2x2x1<br>
block, but instead of looking for just one edge to insert, you have to<br>
find 2 pieces.  Find an edge and a corner and pair them up an insert,<br>
to make a 3x2x1 block.  Or you can insert an edge or corner right<br>
away, and then find and insert the other piece.  Though i think that<br>
this is slower...<br>
<br>
Cross           4 pieces<br>
2x2 Block       4 pieces<br>
Extended Cross  6 pieces<br>
Gille&#x27;s Block   5 pieces<br>
<br>
Its harder than a cross or petrus block, but easier than DIRECTLy<br>
solving for X-cross.  <br>
<br>
FOR ALL YOU ROUX SOLVERS<br>
<br>
<br>
For the 2nd Block, I always find the DR edge and insert as quickly as<br>
possible.  Then I just solve the 2 CE pairs with an all too familiar<br>
F2L strategy. <br>
Howerver, There are MANY shortcuts you can find by using the M slice.<br>
 A F2L style chart with algorithms would be twice as big for this<br>
method.  There are many more places that a Corner and an edge can be<br>
simultaneously.  I never used F2L charts to learn F2L. In ROUX and<br>
F2L, I think that Intuition is better.<br>
<br>
1. What color scheme do you guys use for ROux?  I use white and yellow<br>
blocks always, with red or orange on bottom.<br>
<br>
2. How fast can you guys do step 4?  Gilles told me that he uses<br>
Method 2 as his main method, and that a 4.5 sec avg is possible with<br>
this method alone. Im at about 7-8 Sec..<br>

Yeah, I think Dan said he solved his cube three times. And when I 
thought I had my cross solved, I saw that the white/red and 
white/orange edges were swapped and the white/green and white/blue 
edges weren&#x27;t even in the first layer. No clue how that happened, zero 
out of four is pretty bad I guess. I believe Jasmine&#x27;s solve was about 
25, mine about 28, and Dan&#x27;s maybe slightly over 30 but I&#x27;m not sure..

1. I solve white on bottom, yellow LL for my normal solving, so I just
carried that over with the Roux method.  I use the red and orange
sides for my blocks about 98% of the time.  There needs to be a
fantastic start on blue and green for me to use them.

2. I can do it in under 6 usually, but it all depends on the case. 
I&#x27;d like to know the number of possible cases for the final six edges
once they&#x27;re all oriented correctly, because I think that may be a way
to speed up the method.

3. Use COLL algs from wherever you find them, the www.speedcubing.com
algs, the Helmstetter algs, or from this site:

The 3x2x2?  It worked, but not well, and I recently broke the core.  
Must replace it with a better one, but the job is a bit fiddly.

Hehe..

In Holland, we have a commercial with cup stacking too! A commercial 
for KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken).. The tagline was &quot;Wow.. She is 
GOOD.. with cups! But we are good.. with chicken!&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t make any 
sense.

They actually had a section on their site where you could submit a 
video of yourself doing something you are good at... So of course, I 
submitted my speedcubing video too :)... They never used it, though.

There&#x27;s a $5,000 reward if you can find a *really* fast and comfortable 
sequence for the B2 case.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys..<br>
<br>
I was just playing around with the 4x4, and I found a nice way to <br>
flip three edges while fixing the OLL parity on the 4x4. It&#x27;s just <br>
the normal parity fix:<br>
<br>
(Rr)2 B2 U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)&#x27; B2 (Rr)2<br>
<br>
But when you add B&#x27;R&#x27; at the beginning, and RB at the end, <br>
you &#x27;flip&#x27; three edge groups. I am probably not the first person to <br>
think about this, but I&#x27;ve never seen this before..<br>

Thanks,
I&#x27;m looking for a sequence I can do 10 times in 20 seconds.
I&#x27;ve been trying this (R&#x27;FU2F&#x27;RFR&#x27;U2RF&#x27; or close friends) for years 
but R&#x27;FRF&#x27;LUL&#x27;F&#x27;LU&#x27;L&#x27;F still looks faster.

          <div class="email-content">Best time with the Alg i just post with little practise is: 2.26 
but all are under 3.00

i think with this one 10 times in 20 is hard because of the x
i think with some practice you get under 2

          <div class="email-content">Hey Alexander,

I&#x27;ve been using that same alg for some time now, only backwards.  Tell
me what you think of this.

I prefer this alg left handed, so I do it as:
L2 U L2 U L2 U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F L2 F&#x27; U F

And with finger tricks
[(L&#x27;)2 U (L&#x27;)2 (U) L2 (U&#x27;)] y (L&#x27; U&#x27; L) B2 (L&#x27; U L)

That first trigger takes some explanation, do the first (L&#x27;)2 U (L&#x27;)2
exactly as you would do L&#x27; U L&#x27; only with double turns instead of
quarter turns.  Then do the next U with your right index finger.  Then
do the L2 clockwise and then the next U&#x27; with your left ring finger.

This is all one long trigger, and is extraordinarily fast.  The last
part is pretty self explanatory.

Here&#x27;s an average for that alg
(2.20) 2.38 3.11 2.25 2.92 2.63 3.24 3.11 (3.50) 2.53 2.54 3.16 = 2.79

Also I just timed that first trigger (6 moves) and I got 1.18, 1.35,
1.06, 1.44, 1.08

The alg is really good when it&#x27;s done smoothly, and really bad when
it&#x27;s not done smoothly.  If you do the first trigger well then you
usually get a fast time.  If you lockup though then your execution
will be slow.  So I guess it&#x27;s not the best alg, but it&#x27;s one that
fits my hands pretty well.

My two cents, :-)
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I really can&#x27;t stress how important I think this should be to solving.<br>
 I know people have preferences for being able to recognize one color<br>
to speed things up.<br>
<br>
However, having said that I wrote a short page as an addendum to my<br>
extended cross section.  I feel the material on the page speaks for<br>
itself, so the page is simple.<br>
<br>
I just want to point out exactly why I am so strongly in favor of this<br>
strategy.  Even if you don&#x27;t use extended cross I very strongly ask<br>
you to consider still using opposite color solving.<br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/ec-oc.html<br>
<br>
It helps the odds of a good solve so much, that I no longer feel the<br>
color recognition gained from using the same color is enough.  I feel<br>
with practice, the slightly slower recognition could be overcome by<br>
the odds of getting a better solve this way.<br>
<br>
I will try not to be annoying about this, but please read the page and<br>
consider.<br>

Yes, members can see it. It is located at the bottom of the 
appropriate section, under the list of that section&#x27;s data.  I think 
a lot of this could be cleaned up. There are files in those sections 
of people solving, or a robot solving, and some are 5MB for one 
file. With the existence of strangepuzzle.com, I think we can move 
some of those file elsewhere and free up space for more appropriate 
material.  Who can do that, only the admin, the owner, both?  

Just a thought, anyway.

Hmm, why is notation important for this? I know for team blindsolving

you do &quot;write&quot; it down with the standard notation in your head?

          <div class="email-content">Yeah Chris, same here.  I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t read any of the books, and I&#x27;ve
only seen the first movie other than the new one.  I also saw it on
opening night though, since my girlfriend is a huge fan :-)  I did
like the movie though, it was definitely well done.

Maybe because it was designed so the most used keys are on your weak
hands side? Qwerty was to slow down typers, remember?

Start blocks with white or yellow on L and green on top.

I&#x27;m learning CLL with COLL-style recognition. Even though Gilles says
it&#x27;s bad practise :P

          <div class="email-content">    Dear Friends,<br>
   <br>
  First of all let me introduce my self.<br>
  My name is Konstantinos Verdes from Greece.<br>
  I am 30 years old and my profession is surveying engineering.<br>
   <br>
  I am the son of Panayiotis Verdes who is the inventor of the Olympicube range,<br>
  or better the NxNxN Cube.<br>
  My father profession, also, is surveying engineering and for 2+1/2 years the cube-puzzle designs and construction.<br>
   <br>
  For about 2 years i TRY to read your discussions about speedcubing.<br>
  I must tell that it was very difficult for me to catch you at the beginning.<br>
  You see i only Knew how to solve the 3x3x3 Rubiks Cube and that back to late 80s.<br>
  Now i can solve any size (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6) but not in the sense of speedcubing.<br>
  As you can imagine when my father told me about his invention i begun to search over the internet and then i found your really interesting and hardcore discussion group.<br>
  I must admit that you are all fantastic and i really enjoy trying to follow your mind.<br>
   <br>
  I think that i want to write sooooo much but I will try to answer as good as my poor English allows me, some subjects that this topic brings.<br>
   <br>

  &gt; Looking at Olympic Cubes&#x27; site and messages on       &gt; Twisty it won&#x27;t take very long anymore for the 6x6x6 &gt; to be available for the public.Personally I&#x27;m very &gt;excited about trying it out.<br>
&gt; Does anybody has an idea about how it&#x27;s going to be &gt;released? Will we be able to order it off the Olympic &gt; Cubes site?<br>
&gt; Also will the upcoming tournaments have 6x6x6 events? &gt;What will the<br>
&gt; top times be like for the 6x6x6 after say 2 months    &gt; of  release?<br>
<br>
<br>
  <br>
You are right Koen. The OlympiCube No6a will be available for the public soon-during the 2006.<br>
  You will be able to order it through our web-site which by the way will change completely during the next 5-6 months. You will also be able to find it in many stores, that i cannot tell it yet.<br>
  I dont know yet if the OlympiCube No6a will be include in yours events but i am sure that in the future we will also organize same events-open to any kind of cube i.e Rubiks-Mefferts-Eastsheen-Olympicubes and let the athletes decide.<br>
  As far for the time i cannot tell much. I solve the OlympiCube No6a in about 15-20 minutes using beginners techniques.<br>
  I am sure that all of you laughing with that time.<br>
  Also i dont Know which cube will be better for speedcubing the No6a or the No6b because we havent constructed the last one YET.<br>

  Game of Death wrote:<br>
  &gt; I&#x27;d imagine there&#x27;s a further problem which is that   &gt; the cube is probably less stable and <br>
&gt; more likely to break up/lock up at speed. The pieces &gt; will be smaller and even if the <br>
&gt; overlap problem is solved an increase in the number  &gt; of slices means the cube is more likely to jam.<br>
   <br>
  &gt; Chris wrote:<br>
  &gt; There is another practical problem.  If the cube is  &gt; expensive, and<br>
&gt; replacement parts are not available, what happens if &gt; by speedcubing<br>
&gt; you break it?<br>
&gt; You would need to make replacement parts if the      &gt; internals are as<br>
&gt; delicate as they sound, and if those are expensive   &gt; you have a whole<br>
&gt; other issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
   <br>
   The OlympiCube No 6a is very stable. Much more than all the Known cubes of any size. I know that you are crazy and the meaning of stability to you maybe is different than the other common people, but if i think the other cubes that i have in hands then the surprise directly when you open the box of the OlympiCube No6a will be huge.<br>
  As far as it depends the replacing parts we will discuss it when the time comes and we will sure find a solution. But I assure you that the internals are not fragile-delicates and i dont think that you will easily break a piece. The pops also dont happen while i speedscrambling the cube. <br>
  I must also want to tell in public that i already talked -off the record-with two Champions Frank Morris and Per Kristen Fredlund<br>
  and we will invite them to video-test the OlympiCube No5, the OlympiCube No6a and the OlympiCube No7 during 2006.<br>
  The price of these products will be quite reasonable and approachable for such monsters but i cant tell it yet.<br>
   <br>
  The OlympiCube invention is patented in Greece and patented pending in 21 countries+European Union, that is the the three quarters of the Known world. We follow successfully all the necessary legal steps and we will also start the trademark procedure during the next month.<br>
  I may show you our logo soon.<br>
   <br>
  Finally i would like to invite anyone who thinks that is able to write solutions ( for beginners, for intermediate and for experts) for the 5x5x5, 6x6x6 and the 7x7x7 for our webpage and for our packages-manuals to e-mail me in konstantinos@....<br>
  Of course we will pay him/them for the services and their names will appear in the website-manuals.  <br>
  Please feel free to ask-answer me anything either in public, either in private.<br>

Geez, Tyson, please please tell me you only do it for the money, the 
fame or spreading cubing, but not for meeting chicks who think the 
square root of 100 is 5 or who claim their IQ is 3000. Or do they 
maybe just pretend to be dumb because that&#x27;s a requirement for them to 
get into that show?

Cheers!

P.S. Reminds me I once saw a documentation on TV where a guy in a real 
job interview was asked &quot;14 out of 100 persons don&#x27;t understand 
percentages, how many percent are that?&quot; and he couldn&#x27;t find an 
answer...

I really really do hope I can get some soon. But in June 2004 they 
said we&#x27;d be able to buy them 3 months later. Well, in the meantime 
they&#x27;ve shown some real ones in public so I hope now it&#x27;s finally 
getting really close, though I don&#x27;t count on it yet.

Cheers!

I really really do hope I can get some soon. But in June 2004 they 
said we&#x27;d be able to buy them 3 months later. Well, in the meantime 
they&#x27;ve shown some real ones in public so I hope now it&#x27;s finally 
getting really close, though I don&#x27;t count on it yet.

Cheers!

Dear Friends,
   
  First of all let me introduce my self.
  My name is Konstantinos Verdes from Greece.
  I am 30 years old and my profession is surveying engineering.
   
  I am the son of Panayiotis Verdes who is the inventor of the Olympicube range,
  or better the NxNxN Cube.
  My father profession, also, is surveying engineering and for 2+1/2 years the cube-puzzle designs and construction.
   
  For about 2 years i TRY to read your discussions about speedcubing.
  I must tell that it was very difficult for me to catch you at the beginning.
  You see i only Knew how to solve the 3x3x3 Rubiks Cube and that back to late 80s.
  Now i can solve any size (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6) but not in the sense of speedcubing.
  As you can imagine when my father told me about his invention i begun to search over the internet and then i found your really interesting and hardcore discussion group.
  I must admit that you are all fantastic and i really enjoy trying to follow your mind.
   
  I think that i want to write sooooo much but I will try to answer as good as my poor English allows me, some subjects that this topic brings.

You are right Koen. The OlympiCube No6a will be available for the public soon-during the 2006.
  You will be able to order it through our web-site which by the way will change completely during the next 5-6 months. You will also be able to find it in many stores, that i cannot tell it yet.
  I dont know yet if the OlympiCube No6a will be include in yours events but i am sure that in the future we will also organize same events-open to any kind of cube i.e Rubiks-Mefferts-Eastsheen-Olympicubes and let the athletes decide.
  As far for the time i cannot tell much. I solve the OlympiCube No6a in about 15-20 minutes using beginners techniques.
  I am sure that all of you laughing with that time.
  Also i dont Know which cube will be better for speedcubing the No6a or the No6b because we havent constructed the last one YET.

   The OlympiCube No 6a is very stable. Much more than all the Known cubes of any size. I know that you are crazy and the meaning of stability to you maybe is different than the other common people, but if i think the other cubes that i have in hands then the surprise directly when you open the box of the OlympiCube No6a will be huge.
  As far as it depends the replacing parts we will discuss it when the time comes and we will sure find a solution. But I assure you that the internals are not fragile-delicates and i dont think that you will easily break a piece. The pops also dont happen while i speedscrambling the cube. 
  I must also want to tell in public that i already talked -off the record-with two Champions Frank Morris and Per Kristen Fredlund
  and we will invite them to video-test the OlympiCube No5, the OlympiCube No6a and the OlympiCube No7 during 2006.
  The price of these products will be quite reasonable and approachable for such monsters but i cant tell it yet.
   
  The OlympiCube invention is patented in Greece and patented pending in 21 countries+European Union, that is the the three quarters of the Known world. We follow successfully all the necessary legal steps and we will also start the trademark procedure during the next month.
  I may show you our logo soon.
   
  Finally i would like to invite anyone who thinks that is able to write solutions ( for beginners, for intermediate and for experts) for the 5x5x5, 6x6x6 and the 7x7x7 for our webpage and for our packages-manuals to e-mail me in konstantinos@....
  Of course we will pay him/them for the services and their names will appear in the website-manuals.  
  Please feel free to ask-answer me anything either in public, either in private.
   
  Thanks
Konstantinos

          <div class="email-content">Those improvements alone will already encourage me to keep my times 
more updated. You know, when I improved my master magic record from 2.
68 to 2.67 I didn&#x27;t submit it because I thought this very small 
improvement is not worth bothering Ron with extra work.

Thanks Lars and Ron!

Some further suggestions:

- Show all records of a certain person, including the rank in each 
category.

- Make it show N last posts and let us choose N other than 50.

- Show last N posts that got into the top T in their category and let 
us choose T. Because to be honest, I&#x27;m not interested in a guy I don&#x27;t 
know who just broke 2 minutes with the 3x3.

Hi Konstantinos,

No, it&#x27;s just that last year I was very excited to hear about your new 
cubes and when you said we could buy them very soon I got even more 
excited, and then those dates passed by and we didn&#x27;t hear much from 
you about the progress. Maybe you need to be a hardcore cuber to 
imagine how hard it is having to wait for such a puzzle ;-). And in 
those 23 years is was not hard because we weren&#x27;t really waiting for 
it...

So now I&#x27;m just a bit more realistic. I know from myself that I want 
to do so many things and optimally I&#x27;d finish and publish them 
yesterday, but everything always takes longer than expected. And in 
your case, it doesn&#x27;t even depend only on you, since you probably have 
to wait for those patent stuff etc.

I certainly want to be among the first who order your 6x6 and larger, 
watching the video and mechanism pictures they look very good, and I 
want to be the first who solves a 6x6 blindfolded :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Chris, general question: How do you time individual executions?

I only do that with video analysis but that&#x27;s too much work. Normally 
I just do several executions in a row and divide the time by the 
number of executions.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

I time like I do the magic sort of.  I start with the cube in my hands
and JNetcube set to 0 seconds countdown.  I press and hold the
spacebar and when I&#x27;m ready I let go, do the alg, then hit the
spacebar again.

So I start and end with the cube in my hand.  It&#x27;s fairly close to
just timing the alg itself I think.

I have tried to do the alg several times in a row and divide, but I
tend to prefer timing it individually.  I don&#x27;t really know why.

Ok can anyone beat 3 moves to solve two pairs? :-D  Well 3 moves STM

Great to hear news directly from the mouth of the greek oracles ;-) 
But if &quot;soon&quot; is &quot;any&quot; time in 2006 and not early 2006 there is 
still quite some time before their cube(s) become available. Cool to 
hear again that i will become a video star. Let&#x27;s hope im less 
nervous doing that shooting than i am at competitions :D

Oh, and about Olympicube no 5. Will there not be a conflict with the 
copyright of the original Udo Krell design. Or has that issue 
already been sorted out legally??

Cheers!

your face :-)

And yes, mine is still more beautiful because the pairs aren&#x27;t built 
yet at the start. If you just look at it and don&#x27;t see the solution 
yet, it looks like a very annoying ugly case where you first have to 
pull out an F2L piece out of a wrong slot. But then it magically and 
surprisingly has a really nice solution. That&#x27;s why yours and Bob&#x27;s 
case don&#x27;t fit under the subject of this thread, your algs qualify for 
&quot;nice&quot; but not for &quot;ugly turned&quot; ;-)

<br>
Nice report. :-)<br>
It was great meeting you.<br>
<br>
I would love to see the cube revival also continue in India.<br>
There are a lot of smart guys like you, who may one day be world champion.<br>
The cube is in good hands with you and the other Indian cubers (including<br>
John and Bernett). You already taught 20 people how to solve. And these<br>
people can teach others.<br>
Please continue your plans of organising a competition. First try a small<br>
unofficial one. With that experience organise an official one and then the<br>
big one. WCA will help you in any way we can.<br>
<br>
Thanks for everything.<br>
See you again in december. Maybe at the campus of IIT? For a small<br>
competition?<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I don&#x27;t exactly mind people pushing the prize :-)

To Clancy: congrats for winning that other game cube! If you&#x27;d like 
some springs I use for game cubes then I can send you some. They&#x27;re 
expensive in small quantities and get much cheaper when you buy lots, 
that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve bought 450 of them. If you want to buy a lot, too, 
then I can tell you their data and you can try find a supplier closer 
to you, I bought mine directly from a manufacturer. Slowly but surely 
I&#x27;m running out of them, though, since I use them for many puzzles 
(mostly 3x3 and Megaminx). The holes inside the centers are very 
small, so you need very tiny washers. I took Megaminx washers and cut 
them smaller (they&#x27;re plastic). I put it on a surface, then cut the 
sides by pressing down a sharp knife. First the circle becomes a 
square, then an octagon, then a 16-gon, which is close enough to a 
circle. I&#x27;m also getting closer to getting lots of small nylon washers 
for a very good price, will mention this soon again (I found a very 
good supplier but minimum order is 100 Euros). Hmm, &quot;do the tiles or 
the whole centercap have to be pulled off&quot;? There are no separate 
centercaps, the tiles *are* the (center)caps. I&#x27;d suggest in order to 
change the color scheme you first get the 6 center tiles off, since 
they&#x27;re easiest (tiles on edges and corners might be glued to the 
piece on their bottom, quite silly). Then switch the necessary 8 more 
tiles.

Cheers!
Stefan

Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t need to get to 26.

F  R  F  B&#x27; D&#x27; R  B  R&#x27; B&#x27; L  D2 F  D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; B  L&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F   (24q*)

So it takes 20 moves HTM and 24 moves QTM.

At least it seems impossible to achieve that in the half turn

other ideas and the time to find something ...

Maybe someone could play around with the cube explorer??

I like it, because you don&#x27;t have to rotate the cube.
But as with many other sequences in 14-15 QTM moves, a series of 10 
take me about 25s.

Another one:
RUR&#x27;U2y&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RU2x&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;

Hi, I&#x27;ve got a game cube here that I&#x27;ve been using a fair bit lately.
I&#x27;ve actually drilled the peg holes out in the centres to make for 
easy acsess for adjustment. I&#x27;m not familiar with competition rules 
cos I&#x27;ve never had the opportunity to compete but I&#x27;m curious if this 
would break any rules at all?

Also, would it be possible to use different screws for finer 
adjustments without damaging/stripping the kernel?


Thanks, Keith.

Hey, it&#x27;s always the same old sequence ;-)
Usually I don&#x27;t care about writing sophisticated fingertricks or cube

Completed it once by luck. Kiss my a**. If it was lucky it might 
have been cause there is just a small final bit of the solution 
which is not clear. In this case the person should be able to do 
it &quot;by luck&quot; again (and again) with some work. And then finally 
understand it all. If the whole thing was by luck i absolutely can&#x27;t 
believe it. Oh well ...

Man, that hurts watching it. So close. I can see you flipped those 
tiles and somehow they flipped back. But hey, stop it! Seriously, I 
finally want to focus on the cubes so don&#x27;t make me start with the 
magics again... in your 3.12 average quote you promised you&#x27;d quit :-)

Cheers!

Hehe.. Another nice property: it&#x27;s the only algorithm (not being an 
identity-alg) that commutes with everything.

What about an alg that rotates all centers by the same amount? :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve some very bad news :<br>
I&#x27;m going to have to have a medical surgery at my left ring ringer<br>
because of speed (hardcore ?) cubing. I don&#x27;t know the word in english<br>
but in french it&#x27;s called a &quot;kist&quot; or &quot;quiste sur le tendon&quot; (I don&#x27;t<br>
even know how it&#x27;s written). But it&#x27;s basically a problem of over-use<br>
of a tendon.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t have to fix it right now.<br>
Actually it&#x27;s still too small and it doesn&#x27;t hurt me so there is no<br>
need to remove it now. But it will grow and eventually start to hurt<br>
(and making it harder to use that finger).<br>
<br>
The biggest problem is that after that surgery, I won&#x27;t be able to use<br>
that hand for a while. So I think I&#x27;ll focus on one-handed cubing<br>
(right handed) and blindfolded cubing and maybe on fewest moves also.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to let you know.<br>
But I don&#x27;t stop cubing, I&#x27;ll just stop speeding it for a while.<br>
<br>
Gilles.<br>

I hope you can reach your original speed after the surgery too, or
else theres always the one handed thing as you mentioned.

Hope your surgery goes well.

I think it&#x27;s a great idea. Actually I have already tried it and I&#x27;m
also pretty sure that it can helps.
Athough the best thing is of course the possibility to start on any
colour, but that requires a lot of mental training + I&#x27;m not yet sure
that 15 seconds is enough to preinspect 6 different crosses.

I invite anyone to try this :-)

Well, if it makes you feel any better, in September 2001 (4 months
after I started cubing), I broke my hand playing football.  I had it
casted, but I still kept speedcubing and I even broke my personal best
after a few weeks.  (See speedcubing.com and look for fastest time
with hand in a cast).  The 44 second time there was my fastest ever,
so it really boosted my confidence.  Speedcuibing is possible even
with injuries. :)

I&#x27;ll surely try keeping small unofficial competitions at the start and
then hopefully we can move to something better.

I&#x27;ll see if we can have a competition while you are around, that&#x27;ll be great!

Hey Tyson,

they&#x27;ll match you up with some girl, right? How about you give her 
this shirt?

If I understand the concept of the show correctly, she won&#x27;t notice :

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Anyone got a good way to write PHIL around the cube?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Something like this:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; xx- x-x -x- x--<br>
&gt; xx- xxx -x- x--<br>
&gt; x-- x-x -x- xxx<br>
<br>
Can&#x27;t be done.  Let&#x27;s start off with a definite color arrangement (in <br>
math terms, &quot;without loss of generality&quot;).  Say, a normal white-opp-<br>
yellow cube with the yellow center on top and the &quot;P&quot; is made up of <br>
blue squares.  Then the &quot;H&quot; has to be red, the &quot;I&quot; green and the &quot;L&quot;, <br>
by virtue of the center being orange, CANNOT be orange.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s think about what the left side of the &quot;P&quot; must be made of.  <br>
Well, both blue-red corners are already used on the &quot;H&quot; side, so the <br>
corners of the left side of the &quot;P&quot; must both be blue-orange.  Now <br>
which corner is at the bottom of the &quot;P&quot;?  It can&#x27;t be the blue-<br>
orange-white corner, because then part of the &quot;L&quot; would be orange.  <br>
So it must be the blue-orange-yellow corner.  That means the lower-<br>
right corner of the &quot;L&quot; - and hence the entire &quot;L&quot; - must be yellow.<br>
<br>
We need three yellow corners to make the &quot;L&quot;.  But guess what: both <br>
red-yellow corners are already on the opposite &quot;H&quot; side, so there&#x27;s <br>
no way to get the three yellows we need.  Sorry PHIL, but you ain&#x27;t <br>
gonna happen.<br>

It&#x27;s not actually that bad (I found the englsh word : a cyst) at the<br>
moment, but it could turn really bad if I continue cubing like this<br>

want that problem to interfere with my studies.<br>
(Even though going to the world championship did interfere and made me<br>
absent for one week :p).<br>

Does that mean you took the cube apart for building the pattern 
instead of twisting it? In that case... cheater!! :-)

Yes, lol!  It was my white-yellow cube, which is very powdery inside,

Hmm, I just noticed it&#x27;s right next to one of Ashrita Furman&#x27;s

          <div class="email-content">Introduction: This tutorial assumes that the reader already understands <br>
the basic concepts of cube notation and algorithms.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The idea of solving a Rubik’s Cube while blindfolded sounds <br>
intimidating, but with proper methods, the tasks is easily accomplished <br>
by anyone. For the blindfold solve, the solver memorizes the initial <br>
configuration of the cube. After the memorization is completed, the <br>
solver then proceeds to solve the cube without looking at it again.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
It is very difficult, and probably impossible by all but few, to <br>
actually keep track of all 20 stickers that shift when one turns a <br>
single face of the cube. Instead, the basic idea of blindfold solving <br>
is to solve the cube in very small portions, only two or three pieces <br>
at a time, thus reducing the need for continual updates of your “mental <br>
picture.”<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The Idea: This method of blindfold solving takes place in two main <br>
steps. First, the pieces are all oriented. Then, the pieces are all <br>
permuted. Orientation is done first so that when the pieces are <br>
permuted into their proper locations, they end up facing the right way.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Setting Up The Cube: Unlike regular solving, blindfold solving is most <br>
easily done with the same center faces on top and in front at all <br>
times. The colors, as always, are arbitrary. World record holder, Leyan <br>
Lo, for example always solves with the yellow face on top and the blue <br>
face in front. Shotaro Makisumi, with his Japanese color-scheme cube, <br>
solves with the blue face on top and the green face in front. I <br>
personally solve with the white face on top and the green face in <br>
front. For this tutorial, I will explain how to solve the cube <br>
blindfolded while setting the white face on top and the green face in <br>
front while using a cube with the American color-scheme (white opposite <br>
of yellow).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
For many blindfold solvers, numbering the pieces is a good tool that <br>
assists in the memorization of the cube state. Numbers, like colors, <br>
are completely arbitrary. There is no difference between permuting <br>
corners (3, 5, 7) and permuting corners (llama, walrus, duck). Like the <br>
color orientation, go with whatever works for you.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Orienting the Corners: First, we must orient all the pieces. This <br>
tutorial explains corner orientation before edge orientation. However, <br>
it should be noted that the order in which these processes are done is <br>
irrelevant. As long as the pieces are oriented before they are <br>
permuted, you will be fine. If it is more comfortable to orient the <br>
edges first, go ahead and do it that way.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The idea is that we want to orient all the corners without affecting <br>
their placement or any of the edges. In blindfold cubing, there are a <br>
variety of algorithms that one can use. The more algorithms one knows, <br>
the more options a solver has. This tutorial will present three methods <br>
of orienting corners.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, we want to orient the corners in such a manner that when we apply <br>
the permutation algorithms, the end up in the correct orientation.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Note that every corner will have a white or a yellow sticker. This <br>
should be fairly obvious: the cube consists of 8 corners. Four of the <br>
corners are on the top, and since our top color is white, four of them <br>
will have white stickers. Similarly, four of the corners are on the <br>
bottom, and since our bottom color is yellow, those four corners will <br>
have yellow stickers. Since white and yellow or opposite colors, no <br>
corner can have both a yellow and a white sticker.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
At the end of the orientation, we want all corners on the top layer to <br>
have white or yellow stickers facing up. On the bottom layer, we want <br>
all corners to have white or yellow stickers facing down.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Scramble a cube, and notice that some of the corners are already <br>
correctly oriented—they have yellow or white stickers facing directly <br>
up or down. Many of the corners will require a twist for this to <br>
happen. Not the same corners require clockwise twists, and other <br>
corners require counter-clockwise twists.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
On a solved cube, perform the algorithm (L’ U’ L U’ L’ U2 L)(R U R’ U R <br>
U2 R’). You’ll notice that the algorithm twists two corners in the top <br>
layer. The bottom right corner is rotated clockwise, whereas the top <br>
right corner is rotated counter-clockwise.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, perform the exact inverse of that algorithm: (R U2 R’ U’ R U’ <br>
R’)(L’ U2 L U L’ U L). You’ll notice that that algorithm solves the two <br>
twisted corners in the top layer. More specifically, the bottom right <br>
corner is twisted counter-clockwise and the top right is twisted <br>
clockwise.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Experiment with the mirror images of these algorithms. (R U R’ U R U2 <br>
R’) (L’ U’ L U’ L’ U2 L)and (L’ U2 L U L’ U L) (R U2 R’ U’ R U’ <br>
R’)should do similar things, but to the top left and bottom left <br>
corners in the top layer.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, experiment with the following algorithm B2 (L’ U’ L U’ L’ U2 L)(R <br>
U R’ U R U2 R’) B2. You’ll notice that it twists the bottom right <br>
corner in the top layer clockwise and the top left corner in the bottom <br>
layer counter-clockwise. B2is what we call a “setup move.” While <br>
orienting the cube, we can perform any setup moves necessary to <br>
position the pieces. First, perform the setup move. Then, perform the <br>
algorithm. Finally, reverse the setup move. Setup moves are used to <br>
bring other pieces into locations such that we may act on them with the <br>
algorithm. Experiment with a variety of setup moves, and gradually <br>
familiarize yourself with corner orientation.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
With the provided algorithms and a couple of setup moves, you should be <br>
able to orient all the corners of the cube. Make sure you familiarize <br>
yourself with the algorithms and that you understand exactly what they <br>
do. Try orienting all the corners of a scrambled cube. I will now <br>
explain another method of orienting corners.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
This method of orienting corners requires slightly more intuition, but <br>
is very powerful. Try the following algorithm on a solved cube: R’ (D R <br>
D’ R’ D R) U’ R’ (D’ R D R’ D’ R) U. Understanding exactly what this <br>
algorithm does is essential to its application. First of all, you’ll <br>
notice that this algorithm twists two corners in the top layer. The <br>
bottom right corner is twisted clockwise and the bottom left corner is <br>
twisted counter-clockwise.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The mechanism of this algorithm is very powerful. The first R’places <br>
the bottom right corner in the top layer into the bottom layer. The <br>
next part,(D R D’ R’ D R), twists the corner while creating some junk <br>
on the bottom layer as well. U’ R’moves the bottom left corner in the <br>
top layer into the bottom layer and(D’ R D R’ D’ R)twists that corner <br>
counter-clockwise while reversing the junk on the bottom. Uthen <br>
reverses theU’move which moved the corner over in the first place.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The fundamental moves in this corner orientation method are (D R D’ R’ <br>
D R)and(D’ R D R’ D’ R). The first one performs clockwise twists while <br>
the second one performs counter-clockwise twists. Now, attempt the <br>
algorithmR’ (D’ R D R’ D’ R) U’ R’ (D R D’ R’ D R) U. You will notice <br>
that the sections in parentheses are reversed, and so is the effect on <br>
the corners. The corner that was previously twisted clockwise is now <br>
twisted counter-clockwise and vice versa. Now attempt the algorithmR’ <br>
(D R D’ R’ D R) U2 R’ (D’ R D R’ D’ R) U2. You will notice that this <br>
algorithm is the same as the first, except there is aU2move instead of <br>
aU’. The effect is that it twists the diagonal corners instead. Notice <br>
how theU2moves brings the diagonal corner into position and then <br>
theR’move pushes it into the bottom layer.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, try the following algorithm: R’ (D R D’ R’ D R D’) U’ R’ (D R D’ <br>
R’ D R D’) U’ R’ (D R D’ R’ D R D’) U2. First, notice that the portions <br>
of the algorithm in the parentheses are all identical. Next, notice <br>
that those portion are the same as the fundamental clock-wise twist <br>
algorithms, but with an addedD’at the end. Now, notice that the <br>
firstR’pushes a corner into the bottom layer. The part in the <br>
parenthesis twists the corner clockwise. U’ R’moves the next corner <br>
over and we also twist it clockwise. We repeat this a third time, and <br>
finally,U2puts all the corners back in their original locations. The <br>
algorithm has twisted three corners all clockwise. Attempt the same <br>
thing, but substitute(D’ R D R’ D’ R D)into the algorithm to perform a <br>
counter-clockwise three-cycle.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
For the advanced blindfold solver, algorithms such as [(R U R’ U’)(R U2 <br>
R’ U2)]x2,[(R U2 R’ U2)(R U R’ U’)]x2, and their inverses can be very <br>
powerful. Other multi-corner orientation algorithms exist as well but <br>
they should not be attempted until the solver is fully comfortable with <br>
the basic set of algorithms.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
With these tools and a combination of setup moves, you should now be <br>
able to orient all of the corners of the cube. Attempt to orient all <br>
the corners of the cube with your eyes open. Then, attempt to memorize <br>
the corner orientation of the cube and try to orient them <br>
blindfolded. Memorizing the corner orientation should not be too <br>
difficult, but if you need assistance, please see the next section.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, all the corners should be oriented. Again, this means that only <br>
white or yellow stickers on the corners point directly up or down. Keep <br>
in mind that throughout this procedure, it is imperative that you are <br>
aware of the locations of your top and front sides.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Memorizing: Everyone has his own memorization techniques. I will <br>
present the techniques that I use, but sometimes techniques that you <br>
develop on your own will ultimately be more powerful. Everyone’s mind <br>
works differently.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You’ll notice that I included two different methods of orienting the <br>
corners. I personally use both of them. Leyan and Macky only use the <br>
second one. Corner orientation is the last thing I memorize. I memorize <br>
the steps in reverse order of the actual solve. When you have adjacent <br>
pairs that need to be twisted clockwise and counter-clockwise, there <br>
are two different shapes. In one of them, the two stickers of interest, <br>
in this case, yellow or white, will be on the same side. For other <br>
cases, they’ll be facing away from each other. Sometimes, it is easier <br>
for me to remember what algorithm to apply rather than which way the <br>
piece wants to be twisted. Different methods of doing certain things on <br>
a blindfold solve act as tools. You can solve the cube with very few <br>
tools, but the more things you understand how to execute, the more ways <br>
you can do them, and the more choices you have. Sometimes, one choice <br>
will be more convenient than the other.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Other memorization techniques that people do involve memorizing numbers <br>
for the corners. I personally do not do that, but it should be easy to <br>
see how this is done. Simply assign an ordering to the corners and then <br>
memorize the state of each corner.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Memorizing the overall shape of the cube state can be a powerful <br>
tool. However, always remember that I’m not right, and that you should <br>
experiment.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Orienting the Edges: This step is very easy and many people consider <br>
this to be easier than orienting the corners. Leyan Lo performs this <br>
step first on the cube whereas Macky and I do this second after the <br>
corner orientation. Again, it doesn’t matter which one you do first.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The idea is that we are orienting the edges in such a manner that when <br>
we execute the edge permutation step, all of the edges are facing the <br>
correct way. Unlike permutation moves, setup moves during orientation <br>
have no restrictions. I will outline the restriction for permutation <br>
moves when we get there.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The most difficult thing of the edge orientation is recognizing which <br>
edges are oriented incorrectly. With edge orientations, we consider the <br>
top, bottom, front, and back colors. On my cube, white is my top, <br>
yellow is my bottom, green is my front, and blue is my back. Below are <br>
several criteria that indicate a correct edge. I will explain the logic <br>
for this later.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If an edge is in the top player, it is correctly oriented if the top or <br>
bottom color is facing upwards. If the yellow or white sticker is <br>
facing upwards, then the edge is correct. This applies to the bottom <br>
layer as well. If the white or yellow sticker is facing directly <br>
downwards, the edge is oriented correctly.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If the edge is in the top layer, it is correctly oriented if the green <br>
or blue sticker is facing off to the side. If a green or blue sticker <br>
is facing directly upwards, then it is incorrectly oriented. The same <br>
applies for the bottom layer. If the blue or green sticker is facing to <br>
the side, then it is correctly oriented.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If the edge is in the middle layer, it is correctly oriented if the <br>
white or yellow sticker faces to the side. If the white or yellow <br>
sticker faces the front or the back, then it is incorrectly oriented.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If the edge is in the middle layer, it is correctly oriented if the <br>
green or blue stickers faces the front or the back. It is incorrectly <br>
oriented if the green or blue sticker faces to the side.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Why are these the rules for orienting edges? When we permute edges, we <br>
will be limiting ourselves to R2andL2double turn setup moves where as <br>
theU,D,F, andBfaces are free to move however. For an edge with a white <br>
sticker in the middle layer, you will notice that if the white sticker <br>
faces to the side, we can bring it to the top layer and have the white <br>
sticker face directly up with one of the setup moves. However, if the <br>
white sticker faces in front, the setup moves that we are allowed to <br>
use will never be able to move the edge so that the white sticker is on <br>
top. The same logic is applied to all edges.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, we will experiment with the algorithms. I use two main algorithms, <br>
but there are many edge orientation algorithms available, and as <br>
always, the more you know, the more choices you have. The main <br>
algorithm switches two opposite edges in the top layer. Perform the <br>
move (M’ U M’ U M’ U2)(M U M U M U2)on a solved cube. You’ll notice <br>
that it switches the near and far edges in the top layer. M’,for me, <br>
moves in the same direction asL’. However, you should notice <br>
thatM’andMare interchangeable in this algorithm. It does not matter <br>
which way you move the middle slice first as long as you switch <br>
directions in the middle. Furthermore, theUcan be easily substituted <br>
with aU’. It does not matter; the algorithm is symmetric. I personally <br>
preferU’because I am right handed, and so I allow my right hand to <br>
perform the sliceMmove and my left index finger to do theU’move.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, try doing a setup move with this algorithm. Try the setup move L’ <br>
B’, perform the algorithm, and then conclude withB L. Notice <br>
thatL’B’moves the top left edge into the position formerly occupied by <br>
the top back edge. BLsimply reverses the setup move. Try a variety of <br>
setup moves such asB2or even a cube rotation. As long as you reverse <br>
your setup move, everything will be as you expect it.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, try a four-edge flipper. The following algorithm will flip all <br>
four edges in the top layer. (M’ U M’ U M’ U M’ U)(M U M U M U M <br>
U). Notice how it flips all four edges. Again, realize thatM’andMare <br>
interchangeable as with before. Furthermore, realize that I am right <br>
handed and that I preferU’overU. As with before, experiment with some <br>
setup moves and familiarize yourself with this algorithm.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
There are other algorithms available. Certain algorithms will flip six, <br>
eight, or even all twelve edges. However, I feel that these two <br>
algorithms are sufficient as almost all possible cube states can be <br>
reduced to just several applications of the above algorithms. <br>
 Experiment with only the first half of the four-edge flipper and see <br>
what it does. Finally, experiment with this one: M2 U M U2 M’ U M’ U M’ <br>
U2 M U M’. A list of algorithms will be provided at the end.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Memorizing: Again, if you prefer, one can memorize the edge orientation <br>
state with numbers by simply ordering the numbers and then by <br>
remembering a string a binary digits. I personally prefer to just <br>
visualize where the incorrectly oriented edges are. Frequently, instead <br>
of memorizing which edges need to be corrected, I will memorize the <br>
algorithms necessary to correct them. This is very fast as I can <br>
execute the algorithm without even thinking about the edges that I’m <br>
affecting.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Here’s an example. Let’s say I see three edges that need to be <br>
corrected on the top and one edge that needs to be corrected on the <br>
bottom. Instead of memorizing which edges are incorrectly flipped, I <br>
will memorize the setup move D R2or something similar. Then, I will <br>
perform the setup move, apply the four-edge flipping algorithm, and <br>
then reverse the algorithm. There are many ways to memorize the cube, <br>
so by all means just do whatever works for you.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Corner Permutation: All your edges should be oriented now. Now, we will <br>
put all the corners in their correct place. For this step, I have <br>
numbered my corners to assist in the recognition of the cycles. There <br>
is no standard numbering convention. Macky, Leyan, and I all do it <br>
differently.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Start with your first corner location. For me, this is the top, front, <br>
right corner.  For Leyan, it’s the top, front, left, and he holds the <br>
world record, so maybe you should listen to him. If your first corner <br>
is correct, more specifically that the piece that belongs there <br>
actually is there, move on to your second corner. Otherwise, you will <br>
have a different corner in that location. Look at the corner in that <br>
location, and go to the position where that corner belongs. Since that <br>
corner is in your first location, it cannot be where it <br>
belongs. Therefore, there will be another piece in that location. Look <br>
at where that corner wants to go, and go to the next corner position on <br>
the cube. Continue this until you find the corner that belongs in the <br>
first position, then stop. That’s a cycle. If you have accounted for <br>
all eight corners, then you are done. Otherwise, you will need to go to <br>
the next corner position that has not been visited by the previous <br>
cycle, and continue again.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Let’s make slot A our “first” corner position. Suppose corner B is in <br>
slot A. We then take a look at corner B’s desired position. In corner <br>
B’s position, we have corner C. We look at C’s position, and we see <br>
D. We look at D’s position, and then we see E. When we look at E’s <br>
position, we see corner A, and so we stop, and we remember the cycle <br>
(ABCDE). It not necessary to memorize the cycles with letters or <br>
numbers. As long as you know where the cycle leads, it’s fine.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, we continue on our memorization, and we go to the corner position <br>
F. We see that in corner position F is corner position G, and we follow <br>
G to H, which leads us back to F, and so we have the cycle (FGH).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Occasionally, you will have cycles with an even number of elements such <br>
as (ABCD) or (EF) or (ABCDEFGH). If we have an even number of even <br>
cycles such as (AB), (CD), (EF), (GH), then there is no parity <br>
error. Otherwise, there is a parity error and I will discuss how to <br>
correct that later. First, we will deal with cycles of odd length.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
When we permute corners, we generally swap them three at a time. I will <br>
illustrate other algorithms later as well. Experiment with the <br>
algorithms (L F’ L B2 L’ F L B2 L2) and(R’ F R’ B2 R F’ R’ B2 <br>
R2). Notice that these two algorithms are mirror images and they both <br>
cycle three corners.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Notice that (R’ F R’ B2 R F’ R’ B2 R2)cycles the bottom right corner to <br>
the top left position, the top left corner to the top right position, <br>
and the top right corner to the bottom right position all in the top <br>
layer. Even more importantly, notice that the bottom left corner in the <br>
top layer is untouched.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Before we proceed, it is important to understand the restrictions of <br>
the setup moves. While permuting corners, only the UandDfaces may make <br>
single turns. TheF,L,B, andRfaces are restricted to double turns.<br>
<br>
<br>
Consider now that we want to solve the cycle (ABCDE). First, we want to <br>
deal with the corners A, B, and C. The most common situation is that <br>
you have one corner in one layer, and two adjacent corners in the other <br>
layer. This is nice, because we can put all three corners in the top <br>
layer easily. Generally, this can be accomplished by a double turn of <br>
one of the side faces. Sometimes, a D2is necessary to move the bottom <br>
corners away from the top corners. Notice,DandD’are acceptable setup <br>
moves, but sinceD2can solve every case, you might as well use it. It <br>
makes it easier to remember and you won’t make a mistake going the <br>
wrong direction.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now that all three corners are in the top layer, determine whether or <br>
not they wish to be cycled clockwise or counter-clockwise and choose <br>
the appropriate algorithm. If they want to cycle clockwise, you need to <br>
do the “right handed” algorithm.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Set up the three corners correctly. This is very easy if you remember <br>
the “blank” corner. One of the corners in the top layer does not need <br>
to be cycled. If we are doing the “right handed” algorithm, put this <br>
blank corner in the bottom left corner with a U,U’, orU2move. Then, do <br>
your algorithm, and reverse your setup moves. If it is a <br>
counter-clockwise cycle, then your blank corner goes in the bottom <br>
right corner.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
After you have cycled A, B, and C, you may eliminate B, and C from your <br>
string. Now, (ABCDE) becomes (ADE). Simple cycle (ADE) and you are done <br>
with that entire cycle. Do this until all corners are solved.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sometimes, you will have one corner in one layer, and you will have two <br>
corners situated diagonally from each other in the other layer. This <br>
makes the setup move more difficult. However, in my misunderstandings <br>
with Leyan, I have come up with a good way of solving these <br>
situations. Consider the cycle (ABC). A and B are in the to player. A <br>
is in the bottom right corner and B is in the top left corner. C is in <br>
the bottom layer directly below A.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, try to algorithm (R’ F R F’)x3where x3 means you repeat those <br>
moves three times. You will notice that corners A and C are swapped, B <br>
remains untouched, but the other two diagonal corners in the top layer <br>
are swapped.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The idea here is that were’ going to swap two corners, then we’ll swap <br>
the other two. In the process, the corners getting swapped diagonally <br>
will be swapped twice, and they will return to their original <br>
positions.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Remember, we want to swap A to B, B to C, and C to A. Since C wants to <br>
go to A, we apply the algorithm right away. Now, we do U2,which <br>
positions B in the location where A used to be, we do the algorithm <br>
again, and we’ve swapped (ABC). Remember to doU2again to undo your <br>
setup move. Because the corners in question are diagonal from each <br>
other, the setup moves in the middle of this algorithm are always <br>
double turns.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, consider the same situation, but consider the cycle (BAC). Here, C <br>
wants to go to position B. Therefore, we must perform U2first in order <br>
to place C in B’s position, and then we doU2and swap the others. Notice <br>
that we do not need aU2to reverse the setup move at the end. In this <br>
situation, we do not swap A and C first. A does want to go to C, but C <br>
is the lone corner, and if we swap A with C first, we will destroy it <br>
when we include the swap with B. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The same method can be applied if two corners are diagonally in the <br>
bottom, and the other corner is in the top layer. Think about which <br>
position the top layer corner wants to go, and do that swap first. Then <br>
do D2, and do the next swap, and then reverse your setup moves.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
In this process, it is sometimes necessary to position the corners with <br>
UorDmoves. Just make sure you reverse them when you’re done. There are <br>
other similar algorithms such as(R B’ R’ B)x3. They’re all basically <br>
the same.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now, we will discuss cycles of even length. How do we cycle (AB) and <br>
(CD)? Experiment with the algorithm (R’ F R’ B2 R F’ R’ B2 R2) U (L F’ <br>
L B2 L’ F L B2 L2) U’. Notice you do not have to memorize anything <br>
new. Notice that this algorithm swaps the bottom left corner with the <br>
bottom right corner and the top left corner with the top right corner.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
However, sometimes it may be difficult to perform the necessary setup <br>
moves in order to place the corners in this configuration. Instead, we <br>
can swap the corners in two steps using a T-permutation. This is very <br>
similar to Stefan Pochmann’s blindfold method.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Let’s say we want to cycle (AB) and (CD). First, we will cycle A and <br>
B. Put A and B into the top right and bottom right corners in the to <br>
player. However, when doing these setup moves, we do not want to <br>
disturb the left and right edges in the top layer. This can be <br>
accomplished by performing a UorDmove combined with aF2orB2. Now, <br>
perform the algorithm(R U R’ U’)(R’ F)(R2 U’)(R’ U’ R U F’). Now, you <br>
have successfully swapped corners A and B, but you have also swapped <br>
the left and right edges in the top layer. Reverse your setup moves, <br>
and now position C and D in the top right and bottom right corner <br>
positions, and do the algorithm again. You will swap C and D, and you <br>
will reverse the damage done to the edges.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Note, that a U2setup move will not damage your edges. Swapping the left <br>
and right edges is the same as the right and left. Sometimes, it is <br>
more convenient to swap the top right and bottom right corners, and <br>
then swap the top left and top right corners. This is also fine, but <br>
always keep in mind which edges are being swapped and be sure not to <br>
disturb them with your setup moves. If you do this, sometimes all four <br>
edges will be swapped. If this is the case, simply performM2 U M2 U2 M2 <br>
U M2and correct all four corners.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Memorizing: Being the numerically minded person that I am, I generally <br>
rely on the use of numbers to aid in my memorization. It should be <br>
clear that if your corners are given numbers 1 to 8, you can generate a <br>
numerical cycle such as (1 5 7 2 4 3 8) which will give you all the <br>
information you need to complete the permutation of the <br>
corners. Numbers are especially useful if the permutation cycle <br>
resembles something mathematical such as (1 2 3 5 8)(4 6 7) where the <br>
first cycle consists of numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
However, numbers have generally become obsolete with the general <br>
blindfolding population and many people rely on the shapes and the <br>
patters of the permutation that the path of the corners trace <br>
out. Everyone has a different way of memorizing things and so pretty <br>
much as long as you can retain the information, it doesn’t matter how <br>
you do it.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Edge Permutation: Permuting the edges is basically the exact same thing <br>
as permuting the corners. Instead, as stated above, the limitations of <br>
the setup moves are more liberal. We are allowed to make single turns <br>
on theF,B,U, andDfaces. All setup moves on the left and right sides <br>
must beL2andR2.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The algorithms you will use will be the basic three-edge cycles. These <br>
should be quite familiar to you from speed cubing.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Edge Parity Correction:           In this tutorial, I have explained <br>
how to correct corner parity in the event you wish to switch corner A <br>
with B and corner C with D. Edge parity can be done very similarly.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If you can situate your edges using the appropriate setup moves into an <br>
H-permutation (M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2)or Z-permutation(R B’ R’ B F R’ F B’ <br>
R’ B R F2 U), then those algorithms will correct the parity for you. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Note:  The Z-permutation can be performed on the F,B,U, andDfaces and <br>
it will still maintain the orientation of the edges. The H-permutation <br>
can in fact be performed on any face. Try the H-permutation on theLface <br>
and notice is still preserves the orientation of your edges.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Similarly, the H-permutation + U2 or (M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2 U2)which swaps <br>
two sets of diagonal corners can also be performed on any face without <br>
interfering with the corner orientation.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
In general, corners that are being swapped diagonally may be swapped on <br>
any face. Otherwise, they are confined to UandD. Edges that are being <br>
swapped across and not adjacent may also be swapped on any <br>
face. Otherwise, they are confined toF,B,U, andD.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sometimes, it can be difficult to perform setup moves that arrange all <br>
four edges on the same face. In such cases, the parity can be broken <br>
down into two steps. Suppose you want to swap edges A and B and edges C <br>
and D. Using the setup moves with the appropriate limitations (double <br>
turns for the left and right sides), place edge A at the FU position <br>
and edge B and the BU position. Then, perform the <br>
H-permutation. Reverse your setup moves and then put edge C in the FU <br>
position and edge D in the BU position and perform another <br>
H-permutation. Again, reverse your setup moves. This sequence first <br>
swaps edges A and B but also swaps edges at the FL and FR <br>
positions. The second H-permutation swaps edges C and D while <br>
correcting the FL and FR edges.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Corner and Edge Parity Correction:<br>
<br>
Corner and edge parity occurs when one wishes to swap corners A with B <br>
and edge C with D. If it is possible to bring A, B, C, and D all to the <br>
same face, then the appropriate PLL may be performed. It is important <br>
that if corners are being swapped non-diagonally and edges are being <br>
swapped adjacently, you probably have to perform the PLL on the U-face.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
However, sometimes this can be difficult to setup, especially if you <br>
are blindfolded. It is possible to break down the corner/edge parity <br>
correction into two steps.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
First, let us correct the corners. We will be utilizing the <br>
T-permutation, which will swap the FRU corner with the BRU <br>
corner. Position corner A and corner B into FRU and BRU. In doing so, <br>
it is important not to disturb<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m confused, I don&#x27;t think he said blindfolded.

If you did mean blindfolded, then there ya go.  If you didn&#x27;t mean
blindfolded, there are many solutions online from beginner to expert
methods and beyond.  I have a beginner and intermediate (and soon to
be advanced) solution on my site

http://www.deepcube.net

other, more well known beginner solutions include but are not limited to

Jasmine Lee&#x27;s solution
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html

Mark Jeay&#x27;s solution
http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm

Adam&#x27;s solution (a corners first approach)
http://www.ai.sri.com/~cheyer/rubiks/rubiks.html

The list goes on.  Most of these solutions are beginner solutions.  At
first they will probably take around two minutes to complete, but with
a little practice your times will start to fall.  If you are not
satisfied with any of these solutions, feel free to post again, or try
your luck with a search engine.

Hope this helps,

Until next time, Happy Cubing

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Yesterday night I had an idea for the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.<br>
Tyson told me that blindfolded cubing is good because you can actually<br>
solve it without touching it.<br>
&gt;From that, I made up something :<br>
<br>
In a normal Team-Blindfolded solve, one person (let&#x27;s call her A) is<br>
blindfolded and the other (B) tells A what to do. But the thing is<br>
that B is not blindfolded.<br>
<br>
Now, what if both persons where blindfolded ?<br>
For exemple :<br>
Step 1 : A is blindfolded (B is not).<br>
Step 2 : A and B start the timer.<br>
Step 3 : B memorizes the cube.<br>
Step 4 : A and B are blindfolded and B tells A what to do.<br>
Step 5 : A and B stop the timer.<br>
<br>
I think this could be really fun to try.<br>
This is of course more difficult than the regular Team-Blindsolve,<br>
because someone has to memorize the cube. and the solver has to be<br>
more careful because if he makes a mistake : the other can&#x27;t tell him<br>
how to fix it.<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Evan,

You might have heard about the method that some other cubers use, 
the &#x27;cycle&#x27; method. Well, Stefan&#x27;s method is not unlike that. You 
also memorise cycles, but you memorise a cycle of stickers instead 
of pieces. So, when have to memorise more than 1 cycle, my 
memorisation looks a bit like this:

(ABCDA) (EFGHIE) ... etc.

(Note that the letters represent sticker positions here). After 
finishing the first cycle, the piece in the &#x27;buffer position&#x27; is in 
the correct place. Just &#x27;shoot&#x27; that piece to the &#x27;starting point&#x27; 
of the new cycle (E, in my example). And at the end of the cycle, 
you &#x27;shoot&#x27; the correct piece to E, and this will solve the &#x27;buffer 
piece&#x27; again.

Hope this helps :).

Joël.

          <div class="email-content">For the edges, at the worst you&#x27;ll have 4 cycles (4 3-Cycles makes 12
edges solved ;-))

Usually it&#x27;s 1 or 2.

Also, when you start the memorization of the edges, look if any cubie
is in it&#x27;s right position but flipped.
I usually solve this one at the end of the edge-part.

After a bit of practice, you should be able to detect if you have an
orientation problem. If so, just repeat your story or your letters (I
use that too) and fix the problem. ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been messing around with different starts for f2l, and this one seems<br>
very viable. I start with three of the cross pieces, finish the 2x2x3 with<br>
two f2l pairs, do the &quot;square&quot; like in Ryan Heise&#x27;s method, and finish off<br>
with the last c/e pair. Sometimes I&#x27;ll do the square before I do the 2x2x3<br>
if I see all three pieces aren&#x27;t in the 2x2x3 slots; it&#x27;s rather flexible.<br>
Also, if the cross/x-cross would be solved with only one more move or so,<br>
I&#x27;ll switch to Fridrich.<br>
<br>
I averaged sub 20 with it last night after only about two weeks of<br>
practicing, and my normal Fridrich average is around 19.5. I really think<br>
staring with only three cross pieces is great.<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
-Very short &quot;cross&quot; makes it very easy to see x-&quot;cross&quot; or at least the<br>
first pair during preinspection every time.<br>
-average is about 28-30 moves for f2l; possibly 1.5-2 sec. faster than<br>
Fridrich<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
-it&#x27;s confusing to remember where the &quot;square&quot; needs to go because I use a<br>
lot of d turns.<br>
-There are some really bad square cases that I&#x27;m sure can be optimized if I<br>
sit down and find all of the tough cases. <br>
-It&#x27;s hard to &quot;shift gears&quot; for that square.<br>
-It&#x27;s annoying when a piece you need is where the last cross piece normally<br>
would be<br>
<br>
Any thoughts? Does anyone else do this?<br>

&gt; by virtue of the center being orange, CANNOT be orange.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Let&#x27;s think about what the left side of the &quot;P&quot; must be made of.<br>
&gt; Well, both blue-red corners are already used on the &quot;H&quot; side, so the<br>
&gt; corners of the left side of the &quot;P&quot; must both be blue-orange.  Now<br>
&gt; which corner is at the bottom of the &quot;P&quot;?  It can&#x27;t be the blue-<br>

&gt; So it must be the blue-orange-yellow corner.  That means the lower-<br>
&gt; right corner of the &quot;L&quot; - and hence the entire &quot;L&quot; - must be yellow.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We need three yellow corners to make the &quot;L&quot;.  But guess what: both<br>
&gt; red-yellow corners are already on the opposite &quot;H&quot; side, so there&#x27;s<br>
&gt; no way to get the three yellows we need.  Sorry PHIL, but you ain&#x27;t<br>

It&#x27;s only 4 moves longer than your scramble, and it&#x27;s got the pair up
and a whole 2x2 solution in it.

If that ever happens (it won&#x27;t - unless maybe Tyson scrambles for me) 
then I&#x27;ll switch to exception-mode :-). I already do use another 
algorithm for just flipping an edge, I bring it to UL and do U (M&#x27;U)*3 
U (MU)*3. So I don&#x27;t solve those anymore by bringing them into the 
buffer with one swap and shooting them back correctly oriented with 
another swap. Will include this in the next version of my method 
description (I swear I&#x27;ll finish it this year :-).

Cheers!
Stefan

Bastard, how can you do that to me? Now I have to get back to Master

Congrats! And yeah, that 4.88 must&#x27;ve been ultimately painful...

The 3x3 group for example can obviously be generated by the group of 
six generators {U,D,L,R,F,B}. Since you can easily emulate for example 
the D turn with (F2 U2 B2 U2 L2 R2 B2 U B2 R2 L2 U2 B2 U2 F2) the set 
{U,L,R,F,B} also generates the 3x3 group. You can reduce this further, 
and it&#x27;s also possible to generate the whole 3x3 with just 2 
generators, in that case longer algorithms and not just face turns. 
I&#x27;m assuming you know some of this already but I wanted to summarize 
it for others who maybe don&#x27;t. Btw, I kinda dislike it that for 
example we speak about those &quot;six generators&quot; above, even though each 
one alone is not a generator (for the full cube group), only together 
as a set. But that&#x27;s the way it is...

Cheers!

Not the first one, because the H contains both blue-red corners 
(still continuing our &quot;yellow on top, P is blue&quot; scheme).  So the 
left side of the P has both blue-orange corners.  If you put one of 
these corners so that orange makes up the lower-right part of the L, 
the other corner will also show orange and you&#x27;ll have a C instead of 
an L.

The second one may be doable.  It&#x27;s not possible to have a solid 
background for each of the letters (think about the I side - what 
must be on the H side and the left side of the P?) but I now have a 
configuration on my cube that spells PHIL in the manner you 
described.  I&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s solvable and if not, I might be able to 
figure out how to adjust it to make it solvable.

Yeah I know... how about you beat me at Megaminx? Haven&#x27;t seriously 
practiced that for a while for exactly the same reason :-(. So please 
work on that one, too, it&#x27;s such a lovely puzzle.

I have an easy time memorizing algorithms. What I have been doing is
spending one day to learn an entire case of algorithms, then spending
the next day to practice the recognition. So far the timeline looks
like this:
Day 1 -- Learn DoubleSune algs (easy, only 3 new algs, super-easy
recognition)
Day 2 -- Practice DoubleSune algs/recognition
Day 3 -- Learn Sune/Antisune algs (10 new algs, but 5 are mirrors!)
Day 4 -- Practice Sune/Antisune algs/recognition
Day 5 -- Learn &quot;T&quot; algs (very easy recognition, only 5 new algs, but 1
is a mirror!)
Day 6 (today) -- Practice &quot;T&quot; algs/recogntion
Day 7 (tomorrow) -- Learn either U, L, or Pi cases
etc. Only 3 cases remain, so I should be done learning by Sunday. :)

In a group, G, a set of generators is any set whose closure under the group operations 
(multiplication and inverse) is the entire group. For a finite group this is equivalent to the 
closure under multiplication being the whole group (as the inverse of an element is some 
power of that element). By convention the trivial group is generated by the empty set. 
(Because the identity element is the empty product.)
If A is a set of generators then so is any superset of A (in G).

A generator is an element of a set of generators. It only really makes sense to talk about a 
generator within the context of a set of generators. Typical sets of generators include 
{U,D,F,B,R,L} and {U,U2,D,D2,F,F2,B,B2,R,R2,L,L2} although neither of these is a minimal 
set of generators.

For instance U is a generator if the set of generators is {U,D,F,B,R,L} but not in {D,F,B,R,L} 
(which also generates the usual cube group, though not of course the supercube group).
U2 is not a generator in the QTM generators but it is in the HTM generators.

A set of generators is minimal if it contains no proper subset which is a set of generators. 
This is minimal in the lattice of subsets of G - but it doesn&#x27;t mean that such a set has 
minimal size amongst sets of generators (though a set of generators of minimal size is 
obviously a minimal set of generators).

Any group has a set of generators - you can take the set of all the elements of the group 
as a trivial example (and you can also exclude the identity so an group has at least 2 sets 
of generators). At least assuming the axiom of choice every group has a minimal set of 
generators too. (I&#x27;m not sure if that can be proven without AC - it&#x27;s been a long time...)

Any generating set for the Rubik cube group has at least 2 elements (because a group with 
a generating set of fewer than 2 elements is Abelian, that is to say it commutes) and 
indeed the Rubik cube group is a 2-generator group, which is to say that there is a 
generating set with 2 elements.

The supercube group is a 6-generator group. There&#x27;s an obvious set of generators of size 
6, but by considering the action on the centres of any generating set we see that the 
generating set must have size at least 6. (Basically, the action on the centres must be 
commutative with each generator having order dividing 4 (wrt it s action on the centres) 
which means that a set of 5 elements can generate at most 4^5=1024 possible centre 
positions, whereas tere are 2048).

I had my first successful blind solve the other day! I didn&#x27;t time <br>

I used the method described on Macky&#x27;s site, but instead of <br>
assigning numbers to each piece to memorize the cycles, I use <br>
letters A-H for the corners and A-L for the edges, and then create a <br>
sentence with the letters in the cycle. For example, the corner <br>
cycles from my solve today were (AECB)(HE) and the edge cycles were <br>
(ALCJFDGBKI)(EH). Then I came up with &quot;All Excellent Cubes Break. <br>
His for Example.&quot; for the corners, and &quot;All Lousy Cubes Just Find <br>

me at least, it seems a bit easier to remember a sentence than it is <br>

One thing about that page is that it doesn&#x27;t say what it means by &quot;repeated application of 
the generators&quot;.
If they just mean to apply the binary operation repeatedly that isn&#x27;t really accurate. For 
instance the group of integers is generated by {1} but not just by adding repeated adding 
of 1 (which wouldn&#x27;t yield any negative numbers, though it would yield 0 as the empty 
sum). If &quot;repeated application of the generators&quot; also allows for taking inverses then it is 
accurate.
For finite groups you don&#x27;t need inversion but you may need it for infinite groups 
(depending on your generating set), torsion groups aside.

You&#x27;re technically correct here - it&#x27;s essentially an abuse of notation by assuming a 
particular set of generators. As long as it causes no confusion (that is everyone is talking 
about the same set of generators) then it&#x27;s not a problem (because you can then assume 
that any time you mention a generator you are talking about that specific set of 
generators) but as soon as more than one set of generators is under discussion then it is 
essential to proceed as you mention.

It&#x27;s probably because the set of 6 generators above is a rather natural set of generators for 
the group, assuming you&#x27;re using a Rubik&#x27;s cube model of the group, which I guess people 
on this group probably are... It&#x27;s certainly the most obvious set of generators in that 
context.

Why, do they learn different algorithms?

Uh, that&#x27;s assuming you meant attractive=cubing (what else?!) and 
interaction=teamsolving.

In Orlando, at dinner, Dan Knights was telling us how he memorized the
first several hundred digits of Pi easily using &#x27;sound numbers.&#x27;  I
believe the link is http://www.soundnumbers.com/.

It must work, because he rattled off about 100 digits worth in story
form and recited about 200 more like it was as easy as pie.  Or Pi. 
Whichever. ;)

Any help?

I got it in 14 and even managed to preserve all of the oriented LL edges:

L&#x27;U&#x27;L RUR&#x27; D RU&#x27;R&#x27; D&#x27; RUR&#x27;

Was that what you wanted?

That one was tougher. I found 7 moves which inserts the 2 pairs with 
1 corner twisted. So it&#x27;s not quite correct :-P

Haha, everybody (especially those who like me do NOT understand Dutch) 
please check out the 18-11-2004 TV appearance video. When Koen 
explains something with the glitter cube, that&#x27;s how it must feel when 
we show something to a non-cuber. I have no idea what Koen did there :
-)

Nice videos!

Hey, can you tell me the OLL alg you used in the 17.15 seconds solve? 
I guess I know it (though from a different angle) but it looks very 
smooth, it&#x27;s a bad case for me :-(

I took RL&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;L and added 3 moves to make it harder. (I actually used 
RL&#x27;UR&#x27;L in my 26 sec one-handed solve in Florida.)

Oh, and I claim even though it&#x27;s not really &quot;new&quot; in general, it might 
still be new to many people (including me, at least in the sense that 
I haven&#x27;t used it much yet). But I was just searching for a word that 
starts with &quot;n&quot; so gimme a break, will ya? :-)

Yep, I found it now, too (with both L&#x27;s the other way of course :-).

This is fun. Kinda like &quot;fewest moves for the impatient&quot; who don&#x27;t 
want to spend hours on solving a whole cube...

          <div class="email-content">Hey congrats!

i also remember my first BLD solve. It feels soo nice to open your
eyes and find a solved cube right in front of you!

As for the memorisation, i also use a lil bit of letters. For the
corners i use numbers 1-8 but for the edges, memorising 12 nos was
quite monotonous for me, so i name the middle layer edges as A, B, C,
D. And i think it does help.
Since its just your first few solves, its ok to make a story and all,
but if you really want to go fast, you wont have time to make up a
story and all. So i think you would just have to remember the letters
by themselves.

Nice updates.. I like the flash player. I &#x27;ve actually been 
searching for a way to ad videos to tutorials that are IN the 
website, so ppl don&#x27;t have to download them. Maybe I can use 
something like this too :)...

1 little comment, though: the cube-racing videos at the 
Spellenspektakel were shot by me ;).

Cyou,

Whoops.. fixed it ;) They were all one big pile on my hdd and I forgot
you shot those.
It took me quite some time to find a good flash player with playback
controls.. This one is great .. and converting videos to .flv is
über-easy using Riva FLV Encoder (http://www.rivavx.com/?encoder)

I use my ring finger for M&#x27; at the bottom of the cube. But I do M and
M2 quite badly (r2R2, etc) I need some tips on this myself.

I like (L2 l2&#x27;) better than (r2 R2&#x27;) now, rotating a hand 180 degrees 
&quot;towards&quot; me seems easier than &quot;away&quot; from me.

Hi Koen,

thanks, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve thought. I actually came up with that alg 
myself (it&#x27;s just a simple conjugated commutator) for solving the 
Megaminx :-). But I have it mirrored because I solve Megaminx 
left-handed.

I will, I will... is it possible to download the video so I can watch 
it with other software frame by frame? Or is it also possible with 
that player you use?

Thanks,
Stefan

&gt; Yeah, I can learn to do that, but M on it own is bloody hard.<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
M is tough, it&#x27;s useless to optimize it alone, you should consider<br>
optimizations of the sequences where it appears.<br>
<br>
If you need to do MUM&#x27; fast for example, just try l(L&#x27;UM&#x27;) or<br>
R(r&#x27;UM&#x27;). I don&#x27;t like to try to write fingertricks, because in fact<br>
it starts with (l/2)(R/2).<br>
(r&#x27;UM) is so fast, it looks like 1 move.<br>

Thanks, I like that a lot. I practiced it a few dozen times and it&#x27;s 
now about as fast as my old alg for it, which was two Sunes:
R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R2 U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;

I think I should be able to do the two Sunes faster with the cross on 
left (i.e. U&#x27; R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U2 R U&#x27; R U R2 U&#x27;) which is how I solve 
F2L now, but that other alg should still beat it. I&#x27;ll probably give 
both a chance but right now I prefer yours.

Cheers!
Stefan

Does anyone actually do this regularly for speedcubing? I try to but

          <div class="email-content">I am sure a number of people in this group would be interested in knowing about some results that have been posted on the Cube Lover&#x27;s forum (http://cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal/) regarding the quarter-turn metric (QTM).<br>
<br>
Someone on that forum, identifying himself as Silviu, posted that he had found that the corners can always be solved in 22 quarter turns or less without any net change in the location or orientation of the edges. In January, 2004, Tomas Rokicki had posted to this Yahoo group that the edges can always be solved in 18 quarter turns. Together, this shows that Rubik&#x27;s cube can always be solved in two phases in no more than 18 + 22 = 40 quarter turns. I have personally verified Silviu&#x27;s result using a C++ program.<br>
<br>
I have determined the positions of distance 17 and 18 in Rokicki&#x27;s edges-only analysis. I have considered all the positions (unique with respect to the symmetries of the cube) where those edge configurations are combined with all possible corner configurations with the same permutation parity as the edge configuration. I have found that these positions are solveable using no more than 38 quarter turns. Since all the remaining positions of the cube can be solved with the above-mentioned two-phase method with no more than 16 + 22 = 38 quarter turns, this shows that all positions of Rubik&#x27;s cube can be solved in no more than 38 quarter turns.<br>
<br>
The upper bound for the QTM has been considered to be 42 for the last several years, to my understanding. Verification of these new results will thus establish a new upper bound of 38 for the QTM.<br>
<br>
It may be possible to further consider positions of distance 16 in the edges-only analysis and show that 37 is also an upper bound.<br>

slot? I&#x27;ve found a couple good algs for some of them. I really need to write

19.3 with this method earlier today, so I&#x27;m probably going to switch to it.

Hello,

   Yes, I started doing that about a month ago, posted
a message about it and no on responded.  I am still a
relative beginner, but my times dropped from 3-5min,
to a consistent 50-60sec.  I think it is quicker,
easier and has great potential. 

    Good to know I&#x27;m not the only one.

Either that, or ask your brother politely to use the cube that I gave him.

As much as I hate to recommend a product I don&#x27;t believe in....

I&#x27;ve just learned via twistypuzzles that Restoration Hardware now has 
the cube for $12.  Evidently they are not shrinkwrapped.  So go to your 
local location, try them all out until they get mad at you, then pick 
one that suits your needs.

They are something of a replica of the old 80&#x27;s Ideal cubes.  But, they 
are just the basic Winning Moves cubes with an 80&#x27;s style package and 
logo sticker.  What gets my goat is they still use the paper stickers.  
Were they vinyl, I would buy a ton of them.

          <div class="email-content">You could get the custom stickers with the rubik&#x27;s logo of choice.  And then
you&#x27;d have fifty center stickers, and a bunch of sets.  You&#x27;d never run
out.  Or we could ask to have cubesmith stock these center stickers.  But
there is probably some formal legal thing about printing the rubik&#x27;s logo,
and no one likes that stuff.  So who knows...

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone<br>
<br>
For anyone who is interested, I have made an average of the First 2<br>
Blocks, or F2B.  This is step 1 and 2 of the Roux method.<br>
<br>
14.44, (12.37), 17.76, 18.22, 16.69, 15.62, 20.78, (24.46), 17.06,<br>
15.97, 14.93, 16.39                         F2B AVG 16.79<br>
<br>
Its kind of like F2L, except you leave 2 pieces of the cross unsolved,<br>
and neglect the M ring.    Its a little easier than F2L, because its<br>
only 2 steps.   You do I 3x2x1 Block and then build another.  Once you<br>
do Step 1, its just like doing 2 pairs, but they&#x27;re always filling the<br>
RF and RB slots, so you never lose your grip.<br>
<br>
Similar to F2L, the F2B is the key to getting fast at the ROUX method.<br>
 I think that a 12 sec avg is a reasonably attainable goal.<br>
<br>
Also, I am almost fully color neutral.  Full color neutrality is crazy<br>
to me, so I use 4 configurations.<br>
<br>
A. White on Left. Orange on bottom  (starting w/ white/orange block) <br>
B. Yellow on left. Orange on bottom ( &quot;&quot; yellow/orange block)<br>
C. White on left.  Red on bottom (&quot;&quot; white/red block)<br>
D. Yellow on left. Red on Bottom (&quot;&quot; yellow/red block)<br>
<br>
Each of these is different to me.  I like A and B the best.  C and D<br>
are ok but harder for me (I used to do orange on bottom for CFOP).  A,<br>
B, C, and D appear equally often as lucky cases for step 1, so I want<br>
to be equally good at all  4 of them.<br>

Actually, I find that a lot of the time, I do both simultaneously.  I
see easy ways to insert part of block 2 early, or finish the final
edge of block 1 last.  I&#x27;m terrible about cube rotations, though, so I
should definitely work on that.  Perhaps I should try always holding
the last pair(s) on a particular side like you do.

Hmm, there are people averaging like 9 seconds for full F2L, so 8 
seconds sounds like a reasonable goal for F2B, too, don&#x27;t you think?

I agree.  With the same kind of mastery over F2B that people are
beginning to show over F2L, I think 8 seconds is not unreasonable, and
perhaps less, because it is so adaptable to accomodate more lucky cases.

I just got curious enough after this debate to take an average (damn
you Stefan! I need to get to bed), and I was somewhat surprised.  I
consider myself a mediocre F2B solver, with a lot to learn still, and
very little work actually invested in the method.  Still, I managed an
11.76 after 12 solves.

The more I get motivated to work on ZBF2L, the more promising this
method seems.  They&#x27;re teasing me, really.

That&#x27;s it.  I just need two brains.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I meant to post something here as well.  I got a really nice cube <br>
from there by &quot;test-driving&quot; one first.  Check out the thread here for <br>
photos:<br>

Basically it&#x27;s a replica of the old Ideal packaging.  Even the <br>
instructions look similar to the old style, but updated.  They include <br>
a reference to Macky&#x27;s 12.11 second record in there, but the text and <br>
graphics are similar to the original instructions.<br>
<br>
Yes, the stickers will wear out quickly, but of course nowadays we <br>
have the technology to remedy that easily enough.<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; I&#x27;ve just learned via twistypuzzles that Restoration Hardware now <br>
has <br>
&gt; the cube for $12.  Evidently they are not shrinkwrapped.  So go to <br>
your <br>
&gt; local location, try them all out until they get mad at you, then <br>
pick <br>
&gt; one that suits your needs.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; They are something of a replica of the old 80&#x27;s Ideal cubes.  But, <br>
they <br>
&gt; are just the basic Winning Moves cubes with an 80&#x27;s style package <br>
and <br>
&gt; logo sticker.  What gets my goat is they still use the paper <br>
stickers.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">It locks up and stopped turning smoothly.  I even lubed it last week
to try to revive it, but it is still acting up.  It adds at least a
few unnecessary seconds to every solve I take. :(  I will take some

if I can, I need to start preparing a new cube for the Caltech winter
competition.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, apparently a lot of people had that same idea :)  Cubesmith is 
set up to put any name on that logo.  I actually edited mine manually 
because I wanted to preserve the exact &quot;Rubik&quot; script.

I notice the new Restoration Hardware cubes logo have an (R) next to 
the word &quot;Rubik&#x27;s&quot; instead of a TM next to the word &quot;CUBE.&quot;  I still 
think it&#x27;s a nice package they&#x27;ve come up with, despite the sticker 
issue.  I had been wondering what was coming next after the 
anniversary edition.

up in other places that specialize in retro gear... maybe Cracker 
Barrel for example.  The price is more expensive (probably because 
of the bulkier packaging, or just Restoration Hardware&#x27;s markup).  I 
don&#x27;t think these are any different physically than the 25th 
anniversary cubes, but they are a newer batch.  The serial number on 
mine says M1005B, so I think they were just manufactured last month.

And what kind of cube is it? No speedcube should ever really wear out 
that much, so you must&#x27;ve done something wrong :-). Uh, or maybe I 
just never played enough with a single cube to wear it out...

Doing what, using tinyurl to say &quot;you oughta know&quot;? :-)

Hmm, I wonder what would happen if I could predict the next tinyurl 
and let it forward to itself...

That&#x27;s what I get for not being online on the weekend!

Right after I posted it I saw your post. I tried something else first,
but then I saw it.

Did you *really* need to check if it was optimal?

Cheers,

Yes, that&#x27;s happened to me recently. Last week, my average suddenly dropped
too (25 to 23). Also, one day I was suddenly able to do F2L smoother than I
had done previously. Hopefully another one of these drops will drop me into
the sub-20 range.

Well i was 99.5% sure it was optimal but it&#x27;s nice to have solid 
evidence that it is. Hmm, then again we don&#x27;t know that ACube is 
100% reliable. It&#x27;s not been proven :-P (philosophical remark)

What I did was get a good high quality raster image (i.e. JPG) of

Then you need a good program to conver the raster to a vector for

          <div class="email-content">Hello again<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that I was just being sarcastic when I<br>
said that there were not enough websites about cubing.  There are a<br>
lot. I do think that there are way to many about CFOP and not enough<br>
about corners first, Petrus, Roux...<br>
<br>
Also, I just meant that a 12s F2B was a good goal for me.  Its crazy<br>
to me that people can do F2L in 9 sec on average!<br>
<br>
F2B<br>
<br>
For the F2B, I think that 8 secs is attainable with color neutrality.<br>
 10 sec is possible with starting with same block every time<br>
<br>
<br>
I think that even using the slower method for the 2nd block<br>
(DR edge, 2 pairs), you can do the 2nd block in 5sec.   On Gilles site<br>
he says 5 sec is what you need.  I figure 1 sec for DR edge and 2 sec<br>
for each CE pair. SO 5 sec for 2nd Block.<br>
<br>
So the real question is- how fast can the first block be done on average?<br>
<br>
I think that for the same block every time, 4s is about right.<br>
If you use some color neutrality, I think that this can be reduced to<br>
sub 3.  Lots of lucky cases for step 1.<br>
<br>
So with the same block every time (4s) you end up with a 9s avg<br>
with lucky blocks (2-3s?) you can be sub 8.<br>
<br>
As i said earlier, F2B is defenitely the key to speedsolving with this<br>
method.<br>
<br>
Block 1  4s<br>
Block 2  5s<br>
CLL      3s<br>
Step 4   5s<br>
Total   17s avg<br>
<br>
And also, does everyone think that it is easier to learn CLL/COLL by<br>
&quot;reading&quot; 4 stickers?  Or to recognize which 2 corners need to switch?<br>
<br>
Do you think that learning more than one color for CLL/COLL is a lot<br>
harder?  Im trying to decide if I should just do red on top, or red<br>
and orange...<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?<br>

I concur wholehandedly.

But why?  Even always creating the same two blocks, you retain color
recognition but gain double chances for lucky starts.

Try solving the c/e pairs first or first and third in whichever block
if you happen to find good cases for them before the edge.  It takes
no time, really, and often saves moves.  Consider the scramble:
(S) R (S&#x27;) R U2 R2

Notice how the inverse solves the position easily. The best you can
hope for with the rigid method is several moves longer and much less fun.

I definitely think 4 seconds is a reasonably attainable goal, but it
requires flexibility.  Good starts with Roux are much easier to see
than, for example, X-cross, but I think that with enough practice, the
recognition becomes easier and the solutions just pop out to  you
quicker.  I can find myself planning out solutions involving three or
more pairs sometimes, just because the blocks are nice.  Practice is key.

I think that 4 + 5 + 2.5 + 5 = 16.5 should be fairly doable by anyone
willing to put forth enough effort.

I posted a couple of things on the ZB group recently about a thought I
had that intrigued me.  If people can learn nearly 800 sequences for
full ZB, why can&#x27;t we apply a similar technique to this method?  The
obvious places to apply it are on steps 3 and 4.  There are a couple
of possibilities I&#x27;d like to examine.

One is learning both CLL and COLL cases for each of the step 3 cases.
 If you happen to notice the edges are all correctly oriented after
step 2, you could apply a slightly slower COLL case and maintain the
orientation after step 3, giving you a better case for step 4.

The other option involves learning how to finish every possible case
from step 4, once all the edges are correctly oriented.  I think that
it&#x27;s between 14 and 30 cases + mirrors.  And because they can all be
solved using M U L R they can all be solved very quickly.  I&#x27;m curious
what the actual case count and average move number for this is.

Both of these taken together could lead to ZB type LL&#x27;s for what is
quickly earning a place in my mind as a very competitive method, but
at a fraction of the number of algs.

Well, I&#x27;m partial to recognizing them by which corners need to switch.
 The sticker method is more abstract.  It puts an extra layer between
you and understanding what exactly is going on with the cube.  The
other way, there are no patterns to remember.  Only the OLL case and
which corners need to switch.

I think I&#x27;ve got way too much to learn still. :P

And because I forgot this part a minute ago, here it is.  I use white
on bottom and yellow for my LL.  However, if I see a nice enough
yellow start, I go with it.  I&#x27;ve noticed my times for when I use
white LL aren&#x27;t too bad.  In fact, the white is nice and bright, so
it&#x27;s actually somewhat helpful.  The only real problem I have is not
being able to track the yellow pieces at the beginning as well for the
same reason.  Chris Hardwick and others have shown the benefits of
opposite color solving.  I think it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.

Of course this assume that we have a RWC2007 (which I for one vote for<br>

<br>
I for one have really neglected blindfold cubing, and have<br>
rediscovered that I like it very much.  I want to learn BLD cubing<br>
better, and hopefully be using some ZB techniques on easy cases that I<br>
will have known for 2-3 years by 2007 for speedsolving.<br>
<br>
What are everyone else&#x27;s goals?  Anyone rediscover a category they<br>
like, or discover a category?<br>

Then i guess u have somehow installed that directx version by some 
mistake. It looks like ur card doesn&#x27;t support the directx 9a API. 
This could be disastrous for various games or other software that 
use directx9 automatically when it finds that version of directx 
installed. Oh well, if u are not a gamer i guess u should be fine :-)

PS! Uninstalling (or downgrading) directx is not an easy task. It

<br>
keep in mind that I do not claim these ideas as my own.<br>
I am just organizing some methods.<br>
<br>
Possible improvements for Step 4<br>
<br>
1. Learn COLL in addition to CLL for cases where edges are already<br>
oriented correctly<br>
<br>
2. Orient Edges 1st and only learn COLL (?_)<br>
<br>
3. If Bottom 2 edges are oriented correctly, and the ledge and redge<br>
are somewhere in top layer, Then ELL could solve all cases in 1<br>
Algorithm, leaving you with a 4 move PLL.<br>
<br>
4. Learn the 8 algorithms in Ming Thai&#x27;s method.<br>
   FOr cases where a redge or ledge is already in place, you can<br>
insert final edge and orient midges.  I never learned these, but they<br>
    could be useful in certain cases<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Mike-<br>
Where is there a table of ZBLL like cases for step 4?  Or do we have<br>
to make one?  I don&#x27;t really like method 3 on gilles site if thats<br>
what youre talking about.  But i am in favor of exploring the options.    <br>
<br>
If all edges are Oriented, then Its just a matter of permuting 6<br>
oriented cubies.  That should be able to be done with a single<br>
algorithm.  How many cases could there possible be?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I have a few goals for RWC2007 - which I also vote for to be in 
London. I mean Europe. :)

I also want to be using a good set of ZB algorithms, for now I am 
focussing on the cases which can be solved using a 2-generator 
algorithm (which is of course one COLL case per orientation). I want 
to be able to know those inside out, and I also want to be solving 
at least 2 of the orientations fully using ZB. Of course, I would 
love to be using full ZB, but I think that would take too much time, 
which as you get older you find you don&#x27;t have so much of! That&#x27;s 
why I&#x27;m already envying the 14-18 age range in our group ;)

I want to be averaging 14 seconds over an average of 5 cubes, 
because I feel this will be the winning target at RWC2007. This 
won&#x27;t only be an improvement in technique, but also an improvement 
in the total physical and mental regime which you now need to have 
to be successful in a high pressure competition. I want to be 
averaging at least 1 min 10 for the 4x4x4, and I want to 
dramatically improve my times for the 5x5x5. I will also practice 
hard at the Magic, buy myself a Master Magic and learn that, and I 
will also beat Stefan at the Clock like I have promised him for ages.

I will also have fully mastered blindfold solving and I hope to be 
one of the best in the world by RWC 2007. I have already solved once 
or twice blindfolded, and using my system for memorisation I have 
already &quot;made&quot; a solution in 3 minutes. By this I mean I have 
memorised edges and solved them, stopped the timer, then started 
again with memorising corners and solving. Once I get the hang of 
putting it all together, and get the hang of automating setup moves 
or learning the new algorithms Stefan and I have been talking about, 
it would be very fast. The limiting factor would be actually finding 
the pieces to remember!

AND I will take part on the Fewest Moves Competition!

These are my primary goals. On the side, I would very dearly love to 
get the hang of square-1, but at the moment it is taking me too long 
to learn, as the techniques required are very different to 
speedsolving a cube, particularly if you approach it blindly by just 
learning the algorithms, as I am free to admit that I do as far as 
the sq-1 is concerned. I am sure that I will also practice hard at 
the Megaminx, the key lies in finding the pieces which just comes 
from practice I think, and also learning a good system.

So, unlike a lot of people these days, I have chosen not to focus in 
on one puzzle. This is going to be a lot of hard work, but it will 
also be very satisfying to see improvements in my puzzles. I admire 
the cubers who are very fast at all of the cube sizes, such as 
yourself Chris, or Lars, Ron, Frank, and many others of course, and 
I always look up to you for sources of inspiration.

Good Luck to everyone in their practice for competitions, not only 
RWC2007 of course!

Dan Harris :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan and Chris,

My goals for RWC2007 are significantly less ambitious than yours. :)

My primary goal for RWC2005 was to get a sub-30s solve, which I did
(27.96s). RWV2007 is so far away that I&#x27;m not really sure what is a
realistic goal for me. I&#x27;m still using a 3-look LL, so an obvious goal
would be to have learnt all OLLs and be fluent at them. I think this is
achieveable, but if I say it here then it means I&#x27;ll have to do it! ;)

I&#x27;d like to compete in the 4x4x4 again. I competed in that at RWC2003,
but for some reason haven&#x27;t entered it again at any other competitions.
Actually, I know why, it&#x27;s because I preferred the Eastsheen 4x4x4s. :(
The Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4 I have now is actually okay, so maybe I will enter
that event at RWC2007.

I think I should aim to get my 5x5x5 times down to something reasonable
so I can enter that event. I&#x27;ve never competed in the 5x5x5 because I&#x27;m
never sure if I&#x27;m going to finish it before the stackmat times out! ;)

I entered one-handed 3x3x3 for the first time at RWC2005. It was more
fun than I expected so I&#x27;d be interested in giving that another go.
Hopefully faster as well since my current average is a little over 2
minutes one-handed!

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

My goal is to win everything next time!

I aim for sub 13 avg on 3x3x3, sub 1:00 avg on 4x4x4 and sub 2:00 
avg on 5x5x5. Pluss win clock, megaminx, magic, OH, BLD, fewest 
moves and also feet competition :-P

Nah, seriously i hope to keep improving on the 5x5x5 and be so calm 
that i can do my normal times. And i do aim for winning fewest 
moves! I really hope stickers will be allowed next time. That&#x27;s my 
serious goals. Im not gonna waste my time trying to learn fridrich 
or more advanced systems for 3x3x3. Even if i do so, competition is 
way too tough. I solely do speed 3x3x3 out of decency ... lol ... 
Sub 30 secs is impressive for 99.95% of the population ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Cool topic!

I plan to get more into the one-handed solving.  I didn&#x27;t compete in 
that event at WC05, because I had never really even tried a OH solve 
before.  However, once I tried it, I realized I wasn&#x27;t bad at it.  So 
I&#x27;m going to work on that.

The other big thing is perfecting some finger tricks.  I&#x27;ve been 
solving for many years using full hand-twisting motions.  I made the 
decision prior to WC05 to stick with that rather than learn a whole 
new style.  However, in the last three weeks I&#x27;ve been studying sites 
like N8&#x27;s and Yuki&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve improved several of my algorithms&#x27; speed 
by applying FSC&#x27;s.  I especially like the &quot;Zoku&quot; contest that Macky 
posted a link to.  This is a whole new side of speedcubing (for me), 
and I&#x27;m really enjoying the learning experience.

Aside from that, I really should focus on speedsolving Megaminx and 
Square-1.  I sat out those events this time to focus solely on the 
regular cubes.  But next time I&#x27;d like to compete in more categories.

Oh, I also plan to enter the 6x6x6 category!

Goals:

Sub-15 3x3 Avg
Sub-40 3x3 OH avg
Sub-Lars Square-1 (sorry Lars ;P)

Ummm...and actually make it to RWC 07&#x27;  It&#x27;s a long swim across the 
Atlantic, especially while trying to hold my cubes above the water.

          <div class="email-content">Well, I&#x27;ve finally decided to sit down and finish learning OLL.  I&#x27;ve<br>
got less than half down now, but hopefully this means I will be more<br>
consistent by 2007.  Sub 16 (at home) should be possible once I get them<br>
all down, so Sub-17 avg at the RWC2007 would be nice :-)<br>
<br>
I also hope to get more competative on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, although I<br>
have not been doing much lately with either of them.  And of course, I<br>
plan on setting the WR on the 6x6x6, as well ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">This is a tough question.  Okay, here are my goals:

AR for clock (with the only intention being to annoy Craig)
1st place for the magic, hopefully sub-1 second.
1st place for the master magic, probably sub-2.5 seconds.
1st place for the super magic.  (Hopefully by then it&#x27;s an event).
Certainly make the 3x3x3 semi-finals.  It depends on how long it takes
me to finish learning ZB for me to decide on any time goals.
Do respectable on the 4x4, 5x5, megaminx, and square-1.  That means I
actually have to learn how to finish the square-1, but I do have 2
years, right? :)
I also want to be top-5 in the one-handed category.  I know I can do
this because I did it in the first round.  I suppose I should start
practicing that again.
And I want a damn successful blindsolve.  I don&#x27;t practice it all, but
I at least want something other than DNF!  I will eventually have to
break down and practice it more :(
I want to make the finals for the 2x2 category, also.  I just missed
it last time. :(

My vote is also for Europe.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!!

My primary goal is to get a sub-15 average. I&#x27;m focusing on the 
3*3*3 right now. Regular and one-handed solving. I&#x27;d be very proud 
to be in the &quot;top-20 in the world&quot;-list or beating Devid Wesleys 
swedish record of 15.91. I have practiced a bit one-handed lately 
and my average is 42.68 at the moment. My goal there is to achive a 
sub-30 average.

By the way, I haven&#x27;t been able to cube with my hands lately because 
I have an inflamed muscle in my left lower arm, so I&#x27;ve done some 
footcubing. 2:19,71 is my best time so far. I&#x27;ll very soon reach sub-
2 minutes!!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

Wow, I&#x27;m glad this topic took off and I guess I should answer with a
little more thought also.

Dan I&#x27;m starting to think like you, I don&#x27;t want to focus on just one
puzzle.  Every time I try to focus on one, I feel bad for not
practicing something else I really enjoy.

My goals for RWC2007 would most likely be to improve my blindfolded
rank (which I&#x27;ve neglected the most this year), and also to
successfully do the 4x4x4 BLD.  I will attempt the 5x5x5, and I guess
in two years I might be ok at it, but my goal is the 4x4x4 record
right now, sorry Dror :-(

I also want to just stay competitive at all my favorite puzzles.  I
will of course buy a 6x6x6 and hope to be in the top-10 for that, but
I imagine that puzzle will take some work of course.  I guess I would
be happy just to compete in the 6x6x6.

I also want to either use ZB, or use it to train for Fridrich and
hopefully improve my 3x3x3 rank, but with the competition as stiff as
it is now I will just approach that category to hope to do well, but
to have fun either way.

Everyone keep posting your goals, they are really fun to read!  It&#x27;s
really cool to see how our little hobby is evolving into more of a
serious &quot;quirky sport&quot; ;-)

  Hey everyone,

Wow, I&#x27;m glad this topic took off and I guess I should answer with a
little more thought also.

Dan I&#x27;m starting to think like you, I don&#x27;t want to focus on just one
puzzle.  Every time I try to focus on one, I feel bad for not
practicing something else I really enjoy.

My goals for RWC2007 would most likely be to improve my blindfolded
rank (which I&#x27;ve neglected the most this year), and also to
successfully do the 4x4x4 BLD.  I will attempt the 5x5x5, and I guess
in two years I might be ok at it, but my goal is the 4x4x4 record
right now, sorry Dror :-(

I also want to just stay competitive at all my favorite puzzles.  I
will of course buy a 6x6x6 and hope to be in the top-10 for that, but
I imagine that puzzle will take some work of course.  I guess I would

          <div class="email-content">Goals for RWC 2007:<br>
<br>
3x3: I want to be able to average in the 15&#x27;s.  Right now I&#x27;m using<br>
VHF2L and COLL, but I would like it to be more ZBLL by then.  I would<br>
also like to average similarly with the Roux method.<br>
<br>
3x3 OH: It would be nice to be under 40 on average, but I don&#x27;t know<br>
how realistic that is because I&#x27;ve never really practiced it much.  My<br>
average at that the last time I checked a few months ago was more like<br>
1:10. :(<br>
<br>
4x4: I want to consistently average under 70 for sure.  My best times<br>
right now are just above that, but my average is still in the 90&#x27;s.  I<br>
need to get better at my method, and maybe learn some more 3 cycles<br>
for directly solving edges.  With practice, I think that could be fast.<br>
<br>
5x5: It would be cool to actually be fast enough to compete at that. <br>
With the terrible cube I&#x27;ve got with no lube, my best time is 6:40,<br>
but I think I can get my method down to under half of that with a good<br>
cube and practice.  Sub-4 for sure but I&#x27;m really shooting for sub-3.<br>
<br>
Square1: I need to find mine in the attic and relearn how to solve it.<br>
 That first part could take the whole two years...<br>
<br>
Team blindfold: I really hope there&#x27;s an even for this.  Heidi and I<br>
really enjoy it.  Plus, we have a way better naming system than Ian<br>
does. ;P<br>
<br>
Blindfold: I want to have a successful solve by then instead of just<br>
DNF&#x27;s, and I would like to be well under 3 minutes.  I just need to<br>
actually work on it.<br>
<br>
2x2: I can do well with my 4x4 scrambled as a 2x2, but I don&#x27;t<br>
actually own a decent real 2x2.  I should work on that, and then get good.<br>

Gilles, forgive us, it&#x27;s just so strange that the inventor of a method 
is actually the fastest user of it :-)

          <div class="email-content">Well...I&#x27;ve put this off long enough and I Will now chime in with my<br>
thoughts...<br>
<br>
LEARN FRIDRICH FULL FRIDRICH!!! Huge goal...obvious goal, obviously<br>
going to happen within 2 years...<br>
<br>
2x2 - Average under 20 consistently, maybe once I learn Fridrich(and<br>
COLL maybe) I&#x27;ll hit sub-10???<br>
<br>
3x3 - With Fridrich, once I get it down, I think I&#x27;ll be sub-20, and<br>
with a lot of practice maybe better...<br>
<br>
3x3 OH - Again, dependant on Fridrich, I&#x27;ve got a decent cube, and i&#x27;m<br>
not bad at OH, I just have a bad method...Aiming for sub-45 average<br>
<br>
3x3 Feet - Fridrich, Some people are amazed I can get 4:xx.xx with my<br>
feet...I&#x27;ll aim sub-3 for now...may need to update this later<br>
<br>
3x3 BLD - Chris Hardwick, that lovely man, is partway through teaching<br>
me...I&#x27;ll learn how to do it, then let you know my goals...<br>
<br>
4x4 - You know it...Fridrich, and centers and pairing up need to be<br>
faster, just recognition and and turning speed...Aiming for sub-1:30...<br>
<br>
5x5 - This is just a matter of time...it isn&#x27;t dependant on Fridrich,<br>
I use a version of Per&#x27;s Method and I believe I will someday be able<br>
to hit sub-3, but it will take a good amount of practice...<br>
<br>
6x6 - The forsaken cube...Hopefully top 5...will be one of the top<br>
cubers for this off the start, may get completely destroyed once<br>
people get good methods...Sub-10 minute single solve within a<br>
day...sub-5 final...sub-4 will probably be nearing WR...<br>
<br>
Magic - This is just practice practice practice...I will get near a<br>
second someday...don&#x27;t know when...I&#x27;ve got 2 years...<br>
<br>
Master Magic - I want one of the real ones...that are heavy...I love<br>
the one I have now (Thank you Peter for making it) but...It is a bit<br>
light to control, my fault because of the tiles I supplied...Aiming<br>
around 3 seconds???With my MM, maybe sub-3 with a heavy one...<br>
<br>
Super Magic - I might get one...before the end of the year...Bob-Watch<br>
out for me on this puzzle...<br>
<br>
Clock - Get a better one...Those of you who have tried my clock<br>
understand...and I need to get better overall...I am hoping with a new<br>
clock average sub-12, maybe better<br>
<br>
Megaminx - Should be getting one within the next month, may suck cuz<br>
of it&#x27;s inards but I will talk to Stefan about that...really easy<br>
puzzle actually...Maybe hit sub-5 once I get and practice it...<br>
<br>
Sqaure-1 - Learn how to do it...I was planning on doing it before this<br>
WC, but I didn&#x27;t...really isn&#x27;t too hard of a puzzle, but it looks<br>
intimidating, avg-sub-60 on this by 2007...<br>
<br>
Pyraminx - Use a better method than the one I came up with...Avg sub-15<br>
<br>
UFO??? This is interesting...maybe an event one day???hmmmmmmmm...Soon<br>
 the world championships will have to be a week long event to do all<br>
needed events and do everyone who wants to compete, or there will be<br>
qualifying from home countries.<br>
<br>
Cup-Stacking...Yah yah, not cubing related, but still...after trying<br>
this at WC I am planning on buying some, mom said she&#x27;d let me borrow<br>
her credit card later...:)<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t focus on any one puzzle, I practice everything all the time,<br>
and my dad is always telling me to practice just one puzzle...but I&#x27;m<br>
never gunna do that...Any questions, you know where to find<br>
me...probably forgot something...but meh...<br>

Ok, now the obvious question: How does it compare to Gilles&#x27;s way?

Both ways first orient all six edges and place the LU and RU edges, 
but they place them at different places.

Do we know average number of moves for these two methods?

Cheers!

I&#x27;m mainly thinking of a general comparison goal: participate and make 
it to the finals in every event.

Some explicit goals:
- Get 4x4 and 5x5 blindfolded, maybe 6x6 if time and organizers allow 
it.
- Win Megaminx, it&#x27;s by far the best puzzle and I have no intentions 
to let it down.
- Win 3x3, can&#x27;t be that hard.

Cheers!

-learn to solve BLD and compete in all sizes (and finish)
-learn OLL, COLL, xcross, opposite cross, perfect my PLL algs, get sub
10sec F2L every time
-get into big cubes (4x4x4 and up)
-get into magic, master magic, and super magic, along with OH in all
-okay, this one is new, but i tried it once and it was fun. OH 4x4x4
solving. it hurts if you try to do more than one (well, at least for
me), but its a much more physically challenging puzzle.
-3x3x3 OH... get better

and for the actual competition:
-get top 3 for 4x4x4

obviously there&#x27;s more... but homework is calling me :-/

rwc2007... bring it.

Btw, you should switch to R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L for the mirror

Took me about 15 seconds to execute, plus I ended up with a bowl full 
of mush.  What does f&#x27; stand for?  Is that (F&#x27;S&#x27;)?  Or is it (B S&#x27;)?  
or something else....

That&#x27;s a perfect question for this applet:
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet.asp

Copy &amp; paste the alg, immediately see what the result is, and watch it 
step by step if anything is unclear. Very useful page, better bookmark 
it.

Hey! That was my idea, now everybody is copying me! First Quinn, then 
Bob, now Craig. Can you see what these videos have in common? I call 
it the HaNaMa disease, 1000 imaginary $$$ for the first who can tell

          <div class="email-content">My method for doing this is to put one edge in and then pair up a 
corner-edge pair adjacent to it and work around the  FL that way.  16 moves

8.15 on average.  Probably a little better when I&#x27;m mostly awake.  I<br>
did all of the decent solves cross followed by 4 corners.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not doing anything optimally, but I think cross first may<br>
be fewer moves, especially if you&#x27;re counting in QTM.  The worst case<br>
scenario for a corner to be in is either in the top layer with the<br>
bottom side on the U face or in the wrong spot or orientation on the<br>
first layer.  Both of these are easy to fix and generally with two<br>
generators, which are quite fast.  Corners first, you would need to<br>
make sure to get a good corner case followed by very quick edge<br>
placement.  The worst case scenarios for edges are in the wrong spots<br>
and wrongly oriented.  Granted, you can often fix these with only MUF,<br>
but I think this is still slower than two generators, no matter how<br>
much I like M turns.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t see the usefulness of FL really, because F2L places pieces<br>
very efficiently.  FL places 4 fewer pieces in slightly fewer moves<br>
and makes it more difficult to actually place those 4 pieces.  The<br>
only way I can think of that FL might be useful is if you solve Roux<br>
style with the FL as your first 1x2x3, but I think it&#x27;s hard to solve<br>
that way quickly and maintain the correct colors for your blocks.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

FL (or F1L rather?) is of course useful for beginners who start out 
his/her cubing career by using a very basic layer by layer method. 
Since this step of a very basic method is also supposed to be 
intuitive (unless forcing cross + 4C or something) i consider it 
important to be fast with this step for the overall speed :-)

I would say that a beginner using a beginners layer by layer method 
should aim for something like the following breakdown:

- First layer (FL) : 10-15 secs
- Middle layer (E-edges) : 15-20 secs 
- Last layer (4 steps somehow) : 20-30 secs

This makes a total of 45-65 secs for a beginner. I believe this is 
realistic. The faster the recognition the closer to 45 secs one 
should get. With more advanced tricks and combining steps here it&#x27;s 
possible to move below 30 secs even with pure layer by layer :-)

Of course only Fnl (fist n layers) practice is *really* useful for 
the nxnxn cube, since there are so many approaches to solving 
(different steps) :-P (Yes it is and isn&#x27;t a joke ;-)  )

Cheers!

Simple: It is wasting time.

Let me guess, you just can&#x27;t decide which of the two OLLs is better 
and because you don&#x27;t want to practice one more often than the other, 
you practice them alternatingly. Right?

Hey, aren&#x27;t you embarrassed about your 2.20 seconds video on your 
page? Compare to 1.26:

It is possible to buy stacktimer/stackmat and other speedstacking 
products from :

htp://www.speedstacks.dk

As far as i can see the site is only available in danish. But buying 
there should save some shipping costs :-)

4.16 secs is extremely fast for F1L ...

Did u simply do cross pluss 4C ? Or you did F1L completely 
intuitively (solve what u see first) ??

Have fun!

-Per

PS! Now that you have done this on 3x3x3 try the same on 4x4x4 and 
5x5x5. If you can do those fast also you qualify for using the cage 
method ;-)

Not quite, but close.  When I practice ZBF2L algs, if I want to
practice the case when all edges must be flipped, I first flip them
all (that&#x27;s the first OLL), then setup the case using the 2-gen so I
don&#x27;t affect the flipped edges (thats the RUR&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;) and then solve
using the ZBF2L alg (the rest).  I didn&#x27;t learn the inverse yet, so
this is how I have to practice.

Yes.  What algorithm are you using for that case?  It looks like I
have to switch. :P

Whoa, I really like that algorithm. I can do the mirror quite fast, 
but I was always slower with this case as I did the bulk of it with 
my left hand  my slower hand. I am definitely switching to this 
algorithm.  Thanks.

What do you use for the F perm, Stefan?

Josef&#x27;s sequences should give you better results.

Various ideas about the last 6 edges and 4 centers:
- If you want to solve in less than 12 moves (using sequences mostly
based on &lt;M, U>), it&#x27;s extremely difficult (impossible?).
- With many methods you can average about 15 moves.
- Josef wanted a 2-look method. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not quite 2-look,
because you need to position UL/UR first.
- There&#x27;s another possibility: Use standard corner-first strategy that
inserts the last L/R-edge and orients M-edges, but without taking care
of corners positions, and look where you are before the last M/M&#x27; move
(you&#x27;re in the middle of UL/UR insertion after orientation).
- After orientation or with Josef&#x27;s technique, instead of solving
UL/UR, you can work with UF/UB. Mmmhh.. no. You could save 2 moves,
but it makes recognition much more difficult.
- With the orientation-first strategy (averaging about 14 moves),
inspection does not take more than 2.3 microseconds. Very few things
to learn, and you can solve very efficently >70% of cases. Add the
standard corners-first technique, a few optimizations, and you reach 90%.

Gilles.

Hehe, I hope you&#x27;re not thinking now that I&#x27;m the PLL master... far 
from that... there are just 2 or 3 I&#x27;m really happy with: T, J and R 
(and J/R only the right hand versions). The F perm is slow for me. I 
use:
R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R2 y&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U (x z&#x27;) R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R2

Seventowns. I am now in a dialogue with Steve Perrin, Director of <br>
Design and Production at Seventowns. What i have suggested is to <br>
modify the wings of the outer edges to make the edge-centers glide <br>
over them much more easily. According to Grant Tregay this fix will <br>
make the turning of inner layers a whole lot better and still leave <br>
the cube fairly tight. Anyway, i have tried his modified cube and i <br>
must say it was really awesome. A tight cube eliminates many other <br>
problems, like popping and rotation of the corner centers. I have also <br>
suggested using machine screws and not centers. And i have mentioned <br>

Hehe, same explanation Jasmine gave me when she showed me the alg 
recently. Then again, she did it somewhat upside down and with wrist 
turns :-). Hey Jasmine, did you change that by now?

I prefer this explanation, though: Start with an easy conjugated 
commutator 3-cycling corner/edge pairs, followed by U&#x27;:
R [L d2 L&#x27;, U&#x27;] R&#x27; U&#x27;
Replace d2 with (U2 y2) and adjust L/R moves:
R L U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27;
And since the L layer is not changed we can do the L move at the end 
instead of the awkward start:
R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L

Can someone help me understand/develop this OLL, maybe similarly as I 
did with the J-perm above?
M U R U R&#x27; U&#x27; M2 U R U&#x27; M R&#x27;

> Ten moves often being quicker than 11 moves, nowadays I use R U&#x27; L 
U2
> R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; 

Hmm, I don&#x27;t think that would work for me. I don&#x27;t know how to do the 
first U2 without regripping and I have problem with R&#x27; L&#x27; though I 
might be able to get that right with practice.

I use Windows Movie Maker for that (and for creating my videos in the 
first place).

Ok boys, let&#x27;s get serious. I just did the J-perm 34 times in 1 
minute. How about you guys? :-)

No, I don&#x27;t think that, but I had seen the videos of the algs you 
just mentioned and all were extremely fast, so I figured you may 
have a good one for the F perm.  That one you use is very similar to 
the one I use; only I don&#x27;t rotate the cube. Well, okay maybe a 
little. :)  

It is just that I go from an F to a U that requires my index finger 
to get over too far that it slows me down at that point. I am 
experimenting with using my ring finger on my right hand for the U 
instead (if it is even called your &quot;ring finger&quot; when it is on your 
right hand).  But I can only do that on my competition cube that is 
very smooth as I don&#x27;t have the strength in that finger as I do in 
my index finger.

Oh, and while we&#x27;re at it, try beating 35 T-perms or 32 R-perms. Man, 
this is tiring...

Hmm. No, not yet! :/

Well yeah, I should rewrite the end... but differently. Ok, here&#x27;s 
what I mainly think so far. First I add a U&#x27; to make the alg 
&quot;complete&quot;, I want to keep the side effects (on the centers) out:

M U (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) M2 (U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) M U&#x27;

Then rewrite the inner part as a commutator:

(M U) [R U R&#x27; U&#x27;, M2] (M&#x27; U&#x27;)

Actually I have two commutators there, the inner one is inside [M,U]. 
The outer one is a bit heavy, but the inner one is easy to understand. 
So let me build a different alg that achieves the same result:

(M U) [R&#x27; U R U&#x27;, M2] (M&#x27; U&#x27;)

Or written out and without the U&#x27; at the end:

M (U R&#x27; U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27; R) M

Yeah ok, the original was better, (R&#x27;M) is nicer than (RM)...

But about the [M,U] again. The first M &quot;flips&quot; the UB edge, then U 
replaces it by another edge which gets flipped with M&#x27;, then U&#x27; 
restores the corners. Apart from those two flipped edges, two more 
were &quot;flipped&quot;, but on the B side. Same game, the M turns flip and the 
U turns replace. A fifth edge was involved, too. To fix the latter 
three edges, the inner commutator is used. Alright, enough with this 
alg for tonight.

Cheers!
Stefan

I could probably have made that list reallylong if i wanted to. So

If I were going to try to learn CLL, this is the page I&#x27;d use to do it.

I was in the past inspired to come up with my own term for &quot;female 
guys&quot;. Like we have prince and princess, steward and stewardess and 
so on, i came up with the idea that a &quot;female guy&quot; should be a 
*guyess*. I think that term is pretty funny ;-)

Is all i can say to that page. That is crazy! Does one have to learn 
all the algs for each case ? :-P 

CLL + OE however is much more than just the CLL. One might need some 
advice for picking best alg for a CLL case from this page.

I&#x27;m sure a more user-friendly complete CLL page must exist :-)

Do you guys think this is a lucky solve or not? The two easy factors <br>
are: a very easy X-cross, and a very easy non-matching pair.<br>
<br>
So... Lucky, or not? Pretty hard to tell... But if I compare to the <br>

that.. Anyway, I&#x27;d like to hear your opinion on this.<br>

I quickly found this solution :

U F2 U&#x27; L2 R2 U2 B U B&#x27; R2 B2 F&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; F D R D&#x27; R D R2 D&#x27; B2 L&#x27; B R2 
B&#x27; L B R2 B (31)

Not by using fridrich though ;-) Easy scramble ...

I would say not lucky.  I mean you planned for every step, and had to
know about non-matching pairs and Xcross to do it.

The more you know, the more often you get easy cases for the things
you know and can get a super nice solve.

I&#x27;d say non-lucky.

My two cents,

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m speaking specifically about BLD solving, but...<br>
<br>
Yesterday I broke my PB for BLD solving. I scrambled with NetCube, <br>
memorised, solved, and looked at the time: 2:24.08. Well, I was pretty <br>
happy with that. But, during my solve, I had just 2 corners wrongly <br>
oriented. So, technically, it&#x27;s a lucky case. But I was thinking:<br>
I can be lucky on a competition...or not? If Oficcial World Records can <br>
contain lucky cases, why not UWR can list them? Of course there are <br>
cases that are *very* lucky, like skipping OLL or PLL, or having no <br>
corners or no edges to orient (on BLD). But there are cases that are <br>
just a bit lucky. So, why not listing them? And another thing: how is a <br>
case defined as lucky to someone who uses Stefan&#x27;s method?<br>
<br>
Well, just my humble opinion, but...<br>

          <div class="email-content">I had an idea about something you could do for UWR, but I don&#x27;t know<br>
if it is lucky or not.<br>
<br>
You know how sometimes someone posts a scramble from their 9-12 second<br>
solve on speedcubing.com, or someone posts on their site &quot;try this<br>
scramble, it&#x27;s fast.&quot;  Well what if you saved up 13 of them, and took<br>
an average?<br>
<br>
You could have 12 extraordinarily easy solves (13 if you pop one),<br>
that would all be random cases and computer scrambled.<br>
<br>
Would this be against the rules or not?  Obviously this is a moot<br>
point for official competitions, but for the UWP how does this work?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is that I&#x27;ve actually considered doing this, but it<br>
just somehow seems like cheating to me.<br>

I think most people are answering if the scramble is lucky, and not 
if the solve is lucky  which is what Joël asked.  Of course there 
is a different way to solve it. If you knew God&#x27;s Algorithm, you 
would solve every scramble in a lot less moves.  If you take his 
scramble and apply a different method to the solution, you will get 
a different result. This is changing the solve portion.  

I think, given the scramble and Joël&#x27;s solution, I agree with Chris 
H.  It is not lucky as he didn&#x27;t skip an OLL or PLL by chance; he 
skipped one CE pair because he knew what to do to preserve it. 
Someone that didn&#x27;t do the cross that way may not have saved the CE 
pair and thus, resulted in a longer solution. 

What was the time, Joël?  If I had to guess, I would say you did 
that sub 12?

I agree that the average record is a much better indicator of a
cuber&#x27;s skill.

But, my question is, what if you compile the scrambles for your
average all from super easy solves when other cubers provide the scramble?

In that case every solve in your average is a super easy scramble.  Is
that a &quot;true&quot; average for a person&#x27;s abilities?

I mean, if you want to have a perfect idea of the average speed of a cuber :
the average should be taken on all the possible configurations of the cube.
But everyone knows that it&#x27;s impossible.

So the best answer I can give is : Use a series of computer generated
scrambles to do an average. Don&#x27;t select any that has already be done
by someone else.

Your point is taken, however, if the scramble is easily solved then
lucky solves are more likely. This may be more easily seen depending
on the solving method used. If a short solve occurs in more than one
method, then virtually any short solve is lucky.

  You can&#x27;t have just 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 corners correctly (or incorrectly) oriented. Always even numbers. So, assuming that the probability of one corner being oriented is 1/3, you have 1/9 of probability of having 2 correct corners. The probability of having 4 correct ones is 1/81. For 6 correct corners is 1/729. And for all 8 corners correct is 1/6561. So, the probability of having a case like I had is 1/729.

If you really want it, I&#x27;m sure they would be able to charge you so
that it covers the shipping cost.
If that doesn&#x27;t work, you could always have it sent to someone you
know outsite Switzerland.
Or...I don&#x27;t know :s

          <div class="email-content">Oh, btw, the probabilities I posted were wrong...I forgot to consider that each corner can be on 8 positions (one at a time, of course). So, the correct is: (from Richard Carr&#x27;s BCFTSS)
   
  0 corners to orient (8 correct) -> 1/2187 (about 0,046%)
  2 corners to orient (6 correct) -> 56/2187 (about 2,6%)
  3 corners to orient (5 correct) -> 112/2187 (about 5%)
  4 corners to orient (you know) -> 420/2187 (about 19,2%) 
  5 corners to orient (     ...     ) -> 560/2187 (about 25,6%)
  6 corners to orient (     ...     ) -> 616/2187 (about 28,2%)
  7 corners to orient (     ...     ) -> 336/2187 (about 15,4%)
  8 corners to orient (     ...     ) -> 86/2187 (about 4%)

  Well, 2,6% is a low probability, but is just for CO, and what this means on the entire solve I don&#x27;t know...

Maybe you should add this one to your list :p (or there can be a
special record list for that easy average, but really is meaningless I
think)

Anyway, congrats for having found this scramble Jason :-)

7 move double extended cross?!

When I was solving this it felt like it would be a new PR for me after
F2L, but then I got super nervous and messed up the LL like crazy, and
the solve ended up being 12.98.  I solved it again and got a 9.9!  Too
bad I couldn&#x27;t do that when it actually mattered :(

My solution:

Not that I&#x27;d agree with that... I&#x27;m still not sure which I like 
better.

But that&#x27;s only in STM :-)

Solving the fourth F2L pair with a shorter alg also results in a 
6-move OLL and then an edge-3-cycle:

y&#x27; U L2 U R&#x27; F R B2
y2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U&#x27; R&#x27;
U&#x27; R2 U2 R U R&#x27; U R2
U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U L F
y R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R U R U&#x27; R

40 HTM

Cheers!
Stefan

(1*2*3 in 2 moves? incredible!)

Once again, easy scrambles that end with many half-turns. I often noticed this fact. Curious.

Gilles.


PS: By the way, I can&#x27;t understand we&#x27;re still discussing what&#x27;s easy or not! The answer lies in averages of 20 solves.

What, it doesn&#x27;t end there! Hey Gilles, try this F2B solve:
(l&#x27; R&#x27;) U&#x27; r2 U&#x27; r&#x27; R&#x27; F U F r U&#x27; L&#x27;

That&#x27;s not only short, it also feels great to execute. I bet with some 
practice one could do this F2B under 2 seconds.

Gilles, can you extend this to a short/fast complete Roux solution?

Oh, and no, this time I didn&#x27;t use the computer, I found that myself :

Cheers!

Single solve gives you all the media attention and the chicks, average 
probably more respect from the cubing community. So average has three 
advantages.

You can in BLD, can&#x27;t you? 

You have a Sune shape on top and a Bruno on the bottom. Surly that&#x27;s
only one corner correct.

I wouldn&#x27;t consider these truly &quot;random&quot;. With real random scrambles I 
bet you&#x27;d *never* get the same scramble as anybody else anytime 
anywhere, so if you get 13 in a row that have appeared for someone 
else, that has nothing to do with randomness.

And for the other nitpicker math geeks who already want to type 
birthday paradox, with &quot;you&quot; I meant Chris alone.

Doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean much. Look at these scrambles:

L2 B2 U L2 R2 U2 F2 R&#x27; D R F U2 L B2 D&#x27; R D2 L2 U&#x27;  (19f) 
L2 B2 D B2 U L2 B2 D2 L&#x27; U2 R D B L&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R2 B&#x27; D B2  (20f) 
R2 U2 B2 D F2 U F2 D2 B2 L F D2 U2 F&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; B  (20f)
 
That&#x27;s what you get when you let Cube Explorer make and solve random 
states. Actually these are what it saves to a file, they&#x27;re the 
inverses of what it shows me on its screen when it&#x27;s running. My point 
is that its solutions end in &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2> so that many half-turns 
at the end aren&#x27;t surprising, yet these scrambles are even more random 
than those cheap 25-move-spitters.

Ok, your step 3 table is easy to understand so I included step 3 as 
well, though with the alg rotated. And I replaced the L&#x27; with l&#x27; at 
the end of F2B. Here are my first three steps:

(l&#x27; R&#x27;) U&#x27;
r2 U&#x27; r&#x27; R&#x27; F U F r U&#x27; l&#x27;
R&#x27; F R F&#x27; U2 F&#x27; U2 F U

Some combinations result in:

x R2 U&#x27; r2 U&#x27; r&#x27; R&#x27; F U F r U&#x27; R2 x F R F&#x27; U2 F&#x27; U2 F U

20 moves HTM and you&#x27;re at step 4 with 6 edges left. But your step 4 
page scares me :-)

Cheers!

With this start, I didn&#x27;t find a *very* short solution, but look at
this one:

[F2B]  xRrU&#x27;r2U2M&#x27;Ur2
[CMLL] y&#x27;U2RU&#x27;R&#x27;yL&#x27;U&#x27;R
[6E4C] U2MUz2U2M&#x27;U2M&#x27;

22 moves, my best (Speed-)FMC. Sub-5s ?

You should change the (l&#x27;R&#x27;) at the beginning of your solve to x R2.
It saves a move and flows a little better.

Finish with y R d (L&#x27;U&#x27;L) B&#x27; U&#x27;(L&#x27;U2 L) U M&#x27; U2 M&#x27; U M u&#x27; M&#x27; D2 M D2
for a typical end.  I think the total in STM winds up as 33 that way.
 Not bad at all. I&#x27;ve gotten sub 11 on this solve this way.

However, if you finish with y R d (L&#x27;U&#x27;L) B&#x27; U&#x27;(L&#x27;U2 L) U M&#x27; U2 M&#x27; U,
but continue with r R d&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M&#x27; d&#x27; R2 it&#x27;s a little easier to perform.

I&#x27;ve tried finishing this solve with every possible orientation trick
and placement trick I know, but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better
than that. :(

With the start x R2 U&#x27; r2 U&#x27; r&#x27; R&#x27; you can follow U R U&#x27; l2 L y&#x27; U&#x27;
(L&#x27;U&#x27;L) for the complete F2L in 15 moves. I couldn&#x27;t find a decent way
to end this, even using a ZB alg.  Still a 30+ move solve.

Or you can start with x R2 U&#x27; r2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; U R U&#x27; M2 to solve
F2l in 13, finishing with y2 (R&#x27; F R) F&#x27; d&#x27; (L&#x27; U L) U&#x27; L2 d&#x27; M U2 M&#x27;
d&#x27; R2 for a nice 29 move solve, including OLL and PLL steps.

Please dont give up on cubing. I am sure you must be very desperate
right now to improve your times but giving up altogether is not the
option. Do take a break of a couple of weeks and then resume again. I
also had many times where i wanted to giveup on cubing altogether but
i kept my cool, took a break and again i find it interesting.

Plz dont give up
Sachin.

For the 5x5 :
It depends on the part of the cube I solve:
If I solve the centers and the edges : I prefer the eastsheen one
If I solve it as a 3x3 : I prefer the Rubik&#x27;s one

The biggest issue for the eastsheen 5x5 is that you really need to
have the layers aligned to be able to turn it, which is not exactly
the case for the Rubik&#x27;s 5x5.

          <div class="email-content">Recemmendations:

- Use the cube a lot (im serious, this helps!)

- If the cube is really tight, wait some weeks (50-100 solves) 
before lubing for the first time.

- It is possible to use a flat knife to bend the layers. Im very 
uncertain if this has any effect on the rivets though.

- Disassemble the cube many times over. I know this helps. It helps 
loosening any puzzle.

- Sand down the wings of outer edges, like mentioned in my earlier 
post, and suggested to me by Grant Tregay.

Good luck !

You can in BLD, can&#x27;t you? 

You have a Sune shape on top and a Bruno on the bottom. Surly that&#x27;s
only one corner correct.

Thanks Mike for your examples, watching Gilles go fewest moves is very 
interesting, but watching a more realistic speedsolve is also nice. 
It&#x27;s bugging me that I don&#x27;t understand how it works, looks like I 
have to learn his method. The above solution btw doesn&#x27;t work, 
probably there&#x27;s one wrong/missing M turn.

Cheers!

Alright, how could I even dare to think my start was good :-). But

Heh, I solve that OLL differently, resulting in this:

x R2 U&#x27; r2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; U R U&#x27; M2
y2 F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U R U&#x27; R&#x27;
R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L

It&#x27;s the J-perm :-). Cancelling moves and doing the y2 at the start 
you get this:

x y2
L2 U&#x27; l2 U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; l&#x27; U L U&#x27; M2
F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U R
U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L

29 STM, 30 HTM!

Gonna practice this and make a video...

Hmm, how do you make it play 40 fps? It only shows me 20 fps. Also, 
how can it show 40 fps when the video only has 30 fps?

          <div class="email-content">Bah, I feel like nobody even saw my typo-joke :-(

Ok, now about lucky cases with my method. Well, the rules say:

For blindfold solving a lucky case is defined by:
1) more than 5 corners are correctly oriented, or
2) more than 8 edges are correctly oriented, or
3) more than 3 corners are correctly positioned, or
4) more than 4 edges are correctly positioned.

Obviously the writer didn&#x27;t know my method :-). I don&#x27;t consider 1) or 
2) lucky since correct orientation doesn&#x27;t help me at at all, actually 
&quot;orientation&quot; doesn&#x27;t even exist for me unless a piece is correctly 
positioned. For 3) and 4) I don&#x27;t count correctly positioned pieces 
with bad orientation, since these are just as hard as &quot;normal&quot;, i.e. 
mispositioned pieces. For me I&#x27;d say a lucky case is defined by:

1) more than 2 corners are correctly positioned and oriented, or
2) more than 3 edges are correctly positioned and oriented.

Those are the only cases that really save work. I lowered the number a 
bit, though. Not sure they&#x27;re good now, I don&#x27;t know where the 
original numbers came from, but I think these rules come very close to 
what it optimally should be.

Cheers!
Stefan

Ok, a much more realistic example of speedcubing.

- Inspection

(Too) Easy 1st block, let&#x27;s try to look ahead. You can see that if you
finish the block in a very simple way, RFD and RF will be aligned, and
DR&#x27;s place in R-layer will be preserved.

- 1st bloc

Seq: xR2U

- 2nd bloc

Seq:r2U&#x27;R&#x27;Ul&#x27;U&#x27;M2R&#x27;UR
Comment: Solve the 1x2x2 prepared during inspection with r2U&#x27;R&#x27;Ul&#x27;.
For the last pair, align BDR with BR (U&#x27;), and solve it. The last move
is a R and not a r to preserve centers orientation.

- Corners

Seq: U2lULU&#x27;R&#x27;UL&#x27;U&#x27;x
Comment: The first U2 aligns U-layer to match my way of analyzing this
orientation pattern.

- 6 edges + 4 centers

Seq:M&#x27;UMUMUMU2M&#x27;UM&#x27;U2M2
Comment:At this end of the previous step, before the last x, I&#x27;ve
located the positions of UL and UR. In this configuration, do an M&#x27;
move and 3 wrongly oriented edges will appear on top. Then, I do UMUM
and not UMUM&#x27; because having both UL and UR in U-layer is not what I
want. UMU2M&#x27;UM&#x27;U2M2 solves UL+UR and permutes M-edges.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

I agree, don&#x27;t give up just because you&#x27;re improvement has slowed.  My
times were also around 50 seconds for a few months straight.  Don&#x27;t
get frustrated by the times you see from others, remember that
everyone used to be at 50 seconds because everyone who can solve it
used to not be able to solve it.

What got me past 50 seconds was learning a better method.  The method
I was using at the time was a beginner method, and I switched to a
more speedcubing style method.  There are lots of methods to choose
from, all of which are fast, so just find the one you like.

Don&#x27;t get frustrated, not everyone who cubes is super fast at
improving their times.  You can get fast times too, just remember that
the method you use and the finger tricks and styles you use all
influence your time.  If you are already using a speedcubing method
framework, try learning more algs.  All the methods have lots of
additional algs you can learn that help speed up your times.

How do you solve and how many algs do you use in general?

Try new things, and experiment too.  Maybe you&#x27;ll find that you like
the 2x2x2, or 4x4x4, or fewest moves cubing more than speedcubing.

Don&#x27;t give up though, not everyone improves super quickly.  It took me
over 4 years just to get a sub-20 average, whereas most people do it
in under a year.

We normal people do in fact exist, and I&#x27;m still convinced that all
the others are cubing robots :-)

          <div class="email-content">This is the definition of a lucky case (according to speedcubing.com) :

---

A lucky record is any solve of a puzzle where a step of your normal
solution is skipped.
There are three exceptions:
1) You worked for it, f.i. by anticipating the next step.
2) The chance to skip the step is 20 percent or more.
3) The skipped step represents 3 percent or less of the total moves of
the complete solution.
Example: if you use the cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system, then there are 7
steps, and skipping one of the steps would be a lucky case.

For blindfold solving a lucky case is defined by:
1) more than 5 corners are correctly oriented, or
2) more than 8 edges are correctly oriented, or
3) more than 3 corners are correctly positioned, or
4) more than 4 edges are correctly positioned.

---

So if you do that center cycling intentionally, I would say you are in
the first exception &quot;You worked for it&quot; = Non-Lucky, even though it&#x27;s
contrary to the definition of a lucky case definition for a blindfold
solve. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.

And talking about lucky cases is just silly by the way.
I mean you can always win a lottery, but what if you can find a way to
win all the times ?
I&#x27;ll try not to talk anymore about lucky cases.

          <div class="email-content">Speaking of cool cube locking mechanisms, is it possible to fashion
some sort of locking mechanism out of a 3x3x3 keychain cube?  Or if
that would require working with pieces that are too small, a regular
3x3x3 cube?

I just think it would be cool to lock up a cabinet or locker or
something with a scrambled cube.  You could even set the opening
combination of the lock to a cool pattern, so even people who know how
to solve the cube can&#x27;t open it, unless they know which pattern :-)

Ok maybe this is a little too out there, but I thought it would be cool.

Gilles I think that is a very cool idea to have a computer logon be
solving a cube.  Perhaps you should set the combination to the
superflip or something, so you can even trick people who know how to
solve the cube ;-)

Little correction: that was intended for *any* 3x3 BLD method. I just 
see a larger advantage for those who orient and permute separately. I 
don&#x27;t see a big advantage for my own method, which, btw, *is* a cycle 
method, too. As far as I know, only Dave Orser and Richard Carr might 
be doing something different than cycle-methods, but they do orient 
first, so my idea certainly applied to their method, too!

Cheers!
Stefan

Maybe maybe that might work in the peaceful hidden area of the math 
department, but in the real world you&#x27;d need at least a hard metal 
cube to make that work...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles,

thanks a lot for the detailed analysis! You should put that example 
(including the scramble) on your website.

Haha, I was about to say you had no example solves on your site. To be 
sure I looked closer again and found some, but they&#x27;re hidden and hard 
to find :-). Also, there&#x27;s no explanation so I&#x27;d still recommend 
putting this one on your site. Oh, and can you split the 6x1 block of 
applets into a 3x2 block? At least my browser (Opera) shows them in 
one long line, widening the page and making the texts harder to read 
cause I have to scroll left and right...

Cheers!
Stefan

If you can understand the cube well enough and look ahead well enough
there are no lucky cubes.

Don&#x27;t worry too much about it. In official competitions it doesn&#x27;t

Have a circuit inside the cube which is only completed when the cube
is in a particular configuration. When it gets there it sends out a
signal which unlocks the safe. This is not hard at all, and could be
done with technology available.

The one where six corners were correctly oriented, right? Depends on 
your method, I&#x27;d say. If for example you use my method then unless 
those pieces were correctly placed as well, I think it shouldn&#x27;t be 
considered lucky. If however your method involves first orienting all 
pieces (particularly the corners) then the rules are made for you and 
thus it&#x27;s a lucky case which you shouldn&#x27;t post.

Similarly in speedcubing, what if you&#x27;re a Fridrich solver and the 
cross is already solved after scrambling? Definitely lucky. The same 
cube, for a pure corners-first solver? Probably not lucky (at least 
not because of the solved cross). It always depends on your method, 
and also the actual solve in case you have choices. Blindsolving 3x3 
for example does not offer many choices, you almost &quot;read&quot; the 
solution deterministically, and even the choices you make usually 
don&#x27;t change the difficulty of the solve much. In speedsolving this is 
more important, since already for example how you build the cross has 
large effects on the rest of the solve.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I am by no means an expert at the F2L.  I think I used to average<br>
around 11-12 seconds before switching to opposite color + Xcross combo<br>
solving.<br>
<br>
Well I took an F2L average tonight and am now sub-10!  All I changed<br>
from my 11-12 second averages was to add in opposite color solving.<br>
<br>
Now I am pretty nearly 1-(1-x)^2 times more likely to get good solves<br>
(where x is my good solve frequency on one color) as I used to be. <br>
That is very, very noticeable!!  Of course I can&#x27;t always notice well<br>
setup Xcross&#x27;s on my opposite color, but I can always spot a good<br>
cross.  I hope to change that soon with more practice and always spot<br>
the good opposite color Xcross solves.<br>
<br>
Anyway here was the average:<br>
11.50, 8.86, 9.69, 10.18, 10.78, (7.20), 9.41, (12.68), 11.20, 7.94,<br>
9.62, 8.36 = 9.75 seconds<br>
<br>
The thing is, I am not a sub-10 F2L solver if I solve the same color<br>
every time.  However, with the combination of opposite color as well<br>
as Xcross, and not just Xcross, I can now call myself a sub-10 F2L<br>
solver :-)<br>
<br>
Think what you already sub-10 solvers could do with opposite color<br>
solving ;-)<br>

<br>
The holidays are coming up soon, which means some free time for most <br>
cubers!  With this extra time, not only could we improve ourselves, we <br>
could teach others how much fun the cube really is.  Lets each make a <br>
goal to teach at least one person to solve the cube before the new <br>
year.  There are plenty of people around us all the time that may be <br>
curious about the cube, but are too shy or intimidated to ask about it!<br>
<br>
Happy Cubing Always,<br>

http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/speedsolving/3x3/

There are 2 or 3 that I haven&#x27;t posted yet, there&#x27;s a new F perm and 
the way I used to create it might work for your current F perm as 
well. There are also two short Y perms in &lt;U,R,L>, one of them the one

only 14 quarter turns, that&#x27;s probably at least shorter than what you

Yeah, thanks, that was just stupid. Those texts go through a PHP 
function anyway so I should&#x27;ve just looked up the htmlentities 
function which I now did. Fixed.

Hi Lars,

yeah, I&#x27;m very happy with that one :-). I was never good with the 
&quot;standard&quot; algorithm you see on many pages (where you do 7 moves 
twice) and with this one you also don&#x27;t regrip or rotate the cube at 
the start.

Hey, could it be the pictures on your PLL page (http://www.cubezone.
be/pll.html) are broken?

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">For F2L start off by learning all the cases. You should be able to 
instantly know what to do for each case. It&#x27;s all about PRACTICE. A 
LOT. 

I estimate that I solve the cube more than 50 times every day. I 
don&#x27;t time every solve, but I&#x27;m always trying to look ahead during 
F2L. Practice in ~80% of your maximum speed and you&#x27;ll soon be able 
to increase speed and still look ahead.

Awesome times there. It&#x27;s hard to catch up on you when you&#x27;re always

better and more consistant then ever. I set an average redcord too

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

It could be that im stupid ;-)

But what is really the difference between multi-cross solving and 
the old discussion about whether to solve with the cross on same 
face (same color) or not ??

When it comes to it, you choose ONE cross that you solve first, and 
that&#x27;s it! Having to consider too many possible cross-starts, 
doesn&#x27;t that make it impossible to use the 15 secs beyond simply 
study how to do the cross. Choosing a cross early (fixed color) it 
is possible to use the 15 secs seeing beyond the cross i guess.

By the way, im not a fridrich/cross solver ;-)

Cheers!

<br>
Thanks! My goal was to average sub-20 before Christmas and I achieved<br>
it, though it was a very lucky average. Times were: 18.63 22.68 16.02<br>
15.38 21.58 21.00 (14.96) POP (24.06) 20.10 18.02 22.36 23.53.<br>
15.38 and 14.96 were lucky, and one time had also a PLL-skip. That<br>
16.02 wasn&#x27;t lucky, just very easy.<br>
I usually average maybe 23-25 seconds, so this average was<br>
unbelievable... I want to prove that Petrus method is very fast, I<br>
just have to practice more. Btw my cube is awful... It pops very<br>
often, during that 20.10 one or two pieces popped out and I lost some<br>
time because of that.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Per,

I&#x27;ve noticed that I can get a &quot;feel&quot; for whether white is good or bad.

Basically I&#x27;ve been solving white for years so my strategy for a while
(which I&#x27;m trying to change) is to examine white first.  If white is
&quot;bad&quot; I then examine yellow.

What I&#x27;ve been working on lately is taking a quick scan of both sides
(1-2 seconds) and seeing a) are there any blocks for an Xcross and b)
is this color &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;?

I then always choose the best cross or if I see a block or two with a
promising setup for an Xcross on either color I choose that one.

I&#x27;ve actually been training myself for a while to not use the full
inspection time, so that in a competition 15 seconds will seem like a
LOT.  I try to always inspect and put the cube down in 6-7 seconds or
less.  So now when I use all 15 it&#x27;s like 2 inspections for me, and is
enough time to look at both white and yellow.

Basically if you get yourself used to inspecting very quickly, then 15
seconds will actually feel like a lot, and you can definitely inspect
two colors during that time.  But again that takes practice to get
used to inspecting in 6-7 every time.

If you want a timer just like the ones that are used in competitions :
you should look for stackmats (timer used in speedstacking).
www.speedstacks.com if I&#x27;m not wrong.

Have fun !

I guess I&#x27;m personally partial to &quot;extended cross&quot; since that&#x27;s just
what I&#x27;ve always called it.  I did think about calling it some sort of
&quot;fish&quot; name when I first posted about it though (since it does look
like a fish), but thought extended cross sounded more &quot;official&quot; :-P

Why not just post the video files for download so that they can be

ofcourse i do keep them offline, but just i need to spend some extra
time on that. But for others who dont know some comp stuff, they are
in trouble.

So plz ppl keep the video files free for download. Or maybe i&#x27;ll write
a tutorial for the real n00bs as to how to download the flv files
themselves and view them offline. but its really no use playing
cat-and-mouse here, afterall you are doing this for the community
itself. The only reason i can think of is that everyone wants more
visitors to their site. I really see no point in that.

Please don&#x27;t be -- blame the stupid Babylonians (or whoever it was) for

  Hey guys,

I added a brand new finger trick section to my site. Check it out at: 
www.solvethecube.co.uk. I hope you will like it. There&#x27;s still a 
little problem with watching the videos in IE... Does anyone have an 
idea how to solve that?

Actually it feels much better rearranged like this:

L&#x27; (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) (L U&#x27; L) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) (L&#x27; U)

Ok, one more adjustment, after a few minutes practice I can already do 
4 times in a row under 12 seconds:

(U L&#x27;) (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) (L U&#x27; L) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R r&#x27;)

Hey Joel, how do you like that for finger tricks? :-)

Cheers!

Oh, and the F&lt;->B mirror for the &quot;other&quot; case, with a bonus M&#x27; for the 
ring finger pullers among us:

(U&#x27; L) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) (L&#x27; U L&#x27;) (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; M&#x27;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s been long enough since I solved the 20x20 supercube that I&#x27;m <br>
wanting to solve it again.  (Yes I did say before that my first solve <br>
would be my last...I guess I lied)  Hopefully this time I do better <br>
than 19+ hours.<br>
<br>
Lately I&#x27;ve just been trying to get better at solving the first <br>
center, and I think soon I will be sub-20(minutes) on that.  I think <br>
after applying some new tricks and achieving better efficiency ~15 <br>
minutes on average for the first center will be possible.<br>
<br>
The opposite center is kind of a pain honestly.  I haven&#x27;t dedicated <br>
much work to this, but my current method is building vertical rows in <br>
the middle layer and inserting them on their target side.  There must <br>
be a better way.<br>
<br>
For the 3rd and 4th center I use the same method as I just <br>
mentioned,, but with horizontal rows.  This also tends to be <br>
painfully slow, but not as bad as the 2nd center, as I know all my <br>
pieces will be in the middle layer.  Of course as I move on finding <br>
pieces is easier.<br>
<br>
The 5th and 6th center are kind of a pain.  As I seperate the two in <br>
the middle layer, I direct solve one, and leave the other in chaos to <br>
be fixed later.  Surely there&#x27;s a way to direct solve both?  This <br>
would probably save 45-60 minutes(!) as cycling centers on a single <br>
face takes much too long. Keep in mind this is cycling 3 centers at <br>
once...I&#x27;m not Per who&#x27;d probably just solve the last center in one <br>
go..:P (Just kidding Per...I know you&#x27;re human...two algs to fix <br>
right? ;)   Seriously though, there is a lot of time lost here so any <br>
suggestions would be welcome<br>
<br>
Initially I was solving the 6th center very last, so I could use it <br>
as a breaking ground for my parity algs, which mess with the center <br>
it&#x27;s applied over.  If I do learn a way of solving the 5th and 6th <br>
center together, I&#x27;m going to need center preserving parity algs.  <br>
Doug Li found a couple for me, but I&#x27;ve lost them since then (sorry <br>
Doug!)<br>
<br>
Everything from this point on would be standard.  Supercubing doesn&#x27;t <br>
mess up edge pairing approaches and solving as a 3x3 isn&#x27;t too <br>
difficult.  For those of you who will help me, thanks in advance.  <br>
For those of you who don&#x27;t like supercubing...sorry for the post :P<br>
<br>
Happy Cubing<br>
<br>

More pissed than I am about my Magic Balls average coming out to 8.01
and my Master Magic average coming out to 3.03 and my Magic single
best being 1.05, 1.16 average (okay, so sub-1 is a little hard for
that one), and my 2x2x2 best being 5.12?  My best clock solve is
24.00, too.

The topper is my fastest official Master Magic time being 3.00
seconds. :P  Though, admittedly, it didn&#x27;t bother me that it wasn&#x27;t
sub-3 until Stefan beat it. ;)  Round numbers are just there to bother
you.

The whole concept of &quot;round numbers&quot; is flawed already, in my opinion 
these don&#x27;t even exist. For example, you might consider &quot;10.00&quot; to be 
a round number, but that&#x27;s not really the number, only one out of 
infinitely many representations of it. In binary it would already look 
like &quot;1010&quot; and just imagine what happens if you take for example Pi 
as base. Or the representation where you&#x27;d write &quot;XXXXXXXXXX&quot;, which 
doesn&#x27;t look any rounder than &quot;XXXXXXXXX&quot;. Or... etc. Not even 0 
(zero), which looks the same and &quot;round&quot; in many used representations, 
looks like a round number anymore when I represent numbers by writing 
them the &quot;normal&quot; way after subtracting 42.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">This is really impressive Bob, I admire all the people who want to try
the ZB Adventure.

I&#x27;ve tried to learn some ZB LL cases but at the moment I don&#x27;t really
find any improvement for me. As I am very bad at recognition for
special cases. (8 seconds to recognise and execute 2 algs for the LL
is really really bad), I don&#x27;t think that recognisiong a ZB case will
be any easier.
+ I still see all the possible improvements I can do on how I use the
Fridrich Method (more fluency, faster execution of OLL and PLL, faster
recognition for the OLL and PLL, X-Cross, ...)

Really, ZB is not for me.

And btw, congratulations for your improvements on your times thx to ZB :-)

must admit that most of the people use that idea.
So when you say to someone that you can solve it just in 3 seconds
(whatever the puzzle is), it won&#x27;t make a very big difference to
someone outside the &quot;Cube World&quot; if it was actually a 2.99 or a 3.01.
But in the contrary, even though it&#x27;s really silly and maybe
meaningless, 2.99 is much better than 3.01 :p

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan !

Im trying to understand ur way of thinking but i think u are 
seriously mistaken. If u talk about rounding off errors that&#x27;s 
another matter. The concept of integers is well founded in maths and 
in reality. U can indeed have exactly 10 stones or 42 apples or 
whatever. Measuring 10 seconds (10.00) on a computer won&#x27;t mean that 
we know that there are infinitely many 0&#x27;s after the comma. But 
noone says it does mean so either ;-) It is just the human mind that 
wants to simplify and say: hey 10.00 that&#x27;s *exactly* 10 (the 
natural number 10). Oh well, this has nothing whatsoever to do with 
cubing ;-)

Sorry guys ... (+ guyesses)

          <div class="email-content">I actually switch around, cross on bottom and on left, depending on 
either (1) the F2L case, because sometimes I can execute the cross on 
bottom alg faster than the cross on left alg, or (2) how I end up 
holding the cube after solving a CE pair.  I try not to waste time 
repositioning my grip when I don&#x27;t have to.  I would say that about 
60-70% of the time, I am using cross on left algs, though.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

no, the point is that a number and a representation of a number are 
not the same. You can&#x27;t even write down or tell me a number - at all! 
Only a representation of the number you mean. For example, you write 
&quot;10 seconds&quot; and I can only *assume* that you mean &quot;ten seconds&quot;, but 
maybe you&#x27;re talking binary and mean &quot;two seconds&quot;? The 
*representation* of a number can look &quot;round&quot;, never the number 
itself. Firstly because it doesn&#x27;t look at all, and secondly because 
in different representations it can look differently. In some of them 
it might look &quot;round&quot;, in others not. Got it now? Distinguish between 
numbers and their representations, that&#x27;s all.

Cheers!
Stefan

P.S. Even saying &quot;two&quot; or &quot;ten&quot; is not much better than &quot;2&quot; or &quot;10&quot;, 
since maybe the word &quot;two&quot; means a different number for you than it 
does for me. Or if you&#x27;re a weird alien from Mars and use the same 
notation as we humans but with the digit symbols &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;7&#x27; swapped, 
then &quot;3.00&quot; will not look round for you because it&#x27;ll look to you like 
&quot;3.77&quot; looks to us which we wouldn&#x27;t call &quot;round&quot;.

Watching this video of Ron I&#x27;m convinced that stackmat is broken:
http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jnoort/videos/Ron_13.97.avi

When I solve as fast as that, my timer always claims 18 or so. Well, 
maybe *my* timer is broken :-). But seriously, he doesn&#x27;t look all 
that fast. Gotta watch myself on video and find where I waste so much 
time.

<br>
&gt; Hi Per,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; no, the point is that a number and a representation of a number are<br>
&gt; not the same. You can&#x27;t even write down or tell me a number - at all!<br>
&gt; Only a representation of the number you mean. For example, you write<br>
&gt; &quot;10 seconds&quot; and I can only *assume* that you mean &quot;ten seconds&quot;, but<br>
&gt; maybe you&#x27;re talking binary and mean &quot;two seconds&quot;? The<br>
&gt; *representation* of a number can look &quot;round&quot;, never the number<br>
&gt; itself. Firstly because it doesn&#x27;t look at all, and secondly because<br>
&gt; in different representations it can look differently. In some of them<br>
&gt; it might look &quot;round&quot;, in others not. Got it now? Distinguish between<br>
&gt; numbers and their representations, that&#x27;s all.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Cheers!<br>
&gt; Stefan<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; P.S. Even saying &quot;two&quot; or &quot;ten&quot; is not much better than &quot;2&quot; or &quot;10&quot;,<br>
&gt; since maybe the word &quot;two&quot; means a different number for you than it<br>
&gt; does for me. Or if you&#x27;re a weird alien from Mars and use the same<br>
&gt; notation as we humans but with the digit symbols &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;7&#x27; swapped,<br>
&gt; then &quot;3.00&quot; will not look round for you because it&#x27;ll look to you like<br>
&gt; &quot;3.77&quot; looks to us which we wouldn&#x27;t call &quot;round&quot;.<br>

In yet other words: how you represent numbers that represent the time 
is just as arbitrary as how you measure the time in the first place, 
like Mike pointed out already :-)

Another cubist who has a very relaxed-looking style is Leyan Lo.  
Maybe it has something to do with the fluidity of motion.  Some 
cubists have a very quick &quot;jerky&quot; motion that maybe just looks 
faster.  Perhaps others seem to be slower-moving, but finish faster by 
having a total lack of hesitation?

I feel like Ron&#x27;s solve is very very fast. When I solve it in 18
seconds, it doesn&#x27;t feel that fast. But if I watch it on video, I&#x27;m
amazed. :p (and moreover if I watch some faster videos I did).
In terms of number of move per second, this one was about 5 (Ron&#x27;s).
And there are a very few people who can handle such a speed.

          <div class="email-content">Ya . Actually i also think that video&#x27;s are very different than the real thing.

Even when i saw my own video, i was amazed with myself! It feels very
different when watching someones video, even if the someone is you! As
for Ron, hes fast of course, but when i saw him solve in person, i
noticed that hes very consistent with his speed...there were almost no
lockups during all of his solves. Maybe he has a lot of practice
looking ahead and that helps him a lot. Also knowing all the OLL and
Pll algs also helps :)

That&#x27;s just waffling leading nowhere:-P Then one could say it&#x27;s 
coincidence that a CUBE is called &quot;cube&quot;, it could have been 
called &quot;brumprum&quot; or whatever ... And likewise this whole post could 
have looked like : &quot;&amp;/(&amp;0  7437 6076876/%/&amp;%67 &quot; if the english

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone<br>
<br>
What is a good Avg for Last Layer? <br>
I took an avg today for step 4 of Gilles MEthod.  I haven&#x27;t cubed a<br>
lot this week, but I did pretty well.   <br>
<br>
(2.98), 3.39, 4.98, 5.78, 7.48, 6.58, 6.67, 3.53, 7.50, 5.34, (12.18),<br>
7.48             Step 4 Avg  5.87 sec<br>
<br>
This step is kind of like OLL/PLL. First you Orient 6 edges, then<br>
Permute 6 edges.  Step 4 averages only 15 moves, but there are a lot<br>
of slice moves.  If you can avg 3 moves a sec, you can do step 4 in<br>
about 5 seconds.<br>
<br>
CFOP<br>
Cross   - 7 moves<br>
CE Pair - 7 moves<br>
CE Pair - 7 moves<br>
CE Pair - 7 moves<br>
CE Pair - 7 moves<br>
OLL     -  ?<br>
PLL     - ?<br>
<br>
ROUX<br>
B1     -  9 moves<br>
B2     -  16 moves (2 for DR edge and 7 for each CE pair)<br>
CLL    -  ? <br>
Step 4 -  15 moves<br>
<br>
So F2L is about 35 moves (11.67 sec at 3 moves/sec)<br>
and F2B is about 25 moves (8.33 sec at 3 moves/sec)(10 sec at 2.5<br>
moves/sec) <br>
<br>
Step 4 is about 15 moves (5 sec at 3 moves/sec)(6 sec at 2.5 moves/sec)<br>
<br>
I think due to slice moves it&#x27;s hard to do 3 moves/sec for Step 4, so<br>
2.5 moves/sec is a better estimate.<br>
Todays avg of 5.87sec would be 2.56 moves/sec.<br>
<br>
<br>
What are the HTM averages for OLL and PLL?<br>
<br>
WHat about COLL and CLL?  CLL must be less..<br>
<br>
And What is a good Last Layer Time Average?<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>

It sounds like you got the point. Speed isn&#x27;t everything.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I must say that I also admire Ron for his way of solving the cube. I 
remember one solve he did during practice on the german cube day, 
which was sub-12. I was so amazed with his fluent moves and asked if 
it was non-lucky which it was.

I&#x27;m practicing myself on looking ahead during F2L, and it&#x27;s starting 
to give results. My average as know 17.20 but I feel that I can cut of 
at least one second more if I turn the cube as fluent as Ron.

As you can see the t-shirt has no text at all. The text u can see is 
just added to the picture after the picture was shot ;-)

Haha ... i get ur point though. It would have been a great t-shirt 
yes. But what about the remaining 1000 kinds of people ?? :-P

Have fun!

If I&#x27;m not mistaken I&#x27;ll get a binary wristwatch for xmas. It has got 2

Did you account for recognition in this average?  If so, how did you
do so?  How did you time yourself, also?

But in OLL you orient EIGHT pieces and then in PLL you permute EIGHT
pieces, so it seems to me you are doing 33% more work, right? 
Wouldn&#x27;t that make Step 4 a little less equivalent to OLL/PLL?  Even
if you took a CLL -> ELL approach (which is equivalent to OLL/PLL in
number of moves and in speed), then in the first step you are
orienting AND permuting 4 pieces and then doing the same in the second
step.  It seems to me that no matter what, the last 6 edges should be
faster than OLL/PLL.

Well, that&#x27;s not really fair.  The average F2L is approximately 30
moves for a good speedcuber.  I think my average for F2L may actually
be around 28-29 moves.  The cross average should only be 6, but who
doesn&#x27;t use open slots, especially for the first couple pairs?  I
think 30 moves is a much more accurate representation.  OLL averages
are about 9 moves and PLL I believe is about 14 moves.  That makes for
approximately 51-53 moves for CFOP.

I think CLL is about 9 moves on average.  This makes a total of about
49 or so moves.

Again, I think 35 moves for F2L average is way too high.

I believe 9 and 14 moves (approximately).

> WHat about COLL and CLL?  CLL must be less..

CLL should be around 9 moves and COLL probably around 12 or so.

> And What is a good Last Layer Time Average?

That depends on what you consider good.  I think some of the faster
guys have a LL around 4-5 seconds.  I belive mine is about 5-6
seconds, slightly faster on a good day.  When I set my sub-20 average,
my F2L average was about 15 seconds, so I probably cut a bit of time
off at the F2L and had a really good LL.  My fastest time was 13.34,
but I doubt I&#x27;ve ever had a sub-10 F2L solve. ;)

1.93 for flipping two corners.  Timed with Jnetcube starting with cube
in my hands (since it would be for LL).

And yes I avoided considering stuff like the U perm for a ZBLL case ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Well, if I learn 48 ZBLL algs, then my fastest non-lucky LL would
technically be the H-perm, at under 1 second if I do it perfectly. :)

I did Sune + H-perm in 2.38 seconds, timed on Stackmat starting with
the cube in hands. :)  That is probably my fastest nonlucky LL right now.

You are using Fridrich, but you haven&#x27;t seen Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s 
page? :)

http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html

I also time myself with the stackmat, but I don&#x27;t really like to 
start with the cube in my hand... It&#x27;s a bit of an unnatural way of 
using the timer, I think.

<br>
To answer your questions Bob,<br>
<br>
I do preinspect, but only for 2 sec, as it only takes a fraction of a<br>
second to recognize the orientation case for step 4.  You can see all<br>
6 edges when you&#x27;re doing step 3, so It&#x27;s like preinspection anyway. <br>
In addition to that I always align my centers prior to doing step 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
I use a stackmat, cube on the mat, hands on the &quot;hand things.&quot; Just<br>
like a normal solve<br>
<br>
F2L <br>
I thought that 35 was a good number to aim for.  Thats what I had<br>
heard .  But 30 is an Ok number. <br>
CROSS 6 moves<br>
CE Pair 6 moves each<br>
So in Theory<br>
So F2L at 3moves/s is 10 sec<br>
and F2B at 3 moves/s is 8.33 sec<br>
<br>
OLL PLL<br>
If OLL is 9 moves and PLL is 14 moves, then it is a 23 move avg for<br>
LL.  So to be Sub 6, you need 4 moves/sec.  The point I was trying to<br>
make is that even turning the cube at a rate of 2.5 moves/sec,  you<br>
can do Step 4 in sub 6.  At 4 moves/sec, step 4 is sub 4 (3.75).<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t see how 4 moves/sec is possible with slice moves though. =(<br>

Oh, come on!  Haven&#x27;t you seen my videos for the H-perm and Z-perms?

http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/pll/pll04.avi (1.6 second Z)
http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/pll/pll05.avi (1.1 second H)

Both of these use nothing but M&#x27; and U (well, and M2 and U2) ;) 
Slices can be quite fast! :P

I do slice turns as r&#x27;R and rR&#x27;.  My first attempt, I got a 10.01.  I
averaged a little over 9 seconds for M U M U&#x27;.  M&#x27; turns are much
faster.  I can average under 8 seconds for M&#x27; U M&#x27; U&#x27;.  I can also
average under 9 for M&#x27; U M U&#x27;, which seems a little closer to actual
Roux solving.  That&#x27;s ~4.4 moves per second.

M and U turn algs are incredibly fast.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons his
method is so quick.  I&#x27;d really like to find out how many cases there
are, and the average length of them for all the step 4 algs where the
6 edges are oriented correctly.  If anyone wants to fire up Acube and
get it to do this, I would much appreciate it.

          <div class="email-content">This is how I do Step 4<br>
<br>
1. Orient all 6 edges and pair up ledge and redge in DF and DB.<br>
2. Do a U adjustment and Throw in the pair. Do your 4 move PLL.<br>
<br>
2. is usually 7 moves.  The 2nd part is basically the 2nd table on<br>
Joseph&#x27;s site about 6 edge solving.  I think the 1st Table is the same<br>
as 1. but center orientation is not a factor.  I always put either the<br>
red or orange center on top.<br>
<br>
I always do it this way, unless after orientation, there is a ledge or<br>
redge in place.  Or if yellow is in whites place or vice versa.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if a ZB like table is worth doing.  The whole step is<br>
only about 15 moves, and very intuitive.  However, PLL skips are nice,<br>
and somewhat frequent.  I think that avoiding PLL everytime is<br>
possible   somehow...  <br>

First 12 solves I tried, I wound up with a 6.01 average for the step.
 My best was a 3.30 and worst was 8.55.  It should have been about
half that, but I locked up badly.  Average number of moves was 13. 
The 3.30 case was one with correct orientation.  Are the odds of this
1/28?  Is there any way to try to help this at an earlier stage?

I think learning all of the algs to simultaneously permute the final 6
edges once oriented would be a good idea.  It should be &lt;30.  These
ought to all be fast cases, using primarily M and U turns.  You could
use them after you orient the edges, or on the chance of an O6E skip.
 I would also advise learning the ELL algs, in the event that the F2L
is completed after Step 3.  This gives you a total alg count of
something like 100.  Not bad.

Another idea that might help ease the L6E is to try to preserve
correct orientation by using COLL algs, and to try to change bad
orientation using CLL algs.  You can get from most possible
orientation cases to the 3 incorrect edges on top configuration or the
correct orientation using COLL, or a CLL alg that flips DF and UL or R
, and one for DF and UF. DF and UB would be unnecessary, because you
could just do d2 and perform the DF and UF alg.  Of course, this now
gives us something like 160 algs for Step 3, instead of the normal 40,
bringing the total alg number closer to 200.  However, we would get
correct or nearly correct edge orientation 25/28 of the time.  This is
where the single alg to place edges would come in very handy.  For the
other three cases (where an opposite pair of edges on U or D are
incorrect), you could attempt to change the orientation, and then
apply an alg, or just leave them and know ahead of time what you will
get.  You could also try using algs for the UD+DF cases that leave the
UB and UF pieces where they are, so that you could do an M, followed
by the UD+DF alg, and finish with another M.

Of course, this is a far cry from the normal 50 or so algs this method
uses, or even the 78 from CFOP. But it&#x27;s still a much more sane number
than the 797 for ZB. 

I can&#x27;t find any way to help towards P6E skips yet, but I&#x27;ll keep at it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi All -<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m in the process of switching my 4-look LL order from:<br>
<br>
OE (Orient Edges) / PC (Permute Corners) / OC (Orient Corners) / PE <br>
(Permute Edges)<br>
<br>
to:<br>
<br>
OE / OC / PC / PE<br>
<br>
As I work through it, I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m getting more &quot;lucky&quot; <br>
solves, where I end up skipping one of the above steps.<br>
<br>
Thinking about it for a while, I came up with the following <br>
analysis: <br>
<br>
Once I OC, the four corners (A, B, C, D) are in some order. If <br>
I &quot;fix&quot; A, then there are only 6 orders for B, C, D = BCD, BDC, CBD, <br>
CDB, DBC, DCB (let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m looking at them from the top). So, 1/6 <br>
of the time I get to skip PC. I also get a PE skip when the PC <br>
routines I use also do the right PE (call this proto-PLL).<br>
<br>
Sound like reasonable logic to others? I&#x27;m sure that with my old <br>
order there were step skips as well, but it feels like more. An <br>
average of two &quot; step skips&quot; in a set of 12 runs is a nice situation.<br>
<br>
And, yes, I know the next statement: Learn PLL and you&#x27;ll always <br>
have one less step (4 to 3)! I&#x27;m working on it!<br>

Odds to skip:
Orient edges: 1/8
Orient corners: 1/27
Permute corners: 1/6
Permute edges: 1/12
Total odds to skip a step: about 41%

These are the same no matter whether you orient or permute corners first.

A 3 look LL with PLL gives you about a 17.5% chance to skip a step,
usually the edge orientation. This is the usual way to turn a 4 look
into a 3 look.  It only requires 21 extra algs and improves your speed
considerably.

If you were to learn the algs to orient corners and permute edges
together, that would work great as well, but be 71 or so extra algs to
learn. Your odds to skip a step would be around 29%, though.  It would
be a nice lead in for a more advanced method, too.

No, I dont agree with that!  This is being very technical, of course.
 But, do M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2.  You may consider this to be a CP skip if
you do CP first or you can consider this to be a EP skip if you do EP
first.  But, if you do EP first, then you have 2/12 = 1/6 chance to
skip the EP and a 1/12 chance to skip CP.  It depends on how you
classify that case. :)

Well, if you have a 4-look, then you already know 7 of the PLL, so you
only really need to learn 14 more.  Of course, the J, R, N, and G
account for 10 of these if you count mirrors and inverses, so  it&#x27;s
not bad at all. :)

What? Orient corners and permute edges together?  Who does this? :P 
Are you suggesting learning 71 algs so that you had a 3-look LL? (OE
-> OCPE -> PC) ?  71 algorithms to have a 3-look is terrible for only
a 29% chance to skip a step!  If you learn 78 algorithms total, you
can have a 100% chance to skip step 3 (OLL -> PLL!)

It looks like you can get this done for $20 here:

I&#x27;ve never gotten one done so I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of them,

Hope this helps,

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jeff,

At first I did four steps in this order.
1. permute corners
2. oriente corners
3. oriente edges
4. permute edges

I&#x27;ve been combining two steps, three steps, and four steps, heading
for a one look LL. Working this way you eventually get to skip quite a
bit. 

Good luck,

          <div class="email-content">i just memorized the algorithms and the understanding of them came after using them often. im just starting to. ive known a beginner method for solving the cube for years and just got turned on to speed cubing a month ago and now im getting low 40 averages. not very impressive i know but its much better then i was. so anyway what im saying is with dedication you will see dramatic improvements but master a beginning method first. dont overwhelm yourself with a lot of algs at once.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone<br>
<br>
For anyone who cares, I have decided to cut down on color neutrality<br>
for the F2B. Instead of starting with 4 different Blocks, I will only<br>
use 2.<br>
White/Orange<br>
Yellow/Orange<br>
White/Red     Cut<br>
Yellow/Red    CUt<br>
<br>
The reason for this is to only have red corners for step 3.  When I<br>
learn full CLL/COLL, one color is easier to learn (red instead of red<br>
and orange)<br>
<br>
Step 3<br>
 I have decided to learn full COLL, and CLL.  There are cases when I<br>
can see that I want to change the edge orientations.  Such as when I<br>
have only 2 bad edges or 6 bad edges.  And then there are cases where<br>
I want to keep the edge orientations.  Such as when I have no bad<br>
edges, or if I have 3 bad on top and 1 on bottom already.<br>
<br>
Here are 2 examples<br>
<br>
F(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)2 F&#x27; or Bruno<br>
Sune RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27; or rUR&#x27;URU2r&#x27; (OLL)<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think its worth learning more than 2 algs for each case.<br>
COLL to preserve EO, or if you see something you dont like, CLL to<br>
change EO.  Even with 2 algs for each case, there aren&#x27;t that many to<br>
learn.  I have found many OLLs which are also CLLs, so I can use old algs.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello again everyone<br>
<br>
Mike, you said you averaged 6.01 for step 4 with 13 moves avg?<br>
Thats pretty much where I am.  But we&#x27;re both still doing it at 2.5<br>
moves/sec... <br>
<br>
STEP 4<br>
<br>
For cases when 1 ledge/redge is already inserted, I need to learn Ming<br>
Thai&#x27;s algorithms.  This could help me greatly.  To learn this, do you<br>
guys read the top 3 stickers?  ICI, CCC, ICC and so on..<br>
Or do you see bad edges, and know ways to flip certain bad edges?<br>
<br>
For cases when both ledge and redge are already inserted, I need to<br>
learn algs to flip 2 edges in M layer(besides (M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;d2)2).  Or a<br>
faster one to flip 4 edged in M layer(besides F&#x27;L&#x27;F (M&#x27;U)4 F&#x27;LF). <br>
Both of these are pure(preserve position).<br>
<br>
For cases when ledge and redge are in DF and DB and good, you can use<br>
1 of 3 ELLs to fix edges in upper layer.  All are common OLLs.<br>
(FR&#x27;F&#x27;R)(L&#x27;U)(RU&#x27;)M&#x27;<br>
(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)M&#x27;U(RU&#x27;r&#x27;)<br>
MU(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)M2U(RU&#x27;r&#x27;)<br>
<br>
For cases when DF and DB are good, and ledge and redge are in U layer,<br>
full ELL can solve all cases.  Even the aformentioned 3 can help.<br>
<br>
These are all of my thoughts so far on step 4.  It seems like a lot,<br>
and I didn&#x27;t even talk about the hypothetical ZBesque table for<br>
permutation of 6 oriented cubies.<br>
<br>
Jason Kovacic<br>
<br>
PS. I need help with flipping 6 edges.  There has to be a relatively<br>
short alg to flip all 6.  Position is not a factor.  Im guessing Maybe<br>
8 moves?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Although Gentoo might be the hardest distribution to install it is
really one of my favorites. Once it is installed, it is very fast (as
you compile everything from scratch) and it is actually easy to update
(using the emerge command).

For the window manager I would recommend either Fluxbox or Gnome.

Just my 2 cents,

If you&#x27;re learning Roux, I think adding the ELL and special cases like
that in can only help.  It&#x27;s 29 algs for ELL, and the ZB type table
would only have &lt;30 algs, as well.  Not too bad.

I only notice which edges are bad, and flip accordingly.  The
recognization takes only fractions of a second.

The shortest alg I can come up with for orienting all 6 edges is 11
moves, which is the same as doing it the normal Roux way.  M&#x27; U M U M&#x27;
U M&#x27; U2 M U M&#x27;.  Basically, it&#x27;s a move to flip the UF, DF, UL, and UR
edges combined with one for the UF and UB edges.  The normal way is
M&#x27;UM&#x27; U2 MUM U M&#x27;UM&#x27;.  I can do that one in about 2.3 seconds.  The
fastest other one I&#x27;ve found is 15 moves: (M&#x27;U)*4 MUM&#x27;U2MUM&#x27;.  You
should be able to do that one well under 3 seconds after a couple of
tries.  I can&#x27;t complain about 5.35 moves/second. :) The normal way is
still faster for me, but I&#x27;ve only practiced the new way for a minute.
 Time will tell.  Still, you really only get this orientation (or the
four incorrect edges on top, which solves the same way) 2/28 solves.

As far as your first alg you posted, try doing those d2&#x27;s as U2&#x27;s. 
It&#x27;s the same thing, really, but you can click U2 very quickly with an
index finger twice, or follow with your middle finger.

I definitely need to learn more of this method.

That&#x27;s a case where an optimization based on orientations with
unconstrained centers is interesting. Quite often you can reduce the
11 moves to only 5 or 6.

By the way, I did an average of twelve using only the &quot;orientation +
UL/UR + M-perm&quot; strategy --> 3.9s. No ELL, no Ming, no Thaï, only M/U.

solve a cube.  When I first learned how to solve I just blindly
learned algs and did them.  Then I started to deconstruct them, see
what they did to the other pieces on the cube, which helped me cut
down time because I could set things up to do multiple things at once.
 Once you really get into cubing you will start to see what your
algorithms do.  Most are pretty straightforward...especially in a
beginner solution.  Anyways...off to badminton practice...

No FAQ that I know of. One organizing principle for movement in the
first two layers is freedom of movement.

If you start at the Last Level, and work backward from there, you can
step through algorithms, starting from a solved cube, and watch what
each algorithm does, this can give you insight as to why and how they
work.

Yes I understood what each algorithms did before I started using it.
Memory follows comprehension, so once I figured out an algorithm it
was in my memory. Only recently have I attempted to write them down,
for some odd reason this is difficult for me and I&#x27;ve only written
down about 300 so far.

I &quot;memorize&quot; an alg by using it, that&#x27;s both muscle memory and
following it in my mind. I never just sit there and do one over and
over a hundred times. I&#x27;m trying to reorganize all my algs and when
I&#x27;m done that I might sit down and try repetition type memorization.

You might want to look for efficient ways to coordinate your hands for
each algorithm you choose to use before you practice it.

Those who need to &quot;fix&quot; windows every day don&#x27;t know how to protect 
the system. But sure, those who use Linux/Unix are lucky cause so 
far very few bother to hack/crack those systems. Im not sure if this 
is evidence that mostly Linux/Unix users are making code to attack 
windows, but the idea is not too far-fetched. According to some 
experts Linux/Unix has equally many security flaws as such. Oh well, 
the perfect OS will never exist ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Of course your mail is on a lighter note, but i would like to add that
the fact that windows is &quot;closed source&quot; is a big hindrence to the
security guys.

 Since linux is opensourced, problems can be detected by good people
well before they are started to be exploited. Whereas in the case of
windows, first a virus has to exploit the vulnerability, which will
tell us that such a bug exists and then the security experts have to
patch it up. So its always a cat-and-mouse game here in windows. Hence
i think linux is much secure overall. Ofcourse it may have millions of
bugs right now but i believe they are getting fixed each day.

&quot;Only&quot; about 300?  Out of how many?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Not to keep bringing this up, but I really am incredibly excited about<br>
what Opposite color solving has been doing for my times.  It took a<br>
while for Richard Patterson to convince me to try it, but now I don&#x27;t<br>
think I&#x27;ll ever go back to solving just one color.<br>
<br>
My old average average used to be about 17.5-17.6 seconds.  My best<br>
100 cube average with one color solving was 17.55.  Well I just did a<br>
100 cube average now that I am fairly comfortable with inspecting both<br>
colors in 15 seconds, and my new 100 cube average is 16.83 seconds!<br>
<br>
I dropped about 0.7 second from my average, and I haven&#x27;t changed any<br>
new algs, nor have I been using any ZB tricks in my Fridrich solving<br>
other than the occasional ZBF2L with all flipped edges (maybe 1/50<br>
solves).  The only major change is opposite color solving.<br>
<br>
I know that for years the view has been that solving the same color<br>
always provides enough color recognition to make your times superfast.<br>
 Well I think that is too restrictive.  By solving opposite color you<br>
always solve the same F2L edges, that is only restriction.  I mean<br>
think about it, does changing the the first layer sticker color on the<br>
corner really change that much when looking for an F2L c/e pair?  Well<br>
I say no!<br>
<br>
So anyway, I&#x27;ve gotten the feeling that some people are trying this,<br>
let me know what you think!  I&#x27;ve also gotten the feeling that people<br>
think this is a weird thing to do since it is different from the<br>
accepted belief that solving the same color is best.<br>
<br>
Well I&#x27;m trying to break that belief!  Try opposite color solving!  It<br>
is so amazing, that I will never switch back from it!  Don&#x27;t be afraid<br>
of it being different, it is so amazingly worth it!<br>
<br>
Just my views and opinions of course, but I sincerely hope everyone<br>
gives it a try for a short time to at least see what you think.<br>

My first attempts with opposite color cross were pretty bad, but I know this
is probably improved with practice. I&#x27;ll work on it for a couple days and
see what happens.

For the LL I event get better times with white than yellow on top :p

But that can be arranged pretty fast. I&#x27;ll work on that this weekend
and post some results.
(until now : I average about 23 seconds with opposite color while I
average 19 with white at the bottom :p)

          <div class="email-content">Some days ago I made a very good time using opposite color for the cross. I&#x27;m really convinced that is a good thing. Sometimes I have a square already formed on the opposite color, and a bad cross on my normal color. So, what to do? Solve with opposite color. It&#x27;s cool, and I think I can get better with practice.

For the LL I event get better times with white than yellow on top :p

But that can be arranged pretty fast. I&#x27;ll work on that this weekend
and post some results.
(until now : I average about 23 seconds with opposite color while I
average 19 with white at the bottom :p)

I&#x27;ve tried and tried, but am missing something about this method.  I
can&#x27;t make the third method with unconstrained centers work.  Any
suggestions?

It&#x27;s just matter of defining &quot;orientations&quot;.
Look at my site again, the page has been rewritten a few days ago.

For me, the question has never been wether it&#x27;s a good a bad thing to
start with either white or yellow.
The question is, why don&#x27;t all Fridrichians (who cube with such a
color scheme) use it?

Wow.  I&#x27;ve been trying to do this for months and had no luck
whatsoever.  It just clicked tonight.  Of course, it still takes me
forever to do, but I&#x27;m going to have to work on it a lot now.

I&#x27;ve noticed, though, that when I get to the point where I need to
place the UL+UR edges, the UF+UB edges are often already solved.  This
is really just one of the 4 PME cases, with a U adjustment at the end.
 I think I may try to incorporate this a little and see how it works.
 Does anyone else do this on a regular basis?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Gilles,

I guess my best response is &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot;

I think full color neutrality would really make solving the cross 
easy.  I actually used to do this in my first year of speedcubing 
and average about 5.5 moves for the cross (1 move less than 1 color 
very consistently).  I switched to one color when that was 
the &quot;cool&quot; thing to do though.

I guess I do like the benefit gained from always solving the same 
color(s) to some extent.  I think I would have a harder time finding 
an Xcross if I was searching on any color (which is a huge part of 
my personal strategy) but maybe with practice it would work?

I guess for myself I am trying to find a balance between improving 
my odds for an easy start, and having color familiarity.  For me 
opposite color solving does that, since I always solve the same F2L 
edges.

I guess for me personally I don&#x27;t want to move back to full color 
neutrality, since I think I wouldn&#x27;t use Xcross as often.  Also I do 
like having the F2L edges always looking the same.

Also, I do sometimes solve a non-white and non-yellow color if the 
cross is 2 moves or less, or the Xcross is 4 moves or so.  This is 
very rare, but I do get fast solves with it sometimes.

I guess the full color neutrality depends on the person.  I 
personally don&#x27;t want that much freedom, but more than just solving 
on color all the time.

Just my 0.02 of course,
Chris

I was proposing it in http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/23314
That&#x27;s one of the tricks that can be useful at slow speed, but I&#x27;m skeptical about using it for speed.

After trying it several times, I only got one nice solve out of many.
 I think 1 out of 8 went well that way.  The one was an 18.xx, but the
rest were over 20.

How on earth do you recognize the correct/incorrect edges with
unconstrained centers so quickly?  My fastest solve that way was still
a 30+.

I think it&#x27;s possible to anticipate the orientation pattern with<br>

I&#x27;ve now gotten a few in the 28.xx range, but they were simple cases.

Based on the number of moves you save, it looks like learning the
special optimizations for the 4 and 6 incorrect edge cases should come
first.

I suppose I should probably try to do that tomorrow, though, what with
work in 2.5 hours and all...

&gt; Hey everyone,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Not to keep bringing this up, but I really am incredibly excited about<br>
&gt; what Opposite color solving has been doing for my times.  It took a<br>
&gt; while for Richard Patterson to convince me to try it, but now I don&#x27;t<br>
&gt; think I&#x27;ll ever go back to solving just one color.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; My old average average used to be about 17.5-17.6 seconds.  My best<br>
&gt; 100 cube average with one color solving was 17.55.  Well I just did a<br>
&gt; 100 cube average now that I am fairly comfortable with inspecting both<br>
&gt; colors in 15 seconds, and my new 100 cube average is 16.83 seconds!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I dropped about 0.7 second from my average, and I haven&#x27;t changed any<br>
&gt; new algs, nor have I been using any ZB tricks in my Fridrich solving<br>
&gt; other than the occasional ZBF2L with all flipped edges (maybe 1/50<br>
&gt; solves).  The only major change is opposite color solving.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I know that for years the view has been that solving the same color<br>
&gt; always provides enough color recognition to make your times superfast.<br>
&gt;  Well I think that is too restrictive.  By solving opposite color you<br>
&gt; always solve the same F2L edges, that is only restriction.  I mean<br>
&gt; think about it, does changing the the first layer sticker color on the<br>
&gt; corner really change that much when looking for an F2L c/e pair?  Well<br>
&gt; I say no!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So anyway, I&#x27;ve gotten the feeling that some people are trying this,<br>
&gt; let me know what you think!  I&#x27;ve also gotten the feeling that people<br>
&gt; think this is a weird thing to do since it is different from the<br>
&gt; accepted belief that solving the same color is best.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Well I&#x27;m trying to break that belief!  Try opposite color solving!  It<br>
&gt; is so amazing, that I will never switch back from it!  Don&#x27;t be afraid<br>
&gt; of it being different, it is so amazingly worth it!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Just my views and opinions of course, but I sincerely hope everyone<br>
&gt; gives it a try for a short time to at least see what you think.<br>

As I said, I&#x27;m going to work on opposite last layer, but I can already
say that using white or yellow doesn&#x27;t change much.
You just have to be very fluent and look ahead very much when you solve yellow.
And with that, you can get easily sub20 times (although most of my
solves are around 22-23 now).

Good point! Also, a good way to clear out that backlog of cubes that 
Caltech Club purchased - get a cube in a signed box, all for one low 
(or medium) price.

I saw the Beauty &amp; the Geek promo last night, during &quot;Smallville&quot;,  
and there was some Geek cuber in both the group shot and in an 
action shot (action = doing the cube).

I&#x27;m sure someone will digitize the promo and or some screen shots 
and post them for all to enjoy??

          <div class="email-content">Hey, that&#x27;s better than me.  I once pulled an all-nighter &quot;just because <br>
I hadn&#x27;t done it before&quot; and ended up staying awake for about 40 <br>
consecutive hours.  I think I fell asleep for a little bit at 28 hours. <br>
  Actually, let&#x27;s see, so my flight to Orlando was at 10 PM, but I <br>
didn&#x27;t sleep on the plane and I think I woke up at 10 that day, and I <br>
ended up getting to sleep at about 1 AM EST two days later... you might <br>
be able to tell I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of math.<br>
<br>
The cubing while drunk record is very subjective.  I remember seeing a <br>
17-second record on there.  Now, whereas 17 seconds might be very slow <br>
while someone is drunk, it&#x27;s nothing comparable to a +1 minute average <br>
of a sub-20 cuber.  That, my friend, is true following of the spirit of <br>
the unofficial world records :-P.<br>
<br>
So why do we do these things?  Because we can!  And we&#x27;re awesome when <br>
we try!  15.66 second average is generally enough for most people to <br>
wet their pants to.  If you check out http://www.beermile.com/, there&#x27;s <br>
this thing called the &quot;Renaissance Mile&quot;.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&quot; and <br>
I can&#x27;t really dunk a basketball without standing on someone&#x27;s <br>
shoulders, a step ladder, or a springy trampoline, but the record for <br>
the Renaissance Mile is unclaimed.<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;re done with finals, you know what to do.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey,<br>
26.5 hours. That&#x27;s nothing. Back in 94 I stayed up for 36h+ watching this<br>
demo http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=99 and playing arcade games on my<br>
Amiga 500 with some friend and drinking beer.... (Really good demo btw for<br>
being made 1992, haven&#x27;t seen it since then)<br>
<br>
But, a couple of years ago, just before my final exam I remember I stayed up<br>
for 50h+ programming C++ for my masters thesis &quot;non-linear contact problems<br>
with the finite element method&quot;. Fortunately, I had not found my old cube so<br>
there where very small delays...<br>
<br>
Nowadays, one may think why do we spend 1000h+ cubing (hopefully with<br>
sleeping in between)? Well, for the fun of it!<br>
<br>
Ok, just had to share my experience. Btw, opposite colour solving is really<br>
good.  After just a couple of solves (20 or so) I did not worse/better than<br>
with my usual colour. Why DID&#x27;NT I do this before?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Back before I was into cubing, my record without sleep was 69.25 hours.<br>
<br>
It was achieved with one night of intense studying and homework<br>
completing, one of support for a friend doing the same (and boredom<br>
because I&#x27;d finished all of my finals) and stayed up late the third<br>
evening to see the premier of Return of the King with about 150<br>
classmates.<br>
<br>
I fell asleep on the bus home hard enough that they pelted me with<br>
playing cards until I started bleeding, all without waking up.  It was<br>
an interesting finals week.<br>
<br>
I was up a little over 24 hours a few days ago, but my averages stink<br>
without sleep.  I get good spike times, though.  And I&#x27;m better at<br>
x-cross and opposite color solving.  My personal best average that way<br>
is a marvelous 20.01.  That&#x27;s about where I average anyhow.<br>

Solve it like a 3x3x3, it&#x27;s not rocket science :) The only trouble you
should have (if any) is the last layer.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone,<br>
<br>
<br>
For Opposite color cross solving, It is just as easy to do OLL and PLL<br>
on either side.  But for COLL, Isn&#x27;t it hard to recognize cases from<br>
the opposite side?<br>
<br>
FOr F2B, I use opposite color solving, doubling my chances for a good<br>
3x2x1.  When I get to step 3, and have to do the corners, I just do<br>
OLL(7)and a PLL(2).  Usually about 5 sec.  <br>
<br>
With opposite color solving This step is Easy, just like OLL and PLL<br>
is easy for either Yellow or White.  But CLL is hard to recognize from<br>
either side. So I think I&#x27;m going to start using only 1 color.<br>
<br>
Is opposite color solving good for CLL COLL systems?<br>

practice you do get used to seeing the CLL/COLL case on your opposite
color.

Again, everything about switching to also using your opposite color
feels quite strange at first, but if you stick with it, you&#x27;ll find
that it really isn&#x27;t all that different from solving your regular
color.  This may be a different case with the Roux method though,
since you also have to take the centers into account and those would
change orders too.

As far as just CLL and COLL go though I can definitely say that over
time you do get used to it, but it takes some adjusting.

Hope this helps.  Don&#x27;t give up on opposite color just yet!  Try it
for a bit and see if the CLL gets better.  Again I don&#x27;t know if
having to also worry about the changing of the centers orders makes it
even harder for Roux method, but so far all the initial difficulties
I&#x27;ve had from solving my opposite color I&#x27;ve now gotten over.

Oh my, that is just so funny, I will never get tired of watching that. 
Seeing you do that was definitely one of my highlights of WC2005.  It 
actually looks like there is something wrong and we should be rushing 
to your side to help you.  It would have been funnier to just show 
people that clip and not tell them what you were doing.

Would it really be more efficient?  How?

I do whatever presents itself first, but I have a vague plan I usually
follow.  The method is incredibly flexible.  Usually, I start out with
a single c/e pair, and build from there.  Inserting edges into a 1x2x3
is easy, and often very quick, because you can see the CLL case and
recognize it while completing the last edge.  Getting a c/e pair with
the edge going in the DL or DR spots is fine, too, because inserting
the other edge to make a 2x2x1 is quick.

Generally, though, my solves follow the pattern (although I rotate the
cube a lot, so the position of the 1x2x3&#x27;s can be anywhere in the
F2L): DL edge, c/e pair, c/e pair, DR edge, c/e pair, c/e pair.  There
is still a lot of variation, though.  Often, to start, you get c/e
pairs for opposite blocks you can solve easily, and just fill in the
rest. There are also times when you get to solve the DL and DR edges
easily, and you&#x27;re left with c/e pairs only, like F2L.

I average about 50-52 moves total for the method. (STM)

I agree.  If you practice enough with it, you really don&#x27;t have a
single cross color.  You have two to choose from.  I find that my
usual cross color (white) actually makes my LL go easier, because the
pieces are easier to see.  Maybe I need two white sides... :P

Not really.  If you orient centers prior to Step 4, you&#x27;re left with
the same recognition for either color.  The only thing that changes is
the single sticker on the UR and UL edges to its opposite color.  If
you don&#x27;t orient centers first, it&#x27;s the same thing, now that I think
about it.  The only two things that change are the U color on the UL
and UR edges.

If you&#x27;re going to do corners in two steps, you should permute, then
orient, especially if you&#x27;d like to learn Gilles&#x27; recognization method
for CLL.  You just see which two corners need to switch 5/6 of the
time, and the orientation.  If you&#x27;re using a standard color scheme,
which I believe you are, you should get similar colors as opposites. 
Do you use Red and Orange for your LL color now?  I don&#x27;t see why
learning to do two colors is really any harder than getting good at
one.  The colors are similar, and if you can recognize the
permutation, you shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble.  Like I mentioned above,
I actually get better LL&#x27;s with my usual D color as U, because white
is brighter.  If you practice it enough (more than an hour or two,
really) you&#x27;ll notice how easy it starts to be.  Just keep at it.  You
won&#x27;t regret it.

<br>
Yesterday when I was watching the drawing for the Football World Cup<br>
in Germany, I was turning my cube and something came up in my mind :<br>
What about using a cage method for the 3x3 ?<br>
<br>
Some times when you solve the cross, you really have a bad time<br>
(though it&#x27;s usually not so hard :p) but what if the cross was already<br>
solved, but not with the good center ? (or something close to that)<br>
<br>
Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to do F2L and then LL without the right centers<br>
and then fix the centers afterwards ?<br>
<br>
The thing is I don&#x27;t see many advantages with that, but maybe you&#x27;ll<br>
see more than I do :-)<br>
<br>
What do you think ?<br>

It really depends on how efficiently you build 1x2x3 blocks, and how
lucky your starts are.  If you build well, you should average well
under what you would for typical F2L.  If you don&#x27;t build so well, or
you get bad cases, you&#x27;ll average the same as you would for F2L.  I&#x27;d
peg it around 22-28 moves, depending.  Of course, you could use more
than that, if you use a lot of two generators, which are very fast. 
So it&#x27;s hard to say, really.

As for the edges, you should average under 6 moves, if you&#x27;re not
using any optimizations or unconstrained centers.  Just the basics
will get you that.  It becomes less if you start to incorporate
special cases.

If anyone is feeling brave enough with ACube, would someone work out
the algs, number of cases, and average number of moves to finish off
the last 6 edges simultaneously once they&#x27;re oriented correctly?  I&#x27;d
do it myself if I could get ACube to work on my computer.

Same here, although I&#x27;m quite poor, so you&#x27;d probibly do better
selling it to pedro :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Gilles,

Interesting idea.  I had never really thought to try that to be honest.

Sometimes I do start with centers moves right after I pick up the cube
though.  Say I have two c/e pairs that connect correctly to the same
corner, so sort of like a 2x2x1 block but the center is not the right
one.  If the center is in a bad spot, and I can&#x27;t really use face
turns effciently then I sometimes permute the center into the 2x2x1
block and finish from there.

I do remember once, maybe twice, I actually have had a solved cross bu
on the wrong face, and I permuted the center into that face and a
super fast cross.  That was very lucky to get that though.

I think your idea will allow for always solving an easier cross (since
you can choose to solve it almost anywhere.  I say almost since half
of the positions you could solve a cross into will give you a parity
error.

If you turn any middle layer on a cube where centers are indistinct
then you perform an odd cycle on the edges but leave corners alone. 
Choosing to solve the cross on other faces will make this edge parity
possible, so you would have to watch out for that.

The F2L is a bit confusing, but you could get used to looking at the
side color of the cross edge rather than the center to know where
stuff goes, so that is not a big deal.

I think the only real hump in such an approach is learning your color
scheme well enough to always solve your cross sch as to avoid the
parity error, but I think that would not take much work.

I actually want to look into this, since for a solve where a cross is
mostly or completely built on the wrong face, this could be fast.

I&#x27;ll definitely try it and see what I think ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve started something new, though it is exciting 
to see new ideas explored in the community.  To be honest, when I 
solved with one color sometimes I would get crosses that would 
destroy my times.  A few times I would just happen to see the 
opposite side and think &quot;it&#x27;s too bad I don&#x27;t solve for that color!&quot;  
After some thought I realized this restriction had to go.  

At first I only solved for opposite color if it was extremely obvious 
the cross was better (i.e. 6+ turn cross on normal color, 3-4 turns 
or simple xCross for opp. color)  After a lot of work I&#x27;m sure the 
mental barriers for opposite color will fall, and &quot;opposite&quot; will be 
a relative term.  How&#x27;s dual solving sound? :P  

Seriously though, this approach makes too much sense.  The only 
reason I can see people not doing it is because solving for one color 
has been stressed so much.  Open your minds cubers :)

Soon I will sell Chris on partial cross solving and you&#x27;ll hear all 
about that :P

          <div class="email-content">Yes I practiced it a bit, and you can definitely get used to do the
F2L without looking at the color of the center + the color scheme is
not that hard to use (maybe if you try opposite color and cage method,
it will be a bit hard at the beginning, but it&#x27;s definitely possible).


Btw I could do a sub 20 average using opposite color wisely (I must
have used it about 4 times in that 19.5x average)

So I&#x27;ll work a bit more on opposite color to get completely used to
it, but it&#x27;s definitely not hard to switch from white to yellow.

I&#x27;m going to look for some sort of parity fiw that swaps 2 edges + some centers.

This might be an interesting extension too :-)

The best thing to do if you don&#x27;t want to buy all of them (btw there
is also a mefferts 5x5 ) is to try someone&#x27;s cubes and see for
yourself.

          <div class="email-content">Hello again :-)<br>
<br>
I was playing around with my cube at the cinema earlier today (instead<br>
of watching the commercials) and I found an interesting 3 edges cycle.<br>
<br>
Here is the algorithm :<br>
11stm, 13 ftm, 14 qtm<br>
r U M U R&#x27; U&#x27; M&#x27; U R U2 r&#x27;<br>
<br>
and this is how I perform it : r U r&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; M&#x27; U R U2 r&#x27;<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll add a video of it to my website probably tomorrow (www.belgiancubes.tk)<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know yet if I&#x27;m going to use it, but some of you who like<br>
double layer turns + M&#x27; moves (you can also do it using the double<br>
layer technique = r U r&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; r R&#x27; U R U2 r&#x27; ) might like it.<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bob,

I had a great time today. I got to see many of my fellow cubers in the 
area. I was surprised at how important the magic was to everyone!! It 
seemed every competetor knew how to solve it. 

The competition was still fun even though I had a lot to do. It seemed 
I was the all important puzzle repair man! I fixed 2 magics completely, 
6-7 broken strings and 5 2x2&#x27;s. I&#x27;m considering making a name tag for 
the next competition. :-P On that note, if you need your puzzle 
repaired at a competition, look for me. I can do 2x2 rubiks, 3x3 (duh), 
4x4 rubiks, 5x5 rubiks, and any form of magic (regular magic, master 
magic, etc.). 

Thanks Bob for hosting this great competition! I hope you have another 
one soon. 

Peter Greenwood

          <div class="email-content">Hello all,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been playing around with the Roux method a lot lately, and I&#x27;ve<br>
decided it needs as much attention and perfecting as Fridrich and<br>
company are getting. :)<br>
<br>
To that end, I&#x27;ve been trying to find ways to speed the Last 6 edges<br>
(and 4 centers) up, and thinking a lot about several variations of the<br>
normal method.<br>
<br>
First, there&#x27;s unconstrained centers.  This can shorten some of the<br>
hardest orientation situations from 12 moves down to 5 or 6, but the<br>
recognition seems akin to ZB to me.  I need more practice with this,<br>
definitely, but I think that it may take too much time, even with<br>
mastery. (sorry, Gilles)  The whole Step 4 method takes something like<br>
18 moves on average, if my math is anywhere near correct.<br>
<br>
Instead of orienting and permuting L6E, what if we were to finish off<br>
DF and DB edges, then complete the cube with ELL?  The hardest<br>
situations for finishing the two edges should be around 7 moves, with<br>
the average being somewhere around 6.  ELL averages about 12 moves, so<br>
that puts the method in similar standing to the normal way.<br>
<br>
But what if we only finish off the DB edge?  It can only be in 6<br>
places, each place having 2 possible orientations.  Thus, 12 simple<br>
cases, 11 of which are 5 moves or fewer. The average move count should<br>
be about 3.5, with the hardest situations at 7.  You don&#x27;t need to<br>
orient centers prior to this step, either.  And recognition is very<br>
simple.  The hardest case to spot is when the piece is already<br>
correct. :)  After this, we could use any of the 22 possible cases<br>
found here: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/NewAlgSet.html<br>
<br>
This would give us an average of under 7 moves to place the DF edge<br>
and orient the LL edges, leaving us with an edge PLL step, as in COLL.<br>
 As edge PLL&#x27;s average 7 moves, our previous step averages 6.5 or so,<br>
and our first step at 3.5, this gives us around 17 again.  The<br>
benefits?  Aside from the 1/12 chance for a PLL skip, and the<br>
extremely easy to recognize and execute EPLL step, you never need to<br>
change your grip, and after the DF and DB edges are placed, you never<br>
need to adjust the M slice.<br>
<br>
Also, there are a number of lucky cases to exploit.  There are only 29<br>
or so unique cases for when the edges come up correctly oriented after<br>
placing DB.  There are some very fast cases for when edges are<br>
correctly placed but incorrectly oriented, and learning the ELL algs<br>
can help out nicely for the 1/10 of cases where the DF edge completes<br>
itself along with DB.  The worst case scenario is 26 moves to finish,<br>
and comes up roughly 1/2880 cases, while the odds for a 4 move or<br>
fewer solution are 1/72.<br>
<br>
When someone gets an OLL or PLL skip with Fridrich, the solve is<br>
usually in the low 40&#x27;s for the number of moves.  A PLL skip with COLL<br>
will probably be between 40 and 45. A very nice ZB solve may be in the<br>
mid to high 30&#x27;s.  With good 1x2x3&#x27;s and a nice CLL case (like<br>
FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27; or B&#x27; R&#x27;FR B R&#x27;F&#x27;R), a sub or low 30&#x27;s move solve is a good<br>
possibility.  Something like 1/312 solves (more once I learn more<br>
CLL&#x27;s instead of slow COLL&#x27;s :P)<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in hearing more about this, or helping me to<br>
further this approach, please let me know.  I could definitely use the<br>
services of someone who is good with ACube.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going through my head right now.  Gilles, Jason,<br>
and others, what do you think?<br>

I&#x27;m rather looking for something that transforms an impossible

But it might be a rather long algorithm. (ACube found something in 22
moves, not good for a fridrich solve lol)

I think that actually the Rubiks.com 5x5x5&#x27;s are the best ones. Thy 
are more stable than the others. But of course the initial stiffness 
is a big setback. I hope that my correspondence with Seventowns will 
be fruitful. I have suggested some changes to the design. The reason 
many prefer mefferts or the old 80&#x27;s wahn is cause they use screws 
and not rivets. I&#x27;d really love to see Seventowns switch to good 
machine screws so one can remove the tightness and also adjust the 
tension to ones liking easily. And also do those changes to the 
outer edges. Like i have seen on Grant Tregay&#x27;s cube it makes the 
cube turn a whole lot nicer, probably eliminating many of the 
problems with twisting corner-centers and popping edge-centers and 
so on.

Cause right now most ppl&#x27;s worry w larger cubes is to get a good 
5x5x5. A good 5x5x5 easily saves u 30 secs or more on a solve. I 
know this from experience. I could never get sub 3:00 consistently 
on my old Wahn even after balancing the tension. The molding of the 
pieces was not really good. Well, the kind of 5x5x5 really also 
depends a lot on cubing style. Im very dependent on a high turn-rate 
w my cage method. I gain solving time by faster recognition even if 
my solution is a bit longer than the pairing-up approach.

Cheers!

I wrote that some of them only are interesting. Case 3a for example, it would stupid to start a 7 moves orientation sequence (including two U2). M&#x27; is enough. And the case is rather easy to recognize, with UL and UR on top.
If an &quot;optimization&quot; makes you loose time, just don&#x27;t use it.

As I said, sub-4 is possible without these optimizations.
Look at this random solve: http://grrroux.free.fr/capcubeM2.avi
Orientation: M&#x27;UM&#x27;UMUM&#x27;
Insertion: U&#x27;M2U&#x27;
Permutation: M&#x27;U2M&#x27;2U2M&#x27;
A rather long finish, but it took only about 3s and my slices are not as fast as Bob&#x27;s.

I think that EPLL as the last step is not a very good idea, permuting M-edges is much faster.
The standard corners-first approach that begins with solving UL or UR (instead of DB), before solving the other and orienting M-edges looks like a better idea to me.
If the first piece (UL/UR) is a bit difficult to solve, just put it oriented in U (don&#x27;t care wether it&#x27;s inserted between the right corners or not), apply the standard CF orientation sequence without the last 2 moves, and you end up in the middle of step 4b.
For this technique, you should need less than 15 moves on average too.

ACube is very nice and useful, but it&#x27;s not the right tool when centers are moving parts.



Thanks for contributing!

          <div class="email-content">I think it&#x27;s a great substitute. Put on a couple layers of nail polish
and then cover that with another couple layers of Hard as Nails or
some other clear coat. I think it was Grant that recommnended this. I
did it to my megaminx a while ago and got compliments about its glazed
look at Rutgers. It also holds up very well and looks the same as the
day it was painted. Another thing that I like (but many people don&#x27;t)
is that you can paint right to the edge of and even over the cubie a
little so you can&#x27;t even see the black plastic.

I think that actually the Rubiks.com 5x5x5&#x27;s are the best ones. Thy 
are more stable than the others. But of course the initial stiffness 
is a big setback. I hope that my correspondence with Seventowns will 
be fruitful. I have suggested some changes to the design. The reason 
many prefer mefferts or the old 80&#x27;s wahn is cause they use screws 
and not rivets. I&#x27;d really love to see Seventowns switch to good 
machine screws so one can remove the tightness and also adjust the 
tension to ones liking easily. And also do those changes to the 
outer edges. Like i have seen on Grant Tregay&#x27;s cube it makes the 
cube turn a whole lot nicer, probably eliminating many of the 
problems with twisting corner-centers and popping edge-centers and 
so on.

Cause right now most ppl&#x27;s worry w larger cubes is to get a good 
5x5x5. A good 5x5x5 easily saves u 30 secs or more on a solve. I 
know this from experience. I could never get sub 3:00 consistently 
on my old Wahn even after balancing the tension. The molding of the 
pieces was not really good. Well, the kind of 5x5x5 really also 
depends a lot on cubing style. Im very dependent on a high turn-rate 
w my cage method. I gain solving time by faster recognition even if 
my solution is a bit longer than the pairing-up approach.

Cheers!

Hi Bob

I recommend making z first and then R [(U R&#x27; D) (R2 U&#x27; R D&#x27;)]2 or R&#x27;
[(U&#x27; R D&#x27;) (R2 U R&#x27; D)]2 for the other case. I find these rather fast.

This is a long way around, but it is a way to see what that parity is
about. I use lower case letters to mean slices only.
F B d&#x27; F&#x27; B&#x27; U r U r&#x27; U2 r&#x27; U2 r2 U&#x27; r&#x27; U2 r U&#x27; r&#x27; U2 (Which leaves an
interesting pattern)
r2 D&#x27; f2 D f&#x27; r2 f

You should now have four middle centers shifted to the left one half
turn and two edges on the LL, RU and LU swapped.

My mistake.  So far I&#x27;m averaging 18-20, but I&#x27;m not very efficient
yet at mixing steps, and I can&#x27;t use any of the special cases or the
unconstrained centers. Not fast enough for speedsolving, anyway. :)

This is only my preliminary number, using the actual case counts and
blindly applying the algs.  I&#x27;m sure this can be less if we can find
optimizations for it like you did for Step 4.

I need some assistance finding nice optimizations as you did for Step
4.  How did you come up with those?  Perhaps a similar process would
work well here.

I know placing the last 5 edges once oriented should work out to 10 or
fewer moves, and the ELL cases work out to around 12 on average,
giving those cases fewer than 17 moves on average.  But I&#x27;m certain
there is a way to reduce the moves for the general cases.

One good way is to try to orient edges when inserting the DB piece. 
Scramble with M U M&#x27; U2.  To insert this with M U M&#x27;, you leave two
incorrect edges for the next step, which is not as nice to fix. 
Inserting it with the inverse of the scramble now costs you one move,
but gives you a nice 3 move insertion for the second step, or possibly
a finish for the final 5 simultaneously.

permuting M-edges is much faster.

I&#x27;m working on it. ;)

I know it&#x27;s not very good for this, but it&#x27;s better than me slowly
attempting to find things by hand.  If anyone still wants to help me
out with this on ACube, I&#x27;m very interested.

Hi Stefan, Bob, teemu_tiinanen,

Where QF means turning the whole cube the same way as F, try
QF (F R&#x27; B R2 F&#x27; R B&#x27;) 2 
and
QF (B&#x27; R D&#x27; R2 B R&#x27; F) 2 

Cheers,

Those are they same algorithms as the ones I suggested but from a
different position, and you use F and B instead of U and D, which is
much more slower in my opinion.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jason,<br>
<br>
What you normally do is:<br>
1) take 2 or 3 cubes<br>
2) have someone scramble them before you start<br>
3) start the time and start solving<br>
4) while solving cubes, the scrambler scrambles the solved cubes<br>
5) stop the time when 42 are solved.<br>
<br>
We normally do not use official scrambles for these unofficial records.<br>
42 is the number of kilometers for a marathon.<br>
<br>
The current unofficial record is held by Lars Vandenbergh:<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmm.. From that angle, the video looks like you are doing some

Eh.. The 1.42 is just my record for my favourite U permutation from 
my favourite angle, which is cycling UR -> UB -> UL -> UR. I can do 
it on the stackmat sub 2 very consistenty, but I am sure a lot of 
sub20 cubers can do this too.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Thank you,
That&#x27;s I asked ACube to do but your solution is better.
However it&#x27;s still very very long and you can&#x27;t resonably finish with
such an algorithm on the 3x3x3.
Another possibility is to fix the centers at the beginning.
But then it just goes back to a normal Fridrich Solve.

So I guess I won&#x27;t look much more into that possibility, maybe I&#x27;ll
from time to time do the cross on one side and fix the center but it
needs to be a very lucky case then.

Thanks :-)
Gilles.

Actually those are the same as the two I posted to Stefan a couple of
months ago (R U&#x27; L U2 R&#x27; U L&#x27;)*2 and it&#x27;s mirror. Yours are good, but
people have different styles. The main difference there between using
F and B instead of  U and D is the angle of the left wrist and with F
and B you can see what happening.

Ah, yes I get it now, those are very nice indeed. I remember when I
learnt that original (R U&#x27; L U2 R&#x27; U L&#x27;)*2 and it&#x27;s mirror and I
didn&#x27;t really like those algorithms. Then I found the version with U
and D from Twistypuzzles&#x27; forum, and it was definitely faster for me.
Your algorithms looks very promising, so maybe I have to update my
algorithm repertoire ;)

I posted a while back about the 2gen edge 3 cycles I used, but I

The important thing is to find algs which suit your hands. If the
version you first posted suits you better then stick with it. 

Generally speaking, if someone has a slow alg the solution might be to
 turn that alg on its ear.

You could always use cases when the cross is already solved on the
opposite side, and finish the solve with M&#x27;E2ME2.  If there are any
nice blocks or pairs, this may work better than F2R2B2L2.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone<br>
<br>
I wanted to know what I averaged on move count for step 4.  Gille&#x27;s<br>
site says 15 is about right.  Mike- you said you averaged 18-20?  is<br>
that right?  I took an avg of 100 and here it is.  I solved slow<br>
enough to count my moves on all solves (1.5-2 moves/sec).<br>
<br>
[13, 13, 12, 15, 12, (6), 20, 12, 13, 15, 11, 10, 16, 16, 14, 15, 14,<br>
12, 13, 12 14, 15,12, 18, 14, 8, 14, 12, 13, 12, 10, 11, 11, 18, 13,<br>
17, 16, 8, 14,  15, 19, 14, 18,  7, 13, 17, 16, 15, 14, 11, 12, 12,<br>
13, (26), 18, 7, 16, 9, 9, 12, 10, 10, 15, 12, 16, 18, 10, 15, 11, 13,<br>
11, 14, 8, 15, (6), 10, (19), 14, 15, (4), 8, 7, 10, (22), 13, 13, 5,<br>
18, 17, 13, 15, 16, 17, 10, 17, 12, 17, 13, 8, 16]<br>
AVG 13.2 moves per solve<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t know how many to omit so I just counted all 100 solves.  I<br>
bracketed the highest 3 and lowest 3 solves. High 3 were all 6 bad<br>
edges.  Low 3 were lucky, OLL skip, PLL skip.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 Interesting Solves in a Row: [(26), 18, 7, 16, 9]<br>
(26) was 6 bad edges, messed up orientation, had to orient  twice. =(<br>
<br>
On the 18, DB edge was done after orientation, so I decided to finish<br>
F2L (Mike) and ended up with a Zperm.  <br>
<br>
On the 7, I oriented and inserted ledge and redge simultaneously, then<br>
a 3 Move PLL.  Lucky.<br>
<br>
16 standard solve. 2 bad edges<br>
<br>
On the 9 the ledge was already inserted, so I used the Ming Thai Alg<br>
for CCC.  Or you could say I changed the defenition of orientation,<br>
did an M&#x27;, and  everything was oriented correctly.  Scramble F2M&#x27;F2 U<br>
MU2MUM.<br>

Avg 6.23<br>
<br>
I figured that 100 cubes is a pretty good warm up. It was Very<br>
disappointing. I expected better times.  I will say that I was very<br>
consistent though, especially on the first avg.  2nd avg had six sub 6<br>
solves, and then a 6.00 and a 6.06.  Pretty good I guess.  <br>
<br>
I usually see an Orientation pattern, ACT, and then take a second<br>
look, and permute all pieces. This time, I solved slower, and payed<br>
attention to where the ledge and redge were going.  You can then mesh<br>
 the Orientation and Permutation steps into 1.  I always look for the<br>
quickest way to pair up the ledge and redge while orienting. <br>
Sometimes that means inserting the ledge into the redge&#x27;s place<br>
temporarily.  Or not inserting a ledge during orientation, to give<br>
yourself a better case.  <br>
<br>
It&#x27;s all about looking ahead I think, just like F2L.  You can be much<br>
more efficient by going slower.<br>

PS If I timed this with the cube already in hand, I think my times<br>
would drop a lot.   I may start doing this, but it just feels weird. <br>

Apparently not.  That&#x27;s what I thought it was, but I took some
averages just now.  5 sets of 12, but I didn&#x27;t know how many to get
rid of, either.

19 13 18 17 14 16 9  15 14 17 14 16 = 15.17
13 17 10 16 17 17 18 15 16 16 18 16 = 15.75
15 17 16 12 13 16 13 10 14 12 11 17 = 13.83
16 15 14 13 12 14 14 19 12 18 18 15 = 15.00
11 16 4  18 16 19 16 14 14 20 17 17 = 15.17
= 14.98 overall

Out of curiosity, I decided to take some using what little I currently
know of the strategy I proposed last night.  I was somewhat surprised,
considering how few ELL algs and F2l+orienting algs I know.  Still, I
did pretty well, and this only strengthens my suspicions that this is
a viable method.

21 14 18 19 13 16 19 18 16 14 15 23 = 17.17
22 18 19 17 13 13*20 19 17 17 12 18 = 17.08
17 14 19 19 21 19 12 20 14 18 17 17 = 15.67
15 18 16 15 14 12 24 17 21 17 20 9  = 16.50
14 20 14 12 11 15 16 12 17 18 18 19 = 15.50
=16.7 overall

Most of the solves were done DB edge, DF edge, orient U edges, place U
edges.  A few that I knew how were done DB edge, DF edge+orient U
edges, place U edges.  A few more were done with ELL after the DF
edge, and some of them I did the DF and DB edges simultaneously.

The 23 and 24 were both long edge orientations and Z perms.  The 13*
should have been 9, but I inserted DF and then pulled it right back
out for the beginning of an easy ELL alg.  I should have seen that
coming.  The 9 was an easy orientation with DB finished and left me
with two pairs of edges to swap (R2F2R2F2R2F2).

I did an average of 50 earlier 23.16 with a best average of 21.64. 
Considering that&#x27;s only a little better than I generally do with
standard Roux, and I&#x27;ve worked on that a lot lately and several months
ago, I can&#x27;t really complain for a first try.  I&#x27;m very excited to see
what times I&#x27;m capable of once I learn some more of the insertion and
ELL algs.

I&#x27;m still waiting for ACube volunteers, though. :)

I found a picture online where I could see all the pieces, and I was kinda
bored, so I wrote a program and found all 48 solutions.  now I just need to
be able to take pictures and send them in

  Umm ....

I think that actually the Rubiks.com 5x5x5&#x27;s are the best ones. Thy 
are more stable than the others. But of course the initial stiffness 
is a big setback. I hope that my correspondence with Seventowns will 
be fruitful. I have suggested some changes to the design. The reason 
many prefer mefferts or the old 80&#x27;s wahn is cause they use screws 
and not rivets. I&#x27;d really love to see Seventowns switch to good 
machine screws so one can remove the tightness and also adjust the 
tension to ones liking easily. And also do those changes to the 
outer edges. Like i have seen on Grant Tregay&#x27;s cube it makes the 
cube turn a whole lot nicer, probably eliminating many of the 
problems with twisting corner-centers and popping edge-centers and 
so on.

Cause right now most ppl&#x27;s worry w larger cubes is to get a good 
5x5x5. A good 5x5x5 easily saves u 30 secs or more on a solve. I 
know this from experience. I could never get sub 3:00 consistently 
on my old Wahn even after balancing the tension. The molding of the 
pieces was not really good. Well, the kind of 5x5x5 really also 
depends a lot on cubing style. Im very dependent on a high turn-rate 
w my cage method. I gain solving time by faster recognition even if 
my solution is a bit longer than the pairing-up approach.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Cracker Barrel is selling more of the &quot;Magic Cube&quot; 3x3x3, this time <br>
with green, red and white colored plastic. Maybe they have other <br>
colors, too, but that&#x27;s all this store had. They cost $4.99. The <br>
mechansim and stickers are junk, but they look neat. <br>
<br>
The mechanism actually looks like it could be adapted to screws and <br>
springs. The centers have arches and there is a standard burr for the <br>
kernel. However they rotate about on plastic rivets. If you remove the <br>
rivets you might be able to retrofit with a proper mech.<br>

          <div class="email-content">you cannot find 5x rubik studio, just 4x.<br>
<br>
but I suspect that 4x studio is the same as 4x rubiks.com<br>
<br>
now I have 5x rubiks.com 4x rubik studio, 4x mefferts, 5x mefferts. <br>
<br>
in general, mefferts are a lot easier to operate. Specially I found that 5x rubiks is hard to rotate the outer layers. in the other hand, mefferts works 100% from the first minute if lubed. With rubiks, you must wait until internal pieced are &#x27;self-sanded&#x27; with the use.<br>
<br>
I have never timed myself with mefferts cubes so I cannot give you any point about that.<br>
<br>
I like more the size of the rubik cubes than meffert&#x27;s...<br>
<br>
hope this helps!<br>

Ha ha!

Well, I guess it /might/ have been intentional (there are other naughty 
puns in Swift), but the verb is apparently not known in print before 
1857.  The related noun first appeared in 1766, which is also too 
late... but perhaps the word was current before then.

Let&#x27;s not get started on those terrible lies about Captain Pugwash.

I was really great to do a time like that. I can tell you that it 
was a little lucky. I got a U turn as the third and last step of my 
method but the time would probably have been around 5 seconds 
without luck, because I did the first to steps in like 2.5-3 seconds 
and then became a little confused when it almost was solved.

I&#x27;m most happy with the european record for one-handed solving which 
was not a lucky case, just a very fast F2L. I&#x27;m also very satisfied 
that I managed to take back the swedish record for 3*3*3 single from 
Lars Petrus.

I&#x27;ve taught most of my crew team how to solve, too. :P  I think the
fastest 2k on our team for a cuber is in the 6:20s.  I&#x27;m one of the
slowest, with a 6:56 (last year).

          <div class="email-content">Ok.  I&#x27;ve done some more experimenting, and I&#x27;ve come up with a few<br>
new ideas.  Because Gilles&#x27; method uses opposite color solving for the<br>
F2B, and because we&#x27;ve heard so much from Chris Hardwick lately about<br>
opposite color (and it works), I decided to try to apply this to my<br>
new Step 4 idea.  For the last step, you can start by either inserting<br>
the DB pair, or use the DB pair for the opposite color, and finish<br>
your solve with an M2.<br>
<br>
I tried this a lot tonight, and it went much better than I was afraid<br>
of.  The only thing I really had problems with was recognizing which<br>
pieces to permute with certain ELL cases, but since I only know a few<br>
ELL cases anyway, I think I&#x27;ll chalk it up to that. :)  My best time<br>
using this was a 16.42.  Not lucky, in that I inserted one edge easier<br>
using my opposite color, inserted the second, and finished with an ELL<br>
case.  All three substeps totalled about 14 moves, which is a little<br>
better than average for that scenario.<br>
<br>
There are really 4 separate scenarios for solves this way.  The first<br>
is when all the edges are oriented after inserting DB.  Ideally, I<br>
would like to learn the 16 or so cases to finish off the edges. <br>
They&#x27;re all relatively short and easy to accomplish using only MU<br>
moves.  They average under 7 moves per alg. All but 4 or so are very<br>
easy to recognize, and the final 4 I have some ideas for. This should<br>
come up nearly 15% of cases, if you can start with any of the 4 M<br>
edges for DB.  This is by far the nicest option, because of how short<br>
and quick the algs are, but also the least frequent. Placing the DB<br>
edge intelligently, though, we can get this more often.<br>
<br>
The second special scenario is when the DF edge places itself, or is<br>
very simple to place after the DB edge.  This leaves you with an ELL<br>
case to finish.  I believe the ELL&#x27;s average around 12 moves to<br>
finish.  Again, also this step uses only MU moves, and is incredibly<br>
quick.  Using the few ELL&#x27;s I know, I managed a 15.02 and a 15.92,<br>
neither of which were lucky at all.  Both were 3 short substeps. <br>
Considering my best non lucky is a 14.33 with a ZB case I know, I&#x27;d<br>
say a 15.02 on my second day isn&#x27;t too bad. :)  That&#x27;s actually .65<br>
seconds faster than my fastest normal Roux time ever.<br>
<br>
The third special case group is much less frequent than the first two,<br>
and comprises all of the miscellaneous cases I&#x27;ve found that are<br>
easier and faster than the other ways.  Good examples are (M&#x27;U)*4 and<br>
various others built from that.  Speaking of which, Jason, what do you<br>
think of U&#x27; (L U&#x27; l&#x27;) U (M&#x27;U)*3 (L U L&#x27;) U?  Others that fall into<br>
this category are M2U2M2U2, ME2M&#x27;E2, etc.  This group will hopefully<br>
be much more full once I figure out some nicer optimizations.  Gilles,<br>
I&#x27;d really like to know how you found your special cases for step 4. <br>
I think I may be able to adapt some of them to this.  There are<br>
certainly some unpleasant cases that come up, and I&#x27;d like to see if I<br>
can shorten them at all.<br>
<br>
The last group is the normal group of solves.  In these, you place DB,<br>
then place DF and orient the remaining 5 edges, then finish the LL<br>
edges.  This is where the most difficult cases are, and also some of<br>
the nicest.  The first substep is placing the DB edge, and averages<br>
3.5 moves, but if you start with any of the 4 possible DB edges, this<br>
drops to under 3.  Sometimes it works well to perform a d2 after this<br>
step, if you actually have to place the edge to DF.  Next, inserting<br>
the DF edge while orienting edges averages 6.5 moves, but I have some<br>
ideas about how to shorten that.  When placing the DB edge, it&#x27;s often<br>
possible to either influence the orientation to your liking, either by<br>
preserving a good one, or swapping a bad one.  50% of the time, this<br>
only requires adjusting the U face to insert from the opposite side. <br>
The cases I&#x27;m having trouble finding good ways to fix are when the DB<br>
edge is properly oriented prior to insertion.  The only good ways to<br>
insert it also preserve orientation of the other 5 edges.  This is<br>
something I need to work on.  Finally, you need only permute the LL<br>
edges, averaging ~6.75 moves.<br>
<br>
A possible route to take involves always achieving an easy orientation<br>
with the DB edge, so that you can orient the remaining 5 and permute<br>
them all at once.  There are really only 6 possible orientations after<br>
the DB edge is placed. 1 is correctly oriented, another is 3 edges on<br>
top (the &#x27;magical&#x27; orientation from Gilles&#x27; method).  The first takes<br>
zero moves, obviously, and the second takes 3 (or 4, if you need to<br>
AUF).  Incorrect adjacent edges takes at least 7 moves to orient,<br>
incorrect opposite edges takes a minimum of 9. All 4 U edges incorrect<br>
is an unfriendly case requiring at least 12, but for all of these<br>
groups, the ELL&#x27;s are about as good as it gets.  The cases that are<br>
tricky are the ones with DF and UF incorrect.  These cases can be<br>
changed to correct orientation in 7 moves, or inserted with correct<br>
orientation in 8.  This leaves you a L5E option with an average of 7,<br>
but worse recognition, or an EPLL for 1 extra move and easier<br>
recognition.  Things to think about.<br>
<br>
I spent most of work tonight figuring out average move counts for the<br>
steps, and working out the odds of nice cases.  With practice, you can<br>
place any of the DB edges in under 3, finish the L5E if they&#x27;re<br>
oriented in under 7, finish with ELL if the F2L comes up solved in 12,<br>
or finish the normal way in 13, but the latter two can be lessened<br>
considerably if you wisely insert the DB edge, and choose the nicest<br>
edge to start with.<br>
<br>
Starting with any of the 4 possible DB edges gives you an almost 16%<br>
chance for an O5E skip, a 34% chance for an easy F2L finish, and<br>
leaves you with under half of the cases giving you a &#x27;normal&#x27; solve,<br>
because that option needs the most optimizing still.  Going with these<br>
odds, one can average around 15 moves quite easily with this method.<br>
<br>
Going slowly (because I&#x27;m still learning most of the algs ;P) I took<br>
some average move counts earlier.<br>
13 17 16 12 17 13 20 17 20 7*  = 15.2<br>
10 12 18 11 16 18 17 15 15 13 = 14.5<br>
12 12 16 13 17 16 17 11 18 18 = 15.0<br>
= 14.9 overall<br>
* was an OLL skip after placing DB.<br>
With more ELL&#x27;s and better P5E, I think this will drop nicely.<br>
<br>
If nothing else, the 15.02 was exciting enough to convince me to press<br>
on with this, even if it turns out to be less efficient or slower than<br>
what&#x27;s already out there.  Still, I&#x27;m convinced this step can be sub-4<br>
pretty well.  At least....in theory. ;P<br>
<br>
Anyone with ideas, criticism, suggestions, etc, please post.  Gilles<br>
and Jason especially.  Don&#x27;t be so quiet, guys.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I just realised it&#x27;s better to do the edge 3-cycle before the u-
turn, like this :

R U&#x27; F - F&#x27; r F&#x27; L2 F r&#x27; F&#x27; L2 F2 - u F&#x27; U R&#x27;

F - F&#x27; cancels to give this very neat solution :

R U&#x27; r F&#x27; L2 F r&#x27; F&#x27; L2 F2 u F&#x27; U R&#x27; (17 htm, 14 stm)

I guess that&#x27;s my best shot ;-)

This is fun !

Another pattern along these lines is the following:

F&#x27; U2 R&#x27; U2 B&#x27; L U2 L&#x27; u L U2 L&#x27; B U2 R U2 F (18-htm, 17-stm)

or

F&#x27; R&#x27; f&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; u2 r&#x27; u2 r2 F D f R F (20-htm, 14-stm)

(Don&#x27;t forget that here lower case means inner slice turns...)

I don&#x27;t dare ask Cube Explorer or ACube to search for me cause of 
course then my solutions don&#x27;t look short anymore :-P

top), and the edges anti-clockwise.

Now add an H permutation and you have a very nice pattern :p (swap the
opposite edges on the top layer).
it&#x27;s some sort of &#x27;Arc de Triomphe&#x27; (the monument in Paris):D

It&#x27;s not hard find these if u understand the nature of inner slice 
turns. They cycle 4 centers and 4 edges. So u know how many edges 
that u have to &quot;fix&quot; after such a turn. And you insert edges into 
the slice as needed. Oh, and 25 yrs of cubing experience and fewest 
moves does help a lot :-)

&quot;- in 1 out of 12 cases you can solve the LL in one algorithm!<br>

Yes, it is.  If you used optimal algs, it would be 11(7)/12. ;)  My
PELLs though are [8(11) + 2(9) + 7]/12, so I have a 9.4 move average
for this step.  For me, PLL averages 11.9 moves (using the ones listed
on my PLL page).  However, this is a 75% chance of having to AUF after
a PLL, so it is actually 12.65 moves on average for my PLL.  My COLL
move average (again, using the ones on my page) is 9.22 moves.  This
takes into the probabilities of each case and a 1/27 chance to skip
OLL, assuming you orient all edges during F2L.

> ELL Move Count  12?
STM, right?

> PELL Move Count 8?
For me, 9.4

> CLL Move Count  9?
Probably less

> COLL Move Count 14?
For me, 9 moves

No, those were my estimates for OLL/PLL.

> Has anybody calculated CLL, COLL, OLL, PLL, ELL, PELL, but taking into

The figures I just gave take into account chance of occurance.  I
calculated my OLL algorithm average, too.  Here is my summary:

OLL - 9.68 moves
PLL - 11.9 moves + .75 = 12.65
COLL - 9.22 moves
EPLL - 9.4 moves + .75 = 10.15

Again, this is based on the algorithms I use, not optimal ones.

Low was 35 moves
High was only 55 moves!

On Gilles Site, under MISC, there is a page about Number of Moves. 
Depending on the amount of time you have, you can optimize more. From
48 to &lt;28.  I took probably about 1.5 min for each cube(including
Preinspection, Recognition, Execution, Counting Moves, and Recording
Moves for Each Step), So I was real pleased with 45 moves/cube.  I was
also psyched when I saw how closely the Step 4 avg matched my avg of
100.  13.3 compared to 13.2, respectively.

I think that this is one of the most effecient systems out there, in
terms of moves.  Now I just need to figure out what&#x27;s taking me so
long to do it.

I don&#x27;t use Gille&#x27;s method AT ALL, but I&#x27;ve been messing around with methods

haven&#x27;t checked and I have waaay to much to do right now.

I have about half of the algs for DF edge and corners orientation if you

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Possible Roux method improvements

 

Hello all,

I&#x27;ve been playing around with the Roux method a lot lately, and I&#x27;ve
decided it needs as much attention and perfecting as Fridrich and
company are getting. :)

To that end, I&#x27;ve been trying to find ways to speed the Last 6 edges
(and 4 centers) up, and thinking a lot about several variations of the
normal method.

First, there&#x27;s unconstrained centers.  This can shorten some of the
hardest orientation situations from 12 moves down to 5 or 6, but the
recognition seems akin to ZB to me.  I need more practice with this,
definitely, but I think that it may take too much time, even with
mastery. (sorry, Gilles)  The whole Step 4 method takes something like
18 moves on average, if my math is anywhere near correct.

Instead of orienting and permuting L6E, what if we were to finish off
DF and DB edges, then complete the cube with ELL?  The hardest
situations for finishing the two edges should be around 7 moves, with
the average being somewhere around 6.  ELL averages about 12 moves, so
that puts the method in similar standing to the normal way.

But what if we only finish off the DB edge?  It can only be in 6
places, each place having 2 possible orientations.  Thus, 12 simple
cases, 11 of which are 5 moves or fewer. The average move count should
be about 3.5, with the hardest situations at 7.  You don&#x27;t need to
orient centers prior to this step, either.  And recognition is very
simple.  The hardest case to spot is when the piece is already
correct. :)  After this, we could use any of the 22 possible cases
found here: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/NewAlgSet.html

This would give us an average of under 7 moves to place the DF edge
and orient the LL edges, leaving us with an edge PLL step, as in COLL.
As edge PLL&#x27;s average 7 moves, our previous step averages 6.5 or so,
and our first step at 3.5, this gives us around 17 again.  The
benefits?  Aside from the 1/12 chance for a PLL skip, and the
extremely easy to recognize and execute EPLL step, you never need to
change your grip, and after the DF and DB edges are placed, you never
need to adjust the M slice.

Also, there are a number of lucky cases to exploit.  There are only 29
or so unique cases for when the edges come up correctly oriented after
placing DB.  There are some very fast cases for when edges are
correctly placed but incorrectly oriented, and learning the ELL algs
can help out nicely for the 1/10 of cases where the DF edge completes
itself along with DB.  The worst case scenario is 26 moves to finish,
and comes up roughly 1/2880 cases, while the odds for a 4 move or
fewer solution are 1/72.

When someone gets an OLL or PLL skip with Fridrich, the solve is
usually in the low 40&#x27;s for the number of moves.  A PLL skip with COLL
will probably be between 40 and 45. A very nice ZB solve may be in the
mid to high 30&#x27;s.  With good 1x2x3&#x27;s and a nice CLL case (like
FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27; or B&#x27; R&#x27;FR B R&#x27;F&#x27;R), a sub or low 30&#x27;s move solve is a good
possibility.  Something like 1/312 solves (more once I learn more
CLL&#x27;s instead of slow COLL&#x27;s :P)

If anyone is interested in hearing more about this, or helping me to
further this approach, please let me know.  I could definitely use the
services of someone who is good with ACube.

Anyway, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going through my head right now.  Gilles, Jason,
and others, what do you think?

&gt; <br>
&gt; OLL - 9.68 moves<br>
&gt; PLL - 11.9 moves + .75 = 12.65<br>

For Your 1/27 chance of skip OLL, Have you taken into account that<br>
only 1/6 of these will be a true COLL skip?  1/162 chance of COLL<br>
skips, is that right?  If you&#x27;re using OE, COLL, PELL, and you don&#x27;t<br>
know PLL, then an OLL skip doesn&#x27;t help you unless it&#x27;s a COLL skip.<br>
<br>

to believe that COLL is only 9 moves avg.  Seems like it should be more...<br>

For you yes, but I use the MU algs to cycle 3 edges, and a 9 move alg
for the Z perm, so my average is (STM) ~7.  I&#x27;m definitely going to
try out your fewer move Z perm, though.

Yep.

Depends on the algs. ~7 for me.

Probably less, but that&#x27;s a reasonably close guess. I would guess
around 8.
 
> > COLL Move Count 14?

I average about 10.15 moves for this case, but I have a couple of
suboptimal sequences in there bringing it down.
 
I&#x27;ll get back to you on CLL once I actually learn more of them.  At
the moment I&#x27;m really only using probably half a dozen of them, and
using COLL for the vast majority of cases.  I really should work on that.

To correctly weight them, you should take each case and count the
average number of moves.  Add all of them together except the Double
Sune cases.  Double that.  Then add the Double Sune cases together,
and quadruple that.  Now, divide by the number of algs.  It should be
88.  This should work for both CLL and COLL.

ELL should average about 12, if you use MU algs, and less if you use
more optimal ones.

And who cares about OLL algs? ;P

But since Bob knows PLL, it&#x27;s just an OLL skip to him.  1/6 will be
very easy PLL&#x27;s, though.  When I solve with COLL and get OLL skips, I
do PLL.  You can get some very nice times this way.

>1/162 chance of COLL skips, is that right?

Yes.  But 1/6 you will have a nice no corner perm COLL, and 1/27 you
will have just a PLL case.

Well, to find out my average, I looked at Lars Vandenbergh&#x27;s COLL
page, and went through each case.  Many of them are 7 or 8 moves long.

CLL&#x27;s are even better. I &lt;3 FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;.

Congrats on averaging 13 moves for step 4!  Dont you love when you get
a 6-7 move step 4?
THats very Close to my Avgs, especially CLL and Step 4.  I think that
This whole system averages less moves than Petrus any variation of
CFOP, for sure.  Doing F2B in 25 is pretty easy, so 8-9 for CLL +
12-13 for Step 4, you&#x27;re always in the 40s.  Just hard to recognize
everything quickly.

&gt;Edge algs are very useful to me now.  Here are all that I can think<br>
&gt;of.  Position is not really a factor, Im mostly concerned with<br>
&gt;orientation.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;If anyone is not familiar with this numbering system for edges, its<br>
&gt;very simple.  1-4 is the U layer. 5-8 is the middle layer. 9-12 is the<br>
&gt;D layer.  1, 5, and 9 Start on the F slice, and you move clockwise as<br>
&gt;viewed from above. So UF-1 UL-2 UB-3 UR-4 DF-9 DB-11.  These are the<br>
&gt;only ones I&#x27;m really concerned with.<br>

&gt;My favorite of the pureflips is (RBR&#x27;U)5, and its so close to what I<br>
&gt;need.  I need a quick way to flip 1,2,3,5,9,11.  Position is not a<br>
&gt;factor, and I don&#x27;t care if its all M and U.  I&#x27;d actually prefer<br>
&gt;something similar to (RBR&#x27;U)5...<br>

Did you mean 1,2,3,4,9,11 like in your post title ?
what about (M&#x27;UMU)2U MUM&#x27;U2 ?
I&#x27;m not sure I fully understood what you were looking for, but that 
one flips the edges you want. It&#x27;s not a pure flip however ... and you 
may find it too long ;-)
That&#x27;s the first one I came up with, built on the effect of M&#x27;UM, tell 
us if it fits your needs ;-)

&gt;If anyone is not familiar with this numbering system for edges, its<br>

&gt;My favorite of the pureflips is (RBR&#x27;U)5, and its so close to what I<br>
&gt;need.  I need a quick way to flip 1,2,3,5,9,11.  Position is not a<br>

I realize that only 1/162 is a true COLL skip, but I went under the
assumption that anybody who learned COLL did so after learning PLL, so
they would use PLL for those 1/27 cases.

Well, if you don&#x27;t trust my numbers, you can verify yourself.  I list
all of my COLL algorithms here:
http://www.cubewhiz.com/coll.html

Multiply the number of moves for every algorithm by 4 except the
Double-sune (H) ones, those get multiplied by 2.  Then add them up and
divide by 162.  I consider a PLL case to be a COLL skip using this
method.  Many of the COLL algorithms are only 7 or 8 moves, so I
believe the number is right, but you can verify if you want. :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

That &#x27;Arc de Triomphe&#x27; is so well known that i didn&#x27;t bother to post 
it yet. Even Stefan knows that one ;-) Here&#x27;s my way of doing that 
one :

F&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; F L&#x27; F&#x27; u F L F&#x27; B R F 

or

F&#x27; R&#x27; f&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; r&#x27; F D f R F (14-htm, 11-stm)

The first 5 moves are setup moves for what the r&#x27; does.

[Actually i normally do it the first way. The second way is slice-
turn optimised notation.]

Have fun!

I realised only one case was left now so here it is :

R F - F&#x27; r F&#x27; L2 F r&#x27; F&#x27; L2 F2 - u F&#x27; R&#x27;

or

(R r) F&#x27; L2 F r&#x27; F&#x27; L2 F2 u F&#x27; R&#x27; (13-htm, 11-stm)

Cheers!

-Per

PS! Since lower case here are inner slice turns, (Rr) is the same as 
fingertrick r alone ;-)

Sacre bleu ;-) I&#x27;m sure u are aware of inverses right? So, go ahead

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t want to close off the US 2006 competition because I&#x27;d like to  
encourage participation from everyone.  Sure, the competition is about  
finding the fastest United States cuber, but there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t  
let other people join in on the fun.

We&#x27;ll keep the competition results separate so that the media doesn&#x27;t  
get confused.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Matt,<br>
<br>
That hasn&#x27;t been decided yet.  It should be noted, however, that the <br>
international competition will be probably much harder.  There&#x27;s this <br>
guy, I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve heard of him, but his name is Macky, and <br>
he&#x27;s from Japan.  Other than that, in the end, I&#x27;d be fine with <br>
comparing all of the averages and awarding some type of prize to the <br>
fastest final round average, but it should be noted the prizes won&#x27;t be <br>
cash prizes as we don&#x27;t have that type of money.  At most, Mark <br>
Sullivan will take you on a ride in a pond in a swan boat.  Or <br>
something like that.<br>
<br>
People may have gone to WC 2005 to win money or prizes, but I&#x27;m really <br>
hoping that isn&#x27;t the focus of our competition.  US Nationals will <br>
provide a very high level of competition and a very competitive <br>
atmosphere while bringing in people certainly from all around the <br>
United States—that&#x27;s our main goal.<br>

This is my best so far:
r D&#x27; f&#x27; D r&#x27; U&#x27; B2 f&#x27; U f U2 f&#x27; U f&#x27; B2 U (19 htm, 16 stm)

That &quot;interesting pattern&quot; which I mentioned in my first email in this

looking for the other I kept ending up there.

I guess ur alg should be :

I got really bored and did it.

  If you account for the True COLL skip then you have to add 0(1),
9(4), and 14(1) before you divide by 162.  THis leaves you with a
9.777777777 move avg for COLL.  
Treating these cases as COLL skips, and adding nothing for these 6
cases, I got a 9.49 move avg for your COLL. Either way, it is pretty
impressive. I thought for some reason that COLL was Longer.  

I will for sure learn COLL in addition to CLL(Probably from your pages) =)

PS. How do I tell which 2 corners need to switch?  Other than doing
the inverse of the algs...  I use Red on top.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t done this in a long time and figured I would try it again.<br>
<br>
I was solving when I came across a good scramble and got a good time.<br>
<br>
The scramble was:<br>
L2 D&#x27; B&#x27; U2 B L2 R2 D F D U R2 F R&#x27; F U&#x27; R U&#x27; L&#x27; D2 B2 L&#x27; B R D&#x27;<br>
<br>
and my times was 12.69 which I am very happy with.<br>
<br>
Well I then did a prepared solve average, where I did an average of 10<br>
but using this same scramble for all 12 solves.<br>
<br>
My average was 9.39 seconds:<br>
(12.16) 09.67 09.53 08.39 09.02 (07.86) 10.12 10.35 07.92 09.94 09.62<br>
09.29 = 9.39<br>
<br>
I then continued for a best rolling average and got 8.09 seconds<br>
08.53, (07.11), 08.00, (09.15), 08.89, 07.24, 08.67, 07.13, 07.48,<br>
09.05, 08.02, 07.93 = 8.09<br>
<br>
My best execution of my solution so far is 6.72 seconds.<br>
<br>
My solution is 37 moves after cancellations from the end of one step<br>
being the inverse move of the beginning of the next (which I didn&#x27;t<br>
catch in my first real solve).  This solve is not lucky either, and<br>
has a regular 2 look Fridrich LL (though a fast one).<br>
<br>
If you know my solving style, you&#x27;ll know how I started this solve,<br>
and the rest is very obvious.<br>
<br>
See what you guys can do, this scramble rocks!<br>

COLL is nice and short. :)  I calculated 9.22, but I could have made a
mistake.  I agree with you for adding that 9*4 + 14 first if you do
not know PLL, but the original purpose of COLL was for the VH system
(I think?), which is an extension of the Fridrich system.

Cool.  Good luck. :)  I believe a bunch of the cases are the same.

Well, I don&#x27;t actually look at which ones need to switch.  I use a
variant of the &quot;sticker recognition&quot; system.  There are links to other
COLL pages that describe it at the bottom of my COLL page.  I describe
the recognition I look for for every case on my page, too.  If you
already know CLL recognition, though, you can still use that.

Hi Per,

How do you get 21 htm?

r D&#x27; f&#x27; D r&#x27; U&#x27; B2 f&#x27; U f U2 f&#x27; U f&#x27; B2 U ---16
----------------+1--------+1---------+1-----=19

Anyway, I like a lot of your sequences.

Cheers,

          <div class="email-content">Hi David :-)

The counting u do there is sqtm counting, not htm. In htm both B2 
and B have length 1, but inner slice turns are length 2 in htm, 
unlike in stm or sqtm ;-) That would seem to make ur algorithm 23 
moves, but B2 f&#x27; and f B2 are only 2 moves due to cancellation ;-)

So F is 1 move in all metrics (htm,qtm,stm,sqtm).
And f2 is 2 moves in htm, 4 moves in qtm, 1 in stm and 2 in sqtm.
(Here f2 = S2)

[htm = half turn metric
stm = slice turn metric
qtm = quarter turn metric
sqtm = slice quarter turn metric]

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, Per :) I really do need to keep my metrics straight.

If the &quot;For You&quot; was called &quot;Arc de Triomphe&quot; then what would this be
called?

R U&#x27; F U2 F&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; B U&#x27;R U2 R&#x27; U B&#x27;

It looks more like stonehenge.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Ok, here&#x27;s a slightly different case:

R2 u R&#x27; U D F&#x27; (L2 D2)*3 F U&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; (17-htm, 16-stm)

With another u&#x27; at the end it&#x27;s cool middle layer alg, but i like it 
better without it.

Oh, and i can of course postpone the first R2 to have this one:

u R&#x27; U D F&#x27; (L2 D2)*3 F U&#x27; D&#x27; R (16-htm, 15-stm)

Cheers!

My &quot;5 minute&quot; solution is like this :

B F2 L [B L L&#x27; B>] B2 R&#x27; B&#x27; L R B R B&#x27; F R D R&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; [U&#x27; U] B&#x27; D&#x27; B 
U&#x27; B&#x27; D B (R&#x27; B2 R F2 )*2 (32-htm,31-stm,38-qtm)

This is ending with 5 corners, not insertion optimised in any way. 
What is your exact 37-move solution ??

Have fun!

Here is my 5min solution to the same scramble.
I don&#x27;t ever do fewest moves, but I think I&#x27;d like to start.


B1  : x&#x27; BUDFDF&#x27;
B2  : x&#x27; r&#x27; R&#x27; U r U&#x27; R&#x27;
COLL: y&#x27; RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;
S4  : y&#x27; M U2 M&#x27; U&#x27; M U2 M2 U M2 U2 Rr

31 Moves (the way I count. I dont know all the metrics)

(this was the solution I came up with (i&#x27;m still learning F2L) and<br>
Chris (Hardwick) said that it was exactly how he solved it, to the<br>
move, and yah...)<br>
<br>
I count...21 using HTM (i think)<br>
<br>
Now everyone can see how horrible my LL is :D And for everyone&#x27;s<br>
knowledge (and you can ask Chris if you doubt me) I found about 12<br>
different ways of executing the LL here using my method...So I might<br>
as well list as many as I can think of...<br>
<br>
1: z U&#x27; R U R F R2 F&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U z&#x27; M&#x27; U&#x27; M U2 M&#x27; U&#x27; M U&#x27; y&#x27; x&#x27; R2 D2<br>

Some of the parts in this can be done in different orders...it really<br>
doesn&#x27;t matter and it accounts for I believe 1 or 2 different ways...<br>
<br>
2: z U&#x27; R U R F R2 F&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U z&#x27; U x&#x27; z2 R U&#x27; R D2 R&#x27; U R D2 R2 x y2<br>

why am i doing this ugh...<br>
<br>
3: z U&#x27; R U R F R2 F&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U z&#x27; y&#x27; M&#x27; U M U2 M&#x27; U M U&#x27; x&#x27; R2 D2 R&#x27;<br>

D2 F (47 HTM)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll save you all the troubles of trying more and me the trouble of<br>
typing them out...Could someone post a good LL to this solve for me to<br>
try???(using my F2L)<br>

          <div class="email-content">there is at least one way, using the idea you sure had for the X-
cross: F&#x27;LF BUB&#x27; L&#x27; (quite self-explicit)

oh, then from this start you can solve the two remaining pairs with a 
nice 2-gen 14-moves sequence, U2R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;U2R2U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;UR, but that was 
not the purpose of the post :-)

wanna try a prepared solve record with that start ;) ?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

Yeah Craig beat me to the punch :-D

I was showing Craig some F2L tricks, and I speedsolved this scramble
before we ran through it together so I could say what I realistically
did while speedsolving.

Watch out for Craig man, his F2L is getting very very nice :-)

Yes that was my F2L, and the LL is a P OLL case and the 7 PLL case.

Here is how I executed it to solve in 6.72 seconds:

y&#x27; L (B&#x27;) (R D2) R y (L&#x27; U2) (L&#x27; U L U&#x27; L&#x27;) [U&#x27; d&#x27;] (R U R&#x27;) d (R U&#x27;
R2) d&#x27; (L&#x27; U L) [d U] (R U2) (R&#x27; F R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) (R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27;)

That&#x27;s a sustained 5.5 moves per second turning rate :-D

It surprised me that a Fridrich solve could be sub-7 seconds with
practice.  Though there&#x27;s no way that could be done with a high-30
move solution as a real solve though.  I was turning so fast I
couldn&#x27;t even follow the pieces, I was just acting on muscle memory.

My 7 PLL is low 2.xx on a good execution, so often I was getting the
F2L and OLL in 4 seconds, so I imagine I was doing F2L in 3 seconds
sometimes :-D  That is of course from muscle memory, but it was nice
to have a horrible LL lockup, and still get an 8 second solve :-D

I can definitely see how I can speed up my F2L after doing this though.

Try executing it that way and see what you think, it&#x27;s craaaaaazy fast.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone<br>
<br>
I just got my DIY cubes via UPS today.  I have been using my studio<br>
cube and a 25th anniversary cube with cubesmith stickers forever.  <br>
<br>
1.  The centers I got this time are different that the ones I got last<br>
time.  THere are no tabs, and the centers *almost* stay in on their<br>
own.  Is there any way to avoid Gluing them in there?  I want to be<br>
able to take them off.<br>
<br>
2.  For the plastic, black washers, there is a convex side and a<br>
totally flat side.  Which side should face the spring?  These washers<br>
are just for the bottom, right?<br>
<br>
3.  Some of my corner pieces came assembled, but a few came without a<br>
certain piece.  You have to put it in yourself.  But I cant seem to<br>
get the piece to be flush with the corner.  Has anyone else<br>
experienced this?<br>
<br>
4.  Final Question:  What&#x27;s a good ballpark guideline on how tight to<br>
tighten the screws?  2 previous DIYs got loose really quickly, and I<br>
couldn&#x27;t adjust the tension, b/c i had superglued the caps on. I feel<br>
like I should have started off making them super tight.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I forgot where I read it, but instead of gluing the caps, you can use
paper.  Cut out a + of paper, such that you have one arm of the cross
overhanging each side of the center.  Push the center cap in, and the paper
will be pushed down and create a tighter fit along the edges.  Simple tear
or cut any excess paper that is sticking out after you are done.

Hope that helps,
-Evan

Until next time, Happy cubing

          This is excellent. High flyoing feelings, isn&#x27;t it ? You have achieved this in 6 months!!! that is wonderful. Keep going and have fun. After a year of cubing I am so near and yet so far.

<br>
I&#x27;ve only been practicing one-handed solving seriosly for like 6 weeks <br>
and yesterday I broke my average record with almost 3 seconds and <br>
reached 8th place in the world!!! I&#x27;m so exited!! :-D<br>

42.06, 33.71, 40.26<br>
<br>
I still only know how to execute about 20 OLL cases with one hand so <br>
there is a LOT of room for improvement. I think that as soon as I <br>
learn some more OLLs I may be able to average sub-35. I&#x27;m putting a <br>
lot of effort into one-handed solving right now to be able to compete <br>
with the fastest guys (not Ryan; his times are impossible to beat).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gunnar,
Congratulations!  I&#x27;ve been one-handing for ever (!) and my best average is 
only a couple of seconds faster.  I recently got my first sub-30seconds 
single solve - which given my two-handed average is only just under 30 
seconds is quite surprising.  I fear one day I may be faster with one hand 
than two!

          <div class="email-content">Hi All<br>
Just a progress update.  I am pretty much solving full time with my L2L2 <br>
strategy now.  Although my times are still slower until I get faster at the <br>
recognition/selection process, my average number of moves per solve is a lot <br>
less now.  I did 10 solves recently at 52-53 moves which is probably close <br>
to the right figure.  Number of moves is mostly reliant on getting the cross <br>
plus two corners in as few moves as possible - or if you were to choose a <br>
different approach for the start - F2L less two middle edges.  There may <br>
still be room for improvement in this - I&#x27;ve been thinking of spending some <br>
time on Chris&#x27; X-cross work to see if anything is applicable.  Also Paul <br>
Nixon has tried starting with the Petrus 3x2x2 but got bogged down.  I don&#x27;t <br>
know this but it may offer another way to start L2L solves.  Any comments or <br>
suggestions more than welcome :)<br>

Now i been studying ur solution ... or rather been trying. Ur 
solution does not solve the scramble at all. I set it all up in the

I&#x27;ll see if i can spot the error in ur solution. Maybe it&#x27;s simply 
en orientation error ;-)

  yeah, it was really good to do this sub-20 average. But I still have to work to be consintently sub-20...
  and please no need to call me &quot;Mr.&quot;. I&#x27;m just 16 years old...hehe
   
  well, you&#x27;re cubing for 1 year, but you&#x27;re just 9 years old, don&#x27;t you? Your times are very very very impressive for someone with your age. Keep going and you&#x27;ll be one of the top in a short time

Hey Per I just tried it again and it worked for me.  I did it on a
regular cube though.  The only thing I can think of is maybe the y&#x27;
that starts it?  Also the lower case d turns are really the D and E
layers turned together, but I&#x27;m sure you already knew that.

After the scramble, do the y&#x27; at the very beginning, and then the rest
of the solve as written above.

It worked for me when I tried it?  I hope it was just the y&#x27; ?

Let me know if it still doesn&#x27;t work.

Hmm ... are we still talking bout this scramble:

I have now tried changing the y&#x27; with y or any other x,z in ur

Haha, now i feel stupid, how come i didn&#x27;t try that ... :-o

Now it worked fine. But Chris, the solution is 39 moves not 37. It&#x27;s 
the same as :

B R&#x27; F D2 F L&#x27; U2 L&#x27; U L U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; U&#x27; B U B&#x27; U R U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F&#x27; U F U U 
R U2 R&#x27; F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; (converted by the fmc companion). 
Aha!! And now i also see why it really is 37, not 39 :-P I really 
hate x,y,z :D

Cheers!

All mine are actually htm-optimised since that&#x27;s the FMC-metric ;-)

I should try become better at stm-optimisation, cause that&#x27;s the 
metric i really see as the most fair one. I honor inner slice turns 
as 1 turn only. And i can&#x27;t see why half turns should be punished 
and considered to be of length 2 ;-)

For the way I think about the cube, I agree with you that all turns
and slices are equal. For the formal mathematical aspects of the cube
I recognize the value of the quarter turn.

Here&#x27;s the r and U only version. Some would say the MU, version so
this is for the cowboys among us. :)

U r&#x27; U r U2 r U2 r&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; U r&#x27; U2 r U r2 U&#x27;

Cheers,

If you&#x27;re new to the game, I would suggest trying many methods at
first and then choose which one you would like to devote your time to.

I started with Corners First when I was 14 (10 years ago)
took an 8 year break
1.5 years ago learned Corners First Faster(about 35-40sec)
1 years ago I switched to CFOP (24.xx avg avg- best avg 23.88)
5 weeks ago I switched to Gilles Roux&#x27;s method (27.xx avg avg)

I also tried Petrus but the lack of notation made it hard for me to
learn.  Also, It seems that everything on the site is &#x27;left handed.&#x27;
Despite all this, I always start with a 2x2 (X cross) when doing CFOP.

I have used 3 different systems now.  ROUX method is my favorite just
because of Move Count Efficiency.  I averaged 45 moves/cube for 12
cubes.  Best Solve so far 31 moves.

take a look here if you want

Hi Emanuele,

I was long plagued by difficulty in remembering them (it&#x27;s such a
mess, so I use the mnemonics &quot;Right Up Front,&quot; and &quot;mess&quot; Fortunately,
the whole cube rotations used - x, y, and z are also &quot;Right Up Front.&quot;

Turn Side and Cube turn  
Right, R = M&#x27; = x
Up,    U = E&#x27; = y
Front  F = S  = z

Part of the mess is that the first two, M and E, are counterclockwise,
the S is clockwise.

Also &quot;w&quot; means &quot;with&quot; as in take the middle slice with that side.


Regards,

David J

I&#x27;d agree that you should try different methods.  And I&#x27;ll even help you by
pointing you to my intermediate solution ;-)

And if you find that you have trouble understanding certain aspects of any
solution, I&#x27;m sure people would be more than happy to help.

Good luck cubing,

  that&#x27;s a nice method. I&#x27;m sure going to use it. Well, on the gabbasoft demo, &#x27;cause my real 4x4x4 is still not here..: ( But I just got a 4:36, which is a good time for me...hehe

          <div class="email-content">Hi Duncan,

In the old days I averaged somewhere between 36 and 54 moves, with
occasional forays above and below that, but I rarely tried to improve
solely on the basis of fewer moves. 

You got me wondering about how many moves it takes me now. So I did 16
solves: 46, 44, 41, 38, 46, 44, 47, 46, 48, 46, 45, 35, 48, 49, 46, 45.  

I know I can look ahead better and understand more than I&#x27;m do now.

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for sharing Stefan! I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this approach. I
like how you use the &#x27;yellow face&#x27; after solving the l slice. I&#x27;ll try
it some more, it&#x27;d be nice to give that phase of the 4x4 solution a
bit more steadiness (sp?). 

Because I start with the easiest colors for preferably two centers, I
don&#x27;t know if this approach will be faster for me.

Thanks again :)

Hi Stefan,

Very interesting and highly original approach.  I just did a couple 
of solves and I really enjoyed using this approach.

One small question for step 3 (shooting non-yellow centers from U 
into their proper home on u):

&quot;Each shot is either (Rr)&#x27; F (Rr) or (Ll) F&#x27; (Ll)&quot;

Why not (Rr) U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;???  It is the same &#x27;go and get&#x27; approach, 
still only three moves, but the middle move is U instead of F 
keeping the entire step in the (Ll), U, (Rr) gen category.

I like your combination move for adjacent pairs in step 3 especially 
combined with the observation that diagonals will combine with any 
intervening shot.  

If stuck with a diagonal pair at the end it can also be quite 
elegantly combined into:

    (Rr)  U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;  U   (Ll)&#x27; U  (Ll)   [pieces in Ufl and Ubr]
or  (Ll)&#x27; U  (Ll)   U&#x27;  (Rr)  U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;  [pieces in Ubl and Ufr]



Do you have any data on number of moves for your technique compared 
the &#x27;usual&#x27; approach (opp centers, any 3rd face, adjacent 4th, 
simultanious adjacent 5th/6th)??


Interesting, original, and fun!

Thanks,

Rob

Good question, thanks. In that case, I&#x27;d go to step 3 and first solve 
the 3 remaining red centers, for example with (Rr)&#x27; F2 (RrLl) F&#x27; (Ll)
&#x27;. In the very rare case that all four of a color are opposite the

(during a regular solve) shoot down a pair with F&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; F2 (Rr) but I 
don&#x27;t like that, I prefer the (Rr)&#x27; F (RrLl) F&#x27; (Ll)&#x27;.

Though pairing-up/centers first is not my approach i appreciate that 
u make a page with ur 4x4x4 centers-first strategy. Even if i can 
pretty much understand what u are on about, isn&#x27;t it a better idea 
with some diagrams and/or applets. Something like on 
www.bigcubes.com ? I know this takes more time to make of course ;-) 
And maybe it&#x27;s ur exam period also ...

Yes, you&#x27;re right. Actually it&#x27;s of course the same, just 
holding/rotating the cube differently. I actually do something in the 
&quot;middle&quot; I think.

I&#x27;ve included this remark on my page now. I also fixed two mistakes in 
algorithms, made the page look a bit better, and added Pedro&#x27;s issue 
and another suggestion how to hold your arms.

Right. To be honest, I also use that in the middle of the solve. When 
the intervening shot would have to go to L or R, I&#x27;d have to rotate 
the cube first, so instead I solve the diagonal pair like you said. 
It&#x27;s also good because it doesn&#x27;t require any &#x27;setup&#x27; move, you can 
use one of those two algs right away (this is something I only thought 
about right now). I&#x27;ll add this to my page, too.

I think both need about the same number of moves, around 30. I&#x27;m 
usually a bit over 30 but when I explained my method to Ron he soon 
told me he averages about 28-29 I think. Since I don&#x27;t use that 
&#x27;usual&#x27; approach, I don&#x27;t exactly know the number of moves it 
requires, but I think it&#x27;s about 30 as well.

Thanks for the feedback and suggestions :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Thanks to feedback and some extra thoughts, I improved the page a now. 
Besides a little algorithm bugfix, all changes are in the 
&quot;Improvements&quot; section. And yes, an applet example solve or two might 
follow, but also yes, that takes much more time :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Masayuki Akimoto got a DNF in Orlando on the 5x5x5 cause a center-
corner was slightly twisted. I think that rule is ridiculous. It&#x27;s 
not like he has willingly tried to benefit from it. It&#x27;s just a bit 
of bad luck on his side. Sometimes one cannot even notice this 
unwanted rotation, unless turning some slice that has become harder 
to turn. So if it happens just at the very last turn or something u 
can have that twisting and not knowing it. A pop however of course u 
will notice and u have the chance to fix it. Well, i hope they will 
change that rule soon. The same if u have ONE broken center. U 
cannot benefit from it in any way whatsoever. TWO broken centers and 
u won&#x27;t know which is which of course.

Oh well ...

Hello again Stefan,<br>

For instances where the next shot needs to go to the L or R face I <br>
sometimes find it comfortable / convenient to do a [u&#x27;dD] or [ud&#x27;D&#x27;] <br>
move.  i.e. I hold the U face and send the bottom three layers to the <br>
left or right.  It is very similar concept to using [DE] and [D&#x27;E&#x27;] <br>
during F2L on a 3x3x3.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think the issue is that a twisted center results from careless 
twisting.  The main problem we have when writing regulations is where 
to draw the line.  If the centers had been ejected from the cube into a 
high altitude orbit, then the cube would clearly not be solved.  
However, if the centers are in a lower altitude orbit, like the 
International Space Station, then it becomes less clear.

So how much are the centers allowed to be out of the cube before it 
isn&#x27;t solved anymore?  Can we come up with a better answer to this 
question than we already have while still preserving the idea that the 
cube must be &quot;solved&quot;?

In my opinion, for a 3x3x3, if an edge is hanging out of the cube, it&#x27;s 
not solved.  The cube must be fully assembled when it&#x27;s finish—goal of 
the puzzle is ultimately to return it to its solved state which means 
that the colors are all the same on each side and preferably, all the 
piece are in place.  For the 3x3x3, I think it&#x27;s more clear.  The lines 
start to get blurred for larger cubes which is why we&#x27;ve set the strict 
standard for now.

If you&#x27;re going to allow center pieces to be twisted, then you&#x27;re going 
to have to specify very academically &quot;how much.&quot;

This looks hilarious.

And check out this description of the show from the website:

&quot;... each mismatched pair competes in brand new activities designed to
test intellect, fashion savvy and social skills. The guys are assigned
to make over a room, while the girls do their best to assemble a

test out their new looks during a session of speed-dating...&quot;

Hilarious. I wish this TV show was on in the UK.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Scramble:
L2 D&#x27; B&#x27; U2 B L2 R2 D F D U R2 F R&#x27; F U&#x27; R U&#x27; L&#x27; D2 B2 L&#x27; B R D&#x27;

revisited.

I started to have a look at inserting the last 5 corners for this 
solution : B F2 L [B L L&#x27; B>] B2 R&#x27; B&#x27; L R B R B&#x27; F R D R&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; [U&#x27; 
U] B&#x27; D&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27; D B (R&#x27; B2 R F2 )*2

So i start with the skeleton:

B F2 L B2 R&#x27; B&#x27; L R B R B&#x27; F R D R&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; or actually i start 
from this (change order of L and R):

B F2 L B2 R&#x27; B&#x27; R L B.R B&#x27; F R D R&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27;

Now i insert B&#x27; L&#x27; F2 L B L&#x27; F2:L at the dot and F L B L&#x27; F&#x27; L B&#x27; L&#x27; 
at the colon to get this final solution, cancelling 7 moves:

B F2 L B2 R&#x27; B&#x27; R F2 L B L&#x27; F&#x27; L B L&#x27; F&#x27; L B&#x27; R {B&#x27; F} R D R&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; 
U&#x27; (27htm, 26stm, 30qtm, 29sqtm)

I spent 5 mins for the 18 move skeleton and about 20-25 mins on the 
insertions. Quite nice for about half an hour work only.

Cheers!

You point out these but not &quot;tracks monkeys with lasers&quot;?! I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever heard of 
anyone who does that; in fact, I&#x27;ve always thought that tracking of animals was done with 
electronic tags (birds, dolphins etc.) rather than lasers.

My girlfriend is attempting to start a cube club at the University of
Minnesota (she&#x27;s taught a dozen or so people so far, some 4x4 and 5x5,
too), and hopefully that will lead to a tournament.

I believe Peter Babcock and Jake Rueth may be looking at starting one
in Wisconsin in the spring.

Any updates, guys?

Ya, I&#x27;v tought lots of people how to solve the cube as well.  There
not all as enthousiastic about it as I am, but if there was an other

          <div class="email-content">for fixing the last two edges on the 5x5 you can  do it the same way you fix the flipped edge parity on the 4x4 but i  prefer the centers first and i can do that one much faster than any  other methods. and you dont get that edges prob with the centers first  if you memorize the algs for the last two edges.

Good to see I&#x27;m not losing my mind! London weather isn&#x27;t too bad for the UK. It&#x27;s relatively 
dry and warm although it did feel cold yesterday. It could be a lot worse though; like the 
Isle Of Man.

then i remembered i have some old swimming googles with me and decided<br>
to use them as the blindfold :)  With the help of some newspaper<br>
clippings i had my blindfold ready.though it hurt a little at first :(<br>
have a look at it here<br>
http://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/~d3sachin/cubing/googles.jpg or if this is<br>
not accessible then here<br>
http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~sachins/cubing/googles.jpg<br>
<br>
They look quite silly.<br>
:)<br>
<br>
Btw the blindfold attempt was succesful with a time of 4 mins<br>
38secs...quite my normal time. You can have a look at the video of<br>
this attempt here<br>
http://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/~d3sachin/cubing/videos.html or here<br>

Happy blding!<br>

For some reason, I thought this was your blindfolded method for the
4x4 centers, which I found a very very hard method for blindfolded :p

But this is a nice method I should consider practicing..

question about intermediate next steps and learning the algorithms.<br>
<br>
I became interested in doing the Rubiks again after a 25 year hiatus. I <br>
was in FAO Schwarz in NY City a few weeks ago (picked up a Bedlam Box <br>
puzzle as well) and saw they had a bunch of 25th anniversary cubes &quot;on <br>
sale&quot; for $13. :-)  There was a guy there solving the cube in about a <br>
minute or so. Despite not being terribly speedy, I suppose since he was <br>
talking while demonstrating the cube, I wondered if that person happened <br>
to be on this list?<br>
<br>
Does anyone else make a living or otherwise entertain folks during the <br>
holiday shopping sprees this time of year?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi David,
Those are pretty amazing move numbers for a speedcubing strategy!  What 
method do you use that is so much more efficient than Fridrich?  I know with 
fewest move methods one can get much lower but if this is a speedsolving 
method then it seem to be lower than just about anything I&#x27;ve heard of.  The 
benefit of L2L is there are fewer algorithms to learn, and so also a less 
onerous recognition phase, than Fridrich - is the number of algorithms a 
problem with your method?  i&#x27;d love to hear more.

Best wishes

Duncan

Gilles is even better :-)
http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Miscellaneous.html

If I remember correctly, David takes about 30 seconds, and with that 
speed, Gilles says he averages 43 moves. And I think he wrote that 
page a while ago, maybe he has improved further in the meantime?

Cheers!

  Hello all.

I just had my friends video camera with me and thought that i would
make some bld videos before returning the cam back. Now the last time
i made a bld video, i used a hankerchief to cover my eyes. But it took
a lot of time to tie the hankerchief around my head, so i tht of using
some other method this time.

then i remembered i have some old swimming googles with me and decided
to use them as the blindfold :)  With the help of some newspaper
clippings i had my blindfold ready.though it hurt a little at first :(
have a look at it here
http://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/~d3sachin/cubing/googles.jpg or if this is
not accessible then here
http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~sachins/cubing/googles.jpg

They look quite silly.
:)

Btw the blindfold attempt was succesful with a time of 4 mins
38secs...quite my normal time. You can have a look at the video of
this attempt here
http://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/~d3sachin/cubing/videos.html or here
http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~sachins/cubing/videos.html

Happy blding!
Sachin.

I just took an average. Cubes solved in 22s-40s. 15s inspection.
Important: No take-backs.
39 42 36 (46) 44 (33) 46 37 44 37 43 42 --> 41 moves (it may rise to
44, and my best is 38)
43 is still valid, with a 30s time limit.

Good night,

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Everyone<br>
<br>
THe biggest problem I&#x27;m having is with the corner pieces.  They did<br>
not come assembled.  There is the visibly hollow corner piece and then<br>
a diamond shaped piece that fits into the bottom of the corner. <br>
However, I cannot get the piece to sit flush in there.  This piece<br>
sticking up, even a little bit, will prevent the cube from turning<br>
smoothly. Maybe I need to sand something or use a hammer to get it<br>
flush.  Has anyone else gotten (DIY cubes with DIY corners) like me?<br>
<br>
<br>
For the plastic, black washers, there is a convex side and a<br>
totally flat side. Which side should face the spring?  <br>
<br>
 Final Question: What&#x27;s a good ballpark guideline on how tight to<br>
tighten the screws? 2 previous DIYs got loose really quickly, and I<br>
couldn&#x27;t adjust the tension, b/c i had superglued the caps on. I feel<br>
like I should have started off making them super tight.<br>
<br>
Thank You<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t been around recently as a few of you may know, because I <br>
have recently been in hospital to have a major operation on my leg.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been pretty poorly over the last week or two but now I am <br>
recovering and am feeling a lot better. I am walking about (slowly!) <br>
on crutches, and I have to wear a metal frame thing around my leg to <br>
stabilise it while it heals up.<br>
<br>
So just to let you know that I am back on the scene, although I <br>
doubt I will be able to catch up with all the messages left on the <br>
group since my hospital stay. Thank goodness my hands/arms weren&#x27;t <br>
operated on so I can still cube ;) In fact, Stefan, I set 3:25.56 on <br>
the Megaminx in hospital with my new method, and that&#x27;s with only a <br>
little practice. SO watch out, I am going to beat you soon!<br>
<br>
On Friday I hope to launch the Xmas FMC if I feel well enough to <br>
stay on the computer for a few hours, if not I&#x27;ll post the scramble <br>
and the categories to the group and apologise in advance for not <br>
getting it on the site.<br>
<br>
Hope to speak to you and hear from you all soon, keep in touch!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Jason, the DIY caps are a real problem.  You almost have to resort to 
at least a drop of glue to make them stay.  The paper cross method 
only works well with the Studio-type centers, from my experience.  The 
walls on the DIY centers are too thin.

As for distance, the official recommendation is 1mm between burr and 
center post when the spring is pulled out.  However because of 
tolerances you really just have to adjust by feel.  The 1mm guieline 
is a good starting point though.

Yes, but only almost :-)

Most importantly, first you should make the cap fit into place. That 
is, cut the parts that are in the way. And when it fits, you can make 
some &quot;scratches&quot; into the plastic. But so that you don&#x27;t just press a 
hole into the plastic, but instead press it sidewards so that a bit 
sticks *out*. Do that on all four side and you should be fine.

Cheers!
Stefan

It&#x27;s good to hear from you. What exactly did they have to do with 
your leg? Anyway, I wish you the best of luck with recovering...

Did you have some time to cube in the hospital? Congratz with your 
new megaminx record! You&#x27;ll probably beat my record too, if you go 
on like this... Unless I practice some more during the holidays :). 
What is your &#x27;new method&#x27;? 

Well.. Hope to see you online again soon.. ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Duncan,

My method is based on freedom of movement. F2L I do the &quot;cross last.
The LL I do CLL ELL. 

A beginner version would look like this:
1. Place two edge pieces, i.e. one across-the-center-of-one-side pair,
on the middle level, like RF and LF (right front and left front) The
four middle level edge pieces do not have the colors of the centers of
the first and last levels. In my case these four edge pieces have
neither Orange nor Red.
2. Place four corners on the first level, (on top)
3. Place the other two edges on the middle level, 
4. place the four edges of the first level; (first level now on bottom)

There are lots of options If the first four corners can go in place
easily the middle edges are next and are often very few moves.

Most of the time I get to the last level with two edges flipped. It&#x27;s
usually quicker to solve the LL corners and flip two edges than
solving the corners while flipping no edges. This leave the ELL of 7
moves, and often the first move is already done by the last sequence. 

When placing the last of the First Level corners there is  the
opportunity to solve the LL corners in one go. This allows you to
solve the LL edges sometimes when placing the cross.   

Send me a scramble and I&#x27;ll send you a typical solve.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

First off, though I average between 25 and 32 seconds, most of my
cubing time, which is fairly limited, goes into understanding the cube
better rather than practicing for speed. 

Second, I am using only my own algorithms and haven&#x27;t found a complete
set yet. While my strategies are pretty well formed I&#x27;m not yet
satisfied with all of my algorithms. As such, my method isn&#x27;t
complete, yet. 

Third, with the exception of the placement of the last four centers
Gilles&#x27; method is an option within my method.

Fourth for a speed comparison, my best time, from about six months
ago, is 13.33 seconds.

Regards,

David J

                  Ron Van Bruchem uncle was in Chennai, India on 17th and 18th of dec-2005<br>
                 I am very very happy to have spent the week-end happily with Ron uncle. I learnt a lot and had fun. He was very good, kind and simple. <br>
               Eventhough I lost all the events to a great cuber, I enjoyed the super-mini world cup-2005 held in Chennai on 17th and 18th. It is called super-mini because only 2 competed. My disappointment for not being allowed to usa to compete in wc-2005 in Orlando was very well compensated by the super mini world cup-2005 with Ron uncle last week end. What a wonderful gesture from him to compete with this little boy travelling a long way!!  <br>
                I am greatly benefitted and enjoyed asif I had been in Orlando.  Wow, how many good quality cubes he had presented to me - square-1, 2*2, 3*3, 4*4, 5*5 !!! <br>
        Wow! at last, I shook hands with one of the best cubers in the world , talked with him, stayed with him, learnt from him, had fun with him and finally competed with him. Looking forward to many more such meetings in 2006 with you all as well.<br>
         The mini world cup-2005 held in chennai last week end was a great success. Kudos to Ron uncle, my dad and his friends and relatives to make this mini world-cup-2005 a great success. Full results Ron uncle may post at the earliest possible.( I hit many 18.xx, 19.xx and 20.xx sec in stackmat).<br>
           I am inspired.<br>

I havn&#x27;t been cubing since the &#x27;80s but some one gave me an old cube
they said was from the &#x27;80s and it has arched centers.  I know they

to find out which one it is, LOL.

I went to the store in Mission Viejo California and they had about <br>

watched him do most of it and it was really cool.  when I did it in <br>
about 45 seconds, they were all blown away.  too fun.<br>
<br>
They did not seem to mind at all that I was taking them out of the <br>

they have arched centers, and are made by Winning Moves, so <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Short answer : since 1982 or thereabout. That&#x27;s when the Deluxe 
(Game) cube first saw the light of day. Those cubes had arched 
centers unlike the original ones and most of the knock-off cubes. 

(Someone correct me if u have information contradicting this.)

Even since then most cubes have been made with plain flat inside 
centers. I guess this is simply cause they are easier and cheaper to 
make. Like already mentioned, some prefer arched centers cause of 
stability, less popping. While some prefer normal flat centers cause 
they give less locking, more forgiving.

          <div class="email-content">Can you post the manufacture dates (on the inside of one of the 
corners-- turn each face 45 degrees to locate it).  The good cube that 
I got said &quot;M1005&quot; which I take to mean it was just produced in 
October of this year.  It would be interesting to know whether these 
cubes are of higher production standards than earlier batches.

Speaking of that, is there anyone who can solve the puzzle of how 
these cubes are manufactured vs. marketed?  In other words, I know 
that currently you can get 3x3x3 cubes made by Winning Moves, Hasbro, 
or Rubiks.com.  However they appear to be the same product from 
Kroeger of Canada.  Yet they all claim to be Made in China.  Are they 
made in China, imported by Kroeger, then packaged and sold by Winning 
Moves, Hasbro, and Rubiks.com respectively?  Does Kroeger just do the 
final manufacturing (i.e. assembly and stickers)?

I&#x27;m just trying to understand where the breakdown in quality actually 
occurs.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense on the surface that Winning Moves cubes 
are superior if they&#x27;re all made at the same plant in China as the 
Hasbro cubes.

Well, I know that my first Rubik&#x27;s Cube had arched centres.  It was 
bought in the UK in early March 1981.  It wasn&#x27;t a Deluxe or Game Cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I can now report independent confirmation that Rubik&#x27;s cube can always be <br>
solved without using more than 38 quarter turns. This has been shown based <br>
upon the following results.<br>
<br>
Tom Rokicki posted a result on this forum in January, 2004, showing that the <br>
edge cubies of Rubik&#x27;s cube can always be solved in 18 quarter turns or <br>
less. (See: <br>
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/8306)  I <br>
have just verified this result, doing my own independent analysis using a <br>
Pentium 4-based PC.<br>
<br>
Silviu Radu, who I understand is working on a Ph.D. thesis on Rubik&#x27;s cube, <br>
has done an analysis showing that the corners can always be solved without <br>
any net change in the edge positions/orientations in 22 quarter turns or <br>
less. Together, the above results show that Rubik&#x27;s cube can always be <br>
solved in two phases using no more than 40 quarter turns. I have verified <br>
that Silviu&#x27;s move sequences solve all of the relevant cube positions using <br>
no more than 22 quarter turns.<br>
<br>
Rokicki&#x27;s analysis indicates there are 31 positions, considering just the <br>
edges and centers, that require more than 16 moves to properly position and <br>

Hi Eric, Per, and All,

The original design had arched centers. 

Ideal, from the very beginning in 1980, made cubes with both the flat
centers and arched centers.

The Deluxe versions, starting in 1980, all have the arches. 

When Ideal stopped making cubes I think that most of the production
models were flat centered, but I&#x27;m not sure.

The arched center pieces were reintroduced by Seven Towns about the
beginning of 2003.
Seven Towns controls all of the officially licensed cubes except for
Rubik&#x27;s Studio cubes. Their manufacturing plants are in China and they
make all the cubes which are sold by Winning Moves, Hasbro and Milton
Bradley.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Well, then either the edge-step leaves corners untouched or the 
corner-step leaves edges untouched. Is this really the case for 
those separate analyses ?? Ok, so im writing this before i have read 
the full explanations so maybe the answers are to be found there.

We also know from earlier that the cube is always solvable in 29 
half turns of the cube. So together this means that some positions 
require at least 9 half turns for the &quot;optimal&quot; solution. Of course 
solutions without half turns are possible, but those are not 
necessarily &quot;optimal&quot;.

PS! &quot;Optimal&quot; means optimal wrt proven minima, not wrt &quot;gods 
algorithm&quot; :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I think that some of the first plastics that were tried made the cubes
hard to turn, so flat centers were introduced to reduce friction. When
the plastics improved the arches came back. I think that since they
already had the tooling for the flat centers and quite a bit more
demand for cubes than they could meet, so they kept producing the flat
centers. 

I have an early 1980 Ideal Cube in the white box, and a Politoys cube
from the same time, both made in Hungary, with arches.

What do you mean by &quot;clone?&quot;

Cheers,

David J

I was mainly trying to point out that you&#x27;re counting in STM, because

I have started 3 times.
I have learned 3 different systems, and finally settled on Gilles
Roux&#x27;s Method.  I started off w/ Corners 1st, and then switched to
Fridrich/Petrus.  I spent about 6 months on Corners 1st, and a year on
Fridrich. 
6 weeks ago switched to ROUX method, and have already achieved a best
avg (so far) of 25.56sec, with a best time of 17.34.

Whatever you do, look at all of the methods and decide for yourself
which one you want to go with.  I like Roux because it has a low move
count, and uses both Corners 1st and LBL strategies.

just because it seems easier.  For all methods there are more beginner

are also many more methods that you can find by scouring the web, or
checking the links page at speedcubing.com.  And lastly, don&#x27;t forget the
possibility of making your own method.

Hope that helps,

          <div class="email-content">The edges step totally ignores the corners. The corners step, however,
leaves the edges &quot;untouched.&quot; The edges move around during the moves
to solve the corners, of course, but at the end they are restored to
the exact same position, so if the edges are solved before doing the
corners step, they will again be solved at the end of the corners
step. Note that corners can always be solved with no more than 14
quarter turns if the edges are ignored.

For the cube positions where this &quot;edges first, then corners&quot; strategy
does not guarantee a solution in 38 quarter turns or less, I used a
program I wrote in C++ which looks for a solution in two phases, where
the goal of the first phase is to get the cube into a position within
the Rubik&#x27;s cube subgroup denoted by &lt;U, D, F2, B2, R2, L2> (or
symmetrical variations of that subgroup). To solve millions of
positions, the solver needed to be very fast, but didn&#x27;t need to
produce particularly good solutions. So it only considered optimal
solutions of each of the two separate phases. (In fact, it doesn&#x27;t
really use necessarily optimal solutions of the 2nd phase because of
the way the lookup table for the 2nd phase is generated.)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Not to sound cruel, but how does one know that any choice one has to 
make in life is &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;the best&quot;? This goes for choosing 
education, choosing friends, job, house, car and so on ... ;-) Those 
are some of the big choices in life and one might be able to choose 
only once ... Luckily with cubing one can ditch a choice and make 
another one. It will just take a little longer to get where one wants 
to go :-)

Have fun!

When i first saw the title i thought there was really some competition
going to be held in chennai and i was instanly thinking about my
travelling mode and all :)

Anyways, good to know that you finally met Ron, ofcourse hes a great
guy as i myself came to know after meeting him personally. But sadly
there are no immediate plans for him coming to India again. Hey ron
why dont you just say that the audit u did was a little &quot;out-of-date&quot;
and keep coming here each month :) hehe

Anyways keep cubing and congrats Bernett for ur great times!

My disappointment for not being allowed to usa to compete in wc-2005 in Orlando was very well compensated by the super mini world cup-2005 with Ron uncle last week end.

          <div class="email-content">that&#x27;s interesting--I have never noticed that code on the corner 
before.  I glanced at a couple of my current cubes, and didn&#x27;t see 
it on any of them.  Did I just miss it, i.e. is that code on all 
cubes, or is that just something added recently?  Anyone know if it 
is indeed a date stamp?  seems logical...

As for my Restoration Hardware cubes, all three I picked up read 
M1005B.  Does yours have a B at the end?  Is yours breaking in 
well?  

I still think this is as good of a new cube out of the box as I&#x27;ve 
bought [I probably have about 10, so I&#x27;m by no means an expert], but 
that coupled with the ease of trying out multiple cubes and the cool 
retro logo makes this a decent option imo for anyone who needs to 
pick up a new cube and can get to one of their stores.

I didn&#x27;t know to look for this code so have no idea if the ones I 
rejected had different codes.  

Also, I noticed the code was on different colored corners for each 
cube [another variability in a mass production process that I 
wouldn&#x27;t have expected--I&#x27;m the type who would always make sure it 
was on the same color sticker, and I suspect that&#x27;s a relativley 
common trait among cubers, but apparently not among cube 
manufacturers.  obviously, it makes no difference in performance 
where it is, just seems a little off to me...]

Kirk

          <div class="email-content">Hey Eric, 

I wouldn&#x27;t spend too much time worrying about this decision.  All of 
the methods Jason mentioned are simply excellent, each with unique 
pros and cons, but each capable of producing very fast cubers.  More 
importantly, even if you spend a lot of effort learning one method 
and then switch to another, that effort on the first method is 
definitely not wasted.  Just training your fingers to move fast will 
also help you no matter which method you ultimately end up with.  
There&#x27;s also a lot of overlap, and knowing more than one method can 
help your cubing, and once you know one method, picking up others is 
not so hard--similar to how if you know one of the romance 
languages, learing a second or third is easier than learning the 
first.  

If there is someone you know that uses a particular method, that may 
be enough to tilt the scales in favor of that method.  While it&#x27;s 
possible with all the info on the Internet to try to pick this all 
up on your own, for me at least, actually getting together with 
other cubers has helped tremendously.  

just my 2 cents&#x27;
best of luck!

I heard about Oliver&#x27;s 6 and tried it myself, all I can get is 5, too. 
Somehow I think Oliver and the people watching him all counted wrong :
-)

Did you see him do it? Did he do some weird behind-the-back stuff? 
Were there some rules? For myself, I made up this: Hold the cube with 
two fingers of each hand on opposite sides. I use thumb and middle 
finger.

Overall it&#x27;s independent, i.e. the order doesn&#x27;t change your 
chance/number of skips. Maybe it would be better to write it like 
this:

Orient edges: 1/8
Orient corners: 1/27
Permute first of {corners,edges}: 1/6
Permute second of {corners,edges}: 1/12

Where I really disagree is only the 41%. That&#x27;s what you get just 
adding the separate probabilities, which is wrong. The correct 
probability to skip a step (at least one) is about 35.6%.

Similarly to the &quot;no inspection&quot; records I fear that some might always 
start with certain cube orientations (e.g. scrambler puts white center 
always on bottom) while others don&#x27;t. Would be good (in both 
categories) to have a rule so that everybody does the same.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, mine says M1005B also.  And it&#x27;s breaking in well.  I left it 
unlubed for the first two weeks then sprayed it with silicon.  It 
still turns very evenly.

As for the codes, I think they started after the OddzOn cubes.  It&#x27;s 
a great feature.  I&#x27;m almost certain that the first two numbers 
indicate the month, and the second two indicate the year.  All the 
cubes I&#x27;ve bought in the past few years have consistently adhered to 
that scheme.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan :-)

When Joel, Lars, Matt (Walter) and Ron tried the marathon after the 
World Championships the scrambler(s) tried as best as they could to 
put the cubes so that the cuber could see an easy cross. This is of 
course a bit subjective but i guess it gives the cuber more 
confidence to not get a cube where u have to search for a cross. As 
i know there are no official rules for the marathon, of course 
except that there is really no inspection time for each cube and u 
have to really solve 42 cubes with no pauses ...

Cheers!

Yes, you&#x27;re right. Actually it&#x27;s of course the same, just 
holding/rotating the cube differently. I actually do something in the 
&quot;middle&quot; I think.

I&#x27;ve included this remark on my page now. I also fixed two mistakes in 
algorithms, made the page look a bit better, and added Pedro&#x27;s issue 
and another suggestion how to hold your arms.

Right. To be honest, I also use that in the middle of the solve. When 
the intervening shot would have to go to L or R, I&#x27;d have to rotate 
the cube first, so instead I solve the diagonal pair like you said. 
It&#x27;s also good because it doesn&#x27;t require any &#x27;setup&#x27; move, you can 
use one of those two algs right away (this is something I only thought 
about right now). I&#x27;ll add this to my page, too.

I think both need about the same number of moves, around 30. I&#x27;m 
usually a bit over 30 but when I explained my method to Ron he soon 
told me he averages about 28-29 I think. Since I don&#x27;t use that 
&#x27;usual&#x27; approach, I don&#x27;t exactly know the number of moves it 
requires, but I think it&#x27;s about 30 as well.

Thanks for the feedback and suggestions :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes, it&#x27;s basically the same, except that the &quot;stuck&quot; corner and its 
adjacent pieces including the core are a single piece. Look here for a

Mmh... makes me think about people who claim the 25th anni cubes are

Sure, people do this to get Master Magics for less than $10 instead of
more than 40.

I don&#x27;t think so, but even if you could, would you want that?  I think
the string would be more prone to breaking again, and the size may not
be the same (ie - too loose or too tight, depending on how you
reconnected it), so it would be more likely to snap again or to get
tangled.  I would say this is definitely not a good idea, even if it
is possible.

Well, I have an original 1982 ideal 4x4, and a Rubiks.com 4x4, and I<br>
think I got REALLY lucky with my 4x4. My Rubiks.com 4x4 almost turns<br>
better than my 3x3 assembly cube with plently of lube. My 1982 4x4 is<br>
teh suxors though. It&#x27;s SOOO loud. <br>

I think it&#x27;s about time we had a massive resource of anything you need<br>

Otherwise....<br>

different kinds of cubing. Don&#x27;t see something there? Write a request<br>
and someone will write a page about something. Just think, all the<br>
cubing minds in teh world together in one place contributing<br>
infomation, I hope this to because the number one source of infomation.<br>

The best thing about this is, it&#x27;s less work for me. I wan&#x27;t gonna
bother putting my megaminx last layer method up, but now it&#x27;s easy of
course I&#x27;m going to, it&#x27;s so easy to pick a new title and hit edit

uploading it.

Yeah, have fun.

Oh, I hope this&#x27;ll motivate Per to create a page on his cage method

          <div class="email-content">Hi! A new cuber in the UK here. I used to play with the cube in the<br>
80&#x27;s when I was little(I used a really simple beginner layer method, I<br>
think) and recently after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in the office<br>
had got hooked again and bought a new cube in August.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of the people here&#x27;s web pages and they have<br>
all been a great help (esp. Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s, Dan Harris&#x27;, Joel Van<br>
Noort, Chris Hardwick&#x27;s). So thanks to everyone for making some great<br>
webpages. I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting better at doing<br>
F2L  (it&#x27;s taking a long time to be able to make fast decisions<br>
though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F PLL algorithms (and<br>
have forgotten the A one!). I guess I&#x27;m going to try to learn all the<br>
PLL ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is that the general approach<br>
to learning Fridrich? Since I learnt those PLL&#x27;s I have found it<br>
possible to solve the cube in around 50 seconds whereas before it was<br>
around 1 minute 30 or something like that if I went flat out. Still<br>
pretty slow compared to everyone here.<br>
<br>
Still, I had a go with Chris H&#x27;s &#x27;oh wow&#x27; scramble and was shocked<br>
when using my method after a few tries I solved it in 31 seconds.<br>
Well, That was a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :)<br>
<br>
I have two cubes, one I bought from a department store in August with<br>
bright stickers on (which deteriorated really rapidly )- probably the<br>
generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik&#x27;s 3 x 3 DIY cube with PVC<br>
stickers which I prefer. The DIY one seems to be easier to control<br>
turns on and more suitable for doing fast solves (although it&#x27;s<br>
noisier according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has M0105B written on<br>
one of the corners.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any opinions of the new anniversary cube? Is it the<br>
same as the normal 3 x 3 but with a different centre white sticker? Is<br>
it at all suitable for speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or polypropelene?<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s it for now.<br>
<br>
Cheers, Matt<br>

Click on one of the red links and press edit to create the article for
that page.

If it&#x27;s not a red link, search for the page, and it&#x27;ll say no page
with &#x27;that exact title&#x27; is avaliable. &#x27;that exact title&#x27; acts as a red
link and you can go from there to add the page.

There&#x27;s a way to do it in your user profile aswell, but this way is
easyer.

Or... you can do this

          <div class="email-content">I noticed there are different versions of the 25th anniversary cube. <br>
I picked one up at Walmart yesterday and it was garbage.  Very loose<br>
and sloppy feeling.  It was in a clear plastic &quot;clamshell&quot; style<br>
packaging.<br>
<br>
I just ordered one from here: <br>
http://store.yahoo.com/seriouspuzzles/rubiks25th.html<br>
which has a differnet packaging and hopefully it&#x27;s from a different<br>
manufacturer.  Target ($6.99) is carrying the same version as Walmart.<br>
 Is there a current list of who has good cubes and what to look for?<br>

after Oliver demonstrated how many times he could twist his arm with
his palm on the table.  We suggested he try turning the cube without
releasing it.  He started with his arms wrapped around each other and
his fingers reaching as far around the cube as possible.  I don&#x27;t
remember the exact turn count, but I remember it was a lot. :)

  I have taught some of my friends here to cube and hope you too would have done so. Let us popularise this sport in India.
   
  Yes, I learnt some tips from Ron uncle and got some more ideas to improve myself. Having learnt PLL pairity in 4*4*4 my best time today is 1 min 26.42 sec and the avg of 10 is 1 min 41.86 sec.
   
  I am greatly benefitted after learning the tips to solve plus in 3*3. 
   
  Finally, it was expensive for both Ron uncle and for my dad to make our meeting for 2 days. 
  Hope to see you soon Mr.Sachin

Anyways, good to know that you finally met Ron, ofcourse hes a great
guy as i myself came to know after meeting him personally. But sadly
there are no immediate plans for him coming to India again. Hey ron
why dont you just say that the audit u did was a little &quot;out-of-date&quot;
and keep coming here each month :) hehe

Anyways keep cubing and congrats Bernett for ur great times!

My disappointment for not being allowed to usa to compete in wc-2005 in Orlando was very well compensated by the super mini world cup-2005 with Ron uncle last week end. What a wonderful gesture from him to compete with this little boy travelling a long way!!

Yeah, I at least somewhat know what you mean. I made up this rule for 
myself to not spend too much time here, especially not late at night. 
The rule is to only come here before noon. But the last two weeks I 
didn&#x27;t wake up before noon. Today I did, and I violated the rule cause 
I&#x27;ve been processing the latest 500 or so messages most of the last 10 
hours :-)

Great to hear that! Without competition it feels lonely :-). So I hope

So far I only start with white or yellow. Otherwise I get confused 
with the order of the four adjacent colors in step 2. I&#x27;d probably 
build white or yellow and try to preserve a pair of those other three 
for step 2.

Bah, that&#x27;s so wrong.

How about I tell the scrambler when I begin PLL, and he tells me the 
first few moves for next cube? There should be no help at all, the 
cubes should be as random as possible.

But if the majority or the deciders decide that it should be allowed, 
I will accept it even though I don&#x27;t like it. But it should be made 
clear that it&#x27;s allowed, so that everybody knows and a meaningful 
comparison is possible.

Cheers!

That probably won&#x27;t save you much, though. Unless your method uses 
lots of slice turns in which case you would be more aware of STM :-)

How long ago was that previous 100 cube average? Could it be you or

Ever tried the opposite? I&#x27;ve been told that as a kid when we were on

          <div class="email-content">Hi

I created a new version of Jess Bonde&#x27;s ultimate timer even though I 
know he promised to rip my head off...

No, in fact I did ask him to create a version that would contain an 
applet to immediately be able to check the scramble on your cube, 
but he said the code was so ugly he&#x27;d probably die from the mere 
shock of looking at it.

I took my chances anyway, and it was only a couple of lines to be 
added.

If you want to change the color scheme then you can search for it in 
the source code and do so, it&#x27;s in one place only (hint: search 
for &quot;&lt;applet&quot;).

You can download it from the files section, or use it online here:
http://vanderblonk.com/cube/timer.htm

Make sure you put the rubikplayer.jar from www.randelshofer.ch in 
the same directory as the file, and Ron&#x27;s your uncle!

          <div class="email-content">see the posts about the cubes at restoration hardware.  I know $12 
may be a couple of bucks more than the cubes at wal-mart, but being 
able to try them all out makes it worth it [plus I like the retro 
logo].  

I&#x27;ve heard of people opening up and trying out cubes at the other 
stores or buying 5 and returning 4, but I don&#x27;t know how those 
retailers react to that--if they&#x27;ll let you do it, great.  As you&#x27;ve 
discovered, there is a wide range of initial quality on cubes.  You 
could try to return and exchange it and see if they let you.  

If not, don&#x27;t give up on the cube.  If it&#x27;s too tight, take it apart 
and wedge a credit card or two bewteen the center edges for a day or 
two to loosen up the tension in the springs.  Silicon spray can 
really help.  And even the stiffest cubes will wear in over time and 
heavy use.  

other options include the DIY cubes from rubiks.com where you can 
adjust the tension of the center springs, and I&#x27;ve heard some people 
prepare speedcubes and sell them on eBay.

good luck!

Does someone know where this advice comes from? The current rubiks.com 
cubes and equivalents have screws with large heads. These limit how 
far you can pull out a center. The limit is *not* defined by a fully 
compressed spring, like it is for the Studio cube and equivalent (i.e. 
most old Ideal). In the new cubes you can&#x27;t fully compress springs 
because the screw head blocks earlier. I know you can shorten a spring 
by fully compressing it for a while, but I doubt it has any effect if 
you don&#x27;t get at least quite near to full compression. Does anybody 
have proof this works for current rubiks.com cubes? I believe it for 
Studio cubes but I have doubts about rubiks.com ones...

Cheers!
Stefan

haven&#x27;t done it in a long time, but I recall getting some 
improvement in how tight the cube turned, but at the same time I was

maybe that part was just a sugar pill.

But if Stefan says it doesn&#x27;t work, then I&#x27;d defer to him--he&#x27;s
