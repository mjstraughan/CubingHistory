        This has been giving me great enjoyment all weekend! I dusted off my
        java skills and have been pounding away at the problems. Now that I'm
        back into the groove of programming in java, they are falling much more
        quickly. Problem 12 is giving me serious fits though. I can't seem to
        find a quick way to find the number of divisors of a VERY large
        number...if you guys have any tips ;) Thanks again to the original
        poster of this! It's a freaking blast. -Daniel PS- I just remembered I
        have to do the Sunday contest! You all should too.

        So, i think im the only one who solves a 4x4 this way but for some
        reason i keep getting this corner parity error on the last layer where
        two corners have switched positions. I solve a 4x4 by first solving the
        centers, then joining edge pieces up, then solving the 3x3. I think that
        it may just be how i solve the final 3x3 but i was wondering if anyone

        so i've messed with it for about a week and i can always get everything

        finally gave up and started looking for sequences online but notation
        doesn't seem to be consistent among sites. can anyone give me a site

        (like 2,0 is that 2 lines over or what) i understand the simple 1,0 0,-1

        Hello, The notation (1;0) can be translated into (30¬∞, 0¬∞) The first
        number is for the upper layer, the second is for the bottom layer. So,
        for example : (6, 4) = (180¬∞ (=U2) ; 120¬∞ ) Between two sequences, you
        have to turn the right part of the cube (usually writed / ). It's
        important that usually, thse scrambling/solving sequences are usable
        only if the "seperation line of the midle layer" is on the left. I hope
        this is intelligible, because it's very important. Good luck ;-)

        I had to laugh about your comment on the size of the trophies you got.
        That reminds me a lot of when I came back from Amsterdam after the
        European Championships. The trophy I got back then was huge. We didn't
        have a bag or case that was big enough and we had to walk a fair
        distance with our lugage to get to the station and change trains 4 times
        so I couldn't just hold it in my hands all the time. In the end I
        managed to stuff it in one of our bags but it was still hanging out. It
        was also quite a heavy trophy. If you look closely at some of the EC
        pictures, you'll notice (from my facial expressions) that I was having
        big difficulties keeping it up in the air while people were taking
        photographs. Those are the things you have to take into your stride when
        you're the champion ;) --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        thanks for your response, gilles. i understand the 1's and 4's, is a 2
        basically moving from one side of a corner to another? and what is a 5.
        i'm holding it with the square one text on the left side. so would -2,0
        be moveing the other side of the corner the flip line? are there any
        applets that demonstrate these moves? the specific one i'm looking at
        fixes a z type permutation in the top layer and the notation is:
        /(3,3)/(0,3)/(1,1)/(-1,-4)/(-3,-3)/ so does this one make it not square
        then shift it back or what? and then this one that swaps fu and fd edges
        (0,-3)/(0,3)/(1,0)/(2,-2)/(4,0)/(4,0)/(-4,4)/(0,1)/(0,3)/(-3,-1)/(1,-2)/(-1,0)
        i don't get the 2's in this one. if anyone could make a slow video of
        these 2 algs, i would be eternally greatful. i like this puzzle, but it
        might not make it through the day if i don't get this notation down. :)

        &gt; &gt; The notation (1;0) can be translated into (30√Ø¬ø¬Ω, 0√Ø¬ø¬Ω) &gt;
        The first number is for the upper layer, the second &gt; is for the
        bottom layer. &gt; &gt; So, for example : (6, 4) = (180√Ø¬ø¬Ω (=U2) ;
        120√Ø¬ø¬Ω ) &gt; &gt; Between two sequences, you have to turn the right

        usually, thse scrambling/solving &gt; sequences are &gt; usable only if
        the "seperation line of the midle &gt; layer" is on the &gt; left. I
        hope this is intelligible, because it's very &gt; important. &gt; &gt;

        &lt;perscription_death@...&gt;: &gt; &gt; so i've messed with it for
        about a week and i can &gt; &gt; always get everything to where it needs

        are &gt; &gt; permuted and oriented, edges are in the correct &gt;
        layer) &gt; &gt; i finally gave up and started looking for &gt;
        sequences &gt; &gt; online but notation doesn't seem to be consistent
        &gt; &gt; among sites. can anyone give me a site with &gt; &gt;
        definative notation instructions or explain to me &gt; what &gt; &gt; is
        what (like 2,0 is that 2 lines over or what) i &gt; &gt; understand the
        simple 1,0 0,-1 and such, but the &gt; even &gt; &gt; numbers i don't
        get and the 5's confuse me, so all &gt; in &gt; &gt; all i'm a big mess.
        i'm looking at jaap's site on &gt; the &gt; &gt; part where you move

        Hi, Just a general ramble. I just came back from a week on holiday in
        Greece where I set myself the target of trying blindfold solving again
        after a break of about 22 years! I had a look at Bill McGaugh's site
        before I went (http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/) and then sat down
        on the 3 1/2 hour flight to think my way through it - trying out little
        bits of the method. On the subsequent days I had spare time here and
        there while wife and kids were doing other things and altogether I've
        attempted about 10 solves with about 50% success. When its wrong its
        usually a 3-cycle or so because I just can't quite always remember the
        right edge permutations. I now see how the blindfold times are so fast -
        which isn't to say I don't think they are very impressive! I was there
        at the first blindfold world record of about 20 minutes in 1982 (I
        think!) and I remember the effort that John White the solver had to put
        into it. The new methods make it almost easy (almost but not quite!). My
        times are generally around ten minutes with this method and could
        clearly be faster with practice and confidence. Anyway fantastic method
        and well thought out. Anyone got any way to improve my ageing memory of
        edge permutations I'd be glad to take their advice! Good luck to all
        blindfold solvers at the WC. Duncan

        Hey, folks! I came up with something similar to this question a while
        ago, but I have another doubt... I was wondering about the PLL
        probabilities. One way I've found to know it was: check the number of
        probabilities for each case and make the % of the total. So, for
        example, the U perm have 8 possible cases: -each of the 4 colors can be
        the correct side and we have clockwise and counter-clockwise direction,
        so 4x2=8 for the A is the same thing...and etc I got 73 cases in total,
        but I think something is wrong, cause my % do not match with the
        probabilities on Fridrich's site... here's what I got: % U - 8 10.96 A -
        8 10.96 Z - 2 2.74 H - 1 1.37 E - 2 2.74 T - 4 5.48 V - 4 5.48 F - 4

        Your mistake is in the N-perm. Each of the N-perm cases has probability
        1/72 (it is the same situation even when you rotate), so N should be 2

        &gt; I got 73 cases in total, but I think something is wrong, cause my %
        &gt; do not match with the probabilities on Fridrich's site... &gt; &gt;
        here's what I got: &gt; &gt; % &gt; U - 8 10.96 &gt; A - 8 10.96 &gt; Z
        - 2 2.74 &gt; H - 1 1.37 &gt; E - 2 2.74 &gt; T - 4 5.48 &gt; V - 4 5.48
        &gt; F - 4 5.48 &gt; R - 8 10.96 &gt; J - 8 10.96 &gt; Y - 4 5.48 &gt; G
        - 16 21.92 &gt; N - 4 5.48 &gt; &gt; Total - 73 100.00 &gt; &gt; So,
        where I'm wrong? Anyone knows? &gt; &gt; Pedro &gt; SPONSORED LINKS

        Hi Duncan, Thanks for studying my method, and congratulations for
        succeeding with it As far as edge permutations, as I described on the
        web page, I identify the edges as letters and make a sentence or two,
        using the edge letters as the first letters of words. I also sometimes
        put 3 letters together into a word. Other people just memorize
        everything as numbers. I think the more advanced solvers just remember
        the path with pure spatial visualization. I think it depends on your
        particular mental strengths. Sometimes I do 6 or 7 edges with a
        sentence...and then just visualize the rest. As with everything, its all
        about practice. I find remembering the edge perms many times easier than
        I did a few months ago. I have a few common themes that I use to
        construct sentences..a library of possible words... and the construction
        of a meaningful sentence is quick and easy...and I am 56 years old. I
        may write up the more advanced (3-cycle) extension of my method
        soon...world class times should be very possible with the advanced
        method (for people who can perform all the algs as fast fingertricks). I
        think, in the near future, I will be able to average 1-2 minutes for
        memorization and 2-4 for execution with the improved method...and I have
        very slow hand technique. Bill ----- Original Message ----- From: Duncan

        Blindfold solving Hi, Just a general ramble. I just came back from a
        week on holiday in Greece where I set myself the target of trying
        blindfold solving again after a break of about 22 years! I had a look at
        Bill McGaugh's site before I went (http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/)
        and then sat down on the 3 1/2 hour flight to think my way through it -
        trying out little bits of the method. On the subsequent days I had spare
        time here and there while wife and kids were doing other things and
        altogether I've attempted about 10 solves with about 50% success. When
        its wrong its usually a 3-cycle or so because I just can't quite always
        remember the right edge permutations. I now see how the blindfold times
        are so fast - which isn't to say I don't think they are very impressive!
        I was there at the first blindfold world record of about 20 minutes in
        1982 (I think!) and I remember the effort that John White the solver had
        to put into it. The new methods make it almost easy (almost but not
        quite!). My times are generally around ten minutes with this method and
        could clearly be faster with practice and confidence Anyway fantastic
        method and well thought out. Anyone got any way to improve my ageing
        memory of edge permutations I'd be glad to take their advice! Good luck
        to all blindfold solvers at the WC. Duncan ------------------------

        I'm at 229 points with 24 solved so far. Still haven't gotten stoopid
        number 12 though. But I did make a slightly more efficient brute force
        alg. I've tested the first 10400 triangle numbers with the highest that

        Fantastic method? If you use two cycles for permuting the edges, why not
        solve orientation and permutation of edges at the very same time? :) But

        Got it with my slightly more efficient algorithm. The fact that I was
        running it on my ti-89 during class probably didn't help the speed, but
        it got from the 10400th triangle number to the answer in about 10
        minutes. I'll have to port it to java to see how fast it does it there.
        Instead of checking all numbers between 1 and n/2 to see how many
        divisors n has, I now do this: if n = P1^n1 * P2^n2 * ... * Pr^nr with
        Pi prime and for all i=1,...,r , and ni integers. Then the number of
        divisors = (n1+1)*(n2+1)*...*(nr+1) Worked quite a bit better :) -Daniel

        Practicing blindfold in airplane is the best way to pass time. A week
        ago I did Blindfold solve for more than 25 times in a 7 hours journey
        time. Seeing me practicing very seriously, the airhostess gifted me a
        gift bag consisting of a blindfold, a pair of woolen socks, ear plugs
        and few more cosmetics. Never miss the chance to pick one on your way to
        Orlando. John Louis Jo√´l van Noort &lt;joel_vn@...&gt; wrote: Fantastic

        of about 22 years! I &gt; had a look at Bill McGaugh's site before I
        went &gt; (http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/) and then sat down on
        the 3 1/2 hour &gt; flight to think my way through it - trying out
        little bits of the method. &gt; On the subsequent days I had spare time
        here and there while wife and kids &gt; were doing other things and
        altogether I've attempted about 10 solves with &gt; about 50% success.
        When its wrong its usually a 3-cycle or so because I &gt; just can't
        quite always remember the right edge permutations. &gt; I now see how
        the blindfold times are so fast - which isn't to say I don't &gt; think
        they are very impressive! I was there at the first blindfold world &gt;
        record of about 20 minutes in 1982 (I think!) and I remember the effort
        that &gt; John White the solver had to put into it. The new methods make
        it almost &gt; easy (almost but not quite!). My times are generally
        around ten minutes &gt; with this method and could clearly be faster
        with practice and confidence. &gt; Anyway fantastic method and well
        thought out. &gt; &gt; Anyone got any way to improve my ageing memory of
        edge permutations I'd be &gt; glad to take their advice! &gt; &gt; Good

        Hi all! First my congratulations to Joel! I was there in Eindhoven too.
        I was working for 999-games, but in my short break i noticed the rubic-
        cube stand. I'm very ashamed I didn't know of the Dutch Championships
        before, but I liked to participated. My first time was a new pesonal
        record, 1 minute, 45 seconds. At the two next times i made a mistake at
        the beginning, that was very afwul but anyway, was the first time for me
        to compete with cubing! And I liked it! Oh, and the first time I saw
        Joel, while he is living 10 minutes walking from here... Oh, and there
        was said that I was the 3rd best of the females! Is that a good thing?
        :S Well, good luck to you all who are going to do the World
        Championships, and Joel, I will visit you sometime :) greets Rinie PS.
        I'm sorry for my worse english, that's also the reason I don;t visit

        OK so this is what we were doing 20 odd years ago: We wouldn't memorize
        the state of the cube - but the moves required to put each piece back in
        place. If a move chosen moved other pieces around we would have to
        remember where they moved to and build that into the calculations. That
        is much, much harder than memorizing the orientation and permutation of
        edges and corners and then having a couple of standard algorithms. I
        think 20 minutes blindfold using that approach is probably a very good
        time! So when I say fantastic method I mean in comparison. Its the
        structure of the method that I like and I agree that with practice doing
        3-cycles, orienting and permuting at the same time and other tricks will
        definitely be within my scope. At the moment it feels like a lot to hold
        in my head at one time! Thanks Bill and Matt for tips on edge
        memorizing. I tried using the "Major" memorization method while I was on
        holiday for the edge cycles - so far as I know this is one of the
        techniques top memory guys use for number memorization but in principle
        very similar to what you are suggesting. I need more practice! For edge
        orientation I remember 3 binary numbers. For corner orientation I create
        a sentence based on a (anticlockwise), b (blank i.e. no twist required)
        and c (clockwise) e.g.All Children Buy Cherries And Chew Constantly
        Choking. For corner permutation I usually have no problem remembering
        spatially. But I usually memorise the numbers as a double check which is
        one way having extra confidence will considerably reduce my times. I've
        tried a few things for edges - the Major method, spatial memory, strings
        of numbers. I get it right about half the time but I'm hopefully still
        at a point on the learning curve where it will improve quickly. Thanks
        for you comments. Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From: "Jo√Ø¬ø¬Ωl van

        Yes, that's correct, but keep in mind that they get numbers as input!
        They don't memorize them as numbers, instead they translate them to
        mental images using the major method. It's because numbers are too
        abstract. I guess I'll never really understand why any blindcuber would
        want to translate a cubie to a number, then the number to a mental
        image, instead of simply translating the cubie to a mental image
        directly, which looks safer and faster to me. Cheers! Stefan

        it's not really self-correcting of course. But I can get the worst l/L

        right before being solved). Confusing single and double layer twists was
        one of the larger reasons I had trouble learning this alg. I think I

        &gt; &gt; Ron Hi Ron, I can easily see Ton showing off his 1978 cube
        since cubes from that year are very rare. Ton's cube rates highly among
        other cubes because 1978 was the first year of manufacture. Most of
        those other cubes of his were made after the name "Rubik's Cube" was
        coined. Let me tell you about my 1978 cube. In 1978 Bela Szalai, the
        owner of Logical Games Inc, discovered the cube while visiting Hungary.
        One of the cubes that he took home with him (to the USA) he sent to a
        professional game analyst, Sid Sackson, to check it over and estimate
        whether it would be successful. I now have this cube. After the cube got
        the OK, Mr. Szalai got more cubes from Hungary and began selling them,
        and later he began making them. The cubes he made were marketed first in
        1979. It wasn't until the next year, 1980, that Ideal began making them
        and named them "Rubik's Cube." Before that they were called "Magic Cube"
        and "Charm Cube." Anyway, my 1978 cube was one of the first cubes in the
        USA. Because of the stickers and the paperwork, you can tell that it's
        from an earlier batch than Ton's 1978. As you might expect it's #1 in my

        So i was told to use the orientation correction algorithm that i use for
        a 4x4 to correct the parity error inside of the last center of the super

        My blindfold times have been quite poor lately so I've been trying to
        practice a lot. I didn't get much practicing done in the last few weeks
        unfortunately. I think, though, after about 8 solves, my blindfold
        ability starts to decline as the mind gets tired... but that's just me.

        I set &gt; myself the &gt;&gt; target of trying blindfold solving again
        after a break of about 22 &gt; years! I &gt;&gt; had a look at Bill
        McGaugh's site before I went &gt;&gt;
        (http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/) and then sat down on the 3 &gt;
        1/2 hour &gt;&gt; flight to think my way through it - trying out little
        bits of the &gt; method. &gt;&gt; On the subsequent days I had spare
        time here and there while wife &gt; and kids &gt;&gt; were doing other
        things and altogether I've attempted about 10 &gt; solves with &gt;&gt;
        about 50% success. When its wrong its usually a 3-cycle or so &gt;
        because I &gt;&gt; just can't quite always remember the right edge
        permutations. &gt;&gt; I now see how the blindfold times are so fast -
        which isn't to say &gt; I don't &gt;&gt; think they are very impressive!
        I was there at the first &gt; blindfold world &gt;&gt; record of about
        20 minutes in 1982 (I think!) and I remember the &gt; effort that
        &gt;&gt; John White the solver had to put into it. The new methods make
        it &gt; almost &gt;&gt; easy (almost but not quite!). My times are
        generally around ten &gt; minutes &gt;&gt; with this method and could
        clearly be faster with practice and &gt; confidence. &gt;&gt; Anyway
        fantastic method and well thought out. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyone got any
        way to improve my ageing memory of edge &gt; permutations I'd be
        &gt;&gt; glad to take their advice! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Good luck to all
        blindfold solvers at the WC. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Duncan &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi Jeff, I think my method for solving the 3x3x3 cube is exactly the
        same as most people out there. Uh, just 3-cycles. I orient the corners,
        orient the edges, permute the corners, permute the edges. I use the same
        method as Macky and Leyan. I don't really do anything advanced like Dave
        Orser or anything special. I have a very limited set of algorithms. My
        fast times are due to my memorization time which I can sometimes do
        under 40 seconds and also the smoothness of executing the algorithms. If
        the memorization is solid, then I don't ever have to sit and "think"
        about what the next set of moves are. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        Hey John, For me this alg is by far the fastest super5x5 parity fix.
        Look at the "+" edges in relation to the centralmost centerpiece. If
        those edges are in an odd permutation you have parity. So you can solve
        parity before you even think about starting to solve edges. The algs is
        (R'r' U2)x4 R'r' It messes up edges a bit and it switches centers as
        (blU &lt;-&gt; frU) (flU &lt;-&gt; brU) (lsU &lt;-&gt; rsU) Plus it is
        very fast to execute. Hope that helps. Chris

        thanks. I do end up with some orientation parities at the end of solving
        a 4x4 but in trying to see what other people did to solve them, i was
        never quite able to find a solution to my corner error. I do almost
        always have to execute a dedge flip (gotten off of your website stefan
        because my algorithm was ridiculously long) Only that corner error
        seemed to be the one thing that no one else returned. that's why i
        figured i must be doing something different. ~John~

        are both that I found to work now: &gt; &gt; l' U' L' U R U' l U R' U' L
        U R U' l' U &gt; l' U' L' U R U' L U R' U' L U R U' L' U &gt; &gt; Ok,
        so it's not really self-correcting of course. But I can get the &gt;
        worst l/L wrong and fix it easily at the end (where it's obvious cause
        &gt; the cube is right before being solved). Confusing single and double
        &gt; layer twists was one of the larger reasons I had trouble learning
        this &gt; alg. I think I posted the first version back then. So if you
        didn't &gt; like that one, try the second one now... &gt; &gt; Cheers!
        &gt; Stefan &gt; So you have that the commutator [U R' U' L U R U',Ll']
        is the identity.

      <div class="email-content">
        Columnar F(n-1)L for really big cubes. For anyone who might have any
        interest, here is a brief description of the technique I used to solve
        the 20x20x20 Gabbasoft Supercube. I have uploaded a series of
        representative screenshots to the photos section so you can also see how
        the solution comes together (folder name: "20x20 Supercube"). The
        technique can be applied to both regular cubes and supercubes and can be
        used on even or odd cubes of any size. I include in [brackets] the
        readings of the move counter and clock at the end of each stage. To
        spare you the suspense the whole solve required just over 9,500 moves
        and took just under 12 hours. N.B.: for this solve I kept White on
        BOTTOM and Yellow on UP, thus Red, Blue, Green, and Orange are sometimes
        referred to as 'middle' faces. Step 1: solve white centers on bottom
        (black arrows) [move counter: 1255, timer: 50min, 27 sec] Step 2: set up
        white corners together with middle edges (orange/blue, red/blue,
        orange/green, red/green) [move counter: 1476, timer: 1hr, 15 min, 16
        sec] Step 3: solve an entire column of centers along with the white edge
        piece. With just a little practice and forethought this can be done
        intuitively. Repeat this step as often as necessary until three of the
        four middle sides are complete. To make piece recognition a little
        easier for a cube as large as the 20x20x20 I started with the outermost
        columns and worked my way towards the middle. For the 20x20x20 supercube
        solve this step was repeated 54 times until the red, blue, and green
        faces were all complete. [move counter: 5812, timer: 7 hrs, 27 min, 48
        sec] Step 4a: solve half the columns of the remaining F19L middle face
        (orange) intuitively. [move counter: 6413, timer: 8 hrs, 12 min, 55 sec]
        Step 4b: solve as many of the remaining (orange) centers intuitively as
        possible and then solve the remaining centers using three-cycles. [move
        counter: 7248, timer: 9 hrs, 11 min, 33 sec] F19L Complete - move to LL
        (yellow) Step 5: solve LAST LAYER CORNERS. (N.B.: on the 5x5x5 cube it
        is usually advisable to simply use OLL and PLL moves to solve both the
        corners and the middle edge of the last layer ¬ñ thus one only has the
        remaining 8 edges left to three-cycle. On the 20x20x20 this tactic will
        not work so simply solve the corners as you will using either COLL or
        OC, PC). [move counter: 7294, timer: 9 hrs, 15 min, 33 sec] Step 6:
        solve the LAST LAYER EDGES using three-cycles where possible and a pair
        swap when necessary due to parity. On the 20x20x20 supercube I started
        with the orbit adjacent to the corners and worked my way systematically
        towards the middle edge pairs. (N.B.: On a standard cube this will
        complete the solution but on a supercube we still have one more step to
        perform.) [move counter: 7857, timer: 9 hrs, 52 min, 41 sec] Step 7:
        solve the LAST LAYER CENTERS using three-cycles. Again I started with
        the outermost `circle' of centers and worked my way systematically
        towards the very center of the yellow face. [move counter: 9519, timer:
        11 hrs, 55 min, 56 sec] NOTE 1: There are many shortcuts and minor
        adaptations that can be applied to make a 5x5x5 solution faster but I
        use the steps as outlined above when solving really big cubes. NOTE 2:
        Steps 1-4a can all be performed intuitively, while steps 4b, 6, and 7
        can all be solved using very similar three-cycles. Thus the entire cube
        can be solved, regardless of its size, using just a handful of algs.
        NOTE 3: If anyone wishes to make use of these pics please feel free,
        though I would appreciate being informed. I actually have many more pics
        showing the solution in greater step-by-step detail ¬ñ 64 pics in total of
        which I only posted here just enough to hopefully make the solution path
        clear to all viewers. Again the pics are in the photos section under the
        folder title "20x20 Supercube". Enjoy solving really big (super) cubes,
        Rob

        orientations in 1 alg?? Is that posible? &gt; &gt; Pedro Yes. Using
        symmetries you can reduce corner orientation to 66 non-isomorphic
        algorithms - or less with inversions. If you use set-ups (conjugation)
        you can take that down, although you'll have to think the conjugation up
        on the fly, ensure it is correct and probably lose time on both of
        those. You can use 76 non-isomorphic algorithms (without set up moves)
        to solve the edge orientations (or, of course, 6 if you use set up
        moves). I taught Dave to blindfold cube on the chat here and I sent him
        a lot of algorithms. I'm not sure what Dave uses now and I can only
        speculate, but he learned a lot of my intermediate system and he used
        more of it than most people - in particular, he might have learned all
        the corner orientation moves from my "intermediate" system which does
        corner orientation in one algorithm and also edge orientation in one
        algorithm. I know that he had learned a lot of moves from the middle
        stages. I'd told him that I believed that this sort of time (well under
        2 minutes) was possible with that system and he learned an impressive
        amount of it. I sent him some specific permutation moves too, bespoke to
        his situation, that were in my advanced system but not my intermediate
        one but not too many of those. I guess he probably uses a lot of other
        moves too from other sources or of his own. Alternatively, I guess he
        might have switched to a completely different method like a cycle
        method. Of course, you can use one of 94,518 non-isomorphic algorithms
        to do both corner and edge orientations in one go... &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao

        Hmm...but...I was wondering...in how much time do Dave memorise? To do a
        1:30 total time, he have to memorise in like 35 seconds...or does he
        just have a fast execution? Pedro PS.:I'm a slow executer. I usually
        memorise on 1:10 or 1:20, and execute in 2:10 or 2:20...So, I'm around
        3:35-3:40 times on good solves. Is there a way to accelerate execution?

        posible? &gt; &gt; Pedro Yes. Using symmetries you can reduce corner
        orientation to 66 non-isomorphic algorithms - or less with inversions.
        If you use set-ups (conjugation) you can take that down, although you'll
        have to think the conjugation up on the fly, ensure it is correct and
        probably lose time on both of those. You can use 76 non-isomorphic
        algorithms (without set up moves) to solve the edge orientations (or, of
        course, 6 if you use set up moves). I taught Dave to blindfold cube on
        the chat here and I sent him a lot of algorithms. I'm not sure what Dave
        uses now and I can only speculate, but he learned a lot of my
        intermediate system and he used more of it than most people - in
        particular, he might have learned all the corner orientation moves from
        my "intermediate" system which does corner orientation in one algorithm
        and also edge orientation in one algorithm. I know that he had learned a
        lot of moves from the middle stages. I'd told him that I believed that
        this sort of time (well under 2 minutes) was possible with that system
        and he learned an impressive amount of it. I sent him some specific
        permutation moves too, bespoke to his situation, that were in my
        advanced system but not my intermediate one but not too many of those. I
        guess he probably uses a lot of other moves too from other sources or of
        his own. Alternatively, I guess he might have switched to a completely
        different method like a cycle method. Of course, you can use one of
        94,518 non-isomorphic algorithms to do both corner and edge orientations
        in one go... &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &lt;tmao@i...&gt; escreveu: &gt; Just

        well the next step is to assemble 2 more edges and the corner that goes
        in between it, if you've flipped your edges right this is pretty easy to
        do. once u get your corner twisted the right way, if you put it in the
        layer with nothing built in it, when its pointed one way its the color
        of one edge sticking out and the other side will bring the other color
        out. so you find one of the edges that match one of the other colors and
        move it so that you can put it into position, then move the corner
        around to the side so its not affected by the edge's positioning turn,
        move the edge into place, then bring the corner back. its always really
        hard to explain things via text, but if this doesn't help i can probably
        make you a video tonite when i get home from work. then its putting the
        last corner edge pair together and putting it in place which just takes
        some practice. then the last layer has 3 steps, position corners, orient
        corners, permute edges. each of these last layer steps can be
        accomplished with 1 algorithm for each, niklas, sune, and allan
        respectively. --- habbywall &lt;nick@...&gt; wrote: &gt; i dont really

        plate which can come loose and impede turning." ".... With new cubes,
        anticlockwise turning may cause this [the centre of the face] to

        Interesting... From what I can make out of Ton's cube in the video, it
        has red opposite white, yellow opposite orange, and blue opposite green.
        The orange and green are much brighter (paler shades) as you mention.
        This scheme was also used on Meffert's assembly cubes a few years ago,
        although the BOY-BYO are reversed from Ton's cube. Thanks for the info.

        info. If you can some day take pictures of the cube and papers it'd
        still be great. But that quote of pushing off the plate is a completely
        mean joke. This kind of center/centercap is by far the worst I've seen:
        http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/old_center.jpg The cap fits into a hole
        and it touches its sides and bottom. And what a surprise, it's glued
        rock hard. No way to get it out nicely. I have another cube which has
        the same pieces except the edges and corners don't have caps. The way I
        opened the centers was to cut through the cap with a dremel clone,
        taking out a square piece of it and replacing it with a new piece of
        polystyrol sheet. That was a lot of hard annoying work and it's not
        perfect but good enough... Cheers! Stefan

        in 12.66s. What competition are we talking about? Just wondering. &gt;
        Fran√ßois Funny... just two weeks ago Edwin contacted me about clock

        The new issue of my university newspaper has a page devoted to Rubik's
        cube: http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/aktuell/hoch3/ It's on page 12. It's
        German, though. On the left there's an article about the cube and its
        history, on the bottom is one that shows how the cube is a mathematical
        group, and the middle is about me, they interviewed me half a year ago.
        It's quite nice, no annoying errors and the author apparently put some
        thought into it and tried to really understand things (what you should
        expect from a university newspaper, I guess). He told me he had great
        fun writing it :-) Cheers! Stefan

        &gt; &gt; Hi David, &gt; &gt; thanks for the info. If you can some day

        But that quote of pushing off the plate is a completely mean joke. &gt;
        This kind of center/centercap is by far the worst I've seen: &gt; &gt;
        http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/old_center.jpg &gt; &gt; The cap fits into
        a hole and it touches its sides and bottom. And what &gt; a surprise,
        it's glued rock hard. No way to get it out nicely. I have &gt; another
        cube which has the same pieces except the edges and corners &gt; don't
        have caps. The way I opened the centers was to cut through the &gt; cap
        with a dremel clone, taking out a square piece of it and replacing &gt;
        it with a new piece of polystyrol sheet. That was a lot of hard &gt;
        annoying work and it's not perfect but good enough... &gt; &gt; Cheers!
        &gt; Stefan Hi Stefan, I don't think the first ones were glued. I
        believe that first year or so saw a lot of experimentation. Many things
        were tried, some discarded, some kept. I know the stickers went though
        changes. I think there was an earlier run than the batch my 1978 cube is
        from. Cheers, David J

        well... I don't think any of them are boring on their own, but I have
        many puzzles so I just don't have the time to play with all of them even
        though I do spend nearly all my time with cubing. So you could say some
        are less interesting for me than others. But at some point I was
        interested in each of them, otherwise I wouldn't have bought them. And I
        have solved all puzzles I'm selling, I wouldn't want to give one away
        that I can't solve yet. Also, I noticed I'm more of a solver than a
        collector, so I don't have to keep all puzzles I have. Except puzzles
        from childhood, I won't give those away because of the emotional
        connection and some memories. Other reasons are that I have many
        duplicates and I really don't need all of them, and that my room is
        filled with puzzles which is somewhat a burden and I want to get some
        free space again, and last but not least it'll help getting a positive
        bank account balance again. Cheers! Stefan

        digital scale the Monday afterwards (cause I need it for weighing postal
        packages anyway). And they differed by about 3 grams, about 132.5 versus
        135.5 grams. But... the other way around, not like Mr T. thought :-). I
        remember I thought if they differ at all I'd expect it the other one to
        be heavier cause it's filled with more silicone, otherwise they should
        be pretty much identical. Cheers! Stefan

        Hi All -- Thought I'd start a thread on any media coverage for WC2005.
        One from Sacramento, CA: Channel 58 had a short video item, mostly
        likely taken from another station, talking about a competitor going to
        the world championships who was going to be doing the cube with his
        feet. It was Chris Szlatenyi, who I see is listed in the unofficial
        world records for 3x w/feet (second in both fastest time, average).
        That's the only coverage I've seen so far. Others?? yeff

        congratulations on learning the fridrich method. What do you mean by
        finishing with fridrich? Did you learn all the OLL and PLL algos? If yes
        then thats great! Also what are your current times? I have also

        Wow, I just checked out the top 36 on rubiks.com and the top 33 all were
        under 20 seconds at least once. Looks like Bob Peters didn't go but
        there are a few new names like Matt Walter who was in the top 36. I
        guess 16.39 s is the new national record for Canada unless Matt breaks
        his own record on Sunday. Jean Pons solved all three of his cubes in
        less than 15 seconds... top 5 all under 15 seconds. Only 1st generation
        cubists I could see were Lars Petrus and Chris Pelley. Mark

        amazing. Now that he had the opportunity to train on stackmat the month
        before Orlando, I guess he might become dangerous also in competition.

        He solves 3 edges on top, then usually turns the cube upside-down while
        inserting the 4th one, and doing some [D,D',D2] in the process. I have
        the impression that he usually only needs 2 seconds to insert the 2 last
        pairs, averaging 8'' for the whole F2L, "quand il est chaud". -- FD.

        Yeah, his world record is so amazing (I watch that video over and over
        again). BTW I also do the cross on top (and switch sides when inserting
        last edge), but I'm no where near any record :-): I "only" average 50
        seconds (after 2 months) "quand je suis chaud". Sven --- In

        turns the cube &gt; upside-down while inserting the 4th one, and doing
        some &gt; [D,D',D2] in the process. &gt; I have the impression that he

        Wowowow. All kinds of worms here. 1) The competition is just plain
        STIFF. Four people missed the cutoff by less than 0.1 seconds - ouch!!!
        The two names right after that are Petrus and Knights...two of
        yesteryear's giants. 2) I must admit a bit of disappointment that
        Jessica Fridrich is not there. Besides being the world's #1 female
        cubist, she perhaps more than anyone has helped bring about this current
        revival of cubing. Ah well. 3) The top 5 should be no surprise at all.
        In fact among the top 25 there's just a couple of names I don't
        recognize (the guy from Canada and Spain). I'm expecting a full-on duel
        between Jean and Macky, but don't count the others out. 4) Bob Burton
        did better on all his 3x3 solves than on his second 2x2 solve. There
        aren't any results for the clock or magic, I would love to see those.
        Well anyways GOOD LUCK to everyone...the final showdown begins in 20
        minutes!!! --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hello all! I just wanted to say that it was an honor and a pleasure to
        meet so many of you at this year's world championship. This event has
        definitely sparked my interest in cubing again. I've never been around
        anyone physically who was faster than myself (24-30ish average) and
        seeing practically everyone there smoke me psyched me up. I'm going to
        get active in the community again as much as I can, including actually
        updating my web page and adding new content! Final Fantasy online stole
        my passion for cubing for like 1.5 years, but I've vanquished that demon
        and ready to improve my skills more. I want to thank everyone who shared
        their tips to me and once again say how cool it was meeting the folks
        I've only known online for a few years. That event was awesome! I don't
        think I'll be able to wait for the next one! ¬óNathan Christie P.S. Will
        people post their pictures/videos from the event, as I didn't get to
        take any.

        Thanks for the link! If that reporter is correct (always THE question ;P
        ) Jean Pons would be world champion.. I'm anxious to see sunday's
        results. Rubiks.com is up again so maybe they'll be up soon. Also this
        quote caught my attention: "He said the next world championships will be
        held in 2007, likely somewhere in Europe." That's exciting news for us
        Europeans... Looking forward to results, pics and videos! - Koen --- In

        Do you have any results of WC 2005 ? I can't access rubiks.com website
        &gt; &gt; right now and I'm wondering if there is another place where
        one could &gt; &gt; find the results online ... tell us at least who won

        You are correct. As soon as you touch both foil pads, the timer starts
        and then stops when you touch them again. I haven't yet had time (and
        lets be honest, the know how) to develop a logic circuit to make it
        actually work like the stackmats. I do feel that it prepared me quite
        well for the Dallas tournament though, very little adaptation from my
        method with this timer was needed to do decently at the competition.
        Basically all thats happening is that the transistor can tell when the
        circuit is completed by you touching both pads. When this happens, it
        allows more current to flow through the start/stop switch circuit.
        That's the gist anyway. I believe a young man on the group came up with

        I'm feeling very happy for Jean Pons today. He worked very hard on
        "staying focus" and "handling the pressure" after the disappointment of
        the french nationals, where he performed badly (!) compared to his
        unoffical times. This "mind"-work, his great cubing talent, and probably
        a bit of luck have helped him to win the WC, and confirm all the UWR he
        has set on www.speedcubing.com. Classy. Congrats to Edouard and Macky
        too, their performance in such a high-pressure event are also
        outstanding. I can't wait to see the vids and reports ! -- FD.

        This has happened to me as well, though not in the context of a cubing
        contest. Usually when I have to do something nervewracking, I feel
        pretty good until I actually start, at which point the nervousness just
        EXPLODES. As with you, I don't necessarily feel it in my emotions, but
        it may come out in some other way. For example, I remember one time when
        I was performing a skit in front of a crowd of 30-40 people. Emotionally
        I felt absolutely fine even during the skit, but a few minutes into it
        my stomach started cramping like crazy. It got so bad that I had to make
        a creative exit and leave my skitmates to improvise why I left. :P So in
        my experience, your emotions may be able to avoid the nervousness, but
        your body will take the hit instead. Sounds like you are similar in that
        regard? Sorry it had to be your hands :( --- In

        Definetly the best tournament I've been to so far. It was great to meet
        so many of you. The tournament ran smoothly as far as I could tell,
        though I didn't get to see any 'behind the scenes' panic that may have
        occured. Many thanks to the organizers. I'm happy with my results in all
        categories :) Except for my 2nd round (3x3) results. A 23.53 average?
        What was I doing?? And of course for 5x5 I had a monsterous pop, and
        didn't recover all the pieces. Grant and Betty were kind enough to let
        me use a spare 5x5 cube for my second attempt. I was surprised anyone
        let me borrow one after I blew 25 pieces out. I hope to get a report up
        soon. Happy cubing everyone :) -Richard

        Hey everyone, I returned to Boston from Disney World at about 11:30 a.m.
        I had a great time over the weekend seeing people I haven't seen in two
        years and meeting new people for the first time. I had fun competing
        though an outside competition isn't as good as an indoor one. On
        Wednesday morning between 8 and 10 a.m. Cory Laviglio, Chris Szlatenyi,
        and I will appear on a show on ESPN2 called Cold Pizza
        (www.coldpizza.tv). We will be on two times for about 10 seconds during
        the early part of the show. Then between 9:30 and 10 we will compete
        against each other and talk about the cube and the competition for about
        5 minutes. I will post pictures later this week when I get a chance.

        Well, that didn't work out too well. I got a couple days posted and a
        few pictures, but my cell phone sort of died on the 4th. I could still
        make calls, but I couldn't send e-mail or access the internet. Next trip
        I'll be better prepared. Bring enough software to restore my cell phone
        if it dies. Bring a phone cord and have a dialup account ready in case
        there is no broadband. On 11/3/05, david3x3x3 &lt;david20708@...&gt;

        know how) to develop a logic circuit to make it &gt; actually work like
        the stackmats. I do feel that it prepared me quite &gt; well for the
        Dallas tournament though, very little adaptation from my &gt; method
        with this timer was needed to do decently at the competition. &gt; &gt;
        Basically all thats happening is that the transistor can tell when the
        &gt; circuit is completed by you touching both pads. When this happens,
        it &gt; allows more current to flow through the start/stop switch
        circuit. &gt; That's the gist anyway. I believe a young man on the group
        came up &gt; with a very effective little timer that doesn't bother with
        these &gt; pesky transistors though... Might have a look in the archives
        for his &gt; post. &gt; &gt; -Daniel &gt; &gt; --- In

        nice =) i wonder.. maybe a reverse mechanism would work. have it in
        contact at rest position.. then pushing down would take it out of
        contact.. and releasing would trigger the contact to start it.. then
        stopping would require a quick (to avoid delays) press.. does this sound

        Hey Everyone, Indeed this was an awesome tournament. I do thank the
        organizers as it went pretty smoothly. Congrats to all the people who
        did well and broke some records- and congrats for those who even showed
        up! It was pretty awesome meeting some of the people I chat with online;
        unfortunately I didn't speak to some of you after the tournament, I had
        a plane to catch ;). Yeah I had to leave right after the 3x3 final round
        apparently, which was kind of unexpected. I had a 3x3 shirt that I
        wanted to everyone to sign, like I did wc2003. Nonetheless, I had fun
        and it was cool to meet some cool people. Also to thank everyone else
        that was there. It seems there's gonna be a wc2007?...hm. ~peace -Brent

        Typical Guimond stuff. Not interesting at all. And my English isn't alot
        better than your translator's, but I think you'll get the idea. "I
        decided to write to only one of the 3 French guys so I could optimize
        hismetnal preparation, and I chose Jean. then follows I think parts of
        the mail he wrote to Jean, and Jean's answer: GG: do you think you did a
        mistake by posting you average on speedcubing.com shortly before the
        French Champs? JP: Yes it was a mistake because I had to handle lots of
        pressure during the championship. GG: blah blah blah but I think you'll
        go to Florida. JP: yes, Winning moves sent me there (instead of paying
        me the money prize of 300EUR) GG: good luck JP: thanks GG: I don't know
        how many of you will be there, but if Chambon wants Pons to win and vice
        versa, then the pressure will be easier to handle and you'll have better
        chances. JP: yes you're right, I think it'll be easier that way and I
        guess we can make it to the top 3, with Chambon. very, very rough
        translation, but it doesn't deserve a lot better. Fran√ßois Tyson Mao a

        Hi everyone! I just arrived home, and I am feeling pretty sad now that
        it is all over. I had such a fantastic time it was unbelievable. I can't
        really sum up in words everything that I am feeling right now, but I
        really feel sorry for the guys who couldnt make it because you really
        did miss out on an awesome weekend. I can't mention everybody here of
        course, so I won't even try, but I had a really brilliant time with you
        all. I feel fairly happy with my performances, I set yet another NR for
        the 3x3x3 and also captured the Megaminx NR! So not too bad :) But I
        feel very humble to be placed so highly (17th out of 150 or so), against
        such world class competition. Naturally Congratulations to Jean, who did
        a great job, and to Edouard, whom it was a real pleasure to finally meet
        for the first time. Also Macky, who did so well to come third place with
        the huge pressure of cameras following his every move, I'm sure at one
        point they even followed him to the "restroom"... Also Congratulations
        to Chris Hardwick, who had the toughest job when it came to getting the
        fasetst time for your country, I salute you! I must mention Lars V and
        Frank as well, who proved dominant on the larger cubes (Lars on Square-1
        also), and of course Yuki whose fantastic talent at the 4x4x4 has
        inspired me to improve my times even more. Finally, thank you to Ron,
        Ton, and Tyson, without your behind the scenes organisation we would not
        have had half as much fun. It is a bit of a shame that the competition
        was held outdoors in such strong, direct sunlight. Of course, the light
        made it hard for all competitors, but I'm sure that some people coped
        with the heat much better than others. Maybe that's the home advantage?
        I don't think that it would be a good idea to have another competition
        outdoors, but that's not to say that it wasn't a great event. One final
        request, I want to make a page on my site with all the pictures that
        people have taken from the Worlds, organised day by day. If you took
        some pictures, and do not have the capability of uploading them to a
        website, then please send them to dan@... - I would love to see them and
        get them online. Also, if you can get pics online, still send them to
        me! I really love to see all your media. I am definitely going to spend
        more time working hard on improving my puzzles, and I hope that I will
        be able to give the French a good run for their money next time! :) And
        Stefan, I will beat you on the clock next time for sure... Thanks
        everyone for such an amazing time, I have so many great memories
        already. See you soon! Dan H :)

        I just got my new textured stickers thanks to a friend's family from
        California who mailed them to me. Although the stickers are light-years
        better than the rubiks.com&lt;http://rubiks.com&gt;ones I found them
        kinda slippery. Does anyone else find that the cubesmith's textured
        stickers have actually less grip than the regular ones? Do they get more
        grip with use? Cheers, Marco Garbelini [Non-text portions of this

        For those who are curious, Alexander Ooms won the Magic with an average
        of 1.44 (I think) in the final round. Stefan was 2nd with 1.88 (I
        think), and I came 3rd with 2.0x. Quinn Lewis set the world record in
        the first round with 1.14 seconds. Stefan broke the WR for Master Magic
        with 2.79. I came in 2nd with 3.00 and Alexander was 3rd with 3.2x. I
        did the magic one-handed in 3.89 seconds, though only three of us
        participated in one-handed magic. :P To no surprise, Stefan won the
        Clock and broke the WR with 8.29 seconds (or something close to that)
        for single solve. He also broke the Megaminx WR with 1:41. Lars won
        Square-1. There is a new WR for 4x4 by Yuki. Ryan P. won the 3x3x3
        one-handed and I am pretty sure Frank Morris won the 5x5x5. Masayuki
        Akimoto won the 2x2x2 cube with a 8.xx average (very impressive for a
        Rubik's brand!) ~ Bob ~ Bob

        wonder.. maybe a reverse mechanism would work. have it in contact at

        releasing would trigger the contact to start it.. then stopping would
        require a quick (to avoid delays) press.. does this sound like it'd
        work? --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Pedro

        Hey everyone, I don't know about you guys, but I am going stir crazy
        waiting for the results! I don't even know my placement in a couple of
        the events I competed in! I e-mailed the rubiks.com contact section
        about the results, but I think they are all out and about still in
        Orlando until the 9th. Anyway I had a wonderful time, I'd rather save
        all my comments memories for a report, which I will write once I get the
        pictures from Becky's camera, which should happen later today. Anyway I
        had such a wonderful time meeting everyone, from old friends to new
        faces. I hope to see everyone again, and more new faces, in 2007 (which
        I really hope will be in Europe) :-D Will soon have a report up with my
        take on WC2005. Chris

        Megaminx WR with 1:41. Lars won Square-1. There is a new WR for 4x4 by
        Yuki. Ryan P. won the 3x3x3 one-handed and I am pretty sure Frank Morris

        Hi Everyone, Does anyone know an algorithm to flip the FU, BU, FD, and
        BD edges? If it's the FL, FR, BL, BR, that would work too or any
        variation. It pops up every now and then and I'm tired of flipping two,
        flipping the cube, and then flipping another two. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        U(FB)2U(FB)2R2BF'U2R'U2B'FR2U' 16 moves in HTM - it's optimal for that

        That works. I'll have to play around with it to see if it's worth it as
        opposed to setup moves + the 4-flip algorithm. Oh, Leyan came up with a
        good method of stopping the timer on a Generation 2. Basically start
        your hands from the outside and slide them in. It works very quickly and
        you won't miss and you won't hit the reset button. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is from my intermediate method. Does
        it work for you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        U(FB)2U(FB)2R2BF'U2R'U2B'FR2U' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 16 moves in
        HTM - it's optimal for that metric. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        For anyone who has the document (I referenced the link a few days &gt;
        &gt; ago), it's algorithm 4.3.7 (single ring flip, although I didn't
        call &gt; &gt; it that in this document) from page 15. &gt; &gt; You can
        get the double ring flip from 4.5.7 (page 31). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I've tried e-mailing through the rubiks.com contact page but I was
        redirected to Dave Jones' e-mail, and he is still out of town until the
        9th. To whoever is posting results on rubiks.com, I've seen a few
        requests so far for individual times in each round, which I am also
        curious in seeing. If the poster/webmaster for rubiks.com reads this
        group, could we (in any form really) also get the individual times for
        each round? IN the past Tyson has sent the excel file, that would be
        fine. We're all just curious to see ;-) Chris

        Thats an easy one. Heres what i would do: First, fold 2 tiles from the
        right and 2 tiles from the left behind the puzzle. Then turn the puzzle
        90 degrees counter clockwise. Now fold out 2 tiles in the middle to the
        right and 2 to the left. now fold the puzzle in half away from you like
        a valley. Fld 2 tiles from the right down and 2 from the left down. you
        should have the puzzle stacked up. now peel off a tile from the top
        right side down. Peel one tile from the lower left up. Unfold the
        puzzle. Fold 2 tiles from the right and 2 from the left behind the
        puzzle (like the first time). Turn it 90 degrees again and unfold it.
        Fold the top half over the bottom. Then fold it out into a loop and
        slide the top half one tile to the right. Unfold the puzzle, and it
        should be fine. Be sure to read this (scroll down to "Getting back to
        the starting position"):

        a lot of lube, I think they'll be excellent. I'll just have to make sure
        to peel off the stickers carefully, so I can transplant them onto a cube
        that doesn't turn as well. Rivets aren't nearly as big a deal as a lot

        I second that notion; that was the best. It was great meeting everyone
        and associating new names with faces. Dan, it was great cubing with you,
        and Joel, it was equally awesome discussing methods. Finally meeting all
        the European cubers is a thrill, especially Ron and Jean Pons. I had the
        honor of racing Mr. Akimoto in a 3x3x3 solve. Twice. ;) Good
        times...good times. Oh, a special thanks to Mark Polinkovsky for being
        himself and to the Mark team for the hilarious full-contact competition.
        That right there was worth the trip. It was also great meeting up with
        everyone from US Nationals. Ton, Jasmine, Doug, Chris... Great seeing

        So, I'm very seriously considering using the RH step 1, then finishing
        off with the last c/e pair and OLL/PLL for my speedcubing. At a moderate
        speed Im getting averaging around 27-28 moves every time for f2l which I
        think can be sped up. My problem is that I suck at planning the 2x2x2
        ahead of solving. It seems very hard for me to be able to quickly pick
        which one is the best to do and then be able to plan it out in 15
        seconds. I nearly never can. Any advice from 2x2x2 starters? -James

        Heres what i would do: &gt; &gt; First, fold 2 tiles from the right and
        2 tiles from the left behind &gt; the puzzle. Then turn the puzzle 90
        degrees counter clockwise. Now &gt; fold out 2 tiles in the middle to
        the right and 2 to the left. now &gt; fold the puzzle in half away from
        you like a valley. Fld 2 tiles from &gt; the right down and 2 from the
        left down. you should have the puzzle &gt; stacked up. now peel off a
        tile from the top right side down. Peel &gt; one tile from the lower
        left up. Unfold the puzzle. Fold 2 tiles from &gt; the right and 2 from
        the left behind the puzzle (like the first &gt; time). Turn it 90
        degrees again and unfold it. Fold the top half over &gt; the bottom.
        Then fold it out into a loop and slide the top half one &gt; tile to the
        right. Unfold the puzzle, and it should be fine. &gt; &gt; Be sure to
        read this (scroll down to "Getting back to the starting &gt; position"):

        I started using the Petrus method 5 months ago and I think I'm quite
        good at starting with 2x2x2. First I usually create a c/e pair. If there
        exists one already, I will use it. After I have a c/e pair I'll use it
        to create a 1x2x2-block. It is quite simple to do, at least after some
        practice. Then I just finish the 2x2x2 by solving the edge that doesn't
        belong to the 1x2x2-block and after solving it I place the 1x2x2 with
        one move. Usually the whole thing takes less than 8 moves. Well, this
        how I do it. I don't know does it help. Anyway, the best advice I can
        give is just pracitce, practice, practice. 2x2x2 is a lot more
        complicated to create than cross. http://lar5.com/cube/fas1.html (this
        is an excellent page)

        Regarding the results - it's astounding how level the playing field is.
        Practically anyone from the top 25 or so could have come out on top.
        Chambon went all the way from 13th to 2nd. Jean Pons was in 7th place in
        the semis and won it all. The lesson here is NEVER give up - there's
        always a chance! Looks like Macky also cleaned up - third place, fastest
        solve, second place one-handed. That's a nice bit of spending
        money...for use on more cubes, of course. :P

        Hi friends, It was great meeting you all in Florida! Happy to have been
        part of WC 2005. Proud to have been part of the organization. Yes,
        competing outside was different. It was hot, and it was hard to see the
        times on the displays. But the best have won, so no excuses. Congrats to
        Jean, Yuki, Frank, Leyan and all the others. Here some statistics from
        WC 2005: 1) average age of competitors: 23 years 10 months 2) average
        age of 3x3 finalists: 18 years 9 months (Jon being 30!) I am getting too
        old for this. :-) 3) average solve in 1st round: 37.29 seconds 4)
        average solve in semi final: 20.14 seconds 5) average solve in final:
        16.93 seconds... Don't miss the next WC!!! Have fun, Ron

        For some reason, I am not listed on the 5x5x5. I had a time of 7:05 on
        my first attempt. However, they do list other times slower than that.

        &gt; Regarding the results - it's astounding how level the playing field
        &gt; is. Practically anyone from the top 25 or so could have come out on
        &gt; top. Chambon went all the way from 13th to 2nd. Jean Pons was in
        7th &gt; place in the semis and won it all. The lesson here is NEVER
        give up - &gt; there's always a chance! In any high-level sport, at top
        level, the difference between winning and losing is epsilon. "Never give
        up, it ain't over till it's over" is one of the N commandments of
        competition. There are many more. Understand all of them, adapt them to
        ur personality, and you'll be more than a skilled cuber : you'll be a
        tough competitor. Amen :-). -- FD.

        Heres what i would do: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, fold 2 tiles from the
        right and 2 tiles from the left behind &gt; &gt; the puzzle. Then turn
        the puzzle 90 degrees counter clockwise. Now &gt; &gt; fold out 2 tiles
        in the middle to the right and 2 to the left. now &gt; &gt; fold the
        puzzle in half away from you like a valley. Fld 2 tiles from &gt; &gt;
        the right down and 2 from the left down. you should have the puzzle &gt;
        &gt; stacked up. now peel off a tile from the top right side down. Peel
        &gt; &gt; one tile from the lower left up. Unfold the puzzle. Fold 2
        tiles from &gt; &gt; the right and 2 from the left behind the puzzle
        (like the first &gt; &gt; time). Turn it 90 degrees again and unfold it.
        Fold the top half over &gt; &gt; the bottom. Then fold it out into a
        loop and slide the top half one &gt; &gt; tile to the right. Unfold the
        puzzle, and it should be fine. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be sure to read this

        Ron, I have a slight problem with the Master Magic Event... It says
        there that I did not compete at all, and I had witnesses to my solves,
        one of them being sub-5 seconds...One was 4.94 I believe, the other
        around 5.16, but I don't know why it wasn't recorded (the judge wrote

        I concur. I had very much fun meeting all the cubers...and there were so
        many! It's great to see that our object of obsession is starting to gain
        popularity. =) Congratulations to Jean, Edouard, Yuki, Frank, Leyan, and
        all the other winners and finalists. It's amazing how the times have
        improved since Toronto! Jean and Edouard put up impressive times in the
        final. I had no big mistake, so I have no excuse for the 16 average.
        They simply performed better under the competition condition. The funny
        thing is, Saturday night at dinner, all the Japanese cubers, Jean, and
        Edouard were racing, and the three of us sat in the same order as we did
        for the picture of the three top finishers. I also had the opportunity
        to talk to Jean and Edouard a little in French (I'll have to practice
        quite a bit now). Very nice meeting you two! I started listing
        everyone's name but then decided that it would take too long. So,
        everyone I'd met before, it was nice to see you again; everyone I hadn't
        met before, it was nice meeting you. I wish that I hadn't had so much
        homework to do. There were a lot of people I wanted to talk to, and I
        feel that I didn't get to do that very much. I look forward to meeting
        you all again in the future. Of course, much thanks to Ron, Tyson,
        judges, scramblers, and the organizers for putting together a great
        competition. And a bad news: it looks like I left my camera outside the
        main building on Monday morning, just before I left. Anyone seen a
        silver Nikon Coolpix in a gray cover? If I promised to send you a
        picture, sorry! I might just have to steal mr. hamster's camera. Macky

        Hey everyone, I know there have been groups in the past for
        corners-first, blindfold solving, etc. Well I created a ZB method group
        here at: http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/zbmethod/ I am going to get
        very serious about learning ZBLL algs again. I already know 1 COLL case
        for the U orientation, and will be trying to finish it in less than 5
        months. Then I want to learn the L orientation (names come from Dan
        Harris' page). After that I want to take averages, as I think those
        three orientation cases, plus the no OLL case orientation, will be
        enough to average sub-16 fairly often with ZB. Anyway, as far as I am
        concerned this method is an experiment, but it sounds like there are
        others interested in learning. In order to make it easier for us to
        share ideas, if you are interested in learning please join the group so
        we can discuss ideas and things. Even if you're a skeptic, please feel
        free to join the group. Again this method is an experiment, so I think
        it would be best to have people for and against it feel free to discuss
        how they feel about the method. I'm just going to post here about the
        creation of this group, I will try to contain my discussion of ZB to the
        ZB group in the future. Chris

        Macky, we found your camera in the restaurant. We handed it over at the
        reception desk and we told them it was yours, so you can have it picked
        up or sent to you. Once again I had another great time meeting you all
        also. And it is truely amazing how much the standard has risen. I felt
        quite bad about just missing out on the 3x3 final (I finished 13th in
        the semis) but if I look at all those wonderful averages that other
        people set, I should be quite proud of my placing. This was certainly
        the best Rubik's competition I've been to and I hope there will be many
        more. Lars --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Well, I guess it is time to put my two cents in...I'll write a report
        sometime. It was amazing meeting everyone for the first time. I never
        expected everyone to as nice as they were. Some of the people didn't
        look like I expected, but that's given when you are making assumptions.
        Thank you everyone who taught me something new, and to everyone that was
        there and I got to talk to and hang out with thank you too. I can't wait
        until I go to another tournament. Congratulations to all the winners of
        the different events and congratulations on all the world records that
        were broken, you guys are amazing at what you do. Craig P.S. - I did a
        magic average of 100 last night, got 1.56, best average of 10 (12
        dropping fastest and slowest) was 1.44, and Bob...I broke my 1.40 PB
        soooo many times, and I got one sub-1.3 solve, which tied your old world
        record. I am coming to get you all in the magic...watch out... --- In

        I felt quite bad &gt; about just missing out on the 3x3 final (I
        finished 13th in the &gt; semis) but if I look at all those wonderful
        averages that other &gt; people set, I should be quite proud of my

        &gt; to gain popularity. =) Congratulations to Jean, Edouard, Yuki, &gt;
        Frank, &gt; &gt; Leyan, and all the other winners and finalists. It's
        amazing how &gt; the &gt; &gt; times have improved since Toronto! &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Jean and Edouard put up impressive times in the final. I
        had no big &gt; &gt; mistake, so I have no excuse for the 16 average.
        They simply &gt; &gt; performed better under the competition condition.
        The funny thing &gt; is, &gt; &gt; Saturday night at dinner, all the
        Japanese cubers, Jean, and &gt; Edouard &gt; &gt; were racing, and the
        three of us sat in the same order as we did &gt; for &gt; &gt; the
        picture of the three top finishers. I also had the opportunity &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; talk to Jean and Edouard a little in French (I'll have to
        practice &gt; &gt; quite a bit now). Very nice meeting you two! &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I started listing everyone's name but then decided that
        it would &gt; take &gt; &gt; too long. So, everyone I'd met before, it
        was nice to see you &gt; again; &gt; &gt; everyone I hadn't met before,
        it was nice meeting you. I wish that &gt; I &gt; &gt; hadn't had so much
        homework to do. There were a lot of people I &gt; &gt; wanted to talk
        to, and I feel that I didn't get to do that very &gt; much. &gt; &gt; I
        look forward to meeting you all again in the future. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Of course, much thanks to Ron, Tyson, judges, scramblers, and the &gt;
        &gt; organizers for putting together a great competition. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; And a bad news: it looks like I left my camera outside the main
        &gt; &gt; building on Monday morning, just before I left. Anyone seen a
        &gt; silver &gt; &gt; Nikon Coolpix in a gray cover? If I promised to
        send you a picture, &gt; &gt; sorry! I might just have to steal mr.

        Hi guys (and guyesses ...) :D Many great things have been said about the
        WC in Orlando and i agree with what has been said. It's amazing to see
        so many fast cubers when there is about zilch (nil) in Norway taking
        cubing seriously. 12 guys in the final without Lars Vandenbergh or Ron
        van Bruchem or Jo√´l van Noort in it. Well, that looks weird to me ...
        hehehe ... And a bunch of world and national records were set. But im
        not really too happy with the organisation of the event. My main
        complaints are : - should be outdoor to provide fairness and better
        atmosphere for the contestants - poor result service, not very good use
        of the large monitor provided ... no info about "side events" -
        discrimination of the "side events" - non rubiks puzles, and also
        dicrimination of these as only the winners were called, not 3rd, 2nd and
        1st like for the other events - very bad conditions for fewest moves,
        first day inside in a small room, second day even worse ... outside
        sitting by a small table only ... also first day the scramble was not
        provided on a sheet like second day ... and i really hope we can use
        stickers next time ... i always end up with cycles in the end .. with no
        stickers i can't optimise anything :-( ... i gonna propose changes to
        the rules fo fewest moves :-) Ok, now for some positive feedback. I
        spoke to Dave Hedley Jones. I suggested some improvments for the 5x5x5
        cube. And actually they are now doing some re-engineering, so now is a
        good time to come up with ideas for improving their puzzles :-) I will
        send Dave an email to remind him and then we will see how it goes ... It
        was really great to see the faces behind all the names that i knew
        beforehand :-D Cheers! -Per

        Haha David, I just got on here to post a message about that, since I
        just checked slashdot. You beat me to it. One of the interesting things
        I noticed while reading through the comments is that there are far more
        people who are amazed rather than skeptical. Whenever a speedcubing
        video gets posted to a site (I remember one on fazed.org), a lot of
        people instantly assume its a fake, and try to think about how they made
        the fake video. I think since people can see that there is a world
        championships, it adds a lot of credibility in their minds. I hope
        speedcubing.com can handle the slashdotting. Was the poster a member of
        the group, or was it an outsider? Chris Parlette --- In

        he came up with that uses only M' and U (not even U' or M!). I have only
        been practicing it a little bit, but I did manage to get one in 1.600
        seconds (video analysis). Take a look:
        http://www.cubewhiz.com/temp/fastzperm.avi The file is 536 KB and
        requires DivX. For those interested in trying out the alg, here it is:
        [U2] M2' U M2' U M' U2 M2' U2 M'. The U2 adjustment works great before
        the alg because it is quite easy to recognize this case from U2 (more so
        than from U or U', for me). You could also do the U2 at the end if you
        insist on first moving all the corners to their solved position. ~ Bob

        hungary are the best. Why? Also, are the american &gt; cubes from the
        '80s similar to the hungarian cubes? &gt; &gt; ~John~ &gt; Hi John, What
        do you mean by "American" cubes? Ideal made some cubes in America and
        Logical Games made the "American Cube" before Ideal made any cubes. I
        haven't tried to make a speedcube out of either, though apparently the
        "American Cube" cam lubed with silicone! For speedcubing I rate the
        cubes: 1. Ideal Tiled Deluxe Edition Best all around, no other cube
        comes close. It has adjusting screws and is arched underneath the
        centers - the hard, slick plastic is thicker than others and is faster
        unlubed than all the other cubes lubed. It is a bit heavier than other
        cubes. Rarely pops or locks up. Takes silicon spray lube very well, but
        not Rubiks.com lube. No need for stickers. The Rubik's Game/Challenge
        has Deluxe cubes with peg holes. I takes about 5 minutes to get used to
        the peg holes which can make for better grip. 2. The new cubes from
        Seven Towns (Rubiks.com, Hasbro, Winning Moves and Hessport) Comes with
        arched centers, can be ordered with screws as a DIY. These never pop.
        Lighter than the Deluxe, it takes rubiks.com lube well. Tends to lock up
        more than the Deluxe. They come with terrible stickers. Averages 1 1/2
        seconds slower than Deluxe for 30 second solve. 3. Ideal cubes circa
        1980-1983. The ones made in Hungary, England, and Hong Kong are the
        best. I have heard that the ones made in Korea are good, too. Avoid the
        Taiwan-made cubes. These have adjustable screws, and excellent stickers.
        Very few have arches, but the arched version is the lightest official
        cube. Without arches they tend to pop instead of locking up. Averages 2
        1/2 second slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve. 4. Rubik's
        studio cubes. Has the best plastic of cubes made nowadays. Comes with
        screws but not arches. Pops quite a lot. Averages nearly three second
        slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve. I have't used the three I
        have enough to know the sticker wear. 5. Older Hasbro (etc) cube (before
        2000) had screws, but not arches. A friends older Hasbro speedcube is
        fairly quick, but I have little experience with this one. The one I have
        is terrible. 6. Wonderful Puzzler. Well made knock-off, came with
        arches. Never tried to make one into a speed cube. I don't know if they
        have screws. 7. C*4 cube Made by Matchbox in the late 80s, with Rubik's
        silkouette and signature. Lousy plastic. Not a very good cube. 8.
        Mefferts These are terrible because they have no pressure and you must
        stop a turn with effort. Constantly locks up. Decent plastic, but no
        springs or screws. There are lots of tiled cubes out there which are
        terrible, leading the list is the "Old Brand Magic Square" (though
        Stefan likes the springs). The only high quality tiled knock-off was
        called Gyro Cube, and it has flat centers. Regards, David J

        There are also websites that list good hosts, with tests for speed and

        Hi Guys and Gals, In the notation I use, where lower case means a slice,
        instead of taking the long way around, like L2 R2 D2 L2 F2 L2 R2 B2 R2
        D2 which is 10 moves, or L2 R2 D U' B2 F2 D U' which is 8 moves, my
        4-spot pattern is four moves: r2 u r2 u'. The 6-spot pattern is four
        moves, too: r f r' f'. I'm interested in the fewest moves needed to
        solve the cube using this notation. What metric should these be
        classified within? What would the upper and lower bounds be? Thanks,

        Hi :-) There is no problem usually to have a webspace anywhere in the

        with ur knowledge of the language used on the sign-up page. And as long

        Very thorough analysis. I would add a few minor points. 1) The Ideal
        tiled model is MAJORLY expensive (I think $300 is not unheard of)! 2) I
        would also caution against the Korean cubes which appear to be hit or
        miss. The ones I got already came with some nasty lube that looked like
        earwax. It was impossible to get it all off and when I added
        silicone...the cube was toast. It would not turn without sticking. 3)
        Virtually all Ideal cubes, except maybe the Hungarian ones, have a color
        scheme of white-opp-blue, yellow-opp-green. If you get a tiled or game
        cube I'm not sure how easy it is to switch over to the "standard"
        white-yellow. Stickers are not much of a problem thanks to Cubesmith,
        though you may need some extra solvents to get all the gunk off from the
        old ones. BTW, I am now forcing myself to use white-yellow. A new
        convert after 20+ years of doing it the 'wrong' way. --- In

        cubes: &gt; &gt; 1. Ideal Tiled Deluxe Edition &gt; Best all around, no
        other cube comes close. It has adjusting screws &gt; and is arched
        underneath the centers - the hard, slick plastic is &gt; thicker than
        others and is faster unlubed than all the other cubes &gt; lubed. It is
        a bit heavier than other cubes. Rarely pops or locks up. &gt; Takes
        silicon spray lube very well, but not Rubiks.com lube. No need &gt; for
        stickers. &gt; &gt; The Rubik's Game/Challenge has Deluxe cubes with peg
        holes. I takes &gt; about 5 minutes to get used to the peg holes which
        can make for better &gt; grip. &gt; &gt; 2. The new cubes from Seven
        Towns (Rubiks.com, Hasbro, Winning Moves &gt; and Hessport) &gt; Comes
        with arched centers, can be ordered with screws as a DIY. These &gt;
        never pop. Lighter than the Deluxe, it takes rubiks.com lube well. &gt;
        Tends to lock up more than the Deluxe. They come with terrible &gt;
        stickers. Averages 1 1/2 seconds slower than Deluxe for 30 second solve.
        &gt; &gt; 3. Ideal cubes circa 1980-1983. &gt; The ones made in Hungary,
        England, and Hong Kong are the best. I have &gt; heard that the ones
        made in Korea are good, too. Avoid the Taiwan- made &gt; cubes. These
        have adjustable screws, and excellent stickers. Very few &gt; have
        arches, but the arched version is the lightest official cube. &gt;
        Without arches they tend to pop instead of locking up. Averages 2 1/2
        &gt; second slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve. &gt; &gt; 4.
        Rubik's studio cubes. Has the best plastic of cubes made nowadays. &gt;
        Comes with screws but not arches. Pops quite a lot. Averages nearly &gt;
        three second slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve. I have't &gt;
        used the three I have enough to know the sticker wear. &gt; &gt; 5.
        Older Hasbro (etc) cube (before 2000) had screws, but not arches. A &gt;
        friends older Hasbro speedcube is fairly quick, but I have little &gt;
        experience with this one. The one I have is terrible. &gt; &gt; 6.
        Wonderful Puzzler. &gt; Well made knock-off, came with arches. Never
        tried to make one into a &gt; speed cube. I don't know if they have
        screws. &gt; &gt; 7. C*4 cube &gt; Made by Matchbox in the late 80s,
        with Rubik's silkouette and &gt; signature. Lousy plastic. Not a very
        good cube. &gt; &gt; 8. Mefferts &gt; These are terrible because they
        have no pressure and you must stop a &gt; turn with effort. Constantly
        locks up. Decent plastic, but no springs &gt; or screws. &gt; &gt; There
        are lots of tiled cubes out there which are terrible, leading &gt; the
        list is the "Old Brand Magic Square" (though Stefan likes the &gt;
        springs). The only high quality tiled knock-off was called Gyro Cube,
        &gt; and it has flat centers. &gt; &gt; Regards, &gt; &gt; David J &gt;

        this could be reduced, but you'd have to persuade someone to repeat
        Reid's calculations for your new metric. As for the lower bound, I don't
        currently have the energy to do the standard counting argument, taking
        into account commutation of moves on the same axis -- but you almost
        certainly know how to do this anyway. Since it is the argument that
        gives 18 (rather than 20) as the lower bound for HTM, you probably
        wanted something better than that. Unfortunately, I don't have an
        optimal solver for this metric, so I can't try likely-looking
        candidates... Regards Mike

        include the "averages X seconds slower than &gt; Deluxe for Y second
        solve" stats for Y less than 30? With 30 it's not &gt; really
        interesting since you don't need fast turning or good look &gt; ahead
        for that at all. I'd be more interested in Y=15. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt;
        Stefan &gt; Those stats were accurate for me when I took them about two
        years ago. In the Spring tournament in 2004 I loaned Macky one of my
        Deluxe cubes and he did a "Champion's Solve" 12.29 IIRC. When I got home
        I found that I had given him the wrong cube and the one he used, though
        adjusted nicely, was not lubed. I'd need to get someone quicker than I
        to get you sub fifteen numbers. Cheers, David J

        analysis. Thanks. &gt; I would add a few minor points. &gt; &gt; 1) The
        Ideal tiled model is MAJORLY expensive (I think $300 is not &gt; unheard
        of)! yes, but that's for a sealed one. The Game cube is the same quality
        and isn't expensive. &gt; 2) I would also caution against the Korean
        cubes which appear to be &gt; hit or miss. The ones I got already came
        with some nasty lube that &gt; looked like earwax. It was impossible to
        get it all off and when I &gt; added silicone...the cube was toast. It
        would not turn without &gt; sticking. OK, thanks. &gt; 3) Virtually all
        Ideal cubes, except maybe the Hungarian ones, have a &gt; color scheme
        of white-opp-blue, yellow-opp-green. If you get a tiled &gt; or game
        cube I'm not sure how easy it is to switch over to &gt; the "standard"
        white-yellow. This was the first Official Color Scheme back the, The old
        4x4x4s and 2x2x2'a were that color too. As for switching to the newer
        Official Color Scheme, BOY, ask Stefan. &gt; Stickers are not much of a
        problem &gt; thanks to Cubesmith, though you may need some extra
        solvents to get &gt; all the gunk off from the old ones. Yeah, the next
        person who tells me that they solved the cube by switching stickers I'm
        going to invite home to help me change stickers on a few cubes! &gt;
        BTW, I am now forcing myself to use white-yellow. A new convert &gt;
        after 20+ years of doing it the 'wrong' way. Cool. I prefer the old
        standard. What color do you use for the Last Level? I use Red for the
        Last Level, but I don't use the cross. Cheers, David J &gt; &gt; --- In

        rate the cubes: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Ideal Tiled Deluxe Edition &gt;
        &gt; Best all around, no other cube comes close. It has adjusting screws
        &gt; &gt; and is arched underneath the centers - the hard, slick plastic
        is &gt; &gt; thicker than others and is faster unlubed than all the
        other cubes &gt; &gt; lubed. It is a bit heavier than other cubes.
        Rarely pops or locks &gt; up. &gt; &gt; Takes silicon spray lube very
        well, but not Rubiks.com lube. No need &gt; &gt; for stickers. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; The Rubik's Game/Challenge has Deluxe cubes with peg holes. I
        takes &gt; &gt; about 5 minutes to get used to the peg holes which can
        make for &gt; better &gt; &gt; grip. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. The new
        cubes from Seven Towns (Rubiks.com, Hasbro, Winning Moves &gt; &gt; and
        Hessport) &gt; &gt; Comes with arched centers, can be ordered with
        screws as a DIY. &gt; These &gt; &gt; never pop. Lighter than the
        Deluxe, it takes rubiks.com lube well. &gt; &gt; Tends to lock up more
        than the Deluxe. They come with terrible &gt; &gt; stickers. Averages 1
        1/2 seconds slower than Deluxe for 30 second &gt; solve. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 3. Ideal cubes circa 1980-1983. &gt; &gt; The ones made in Hungary,
        England, and Hong Kong are the best. I &gt; have &gt; &gt; heard that
        the ones made in Korea are good, too. Avoid the Taiwan- &gt; made &gt;
        &gt; cubes. These have adjustable screws, and excellent stickers. Very
        &gt; few &gt; &gt; have arches, but the arched version is the lightest
        official cube. &gt; &gt; Without arches they tend to pop instead of
        locking up. Averages 2 &gt; 1/2 &gt; &gt; second slower than the Deluxe
        for a 30 second solve. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Rubik's studio cubes. Has
        the best plastic of cubes made &gt; nowadays. &gt; &gt; Comes with
        screws but not arches. Pops quite a lot. Averages nearly &gt; &gt; three
        second slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve. I have't &gt; &gt;
        used the three I have enough to know the sticker wear. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 5. Older Hasbro (etc) cube (before 2000) had screws, but not &gt;
        arches. A &gt; &gt; friends older Hasbro speedcube is fairly quick, but
        I have little &gt; &gt; experience with this one. The one I have is
        terrible. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Wonderful Puzzler. &gt; &gt; Well made
        knock-off, came with arches. Never tried to make one into &gt; a &gt;
        &gt; speed cube. I don't know if they have screws. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        7. C*4 cube &gt; &gt; Made by Matchbox in the late 80s, with Rubik's
        silkouette and &gt; &gt; signature. Lousy plastic. Not a very good cube.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. Mefferts &gt; &gt; These are terrible because
        they have no pressure and you must stop a &gt; &gt; turn with effort.
        Constantly locks up. Decent plastic, but no &gt; springs &gt; &gt; or
        screws. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are lots of tiled cubes out there
        which are terrible, leading &gt; &gt; the list is the "Old Brand Magic
        Square" (though Stefan likes the &gt; &gt; springs). The only high
        quality tiled knock-off was called Gyro &gt; Cube, &gt; &gt; and it has
        flat centers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J

        Ah, a new metric. Thanks. &gt; &gt; What would &gt; &gt; the upper and

        Reid's figure of 29, which &gt; is the current upper bound in HTM. I
        thought that was 26. &gt; Presumably this could be reduced, &gt; but
        you'd have to persuade someone to repeat Reid's calculations for &gt;
        your new metric. Anybody? &gt; As for the lower bound, I don't currently
        have the energy to do the &gt; standard counting argument, taking into
        account commutation of moves on &gt; the same axis -- but you almost
        certainly know how to do this anyway. &gt; Since it is the argument that
        gives 18 (rather than 20) as the lower &gt; bound for HTM, you probably
        wanted something better than that. Yes, that's implied. &gt;
        Unfortunately, I don't have an optimal solver for this metric, so I &gt;
        can't try likely-looking candidates... Does anyone? &gt; Regards &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Many great things have been said about the WC in Orlando and i
        agree &gt; with what has been said. It's amazing to see so many fast
        cubers &gt; when there is about zilch (nil) in Norway taking cubing
        seriously. &gt; 12 guys in the final without Lars Vandenbergh or Ron van
        Bruchem or &gt; Jo√´l van Noort in it. Well, that looks weird to me ...
        hehehe ... &gt; And a bunch of world and national records were set. &gt;
        &gt; But im not really too happy with the organisation of the event. My
        &gt; main complaints are : &gt; &gt; - should be outdoor to provide
        fairness and better atmosphere for &gt; the contestants &gt; &gt; - poor
        result service, not very good use of the large monitor &gt; provided ...
        no info about "side events" &gt; &gt; - discrimination of the "side
        events" - non rubiks puzles, and also &gt; dicrimination of these as
        only the winners were called, not 3rd, 2nd &gt; and 1st like for the
        other events &gt; &gt; - very bad conditions for fewest moves, first day
        inside in a small &gt; room, second day even worse ... outside sitting
        by a small table &gt; only ... also first day the scramble was not
        provided on a sheet &gt; like second day ... and i really hope we can
        use stickers next &gt; time ... i always end up with cycles in the end
        .. with no stickers &gt; i can't optimise anything :-( ... i gonna
        propose changes to the &gt; rules fo fewest moves :-) &gt; &gt; Ok, now
        for some positive feedback. I spoke to Dave Hedley Jones. I &gt;
        suggested some improvments for the 5x5x5 cube. And actually they are
        &gt; now doing some re-engineering, so now is a good time to come up
        with &gt; ideas for improving their puzzles :-) I will send Dave an
        email to &gt; remind him and then we will see how it goes ... &gt; &gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Slice HTM, surely. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;Ah, a new metric. Thanks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What would
        &gt;&gt;&gt;the upper and lower bounds be? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;Well.. the upper bound cannot /exceed/ Mike Reid's figure of 29,
        which &gt;&gt;is the current upper bound in HTM. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;I thought that was 26. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Presumably this could
        be reduced, &gt;&gt;but you'd have to persuade someone to repeat Reid's
        calculations for &gt;&gt;your new metric. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;Anybody? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;As for the lower bound, I don't
        currently have the energy to do the &gt;&gt;standard counting argument,
        taking into account commutation of moves on &gt;&gt;the same axis -- but
        you almost certainly know how to do this anyway. &gt;&gt;Since it is the
        argument that gives 18 (rather than 20) as the lower &gt;&gt;bound for
        HTM, you probably wanted something better than that. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;Yes, that's implied. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Unfortunately, I
        don't have an optimal solver for this metric, so I &gt;&gt;can't try
        likely-looking candidates... &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Does anyone?

        All -- Out of curiousity, I decided to use a "points system" to
        determine the "Top Cuber" and "Top Puzzler" at WC2005. I've been
        thinking about this as an extra category at competitions. **** Quick
        Explanation: "points system" = 10pts for first, 9 for second, etc,
        through top 10 or end of competitors or DNF/DNS. If final was only 8
        people, I gave points to #9/#10 from previous round. "Top Cuber" = list
        people by most points based on cubing events listed on main stage (2x,
        3x, 4x, 5x, 3x-blind, 3x-onehand, 3x-feet, 3x- fewestmoves, 4x-blind,
        5x-blind) "Top Puzzler" = list people by ost points based on all events
        (includes "side" events aka Magic, Clock, Megaminx, Square1, Master
        Magic, 3x-speed-blindfolded, Magic-onehand). **** Results Top Cuber
        --------- Leyan Lo = 34 pts Chris Hardwick = 27 pts Yuki Hayashi = 22
        pts Shotaro Makisumi = 21 pts Masayuki Akimoto = 20 pts Leyan and Chris
        both placed top 10 in five events - very impressive! Top Puzzler
        ----------- Stefan Pochmann = 61 pts Alexander Ooms = 36 pts Leyan Lo =
        34 pts Chris Hardwick = 31 pts Lars Vandenbergh = 30 pts Stefan placed
        in every "side" event except 3x-speedblindfold, winning three and
        placing second, third and sixth in the others - he is Puzzle- Man. I'll
        put the Excel spreadsheet on the site later and add the link. Enjoy the

      <div class="email-content">
        Good evening, For those of you who were at the world championships and
        got a UFO puzzle, this might be interesting. Wes and I wrote an
        interactive solver for it. You can find it at
        &lt;http://www.terpstra.ca/puzzles/ufo.php&gt; By clicking the pieces
        from the right UFO, you can move them (via the middle) to the left UFO.
        Once the left UFO is completely filled up, the program will find a
        move-optimal solution. Interesting facts about the puzzle include: There
        are exactly 11! distinct states (12* more if you hold it differently) -
        the included booklet is wrong by 800 states for whatever reason Every
        state is reachable (all moves are odd permutations, so even/odd are both
        reachable) The longest distance between any two states is 16 moves
        Interesting facts about the solver include: It only needs to explore 11
        thousand states on average It's written in Standard ML (compiled by
        MLton.org) and PHP On a decent machine (not that webserver), it needs
        &lt; 1s Some useful operations are: flip two neighbours

        py=11&gt; ... notice that these are really far apart states. :-) Have

        &gt; &gt; ~ Bob You're right, I'm avging about 5s slower now. It's just
        part of a general philosophy of mine to try to be more conventional,

        who like the old scheme! There is one other long-time cuber at my
        workplace and even he likes the new one. For LL I was using blue on the
        old scheme and green on the new. Now I am strictly using the new scheme
        with LL = yellow. I think that's what most people do.

        I've decided to better my 5x5 solving after my recent success with my
        homemade 4x4 method. I've gotten my average down to about 9 minutes this
        way, but I think that's mostly because it's a brand new 5x5 and it
        doesn't turn very well at all yet. Anyway, I solve what basically
        amounts to edges first, and one area I'm having entirely too much
        trouble in is the center pieces on the final 4 faces (all in a slice). I
        finish this step by swapping single pieces between adjacent faces, and
        when I can see it, either rows of 3 pieces, or less frequently, groups
        of two. My real problems stem from pieces being on opposite faces from
        where they go. Currently, I have no choice but to move one piece to an
        adjacent face, switch the piece into place moving the second piece onto
        the adjacent face, and then fix the remaining pair. It's twice as many
        moves as it should be, and I suspect there are good tricks for pieces on
        opposite faces like on the 4x4. Anyway, someone should reply with
        helpful moves quickly, as my poor wrists won't last much longer. ;)

        I like having a Rubiks logo on my cube because it just looks weird to me
        when it's missing, but it appears that a lot of people go logo- less. So
        I was wondering.... 1) Why do you prefer logo/non-logo? Although I don't
        do this, I was thinking maybe it could help you solve the cross,
        (mentally remembering "The white-red piece is now at the top of the
        logo" or something like that). 2) For 3x3 competitions, can you have a
        logo somewhere other than a center? Can you have a logo on more than one
        square?

        ones from hungary are the best. Why? Also, are the american &gt; &gt;
        cubes from the '80s similar to the hungarian cubes? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        ~John~ &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi John, &gt; &gt; What do you mean by
        "American" cubes? Ideal made some cubes in America &gt; and Logical
        Games made the "American Cube" before Ideal made any cubes. &gt; I
        haven't tried to make a speedcube out of either, though apparently &gt;
        the "American Cube" cam lubed with silicone! &gt; &gt; For speedcubing I
        rate the cubes: &gt; &gt; 1. Ideal Tiled Deluxe Edition &gt; Best all
        around, no other cube comes close. It has adjusting screws &gt; and is
        arched underneath the centers - the hard, slick plastic is &gt; thicker
        than others and is faster unlubed than all the other cubes &gt; lubed.
        It is a bit heavier than other cubes. Rarely pops or locks up. &gt;
        Takes silicon spray lube very well, but not Rubiks.com lube. No need
        &gt; for stickers. &gt; &gt; The Rubik's Game/Challenge has Deluxe cubes
        with peg holes. I takes &gt; about 5 minutes to get used to the peg
        holes which can make for better &gt; grip. &gt; &gt; 2. The new cubes
        from Seven Towns (Rubiks.com, Hasbro, Winning Moves &gt; and Hessport)
        &gt; Comes with arched centers, can be ordered with screws as a DIY.
        These &gt; never pop. Lighter than the Deluxe, it takes rubiks.com lube
        well. &gt; Tends to lock up more than the Deluxe. They come with
        terrible &gt; stickers. Averages 1 1/2 seconds slower than Deluxe for 30
        second solve. &gt; &gt; 3. Ideal cubes circa 1980-1983. &gt; The ones
        made in Hungary, England, and Hong Kong are the best. I have &gt; heard
        that the ones made in Korea are good, too. Avoid the Taiwan- made &gt;
        cubes. These have adjustable screws, and excellent stickers. Very few
        &gt; have arches, but the arched version is the lightest official cube.
        &gt; Without arches they tend to pop instead of locking up. Averages 2
        1/2 &gt; second slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve. &gt; &gt;
        4. Rubik's studio cubes. Has the best plastic of cubes made nowadays.
        &gt; Comes with screws but not arches. Pops quite a lot. Averages nearly
        &gt; three second slower than the Deluxe for a 30 second solve. I have't
        &gt; used the three I have enough to know the sticker wear. &gt; &gt; 5.
        Older Hasbro (etc) cube (before 2000) had screws, but not arches. A &gt;
        friends older Hasbro speedcube is fairly quick, but I have little &gt;
        experience with this one. The one I have is terrible. &gt; &gt; 6.
        Wonderful Puzzler. &gt; Well made knock-off, came with arches. Never
        tried to make one into a &gt; speed cube. I don't know if they have
        screws. &gt; &gt; 7. C*4 cube &gt; Made by Matchbox in the late 80s,
        with Rubik's silkouette and &gt; signature. Lousy plastic. Not a very
        good cube. &gt; &gt; 8. Mefferts &gt; These are terrible because they
        have no pressure and you must stop a &gt; turn with effort. Constantly
        locks up. Decent plastic, but no springs &gt; or screws. &gt; &gt; There
        are lots of tiled cubes out there which are terrible, leading &gt; the
        list is the "Old Brand Magic Square" (though Stefan likes the &gt;
        springs). The only high quality tiled knock-off was called Gyro Cube,
        &gt; and it has flat centers. &gt; &gt; Regards, &gt; &gt; David J &gt;
        Hey guys, I've been wanting to get my hands on an original Deluxe tiled
        cube (or 2) for ages and haven't been able to find any apart from the
        odd sealed ones that come up on ebay an sell for $300 plus! How rare are
        these cubes and what are the centre caps like? I've got 2 Game Cubes
        that are pretty good, the only problem is that the centre caps are a
        pain to take off to adjust the screws. I've actually drilled out the peg
        holes in the caps of one to make for quick adjustment (I don't if that
        would break any competition rules) and the screws have a wider thread
        which makes adjustment a bit tedious, but apart from that they are good
        cubes. What are the crews in the Deluxe Cubes like David? Keith.

        Hi, I was just wondering what's the best way to loosen up my 4x4 cube?
        I've undone the screws about half a turn each and put a small amount of
        petrolium jelly (vaseline) in it but it's still too tight, any advice?

        You have to have a valid passport for that country (citizenship). The
        one exception is Puerto Rico because the passport for Puerto Rico is a
        United States passport. In that case, you must be born in Puerto Rico.

        &gt; Jason Kovacic &gt; Kovacic81@y... &gt; &gt; PS is CLL faster than

        correctly oriented edges before CLL, you can often achieve fast times
        with edge flipping CLL algs, simply because they're shorter and easier.
        That said, a very good deal of CLL algs are really COLL algs in
        disguise. Take whichever ones are fastest for you. For good CLL or COLL
        alg sites, speedcubing.com, Gilles Roux's site, Lars Vandenbergh's, Dan

        I have decided to switch to the ROUX method, but i am slow. I used to do
        it every once in a while, if I could see a good start. Doing a 2x3x1
        block every scramble 12 times is harder. I would like to hear from
        anybody who uses, or has experimentented with this method. WHat are your
        averages, how many CLL cases do you know? What do you use to flip the
        two edges in UF and UB? I took my first Roux avg tonight. Avg = 33.85
        Best time was 26.88. Keep in mind, I haven't learned a single CLL alg.
        So Step 3 (Corners) takes me about 6 sec. The Last 6 Edges take me about
        8-10 seconds right now, but I can cut that down to 5-6 with a little
        practice. Step 4 (Edges) is comparable to OLL/PLL. Any advice or help
        would be greatly appreciated Jason Kovacic Kovacic81@...

        see so many fast cubers &gt; &gt; when there is about zilch (nil) in
        Norway taking cubing seriously. &gt; &gt; 12 guys in the final without
        Lars Vandenbergh or Ron van Bruchem or &gt; &gt; Jo√´l van Noort in it.
        Well, that looks weird to me ... hehehe ... &gt; &gt; And a bunch of
        world and national records were set. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But im not
        really too happy with the organisation of the event. My &gt; &gt; main
        complaints are : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - should be outdoor to provide
        fairness and better atmosphere for &gt; &gt; the contestants &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; - poor result service, not very good use of the large monitor
        &gt; &gt; provided ... no info about "side events" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -
        discrimination of the "side events" - non rubiks puzles, and also &gt;
        &gt; dicrimination of these as only the winners were called, not 3rd,
        2nd &gt; &gt; and 1st like for the other events &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -
        very bad conditions for fewest moves, first day inside in a small &gt;
        &gt; room, second day even worse ... outside sitting by a small table
        &gt; &gt; only ... also first day the scramble was not provided on a
        sheet &gt; &gt; like second day ... and i really hope we can use
        stickers next &gt; &gt; time ... i always end up with cycles in the end
        .. with no stickers &gt; &gt; i can't optimise anything :-( ... i gonna
        propose changes to the &gt; &gt; rules fo fewest moves :-) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Ok, now for some positive feedback. I spoke to Dave Hedley
        Jones. I &gt; &gt; suggested some improvments for the 5x5x5 cube. And
        actually they are &gt; &gt; now doing some re-engineering, so now is a
        good time to come up with &gt; &gt; ideas for improving their puzzles
        :-) I will send Dave an email to &gt; &gt; remind him and then we will
        see how it goes ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was really great to see the

        I'm also changing my M' moves to the ring finger/ middle finger strategy
        instead of rR'. By the way, I improved that alg, it has now 8 moves ( +

        True, indeed. But its pruning tables are too small for it to do this job
        in a reasonable time -- rememember that to get a good lower bound we'd
        be looking for problems whose optimal solutions were as long as
        possible. For example, try using ACube to solve the superflip optimally
        in HTM or QTM. ;) Mike

        I've been wanting to get my hands on an original Deluxe tiled cube &gt;
        (or 2) for ages and haven't been able to find any apart from the odd
        &gt; sealed ones that come up on ebay an sell for $300 plus! How rare
        are &gt; these cubes and what are the centre caps like? &gt; &gt; I've
        got 2 Game Cubes that are pretty good, the only problem is that &gt; the
        centre caps are a pain to take off to adjust the screws. I've &gt;
        actually drilled out the peg holes in the caps of one to make for &gt;
        quick adjustment (I don't if that would break any competition rules)
        &gt; and the screws have a wider thread which makes adjustment a bit
        &gt; tedious, but apart from that they are good cubes. &gt; &gt; What
        are the crews in the Deluxe Cubes like David? &gt; &gt; &gt; Keith. Hi
        Keith, How rare are Deluxes? I have no idea how many were made. They
        turn up regularly on ebay. It is only recently that sealed Deluxes have
        gone for that much (two years ago one went for $250 but that was an
        anomaly then). In the last 2 years about 5 sealed Deluxe cubes have sold
        for less than $70. Recently bidders who nibble have been raising the
        prices (by prompting others to bid against them). Earlier this year
        three times I almost won a sealed Deluxe under $70 but warring bidders
        drove the price way up. Nibbling costs the bidders a whole lot of money
        - in England a terrible cube that retails here for $1.00 went for over
        $180. Some of the used Deluxe cubes I've gotten have no wear on them.
        They cost me between a high of $39 and a low of $6. Several recent
        auctions contained a Deluxe among other things and the seller didn't
        know what he had, and few people recognized it. The Rubik's Game cubes
        are Deluxe cubes, so the screws are the same - there are no caps, the
        screws are beneath the center tiles. However, there is way you can use
        different screws. About 15 years ago I broke the spindle of a Deluxe and
        substituted the spindle of another cube with no problem. To remove the
        tiles and get at the screws I use a very sharp 5/8 inch wood chisel
        which requires wearing work gloves. I push the edge of the chisel under
        the tile as far as it can go, which really isn't very far but is
        important, before I begin gently rocking the tile back and forth. I find
        I need to be patient, and gradually the glue lets go. :) If you can
        determine which is the correct side to try to lever up then you won't be
        working against the structure of the tile and the trough it sits in. The
        underside of the tile has two straight edges across from each other, and
        two sloped edges across from each other. These edges are twice the depth
        of the visible tile thickness, and fit neatly in the trough. The
        straight edges lay flat against the trough in the cubie, and if you try
        to lever that way you would need to bend or break the plastic of the
        tile to free it. The sloped edges are where the glue is and the right
        place to pry up because in that direction the tile will move like on a
        rocker, with no resistance. You may see slight indentations on the top
        of the tile, those are the slanted edges. Examine the center cubie that
        the tile fits in and you may see an additional way to determine which
        edges are slanted. I hope this helps. Cheers, David J

        Hi Pedro, It's a standard cube from rubiks.com. The solve was slow in
        that I wouldn't normally be making that much noise. A good solve portion
        blindfolded for me should take about 60 seconds or less. My best solves
        are about 45 seconds long. Orienting the corners was a 5-twist
        algorithm. (R U2 R' U2 R U R' U)x2 with some cube rotation. The song at
        the end... http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/llama.php The number
        scheme I use is... for corners... every corner starts off with value 1.
        If the corner has an orange sticker, add 1. If the corner has a blue
        sticker, add 2. If the corner has a yellow sticker, add 4. That'll give
        you the 8 numbers. For the edges, 1 to 12 goes... (with white on top,

        Hi:D The Eastsheens make the best 2x2x2, but they are not legal in
        seventowns-sponsored competitions like WC's. For 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 there
        are different opinions. But these days most of the fast cubers use
        rubiks.com cubes. Some however don't have the patience to break them in
        and will prefer Eastsheen here also. Some rubiks.com 5x5x5 are really
        stiff out of the box while others are "reasonable" or "fairly nice".
        Rubiks.com cubes u can buy directly from www.rubiks.com or from shops in
        many countries. For eastsheen cubes u can get them from www.puzzle-

        Yeah, he thought it was Jason Maiolo's cube (which Jason had in turn
        borrowed from Adam Zamora). However, Adam's cube was a customized Game
        cube with tiles swapped for blue opposite green. The "mystery" cube had
        the standard Game scheme of blue opposite white. So Rafael was mistaken
        about that, and I have no idea where he lives or how to contact him.

        "Top Puzzler" &gt; All -- &gt; &gt; Out of curiousity, I decided to use
        a "points system" to determine &gt; the "Top Cuber" and "Top Puzzler" at
        WC2005. I've been thinking about &gt; this as an extra category at
        competitions. &gt; &gt; **** Quick Explanation: &gt; &gt; "points
        system" = 10pts for first, 9 for second, etc, through top 10 &gt; or end
        of competitors or DNF/DNS. If final was only 8 people, I gave &gt;
        points to #9/#10 from previous round. &gt; &gt; "Top Cuber" = list
        people by most points based on cubing events listed &gt; on main stage
        (2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 3x-blind, 3x-onehand, 3x-feet, 3x- &gt; fewestmoves,
        4x-blind, 5x-blind) &gt; &gt; "Top Puzzler" = list people by ost points
        based on all events &gt; (includes "side" events aka Magic, Clock,
        Megaminx, Square1, Master &gt; Magic, 3x-speed-blindfolded,
        Magic-onehand). &gt; &gt; **** Results &gt; &gt; Top Cuber &gt;
        --------- &gt; Leyan Lo = 34 pts &gt; Chris Hardwick = 27 pts &gt; Yuki
        Hayashi = 22 pts &gt; Shotaro Makisumi = 21 pts &gt; Masayuki Akimoto =
        20 pts &gt; &gt; Leyan and Chris both placed top 10 in five events -
        very impressive! &gt; &gt; &gt; Top Puzzler &gt; ----------- &gt; Stefan
        Pochmann = 61 pts &gt; Alexander Ooms = 36 pts &gt; Leyan Lo = 34 pts
        &gt; Chris Hardwick = 31 pts &gt; Lars Vandenbergh = 30 pts &gt; &gt;
        Stefan placed in every "side" event except 3x-speedblindfold, winning
        &gt; three and placing second, third and sixth in the others - he is
        Puzzle- &gt; Man. &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll put the Excel spreadsheet on the
        site later and add the link. &gt; Enjoy the info, &gt; &gt; yeff &gt;

        for analysis/memorization doesn't count, only the twisting part does. So
        Geir usually takes around 3 hours to plan/memorize a solution using a
        normal speedsolving method (e.g. Fridrich) and then executes it
        blindfolded in about 30-40 seconds (from what I've seen in competitions
        so far). Cheers! Stefan

        In 3x-blind, you total your combined study-time and solve-time. In 3x-
        speed-blind, the cube was studied for a few hours and only the solve was
        timed. Geir Ugelstad was the only one to participate in this unique
        event, and he got 31.36 on his first attempt. He also did an encore

        Hello, At the WC, I've seen a bunch of new ideas for team solving. And I
        came up with the idea of "teamsolving" the clock. Here is a video of me
        and Alexander Ooms setting a time of 17.13 seconds. However, our best
        time was 15.11 (and a very very lucky thanks to Dan Harris 9.25 seconds)
        I thought you would like to see that. :-)

        I can't upload files larger than 5 MB so I had to split it up with
        winrar. Also the video is in the .mov format. If anyone wants to change
        the format, feel free to do so. ;-) Gilles.

        I had wondered what method Geir was using to do this. So he probably
        memorizes the sub-sequences ("this, then seqA7, then H-perm, etc") and
        then performs them blindfolded. I took a look at Tyson's 1:58 blindfold
        from NorCal 2005 - he memorized for 49 seconds, then twisted for 69
        seconds. I wonder how the "Fewest Moves" people would do in
        speed-blindfold - could they figure out the final 40-or-so move
        sequence, memorize it, then perform it in 30 or less seconds? Any FMC
        people want to give their thoughts? yeff --- In

        I averaged about 27 or so back just before I switched to CFOP again.
        Then, I didn't know any corner algs, so Step 3 was two substeps for me.
        I averaged a tad over 22 just now for an average of 30, and I haven't
        practiced the method in months, literally. That made my day. My best
        times with this method are just over 17. At present, I use COLL cases
        for the Step 3 corners, and I know all but the Bruno cases. Using the
        CLL cases instead, you can save a few moves/seconds here and there. An
        easy example is the U orientation, when all four corners are permuted
        incorrectly. I haven't learned any of the optimizations for placing
        edges or or anything fancy for Step 4, which I do using the second
        method described, if memory serves. I took an average for this step just
        now and got a bit under 6 seconds. If you work at it and learn the third
        method and some or all of the special cases, I don't see why you
        couldn't get faster than that. As for flipping UF and UB, I would orient
        them just like normal, unless the F2L happened to be finished, or only
        those two pieces incorrectly flipped, and perhaps an M slice edge
        shuffle left. In those cases, I would orient them with MUMUMU2M'UM'UM'U2
        or the appropriate ELL alg, if I saw it. Anything else would be easier
        accomplished as M'UMU'M'UM' as normal. Hope this helps. -Mike --- In

        Hey, This addresses Andy's and Alexander's Post. Great Pictures both of
        you. But Andy, one thing I couldn't help notice is that you are never
        smiling. DId anyone else notice that. I know you can smile cuz I saw
        you. And did anyone get any pictures from the time we went to downtown

        Hi all, it's cool to see a cubing community on Yahoo, and a lot of
        amazing cubers as well. I've been cubing since the end of July, and
        starting 2 weeks ago, I'm currently trying to learn the Fridrich method,
        with the 7 Sune/antisune COLL algs thrown in to replace the 57 OLL algs.
        I currently average approx. 80 seconds with the method. However, I'm
        running into problems. I want to be able to average under a minute
        within a few weeks (I know, hard!). But: 1. My F2L is 45-50 seconds on
        average, in my opinion way too long. 2. I just don't "get" how to look
        ahead in a solve! (Possible explanation for #1) I will literally pause
        for up to 3 seconds between each pair I complete. I don't plan on
        learning all 41 F2L algs for a while, and for now I know 10 of them.
        They are the ones from my old method (the vanilla layer-by-layer
        method), a couple random and more easy ones, and all the algs where the
        corner and edge are in the right slot, but not oriented correctly. This
        way, I can just connect the corner and edge, put it in the right slot,
        then do the respective algorithm. My opinion is, I should learn the 12
        algs in F2L that have the corner-edge pair connected in the U-layer so
        that I don't have to waste moves placing them in the right spot and
        solving, thus shaving time. But then again, I can't tell whether that
        would be worth it if I want to be able to solve under a minute by
        December (I average 80 seconds right now). Furthermore, with my old
        method, where I did the first layer, then did the 2nd layer, I can
        perform better. My question is, should I learn those 12 corner-edge F2L
        algs, or should I stick with what I've got and concentrate on those, or
        should I just go back to my old F2L method? Finally, how can I practice
        looking ahead in any solve?

        it was nice meeting you. I wish that &gt; I &gt; &gt; hadn't had so much

        Of course, much thanks to Ron, Tyson, judges, scramblers, and the &gt;

        &gt; And a bad news: it looks like I left my camera outside the main

        Hi friends, I had a nice talk with Fr√©d√©rick Badie during WC 2005 about
        improvements on 4x4x4. One of the subjects was avoiding the orientation
        parity, as already investigated by Chris Hardwick. I really think there
        must be an easier way to check this parity, than to count the cycles.
        Counting cycles takes quite a lot of time, because you have to follow
        all pieces around the cube. I am pretty convinced there must be an
        easier way. Something like this: Take the orientation of all edges
        according to blindfolded cubing. For each edge pair, count whether the
        single cubies are oriented according to that standard. The total number
        of flipped edge cubies must have the factor 4. I took some randomly
        scrambled cubes and it was correct, but I am sure that in fact this
        hypothesis is not correct. Factor 2 does not work (1 flipped edge pair
        has that...) Anyway, please find a counter example of the factor 4. Or
        better, please find an easy way to check the 4x4x4 orientation parity.
        Maybe you can do this with diagonal cubies or whatever? Or proof that
        the only way is to follow the cycles. Thanks and have fun, Ron

        Hi I recently picked up a Rubik's cubeafter over 20 years of not even
        seeing one. At that time I was able to do it in about 60 seconds using a
        method learned from a book. A silly question this as I know it was a
        beginners method (and there must be better methods), but I'd like to
        know what the book was. Unfortunately all I can remember is that it had
        a picture of the youngster who had written it in it or on it - maybe on
        the back, or inside cover. He was a mousey haird, slightly geeky looking
        kid :) Not much to go on, but if this rings any bells with anyone, do
        chirp up and let me know. The memory is a bad thing. I can't even get
        past the top layer :)

        Lars, I feel very sorry for you because you sat in the most gutting
        position of all, 13th place. Perhaps it should have been 16 go through
        to the finals, especially since the finals were over in about 5 minutes.
        But perhaps not, since I was sitting in 17th place ;) Even though there
        were 12 places up for grabs, you can't fit 20 very decent cubers into
        it, so it really was a lottery as to who got which places at the end of
        the semis. As we all saw, it was decided by fractions of a second. So
        Ron, Lars, Joel, Michel, Stefan, and Taka, don't feel bad about not
        making the finals because you put up a stunning performance and showed
        yourself to be among the worlds speedcubing elite. And that's definitely
        something to be proud of. See you all next time :) Dan :) --- In

        popularity. =) Congratulations to Jean, Edouard, Yuki, &gt; &gt; Frank,

        amazing how &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; times have improved since
        Toronto! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jean and Edouard put up
        impressive times in the final. I had no &gt; big &gt; &gt; &gt; mistake,
        so I have no excuse for the 16 average. They simply &gt; &gt; &gt;
        performed better under the competition condition. The funny thing &gt;
        &gt; is, &gt; &gt; &gt; Saturday night at dinner, all the Japanese
        cubers, Jean, and &gt; &gt; Edouard &gt; &gt; &gt; were racing, and the
        three of us sat in the same order as we did &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt;
        the picture of the three top finishers. I also had the &gt; opportunity
        &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; talk to Jean and Edouard a little in French
        (I'll have to &gt; practice &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a bit now). Very nice
        meeting you two! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I started listing
        everyone's name but then decided that it would &gt; &gt; take &gt; &gt;

        &gt; again; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone I hadn't met before, it was nice
        meeting you. I wish &gt; that &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; hadn't had so
        much homework to do. There were a lot of people I &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted
        to talk to, and I feel that I didn't get to do that very &gt; &gt; much.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I look forward to meeting you all again in the future.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, much thanks to Ron, Tyson,
        judges, scramblers, and the &gt; &gt; &gt; organizers for putting
        together a great competition. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And a bad
        news: it looks like I left my camera outside the main &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hey Ron, I can't prove it, but I am almost 100% convinced that counting
        the full cycles is the only way. I also tried something like looking at
        each piece in terms of BLD cubing orientation. That reason this doesn't
        work is that you can switch two pieces that are oriented the same way
        using the parity alg + center rotater (so quite literally only those two
        pieces switch) and they both appear to be oriented. For every
        orientation case you invesitate, switching exactly two edges and still
        having it look the same way in terms of orientation is possible. So this
        method cannot identify parity in all cases. I think counting cycles,
        with a year or two of practice, could be done in the 15 second
        inspection maybe as much as 75% of the time. The problem is you would
        not have a good plan for starting your solve. The solve itself would
        start very nearly like a no-inspection solve. Plus, 25% of the time you
        would be very near completing the cycles counting right as the judge
        says "put your cube down". This can't be good for a concentration zone
        or solving rhythm. My next goal, and Ron I've already mentioned this to
        you, is to use a "one parity method". After using ZBLL for a while I
        came to realize that 5/6 of the COLL cases can be viewed as having
        switched only two corners (which is odd parity if you consider the F2L
        solved and the LL face turned correctly). So what I want to do is to
        memorize for each COLL case exactly which two corners are swapped (I
        already know this for the COLL cases I know for ZBLL, I just need to
        learn it for the rest). So 5/6 of the time I will have "odd parity",
        maybe not really but from my viewpoint of considering the corners I
        will. Then I look at the edge permtutation in relation to the two
        "solved" corners and see if it is also odd. I like this because 5/6 of
        the time I check for odd permutation of edges. The 1/6 is even becase
        that is the only case where the corners are fully solved (permutation)
        in relation to eachother. So I just memorize the 1/6 cases that are even
        and in those cases check for even edge permutation. I can do it now
        already but it is very slow. However, I believe it will speed up the
        method a small amount when fully practiced and here is why: Let's
        consider just the scenario where you have OLL parity, the no OLL parity
        situation is exactly the same for the "one parity" method or whatever
        you want to call it. Regular solving: (1/2)*(15) + (1/2)*(15 + 8) = 19
        So it takes 19 moves on average to solve the OLL parity case with the
        regular method. This includes 1/2 the time just the OLL parity and 1/2
        the time also the PLL parity using Stefan Pochmann's 8 move fixer.
        One-parity solving: (1/2)*(15) + (1/2)*(15) = 15 so you save 4 moves on
        average. Here is my idea on how it affects the time too: Regular
        solving: (1/2)*(5.25+2.75) + (1/2)*(5.25) = 6.63 seconds to solve
        parities on average One-parity solving: (1/2)*(5.25) + (1/2)*(4.75) =
        5.00 seconds So you have up to 1.63 seconds to identify double parity
        without it affecting your average at all. If you spend 1.63 seconds
        every OLL parity solve just staring at your cube and not doing any
        turns, as long as you can always correctly guess double parity or not,
        then you will break even with one parity over executing 2 parity algs
        1/4 your solves. This time difference only gets better the faster you
        can execute the double parity alg. So it won't save much time, but it
        saves time. And at top level solving for any puzzle any amount of time
        saved is good. Also, on the rare easy cases where you can identify
        double parity in .5 seconds you will save up to 3 seconds off that
        solve. That's a full second in a competition mean that comes off your
        times. So it's a lot of work, for very little gain. But it's gain
        nonetheless so I think it will be worth it to learn. Plus it's something
        that ZBLL would teach you anyway, so I might as well learn it now and be
        comfortable knowing the structure of my ZBLL algs even more, having
        already memorized the corner structure of each one. In short I want to
        learn it, but I realize that it is a lot of work for very little gain. I
        feel the cycles counting method is worse though in terms of lots of work
        for a disproportional amount of gain. But then again it would be a gain,
        so maybe it is worth it, who knows? Chris --- In

        I'm not sure about all the cubes at the hotel, but the one directly

        they are already great. I used one of them while taking an average today
        and it resulted in a new average record: 17.52!! :-) This new cube isn't
        as loose as my old speedcube so I can go faster during OLL and PLL,
        without risking a POP. I'm going to re-lube the cube soon and with some
        more practice I think I'll get sub-17 quite soon. /Gunnar

        Hi Ron, There's a point in the solve where I can tell edge parity. So
        that you might picture it, generally it follows my 3x3x3 solving method.
        Solve: 1 two opposing centers (for reference call them left and right
        centers) 2 pair up four specific edge pairs (comprising the middle
        level) 3 place two middle level edge pairs 4 place four FL corners (on
        the bottom) 5 place the other two middle level edge pairs 6 pair up two
        specific edge pairs (DL and DR) Although some of what remains may be
        solved, this usually leaves me with the following still scrambled: 1
        Four centers in a line Down, Front, Up and Back 2 Six edge pairs DF UF
        UB DB UL and UR 3 Last Level corners At this point you can learn to see
        if you have and edge parity problem, and if you do turn r or l one
        quarter turn, then solve the rest with an even number of half turns.
        Have lots of fun, David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; Take the orientation of all edges according to blindfolded cubing.
        &gt; For each edge pair, count whether the single cubies are oriented

        pair has that...) &gt; &gt; Anyway, please find a counter example of the
        factor 4. &gt; &gt; Or better, please find an easy way to check the
        4x4x4 orientation &gt; parity. Maybe you can do this with diagonal
        cubies or whatever? &gt; &gt; Or proof that the only way is to follow

        I don't know if it's really necessary to memorize F2L algorithms. Once
        you know how to position a corner and its corresponding edge in order to
        place them in the first two layers, you can figure out how to reduce
        almost any other case to this position. Just play around with it for a
        while, and you'll end up knowing it without actually memorizing
        algorithms. The only F2L algorithms I actually memorized are the ones
        for cases that aren't quite so intuitive. As for looking ahead, just
        keep practicing. Eventually you'll start doing your F2L moves without
        really thinking about them, and you can use that time to start looking
        for the next F2L pair. I've dropped my cubing average from over a minute
        to low 30s without really learning any new algorithms. Shelley --- In

        &gt; I've been cubing since the end of July, and starting 2 weeks ago,
        I'm &gt; currently trying to learn the Fridrich method, with the 7 &gt;
        Sune/antisune COLL algs thrown in to replace the 57 OLL algs. I &gt;
        currently average approx. 80 seconds with the method. However, I'm &gt;
        running into problems. &gt; I want to be able to average under a minute
        within a few weeks (I &gt; know, hard!). But: &gt; 1. My F2L is 45-50
        seconds on average, in my opinion way too long. &gt; 2. I just don't
        "get" how to look ahead in a solve! (Possible &gt; explanation for #1) I
        will literally pause for up to 3 seconds between &gt; each pair I
        complete. &gt; I don't plan on learning all 41 F2L algs for a while, and
        for now I &gt; know 10 of them. They are the ones from my old method
        (the vanilla &gt; layer-by-layer method), a couple random and more easy
        ones, and all &gt; the algs where the corner and edge are in the right
        slot, but not &gt; oriented correctly. This way, I can just connect the
        corner and edge, &gt; put it in the right slot, then do the respective
        algorithm. &gt; My opinion is, I should learn the 12 algs in F2L that
        have the &gt; corner-edge pair connected in the U-layer so that I don't
        have to &gt; waste moves placing them in the right spot and solving,
        thus shaving &gt; time. But then again, I can't tell whether that would
        be worth it if I &gt; want to be able to solve under a minute by
        December (I average 80 &gt; seconds right now). &gt; Furthermore, with
        my old method, where I did the first layer, then did &gt; the 2nd layer,
        I can perform better. My question is, should I learn &gt; those 12
        corner-edge F2L algs, or should I stick with what I've got &gt; and
        concentrate on those, or should I just go back to my old F2L method?
        &gt; &gt; Finally, how can I practice looking ahead in any solve? &gt;

        &gt; I can't prove it, but I am almost 100% convinced that counting the
        &gt; full cycles is the only way. Hi, I think it is not necessary
        counting the full cycles with the 24 cubies, but we can calculate a
        combination between the cycle for the 12 pairs and the orientation for
        each 12 pairs separatly. Here's the method: Definition : Current Pair :
        Any combinations of two edges cubies. FirstEdge and SecondEdge are two
        edges cubies whith the two same colors. MyCounter values 0. I take one
        pair. It's my Current Pair. I add 1 to MyCounter. The left part of my
        Current Pair is my First Edge. The pair where my Second Edge is becomes
        the Current Pair. If the Second Edge is good oriented (according
        blindfold), I add 1 to my counter, else I add nothing. The left part of
        my Current Pair is my First Edge. The pair where my Second Edge is
        becomes the current pair. If the Second Edge is good oriented (according
        blindfold), I add 1 to my counter, else I add nothing. I do this until
        my Second Edge is on the first pair I choose at the beginning. The first
        pair must be twice the current pair. When I finish one cycle, I choose
        for current pair one pair i have not seen yet.ETC..... Until the 12
        pairs have been seen. One example: On a boy color sheme up/yellow
        face/blue. I do an "f" and a b2 move and I flip the UL and UR edges( as
        we do when we have 2 edges flipped in a blindfold resolution) . The
        parity/signature will be odd. I take the UR pair. the left part is
        yellow/orange. I add one to my counter , it values 1. The other
        yellow/orange is on the UL pair and good oriented . I add 1 to my
        counter = 2. The other UL edge is White/red. The other white/red is on
        the DL pair and not good oriented . I add nothing and my counter = 2.
        The other DL edge is Yellow/red. The other yellow/red is on the DR pair
        and not good oriented . I add nothing and my counter = 2. The other DR
        edge is Yellow/orange. The other yellow/orange is on the UR pair and
        good oriented . I add 1 and my counter = 3. My counter = 3 , so the
        parity is odd. Do this with all cycles if they are more cycle. Don't
        forget the pair already "good paired" and add 1 if it is not good
        oriented. Let's suppose the cube solved with only the UL pair flipped. I
        take this pair UL and add 1. The left part is yellow/red. the other
        yellow/red is on UL pair and not good oriented. I add nothing. The cycle
        is finish. the parity is odd. Have fun, Fr√©d√©rick.

        Hey! Like commented before, will this really save any time for a
        complete solve? Even if one determines the parity from the give scramble
        one must keep track of it from the outset if one wants to utilise the
        information. This means while doing the centers and also while pairing
        up the edges. Those clever tricks to track/eliminate the parity will
        slow down the solve, i guess more than simply solving normally and deal
        with it at the 3x3x3 stage. Well, that is my firm belief anyway. Those
        who want to prove me wrong, please do so :-) I know Chris Hardwick, Ron
        and yo Frederick at least are interested in it. My idea to deal w parity
        is to change my own cage method so that i would solve complete first
        layer then opposite layer. Then middle layers edges (with trivial inner
        layer quarter-turn parity fix) and no equivalent to the permutation
        parity of the pairing-up method. Then finally do the rest of the
        centers. One could also use empty "dedge"s on those first 2 layers while
        solving the middle layers edges. Im sure it can be fast, but a bit
        unusual :-) As for doing the last 4 centers im sure it can be fast. Once
        u reach the state where all unsolved centers are on opposite faces u
        need maximum 2 algs and u are done :-) And those algs are short. For the
        5x5x5 cube im not really that convinced that this new approach will be
        more efficient than my current approach (or the pairing-up). Cheers!

        Hey Fr√©d√©rick, I actually tried something very similar to this over my
        Christmas break in 2004. I was able to get to around 25 seconds as a
        personal fastest time, but I averaged around 40-50 seconds to do this.
        Having one or more transpositions (cycles between two edge groups only)
        slows me down terribly. I personally was not able to get this method
        under 15 seconds to identify parity. If you find a way to speed it up I
        would love to hear how to do it. I gave up on this idea though, but of

        Do this with all cycles if they are more cycle. &gt; Don't forget the

        &gt; &gt; Let's suppose the cube solved with only the UL pair flipped.

        &gt; makes even a centers first approach possible when doing middle &gt;
        laters edges last. &gt; &gt; Have fun! &gt; &gt; -Per The advantage of
        doing it this way is that you can pair up the first 3 edge groups of the
        6 left with just r/l turns and U. And finish the rest by pairing the UBl
        with the DFl edge and UBr with DFr just by doing rU2r'. The whole edge
        pairing scenario is very simple, intuitive, and best of all, fast. -Mike

        I had two books at the time, and they both must have been out in England
        before the summer of 1981 because we moved house then and I'd already
        had them by then. One of them must have been 'You Can Do The Cube'
        because that kid's face is so familiar, although I don't recoginise the
        cover - maybe an earlier edition had a different cover?? The other one
        may have been 'Mastering Rubik's Cube' by Don Taylor, because the cover
        looks familiar. Or it also may have been 'SIMPLE SOLUTION TO RUBIK'S
        CUBE' by JAMES NOURSE - also looking familiar. What I do remember is
        having an argument in the playground with this other kid who could do
        the cube (we were the only two in the whole school) He said I was
        cheating because I didn't turn the cube upside down to finish the bottom
        layer??? Maybe this gives a clue about the different methods we were
        using. For about a month we stood in the yard doing cube after cube
        after cube for all the kids who had them (everyone in 80/81 whenever it
        was). My record was 59 seconds - which hilariously enough was just
        counted out loud by my brother without any kind of watch or timing
        device. Very scientific :)

        Hi friends, Could Chris/Per/Stefan please explain why they think there
        cannot be a method other than counting cycles? I would love to see a
        proof! Or better, I would love to see a proof of a better method. :-)
        Yesterday I found a counter example of my factor 4 hypothesis: just swap
        the edge cubies UrF and URb. You have 0 flipped edge pieces, but you do
        have parity. When I started this solve the total number of flipped edge
        pieces was 14 (=parity, which was the indeed the case), so somewhere in
        the solve it changed to a factor of 4. CLL=&gt;ELL is indeed an
        interesting approach. :-) Orientation parity during F2L was an idea I
        already had, and I asked Jaap to find an algorithm for it, using his
        program. At the moment he is still on tour in Florida. :-) Stefan, I
        don't understand what you mean with your idea about dedges. Doing both
        parities in one is interesting. At the moment I use two algorithms (the
        normal one by Chris, and the double parity one by Fr√©d√©rick), but both
        twist corners because I use multislice moves. It would be great to have
        a fast algorithm that does not twist corners... It would be great to
        have a fast algorithm for the orientation parity anyhow. Yuki can do the
        parity algorithm amazingly fast. I need to train for that. :-) Is it
        true that once you solved 3 centers, you cannot change parity anymore
        when you keep these centers intact? Because then the center positions
        are fixed? In that case you only have to count the parity during the
        first three centers. Which is not a big task. Thanks and have fun, Ron

        Hi! Im not saying there isn't a way to see parity other than counting
        cycles. All i was saying is that im quite sure it wouldn't be worth the
        effort. In general im also sceptical about most kinds of
        tricks/anticipation to avoid "hard cases" later on. For that reason im
        also sceptical whether the ZB-method in one form or another can really
        be faster than pure Fridrich/CFOP. I don't think anyone has proven yet,
        timewise, the advantages of a more complex method than pure CFOP. Of
        course there are the occasional really fast solves with it, but i
        haven't seen averages with pure ZB/VH or similar that compare with the
        fastest pure CFOP averages. This could of course be simply because only
        a few people are really into zb, and also that so far they only master a
        part of it :-) I'm only happy to be proven wrong :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        I would love to see a proof of a better method. :-) &gt; &gt; Yesterday
        I found a counter example of my factor 4 hypothesis: just swap the edge
        cubies UrF and URb. You have 0 flipped edge pieces, but you do have
        parity. &gt; When I started this solve the total number of flipped edge
        pieces was 14 (=parity, which was the indeed the case), so somewhere in
        the solve it changed to a factor of 4. &gt; &gt; CLL=&gt;ELL is indeed
        an interesting approach. :-) &gt; &gt; Orientation parity during F2L was
        an idea I already had, and I asked Jaap to find an algorithm for it,
        using his program. At the moment he is still on tour in Florida. :-)
        &gt; &gt; Stefan, I don't understand what you mean with your idea about
        dedges. &gt; &gt; Doing both parities in one is interesting. At the
        moment I use two algorithms (the normal one by Chris, and the double
        parity one by Fr√©d√©rick), but both twist corners because I use
        multislice moves. It would be great to have a fast algorithm that does
        not twist corners... It would be great to have a fast algorithm for the
        orientation parity anyhow. Yuki can do the parity algorithm amazingly
        fast. I need to train for that. :-) &gt; &gt; Is it true that once you
        solved 3 centers, you cannot change parity anymore when you keep these
        centers intact? Because then the center positions are fixed? &gt; In
        that case you only have to count the parity during the first three
        centers. Which is not a big task. &gt; &gt; Thanks and have fun, &gt;

        dealing with the &gt; parities in a centers&gt;edges&gt;3x3 method: &gt;
        &gt; - Do CLL-&gt;ELL, solving both parities as part of ELL. It's an
        easy &gt; 2-look LL. &gt; &gt; - Recognize and fix orientation parity
        before solving the last F2L &gt; pair. Chris should already be able to
        recognize it since he's doing &gt; ZBF2L and it's not hard to learn
        anyway. Now we just need a fast alg &gt; that exploits the unsolved
        slot. Should be shorter/faster than what we &gt; have so far. &gt; &gt;
        - While pairing up dedges, don't flip built dedges anymore (optimally
        &gt; don't change them at all) and count flipped dedges. Then you could
        fix &gt; the parity before starting the 3x3 step. An even shorter/faster
        alg &gt; should exist. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Well, if you want to solve the edges while solving the last pair for the
        F2L, you'd have a lot more cases than the "basic" ZB-F2L. But, in the
        other hand, you'd have considerably less alg for finishing the LL
        because you'd only have to solve the corners, which is only the COLL.

        Hey Ron, You don't need to count the 24 cycles, I had forgotten about
        the 12 cycle counting method that Frederick mentioned. That can
        absolutely detect parity every time. I personally still found it very
        difficult, it is a puzzle all by itself. Using it would be like solving
        two puzzles at once on stage. You have 15 seconds to frantically (and
        yes to get to even 25 seconds I had to frantically twist my cube around)
        discover parity, which I believe couldn't be done 100% of the time (who
        can solve the 3x3x3 in under 15 seconds 100% of the time?). But on the
        times you do discover it, with training, I think tracking the parity
        during the solve would not slow you down much at all. Any double turn
        does not change parity, and I had learned how specific sequences I use
        affected parity so I didn't have to count every move. I personally think
        that noticing parity early, say whether or not the zbf2l case is parity
        or not would work. You don't have to know ZBF2L, but you could learn to
        recognize it, and all the patterns are the same so it wouldn't take much
        work. Also, something I found interesting while doing some 4x4 math
        before the tournament. Sometimes the regular parity alg is very fast for
        me, but sometimes the double is fast for me. So I would like to use both
        but still want 50-50 odds of double parity and not more. Well call the
        frequency that you use the regular parity x (0&lt;=x&lt;=1) and call the
        frequency that you use the double parity alg (1-x) the number of moves
        on average that it takes you to correct parities this way is
        (1/2)*(15x+23(1-x)) + (1/2)*(23x+15(1-x)) (1/2)*[-8x+23 + 8x +15] 19 So
        no matter the frequency you switch between the algs, you average 19
        moves to solve parities. That is the same as always using the same alg.
        This works since they are the same number of moves in length. Also about
        the centers, when I was practicing solves when I knew the parity, I
        would forget about the parity after the 4th center (but I solve the 3rd
        and 4th simultaneously always). They way I put them together I would
        correct parity if I needed to just before putting those 2 centers
        together. THe 5th and 6th solve using only conjugates which don't change
        parity. If you do solve 3 centers, and correct parity to even while
        doing so, then you can only solve in conjugates to finish the last 3,
        but yes parity wouldn't change after that. I personaly am very skeptical
        of the usefulness of coutning cycles, even with the 12 cycle method,
        since for me it was so terribly difficult to try to even get sub-30
        seconds. I think noticing during the solve might work better personalyl,
        but I am open to learning newer or better ways to detect during
        inspection. Also what about doing what I saw someone mention in an
        earlier post, why not do the OLL when you have OLL parity such that you
        end with one flipped edge only. At this point it would be very easy to
        discover if you also had PLL parity. I'm sure if we had faster algs to
        flip just that one edge to either solve OLL or OLL and PLL parity then
        this method would save time. I average about 6 seconds to do OLL parity
        with inner slices and maybe 6-7 right now with OLL + PLL aprity alg
        using just inner slices. If we can make this fast, then why not try that
        route also? We would need better algs for inner slice only though in my
        opinion. Can we get somthing with lots of r and l' moves? You could
        perform those like Bob and I do M' for the H permutation? Just some

        not twist corners... It would be great to have a fast algorithm for the

        fast. I need to train for that. :-) &gt; &gt; Is it true that once you

        Hey Ron, One last thing, I didn't address your one question. I think
        some sort of cycle-ish strategy will be required, since you can switch
        two edge pieces literally without affecting anything else, not even
        centers. That seems like it would be very hard to detect in any type of
        orientation method for finding parity. Two edges can be switched that
        were both oriented that would still appear to be oriented. Just the
        sheer complexity of it seems to have to require at least the 12 cycle
        counting method. Again I have no idea how to prove that, but it seems
        like some sort of cycling has to be done. Just my hunch though :-( Chris

        Hi Stefan, I will try your idea about dedges. Yeah, I use that
        algorithm! Do you happen to know a similar algorithm (without inner
        slice moves) for the other orientation parity algorithm that preserves
        the corner twists and doesn't solve the permutation parity? We need a
        good 4x4 solver! Even with ACube4 I cannot find the algorithms. :-(
        ACube4 works well for other stuff. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message

        &lt;ron@s...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; Stefan, I don't understand what you
        mean with your idea &gt; about dedges. I meant that while you pair up
        the dedges, you count how many are oriented wrong, just like you'd count
        how many are wrong for 3x3 blindsolving. Somehow you'd need to take care
        that the dedges you've built and counted don't get flipped while
        building the remaining dedges. How about doing OLL + OrientationParity
        in one go? Chris already shows some setup moves for the parity fixer on
        his webpage. With a few more algs and more setup moves doing OLL
        including parity fix in one go seems not too bad to me. Oh, and try this
        alg (Frederick's alg with setup move) for just flipping one edge and
        swapping two corners: R' (Rr)2 B2 (Rr)' U2 (Rr)' U2 B2 (Rr)' B2 (Rr) B2
        (Rr)' B2 (Rr)2 B2 U2 R Cheers! Stefan

        I haven't read all the messages about the subject but I will give you my
        thought about the parity problems. I think that the easiest way to deal
        with them if to solve the cube until you arrive at the OLL. If the OLL
        exist, just do it and then if the PLL exist do it, or if it doesn't
        exist do the parity problem( for PLL) and do the PLL. On the case where
        the OLL doesnt exist you orient all exept one edge. Then you look if the
        PLL exist or not. If it does, do the parity problem (for OLL) and finish
        by the PLL. If the PLL doesn't exist do the arity problem (which fix
        both parity problem) and end with the PLL. I think this is not too
        difficult after some practice and you always do one algs for parity or
        zero. The only think wghich is not very good if that you have to do the
        parity algs with the inner slices which is a little slower. What do yiou
        think of that? --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Stefan

        Yes, I know those are the figures listed on Zbigniew's site and I think
        they are wrong. Since the total of the first column adds up to 300, the
        figures he lists should include the solved cases, so the figure for the
        LL should be 494. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Evan

        I just bought two cubes at Target, they were actually $7 since there was
        a sale (orig. $10), but these cubes are really bad! They're the 25th
        anniversary type, with the shiny white stickers. I'm really frustrated,
        as I've actually slid playing cards into all the slots and kept them
        there for a couple hours, and now I'm putting cards to try stretching
        the springs too. If doing this, then lubing the cube (for a 2nd time)
        doesn't work out (so far, it's better, but not much), then I'm just
        gonna return the other one. Do cubes of the same brand and type vary in
        quality, or are all of the 25th anniversary ones poor like this? I ask
        because the first cube I bought was $14, and it was also a 25th
        anniversary edition, but the white face was not shiny, it was pure
        white. I gotta say, it was also about 100 times better for speedcubing,
        all I had to do was apply silicone spray, and it was a bona fide
        speedcube. I actually found a site online where they sell that exact
        same type (the good one). Should I buy that kind exclusively? Or is
        there any other type that's even better for speedcubing? It's just
        frustrating to deal with this cube that's so poor for speedcubing.

        all those cubes vary in quality.. some are looser, some are tighter,
        some have more even spring tension some don't. but cubes usually take
        time to break in and get looser.. to get into the speedcubing

        I got this response from my brother about your problem with his program:
        "What operating system is he running? I would recommend downloading and
        installing the latest Java SDK which is much bigger then the JRE and
        allows him to compile and run the program on his own machine. Then he
        should download and install the cube program again. If he still has
        problems, I can help further." Hope that helps. Ian --- In

        I'm not sure you answered the question I was asking, and I probably
        wasn't clear about it. What I was trying to say was, say I take the
        exact brand, say, the Oddzon Rubik's cube. Then say out of 100 of that
        exact cube, would the quality be the same (low) quality among all 100,
        or would there be some great ones, some okay ones, and some bad ones
        among them? I want to know if within one specific type, the quality
        varies. Or if we know that overall, all Oddzon cubes are bad and all
        Studio cubes are good. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        You're not alone. I have had very bad luck with all the cubes commonly
        available on the market today. To my knowledge, there are four: 1) 25th
        AV with white stickers, hexagon package 2) 25th AV with white stickers,
        on card 3) 25th AV with silver stickers, on card 4) a few leftover
        Oddzon cubes with a non-anniversary sticker. Of the first three, I have
        bought and bought and bought. Only about 1/4 of the ones I buy are
        acceptable for speedcubing with minimal preparation. The other 3/4 are
        so tight and uneven that I give up any hope of breaking them in. So no,
        I do not find that any one of the three is any better on average than
        the others. I have a small sample size on #4 (one cube) but it was so
        tight I could barely turn it. You'd think silicone would save the day,
        but it made it even WORSE. I've heard at least two posters say that if
        you are willing to work with tight cubes for long enough, eventually
        they will get looser. As for me, I try to find a store with a liberal
        return policy, because I can't wait that long! &gt; --- In

        really frustrated, as I've actually slid playing cards into all the &gt;

        &gt; &gt; cards to try stretching the springs too. If doing this, then
        lubing &gt; &gt; the cube (for a 2nd time) doesn't work out (so far,
        it's better, &gt; but &gt; &gt; not much), then I'm just gonna return
        the other one. &gt; &gt; Do cubes of the same brand and type vary in
        quality, or are all of &gt; the &gt; &gt; 25th anniversary ones poor
        like this? I ask because the first cube &gt; I &gt; &gt; bought was $14,
        and it was also a 25th anniversary edition, but the &gt; &gt; white face
        was not shiny, it was pure white. I gotta say, it was &gt; also &gt;
        &gt; about 100 times better for speedcubing, all I had to do was apply
        &gt; &gt; silicone spray, and it was a bona fide speedcube. &gt; &gt; I
        actually found a site online where they sell that exact same type &gt;
        &gt; (the good one). Should I buy that kind exclusively? Or is there any
        &gt; &gt; other type that's even better for speedcubing? It's just &gt;
        frustrating &gt; &gt; to deal with this cube that's so poor for
        speedcubing. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Any normal Rubik's brand cube you can buy at a store these days that has
        relatively even tension on the sides will be a great cube if you're
        willing to wear it in enough. The only cube I've had for good
        speedcubing was tight and terrible out of the package. I played with it
        for a few weeks before lubing it, doing a lot of grinding solves. Then,
        I slipped plastic butter knives under the faces to loosen the tension on
        a few sides. More grinding solves. Then lube. Lots and lots of lube. I
        use silicon spray, but your preference may vary. Several people at

        Agreed =) DIY cubes are nice as well. eventually, these pre- assembled
        cubes will get too loose and pop too much.. but i think DIY cubes will
        give you more flexibility in adjusting the tightness.. =) but i'm not
        sure, since i haven't used one before.. i still have one waiting to be
        assembled =X I personally think that the tighter cubes are better when
        compared to the loose ones.. i had one with a blue side that was just
        hanging loose (when i took it apart, the blue center piece had no
        tension).. can't speedcube with it.. the blue side would overturn! poor
        manufacturing process! anyway.. i think those tighter ones are nice cuz
        they give that "new cube" feeling =D as long as the spring tension is
        even, and it's not unbearably tight.. it gives me the feeling they'll
        last longer haha but yeah, they should be the same.. although the studio
        cubes are supposed to be superb.. they're supposed to have proper
        tension etc. and you can adjust it.. but i can't really say cuz i've
        never used one before Darren Kwong --- In

        Oh, and from my observations.. it seems that they keep degrading in
        quality! As the newer ones come out, the quality is worse and worse.. My
        pre-anniversary edition cube is great... it has flat centers... but you
        can tell-the plastic is sturdier, thicker.. more even surfaces.. the
        corners don't have the stupid caps that let water leak in--they're
        visible but sealed.. horrible.. the old ones are much better... the
        white anniversary ones had the problems described above.. and the silver

        Hi everyone, For all those people who took pictures at the WC2005 or
        know people who did, I would like to make an extensive gallery on my
        webpages dedicated to making the most complete and detailed picture of
        what being at the event was like for everyone. If you can mail pictures
        to wc2005pics_at_cubestation.co.uk I would be very grateful, or you
        could add me to MSN: university_dan_at_hotmail.com or Yahoo!: hatadey -
        and file transfer them to me that way. Once I get my website back up and
        running properly, I plan to make a lot of updates, including: Pictures
        from WC2005 and report. Media from Dutch Cube Day Media from Hungarian
        Championships (which I will be attending) Media from Puzzle meeting on
        December 3rd (which I am hosting) Regenerated Profiles section
        Regenerated Links Section Regenerated FMC More ZB Stuff More methods
        stuff Videos from TV appearances and other cube vids. So check back
        soon! DanH :)

        Hello, Anyone from Indiana cubing? I feel like I am the only one in Ft.
        Wayne that enjoys cubing, anyone even in Indiana? I am not extremely
        fast yet. About 2 months ago when I decided to try to actually solve
        fast I was lucky to solve in about 5min usually was 10. Then I tried a
        few actual methods, instead of my own, and got to a consistent 3-4min, I
        have combined 2 forms and now average about 1:15 and will soon be under
        a min on my way to 30,20sec...who knows. I think it would be easier and
        more fun if I had someone to cube with. Let me know. Eric

        more Roux method resources! :D The sites are all flooded with fridrich.
        Could also do with some tips from the pro's :) I also noticed Gilles,

        encrease the speed for a reply (in blitz) you have to learn how to
        manipulate the knobs on the keyboard, which more reminds on cubing than
        on chess. Blitz should be played with heavy, wooden pieces, where halv
        the victory is won by looking the opponent in his eys as saying: you are
        a fool! Moreover, I havn¬¥t yet got my broad band and staying on line is
        too expensive for a poor man. Are my excuses too transparent? R PS. But

        infinite computation to be done in finite time (from the point of view
        of the observer) so that for instance problems like the Goldbach
        Conjecture could be proven (even if true) by thrashing them out, one
        case at a time. Conceivably this could be used to solve the cube
        quickly. In the infinite context (which I assume is countably infinite),
        the energy in the signal sent back by the slave would kill the master as
        it arrived so he'd only know the answer instantaneously but the cube is
        a finite problem so maybe this would be a theoretical method to get an
        optimal solution back and hence solve the cube in a really short time
        with only partial damage to the solver! Probably not too practicable.

        the cube normally, but pressing inward very hard on all of the faces as
        you turn them. Basically, you want each bit of the cube that rotates
        against another part to wear as much as possible in its natural pattern.

        For those of you familiar with Myers-Briggs type - what personality
        types do you think would be most drawn to speedcubing? My guess is that
        the prototypical cuber would be ISTP or INTP. I think it would be harder
        for an F or J to learn cubing, because I'd think being able to analyze
        and adapt are primo considerations. I'm also thinking S's would be more
        interested in speed per se, whereas N's would be more interested in the
        mathematics of the cube and the like. In my adult life I seem to have
        'gelled' as an ISTP. I was ISFP but after working in the business world
        for about 5 years, I got all hard 'n' crusty. :P If you don't know your

        Actually, just the other day I found out they have full-blown world
        championships for RPS. Check out www.worldrps.com for some stuff about
        strategies and whatnot. At first, I was like "RPS? That's pretty wacky!"
        Then I realized that we all solve rubik's cubes as fast as we can, which
        outsiders view as crazy as RPS. I think it would be kinda cool if cubers
        started getting into RPS like they do cupstacking. Congrats Craig for
        winning the competition! -Chris Parlette --- In

        Well ofcourse i dont care but you MAKE me listen by buzzing like hell on
        yahoo messenger. :D Im just kidding, Its nice that finally you are going
        to learn Fridrich, now im worried that you'll get still faster than me.
        I remember the days when i was at 40 seconds and you were at 60. Now im
        on 35 and ur on 30!!! Best of luck on ur quest, and hope you make that
        sub-20 in two weeks :) Sachin. On 11/15/05, Craig Bouchard

        on locking myself in a room for a &gt; few hours and tackling Fridrich,

        out...then I'll practice like crazy...and &gt; in two weeks time you
        will see me posting sub-20 times :p &gt; &gt; And I would also like to
        announce that I have switched the way I do my &gt; 4LLL. Alexander
        taught me a PLL corner 3Cycle, and so I don't do &gt; corner perm
        first...i now do CO,EO,CP,EP...i like it and it will help &gt; once I
        get to 2LLL...I guess those sub-20 times won't be in 2 &gt; weeks...cuz
        I'll have learn OLL and PLL first, maybe I'll learn 3LLL &gt;
        first...but still, my times will "hopefully" drop a bit until I learn
        &gt; 2LLL...but just thought I'd let everyone know, and now everyone
        will &gt; know why I am not here all day saturday, although I am such a
        &gt; procrastinator and have been wanting to learn fridrich since august
        &gt; and before WC...but it didn't happen...I REALLY wanna learn it &gt;
        tho...so I am hoping this weekend :) &gt; &gt; I'll Shut up now... &gt;

        Interesting! I would not have expected J's to be as common as they
        appear to be at this point. Quick primer: basically the MBTI
        (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) divides personality types into 4 "one or
        the other" scales, for a total of 16 combinations: * I (introvert) vs. E
        (extravert): pretty self-explanatory. * S (sensing) vs. N (intuition):
        Sensors are more concrete and detail- oriented; iNtuitives are more
        big-picture oriented. * T (thinking) vs. F (feeling): Thinkers tend to
        be more objective, Feelers more subjective. Basically are you more of a
        head person or a heart person. * J (judging) vs. P (perceiving): Has
        nothing to do with being judgmental or perceptive. Judgers tend to be
        better with structure and schedules; Perceivers tend to be better with
        the lack thereof. So maybe the N means you're better at seeing the whole
        cube as a whole, and the J is great for the structured logic of the cube
        and planning ahead. As an S, too often I'm thinking, "oh cool! that
        square is orange!" and as a P: "I think I'll do this next. No, how about
        this. No, that...wait, what was I doing??" INTJ's often make great
        scientists, so it looks like the cube is right up their alley. See if
        this description fits you: http://www.typelogic.com/intj.html --- In

        Well congrats Craig, but i still think that RPS is more of luck than
        anything else. Ofcourse if you do some psychologic studies or something
        and try to figure out what the other person is going to give maybe that
        can work, but that is too far fetched. And about the world chapms i
        think its totally silly. It can in no way be compared to our cubing
        champs. After all the amout of luck involved in ours is much much less
        than for the RPS type. And Craig dont let out whats ur favourite, maybe
        someone at your schoolo maybe reading this and you'l be dethroned of
        your championship status in the next comp :) Sachin. On 11/15/05,

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Btw i've noticed all the posts above me do contain some
        amount of &gt; &gt; introversy. So does that mean we all cubers are
        introverts to a large &gt; &gt; extent? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sachin. &gt;

        Myers-Briggs type - what personality &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; types do you
        think would be most drawn to speedcubing? My guess is &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; that the prototypical cuber would be ISTP or INTP. I think it would
        &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harder for an F or J to learn cubing,
        because I'd think being able &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyze and
        adapt are primo considerations. I'm also thinking S's &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; would be more interested in speed per se, whereas N's would be more
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the mathematics of the cube and the
        like. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my adult life I seem to

        I've done Myers-Briggs many times and I'm an INFJ. As a mathemetician I
        agree that N's are more likely to be interested in the maths side (than
        S's are!) but doesn't stop us being competitive! I think J's tend to be
        more thoughtful and since a lot of cubing is in the preparation I don't
        see why there should be any particular preference for P or J. The most
        obvious preferenve would be a T over an F I suppose. I'me quite evenly
        balanced on these but always come out with a slight F preference. Duncan

        I'm the competitive type... Hmm...how exactly do you get good at rock
        paper scissors? I've heard there are people who are really good at it (I
        guess like you) but I'm still confined to the luck idea. I'd definitely
        like to know if there is some kind of strategy behind it. (Oh, and I do
        find small games fun. :-)) Vincent On 14/11/05, Craig Bouchard

        Looks like I'm INTP. Respectively 22, 12, 25, 22. All I can say is that
        it surely means I spend waaaaaay too much time doing useless stuff while
        I should be at work. Nah. Fran√ßois Duncan Dicks a √©crit : &gt; I've done
        Myers-Briggs many times and I'm an INFJ. As a mathemetician I &gt; agree
        that N's are more likely to be interested in the maths side &gt; (than
        S's &gt; are!) but doesn't stop us being competitive! I think J's tend
        to be more &gt; thoughtful and since a lot of cubing is in the
        preparation I don't see &gt; why &gt; there should be any particular
        preference for P or J. The most obvious &gt; preferenve would be a T
        over an F I suppose. I'me quite evenly &gt; balanced on &gt; these but
        always come out with a slight F preference. &gt; &gt; Duncan &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INTJ's often make great scientists, so it looks like

        you: &gt; &gt; http://www.typelogic.com/intj.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Hmm...I read a few of the types on the page. So far, it seems that I
        &gt; fit a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little bit of each that I've read. I
        guess it's supposed to be like that &gt; &gt; though, I just fit the
        most in INTJ. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is pretty interesting. I'll read
        about the rest of the other types &gt; &gt; once &gt; &gt; I have more

        does that mean we all cubers are introverts to a large &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those of you familiar with Myers-Briggs type -
        what &gt; personality &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; types do you think would
        be most drawn to speedcubing? My guess is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that
        the prototypical cuber would be ISTP or INTP. I think it &gt; would &gt;
        &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harder for an F or J to learn cubing,
        because I'd think being able &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        analyze and adapt are primo considerations. I'm also thinking S's &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be more interested in speed per se, whereas
        N's would be &gt; more &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the
        mathematics of the cube and the like. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; In my adult life I seem to have 'gelled' as an ISTP. I
        was &gt; ISFP but &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after working in the business
        world for about 5 years, I got all &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard 'n'
        crusty. :P &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you
        don't know your type, take the test at: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I'll try to address everyone: Stefan - First competition 32 people, I
        think 6 rounds... Other people (sorry can't remember the name) - I don't
        have a favourite...I study my opponents. My first round opponent, a guy
        in my class who has been a rival of mine for about 5 years, I tricked
        into thinking I go paper every time, and then I went rock on his
        scissors...Destroyed him...There is some lucky, and noticing people's
        patterns or what they are going to throw. It is also knowing the
        person... Craig --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Stefan

        I've done Myers-Briggs many times and I'm an INFJ. As a mathemetician I
        &gt; &gt; agree that N's are more likely to be interested in the maths
        side &gt; &gt; (than S's &gt; &gt; are!) but doesn't stop us being
        competitive! I think J's tend to be more &gt; &gt; thoughtful and since
        a lot of cubing is in the preparation I don't see &gt; &gt; why &gt;
        &gt; there should be any particular preference for P or J. The most
        obvious &gt; &gt; preferenve would be a T over an F I suppose. I'me
        quite evenly &gt; &gt; balanced on &gt; &gt; these but always come out
        with a slight F preference. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Duncan &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; INTJ's often make great scientists, so it looks like the cube is
        &gt; &gt; &gt; right up their alley. See if this description fits you:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.typelogic.com/intj.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Hmm...I read a few of the types on the page. So far, it seems
        that I &gt; &gt; fit a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little bit of each
        that I've read. I guess it's supposed to be like that &gt; &gt; &gt;
        though, I just fit the most in INTJ. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
        is pretty interesting. I'll read about the rest of the other types &gt;
        &gt; &gt; once &gt; &gt; &gt; I have more time - I have a bio lab due

        Could anyone tell me what excatly this means? I got a slight idea that
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it says im 13rd introvert, quite a bit intutive, lil
        feelings and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again quite perceving. I think maybe
        thats right for me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Btw i've
        noticed all the posts above me do contain some amount of &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; introversy. So does that mean we all cubers are introverts to a
        large &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those of you familiar with
        Myers-Briggs type - what &gt; &gt; personality &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; types do you think would be most drawn to speedcubing? My guess is
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the prototypical cuber would be ISTP
        or INTP. I think it &gt; &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; harder for an F or J to learn cubing, because I'd think
        being able &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyze and
        adapt are primo considerations. I'm also thinking S's &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; would be more interested in speed per se, whereas N's
        would be &gt; &gt; more &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the
        mathematics of the cube and the like. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my adult life I seem to have 'gelled' as an
        ISTP. I was &gt; &gt; ISFP but &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after
        working in the business world for about 5 years, I got all &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard 'n' crusty. :P &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I'm INTJ as well. But I don't have the specific results, I took it a
        &gt; &gt; couple &gt; &gt; months ago at some other site. &gt; &gt; All
        i know is that I'm REALLY I, just barely N over S, REALLY T, and an &gt;
        &gt; alright amount J over P &gt; &gt; -E &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On

        &gt; &gt; &gt; INTJ's often make great scientists, so it looks like the

        fits you: &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.typelogic.com/intj.html &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm...I read a few of the types on the page. So far,
        it seems that I &gt; &gt; fit a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little bit
        of each that I've read. I guess it's supposed to be like that &gt; &gt;
        &gt; though, I just fit the most in INTJ. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        This is pretty interesting. I'll read about the rest of the other types
        &gt; &gt; &gt; once &gt; &gt; &gt; I have more time - I have a bio lab

        &gt; Could anyone tell me what excatly this means? I got a slight idea

        think maybe thats right for me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Btw i've noticed all the posts above me do contain some amount of &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; introversy. So does that mean we all cubers are
        introverts to a large &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those of you familiar with
        Myers-Briggs type - what &gt; &gt; personality &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; types do you think would be most drawn to speedcubing? My guess is
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the prototypical cuber would be ISTP
        or INTP. I think it &gt; &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; harder for an F or J to learn cubing, because I'd think
        being able &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyze and
        adapt are primo considerations. I'm also thinking S's &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; would be more interested in speed per se, whereas N's
        would be &gt; &gt; more &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the
        mathematics of the cube and the like. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my adult life I seem to have 'gelled' as an
        ISTP. I was &gt; &gt; ISFP but &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after
        working in the business world for about 5 years, I got all &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard 'n' crusty. :P &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Myers-Briggs many times and I'm an INFJ. As a &gt; mathemetician I &gt;
        &gt; &gt; agree that N's are more likely to be interested in the maths
        side &gt; &gt; &gt; (than S's &gt; &gt; &gt; are!) but doesn't stop us
        being competitive! I think J's tend to &gt; be more &gt; &gt; &gt;
        thoughtful and since a lot of cubing is in the preparation I don't &gt;
        see &gt; &gt; &gt; why &gt; &gt; &gt; there should be any particular
        preference for P or J. The most &gt; obvious &gt; &gt; &gt; preferenve
        would be a T over an F I suppose. I'me quite evenly &gt; &gt; &gt;
        balanced on &gt; &gt; &gt; these but always come out with a slight F
        preference. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Duncan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        alright amount J over P &gt; &gt; &gt; -E &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INTJ's often make great scientists, so it
        looks like the cube is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right up their alley. See if
        this description fits you: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Hmm...I read a few of the types on the page. So far, it seems &gt;
        that I &gt; &gt; &gt; fit a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        little bit of each that I've read. I guess it's supposed to be &gt; like
        that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though, I just fit the most in INTJ. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is pretty interesting. I'll read
        about the rest of the &gt; other types &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I have more time - I have a bio lab due tomorrow that
        I've been &gt; &gt; &gt; postponing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; all day. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vincent &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Could anyone tell me what excatly this means? I got a slight &gt;
        idea that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it says im 13rd introvert, quite a
        bit intutive, lil feelings &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again quite
        perceving. I think maybe thats right for me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Btw i've noticed all the posts above me do
        contain some amount &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introversy. So does
        that mean we all cubers are introverts to &gt; a large &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; extent? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; For those of you familiar with Myers-Briggs type - what &gt; &gt;
        &gt; personality &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; types do you think
        would be most drawn to speedcubing? My &gt; guess is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; that the prototypical cuber would be ISTP or INTP. I
        think &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harder for an F or J to learn cubing, because I'd
        think &gt; being able &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; analyze and adapt are primo considerations. I'm also &gt;
        thinking S's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be more interested
        in speed per se, whereas N's &gt; would be &gt; &gt; &gt; more &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the mathematics of the cube and
        the like. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; In my adult life I seem to have 'gelled' as an ISTP. I was
        &gt; &gt; &gt; ISFP but &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after working
        in the business world for about 5 years, I &gt; got all &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard 'n' crusty. :P &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you don't know your type,

        Hey everybody, I was just reading some stuff about commutators, and I
        found an interesting one (not by myself, I found it in a document): RBLF
        U F'L'B'R' U' Maybe an interesting way for beginners to insert a middle
        layer edge... Easy to remember :). Anyway, the question is about how to
        explain why this commutator works. In the document, there was a
        defenition, the support of P, supp(P), is defined as the set of all
        pieces that are effected by algorithm P. The proposition was, if the
        overlap of supp(P) and supp(Q) is only 1 piece, than PQP'Q' will be a
        three cycle. Now I understand why this works for P = R'D2R and Q = U.
        But I can't see why this is a way to explain the RBLF U F'L'B'R' U'
        three cycle :(. To me, it looks like RBLF effects the whole cube... Can
        anyone please explain this to me? Maybe I got the defenition of SUPP(P)
        wrong, or something :(... Tnx, Joel.

        I've been doing the 2x2x2 a bit lately and average around 6-7 seconds
        using Guimond. Now I'm seriously considering switching from my 4 LL-look
        Fridrich to a CF method. I'm mostly looking at a pure CF method so that
        I can practice the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 at the same time using my current
        corners system. What I'm now is asking for is some suggestions regarding
        solving the edges. So far my idea has been to finish two 1x2x3 blocks
        after the corners. This way I'll be left with a classical CF/Roux ending
        which is nice.At the moment though I'm solving the 6 edges for the two
        1x2x3's one by one, which takes a little over 20 moves and to much time
        on average. Any suggestions on how to lower the number of moves and
        steps here, without reaching a ZB number of algorithms? Any other
        tips/suggestions? /Gustav

        Well to me also the cube looks scrambled after doing RBLF, but look
        closely and u'll see that on the top layer, all the corners are in their
        original positions only, only their orientation is affected...that too
        each one is rotated clockwise. And since the middle move is a U, we dont
        care what the rest part of the cube is like, since it'll get arranged
        anyway. So when you do a U move now, the top corners get rotated but
        since their relative position and orientation is the same, they will get
        arranged to their orig. config when u do the reverse moves F"L"B"R". The
        only thing remainin is the edges, those are the one which get affected
        as we want. Hope i could explain what i understood :) Sachin. On

        learn cubing, because I'd think being able to &gt; analyze and adapt are
        primo considerations. I'm also thinking S's &gt; would be more
        interested in speed per se, whereas N's would be more &gt; interested in
        the mathematics of the cube and the like. &gt; &gt; In my adult life I
        seem to have 'gelled' as an ISTP. I was ISFP but &gt; after working in

        So by saying his favorite is scissors he works it out that he thinks his

        Well, if my opponents choices were truly random, then my strategy
        wouldn't matter at all. If I can detect a pattern in my opponents
        choices, then I can try to predict what he will show and pick something
        to beat him. Alternatively, I could try to fool my opponent by making
        choices that appear to have a pattern. And just when I think he has
        figured out the pattern and is about to counter successfully, I could
        change the pattern to beat him. Perhaps a good strategy for a tournament
        would be to memorize a "one time pad", or a sequence of truly random
        choices that no one knows about. If you used those choices in a
        tournament, no one could have an advantage over you. On the downside,
        you wouldn't have an advantage over anyone else, either. On 11/15/05,

        I thought the section about mental preferences was really interesting.
        The fact that rock is seen as more aggressive and paper as more passive.
        Unless you were really good at reading your opponent, or knew their
        history, I imagine it is mostly random chance, but maybe more like this:
        rock 40% scissors 36% paper 24% or something like that. So maybe it
        isn't 1/3 odds across the board, but more weighted to your preferences
        to the throws under pressure. Chris --- In

        RPS is not random at all because it is two /people/ playing against one
        another. In order to have competed in the RPS World Championship, you
        must have competed in a smaller event. This makes it so that every
        competitor at the world championship has past RPS data that other
        competitors can study. I guess people really good at RPS memorize their
        competitor's tendencies instead of algorithms. Playing mind games is the
        key so that you can get your opponent in their defensive state (which
        you studied before hand) and control the game! :) -Chris On 11/15/05,

        interesting one (not by myself, I found it in a document): &gt; &gt;
        RBLF U F'L'B'R' U' &gt; &gt; Maybe an interesting way for beginners to
        insert a middle layer &gt; edge... Easy to remember :). &gt; &gt;
        Anyway, the question is about how to explain why this commutator &gt;
        works. In the document, there was a defenition, the support of P, &gt;
        supp(P), is defined as the set of all pieces that are effected by &gt;
        algorithm P. The proposition was, if the overlap of supp(P) and &gt;
        supp(Q) is only 1 piece, than PQP'Q' will be a three cycle. Now I &gt;
        understand why this works for P = R'D2R and Q = U. But I can't see why
        &gt; this is a way to explain the &gt; RBLF U F'L'B'R' U' three cycle
        :(. To me, it looks like RBLF effects &gt; the whole cube... Can anyone
        please explain this to me? Maybe I got &gt; the defenition of SUPP(P)
        wrong, or something :(... &gt; &gt; Tnx, &gt; &gt; Joel. &gt; Let x be
        the common piece of the support. Clearly for any piece z which is
        neither in supp(P) nor supp(Q), zPQP'Q'=zQP'Q'=zP'Q'=zQ'=z. There is
        some piece y with yP=x and some piece t with xQ=t. Clearly y is in
        supp(P) and t is in supp(Q). Moreover, x, y and t are all distinct (if
        x=y then x is not in supp(P), if x=t then x is not in supp(Q) and it y=t
        then this piece is also in supp(P) and supp(Q) so it has more than one
        piece). Note that yPQP'Q'=xQP'Q'=tP'Q'=tQ'=x (because t is not in
        supp(P)). For any piece w in supp(P) other than y, wP is not x (and
        hence is not in supp(Q)). Thus wP=wPQ and so wPQP'=w, whence wPQP'Q'=w
        (unless w=x). Thus PQP'Q' fixes all elements of supp(P) except y and x.
        (It can't fix x, otherwise x=xPQP'Q'yPQP'Q' implies y=x.) Let h=xP. Note
        h is in supp(P) and h isn't x (lest x is fixed by P and x is not in
        supp(P)) so h is not in supp(Q) - i.e. hQ=h. Thus
        xPQP'Q'=hQP'Q'=hP'Q'=xQ'=t. t=xQ' is in supp(Q) (t=(xQ^k)Q for some k)
        but t isn't x so t isn't in supp(P), i.e. tP=t. Thus
        tPQP'Q'=tQP'Q'=xQ'QP'Q'=xP'Q'=yQ'=y. Note tPQ=yQP=yP (as y is not in
        supp(Q))=x. Now let s be any element of supp(Q) other than t and x. Thus
        s is not in supp(P) and so sP=s. Since s is not t, we have sPQ isn't
        tPQ=x. Thus as sPQ is in supp(Q) but isn't x it is not in supp(P) and
        sPQP'=sPQ, so that sPQP'Q'=sPQQ'=sP=s and s is fixed. Thus PQP'Q' fixes
        all pieces other than t,x and y and further it moves y to x, x to t and
        t to y. So PQP'Q' is a 3-cycle.

        I've been looking around on Josef's page before and the Advanced/Ortega
        way of dealing with edges is pretty straightforward. I'll experiment
        with this more basic approach first though as I need to get some

        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;solving the edges. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;So far my idea has
        been to finish two 1x2x3 blocks after the corners. &gt;&gt;This way I'll
        be left with a classical CF/Roux ending which is nice.At &gt;&gt;the
        moment though I'm solving the 6 edges for the two 1x2x3's one by
        &gt;&gt;one, which takes a little over 20 moves and to much time on
        average. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Any &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;suggestions on how
        to lower the number of moves and steps here, without &gt;&gt;reaching a

        The traditional answer would be that it depends on the way the program
        checks when a cube is solved. Like if it compares it to something
        designated solved then all you'd have to do is manually change that.
        However that would require going into the source code. Moreover, I'm
        thinking that you want to be able to change the goal state as an option
        as well. Now thinking outside the box (or cube)... I'm going to apply a
        little bit of algbra here. Call your starting state A. Then what a
        program does is find an optimal A^(-1). Say f(x) = x^(-1), but optimally
        so. Then to get to the identity (solved state) you'd go A*f(A) = 1
        (where we are composing in our usual sence/direction... it's actaully
        the other direction in most conventions, but then all our algs would
        have to be read backwards). So now say we have a goal state B. Then
        f(B^(-1)*A) should do the trick. Since A*f(B^(-1)*A) = A*A^(-1)*B = B
        (since inversion reverses order). Thus I assert that all that needs to
        be done is to have a pre-parser that takes A and B and passes B^(-1)*A
        into the program. This would then be a fairly routine cs exercise. It
        makes sence right? Also this should work for greyed-out stickering
        possiblities as well. -Doug (really, really behind on posts :(, sorry)

        question for your programmers. Would it be hard to take an &gt; existing
        solver program (Ron's solver program, ACube, etc..) and &gt; manually
        specify the desired final state rather than have it be &gt; assumed to
        be the solved state? &gt; &gt; I was looking for good transformation
        algs from any OLL case into the &gt; "T" orientation and thought that
        such a solver could come in handy. &gt; &gt; My method right now is just
        to start from the T and do the inverse of &gt; various easy and fast
        moves that leave the edges oriented and when I &gt; end up at an
        orientation I didn't know the transformation for yet I &gt; would then
        know which alg I used to go from the T to that case, so I &gt; can just
        do the reverse. &gt; &gt; Anyway I have no idea if a program feature
        like that is hard to do or &gt; not, but I think it would be a cool
        option to have. &gt; &gt; I'm not really in dire need of a program like
        this, I was just curious &gt; if it would be hard to do or not. Are
        there any others who would be &gt; interested in such a feature, or am I
        just weird? ;-) &gt; &gt; Chris &gt;

        There's a way to always get the same side. Instead of flipping it, toss
        it in the air. As you toss it, make it rotate instead of flip. Then,
        make it oscillate slightly so it gives the illusion that it's flipping.
        If you do it properly then you can always get the same side. A friend
        showed this to me...it was pretty cool. Vincent On 15/11/05, d_j_salvia

        Exactly. The type test measures your preferences. Those preferences are
        OFTEN, but not ALWAYS, associated with certain skills or tendencies. You
        will always find exceptions. For example, I seem to be the only S so
        far. N's are just *generally* better at seeing patterns. So call me an
        exception. (Or don't, considering I'm probably one of the most pathetic
        cubers here....) My roommate in college was depressed after finding out
        he was INTP. He wanted to be a scientist so he thought he had to be
        INTJ. But the 16 types are not meant to be rigid boxes - only rough
        predictors. Well, long story short he gave up on science and majored in
        math instead. :P So don't worry about who you are. Oh yeah, and Craig -

        It seems to me that a fully random RPS player would have exactly 50%
        chance to win every game, and thus the same chance as any other player
        to win a tournament. In other words, if 100 players enter a tournament,
        a random player will have exactly 1% chance to win it. Or is that wrong
        in some way?? I used to have an inactive link to a RPS page I planned to
        build on my site, but after several years I abandoned the project. It
        would be very cool to build something that tracked people's patterns and
        used them against them, and I know that is very feasible, but OTOH, all
        that brilliance can be semi-thwarted by such a simple counter strategy,
        and that was part of why I lost interest. Though actual human people are
        incapable of being 100% random, but you'd probably have to play pretty
        long games to exploit unconscious non randomness. /Lars On Nov 15, 2005,

        consistently, but you don't have much evidence here. Suppose we start
        from the hypothesis (1) that those win/lose/tie percentages really are
        an accurate reflection of what you would get in a very long run of
        games. Now compare the probability of getting the result (9,3,4) under
        that assumption (1) with the probability of getting (9,3,4) in purely
        random play: Ratio = (.5625)^9 * (.1875)^3 * (.25)^4 / (.3333)^16 = 6.2
        This is not strong evidence in favour of (1), as compared with random
        play, and it will be weakened further if you were to make allowance for
        other hypotheses -- as we should: I deliberately chose (1) to be
        maximally favourable to /you/ -- i.e., to give the maximum possible
        value for the relative likelihoods of the 2 hypotheses. &gt; That
        program is sooo bad. And my strategy was actually quite &gt; repetitive.
        It was a short run. Try playing several hundred games to see if the
        program will pick up on your strategy. Yeah, it would be boring to do a
        proper test. ;) Mike

        words, if 100 players enter a tournament, &gt; a random player will have
        exactly 1% chance to win it. Or is that wrong &gt; in some way?? That
        sounds correct for one scenario: N players in a knockout competition of
        log N rounds (log to base 2), so there's a 50% chance of Mr Random
        progressing from one round to the next. But if everyone has to play
        everyone else, I suspect that the probability of Mr Random winning is
        much lower: the winner needs to get the highest overall score, and the
        strong programs that exploit patterns in the play of weak programs will
        be winning significantly more than half their games. Mike

        Hi I don't know which one would be most drawn to speedcubing. I used to

        harder for an F or J to learn cubing, because I'd think being able to
        &gt; analyze and adapt are primo considerations. I'm also thinking S's
        &gt; would be more interested in speed per se, whereas N's would be more
        &gt; interested in the mathematics of the cube and the like. &gt; &gt;
        In my adult life I seem to have 'gelled' as an ISTP. I was ISFP but &gt;

        Hi friends, I was the judge... :-) Reading the report I still think the
        writer likes me. :-) Actually I consider this the same as an always
        popping cube: you should buy a new puzzle if you cannot follow the
        regulations with your puzzle. Yeah, it may sound a bit harsh, especially
        if you are not the record breaking type for a specific puzzle. But
        wasn't there a wise American who said that all people are equal? Any
        complaints about the regulations are welcome at the
        worldcubeassociation.org forum. We will work on the 2006 version in
        december 2005. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: Stefan

        The thing that bothers me the most is that the tiles for the magics are
        not the same thickness. I inadvertently used two magics of different
        tile thickness to make my master magic, which is why it hardly ever lays
        flat when solved (unless I take a few seconds to work it flat). I got a
        DNF and a very close but still ok solve at RWC because of this. For us
        do it yourselfers who don't want to, and can't afford to, buy a master
        magic on eBay, can we at least petition rubiks.com to either standardize
        the tile thickness, or sell blank tiles (again standardized to the same
        size) so that we can make our own? I don't think they will reinstate the
        magic DIY kit. Mr. Rubik has requested that it not be sold anymore (I
        was told this when I was buying strings from rubiks.com). Also, and I
        hate to be mean, but I think the cubesmith price of $6 for a bag of 16
        strings is ridiculous. If you need magic strings write to the people at
        rubiks.com. They have been selling bags of 16 strings to me for $2 a bag
        for the past couple months. Anyway, is there a way that we can get the
        tiles standardized so that do it yourselfers, who now can't buy a DIY
        kit, can make our own? Or do I have to resort to eBay if I want to
        continue to compete in the master magic? Chris

        Hello Everyone, On Sunday November 27, I'll be participating in the
        Hollywood Christmas Parade. I'll be promoting the new season of Beauty
        and the Geek with Richard and Lauren from the first season, along with
        another guy and two girls from this season. If you're in the Los Angeles
        area, the parade begins at 5 PM and will be broadcast on KTLA. I believe
        it should be broadcast nationally as well. If you'd like to come and
        laugh at me in person, the parade will be only about 15 minutes away
        from Caltech. Anyway, tune in to see me on TV! And... if you're really
        confused as to why I would be promoting the new season of Beauty and the
        Geek, shoot me an e-mail. Below are a couple of links: two links for the
        parade and another two links for the show, "Beauty and the Geek."

        Not bad for a start! &lt;long post&gt; Suggestions: Rendering 1. Raise
        the specularity and shininess on the stickers, they're almost reflective
        on new cubes. Perhaps add the logo to the white center. 2. look at a new
        cube, the reflections aren't perfect. Add a really light bump map to
        break up the reflections and specular highlights. 3. Get rid of ALL
        ambient light. If you need more light, turn on a point light. 4. Soften
        the spotlight. You have no decay around the edges of the light and that
        circle makes the image look CG. 5. Add more than one light. Usually I
        use a simple 3 light setup: Key light fill light and back light. Make
        sure that they're all not the same intensity. Key is usually .9 Fill is
        .5 or so, back is usually the brightest. I can see 2 lights in yours, so
        play around with them some more. Perhaps use area lights to soften the
        shaddows? 6. Get rid of the checkerboard table. As somebody who uses 3D
        programs, it stands out as a simple procedural texture that you just
        threw into the pic. Perhaps you could find a photo of a piece of wood
        and use that as a map? Or you could use a "use background" texture (I
        think that's what they're called in Max ... I usually use Maya) and make
        the background white. That gives you the effect of the white infinite
        room that you see so much on TV commercials, but you still get the
        shaddows. 7. If you can, try working with mental ray. It allows you to
        play with some really neat lighting stuff. For instance You can set it
        up to show bounced light. Set your cube on a white piece of paper red in
        front. Look at the paper. See the red? Mental ray can do that. Look for
        tutorials, they're everywhere. In general, your image is just too
        perfect. Real things aren't that perfect. Animation - I've tried
        animating a cube once, and it didn't turn out well. When I finally sit
        down to do it correctly, I want it to be fully scripted (IE select a
        center and the corresponding side turns no matter how many other twists
        have happened. Which you unfortunately can't do with just simple
        grouping) Anyway, back to you... the best way I found to move a cube is
        to move all the pivot points into the very center of the cube. That way
        when you select a side, the pivots are always directly below the center
        cubie. The problem I had was when a piece rotated more than 360. If that
        happens, the rotation value will go back to 0 when you key the frame,
        and when you play the animation, the piece will move in a strange
        fasion, so you pretty much have to fix that in the graph editor after
        you set the keyframes. &lt;/long post&gt; *whew Hope I helped TBTTFox On

        Hey all, This is to announce that there will be an official WCA approved
        competition at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. This is
        especially for all you East Coasters that rarely get a chance to
        compete. ;) Registration is free and competitors will probably get free
        pizza, so you have no excuse not to come. :) The events will include
        2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 3x3 one-handed, 3x3 blindfolded, magic, and master
        magic. It is being sponsored by the Rutgers University Rubik's Cube
        Club. If you have any questions, please e-mail me: bob [at] cubewhiz.com
        and I will do my best to answer them. I will create a database to see
        who is interested in coming. This would help me when making a schedule
        of events. I hope to see you there! ~ Bob

        Thanks cubekid, I'm definatly not making a ton on Magic strings. I also
        paid more than $2 a bag. In fact after shipping I'm closer to $3.50 my
        cost. I was honestly just trying to offer these as a conveinence,
        because people had asked for them. I also don't sell as many strings as
        you might think. It will probably take me 4-5 months to sell the 25 sets

        Hey everyone, I recently found that one of my ZBLL algs ends in a really
        really nice OLL alg that I have never seen before. The first half is a
        setup into this OLL such that the OLL solves it. Anyway I've been trying
        just the OLL itself and I really like it, and am definitely switching to
        it. To setup do: L R' U F U' F' L' U' R To solve do: (R' U) L y' (R U R'
        U') (S) Also the inverse is very nice and solves the inverse OLL case To
        setup do: R' U L F U F' U' L' R To solve do: x' (M' U) y' (R U' R') y
        (L' U') R Again I'm sure these algs have already been discovered, but I
        had never seen them before. Hope someone likes them. The first one is
        definitely much faster than my current alg, and I think with practice I
        get get the second one to beat my current alg also. Heh heh ZBLL can
        come in handy for Fridrich solving :-) Chris

        Hey Stefan, I actually use the exact two algs that you just wrote here.
        I think I may stick to my old alg for the second case, that new alg is a
        bit awkward for my hands. For my style though, that first new alg is so
        much faster than my old one. Chris --- In

        stands for "sin" ??? &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; Well, it's sort of a half S
        turn and half M turn. I guess to write it more exactly I would say (R'
        U) L y (R U R' U') x S The first y is only a half y turn. Turn the cube
        so that you don't have a flat face in the front as an F face, but rather
        what started as the FL edge. The FL edge should be the closest part of
        the cube to you. Execute the (RUR'U') from this angle. Then do the x as
        if you were doing regular x rotation, but rotate with that FL edge still
        closest to you. Also only do it as a half turn. This way the S turn is
        halfway between an M and an S. I wish I had a camera and I could show
        you. I've gotten it in 1.5x seconds several times though, so I mean it
        can be quite fast. Chris

        Gilles My drawings are not accurate, real corner pieces are more
        complicated, it's just for the idea. The size and thickness of tiles
        should be careful engineered. - Thanks to the holes, you can remove the
        tiles by pushing them from behind. - Just put an adhesive sheet, and the
        tiles won't move. - You can see the color only when facing the side
        (that's a problem with thick tiles). - Rubiks.com could sell fancy tiles
        sets, as they do with stickers. - Waterproof. - This beta version does
        not cure cancers. Gilles.

        Hi! I have always endorsed the idea about fused tiles. The tiles
        themselves do not necessarily have to be very thick. Slightly thincker
        than the ones found on the impossiball will be enough. On those tiles
        only a very small pin is enough to fix them firmly to the puzzle pieces
        (discs). Personally i would love to see those kinda tiles on regular
        cubes and for me i think i might prefer some hardened rubber of some
        kind and not plastic. This will ensure a better grip/hold of the cube. 2
        kinds of tiles could eb supplied. Plastic and hardened rubber. But
        realistically i can't see it happening. Seventowns have already declined
        remaking the deluxe/game cubes. So i can't see why they would would be

        Man, that's a really good idea I hope someone can make cubes like that

        them firmly to the puzzle pieces (discs). Personally i would love to see
        those kinda tiles on regular cubes and for me i think i might prefer
        some hardened rubber of some kind and not plastic. This will ensure a
        better grip/hold of the cube. 2 kinds of tiles could eb supplied.
        Plastic and hardened rubber. But realistically i can't see it happening.
        Seventowns have already declined remaking the deluxe/game cubes. So i

        Holy crap! I just got a personal best of 19.86, which is my first ever
        sub-20 solve! Thats about 2.5 seconds faster than my previous personal
        best. It was also a part of my new best average of 28.13, which is
        better than my previous best of 29.83. That seems like a big jump in
        both areas, has anyone else experienced such big drops in times? Also,
        for the record, I started cubing in May 2002 (I have the exact dates at
        home), so it took me 3yrs 6mos to get a sub-20 solve. Now we'll see how
        long it takes me to get a sub-20 average! Man I was going to stop typing
        and hit send, but I'm on such a rush right now. That solve felt so
        blazingly fast, with an easy OLL and one of my best PLL's. I've really
        been working on looking ahead during my F2L since Orlando, and it
        finally seems to be paying off. I realized that I used to watch the
        pieces of my current CE pair while putting them in, then look for the
        next one, which caused some major gaps in the F2L. I wish I could drop

        I think Gilles is saying that these tiles would function just like
        stickers. You wouldn't get the 'advantage' that the current tiles offer.

        because of school. When I picked it up again, I got a new pb average of
        19.11 and have been sub-20 since. I'm not sure how it happened, but I
        wish I could apply the same technique for my classes. I would stop going
        to class for a month and show up for the final exam. -Chris On 11/17/05,

        times we would be able to achieve!? There would possibly be a lot of

        Hi Chris, I don't know if you're interested in seeing how someone might
        find that on his or her own, but I thought Id tell you anyway. :) A long
        time a go I was looking for a new way to reverse the position of LL
        corners. Previously I had worked out R U R' U' which affects 4 corners
        and 3 edges and I thought I could adapt it the LL. The 4 corners were DR
        UR BR and BL. Since LU wasn't affected and DR was I added F to put LU
        where RU was and RU where DR was...beginning and ending with F so F R U
        R' U' F' which you probably recognize. Definitely one of my favorite
        algs. Later on with similar reasoning applied to its mirror inverse R'
        U' F' U F R, I added L to the beginning and U L' at the end... L R' U'
        F' U F R U L' L U' R F' U' F U r' Eight moves in my notation. It is one
        of my favorite algs. While I'm on favorite algs try F' U' L' U2 L F U R
        U2 R' now rotate the cube QU2 and do the alg again. Cheers, David J ---

        I think it would be cool if the tiles snapped on and off. Maybe in such
        a way that you have to push from behind to make them come off, so that

        The exchangeable tiles are what I'd hoped the Mefferts cubes would be.
        Instead they were glued on, except for the centers. And the

        Hi Dan! I start with an xcross, doing this: (y') U R' L' D'w L F' After
        that you are facing an easy pair, and when it's solved (I think most of
        you do it the same way as me) do U2 and the next easy pair is in FL.
        When that one is done you only need three moves to fix the last pair.

        Ahh yes, much better! That looks really good! umm, some other things
        (yes I know I'm nitpicking, but the devil is in the details, but there
        are only 1 real one this time) Play with the lighting more - look at
        some still life photos some people have taken to get an idea of what I'm
        talking about. Lights usually aren't that close to the subject. Oh, And
        again, think about using area lights, they really do emulate the real
        world better. OOh! Idea! if you get REALLY bored, try making a used
        speedcube, peeling stickers, fading colors, chipped edges and all.

        Hi Peter, What about JNetCube? What exactly are you going to do when
        there's a warning anyway? Maybe you should just keep a stop watch next
        to the StackMat. I guess I'm not clear why you want a warning. Is the
        warning so that you'll speed up or just so you know to start another
        time? In BLD, if you don't have it memorized, there's nothing you can
        really do so a warning isn't going to help. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Hi Tyson, The warning would help me speed up. At WC05 the judge warned
        me at 1 minute to go. Even though I got a DNF (i messed up earlier in
        the solve) it did help me speed up. Is there a feature like that in
        JNetCube? Peter Greenwood --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I agree with Bob... learn how it works... it's much better that way.
        http://twistypuzzles.com/solutions/3x3x3-01.shtml has a good explanation
        of the f2l and, at least for me, was very good in teaching me f2l. it
        only gives the basic, but half the fun is learning how it works.
        memorization can come later... learn how it works first On 11/19/05, Bob

        with a record post. The form should work in any browser, also if you are
        using a web e-mail service like Hotmail. If you accept the cookie from
        the record post page, your name and e- mail address will be available
        next time you post a record. This is the first step to automating the
        UWR record updates. All records are posted into a database, from where I
        (still) handle them manually. Upcoming steps to be developed are: 1)
        after I approve a record, it will automatically appear on the record
        lists (this would make a HUGE difference for me!) :-) 2) new page with
        50 latest posted records (for visitors to see what changed recently) 3)
        trusted posters can update their own records (yet even less work for me)
        4) one e-mail address + website reference across all pages (at the
        moment all pages are handled separately) All this great work is done by
        Lars Vandenbergh! Thank you so much Lars! Visit his site at
        www.cubezone.be Suggestions for the UWR pages are very welcome via
        e-mail. Thanks and have fun, Ron PS: Tomorrow I will fly to India for a
        week, so no record updates...

        Congratulations on getting down to 2 min. First of all, in short, yes
        you must learn to read notation if you ever want to learn any

        fast. If you want some great sites, check out the links section at

        Just read an norwegian news article about a new world record in Hungary.
        Apparently it broke the old record set in 1982 by 5 seconds. They are
        obviously not up to speed on the recent development in the cubing
        society. link :

        Broke the Rubik record. Hungarian Prodanov Mitk (19) broke the world
        record of solving the Rubiks cube Sunday, with a time of 18,5 seconds.
        This is 5,5 seconds faster than the previous record, set in 1982 - when
        there was a world wide Rubik "fever". The new record was set in
        Budapest. Terje [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]

        That could be a new kind of competition. Give a scramble, let
        competitors find a good solution (FMC style, but optimized for speed),
        make them solve as fast as possible... mmhh... No. Try #1: 16s Ul'U'L2F

        8.8s With this scramble, there's a 2x2x2 in 4 moves! Maybe Lars would
        have found F2L+OLL in 26 fast moves using his technique, leaving an easy
        permutation. UF'B'LRUR'U2R'F2RFRUR2U'RU2R'U'R2UR2U'RU+3-cycle -&gt; 35

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today I installed a new record post page
        on speedcubing.com. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From now on
        it should not be necessary anymore to send an e-mail &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        with a record post. The form should work in any browser, also if &gt;
        &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are using a web e-mail service like
        Hotmail. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you accept the cookie from the record
        post page, your name &gt; &gt; and e- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mail address
        will be available next time you post a record. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the first step to automating the UWR record
        updates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All records are posted into a database,
        from where I (still) &gt; &gt; handle &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them manually.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upcoming steps to be developed are: &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 1) after I approve a record, it will automatically appear on the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; record lists (this would make a HUGE difference for
        me!) :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) new page with 50 latest posted records
        (for visitors to see &gt; &gt; what &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed
        recently) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) trusted posters can update their own
        records (yet even less &gt; &gt; work &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for me) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) one e-mail address + website reference across all
        pages (at &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment all pages are handled
        separately) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All this great work
        is done by Lars Vandenbergh! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you so much Lars!

        is the word "preinspection". It is presolve, and it is inspection. So
        preinspection would be the time before you actually start inspecting,
        would it not? But as long as you understand that the "preinspection"
        starts when you pick the cube up from the table and finishes when you
        put it back down on the table, then the issue is moot as you are not
        putting it on the table during your inspection as per this rule. I do
        wonder, however, if that means you are disqualified if you accidentally
        drop the cube because it will then touch the table during the solving
        portion. This is probably in the rules somewhere and someone else will
        undoubtedly enlighten me. -Dave Campbell

        other hand. &gt; &gt; So every solve should be DNF, coz when you start,
        the puzzle is on the table =) The only thing I think that needs updating
        is the word "preinspection". It is presolve, and it is inspection. So
        preinspection would be the time before you actually start inspecting,
        would it not? But as long as you understand that the "preinspection"
        starts when you pick the cube up from the table and finishes when you
        put it back down on the table, then the issue is moot as you are not
        putting it on the table during your inspection as per this rule. I do
        wonder, however, if that means you are disqualified if you accidentally
        drop the cube because it will then touch the table during the solving
        portion. This is probably in the rules somewhere and someone else will
        undoubtedly enlighten me. -Dave Campbell SPONSORED LINKS Jigsaw puzzle

        particular situation, if you are unsure of what would happen, then the

        Hi Guys, This is a typical "letter of the law" versus "spirit of the
        law" type of thing. The spirit of the law is that the cube is to be
        solved by one hand, in this case, unaided by the table. Picking up the

        Hi Everyone, I don't really have much of a problem with it. It is a
        "spirit of the law" but the letter of the law is also clear. If you drop
        the cube on the table or if you drop the cube and it falls onto your
        chest or foot, you're not breaking the rule because you're not using the
        table or the body to manipulate the cube. Manipulate implies "making a
        turn" and so if you are using the table to apply a force to the cube
        which turns a side, then you're breaking the rule. If you use your
        armpit to hold the cube while your other hand turns the cube, that's not
        good either. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On

        &gt; &gt; &gt; may touch the puzzle. Once a competitor touches the
        puzzle with &gt; &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand, he may not
        touch the puzzle with the other hand. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So every solve should be DNF, coz when you start, the puzzle is on
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the table =) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The only thing I think that needs updating is the &gt; &gt; &gt; word
        "preinspection". It is presolve, and it is inspection. So &gt; &gt; &gt;
        preinspection would be the time before you actually start &gt; &gt; &gt;
        inspecting, would it not? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But as long as
        you understand that the "preinspection" starts when &gt; &gt; &gt; you
        pick the cube up from the table and finishes when you put it &gt; &gt;
        &gt; back down on the table, then the issue is moot as you are not &gt;
        &gt; &gt; putting it on the table during your inspection as per this
        rule. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do wonder, however, if that means
        you are disqualified if you &gt; &gt; &gt; accidentally drop the cube
        because it will then touch the table &gt; &gt; &gt; during the solving
        portion. This is probably in the rules somewhere &gt; &gt; &gt; and
        someone else will undoubtedly enlighten me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Feet-solving is definitely a tricky one. It seems that the wording for
        feet-solving should allow the floor to be used because, in the words of
        Stefan, what's natural for a person to do with their feet is to anchor
        the cube on the floor and then make a turn. For one-handed, yes, we
        should use the word "manipulate" instead of "touch". Tyson Mao MSC #631

        It's the last layer algorithms that get me. I also attribute my lack of
        one-handed skill to the fact that my cube is a little stiffer and my
        hands are kind of small, so having to regrip the cube every couple of

        Hi Khawaja, You can purchase the StackMat here:
        http://www.speedstacks.com/ . As for how many times a day you should
        solve a cube or if notation is necessary, the amount of effort you put
        into cubing will directly affect your success. If you choose not to
        learn notation, that's fine, but you should know that you will have a
        difficult time sharing ideas and also a difficult time learning new
        things as most of our information is communicated in this manner. You
        basically choose to study what you want. If your goal is to reach 1
        minute, then you might not need notation, but you have to make sure the
        method you're using is efficient and does not waste steps. If your goal
        is to get under 60 seconds, then you'll probably want to learn notation
        as it's unfair to the rest of us to describe visually to you what to do
        when we took the effort to learn notation as to lessen the burden of
        teaching from other cubers. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        yes i used notation, its not that hard, and its just kind of something
        you need to suck it up and do. i do use some more advanced techniques
        now, but i reached around 35 seconds with the basic petrus method, then
        i expanded to learn some other last layer techniques. if you wanted my
        advice on what to practice to get faster, it would be the first 2 steps
        of the method, building the 2x2x2 then the 2x2x3. try studying each
        corner and see how many moves you can make a 2x2x2 box with each one.
        once you know which one you think is the shortest, study it until you
        know the moves to make the box in your head (this is why notation is
        important) then execute building the 2x2x2 blindfolded. this will help
        you see the box to build, as well as helping you to be able to look
        ahead, because if you can build the 2x2x2 without looking at what you
        are doing, you can be searching for the next 3 pieces you need while
        doing the 2x2x2. and 25 seconds is far from amazing, but thanks for your
        compliment. it does take patience, you can't just go from 10 minutes to
        1 minute in a day or two. it will come naturally, don't worry about
        speed, work on efficiency and the speed will come naturally. shamsul

        I was thinking about this a bit more. There is a certain agreement
        between the student and the teacher. The teacher is expected to further
        the education of his student without reservation. When I teach people
        blindfolding, I tell them everything I know, even if it means that they
        might beat me later on. I know Leyan and I share blindfold ideas freely
        with the hope of pushing the human limits of blindfold cubing. I don't
        hold any secrets back so that I can beat him. The student, on the other
        hand, is expected to put forth an effort equal or greater to that of the
        teacher's effort. You cannot expect me to explain to you concept of the
        cube if you are not willing to put forth the effort to learn something
        as simple as notation, which, I might add, can be learned in about 2
        minutes. If you are constantly searching for short cuts in order to get
        by on cubing, your success will surely be limited. We're all willing to
        help you. I can tell you that an 18 second average is possible with only
        OLL and PLL. (Takahito Domon) and that Macky can probably solve the cube
        with a beginner's method in 23 seconds on average (no OLL, no PLL).
        However, these people have spent a considerable effort studying the art
        of cubing. All of us are friendly here. But we'll only put in as much
        effort to teach you as you are willing to put in effort to learn. Tyson

        I'm being tough, but I'm sure everyone here expects the same from any
        student. There's nothing you can do in cubing which will make you

        turn, I do believe that some people are just meant to be better cubers
        for reasons like faster reflexes, better visual spacial skills, etc. I
        mean not anyone can train to win the 100m at the olympics, some people
        are just better built for it, so if they train as much as you, you can't
        catch up. I don't mean that to sound pessimistic, but it seems most
        disciplines are this way, I guess we should also qualify? I just felt
        like asking to see what others thought too. Chris

        his student without reservation. When I &gt; &gt; teach &gt; &gt; people
        blindfolding, I tell them everything I know, even if it means &gt; &gt;
        that they might beat me later on. I know Leyan and I share blindfold
        &gt; &gt; ideas freely with the hope of pushing the human limits of
        blindfold &gt; &gt; cubing. I don't hold any secrets back so that I can
        beat him. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The student, on the other hand, is
        expected to put forth an effort &gt; &gt; equal or greater to that of
        the teacher's effort. You cannot expect &gt; &gt; me &gt; &gt; to
        explain to you concept of the cube if you are not willing to put &gt;
        &gt; forth the effort to learn something as simple as notation, which, I
        &gt; &gt; might add, can be learned in about 2 minutes. If you are
        constantly &gt; &gt; searching for short cuts in order to get by on
        cubing, your success &gt; &gt; will surely be limited. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; We're all willing to help you. I can tell you that an 18 second
        &gt; &gt; average is possible with only OLL and PLL. (Takahito Domon)
        and that &gt; &gt; Macky can probably solve the cube with a beginner's
        method in 23 &gt; &gt; seconds on average (no OLL, no PLL). However,
        these people have &gt; &gt; spent &gt; &gt; a considerable effort
        studying the art of cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us are friendly

        &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Khawaja, &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You can purchase
        the StackMat here: http://www.speedstacks.com/ . &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; As for how many times a day you should solve a cube or if
        notation is &gt; &gt;&gt; necessary, the amount of effort you put into
        cubing will directly &gt; &gt;&gt; affect your success. If you choose
        not to learn notation, that's &gt; &gt;&gt; fine, &gt; &gt;&gt; but you
        should know that you will have a difficult time sharing ideas &gt;
        &gt;&gt; and also a difficult time learning new things as most of our
        &gt; &gt;&gt; information is communicated in this manner. &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; You basically choose to study what you want. If your goal
        is to reach &gt; &gt;&gt; 1 minute, then you might not need notation,
        but you have to make sure &gt; &gt;&gt; the method you're using is
        efficient and does not waste steps. If &gt; &gt;&gt; your &gt; &gt;&gt;
        goal is to get under 60 seconds, then you'll probably want to learn &gt;
        &gt;&gt; notation as it's unfair to the rest of us to describe visually
        to you &gt; &gt;&gt; what to do when we took the effort to learn
        notation as to lessen the &gt; &gt;&gt; burden of teaching from other

        Hi Chris, Yes, I agree with you to a degree. In many sports, you can
        only work so hard. Once you get to the elite level, physiology takes
        over. I can train as hard as I want, and I might work my entire life off
        and manage to run a mile in 4 minutes and 20 seconds, but the elite
        runners do it in 3 minutes and 50 seconds, and there comes a point where
        body type and things we cannot control are start to factor into our
        success overwhelmingly. However, with cubing, I think it affects us far
        less. Cubing is very much a mental thing. The dexterity can be learned
        just as anyone can learn to play the violin. I would believe that cubing
        is very much like learning to play music and only a few people in the
        world have innate abilities that help them. Otherwise, for the most
        part, pretty much anyone can be sub-20. Sub-15... is another story, and
        is like the 3:50 mile. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        I also agree, but I would like to point out that cubing is relatively
        new. We are probably quite far from the limits of cubing. Nobody devotes
        their entire life to solving the cube, though there are people who
        devote such time to running. The limits of speedcubing will be
        constantly pushed for this reason. ~ Bob --- In

        point out that cubing is relatively &gt; new. We are probably quite far
        from the limits of cubing. Nobody &gt; devotes their entire life to
        solving the cube, though there are people &gt; who devote such time to
        running. The limits of speedcubing will be &gt; constantly pushed for
        this reason. &gt; &gt; ~ Bob On the contrary, I feel that we're already
        reasonably close to the possible limits of human execution. Think of it
        this way: If someone could conceivably use full ZB (or whatever method
        with few moves they choose) and manage between 40 and 45 moves per
        solve, along with a turn rate of around 5 turns per second, that's still
        something like 9 seconds on average. Sure, proportionately, we've got a
        long way to go, but with the rate of improvement, and the general
        refinement of the methods and processes, I believe cubing will soon
        reach a point where a sub-13 or even sub-12 average is not unheard of in
        competition. Of course, even that is leagues away from 9 seconds, but
        it's only a matter of time, really. I'm much more interested in the
        limits on the 4x4. -Mike Team [ZB]

        the &gt; &gt; Rubiks cube Sunday, with a time of 18,5 seconds. &gt; &gt;
        This is 5,5 seconds faster than the previous record, set in 1982 &gt;
        &gt; - when &gt; &gt; there was a world wide Rubik "fever". &gt; &gt;
        The new record was set in Budapest. &gt; &gt; Terje &gt; &gt; [Non-text

        Hi all, I just got back from the Hungarian Nationals which you may or
        may not have seen media about. It was a fantastically well organised
        event, and the aim of the competition was to bring the cube back into
        peoples minds in Hungary, and also to try and break the old Hungarian
        Record. The event accomplished both goals, with several records broken
        and a best time of 18.21 (I think thats right). We then took part in the
        "Kocka Show" afterwards and showed off lots of different skills, Stefan
        and I did team-blindfold solving, and also blindfolded - where Stefan
        successfully solved followed by tumultuous applause; and Jasmine, Stefan
        and I took part in lots of races of all sorts with the Hungarians. I
        also beat Stefan by less than 0.5 seconds on the 4x4x4, bad luck mate!
        My proudest moment was setting the fastest time of the day on stage,
        15.87. I also set an 11.24 seconds solve while being solved by a TV news
        crew, so I am looking forward to seeing the video of that. It was
        scrambled by Stefan and timed on his stopwatch, so I guess the time
        maybe inaccurate, but we will be able to tell from the video :) The city
        was also beautiful (Budapest), and the Hungarians were very friendly and
        welcoming to all. If the European Championship of 2006 will be held in
        Budapest, then I think it would be a superb event. Because the cube a
        national treasure, there is SO SO much more interest within the
        Hungarian public, the crowds that turned up were even bigger than at the
        World Champs! And the media guys did a great job of publicising the
        event, and making sure it ran smoothly. I will definitely be voting for
        EC2006 in Hungary. I've almost sorted my webhosting out now, so when
        it's back up I will add pics from DCD2005, WC2005, and Hungarian
        Nationals as well as reports for all, updated FMC and lots more stuff I
        promise! Dan :)

        Heya, Looking at Olympic Cubes' site and messages on Twisty it won't
        take very long anymore for the 6x6x6 to be available for the public.
        Personally I'm very excited about trying it out. Does anybody has an
        idea about how it's going to be released? Will we be able to order it
        off the Olympic Cubes site? Also will the upcoming tournaments have
        6x6x6 events? What will the top times be like for the 6x6x6 after say 2
        months of it's release? Discuss :D Greets, Koen

        Hi ! There have been some rumors about the next European championship on
        the French forum. Here is a message from Mr Karpiel, president of
        Winning Moves France group (they organised last french champs) : "Il y
        aura bien un championnat de France 2006, comme d'habitude un vendredi de
        la deuxi√®me quinzaine d'avril au Novotel les Halles √† Paris (bloquez
        d√©j√† ces vendredis). Il y aura √©galement un championnat d'Europe √† Paris
        √† l'automne 2006. J'aimerais bien que ce soit √† la Cit√© des Sciences √†
        La Villette, mais ce n'est pas encore acquis. La date reste √† pr√©ciser,
        entre d√©but septembre et d√©but novembre 2006. Ce sera un week-end." T
        .KARPIEL, Pr√©sident de Winning Moves . I reported above the original
        french message, but here is a translation : "French championship will be
        organised in 2006, as usual on a Friday, late April, in Novotel les
        Halles in Paris. There will be as well European Championship in Paris
        (fall 2006). I would like it to take place at the Cit√© des Sciences in
        La Villette, but it has not been confirmed yet. The date has not been
        fixed either, this will be a week-end between early September and early
        November." T. Karpiel, President of Winning Moves here is a link to the
        cit√© des sciences http://www.cite-sciences.fr Wait and see, we'll keep
        the community informed if anything is confirmed :) cyril

        It was definitely a great weekend. I had so much fun and I'm sure
        everyone else did too! I was impressed with how well organised the
        Hungarian competition was. There must have been quite a lot of
        pre-competition publicity as there were well over 100 competitors in
        total. I think I heard the number 130? This is far more than any other
        competition I've been to (other than Worlds 2005 of course). Also, as
        the competition and the cube show was staged in the middle of a shopping
        centre it meant that there were lots of general spectators, i.e. not
        just other cubers in the audience. BTW, my proudest moment was beating
        both Dan *and* Stefan in a 3x3x3 race on stage during the cube show! ;)

        Nationals which you may or &gt; &gt; may not &gt; &gt; have seen media
        about. &gt; &gt; It was a fantastically well organised event, and the
        aim of the &gt; &gt; competition was to bring the cube back into peoples
        minds in &gt; &gt; Hungary, &gt; &gt; and also to try and break the old
        Hungarian Record. The event &gt; &gt; accomplished both goals, with
        several records broken and a best &gt; &gt; time &gt; &gt; of 18.21 (I
        think thats right). &gt; &gt; We then took part in the "Kocka Show"
        afterwards and showed off &gt; &gt; lots &gt; &gt; of different skills,
        Stefan and I did team-blindfold solving, &gt; &gt; and also &gt; &gt;
        blindfolded - where Stefan successfully solved followed by &gt; &gt;
        tumultuous &gt; &gt; applause; and Jasmine, Stefan and I took part in
        lots of races &gt; &gt; of all &gt; &gt; sorts with the Hungarians. I
        also beat Stefan by less than 0.5 &gt; &gt; seconds &gt; &gt; on the
        4x4x4, bad luck mate! My proudest moment was setting the &gt; &gt;
        fastest time of the day on stage, 15.87. &gt; &gt; I also set an 11.24
        seconds solve while being solved by a TV &gt; &gt; news &gt; &gt; crew,
        so I am looking forward to seeing the video of that. It &gt; &gt; was
        &gt; &gt; scrambled by Stefan and timed on his stopwatch, so I guess the
        &gt; &gt; time &gt; &gt; maybe inaccurate, but we will be able to tell
        from the video :) &gt; &gt; The city was also beautiful (Budapest), and
        the Hungarians were &gt; &gt; very friendly and welcoming to all. &gt;
        &gt; If the European Championship of 2006 will be held in Budapest, &gt;
        &gt; then I &gt; &gt; think it would be a superb event. Because the cube
        a national &gt; &gt; treasure, there is SO SO much more interest within
        the Hungarian &gt; &gt; public, the crowds that turned up were even
        bigger than at the &gt; &gt; World &gt; &gt; Champs! And the media guys
        did a great job of publicising the &gt; &gt; event, &gt; &gt; and making
        sure it ran smoothly. &gt; &gt; I will definitely be voting for EC2006
        in Hungary. &gt; &gt; I've almost sorted my webhosting out now, so when
        it's back up I &gt; &gt; will &gt; &gt; add pics from DCD2005, WC2005,
        and Hungarian Nationals as well &gt; &gt; as &gt; &gt; reports for all,
        updated FMC and lots more stuff I promise! &gt; &gt; Dan :) &gt; &gt;

        Nationals It was definitely a great weekend. I had so much fun and I'm
        sure everyone else did too! I was impressed with how well organised the
        Hungarian competition was. There must have been quite a lot of
        pre-competition publicity as there were well over 100 competitors in
        total. I think I heard the number 130? This is far more than any other
        competition I've been to (other than Worlds 2005 of course). Also, as
        the competition and the cube show was staged in the middle of a shopping
        centre it meant that there were lots of general spectators, i.e. not
        just other cubers in the audience. BTW, my proudest moment was beating
        both Dan *and* Stefan in a 3x3x3 race on stage during the cube show! ;)

        I really think it would be fantastic if we could order some for
        Christmas, but that may be a bit too optimistic. Nonetheless, I'm going
        to have to get one ASAP. As for times, my gut feeling is to say that if
        the cubes turn well, 5 minutes will be hit by many of the top cubers
        pretty quickly. Just a quick look at the data suggests that if you
        compare fastest time to number of pieces, then extrapolate the number of
        pieces needed to be placed on the 6x6x6 cube, I get that a world record
        time may be around 4:02 . I would certainly not be surprised if this was
        high though! -Daniel --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        This talk of potential world records on 6x6x6 cubes reminds me of a
        conversation I had with Per in Florida at the WC. Do most people who
        plan on buying 6x6x6 cubes plan on using the same method as they do for
        smaller cubes (4x4x4 and 5x5x4) on the 6x6x4? It seems to me that as the
        cubes get larger, the widely-accepted Centers-Edges-3x3x3-Parity
        approach gets less and less efficient. What does everyone else think?

        I imagine, that with time, the record for the 6x6x6 may get to be around
        3 minutes. It looks as though the puzzles gain about a minute per

        All -- This might not be the right forum, but I have a couple curious
        questions about the various championships. - I saw various country
        championships that occurred before the WC2005, with the country winners
        often getting a trip to WC2005. Was there a US championship in 2005? (I
        see that there was one in 2004). - Why are the world championships every
        other year? It seems like the momentum around cubing is increasing,
        could having a WC every year help grow the momentum? Especially if a TV
        deal (for WC and/or various country championships) could eventually be
        worked out, but that's another subject. thanks for any info that helps
        sate my curiousity, yeff

        Yeah, I was pretty surprised too! Basically I just had a really good
        smooth solve, and Dan and Stefan both had bad solves. I definitely
        remember Dan saying that he'd really stuffed something up during the
        solve (which is obviously true if I was beat him!). My normal average is
        ~30 seconds, but I was doing better than average last weekend and the
        majority of my solves on stage were sub-30s (ranging from 22s to 29s).

        25 secs? What happened? Did those two doze off during the solve? :D &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was impressed with how well organised the
        Hungarian competition was. &gt; &gt; There must have been quite a lot of
        pre-competition publicity as there &gt; &gt; were well over 100
        competitors in total. I think I heard the number 130? &gt; &gt; This is
        far more than any other competition I've been to (other than &gt; &gt;
        Worlds 2005 of course). Also, as the competition and the cube show was
        &gt; &gt; staged in the middle of a shopping centre it meant that there
        were lots &gt; &gt; of general spectators, i.e. not just other cubers in
        the audience. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, my proudest moment was beating
        both Dan *and* Stefan in a 3x3x3 &gt; &gt; race on stage during the cube
        show! ;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jasmine &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, &gt; &gt; &gt; I just got back
        from the Hungarian Nationals which you may or &gt; &gt; &gt; may not
        &gt; &gt; &gt; have seen media about. &gt; &gt; &gt; It was a
        fantastically well organised event, and the aim of the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        competition was to bring the cube back into peoples minds in &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Hungary, &gt; &gt; &gt; and also to try and break the old Hungarian
        Record. The event &gt; &gt; &gt; accomplished both goals, with several
        records broken and a best &gt; &gt; &gt; time &gt; &gt; &gt; of 18.21 (I
        think thats right). &gt; &gt; &gt; We then took part in the "Kocka Show"
        afterwards and showed off &gt; &gt; &gt; lots &gt; &gt; &gt; of
        different skills, Stefan and I did team-blindfold solving, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; and also &gt; &gt; &gt; blindfolded - where Stefan successfully
        solved followed by &gt; &gt; &gt; tumultuous &gt; &gt; &gt; applause;
        and Jasmine, Stefan and I took part in lots of races &gt; &gt; &gt; of
        all &gt; &gt; &gt; sorts with the Hungarians. I also beat Stefan by less
        than 0.5 &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds &gt; &gt; &gt; on the 4x4x4, bad luck
        mate! My proudest moment was setting the &gt; &gt; &gt; fastest time of
        the day on stage, 15.87. &gt; &gt; &gt; I also set an 11.24 seconds
        solve while being solved by a TV &gt; &gt; &gt; news &gt; &gt; &gt;
        crew, so I am looking forward to seeing the video of that. It &gt; &gt;
        &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambled by Stefan and timed on his stopwatch,
        so I guess the &gt; &gt; &gt; time &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe inaccurate, but
        we will be able to tell from the video :) &gt; &gt; &gt; The city was
        also beautiful (Budapest), and the Hungarians were &gt; &gt; &gt; very
        friendly and welcoming to all. &gt; &gt; &gt; If the European
        Championship of 2006 will be held in Budapest, &gt; &gt; &gt; then I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; think it would be a superb event. Because the cube a
        national &gt; &gt; &gt; treasure, there is SO SO much more interest
        within the Hungarian &gt; &gt; &gt; public, the crowds that turned up
        were even bigger than at the &gt; &gt; &gt; World &gt; &gt; &gt; Champs!
        And the media guys did a great job of publicising the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        event, &gt; &gt; &gt; and making sure it ran smoothly. &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        will definitely be voting for EC2006 in Hungary. &gt; &gt; &gt; I've
        almost sorted my webhosting out now, so when it's back up I &gt; &gt;
        &gt; will &gt; &gt; &gt; add pics from DCD2005, WC2005, and Hungarian
        Nationals as well &gt; &gt; &gt; as &gt; &gt; &gt; reports for all,
        updated FMC and lots more stuff I promise! &gt; &gt; &gt; Dan :) &gt;

        smaller cubes (4x4x4 and 5x5x4) on the 6x6x4? It &gt; seems to me that
        as the cubes get larger, the widely-accepted &gt;
        Centers-Edges-3x3x3-Parity approach gets less and less efficient. What
        &gt; does everyone else think? &gt; &gt; Doug &gt; &gt; Daniel Hayes
        wrote: &gt; &gt;&gt; I really think it would be fantastic if we could
        order some for &gt;&gt; Christmas, but that may be a bit too optimistic.
        Nonetheless, I'm &gt;&gt; going to have to get one ASAP. As for times,
        my gut feeling is to say &gt;&gt; that if the cubes turn well, 5 minutes
        will be hit by many of the top &gt;&gt; cubers pretty quickly. Just a
        quick look at the data suggests that if &gt;&gt; you compare fastest
        time to number of pieces, then extrapolate the &gt;&gt; number of pieces
        needed to be placed on the 6x6x6 cube, I get that a &gt;&gt; world
        record time may be around 4:02 . I would certainly not be &gt;&gt;
        surprised if this was high though! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -Daniel &gt;&gt;

        Heya, &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Looking at Olympic Cubes' site and
        messages on Twisty it won't take &gt;&gt;&gt; very long anymore for the
        6x6x6 to be available for the public. &gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I'm very
        excited about trying it out. &gt;&gt;&gt; Does anybody has an idea about
        how it's going to be released? Will we &gt;&gt;&gt; be able to order it
        off the Olympic Cubes site? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Also will the

        times be like for the 6x6x6 after say 2 months of it's release?

        a lot of half turns, so maybe it will take more than 22 moves in QTM. If

        HTM (and maybe more in &gt; QTM). &gt; It's finally done testing 22
        moves out and no solution so it's at least 24 moves (QTM). My machine is
        struggling now so I can't test it to 26 moves. Anyway, this is at least
        as far out as superflip in both QTM and HTM.

        well i don't think i'm going to win your game cube because people are
        willing to pay more than 30-35$ for it, which i am not. i have however
        managed to get 1 game cube and hopefully 1 more here soon, and i was
        wondering if you would tell me (or if i could buy from you) exactly what
        springs and washers and the other steps you take to make it speedcube
        worthy. i have always cleaned and lubbed them so i am familiar with
        that, also what steps do you use to adjust the tension evenly, do the
        tiles or the whole centercap have to be pulled off to do this. clancy

        my opinion though. As far as the popular solution method for the larger
        cubes, I don't believe that it gets any less efficient. There is still
        room for improvement with that method. &gt; There are two problems with
        this (as a general rule for larger cubes): 1. The number of pieces
        increases quadratically with the side length, not linearly, so it's not
        likely that the times would increase linearly (plus you only have 2
        steps for this basis 3-&gt;4 and 4-&gt;5, unless you can solve the 2x2x2
        in negative time!) The centres are the main limiting factor (the
        quadratic factor) - in the 3x3x3 there are 6*1^2 centres (but nothing to
        do if not marked) but in the 4x4x4 there are 6*2^2=24 centres in the
        5x5x5 there are 6*3^2 centres (48 if you don't count the very centres)
        but ther's 6*4^2=96 centres in a 6x6x6. This is probably why centres
        first is often used on these puzzles. There's a higher degree of freedom
        for the longest part which gives more speed. The edges (linear) and
        corners (constant) require less time so it's best to do them with more
        constraints. Doing the centres last puts more constraints on the largest
        part of the puzzle. 2. It is harder to locate pieces. Admittedly, this
        isn't really an issue for 6x6x6 - it does become an issue in the really
        big cubes though. Try finding centre pieces on a cube of size 11x11x11
        or bigger! This really slows things down on larger cubes. I'd imagine
        there's a further problem which is that the cube is probably less stable
        and more likely to break up/lock up at speed. The pieces will be smaller
        and even if the overlap problem is solved an increase in the number of
        slices means the cube is more likely to jam. If each slice is just a
        little off then things will build up quicker. This is only a problem for
        physical cubes, not computer cubes (for which the closest thing is a bad
        mouse) although 1, 2 apply equally to each. &gt; Douglas Reed

        There is another practical problem. If the cube is expensive, and
        replacement parts are not available, what happens if by speedcubing you
        break it? You would need to make replacement parts if the internals are
        as delicate as they sound, and if those are expensive you have a whole
        other issue. Either way I will buy a 6x6x6 as I hope they hold up for
        speedcubing. Also, will the 10 minute time limit be kept? If so, I
        imagine not many people would compete, other than top level big cube
        people who have a fast solution with lots of practice. The 6x6x6 isn't
        as open to new people who have just figured it out. I mean is that just
        the nature of the puzzle, or should we extend the time limits? Chris ---

        Hehe ... Im sure it was a great time there in Hungary. The norwegian
        press also published that a new world record was set as u might have
        seen from a link in earlier post here :-P It's insane the lack of
        knowledge and interest the norwegian press shows with cubing. They
        claimed they just used the text they got with a photo from a news
        agency. So much for press research ;-) Half a minute w google would have
        told them otherwise. A good thing coming from my contact with the press
        after reading that is that they told me to contact them again if i
        should go to future competitions ;-) It seems to be the case that the
        "poorer" the country is hosting cubing competitions the greater the
        organisation actually is. Ron was very overwhelmed by the competition in
        Poland earlier this autumn. And now a great competition in Hungary. Well
        Hungary is the home of the inventor of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube so i guess
        it's only expected. Dan and Jasmine, were u sponsored to go to this
        event? If so i'm very jealous :-o Anyway, back to my writing up my
        thesis :D Have fun! -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; I was impressed with how well organised the Hungarian competition
        was. &gt; There must have been quite a lot of pre-competition publicity
        as there &gt; were well over 100 competitors in total. I think I heard
        the number 130? &gt; This is far more than any other competition I've
        been to (other than &gt; Worlds 2005 of course). Also, as the
        competition and the cube show was &gt; staged in the middle of a
        shopping centre it meant that there were lots &gt; of general
        spectators, i.e. not just other cubers in the audience. &gt; &gt; BTW,
        my proudest moment was beating both Dan *and* Stefan in a 3x3x3 &gt;
        race on stage during the cube show! ;) &gt; &gt; Jasmine &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Hi all, &gt; &gt; I just got back from the Hungarian Nationals
        which you may or &gt; &gt; may not &gt; &gt; have seen media about. &gt;
        &gt; It was a fantastically well organised event, and the aim of the
        &gt; &gt; competition was to bring the cube back into peoples minds in
        &gt; &gt; Hungary, &gt; &gt; and also to try and break the old Hungarian
        Record. The event &gt; &gt; accomplished both goals, with several
        records broken and a best &gt; &gt; time &gt; &gt; of 18.21 (I think
        thats right). &gt; &gt; We then took part in the "Kocka Show" afterwards
        and showed off &gt; &gt; lots &gt; &gt; of different skills, Stefan and
        I did team-blindfold solving, &gt; &gt; and also &gt; &gt; blindfolded -
        where Stefan successfully solved followed by &gt; &gt; tumultuous &gt;
        &gt; applause; and Jasmine, Stefan and I took part in lots of races &gt;
        &gt; of all &gt; &gt; sorts with the Hungarians. I also beat Stefan by
        less than 0.5 &gt; &gt; seconds &gt; &gt; on the 4x4x4, bad luck mate!
        My proudest moment was setting the &gt; &gt; fastest time of the day on
        stage, 15.87. &gt; &gt; I also set an 11.24 seconds solve while being
        solved by a TV &gt; &gt; news &gt; &gt; crew, so I am looking forward to
        seeing the video of that. It &gt; &gt; was &gt; &gt; scrambled by Stefan
        and timed on his stopwatch, so I guess the &gt; &gt; time &gt; &gt;
        maybe inaccurate, but we will be able to tell from the video :) &gt;
        &gt; The city was also beautiful (Budapest), and the Hungarians were
        &gt; &gt; very friendly and welcoming to all. &gt; &gt; If the European
        Championship of 2006 will be held in Budapest, &gt; &gt; then I &gt;
        &gt; think it would be a superb event. Because the cube a national &gt;
        &gt; treasure, there is SO SO much more interest within the Hungarian
        &gt; &gt; public, the crowds that turned up were even bigger than at the
        &gt; &gt; World &gt; &gt; Champs! And the media guys did a great job of
        publicising the &gt; &gt; event, &gt; &gt; and making sure it ran
        smoothly. &gt; &gt; I will definitely be voting for EC2006 in Hungary.
        &gt; &gt; I've almost sorted my webhosting out now, so when it's back up
        I &gt; &gt; will &gt; &gt; add pics from DCD2005, WC2005, and Hungarian
        Nationals as well &gt; &gt; as &gt; &gt; reports for all, updated FMC
        and lots more stuff I promise! &gt; &gt; Dan :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi! if it will be possible to buy the 6x6x6 olympicube somewhere online
        i will buy 2pieces assuming price is less then $100. If the price is
        higher i have to consider how much i really need to have 2. Anyhow i'm
        afraid they won't be around for too long after release and will become
        collector's items. But i could be wrong also. Maybe it's actually a good
        idea to have Mefferts or Seventowns/Winning moves take over the
        manufacturing/distribution of the cube? These companies have quite a
        solid economy and will assure that the cube can be produced for a
        prolonged time. Anyhow i guess that if the cube turns well a single time
        of less than 3 minutes will be achieved after a while. I can see that
        might happen with my method if the blocks come up nicely :-) As for
        parity it pretty much depends on which method u are going to use.
        Treating edges "singularly" and not as "quedges" or "3x3x3 edges" i will
        have 2 parities for my method. For the common pairing-up method there
        will also be 2 parities after all the "quedges" have come together.
        Getting the last few quedges together might prove quite cumbersome
        though. I guess one needs to resort to pure 3-cycles or other tricks. A
        "quedge" can be flipped with the well know algorithm from the 4x4x4 cube
        simply treating the 6x6x6 cube as a 4x4x4 cube (1-2-2- 1). I hope that
        should make sense to everyone. This also means there will be algs fixing
        both parities in one go, again treating the cube 1-2-2-1. What i suspect
        becomes more cumbersome in general as cube size increases is to find
        (recognise) edges for pairing up. Again i could be wrong. Just because i
        find it awkward doesn't mean everyone finds it awkward. Anyhow it will
        be interesting to see how my method (cage) and the reductionist approach
        (centers first, pairing up edges) will compare timewise :-) Cheers! -Per

        You would need to make replacement parts if the internals are as &gt;

        top level big cube people who &gt; have a fast solution with lots of

        that with time, the record for the 6x6x6 may get to be &gt; around 3
        minutes. It &gt; &gt; looks as though the puzzles gain about a minute
        per solution as the &gt; sizes increase. Just &gt; &gt; my opinion
        though. As far as the popular solution method for the &gt; larger cubes,
        I don't &gt; &gt; believe that it gets any less efficient. There is
        still room for &gt; improvement with that &gt; &gt; method. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are two problems with this (as a general
        rule for larger cubes): &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. The number of pieces
        increases quadratically with the side &gt; length, not linearly, so it's
        &gt; &gt; not likely that the times would increase linearly (plus you
        only &gt; have 2 steps for this basis &gt; &gt; 3-&gt;4 and 4-&gt;5,
        unless you can solve the 2x2x2 in negative time!) The &gt; centres are
        the &gt; &gt; main limiting factor (the quadratic factor) - in the 3x3x3
        there are &gt; 6*1^2 centres (but &gt; &gt; nothing to do if not marked)
        but in the 4x4x4 there are 6*2^2=24 &gt; centres in the 5x5x5 &gt; &gt;
        there are 6*3^2 centres (48 if you don't count the very centres) but
        &gt; ther's 6*4^2=96 &gt; &gt; centres in a 6x6x6. This is probably why
        centres first is often used &gt; on these puzzles. &gt; &gt; There's a
        higher degree of freedom for the longest part which gives &gt; more
        speed. The &gt; &gt; edges (linear) and corners (constant) require less
        time so it's best &gt; to do them with more &gt; &gt; constraints. Doing
        the centres last puts more constraints on the &gt; largest part of the
        puzzle. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. It is harder to locate pieces.
        Admittedly, this isn't really an &gt; issue for 6x6x6 - it does &gt;
        &gt; become an issue in the really big cubes though. Try finding centre
        &gt; pieces on a cube of size &gt; &gt; 11x11x11 or bigger! This really
        slows things down on larger cubes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd imagine
        there's a further problem which is that the cube is &gt; probably less
        stable and &gt; &gt; more likely to break up/lock up at speed. The
        pieces will be smaller &gt; and even if the &gt; &gt; overlap problem is
        solved an increase in the number of slices means &gt; the cube is more
        &gt; &gt; likely to jam. If each slice is just a little off then things
        will &gt; build up quicker. This is only a &gt; &gt; problem for

        potential world &gt; records on 6x6x6 &gt; &gt; cubes reminds me of a
        &gt; &gt; &gt; conversation I had with Per in Florida at the WC. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do most people who plan on buying 6x6x6 cubes
        plan on using the same &gt; &gt; &gt; method as they do for smaller
        cubes (4x4x4 and 5x5x4) on the &gt; 6x6x4? It &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to me
        that as the cubes get larger, the widely-accepted &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Centers-Edges-3x3x3-Parity approach gets less and less efficient. &gt;
        What &gt; &gt; &gt; does everyone else think? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I really think it would be fantastic if we could
        order some for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Christmas, but that may be a bit too
        optimistic. Nonetheless, I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;going to have to get one
        ASAP. As for times, my gut feeling is to say &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that if
        the cubes turn well, 5 minutes will be hit by many of the top &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;cubers pretty quickly. Just a quick look at the data suggests
        &gt; that if &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you compare fastest time to number of
        pieces, then extrapolate the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;number of pieces needed
        to be placed on the 6x6x6 cube, I get that a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;world
        record time may be around 4:02 . I would certainly not be &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;surprised if this was high though! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt;&gt;Looking at Olympic Cubes' site and messages on Twisty it won't
        take &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;very long anymore for the 6x6x6 to be
        available for the public. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Personally I'm very
        excited about trying it out. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Does anybody has an
        idea about how it's going to be released? &gt; Will we &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;be able to order it off the Olympic Cubes site? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Also will the upcoming tournaments have
        6x6x6 events? What will the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;top times be like for
        the 6x6x6 after say 2 months of it's release? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

        what exactly to sand. I think he mentioned Grant Tregay's method for
        sanding down the inside bits of the outer edge pieces. Wait for him to
        post to make sure, but I think that's it. -Mike team [zb]

        Hi! Geocities has very low allocated bandwidths. Once a page there
        becomes really popular there it's as good as impossible to get access to
        it. Only good thing about geocities is that it is free and they have
        some tools to build ur homepage. But only use it if u don't expect many

        Ok ... So they do offer Plus and Pro packages now. The Pro package give
        u ur own domain name pluss 2GB file storage and 100 GB/month bandwidth
        for $8.95 month. I guess that is not bad but there are cheaper ones out
        there with unlimited bandwidth ... To have a clue what bandwidth might

        Umm ... On their site they say the following : "Furthermore, among many
        other great features, the Parcom 750 offers a generous amount of
        bandwidth--up to 30 gigabytes per month. Plus the setup is FREE!" This
        is not exactly unlimited but much higher than the geocities' free
        solution which offers 3 GB/month. Hosting pictures/galleries greatly
        increases the bandwidth. Use of thumbnails is a good idea :-) This makes
        me wonder what size webhosts consider to be unlimited bandwidth. Do
        domain hosts that offer TRUE unlimited bandwidths really exist?? I
        recall last yearr speedcubing.com hit the roof on its bandwidth due to
        hosting a rather large video. I think this was sorted out by deleting
        the video and opting for a more expensive package. Have fun! -Per &gt;

        I don't think it's a bandwidth issue, it's a 'page cannot be found'
        issue. I use geocities too so I know that it has low bandwidth limits.
        If the problem is just that the page has exceeded the bandwidth limit
        then the error message says so and tells the user to try again later.

        &gt; Hi! &gt; Geocities has very low allocated bandwidths. Once a page
        there &gt; becomes really popular there it's as good as impossible to
        get &gt; access to it. Only good thing about geocities is that it is
        free &gt; and &gt; they have some tools to build ur homepage. But only
        use it if u &gt; don't expect many visitors ... sorry Jon :-o &gt;
        Cheers! &gt; -Per &gt; PS! Im not sure whether geocities has options to
        pay for more &gt; bandwidth. Long time since i checked it :D &gt; &gt;

        Hey everyone, I've been doing some thinking lately on these two
        strategies and wanted to post about it. I'm going to even rewrite my
        Xcross page to include this, as I really really like it. I think people
        who use Xcross need to seriously consider also using opposite cross. I
        learned about opposite cross from Richard Patterson, and basically I
        solve either a white or yellow cross. I know people think this could be
        slower, but one of my 14's and I'm pretty sure my 12.xx at the RWC2005
        were done with opposite cross (yellow for me). Also, here is some math
        that is very promising. I do Xcross on a single face probably about 25%
        of the time. Since I now solve opposite cross though, my odds for an
        Xcross is 25% for yellow and also 25% for white. So I have an overall
        chance of 1- (3/4)^2 = 7/16 = 43.75% chance of getting an Xcross. I had
        recently noticed that I was getting Xcross solves much more often than I
        used to, and the reason is I now have a 43% chance of getting one rather
        than only 25% or so. I know opinions vary on solving other colors, but I
        like opposite cross since it keeps your F2L edges the same. Also it
        almost doubles my chances of an Xcross right now, and that is seriously
        helping my times. Also it works under pressure, I had I think 3 opposite
        cross solves in competition at the RWC, and I've used it at Caltech
        Dallas as well. So anyway, I'm going to include this on my Xcross site,
        but I wanted to post here as I have definitely become a convert to
        opposite cross. I am now definitely an opposite cross and Xcross solver
        :-) (Richard, thanks so much for the opposite cross idea!!!) :-D Chris

        &gt; &gt; Just to take a philisophical turn, I do believe that some
        people are &gt; &gt; just meant to be better cubers for reasons like
        faster reflexes, &gt; &gt; better visual spacial skills, etc. &gt; &gt;
        Otherwise, for the most part, pretty &gt; much anyone can be sub-20.
        Sub-15... is another story, and is like the &gt; 3:50 mile. I do agree
        that some of us just have more of a natural knack than others at certain
        types of activities. Me personally, I am much better at verbal-type
        games than spatial ones. (I wish my interests were in the same direction
        as my abilities!) For me, psychology is the major blocking point. If you
        find yourself like me, in the below-average category for learning
        speedcubing, you'll need to have proportionately more perseverence.
        Probably much more. I just don't seem to have it. After several 50+
        second solves in a row, my mind goes berzerk. "Slow as molasses!" "I'm
        getting worse!" "I can't even beat some 6-year-old kid from Korea!" and
        that's it, I'm done for the day. At this point, I don't have the mindset
        of a speedcuber, even if the potential is there.

        I'm not an expert with the cross, but starting from either white or
        yellow (opposite side) is a Good Idea, since it does not really change
        the rest of the algorithm. That's why the standard color scheme is
        interesting. I used it as a fallback strategy, now starting with white
        or yellow does not matter anymore. More and more, the problem is to find
        a cube that does not look lucky. Gilles. --- In

        &gt; I'm going to even rewrite my Xcross page to include this, as I &gt;
        really really like it. I think people who use Xcross need to &gt;
        seriously consider also using opposite cross. &gt; &gt; I learned about
        opposite cross from Richard Patterson, and basically &gt; I solve either
        a white or yellow cross. I know people think this &gt; could be slower,
        but one of my 14's and I'm pretty sure my 12.xx at &gt; the RWC2005 were
        done with opposite cross (yellow for me). &gt; &gt; Also, here is some
        math that is very promising. &gt; &gt; I do Xcross on a single face
        probably about 25% of the time. Since &gt; I now solve opposite cross
        though, my odds for an Xcross is 25% for &gt; yellow and also 25% for
        white. So I have an overall chance of 1- &gt; (3/4)^2 = 7/16 = 43.75%
        chance of getting an Xcross. &gt; &gt; I had recently noticed that I was
        getting Xcross solves much more &gt; often than I used to, and the
        reason is I now have a 43% chance of &gt; getting one rather than only
        25% or so. &gt; &gt; I know opinions vary on solving other colors, but I
        like opposite &gt; cross since it keeps your F2L edges the same. Also it
        almost &gt; doubles my chances of an Xcross right now, and that is
        seriously &gt; helping my times. &gt; &gt; Also it works under pressure,
        I had I think 3 opposite cross solves &gt; in competition at the RWC,
        and I've used it at Caltech Dallas as &gt; well. &gt; &gt; So anyway,
        I'm going to include this on my Xcross site, but I wanted &gt; to post
        here as I have definitely become a convert to opposite &gt; cross. I am
        now definitely an opposite cross and Xcross solver :-) &gt; (Richard,
        thanks so much for the opposite cross idea!!!) :-D &gt; &gt; Chris &gt;

        I'll be surprised if the price tops $100 USD, but I guess it depends on
        how many they make and how big the demand is. If they become rare, I'm
        sure they'll fetch that and more on Ebay. As for speedcubing with it,
        the video on their site demonstrates the ability to "shortcut"
        single-layer and double-layer twists (i.e. turn R while U and/or U1 are
        misaligned). They also depict using the index finger to quickly twist
        the U face, as well as the U1 layer. So it seems that speedcubing would
        certainly be possible. Chris --- In

        The idea looks good, but I'm bad on solving opposite color...usually I
        get confused with the pieces, and insert a white corner on the yellow

        I am also trying to get my cross faster, and I rather find the color
        rules very useful (at least in the beginning, until you get very

        I am a newer cuber, about 2-3 ago I realized the world of speedcubing,
        at that point I timed myself and couldn't get any faster than 5min, when
        lucky - I was using my method, very slow. After looking at corners
        first, Fridrich, 2x2x3 build, etc I decided that for the amount of time
        I had available some were to complicated. So I use an intuitive Fridrich
        to get a 2x2x3 block, then use Lars to orientate the edges and finish
        the rest of the cube. Eventually I will probably use Fridrich to finish
        the LL. The reason I tell you is I just got 5 solves in a row under a
        minute, 2 of which under 50sec., only one was a lucky solve. I pause
        alot to figure out my next move, once recognition sets in I know I will
        reach 30sec, maybe faster. To move any faster, I will eventually have to
        stick with one method, but 'till then... Keep Cubing ERic

        Hello Everyone After completely switching to Gilles Roux's method, I
        have achieved a sub 30 average in my first 3 weeks of practice. My Best
        ROUX solve is 21.21 sec. (25.00), 26.87, 33.70, 27.28, 25.00, 26.05,
        33.56, 32.90, 29.48, 33.65, 30.15, (34.28) AVG 29.86 It took me like 7
        months to get sub 30 with CFOP, so I am pretty happy with how well this
        system is working for me. If I had to start all over, I would not learn
        OLL/PLL at all. I would either learn CLL/ELL or I might have done a 3
        look LL. OLL and PLL is 78 algorithms if memory serves correct. THis
        approach would be less. 46 ALgs for last layer. 1. Orient Edges (2 algs,
        5/6 of the time) 2. COLL ( 40 algs, if im not mistaken) 3. Permute edges
        (4 algs, 11/12 of the time) with ZBF2L, you could eliminate the first
        look entirely, for a very fast LL. But all you team[zb] guys will soon
        prove this method to be better than OLL/PLL. Another good option is
        Petrus with COLL. If the corners are already positioned, there are many
        cases to learn to do the LL in one Algorithm (Step 6/7 index). All of
        these cases are comprised of 2 smaller, familiar sequences, making them
        easy to learn. As is turns out, Im gonna go with Roux's method. But dont
        know too many CLL algs yet. I dont use any CLL in my solves yet, I want
        to wait until I have them all down. I Need CLL algs from anybody who can
        help me out. I want to look for the shortest algs for each case. Thank
        you, and Im so sorry for rambling on... Jason Kovacic Kovacic81@...

        Fantastic! More roux solvers! I've just hit sub-30 and I'm on the trail
        to sub-20, 18, 15, etc. My best roux solve is 20.60 though ;) I found
        that omsetimes, my averages would be all over the place, but I'm
        settling down now. CLL is nice and I have about 40% of CLL/COLL learnt.
        the reason I've learnt some COLL is because I wanted to use the COLL
        recognition system, so I learnt a load of COLL cases to get used to it.
        Eventually I'll be using A full CLL. But that a way off yet. Plus, some
        COLL algs are nicer. D's and L's arn't too nice :S Yeah, I've been
        comprising a big list of CLL/COLL algs I use/will be using if you want
        it. I'll finish it and send you a copy. Oh, I'd still recommend learning
        PLL. It comes in so handy for BLD cubing. (Well, 3-cycles anyway). What
        I need is help with the first two blocks :S Any tips? Even my pair and
        insert (the last bit of the second one) is quite bad). We need some kind
        of F2B algorithm tables ;) Apart from that, try and nag gilles to update
        his site :) ~ThomKirjava --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        The major problem I've found with doing opposite cross are the corners.
        I've been training myself for a long time to able to recognize a corner
        from only two stickers, and if I switch to opposite cross the color
        schemes of the corners are all backwards, which slows me down
        considerably. -James Stuber _____ From:

        Xcross and opposite cross compliment eachother so well I'm not an expert
        with the cross, but starting from either white or yellow (opposite side)
        is a Good Idea, since it does not really change the rest of the
        algorithm. That's why the standard color scheme is interesting. I used
        it as a fallback strategy, now starting with white or yellow does not
        matter anymore. More and more, the problem is to find a cube that does
        not look lucky. Gilles. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I've been doing some thinking lately on these two strategies and &gt;
        wanted to post about it. &gt; &gt; I'm going to even rewrite my Xcross
        page to include this, as I &gt; really really like it. I think people
        who use Xcross need to &gt; seriously consider also using opposite
        cross. &gt; &gt; I learned about opposite cross from Richard Patterson,
        and basically &gt; I solve either a white or yellow cross. I know people
        think this &gt; could be slower, but one of my 14's and I'm pretty sure
        my 12.xx at &gt; the RWC2005 were done with opposite cross (yellow for
        me). &gt; &gt; Also, here is some math that is very promising. &gt; &gt;
        I do Xcross on a single face probably about 25% of the time. Since &gt;
        I now solve opposite cross though, my odds for an Xcross is 25% for &gt;
        yellow and also 25% for white. So I have an overall chance of 1- &gt;
        (3/4)^2 = 7/16 = 43.75% chance of getting an Xcross. &gt; &gt; I had
        recently noticed that I was getting Xcross solves much more &gt; often
        than I used to, and the reason is I now have a 43% chance of &gt;
        getting one rather than only 25% or so. &gt; &gt; I know opinions vary
        on solving other colors, but I like opposite &gt; cross since it keeps
        your F2L edges the same. Also it almost &gt; doubles my chances of an
        Xcross right now, and that is seriously &gt; helping my times. &gt; &gt;
        Also it works under pressure, I had I think 3 opposite cross solves &gt;
        in competition at the RWC, and I've used it at Caltech Dallas as &gt;
        well. &gt; &gt; So anyway, I'm going to include this on my Xcross site,
        but I wanted &gt; to post here as I have definitely become a convert to
        opposite &gt; cross. I am now definitely an opposite cross and Xcross
        solver :-) &gt; (Richard, thanks so much for the opposite cross idea!!!)

        cubestation.co.uk, it's going to be a lot easier for you to post your
        profiles on my site and share your cubing CV with the rest of the world.
        It will work similar to the new UWR format, you send in your details, or
        update your details, I approve it, and then the page goes live. So I'm
        just asking you, what categories would you like to see? Hopefully I can
        put up fields for most puzzle categories, so you could also use it as a
        way of keeping track of your progress in speedcubing. Tell me what you

        It's great that more people are beginning to take an interest in the
        Roux method. It's got so much potential, it just doesn't seem widely
        known, yet. I've recently begun learning ZBF2L intuitively (for the most
        part) in an effort to better my times. I only really have 3 or so cases
        down for sure, but it really works wonders for your times. I've also
        recently finished learning the rest of COLL, which is a fantastic
        system. My normal average is now between 20 and 21, with my best times
        in the 14's. I recognize the cases the same way as on Gilles Roux's
        site, so hopefully my advice will apply to you guys some. I decided to
        take a few days off from ZB learning and devote time to the Roux method.
        And despite not really working on it in months, earlier today I averaged
        20.11 (so close! XP) with a new best time of 15.67. I'm still using the
        second method for orienting and placing the final edges, and I haven't
        learned any of the special shortened cases. Also, there's really only
        one case where I use a CLL instead of the COLL, just because that's what
        I know. Anyway, here are the tips I've got. For the 1x2x3 blocks: GO
        SLOWLY. Especially at first. It's easy to get a good pace going for the
        first block with inspection and forget to slow down for the second. It's
        important. Work at it. Also, try to have several tricks for doing each
        block. Know how to match a corner and edge and insert. Know how to
        insert an edge in any of the three spots on each block, and know how to
        use block starts like in the Petrus method. For the corners: Don't learn
        them in the order on the Roux site. Learn the T and U and L cases first.
        There are 5+1 reflection for the first two, and 4+2 reflections for the
        last. I think this covers the bulk of cases you run into. After that,
        it's up to you, but it will be smoother sailing because you're more used
        to it. Also, try to use everything you've learned all the time during
        solving. Even the things you've only learned an hour before. Don't worry
        about how long it takes you to remember the alg. Just do it. The more
        you force yourself to actively use them, the better you will get at
        them. Practice. The final six edges is a very important step. Learn the
        algs to orient the cases as well as you possibly can. They should be
        second nature. You need to be able to perform the ones for the longest
        cases (all edges oriented wrong) in under 3 seconds. Also, work on
        finding good ways to place the UR and UL edges as you're finishing
        orienting so that it becomes one fluid step. This may take a while (it
        was the hardest part for me). After you've got all this down, move on to
        the third method for recognizing the last six edges, and learn the
        special cases. There are only 26 or so, so it shouldn't be too bad. But
        sub 20 is definitely possible without them, so don't give up. -Mike team

        time) &gt; 2. COLL ( 40 algs, if im not mistaken) &gt; 3. Permute edges
        (4 algs, 11/12 of the time) &gt; &gt; with ZBF2L, you could eliminate
        the first look entirely, for a very &gt; fast LL. But all you team[zb]
        guys will soon prove this method to be &gt; better than OLL/PLL. &gt;
        &gt; Another good option is Petrus with COLL. If the corners are already
        &gt; positioned, there are many cases to learn to do the LL in one &gt;
        Algorithm (Step 6/7 index). All of these cases are comprised of 2 &gt;
        smaller, familiar sequences, making them easy to learn. &gt; &gt; As is
        turns out, Im gonna go with Roux's method. But dont know too &gt; many
        CLL algs yet. I dont use any CLL in my solves yet, I want to &gt; wait
        until I have them all down. I Need CLL algs from anybody who can &gt;
        help me out. I want to look for the shortest algs for each case. &gt;
        &gt; Thank you, &gt; and Im so sorry for rambling on... &gt; &gt; Jason

        typing built up our left hand's dexterity. I know a lot of cubers

        Hi All, I can do the 2 longest ones (in my mind) pretty fast is my cube
        doesn't lock up, but the whle step is still pretty slow for me. I have
        tried reading the other 2 methods (I currently use #2), but I have had
        no luck at learning them. Perhaps I am missing something? I'll go back
        and read them again this weekend and hopefully make some sense of them.
        I also have a few more plans for the weekend: Solve 2 3x3x3's
        blindfolded and also start learing CLL which I have put off for so long.
        I figure having a long holiday break was a good time to start. :) Wish
        me luck! Peter Greenwood --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        that more people are beginning to take an interest in the &gt; Roux
        method. It's got so much potential, it just doesn't seem widely &gt;
        known, yet. &gt; &gt; I've recently begun learning ZBF2L intuitively
        (for the most part) in &gt; an effort to better my times. I only really
        have 3 or so cases down &gt; for sure, but it really works wonders for
        your times. I've also &gt; recently finished learning the rest of COLL,
        which is a fantastic &gt; system. My normal average is now between 20
        and 21, with my best &gt; times in the 14's. I recognize the cases the
        same way as on Gilles &gt; Roux's site, so hopefully my advice will
        apply to you guys some. &gt; &gt; I decided to take a few days off from
        ZB learning and devote time to &gt; the Roux method. And despite not
        really working on it in months, &gt; earlier today I averaged 20.11 (so
        close! XP) with a new best time of &gt; 15.67. I'm still using the
        second method for orienting and placing &gt; the final edges, and I
        haven't learned any of the special shortened &gt; cases. Also, there's
        really only one case where I use a CLL instead &gt; of the COLL, just
        because that's what I know. Anyway, here are the &gt; tips I've got.
        &gt; &gt; For the 1x2x3 blocks: GO SLOWLY. Especially at first. It's
        easy to &gt; get a good pace going for the first block with inspection
        and forget &gt; to slow down for the second. It's important. Work at it.
        &gt; &gt; Also, try to have several tricks for doing each block. Know
        how to &gt; match a corner and edge and insert. Know how to insert an
        edge in any &gt; of the three spots on each block, and know how to use
        block starts &gt; like in the Petrus method. &gt; &gt; For the corners:
        Don't learn them in the order on the Roux site. &gt; Learn the T and U
        and L cases first. There are 5+1 reflection for the &gt; first two, and
        4+2 reflections for the last. I think this covers the &gt; bulk of cases
        you run into. After that, it's up to you, but it will &gt; be smoother
        sailing because you're more used to it. &gt; &gt; Also, try to use
        everything you've learned all the time during &gt; solving. Even the
        things you've only learned an hour before. Don't &gt; worry about how
        long it takes you to remember the alg. Just do it. &gt; The more you
        force yourself to actively use them, the better you will &gt; get at
        them. Practice. &gt; &gt; The final six edges is a very important step.
        Learn the algs to &gt; orient the cases as well as you possibly can.
        They should be second &gt; nature. You need to be able to perform the
        ones for the longest cases &gt; (all edges oriented wrong) in under 3
        seconds. Also, work on finding &gt; good ways to place the UR and UL
        edges as you're finishing orienting &gt; so that it becomes one fluid
        step. This may take a while (it was the &gt; hardest part for me). &gt;
        &gt; After you've got all this down, move on to the third method for
        &gt; recognizing the last six edges, and learn the special cases. There
        &gt; are only 26 or so, so it shouldn't be too bad. But sub 20 is &gt;
        definitely possible without them, so don't give up. &gt; &gt; -Mike &gt;

        I think that for CFOP, the extended cross is always the way to go. I
        would pretty much always start with a 2x2 block and then finish the
        Xcross. Usually I could see a 2x2x1 Block and build it, and then insert
        the last edge to make the 2x2. ANd THEN find the remaining 2 edges and
        put them in to finish the X-cross. With the Roux method, you take it one
        step further. You build a 2x2x1 block, but instead of looking for just
        one edge to insert, you have to find 2 pieces. Find an edge and a corner
        and pair them up an insert, to make a 3x2x1 block. Or you can insert an
        edge or corner right away, and then find and insert the other piece.
        Though i think that this is slower... Cross 4 pieces 2x2 Block 4 pieces
        Extended Cross 6 pieces Gille's Block 5 pieces Its harder than a cross
        or petrus block, but easier than DIRECTLy solving for X-cross. FOR ALL
        YOU ROUX SOLVERS For the 2nd Block, I always find the DR edge and insert
        as quickly as possible. Then I just solve the 2 CE pairs with an all too
        familiar F2L strategy. Howerver, There are MANY shortcuts you can find
        by using the M slice. A F2L style chart with algorithms would be twice
        as big for this method. There are many more places that a Corner and an
        edge can be simultaneously. I never used F2L charts to learn F2L. In
        ROUX and F2L, I think that Intuition is better. 1. What color scheme do
        you guys use for ROux? I use white and yellow blocks always, with red or
        orange on bottom. 2. How fast can you guys do step 4? Gilles told me
        that he uses Method 2 as his main method, and that a 4.5 sec avg is
        possible with this method alone. Im at about 7-8 Sec.. Jason Kovacic

        Hey guys.. I was just playing around with the 4x4, and I found a nice
        way to flip three edges while fixing the OLL parity on the 4x4. It's
        just the normal parity fix: (Rr)2 B2 U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)' U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr)
        F2 (Ll)' B2 (Rr)2 But when you add B'R' at the beginning, and RB at the
        end, you 'flip' three edge groups. I am probably not the first person to
        think about this, but I've never seen this before.. Cyou, Jo√´l. PS.: Oh,

        Hey Alexander, I've been using that same alg for some time now, only
        backwards. Tell me what you think of this. I prefer this alg left
        handed, so I do it as: L2 U L2 U L2 U' F' U' F L2 F' U F And with finger
        tricks [(L')2 U (L')2 (U) L2 (U')] y (L' U' L) B2 (L' U L) That first
        trigger takes some explanation, do the first (L')2 U (L')2 exactly as
        you would do L' U L' only with double turns instead of quarter turns.
        Then do the next U with your right index finger. Then do the L2
        clockwise and then the next U' with your left ring finger. This is all
        one long trigger, and is extraordinarily fast. The last part is pretty
        self explanatory. Here's an average for that alg (2.20) 2.38 3.11 2.25
        2.92 2.63 3.24 3.11 (3.50) 2.53 2.54 3.16 = 2.79 Also I just timed that
        first trigger (6 moves) and I got 1.18, 1.35, 1.06, 1.44, 1.08 The alg
        is really good when it's done smoothly, and really bad when it's not
        done smoothly. If you do the first trigger well then you usually get a
        fast time. If you lockup though then your execution will be slow. So I
        guess it's not the best alg, but it's one that fits my hands pretty
        well. My two cents, :-) Chris --- In

        &gt; &gt; I was just playing around with the 4x4, and I found a nice way
        to &gt; &gt; flip three edges while fixing the OLL parity on the 4x4.
        It's just &gt; &gt; the normal parity fix: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Rr)2 B2
        U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)' U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)' B2 (Rr)2 &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; But when you add B'R' at the beginning, and RB at the end, &gt;
        &gt; you 'flip' three edge groups. I am probably not the first person
        &gt; to &gt; &gt; think about this, but I've never seen this before..

        I've been using that same alg for some time now, only backwards. Tell
        &gt; me what you think of this. &gt; &gt; I prefer this alg left handed,
        so I do it as: &gt; L2 U L2 U L2 U' F' U' F L2 F' U F &gt; &gt; And with
        finger tricks &gt; [(L')2 U (L')2 (U) L2 (U')] y (L' U' L) B2 (L' U L)
        &gt; &gt; That first trigger takes some explanation, do the first (L')2
        U (L')2 &gt; exactly as you would do L' U L' only with double turns
        instead of &gt; quarter turns. Then do the next U with your right index
        finger. Then &gt; do the L2 clockwise and then the next U' with your
        left ring finger. &gt; &gt; This is all one long trigger, and is
        extraordinarily fast. The last &gt; part is pretty self explanatory.
        &gt; &gt; Here's an average for that alg &gt; (2.20) 2.38 3.11 2.25 2.92
        2.63 3.24 3.11 (3.50) 2.53 2.54 3.16 = 2.79 &gt; &gt; Also I just timed
        that first trigger (6 moves) and I got 1.18, 1.35, &gt; 1.06, 1.44, 1.08
        &gt; &gt; The alg is really good when it's done smoothly, and really bad
        when &gt; it's not done smoothly. If you do the first trigger well then
        you &gt; usually get a fast time. If you lockup though then your
        execution &gt; will be slow. So I guess it's not the best alg, but it's
        one that &gt; fits my hands pretty well. &gt; &gt; My two cents, :-)

        Hey everyone, I really can't stress how important I think this should be
        to solving. I know people have preferences for being able to recognize
        one color to speed things up. However, having said that I wrote a short
        page as an addendum to my extended cross section. I feel the material on
        the page speaks for itself, so the page is simple. I just want to point
        out exactly why I am so strongly in favor of this strategy. Even if you
        don't use extended cross I very strongly ask you to consider still using
        opposite color solving. http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/ec-oc.html It
        helps the odds of a good solve so much, that I no longer feel the color
        recognition gained from using the same color is enough. I feel with
        practice, the slightly slower recognition could be overcome by the odds
        of getting a better solve this way. I will try not to be annoying about
        this, but please read the page and consider. Chris

        Dear Friends, First of all let me introduce my self. My name is
        Konstantinos Verdes from Greece. I am 30 years old and my profession is
        surveying engineering. I am the son of Panayiotis Verdes who is the
        inventor of the Olympicube range, or better the NxNxN Cube. My father
        profession, also, is surveying engineering and for 2+1/2 years the
        cube-puzzle designs and construction. For about 2 years i TRY to read
        your discussions about speedcubing. I must tell that it was very
        difficult for me to ¬ìcatch¬î you at the beginning. You see i only Knew how
        to solve the 3x3x3 Rubik¬ís Cube and that back to late 80¬ís. Now i can
        solve any size (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6) but not in the sense
        of speedcubing. As you can imagine when my father told me about his
        invention i begun to search over the internet and then i found your
        really interesting and hardcore discussion group. I must admit that you
        are all fantastic and i really enjoy trying to follow your mind. I think
        that i want to write sooooo much but I will try to answer as good as my
        poor English allows me, some subjects that this topic brings. Koen
        writes: &gt; ¬ìLooking at Olympic Cubes' site and messages on &gt; Twisty
        it won't take very long anymore for the 6x6x6 &gt; to be available for

        Does anybody has an idea about how it's going to be &gt;released? Will
        we be able to order it off the Olympic &gt; Cubes site? &gt; Also will
        the upcoming tournaments have 6x6x6 events? &gt;What will the &gt; top
        times be like for the 6x6x6 after say 2 months &gt; of release?¬î You are
        right Koen. The OlympiCube No6a will be available for the public
        soon-during the 2006. You will be able to order it through our web-site
        which by the way will change completely during the next 5-6 months. You
        will also be able to find it in many stores, that i cannot tell it yet.
        I don¬ít know yet if the OlympiCube No6a will be include in yours events
        but i am sure that in the future we will also organize same events-open
        to any kind of cube i.e Rubik¬ís-Mefferts-Eastsheen-Olympicubes and let
        the athletes decide. As far for the time i cannot tell much. I solve the
        OlympiCube No6a in about 15-20 minutes using beginners techniques. I am
        sure that all of you laughing with that time. Also i don¬ít Know which
        cube will be better for speedcubing the No6a or the No6b because we
        haven¬ít constructed the last one YET. Game of Death wrote: &gt; I'd

        The pieces &gt; will be smaller and even if the &gt; overlap problem is
        solved an increase in the number &gt; of slices means the cube is more
        likely to jam. &gt; Chris wrote: &gt; There is another practical
        problem. If the cube is &gt; expensive, and &gt; replacement parts are
        not available, what happens if &gt; by speedcubing &gt; you break it?
        &gt; You would need to make replacement parts if the &gt; internals are
        as &gt; delicate as they sound, and if those are expensive &gt; you have
        a whole &gt; other issue. The OlympiCube No 6a is very stable. Much more
        than all the Known cubes of any size. I know that you are crazy and the
        meaning of stability to you maybe is different than the other common
        people, but if i think the other cubes that i have in hands then the
        surprise directly when you open the box of the OlympiCube No6a will be
        huge. As far as it depends the replacing parts we will discuss it when
        the time comes and we will sure find a solution. But I assure you that
        the internals are not fragile-delicates and i don¬ít think that you will
        easily break a piece. The pops also don¬ít happen while i speedscrambling
        the cube. I must also want to tell in public that i already talked -off
        the record-with two Champions ¬ìFrank Morris¬î and ¬ìPer Kristen Fredlund¬î and
        we will invite them to video-test the OlympiCube No5, the OlympiCube
        No6a and the OlympiCube No7 during 2006. The price of these products
        will be quite reasonable and approachable for such monsters but i can¬ít
        tell it yet. The OlympiCube invention is patented in Greece and patented

        please please tell me you only do it for the money, the fame or
        spreading cubing, but not for meeting chicks who think the square root
        of 100 is 5 or who claim their IQ is 3000. Or do they maybe just pretend

        understand percentages, how many percent are that?" and he couldn't find
        an answer...

        Hi Stefan, maybe you forgot about the 23 years that noone couldn't even
        think to produce the 6x6x6 or the 7x7x7. I don't try to find excuses but

        Cheers! Stefan Dear Friends, First of all let me introduce my self. My
        name is Konstantinos Verdes from Greece. I am 30 years old and my
        profession is surveying engineering. I am the son of Panayiotis Verdes
        who is the inventor of the Olympicube range, or better the NxNxN Cube.
        My father profession, also, is surveying engineering and for 2+1/2 years
        the cube-puzzle designs and construction. For about 2 years i TRY to
        read your discussions about speedcubing. I must tell that it was very
        difficult for me to ¬ìcatch¬î you at the beginning. You see i only Knew how
        to solve the 3x3x3 Rubik¬ís Cube and that back to late 80¬ís. Now i can
        solve any size (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6) but not in the sense
        of speedcubing. As you can imagine when my father told me about his
        invention i begun to search over the internet and then i found your
        really interesting and hardcore discussion group. I must admit that you
        are all fantastic and i really enjoy trying to follow your mind. I think
        that i want to write sooooo much but I will try to answer as good as my
        poor English allows me, some subjects that this topic brings. Koen
        writes: &gt; ¬ìLooking at Olympic Cubes' site and messages on &gt; Twisty

        the upcoming tournaments have 6x6x6 events? &gt;What will the &gt; top
        times be like for the 6x6x6 after say 2 months &gt; of release?¬î You are
        right Koen. The OlympiCube No6a will be available for the public
        soon-during the 2006. You will be able to order it through our web-site
        which by the way will change completely during the next 5-6 months. You
        will also be able to find it in many stores, that i cannot tell it yet.
        I don¬ít know yet if the OlympiCube No6a will be include in yours events
        but i am sure that in the future we will also organize same events-open
        to any kind of cube i.e Rubik¬ís-Mefferts-Eastsheen-Olympicubes and let
        the athletes decide. As far for the time i cannot tell much. I solve the
        OlympiCube No6a in about 15-20 minutes using beginners techniques. I am
        sure that all of you laughing with that time. Also i don¬ít Know which
        cube will be better for speedcubing the No6a or the No6b because we
        haven¬ít constructed the last one YET. Game of Death wrote: &gt; I'd
        imagine there's a further problem which is that &gt; the cube is
        probably less stable and &gt; more likely to break up/lock up at speed.
        The pieces &gt; will be smaller and even if the &gt; overlap problem is
        solved an increase in the number &gt; of slices means the cube is more
        likely to jam. &gt; Chris wrote: &gt; There is another practical
        problem. If the cube is &gt; expensive, and &gt; replacement parts are
        not available, what happens if &gt; by speedcubing &gt; you break it?
        &gt; You would need to make replacement parts if the &gt; internals are
        as &gt; delicate as they sound, and if those are expensive &gt; you have
        a whole &gt; other issue. The OlympiCube No 6a is very stable. Much more
        than all the Known cubes of any size. I know that you are crazy and the
        meaning of stability to you maybe is different than the other common
        people, but if i think the other cubes that i have in hands then the
        surprise directly when you open the box of the OlympiCube No6a will be
        huge. As far as it depends the replacing parts we will discuss it when
        the time comes and we will sure find a solution. But I assure you that
        the internals are not fragile-delicates and i don¬ít think that you will
        easily break a piece. The pops also don¬ít happen while i speedscrambling
        the cube. I must also want to tell in public that i already talked -off
        the record-with two Champions ¬ìFrank Morris¬î and ¬ìPer Kristen Fredlund¬î and
        we will invite them to video-test the OlympiCube No5, the OlympiCube
        No6a and the OlympiCube No7 during 2006. The price of these products
        will be quite reasonable and approachable for such monsters but i can¬ít
        tell it yet. The OlympiCube invention is patented in Greece and patented
        pending in 21 countries+European Union, that is the the three quarters
        of the ¬ìKnown¬î world. We follow successfully all the necessary legal steps
        and we will also start the trademark procedure during the next month. I
        may show you our logo soon. Finally i would like to invite anyone who
        thinks that is able to write solutions ( for beginners, for intermediate

        Those improvements alone will already encourage me to keep my times more
        updated. You know, when I improved my master magic record from 2. 68 to
        2.67 I didn't submit it because I thought this very small improvement is
        not worth bothering Ron with extra work. Thanks Lars and Ron! Some
        further suggestions: - Show all records of a certain person, including
        the rank in each category. - Make it show N last posts and let us choose
        N other than 50. - Show last N posts that got into the top T in their
        category and let us choose T. Because to be honest, I'm not interested
        in a guy I don't know who just broke 2 minutes with the 3x3. Cheers!

        it should not be necessary anymore to send an e-mail &gt; &gt; with a

        &gt; This is the first step to automating the UWR record updates. &gt;

        &gt; &gt; 1) after I approve a record, it will automatically appear on
        the &gt; &gt; record lists (this would make a HUGE difference for me!)
        :-) &gt; &gt; 2) new page with 50 latest posted records (for visitors to
        see what &gt; &gt; changed recently) &gt; &gt; 3) trusted posters can
        update their own records (yet even less work &gt; &gt; for me) &gt; &gt;
        4) one e-mail address + website reference across all pages (at the &gt;

        Konstantinos Hi Konstantinos, No, it's just that last year I was very
        excited to hear about your new cubes and when you said we could buy them
        very soon I got even more excited, and then those dates passed by and we
        didn't hear much from you about the progress. Maybe you need to be a
        hardcore cuber to imagine how hard it is having to wait for such a
        puzzle ;-). And in those 23 years is was not hard because we weren't
        really waiting for it... So now I'm just a bit more realistic. I know
        from myself that I want to do so many things and optimally I'd finish
        and publish them yesterday, but everything always takes longer than
        expected. And in your case, it doesn't even depend only on you, since
        you probably have to wait for those patent stuff etc. I certainly want
        to be among the first who order your 6x6 and larger, watching the video
        and mechanism pictures they look very good, and I want to be the first
        who solves a 6x6 blindfolded :-) Cheers! Stefan

        Hey Stefan, I time like I do the magic sort of. I start with the cube in
        my hands and JNetcube set to 0 seconds countdown. I press and hold the
        spacebar and when I'm ready I let go, do the alg, then hit the spacebar
        again. So I start and end with the cube in my hand. It's fairly close to
        just timing the alg itself I think. I have tried to do the alg several
        times in a row and divide, but I tend to prefer timing it individually.
        I don't really know why. Chris --- In

        TRY to read your discussions about speedcubing. &gt; I must tell that it
        was very difficult for me to "catch" you at the beginning. &gt; You see
        i only Knew how to solve the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube and that back to late
        80's. &gt; Now i can solve any size (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6)
        but not in the sense of speedcubing. &gt; As you can imagine when my
        father told me about his invention i begun to search over the internet
        and then i found your really interesting and hardcore discussion group.
        &gt; I must admit that you are all fantastic and i really enjoy trying
        to follow your mind. &gt; &gt; I think that i want to write sooooo much
        but I will try to answer as good as my poor English allows me, some
        subjects that this topic brings. &gt; &gt; Koen writes: &gt; &gt;
        "Looking at Olympic Cubes' site and messages on &gt; Twisty it won't
        take very long anymore for the 6x6x6 &gt; to be available for the
        public.Personally I'm very &gt;excited about trying it out. &gt; &gt;
        Does anybody has an idea about how it's going to be &gt;released? Will
        we be able to order it off the Olympic &gt; Cubes site? &gt; &gt; Also
        will the upcoming tournaments have 6x6x6 events? &gt;What will the &gt;
        &gt; top times be like for the 6x6x6 after say 2 months &gt; of
        release?" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You are right Koen. The OlympiCube No6a
        will be available for the public soon-during the 2006. &gt; You will be
        able to order it through our web-site which by the way will change
        completely during the next 5-6 months. You will also be able to find it
        in many stores, that i cannot tell it yet. &gt; I don't know yet if the
        OlympiCube No6a will be include in yours events but i am sure that in
        the future we will also organize same events-open to any kind of cube
        i.e Rubik's-Mefferts-Eastsheen- Olympicubes and let the athletes decide.
        &gt; As far for the time i cannot tell much. I solve the OlympiCube No6a
        in about 15-20 minutes using beginners techniques. &gt; I am sure that
        all of you laughing with that time. &gt; Also i don't Know which cube
        will be better for speedcubing the No6a or the No6b because we haven't
        constructed the last one YET. &gt; &gt; Game of Death wrote: &gt; &gt;
        I'd imagine there's a further problem which is that &gt; the cube is
        probably less stable and &gt; &gt; more likely to break up/lock up at
        speed. The pieces &gt; will be smaller and even if the &gt; &gt; overlap
        problem is solved an increase in the number &gt; of slices means the
        cube is more likely to jam. &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris wrote: &gt; &gt; There
        is another practical problem. If the cube is &gt; expensive, and &gt;
        &gt; replacement parts are not available, what happens if &gt; by
        speedcubing &gt; &gt; you break it? &gt; &gt; You would need to make
        replacement parts if the &gt; internals are as &gt; &gt; delicate as
        they sound, and if those are expensive &gt; you have a whole &gt; &gt;
        other issue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The OlympiCube No 6a is very stable.
        Much more than all the Known cubes of any size. I know that you are
        crazy and the meaning of stability to you maybe is different than the
        other common people, but if i think the other cubes that i have in hands
        then the surprise directly when you open the box of the OlympiCube No6a
        will be huge. &gt; As far as it depends the replacing parts we will
        discuss it when the time comes and we will sure find a solution. But I
        assure you that the internals are not fragile-delicates and i don't
        think that you will easily break a piece. The pops also don't happen
        while i speedscrambling the cube. &gt; I must also want to tell in
        public that i already talked -off the record-with two Champions "Frank
        Morris" and "Per Kristen Fredlund" &gt; and we will invite them to
        video-test the OlympiCube No5, the OlympiCube No6a and the OlympiCube
        No7 during 2006. &gt; The price of these products will be quite
        reasonable and approachable for such monsters but i can't tell it yet.
        &gt; &gt; The OlympiCube invention is patented in Greece and patented
        pending in 21 countries+European Union, that is the the three quarters
        of the "Known" world. We follow successfully all the necessary legal

        Damn, you saw it yourself... I was already ready to slap that one into
        your face :-) And yes, mine is still more beautiful because the pairs
        aren't built yet at the start. If you just look at it and don't see the
        solution yet, it looks like a very annoying ugly case where you first
        have to pull out an F2L piece out of a wrong slot. But then it magically
        and surprisingly has a really nice solution. That's why yours and Bob's
        case don't fit under the subject of this thread, your algs qualify for
        "nice" but not for "ugly turned" ;-) Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Hi Sachin, Nice report. :-) It was great meeting you. I would love to
        see the cube revival also continue in India. There are a lot of smart
        guys like you, who may one day be world champion. The cube is in good
        hands with you and the other Indian cubers (including John and Bernett).
        You already taught 20 people how to solve. And these people can teach
        others. Please continue your plans of organising a competition. First
        try a small unofficial one. With that experience organise an official
        one and then the big one. WCA will help you in any way we can. Thanks
        for everything. See you again in december. Maybe at the campus of IIT?
        For a small competition? Have fun, Ron &gt; Hello all, &gt; I just now

        Yeah, I don't exactly mind people pushing the prize :-) To Clancy:
        congrats for winning that other game cube! If you'd like some springs I
        use for game cubes then I can send you some. They're expensive in small
        quantities and get much cheaper when you buy lots, that's why I've
        bought 450 of them. If you want to buy a lot, too, then I can tell you
        their data and you can try find a supplier closer to you, I bought mine
        directly from a manufacturer. Slowly but surely I'm running out of them,
        though, since I use them for many puzzles (mostly 3x3 and Megaminx). The
        holes inside the centers are very small, so you need very tiny washers.
        I took Megaminx washers and cut them smaller (they're plastic). I put it
        on a surface, then cut the sides by pressing down a sharp knife. First
        the circle becomes a square, then an octagon, then a 16-gon, which is
        close enough to a circle. I'm also getting closer to getting lots of
        small nylon washers for a very good price, will mention this soon again
        (I found a very good supplier but minimum order is 100 Euros). Hmm, "do
        the tiles or the whole centercap have to be pulled off"? There are no
        separate centercaps, the tiles *are* the (center)caps. I'd suggest in
        order to change the color scheme you first get the 6 center tiles off,
        since they're easiest (tiles on edges and corners might be glued to the
        piece on their bottom, quite silly). Then switch the necessary 8 more
        tiles. Cheers! Stefan --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Uh, one more comment about springs: their ends should be as flat as
        possible, optimally like a ring without a start. You can buy springs
        with ground ends from manufacturers but they don't do the best job, so I
        grind further with a dremel clone (sandpaper also does the job but is
        more work (though less dangerous :-)). Cheers! Stefan

        will take at least as many moves as superflip in both QTM and HTM (and
        maybe more in &gt; &gt; QTM). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's finally done
        testing 22 moves out and no solution so it's at least 24 moves (QTM). My
        &gt; machine is struggling now so I can't test it to 26 moves. Anyway,
        this is at least as far out &gt; as superflip in both QTM and HTM. &gt;

        never had the opportunity to compete but I'm curious if this would break
        any rules at all? Also, would it be possible to use different screws for
        finer adjustments without damaging/stripping the kernel? Thanks, Keith.

        Hello, I've some very bad news : I'm going to have to have a medical
        surgery at my left ring ringer because of speed (hardcore ?) cubing. I
        don't know the word in english but in french it's called a "kist" or
        "quiste sur le tendon" (I don't even know how it's written). But it's
        basically a problem of over-use of a tendon. I don't have to fix it
        right now. Actually it's still too small and it doesn't hurt me so there
        is no need to remove it now. But it will grow and eventually start to
        hurt (and making it harder to use that finger). The biggest problem is
        that after that surgery, I won't be able to use that hand for a while.
        So I think I'll focus on one-handed cubing (right handed) and
        blindfolded cubing and maybe on fewest moves also. I just wanted to let
        you know. But I don't stop cubing, I'll just stop speeding it for a
        while. Gilles.

        Ohho this is really sad to read this. I hope you can reach your original
        speed after the surgery too, or else theres always the one handed thing

        of mental training + I'm not yet sure that 15 seconds is enough to
        preinspect 6 different crosses. I invite anyone to try this :-)
        2005/11/24, cmhardw &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;: &gt; Hey everyone,
        &gt; &gt; I really can't stress how important I think this should be to
        solving. &gt; I know people have preferences for being able to recognize
        one color &gt; to speed things up. &gt; &gt; However, having said that I
        wrote a short page as an addendum to my &gt; extended cross section. I
        feel the material on the page speaks for &gt; itself, so the page is
        simple. &gt; &gt; I just want to point out exactly why I am so strongly
        in favor of this &gt; strategy. Even if you don't use extended cross I
        very strongly ask &gt; you to consider still using opposite color
        solving. &gt; &gt; http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/ec-oc.html &gt; &gt;
        It helps the odds of a good solve so much, that I no longer feel the
        &gt; color recognition gained from using the same color is enough. I
        feel &gt; with practice, the slightly slower recognition could be
        overcome by &gt; the odds of getting a better solve this way. &gt; &gt;
        I will try not to be annoying about this, but please read the page and
        &gt; consider. &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Ah Gilles! Well, if it makes you feel any better, in September 2001 (4
        months after I started cubing), I broke my hand playing football. I had
        it casted, but I still kept speedcubing and I even broke my personal
        best after a few weeks. (See speedcubing.com and look for fastest time
        with hand in a cast). The 44 second time there was my fastest ever, so
        it really boosted my confidence. Speedcuibing is possible even with
        injuries. :) ~ Bob --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Gilles

        &gt; I've some very bad news : &gt; I'm going to have to have a medical
        surgery at my left ring ringer &gt; because of speed (hardcore ?)
        cubing. I don't know the word in english &gt; but in french it's called
        a "kist" or "quiste sur le tendon" (I don't &gt; even know how it's
        written). But it's basically a problem of over-use &gt; of a tendon.
        &gt; &gt; I don't have to fix it right now. &gt; Actually it's still too
        small and it doesn't hurt me so there is no &gt; need to remove it now.
        But it will grow and eventually start to hurt &gt; (and making it harder
        to use that finger). &gt; &gt; The biggest problem is that after that
        surgery, I won't be able to use &gt; that hand for a while. So I think
        I'll focus on one-handed cubing &gt; (right handed) and blindfolded
        cubing and maybe on fewest moves also. &gt; &gt; I just wanted to let
        you know. &gt; But I don't stop cubing, I'll just stop speeding it for a
        while. &gt; &gt; Gilles. &gt;

        &gt; Anyone got a good way to write PHIL around the cube? &gt; &gt;
        Something like this: &gt; &gt; xx- x-x -x- x-- &gt; xx- xxx -x- x-- &gt;
        x-- x-x -x- xxx Can't be done. Let's start off with a definite color
        arrangement (in math terms, "without loss of generality"). Say, a normal
        white-opp- yellow cube with the yellow center on top and the "P" is made
        up of blue squares. Then the "H" has to be red, the "I" green and the
        "L", by virtue of the center being orange, CANNOT be orange. Let's think
        about what the left side of the "P" must be made of. Well, both blue-red
        corners are already used on the "H" side, so the corners of the left
        side of the "P" must both be blue-orange. Now which corner is at the
        bottom of the "P"? It can't be the blue- orange-white corner, because
        then part of the "L" would be orange. So it must be the
        blue-orange-yellow corner. That means the lower- right corner of the "L"
        - and hence the entire "L" - must be yellow. We need three yellow
        corners to make the "L". But guess what: both red-yellow corners are
        already on the opposite "H" side, so there's no way to get the three
        yellows we need. Sorry PHIL, but you ain't gonna happen.

        Thank you you for the support :-) It's not actually that bad (I found
        the englsh word : a cyst) at the moment, but it could turn really bad if
        I continue cubing like this and the big issue for me in 2 months is my
        exam session and I don't want that problem to interfere with my studies.
        (Even though going to the world championship did interfere and made me
        absent for one week :p). So, my experience makes me say this : sub19 in
        9 months is possible, but make sure you take good care of your hands. :p

        &gt; On a similar note, can you write the letters "ILU" (I love you) on
        the cube? Here's a good one for a sort of "reverse" fewest-moves

        BGW RRY BYW I is spelled out in red/white, L in green/blue and U in
        orange/yellow. In the notation, the top/bottom faces are as they appear
        if you have the "RWR" face in front and turn the cube in the direction
        of M and M'. I started with this configuration and was able to solve the

        Here's an even better reason that the yahoo group search function sucks:
        It doesn't work. I searched for "google" and it should've found the
        below message but it didn't. It says "Searched 23056 - 21669 of 23056 so
        far..." and the two results it found don't include the message below,
        which is message 22124. Similarly, a search for "IQ" should find message
        22989 but doesn't. Unfortunately, Google doesn't find them either,
        probably the messages are too new? It's a sad world... Stefan --- In

        By nerd/cuber standards, Tyson is a social Mick Jagger, and really
        shouldn't be on this show. I always wonder how much these "reality"

        follow this on to see how much they distort someone I actually know.

        Introduction:¬†This tutorial assumes that the reader already understands
        the basic concepts of cube notation and algorithms. ¬† The idea of
        solving a Rubik‚Äôs Cube while blindfolded sounds intimidating, but with
        proper methods, the tasks is easily accomplished by anyone.¬†For the
        blindfold solve, the solver memorizes the initial configuration of the
        cube.¬†After the memorization is completed, the solver then proceeds to
        solve the cube without looking at it again. ¬† It is very difficult, and
        probably impossible by all but few, to actually keep track of all 20
        stickers that shift when one turns a single face of the cube.¬†Instead,
        the basic idea of blindfold solving is to solve the cube in very small
        portions, only two or three pieces at a time, thus reducing the need for
        continual updates of your ‚Äúmental picture.‚Äù ¬† The Idea:¬†This method of
        blindfold solving takes place in two main steps.¬†First, the pieces are
        all oriented.¬†Then, the pieces are all permuted.¬†Orientation is done
        first so that when the pieces are permuted into their proper locations,
        they end up facing the right way. ¬† Setting Up The Cube:¬†Unlike regular
        solving, blindfold solving is most easily done with the same center
        faces on top and in front at all times.¬†The colors, as always, are
        arbitrary.¬†World record holder, Leyan Lo, for example always solves with
        the yellow face on top and the blue face in front.¬†Shotaro Makisumi,
        with his Japanese color-scheme cube, solves with the blue face on top
        and the green face in front.¬†I personally solve with the white face on
        top and the green face in front.¬†For this tutorial, I will explain how
        to solve the cube blindfolded while setting the white face on top and
        the green face in front while using a cube with the American
        color-scheme (white opposite of yellow). ¬† For many blindfold solvers,
        numbering the pieces is a good tool that assists in the memorization of
        the cube state.¬†Numbers, like colors, are completely arbitrary.¬†There is
        no difference between permuting corners (3, 5, 7) and permuting corners
        (llama, walrus, duck).¬†Like the color orientation, go with whatever
        works for you. ¬† Orienting the Corners:¬†First, we must orient all the
        pieces.¬†This tutorial explains corner orientation before edge
        orientation.¬†However, it should be noted that the order in which these
        processes are done is irrelevant.¬†As long as the pieces are oriented
        before they are permuted, you will be fine.¬†If it is more comfortable to
        orient the edges first, go ahead and do it that way. ¬† The idea is that
        we want to orient all the corners without affecting their placement or
        any of the edges.¬†In blindfold cubing, there are a variety of algorithms
        that one can use.¬†The more algorithms one knows, the more options a
        solver has.¬†This tutorial will present three methods of orienting
        corners. ¬† Now, we want to orient the corners in such a manner that when
        we apply the permutation algorithms, the end up in the correct
        orientation. ¬† Note that every corner will have a white or a yellow
        sticker.¬†This should be fairly obvious: the cube consists of 8
        corners.¬†Four of the corners are on the top, and since our top color is
        white, four of them will have white stickers.¬†Similarly, four of the
        corners are on the bottom, and since our bottom color is yellow, those
        four corners will have yellow stickers.¬†Since white and yellow or
        opposite colors, no corner can have both a yellow and a white sticker. ¬†
        At the end of the orientation, we want all corners on the top layer to
        have white or yellow stickers facing up.¬†On the bottom layer, we want
        all corners to have white or yellow stickers facing down. ¬† Scramble a
        cube, and notice that some of the corners are already correctly
        oriented‚Äîthey have yellow or white stickers facing directly up or
        down.¬†Many of the corners will require a twist for this to happen.¬†Not
        the same corners require clockwise twists, and other corners require
        counter-clockwise twists. ¬† On a solved cube, perform the algorithm (L‚Äô
        U‚Äô L U‚Äô L‚Äô U2 L)(R U R‚Äô U R U2 R‚Äô).¬†You‚Äôll notice that the algorithm
        twists two corners in the top layer.¬†The bottom right corner is rotated
        clockwise, whereas the top right corner is rotated counter-clockwise. ¬†
        Now, perform the exact inverse of that algorithm: (R U2 R‚Äô U‚Äô R U‚Äô
        R‚Äô)(L‚Äô U2 L U L‚Äô U L).¬†You‚Äôll notice that that algorithm solves the two
        twisted corners in the top layer.¬†More specifically, the bottom right
        corner is twisted counter-clockwise and the top right is twisted
        clockwise. ¬† Experiment with the mirror images of these algorithms.¬†(R U
        R‚Äô U R U2 R‚Äô) (L‚Äô U‚Äô L U‚Äô L‚Äô U2 L)and (L‚Äô U2 L U L‚Äô U L) (R U2 R‚Äô U‚Äô R
        U‚Äô R‚Äô)should do similar things, but to the top left and bottom left
        corners in the top layer. ¬† Now, experiment with the following algorithm
        B2 (L‚Äô U‚Äô L U‚Äô L‚Äô U2 L)(R U R‚Äô U R U2 R‚Äô) B2.¬†You‚Äôll notice that it
        twists the bottom right corner in the top layer clockwise and the top
        left corner in the bottom layer counter-clockwise.¬†B2is what we call a
        ‚Äúsetup move.‚Äù¬†While orienting the cube, we can perform any setup moves
        necessary to position the pieces.¬†First, perform the setup move.¬†Then,
        perform the algorithm.¬†Finally, reverse the setup move.¬†Setup moves are
        used to bring other pieces into locations such that we may act on them
        with the algorithm.¬†Experiment with a variety of setup moves, and
        gradually familiarize yourself with corner orientation. ¬† With the
        provided algorithms and a couple of setup moves, you should be able to
        orient all the corners of the cube.¬†Make sure you familiarize yourself
        with the algorithms and that you understand exactly what they do.¬†Try
        orienting all the corners of a scrambled cube.¬†I will now explain
        another method of orienting corners. ¬† ¬† This method of orienting
        corners requires slightly more intuition, but is very powerful.¬†Try the
        following algorithm on a solved cube: R‚Äô (D R D‚Äô R‚Äô D R) U‚Äô R‚Äô (D‚Äô R D
        R‚Äô D‚Äô R) U.¬†Understanding exactly what this algorithm does is essential
        to its application.¬†First of all, you‚Äôll notice that this algorithm
        twists two corners in the top layer.¬†The bottom right corner is twisted
        clockwise and the bottom left corner is twisted counter-clockwise. ¬† The
        mechanism of this algorithm is very powerful.¬†The first R‚Äôplaces the
        bottom right corner in the top layer into the bottom layer.¬†The next
        part,(D R D‚Äô R‚Äô D R), twists the corner while creating some junk on the
        bottom layer as well.¬†U‚Äô R‚Äômoves the bottom left corner in the top layer
        into the bottom layer and(D‚Äô R D R‚Äô D‚Äô R)twists that corner
        counter-clockwise while reversing the junk on the bottom.¬†Uthen reverses
        theU‚Äômove which moved the corner over in the first place. ¬† The
        fundamental moves in this corner orientation method are (D R D‚Äô R‚Äô D
        R)and(D‚Äô R D R‚Äô D‚Äô R).¬†The first one performs clockwise twists while the
        second one performs counter-clockwise twists.¬†Now, attempt the
        algorithmR‚Äô (D‚Äô R D R‚Äô D‚Äô R) U‚Äô R‚Äô (D R D‚Äô R‚Äô D R) U.¬†You will notice
        that the sections in parentheses are reversed, and so is the effect on
        the corners.¬†The corner that was previously twisted clockwise is now
        twisted counter-clockwise and vice versa.¬†Now attempt the algorithmR‚Äô (D
        R D‚Äô R‚Äô D R) U2 R‚Äô (D‚Äô R D R‚Äô D‚Äô R) U2.¬†You will notice that this
        algorithm is the same as the first, except there is aU2move instead of
        aU‚Äô.¬†The effect is that it twists the diagonal corners instead.¬†Notice
        how theU2moves brings the diagonal corner into position and then
        theR‚Äômove pushes it into the bottom layer. ¬† Now, try the following
        algorithm: R‚Äô (D R D‚Äô R‚Äô D R D‚Äô) U‚Äô R‚Äô (D R D‚Äô R‚Äô D R D‚Äô) U‚Äô R‚Äô (D R D‚Äô
        R‚Äô D R D‚Äô) U2.¬†First, notice that the portions of the algorithm in the
        parentheses are all identical.¬†Next, notice that those portion are the
        same as the fundamental clock-wise twist algorithms, but with an
        addedD‚Äôat the end.¬†Now, notice that the firstR‚Äôpushes a corner into the
        bottom layer.¬†The part in the parenthesis twists the corner
        clockwise.¬†U‚Äô R‚Äômoves the next corner over and we also twist it
        clockwise.¬†We repeat this a third time, and finally,U2puts all the
        corners back in their original locations.¬†The algorithm has twisted
        three corners all clockwise.¬†Attempt the same thing, but substitute(D‚Äô R
        D R‚Äô D‚Äô R D)into the algorithm to perform a counter-clockwise
        three-cycle. ¬† For the advanced blindfold solver, algorithms such as [(R
        U R‚Äô U‚Äô)(R U2 R‚Äô U2)]x2,[(R U2 R‚Äô U2)(R U R‚Äô U‚Äô)]x2, and their inverses
        can be very powerful.¬†Other multi-corner orientation algorithms exist as
        well but they should not be attempted until the solver is fully
        comfortable with the basic set of algorithms. ¬† With these tools and a
        combination of setup moves, you should now be able to orient all of the
        corners of the cube.¬†Attempt to orient all the corners of the cube with
        your eyes open.¬†Then, attempt to memorize the corner orientation of the
        cube and try to orient them blindfolded.¬†Memorizing the corner
        orientation should not be too difficult, but if you need assistance,
        please see the next section. ¬† Now, all the corners should be
        oriented.¬†Again, this means that only white or yellow stickers on the
        corners point directly up or down.¬†Keep in mind that throughout this
        procedure, it is imperative that you are aware of the locations of your
        top and front sides. ¬† Memorizing:¬†Everyone has his own memorization
        techniques.¬†I will present the techniques that I use, but sometimes
        techniques that you develop on your own will ultimately be more
        powerful.¬†Everyone‚Äôs mind works differently. ¬† You‚Äôll notice that I
        included two different methods of orienting the corners.¬†I personally
        use both of them.¬†Leyan and Macky only use the second one.¬†Corner
        orientation is the last thing I memorize.¬†I memorize the steps in
        reverse order of the actual solve.¬†When you have adjacent pairs that
        need to be twisted clockwise and counter-clockwise, there are two
        different shapes.¬†In one of them, the two stickers of interest, in this
        case, yellow or white, will be on the same side.¬†For other cases,
        they‚Äôll be facing away from each other.¬†Sometimes, it is easier for me
        to remember what algorithm to apply rather than which way the piece
        wants to be twisted.¬†Different methods of doing certain things on a
        blindfold solve act as tools.¬†You can solve the cube with very few
        tools, but the more things you understand how to execute, the more ways
        you can do them, and the more choices you have.¬†Sometimes, one choice
        will be more convenient than the other. ¬† Other memorization techniques
        that people do involve memorizing numbers for the corners.¬†I personally
        do not do that, but it should be easy to see how this is done.¬†Simply
        assign an ordering to the corners and then memorize the state of each
        corner. ¬† Memorizing the overall shape of the cube state can be a
        powerful tool.¬†However, always remember that I‚Äôm not right, and that you
        should experiment. ¬† Orienting the Edges:¬†This step is very easy and
        many people consider this to be easier than orienting the corners.¬†Leyan
        Lo performs this step first on the cube whereas Macky and I do this
        second after the corner orientation.¬†Again, it doesn‚Äôt matter which one
        you do first. ¬† The idea is that we are orienting the edges in such a
        manner that when we execute the edge permutation step, all of the edges
        are facing the correct way.¬†Unlike permutation moves, setup moves during
        orientation have no restrictions.¬†I will outline the restriction for
        permutation moves when we get there. ¬† The most difficult thing of the
        edge orientation is recognizing which edges are oriented
        incorrectly.¬†With edge orientations, we consider the top, bottom, front,
        and back colors.¬†On my cube, white is my top, yellow is my bottom, green
        is my front, and blue is my back.¬†Below are several criteria that
        indicate a correct edge.¬†I will explain the logic for this later. ¬† If
        an edge is in the top player, it is correctly oriented if the top or
        bottom color is facing upwards.¬†If the yellow or white sticker is facing
        upwards, then the edge is correct.¬†This applies to the bottom layer as
        well.¬†If the white or yellow sticker is facing directly downwards, the
        edge is oriented correctly. ¬† If the edge is in the top layer, it is
        correctly oriented if the green or blue sticker is facing off to the
        side.¬†If a green or blue sticker is facing directly upwards, then it is
        incorrectly oriented.¬†The same applies for the bottom layer.¬†If the blue
        or green sticker is facing to the side, then it is correctly oriented. ¬†
        If the edge is in the middle layer, it is correctly oriented if the
        white or yellow sticker faces to the side.¬†If the white or yellow
        sticker faces the front or the back, then it is incorrectly oriented. ¬†
        If the edge is in the middle layer, it is correctly oriented if the
        green or blue stickers faces the front or the back.¬†It is incorrectly
        oriented if the green or blue sticker faces to the side. ¬† Why are these
        the rules for orienting edges?¬†When we permute edges, we will be
        limiting ourselves to R2andL2double turn setup moves where as theU,D,F,
        andBfaces are free to move however.¬†For an edge with a white sticker in
        the middle layer, you will notice that if the white sticker faces to the
        side, we can bring it to the top layer and have the white sticker face
        directly up with one of the setup moves.¬†However, if the white sticker
        faces in front, the setup moves that we are allowed to use will never be
        able to move the edge so that the white sticker is on top.¬†The same
        logic is applied to all edges. ¬† Now, we will experiment with the
        algorithms.¬†I use two main algorithms, but there are many edge
        orientation algorithms available, and as always, the more you know, the
        more choices you have.¬†The main algorithm switches two opposite edges in
        the top layer.¬†Perform the move (M‚Äô U M‚Äô U M‚Äô U2)(M U M U M U2)on a
        solved cube.¬†You‚Äôll notice that it switches the near and far edges in
        the top layer.¬†M‚Äô,for me, moves in the same direction asL‚Äô.¬†However, you
        should notice thatM‚ÄôandMare interchangeable in this algorithm.¬†It does
        not matter which way you move the middle slice first as long as you
        switch directions in the middle.¬†Furthermore, theUcan be easily
        substituted with aU‚Äô.¬†It does not matter; the algorithm is symmetric.¬†I
        personally preferU‚Äôbecause I am right handed, and so I allow my right
        hand to perform the sliceMmove and my left index finger to do theU‚Äômove.
        ¬† Now, try doing a setup move with this algorithm.¬†Try the setup move L‚Äô
        B‚Äô, perform the algorithm, and then conclude withB L.¬†Notice
        thatL‚ÄôB‚Äômoves the top left edge into the position formerly occupied by
        the top back edge.¬†BLsimply reverses the setup move.¬†Try a variety of
        setup moves such asB2or even a cube rotation.¬†As long as you reverse
        your setup move, everything will be as you expect it. ¬† Now, try a
        four-edge flipper.¬†The following algorithm will flip all four edges in
        the top layer.¬†(M‚Äô U M‚Äô U M‚Äô U M‚Äô U)(M U M U M U M U).¬†Notice how it
        flips all four edges.¬†Again, realize thatM‚ÄôandMare interchangeable as
        with before.¬†Furthermore, realize that I am right handed and that I
        preferU‚ÄôoverU.¬†As with before, experiment with some setup moves and
        familiarize yourself with this algorithm. ¬† There are other algorithms
        available.¬†Certain algorithms will flip six, eight, or even all twelve
        edges.¬†However, I feel that these two algorithms are sufficient as
        almost all possible cube states can be reduced to just several
        applications of the above algorithms. ¬†Experiment with only the first
        half of the four-edge flipper and see what it does.¬†Finally, experiment
        with this one: M2 U M U2 M‚Äô U M‚Äô U M‚Äô U2 M U M‚Äô.¬†A list of algorithms
        will be provided at the end. ¬† Memorizing:¬†Again, if you prefer, one can
        memorize the edge orientation state with numbers by simply ordering the
        numbers and then by remembering a string a binary digits.¬†I personally
        prefer to just visualize where the incorrectly oriented edges
        are.¬†Frequently, instead of memorizing which edges need to be corrected,
        I will memorize the algorithms necessary to correct them.¬†This is very
        fast as I can execute the algorithm without even thinking about the
        edges that I‚Äôm affecting. ¬† Here‚Äôs an example.¬†Let‚Äôs say I see three
        edges that need to be corrected on the top and one edge that needs to be
        corrected on the bottom.¬†Instead of memorizing which edges are
        incorrectly flipped, I will memorize the setup move D R2or something
        similar.¬†Then, I will perform the setup move, apply the four-edge
        flipping algorithm, and then reverse the algorithm.¬†There are many ways
        to memorize the cube, so by all means just do whatever works for you. ¬†
        Corner Permutation:¬†All your edges should be oriented now.¬†Now, we will
        put all the corners in their correct place.¬†For this step, I have
        numbered my corners to assist in the recognition of the cycles.¬†There is
        no standard numbering convention.¬†Macky, Leyan, and I all do it
        differently. ¬† Start with your first corner location.¬†For me, this is
        the top, front, right corner. ¬†For Leyan, it‚Äôs the top, front, left, and
        he holds the world record, so maybe you should listen to him.¬†If your
        first corner is correct, more specifically that the piece that belongs
        there actually is there, move on to your second corner.¬†Otherwise, you
        will have a different corner in that location.¬†Look at the corner in
        that location, and go to the position where that corner belongs.¬†Since
        that corner is in your first location, it cannot be where it
        belongs.¬†Therefore, there will be another piece in that location.¬†Look
        at where that corner wants to go, and go to the next corner position on
        the cube.¬†Continue this until you find the corner that belongs in the
        first position, then stop.¬†That‚Äôs a cycle.¬†If you have accounted for all
        eight corners, then you are done.¬†Otherwise, you will need to go to the
        next corner position that has not been visited by the previous cycle,
        and continue again. ¬† Let‚Äôs make slot A our ‚Äúfirst‚Äù corner
        position.¬†Suppose corner B is in slot A.¬†We then take a look at corner
        B‚Äôs desired position.¬†In corner B‚Äôs position, we have corner C.¬†We look
        at C‚Äôs position, and we see D.¬†We look at D‚Äôs position, and then we see
        E.¬†When we look at E‚Äôs position, we see corner A, and so we stop, and we
        remember the cycle (ABCDE).¬†It not necessary to memorize the cycles with
        letters or numbers.¬†As long as you know where the cycle leads, it‚Äôs
        fine. ¬† Now, we continue on our memorization, and we go to the corner
        position F.¬†We see that in corner position F is corner position G, and
        we follow G to H, which leads us back to F, and so we have the cycle
        (FGH). ¬† Occasionally, you will have cycles with an even number of
        elements such as (ABCD) or (EF) or (ABCDEFGH).¬†If we have an even number
        of even cycles such as (AB), (CD), (EF), (GH), then there is no parity
        error.¬†Otherwise, there is a parity error and I will discuss how to
        correct that later.¬†First, we will deal with cycles of odd length. ¬†
        When we permute corners, we generally swap them three at a time.¬†I will
        illustrate other algorithms later as well.¬†Experiment with the
        algorithms (L F‚Äô L B2 L‚Äô F L B2 L2) and(R‚Äô F R‚Äô B2 R F‚Äô R‚Äô B2
        R2).¬†Notice that these two algorithms are mirror images and they both
        cycle three corners. ¬† Notice that (R‚Äô F R‚Äô B2 R F‚Äô R‚Äô B2 R2)cycles the
        bottom right corner to the top left position, the top left corner to the
        top right position, and the top right corner to the bottom right
        position all in the top layer.¬†Even more importantly, notice that the
        bottom left corner in the top layer is untouched. ¬† Before we proceed,
        it is important to understand the restrictions of the setup moves.¬†While
        permuting corners, only the UandDfaces may make single turns.¬†TheF,L,B,
        andRfaces are restricted to double turns. Consider now that we want to
        solve the cycle (ABCDE).¬†First, we want to deal with the corners A, B,
        and C.¬†The most common situation is that you have one corner in one
        layer, and two adjacent corners in the other layer.¬†This is nice,
        because we can put all three corners in the top layer easily.¬†Generally,
        this can be accomplished by a double turn of one of the side
        faces.¬†Sometimes, a D2is necessary to move the bottom corners away from
        the top corners.¬†Notice,DandD‚Äôare acceptable setup moves, but sinceD2can
        solve every case, you might as well use it.¬†It makes it easier to
        remember and you won‚Äôt make a mistake going the wrong direction. ¬† Now
        that all three corners are in the top layer, determine whether or not
        they wish to be cycled clockwise or counter-clockwise and choose the
        appropriate algorithm.¬†If they want to cycle clockwise, you need to do
        the ‚Äúright handed‚Äù algorithm. ¬† Set up the three corners correctly.¬†This
        is very easy if you remember the ‚Äúblank‚Äù corner.¬†One of the corners in
        the top layer does not need to be cycled.¬†If we are doing the ‚Äúright
        handed‚Äù algorithm, put this blank corner in the bottom left corner with
        a U,U‚Äô, orU2move.¬†Then, do your algorithm, and reverse your setup
        moves.¬†If it is a counter-clockwise cycle, then your blank corner goes
        in the bottom right corner. ¬† After you have cycled A, B, and C, you may
        eliminate B, and C from your string.¬†Now, (ABCDE) becomes (ADE).¬†Simple
        cycle (ADE) and you are done with that entire cycle.¬†Do this until all
        corners are solved. ¬† Sometimes, you will have one corner in one layer,
        and you will have two corners situated diagonally from each other in the
        other layer.¬†This makes the setup move more difficult.¬†However, in my
        misunderstandings with Leyan, I have come up with a good way of solving
        these situations.¬†Consider the cycle (ABC).¬†A and B are in the to
        player.¬†A is in the bottom right corner and B is in the top left
        corner.¬†C is in the bottom layer directly below A. ¬† Now, try to
        algorithm (R‚Äô F R F‚Äô)x3where x3 means you repeat those moves three
        times.¬†You will notice that corners A and C are swapped, B remains
        untouched, but the other two diagonal corners in the top layer are
        swapped. ¬† The idea here is that were‚Äô going to swap two corners, then
        we‚Äôll swap the other two.¬†In the process, the corners getting swapped
        diagonally will be swapped twice, and they will return to their original
        positions. ¬† Remember, we want to swap A to B, B to C, and C to A.¬†Since
        C wants to go to A, we apply the algorithm right away.¬†Now, we do
        U2,which positions B in the location where A used to be, we do the
        algorithm again, and we‚Äôve swapped (ABC).¬†Remember to doU2again to undo
        your setup move.¬†Because the corners in question are diagonal from each
        other, the setup moves in the middle of this algorithm are always double
        turns. ¬† Now, consider the same situation, but consider the cycle
        (BAC).¬†Here, C wants to go to position B.¬†Therefore, we must perform
        U2first in order to place C in B‚Äôs position, and then we doU2and swap
        the others.¬†Notice that we do not need aU2to reverse the setup move at
        the end.¬†In this situation, we do not swap A and C first.¬†A does want to
        go to C, but C is the lone corner, and if we swap A with C first, we
        will destroy it when we include the swap with B.¬† ¬† The same method can
        be applied if two corners are diagonally in the bottom, and the other
        corner is in the top layer.¬†Think about which position the top layer
        corner wants to go, and do that swap first.¬†Then do D2, and do the next
        swap, and then reverse your setup moves. ¬† In this process, it is
        sometimes necessary to position the corners with UorDmoves.¬†Just make
        sure you reverse them when you‚Äôre done.¬†There are other similar
        algorithms such as(R B‚Äô R‚Äô B)x3.¬†They‚Äôre all basically the same. ¬† Now,
        we will discuss cycles of even length.¬†How do we cycle (AB) and
        (CD)?¬†Experiment with the algorithm (R‚Äô F R‚Äô B2 R F‚Äô R‚Äô B2 R2) U (L F‚Äô L
        B2 L‚Äô F L B2 L2) U‚Äô.¬†Notice you do not have to memorize anything
        new.¬†Notice that this algorithm swaps the bottom left corner with the
        bottom right corner and the top left corner with the top right corner. ¬†
        However, sometimes it may be difficult to perform the necessary setup
        moves in order to place the corners in this configuration.¬†Instead, we
        can swap the corners in two steps using a T-permutation.¬†This is very
        similar to Stefan Pochmann‚Äôs blindfold method. ¬† Let‚Äôs say we want to
        cycle (AB) and (CD).¬†First, we will cycle A and B.¬†Put A and B into the
        top right and bottom right corners in the to player.¬†However, when doing
        these setup moves, we do not want to disturb the left and right edges in
        the top layer.¬†This can be accomplished by performing a UorDmove
        combined with aF2orB2.¬†Now, perform the algorithm(R U R‚Äô U‚Äô)(R‚Äô F)(R2
        U‚Äô)(R‚Äô U‚Äô R U F‚Äô).¬†Now, you have successfully swapped corners A and B,
        but you have also swapped the left and right edges in the top
        layer.¬†Reverse your setup moves, and now position C and D in the top
        right and bottom right corner positions, and do the algorithm again.¬†You
        will swap C and D, and you will reverse the damage done to the edges. ¬†
        Note, that a U2setup move will not damage your edges.¬†Swapping the left
        and right edges is the same as the right and left.¬†Sometimes, it is more
        convenient to swap the top right and bottom right corners, and then swap
        the top left and top right corners.¬†This is also fine, but always keep
        in mind which edges are being swapped and be sure not to disturb them
        with your setup moves.¬†If you do this, sometimes all four edges will be
        swapped.¬†If this is the case, simply performM2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2and
        correct all four corners. ¬† Memorizing:¬†Being the numerically minded
        person that I am, I generally rely on the use of numbers to aid in my
        memorization.¬†It should be clear that if your corners are given numbers
        1 to 8, you can generate a numerical cycle such as (1 5 7 2 4 3 8) which
        will give you all the information you need to complete the permutation
        of the corners.¬†Numbers are especially useful if the permutation cycle
        resembles something mathematical such as (1 2 3 5 8)(4 6 7) where the
        first cycle consists of numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. ¬† However,
        numbers have generally become obsolete with the general blindfolding
        population and many people rely on the shapes and the patters of the
        permutation that the path of the corners trace out.¬†Everyone has a
        different way of memorizing things and so pretty much as long as you can
        retain the information, it doesn‚Äôt matter how you do it. ¬† Edge
        Permutation:¬†Permuting the edges is basically the exact same thing as
        permuting the corners.¬†Instead, as stated above, the limitations of the
        setup moves are more liberal.¬†We are allowed to make single turns on
        theF,B,U, andDfaces.¬†All setup moves on the left and right sides must
        beL2andR2. ¬† The algorithms you will use will be the basic three-edge
        cycles.¬†These should be quite familiar to you from speed cubing. ¬† Edge
        Parity Correction:¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In this tutorial, I have explained how to
        correct corner parity in the event you wish to switch corner A with B
        and corner C with D.¬†Edge parity can be done very similarly. ¬† If you
        can situate your edges using the appropriate setup moves into an
        H-permutation (M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2)or Z-permutation(R B‚Äô R‚Äô B F R‚Äô F B‚Äô
        R‚Äô B R F2 U), then those algorithms will correct the parity for you.¬† ¬†
        Note:¬†¬†The Z-permutation can be performed on the F,B,U, andDfaces and it
        will still maintain the orientation of the edges.¬†The H-permutation can
        in fact be performed on any face.¬†Try the H-permutation on theLface and
        notice is still preserves the orientation of your edges. ¬† Similarly,
        the H-permutation + U2 or (M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2 U2)which swaps two sets of
        diagonal corners can also be performed on any face without interfering
        with the corner orientation. ¬† In general, corners that are being
        swapped diagonally may be swapped on any face.¬†Otherwise, they are
        confined to UandD.¬†Edges that are being swapped across and not adjacent
        may also be swapped on any face.¬†Otherwise, they are confined toF,B,U,
        andD. ¬† Sometimes, it can be difficult to perform setup moves that
        arrange all four edges on the same face.¬†In such cases, the parity can
        be broken down into two steps.¬†Suppose you want to swap edges A and B
        and edges C and D.¬†Using the setup moves with the appropriate
        limitations (double turns for the left and right sides), place edge A at
        the FU position and edge B and the BU position.¬†Then, perform the
        H-permutation.¬†Reverse your setup moves and then put edge C in the FU
        position and edge D in the BU position and perform another
        H-permutation.¬†Again, reverse your setup moves.¬†This sequence first
        swaps edges A and B but also swaps edges at the FL and FR positions.¬†The
        second H-permutation swaps edges C and D while correcting the FL and FR
        edges. ¬† Corner and Edge Parity Correction: Corner and edge parity
        occurs when one wishes to swap corners A with B and edge C with D.¬†If it
        is possible to bring A, B, C, and D all to the same face, then the
        appropriate PLL may be performed.¬†It is important that if corners are
        being swapped non-diagonally and edges are being swapped adjacently, you
        probably have to perform the PLL on the U-face. ¬† However, sometimes
        this can be difficult to setup, especially if you are blindfolded.¬†It is
        possible to break down the corner/edge parity correction into two steps.
        ¬† First, let us correct the corners.¬†We will be utilizing the
        T-permutation, which will swap the FRU corner with the BRU
        corner.¬†Position corner A and corner B into FRU and BRU.¬†In doing so, it
        is important not to disturb Oh I'm sorry, you wanted to learn how to

        assumes that the reader already understands &gt; the basic concepts of
        cube notation and algorithms. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of solving a
        Rubik's Cube while blindfolded sounds &gt; intimidating, but with proper
        methods, the tasks is easily accomplished &gt; by anyone.For the
        blindfold solve, the solver memorizes the initial &gt; configuration of
        the cube.After the memorization is completed, the &gt; solver then
        proceeds to solve the cube without looking at it again. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; It is very difficult, and probably impossible by all but few, to
        &gt; actually keep track of all 20 stickers that shift when one turns a
        &gt; single face of the cube.Instead, the basic idea of blindfold
        solving &gt; is to solve the cube in very small portions, only two or
        three pieces &gt; at a time, thus reducing the need for continual
        updates of your "mental &gt; picture." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Idea:This
        method of blindfold solving takes place in two main &gt; steps.First,
        the pieces are all oriented.Then, the pieces are all &gt;
        permuted.Orientation is done first so that when the pieces are &gt;
        permuted into their proper locations, they end up facing the right way.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Setting Up The Cube:Unlike regular solving,
        blindfold solving is most &gt; easily done with the same center faces on
        top and in front at all &gt; times.The colors, as always, are
        arbitrary.World record holder, Leyan &gt; Lo, for example always solves
        with the yellow face on top and the blue &gt; face in front.Shotaro
        Makisumi, with his Japanese color-scheme cube, &gt; solves with the blue
        face on top and the green face in front.I &gt; personally solve with the
        white face on top and the green face in &gt; front.For this tutorial, I
        will explain how to solve the cube &gt; blindfolded while setting the
        white face on top and the green face in &gt; front while using a cube
        with the American color-scheme (white opposite &gt; of yellow). &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; For many blindfold solvers, numbering the pieces is a
        good tool that &gt; assists in the memorization of the cube
        state.Numbers, like colors, &gt; are completely arbitrary.There is no
        difference between permuting &gt; corners (3, 5, 7) and permuting
        corners (llama, walrus, duck).Like the &gt; color orientation, go with
        whatever works for you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Orienting the Corners:First,
        we must orient all the pieces.This &gt; tutorial explains corner
        orientation before edge orientation.However, &gt; it should be noted
        that the order in which these processes are done is &gt; irrelevant.As
        long as the pieces are oriented before they are &gt; permuted, you will
        be fine.If it is more comfortable to orient the &gt; edges first, go
        ahead and do it that way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea is that we want
        to orient all the corners without affecting &gt; their placement or any
        of the edges.In blindfold cubing, there are a &gt; variety of algorithms
        that one can use.The more algorithms one knows, &gt; the more options a
        solver has.This tutorial will present three methods &gt; of orienting
        corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, we want to orient the corners in such
        a manner that when we apply &gt; the permutation algorithms, the end up
        in the correct orientation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Note that every corner
        will have a white or a yellow sticker.This &gt; should be fairly
        obvious: the cube consists of 8 corners.Four of the &gt; corners are on
        the top, and since our top color is white, four of them &gt; will have
        white stickers.Similarly, four of the corners are on the &gt; bottom,
        and since our bottom color is yellow, those four corners will &gt; have
        yellow stickers.Since white and yellow or opposite colors, no &gt;
        corner can have both a yellow and a white sticker. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        At the end of the orientation, we want all corners on the top layer to
        &gt; have white or yellow stickers facing up.On the bottom layer, we
        want &gt; all corners to have white or yellow stickers facing down. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Scramble a cube, and notice that some of the corners are
        already &gt; correctly oriented‚Äîthey have yellow or white stickers
        facing directly &gt; up or down.Many of the corners will require a twist
        for this to &gt; happen.Not the same corners require clockwise twists,
        and other &gt; corners require counter-clockwise twists. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; On a solved cube, perform the algorithm (L' U' L U' L' U2 L)(R U R'
        U R &gt; U2 R').You'll notice that the algorithm twists two corners in
        the top &gt; layer.The bottom right corner is rotated clockwise, whereas
        the top &gt; right corner is rotated counter-clockwise. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Now, perform the exact inverse of that algorithm: (R U2 R' U' R U'
        &gt; R')(L' U2 L U L' U L).You'll notice that that algorithm solves the
        two &gt; twisted corners in the top layer.More specifically, the bottom
        right &gt; corner is twisted counter-clockwise and the top right is
        twisted &gt; clockwise. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Experiment with the mirror
        images of these algorithms.(R U R' U R U2 &gt; R') (L' U' L U' L' U2
        L)and (L' U2 L U L' U L) (R U2 R' U' R U' &gt; R')should do similar
        things, but to the top left and bottom left &gt; corners in the top
        layer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, experiment with the following algorithm
        B2 (L' U' L U' L' U2 L)(R &gt; U R' U R U2 R') B2.You'll notice that it
        twists the bottom right &gt; corner in the top layer clockwise and the
        top left corner in the bottom &gt; layer counter-clockwise.B2is what we
        call a "setup move."While &gt; orienting the cube, we can perform any
        setup moves necessary to &gt; position the pieces.First, perform the
        setup move.Then, perform the &gt; algorithm.Finally, reverse the setup
        move.Setup moves are used to &gt; bring other pieces into locations such
        that we may act on them with the &gt; algorithm.Experiment with a
        variety of setup moves, and gradually &gt; familiarize yourself with
        corner orientation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With the provided algorithms and
        a couple of setup moves, you should be &gt; able to orient all the
        corners of the cube.Make sure you familiarize &gt; yourself with the
        algorithms and that you understand exactly what they &gt; do.Try
        orienting all the corners of a scrambled cube.I will now &gt; explain
        another method of orienting corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
        method of orienting corners requires slightly more intuition, but &gt;
        is very powerful.Try the following algorithm on a solved cube: R' (D R
        &gt; D' R' D R) U' R' (D' R D R' D' R) U.Understanding exactly what this
        &gt; algorithm does is essential to its application.First of all, you'll
        &gt; notice that this algorithm twists two corners in the top layer.The
        &gt; bottom right corner is twisted clockwise and the bottom left corner
        is &gt; twisted counter-clockwise. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mechanism of
        this algorithm is very powerful.The first R'places &gt; the bottom right
        corner in the top layer into the bottom layer.The &gt; next part,(D R D'
        R' D R), twists the corner while creating some junk &gt; on the bottom
        layer as well.U' R'moves the bottom left corner in the &gt; top layer
        into the bottom layer and(D' R D R' D' R)twists that corner &gt;
        counter-clockwise while reversing the junk on the bottom.Uthen &gt;
        reverses theU'move which moved the corner over in the first place. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; The fundamental moves in this corner orientation method
        are (D R D' R' &gt; D R)and(D' R D R' D' R).The first one performs
        clockwise twists while &gt; the second one performs counter-clockwise
        twists.Now, attempt the &gt; algorithmR' (D' R D R' D' R) U' R' (D R D'
        R' D R) U.You will notice &gt; that the sections in parentheses are
        reversed, and so is the effect on &gt; the corners.The corner that was
        previously twisted clockwise is now &gt; twisted counter-clockwise and
        vice versa.Now attempt the algorithmR' &gt; (D R D' R' D R) U2 R' (D' R
        D R' D' R) U2.You will notice that this &gt; algorithm is the same as
        the first, except there is aU2move instead of &gt; aU'.The effect is
        that it twists the diagonal corners instead.Notice &gt; how theU2moves
        brings the diagonal corner into position and then &gt; theR'move pushes
        it into the bottom layer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, try the following
        algorithm: R' (D R D' R' D R D') U' R' (D R D' &gt; R' D R D') U' R' (D
        R D' R' D R D') U2.First, notice that the portions &gt; of the algorithm
        in the parentheses are all identical.Next, notice &gt; that those
        portion are the same as the fundamental clock-wise twist &gt;
        algorithms, but with an addedD'at the end.Now, notice that the &gt;
        firstR'pushes a corner into the bottom layer.The part in the &gt;
        parenthesis twists the corner clockwise.U' R'moves the next corner &gt;
        over and we also twist it clockwise.We repeat this a third time, and
        &gt; finally,U2puts all the corners back in their original locations.The
        &gt; algorithm has twisted three corners all clockwise.Attempt the same
        &gt; thing, but substitute(D' R D R' D' R D)into the algorithm to
        perform a &gt; counter-clockwise three-cycle. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For
        the advanced blindfold solver, algorithms such as [(R U R' U')(R U2 &gt;
        R' U2)]x2,[(R U2 R' U2)(R U R' U')]x2, and their inverses can be very
        &gt; powerful.Other multi-corner orientation algorithms exist as well
        but &gt; they should not be attempted until the solver is fully
        comfortable with &gt; the basic set of algorithms. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        With these tools and a combination of setup moves, you should now be
        &gt; able to orient all of the corners of the cube.Attempt to orient all
        &gt; the corners of the cube with your eyes open.Then, attempt to
        memorize &gt; the corner orientation of the cube and try to orient them
        &gt; blindfolded.Memorizing the corner orientation should not be too
        &gt; difficult, but if you need assistance, please see the next section.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, all the corners should be oriented.Again, this
        means that only &gt; white or yellow stickers on the corners point
        directly up or down.Keep &gt; in mind that throughout this procedure, it
        is imperative that you are &gt; aware of the locations of your top and
        front sides. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Memorizing:Everyone has his own
        memorization techniques.I will &gt; present the techniques that I use,
        but sometimes techniques that you &gt; develop on your own will
        ultimately be more powerful.Everyone's mind &gt; works differently. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; You'll notice that I included two different methods of
        orienting the &gt; corners.I personally use both of them.Leyan and Macky
        only use the &gt; second one.Corner orientation is the last thing I
        memorize.I memorize &gt; the steps in reverse order of the actual
        solve.When you have adjacent &gt; pairs that need to be twisted
        clockwise and counter-clockwise, there &gt; are two different shapes.In
        one of them, the two stickers of interest, &gt; in this case, yellow or
        white, will be on the same side.For other &gt; cases, they'll be facing
        away from each other.Sometimes, it is easier &gt; for me to remember
        what algorithm to apply rather than which way the &gt; piece wants to be
        twisted.Different methods of doing certain things on &gt; a blindfold
        solve act as tools.You can solve the cube with very few &gt; tools, but
        the more things you understand how to execute, the more ways &gt; you
        can do them, and the more choices you have.Sometimes, one choice &gt;
        will be more convenient than the other. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other
        memorization techniques that people do involve memorizing numbers &gt;
        for the corners.I personally do not do that, but it should be easy to
        &gt; see how this is done.Simply assign an ordering to the corners and
        then &gt; memorize the state of each corner. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Memorizing the overall shape of the cube state can be a powerful &gt;
        tool.However, always remember that I'm not right, and that you should
        &gt; experiment. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Orienting the Edges:This step is
        very easy and many people consider &gt; this to be easier than orienting
        the corners.Leyan Lo performs this &gt; step first on the cube whereas
        Macky and I do this second after the &gt; corner orientation.Again, it
        doesn't matter which one you do first. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea is
        that we are orienting the edges in such a manner that when &gt; we
        execute the edge permutation step, all of the edges are facing the &gt;
        correct way.Unlike permutation moves, setup moves during orientation
        &gt; have no restrictions.I will outline the restriction for permutation
        &gt; moves when we get there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The most difficult
        thing of the edge orientation is recognizing which &gt; edges are
        oriented incorrectly.With edge orientations, we consider the &gt; top,
        bottom, front, and back colors.On my cube, white is my top, &gt; yellow
        is my bottom, green is my front, and blue is my back.Below are &gt;
        several criteria that indicate a correct edge.I will explain the logic
        &gt; for this later. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If an edge is in the top
        player, it is correctly oriented if the top or &gt; bottom color is
        facing upwards.If the yellow or white sticker is &gt; facing upwards,
        then the edge is correct.This applies to the bottom &gt; layer as
        well.If the white or yellow sticker is facing directly &gt; downwards,
        the edge is oriented correctly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If the edge is in
        the top layer, it is correctly oriented if the green &gt; or blue
        sticker is facing off to the side.If a green or blue sticker &gt; is
        facing directly upwards, then it is incorrectly oriented.The same &gt;
        applies for the bottom layer.If the blue or green sticker is facing to
        &gt; the side, then it is correctly oriented. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If the
        edge is in the middle layer, it is correctly oriented if the &gt; white
        or yellow sticker faces to the side.If the white or yellow &gt; sticker
        faces the front or the back, then it is incorrectly oriented. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; If the edge is in the middle layer, it is correctly oriented
        if the &gt; green or blue stickers faces the front or the back.It is
        incorrectly &gt; oriented if the green or blue sticker faces to the
        side. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why are these the rules for orienting
        edges?When we permute edges, we &gt; will be limiting ourselves to
        R2andL2double turn setup moves where as &gt; theU,D,F, andBfaces are
        free to move however.For an edge with a white &gt; sticker in the middle
        layer, you will notice that if the white sticker &gt; faces to the side,
        we can bring it to the top layer and have the white &gt; sticker face
        directly up with one of the setup moves.However, if the &gt; white
        sticker faces in front, the setup moves that we are allowed to &gt; use
        will never be able to move the edge so that the white sticker is on &gt;
        top.The same logic is applied to all edges. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, we
        will experiment with the algorithms.I use two main algorithms, &gt; but
        there are many edge orientation algorithms available, and as &gt;
        always, the more you know, the more choices you have.The main &gt;
        algorithm switches two opposite edges in the top layer.Perform the &gt;
        move (M' U M' U M' U2)(M U M U M U2)on a solved cube.You'll notice &gt;
        that it switches the near and far edges in the top layer.M',for me, &gt;
        moves in the same direction asL'.However, you should notice &gt;
        thatM'andMare interchangeable in this algorithm.It does not matter &gt;
        which way you move the middle slice first as long as you switch &gt;
        directions in the middle.Furthermore, theUcan be easily substituted &gt;
        with aU'.It does not matter; the algorithm is symmetric.I personally
        &gt; preferU'because I am right handed, and so I allow my right hand to
        &gt; perform the sliceMmove and my left index finger to do theU'move.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, try doing a setup move with this algorithm.Try
        the setup move L' &gt; B', perform the algorithm, and then conclude
        withB L.Notice &gt; thatL'B'moves the top left edge into the position
        formerly occupied by &gt; the top back edge.BLsimply reverses the setup
        move.Try a variety of &gt; setup moves such asB2or even a cube
        rotation.As long as you reverse &gt; your setup move, everything will be
        as you expect it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, try a four-edge flipper.The
        following algorithm will flip all &gt; four edges in the top layer.(M' U
        M' U M' U M' U)(M U M U M U M &gt; U).Notice how it flips all four
        edges.Again, realize thatM'andMare &gt; interchangeable as with
        before.Furthermore, realize that I am right &gt; handed and that I
        preferU'overU.As with before, experiment with some &gt; setup moves and
        familiarize yourself with this algorithm. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are
        other algorithms available.Certain algorithms will flip six, &gt; eight,
        or even all twelve edges.However, I feel that these two &gt; algorithms
        are sufficient as almost all possible cube states can be &gt; reduced to
        just several applications of the above algorithms. &gt; Experiment with
        only the first half of the four-edge flipper and see &gt; what it
        does.Finally, experiment with this one: M2 U M U2 M' U M' U M' &gt; U2 M
        U M'.A list of algorithms will be provided at the end. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Memorizing:Again, if you prefer, one can memorize the edge
        orientation &gt; state with numbers by simply ordering the numbers and
        then by &gt; remembering a string a binary digits.I personally prefer to
        just &gt; visualize where the incorrectly oriented edges are.Frequently,
        instead &gt; of memorizing which edges need to be corrected, I will
        memorize the &gt; algorithms necessary to correct them.This is very fast
        as I can &gt; execute the algorithm without even thinking about the
        edges that I'm &gt; affecting. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's an
        example.Let's say I see three edges that need to be &gt; corrected on
        the top and one edge that needs to be corrected on the &gt;
        bottom.Instead of memorizing which edges are incorrectly flipped, I &gt;
        will memorize the setup move D R2or something similar.Then, I will &gt;
        perform the setup move, apply the four-edge flipping algorithm, and &gt;
        then reverse the algorithm.There are many ways to memorize the cube,
        &gt; so by all means just do whatever works for you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Corner Permutation:All your edges should be oriented now.Now, we will
        &gt; put all the corners in their correct place.For this step, I have
        &gt; numbered my corners to assist in the recognition of the
        cycles.There &gt; is no standard numbering convention.Macky, Leyan, and
        I all do it &gt; differently. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Start with your first
        corner location.For me, this is the top, front, &gt; right corner. For
        Leyan, it's the top, front, left, and he holds the &gt; world record, so
        maybe you should listen to him.If your first corner &gt; is correct,
        more specifically that the piece that belongs there &gt; actually is
        there, move on to your second corner.Otherwise, you will &gt; have a
        different corner in that location.Look at the corner in that &gt;
        location, and go to the position where that corner belongs.Since that
        &gt; corner is in your first location, it cannot be where it &gt;
        belongs.Therefore, there will be another piece in that location.Look
        &gt; at where that corner wants to go, and go to the next corner
        position on &gt; the cube.Continue this until you find the corner that
        belongs in the &gt; first position, then stop.That's a cycle.If you have
        accounted for &gt; all eight corners, then you are done.Otherwise, you
        will need to go to &gt; the next corner position that has not been
        visited by the previous &gt; cycle, and continue again. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Let's make slot A our "first" corner position.Suppose corner B is
        in &gt; slot A.We then take a look at corner B's desired position.In
        corner &gt; B's position, we have corner C.We look at C's position, and
        we see &gt; D.We look at D's position, and then we see E.When we look at
        E's &gt; position, we see corner A, and so we stop, and we remember the
        cycle &gt; (ABCDE).It not necessary to memorize the cycles with letters
        or &gt; numbers.As long as you know where the cycle leads, it's fine.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, we continue on our memorization, and we go to
        the corner position &gt; F.We see that in corner position F is corner
        position G, and we follow &gt; G to H, which leads us back to F, and so
        we have the cycle (FGH). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Occasionally, you will have
        cycles with an even number of elements such &gt; as (ABCD) or (EF) or
        (ABCDEFGH).If we have an even number of even &gt; cycles such as (AB),
        (CD), (EF), (GH), then there is no parity &gt; error.Otherwise, there is
        a parity error and I will discuss how to &gt; correct that later.First,
        we will deal with cycles of odd length. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When we
        permute corners, we generally swap them three at a time.I will &gt;
        illustrate other algorithms later as well.Experiment with the &gt;
        algorithms (L F' L B2 L' F L B2 L2) and(R' F R' B2 R F' R' B2 &gt;
        R2).Notice that these two algorithms are mirror images and they both
        &gt; cycle three corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notice that (R' F R' B2 R
        F' R' B2 R2)cycles the bottom right corner to &gt; the top left
        position, the top left corner to the top right position, &gt; and the
        top right corner to the bottom right position all in the top &gt;
        layer.Even more importantly, notice that the bottom left corner in the
        &gt; top layer is untouched. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Before we proceed, it
        is important to understand the restrictions of &gt; the setup
        moves.While permuting corners, only the UandDfaces may make &gt; single
        turns.TheF,L,B, andRfaces are restricted to double turns. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Consider now that we want to solve the cycle (ABCDE).First, we want to
        &gt; deal with the corners A, B, and C.The most common situation is that
        &gt; you have one corner in one layer, and two adjacent corners in the
        other &gt; layer.This is nice, because we can put all three corners in
        the top &gt; layer easily.Generally, this can be accomplished by a
        double turn of &gt; one of the side faces.Sometimes, a D2is necessary to
        move the bottom &gt; corners away from the top corners.Notice,DandD'are
        acceptable setup &gt; moves, but sinceD2can solve every case, you might
        as well use it.It &gt; makes it easier to remember and you won't make a
        mistake going the &gt; wrong direction. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now that all
        three corners are in the top layer, determine whether or &gt; not they
        wish to be cycled clockwise or counter-clockwise and choose &gt; the
        appropriate algorithm.If they want to cycle clockwise, you need to &gt;
        do the "right handed" algorithm. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Set up the three
        corners correctly.This is very easy if you remember &gt; the "blank"
        corner.One of the corners in the top layer does not need &gt; to be
        cycled.If we are doing the "right handed" algorithm, put this &gt; blank
        corner in the bottom left corner with a U,U', orU2move.Then, do &gt;
        your algorithm, and reverse your setup moves.If it is a &gt;
        counter-clockwise cycle, then your blank corner goes in the bottom &gt;
        right corner. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you have cycled A, B, and C, you
        may eliminate B, and C from your &gt; string.Now, (ABCDE) becomes
        (ADE).Simple cycle (ADE) and you are done &gt; with that entire cycle.Do
        this until all corners are solved. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes, you
        will have one corner in one layer, and you will have two &gt; corners
        situated diagonally from each other in the other layer.This &gt; makes
        the setup move more difficult.However, in my misunderstandings &gt; with
        Leyan, I have come up with a good way of solving these &gt;
        situations.Consider the cycle (ABC).A and B are in the to player.A &gt;
        is in the bottom right corner and B is in the top left corner.C is in
        &gt; the bottom layer directly below A. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, try to
        algorithm (R' F R F')x3where x3 means you repeat those &gt; moves three
        times.You will notice that corners A and C are swapped, B &gt; remains
        untouched, but the other two diagonal corners in the top layer &gt; are
        swapped. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea here is that were' going to swap
        two corners, then we'll swap &gt; the other two.In the process, the
        corners getting swapped diagonally &gt; will be swapped twice, and they
        will return to their original &gt; positions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Remember, we want to swap A to B, B to C, and C to A.Since C wants to
        &gt; go to A, we apply the algorithm right away.Now, we do U2,which &gt;
        positions B in the location where A used to be, we do the algorithm &gt;
        again, and we've swapped (ABC).Remember to doU2again to undo your &gt;
        setup move.Because the corners in question are diagonal from each &gt;
        other, the setup moves in the middle of this algorithm are always &gt;
        double turns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, consider the same situation, but
        consider the cycle (BAC).Here, C &gt; wants to go to position
        B.Therefore, we must perform U2first in order &gt; to place C in B's
        position, and then we doU2and swap the others.Notice &gt; that we do not
        need aU2to reverse the setup move at the end.In this &gt; situation, we
        do not swap A and C first.A does want to go to C, but C &gt; is the lone
        corner, and if we swap A with C first, we will destroy it &gt; when we
        include the swap with B. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same method can be
        applied if two corners are diagonally in the &gt; bottom, and the other
        corner is in the top layer.Think about which &gt; position the top layer
        corner wants to go, and do that swap first.Then &gt; do D2, and do the
        next swap, and then reverse your setup moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In
        this process, it is sometimes necessary to position the corners with
        &gt; UorDmoves.Just make sure you reverse them when you're done.There
        are &gt; other similar algorithms such as(R B' R' B)x3.They're all
        basically &gt; the same. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, we will discuss cycles
        of even length.How do we cycle (AB) and &gt; (CD)?Experiment with the
        algorithm (R' F R' B2 R F' R' B2 R2) U (L F' &gt; L B2 L' F L B2 L2)
        U'.Notice you do not have to memorize anything &gt; new.Notice that this
        algorithm swaps the bottom left corner with the &gt; bottom right corner
        and the top left corner with the top right corner. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        However, sometimes it may be difficult to perform the necessary setup
        &gt; moves in order to place the corners in this configuration.Instead,
        we &gt; can swap the corners in two steps using a T-permutation.This is
        very &gt; similar to Stefan Pochmann's blindfold method. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Let's say we want to cycle (AB) and (CD).First, we will cycle A and
        &gt; B.Put A and B into the top right and bottom right corners in the to
        &gt; player.However, when doing these setup moves, we do not want to
        &gt; disturb the left and right edges in the top layer.This can be &gt;
        accomplished by performing a UorDmove combined with aF2orB2.Now, &gt;
        perform the algorithm(R U R' U')(R' F)(R2 U')(R' U' R U F').Now, you
        &gt; have successfully swapped corners A and B, but you have also
        swapped &gt; the left and right edges in the top layer.Reverse your
        setup moves, &gt; and now position C and D in the top right and bottom
        right corner &gt; positions, and do the algorithm again.You will swap C
        and D, and you &gt; will reverse the damage done to the edges. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Note, that a U2setup move will not damage your edges.Swapping
        the left &gt; and right edges is the same as the right and
        left.Sometimes, it is &gt; more convenient to swap the top right and
        bottom right corners, and &gt; then swap the top left and top right
        corners.This is also fine, but &gt; always keep in mind which edges are
        being swapped and be sure not to &gt; disturb them with your setup
        moves.If you do this, sometimes all four &gt; edges will be swapped.If
        this is the case, simply performM2 U M2 U2 M2 &gt; U M2and correct all
        four corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Memorizing:Being the numerically
        minded person that I am, I generally &gt; rely on the use of numbers to
        aid in my memorization.It should be &gt; clear that if your corners are
        given numbers 1 to 8, you can generate a &gt; numerical cycle such as (1
        5 7 2 4 3 8) which will give you all the &gt; information you need to
        complete the permutation of the &gt; corners.Numbers are especially
        useful if the permutation cycle &gt; resembles something mathematical
        such as (1 2 3 5 8)(4 6 7) where the &gt; first cycle consists of
        numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However,
        numbers have generally become obsolete with the general &gt;
        blindfolding population and many people rely on the shapes and the &gt;
        patters of the permutation that the path of the corners trace &gt;
        out.Everyone has a different way of memorizing things and so pretty &gt;
        much as long as you can retain the information, it doesn't matter how
        &gt; you do it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Edge Permutation:Permuting the edges
        is basically the exact same thing &gt; as permuting the corners.Instead,
        as stated above, the limitations of &gt; the setup moves are more
        liberal.We are allowed to make single turns &gt; on theF,B,U,
        andDfaces.All setup moves on the left and right sides &gt; must
        beL2andR2. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The algorithms you will use will be the
        basic three-edge cycles.These &gt; should be quite familiar to you from
        speed cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Edge Parity Correction:In this
        tutorial, I have explained &gt; how to correct corner parity in the
        event you wish to switch corner A &gt; with B and corner C with D.Edge
        parity can be done very similarly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you can
        situate your edges using the appropriate setup moves into an &gt;
        H-permutation (M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2)or Z-permutation(R B' R' B F R' F B'
        &gt; R' B R F2 U), then those algorithms will correct the parity for
        you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Note:The Z-permutation can be performed on the
        F,B,U, andDfaces and &gt; it will still maintain the orientation of the
        edges.The H-permutation &gt; can in fact be performed on any face.Try
        the H-permutation on theLface &gt; and notice is still preserves the
        orientation of your edges. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, the
        H-permutation + U2 or (M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2 U2)which swaps &gt; two sets
        of diagonal corners can also be performed on any face without &gt;
        interfering with the corner orientation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In general,
        corners that are being swapped diagonally may be swapped on &gt; any
        face.Otherwise, they are confined to UandD.Edges that are being &gt;
        swapped across and not adjacent may also be swapped on any &gt;
        face.Otherwise, they are confined toF,B,U, andD. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Sometimes, it can be difficult to perform setup moves that arrange all
        &gt; four edges on the same face.In such cases, the parity can be broken
        &gt; down into two steps.Suppose you want to swap edges A and B and
        edges C &gt; and D.Using the setup moves with the appropriate
        limitations (double &gt; turns for the left and right sides), place edge
        A at the FU position &gt; and edge B and the BU position.Then, perform
        the &gt; H-permutation.Reverse your setup moves and then put edge C in
        the FU &gt; position and edge D in the BU position and perform another
        &gt; H-permutation.Again, reverse your setup moves.This sequence first
        &gt; swaps edges A and B but also swaps edges at the FL and FR &gt;
        positions.The second H-permutation swaps edges C and D while &gt;
        correcting the FL and FR edges. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Corner and Edge
        Parity Correction: &gt; &gt; Corner and edge parity occurs when one
        wishes to swap corners A with B &gt; and edge C with D.If it is possible
        to bring A, B, C, and D all to the &gt; same face, then the appropriate
        PLL may be performed.It is important &gt; that if corners are being
        swapped non-diagonally and edges are being &gt; swapped adjacently, you
        probably have to perform the PLL on the U-face. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        However, sometimes this can be difficult to setup, especially if you
        &gt; are blindfolded.It is possible to break down the corner/edge parity
        &gt; correction into two steps. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, let us
        correct the corners.We will be utilizing the &gt; T-permutation, which
        will swap the FRU corner with the BRU &gt; corner.Position corner A and
        corner B into FRU and BRU.In doing so, &gt; it is important not to
        disturb &gt; &gt; Oh I'm sorry, you wanted to learn how to solve the

        Hello, Yesterday night I had an idea for the Rubik's Cube. Tyson told me
        that blindfolded cubing is good because you can actually solve it
        without touching it. &gt;From that, I made up something : In a normal
        Team-Blindfolded solve, one person (let's call her A) is blindfolded and
        the other (B) tells A what to do. But the thing is that B is not
        blindfolded. Now, what if both persons where blindfolded ? For exemple :
        Step 1 : A is blindfolded (B is not). Step 2 : A and B start the timer.
        Step 3 : B memorizes the cube. Step 4 : A and B are blindfolded and B
        tells A what to do. Step 5 : A and B stop the timer. I think this could
        be really fun to try. This is of course more difficult than the regular
        Team-Blindsolve, because someone has to memorize the cube. and the
        solver has to be more careful because if he makes a mistake : the other
        can't tell him how to fix it. Tell me what you think. Gilles.

        Hey Evan, You might have heard about the method that some other cubers
        use, the 'cycle' method. Well, Stefan's method is not unlike that. You
        also memorise cycles, but you memorise a cycle of stickers instead of
        pieces. So, when have to memorise more than 1 cycle, my memorisation
        looks a bit like this: (ABCDA) (EFGHIE) ... etc. (Note that the letters
        represent sticker positions here). After finishing the first cycle, the
        piece in the 'buffer position' is in the correct place. Just 'shoot'
        that piece to the 'starting point' of the new cycle (E, in my example).
        And at the end of the cycle, you 'shoot' the correct piece to E, and
        this will solve the 'buffer piece' again. Hope this helps :). Jo√´l. ---

        For the edges, at the worst you'll have 4 cycles (4 3-Cycles makes 12
        edges solved ;-)) Usually it's 1 or 2. Also, when you start the
        memorization of the edges, look if any cubie is in it's right position
        but flipped. I usually solve this one at the end of the edge-part. After
        a bit of practice, you should be able to detect if you have an

        &gt; I've some very bad news : &gt; I'm going to have to have a medical
        surgery at my left ring ringer &gt; because of speed (hardcore ?)
        cubing. I don't know the word in english &gt; but in french it's called
        a "kist" or "quiste sur le tendon" (I don't &gt; even know how it's
        written). But it's basically a problem of over- use &gt; of a tendon.
        &gt; &gt; I don't have to fix it right now. &gt; Actually it's still too
        small and it doesn't hurt me so there is no &gt; need to remove it now.
        But it will grow and eventually start to hurt &gt; (and making it harder
        to use that finger). &gt; &gt; The biggest problem is that after that
        surgery, I won't be able to use &gt; that hand for a while. So I think
        I'll focus on one-handed cubing &gt; (right handed) and blindfolded
        cubing and maybe on fewest moves also. &gt; &gt; I just wanted to let
        you know. &gt; But I don't stop cubing, I'll just stop speeding it for a
        while. &gt; &gt; Gilles. &gt;

        &gt; 2005/11/26, Jo√´l van Noort &lt;joel_vn@y...&gt;: &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey
        Evan, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You might have heard about the
        method that some other cubers use, &gt; &gt; &gt; the 'cycle' method.
        Well, Stefan's method is not unlike that. You &gt; &gt; &gt; also
        memorise cycles, but you memorise a cycle of stickers &gt; instead &gt;
        &gt; &gt; of pieces. So, when have to memorise more than 1 cycle, my
        &gt; &gt; &gt; memorisation looks a bit like this: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; (ABCDA) (EFGHIE) ... etc. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Note
        that the letters represent sticker positions here). After &gt; &gt; &gt;
        finishing the first cycle, the piece in the 'buffer position' is &gt; in
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the correct place. Just 'shoot' that piece to the
        'starting &gt; point' &gt; &gt; &gt; of the new cycle (E, in my
        example). And at the end of the cycle, &gt; &gt; &gt; you 'shoot' the
        correct piece to E, and this will solve &gt; the 'buffer &gt; &gt; &gt;
        piece' again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope this helps :). &gt;

        I've been messing around with different starts for f2l, and this one
        seems very viable. I start with three of the cross pieces, finish the
        2x2x3 with two f2l pairs, do the "square" like in Ryan Heise's method,
        and finish off with the last c/e pair. Sometimes I'll do the square
        before I do the 2x2x3 if I see all three pieces aren't in the 2x2x3
        slots; it's rather flexible. Also, if the cross/x-cross would be solved
        with only one more move or so, I'll switch to Fridrich. I averaged sub
        20 with it last night after only about two weeks of practicing, and my
        normal Fridrich average is around 19.5. I really think staring with only
        three cross pieces is great. Pros: -Very short "cross" makes it very
        easy to see x-"cross" or at least the first pair during preinspection
        every time. -average is about 28-30 moves for f2l; possibly 1.5-2 sec.
        faster than Fridrich Cons: -it's confusing to remember where the
        "square" needs to go because I use a lot of d turns. -There are some
        really bad square cases that I'm sure can be optimized if I sit down and
        find all of the tough cases. -It's hard to "shift gears" for that
        square. -It's annoying when a piece you need is where the last cross
        piece normally would be Any thoughts? Does anyone else do this? -James

        yellow cube with the yellow center on top and the "P" is made up of &gt;
        blue squares. Then the "H" has to be red, the "I" green and the "L",
        &gt; by virtue of the center being orange, CANNOT be orange. &gt; &gt;
        Let's think about what the left side of the "P" must be made of. &gt;
        Well, both blue-red corners are already used on the "H" side, so the
        &gt; corners of the left side of the "P" must both be blue-orange. Now
        &gt; which corner is at the bottom of the "P"? It can't be the blue-
        &gt; orange-white corner, because then part of the "L" would be orange.
        &gt; So it must be the blue-orange-yellow corner. That means the lower-
        &gt; right corner of the "L" - and hence the entire "L" - must be
        yellow. &gt; &gt; We need three yellow corners to make the "L". But
        guess what: both &gt; red-yellow corners are already on the opposite "H"
        side, so there's &gt; no way to get the three yellows we need. Sorry
        PHIL, but you ain't &gt; gonna happen. &gt; &gt; - - - - - - - - - - - -

        http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupGenerators.html The 3x3 group for
        example can obviously be generated by the group of six generators
        {U,D,L,R,F,B}. Since you can easily emulate for example the D turn with
        (F2 U2 B2 U2 L2 R2 B2 U B2 R2 L2 U2 B2 U2 F2) the set {U,L,R,F,B} also
        generates the 3x3 group. You can reduce this further, and it's also
        possible to generate the whole 3x3 with just 2 generators, in that case
        longer algorithms and not just face turns. I'm assuming you know some of
        this already but I wanted to summarize it for others who maybe don't.
        Btw, I kinda dislike it that for example we speak about those "six
        generators" above, even though each one alone is not a generator (for
        the full cube group), only together as a set. But that's the way it
        is... Cheers! Stefan

        makes up the lower-right part of the L, the other corner will also show
        orange and you'll have a C instead of an L. The second one may be
        doable. It's not possible to have a solid background for each of the
        letters (think about the I side - what must be on the H side and the
        left side of the P?) but I now have a configuration on my cube that
        spells PHIL in the manner you described. I'll see if it's solvable and
        if not, I might be able to figure out how to adjust it to make it

        Hello, Yes, I started doing that about a month ago, posted a message
        about it and no on responded. I am still a relative beginner, but my
        times dropped from 3-5min, to a consistent 50-60sec. I think it is
        quicker, easier and has great potential. Good to know I'm not the only

        &gt; very viable. I start with three of the cross pieces, &gt; finish
        the 2x2x3 with &gt; two f2l pairs, do the "square" like in Ryan Heise's
        &gt; method, and finish off &gt; with the last c/e pair. Sometimes I'll
        do the square &gt; before I do the 2x2x3 &gt; if I see all three pieces
        aren't in the 2x2x3 slots; &gt; it's rather flexible. &gt; Also, if the
        cross/x-cross would be solved with only &gt; one more move or so, &gt;
        I'll switch to Fridrich. &gt; &gt; I averaged sub 20 with it last night

        Fridrich average is around &gt; 19.5. I really think &gt; staring with
        only three cross pieces is great. &gt; &gt; Pros: &gt; -Very short
        "cross" makes it very easy to see &gt; x-"cross" or at least the &gt;

        moves for f2l; possibly &gt; 1.5-2 sec. faster than &gt; Fridrich &gt;
        &gt; Cons: &gt; -it's confusing to remember where the "square" needs
        &gt; to go because I use a &gt; lot of d turns. &gt; -There are some
        really bad square cases that I'm &gt; sure can be optimized if I &gt;

        I took this from a post in early August. &gt; P.S. How on Earth do you
        learn them all so fast?! I'm going at a &gt; snail's pace. I've put so
        much effort into my 4x4 lately I haven't &gt; learned a COLL case in
        probably two weeks. You already know more of &gt; them than I do. Are
        you learning them all from Lars' site, or do &gt; you use other sites,
        as well? If so, which ones? I have an easy time memorizing algorithms.
        What I have been doing is spending one day to learn an entire case of
        algorithms, then spending the next day to practice the recognition. So
        far the timeline looks like this: Day 1 -- Learn DoubleSune algs (easy,
        only 3 new algs, super-easy recognition) Day 2 -- Practice DoubleSune
        algs/recognition Day 3 -- Learn Sune/Antisune algs (10 new algs, but 5
        are mirrors!) Day 4 -- Practice Sune/Antisune algs/recognition Day 5 --
        Learn "T" algs (very easy recognition, only 5 new algs, but 1 is a
        mirror!) Day 6 (today) -- Practice "T" algs/recogntion Day 7 (tomorrow)
        -- Learn either U, L, or Pi cases etc. Only 3 cases remain, so I should
        be done learning by Sunday. :) ~ Bob --- In

        &gt; In a group, G, a set of generators is any set whose closure under
        the group operations (multiplication and inverse) is the entire group.
        For a finite group this is equivalent to the closure under
        multiplication being the whole group (as the inverse of an element is
        some power of that element). By convention the trivial group is
        generated by the empty set. (Because the identity element is the empty
        product.) If A is a set of generators then so is any superset of A (in
        G). A generator is an element of a set of generators. It only really
        makes sense to talk about a generator within the context of a set of
        generators. Typical sets of generators include {U,D,F,B,R,L} and
        {U,U2,D,D2,F,F2,B,B2,R,R2,L,L2} although neither of these is a minimal
        set of generators. For instance U is a generator if the set of
        generators is {U,D,F,B,R,L} but not in {D,F,B,R,L} (which also generates
        the usual cube group, though not of course the supercube group). U2 is
        not a generator in the QTM generators but it is in the HTM generators. A
        set of generators is minimal if it contains no proper subset which is a
        set of generators. This is minimal in the lattice of subsets of G - but
        it doesn't mean that such a set has minimal size amongst sets of
        generators (though a set of generators of minimal size is obviously a
        minimal set of generators). Any group has a set of generators - you can
        take the set of all the elements of the group as a trivial example (and
        you can also exclude the identity so an group has at least 2 sets of
        generators). At least assuming the axiom of choice every group has a
        minimal set of generators too. (I'm not sure if that can be proven
        without AC - it's been a long time...) Any generating set for the Rubik
        cube group has at least 2 elements (because a group with a generating
        set of fewer than 2 elements is Abelian, that is to say it commutes) and
        indeed the Rubik cube group is a 2-generator group, which is to say that
        there is a generating set with 2 elements. The supercube group is a
        6-generator group. There's an obvious set of generators of size 6, but
        by considering the action on the centres of any generating set we see
        that the generating set must have size at least 6. (Basically, the
        action on the centres must be commutative with each generator having
        order dividing 4 (wrt it s action on the centres) which means that a set
        of 5 elements can generate at most 4^5=1024 possible centre positions,
        whereas tere are 2048).

        Hello everybody. I had my first successful blind solve the other day! I
        didn't time it, but I did another one today and it took about 15
        minutes, including memorization. I used the method described on Macky's
        site, but instead of assigning numbers to each piece to memorize the
        cycles, I use letters A-H for the corners and A-L for the edges, and
        then create a sentence with the letters in the cycle. For example, the
        corner cycles from my solve today were (AECB)(HE) and the edge cycles
        were (ALCJFDGBKI)(EH). Then I came up with "All Excellent Cubes Break.
        His for Example." for the corners, and "All Lousy Cubes Just Find Dirty
        Garage Boxes to Keep In. Especially His." for the edges. For me at
        least, it seems a bit easier to remember a sentence than it is to
        remember a random sequence of numbers. Does anyone else do anything
        similar to this, or know of any other memorization tricks that have been
        helpful in blind solving? Duane

        &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the definition of a "generator"? &gt; &gt;
        http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupGenerators.html One thing about that
        page is that it doesn't say what it means by "repeated application of
        the generators". If they just mean to apply the binary operation
        repeatedly that isn't really accurate. For instance the group of
        integers is generated by {1} but not just by adding repeated adding of 1
        (which wouldn't yield any negative numbers, though it would yield 0 as
        the empty sum). If "repeated application of the generators" also allows
        for taking inverses then it is accurate. For finite groups you don't
        need inversion but you may need it for infinite groups (depending on
        your generating set), torsion groups aside. &gt; &gt; The 3x3 group for
        example can obviously be generated by the group of &gt; six generators
        {U,D,L,R,F,B}. Since you can easily emulate for example &gt; the D turn
        with (F2 U2 B2 U2 L2 R2 B2 U B2 R2 L2 U2 B2 U2 F2) the set &gt;
        {U,L,R,F,B} also generates the 3x3 group. You can reduce this further,
        &gt; and it's also possible to generate the whole 3x3 with just 2 &gt;
        generators, in that case longer algorithms and not just face turns. &gt;
        I'm assuming you know some of this already but I wanted to summarize
        &gt; it for others who maybe don't. Btw, I kinda dislike it that for
        &gt; example we speak about those "six generators" above, even though
        each &gt; one alone is not a generator (for the full cube group), only
        together &gt; as a set. But that's the way it is... &gt; &gt; Cheers!
        &gt; Stefan &gt; You're technically correct here - it's essentially an
        abuse of notation by assuming a particular set of generators. As long as
        it causes no confusion (that is everyone is talking about the same set
        of generators) then it's not a problem (because you can then assume that
        any time you mention a generator you are talking about that specific set
        of generators) but as soon as more than one set of generators is under
        discussion then it is essential to proceed as you mention. It's probably
        because the set of 6 generators above is a rather natural set of
        generators for the group, assuming you're using a Rubik's cube model of
        the group, which I guess people on this group probably are... It's
        certainly the most obvious set of generators in that context.

        So I recently tried out corners first cubing... and i really like it.
        It's kind of fune, especially since i solved it intuitively (well, i
        used PLLs for orienting the last four edges, but it was all intuitive
        other than that). now i know that you can get corners first pretty
        fast... but im not sure how to do some of the slice moves fast.

        Yes, Per's 9 moves were what I had in mind. Chris Hardwick called it
        "slant" pairing, that's why my hint. Understand it now? Still working on

        Hey congrats! i also remember my first BLD solve. It feels soo nice to
        open your eyes and find a solved cube right in front of you! As for the
        memorisation, i also use a lil bit of letters. For the corners i use
        numbers 1-8 but for the edges, memorising 12 nos was quite monotonous
        for me, so i name the middle layer edges as A, B, C, D. And i think it
        does help. Since its just your first few solves, its ok to make a story
        and all, but if you really want to go fast, you wont have time to make

        solution is what I had in mind) but I guess that was a bit hidden... The

        nl/files/StefanAlg.wmv Thanks, I like that a lot. I practiced it a few
        dozen times and it's now about as fast as my old alg for it, which was
        two Sunes: R' U' R U' R' U2 R2 U R' U R U2 R' I think I should be able
        to do the two Sunes faster with the cross on left (i.e. U' R' U R' U' R2
        U2 R U' R U R2 U') which is how I solve F2L now, but that other alg
        should still beat it. I'll probably give both a chance but right now I

        I am sure a number of people in this group would be interested in
        knowing about some results that have been posted on the Cube Lover's
        forum (http://cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal/) regarding the quarter-turn
        metric (QTM). Someone on that forum, identifying himself as Silviu,
        posted that he had found that the corners can always be solved in 22
        quarter turns or less without any net change in the location or
        orientation of the edges. In January, 2004, Tomas Rokicki had posted to
        this Yahoo group that the edges can always be solved in 18 quarter
        turns. Together, this shows that Rubik's cube can always be solved in
        two phases in no more than 18 + 22 = 40 quarter turns. I have personally
        verified Silviu's result using a C++ program. I have determined the
        positions of distance 17 and 18 in Rokicki's edges-only analysis. I have
        considered all the positions (unique with respect to the symmetries of
        the cube) where those edge configurations are combined with all possible
        corner configurations with the same permutation parity as the edge
        configuration. I have found that these positions are solveable using no
        more than 38 quarter turns. Since all the remaining positions of the
        cube can be solved with the above-mentioned two-phase method with no
        more than 16 + 22 = 38 quarter turns, this shows that all positions of
        Rubik's cube can be solved in no more than 38 quarter turns. The upper
        bound for the QTM has been considered to be 42 for the last several
        years, to my understanding. Verification of these new results will thus
        establish a new upper bound of 38 for the QTM. It may be possible to
        further consider positions of distance 16 in the edges-only analysis and
        show that 37 is also an upper bound. - Bruce [Non-text portions of this

        Hello everyone. I am not a computer person at all. In fact, I use a
        Macintosh. I think that there are not enought cube pages up on the
        internet, and so I would like to make one. All about CFOP and ROUX. Does
        anyone here use Macs and can help me make a webpage? I want to be able
        to put java applets and video. It can't be THAT hard... Jason Kovacic

        Do you ever build the square when an edge or a corner is in another f2l
        slot? I've found a couple good algs for some of them. I really need to
        write down all the algs I come up with, I keep forgetting them :P I got
        an avg of 19.3 with this method earlier today, so I'm probably going to
        switch to it. Eventually my goal would be to start with an x-"cross" all
        of the time, it seems really easy right now. James Stuber _____ From:

        Starting with only three cross pieces Hello, Yes, I started doing that
        about a month ago, posted a message about it and no on responded. I am
        still a relative beginner, but my times dropped from 3-5min, to a
        consistent 50-60sec. I think it is quicker, easier and has great
        potential. Good to know I'm not the only one. ERic --- James Stuber
        &lt;jestuber@...&gt; wrote: &gt; I've been messing around with different
        starts for &gt; f2l, and this one seems &gt; very viable. I start with
        three of the cross pieces, &gt; finish the 2x2x3 with &gt; two f2l
        pairs, do the "square" like in Ryan Heise's &gt; method, and finish off
        &gt; with the last c/e pair. Sometimes I'll do the square &gt; before I
        do the 2x2x3 &gt; if I see all three pieces aren't in the 2x2x3 slots;
        &gt; it's rather flexible. &gt; Also, if the cross/x-cross would be
        solved with only &gt; one more move or so, &gt; I'll switch to Fridrich.
        &gt; &gt; I averaged sub 20 with it last night after only &gt; about two
        weeks of &gt; practicing, and my normal Fridrich average is around &gt;
        19.5. I really think &gt; staring with only three cross pieces is great.
        &gt; &gt; Pros: &gt; -Very short "cross" makes it very easy to see &gt;
        x-"cross" or at least the &gt; first pair during preinspection every
        time. &gt; -average is about 28-30 moves for f2l; possibly &gt; 1.5-2
        sec. faster than &gt; Fridrich &gt; &gt; Cons: &gt; -it's confusing to
        remember where the "square" needs &gt; to go because I use a &gt; lot of
        d turns. &gt; -There are some really bad square cases that I'm &gt; sure
        can be optimized if I &gt; sit down and find all of the tough cases.
        &gt; -It's hard to "shift gears" for that square. &gt; -It's annoying
        when a piece you need is where the &gt; last cross piece normally &gt;
        would be &gt; &gt; Any thoughts? Does anyone else do this? &gt; &gt;

        Yes, Cubesmith is very helpful with 53 of the 54 stickers. But I am a
        big fan of the Rubik logo and when the logo sticker peels away, to me

        Of course, you should also remember that having an all-white center
        sticker increases the ease of returning the cube to its original solved
        state, since the orientation of the white center no longer matters :-)

        You could get the custom stickers with the rubik's logo of choice. And
        then you'd have fifty center stickers, and a bunch of sets. You'd never
        run out. Or we could ask to have cubesmith stock these center stickers.
        But there is probably some formal legal thing about printing the rubik's
        logo, and no one likes that stuff. So who knows... -Evan Until next

        Hello Everyone For anyone who is interested, I have made an average of
        the First 2 Blocks, or F2B. This is step 1 and 2 of the Roux method.
        14.44, (12.37), 17.76, 18.22, 16.69, 15.62, 20.78, (24.46), 17.06,
        15.97, 14.93, 16.39 F2B AVG 16.79 Its kind of like F2L, except you leave
        2 pieces of the cross unsolved, and neglect the M ring. Its a little
        easier than F2L, because its only 2 steps. You do I 3x2x1 Block and then
        build another. Once you do Step 1, its just like doing 2 pairs, but
        they're always filling the RF and RB slots, so you never lose your grip.
        Similar to F2L, the F2B is the key to getting fast at the ROUX method. I
        think that a 12 sec avg is a reasonably attainable goal. Also, I am
        almost fully color neutral. Full color neutrality is crazy to me, so I
        use 4 configurations. A. White on Left. Orange on bottom (starting w/
        white/orange block) B. Yellow on left. Orange on bottom ( ""
        yellow/orange block) C. White on left. Red on bottom ("" white/red
        block) D. Yellow on left. Red on Bottom ("" yellow/red block) Each of
        these is different to me. I like A and B the best. C and D are ok but
        harder for me (I used to do orange on bottom for CFOP). A, B, C, and D
        appear equally often as lucky cases for step 1, so I want to be equally
        good at all 4 of them. FOOD4THOUGHT.. Jason Kovacic Kovacic81@... PS.
        First sub-20 today with ROUX ==&gt; 19.35

        I see easy ways to insert part of block 2 early, or finish the final
        edge of block 1 last. I'm terrible about cube rotations, though, so I
        should definitely work on that. Perhaps I should try always holding the

        agree. With the same kind of mastery over F2B that people are beginning
        to show over F2L, I think 8 seconds is not unreasonable, and perhaps
        less, because it is so adaptable to accomodate more lucky cases. I just
        got curious enough after this debate to take an average (damn you
        Stefan! I need to get to bed), and I was somewhat surprised. I consider
        myself a mediocre F2B solver, with a lot to learn still, and very little
        work actually invested in the method. Still, I managed an 11.76 after 12
        solves. The more I get motivated to work on ZBF2L, the more promising
        this method seems. They're teasing me, really. That's it. I just need

        Yes, I meant to post something here as well. I got a really nice cube
        from there by "test-driving" one first. Check out the thread here for
        photos: http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?
        t=4145&amp;sid=d7721265a90c210e4c276be4e1f68948 Basically it's a replica
        of the old Ideal packaging. Even the instructions look similar to the
        old style, but updated. They include a reference to Macky's 12.11 second
        record in there, but the text and graphics are similar to the original
        instructions. Yes, the stickers will wear out quickly, but of course
        nowadays we have the technology to remedy that easily enough. Chris &gt;
        I've just learned via twistypuzzles that Restoration Hardware now has
        &gt; the cube for $12. Evidently they are not shrinkwrapped. So go to
        your &gt; local location, try them all out until they get mad at you,

        Yeah, apparently a lot of people had that same idea :) Cubesmith is set
        up to put any name on that logo. I actually edited mine manually because
        I wanted to preserve the exact "Rubik" script. I notice the new
        Restoration Hardware cubes logo have an (R) next to the word "Rubik's"
        instead of a TM next to the word "CUBE." I still think it's a nice

        That's the only place I've seen them. Winning Moves doesn't even have it
        on their site yet. I wouldn't be surprised to see it show up in other
        places that specialize in retro gear... maybe Cracker Barrel for
        example. The price is more expensive (probably because of the bulkier
        packaging, or just Restoration Hardware's markup). I don't think these
        are any different physically than the 25th anniversary cubes, but they
        are a newer batch. The serial number on mine says M1005B, so I think
        they were just manufactured last month. Chris --- In

        Congratulations! Yes, that's happened to me recently. Last week, my
        average suddenly dropped too (25 to 23). Also, one day I was suddenly
        able to do F2L smoother than I had done previously. Hopefully another
        one of these drops will drop me into the sub-20 range. Vincent On

        Ah, if only it were that easy! (If anyone finds a font that resembles
        the Rubik script, let us all know.) What I did was get a good high
        quality raster image (i.e. JPG) of the logo. Then I just started cutting
        and pasting to transform the R into a P, the b into two l's. The letter
        "e" can be gotten from the word "Cube" or "Revenge" on the old
        packaging. I had to improvise on the "y" although a modified "g" might
        work. Then you need a good program to conver the raster to a vector for
        the final cleanup. Adobe LiveTrace works well for this. My final product
        isn't perfect but looks good enough on a small printout. Chris --- In

        Hello again I'd like to start off by saying that I was just being
        sarcastic when I said that there were not enough websites about cubing.
        There are a lot. I do think that there are way to many about CFOP and
        not enough about corners first, Petrus, Roux... Also, I just meant that
        a 12s F2B was a good goal for me. Its crazy to me that people can do F2L
        in 9 sec on average! F2B For the F2B, I think that 8 secs is attainable
        with color neutrality. 10 sec is possible with starting with same block
        every time I think that even using the slower method for the 2nd block
        (DR edge, 2 pairs), you can do the 2nd block in 5sec. On Gilles site he
        says 5 sec is what you need. I figure 1 sec for DR edge and 2 sec for
        each CE pair. SO 5 sec for 2nd Block. So the real question is- how fast
        can the first block be done on average? I think that for the same block
        every time, 4s is about right. If you use some color neutrality, I think
        that this can be reduced to sub 3. Lots of lucky cases for step 1. So
        with the same block every time (4s) you end up with a 9s avg with lucky
        blocks (2-3s?) you can be sub 8. As i said earlier, F2B is defenitely
        the key to speedsolving with this method. Block 1 4s Block 2 5s CLL 3s
        Step 4 5s Total 17s avg And also, does everyone think that it is easier
        to learn CLL/COLL by "reading" 4 stickers? Or to recognize which 2
        corners need to switch? Do you think that learning more than one color
        for CLL/COLL is a lot harder? Im trying to decide if I should just do
        red on top, or red and orange... What do you guys think? Jason Kovacic

        10 sec is possible with starting with same block every time But why?
        Even always creating the same two blocks, you retain color recognition
        but gain double chances for lucky starts. &gt; I think that even using
        the slower method for the 2nd block &gt; (DR edge, 2 pairs), you can do
        the 2nd block in 5sec. On Gilles site &gt; he says 5 sec is what you
        need. I figure 1 sec for DR edge and 2 sec &gt; for each CE pair. SO 5
        sec for 2nd Block. Try solving the c/e pairs first or first and third in
        whichever block if you happen to find good cases for them before the
        edge. It takes no time, really, and often saves moves. Consider the
        scramble: (S) R (S') R U2 R2 Notice how the inverse solves the position
        easily. The best you can hope for with the rigid method is several moves
        longer and much less fun. &gt; So the real question is- how fast can the
        first block be done on average? &gt; &gt; I think that for the same
        block every time, 4s is about right. &gt; If you use some color
        neutrality, I think that this can be reduced to &gt; sub 3. Lots of
        lucky cases for step 1. &gt; &gt; So with the same block every time (4s)
        you end up with a 9s avg &gt; with lucky blocks (2-3s?) you can be sub
        8. I definitely think 4 seconds is a reasonably attainable goal, but it
        requires flexibility. Good starts with Roux are much easier to see than,
        for example, X-cross, but I think that with enough practice, the
        recognition becomes easier and the solutions just pop out to you
        quicker. I can find myself planning out solutions involving three or
        more pairs sometimes, just because the blocks are nice. Practice is key.
        &gt; As i said earlier, F2B is defenitely the key to speedsolving with
        this &gt; method. &gt; &gt; Block 1 4s &gt; Block 2 5s &gt; CLL 3s &gt;
        Step 4 5s &gt; Total 17s avg I think that 4 + 5 + 2.5 + 5 = 16.5 should
        be fairly doable by anyone willing to put forth enough effort. I posted
        a couple of things on the ZB group recently about a thought I had that
        intrigued me. If people can learn nearly 800 sequences for full ZB, why
        can't we apply a similar technique to this method? The obvious places to
        apply it are on steps 3 and 4. There are a couple of possibilities I'd
        like to examine. One is learning both CLL and COLL cases for each of the
        step 3 cases. If you happen to notice the edges are all correctly
        oriented after step 2, you could apply a slightly slower COLL case and
        maintain the orientation after step 3, giving you a better case for step
        4. The other option involves learning how to finish every possible case
        from step 4, once all the edges are correctly oriented. I think that
        it's between 14 and 30 cases + mirrors. And because they can all be
        solved using M U L R they can all be solved very quickly. I'm curious
        what the actual case count and average move number for this is. Both of
        these taken together could lead to ZB type LL's for what is quickly
        earning a place in my mind as a very competitive method, but at a
        fraction of the number of algs. &gt; And also, does everyone think that
        it is easier to learn CLL/COLL by &gt; "reading" 4 stickers? Or to
        recognize which 2 corners need to switch? &gt; &gt; Do you think that
        learning more than one color for CLL/COLL is a lot &gt; harder? Im
        trying to decide if I should just do red on top, or red &gt; and
        orange... Well, I'm partial to recognizing them by which corners need to
        switch. The sticker method is more abstract. It puts an extra layer
        between you and understanding what exactly is going on with the cube.
        The other way, there are no patterns to remember. Only the OLL case and
        which corners need to switch. &gt; What do you guys think? &gt; &gt;

        actually somewhat helpful. The only real problem I have is not being
        able to track the yellow pieces at the beginning as well for the same

        Hey everyone, Of course this assume that we have a RWC2007 (which I for
        one vote for to be in Europe), but what are your goals? I for one have
        really neglected blindfold cubing, and have rediscovered that I like it
        very much. I want to learn BLD cubing better, and hopefully be using
        some ZB techniques on easy cases that I will have known for 2-3 years by
        2007 for speedsolving. What are everyone else's goals? Anyone rediscover
        a category they like, or discover a category? Just wanted to ask a
        general question. I'm curious what everyone likes/wants to pursue after
        RWC2005 :-) Chris

        for my standards (25s cuber), but didn't make the 2nd round in anything.
        I had a 24.89s 3x3 solve, a 1m47s 4x4 solve, and 10 and 11 sec 2x2
        solves. The 2nd day in Orlando, I started doing all Roux solves. So I

        Also I have made an average of Step 4. I do a brief preinspection, since
        you can spot all of the edges during step 3. This step is comparable to
        OLL/PLL, b/c it has orientation and permutation substeps. 5.15, 4.86,

        Avg 6.48s I use method 2 on Gilles site. Orient all 6 edges, pair up
        Ledge and Redge and insert, and an easy 4 move PLL. You kind of just
        figure things out on your own; Its pretty intuitive, and you have a lot
        of freedom. Averaging about 15 moves, its a pretty good system and its
        all I use for now. Jason Kovacic

        Ah ok ... Then i guess u have somehow installed that directx version by
        some mistake. It looks like ur card doesn't support the directx 9a API.
        This could be disastrous for various games or other software that use
        directx9 automatically when it finds that version of directx installed.
        Oh well, if u are not a gamer i guess u should be fine :-) -Per PS!

        Here are my thoughts on possible improvements for step 4 keep in mind
        that I do not claim these ideas as my own. I am just organizing some
        methods. Possible improvements for Step 4 1. Learn COLL in addition to
        CLL for cases where edges are already oriented correctly 2. Orient Edges
        1st and only learn COLL (?_) 3. If Bottom 2 edges are oriented
        correctly, and the ledge and redge are somewhere in top layer, Then ELL
        could solve all cases in 1 Algorithm, leaving you with a 4 move PLL. 4.
        Learn the 8 algorithms in Ming Thai's method. FOr cases where a redge or
        ledge is already in place, you can insert final edge and orient midges.
        I never learned these, but they could be useful in certain cases Mike-
        Where is there a table of ZBLL like cases for step 4? Or do we have to
        make one? I don't really like method 3 on gilles site if thats what
        youre talking about. But i am in favor of exploring the options. If all
        edges are Oriented, then Its just a matter of permuting 6 oriented
        cubies. That should be able to be done with a single algorithm. How many
        cases could there possible be? Jason Kovacic Kovacic81@...

        Hi Chris, I have a few goals for RWC2007 - which I also vote for to be
        in London. I mean Europe. :) I also want to be using a good set of ZB
        algorithms, for now I am focussing on the cases which can be solved
        using a 2-generator algorithm (which is of course one COLL case per
        orientation). I want to be able to know those inside out, and I also
        want to be solving at least 2 of the orientations fully using ZB. Of
        course, I would love to be using full ZB, but I think that would take
        too much time, which as you get older you find you don't have so much
        of! That's why I'm already envying the 14-18 age range in our group ;) I
        want to be averaging 14 seconds over an average of 5 cubes, because I
        feel this will be the winning target at RWC2007. This won't only be an
        improvement in technique, but also an improvement in the total physical
        and mental regime which you now need to have to be successful in a high
        pressure competition. I want to be averaging at least 1 min 10 for the
        4x4x4, and I want to dramatically improve my times for the 5x5x5. I will
        also practice hard at the Magic, buy myself a Master Magic and learn
        that, and I will also beat Stefan at the Clock like I have promised him
        for ages. I will also have fully mastered blindfold solving and I hope
        to be one of the best in the world by RWC 2007. I have already solved
        once or twice blindfolded, and using my system for memorisation I have
        already "made" a solution in 3 minutes. By this I mean I have memorised
        edges and solved them, stopped the timer, then started again with
        memorising corners and solving. Once I get the hang of putting it all
        together, and get the hang of automating setup moves or learning the new
        algorithms Stefan and I have been talking about, it would be very fast.
        The limiting factor would be actually finding the pieces to remember!
        AND I will take part on the Fewest Moves Competition! These are my
        primary goals. On the side, I would very dearly love to get the hang of
        square-1, but at the moment it is taking me too long to learn, as the
        techniques required are very different to speedsolving a cube,
        particularly if you approach it blindly by just learning the algorithms,
        as I am free to admit that I do as far as the sq-1 is concerned. I am
        sure that I will also practice hard at the Megaminx, the key lies in
        finding the pieces which just comes from practice I think, and also
        learning a good system. So, unlike a lot of people these days, I have
        chosen not to focus in on one puzzle. This is going to be a lot of hard
        work, but it will also be very satisfying to see improvements in my
        puzzles. I admire the cubers who are very fast at all of the cube sizes,
        such as yourself Chris, or Lars, Ron, Frank, and many others of course,
        and I always look up to you for sources of inspiration. Good Luck to
        everyone in their practice for competitions, not only RWC2007 of course!

        Hi Dan and Chris, My goals for RWC2007 are significantly less ambitious
        than yours. :) My primary goal for RWC2005 was to get a sub-30s solve,
        which I did (27.96s). RWV2007 is so far away that I'm not really sure
        what is a realistic goal for me. I'm still using a 3-look LL, so an
        obvious goal would be to have learnt all OLLs and be fluent at them. I
        think this is achieveable, but if I say it here then it means I'll have
        to do it! ;) I'd like to compete in the 4x4x4 again. I competed in that
        at RWC2003, but for some reason haven't entered it again at any other
        competitions. Actually, I know why, it's because I preferred the
        Eastsheen 4x4x4s. :( The Rubik's 4x4x4 I have now is actually okay, so
        maybe I will enter that event at RWC2007. I think I should aim to get my
        5x5x5 times down to something reasonable so I can enter that event. I've
        never competed in the 5x5x5 because I'm never sure if I'm going to
        finish it before the stackmat times out! ;) I entered one-handed 3x3x3
        for the first time at RWC2005. It was more fun than I expected so I'd be
        interested in giving that another go. Hopefully faster as well since my
        current average is a little over 2 minutes one-handed! Jasmine

        Europe. :) &gt; I also want to be using a good set of ZB algorithms, for
        now I &gt; am &gt; focussing on the cases which can be solved using a
        2-generator &gt; algorithm (which is of course one COLL case per
        orientation). I &gt; want &gt; to be able to know those inside out, and
        I also want to be &gt; solving &gt; at least 2 of the orientations fully
        using ZB. Of course, I &gt; would &gt; love to be using full ZB, but I
        think that would take too much &gt; time, &gt; which as you get older
        you find you don't have so much of! &gt; That's &gt; why I'm already
        envying the 14-18 age range in our group ;) &gt; I want to be averaging
        14 seconds over an average of 5 cubes, &gt; because I feel this will be
        the winning target at RWC2007. This &gt; won't only be an improvement in
        technique, but also an &gt; improvement &gt; in the total physical and
        mental regime which you now need to &gt; have &gt; to be successful in a
        high pressure competition. I want to be &gt; averaging at least 1 min 10
        for the 4x4x4, and I want to &gt; dramatically improve my times for the
        5x5x5. I will also &gt; practice &gt; hard at the Magic, buy myself a
        Master Magic and learn that, and &gt; I &gt; will also beat Stefan at
        the Clock like I have promised him for &gt; ages. &gt; I will also have
        fully mastered blindfold solving and I hope to &gt; be &gt; one of the
        best in the world by RWC 2007. I have already solved &gt; once &gt; or
        twice blindfolded, and using my system for memorisation I &gt; have &gt;
        already "made" a solution in 3 minutes. By this I mean I have &gt;
        memorised edges and solved them, stopped the timer, then started &gt;
        again with memorising corners and solving. Once I get the hang &gt; of
        &gt; putting it all together, and get the hang of automating setup &gt;
        moves &gt; or learning the new algorithms Stefan and I have been talking
        &gt; about, &gt; it would be very fast. The limiting factor would be
        actually &gt; finding &gt; the pieces to remember! &gt; AND I will take
        part on the Fewest Moves Competition! &gt; These are my primary goals.
        On the side, I would very dearly &gt; love to &gt; get the hang of
        square-1, but at the moment it is taking me too &gt; long &gt; to learn,
        as the techniques required are very different to &gt; speedsolving a
        cube, particularly if you approach it blindly by &gt; just &gt; learning
        the algorithms, as I am free to admit that I do as far &gt; as &gt; the
        sq-1 is concerned. I am sure that I will also practice hard &gt; at &gt;
        the Megaminx, the key lies in finding the pieces which just &gt; comes
        &gt; from practice I think, and also learning a good system. &gt; So,
        unlike a lot of people these days, I have chosen not to &gt; focus in
        &gt; on one puzzle. This is going to be a lot of hard work, but it &gt;
        will &gt; also be very satisfying to see improvements in my puzzles. I
        &gt; admire &gt; the cubers who are very fast at all of the cube sizes,
        such as &gt; yourself Chris, or Lars, Ron, Frank, and many others of
        course, &gt; and &gt; I always look up to you for sources of
        inspiration. &gt; Good Luck to everyone in their practice for
        competitions, not &gt; only &gt; RWC2007 of course! &gt; Dan Harris :)

        &gt; &gt; Of course this assume that we have a RWC2007 (which I for one
        &gt; vote &gt; for &gt; &gt; to be in Europe), but what are your goals?
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I for one have really neglected blindfold cubing,
        and have &gt; &gt; rediscovered that I like it very much. I want to
        learn BLD &gt; cubing &gt; &gt; better, and hopefully be using some ZB
        techniques on easy &gt; cases &gt; that I &gt; &gt; will have known for
        2-3 years by 2007 for speedsolving. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are
        everyone else's goals? Anyone rediscover a category &gt; they &gt; &gt;
        like, or discover a category? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just wanted to ask a
        general question. I'm curious what &gt; everyone &gt; &gt; likes/wants

        Hi! My goal is to win everything next time! I aim for sub 13 avg on
        3x3x3, sub 1:00 avg on 4x4x4 and sub 2:00 avg on 5x5x5. Pluss win clock,
        megaminx, magic, OH, BLD, fewest moves and also feet competition :-P
        Nah, seriously i hope to keep improving on the 5x5x5 and be so calm that
        i can do my normal times. And i do aim for winning fewest moves! I
        really hope stickers will be allowed next time. That's my serious goals.
        Im not gonna waste my time trying to learn fridrich or more advanced
        systems for 3x3x3. Even if i do so, competition is way too tough. I
        solely do speed 3x3x3 out of decency ... lol ... Sub 30 secs is
        impressive for 99.95% of the population ;-) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        goals for RWC2007 are significantly less ambitious than yours. :) &gt;
        &gt; My primary goal for RWC2005 was to get a sub-30s solve, which I did
        &gt; (27.96s). RWV2007 is so far away that I'm not really sure what is a
        &gt; realistic goal for me. I'm still using a 3-look LL, so an obvious
        goal &gt; would be to have learnt all OLLs and be fluent at them. I
        think this is &gt; achieveable, but if I say it here then it means I'll
        have to do it! ;) &gt; &gt; I'd like to compete in the 4x4x4 again. I
        competed in that at RWC2003, &gt; but for some reason haven't entered it
        again at any other competitions. &gt; Actually, I know why, it's because
        I preferred the Eastsheen 4x4x4s. :( &gt; The Rubik's 4x4x4 I have now
        is actually okay, so maybe I will enter &gt; that event at RWC2007. &gt;
        &gt; I think I should aim to get my 5x5x5 times down to something
        reasonable &gt; so I can enter that event. I've never competed in the
        5x5x5 because I'm &gt; never sure if I'm going to finish it before the
        stackmat times out! ;) &gt; &gt; I entered one-handed 3x3x3 for the
        first time at RWC2005. It was more &gt; fun than I expected so I'd be
        interested in giving that another go. &gt; Hopefully faster as well
        since my current average is a little over 2 &gt; minutes one-handed!

        Cool topic! I plan to get more into the one-handed solving. I didn't
        compete in that event at WC05, because I had never really even tried a
        OH solve before. However, once I tried it, I realized I wasn't bad at
        it. So I'm going to work on that. The other big thing is perfecting some
        finger tricks. I've been solving for many years using full hand-twisting
        motions. I made the decision prior to WC05 to stick with that rather
        than learn a whole new style. However, in the last three weeks I've been
        studying sites like N8's and Yuki's and I've improved several of my
        algorithms' speed by applying FSC's. I especially like the "Zoku"
        contest that Macky posted a link to. This is a whole new side of
        speedcubing (for me), and I'm really enjoying the learning experience.
        Aside from that, I really should focus on speedsolving Megaminx and
        Square-1. I sat out those events this time to focus solely on the
        regular cubes. But next time I'd like to compete in more categories. Oh,
        I also plan to enter the 6x6x6 category! Chris --- In

        Well, I've finally decided to sit down and finish learning OLL. I've got
        less than half down now, but hopefully this means I will be more
        consistent by 2007. Sub 16 (at home) should be possible once I get them
        all down, so Sub-17 avg at the RWC2007 would be nice :-) I also hope to
        get more competative on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, although I have not been
        doing much lately with either of them. And of course, I plan on setting
        the WR on the 6x6x6, as well ;-) Doug cmhardw wrote: &gt;Hey everyone,

        This is a tough question. Okay, here are my goals: AR for clock (with
        the only intention being to annoy Craig) 1st place for the magic,
        hopefully sub-1 second. 1st place for the master magic, probably sub-2.5
        seconds. 1st place for the super magic. (Hopefully by then it's an
        event). Certainly make the 3x3x3 semi-finals. It depends on how long it
        takes me to finish learning ZB for me to decide on any time goals. Do
        respectable on the 4x4, 5x5, megaminx, and square-1. That means I
        actually have to learn how to finish the square-1, but I do have 2
        years, right? :) I also want to be top-5 in the one-handed category. I
        know I can do this because I did it in the first round. I suppose I
        should start practicing that again. And I want a damn successful
        blindsolve. I don't practice it all, but I at least want something other
        than DNF! I will eventually have to break down and practice it more :( I
        want to make the finals for the 2x2 category, also. I just missed it
        last time. :( My vote is also for Europe. ~ Bob --- In

        Hi!! My primary goal is to get a sub-15 average. I'm focusing on the
        3*3*3 right now. Regular and one-handed solving. I'd be very proud to be
        in the "top-20 in the world"-list or beating Devid Wesleys swedish
        record of 15.91. I have practiced a bit one-handed lately and my average
        is 42.68 at the moment. My goal there is to achive a sub-30 average. By
        the way, I haven't been able to cube with my hands lately because I have
        an inflamed muscle in my left lower arm, so I've done some footcubing.
        2:19,71 is my best time so far. I'll very soon reach sub- 2 minutes!!

        goals for RWC2007 are significantly less ambitious than yours. :) &gt;
        &gt; My primary goal for RWC2005 was to get a sub-30s solve, which I did
        &gt; (27.96s). RWV2007 is so far away that I'm not really sure what is a
        &gt; realistic goal for me. I'm still using a 3-look LL, so an obvious
        goal &gt; would be to have learnt all OLLs and be fluent at them. I
        think this is &gt; achieveable, but if I say it here then it means I'll
        have to do it! ;) &gt; &gt; I'd like to compete in the 4x4x4 again. I
        competed in that at RWC2003, &gt; but for some reason haven't entered it
        again at any other competitions. &gt; Actually, I know why, it's because
        I preferred the Eastsheen 4x4x4s. :( &gt; The Rubik's 4x4x4 I have now
        is actually okay, so maybe I will enter &gt; that event at RWC2007. &gt;
        &gt; I think I should aim to get my 5x5x5 times down to something
        reasonable &gt; so I can enter that event. I've never competed in the
        5x5x5 because I'm &gt; never sure if I'm going to finish it before the
        stackmat times out! ;) &gt; &gt; I entered one-handed 3x3x3 for the
        first time at RWC2005. It was more &gt; fun than I expected so I'd be
        interested in giving that another go. &gt; Hopefully faster as well
        since my current average is a little over 2 &gt; minutes one-handed!

        said: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Chris, &gt; &gt; I have a few goals for
        RWC2007 - which I also vote for to be in &gt; &gt; London. I mean
        Europe. :) &gt; &gt; I also want to be using a good set of ZB
        algorithms, for now I &gt; &gt; am &gt; &gt; focussing on the cases
        which can be solved using a 2-generator &gt; &gt; algorithm (which is of
        course one COLL case per orientation). I &gt; &gt; want &gt; &gt; to be
        able to know those inside out, and I also want to be &gt; &gt; solving
        &gt; &gt; at least 2 of the orientations fully using ZB. Of course, I
        &gt; &gt; would &gt; &gt; love to be using full ZB, but I think that
        would take too much &gt; &gt; time, &gt; &gt; which as you get older you
        find you don't have so much of! &gt; &gt; That's &gt; &gt; why I'm
        already envying the 14-18 age range in our group ;) &gt; &gt; I want to
        be averaging 14 seconds over an average of 5 cubes, &gt; &gt; because I
        feel this will be the winning target at RWC2007. This &gt; &gt; won't
        only be an improvement in technique, but also an &gt; &gt; improvement
        &gt; &gt; in the total physical and mental regime which you now need to
        &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; to be successful in a high pressure
        competition. I want to be &gt; &gt; averaging at least 1 min 10 for the
        4x4x4, and I want to &gt; &gt; dramatically improve my times for the
        5x5x5. I will also &gt; &gt; practice &gt; &gt; hard at the Magic, buy
        myself a Master Magic and learn that, and &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; will
        also beat Stefan at the Clock like I have promised him for &gt; &gt;
        ages. &gt; &gt; I will also have fully mastered blindfold solving and I
        hope to &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; one of the best in the world by RWC 2007.
        I have already solved &gt; &gt; once &gt; &gt; or twice blindfolded, and
        using my system for memorisation I &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; already
        "made" a solution in 3 minutes. By this I mean I have &gt; &gt;
        memorised edges and solved them, stopped the timer, then started &gt;
        &gt; again with memorising corners and solving. Once I get the hang &gt;
        &gt; of &gt; &gt; putting it all together, and get the hang of
        automating setup &gt; &gt; moves &gt; &gt; or learning the new
        algorithms Stefan and I have been talking &gt; &gt; about, &gt; &gt; it
        would be very fast. The limiting factor would be actually &gt; &gt;
        finding &gt; &gt; the pieces to remember! &gt; &gt; AND I will take part
        on the Fewest Moves Competition! &gt; &gt; These are my primary goals.
        On the side, I would very dearly &gt; &gt; love to &gt; &gt; get the
        hang of square-1, but at the moment it is taking me too &gt; &gt; long
        &gt; &gt; to learn, as the techniques required are very different to
        &gt; &gt; speedsolving a cube, particularly if you approach it blindly
        by &gt; &gt; just &gt; &gt; learning the algorithms, as I am free to
        admit that I do as far &gt; &gt; as &gt; &gt; the sq-1 is concerned. I
        am sure that I will also practice hard &gt; &gt; at &gt; &gt; the
        Megaminx, the key lies in finding the pieces which just &gt; &gt; comes
        &gt; &gt; from practice I think, and also learning a good system. &gt;
        &gt; So, unlike a lot of people these days, I have chosen not to &gt;
        &gt; focus in &gt; &gt; on one puzzle. This is going to be a lot of hard
        work, but it &gt; &gt; will &gt; &gt; also be very satisfying to see
        improvements in my puzzles. I &gt; &gt; admire &gt; &gt; the cubers who
        are very fast at all of the cube sizes, such as &gt; &gt; yourself
        Chris, or Lars, Ron, Frank, and many others of course, &gt; &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; I always look up to you for sources of inspiration. &gt; &gt;
        Good Luck to everyone in their practice for competitions, not &gt; &gt;
        only &gt; &gt; RWC2007 of course! &gt; &gt; Dan Harris :) &gt; &gt; ---

        Hey everyone, Wow, I'm glad this topic took off and I guess I should
        answer with a little more thought also. Dan I'm starting to think like
        you, I don't want to focus on just one puzzle. Every time I try to focus
        on one, I feel bad for not practicing something else I really enjoy. My
        goals for RWC2007 would most likely be to improve my blindfolded rank
        (which I've neglected the most this year), and also to successfully do
        the 4x4x4 BLD. I will attempt the 5x5x5, and I guess in two years I
        might be ok at it, but my goal is the 4x4x4 record right now, sorry Dror
        :-( I also want to just stay competitive at all my favorite puzzles. I
        will of course buy a 6x6x6 and hope to be in the top-10 for that, but I
        imagine that puzzle will take some work of course. I guess I would be
        happy just to compete in the 6x6x6. I also want to either use ZB, or use
        it to train for Fridrich and hopefully improve my 3x3x3 rank, but with
        the competition as stiff as it is now I will just approach that category
        to hope to do well, but to have fun either way. Everyone keep posting
        your goals, they are really fun to read! It's really cool to see how our
        little hobby is evolving into more of a serious "quirky sport" ;-) Chris

        few goals for RWC2007 - which I also vote for to be in &gt; London. I
        mean Europe. :) &gt; &gt; I also want to be using a good set of ZB
        algorithms, for now I am &gt; focussing on the cases which can be solved
        using a 2-generator &gt; algorithm (which is of course one COLL case per
        orientation). I want &gt; to be able to know those inside out, and I
        also want to be solving &gt; at least 2 of the orientations fully using
        ZB. Of course, I would &gt; love to be using full ZB, but I think that
        would take too much time, &gt; which as you get older you find you don't
        have so much of! That's &gt; why I'm already envying the 14-18 age range
        in our group ;) &gt; &gt; I want to be averaging 14 seconds over an
        average of 5 cubes, &gt; because I feel this will be the winning target
        at RWC2007. This &gt; won't only be an improvement in technique, but
        also an improvement &gt; in the total physical and mental regime which
        you now need to have &gt; to be successful in a high pressure
        competition. I want to be &gt; averaging at least 1 min 10 for the
        4x4x4, and I want to &gt; dramatically improve my times for the 5x5x5. I
        will also practice &gt; hard at the Magic, buy myself a Master Magic and
        learn that, and I &gt; will also beat Stefan at the Clock like I have
        promised him for ages. &gt; &gt; I will also have fully mastered
        blindfold solving and I hope to be &gt; one of the best in the world by
        RWC 2007. I have already solved once &gt; or twice blindfolded, and
        using my system for memorisation I have &gt; already "made" a solution
        in 3 minutes. By this I mean I have &gt; memorised edges and solved
        them, stopped the timer, then started &gt; again with memorising corners
        and solving. Once I get the hang of &gt; putting it all together, and
        get the hang of automating setup moves &gt; or learning the new
        algorithms Stefan and I have been talking about, &gt; it would be very
        fast. The limiting factor would be actually finding &gt; the pieces to
        remember! &gt; &gt; AND I will take part on the Fewest Moves
        Competition! &gt; &gt; These are my primary goals. On the side, I would
        very dearly love to &gt; get the hang of square-1, but at the moment it
        is taking me too long &gt; to learn, as the techniques required are very
        different to &gt; speedsolving a cube, particularly if you approach it
        blindly by just &gt; learning the algorithms, as I am free to admit that
        I do as far as &gt; the sq-1 is concerned. I am sure that I will also
        practice hard at &gt; the Megaminx, the key lies in finding the pieces
        which just comes &gt; from practice I think, and also learning a good
        system. &gt; &gt; So, unlike a lot of people these days, I have chosen
        not to focus in &gt; on one puzzle. This is going to be a lot of hard
        work, but it will &gt; also be very satisfying to see improvements in my
        puzzles. I admire &gt; the cubers who are very fast at all of the cube
        sizes, such as &gt; yourself Chris, or Lars, Ron, Frank, and many others
        of course, and &gt; I always look up to you for sources of inspiration.
        &gt; &gt; Good Luck to everyone in their practice for competitions, not
        only &gt; RWC2007 of course! &gt; &gt; Dan Harris :)

        Possible improvements for Step 4 &gt; &gt; 1. Learn COLL in addition to
        CLL for cases where edges are already &gt; oriented correctly &gt; &gt;
        2. Orient Edges 1st and only learn COLL (?_) &gt; &gt; 3. If Bottom 2
        edges are oriented correctly, and the ledge and redge &gt; are somewhere
        in top layer, Then ELL could solve all cases in 1 &gt; Algorithm,
        leaving you with a 4 move PLL. &gt; &gt; 4. Learn the 8 algorithms in
        Ming Thai's method. &gt; FOr cases where a redge or ledge is already in
        place, you can &gt; insert final edge and orient midges. I never learned
        these, but they &gt; could be useful in certain cases &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Mike- &gt; Where is there a table of ZBLL like cases for step 4? Or
        do we have &gt; to make one? I don't really like method 3 on gilles site
        if thats &gt; what youre talking about. But i am in favor of exploring
        the options. &gt; &gt; If all edges are Oriented, then Its just a matter
        of permuting 6 &gt; oriented cubies. That should be able to be done with
        a single &gt; algorithm. How many cases could there possible be? &gt;

        Well, I'm not too ambitious. I hope to be around 16-17 seconds for 3x3x3
        and around 30 for one-handed. Maybe buy a 4x4x4 and do it in less than 5

        &gt; &gt;&gt;Here are my thoughts on possible improvements for step 4
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;keep in mind that I do not claim these ideas
        as my own. &gt; &gt;&gt;I am just organizing some methods. &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;Possible improvements for Step 4 &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;1. Learn COLL in addition to CLL for cases where edges are
        already &gt; &gt;&gt;oriented correctly &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;2.
        Orient Edges 1st and only learn COLL (?_) &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;3.
        If Bottom 2 edges are oriented correctly, and the ledge and redge &gt;
        &gt;&gt;are somewhere in top layer, Then ELL could solve all cases in 1
        &gt; &gt;&gt;Algorithm, leaving you with a 4 move PLL. &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;4. Learn the 8 algorithms in Ming Thai's method. &gt;
        &gt;&gt; FOr cases where a redge or ledge is already in place, you can
        &gt; &gt;&gt;insert final edge and orient midges. I never learned these,
        but they &gt; &gt;&gt; could be useful in certain cases &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Mike- &gt; &gt;&gt;Where is
        there a table of ZBLL like cases for step 4? Or do we have &gt;
        &gt;&gt;to make one? I don't really like method 3 on gilles site if
        thats &gt; &gt;&gt;what youre talking about. But i am in favor of
        exploring the &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;options. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;If all edges are Oriented, then Its just a matter
        of permuting 6 &gt; &gt;&gt;oriented cubies. That should be able to be
        done with a single &gt; &gt;&gt;algorithm. How many cases could there
        possible be? &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Jason Kovacic &gt;

        Goals for RWC 2007: 3x3: I want to be able to average in the 15's. Right
        now I'm using VHF2L and COLL, but I would like it to be more ZBLL by
        then. I would also like to average similarly with the Roux method. 3x3
        OH: It would be nice to be under 40 on average, but I don't know how
        realistic that is because I've never really practiced it much. My
        average at that the last time I checked a few months ago was more like
        1:10. :( 4x4: I want to consistently average under 70 for sure. My best
        times right now are just above that, but my average is still in the
        90's. I need to get better at my method, and maybe learn some more 3
        cycles for directly solving edges. With practice, I think that could be
        fast. 5x5: It would be cool to actually be fast enough to compete at
        that. With the terrible cube I've got with no lube, my best time is
        6:40, but I think I can get my method down to under half of that with a
        good cube and practice. Sub-4 for sure but I'm really shooting for
        sub-3. Square1: I need to find mine in the attic and relearn how to
        solve it. That first part could take the whole two years... Team
        blindfold: I really hope there's an even for this. Heidi and I really
        enjoy it. Plus, we have a way better naming system than Ian does. ;P
        Blindfold: I want to have a successful solve by then instead of just
        DNF's, and I would like to be well under 3 minutes. I just need to
        actually work on it. 2x2: I can do well with my 4x4 scrambled as a 2x2,
        but I don't actually own a decent real 2x2. I should work on that, and
        then get good. -Mike team [zb]

        Well...I've put this off long enough and I Will now chime in with my
        thoughts... LEARN FRIDRICH FULL FRIDRICH!!! Huge goal...obvious goal,
        obviously going to happen within 2 years... 2x2 - Average under 20
        consistently, maybe once I learn Fridrich(and COLL maybe) I'll hit
        sub-10??? 3x3 - With Fridrich, once I get it down, I think I'll be
        sub-20, and with a lot of practice maybe better... 3x3 OH - Again,
        dependant on Fridrich, I've got a decent cube, and i'm not bad at OH, I
        just have a bad method...Aiming for sub-45 average 3x3 Feet - Fridrich,
        Some people are amazed I can get 4:xx.xx with my feet...I'll aim sub-3
        for now...may need to update this later 3x3 BLD - Chris Hardwick, that
        lovely man, is partway through teaching me...I'll learn how to do it,
        then let you know my goals... 4x4 - You know it...Fridrich, and centers
        and pairing up need to be faster, just recognition and and turning
        speed...Aiming for sub-1:30... 5x5 - This is just a matter of time...it
        isn't dependant on Fridrich, I use a version of Per's Method and I
        believe I will someday be able to hit sub-3, but it will take a good
        amount of practice... 6x6 - The forsaken cube...Hopefully top 5...will
        be one of the top cubers for this off the start, may get completely
        destroyed once people get good methods...Sub-10 minute single solve
        within a day...sub-5 final...sub-4 will probably be nearing WR... Magic
        - This is just practice practice practice...I will get near a second
        someday...don't know when...I've got 2 years... Master Magic - I want
        one of the real ones...that are heavy...I love the one I have now (Thank
        you Peter for making it) but...It is a bit light to control, my fault
        because of the tiles I supplied...Aiming around 3 seconds???With my MM,
        maybe sub-3 with a heavy one... Super Magic - I might get one...before
        the end of the year...Bob-Watch out for me on this puzzle... Clock - Get
        a better one...Those of you who have tried my clock understand...and I
        need to get better overall...I am hoping with a new clock average
        sub-12, maybe better Megaminx - Should be getting one within the next
        month, may suck cuz of it's inards but I will talk to Stefan about
        that...really easy puzzle actually...Maybe hit sub-5 once I get and
        practice it... Sqaure-1 - Learn how to do it...I was planning on doing
        it before this WC, but I didn't...really isn't too hard of a puzzle, but
        it looks intimidating, avg-sub-60 on this by 2007... Pyraminx - Use a
        better method than the one I came up with...Avg sub-15 UFO??? This is
        interesting...maybe an event one day???hmmmmmmmm...Soon the world
        championships will have to be a week long event to do all needed events
        and do everyone who wants to compete, or there will be qualifying from
        home countries. Cup-Stacking...Yah yah, not cubing related, but
        still...after trying this at WC I am planning on buying some, mom said
        she'd let me borrow her credit card later...:) I don't focus on any one
        puzzle, I practice everything all the time, and my dad is always telling
        me to practice just one puzzle...but I'm never gunna do that...Any
        questions, you know where to find me...probably forgot something...but
        meh... Craig

        enough and I Will now chime in with my &gt; thoughts... &gt; &gt; LEARN
        FRIDRICH FULL FRIDRICH!!! Huge goal...obvious goal, obviously &gt; going
        to happen within 2 years... &gt; &gt; 2x2 - Average under 20
        consistently, maybe once I learn Fridrich(and &gt; COLL maybe) I'll hit
        sub-10??? &gt; &gt; 3x3 - With Fridrich, once I get it down, I think
        I'll be sub-20, and &gt; with a lot of practice maybe better... &gt;
        &gt; 3x3 OH - Again, dependant on Fridrich, I've got a decent cube, and
        i'm &gt; not bad at OH, I just have a bad method...Aiming for sub-45
        average &gt; &gt; 3x3 Feet - Fridrich, Some people are amazed I can get
        4:xx.xx with my &gt; feet...I'll aim sub-3 for now...may need to update
        this later &gt; &gt; 3x3 BLD - Chris Hardwick, that lovely man, is
        partway through teaching &gt; me...I'll learn how to do it, then let you
        know my goals... &gt; &gt; 4x4 - You know it...Fridrich, and centers and
        pairing up need to be &gt; faster, just recognition and and turning
        speed...Aiming for sub-1:30... &gt; &gt; 5x5 - This is just a matter of
        time...it isn't dependant on Fridrich, &gt; I use a version of Per's
        Method and I believe I will someday be able &gt; to hit sub-3, but it
        will take a good amount of practice... &gt; &gt; 6x6 - The forsaken
        cube...Hopefully top 5...will be one of the top &gt; cubers for this off
        the start, may get completely destroyed once &gt; people get good
        methods...Sub-10 minute single solve within a &gt; day...sub-5
        final...sub-4 will probably be nearing WR... &gt; &gt; Magic - This is
        just practice practice practice...I will get near a &gt; second
        someday...don't know when...I've got 2 years... &gt; &gt; Master Magic -
        I want one of the real ones...that are heavy...I love &gt; the one I
        have now (Thank you Peter for making it) but...It is a bit &gt; light to
        control, my fault because of the tiles I supplied...Aiming &gt; around 3
        seconds???With my MM, maybe sub-3 with a heavy one... &gt; &gt; Super
        Magic - I might get one...before the end of the year...Bob-Watch &gt;
        out for me on this puzzle... &gt; &gt; Clock - Get a better one...Those
        of you who have tried my clock &gt; understand...and I need to get
        better overall...I am hoping with a new &gt; clock average sub-12, maybe
        better &gt; &gt; Megaminx - Should be getting one within the next month,
        may suck cuz &gt; of it's inards but I will talk to Stefan about
        that...really easy &gt; puzzle actually...Maybe hit sub-5 once I get and
        practice it... &gt; &gt; Sqaure-1 - Learn how to do it...I was planning
        on doing it before this &gt; WC, but I didn't...really isn't too hard of
        a puzzle, but it looks &gt; intimidating, avg-sub-60 on this by 2007...
        &gt; &gt; Pyraminx - Use a better method than the one I came up
        with...Avg sub-15 &gt; &gt; UFO??? This is interesting...maybe an event
        one day???hmmmmmmmm...Soon &gt; the world championships will have to be
        a week long event to do all &gt; needed events and do everyone who wants
        to compete, or there will be &gt; qualifying from home countries. &gt;
        &gt; Cup-Stacking...Yah yah, not cubing related, but still...after
        trying &gt; this at WC I am planning on buying some, mom said she'd let
        me borrow &gt; her credit card later...:) &gt; &gt; I don't focus on any
        one puzzle, I practice everything all the time, &gt; and my dad is
        always telling me to practice just one puzzle...but I'm &gt; never gunna
        do that...Any questions, you know where to find &gt; me...probably
        forgot something...but meh... &gt; &gt; Craig &gt;

        Any idea what has changed? Someone once mentioned his plastic washers
        have disappeared over time, are yours still intact? If they're gone and
        the spring is maybe even already eating through the center piece, then
        the tension of course gets weaker cause the spring gets less and less
        compressed. Also, I'm assuming you tried screwing the screw in deeper?

        participate and make it to the finals in every event. Some explicit

        allow it. - Win Megaminx, it's by far the best puzzle and I have no

        another possible thing could be that your graphics card doesnt support

        Well after rwc2005... i'm really inspired to cube better.. i realized
        that i dont practice a lot and that my technique is quite poor. but here
        are my more practical goals -learn to solve BLD and compete in all sizes
        (and finish) -learn OLL, COLL, xcross, opposite cross, perfect my PLL
        algs, get sub 10sec F2L every time -get into big cubes (4x4x4 and up)
        -get into magic, master magic, and super magic, along with OH in all
        -okay, this one is new, but i tried it once and it was fun. OH 4x4x4
        solving. it hurts if you try to do more than one (well, at least for
        me), but its a much more physically challenging puzzle. -3x3x3 OH... get
        better and for the actual competition: -get top 3 for 4x4x4 obviously
        there's more... but homework is calling me :-/ rwc2007... bring it. On

        I want to know how fast some of you can solve the first layer Just the
        white layer, not F2L I think that for 1 layer, solving 4 corners first
        and then doing edges is the way to do it (Waterman Method). Or you could
        do cross and 4 corners, but I think that would be slower. For F2L, 10

        My method for doing this is to put one edge in and then pair up a
        corner-edge pair adjacent to it and work around the FL that way. 16
        moves is a good goal. I really expect with practice that 7 seconds could
        seem quite slow (well I hope so!). Duncan ----- Original Message -----

        &gt; &gt; kovacic81@y... 8.15 on average. Probably a little better when
        I'm mostly awake. I did all of the decent solves cross followed by 4
        corners. I'm sure I'm not doing anything optimally, but I think cross
        first may be fewer moves, especially if you're counting in QTM. The
        worst case scenario for a corner to be in is either in the top layer
        with the bottom side on the U face or in the wrong spot or orientation
        on the first layer. Both of these are easy to fix and generally with two
        generators, which are quite fast. Corners first, you would need to make
        sure to get a good corner case followed by very quick edge placement.
        The worst case scenarios for edges are in the wrong spots and wrongly
        oriented. Granted, you can often fix these with only MUF, but I think
        this is still slower than two generators, no matter how much I like M
        turns. I don't see the usefulness of FL really, because F2L places
        pieces very efficiently. FL places 4 fewer pieces in slightly fewer
        moves and makes it more difficult to actually place those 4 pieces. The
        only way I can think of that FL might be useful is if you solve Roux
        style with the FL as your first 1x2x3, but I think it's hard to solve
        that way quickly and maintain the correct colors for your blocks. -Mike

        Hi! FL (or F1L rather?) is of course useful for beginners who start out
        his/her cubing career by using a very basic layer by layer method. Since
        this step of a very basic method is also supposed to be intuitive
        (unless forcing cross + 4C or something) i consider it important to be
        fast with this step for the overall speed :-) I would say that a
        beginner using a beginners layer by layer method should aim for
        something like the following breakdown: - First layer (FL) : 10-15 secs
        - Middle layer (E-edges) : 15-20 secs - Last layer (4 steps somehow) :
        20-30 secs This makes a total of 45-65 secs for a beginner. I believe
        this is realistic. The faster the recognition the closer to 45 secs one
        should get. With more advanced tricks and combining steps here it's
        possible to move below 30 secs even with pure layer by layer :-) Of
        course only Fnl (fist n layers) practice is *really* useful for the
        nxnxn cube, since there are so many approaches to solving (different
        steps) :-P (Yes it is and isn't a joke ;-) ) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        CHallenge - FL &gt; Hi! &gt; &gt; FL (or F1L rather?) is of course
        useful for beginners who start out &gt; his/her cubing career by using a
        very basic layer by layer method. &gt; Since this step of a very basic
        method is also supposed to be &gt; intuitive (unless forcing cross + 4C
        or something) i consider it &gt; important to be fast with this step for
        the overall speed :-) &gt; &gt; I would say that a beginner using a
        beginners layer by layer method &gt; should aim for something like the
        following breakdown: &gt; &gt; - First layer (FL) : 10-15 secs &gt; -
        Middle layer (E-edges) : 15-20 secs &gt; - Last layer (4 steps somehow)
        : 20-30 secs &gt; &gt; This makes a total of 45-65 secs for a beginner.
        I believe this is &gt; realistic. The faster the recognition the closer
        to 45 secs one &gt; should get. With more advanced tricks and combining
        steps here it's &gt; possible to move below 30 secs even with pure layer
        by layer :-) &gt; &gt; Of course only Fnl (fist n layers) practice is
        *really* useful for &gt; the nxnxn cube, since there are so many
        approaches to solving &gt; (different steps) :-P (Yes it is and isn't a
        joke ;-) ) &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt;&gt; --- In

        Kovacic &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; kovacic81@y... &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 8.15 on
        average. Probably a little better when I'm mostly awake. &gt; I &gt;&gt;
        did all of the decent solves cross followed by 4 corners. &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; I'm sure I'm not doing anything optimally, but I think cross
        first &gt; may &gt;&gt; be fewer moves, especially if you're counting in
        QTM. The worst &gt; case &gt;&gt; scenario for a corner to be in is
        either in the top layer with the &gt;&gt; bottom side on the U face or
        in the wrong spot or orientation on &gt; the &gt;&gt; first layer. Both
        of these are easy to fix and generally with two &gt;&gt; generators,
        which are quite fast. Corners first, you would need to &gt;&gt; make
        sure to get a good corner case followed by very quick edge &gt;&gt;
        placement. The worst case scenarios for edges are in the wrong &gt;
        spots &gt;&gt; and wrongly oriented. Granted, you can often fix these
        with only &gt; MUF, &gt;&gt; but I think this is still slower than two
        generators, no matter how &gt;&gt; much I like M turns. &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; I don't see the usefulness of FL really, because F2L places
        pieces &gt;&gt; very efficiently. FL places 4 fewer pieces in slightly
        fewer moves &gt;&gt; and makes it more difficult to actually place those
        4 pieces. The &gt;&gt; only way I can think of that FL might be useful
        is if you solve &gt; Roux &gt;&gt; style with the FL as your first
        1x2x3, but I think it's hard to &gt; solve &gt;&gt; that way quickly and
        maintain the correct colors for your blocks. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -Mike

        just can't decide which of the two OLLs is better and because you don't
        want to practice one more often than the other, you practice them
        alternatingly. Right? Hey, aren't you embarrassed about your 2.20

        INteresting CHallenge - FL &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        FL (or F1L rather?) is of course useful for beginners who start out &gt;
        &gt; his/her cubing career by using a very basic layer by layer method.
        &gt; &gt; Since this step of a very basic method is also supposed to be
        &gt; &gt; intuitive (unless forcing cross + 4C or something) i consider
        it &gt; &gt; important to be fast with this step for the overall speed
        :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would say that a beginner using a beginners
        layer by layer method &gt; &gt; should aim for something like the
        following breakdown: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - First layer (FL) : 10-15 secs
        &gt; &gt; - Middle layer (E-edges) : 15-20 secs &gt; &gt; - Last layer
        (4 steps somehow) : 20-30 secs &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes a total of
        45-65 secs for a beginner. I believe this is &gt; &gt; realistic. The
        faster the recognition the closer to 45 secs one &gt; &gt; should get.
        With more advanced tricks and combining steps here it's &gt; &gt;
        possible to move below 30 secs even with pure layer by layer :-) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course only Fnl (fist n layers) practice is *really*
        useful for &gt; &gt; the nxnxn cube, since there are so many approaches
        to solving &gt; &gt; (different steps) :-P (Yes it is and isn't a joke
        ;-) ) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; kovacic81@y... &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 8.15 on average.
        Probably a little better when I'm mostly awake. &gt; &gt; I &gt;
        &gt;&gt; did all of the decent solves cross followed by 4 corners. &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I'm sure I'm not doing anything optimally, but I
        think cross first &gt; &gt; may &gt; &gt;&gt; be fewer moves, especially
        if you're counting in QTM. The worst &gt; &gt; case &gt; &gt;&gt;
        scenario for a corner to be in is either in the top layer with the &gt;
        &gt;&gt; bottom side on the U face or in the wrong spot or orientation
        on &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt;&gt; first layer. Both of these are easy to
        fix and generally with two &gt; &gt;&gt; generators, which are quite
        fast. Corners first, you would need to &gt; &gt;&gt; make sure to get a
        good corner case followed by very quick edge &gt; &gt;&gt; placement.
        The worst case scenarios for edges are in the wrong &gt; &gt; spots &gt;
        &gt;&gt; and wrongly oriented. Granted, you can often fix these with
        only &gt; &gt; MUF, &gt; &gt;&gt; but I think this is still slower than
        two generators, no matter how &gt; &gt;&gt; much I like M turns. &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I don't see the usefulness of FL really, because
        F2L places pieces &gt; &gt;&gt; very efficiently. FL places 4 fewer
        pieces in slightly fewer moves &gt; &gt;&gt; and makes it more difficult
        to actually place those 4 pieces. The &gt; &gt;&gt; only way I can think
        of that FL might be useful is if you solve &gt; &gt; Roux &gt; &gt;&gt;
        style with the FL as your first 1x2x3, but I think it's hard to &gt;
        &gt; solve &gt; &gt;&gt; that way quickly and maintain the correct
        colors for your blocks. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; -Mike &gt; &gt;&gt;

        Hi Macky :-) 4.16 secs is extremely fast for F1L ... Did u simply do
        cross pluss 4C ? Or you did F1L completely intuitively (solve what u see
        first) ?? Have fun! -Per PS! Now that you have done this on 3x3x3 try
        the same on 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. If you can do those fast also you qualify

        15-20 secs &gt; &gt; &gt; - Last layer (4 steps somehow) : 20-30 secs
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes a total of 45-65 secs for a
        beginner. I believe this is &gt; &gt; &gt; realistic. The faster the
        recognition the closer to 45 secs one &gt; &gt; &gt; should get. With
        more advanced tricks and combining steps here &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt;
        possible to move below 30 secs even with pure layer by layer :- ) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course only Fnl (fist n layers) practice is
        *really* useful for &gt; &gt; &gt; the nxnxn cube, since there are so
        many approaches to solving &gt; &gt; &gt; (different steps) :-P (Yes it
        is and isn't a joke ;-) ) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt;

        &gt;&gt; 8.15 on average. Probably a little better when I'm mostly
        awake. &gt; &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; did all of the decent solves
        cross followed by 4 corners. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I'm
        sure I'm not doing anything optimally, but I think cross &gt; first &gt;
        &gt; &gt; may &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be fewer moves, especially if you're
        counting in QTM. The worst &gt; &gt; &gt; case &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        scenario for a corner to be in is either in the top layer with &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bottom side on the U face or in the wrong spot or
        orientation on &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; first layer. Both
        of these are easy to fix and generally with &gt; two &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        generators, which are quite fast. Corners first, you would need &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; make sure to get a good corner case followed by very
        quick edge &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; placement. The worst case scenarios for
        edges are in the wrong &gt; &gt; &gt; spots &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and
        wrongly oriented. Granted, you can often fix these with only &gt; &gt;
        &gt; MUF, &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but I think this is still slower than two
        generators, no matter &gt; how &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; much I like M turns.
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I don't see the usefulness of FL
        really, because F2L places &gt; pieces &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; very
        efficiently. FL places 4 fewer pieces in slightly fewer &gt; moves &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; and makes it more difficult to actually place those 4
        pieces. &gt; The &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; only way I can think of that FL
        might be useful is if you solve &gt; &gt; &gt; Roux &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        style with the FL as your first 1x2x3, but I think it's hard to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; solve &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that way quickly and maintain the
        correct colors for your blocks. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

        flip them all (that's the first OLL), then setup the case using the

        then solve using the ZBF2L alg (the rest). I didn't learn the inverse

        Whoa, I really like that algorithm. I can do the mirror quite fast, but
        I was always slower with this case as I did the bulk of it with my left
        hand ¬ñ my slower hand. I am definitely switching to this algorithm.

        &gt; Ok, now the obvious question: How does it compare to Gilles's way?
        &gt; &gt; Both ways first orient all six edges and place the LU and RU
        edges, &gt; but they place them at different places. &gt; &gt; Do we
        know average number of moves for these two methods? &gt; Josef's
        sequences should give you better results. Various ideas about the last 6
        edges and 4 centers: - If you want to solve in less than 12 moves (using
        sequences mostly based on &lt;M, U&gt;), it's extremely difficult
        (impossible?). - With many methods you can average about 15 moves. -
        Josef wanted a 2-look method. In my opinion, it's not quite 2-look,
        because you need to position UL/UR first. - There's another possibility:
        Use standard corner-first strategy that inserts the last L/R-edge and
        orients M-edges, but without taking care of corners positions, and look
        where you are before the last M/M' move (you're in the middle of UL/UR
        insertion after orientation). - After orientation or with Josef's
        technique, instead of solving UL/UR, you can work with UF/UB. Mmmhh..
        no. You could save 2 moves, but it makes recognition much more
        difficult. - With the orientation-first strategy (averaging about 14
        moves), inspection does not take more than 2.3 microseconds. Very few
        things to learn, and you can solve very efficently &gt;70% of cases. Add
        the standard corners-first technique, a few optimizations, and you reach
        90%. Gilles.

        I have sent some recommendations for improving the 5x5x5 cube to
        Seventowns. I am now in a dialogue with Steve Perrin, Director of Design
        and Production at Seventowns. What i have suggested is to modify the
        wings of the outer edges to make the edge-centers glide over them much
        more easily. According to Grant Tregay this fix will make the turning of
        inner layers a whole lot better and still leave the cube fairly tight.
        Anyway, i have tried his modified cube and i must say it was really
        awesome. A tight cube eliminates many other problems, like popping and
        rotation of the corner centers. I have also suggested using machine
        screws and not centers. And i have mentioned the appalling stickers too.
        We will see what comes out of this. I made a diagram (picture) in order
        to show him what the problem is and where to modify the outer edges. If
        anyone wants to see this drop me a private mail and i will send it. On
        popular request i can post it in the photo section also ;-) Cheers! -Per

        corner/edge pairs, followed by U': R [L d2 L', U'] R' U' Replace d2 with
        (U2 y2) and adjust L/R moves: R L U2 R' U' R U2 L' U R' U' And since the

        an F to a U that requires my index finger to get over too far that it
        slows me down at that point. I am experimenting with using my ring

        well... a lot of people cube to trance/techno/electronic type music...
        mainly because the accelerated beats make you want to go faster... but

        Cheers! &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; You can start by changing the M R' at
        the end to an L' ;) Well yeah, I should rewrite the end... but
        differently. Ok, here's what I mainly think so far. First I add a U' to
        make the alg "complete", I want to keep the side effects (on the
        centers) out: M U (R U R' U') M2 (U R U' R') M U' Then rewrite the inner
        part as a commutator: (M U) [R U R' U', M2] (M' U') Actually I have two
        commutators there, the inner one is inside [M,U]. The outer one is a bit
        heavy, but the inner one is easy to understand. So let me build a
        different alg that achieves the same result: (M U) [R' U R U', M2] (M'
        U') Or written out and without the U' at the end: M (U R' U R U') M2 (U
        R' U' R) M Yeah ok, the original was better, (R'M) is nicer than (RM)...
        But about the [M,U] again. The first M "flips" the UB edge, then U
        replaces it by another edge which gets flipped with M', then U' restores
        the corners. Apart from those two flipped edges, two more were
        "flipped", but on the B side. Same game, the M turns flip and the U
        turns replace. A fifth edge was involved, too. To fix the latter three
        edges, the inner commutator is used. Alright, enough with this alg for
        tonight. Cheers! Stefan

        down a time under 5 minutes. I'm consistently in 5:30 range of times for

        an eastsheen cube. I've been consistently in this area for about 3 weeks

        Brand? BRAND?!??!? You young'uns got yerselves too many choices. Why,
        back in my day, we didn't have any stinkin' brands. We had to chisel our

        spit. And they popped on every turn, resulting in a useless pile of

        Steve Perrin, Director of &gt; &gt; &gt; Design and Production at
        Seventowns. What i have suggested is to &gt; &gt; &gt; modify the wings
        of the outer edges to make the edge-centers &gt; glide &gt; &gt; &gt;
        over them much more easily. According to Grant Tregay this fix &gt; will
        &gt; &gt; &gt; make the turning of inner layers a whole lot better and
        still &gt; leave &gt; &gt; &gt; the cube fairly tight. Anyway, i have
        tried his modified cube &gt; and i &gt; &gt; &gt; must say it was really
        awesome. A tight cube eliminates many &gt; other &gt; &gt; &gt;
        problems, like popping and rotation of the corner centers. I &gt; have
        also &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested using machine screws and not centers. And
        i have &gt; mentioned &gt; &gt; &gt; the appalling stickers too. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We will see what comes out of this. I made a
        diagram (picture) in &gt; &gt; &gt; order to show him what the problem
        is and where to modify the &gt; outer &gt; &gt; &gt; edges. If anyone

        Hello Everyone, Please send me CLL Algs! So far, I have looked at
        cubewhiz.com (COLL), speedcubing.com, Masayaki Akimoto's page, Gilles
        Page (of course), and Lars Petrus' site (COLL). I would Ideally like to
        have a bunch to pick from for each case. I want to have a complete set
        of algorithms that I like. With CFOP, I learned a lot of algorithms (for
        OLL and PLL), that I didn't really like and couldn't do fast. I ended up
        having to learn better algs, or just stick with mediocre algs. This time
        around, I want to do it right. Also, a bunch of Algs I have seen for CLL
        are also COLL. Im thinking that there might be shorter sequences for
        each COLL case Ive seen. Edge Orientation is not a factor. Please send
        anything you have to kovacic81@... Thank You Jason Kovacic

        Hi :-) I was in the past inspired to come up with my own term for
        "female guys". Like we have prince and princess, steward and stewardess
        and so on, i came up with the idea that a "female guy" should be a
        *guyess*. I think that term is pretty funny ;-) -Per &gt; --- In

        Hey Joel, I would say not lucky. I mean you planned for every step, and
        had to know about non-matching pairs and Xcross to do it. The more you
        know, the more often you get easy cases for the things you know and can
        get a super nice solve. I'd say non-lucky. My two cents, Chris --- In

        I'm speaking specifically about BLD solving, but... Yesterday I broke my
        PB for BLD solving. I scrambled with NetCube, memorised, solved, and
        looked at the time: 2:24.08. Well, I was pretty happy with that. But,
        during my solve, I had just 2 corners wrongly oriented. So, technically,
        it's a lucky case. But I was thinking: I can be lucky on a
        competition...or not? If Oficcial World Records can contain lucky cases,
        why not UWR can list them? Of course there are cases that are *very*
        lucky, like skipping OLL or PLL, or having no corners or no edges to
        orient (on BLD). But there are cases that are just a bit lucky. So, why
        not listing them? And another thing: how is a case defined as lucky to
        someone who uses Stefan's method? Well, just my humble opinion, but...

        I had an idea about something you could do for UWR, but I don't know if
        it is lucky or not. You know how sometimes someone posts a scramble from
        their 9-12 second solve on speedcubing.com, or someone posts on their
        site "try this scramble, it's fast." Well what if you saved up 13 of
        them, and took an average? You could have 12 extraordinarily easy solves
        (13 if you pop one), that would all be random cases and computer
        scrambled. Would this be against the rules or not? Obviously this is a
        moot point for official competitions, but for the UWP how does this
        work? The reason I ask is that I've actually considered doing this, but
        it just somehow seems like cheating to me. Just curious what others
        think, Chris

        &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt; David J I think most people are answering if the
        scramble is lucky, and not if the solve is lucky ¬ñ which is what Jo√´l
        asked. Of course there is a different way to solve it. If you knew God's
        Algorithm, you would solve every scramble in a lot less moves. If you
        take his scramble and apply a different method to the solution, you will
        get a different result. This is changing the solve portion. I think,
        given the scramble and Jo√´l's solution, I agree with Chris H. It is not
        lucky as he didn't skip an OLL or PLL by chance; he skipped one CE pair
        because he knew what to do to preserve it. Someone that didn't do the
        cross that way may not have saved the CE pair and thus, resulted in a
        longer solution. What was the time, Jo√´l? If I had to guess, I would say
        you did that sub 12? -Dave Campbell

        The thing is that the number of easy solves that are computer generated
        have increased since more and more people solve computer generated
        scrambles and of course, some of them are easy. That's why you now have
        on the UWR Single solve list a list of easy solves done by very fast

        Hey Gilles, I agree that the average record is a much better indicator
        of a cuber's skill. But, my question is, what if you compile the
        scrambles for your average all from super easy solves when other cubers
        provide the scramble? In that case every solve in your average is a
        super easy scramble. Is that a "true" average for a person's abilities?

        Chris, I guess it's not. I mean, if you want to have a perfect idea of

        impossible. So the best answer I can give is : Use a series of computer

        preserve it. &gt; Someone that didn't do the cross that way may not have

        if the scramble is easily solved then lucky solves are more likely. This
        may be more easily seen depending on the solving method used. If a short

        lucky. Regards, David J

        Well, I'm not a probabilites expert, but let's try... You can't have
        just 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 corners correctly (or incorrectly) oriented.
        Always even numbers. So, assuming that the probability of one corner
        being oriented is 1/3, you have 1/9 of probability of having 2 correct
        corners. The probability of having 4 correct ones is 1/81. For 6 correct
        corners is 1/729. And for all 8 corners correct is 1/6561. So, the

        cube. But everyone knows that it's impossible. So the best answer I can
        give is : Use a series of computer generated scrambles to do an average.
        Don't select any that has already be done by someone else. Gilles.
        2005/12/2, cmhardw &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;: &gt; Hey Gilles,
        &gt; &gt; I agree that the average record is a much better indicator of
        a &gt; cuber's skill. &gt; &gt; But, my question is, what if you compile
        the scrambles for your &gt; average all from super easy solves when
        other cubers provide the scramble? &gt; &gt; In that case every solve in
        your average is a super easy scramble. Is &gt; that a "true" average for
        a person's abilities? &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; --- In

        number of easy solves that are computer &gt; &gt; generated have
        increased since more and more people solve computer &gt; &gt; generated
        scrambles and of course, some of them are easy. &gt; &gt; That's why you
        now have on the UWR Single solve list a list of easy &gt; &gt; solves
        done by very fast people. Although this doesn't reflect the &gt; &gt;
        "true value" or "real performance" of a cuber. &gt; &gt; I have had a
        few very easy solves also, some of them under 13 seconds. &gt; &gt;
        Although I'm really not someone who can solve the cube very very fast
        &gt; &gt; (although I start to have more and more sub-10 F2L :D), so I
        really &gt; &gt; can't consider that as a good image of my cubing
        abilities. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's why I don't even look at that UWR
        of single solves. &gt; &gt; I mean it's a good thing to be able to solve
        one cube fast, but I &gt; &gt; definitely prefer to have a 15 sec
        average without any sub-13 than a &gt; &gt; 20 sec average with some
        sub-13 solves.. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now the big question : if you had to
        choose, would you prefer to have &gt; &gt; the single solve of the
        average world record ? :D &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2005/12/2, cmhardw
        &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;: &gt; &gt; &gt; I had an idea about
        something you could do for UWR, but I don't know &gt; &gt; &gt; if it is
        lucky or not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You know how sometimes
        someone posts a scramble from their 9-12 second &gt; &gt; &gt; solve on
        speedcubing.com, or someone posts on their site "try this &gt; &gt; &gt;
        scramble, it's fast." Well what if you saved up 13 of them, and took
        &gt; &gt; &gt; an average? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could have
        12 extraordinarily easy solves (13 if you pop one), &gt; &gt; &gt; that
        would all be random cases and computer scrambled. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Would this be against the rules or not? Obviously this is a
        moot &gt; &gt; &gt; point for official competitions, but for the UWP how
        does this work? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I ask is that
        I've actually considered doing this, but it &gt; &gt; &gt; just somehow
        seems like cheating to me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just curious
        what others think, &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        want it, I'm sure they would be able to charge you so that it covers the

        You can't have 3 corners incorrectly oriented? R U R' U R U2 R' ? Right?
        What I meant about the proportion is that for example, if the average
        number of twisted corners is 6 (which it should be), and you only have
        to twist two of them, if you normally do two at a time, then you are
        saving 67% of your CO step for execution, and then saving an additional

        Oh, btw, the probabilities I posted were wrong...I forgot to consider
        that each corner can be on 8 positions (one at a time, of course). So,
        the correct is: (from Richard Carr's BCFTSS) 0 corners to orient (8
        correct) -&gt; 1/2187 (about 0,046%) 2 corners to orient (6 correct)
        -&gt; 56/2187 (about 2,6%) 3 corners to orient (5 correct) -&gt;
        112/2187 (about 5%) 4 corners to orient (you know) -&gt; 420/2187 (about
        19,2%) 5 corners to orient ( ... ) -&gt; 560/2187 (about 25,6%) 6
        corners to orient ( ... ) -&gt; 616/2187 (about 28,2%) 7 corners to
        orient ( ... ) -&gt; 336/2187 (about 15,4%) 8 corners to orient ( ... )
        -&gt; 86/2187 (about 4%) Well, 2,6% is a low probability, but is just
        for CO, and what this means on the entire solve I don't know... Pedro

        right...hehe...you just can't have 1 corner incorrectly oriented. Well,
        I usually have 4-6 corners to twist.... I'm getting confused...hehe But,
        like I said, and for the people who use Stefan's method? What's a lucky
        case? Pedro Bob Burton &lt;bob@cubewhiz.com&gt; escreveu: You can't have
        3 corners incorrectly oriented? R U R' U R U2 R' ? Right? What I meant
        about the proportion is that for example, if the average number of
        twisted corners is 6 (which it should be), and you only have to twist
        two of them, if you normally do two at a time, then you are saving 67%
        of your CO step for execution, and then saving an additional amount of
        time by memorizing less. I don't use that BLD method, though, so I'm not
        sure if this is right. This is based on what I THINK I know. :) ~ Bob

        assuming that the probability of one corner being oriented is 1/3, you
        have 1/9 of probability of having 2 correct corners. The probability of
        having 4 correct ones is 1/81. For 6 correct corners is 1/729. And for
        all 8 corners correct is 1/6561. So, the probability of having a case
        like I had is 1/729. &gt; I don't know what proportion of the solve it
        saved. People solve the cube BLD differently. I use commutators for

        Hey Gilles, I posted a lot of pictures from the WC a few weeks ago. I
        have a lot of pictures of the stage, and most have competitors in them.
        Go to my website at: http://andyscubepage.tk and on the left, under
        picture links, click on the WC 2005 pictures. I don't think any of them
        are 1024x768, though. Andy

        Ha, I remembered the look and found the program on my computer, had
        installed it a while ago. Thanks for mentioning it, it's great! Stupid
        Windows Movie Maker only jumps in 15 fps steps for 30 fps videos and
        Tmpgenc shows all frames so I can measure more exactly now. I found out
        that my J-perm video was actually 1.20 seconds (in reality probably even
        a bit less) and this T-perm was 1.30 seconds, not 1.33:
        http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/Tperm130.wmv It also loads faster than

        &gt; Stefan You should change the (l'R') at the beginning of your solve
        to x R2. It saves a move and flows a little better. Finish with y R d
        (L'U'L) B' U'(L'U2 L) U M' U2 M' U M u' M' D2 M D2 for a typical end. I
        think the total in STM winds up as 33 that way. Not bad at all. I've
        gotten sub 11 on this solve this way. However, if you finish with y R d
        (L'U'L) B' U'(L'U2 L) U M' U2 M' U, but continue with r R d' M' U2 M' d'
        R2 it's a little easier to perform. I've tried finishing this solve with
        every possible orientation trick and placement trick I know, but I can't
        seem to find anything better than that. :( -Mike team [zb]

        Hey you are not serious are you? Please dont give up on cubing. I am
        sure you must be very desperate right now to improve your times but
        giving up altogether is not the option. Do take a break of a couple of
        weeks and then resume again. I also had many times where i wanted to

        Yeah, I totally agree. I really enjoy solving my eastsheen cube but my
        times just aren't as fast as they are with the rubiks cube (not that
        they're all that fast really... need to work on that) My only issue with
        rubiks is that i need to figure out a way to make it turn better. Mine's
        reall stiff, and when i lubed it last night, it actually seemed to get
        stiffer... anyone know if rubik's 5x5s have screws? Any speed 5x5ers
        have any recommendations on loosening up a rubik's model? ~John~ --- In

        Recemmendations: - Use the cube a lot (im serious, this helps!) - If the
        cube is really tight, wait some weeks (50-100 solves) before lubing for
        the first time. - It is possible to use a flat knife to bend the layers.
        Im very uncertain if this has any effect on the rivets though. -
        Disassemble the cube many times over. I know this helps. It helps
        loosening any puzzle. - Sand down the wings of outer edges, like
        mentioned in my earlier post, and suggested to me by Grant Tregay. Good
        luck ! -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Bah, I feel like nobody even saw my typo-joke :-( Ok, now about lucky
        cases with my method. Well, the rules say: For blindfold solving a lucky
        case is defined by: 1) more than 5 corners are correctly oriented, or 2)
        more than 8 edges are correctly oriented, or 3) more than 3 corners are
        correctly positioned, or 4) more than 4 edges are correctly positioned.
        Obviously the writer didn't know my method :-). I don't consider 1) or
        2) lucky since correct orientation doesn't help me at at all, actually
        "orientation" doesn't even exist for me unless a piece is correctly
        positioned. For 3) and 4) I don't count correctly positioned pieces with
        bad orientation, since these are just as hard as "normal", i.e.
        mispositioned pieces. For me I'd say a lucky case is defined by: 1) more
        than 2 corners are correctly positioned and oriented, or 2) more than 3
        edges are correctly positioned and oriented. Those are the only cases
        that really save work. I lowered the number a bit, though. Not sure
        they're good now, I don't know where the original numbers came from, but
        I think these rules come very close to what it optimally should be.

        To choose the frame rate, just put the "skip amount" bar at the very

        then 00:00:00.050, and so. Pedro Thanks, Stefan

        Hey, I agree, don't give up just because you're improvement has slowed.
        My times were also around 50 seconds for a few months straight. Don't
        get frustrated by the times you see from others, remember that everyone
        used to be at 50 seconds because everyone who can solve it used to not
        be able to solve it. What got me past 50 seconds was learning a better
        method. The method I was using at the time was a beginner method, and I
        switched to a more speedcubing style method. There are lots of methods
        to choose from, all of which are fast, so just find the one you like.
        Don't get frustrated, not everyone who cubes is super fast at improving
        their times. You can get fast times too, just remember that the method
        you use and the finger tricks and styles you use all influence your
        time. If you are already using a speedcubing method framework, try
        learning more algs. All the methods have lots of additional algs you can
        learn that help speed up your times. How do you solve and how many algs
        do you use in general? Try new things, and experiment too. Maybe you'll
        find that you like the 2x2x2, or 4x4x4, or fewest moves cubing more than
        speedcubing. Don't give up though, not everyone improves super quickly.
        It took me over 4 years just to get a sub-20 average, whereas most
        people do it in under a year. We normal people do in fact exist, and I'm
        still convinced that all the others are cubing robots :-) Chris --- In

        This might seem stupid, but my Rubik's 5x5 was put in a cold place just
        after I lubed it. And the result is that it turned a lot more better
        than before. So maybe you could try to lube it and then put it in the
        fridge for the night (I'm serious) Gilles. 2005/12/3, Per Kristen

        Use the cube a lot (im serious, this helps!) &gt; &gt; - If the cube is
        really tight, wait some weeks (50-100 solves) &gt; before lubing for the
        first time. &gt; &gt; - It is possible to use a flat knife to bend the
        layers. Im very &gt; uncertain if this has any effect on the rivets
        though. &gt; &gt; - Disassemble the cube many times over. I know this
        helps. It helps &gt; loosening any puzzle. &gt; &gt; - Sand down the

        This is the definition of a lucky case (according to speedcubing.com) :
        --- A lucky record is any solve of a puzzle where a step of your normal
        solution is skipped. There are three exceptions: 1) You worked for it,
        f.i. by anticipating the next step. 2) The chance to skip the step is 20
        percent or more. 3) The skipped step represents 3 percent or less of the
        total moves of the complete solution. Example: if you use the
        cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system, then there are 7 steps, and skipping one of
        the steps would be a lucky case. For blindfold solving a lucky case is
        defined by: 1) more than 5 corners are correctly oriented, or 2) more
        than 8 edges are correctly oriented, or 3) more than 3 corners are
        correctly positioned, or 4) more than 4 edges are correctly positioned.
        --- So if you do that center cycling intentionally, I would say you are
        in the first exception "You worked for it" = Non-Lucky, even though it's
        contrary to the definition of a lucky case definition for a blindfold
        solve. But that's just my opinion. And talking about lucky cases is just
        silly by the way. I mean you can always win a lottery, but what if you
        can find a way to win all the times ? I'll try not to talk anymore about
        lucky cases. Gilles. 2005/12/3, Pedro &lt;pedrosino1@....br&gt;: &gt;

        Speaking of cool cube locking mechanisms, is it possible to fashion some
        sort of locking mechanism out of a 3x3x3 keychain cube? Or if that would
        require working with pieces that are too small, a regular 3x3x3 cube? I
        just think it would be cool to lock up a cabinet or locker or something
        with a scrambled cube. You could even set the opening combination of the
        lock to a cool pattern, so even people who know how to solve the cube
        can't open it, unless they know which pattern :-) Ok maybe this is a
        little too out there, but I thought it would be cool. Gilles I think
        that is a very cool idea to have a computer logon be solving a cube.
        Perhaps you should set the combination to the superflip or something, so
        you can even trick people who know how to solve the cube ;-) Chris ---

        don't give up just because you're improvement has slowed. My &gt; times

        frustrated by the times you see from others, remember that &gt; everyone
        used to be at 50 seconds because everyone who can solve it &gt; used to
        not be able to solve it. &gt; &gt; What got me past 50 seconds was
        learning a better method. The method &gt; I was using at the time was a
        beginner method, and I switched to a &gt; more speedcubing style method.
        There are lots of methods to choose &gt; from, all of which are fast, so
        just find the one you like. &gt; &gt; Don't get frustrated, not everyone
        who cubes is super fast at &gt; improving their times. You can get fast
        times too, just remember that &gt; the method you use and the finger
        tricks and styles you use all &gt; influence your time. If you are
        already using a speedcubing method &gt; framework, try learning more
        algs. All the methods have lots of &gt; additional algs you can learn
        that help speed up your times. &gt; &gt; How do you solve and how many
        algs do you use in general? &gt; &gt; Try new things, and experiment
        too. Maybe you'll find that you like &gt; the 2x2x2, or 4x4x4, or fewest
        moves cubing more than speedcubing. &gt; &gt; Don't give up though, not
        everyone improves super quickly. It took me &gt; over 4 years just to
        get a sub-20 average, whereas most people do it &gt; in under a year.
        &gt; &gt; We normal people do in fact exist, and I'm still convinced

        Hi Gilles, thanks a lot for the detailed analysis! You should put that
        example (including the scramble) on your website. Haha, I was about to
        say you had no example solves on your site. To be sure I looked closer
        again and found some, but they're hidden and hard to find :-). Also,
        there's no explanation so I'd still recommend putting this one on your
        site. Oh, and can you split the 6x1 block of applets into a 3x2 block?
        At least my browser (Opera) shows them in one long line, widening the
        page and making the texts harder to read cause I have to scroll left and
        right... Cheers! Stefan --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        For the last pair, align BDR with BR (U'), and solve it. The last move

        Comment:At this end of the previous step, before the last x, I've &gt;
        located the positions of UL and UR. In this configuration, do an M' &gt;
        move and 3 wrongly oriented edges will appear on top. Then, I do UMUM
        &gt; and not UMUM' because having both UL and UR in U-layer is not what
        I &gt; want. UMU2M'UM'U2M2 solves UL+UR and permutes M-edges. &gt; &gt;

        Hi Chris, Have a circuit inside the cube which is only completed when
        the cube is in a particular configuration. When it gets there it sends

        Depends on your method, I'd say. If for example you use my method then
        unless those pieces were correctly placed as well, I think it shouldn't
        be considered lucky. If however your method involves first orienting all
        pieces (particularly the corners) then the rules are made for you and
        thus it's a lucky case which you shouldn't post. Similarly in
        speedcubing, what if you're a Fridrich solver and the cross is already
        solved after scrambling? Definitely lucky. The same cube, for a pure
        corners-first solver? Probably not lucky (at least not because of the
        solved cross). It always depends on your method, and also the actual
        solve in case you have choices. Blindsolving 3x3 for example does not
        offer many choices, you almost "read" the solution deterministically,
        and even the choices you make usually don't change the difficulty of the
        solve much. In speedsolving this is more important, since already for
        example how you build the cross has large effects on the rest of the
        solve. Cheers! Stefan

        Hey everyone, I am by no means an expert at the F2L. I think I used to
        average around 11-12 seconds before switching to opposite color + Xcross
        combo solving. Well I took an F2L average tonight and am now sub-10! All
        I changed from my 11-12 second averages was to add in opposite color
        solving. Now I am pretty nearly 1-(1-x)^2 times more likely to get good
        solves (where x is my good solve frequency on one color) as I used to
        be. That is very, very noticeable!! Of course I can't always notice well
        setup Xcross's on my opposite color, but I can always spot a good cross.
        I hope to change that soon with more practice and always spot the good
        opposite color Xcross solves. Anyway here was the average: 11.50, 8.86,
        9.69, 10.18, 10.78, (7.20), 9.41, (12.68), 11.20, 7.94, 9.62, 8.36 =
        9.75 seconds The thing is, I am not a sub-10 F2L solver if I solve the
        same color every time. However, with the combination of opposite color
        as well as Xcross, and not just Xcross, I can now call myself a sub-10
        F2L solver :-) Think what you already sub-10 solvers could do with
        opposite color solving ;-) Chris

        Hi all, The holidays are coming up soon, which means some free time for
        most cubers! With this extra time, not only could we improve ourselves,
        we could teach others how much fun the cube really is. Lets each make a
        goal to teach at least one person to solve the cube before the new year.
        There are plenty of people around us all the time that may be curious
        about the cube, but are too shy or intimidated to ask about it! Happy
        Cubing Always, Richard

        It seems pretty onteresting indeed. I've done 10.42 on average for F2L,
        but my biggest problem is the cross that often takes ~3 seconds. If I
        can choose among two different start I will probably get easy crosses
        and x-crosses much more often, and I think I can lower my avg alot, just

        one place: http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/speedsolving/3x3/ There
        are 2 or 3 that I haven't posted yet, there's a new F perm and the way I
        used to create it might work for your current F perm as well. There are
        also two short Y perms in &lt;U,R,L&gt;, one of them the one I use for
        one-handed cubing. And a short E-perm in &lt;U,R,L,D&gt; which I don't
        use myself but maybe someone else can do it better than me. It's only 14
        quarter turns, that's probably at least shorter than what you use right

        http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/speedsolving/3x3/ &gt; &gt; There
        are 2 or 3 that I haven't posted yet, there's a new F perm and &gt; the
        way I used to create it might work for your current F perm as &gt; well.
        There are also two short Y perms in &lt;U,R,L&gt;, one of them the one
        &gt; I use for one-handed cubing. And a short E-perm in &lt;U,R,L,D&gt;
        which I &gt; don't use myself but maybe someone else can do it better
        than me. It's &gt; only 14 quarter turns, that's probably at least
        shorter than what you &gt; use right now. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan

        Oh ok, I didn't know that X-Cross stood for Extended cross... Thanks,

        for extended cross and means that you build the &gt; cross and the first
        pair in one go. I usually build a 2*2*2 and then &gt; finish with the

        &lt;gunkr520@s...&gt;: &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems pretty onteresting
        indeed. I've done 10.42 on average &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L, but my
        biggest problem is the cross that often takes ~3 &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds.
        If I can choose among two different start I will &gt; probably &gt; &gt;
        &gt; get easy crosses and x-crosses much more often, and I think I can
        &gt; &gt; &gt; lower my avg alot, just like you Chris. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey everyone, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am by no means an expert at the F2L. I
        think I used to &gt; average &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around 11-12
        seconds before switching to opposite color + &gt; Xcross &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; combo &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solving. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well I took an F2L average tonight and am now
        sub-10! All I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changed &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from
        my 11-12 second averages was to add in opposite color &gt; &gt; &gt;
        solving. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I am
        pretty nearly 1-(1-x)^2 times more likely to get &gt; good &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; solves &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (where x is my good solve
        frequency on one color) as I used &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; be. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; That is very, very noticeable!! Of course I can't always
        &gt; notice &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setup
        Xcross's on my opposite color, but I can always spot a &gt; good &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cross. I hope to change that soon with more practice
        and &gt; always &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spot &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        good opposite color Xcross solves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway here was the average: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        11.50, 8.86, 9.69, 10.18, 10.78, (7.20), 9.41, (12.68), &gt; 11.20, &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 7.94, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9.62, 8.36 = 9.75 seconds
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The thing is, I am not
        a sub-10 F2L solver if I solve the &gt; same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; color
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every time. However, with the combination of
        opposite color &gt; as &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        as Xcross, and not just Xcross, I can now call myself a sub- &gt; 10
        &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solver :-) &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think what you already sub-10 solvers
        could do with opposite &gt; &gt; &gt; color &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        For F2L start off by learning all the cases. You should be able to
        instantly know what to do for each case. It's all about PRACTICE. A LOT.
        I estimate that I solve the cube more than 50 times every day. I don't
        time every solve, but I'm always trying to look ahead during F2L.
        Practice in ~80% of your maximum speed and you'll soon be able to
        increase speed and still look ahead. /Gunnar --- In

        Hi :-) It could be that im stupid ;-) But what is really the difference
        between multi-cross solving and the old discussion about whether to
        solve with the cross on same face (same color) or not ?? When it comes
        to it, you choose ONE cross that you solve first, and that's it! Having
        to consider too many possible cross-starts, doesn't that make it
        impossible to use the 15 secs beyond simply study how to do the cross.
        Choosing a cross early (fixed color) it is possible to use the 15 secs
        seeing beyond the cross i guess. By the way, im not a fridrich/cross
        solver ;-) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am by no means an expert at the F2L. I
        think I used to average &gt; &gt; &gt; around 11-12 seconds before

        solving. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well I took an F2L average
        tonight and am now sub-10! All I &gt; &gt; changed &gt; &gt; &gt; from
        my 11-12 second averages was to add in opposite color &gt; solving. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I am pretty nearly 1-(1-x)^2 times more
        likely to get good &gt; &gt; solves &gt; &gt; &gt; (where x is my good
        solve frequency on one color) as I used to &gt; be. &gt; &gt; &gt; That
        is very, very noticeable!! Of course I can't always notice &gt; &gt;
        well &gt; &gt; &gt; setup Xcross's on my opposite color, but I can
        always spot a good &gt; &gt; &gt; cross. I hope to change that soon with
        more practice and always &gt; &gt; spot &gt; &gt; &gt; the good opposite
        color Xcross solves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway here was the
        average: &gt; &gt; &gt; 11.50, 8.86, 9.69, 10.18, 10.78, (7.20), 9.41,
        (12.68), 11.20, &gt; &gt; 7.94, &gt; &gt; &gt; 9.62, 8.36 = 9.75 seconds
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The thing is, I am not a sub-10 F2L solver
        if I solve the same &gt; &gt; color &gt; &gt; &gt; every time. However,
        with the combination of opposite color as &gt; &gt; well &gt; &gt; &gt;
        as Xcross, and not just Xcross, I can now call myself a sub-10 &gt; F2L
        &gt; &gt; &gt; solver :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think what you
        already sub-10 solvers could do with opposite &gt; color &gt; &gt; &gt;
        solving ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hey Per, I've noticed that I can get a "feel" for whether white is good
        or bad. Basically I've been solving white for years so my strategy for a
        while (which I'm trying to change) is to examine white first. If white
        is "bad" I then examine yellow. What I've been working on lately is
        taking a quick scan of both sides (1-2 seconds) and seeing a) are there
        any blocks for an Xcross and b) is this color "good" or "bad"? I then
        always choose the best cross or if I see a block or two with a promising
        setup for an Xcross on either color I choose that one. I've actually
        been training myself for a while to not use the full inspection time, so
        that in a competition 15 seconds will seem like a LOT. I try to always
        inspect and put the cube down in 6-7 seconds or less. So now when I use
        all 15 it's like 2 inspections for me, and is enough time to look at
        both white and yellow. Basically if you get yourself used to inspecting
        very quickly, then 15 seconds will actually feel like a lot, and you can
        definitely inspect two colors during that time. But again that takes
        practice to get used to inspecting in 6-7 every time. Chris --- In

        x-cross stnads for extended cross and means that you build the &gt; &gt;
        cross and the first pair in one go. I usually build a 2*2*2 and then
        &gt; &gt; finish with the two last edges while I'm looking for pair #2.

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is very, very noticeable!! Of course

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7.94, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9.62, 8.36
        = 9.75 seconds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; The thing is, I am not a sub-10 F2L solver if I solve the &gt; &gt;
        same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; color &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every
        time. However, with the combination of opposite color &gt; &gt; as &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as Xcross, and
        not just Xcross, I can now call myself a sub- &gt; &gt; 10 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; F2L &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solver :-) &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think what you already
        sub-10 solvers could do with opposite &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; color &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solving ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I think as long as people know what you're talking about then whatever
        name you call it works for me ;-) I guess I'm personally partial to
        "extended cross" since that's just what I've always called it. I did
        think about calling it some sort of "fish" name when I first posted
        about it though (since it does look like a fish), but thought extended
        cross sounded more "official" :-P Chris --- In

        Hey ppl. Why does everyone have to ues the flv formats? Why not just
        post the video files for download so that they can be available offline?
        ofcourse i do keep them offline, but just i need to spend some extra
        time on that. But for others who dont know some comp stuff, they are in
        trouble. So plz ppl keep the video files free for download. Or maybe
        i'll write a tutorial for the real n00bs as to how to download the flv

      <strong> 9440. 20x20 supercube method </strong>

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi all, It's been long enough since I solved the 20x20 supercube that
        I'm wanting to solve it again. (Yes I did say before that my first solve
        would be my last...I guess I lied) Hopefully this time I do better than
        19+ hours. Lately I've just been trying to get better at solving the
        first center, and I think soon I will be sub-20(minutes) on that. I
        think after applying some new tricks and achieving better efficiency ~15
        minutes on average for the first center will be possible. The opposite
        center is kind of a pain honestly. I haven't dedicated much work to
        this, but my current method is building vertical rows in the middle
        layer and inserting them on their target side. There must be a better
        way. For the 3rd and 4th center I use the same method as I just
        mentioned,, but with horizontal rows. This also tends to be painfully
        slow, but not as bad as the 2nd center, as I know all my pieces will be
        in the middle layer. Of course as I move on finding pieces is easier.
        The 5th and 6th center are kind of a pain. As I seperate the two in the
        middle layer, I direct solve one, and leave the other in chaos to be
        fixed later. Surely there's a way to direct solve both? This would
        probably save 45-60 minutes(!) as cycling centers on a single face takes
        much too long. Keep in mind this is cycling 3 centers at once...I'm not
        Per who'd probably just solve the last center in one go..:P (Just
        kidding Per...I know you're human...two algs to fix right? ;) Seriously
        though, there is a lot of time lost here so any suggestions would be
        welcome Initially I was solving the 6th center very last, so I could use
        it as a breaking ground for my parity algs, which mess with the center
        it's applied over. If I do learn a way of solving the 5th and 6th center
        together, I'm going to need center preserving parity algs. Doug Li found
        a couple for me, but I've lost them since then (sorry Doug!) Everything
        from this point on would be standard. Supercubing doesn't mess up edge
        pairing approaches and solving as a 3x3 isn't too difficult. For those
        of you who will help me, thanks in advance. For those of you who don't
        like supercubing...sorry for the post :P Happy Cubing -Richard

        This is really impressive Bob, I admire all the people who want to try
        the ZB Adventure. I've tried to learn some ZB LL cases but at the moment
        I don't really find any improvement for me. As I am very bad at
        recognition for special cases. (8 seconds to recognise and execute 2
        algs for the LL is really really bad), I don't think that recognisiong a
        ZB case will be any easier. + I still see all the possible improvements
        I can do on how I use the Fridrich Method (more fluency, faster
        execution of OLL and PLL, faster recognition for the OLL and PLL,
        X-Cross, ...) Really, ZB is not for me. And btw, congratulations for
        your improvements on your times thx to ZB :-) Gilles. 2005/12/5, Bob
        Burton &lt;bob@...&gt;: &gt; Hey all, &gt; &gt; I posted a page that
        lists the ZBF2L algorithms I have learned in &gt; fingertrick notation

        through ZBF2L, only about 150 algs to go! ;) I will add more &gt;

        Mmm.. The concept of "round numbers" may not be a good thing, but we
        must admit that most of the people use that idea. So when you say to
        someone that you can solve it just in 3 seconds (whatever the puzzle

        Hi Stefan ! Im trying to understand ur way of thinking but i think u are
        seriously mistaken. If u talk about rounding off errors that's another
        matter. The concept of integers is well founded in maths and in reality.
        U can indeed have exactly 10 stones or 42 apples or whatever. Measuring
        10 seconds (10.00) on a computer won't mean that we know that there are
        infinitely many 0's after the comma. But noone says it does mean so
        either ;-) It is just the human mind that wants to simplify and say: hey
        10.00 that's *exactly* 10 (the natural number 10). Oh well, this has

        Leyan and my brother, Toby do it as well. My brother and I developed it
        as a result of not knowing what we were doing. We were very early in the
        speedcubing learning process and we were using Fridrich's site which
        gives algorithms for cross on top. The most natural translation of those
        algorithms was cross on left. If we had started off we Macky's site, we
        might all be cross on bottom cubers now. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        I actually switch around, cross on bottom and on left, depending on
        either (1) the F2L case, because sometimes I can execute the cross on
        bottom alg faster than the cross on left alg, or (2) how I end up
        holding the cube after solving a CE pair. I try not to waste time
        repositioning my grip when I don't have to. I would say that about
        60-70% of the time, I am using cross on left algs, though. Leyan Tyson

        Hi Per, no, the point is that a number and a representation of a number
        are not the same. You can't even write down or tell me a number - at
        all! Only a representation of the number you mean. For example, you
        write "10 seconds" and I can only *assume* that you mean "ten seconds",
        but maybe you're talking binary and mean "two seconds"? The
        *representation* of a number can look "round", never the number itself.
        Firstly because it doesn't look at all, and secondly because in
        different representations it can look differently. In some of them it
        might look "round", in others not. Got it now? Distinguish between
        numbers and their representations, that's all. Cheers! Stefan P.S. Even
        saying "two" or "ten" is not much better than "2" or "10", since maybe
        the word "two" means a different number for you than it does for me. Or
        if you're a weird alien from Mars and use the same notation as we humans
        but with the digit symbols '0' and '7' swapped, then "3.00" will not
        look round for you because it'll look to you like "3.77" looks to us
        which we wouldn't call "round". --- In

        &gt; these don't even exist. For example, you might consider "10.00" to
        &gt; be &gt; &gt; a round number, but that's not really the number, only
        one out of &gt; &gt; infinitely many representations of it. In binary it
        would already &gt; look &gt; &gt; like "1010" and just imagine what
        happens if you take for example &gt; Pi &gt; &gt; as base. Or the
        representation where you'd write "XXXXXXXXXX", &gt; which &gt; &gt;
        doesn't look any rounder than "XXXXXXXXX". Or... etc. Not even 0 &gt;
        &gt; (zero), which looks the same and "round" in many used &gt;
        representations, &gt; &gt; looks like a round number anymore when I
        represent numbers by &gt; writing &gt; &gt; them the "normal" way after

        long enough since I solved the 20x20 supercube that I'm &gt; wanting to

        my last...I guess I lied) Hopefully this time I do better &gt; than 19+
        hours. &gt; &gt; Lately I've just been trying to get better at solving
        the first &gt; center, and I think soon I will be sub-20(minutes) on
        that. I think &gt; after applying some new tricks and achieving better
        efficiency ~15 &gt; minutes on average for the first center will be
        possible. &gt; &gt; The opposite center is kind of a pain honestly. I
        haven't dedicated &gt; much work to this, but my current method is
        building vertical rows in &gt; the middle layer and inserting them on
        their target side. There must &gt; be a better way. &gt; &gt; For the
        3rd and 4th center I use the same method as I just &gt; mentioned,, but
        with horizontal rows. This also tends to be &gt; painfully slow, but not
        as bad as the 2nd center, as I know all my &gt; pieces will be in the
        middle layer. Of course as I move on finding &gt; pieces is easier. &gt;
        &gt; The 5th and 6th center are kind of a pain. As I seperate the two in
        &gt; the middle layer, I direct solve one, and leave the other in chaos
        to &gt; be fixed later. Surely there's a way to direct solve both? This
        &gt; would probably save 45-60 minutes(!) as cycling centers on a single
        &gt; face takes much too long. Keep in mind this is cycling 3 centers at
        &gt; once...I'm not Per who'd probably just solve the last center in one
        &gt; go..:P (Just kidding Per...I know you're human...two algs to fix
        &gt; right? ;) Seriously though, there is a lot of time lost here so any
        &gt; suggestions would be welcome &gt; &gt; Initially I was solving the
        6th center very last, so I could use it &gt; as a breaking ground for my
        parity algs, which mess with the center &gt; it's applied over. If I do
        learn a way of solving the 5th and 6th &gt; center together, I'm going
        to need center preserving parity algs. &gt; Doug Li found a couple for
        me, but I've lost them since then (sorry &gt; Doug!) &gt; &gt;
        Everything from this point on would be standard. Supercubing doesn't
        &gt; mess up edge pairing approaches and solving as a 3x3 isn't too &gt;
        difficult. For those of you who will help me, thanks in advance. &gt;

        When I solve it in 18 seconds, it doesn't feel that fast. But if I watch

        As for Ron, hes fast of course, but when i saw him solve in person, i
        noticed that hes very consistent with his speed...there were almost no
        lockups during all of his solves. Maybe he has a lot of practice looking

        Hello Everyone What is a good Avg for Last Layer? I took an avg today
        for step 4 of Gilles MEthod. I haven't cubed a lot this week, but I did
        pretty well. (2.98), 3.39, 4.98, 5.78, 7.48, 6.58, 6.67, 3.53, 7.50,
        5.34, (12.18), 7.48 Step 4 Avg 5.87 sec This step is kind of like
        OLL/PLL. First you Orient 6 edges, then Permute 6 edges. Step 4 averages
        only 15 moves, but there are a lot of slice moves. If you can avg 3
        moves a sec, you can do step 4 in about 5 seconds. CFOP Cross - 7 moves
        CE Pair - 7 moves CE Pair - 7 moves CE Pair - 7 moves CE Pair - 7 moves
        OLL - ? PLL - ? ROUX B1 - 9 moves B2 - 16 moves (2 for DR edge and 7 for
        each CE pair) CLL - ? Step 4 - 15 moves So F2L is about 35 moves (11.67
        sec at 3 moves/sec) and F2B is about 25 moves (8.33 sec at 3
        moves/sec)(10 sec at 2.5 moves/sec) Step 4 is about 15 moves (5 sec at 3
        moves/sec)(6 sec at 2.5 moves/sec) I think due to slice moves it's hard
        to do 3 moves/sec for Step 4, so 2.5 moves/sec is a better estimate.
        Todays avg of 5.87sec would be 2.56 moves/sec. What are the HTM averages
        for OLL and PLL? WHat about COLL and CLL? CLL must be less.. And What is
        a good Last Layer Time Average? Thank you Jason Kovacic kovacic81@...

        Hi Per, &gt; no, the point is that a number and a representation of a
        number &gt; are &gt; not the same. You can't even write down or tell me
        a number - at &gt; all! &gt; Only a representation of the number you
        mean. For example, you &gt; write &gt; "10 seconds" and I can only
        *assume* that you mean "ten &gt; seconds", but &gt; maybe you're talking
        binary and mean "two seconds"? The &gt; *representation* of a number can
        look "round", never the number &gt; itself. Firstly because it doesn't
        look at all, and secondly &gt; because &gt; in different representations
        it can look differently. In some of &gt; them &gt; it might look
        "round", in others not. Got it now? Distinguish &gt; between &gt;
        numbers and their representations, that's all. &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan
        &gt; P.S. Even saying "two" or "ten" is not much better than "2" or &gt;
        "10", &gt; since maybe the word "two" means a different number for you
        than &gt; it &gt; does for me. Or if you're a weird alien from Mars and
        use the &gt; same &gt; notation as we humans but with the digit symbols
        '0' and '7' &gt; swapped, &gt; then "3.00" will not look round for you
        because it'll look to &gt; you like &gt; "3.77" looks to us which we
        wouldn't call "round". &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Im trying to understand ur way of thinking but i
        think u are &gt; &gt; seriously mistaken. If u talk about rounding off
        errors that's &gt; &gt; another matter. The concept of integers is well
        founded in &gt; maths and &gt; &gt; in reality. U can indeed have
        exactly 10 stones or 42 apples &gt; or &gt; &gt; whatever. Measuring 10
        seconds (10.00) on a computer won't &gt; mean that &gt; &gt; we know
        that there are infinitely many 0's after the comma. &gt; But &gt; &gt;
        noone says it does mean so either ;-) It is just the human &gt; mind
        that &gt; &gt; wants to simplify and say: hey 10.00 that's *exactly* 10
        (the &gt; &gt; natural number 10). Oh well, this has nothing whatsoever
        to do &gt; with &gt; &gt; cubing ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry guys ...

        in &gt; my &gt; &gt; opinion &gt; &gt; &gt; these don't even exist. For
        example, you might consider &gt; "10.00" to &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt;
        a round number, but that's not really the number, only one &gt; out of
        &gt; &gt; &gt; infinitely many representations of it. In binary it would
        &gt; already &gt; &gt; look &gt; &gt; &gt; like "1010" and just imagine
        what happens if you take for &gt; example &gt; &gt; Pi &gt; &gt; &gt; as
        base. Or the representation where you'd write &gt; "XXXXXXXXXX", &gt;
        &gt; which &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't look any rounder than "XXXXXXXXX".
        Or... etc. Not &gt; even 0 &gt; &gt; &gt; (zero), which looks the same
        and "round" in many used &gt; &gt; representations, &gt; &gt; &gt; looks

        Hi! I must say that I also admire Ron for his way of solving the cube. I
        remember one solve he did during practice on the german cube day, which
        was sub-12. I was so amazed with his fluent moves and asked if it was
        non-lucky which it was. I'm practicing myself on looking ahead during
        F2L, and it's starting to give results. My average as know 17.20 but I
        feel that I can cut of at least one second more if I turn the cube as
        fluent as Ron. /Gunnar --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        person, i &gt; noticed that hes very consistent with his speed...there
        were almost no &gt; lockups during all of his solves. Maybe he has a lot
        of practice &gt; looking ahead and that helps him a lot. Also knowing
        all the OLL and &gt; Pll algs also helps :) &gt; &gt; Sachin.

        &gt; So F2L is about 35 moves (11.67 sec at 3 moves/sec) &gt; and F2B is
        about 25 moves (8.33 sec at 3 moves/sec)(10 sec at 2.5 &gt; moves/sec)
        &gt; &gt; Step 4 is about 15 moves (5 sec at 3 moves/sec)(6 sec at 2.5
        moves/sec) &gt; &gt; I think due to slice moves it's hard to do 3
        moves/sec for Step 4, so &gt; 2.5 moves/sec is a better estimate. &gt;
        Todays avg of 5.87sec would be 2.56 moves/sec. &gt; &gt; &gt; What are

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Im trying to understand ur way of thinking but i
        think u are &gt; &gt; seriously mistaken. If u talk about rounding off
        errors that's &gt; &gt; another matter. The concept of integers is well
        founded in &gt; maths and &gt; &gt; in reality. U can indeed have
        exactly 10 stones or 42 apples &gt; or &gt; &gt; whatever. Measuring 10
        seconds (10.00) on a computer won't &gt; mean that &gt; &gt; we know
        that there are infinitely many 0's after the comma. &gt; But &gt; &gt;
        noone says it does mean so either ;-) It is just the human &gt; mind
        that &gt; &gt; wants to simplify and say: hey 10.00 that's *exactly* 10
        (the &gt; &gt; natural number 10). Oh well, this has nothing whatsoever
        to do &gt; with &gt; &gt; cubing ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry guys ...

        &gt; &gt; Round numbers are just there to bother you. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; The whole concept of "round numbers" is flawed already,
        in &gt; my &gt; &gt; opinion &gt; &gt; &gt; these don't even exist. For
        example, you might consider &gt; "10.00" to &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt;
        a round number, but that's not really the number, only one &gt; out of
        &gt; &gt; &gt; infinitely many representations of it. In binary it would
        &gt; already &gt; &gt; look &gt; &gt; &gt; like "1010" and just imagine
        what happens if you take for &gt; example &gt; &gt; Pi &gt; &gt; &gt; as
        base. Or the representation where you'd write &gt; "XXXXXXXXXX", &gt;
        &gt; which &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't look any rounder than "XXXXXXXXX".
        Or... etc. Not &gt; even 0 &gt; &gt; &gt; (zero), which looks the same
        and "round" in many used &gt; &gt; representations, &gt; &gt; &gt; looks
        like a round number anymore when I represent numbers &gt; by &gt; &gt;
        writing &gt; &gt; &gt; them the "normal" way after subtracting 42. &gt;

        &gt; I took an avg today for step 4 of Gilles MEthod. I haven't cubed a
        &gt; lot this week, but I did pretty well. &gt; &gt; (2.98), 3.39, 4.98,
        5.78, 7.48, 6.58, 6.67, 3.53, 7.50, 5.34, (12.18), &gt; 7.48 Step 4 Avg
        5.87 sec Did you account for recognition in this average? If so, how did
        you do so? How did you time yourself, also? &gt; &gt; This step is kind
        of like OLL/PLL. First you Orient 6 edges, then &gt; Permute 6 edges.
        Step 4 averages only 15 moves, but there are a lot &gt; of slice moves.
        If you can avg 3 moves a sec, you can do step 4 in &gt; about 5 seconds.
        But in OLL you orient EIGHT pieces and then in PLL you permute EIGHT
        pieces, so it seems to me you are doing 33% more work, right? Wouldn't
        that make Step 4 a little less equivalent to OLL/PLL? Even if you took a
        CLL -&gt; ELL approach (which is equivalent to OLL/PLL in number of
        moves and in speed), then in the first step you are orienting AND
        permuting 4 pieces and then doing the same in the second step. It seems
        to me that no matter what, the last 6 edges should be faster than
        OLL/PLL. &gt; CFOP &gt; Cross - 7 moves &gt; CE Pair - 7 moves &gt; CE
        Pair - 7 moves &gt; CE Pair - 7 moves &gt; CE Pair - 7 moves &gt; OLL -
        ? &gt; PLL - ? Well, that's not really fair. The average F2L is
        approximately 30 moves for a good speedcuber. I think my average for F2L
        may actually be around 28-29 moves. The cross average should only be 6,
        but who doesn't use open slots, especially for the first couple pairs? I
        think 30 moves is a much more accurate representation. OLL averages are
        about 9 moves and PLL I believe is about 14 moves. That makes for
        approximately 51-53 moves for CFOP. &gt; ROUX &gt; B1 - 9 moves &gt; B2
        - 16 moves (2 for DR edge and 7 for each CE pair) &gt; CLL - ? &gt; Step
        4 - 15 moves I think CLL is about 9 moves on average. This makes a total
        of about 49 or so moves. &gt; So F2L is about 35 moves (11.67 sec at 3
        moves/sec) &gt; and F2B is about 25 moves (8.33 sec at 3 moves/sec)(10
        sec at 2.5 &gt; moves/sec) Again, I think 35 moves for F2L average is
        way too high. &gt; Step 4 is about 15 moves (5 sec at 3 moves/sec)(6 sec
        at 2.5 moves/sec) &gt; &gt; I think due to slice moves it's hard to do 3
        moves/sec for Step 4, so &gt; 2.5 moves/sec is a better estimate. &gt;
        Todays avg of 5.87sec would be 2.56 moves/sec. &gt; What are the HTM
        averages for OLL and PLL? I believe 9 and 14 moves (approximately). &gt;
        WHat about COLL and CLL? CLL must be less.. CLL should be around 9 moves
        and COLL probably around 12 or so. &gt; And What is a good Last Layer
        Time Average? That depends on what you consider good. I think some of
        the faster guys have a LL around 4-5 seconds. I belive mine is about 5-6
        seconds, slightly faster on a good day. When I set my sub-20 average, my
        F2L average was about 15 seconds, so I probably cut a bit of time off at
        the F2L and had a really good LL. My fastest time was 13.34, but I doubt
        I've ever had a sub-10 F2L solve. ;) ~ Bob

        Well, if I learn 48 ZBLL algs, then my fastest non-lucky LL would

        Well, I used a stackmat but I was holding the cube in my hands when I
        started. I started turning the cube directly after lifting my hands from
        the stackmat. I did this because I wanted to time only the execution.
        Where can I find a list of those PLL-attributes. I have no idea which

        Hello Again To answer your questions Bob, I do preinspect, but only for
        2 sec, as it only takes a fraction of a second to recognize the
        orientation case for step 4. You can see all 6 edges when you're doing
        step 3, so It's like preinspection anyway. In addition to that I always
        align my centers prior to doing step 3. I use a stackmat, cube on the
        mat, hands on the "hand things." Just like a normal solve F2L I thought
        that 35 was a good number to aim for. Thats what I had heard . But 30 is
        an Ok number. CROSS 6 moves CE Pair 6 moves each So in Theory So F2L at
        3moves/s is 10 sec and F2B at 3 moves/s is 8.33 sec OLL PLL If OLL is 9
        moves and PLL is 14 moves, then it is a 23 move avg for LL. So to be Sub
        6, you need 4 moves/sec. The point I was trying to make is that even
        turning the cube at a rate of 2.5 moves/sec, you can do Step 4 in sub 6.
        At 4 moves/sec, step 4 is sub 4 (3.75). I don't see how 4 moves/sec is
        possible with slice moves though. =( Try doing M U M U' 10 times in 10
        seconds. Tough Stuff. Jason Kovacic

        M U'. M' turns are much faster. I can average under 8 seconds for M' U
        M' U'. I can also average under 9 for M' U M U', which seems a little

        turn algs are incredibly fast. That's one of the reasons his method is
        so quick. I'd really like to find out how many cases there are, and the

        What are some other peoples averages for this step? I think a sub 6 avg
        is pretty good. But If you do the math, I'm only cubing at 2.5
        moves/sec. With 4 moves/sec you could make this sub 4. The recogintion
        time is nothing once orientation is done. 5.87 avg 15 move avg 2.56
        moves/sec Recently I have been using My Left ring finger for M'. I think
        that it is defenitely quicker. (M'U2M') is pretty fast (PLL).
        (M'U2M'U2)(M'UM') is also fast (4 bad Edges on top) I always forget
        though. I used corners 1st 10 years ago, and have been doing rR' and Rr'
        forever. I use r2R2 for M2 90% of the time. With my Ring finger I use 2
        movements of the finger to do it, like doing M'M'. It seems to me that
        using your ring finger, only sequences w/o M are good. Jason Kovacic

        This is how I do Step 4 1. Orient all 6 edges and pair up ledge and
        redge in DF and DB. 2. Do a U adjustment and Throw in the pair. Do your
        4 move PLL. 2. is usually 7 moves. The 2nd part is basically the 2nd
        table on Joseph's site about 6 edge solving. I think the 1st Table is
        the same as 1. but center orientation is not a factor. I always put
        either the red or orange center on top. I always do it this way, unless
        after orientation, there is a ledge or redge in place. Or if yellow is
        in whites place or vice versa. I don't know if a ZB like table is worth
        doing. The whole step is only about 15 moves, and very intuitive.
        However, PLL skips are nice, and somewhat frequent. I think that
        avoiding PLL everytime is possible somehow... jason k

        4 moves/sec you could make this sub 4. The recogintion time is &gt;

        M'. I think that it &gt; is defenitely quicker. &gt; (M'U2M') is pretty
        fast (PLL). &gt; (M'U2M'U2)(M'UM') is also fast (4 bad Edges on top)
        &gt; &gt; I always forget though. I used corners 1st 10 years ago, and
        have &gt; been doing rR' and Rr' forever. I use r2R2 for M2 90% of the
        time. &gt; With my Ring finger I use 2 movements of the finger to do it,
        like &gt; doing M'M'. It seems to me that using your ring finger, only
        &gt; sequences w/o M are good. &gt; &gt; Jason Kovacic First 12 solves I
        tried, I wound up with a 6.01 average for the step. My best was a 3.30
        and worst was 8.55. It should have been about half that, but I locked up
        badly. Average number of moves was 13. The 3.30 case was one with
        correct orientation. Are the odds of this 1/28? Is there any way to try
        to help this at an earlier stage? I think learning all of the algs to
        simultaneously permute the final 6 edges once oriented would be a good
        idea. It should be &lt;30. These ought to all be fast cases, using
        primarily M and U turns. You could use them after you orient the edges,
        or on the chance of an O6E skip. I would also advise learning the ELL
        algs, in the event that the F2L is completed after Step 3. This gives
        you a total alg count of something like 100. Not bad. Another idea that
        might help ease the L6E is to try to preserve correct orientation by
        using COLL algs, and to try to change bad orientation using CLL algs.
        You can get from most possible orientation cases to the 3 incorrect
        edges on top configuration or the correct orientation using COLL, or a
        CLL alg that flips DF and UL or R , and one for DF and UF. DF and UB
        would be unnecessary, because you could just do d2 and perform the DF
        and UF alg. Of course, this now gives us something like 160 algs for
        Step 3, instead of the normal 40, bringing the total alg number closer
        to 200. However, we would get correct or nearly correct edge orientation
        25/28 of the time. This is where the single alg to place edges would
        come in very handy. For the other three cases (where an opposite pair of
        edges on U or D are incorrect), you could attempt to change the
        orientation, and then apply an alg, or just leave them and know ahead of
        time what you will get. You could also try using algs for the UD+DF
        cases that leave the UB and UF pieces where they are, so that you could
        do an M, followed by the UD+DF alg, and finish with another M. Of
        course, this is a far cry from the normal 50 or so algs this method
        uses, or even the 78 from CFOP. But it's still a much more sane number
        than the 797 for ZB. I can't find any way to help towards P6E skips yet,
        but I'll keep at it. -Mike

        Hi All - I'm in the process of switching my 4-look LL order from: OE
        (Orient Edges) / PC (Permute Corners) / OC (Orient Corners) / PE
        (Permute Edges) to: OE / OC / PC / PE As I work through it, I'm finding
        that I'm getting more "lucky" solves, where I end up skipping one of the
        above steps. Thinking about it for a while, I came up with the following
        analysis: Once I OC, the four corners (A, B, C, D) are in some order. If
        I "fix" A, then there are only 6 orders for B, C, D = BCD, BDC, CBD,
        CDB, DBC, DCB (let's say I'm looking at them from the top). So, 1/6 of
        the time I get to skip PC. I also get a PE skip when the PC routines I
        use also do the right PE (call this proto-PLL). Sound like reasonable
        logic to others? I'm sure that with my old order there were step skips
        as well, but it feels like more. An average of two " step skips" in a
        set of 12 runs is a nice situation. And, yes, I know the next statement:
        Learn PLL and you'll always have one less step (4 to 3)! I'm working on
        it! yeff

        matter whether you orient or permute corners first. A 3 look LL with PLL
        gives you about a 17.5% chance to skip a step, usually the edge
        orientation. This is the usual way to turn a 4 look into a 3 look. It
        only requires 21 extra algs and improves your speed considerably. If you
        were to learn the algs to orient corners and permute edges together,
        that would work great as well, but be 71 or so extra algs to learn. Your
        odds to skip a step would be around 29%, though. It would be a nice lead
        in for a more advanced method, too. -Mike Bennett

        These are the same no matter whether you orient or permute corners &gt;
        first. No, I dont agree with that! This is being very technical, of
        course. But, do M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2. You may consider this to be a CP
        skip if you do CP first or you can consider this to be a EP skip if you
        do EP first. But, if you do EP first, then you have 2/12 = 1/6 chance to
        skip the EP and a 1/12 chance to skip CP. It depends on how you classify
        that case. :) &gt; A 3 look LL with PLL gives you about a 17.5% chance
        to skip a step, &gt; usually the edge orientation. This is the usual way
        to turn a 4 look &gt; into a 3 look. It only requires 21 extra algs and
        improves your &gt; speed considerably. Well, if you have a 4-look, then
        you already know 7 of the PLL, so you only really need to learn 14 more.
        Of course, the J, R, N, and G account for 10 of these if you count
        mirrors and inverses, so it's not bad at all. :) &gt; If you were to
        learn the algs to orient corners and permute edges &gt; together, that
        would work great as well, but be 71 or so extra algs &gt; to learn. Your
        odds to skip a step would be around 29%, though. &gt; It would be a nice
        lead in for a more advanced method, too. What? Orient corners and
        permute edges together? Who does this? :P Are you suggesting learning 71
        algs so that you had a 3-look LL? (OE -&gt; OCPE -&gt; PC) ? 71
        algorithms to have a 3-look is terrible for only a 29% chance to skip a
        step! If you learn 78 algorithms total, you can have a 100% chance to
        skip step 3 (OLL -&gt; PLL!) ~ Bob

        Hi Jeff, At first I did four steps in this order. 1. permute corners 2.
        oriente corners 3. oriente edges 4. permute edges I've been combining
        two steps, three steps, and four steps, heading for a one look LL.
        Working this way you eventually get to skip quite a bit. Good luck,

        while, I came up with the following &gt; analysis: &gt; &gt; Once I OC,
        the four corners (A, B, C, D) are in some order. If &gt; I "fix" A, then
        there are only 6 orders for B, C, D = BCD, BDC, CBD, &gt; CDB, DBC, DCB
        (let's say I'm looking at them from the top). So, 1/6 &gt; of the time I
        get to skip PC. I also get a PE skip when the PC &gt; routines I use
        also do the right PE (call this proto-PLL). &gt; &gt; Sound like
        reasonable logic to others? I'm sure that with my old &gt; order there
        were step skips as well, but it feels like more. An &gt; average of two
        " step skips" in a set of 12 runs is a nice situation. &gt; &gt; And,
        yes, I know the next statement: Learn PLL and you'll always &gt; have
        one less step (4 to 3)! I'm working on it! &gt; &gt; yeff &gt;

        Sorry to intrude, but is there an FAQ for understanding how the various
        algorithms work beyond a beginners method for solving? I look at Dan
        Knight's site, or Jessica F.'s and get very much overwhelmed. I am
        thinking that a) I need to practice and b) I need to memorize at least
        one solution (currently using Jasmine's beginner page combined with a
        single repeated alg for doing the last layer cross - R' U' F' U F R). So
        I know I need to do these things... unfortunately it feels like what it
        is so far - that is, just learning algorithms without really
        understanding what they all do. Did you all understand what the
        algorithms did as you began memorizing them, or do you just do them with
        the full knowledge that they will solve the cube for you? p.s. Props to
        Jasmine.. this is the first time I have been able to solve a cube in

        i just memorized the algorithms and the understanding of them came after
        using them often. im just starting to. ive known a beginner method for
        solving the cube for years and just got turned on to speed cubing a
        month ago and now im getting low 40 averages. not very impressive i know
        but its much better then i was. so anyway what im saying is with
        dedication you will see dramatic improvements but master a beginning
        method first. dont overwhelm yourself with a lot of algs at once.

        Hello Everyone For anyone who cares, I have decided to cut down on color
        neutrality for the F2B. Instead of starting with 4 different Blocks, I
        will only use 2. White/Orange Yellow/Orange White/Red Cut Yellow/Red CUt
        The reason for this is to only have red corners for step 3. When I learn
        full CLL/COLL, one color is easier to learn (red instead of red and
        orange) Step 3 I have decided to learn full COLL, and CLL. There are
        cases when I can see that I want to change the edge orientations. Such
        as when I have only 2 bad edges or 6 bad edges. And then there are cases
        where I want to keep the edge orientations. Such as when I have no bad
        edges, or if I have 3 bad on top and 1 on bottom already. Here are 2
        examples F(RUR'U')2 F' or Bruno Sune RUR'URU2R' or rUR'URU2r' (OLL) I
        don't think its worth learning more than 2 algs for each case. COLL to
        preserve EO, or if you see something you dont like, CLL to change EO.
        Even with 2 algs for each case, there aren't that many to learn. I have
        found many OLLs which are also CLLs, so I can use old algs. Jason

        Hello again everyone Mike, you said you averaged 6.01 for step 4 with 13
        moves avg? Thats pretty much where I am. But we're both still doing it
        at 2.5 moves/sec... STEP 4 For cases when 1 ledge/redge is already
        inserted, I need to learn Ming Thai's algorithms. This could help me
        greatly. To learn this, do you guys read the top 3 stickers? ICI, CCC,
        ICC and so on.. Or do you see bad edges, and know ways to flip certain
        bad edges? For cases when both ledge and redge are already inserted, I
        need to learn algs to flip 2 edges in M layer(besides (M'UM'UM'd2)2). Or
        a faster one to flip 4 edged in M layer(besides F'L'F (M'U)4 F'LF). Both
        of these are pure(preserve position). For cases when ledge and redge are
        in DF and DB and good, you can use 1 of 3 ELLs to fix edges in upper
        layer. All are common OLLs. (FR'F'R)(L'U)(RU')M' (RUR'U')M'U(RU'r')
        MU(RUR'U')M2U(RU'r') For cases when DF and DB are good, and ledge and
        redge are in U layer, full ELL can solve all cases. Even the
        aformentioned 3 can help. These are all of my thoughts so far on step 4.
        It seems like a lot, and I didn't even talk about the hypothetical
        ZBesque table for permutation of 6 oriented cubies. Jason Kovacic PS. I
        need help with flipping 6 edges. There has to be a relatively short alg
        to flip all 6. Position is not a factor. Im guessing Maybe 8 moves?

        Although Gentoo might be the hardest distribution to install it is
        really one of my favorites. Once it is installed, it is very fast (as
        you compile everything from scratch) and it is actually easy to update
        (using the emerge command). For the window manager I would recommend
        either Fluxbox or Gnome. Just my 2 cents, Sven --- In

        Mike, you said you averaged 6.01 for step 4 with 13 moves avg? &gt;
        Thats pretty much where I am. But we're both still doing it at 2.5 &gt;
        moves/sec... &gt; &gt; STEP 4 &gt; &gt; For cases when 1 ledge/redge is
        already inserted, I need to learn Ming &gt; Thai's algorithms. This
        could help me greatly. To learn this, do you &gt; guys read the top 3
        stickers? ICI, CCC, ICC and so on.. &gt; Or do you see bad edges, and
        know ways to flip certain bad edges? &gt; &gt; For cases when both ledge
        and redge are already inserted, I need to &gt; learn algs to flip 2
        edges in M layer(besides (M'UM'UM'd2)2). Or a &gt; faster one to flip 4
        edged in M layer(besides F'L'F (M'U)4 F'LF). &gt; Both of these are
        pure(preserve position). &gt; &gt; For cases when ledge and redge are in
        DF and DB and good, you can use &gt; 1 of 3 ELLs to fix edges in upper
        layer. All are common OLLs. &gt; (FR'F'R)(L'U)(RU')M' &gt;
        (RUR'U')M'U(RU'r') &gt; MU(RUR'U')M2U(RU'r') &gt; &gt; For cases when DF
        and DB are good, and ledge and redge are in U layer, &gt; full ELL can
        solve all cases. Even the aformentioned 3 can help. &gt; &gt; These are
        all of my thoughts so far on step 4. It seems like a lot, &gt; and I
        didn't even talk about the hypothetical ZBesque table for &gt;
        permutation of 6 oriented cubies. &gt; &gt; Jason Kovacic &gt; &gt; PS.
        I need help with flipping 6 edges. There has to be a relatively &gt;
        short alg to flip all 6. Position is not a factor. Im guessing Maybe
        &gt; 8 moves? If you're learning Roux, I think adding the ELL and
        special cases like that in can only help. It's 29 algs for ELL, and the
        ZB type table would only have &lt;30 algs, as well. Not too bad. I only
        notice which edges are bad, and flip accordingly. The recognization
        takes only fractions of a second. The shortest alg I can come up with
        for orienting all 6 edges is 11 moves, which is the same as doing it the
        normal Roux way. M' U M U M' U M' U2 M U M'. Basically, it's a move to
        flip the UF, DF, UL, and UR edges combined with one for the UF and UB
        edges. The normal way is M'UM' U2 MUM U M'UM'. I can do that one in
        about 2.3 seconds. The fastest other one I've found is 15 moves: (M'U)*4
        MUM'U2MUM'. You should be able to do that one well under 3 seconds after
        a couple of tries. I can't complain about 5.35 moves/second. :) The
        normal way is still faster for me, but I've only practiced the new way
        for a minute. Time will tell. Still, you really only get this
        orientation (or the four incorrect edges on top, which solves the same
        way) 2/28 solves. As far as your first alg you posted, try doing those
        d2's as U2's. It's the same thing, really, but you can click U2 very
        quickly with an index finger twice, or follow with your middle finger. I
        definitely need to learn more of this method. -Mike team [zb]

        I think when most people start they are like you, and just want to solve
        a cube. When I first learned how to solve I just blindly learned algs
        and did them. Then I started to deconstruct them, see what they did to
        the other pieces on the cube, which helped me cut down time because I
        could set things up to do multiple things at once. Once you really get
        into cubing you will start to see what your algorithms do. Most are
        pretty straightforward...especially in a beginner solution.

        Only recently have I attempted to write them down, for some odd reason
        this is difficult for me and I've only written down about 300 so far. I
        "memorize" an alg by using it, that's both muscle memory and following
        it in my mind. I never just sit there and do one over and over a hundred
        times. I'm trying to reorganize all my algs and when I'm done that I
        might sit down and try repetition type memorization. &gt; p.s. Props to

        Of course your mail is on a lighter note, but i would like to add that
        the fact that windows is "closed source" is a big hindrence to the
        security guys. Since linux is opensourced, problems can be detected by
        good people well before they are started to be exploited. Whereas in the
        case of windows, first a virus has to exploit the vulnerability, which
        will tell us that such a bug exists and then the security experts have
        to patch it up. So its always a cat-and-mouse game here in windows.
        Hence i think linux is much secure overall. Ofcourse it may have
        millions of bugs right now but i believe they are getting fixed each
        day. Sachin. On 12/8/05, Per Kristen Fredlund

        Hey everyone, Not to keep bringing this up, but I really am incredibly
        excited about what Opposite color solving has been doing for my times.
        It took a while for Richard Patterson to convince me to try it, but now
        I don't think I'll ever go back to solving just one color. My old
        average average used to be about 17.5-17.6 seconds. My best 100 cube
        average with one color solving was 17.55. Well I just did a 100 cube
        average now that I am fairly comfortable with inspecting both colors in
        15 seconds, and my new 100 cube average is 16.83 seconds! I dropped
        about 0.7 second from my average, and I haven't changed any new algs,
        nor have I been using any ZB tricks in my Fridrich solving other than
        the occasional ZBF2L with all flipped edges (maybe 1/50 solves). The
        only major change is opposite color solving. I know that for years the
        view has been that solving the same color always provides enough color
        recognition to make your times superfast. Well I think that is too
        restrictive. By solving opposite color you always solve the same F2L
        edges, that is only restriction. I mean think about it, does changing
        the the first layer sticker color on the corner really change that much
        when looking for an F2L c/e pair? Well I say no! So anyway, I've gotten
        the feeling that some people are trying this, let me know what you
        think! I've also gotten the feeling that people think this is a weird
        thing to do since it is different from the accepted belief that solving
        the same color is best. Well I'm trying to break that belief! Try
        opposite color solving! It is so amazing, that I will never switch back
        from it! Don't be afraid of it being different, it is so amazingly worth
        it! Just my views and opinions of course, but I sincerely hope everyone
        gives it a try for a short time to at least see what you think. Chris

        With opposite color, the hardest part is F2L. For the LL I event get
        better times with white than yellow on top :p But that can be arranged
        pretty fast. I'll work on that this weekend and post some results.

        Some days ago I made a very good time using opposite color for the
        cross. I'm really convinced that is a good thing. Sometimes I have a
        square already formed on the opposite color, and a bad cross on my
        normal color. So, what to do? Solve with opposite color. It's cool, and
        I think I can get better with practice. Pedro Gilles van den Peereboom

        Hey Gilles, I guess my best response is "I don't know." I think full
        color neutrality would really make solving the cross easy. I actually
        used to do this in my first year of speedcubing and average about 5.5
        moves for the cross (1 move less than 1 color very consistently). I
        switched to one color when that was the "cool" thing to do though. I
        guess I do like the benefit gained from always solving the same color(s)
        to some extent. I think I would have a harder time finding an Xcross if
        I was searching on any color (which is a huge part of my personal
        strategy) but maybe with practice it would work? I guess for myself I am
        trying to find a balance between improving my odds for an easy start,
        and having color familiarity. For me opposite color solving does that,
        since I always solve the same F2L edges. I guess for me personally I
        don't want to move back to full color neutrality, since I think I
        wouldn't use Xcross as often. Also I do like having the F2L edges always
        looking the same. Also, I do sometimes solve a non-white and non-yellow
        color if the cross is 2 moves or less, or the Xcross is 4 moves or so.
        This is very rare, but I do get fast solves with it sometimes. I guess
        the full color neutrality depends on the person. I personally don't want
        that much freedom, but more than just solving on color all the time.

        Hello, I'm going to change one of my cube color scheme, but in order to
        save some stickers, I would like to do a maximum by just changing the
        position of some pieces. I'd like to swap the 2 adjacent colors (white
        and red in my case) to get back to a "normal" color scheme (yes I'm
        changing my stupid color scheme I came up with at the WC :p) At the
        moment the number of stickers I have to change is 10 (instead of 18). I
        flipped manually one edge and swaped 2 corners (manually too) + I
        permuted 4 edges with algorithms. Is there a smaller number of stickers
        to change the color scheme ? or is it already the maximum ? Thx, Gilles.

        &gt; &gt; Gilles. I've now gotten a few in the 28.xx range, but they
        were simple cases. Based on the number of moves you save, it looks like
        learning the special optimizations for the 4 and 6 incorrect edge cases
        should come first. I suppose I should probably try to do that tomorrow,

        order to save some stickers, I would like to do a maximum by just
        changing the position of some pieces. I'd like to swap the 2 adjacent
        colors (white and red in my case) to get back to a "normal" color scheme
        (yes I'm changing my stupid color scheme I came up with at the WC :p) At
        the moment the number of stickers I have to change is 10 (instead of
        18). I flipped manually one edge and swaped 2 corners (manually too) + I
        permuted 4 edges with algorithms. Is there a smaller number of stickers
        to change the color scheme ? or is it already the maximum ? Thx, Gilles.

        Hey Stuart, I made a tutorial a while back that tries to explain how the
        moves work. Go to www.solvethecube.co.uk, and click through to
        'Tutorials' and choose the second tutorial. It's a pretty big tutorial,

        really understanding what they all do. &gt; &gt; Did you all understand
        what the algorithms did as you began memorizing &gt; them, or do you
        just do them with the full knowledge that they will &gt; solve the cube

        I would do it, except my cross sucks and I don't know what to look for.
        I guess I'll take a look at that and try figuring out how to do an
        Xcross over winter break before trying my hand at opposite color
        solving. cmhardw wrote: &gt; Hey everyone, &gt; &gt; Not to keep
        bringing this up, but I really am incredibly excited about &gt; what
        Opposite color solving has been doing for my times. It took a &gt; while
        for Richard Patterson to convince me to try it, but now I don't &gt;
        think I'll ever go back to solving just one color. &gt; &gt; My old
        average average used to be about 17.5-17.6 seconds. My best &gt; 100
        cube average with one color solving was 17.55. Well I just did a &gt;
        100 cube average now that I am fairly comfortable with inspecting both
        &gt; colors in 15 seconds, and my new 100 cube average is 16.83 seconds!
        &gt; &gt; I dropped about 0.7 second from my average, and I haven't
        changed any &gt; new algs, nor have I been using any ZB tricks in my
        Fridrich solving &gt; other than the occasional ZBF2L with all flipped
        edges (maybe 1/50 &gt; solves). The only major change is opposite color
        solving. &gt; &gt; I know that for years the view has been that solving
        the same color &gt; always provides enough color recognition to make
        your times superfast. &gt; Well I think that is too restrictive. By
        solving opposite color you &gt; always solve the same F2L edges, that is
        only restriction. I mean &gt; think about it, does changing the the
        first layer sticker color on the &gt; corner really change that much
        when looking for an F2L c/e pair? Well &gt; I say no! &gt; &gt; So
        anyway, I've gotten the feeling that some people are trying this, &gt;
        let me know what you think! I've also gotten the feeling that people
        &gt; think this is a weird thing to do since it is different from the
        &gt; accepted belief that solving the same color is best. &gt; &gt; Well
        I'm trying to break that belief! Try opposite color solving! It &gt; is
        so amazing, that I will never switch back from it! Don't be afraid &gt;
        of it being different, it is so amazingly worth it! &gt; &gt; Just my
        views and opinions of course, but I sincerely hope everyone &gt; gives
        it a try for a short time to at least see what you think. &gt; &gt;

        Oh yes that's him. (sorry to have thought you were Japanese Jason Thong
        :s) As I said, I'm going to work on opposite last layer, but I can
        already say that using white or yellow doesn't change much. You just
        have to be very fluent and look ahead very much when you solve yellow.
        And with that, you can get easily sub20 times (although most of my

        Hey, that's better than me. I once pulled an all-nighter "just because I
        hadn't done it before" and ended up staying awake for about 40
        consecutive hours. I think I fell asleep for a little bit at 28 hours.
        Actually, let's see, so my flight to Orlando was at 10 PM, but I didn't
        sleep on the plane and I think I woke up at 10 that day, and I ended up
        getting to sleep at about 1 AM EST two days later... you might be able
        to tell I'm not the biggest fan of math. The cubing while drunk record
        is very subjective. I remember seeing a 17-second record on there. Now,
        whereas 17 seconds might be very slow while someone is drunk, it's
        nothing comparable to a +1 minute average of a sub-20 cuber. That, my
        friend, is true following of the spirit of the unofficial world records
        :-P. So why do we do these things? Because we can! And we're awesome
        when we try! 15.66 second average is generally enough for most people to
        wet their pants to. If you check out http://www.beermile.com/, there's
        this thing called the "Renaissance Mile". Unfortunately, I'm 5'6" and I
        can't really dunk a basketball without standing on someone's shoulders,
        a step ladder, or a springy trampoline, but the record for the
        Renaissance Mile is unclaimed. If you're done with finals, you know what
        to do. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Dec 9,

        Hey, 26.5 hours. That's nothing. Back in 94 I stayed up for 36h+
        watching this demo http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=99 and playing
        arcade games on my Amiga 500 with some friend and drinking beer....
        (Really good demo btw for being made 1992, haven't seen it since then)
        But, a couple of years ago, just before my final exam I remember I
        stayed up for 50h+ programming C++ for my masters thesis "non-linear
        contact problems with the finite element method". Fortunately, I had not
        found my old cube so there where very small delays... Nowadays, one may
        think why do we spend 1000h+ cubing (hopefully with sleeping in
        between)? Well, for the fun of it! Ok, just had to share my experience.
        Btw, opposite colour solving is really good. After just a couple of
        solves (20 or so) I did not worse/better than with my usual colour. Why
        DID'NT I do this before? // Dennis www.cubeloop.com -----Ursprungligt

        Back before I was into cubing, my record without sleep was 69.25 hours.
        It was achieved with one night of intense studying and homework
        completing, one of support for a friend doing the same (and boredom
        because I'd finished all of my finals) and stayed up late the third
        evening to see the premier of Return of the King with about 150
        classmates. I fell asleep on the bus home hard enough that they pelted
        me with playing cards until I started bleeding, all without waking up.
        It was an interesting finals week. I was up a little over 24 hours a few
        days ago, but my averages stink without sleep. I get good spike times,
        though. And I'm better at x-cross and opposite color solving. My
        personal best average that way is a marvelous 20.01. That's about where
        I average anyhow. -Mike team [zb]

        Hello Everyone, For Opposite color cross solving, It is just as easy to
        do OLL and PLL on either side. But for COLL, Isn't it hard to recognize
        cases from the opposite side? FOr F2B, I use opposite color solving,
        doubling my chances for a good 3x2x1. When I get to step 3, and have to
        do the corners, I just do OLL(7)and a PLL(2). Usually about 5 sec. With
        opposite color solving This step is Easy, just like OLL and PLL is easy
        for either Yellow or White. But CLL is hard to recognize from either
        side. So I think I'm going to start using only 1 color. Is opposite
        color solving good for CLL COLL systems? Jason Kovacic

        Alright one more just before going to bed. Tried as hard as I could to
        stay focused for all 12 solves. I'm definitely not going to do this
        again any time soon, so I figured I might as well do one more average
        before I go to sleep. update at 30.5 hours with no sleep average: 16.87
        seconds times: 14.67, 18.02, 14.57, 16.88, (14.22), 17.82, 16.35,

        lot of people are trying opposite color, that's awesome! I hope it
        continues to work for everyone who's tried it and liked it, I certainly
        think it is a cool method. Richard, are you having any luck with opp.

        Hey Jason, I do use COLL when solving a yellow cross if the case is a
        fast one (or if I'm doing ZB stuff). It was very, very weird to get used
        to at first, but with some practice you do get used to seeing the
        CLL/COLL case on your opposite color. Again, everything about switching
        to also using your opposite color feels quite strange at first, but if
        you stick with it, you'll find that it really isn't all that different
        from solving your regular color. This may be a different case with the
        Roux method though, since you also have to take the centers into account
        and those would change orders too. As far as just CLL and COLL go though
        I can definitely say that over time you do get used to it, but it takes
        some adjusting. Hope this helps. Don't give up on opposite color just
        yet! Try it for a bit and see if the CLL gets better. Again I don't know
        if having to also worry about the changing of the centers orders makes
        it even harder for Roux method, but so far all the initial difficulties
        I've had from solving my opposite color I've now gotten over. Chris ---

        It seems that would be much more efficient.. Would it really be more
        efficient? How? I do whatever presents itself first, but I have a vague
        plan I usually follow. The method is incredibly flexible. Usually, I
        start out with a single c/e pair, and build from there. Inserting edges
        into a 1x2x3 is easy, and often very quick, because you can see the CLL
        case and recognize it while completing the last edge. Getting a c/e pair
        with the edge going in the DL or DR spots is fine, too, because
        inserting the other edge to make a 2x2x1 is quick. Generally, though, my
        solves follow the pattern (although I rotate the cube a lot, so the
        position of the 1x2x3's can be anywhere in the F2L): DL edge, c/e pair,
        c/e pair, DR edge, c/e pair, c/e pair. There is still a lot of
        variation, though. Often, to start, you get c/e pairs for opposite
        blocks you can solve easily, and just fill in the rest. There are also
        times when you get to solve the DL and DR edges easily, and you're left
        with c/e pairs only, like F2L. I average about 50-52 moves total for the
        method. (STM) -Mike team [zb]

        enough with it, you really don't have a single cross color. You have two
        to choose from. I find that my usual cross color (white) actually makes
        my LL go easier, because the pieces are easier to see. Maybe I need two

        your opposite color &gt; feels quite strange at first, but if you stick
        with it, you'll find &gt; that it really isn't all that different from
        solving your regular &gt; color. This may be a different case with the
        Roux method though, &gt; since you also have to take the centers into
        account and those would &gt; change orders too. Not really. If you
        orient centers prior to Step 4, you're left with the same recognition
        for either color. The only thing that changes is the single sticker on
        the UR and UL edges to its opposite color. If you don't orient centers
        first, it's the same thing, now that I think about it. The only two
        things that change are the U color on the UL and UR edges. &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For Opposite color cross solving, It is just as
        easy to do OLL and PLL &gt; &gt; on either side. But for COLL, Isn't it
        hard to recognize cases from &gt; &gt; the opposite side? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; FOr F2B, I use opposite color solving, doubling my chances for a
        good &gt; &gt; 3x2x1. When I get to step 3, and have to do the corners,
        I just do &gt; &gt; OLL(7)and a PLL(2). Usually about 5 sec. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; With opposite color solving This step is Easy, just like OLL
        and PLL &gt; &gt; is easy for either Yellow or White. But CLL is hard to
        recognize from &gt; &gt; either side. So I think I'm going to start
        using only 1 color. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is opposite color solving good
        for CLL COLL systems? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jason Kovacic If you're going
        to do corners in two steps, you should permute, then orient, especially
        if you'd like to learn Gilles' recognization method for CLL. You just
        see which two corners need to switch 5/6 of the time, and the
        orientation. If you're using a standard color scheme, which I believe
        you are, you should get similar colors as opposites. Do you use Red and
        Orange for your LL color now? I don't see why learning to do two colors
        is really any harder than getting good at one. The colors are similar,
        and if you can recognize the permutation, you shouldn't have any
        trouble. Like I mentioned above, I actually get better LL's with my
        usual D color as U, because white is brighter. If you practice it enough
        (more than an hour or two, really) you'll notice how easy it starts to
        be. Just keep at it. You won't regret it. -Mike team [zb]

        Okay, it wouldn't be amazingly more efficient, but if you build the
        first 2x2x1 in the LBD area, F turns can be used without restriction to
        build the second 2x2x1 a little bit more efficiently. As for the move

        Hello, Yesterday when I was watching the drawing for the Football World
        Cup in Germany, I was turning my cube and something came up in my mind :
        What about using a cage method for the 3x3 ? Some times when you solve
        the cross, you really have a bad time (though it's usually not so hard
        :p) but what if the cross was already solved, but not with the good
        center ? (or something close to that) Wouldn't it be better to do F2L
        and then LL without the right centers and then fix the centers
        afterwards ? The thing is I don't see many advantages with that, but
        maybe you'll see more than I do :-) What do you think ? Gilles.

        Stuber It really depends on how efficiently you build 1x2x3 blocks, and
        how lucky your starts are. If you build well, you should average well
        under what you would for typical F2L. If you don't build so well, or you
        get bad cases, you'll average the same as you would for F2L. I'd peg it
        around 22-28 moves, depending. Of course, you could use more than that,
        if you use a lot of two generators, which are very fast. So it's hard to
        say, really. As for the edges, you should average under 6 moves, if
        you're not using any optimizations or unconstrained centers. Just the
        basics will get you that. It becomes less if you start to incorporate
        special cases. If anyone is feeling brave enough with ACube, would
        someone work out the algs, number of cases, and average number of moves
        to finish off the last 6 edges simultaneously once they're oriented
        correctly? I'd do it myself if I could get ACube to work on my computer.

        Hey Gilles, Interesting idea. I had never really thought to try that to
        be honest. Sometimes I do start with centers moves right after I pick up
        the cube though. Say I have two c/e pairs that connect correctly to the
        same corner, so sort of like a 2x2x1 block but the center is not the
        right one. If the center is in a bad spot, and I can't really use face
        turns effciently then I sometimes permute the center into the 2x2x1
        block and finish from there. I do remember once, maybe twice, I actually
        have had a solved cross bu on the wrong face, and I permuted the center
        into that face and a super fast cross. That was very lucky to get that
        though. I think your idea will allow for always solving an easier cross
        (since you can choose to solve it almost anywhere. I say almost since
        half of the positions you could solve a cross into will give you a
        parity error. If you turn any middle layer on a cube where centers are
        indistinct then you perform an odd cycle on the edges but leave corners
        alone. Choosing to solve the cross on other faces will make this edge
        parity possible, so you would have to watch out for that. The F2L is a
        bit confusing, but you could get used to looking at the side color of
        the cross edge rather than the center to know where stuff goes, so that
        is not a big deal. I think the only real hump in such an approach is
        learning your color scheme well enough to always solve your cross sch as
        to avoid the parity error, but I think that would not take much work. I
        actually want to look into this, since for a solve where a cross is
        mostly or completely built on the wrong face, this could be fast. I'll
        definitely try it and see what I think ;-) Chris --- In

        Hi all, I don't feel like I've started something new, though it is
        exciting to see new ideas explored in the community. To be honest, when
        I solved with one color sometimes I would get crosses that would destroy
        my times. A few times I would just happen to see the opposite side and
        think "it's too bad I don't solve for that color!" After some thought I
        realized this restriction had to go. At first I only solved for opposite
        color if it was extremely obvious the cross was better (i.e. 6+ turn
        cross on normal color, 3-4 turns or simple xCross for opp. color) After
        a lot of work I'm sure the mental barriers for opposite color will fall,
        and "opposite" will be a relative term. How's dual solving sound? :P
        Seriously though, this approach makes too much sense. The only reason I
        can see people not doing it is because solving for one color has been
        stressed so much. Open your minds cubers :) Soon I will sell Chris on
        partial cross solving and you'll hear all about that :P -Richard --- In

        Yes I practiced it a bit, and you can definitely get used to do the F2L
        without looking at the color of the center + the color scheme is not
        that hard to use (maybe if you try opposite color and cage method, it
        will be a bit hard at the beginning, but it's definitely possible). Btw
        I could do a sub 20 average using opposite color wisely (I must have
        used it about 4 times in that 19.5x average) So I'll work a bit more on
        opposite color to get completely used to it, but it's definitely not
        hard to switch from white to yellow. I'm going to look for some sort of
        parity fiw that swaps 2 edges + some centers. This might be an
        interesting extension too :-) Gilles. 2005/12/10, Jo√´l van Noort

        Hello, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday when I was watching the
        drawing for the Football World &gt; Cup &gt; &gt; &gt; in Germany, I was
        turning my cube and something came up in my &gt; mind : &gt; &gt; &gt;
        What about using a cage method for the 3x3 ? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Some times when you solve the cross, you really have a bad time
        &gt; &gt; &gt; (though it's usually not so hard :p) but what if the
        cross was &gt; already &gt; &gt; &gt; solved, but not with the good
        center ? (or something close to &gt; that) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Wouldn't it be better to do F2L and then LL without the right &gt;
        centers &gt; &gt; &gt; and then fix the centers afterwards ? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The thing is I don't see many advantages with that,
        but maybe &gt; you'll &gt; &gt; &gt; see more than I do :-) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think ? &gt; &gt; &gt; Gilles. &gt; &gt;

        The best answer I can give is that it depends on you. The best thing to
        do if you don't want to buy all of them (btw there is also a mefferts
        5x5 ) is to try someone's cubes and see for yourself. Gilles.

        Hello again :-) I was playing around with my cube at the cinema earlier
        today (instead of watching the commercials) and I found an interesting 3
        edges cycle. Here is the algorithm : 11stm, 13 ftm, 14 qtm r U M U R' U'
        M' U R U2 r' and this is how I perform it : r U r' R U R' U' M' U R U2
        r' I'll add a video of it to my website probably tomorrow
        (www.belgiancubes.tk) I don't know yet if I'm going to use it, but some
        of you who like double layer turns + M' moves (you can also do it using
        the double layer technique = r U r' R U R' U' r R' U R U2 r' ) might
        like it. Tell me what you think :-) Gilles.

        Hi Bob, I had a great time today. I got to see many of my fellow cubers
        in the area. I was surprised at how important the magic was to
        everyone!! It seemed every competetor knew how to solve it. The
        competition was still fun even though I had a lot to do. It seemed I was
        the all important puzzle repair man! I fixed 2 magics completely, 6-7
        broken strings and 5 2x2's. I'm considering making a name tag for the
        next competition. :-P On that note, if you need your puzzle repaired at
        a competition, look for me. I can do 2x2 rubiks, 3x3 (duh), 4x4 rubiks,
        5x5 rubiks, and any form of magic (regular magic, master magic, etc.).
        Thanks Bob for hosting this great competition! I hope you have another
        one soon. Peter Greenwood --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hello all, I've been playing around with the Roux method a lot lately,
        and I've decided it needs as much attention and perfecting as Fridrich
        and company are getting. :) To that end, I've been trying to find ways
        to speed the Last 6 edges (and 4 centers) up, and thinking a lot about
        several variations of the normal method. First, there's unconstrained
        centers. This can shorten some of the hardest orientation situations
        from 12 moves down to 5 or 6, but the recognition seems akin to ZB to
        me. I need more practice with this, definitely, but I think that it may
        take too much time, even with mastery. (sorry, Gilles) The whole Step 4
        method takes something like 18 moves on average, if my math is anywhere
        near correct. Instead of orienting and permuting L6E, what if we were to
        finish off DF and DB edges, then complete the cube with ELL? The hardest
        situations for finishing the two edges should be around 7 moves, with
        the average being somewhere around 6. ELL averages about 12 moves, so
        that puts the method in similar standing to the normal way. But what if
        we only finish off the DB edge? It can only be in 6 places, each place
        having 2 possible orientations. Thus, 12 simple cases, 11 of which are 5
        moves or fewer. The average move count should be about 3.5, with the
        hardest situations at 7. You don't need to orient centers prior to this
        step, either. And recognition is very simple. The hardest case to spot
        is when the piece is already correct. :) After this, we could use any of
        the 22 possible cases found here:
        http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/NewAlgSet.html This would give us an
        average of under 7 moves to place the DF edge and orient the LL edges,
        leaving us with an edge PLL step, as in COLL. As edge PLL's average 7
        moves, our previous step averages 6.5 or so, and our first step at 3.5,
        this gives us around 17 again. The benefits? Aside from the 1/12 chance
        for a PLL skip, and the extremely easy to recognize and execute EPLL
        step, you never need to change your grip, and after the DF and DB edges
        are placed, you never need to adjust the M slice. Also, there are a
        number of lucky cases to exploit. There are only 29 or so unique cases
        for when the edges come up correctly oriented after placing DB. There
        are some very fast cases for when edges are correctly placed but
        incorrectly oriented, and learning the ELL algs can help out nicely for
        the 1/10 of cases where the DF edge completes itself along with DB. The
        worst case scenario is 26 moves to finish, and comes up roughly 1/2880
        cases, while the odds for a 4 move or fewer solution are 1/72. When
        someone gets an OLL or PLL skip with Fridrich, the solve is usually in
        the low 40's for the number of moves. A PLL skip with COLL will probably
        be between 40 and 45. A very nice ZB solve may be in the mid to high
        30's. With good 1x2x3's and a nice CLL case (like FRUR'U'F' or B' R'FR B
        R'F'R), a sub or low 30's move solve is a good possibility. Something
        like 1/312 solves (more once I learn more CLL's instead of slow COLL's
        :P) If anyone is interested in hearing more about this, or helping me to
        further this approach, please let me know. I could definitely use the
        services of someone who is good with ACube. Anyway, that's what's going
        through my head right now. Gilles, Jason, and others, what do you think?

        I don't know why but it doesn't really please me. I'm rather looking for

        Umm .... I think that actually the Rubiks.com 5x5x5's are the best ones.
        Thy are more stable than the others. But of course the initial stiffness
        is a big setback. I hope that my correspondence with Seventowns will be
        fruitful. I have suggested some changes to the design. The reason many
        prefer mefferts or the old 80's wahn is cause they use screws and not
        rivets. I'd really love to see Seventowns switch to good machine screws
        so one can remove the tightness and also adjust the tension to ones
        liking easily. And also do those changes to the outer edges. Like i have
        seen on Grant Tregay's cube it makes the cube turn a whole lot nicer,
        probably eliminating many of the problems with twisting corner-centers
        and popping edge-centers and so on. Cause right now most ppl's worry w
        larger cubes is to get a good 5x5x5. A good 5x5x5 easily saves u 30 secs
        or more on a solve. I know this from experience. I could never get sub
        3:00 consistently on my old Wahn even after balancing the tension. The
        molding of the pieces was not really good. Well, the kind of 5x5x5
        really also depends a lot on cubing style. Im very dependent on a high
        turn-rate w my cage method. I gain solving time by faster recognition
        even if my solution is a bit longer than the pairing-up approach.

        trying to find ways to speed the Last 6 edges &gt; (and 4 centers) up,
        and thinking a lot about several variations of the &gt; normal method.
        &gt; &gt; First, there's unconstrained centers. This can shorten some of
        the &gt; hardest orientation situations from 12 moves down to 5 or 6,
        but the &gt; recognition seems akin to ZB to me. I need more practice
        with this, &gt; definitely, but I think that it may take too much time,
        even with &gt; mastery. I wrote that some of them only are interesting.
        Case 3a for example, it would stupid to start a 7 moves orientation
        sequence (including two U2). M' is enough. And the case is rather easy
        to recognize, with UL and UR on top. If an "optimization" makes you
        loose time, just don't use it. As I said, sub-4 is possible without
        these optimizations. Look at this random solve:
        http://grrroux.free.fr/capcubeM2.avi Orientation: M'UM'UMUM' Insertion:
        U'M2U' Permutation: M'U2M'2U2M' A rather long finish, but it took only
        about 3s and my slices are not as fast as Bob's. &gt; The whole Step 4
        method takes something like &gt; 18 moves on average, if my math is
        anywhere near correct. Wrong, it should be around 14 if you mix 4a+4b
        and 4b+4c. &gt; Instead of orienting and permuting L6E, what if we were
        to finish off &gt; DF and DB edges, then complete the cube with ELL? The
        hardest &gt; situations for finishing the two edges should be around 7
        moves, with &gt; the average being somewhere around 6. ELL averages
        about 12 moves, so &gt; that puts the method in similar standing to the
        normal way. &gt; &gt; But what if we only finish off the DB edge? It can
        only be in 6 &gt; places, each place having 2 possible orientations.
        Thus, 12 simple &gt; cases, 11 of which are 5 moves or fewer. The
        average move count should &gt; be about 3.5, with the hardest situations
        at 7. You don't need to &gt; orient centers prior to this step, either.
        And recognition is very &gt; simple. The hardest case to spot is when
        the piece is already &gt; correct. :) After this, we could use any of
        the 22 possible cases &gt; found here:
        http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/NewAlgSet.html &gt; &gt; This would
        give us an average of under 7 moves to place the DF edge &gt; and orient
        the LL edges, leaving us with an edge PLL step, as in COLL. &gt; As edge
        PLL's average 7 moves, our previous step averages 6.5 or so, &gt; and
        our first step at 3.5, this gives us around 17 again. The &gt; benefits?
        Aside from the 1/12 chance for a PLL skip, and the &gt; extremely easy
        to recognize and execute EPLL step, you never need to &gt; change your
        grip, and after the DF and DB edges are placed, you never &gt; need to
        adjust the M slice. &gt; &gt; Also, there are a number of lucky cases to
        exploit. There are only 29 &gt; or so unique cases for when the edges
        come up correctly oriented after &gt; placing DB. There are some very
        fast cases for when edges are &gt; correctly placed but incorrectly
        oriented, and learning the ELL algs &gt; can help out nicely for the
        1/10 of cases where the DF edge completes &gt; itself along with DB. The
        worst case scenario is 26 moves to finish, &gt; and comes up roughly
        1/2880 cases, while the odds for a 4 move or &gt; fewer solution are
        1/72. I think that EPLL as the last step is not a very good idea,
        permuting M-edges is much faster. The standard corners-first approach
        that begins with solving UL or UR (instead of DB), before solving the
        other and orienting M-edges looks like a better idea to me. If the first
        piece (UL/UR) is a bit difficult to solve, just put it oriented in U
        (don't care wether it's inserted between the right corners or not),
        apply the standard CF orientation sequence without the last 2 moves, and
        you end up in the middle of step 4b. For this technique, you should need
        less than 15 moves on average too. &gt; I could definitely use the &gt;
        services of someone who is good with ACube. ACube is very nice and
        useful, but it's not the right tool when centers are moving parts.
        Thanks for contributing! Gilles. [Non-text portions of this message have

        I think it's a great substitute. Put on a couple layers of nail polish

        Rutgers. It also holds up very well and looks the same as the day it was

        the Rubiks.com 5x5x5's are the best ones. Thy are more stable than the
        others. But of course the initial stiffness is a big setback. I hope
        that my correspondence with Seventowns will be fruitful. I have
        suggested some changes to the design. The reason many prefer mefferts or
        the old 80's wahn is cause they use screws and not rivets. I'd really
        love to see Seventowns switch to good machine screws so one can remove
        the tightness and also adjust the tension to ones liking easily. And
        also do those changes to the outer edges. Like i have seen on Grant
        Tregay's cube it makes the cube turn a whole lot nicer, probably
        eliminating many of the problems with twisting corner-centers and
        popping edge-centers and so on. Cause right now most ppl's worry w
        larger cubes is to get a good 5x5x5. A good 5x5x5 easily saves u 30 secs
        or more on a solve. I know this from experience. I could never get sub
        3:00 consistently on my old Wahn even after balancing the tension. The
        molding of the pieces was not really good. Well, the kind of 5x5x5
        really also depends a lot on cubing style. Im very dependent on a high
        turn-rate w my cage method. I gain solving time by faster recognition
        even if my solution is a bit longer than the pairing-up approach.

        interesting. Case 3a for example, it would stupid to start a 7 moves
        orientation sequence (including two U2). M' is enough. And the case is
        rather easy to recognize, with UL and UR on top. &gt; If an
        "optimization" makes you loose time, just don't use it. &gt; &gt; As I
        said, sub-4 is possible without these optimizations. &gt; &gt; Wrong, it
        should be around 14 if you mix 4a+4b and 4b+4c. My mistake. So far I'm
        averaging 18-20, but I'm not very efficient yet at mixing steps, and I
        can't use any of the special cases or the unconstrained centers. Not
        fast enough for speedsolving, anyway. :) &gt; &gt; &gt; As edge PLL's
        average 7 moves, our previous step averages 6.5 or so, &gt; &gt; and our
        first step at 3.5, this gives us around 17 again. This is only my
        preliminary number, using the actual case counts and blindly applying
        the algs. I'm sure this can be less if we can find optimizations for it
        like you did for Step 4. &gt; &gt; Also, there are a number of lucky
        cases to exploit. There are only 29 &gt; &gt; or so unique cases for
        when the edges come up correctly oriented after &gt; &gt; placing DB.
        There are some very fast cases for when edges are &gt; &gt; correctly
        placed but incorrectly oriented, and learning the ELL algs &gt; &gt; can
        help out nicely for the 1/10 of cases where the DF edge completes &gt;
        &gt; itself along with DB. The worst case scenario is 26 moves to
        finish, &gt; &gt; and comes up roughly 1/2880 cases, while the odds for
        a 4 move or &gt; &gt; fewer solution are 1/72. I need some assistance
        finding nice optimizations as you did for Step 4. How did you come up
        with those? Perhaps a similar process would work well here. I know
        placing the last 5 edges once oriented should work out to 10 or fewer
        moves, and the ELL cases work out to around 12 on average, giving those
        cases fewer than 17 moves on average. But I'm certain there is a way to
        reduce the moves for the general cases. One good way is to try to orient
        edges when inserting the DB piece. Scramble with M U M' U2. To insert
        this with M U M', you leave two incorrect edges for the next step, which
        is not as nice to fix. Inserting it with the inverse of the scramble now
        costs you one move, but gives you a nice 3 move insertion for the second
        step, or possibly a finish for the final 5 simultaneously. &gt; I think
        that EPLL as the last step is not a very good idea, permuting M-edges is
        much faster. I'm working on it. ;) &gt; ACube is very nice and useful,
        but it's not the right tool when centers are moving parts. &gt; &gt;
        Thanks for contributing! &gt; &gt; Gilles. I know it's not very good for
        this, but it's better than me slowly attempting to find things by hand.
        If anyone still wants to help me out with this on ACube, I'm very
        interested. -Mike

        Hi Jason, What you normally do is: 1) take 2 or 3 cubes 2) have someone
        scramble them before you start 3) start the time and start solving 4)
        while solving cubes, the scrambler scrambles the solved cubes 5) stop
        the time when 42 are solved. We normally do not use official scrambles
        for these unofficial records. 42 is the number of kilometers for a
        marathon. The current unofficial record is held by Lars Vandenbergh:

        Hmm.. From that angle, the video looks like you are doing some identity
        algorithm... Eh.. The 1.42 is just my record for my favourite U
        permutation from my favourite angle, which is cycling UR -&gt; UB -&gt;
        UL -&gt; UR. I can do it on the stackmat sub 2 very consistenty, but I
        am sure a lot of sub20 cubers can do this too. Cheers! Jo√´l. --- In

        (using 2 &gt; &gt; generators) is still around 3 seconds. &gt; &gt; So

        playing around with my cube at the cinema earlier today &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Thank you, That's I asked ACube to do but your solution is better.
        However it's still very very long and you can't resonably finish with
        such an algorithm on the 3x3x3. Another possibility is to fix the
        centers at the beginning. But then it just goes back to a normal
        Fridrich Solve. So I guess I won't look much more into that possibility,
        maybe I'll from time to time do the cross on one side and fix the center
        but it needs to be a very lucky case then. Thanks :-) Gilles.

        Hi Bob &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend making z first and then
        R [(U R' D) (R2 U' R D')]2 or R' &gt; &gt; &gt; [(U' R D') (R2 U R' D)]2
        for the other case. I find these rather fast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Hi Stefan, Bob, teemu_tiinanen, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where QF
        means turning the whole cube the same way as F, try &gt; &gt; QF (F R' B
        R2 F' R B') 2 &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; QF (B' R D' R2 B R' F) 2 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those
        are they same algorithms as the ones I suggested but from a &gt;
        different position, and you use F and B instead of U and D, which is
        &gt; much more slower in my opinion. &gt; Actually those are the same as
        the two I posted to Stefan a couple of months ago (R U' L U2 R' U L')*2
        and it's mirror. Yours are good, but people have different styles. The
        main difference there between using F and B instead of U and D is the
        angle of the left wrist and with F and B you can see what happening.

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Bob &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I recommend making z first and then R [(U R' D) (R2 U' R D')]2 or R'
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [(U' R D') (R2 U R' D)]2 for the other case. I find
        these rather &gt; fast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Hi Stefan, Bob, teemu_tiinanen, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where
        QF means turning the whole cube the same way as F, try &gt; &gt; &gt; QF
        (F R' B R2 F' R B') 2 &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; QF (B' R D' R2 B
        R' F) 2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; David J &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those are they same
        algorithms as the ones I suggested but from a &gt; &gt; different
        position, and you use F and B instead of U and D, which is &gt; &gt;
        much more slower in my opinion. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually those are
        the same as the two I posted to Stefan a couple of &gt; months ago (R U'
        L U2 R' U L')*2 and it's mirror. Yours are good, but &gt; people have
        different styles. The main difference there between using &gt; F and B
        instead of U and D is the angle of the left wrist and with F &gt; and B
        you can see what happening. &gt; &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt; David J &gt; Ah,
        yes I get it now, those are very nice indeed. I remember when I learnt
        that original (R U' L U2 R' U L')*2 and it's mirror and I didn't really
        like those algorithms. Then I found the version with U and D from
        Twistypuzzles' forum, and it was definitely faster for me. Your
        algorithms looks very promising, so maybe I have to update my algorithm
        repertoire ;)

        Hey all, this is Marcus. Since I am a financially-strained college

        want to create a website outlining some blindfold-cubing methods (for

        Hello Everyone I wanted to know what I averaged on move count for step
        4. Gille's site says 15 is about right. Mike- you said you averaged
        18-20? is that right? I took an avg of 100 and here it is. I solved slow
        enough to count my moves on all solves (1.5-2 moves/sec). [13, 13, 12,
        15, 12, (6), 20, 12, 13, 15, 11, 10, 16, 16, 14, 15, 14, 12, 13, 12 14,

        10, 17, 12, 17, 13, 8, 16] AVG 13.2 moves per solve I didn't know how
        many to omit so I just counted all 100 solves. I bracketed the highest 3
        and lowest 3 solves. High 3 were all 6 bad edges. Low 3 were lucky, OLL
        skip, PLL skip. 5 Interesting Solves in a Row: [(26), 18, 7, 16, 9] (26)
        was 6 bad edges, messed up orientation, had to orient twice. =( On the
        18, DB edge was done after orientation, so I decided to finish F2L
        (Mike) and ended up with a Zperm. On the 7, I oriented and inserted
        ledge and redge simultaneously, then a 3 Move PLL. Lucky. 16 standard
        solve. 2 bad edges On the 9 the ledge was already inserted, so I used
        the Ming Thai Alg for CCC. Or you could say I changed the defenition of
        orientation, did an M', and everything was oriented correctly. Scramble

        I took 2 avgs after my 100 cube marathon. 6.18, 5.02, 6.31, 7.31, 6.68,
        5.69, 6.56, 6.34, 5.09, 6.80, (4.23), (8.50) Avg 6.20 sec 4.95, 6.62,

        I figured that 100 cubes is a pretty good warm up. It was Very
        disappointing. I expected better times. I will say that I was very
        consistent though, especially on the first avg. 2nd avg had six sub 6
        solves, and then a 6.00 and a 6.06. Pretty good I guess. I usually see
        an Orientation pattern, ACT, and then take a second look, and permute
        all pieces. This time, I solved slower, and payed attention to where the
        ledge and redge were going. You can then mesh the Orientation and
        Permutation steps into 1. I always look for the quickest way to pair up
        the ledge and redge while orienting. Sometimes that means inserting the
        ledge into the redge's place temporarily. Or not inserting a ledge
        during orientation, to give yourself a better case. It's all about
        looking ahead I think, just like F2L. You can be much more efficient by
        going slower. Jason K PS If I timed this with the cube already in hand,
        I think my times would drop a lot. I may start doing this, but it just
        feels weird. How do you guys time LL avgs?

        The main thing with this method is that you have to be "adaptative"",

        wanted to know what I averaged on move count for step 4. Gille's &gt;
        site says 15 is about right. Mike- you said you averaged 18-20? is &gt;
        that right? Apparently not. That's what I thought it was, but I took
        some averages just now. 5 sets of 12, but I didn't know how many to get
        rid of, either. 19 13 18 17 14 16 9 15 14 17 14 16 = 15.17 13 17 10 16
        17 17 18 15 16 16 18 16 = 15.75 15 17 16 12 13 16 13 10 14 12 11 17 =
        13.83 16 15 14 13 12 14 14 19 12 18 18 15 = 15.00 11 16 4 18 16 19 16 14
        14 20 17 17 = 15.17 = 14.98 overall Out of curiosity, I decided to take
        some using what little I currently know of the strategy I proposed last
        night. I was somewhat surprised, considering how few ELL algs and
        F2l+orienting algs I know. Still, I did pretty well, and this only
        strengthens my suspicions that this is a viable method. 21 14 18 19 13
        16 19 18 16 14 15 23 = 17.17 22 18 19 17 13 13*20 19 17 17 12 18 = 17.08
        17 14 19 19 21 19 12 20 14 18 17 17 = 15.67 15 18 16 15 14 12 24 17 21
        17 20 9 = 16.50 14 20 14 12 11 15 16 12 17 18 18 19 = 15.50 =16.7
        overall Most of the solves were done DB edge, DF edge, orient U edges,
        place U edges. A few that I knew how were done DB edge, DF edge+orient U
        edges, place U edges. A few more were done with ELL after the DF edge,
        and some of them I did the DF and DB edges simultaneously. The 23 and 24
        were both long edge orientations and Z perms. The 13* should have been
        9, but I inserted DF and then pulled it right back out for the beginning
        of an easy ELL alg. I should have seen that coming. The 9 was an easy
        orientation with DB finished and left me with two pairs of edges to swap
        (R2F2R2F2R2F2). I did an average of 50 earlier 23.16 with a best average
        of 21.64. Considering that's only a little better than I generally do
        with standard Roux, and I've worked on that a lot lately and several
        months ago, I can't really complain for a first try. I'm very excited to
        see what times I'm capable of once I learn some more of the insertion
        and ELL algs. I'm still waiting for ACube volunteers, though. :) &gt;

        the Rubiks.com 5x5x5's are the best ones. Thy are more stable than the
        others. But of course the initial stiffness is a big setback. I hope
        that my correspondence with Seventowns will be fruitful. I have
        suggested some changes to the design. The reason many prefer mefferts or
        the old 80's wahn is cause they use screws and not rivets. I'd really
        love to see Seventowns switch to good machine screws so one can remove
        the tightness and also adjust the tension to ones liking easily. And
        also do those changes to the outer edges. Like i have seen on Grant
        Tregay's cube it makes the cube turn a whole lot nicer, probably
        eliminating many of the problems with twisting corner-centers and
        popping edge-centers and so on. Cause right now most ppl's worry w
        larger cubes is to get a good 5x5x5. A good 5x5x5 easily saves u 30 secs
        or more on a solve. I know this from experience. I could never get sub
        3:00 consistently on my old Wahn even after balancing the tension. The
        molding of the pieces was not really good. Well, the kind of 5x5x5
        really also depends a lot on cubing style. Im very dependent on a high
        turn-rate w my cage method. I gain solving time by faster recognition
        even if my solution is a bit longer than the pairing-up approach.

        Hehe...I know...I think I'll buy the Eastsheen, 'cause they're cheaper.
        I found both 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 for 26 dollars + 12 dollars for shipping =
        38 dollars the lowest I found for the Rubik's was 45 dollars for the
        cubes, excluding the shipping, that I don't know how much will
        be...well, I hope I'm lucky with the Eastsheen...Stefan told me they're
        pretty good, and Jon Morris said that he achieves the same times on both
        Rubik's and Eastsheen, so... But thanks to all of you who
        answered...maybe on the future I buy the others and can give my own

        Cracker Barrel is selling more of the "Magic Cube" 3x3x3, this time with
        green, red and white colored plastic. Maybe they have other colors, too,
        but that's all this store had. They cost $4.99. The mechansim and
        stickers are junk, but they look neat. The mechanism actually looks like
        it could be adapted to screws and springs. The centers have arches and
        there is a standard burr for the kernel. However they rotate about on
        plastic rivets. If you remove the rivets you might be able to retrofit
        with a proper mech. Photo here:

        you cannot find 5x rubik studio, just 4x. but I suspect that 4x studio
        is the same as 4x rubiks.com now I have 5x rubiks.com 4x rubik studio,
        4x mefferts, 5x mefferts. in general, mefferts are a lot easier to
        operate. Specially I found that 5x rubiks is hard to rotate the outer
        layers. in the other hand, mefferts works 100% from the first minute if
        lubed. With rubiks, you must wait until internal pieced are
        'self-sanded' with the use. I have never timed myself with mefferts
        cubes so I cannot give you any point about that. I like more the size of
        the rubik cubes than meffert's... hope this helps! Alberto [Non-text

        he achieves the same times on both Rubik's and Eastsheen, so... &gt;

        I've bought an Harry Potter 2x2x2 and tried most of my tricks for
        breaking it in, but it's still little more than awful. Does anyone know
        how to take it apart? I don't even now which mechanism it has. Is it the
        same as inte the regular Rubiks 2x2x2? Thanks /Gustav

        Hi :-) I just bought myself a cool kit of files that i will use for
        modifying cubes. The files are only 100 mm, not including the blue grip.
        Particularly, i gonna modify those wings/feet of the outer edges on the
        5x5x5 like i described in earlier post. Modification:
        http://vakt.idi.ntnu.no/apartment/Outer_edge_555_fit.jpg Toolkit:
        http://vakt.idi.ntnu.no/apartment/Fileset.jpg I will keep u updated how
        it goes :-) -Per PS! The set of files only costed me about $5 (less than
        ¬£3). In Norway/Sweden/Finland this set is available from Biltema. I'm
        sure Walmart and similar stores must have similar sets ...

        Thanx Per!! I was really great to do a time like that. I can tell you
        that it was a little lucky. I got a U turn as the third and last step of
        my method but the time would probably have been around 5 seconds without
        luck, because I did the first to steps in like 2.5-3 seconds and then
        became a little confused when it almost was solved. I'm most happy with
        the european record for one-handed solving which was not a lucky case,
        just a very fast F2L. I'm also very satisfied that I managed to take
        back the swedish record for 3*3*3 single from Lars Petrus. /Gunnar ---

        So we should all try the "Cube Mile". I think it would work well if it
        were like the "Beer Mile" (http://www.beermile.com/) but instead of
        drinking a beer before each lap, you solve a cube. I think sub-6 minutes
        should be possible (not by me.) I mean, you get slowed down by solving
        the cube, and so four cubes might take 80 seconds, but you can run
        faster because of the 20 seconds of rest between each 400. I'd be very
        happy to do sub-7. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology

      <div class="email-content">
        Ok. I've done some more experimenting, and I've come up with a few new
        ideas. Because Gilles' method uses opposite color solving for the F2B,
        and because we've heard so much from Chris Hardwick lately about
        opposite color (and it works), I decided to try to apply this to my new
        Step 4 idea. For the last step, you can start by either inserting the DB
        pair, or use the DB pair for the opposite color, and finish your solve
        with an M2. I tried this a lot tonight, and it went much better than I
        was afraid of. The only thing I really had problems with was recognizing
        which pieces to permute with certain ELL cases, but since I only know a
        few ELL cases anyway, I think I'll chalk it up to that. :) My best time
        using this was a 16.42. Not lucky, in that I inserted one edge easier
        using my opposite color, inserted the second, and finished with an ELL
        case. All three substeps totalled about 14 moves, which is a little
        better than average for that scenario. There are really 4 separate
        scenarios for solves this way. The first is when all the edges are
        oriented after inserting DB. Ideally, I would like to learn the 16 or so
        cases to finish off the edges. They're all relatively short and easy to
        accomplish using only MU moves. They average under 7 moves per alg. All
        but 4 or so are very easy to recognize, and the final 4 I have some
        ideas for. This should come up nearly 15% of cases, if you can start
        with any of the 4 M edges for DB. This is by far the nicest option,
        because of how short and quick the algs are, but also the least
        frequent. Placing the DB edge intelligently, though, we can get this
        more often. The second special scenario is when the DF edge places
        itself, or is very simple to place after the DB edge. This leaves you
        with an ELL case to finish. I believe the ELL's average around 12 moves
        to finish. Again, also this step uses only MU moves, and is incredibly
        quick. Using the few ELL's I know, I managed a 15.02 and a 15.92,
        neither of which were lucky at all. Both were 3 short substeps.
        Considering my best non lucky is a 14.33 with a ZB case I know, I'd say
        a 15.02 on my second day isn't too bad. :) That's actually .65 seconds
        faster than my fastest normal Roux time ever. The third special case
        group is much less frequent than the first two, and comprises all of the
        miscellaneous cases I've found that are easier and faster than the other
        ways. Good examples are (M'U)*4 and various others built from that.
        Speaking of which, Jason, what do you think of U' (L U' l') U (M'U)*3 (L
        U L') U? Others that fall into this category are M2U2M2U2, ME2M'E2, etc.
        This group will hopefully be much more full once I figure out some nicer
        optimizations. Gilles, I'd really like to know how you found your
        special cases for step 4. I think I may be able to adapt some of them to
        this. There are certainly some unpleasant cases that come up, and I'd
        like to see if I can shorten them at all. The last group is the normal
        group of solves. In these, you place DB, then place DF and orient the
        remaining 5 edges, then finish the LL edges. This is where the most
        difficult cases are, and also some of the nicest. The first substep is
        placing the DB edge, and averages 3.5 moves, but if you start with any
        of the 4 possible DB edges, this drops to under 3. Sometimes it works
        well to perform a d2 after this step, if you actually have to place the
        edge to DF. Next, inserting the DF edge while orienting edges averages
        6.5 moves, but I have some ideas about how to shorten that. When placing
        the DB edge, it's often possible to either influence the orientation to
        your liking, either by preserving a good one, or swapping a bad one. 50%
        of the time, this only requires adjusting the U face to insert from the
        opposite side. The cases I'm having trouble finding good ways to fix are
        when the DB edge is properly oriented prior to insertion. The only good
        ways to insert it also preserve orientation of the other 5 edges. This
        is something I need to work on. Finally, you need only permute the LL
        edges, averaging ~6.75 moves. A possible route to take involves always
        achieving an easy orientation with the DB edge, so that you can orient
        the remaining 5 and permute them all at once. There are really only 6
        possible orientations after the DB edge is placed. 1 is correctly
        oriented, another is 3 edges on top (the 'magical' orientation from
        Gilles' method). The first takes zero moves, obviously, and the second
        takes 3 (or 4, if you need to AUF). Incorrect adjacent edges takes at
        least 7 moves to orient, incorrect opposite edges takes a minimum of 9.
        All 4 U edges incorrect is an unfriendly case requiring at least 12, but
        for all of these groups, the ELL's are about as good as it gets. The
        cases that are tricky are the ones with DF and UF incorrect. These cases
        can be changed to correct orientation in 7 moves, or inserted with
        correct orientation in 8. This leaves you a L5E option with an average
        of 7, but worse recognition, or an EPLL for 1 extra move and easier
        recognition. Things to think about. I spent most of work tonight
        figuring out average move counts for the steps, and working out the odds
        of nice cases. With practice, you can place any of the DB edges in under
        3, finish the L5E if they're oriented in under 7, finish with ELL if the
        F2L comes up solved in 12, or finish the normal way in 13, but the
        latter two can be lessened considerably if you wisely insert the DB
        edge, and choose the nicest edge to start with. Starting with any of the
        4 possible DB edges gives you an almost 16% chance for an O5E skip, a
        34% chance for an easy F2L finish, and leaves you with under half of the
        cases giving you a 'normal' solve, because that option needs the most
        optimizing still. Going with these odds, one can average around 15 moves
        quite easily with this method. Going slowly (because I'm still learning
        most of the algs ;P) I took some average move counts earlier. 13 17 16
        12 17 13 20 17 20 7* = 15.2 10 12 18 11 16 18 17 15 15 13 = 14.5 12 12
        16 13 17 16 17 11 18 18 = 15.0 = 14.9 overall * was an OLL skip after
        placing DB. With more ELL's and better P5E, I think this will drop
        nicely. If nothing else, the 15.02 was exciting enough to convince me to
        press on with this, even if it turns out to be less efficient or slower
        than what's already out there. Still, I'm convinced this step can be
        sub-4 pretty well. At least....in theory. ;P Anyone with ideas,
        criticism, suggestions, etc, please post. Gilles and Jason especially.

        Hi :-) I just realised it's better to do the edge 3-cycle before the u-
        turn, like this : R U' F - F' r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 - u F' U R' F - F'
        cancels to give this very neat solution : R U' r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 u

        Well, that's the first commercial that they've aired so far, and only
        the guy with the "vomiting butterflies" and the "I like pictures in

        It's funny that the centers are cycles clockwise (looking from the top),
        and the edges anti-clockwise. Now add an H permutation and you have a
        very nice pattern :p (swap the opposite edges on the top layer). it's
        some sort of 'Arc de Triomphe' (the monument in Paris):D Gilles

        Hi :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just realised it's
        better to do the edge 3-cycle before the u- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turn,
        like this : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R U' F - F' r F' L2
        F r' F' L2 F2 - u F' U R' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F - F'
        cancels to give this very neat solution : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; R U' r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 u F' U R' (17 htm, 14 stm) &gt;

        Hi Gilles !! It's not hard find these if u understand the nature of
        inner slice turns. They cycle 4 centers and 4 edges. So u know how many
        edges that u have to "fix" after such a turn. And you insert edges into
        the slice as needed. Oh, and 25 yrs of cubing experience and fewest
        moves does help a lot :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        leave an easy 3-cycle of edges - in 2 out of 12 cases you leave the

        = (44 + 28 + 16 + 7)/12 = 95/12 = 7.916666 Is this correct? ELL Move

        wanted to again ask about these categories. The Only ones I know for
        sure are PELL = 8 and Step 4 = 13.2, because I calculated myself. Bob,
        you gave me 9 and 14 for CLL/COLL, I think. Has anybody calculated CLL,
        COLL, OLL, PLL, ELL, PELL, but taking into account the chance or

        7.916666 &gt; &gt; Is this correct? Yes, it is. If you used optimal
        algs, it would be 11(7)/12. ;) My PELLs though are [8(11) + 2(9) +
        7]/12, so I have a 9.4 move average for this step. For me, PLL averages
        11.9 moves (using the ones listed on my PLL page). However, this is a
        75% chance of having to AUF after a PLL, so it is actually 12.65 moves
        on average for my PLL. My COLL move average (again, using the ones on my
        page) is 9.22 moves. This takes into the probabilities of each case and
        a 1/27 chance to skip OLL, assuming you orient all edges during F2L.
        &gt; ELL Move Count 12? STM, right? &gt; PELL Move Count 8? For me, 9.4
        &gt; CLL Move Count 9? Probably less &gt; COLL Move Count 14? For me, 9
        moves &gt; I wanted to again ask about these categories. The Only ones I

        occurance of each case? Have I done that &gt; correctly with PELL? The
        figures I just gave take into account chance of occurance. I calculated
        my OLL algorithm average, too. Here is my summary: OLL - 9.68 moves PLL
        - 11.9 moves + .75 = 12.65 COLL - 9.22 moves EPLL - 9.4 moves + .75 =
        10.15 Again, this is based on the algorithms I use, not optimal ones. ~

        Depending on the amount of time you have, you can optimize more. From 48
        to &lt;28. I took probably about 1.5 min for each cube(including
        Preinspection, Recognition, Execution, Counting Moves, and Recording
        Moves for Each Step), So I was real pleased with 45 moves/cube. I was
        also psyched when I saw how closely the Step 4 avg matched my avg of
        100. 13.3 compared to 13.2, respectively. I think that this is one of
        the most effecient systems out there, in terms of moves. Now I just need
        to figure out what's taking me so long to do it. Jason K Sorry about the

        Instead of doing CLL and then the DB edge, I was thinking it might be
        better to: -Insert DB edge and orient edges -Insert DF edge and orient
        corners -PLL I don't use Gille's method AT ALL, but I've been messing
        around with methods that produce lower move counts. I don't actually
        know if this is lower, I haven't checked and I have waaay to much to do
        right now. I have about half of the algs for DF edge and corners
        orientation if you want them, they average around 10 moves, and a lot of
        them are mostly two generator. -James Stuber _____ From:

        Possible Roux method improvements Hello all, I've been playing around
        with the Roux method a lot lately, and I've decided it needs as much
        attention and perfecting as Fridrich and company are getting. :) To that
        end, I've been trying to find ways to speed the Last 6 edges (and 4
        centers) up, and thinking a lot about several variations of the normal
        method. First, there's unconstrained centers. This can shorten some of
        the hardest orientation situations from 12 moves down to 5 or 6, but the
        recognition seems akin to ZB to me. I need more practice with this,
        definitely, but I think that it may take too much time, even with
        mastery. (sorry, Gilles) The whole Step 4 method takes something like 18
        moves on average, if my math is anywhere near correct. Instead of
        orienting and permuting L6E, what if we were to finish off DF and DB
        edges, then complete the cube with ELL? The hardest situations for
        finishing the two edges should be around 7 moves, with the average being
        somewhere around 6. ELL averages about 12 moves, so that puts the method
        in similar standing to the normal way. But what if we only finish off
        the DB edge? It can only be in 6 places, each place having 2 possible
        orientations. Thus, 12 simple cases, 11 of which are 5 moves or fewer.
        The average move count should be about 3.5, with the hardest situations
        at 7. You don't need to orient centers prior to this step, either. And
        recognition is very simple. The hardest case to spot is when the piece
        is already correct. :) After this, we could use any of the 22 possible
        cases found here: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/NewAlgSet.html
        This would give us an average of under 7 moves to place the DF edge and
        orient the LL edges, leaving us with an edge PLL step, as in COLL. As
        edge PLL's average 7 moves, our previous step averages 6.5 or so, and
        our first step at 3.5, this gives us around 17 again. The benefits?
        Aside from the 1/12 chance for a PLL skip, and the extremely easy to
        recognize and execute EPLL step, you never need to change your grip, and
        after the DF and DB edges are placed, you never need to adjust the M
        slice. Also, there are a number of lucky cases to exploit. There are
        only 29 or so unique cases for when the edges come up correctly oriented
        after placing DB. There are some very fast cases for when edges are
        correctly placed but incorrectly oriented, and learning the ELL algs can
        help out nicely for the 1/10 of cases where the DF edge completes itself
        along with DB. The worst case scenario is 26 moves to finish, and comes
        up roughly 1/2880 cases, while the odds for a 4 move or fewer solution
        are 1/72. When someone gets an OLL or PLL skip with Fridrich, the solve
        is usually in the low 40's for the number of moves. A PLL skip with COLL
        will probably be between 40 and 45. A very nice ZB solve may be in the
        mid to high 30's. With good 1x2x3's and a nice CLL case (like FRUR'U'F'
        or B' R'FR B R'F'R), a sub or low 30's move solve is a good possibility.
        Something like 1/312 solves (more once I learn more CLL's instead of
        slow COLL's :P) If anyone is interested in hearing more about this, or
        helping me to further this approach, please let me know. I could
        definitely use the services of someone who is good with ACube. Anyway,
        that's what's going through my head right now. Gilles, Jason, and
        others, what do you think? -Mike team [zb] SPONSORED LINKS Jigsaw

        My COLL &gt; move average (again, using the ones on my page) is 9.22
        moves. This &gt; takes into the probabilities of each case and a 1/27
        chance to skip &gt; OLL, assuming you orient all edges during F2L. &gt;
        &gt; OLL - 9.68 moves &gt; PLL - 11.9 moves + .75 = 12.65 &gt; COLL -
        9.22 moves &gt; EPLL - 9.4 moves + .75 = 10.15 Bob, For Your 1/27 chance
        of skip OLL, Have you taken into account that only 1/6 of these will be
        a true COLL skip? 1/162 chance of COLL skips, is that right? If you're
        using OE, COLL, PELL, and you don't know PLL, then an OLL skip doesn't
        help you unless it's a COLL skip. Also, I averaged Just the 15 perfect
        sequences for COLL on Lars Petrus' website and came up with 10.6666
        moves avg. It's hard for me to believe that COLL is only 9 moves avg.
        Seems like it should be more... Jason K

        learn more of them. At the moment I'm really only using probably half a
        dozen of them, and using COLL for the vast majority of cases. I really
        should work on that. &gt; &gt; Has anybody calculated CLL, COLL, OLL,
        PLL, ELL, PELL, but taking into &gt; &gt; account the chance or
        occurance of each case? Have I done that &gt; &gt; correctly with PELL?
        To correctly weight them, you should take each case and count the
        average number of moves. Add all of them together except the Double Sune
        cases. Double that. Then add the Double Sune cases together, and
        quadruple that. Now, divide by the number of algs. It should be 88. This
        should work for both CLL and COLL. ELL should average about 12, if you
        use MU algs, and less if you use more optimal ones. And who cares about
        OLL algs? ;P -Mike

        &gt; &gt; I was really great to do a time like that. I can tell you that
        it &gt; &gt; was a little lucky. I got a U turn as the third and last
        step of &gt; my &gt; &gt; method but the time would probably have been
        around 5 seconds &gt; &gt; without luck, because I did the first to
        steps in like 2.5-3 &gt; seconds &gt; &gt; and then became a little
        confused when it almost was solved. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm most happy
        with the european record for one-handed solving &gt; which &gt; &gt; was
        not a lucky case, just a very fast F2L. I'm also very &gt; satisfied
        &gt; &gt; that I managed to take back the swedish record for 3*3*3
        single &gt; from &gt; &gt; Lars Petrus. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /Gunnar &gt;

        Edge algs are very useful to me now. Here are all that I can think of.
        Position is not really a factor, Im mostly concerned with orientation.
        If anyone is not familiar with this numbering system for edges, its very
        simple. 1-4 is the U layer. 5-8 is the middle layer. 9-12 is the D
        layer. 1, 5, and 9 Start on the F slice, and you move clockwise as
        viewed from above. So UF-1 UL-2 UB-3 UR-4 DF-9 DB-11. These are the only
        ones I'm really concerned with. ELLs 14: (FR'F')lU RU'R 13:

        L2 &lt;---OLD SCHOOL My favorite of the pureflips is (RBR'U)5, and its
        so close to what I need. I need a quick way to flip 1,2,3,5,9,11.
        Position is not a factor, and I don't care if its all M and U. I'd
        actually prefer something similar to (RBR'U)5... Jason K

        &gt; Congrats on averaging 13 moves for step 4! Dont you love when you
        get a 6-7 move step 4? THats very Close to my Avgs, especially CLL and
        Step 4. I think that This whole system averages less moves than Petrus
        any variation of CFOP, for sure. Doing F2B in 25 is pretty easy, so 8-9
        for CLL + 12-13 for Step 4, you're always in the 40s. Just hard to
        recognize everything quickly. Jason K

        what you were looking for, but that one flips the edges you want. It's
        not a pure flip however ... and you may find it too long ;-) That's the

        not hard find these if u understand the nature of inner slice &gt;
        turns. They cycle 4 centers and 4 edges. So u know how many edges &gt;
        that u have to "fix" after such a turn. And you insert edges into &gt;
        the slice as needed. Oh, and 25 yrs of cubing experience and fewest &gt;
        moves does help a lot :-) &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I just realised it's better to do the edge 3-cycle before &gt; the
        u- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turn, like this : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R U' F - F' r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 - u F' U R'
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F - F' cancels to give
        this very neat solution : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; R U' r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 u F' U R' (17 htm, 14 stm) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess that's my best shot ;-)

        you're using OE, COLL, PELL, and you don't &gt; know PLL, then an OLL
        skip doesn't help you unless it's a COLL skip. I realize that only 1/162
        is a true COLL skip, but I went under the assumption that anybody who
        learned COLL did so after learning PLL, so they would use PLL for those
        1/27 cases. &gt; Also, I averaged Just the 15 perfect sequences for COLL
        on Lars &gt; Petrus' website and came up with 10.6666 moves avg. It's
        hard for me &gt; to believe that COLL is only 9 moves avg. Seems like it
        should be more... Well, if you don't trust my numbers, you can verify
        yourself. I list all of my COLL algorithms here:
        http://www.cubewhiz.com/coll.html Multiply the number of moves for every
        algorithm by 4 except the Double-sune (H) ones, those get multiplied by
        2. Then add them up and divide by 162. I consider a PLL case to be a
        COLL skip using this method. Many of the COLL algorithms are only 7 or 8
        moves, so I believe the number is right, but you can verify if you want.

        Hi :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just realised
        it's better to do the edge 3-cycle before the u- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; turn, like this : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        R U' F - F' r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 - u F' U R' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F - F' cancels to give this very neat solution
        : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R U' r F' L2 F r' F'
        L2 F2 u F' U R' (17 htm, 14 stm) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I guess that's my best shot ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Even Stefan knows that one ;-) Here's my way of doing that &gt; one :
        &gt; &gt; F' R' B' F L' F' u F L F' B R F &gt; &gt; or &gt; &gt; F' R'
        f' D' F' r' F D f R F (14-htm, 11-stm) &gt; &gt; The first 5 moves are
        setup moves for what the r' does. &gt; &gt; [Actually i normally do it

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just realised
        it's better to do the edge 3-cycle before &gt; the u- &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; turn, like this : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R U' F - F' r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 - u F' U R' &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F - F' cancels to
        give this very neat solution : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        just realised it's better to do the edge 3-cycle &gt; before &gt; &gt;
        the u- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turn, like this : &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R U' F - F'
        r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 - u F' U R' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F - F' cancels to give this very neat
        solution : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; R U' r F' L2 F r' F' L2 F2 u F' U R' (17 htm, 14 stm) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess
        that's my best shot ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Haha Gilles :D Sacre bleu ;-) I'm sure u are aware of inverses right?
        So, go ahead inverse my algorithms. I'm not gonna charge you ... lol ...
        In fact, in all cases u can do some mirrored algorithm instead. But i
        know that u know that also :D But the axis of mirroring is not the same
        for all 4 cases ... -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; Yo! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I realised only one case was left now so

        -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS! Since lower case here are inner slice

        &gt; &gt; It's funny that the centers are cycles clockwise (looking from
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; top), and the edges anti-clockwise.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now add an H permutation and you
        have a very nice pattern :p &gt; &gt; (swap &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; opposite edges on the top layer). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's

        ;-) I'm sure u are aware of inverses right? So, go ahead &gt; inverse my

        all cases u can do some mirrored algorithm instead. But &gt; i know that
        u know that also :D But the axis of mirroring is not the &gt; same for

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Now add an H permutation and you have a very nice pattern
        :p &gt; &gt; &gt; (swap &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        opposite edges on the top layer). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's some

        Championships have been closed, but US2006 was open. Why is this? ~ Bob

        There will be two competitions: The US Championships and an Open
        competition. US Citizens can compete for the United States Champion
        title. International competitors will be in the open bracket and can set
        official times, but cannot take the US Title. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        I don't want to close off the US 2006 competition because I'd like to
        encourage participation from everyone. Sure, the competition is about
        finding the fastest United States cuber, but there's no reason we can't
        let other people join in on the fun. We'll keep the competition results
        separate so that the media doesn't get confused. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Hi Matt, That hasn't been decided yet. It should be noted, however, that
        the international competition will be probably much harder. There's this
        guy, I don't know if you've heard of him, but his name is Macky, and
        he's from Japan. Other than that, in the end, I'd be fine with comparing
        all of the averages and awarding some type of prize to the fastest final
        round average, but it should be noted the prizes won't be cash prizes as
        we don't have that type of money. At most, Mark Sullivan will take you
        on a ride in a pond in a swan boat. Or something like that. People may
        have gone to WC 2005 to win money or prizes, but I'm really hoping that
        isn't the focus of our competition. US Nationals will provide a very
        high level of competition and a very competitive atmosphere while
        bringing in people certainly from all around the United States‚Äîthat's
        our main goal. (I wish we had $10,000 to spare.) Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Hey Tyson, Hah. I was just curious. I am aware of the elite out there
        and their abilty to destroy many people in competition...but you never
        know 5 lucky solves could happen... Regardless, I hope that I can go on
        a ride in a swan boat! ha. I hope to attend but I will never just go to
        a competition and isolate myself from other cubers and sabotage them. I
        enjoyed metting all the cubers at WC2005 and hope to meet evyone again.
        The time I spent with the cubers in WC2005 was well...a few days
        compared to the few hours of competing. The competition is a small part.
        If I had a spare 10 grand, I think the cubing community would be the
        first to know. MATT

        1/27 chance of skip OLL, Have you taken into account that &gt; &gt; only
        1/6 of these will be a true COLL skip? 1/162 chance of COLL &gt; &gt;
        skips, is that right? If you're using OE, COLL, PELL, and you don't &gt;
        &gt; know PLL, then an OLL skip doesn't help you unless it's a COLL
        skip. &gt; &gt; I realize that only 1/162 is a true COLL skip, but I
        went under the &gt; assumption that anybody who learned COLL did so
        after learning PLL, so &gt; they would use PLL for those 1/27 cases.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I averaged Just the 15 perfect sequences for COLL
        on Lars &gt; &gt; Petrus' website and came up with 10.6666 moves avg.
        It's hard for me &gt; &gt; to believe that COLL is only 9 moves avg.
        Seems like it should be &gt; more... &gt; &gt; Well, if you don't trust
        my numbers, you can verify yourself. I list &gt; all of my COLL
        algorithms here: &gt; http://www.cubewhiz.com/coll.html &gt; &gt;
        Multiply the number of moves for every algorithm by 4 except the &gt;
        Double-sune (H) ones, those get multiplied by 2. Then add them up and
        &gt; divide by 162. I consider a PLL case to be a COLL skip using this
        &gt; method. Many of the COLL algorithms are only 7 or 8 moves, so I
        &gt; believe the number is right, but you can verify if you want. :)
        &gt; &gt; ~ Bob &gt; BOB I got really bored and did it. If you account
        for the True COLL skip then you have to add 0(1), 9(4), and 14(1) before
        you divide by 162. THis leaves you with a 9.777777777 move avg for COLL.
        Treating these cases as COLL skips, and adding nothing for these 6
        cases, I got a 9.49 move avg for your COLL. Either way, it is pretty
        impressive. I thought for some reason that COLL was Longer. I will for
        sure learn COLL in addition to CLL(Probably from your pages) =) Jason
        Kovacic PS. How do I tell which 2 corners need to switch? Other than
        doing the inverse of the algs... I use Red on top.

        Hey everyone, I haven't done this in a long time and figured I would try
        it again. I was solving when I came across a good scramble and got a
        good time. The scramble was: L2 D' B' U2 B L2 R2 D F D U R2 F R' F U' R
        U' L' D2 B2 L' B R D' and my times was 12.69 which I am very happy with.
        Well I then did a prepared solve average, where I did an average of 10
        but using this same scramble for all 12 solves. My average was 9.39
        seconds: (12.16) 09.67 09.53 08.39 09.02 (07.86) 10.12 10.35 07.92 09.94
        09.62 09.29 = 9.39 I then continued for a best rolling average and got
        8.09 seconds 08.53, (07.11), 08.00, (09.15), 08.89, 07.24, 08.67, 07.13,
        07.48, 09.05, 08.02, 07.93 = 8.09 My best execution of my solution so
        far is 6.72 seconds. My solution is 37 moves after cancellations from
        the end of one step being the inverse move of the beginning of the next
        (which I didn't catch in my first real solve). This solve is not lucky
        either, and has a regular 2 look Fridrich LL (though a fast one). If you
        know my solving style, you'll know how I started this solve, and the
        rest is very obvious. See what you guys can do, this scramble rocks!

        Yeah, that's totally true. I mean, I was never meant to solve a cube in
        12.89 either. The rides in the swan boats hopefully will happen if we
        ever go back to Dallas, TX. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        know 5 &gt; lucky solves could happen... &gt; &gt; Regardless, I hope
        that I can go on a ride in a swan boat! ha. I hope &gt; to attend but I
        will never just go to a competition and isolate myself &gt; from other
        cubers and sabotage them. I enjoyed metting all the cubers &gt; at
        WC2005 and hope to meet evyone again. The time I spent with the &gt;
        cubers in WC2005 was well...a few days compared to the few hours of &gt;
        competing. The competition is a small part. &gt; &gt; If I had a spare
        10 grand, I think the cubing community would be the &gt; first to know.

        result was 19.98, and the times were 18.80, 20.48, 18.45, 21.25,
        (21.83), 21.48, 19.95, 18.00, 21.48, 20.08, 19.86, (17.67). I'm
        sooooooooooo happy with this. Is like my gift for 6 months of
        cubing...hehe... so, I want to thank all who helped me with algs,
        advices and all. Thank you very much! Oh, and it's not the end...I'm
        coming to catch you all, you sub-15ers...(evil

        haven't done this in a long time and figured I would try it again. &gt;
        &gt; I was solving when I came across a good scramble and got a good
        time. &gt; &gt; The scramble was: &gt; L2 D' B' U2 B L2 R2 D F D U R2 F
        R' F U' R U' L' D2 B2 L' B R D' &gt; &gt; and my times was 12.69 which I
        am very happy with. &gt; &gt; Well I then did a prepared solve average,
        where I did an average of 10 &gt; but using this same scramble for all
        12 solves. &gt; &gt; My average was 9.39 seconds: &gt; (12.16) 09.67
        09.53 08.39 09.02 (07.86) 10.12 10.35 07.92 09.94 09.62 &gt; 09.29 =
        9.39 &gt; &gt; I then continued for a best rolling average and got 8.09
        seconds &gt; 08.53, (07.11), 08.00, (09.15), 08.89, 07.24, 08.67, 07.13,
        07.48, &gt; 09.05, 08.02, 07.93 = 8.09 &gt; &gt; My best execution of my
        solution so far is 6.72 seconds. &gt; &gt; My solution is 37 moves after
        cancellations from the end of one step &gt; being the inverse move of
        the beginning of the next (which I didn't &gt; catch in my first real
        solve). This solve is not lucky either, and &gt; has a regular 2 look
        Fridrich LL (though a fast one). &gt; &gt; If you know my solving style,
        you'll know how I started this solve, &gt; and the rest is very obvious.
        &gt; &gt; See what you guys can do, this scramble rocks! &gt; &gt; Chris

        No, that's not true. The German OPEN was open, but the German
        Championships were closed. I was there, and I scrambled cubes for the

        with a &gt; 9.777777777 move avg for COLL. &gt; Treating these cases as
        COLL skips, and adding nothing for these 6 &gt; cases, I got a 9.49 move
        avg for your COLL. Either way, it is pretty &gt; impressive. I thought
        for some reason that COLL was Longer. COLL is nice and short. :) I
        calculated 9.22, but I could have made a mistake. I agree with you for
        adding that 9*4 + 14 first if you do not know PLL, but the original
        purpose of COLL was for the VH system (I think?), which is an extension
        of the Fridrich system. &gt; I will for sure learn COLL in addition to
        CLL(Probably from your pages) =) Cool. Good luck. :) I believe a bunch
        of the cases are the same. &gt; PS. How do I tell which 2 corners need
        to switch? Other than doing &gt; the inverse of the algs... I use Red on
        top. Well, I don't actually look at which ones need to switch. I use a
        variant of the "sticker recognition" system. There are links to other
        COLL pages that describe it at the bottom of my COLL page. I describe
        the recognition I look for for every case on my page, too. If you
        already know CLL recognition, though, you can still use that. ~ Bob

        Hi David :-) The counting u do there is sqtm counting, not htm. In htm
        both B2 and B have length 1, but inner slice turns are length 2 in htm,
        unlike in stm or sqtm ;-) That would seem to make ur algorithm 23 moves,
        but B2 f' and f B2 are only 2 moves due to cancellation ;-) So F is 1
        move in all metrics (htm,qtm,stm,sqtm). And f2 is 2 moves in htm, 4
        moves in qtm, 1 in stm and 2 in sqtm. (Here f2 = S2) [htm = half turn
        metric stm = slice turn metric qtm = quarter turn metric sqtm = slice
        quarter turn metric] Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Hi :-) Ok, here's a slightly different case: R2 u R' U D F' (L2 D2)*3 F
        U' D' R' (17-htm, 16-stm) With another u' at the end it's cool middle
        layer alg, but i like it better without it. Oh, and i can of course
        postpone the first R2 to have this one: u R' U D F' (L2 D2)*3 F U' D' R

        &gt; &gt; In fact, in all cases u can do some mirrored algorithm

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's funny that the centers are cycles

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; top), and the edges anti-clockwise. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now add
        an H permutation and you have a very nice &gt; pattern :p &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; opposite edges on the top layer). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; it's some sort of 'Arc de Triomphe' (the monument in &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The counting u do there is sqtm counting, not htm.
        In htm both B2 &gt; &gt; and B have length 1, but inner slice turns are
        length 2 in htm, &gt; &gt; unlike in stm or sqtm ;-) That would seem to
        make ur algorithm 23 &gt; &gt; moves, but B2 f' and f B2 are only 2
        moves due to cancellation ;- ) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So F is 1 move in all
        metrics (htm,qtm,stm,sqtm). &gt; &gt; And f2 is 2 moves in htm, 4 moves
        in qtm, 1 in stm and 2 in sqtm. &gt; &gt; (Here f2 = S2) &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; [htm = half turn metric &gt; &gt; stm = slice turn metric &gt; &gt;

        Hi Chris! My "5 minute" solution is like this : B F2 L [B L L' B&gt;] B2
        R' B' L R B R B' F R D R' D' F' [U' U] B' D' B U' B' D B (R' B2 R F2 )*2
        (32-htm,31-stm,38-qtm) This is ending with 5 corners, not insertion
        optimised in any way. What is your exact 37-move solution ?? Have fun!

        U' L' D2 B2 L' B R D' &gt; &gt; and my times was 12.69 which I am very
        happy with. &gt; &gt; Well I then did a prepared solve average, where I
        did an average of 10 &gt; but using this same scramble for all 12
        solves. &gt; &gt; My average was 9.39 seconds: &gt; (12.16) 09.67 09.53
        08.39 09.02 (07.86) 10.12 10.35 07.92 09.94 09.62 &gt; 09.29 = 9.39 &gt;
        &gt; I then continued for a best rolling average and got 8.09 seconds
        &gt; 08.53, (07.11), 08.00, (09.15), 08.89, 07.24, 08.67, 07.13, 07.48,

        solution so far is 6.72 seconds. &gt; &gt; My solution is 37 moves after
        cancellations from the end of one step &gt; being the inverse move of
        the beginning of the next (which I didn't &gt; catch in my first real
        solve). This solve is not lucky either, and &gt; has a regular 2 look
        Fridrich LL (though a fast one). &gt; &gt; If you know my solving style,
        you'll know how I started this solve, &gt; and the rest is very obvious.

        there is at least one way, using the idea you sure had for the X- cross:
        F'LF BUB' L' (quite self-explicit) oh, then from this start you can
        solve the two remaining pairs with a nice 2-gen 14-moves sequence,

        Hey everyone, Yeah Craig beat me to the punch :-D I was showing Craig
        some F2L tricks, and I speedsolved this scramble before we ran through
        it together so I could say what I realistically did while speedsolving.
        Watch out for Craig man, his F2L is getting very very nice :-) Yes that
        was my F2L, and the LL is a P OLL case and the 7 PLL case. Here is how I
        executed it to solve in 6.72 seconds: y' L (B') (R D2) R y (L' U2) (L' U
        L U' L') [U' d'] (R U R') d (R U' R2) d' (L' U L) [d U] (R U2) (R' F R U
        R' U') (R' F' R2 U') That's a sustained 5.5 moves per second turning
        rate :-D It surprised me that a Fridrich solve could be sub-7 seconds
        with practice. Though there's no way that could be done with a high-30
        move solution as a real solve though. I was turning so fast I couldn't
        even follow the pieces, I was just acting on muscle memory. My 7 PLL is
        low 2.xx on a good execution, so often I was getting the F2L and OLL in
        4 seconds, so I imagine I was doing F2L in 3 seconds sometimes :-D That
        is of course from muscle memory, but it was nice to have a horrible LL
        lockup, and still get an 8 second solve :-D I can definitely see how I
        can speed up my F2L after doing this though. Try executing it that way
        and see what you think, it's craaaaaazy fast. Chris --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's funny that the centers are
        cycles clockwise &gt; (looking &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; top), and the
        edges anti-clockwise. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now add an H permutation and you have a
        very nice &gt; &gt; pattern :p &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (swap &gt;

        ah, I was wondering why your alg was giving &gt; &gt; something &gt;

        &gt; I just realised it's better to do the edge 3- &gt; &gt; cycle &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        u- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turn,

        &gt; &gt; &gt; F - F' cancels to give this very neat &gt; solution :
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hello Everyone I just got my DIY cubes via UPS today. I have been using
        my studio cube and a 25th anniversary cube with cubesmith stickers
        forever. 1. The centers I got this time are different that the ones I
        got last time. THere are no tabs, and the centers *almost* stay in on
        their own. Is there any way to avoid Gluing them in there? I want to be
        able to take them off. 2. For the plastic, black washers, there is a
        convex side and a totally flat side. Which side should face the spring?
        These washers are just for the bottom, right? 3. Some of my corner
        pieces came assembled, but a few came without a certain piece. You have
        to put it in yourself. But I cant seem to get the piece to be flush with
        the corner. Has anyone else experienced this? 4. Final Question: What's
        a good ballpark guideline on how tight to tighten the screws? 2 previous
        DIYs got loose really quickly, and I couldn't adjust the tension, b/c i
        had superglued the caps on. I feel like I should have started off making
        them super tight.

        I forgot where I read it, but instead of gluing the caps, you can use
        paper. Cut out a + of paper, such that you have one arm of the cross
        overhanging each side of the center. Push the center cap in, and the
        paper will be pushed down and create a tighter fit along the edges.
        Simple tear or cut any excess paper that is sticking out after you are
        done. Hope that helps, -Evan Until next time, Happy cubing

        Hi everybody!! I've only been practicing one-handed solving seriosly for
        like 6 weeks and yesterday I broke my average record with almost 3
        seconds and reached 8th place in the world!!! I'm so exited!! :-D Avg:

        cases with one hand so there is a LOT of room for improvement. I think
        that as soon as I learn some more OLLs I may be able to average sub-35.
        I'm putting a lot of effort into one-handed solving right now to be able
        to compete with the fastest guys (not Ryan; his times are impossible to
        beat). /Gunnar

        Hi Gunnar, Congratulations! I've been one-handing for ever (!) and my
        best average is only a couple of seconds faster. I recently got my first
        sub-30seconds single solve - which given my two-handed average is only
        just under 30 seconds is quite surprising. I fear one day I may be
        faster with one hand than two! Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From:

        Hi All Just a progress update. I am pretty much solving full time with
        my L2L2 strategy now. Although my times are still slower until I get
        faster at the recognition/selection process, my average number of moves
        per solve is a lot less now. I did 10 solves recently at 52-53 moves
        which is probably close to the right figure. Number of moves is mostly
        reliant on getting the cross plus two corners in as few moves as
        possible - or if you were to choose a different approach for the start -
        F2L less two middle edges. There may still be room for improvement in
        this - I've been thinking of spending some time on Chris' X-cross work
        to see if anything is applicable. Also Paul Nixon has tried starting
        with the Petrus 3x2x2 but got bogged down. I don't know this but it may
        offer another way to start L2L solves. Any comments or suggestions more
        than welcome :) Duncan

        cases with one hand so there is a LOT of room for improvement. I think
        that as soon as I learn some more OLLs I may be able to average sub-35.
        I'm putting a lot of effort into one-handed solving right now to be able
        to compete with the fastest guys (not Ryan; his times are impossible to

        &gt; Fourth Pair (FR): d R U' R' &gt; &gt; (this was the solution I came
        up with (i'm still learning F2L) and &gt; &gt; Chris (Hardwick) said
        that it was exactly how he solved it, to the &gt; &gt; move, and yah...)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I count...21 using HTM (i think) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Now everyone can see how horrible my LL is :D And for everyone's &gt;
        &gt; knowledge (and you can ask Chris if you doubt me) I found about 12
        &gt; &gt; different ways of executing the LL here using my method...So I
        might &gt; &gt; as well list as many as I can think of... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 1: z U' R U R F R2 F' R' U' R U z' M' U' M U2 M' U' M U' y' x' R2
        D2 &gt; &gt; R' U' R D2 R' U R' x' F2 D' L' R F2 R' L D' F2 (41 HTM)
        &gt; &gt; Some of the parts in this can be done in different orders...it
        really &gt; &gt; doesn't matter and it accounts for I believe 1 or 2
        different ways... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2: z U' R U R F R2 F' R' U' R U z'
        U x' z2 R U' R D2 R' U R D2 R2 x y2 &gt; &gt; r U R' U' M U R U' R' x' R
        U' R' U D R' D U' R' U R D2 F (44 HTM) &gt; &gt; why am i doing this
        ugh... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3: z U' R U R F R2 F' R' U' R U z' y' M' U M
        U2 M' U M U' x' R2 D2 R' &gt; &gt; U' R D2 R' U R' x' y' F2 D L' R F2 R'
        L D F2 (42 HTM) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4: z x U' R2 U R U' R U x2 z y R' D'
        R D' R' D2 R x2 R U R' U' M' U R &gt; &gt; U' r' U x' z2 R2 D2 R' U' R
        D2 R' U R' z' R U' R' U D R' D U' R' U R &gt; &gt; D2 F (47 HTM) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll save you all the troubles of trying more and me the
        trouble of &gt; &gt; typing them out...Could someone post a good LL to
        this solve for me to &gt; &gt; try???(using my F2L) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Ok, im 14, and ive been cubing for about a week, and i can solve the

        so even though ive got that down good, i still cant get under one
        minute. my average is about 1:30-1:45, and my fastest time is 1:09. but
        ive been looking on the net for speedcubing techniques, but couldnt find
        any that were good. they were all confusing and dificult to understand
        (at least for me) so i was wondering if anyone has their own solution,
        or knows a site with pictures and such to help me out. id really

        Only beginner solutions use pictures and the such, to learn speedcubing
        methods you must learn the notation. Many sites have applets to help,

        Have you tried the Petrus method? It's really fast, I have averaged
        sub-20 a few times. It's also quite simple and easy to understand. I
        learned it by myself from his site 6 months ago, when I was 13.

        Nice David!! All mine are actually htm-optimised since that's the
        FMC-metric ;-) I should try become better at stm-optimisation, cause
        that's the metric i really see as the most fair one. I honor inner slice
        turns as 1 turn only. And i can't see why half turns should be punished
        and considered to be of length 2 ;-) -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; With another u' at the end it's cool middle layer alg, but i like
        it &gt; &gt; better without it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and i can of

        Oopssss ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is actually the last
        case. It's a bit odd, so no wonder i &gt; &gt; &gt; initially forgot

        Sacre bleu ;-) I'm sure u are aware of inverses right? So, go &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ahead &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inverse my algorithms. I'm not gonna
        charge you ... lol ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        In fact, in all cases u can do some mirrored algorithm &gt; &gt;
        instead. &gt; &gt; &gt; But &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i know that u know
        that also :D But the axis of mirroring is &gt; &gt; not &gt; &gt; &gt;
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same for all 4 cases ... &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I realised only one case was left now

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That 'Arc de Triomphe' is so well known that i

        that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Actually i normally do it the first way. The second

        that the centers are cycles clockwise &gt; &gt; (looking &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi Per, For the way I think about the cube, I agree with you that all
        turns and slices are equal. For the formal mathematical aspects of the
        cube I recognize the value of the quarter turn. Here's the r and U only
        version. Some would say the MU, version so this is for the cowboys among
        us. :) U r' U r U2 r U2 r' U' r' U r' U2 r U r2 U' Cheers, David J ---

        All mine are actually htm-optimised since that's the FMC-metric ;-) &gt;
        &gt; I should try become better at stm-optimisation, cause that's the
        &gt; metric i really see as the most fair one. I honor inner slice turns
        &gt; as 1 turn only. And i can't see why half turns should be punished
        &gt; and considered to be of length 2 ;-) &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt;

        [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] &gt; Hi Emanuele,
        I was long plagued by difficulty in remembering them (it's such a mess,
        so I use the mnemonics "Right Up Front," and "mess" Fortunately, the
        whole cube rotations used - x, y, and z are also "Right Up Front." Turn
        Side and Cube turn Right, R = M' = x Up, U = E' = y Front F = S = z Part
        of the mess is that the first two, M and E, are counterclockwise, the S
        is clockwise. Also "w" means "with" as in take the middle slice with
        that side. Regards, David J

        Hi Duncan, In the old days I averaged somewhere between 36 and 54 moves,
        with occasional forays above and below that, but I rarely tried to
        improve solely on the basis of fewer moves. You got me wondering about
        how many moves it takes me now. So I did 16 solves: 46, 44, 41, 38, 46,
        44, 47, 46, 48, 46, 45, 35, 48, 49, 46, 45. I know I can look ahead
        better and understand more than I'm do now. Cheers, David J --- In

        I am pretty much solving full time with my L2L2 &gt; strategy now.
        Although my times are still slower until I get faster at the &gt;
        recognition/selection process, my average number of moves per solve is a
        lot &gt; less now. I did 10 solves recently at 52-53 moves which is
        probably close &gt; to the right figure. Number of moves is mostly
        reliant on getting the cross &gt; plus two corners in as few moves as
        possible - or if you were to choose a &gt; different approach for the
        start - F2L less two middle edges. There may &gt; still be room for
        improvement in this - I've been thinking of spending some &gt; time on
        Chris' X-cross work to see if anything is applicable. Also Paul &gt;
        Nixon has tried starting with the Petrus 3x2x2 but got bogged down. I
        don't &gt; know this but it may offer another way to start L2L solves.
        Any comments or &gt; suggestions more than welcome :) &gt; &gt; Duncan

        Thanks for sharing Stefan! I wasn't familiar with this approach. I like
        how you use the 'yellow face' after solving the l slice. I'll try it
        some more, it'd be nice to give that phase of the 4x4 solution a bit
        more steadiness (sp?). Because I start with the easiest colors for
        preferably two centers, I don't know if this approach will be faster for
        me. Thanks again :) - Koen --- In

        Hi Stefan, Very interesting and highly original approach. I just did a
        couple of solves and I really enjoyed using this approach. One small
        question for step 3 (shooting non-yellow centers from U into their
        proper home on u): "Each shot is either (Rr)' F (Rr) or (Ll) F' (Ll)"
        Why not (Rr) U' (Rr)'??? It is the same 'go and get' approach, still
        only three moves, but the middle move is U instead of F keeping the
        entire step in the (Ll), U, (Rr) gen category. I like your combination
        move for adjacent pairs in step 3 especially combined with the
        observation that diagonals will combine with any intervening shot. If
        stuck with a diagonal pair at the end it can also be quite elegantly
        combined into: (Rr) U' (Rr)' U (Ll)' U (Ll) [pieces in Ufl and Ubr] or
        (Ll)' U (Ll) U' (Rr) U' (Rr)' [pieces in Ubl and Ufr] Do you have any
        data on number of moves for your technique compared the 'usual' approach
        (opp centers, any 3rd face, adjacent 4th, simultanious adjacent
        5th/6th)?? Interesting, original, and fun! Thanks, Rob --- In

        "middle" I think. I've included this remark on my page now. I also fixed
        two mistakes in algorithms, made the page look a bit better, and added
        Pedro's issue and another suggestion how to hold your arms. &gt; If
        stuck with a diagonal pair at the end it can also be quite &gt;

        When the intervening shot would have to go to L or R, I'd have to rotate
        the cube first, so instead I solve the diagonal pair like you said. It's
        also good because it doesn't require any 'setup' move, you can use one
        of those two algs right away (this is something I only thought about
        right now). I'll add this to my page, too. &gt; Do you have any data on
        number of moves for your technique compared &gt; the 'usual' approach
        (opp centers, any 3rd face, adjacent 4th, &gt; simultanious adjacent
        5th/6th)?? I think both need about the same number of moves, around 30.
        I'm usually a bit over 30 but when I explained my method to Ron he soon
        told me he averages about 28-29 I think. Since I don't use that 'usual'
        approach, I don't exactly know the number of moves it requires, but I
        think it's about 30 as well. Thanks for the feedback and suggestions :-)

        &gt;&gt;S.P. RE: diagonal shots: Right. To be honest, I also use that in
        the middle of the solve. When the intervening shot would have to go to L
        or R, I'd have to rotate the cube first, so instead I solve the diagonal
        pair like you said. Hello again Stefan, For instances where the next
        shot needs to go to the L or R face I sometimes find it comfortable /
        convenient to do a [u'dD] or [ud'D'] move. i.e. I hold the U face and
        send the bottom three layers to the left or right. It is very similar
        concept to using [DE] and [D'E'] during F2L on a 3x3x3.

        I think the issue is that a twisted center results from careless
        twisting. The main problem we have when writing regulations is where to
        draw the line. If the centers had been ejected from the cube into a high
        altitude orbit, then the cube would clearly not be solved. However, if
        the centers are in a lower altitude orbit, like the International Space
        Station, then it becomes less clear. So how much are the centers allowed
        to be out of the cube before it isn't solved anymore? Can we come up
        with a better answer to this question than we already have while still
        preserving the idea that the cube must be "solved"? In my opinion, for a
        3x3x3, if an edge is hanging out of the cube, it's not solved. The cube
        must be fully assembled when it's finish‚Äîgoal of the puzzle is
        ultimately to return it to its solved state which means that the colors
        are all the same on each side and preferably, all the piece are in
        place. For the 3x3x3, I think it's more clear. The lines start to get
        blurred for larger cubes which is why we've set the strict standard for
        now. If you're going to allow center pieces to be twisted, then you're
        going to have to specify very academically "how much." Tyson Mao MSC

        willingly tried to benefit from it. It's just a bit &gt; of bad luck on
        his side. Sometimes one cannot even notice this &gt; unwanted rotation,
        unless turning some slice that has become harder &gt; to turn. So if it
        happens just at the very last turn or something u &gt; can have that
        twisting and not knowing it. A pop however of course u &gt; will notice
        and u have the chance to fix it. Well, i hope they will &gt; change that
        rule soon. The same if u have ONE broken center. U &gt; cannot benefit
        from it in any way whatsoever. TWO broken centers and &gt; u won't know
        which is which of course. &gt; &gt; Oh well ... &gt; &gt; -Per &gt;

        Here is an update for everyone. I go to school at Draughons Junior
        College in Murfreesboro, TN. They have finally agreed to let me host a
        Spring Tournament there, and I have to decide on a date. Here are the
        options: April 8th, 2006 April 22nd, 2006 I want to pick a date that
        aligns best with cubers spring break, as I know a majority are in

        Hi! Scramble: L2 D' B' U2 B L2 R2 D F D U R2 F R' F U' R U' L' D2 B2 L'
        B R D' revisited. I started to have a look at inserting the last 5

        R D R' D' F' [U' U] B' D' B U' B' D B (R' B2 R F2 )*2 So i start with
        the skeleton: B F2 L B2 R' B' L R B R B' F R D R' D' F' U' or actually i
        start from this (change order of L and R): B F2 L B2 R' B' R L B.R B' F
        R D R' D' F' U' Now i insert B' L' F2 L B L' F2:L at the dot and F L B
        L' F' L B' L' at the colon to get this final solution, cancelling 7
        moves: B F2 L B2 R' B' R F2 L B L' F' L B L' F' L B' R {B' F} R D R' D'
        F' U' (27htm, 26stm, 30qtm, 29sqtm) I spent 5 mins for the 18 move
        skeleton and about 20-25 mins on the insertions. Quite nice for about

        &gt; &gt; I haven't done this in a long time and figured I would try it
        &gt; again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was solving when I came across a good
        scramble and got a good &gt; time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The scramble was:
        &gt; &gt; L2 D' B' U2 B L2 R2 D F D U R2 F R' F U' R U' L' D2 B2 L' B R
        D' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and my times was 12.69 which I am very happy
        with. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well I then did a prepared solve average,
        where I did an average &gt; of 10 &gt; &gt; but using this same scramble
        for all 12 solves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My average was 9.39 seconds: &gt;
        &gt; (12.16) 09.67 09.53 08.39 09.02 (07.86) 10.12 10.35 07.92 09.94
        &gt; 09.62 &gt; &gt; 09.29 = 9.39 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I then continued
        for a best rolling average and got 8.09 seconds &gt; &gt; 08.53,
        (07.11), 08.00, (09.15), 08.89, 07.24, 08.67, 07.13, 07.48, &gt; &gt;
        09.05, 08.02, 07.93 = 8.09 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My best execution of my
        solution so far is 6.72 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My solution is 37
        moves after cancellations from the end of one &gt; step &gt; &gt; being
        the inverse move of the beginning of the next (which I didn't &gt; &gt;
        catch in my first real solve). This solve is not lucky either, and &gt;
        &gt; has a regular 2 look Fridrich LL (though a fast one). &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; If you know my solving style, you'll know how I started this
        solve, &gt; &gt; and the rest is very obvious. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See
        what you guys can do, this scramble rocks! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris

        Hello Everyone I just bought a 5x5. This thing is hard to turn! I use
        centers first to solve 4x4, but I would like to learn something
        different for the 5x5. My first Attempt, I built a white and yellow
        4x5x1 block. Then I fixed top 4 corners, just like gilles' method. Then
        I managed to pair up 4 of the remaining 6 edges. So I have 10 Edges
        Oriented and Permuted. White and Yellow layer Completely done. Centers
        are all messed up. 2 Edges are messed up. 1st attempt, and my cube is
        still like this. How do I finish Edges? How do I do Centers After that?
        On the 4x4, I am experimenting with Mike Bennett's Method. If you Have
        everything done but centers, How do you fix the centers? I appreciate
        any help you can give me Thank You Jason Kovacic kovacic81@...

        for fixing the last two edges on the 5x5 you can do it the same way you
        fix the flipped edge parity on the 4x4 but i prefer the centers first
        and i can do that one much faster than any other methods. and you dont
        get that edges prob with the centers first if you memorize the algs for
        the last two edges. kovacic81 &lt;kovacic81@...&gt; wrote: Hello

        It's relatively dry and warm although it did feel cold yesterday. It
        could be a lot worse though; like the Isle Of Man. &gt; &gt; &gt; On

        I think that they're &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        mix the order around for any type of press release so that &gt; &gt;
        they &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give away any of the

        Hello all. I just had my friends video camera with me and thought that i
        would make some bld videos before returning the cam back. Now the last
        time i made a bld video, i used a hankerchief to cover my eyes. But it
        took a lot of time to tie the hankerchief around my head, so i tht of
        using some other method this time. then i remembered i have some old
        swimming googles with me and decided to use them as the blindfold :)
        With the help of some newspaper clippings i had my blindfold
        ready.though it hurt a little at first :( have a look at it here
        http://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/~d3sachin/cubing/googles.jpg or if this is
        not accessible then here
        http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~sachins/cubing/googles.jpg They look quite
        silly. :) Btw the blindfold attempt was succesful with a time of 4 mins
        38secs...quite my normal time. You can have a look at the video of this
        attempt here http://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/~d3sachin/cubing/videos.html or
        here http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~sachins/cubing/videos.html Happy

        1. Slowest improver: I think Rafael Algarin wins this category. Or maybe
        my cousin Mikael. I taught him the cube one year ago and his times are
        still over 2 minutes =P (Practices only when I'm around) And my father
        will probably soon be sub-40 after (only?) 20 months of cubing. 2. Where
        do you find so many cube-students? I have taught only 3 and nobody of
        them got interested enough to go even sub minute. 3. I think my cat
        cubes secretly. At least he tries to sleep on my Stackmat.

        Hello, For some reason, I thought this was your blindfolded method for
        the 4x4 centers, which I found a very very hard method for blindfolded
        :p But this is a nice method I should consider practicing.. 2005/12/17,
        Koen Heltzel &lt;allyourbase@...&gt;: &gt; Thanks for sharing Stefan! I
        wasn't familiar with this approach. I &gt; like how you use the 'yellow
        face' after solving the l slice. I'll try &gt; it some more, it'd be
        nice to give that phase of the 4x4 solution a &gt; bit more steadiness
        (sp?). &gt; &gt; Because I start with the easiest colors for preferably
        two centers, I &gt; don't know if this approach will be faster for me.
        &gt; &gt; Thanks again :) &gt; &gt; - Koen &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I just had my friends video camera with me and thought
        that i would &gt; &gt; make some bld videos before returning the cam
        back. Now the last &gt; time &gt; &gt; i made a bld video, i used a
        hankerchief to cover my eyes. But it &gt; took &gt; &gt; a lot of time
        to tie the hankerchief around my head, so i tht of &gt; using &gt; &gt;
        some other method this time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then i remembered i
        have some old swimming googles with me and &gt; decided &gt; &gt; to use
        them as the blindfold :) With the help of some newspaper &gt; &gt;
        clippings i had my blindfold ready.though it hurt a little at &gt; first
        :( &gt; &gt; have a look at it here &gt; &gt;

        &gt; They look quite silly. &gt; &gt; :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Btw the
        blindfold attempt was succesful with a time of 4 mins &gt; &gt;
        38secs...quite my normal time. You can have a look at the video of &gt;

        Hi all, thanks to everyone who posted a response back to my prior
        question about intermediate next steps and learning the algorithms. I
        became interested in doing the Rubiks again after a 25 year hiatus. I
        was in FAO Schwarz in NY City a few weeks ago (picked up a Bedlam Box
        puzzle as well) and saw they had a bunch of 25th anniversary cubes "on
        sale" for $13. :-) There was a guy there solving the cube in about a
        minute or so. Despite not being terribly speedy, I suppose since he was
        talking while demonstrating the cube, I wondered if that person happened
        to be on this list? Does anyone else make a living or otherwise
        entertain folks during the holiday shopping sprees this time of year?

        Hi David, Those are pretty amazing move numbers for a speedcubing
        strategy! What method do you use that is so much more efficient than
        Fridrich? I know with fewest move methods one can get much lower but if
        this is a speedsolving method then it seem to be lower than just about
        anything I've heard of. The benefit of L2L is there are fewer algorithms
        to learn, and so also a less onerous recognition phase, than Fridrich -
        is the number of algorithms a problem with your method? i'd love to hear
        more. Best wishes Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From: "d_j_salvia"

        &gt; is a lot &gt; &gt;&gt; less now. I did 10 solves recently at 52-53
        moves which is probably &gt; &gt; close &gt; &gt;&gt; to the right
        figure. Number of moves is mostly reliant on getting &gt; &gt; the cross
        &gt; &gt;&gt; plus two corners in as few moves as possible - or if you
        were to &gt; &gt; choose a &gt; &gt;&gt; different approach for the

        still be room for improvement in this - I've been thinking of &gt; &gt;
        spending some &gt; &gt;&gt; time on Chris' X-cross work to see if
        anything is applicable. Also &gt; &gt; Paul &gt; &gt;&gt; Nixon has
        tried starting with the Petrus 3x2x2 but got bogged down. &gt; &gt; I
        don't &gt; &gt;&gt; know this but it may offer another way to start L2L
        solves. Any &gt; &gt; comments or &gt; &gt;&gt; suggestions more than

        &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days I averaged somewhere between 36 and 54
        moves, with &gt; &gt; &gt; occasional forays above and below that, but I
        rarely tried to &gt; improve &gt; &gt; &gt; solely on the basis of fewer
        moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You got me wondering about how many
        moves it takes me now. So I &gt; did 16 &gt; &gt; &gt; solves: 46, 44,
        41, 38, 46, 44, 47, 46, 48, 46, 45, 35, 48, 49, &gt; 46, 45. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know I can look ahead better and understand more
        than I'm do &gt; now. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt;

        Hello Everyone THe biggest problem I'm having is with the corner pieces.
        They did not come assembled. There is the visibly hollow corner piece
        and then a diamond shaped piece that fits into the bottom of the corner.
        However, I cannot get the piece to sit flush in there. This piece
        sticking up, even a little bit, will prevent the cube from turning
        smoothly. Maybe I need to sand something or use a hammer to get it
        flush. Has anyone else gotten (DIY cubes with DIY corners) like me? For
        the plastic, black washers, there is a convex side and a totally flat
        side. Which side should face the spring? Final Question: What's a good
        ballpark guideline on how tight to tighten the screws? 2 previous DIYs
        got loose really quickly, and I couldn't adjust the tension, b/c i had
        superglued the caps on. I feel like I should have started off making
        them super tight. Thank You Jason Kovacic kovacic81@... PS Best new Avg

        Hi everyone, I haven't been around recently as a few of you may know,
        because I have recently been in hospital to have a major operation on my
        leg. I've been pretty poorly over the last week or two but now I am
        recovering and am feeling a lot better. I am walking about (slowly!) on
        crutches, and I have to wear a metal frame thing around my leg to
        stabilise it while it heals up. So just to let you know that I am back
        on the scene, although I doubt I will be able to catch up with all the
        messages left on the group since my hospital stay. Thank goodness my
        hands/arms weren't operated on so I can still cube ;) In fact, Stefan, I
        set 3:25.56 on the Megaminx in hospital with my new method, and that's
        with only a little practice. SO watch out, I am going to beat you soon!
        On Friday I hope to launch the Xmas FMC if I feel well enough to stay on
        the computer for a few hours, if not I'll post the scramble and the
        categories to the group and apologise in advance for not getting it on
        the site. Hope to speak to you and hear from you all soon, keep in

        haven't been around recently as a few of you may know, because I
        &gt;have recently been in hospital to have a major operation on my leg.
        &gt; &gt;I've been pretty poorly over the last week or two but now I am
        &gt;recovering and am feeling a lot better. I am walking about (slowly!)
        &gt;on crutches, and I have to wear a metal frame thing around my leg to
        &gt;stabilise it while it heals up. &gt; &gt;So just to let you know

        catch up with all the messages left on the &gt;group since my hospital
        stay. Thank goodness my hands/arms weren't &gt;operated on so I can
        still cube ;) In fact, Stefan, I set 3:25.56 on &gt;the Megaminx in
        hospital with my new method, and that's with only a &gt;little practice.
        SO watch out, I am going to beat you soon! &gt; &gt;On Friday I hope to
        launch the Xmas FMC if I feel well enough to &gt;stay on the computer
        for a few hours, if not I'll post the scramble &gt;and the categories to

        Jason, the DIY caps are a real problem. You almost have to resort to at
        least a drop of glue to make them stay. The paper cross method only
        works well with the Studio-type centers, from my experience. The walls
        on the DIY centers are too thin. As for distance, the official
        recommendation is 1mm between burr and center post when the spring is
        pulled out. However because of tolerances you really just have to adjust
        by feel. The 1mm guieline is a good starting point though. Chris --- In

        should make the cap fit into place. That is, cut the parts that are in
        the way. And when it fits, you can make some "scratches" into the
        plastic. But so that you don't just press a hole into the plastic, but
        instead press it sidewards so that a bit sticks *out*. Do that on all

        Hi Duncan, My method is based on freedom of movement. F2L I do the
        "cross last. The LL I do CLL ELL. A beginner version would look like
        this: 1. Place two edge pieces, i.e. one across-the-center-of-one-side
        pair, on the middle level, like RF and LF (right front and left front)
        The four middle level edge pieces do not have the colors of the centers
        of the first and last levels. In my case these four edge pieces have
        neither Orange nor Red. 2. Place four corners on the first level, (on
        top) 3. Place the other two edges on the middle level, 4. place the four
        edges of the first level; (first level now on bottom) There are lots of
        options If the first four corners can go in place easily the middle
        edges are next and are often very few moves. Most of the time I get to
        the last level with two edges flipped. It's usually quicker to solve the
        LL corners and flip two edges than solving the corners while flipping no
        edges. This leave the ELL of 7 moves, and often the first move is
        already done by the last sequence. When placing the last of the First
        Level corners there is the opportunity to solve the LL corners in one
        go. This allows you to solve the LL edges sometimes when placing the
        cross. Send me a scramble and I'll send you a typical solve. Regards,

        &gt;&gt; Just a progress update. I am pretty much solving full time with
        my &gt; &gt; L2L2 &gt; &gt;&gt; strategy now. Although my times are
        still slower until I get faster &gt; &gt; at the &gt; &gt;&gt;
        recognition/selection process, my average number of moves per solve &gt;
        &gt; is a lot &gt; &gt;&gt; less now. I did 10 solves recently at 52-53
        moves which is probably &gt; &gt; close &gt; &gt;&gt; to the right

        spending some &gt; &gt;&gt; time on Chris' X-cross work to see if
        anything is applicable. Also &gt; &gt; Paul &gt; &gt;&gt; Nixon has

        Hi Stefan, First off, though I average between 25 and 32 seconds, most
        of my cubing time, which is fairly limited, goes into understanding the
        cube better rather than practicing for speed. Second, I am using only my
        own algorithms and haven't found a complete set yet. While my strategies
        are pretty well formed I'm not yet satisfied with all of my algorithms.
        As such, my method isn't complete, yet. Third, with the exception of the
        placement of the last four centers Gilles' method is an option within my
        method. Fourth for a speed comparison, my best time, from about six

        &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days I averaged somewhere between 36 and 54
        moves, with &gt; &gt; &gt; occasional forays above and below that, but I
        rarely tried to &gt; improve &gt; &gt; &gt; solely on the basis of fewer
        moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You got me wondering about how many
        moves it takes me now. So I &gt; did 16 &gt; &gt; &gt; solves: 46, 44,
        41, 38, 46, 44, 47, 46, 48, 46, 45, 35, 48, 49, &gt; 46, 45. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know I can look ahead better and understand more
        than I'm do &gt; now. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Just a progress update. I am pretty much solving full
        time with &gt; my &gt; &gt; &gt; L2L2 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; strategy now.
        Although my times are still slower until I get &gt; faster &gt; &gt;
        &gt; at the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; recognition/selection process, my average
        number of moves per &gt; solve &gt; &gt; &gt; is a lot &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; less now. I did 10 solves recently at 52-53 moves which is &gt;
        probably &gt; &gt; &gt; close &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to the right figure.
        Number of moves is mostly reliant on &gt; getting &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        cross &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; plus two corners in as few moves as possible -
        or if you were to &gt; &gt; &gt; choose a &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; different
        approach for the start - F2L less two middle edges. &gt; There &gt; &gt;
        &gt; may &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; still be room for improvement in this - I've
        been thinking of &gt; &gt; &gt; spending some &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; time on
        Chris' X-cross work to see if anything is applicable. &gt; Also &gt;

        Dear Cubers, Ron Van Bruchem uncle was in Chennai, India on 17th and
        18th of dec-2005 I am very very happy to have spent the week-end happily
        with Ron uncle. I learnt a lot and had fun. He was very good, kind and
        simple. Eventhough I lost all the events to a great cuber, I enjoyed the
        super-mini world cup-2005 held in Chennai on 17th and 18th. It is called
        super-mini because only 2 competed. My disappointment for not being
        allowed to usa to compete in wc-2005 in Orlando was very well
        compensated by the super mini world cup-2005 with Ron uncle last week
        end. What a wonderful gesture from him to compete with this little boy
        travelling a long way!! I am greatly benefitted and enjoyed asif I had
        been in Orlando. Wow, how many good quality cubes he had presented to me
        - square-1, 2*2, 3*3, 4*4, 5*5 !!! Wow! at last, I shook hands with one
        of the best cubers in the world , talked with him, stayed with him,
        learnt from him, had fun with him and finally competed with him. Looking
        forward to many more such meetings in 2006 with you all as well. The
        mini world cup-2005 held in chennai last week end was a great success.
        Kudos to Ron uncle, my dad and his friends and relatives to make this
        mini world-cup-2005 a great success. Full results Ron uncle may post at
        the earliest possible.( I hit many 18.xx, 19.xx and 20.xx sec in

        Just got some new cubes from Restoration hardware. The stickers will
        probably wear out quickly, which is too bad becuase I like the retro
        logo, but new stickers are abundant and inexpensive. But right out of
        the box this one is very smooth and fast. I'm optimistic it will turn
        out to be a great speedcube. I went to the store in Mission Viejo
        California and they had about 12 or 15 out, so I tried them all and
        bought the only 3 that turned well [keeping one for me, the other 2 are
        spoken for]. These 3 were all about the same, but were far smoother than
        all of the others. I still find that variability to be weird for
        something mass produced. One clerk saw me playing with them and
        commented that the fastest anyone had been able to solve it was four
        minutes. I said something like you've got to be kididng me [thinking, of
        course, that there must have been someone faster than that]. she replied
        no really, I watched him do most of it and it was really cool. when I
        did it in about 45 seconds, they were all blown away. too fun. They did
        not seem to mind at all that I was taking them out of the box and
        playing with them, and I saw other people doing the same thing. The
        packaging is open [someone posted a picture on the twistypuzzles site of
        the packaging]. That made it rather easy to find the good ones. they
        have arched centers, and are made by Winning Moves, so internally they
        may just be the same as their other cubes, but the packaging and
        stickers have the retro look, which is definitely cool, imo. hapy

        Hi :-) Short answer : since 1982 or thereabout. That's when the Deluxe
        (Game) cube first saw the light of day. Those cubes had arched centers
        unlike the original ones and most of the knock-off cubes. (Someone
        correct me if u have information contradicting this.) Even since then
        most cubes have been made with plain flat inside centers. I guess this
        is simply cause they are easier and cheaper to make. Like already
        mentioned, some prefer arched centers cause of stability, less popping.
        While some prefer normal flat centers cause they give less locking, more
        forgiving. -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Can you post the manufacture dates (on the inside of one of the
        corners-- turn each face 45 degrees to locate it). The good cube that I
        got said "M1005" which I take to mean it was just produced in October of
        this year. It would be interesting to know whether these cubes are of
        higher production standards than earlier batches. Speaking of that, is
        there anyone who can solve the puzzle of how these cubes are
        manufactured vs. marketed? In other words, I know that currently you can
        get 3x3x3 cubes made by Winning Moves, Hasbro, or Rubiks.com. However
        they appear to be the same product from Kroeger of Canada. Yet they all
        claim to be Made in China. Are they made in China, imported by Kroeger,
        then packaged and sold by Winning Moves, Hasbro, and Rubiks.com
        respectively? Does Kroeger just do the final manufacturing (i.e.
        assembly and stickers)? I'm just trying to understand where the
        breakdown in quality actually occurs. It doesn't make sense on the
        surface that Winning Moves cubes are superior if they're all made at the
        same plant in China as the Hasbro cubes. Chris --- In

        Hi, I can now report independent confirmation that Rubik's cube can
        always be solved without using more than 38 quarter turns. This has been
        shown based upon the following results. Tom Rokicki posted a result on
        this forum in January, 2004, showing that the edge cubies of Rubik's
        cube can always be solved in 18 quarter turns or less. (See:
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/8306)
        I have just verified this result, doing my own independent analysis
        using a Pentium 4-based PC. Silviu Radu, who I understand is working on
        a Ph.D. thesis on Rubik's cube, has done an analysis showing that the
        corners can always be solved without any net change in the edge
        positions/orientations in 22 quarter turns or less. Together, the above
        results show that Rubik's cube can always be solved in two phases using
        no more than 40 quarter turns. I have verified that Silviu's move
        sequences solve all of the relevant cube positions using no more than 22
        quarter turns. Rokicki's analysis indicates there are 31 positions,
        considering just the edges and centers, that require more than 16 moves
        to properly position and orient the edges. This is only 4 symmetrically
        distinct positions. I have generated move sequences for solving all the
        symmetrically distinct positions of Rubik's cube having these edge
        configurations using no more than 37 quarter turns. Silviu has confirmed
        that my solutions are correct and account for all the relevant
        symmetrically distinct positions. All remaining positions of Rubik's
        cube can be solved in 38 quarter turns or less (at most 16 quarter turns
        to solve the edges, and then 22 quarter turns or less to solve the
        corners while having no net effect on the edges). Details have been
        posted on the cube-lovers forum at: http://cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal/

        Eric Hi Eric, Per, and All, The original design had arched centers.
        Ideal, from the very beginning in 1980, made cubes with both the flat
        centers and arched centers. The Deluxe versions, starting in 1980, all
        have the arches. When Ideal stopped making cubes I think that most of
        the production models were flat centered, but I'm not sure. The arched
        center pieces were reintroduced by Seven Towns about the beginning of
        2003. Seven Towns controls all of the officially licensed cubes except
        for Rubik's Studio cubes. Their manufacturing plants are in China and
        they make all the cubes which are sold by Winning Moves, Hasbro and
        Milton Bradley. Regards, David J

        Hi :-) Well, then either the edge-step leaves corners untouched or the
        corner-step leaves edges untouched. Is this really the case for those
        separate analyses ?? Ok, so im writing this before i have read the full
        explanations so maybe the answers are to be found there. We also know
        from earlier that the cube is always solvable in 29 half turns of the
        cube. So together this means that some positions require at least 9 half
        turns for the "optimal" solution. Of course solutions without half turns
        are possible, but those are not necessarily "optimal". -Per PS!
        "Optimal" means optimal wrt proven minima, not wrt "gods algorithm" :-)

        Hi Chris, I think that some of the first plastics that were tried made
        the cubes hard to turn, so flat centers were introduced to reduce
        friction. When the plastics improved the arches came back. I think that
        since they already had the tooling for the flat centers and quite a bit
        more demand for cubes than they could meet, so they kept producing the
        flat centers. I have an early 1980 Ideal Cube in the white box, and a
        Politoys cube from the same time, both made in Hungary, with arches.
        What do you mean by "clone?" Cheers, David J --- In

        Also, don't get too intimidated when you read the methods. Don't choose
        one just because it seems easier. For all methods there are more
        beginner solutions, which can then be built upon, to reach the full
        method. There are also many more methods that you can find by scouring
        the web, or checking the links page at speedcubing.com. And lastly,
        don't forget the possibility of making your own method. Hope that helps,

        The edges step totally ignores the corners. The corners step, however,
        leaves the edges "untouched." The edges move around during the moves to
        solve the corners, of course, but at the end they are restored to the
        exact same position, so if the edges are solved before doing the corners
        step, they will again be solved at the end of the corners step. Note
        that corners can always be solved with no more than 14 quarter turns if
        the edges are ignored. For the cube positions where this "edges first,
        then corners" strategy does not guarantee a solution in 38 quarter turns
        or less, I used a program I wrote in C++ which looks for a solution in
        two phases, where the goal of the first phase is to get the cube into a
        position within the Rubik's cube subgroup denoted by &lt;U, D, F2, B2,
        R2, L2&gt; (or symmetrical variations of that subgroup). To solve
        millions of positions, the solver needed to be very fast, but didn't
        need to produce particularly good solutions. So it only considered
        optimal solutions of each of the two separate phases. (In fact, it
        doesn't really use necessarily optimal solutions of the 2nd phase
        because of the way the lookup table for the 2nd phase is generated.) -

        &gt; &gt; Well, then either the edge-step leaves corners untouched or
        the &gt; corner-step leaves edges untouched. Is this really the case for
        &gt; those separate analyses ?? Ok, so im writing this before i have
        read &gt; the full explanations so maybe the answers are to be found
        there. &gt; &gt; We also know from earlier that the cube is always
        solvable in 29 &gt; half turns of the cube. So together this means that
        some positions &gt; require at least 9 half turns for the "optimal"
        solution. Of course &gt; solutions without half turns are possible, but
        those are not &gt; necessarily "optimal". &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; PS!

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I can now report independent confirmation that Rubik's

        quarter turns. This has been &gt; shown based &gt; &gt; upon the
        following results. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tom Rokicki posted a result on
        this forum in January, 2004, &gt; showing that the &gt; &gt; edge cubies
        of Rubik's cube can always be solved in 18 quarter &gt; turns or &gt;
        &gt; less. (See: &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/83
        &gt; 06) I &gt; &gt; have just verified this result, doing my own
        independent analysis &gt; using a &gt; &gt; Pentium 4-based PC. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Silviu Radu, who I understand is working on a Ph.D.
        thesis on &gt; Rubik's cube, &gt; &gt; has done an analysis showing that
        the corners can always be solved &gt; without &gt; &gt; any net change
        in the edge positions/orientations in 22 quarter &gt; turns or &gt; &gt;
        less. Together, the above results show that Rubik's cube can &gt; always
        be &gt; &gt; solved in two phases using no more than 40 quarter turns. I
        have &gt; verified &gt; &gt; that Silviu's move sequences solve all of
        the relevant cube &gt; positions using &gt; &gt; no more than 22 quarter
        turns. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rokicki's analysis indicates there are 31
        positions, considering &gt; just the &gt; &gt; edges and centers, that
        require more than 16 moves to properly &gt; position and &gt; &gt;
        orient the edges. This is only 4 symmetrically distinct positions. &gt;
        I have &gt; &gt; generated move sequences for solving all the
        symmetrically &gt; distinct &gt; &gt; positions of Rubik's cube having
        these edge configurations using &gt; no more &gt; &gt; than 37 quarter
        turns. Silviu has confirmed that my solutions are &gt; correct &gt; &gt;
        and account for all the relevant symmetrically distinct positions. &gt;
        All &gt; &gt; remaining positions of Rubik's cube can be solved in 38
        quarter &gt; turns or &gt; &gt; less (at most 16 quarter turns to solve
        the edges, and then 22 &gt; quarter turns &gt; &gt; or less to solve the
        corners while having no net effect on the &gt; edges). &gt; &gt; &gt;

        that's interesting--I have never noticed that code on the corner before.
        I glanced at a couple of my current cubes, and didn't see it on any of
        them. Did I just miss it, i.e. is that code on all cubes, or is that
        just something added recently? Anyone know if it is indeed a date stamp?
        seems logical... As for my Restoration Hardware cubes, all three I
        picked up read M1005B. Does yours have a B at the end? Is yours breaking
        in well? I still think this is as good of a new cube out of the box as
        I've bought [I probably have about 10, so I'm by no means an expert],
        but that coupled with the ease of trying out multiple cubes and the cool
        retro logo makes this a decent option imo for anyone who needs to pick
        up a new cube and can get to one of their stores. I didn't know to look
        for this code so have no idea if the ones I rejected had different
        codes. Also, I noticed the code was on different colored corners for
        each cube [another variability in a mass production process that I
        wouldn't have expected--I'm the type who would always make sure it was
        on the same color sticker, and I suspect that's a relativley common
        trait among cubers, but apparently not among cube manufacturers.

        Hey Eric, I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about this decision.
        All of the methods Jason mentioned are simply excellent, each with
        unique pros and cons, but each capable of producing very fast cubers.
        More importantly, even if you spend a lot of effort learning one method
        and then switch to another, that effort on the first method is
        definitely not wasted. Just training your fingers to move fast will also
        help you no matter which method you ultimately end up with. There's also
        a lot of overlap, and knowing more than one method can help your cubing,
        and once you know one method, picking up others is not so hard--similar
        to how if you know one of the romance languages, learing a second or
        third is easier than learning the first. If there is someone you know
        that uses a particular method, that may be enough to tilt the scales in
        favor of that method. While it's possible with all the info on the
        Internet to try to pick this all up on your own, for me at least,
        actually getting together with other cubers has helped tremendously.

        a step (at least one) is about 35.6%. Cheers! Stefan

        Yes, mine says M1005B also. And it's breaking in well. I left it unlubed

        Hi Stefan :-) When Joel, Lars, Matt (Walter) and Ron tried the marathon
        after the World Championships the scrambler(s) tried as best as they
        could to put the cubes so that the cuber could see an easy cross. This
        is of course a bit subjective but i guess it gives the cuber more
        confidence to not get a cube where u have to search for a cross. As i
        know there are no official rules for the marathon, of course except that
        there is really no inspection time for each cube and u have to really
        solve 42 cubes with no pauses ... Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        start with it or start with white (or yellow)? Pedro Stefan Pochmann

        or (Ll) F' (Ll)" &gt; &gt; Why not (Rr) U' (Rr)'??? It is the same 'go
        and get' approach, &gt; still only three moves, but the middle move is U
        instead of F &gt; keeping the entire step in the (Ll), U, (Rr) gen
        category. Yes, you're right. Actually it's of course the same, just
        holding/rotating the cube differently. I actually do something in the
        "middle" I think. I've included this remark on my page now. I also fixed
        two mistakes in algorithms, made the page look a bit better, and added
        Pedro's issue and another suggestion how to hold your arms. &gt; If
        stuck with a diagonal pair at the end it can also be quite &gt;
        elegantly combined into: &gt; &gt; (Rr) U' (Rr)' U (Ll)' U (Ll) [pieces
        in Ufl and Ubr] &gt; or (Ll)' U (Ll) U' (Rr) U' (Rr)' [pieces in Ubl and
        Ufr] Right. To be honest, I also use that in the middle of the solve.
        When the intervening shot would have to go to L or R, I'd have to rotate
        the cube first, so instead I solve the diagonal pair like you said. It's
        also good because it doesn't require any 'setup' move, you can use one
        of those two algs right away (this is something I only thought about
        right now). I'll add this to my page, too. &gt; Do you have any data on
        number of moves for your technique compared &gt; the 'usual' approach
        (opp centers, any 3rd face, adjacent 4th, &gt; simultanious adjacent
        5th/6th)?? I think both need about the same number of moves, around 30.
        I'm usually a bit over 30 but when I explained my method to Ron he soon
        told me he averages about 28-29 I think. Since I don't use that 'usual'
        approach, I don't exactly know the number of moves it requires, but I
        think it's about 30 as well. Thanks for the feedback and suggestions :-)

        spend too much time worrying about this decision. All of &gt; the
        methods Jason mentioned are simply excellent, each with unique &gt; pros
        and cons, but each capable of producing very fast cubers. More &gt;
        importantly, even if you spend a lot of effort learning one method &gt;
        and then switch to another, that effort on the first method is &gt;
        definitely not wasted. Just training your fingers to move fast will &gt;
        also help you no matter which method you ultimately end up with. &gt;
        There's also a lot of overlap, and knowing more than one method can &gt;
        help your cubing, and once you know one method, picking up others is
        &gt; not so hard--similar to how if you know one of the romance &gt;
        languages, learing a second or third is easier than learning the &gt;
        first. &gt; &gt; If there is someone you know that uses a particular
        method, that may &gt; be enough to tilt the scales in favor of that
        method. While it's &gt; possible with all the info on the Internet to
        try to pick this all &gt; up on your own, for me at least, actually
        getting together with &gt; other cubers has helped tremendously. &gt;

        Fridrich/Petrus. I spent about 6 months on Corners 1st, and a &gt; year

        look at all of the methods and decide for yourself &gt; &gt; which one

        Hi Stefan, thanks for the link, but I think the shipping to Brazil will

        WikiCube - The free encyclospeedia that anyone can edit. I think it's
        about time we had a massive resource of anything you need to know about

        eventually, it'll all be here. If you know how wikipedia works, you'll
        see just how good this is. Otherwise.... Basically, WikiCube will have
        pages and pages of infomation about different kinds of cubing. Don't see
        something there? Write a request and someone will write a page about
        something. Just think, all the cubing minds in teh world together in one
        place contributing infomation, I hope this to because the number one
        source of infomation. Handly, we could have for example a PLL pages
        explaining what PLL is and some generic algs. Or a description of a

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi! A new cuber in the UK here. I used to play with the cube in the 80's
        when I was little(I used a really simple beginner layer method, I think)
        and recently after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in the office had got
        hooked again and bought a new cube in August. I've been reading a lot of
        the people here's web pages and they have all been a great help (esp.
        Jessica Fridrich's, Dan Harris', Joel Van Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So
        thanks to everyone for making some great webpages. I use the cross on
        the bottom. I am getting better at doing F2L (it's taking a long time to
        be able to make fast decisions though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H, E,
        J and F PLL algorithms (and have forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm
        going to try to learn all the PLL ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is
        that the general approach to learning Fridrich? Since I learnt those
        PLL's I have found it possible to solve the cube in around 50 seconds
        whereas before it was around 1 minute 30 or something like that if I
        went flat out. Still pretty slow compared to everyone here. Still, I had
        a go with Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and was shocked when using my
        method after a few tries I solved it in 31 seconds. Well, That was a big
        Oh wow for me, anyway! :) I have two cubes, one I bought from a
        department store in August with bright stickers on (which deteriorated
        really rapidly )- probably the generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a
        Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY cube with PVC stickers which I prefer. The DIY one
        seems to be easier to control turns on and more suitable for doing fast
        solves (although it's noisier according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has
        M0105B written on one of the corners. Does anyone have any opinions of
        the new anniversary cube? Is it the same as the normal 3 x 3 but with a
        different centre white sticker? Is it at all suitable for speedcubing?
        Are the stickers PVC or polypropelene? That's it for now. Cheers, Matt

        I saw it but I was not very close. Ron was the one counting (and there
        was a third person too, but I can't remember who it was). And no, he
        didn't do anything weird such as starting in the back. I think the rules

        It's easy Click on one of the red links and press edit to create the
        article for that page. If it's not a red link, search for the page, and
        it'll say no page with 'that exact title' is avaliable. 'that exact
        title' acts as a red link and you can go from there to add the page.

        I noticed there are different versions of the 25th anniversary cube. I
        picked one up at Walmart yesterday and it was garbage. Very loose and
        sloppy feeling. It was in a clear plastic "clamshell" style packaging. I
        just ordered one from here:

        I remember seeing this. Maybe you're thinking of me. It was right after
        Oliver demonstrated how many times he could twist his arm with his palm
        on the table. We suggested he try turning the cube without releasing it.
        He started with his arms wrapped around each other and his fingers
        reaching as far around the cube as possible. I don't remember the exact
        turn count, but I remember it was a lot. :) On 12/20/05, Gilles van den

        The days are not far off Mr.Sachin. Zee TV is shooting me on 24th dec in
        my home town and I will be coming to Bombay next month for an interview
        in TV studio. I shall definetly meet you. I have taught some of my
        friends here to cube and hope you too would have done so. Let us
        popularise this sport in India. Yes, I learnt some tips from Ron uncle
        and got some more ideas to improve myself. Having learnt PLL pairity in
        4*4*4 my best time today is 1 min 26.42 sec and the avg of 10 is 1 min
        41.86 sec. I am greatly benefitted after learning the tips to solve plus
        in 3*3. Finally, it was expensive for both Ron uncle and for my dad to
        make our meeting for 2 days. Hope to see you soon Mr.Sachin Bernett
        Orlando P.S : Any cuber going to India , plz let us know Sachin

        week-end happily with Ron uncle. I learnt a lot and had fun. He was very
        good, kind and simple. &gt; Eventhough I lost all the events to a great
        cuber, I enjoyed the super-mini world cup-2005 held in Chennai on 17th
        and 18th. It is called super-mini because only 2 competed. My
        disappointment for not being allowed to usa to compete in wc-2005 in
        Orlando was very well compensated by the super mini world cup-2005 with
        Ron uncle last week end. What a wonderful gesture from him to compete
        with this little boy travelling a long way!! &gt; I am greatly
        benefitted and enjoyed asif I had been in Orlando. Wow, how many good
        quality cubes he had presented to me - square-1, 2*2, 3*3, 4*4, 5*5 !!!
        &gt; Wow! at last, I shook hands with one of the best cubers in the
        world , talked with him, stayed with him, learnt from him, had fun with
        him and finally competed with him. Looking forward to many more such
        meetings in 2006 with you all as well. &gt; The mini world cup-2005 held
        in chennai last week end was a great success. Kudos to Ron uncle, my dad
        and his friends and relatives to make this mini world-cup-2005 a great
        success. Full results Ron uncle may post at the earliest possible.( I
        hit many 18.xx, 19.xx and 20.xx sec in stackmat). &gt; I am inspired.

        20, 2005 5:25 PM Subject: [Speed cubing group] New UK cuber &gt; Hi! A
        new cuber in the UK here. I used to play with the cube in the &gt; 80's
        when I was little(I used a really simple beginner layer method, I &gt;
        think) and recently after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in the office
        &gt; had got hooked again and bought a new cube in August. &gt; &gt;
        I've been reading a lot of the people here's web pages and they have
        &gt; all been a great help (esp. Jessica Fridrich's, Dan Harris', Joel
        Van &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So thanks to everyone for making some
        great &gt; webpages. I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting better
        at doing &gt; F2L (it's taking a long time to be able to make fast
        decisions &gt; though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F PLL
        algorithms (and &gt; have forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm going to
        try to learn all the &gt; PLL ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is
        that the general approach &gt; to learning Fridrich? Since I learnt
        those PLL's I have found it &gt; possible to solve the cube in around 50
        seconds whereas before it was &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something like
        that if I went flat out. Still &gt; pretty slow compared to everyone
        here. &gt; &gt; Still, I had a go with Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and
        was shocked &gt; when using my method after a few tries I solved it in
        31 seconds. &gt; Well, That was a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt;
        &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought from a department store in August
        with &gt; bright stickers on (which deteriorated really rapidly )-
        probably the &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY
        cube with PVC &gt; stickers which I prefer. The DIY one seems to be
        easier to control &gt; turns on and more suitable for doing fast solves
        (although it's &gt; noisier according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has
        M0105B written on &gt; one of the corners. &gt; &gt; Does anyone have
        any opinions of the new anniversary cube? Is it the &gt; same as the
        normal 3 x 3 but with a different centre white sticker? Is &gt; it at
        all suitable for speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or polypropelene?
        &gt; &gt; That's it for now. &gt; &gt; Cheers, Matt &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi I created a new version of Jess Bonde's ultimate timer even though I
        know he promised to rip my head off... No, in fact I did ask him to
        create a version that would contain an applet to immediately be able to
        check the scramble on your cube, but he said the code was so ugly he'd
        probably die from the mere shock of looking at it. I took my chances
        anyway, and it was only a couple of lines to be added. If you want to
        change the color scheme then you can search for it in the source code
        and do so, it's in one place only (hint: search for "&lt;applet"). You
        can download it from the files section, or use it online here:
        http://vanderblonk.com/cube/timer.htm Make sure you put the
        rubikplayer.jar from www.randelshofer.ch in the same directory as the

        see the posts about the cubes at restoration hardware. I know $12 may be
        a couple of bucks more than the cubes at wal-mart, but being able to try
        them all out makes it worth it [plus I like the retro logo]. I've heard
        of people opening up and trying out cubes at the other stores or buying
        5 and returning 4, but I don't know how those retailers react to
        that--if they'll let you do it, great. As you've discovered, there is a
        wide range of initial quality on cubes. You could try to return and
        exchange it and see if they let you. If not, don't give up on the cube.
        If it's too tight, take it apart and wedge a credit card or two bewteen
        the center edges for a day or two to loosen up the tension in the
        springs. Silicon spray can really help. And even the stiffest cubes will
        wear in over time and heavy use. other options include the DIY cubes
        from rubiks.com where you can adjust the tension of the center springs,
        and I've heard some people prepare speedcubes and sell them on eBay.
        good luck! --Kirk --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Eric"

        where this advice comes from? The current rubiks.com cubes and
        equivalents have screws with large heads. These limit how far you can
        pull out a center. The limit is *not* defined by a fully compressed
        spring, like it is for the Studio cube and equivalent (i.e. most old
        Ideal). In the new cubes you can't fully compress springs because the
        screw head blocks earlier. I know you can shorten a spring by fully
        compressing it for a while, but I doubt it has any effect if you don't
        get at least quite near to full compression. Does anybody have proof
        this works for current rubiks.com cubes? I believe it for Studio cubes
        but I have doubts about rubiks.com ones... Cheers! Stefan

        cuber &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi! A new cuber in the UK here. I used to play
        with the cube in the &gt; &gt; 80's when I was little(I used a really
        simple beginner layer method, I &gt; &gt; think) and recently after
        playing with a 4 x 4 someone in the office &gt; &gt; had got hooked
        again and bought a new cube in August. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been
        reading a lot of the people here's web pages and they have &gt; &gt; all
        been a great help (esp. Jessica Fridrich's, Dan Harris', Joel Van &gt;
        &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So thanks to everyone for making some
        great &gt; &gt; webpages. I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting
        better at doing &gt; &gt; F2L (it's taking a long time to be able to
        make fast decisions &gt; &gt; though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J
        and F PLL algorithms (and &gt; &gt; have forgotten the A one!). I guess
        I'm going to try to learn all the &gt; &gt; PLL ones and then look at
        the OLL ones. Is that the general approach &gt; &gt; to learning
        Fridrich? Since I learnt those PLL's I have found it &gt; &gt; possible
        to solve the cube in around 50 seconds whereas before it was &gt; &gt;
        around 1 minute 30 or something like that if I went flat out. Still &gt;
        &gt; pretty slow compared to everyone here. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still, I
        had a go with Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and was shocked &gt; &gt; when
        using my method after a few tries I solved it in 31 seconds. &gt; &gt;
        Well, That was a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        have two cubes, one I bought from a department store in August with &gt;
        &gt; bright stickers on (which deteriorated really rapidly )- probably
        the &gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY
        cube with PVC &gt; &gt; stickers which I prefer. The DIY one seems to be
        easier to control &gt; &gt; turns on and more suitable for doing fast
        solves (although it's &gt; &gt; noisier according to my wife). Oh yes,
        and it has M0105B written on &gt; &gt; one of the corners. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any opinions of the new anniversary cube? Is
        it the &gt; &gt; same as the normal 3 x 3 but with a different centre
        white sticker? Is &gt; &gt; it at all suitable for speedcubing? Are the
        stickers PVC or polypropelene? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's it for now.

        I think I read about it in a former post in here a long time ago. I
        haven't done it in a long time, but I recall getting some improvement in

        just a sugar pill. But if Stefan says it doesn't work, then I'd defer to
        him--he's definitely the spring king! best regards, Kirk --- In

        someone know where this advice comes from? The current rubiks.com &gt;
        cubes and equivalents have screws with large heads. These limit how &gt;
        far you can pull out a center. The limit is *not* defined by a fully
        &gt; compressed spring, like it is for the Studio cube and equivalent
        (i.e. &gt; most old Ideal). In the new cubes you can't fully compress
        springs &gt; because the screw head blocks earlier. I know you can
        shorten a spring &gt; by fully compressing it for a while, but I doubt
        it has any effect if &gt; you don't get at least quite near to full
        compression. Does anybody &gt; have proof this works for current
        rubiks.com cubes? I believe it for &gt; Studio cubes but I have doubts
        about rubiks.com ones... &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;
