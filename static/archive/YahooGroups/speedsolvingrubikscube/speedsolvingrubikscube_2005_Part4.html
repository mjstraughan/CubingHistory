My std devs hang around 6 or 7 secs. The largest individual differences are

          <div class="email-content">Not everybody all at once. ;P

Anywho, a few days ago, I was averaging around 2:05 to 2:10 with this
method, and was incredibly excited.  After implementing a few more
simple commutators for center piece switching, to minimize unnecessary
setup moves, and getting more fluid on overall solve, I&#x27;ve decreased
my average average and my best averages by over 15 seconds each.  All
in under 4 days.

This is the part where you guys come in.  With the addition of a few
more algs for block center swapping (that&#x27;s your cue), some center 3
cycles (your turn again), and some streamlining of the M slice edges
stage (I&#x27;ve got that one), I think this method has a lot more
potential than I originally suspected.

With practice, these times should be relatively easy to achieve:
30 seconds for 1x3x4 blocks on L and R, along with U layer corners
20 seconds or less to pair and place M slice and U layer edges
15 seconds to finish of M slice center cubies

I would like to specifically request an alg to swap 3 center cubies on
opposite faces, one for adjacent faces, one to swap two adjacent
center pieces with two non adjacent pieces on the opposite center, and
one to swap two non adjacent center pieces with two non adjacent
pieces on an adjacent side.  Now, let the emails come flooding in.

Thanks, in advance. =D

I thought it was discussed a while back and the general consensus was
&#x27;around 10%.&#x27;

Of course, some people are higher or lower, but that&#x27;s probably about
average.  I&#x27;m going to guess you average somewhere just over 20
seconds with that SD.  Now, if I&#x27;m way off, please don&#x27;t be offended.
 We&#x27;ll just blame it on me being very tired.

Of course, this also varies puzzle to puzzle, I&#x27;m sure.  I would
assume people are generally far less deviant with larger puzzles (once
they&#x27;re comfortable in a method).  The larger times with relative
consistency should add up to smaller deviations.  Or, maybe that&#x27;s
just me...

I imagine that if you compare similar puzzles where the solution is 
made up of many small steps (the &quot;really big&quot; cubes, say), the 
consistency (as a percentage of the total time) would improve with 
increasing size of the puzzle: With N small, similar steps in your 
solution, the typical variation in the solution time should increase 
roughly as sqrt[N], while the solution time itself increases faster 
than that, i.e. as N.

It&#x27;s not obvious that the argument is right, however. For a given 
puzzle (3x3x3 say), the same kind of reasoning would lead you to 
expect better consistency from a method that had more steps. That 
doesn&#x27;t seem to agree with my own, very limited experience. :S

 No that&#x27;s it, I average around 21 seconds these days with a best of 20.16.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I will be serious.

When I first got the Magic, I was VERY into it.  I was already
extremely interested in it because I had been Super-Magicing for a
couple weeks and the Super Magic makes the normal magic seem like a
baby.  When my Magic arrived, I already knew how to solve it.  I spent
all day after I got it (from about 4pm to sleeptime) practicing the
first transform, except for 80 minutes during class (too loud!).  By
the time I was taking timings the next day (for the first time), I was
able to eventually get sub-2 by the end of the day.  The first week
(or so), I would do several averages of 100 per day, sometimes
averages of 200 or 300 or more.  Pochmann kept me motivated. :-)  He
once told me &quot;An average of 100 per day keeps the slow times away.&quot;  I
believe this is true, but I don&#x27;t practice much more lately anyway
because I am a lazy bum and unfortunatley have other things to
concentrate on, but it does not take long to get fast at the Magic. 
When I competed (and won) in New York, I had been solving the Magic in
total for about 6 weeks, but didn&#x27;t even bother to touch it from 4
weeks before the competition until the day of the competition. ;)

Practice is by far the best way to bring your times down.

Just to clarify, I need these moves not to change anything other than
the specific centers they effect.  It&#x27;s the final step of my solution,
so, while I really enjoy Chris&#x27; page, it&#x27;s not going to help in this
situation.

In fact, I developed mine as the antithesis to Chris&#x27; because, while
many people are very good at centers first, I wasn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a great
method, but I know that my mind and hands work better with a different
approach.  I also know there are others who could also benefit from a
non-centers first method.  You have to customize to what fits you
best.  I also think that centers first on the 4x4 is very much like
Fridrich for the 3x3.  It&#x27;s the method out there that&#x27;s the most
widely accessible on the web, so it&#x27;s the most popular.  If there were
more resources available for alternatives, I think fewer people would
use Fridrich.

Anywho, that&#x27;s my spiel for the day.  Now send away. =D

Building 2 opposite 1x2x3 blocks (F2L minus 2 edges and middle-slice <br>
centers) can be done in less than 25 moves on average (I&#x27;m talking <br>
about real speedcubing of course).<br>
I need about 8s on average (starting with hands flat on the table, <br>
stopping by destroying the spacebar).<br>

Because I think I&#x27;ll never be able to solve the F2L in less than 9s, I <br>

Not training as I did in the begining though.

I think it was something like 2 and a half months ago when we started. Sub 
30 in less that 3 months is pretty good!!!

Congrats.

there were so many cubers!

Theres one kid at my lunch who has heard about the LBL method, but im 
not sure if he can solve. Another kid can actually using WC (and i 
watched him) but he was terribly slow. Then there is anothet kid who 
i taught to cube, then theirs me. Im sure theres more people that 
would join, so ill have to make up flyers, maybe that will gain 
interest. 

Hope this goes over well. Wish me luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hi David J,

Yes, it was very exciting getting my first sub-30s average! I got a
few more sub-30s averages last week, including a new best of 29.08s.
:) My real average is still definitely over 30s!

Re your other comment, did you see one of the 25th anniversary TV
interviews I did, or are you referring to the photos I posted? If the
former, which interview was it? I had thought the TV interviews were
generally just screened in the UK. I know the CNN one was shown in
other countries though because one of my friends in Australia told me
that her mother had seen me on CNN. :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just finished solving my dogic, after the first time I&#x27;d ever <br>
scrambled it!  It took me about 1 hour and 34 minutes, seeing as how <br>
I had absolutely no idea how to approach it after seeing it <br>
scrambled.<br>
<br>
I think I figured out a good semi-efficient working solution <br>
though.  Going to try a time again in a bit.<br>
<br>
Anyway I have a question.  My dogic is one of the new Mefferts <br>
remakes and it tends to pop a bit if I&#x27;m not REALLY careful.<br>
<br>
Are there ways around this that anyone knows?  I don&#x27;t want to speed <br>
solve, but I&#x27;d prefer to not have to do a 288 degree turn just <br>
because my face doesn&#x27;t want to turn the way I need it to turn.<br>
<br>
Anyway the dogic is awesome, and complicated!  I had a few really <br>
cool pops and could get a good look at the insides.  I gather that <br>
the triangle pieces of like colors are indistinct, but it took me a <br>
minute to realize that the flips of those other pieces are just like <br>
corners on a 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
So if I pop now I have a quicker way of knowing how the pieces go <br>
back in.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m going to try another time.  This thing is fun!<br>

I&#x27;ve seen both E and V used.  The beauty of Muppet Theory is that you 
can use either one.  :P

Yes.  Frightening, how the evil-ness of one yellow muppet can so

Thanks!  This sort of thing has been a side hobby of mine for some 
years now.  Not as intriguing as the cube of course, but still fun.

That&#x27;s awesome news! I&#x27;m impressed that you were able to get
sponsorship from your company. Very cool. :)

Just curious... Are other people looking for sponsorship? Or just
saving up for the trip?

Re your other comments, I was away for a few days last week and I&#x27;m
struggling to catch up on messages now. I don&#x27;t think I would ever be
able to catch up if I was only up to April posts! It&#x27;d be cool if you
can catch up though because there have been plenty of interesting
discussions since April. :)

to work.  I was debating today about whether to bring it, because I had <br>
more luggage than usual.  I decided I needed something to occupy my <br>
time so I brought it along, played with it on the train and then put it <br>
in my coat pocket.  While I&#x27;m walking to work I&#x27;m like, where&#x27;s my <br>
cube??  Uggh.<br>
<br>
Then I was tinkering with my Meffert&#x27;s cube at work and of course it <br>
was locking up.  I kept turning, as I usually do in a vain attempt to <br>
get it &#x27;used&#x27; to imprecise turning.  POW!  The green side promptly <br>
exploded, and the center pin broke.  Double uggh.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok so I&#x27;m sitting here preping a lot of new black DIY cubes and have <br>
a few hints for people. (Hem 140 posts behind.)<br>
<br>
The center caps keep falling off so they need to be glued on, right? <br>
Well on the white DIY, the caps stay on by themselves. What I have <br>
been doing tonight since I still would like to adjust the tension <br>
later is lay down a few dozen of these guys with the inside facing <br>
up, neaty aligned, and spraying a generous amount of &quot;can spray <br>
glue&quot; (lightly for a long duration as to prevent them from flying <br>
around - getting glue on the outside is BAD).<br>
<br>
Another thing, the zinc washers that Stefan and I use, don&#x27;t quite <br>
fit into the center pieces... they do fit the white DIYs though. <br>
Thus I had to do quite a bit of forcing:<br>
<br>
Screw+washer+spring+washer+center piece+kernel<br>
<br>
I started out by applying a great amount of force (~50lbs lol) to <br>
get the washer in, but then I came to my senses and screwed the <br>
screw in until it sunk in and then backing it out just a bit (I <br>
recommend 2 mm for now, b4 putting on the pieces and doing a fine-<br>
tuning).<br>
<br>
To get this going, I sorted everything, collecting all the corners <br>
into one bag, edges into another, springs, screws, etc.... (I don&#x27;t <br>
recommend the rivets at all; nor am I convinced of their *plastic* <br>
washers.)<br>
<br>
So why am I spending hours prepping all these cubes tonight, you <br>
might be curious to ask...?<br>
<br>
I am supposed to teach a topic of choice tommorrow to a classroom of <br>
grad students in engineering.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s part of a mandatory multi-session teaching thing I&#x27;m doing. <br>
It&#x27;s some sort of GSI (grad student instructor) teacher-training <br>
thing for first-year instructors. Tommorrow I am supposed give a bit <br>
of a talk on a topic of choice and there will be a prize given to <br>
the best (most interactive/audience participation) speaker. It&#x27;ll be <br>
taped too. I want to WIN obviously!<br>
<br>
So I wanted to make a classroom-set of (perhaps speed-) cubes :).<br>
<br>
Not sure if you can get more active participation than that! Getting <br>
late and I still have to make a handout of a &quot;beginner solution&quot;... <br>
hemmmmm.... I&#x27;m looking to be lazy now and use Jasmine&#x27;s material <br>
(credited of course).<br>
<br>
BTW, the rubiks.com custom stickers kit SUCKS. Just wasted so much <br>
money... maybe we could get cubesmith to do something superior for <br>
us, eh?<br>

It will be easier to play with once you break it in a little, I
haven&#x27;t lubed mine but I don&#x27;t try to speedsolve it and it turns
pretty well now that I&#x27;ve solved it a few times. Mostly it just sits
there looking pretty though.

The 10 Color Dogic, in case you haven&#x27;t tried it is almost a
completely different puzzle despite being the same mechanism as the
regular 12 color Dogic. If you want a different challenge, the 10
Color Dogic is pretty tough, I&#x27;d say harder than the 12 color.

They&#x27;re both Fun though!

a multitude of BLD solves and all were in vain. i always forgot the

it would have been nice if it had gone ok in front of him. maybe next
time.

          <div class="email-content">About the Rubik&#x27;s DIY plastic washers:

When my cube was about 4 months old, I removed the screws completely 
(after having not messed with them in a while) just to check on the 
status of things.  Three of the plastic washers had disintegrated 
completely, two were cracked in half, and the last was a shell of 
its former self (worn very thin and brittle).  I wish that I had
checked on them sooner, as the springs did some damage to the 
insides of the centers.  (I guess I should also flatten the ends of 
my springs like you smart people recommend.)

This was discussed at length on twistypuzzles.com

http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3420

In particular, see the photos posted by Etienne de Foras on Jan 26.  In 
my opinion, the problem in the second photo (with 2 red circles) is the 
worse of the 2 defects he describes.  You can sand away the excess 
material quite easily, and this helps significantly.

However, Stefan P has also mentioned (where?) that using weaker springs 
solves a lot of the new-dogic problem.

Nope.

I&#x27;ve cut the pins smaller so the cap fits into the cubie and made some 
scractches around the wall under the cap and cut the excess edges of 
the cap while sitting on/in the cubie and they stay perfectly. Without 
glue. I hate glue.

Mmh, that&#x27;d be sad. I thought they&#x27;d fit but admittedly I never tried 
it. The holes just looked as large as those of standard 80s cubes in 
which our washers fit nicely.

> nor am I convinced of their *plastic* washers.

So far I thought they&#x27;re great but after reading that other post I 
should maybe check mine...

<br>
Unexpectedly, I finished at 2nd in Japanese Championship. Megahouse <br>
will sponsor me to WC2005. So I will be in Florida. <br>
I look forward to meeting with you guys again. <br>
<br>
In Japanese Championship, there were 77 competitors in 3x3 speed <br>
solving competition. <br>
Competitor&#x27;s age varied from 7 to 72. <br>
<br>
Fastest time of oldest competitor was 61.56. <br>
I believe this must be the official world record of the oldest <br>
solver. <br>
Isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t see any information about oldest solvers in unofficial <br>
records whereas there are lists about youngest solvers. <br>
<br>
Here is the question. <br>
Evenif he is the one, he is going to renew his own record everyday. <br>
I think we need to categorize elder solvers. <br>
<br>
He proposes age group for 60 and older cubers. <br>
I don&#x27;t know how many old cubers are here. <br>
<br>
We also propose another age group for young cubers (12 and younger). <br>
<br>
How do you guys think about them? <br>

Oldest solver around here may be Rune Wesström -
Final, Swedish Cube Day 2004: 44.90 (average) 38.74 (best) 
Definitely older than 72 last year.

> He proposes age group for 60 and older cubers. 

This seems very arbitrary.  Why not 35 years? ;)

> We also propose another age group for young cubers (12 and 
younger). 

Ditto, but I expect most people will disagree with me.

Yeah, I suggest these groups instead, at least they make some sense:

- 8 and younger
- 27 and younger
- 64 and younger
- 125 and younger
- 216 and younger

Uh, of course they shouldn&#x27;t overlap, so make it 28-64 etc. Also, care 
must be taken to prevent cheating. For example, society makes me round 
down and say I&#x27;m &quot;28 years old&quot; but I shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be 
listed as &quot;28 and younger&quot; since I&#x27;m actually (a few months) older 
than 28.

Yes you did (in the subject) but there are still several types of 5x5 
(current Rubik, old Rubik, Eastsheen, Meffert). At least the Eastsheen 
differs considerably from the others.

Yeah, I suggest these groups instead, at least they make some sense:

- 8 and younger
- 27 and younger
- 64 and younger
- 125 and younger
- 216 and younger

Logical, but not very helpful.  People get all sentimental about the 
old and the very young and then forget about the middle-aged, who in 
fact have much less free time to devote to cubing.  

This neglected and disadvantaged group needs some encouragement.  We 
could start by introducing a special category for people born in the 
first six months of 1962.  That might give me a sporting chance, anyhow.

That&#x27;s where the figure came from, but I don&#x27;t think cubing is like 
tennis, say, where being over ~35 puts you at a huge disadvantage 
physically.  

Age categories seem rather patronizing to me in any case.  &quot;Under 12&quot; 
and (especially) &quot;over 60&quot; would be very small groups in practice, so 
we&#x27;d just be saying: Here&#x27;s a little competition you have a good 
chance of winning.  And I don&#x27;t think that would be doing a favour to 
anyone&#x27;s self-respect.

However, I appreciate that others may feel very differently about it.

Mike

How about a category for those born on Feb. 21, 1985 between 12:30 pm
and 12:40 pm EST?

This is not only directed and Jon, but anyone that is being 
sponsored for the WC2005.  

How does sponsorship work in the cubing world? It is usually based 
on a give and take relationship.  You are taking the money to put 
towards expenses.  How do you give to the company to make it worth 
their money? Do you have to wear hats or shirts with the company 
name or logo displayed? Do you have to mention the company in 
interviews? 

And this is directed at anyone. I know this is not an issue now, but 
do we foresee there ever being political issues that arise from this 
type of relationship in the future (i.e. a cigarette company 
sponsoring someone, as one example)?

Do you mean me?

I don&#x27;t know about other sports. I&#x27;m a cuber. So I think it&#x27;s very 
natural to suggest cube numbers (8, 27, 64, 125) as limits. Did you 
realize this? This time I was *not* kidding.

Also, I think 8 is a fine limit because kids that young are still 
quite small and have small hands so they&#x27;re actually facing a problem 
that older people don&#x27;t have. Also, there *are* a few cubing kids that 
young, so it&#x27;s not an empty set.

The 64 limit is also good, it gets fairly close to the 60 suggested 
before, and I think it&#x27;s around when people retire from work which is 
a big change in life so putting the limit there would be nice.

Also, both 8 and 64 are powers of 2, so they&#x27;re nicely written as 1000 
and 1000000 in binary which I hope everybody agrees is the coolest 
base.

Cheers!
Stefan

Ok. I personally prefer to not use spray and to disassemble my puzzles 
for cleaning and lubing.

Peter Greenwood a while ago made two nice pages about how to 
disassemble and assemble a rubiks.com 5x5:

I agree that a special category, &quot;sub-12&quot;, would encourage young 
people and it&#x27;s a good thing. *If* there are enough competitors to 
justify a special event.

&gt;Séb astien. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Is this bad for us? <br>
&gt; I think at least rewarding kids should facilitate expansion of our <br>
&gt; community. <br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Masayuki<br>
<br>
I totally agree with Masayuki on this point.  I think we need to <br>
rewards the younger kids (7-8 or younger) who go to competitions.  I <br>
mean this could be done with a kids event or something similar.<br>
<br>
We could even just give away medals or ribbons or whatever if you&#x27;re <br>
under 10 or some set age.  Or we could rank kids by age group (as <br>
the sport stacking (formerly cupstacking but they officially <br>
renamed) does.<br>
<br>
So kids could opt for the &quot;official&quot; 3x3 event, or to be ranked by <br>
their age groups.<br>
<br>
Again the sportstacking community is very big into promoting things <br>
for kids.<br>
<br>
Granted their sport is, in general, targeted more towards kids than <br>
adults but I&#x27;ve heard lots of stories of former kid stackers who <br>
stick with it.<br>
<br>
I think we should consider some sort of kids event.<br>
<br>
My sister is 5 years old right now, and of course there are always <br>
cubes around so whenever I&#x27;m home we&#x27;ll play with the cube at least <br>
a little bit.<br>
<br>
She can&#x27;t solve it, but she&#x27;s getting really good at undoing 2 and 3 <br>
move scrambles from solved.  I don&#x27;t push things onto her very much <br>
because I just want her to enjoy cubing right now, and if she wants <br>
to speedcube later then I&#x27;ll teach her all that stuff.  Right now I <br>
just want her to enjoy the idea of playing with a cube.<br>
<br>
I think it would be cool, obviously time permitting of course, to <br>
let kids get awards.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a &quot;sovle from n scrambled moves competition&quot; for kids who <br>
can&#x27;t solve yet.  You could cap the participation at say 7-8 years <br>
old.<br>
<br>
Again this is all super-wishful thinking and I realize we don&#x27;t have <br>
a lot of time for extra events.  But as a &quot;maybe one day&quot; kind of <br>
thought I think we should at least consider trying to promote to <br>
kids that the cube is not impossible, just another fun puzzle.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m trying to do the same with my sister, I don&#x27;t want her to grow <br>
up thinking this thing is too hard, but rather be learning slowly <br>
but surely how to solve one by other cool little puzzles within the <br>
puzzle.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts, but I agree with Masayuki, I think we should <br>
appeal to the younger kids more at competitions somehow.<br>

How many (solved) combinations are there to the rubik&#x27;s bricks?<br>

Say we fix the orientation of the red bars as from the back face to <br>

rotate that configuration of the pieces 8 different ways, but the cube <br>
is still put together the same way.<br>
<br>
So how many ways are there to solve this puzzle without overcounting <br>
the same puzzle pieces configuration (don&#x27;t allow rotations I mean).<br>

I&#x27;ve already found 8 solutions.  Well... counting rotations of <br>

          <div class="email-content">During the Swedish Open last weekend, the age distribution of the 
competitors was as follows:

below 13: 0
13-19: 8
20-29: 9
30-39: 0 ! (one was registered but severely injuded his hand a few 
days before the competition)
40-45: 7
above 45: 0 (Rune could not come)

Interesting that nobody aged 30-39 showed up. Perhaps that 
generation is lost since they were too young during the cube hype 
during the eighties.

I just don&#x27;t understand why they call hand pads &quot;cumbersome&quot;. Aren&#x27;t

Oldest solver around here may be Rune Wesström -
Final, Swedish Cube Day 2004: 44.90 (average) 38.74 (best) 
Definitely older than 72 last year.

This seems very arbitrary.  Why not 35 years? ;)

> We also propose another age group for young cubers (12 and 
younger). 

Ditto, but I expect most people will disagree with me.

          <div class="email-content">Whether or not it is &#x27;better&#x27; is a personal issue and opinion.  The  <br>
fact remains that the timer is not endorsed by the WCA and will never  <br>
be used in official WCA competitions.  Times and records set with that  <br>
timer cannot and will not be accepted with any authority whatsoever.   <br>
Even by the rules set forth on the unofficial records pages, averages  <br>
measured by that timer are unacceptable.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I felt pretty insulted that this guy designed a timer and  <br>
tried to make it the &#x27;official&#x27; timer for Rubik&#x27;s Cube competitions  <br>
without even consulting with the people who hold Rubik&#x27;s Cube  <br>
competitions.  He had no authority to dictate the way I have done  <br>
things.  He hasn&#x27;t spent the effort of running competitions.  Whereas I  <br>
appreciate his effort in making a timer, I am pretty convinced he  <br>
designed it only for commercial gain and not for the benefit of the  <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube community.  It would have been quite simple for him to see  <br>
who was holding the competitions, how the competitions were being held,  <br>
and just send off an e-mail to the people who spend their time and  <br>
effort to run these competitions to see if they would be open to using  <br>
a timer of that design and concept.  Otherwise, criticism from the  <br>
competition organizers could have been taken into account during the  <br>
initial design stages of the timer.  He could have worked with us to  <br>
design a timer we would have liked, but he chose not to.<br>
<br>
You can spend $100 on a timer if you wish but I believe StackMats are  <br>
now half that price.  If you really want features such as generated  <br>
scrambles and calculating of rolling averages, you should just download  <br>
JNetCube instead.  If having a timer that has these features on the  <br>
road is THAT important to you and you are unable to leave your computer  <br>
and go anywhere without JNetCube, I suggest you get a life.  Cubing is  <br>
great and it&#x27;s wonderful and it&#x27;s certainly an addicting hobby, but no  <br>
one is ever going to make money as a cuber.  Why?  It takes very little  <br>
time to get up to the top levels.  Chess players dedicate their lives,  <br>
practicing, studying 8 to 10 hours a day so they can play the game.  I  <br>
think if most people cubed 8 hours a day, studying the cube as a job,  <br>
we&#x27;d be seeing 12 second averages all the time.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, if you forget to stop the hand pads at a competition,  <br>
that&#x27;s really your fault.  The official timer of the WCA is currently  <br>
the StackMat.  I do not condone Rubik&#x27;s for putting their &quot;Official  <br>
Seal of Approval&quot; on their website regarding this timer, especially  <br>
because they sponsor the WC 2005 and WC 2005 follows the regulations of  <br>
the WCA which means they will be using StackMat timers.<br>
<br>
It is a sad reminder for me the honesty may only be present in the  <br>
absence of commercial gain.<br>

<br>
I am not an employee of Rubik and so I say this very loud and clear.  <br>
If you want an official timer, buy a StackMat.  If you&#x27;re with Rubik <br>
and you&#x27;re upset with me, you should have thought about this sooner... <br>
or design a timer which operates under the principals of the StackMat, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, Chalmers Open 2005 indeed had ten competitors. The tenth, Geir 
Ugelstad, did not participate in the 3x3x3 speedcubing event, only 
in the 3x3x3 speed blindfolded event.

The rules according to speedcubing.com are, I quote:

- The competition must have at least 10 competitors. 
- There must be an audience of at least 6 persons, other than the 
competitors. 

Thus, the audience must be at least six persons and not ten.

Unless there is a blatant breach of code or conduct, I see nothing 
wrong with holding a competition.

So sad, Lesotho hasn&#x27;t had a competition there.  We should cut out 
California competitions to balance it out.

          <div class="email-content">I sent him some ideas via his web feedback form.  I told him we didn&#x27;t want to adopt his 
timer as the official timer because it worked on a different principle than the stackmat and 
in order to facilitate a bridge between the timers, he should include attachable handpads 
as a means of starting and stopping the timer.  So to my credit, I sent in feedback.

Furthermore, what you decide to do and what you prefer, such as having a computer 
screen in front of you, or not liking a computer screen, or whatever your preference, does 
not concern a competition.  The competition is not about making things comfortable for 
everyone.  It&#x27;s about ensuring a fair environment with set standards.

We&#x27;ve gone through this countless of times.  I&#x27;m so tired of having to explain the same 
things over and over again.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

To me the decision alo seems very easy. The stackmat timer has been 
around for a long time already, besides for cupstacking also as a 
cubing (and other twisty puzzles) timing device. It costs much less 
and is more handy to transport. Im not gonna discuss any technical 
issues. But the way competitions are organised and run, at the 
moment the new timer&#x27;s extra functionality seems redundant.

It&#x27;s just my opinion. Don&#x27;t shoot me ;-)

Cheers!

-Per

PS! As i have posted before a better idea would have been to sell 
the new timer using different channels in order to keep the price 
down. The future will tell which one we eventually gonna use ...

<br>
For the people said the StackMat timer has flaws, I encourage you to <br>
bring them up.  Now, keep in mind, I&#x27;m not after flaws like, &quot;It <br>
doesn&#x27;t allow us to calculate averages.&quot; because things like that don&#x27;t <br>
concern us in a competition.  What you prefer in your own home is not <br>
my business.  If you&#x27;d like to purchase the new timer for your own home <br>
use, go ahead.  What I&#x27;m looking for are competition flaws with the <br>
StackMat timer.  What is a flaw with the StackMat that allows loopholes <br>
in fair play?<br>
<br>
And please don&#x27;t try to give me the &quot;starting and stopping the timer <br>

This leads to the possibility of a record being set by current
standards still being faster than if you were to use the new timer and
get a faster time with the new timer that would have been slower by
old standards.  Basically, you throw 2 years of competitions
statistics out the window.

It IS the inventor&#x27;s fault because he chose to get it approved by
SevenTowns.  No?

Hrmm...how about printing 50 scrambles and taking them with you (a
.00x ounce sheet of paper!) and then entering them into a spreadsheet?

Side note:  (For example) For timing the magic, you would a different
timer, so you would have to use stackmats anyway!  It doesn&#x27;t look
like it fits. :-P

Not near Tulsa, though. I&#x27;m at OU in Norman for the time being.

and I are looking to visit your aquarium up there, when we do I&#x27;ll be

  I also know 3-4 cubers down here in Norman (including one I had the
pleasure of meeting just today) who might be interested in getting
together some time for some good old fashioned cube madness.  Finding
good ground between Tulsa and Norman shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, and I&#x27;d

I am not trying to hinder people from holding

I was just clarifying what I was understanding.

This is really strange...

I live in Davis! It&#x27;s odd you would ask about cubers in such a small
town, but surely enough, I&#x27;m here.  I&#x27;m 16 and go to Davis High, and I
wasn&#x27;t planning on going to the contest.  I&#x27;ve never been nor competed
in any of them before. I&#x27;d like to finally meet some other cubers, and
I might be interested in a group or club.   I don&#x27;t lnow of anyne else
in Davis who is active in this community.  I only know one other
person at my school who can cube.

&gt;We let the youngest competitors (13-14 years old) pick items <br>

The youngest and oldest cubers should be different in each <br>

<br>
Tyson:<br>
&gt;Are you talking about having an entirely separate competition or <br>

It depends how may kids are there and how fast they are. <br>
If we have, let&#x27;s say, more than 10 kids, may be we can have <br>
separate competition. <br>
If the number is small, we can include them into regular <br>
competition. <br>
They still have chance to set true official world record. <br>
<br>
I worry if we separate kids competition completely, someone may <br>
argue about their record when he/she set a world record by chance. <br>
<br>
<br>
I hear a lot of positive comments about world ranking lists (Thanks <br>
Ron) evenif they rank close to bottom. <br>
<br>
Chris:<br>
&gt;So kids could opt for the &quot;official&quot; 3x3 event, or to be ranked by <br>
&gt;their age groups.<br>
&gt;The sportstacking community is very big into promoting things <br>
&gt;for kids.<br>
&gt;I think we should consider some sort of kids event.<br>

I also hope to have a world ranking in age group at least for kids. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Accurate for what?  How are you defining accurate?<br>
<br>
We&#x27;ve defined accurate and we&#x27;ve defined the time of the solve to be <br>
from when the competitor lifts up his hands to when the competitor <br>
places his hands down.  Being &quot;faster&quot; does not mean more accurate.  <br>
People who would otherwise receive two second penalties would not <br>
because they could correct their error after the time has been stopped. <br>
  Using two hands and the hand pads ENSURES that the cuber cannot <br>
manipulate the cube before time is started and must stop manipulating <br>
the cube before time is stopped.<br>
<br>
The word &#x27;accurate&#x27; and the words &#x27;time of solving the cube&#x27; have been <br>
defined by people who spent many hours thinking of ways to make sure <br>
all cube solve are uniform and no one has an advantage over anyone <br>
else.<br>

          <div class="email-content">As long as the fundamental rankings list is not altered, I think it <br>
might be enjoyable for today&#x27;s youth to see themselves in their own <br>
list.  However, I also kind of feel this is not as significant as other <br>

really see young children being disadvantaged at the cube compared to <br>
adults.  Imagine two years ago if we had a 13 and under division.  The <br>
number one kid would have been the number one in the world.<br>
<br>
We might want to consider at what age in cubing to kids become <br>
&#x27;adults&#x27;.  Children in events such as chess have not had as much <br>
experience.  Now, children in cubing don&#x27;t has as much experience <br>
either, but the time scale for mastery of the cube is far less than <br>
chess.<br>

&gt; argue about their record when he/she set a world record by chance.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I hear a lot of positive comments about world ranking lists (Thanks<br>
&gt; Ron) evenif they rank close to bottom.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Chris:<br>
&gt;&gt; So kids could opt for the &quot;official&quot; 3x3 event, or to be ranked by<br>
&gt;&gt; their age groups.<br>
&gt;&gt; The sportstacking community is very big into promoting things<br>
&gt;&gt; for kids.<br>
&gt;&gt; I think we should consider some sort of kids event.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I also hope to have a world ranking in age group at least for kids.<br>

i recently got a timer, but for some reason, it turns off at random
points of time. i have no idea why, but i suspect that maybe the
battery is low or something. has anyone else come across this
problem??

thats the only real problem i can think of. the reset thing you can
get used to, and in my opinion its a little more sensitive, which is
kinda nice. anyways, just my 2 cents

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s really odd.  The timer has an automatic shut off after 10 
minutes, but it shouldn&#x27;t be shutting off randomly.  If the battery is 
low, the timer should display &#x27;low battery&#x27; each time after you stop

          <div class="email-content">Yea, see I thought it was the 10 minute thing at first as well. But
then i realized that I was solving a 4x4 and i usually average just
above 2 minutes :-/ And then it started happening to my brother when
he was doing speedstacks (which takes under 20 seconds). Though it
seems very strange if the battery was low, as it did that the day we
opened it :-/ I&#x27;ll call them and find out.

Though this brings up a question. What if a timer like this ends up in
a competition and does this during a solve??

  Accurate for what?  How are you defining accurate?<br>
<br>
  Accurate is this context is the time to solve the puzzle. period<br>
  Have you ever completed a puzzle and not hit both handpads at the<br>
  same time, or not hit them hard enough. Having to hit a hand pad <br>
  at all automatically increases the time after completing the puzzle.<br>
<br>
  Having to place the completed puzzle on one timing device in my opinion<br>
  would make this step faster and closer to the truer time of the solve. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  We&#x27;ve defined accurate and we&#x27;ve defined the time of the solve to be <br>
  from when the competitor lifts up his hands to when the competitor <br>
  places his hands down.  Being &quot;faster&quot; does not mean more accurate.  <br>
<br>
<br>
  I thought this was the whole idea behind speedcubing. the be the fastest.<br>
<br>
<br>
  People who would otherwise receive two second penalties would not <br>
  because they could correct their error after the time has been stopped. <br>
<br>
  This is why you have judges at the competitions to ensure this does not happen. <br>
<br>
  Anyone correcting their errors after the time is stopped or manipulating their puzzle<br>
  before starting the timer should be DQ.<br>
<br>
<br>
    Using two hands and the hand pads ENSURES that the cuber cannot <br>
  manipulate the cube before time is started and must stop manipulating <br>
  the cube before time is stopped.<br>
<br>
  The word &#x27;accurate&#x27; and the words &#x27;time of solving the cube&#x27; have been <br>
  defined by people who spent many hours thinking of ways to make sure <br>
  all cube solve are uniform and no one has an advantage over anyone <br>
  else.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmm... offensive clothing?  That&#x27;s pretty broad.  I mean, David 
Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; shirt could be considered offensive by many 
people.  In my opinion, that was a little bad taste.  He knew there 
would publicity at that competition.  A cube competition is no place to

          <div class="email-content">I used to advocate the new timer, for various reasons.  However, I
think now that, for competition purposes, the Stackmats are better. 
They aren&#x27;t optimal, but they&#x27;re the best current method. They prevent
cheating, are relatively inexpensive, they&#x27;ve been well tested, and
they work.  Switching to a new timing method not only invalidates old
records, but provides us with difficulties in judging and procedure. 
Until a new method is clearly and greatly advantageous, changing over
would only be counterproductive.

The designer of the new timer, if he had really wanted to make a
successful product, and advance the sport, would have delved into
video analysis.  

As Chris Hardwick mentioned before, high speed video analysis would be
the most accurate and most fair timing method, but it&#x27;s too expensive
and cumbersome now.

Until it becomes more readily available, the stackmat timers are the
most accurate, the most fair, and the cheapest timing product out there.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, thank you.  Until someone can really say that a new method is <br>
absolutely amazing and far better than what we&#x27;re using now, there&#x27;s no <br>
reason to switch.<br>
<br>
I, unfortunately, disagree with your opinion that high speed video <br>
analysis would be the most accurate and most fair timing method.  I&#x27;ll <br>
try to restrain myself because I already gave Quinn an earful for this <br>
same assumption.  So, if you&#x27;re video taping someone, when are you <br>
going to start the time?  This question isn&#x27;t so hard is it?  You&#x27;re <br>
going to say you start the time when the cube first moves.  Is it when <br>
the cube first moves or when the cuber touches the cube?  What if he <br>
intended to make a move, touched the cube, but his hand slipped and he <br>
didn&#x27;t make a move?  If you drop the shuttlecock in badminton and you <br>
take a swing and you miss, hey, you lose the serve.  (It&#x27;s not the case <br>
in table tennis.  But this is irrelevant.)<br>
<br>
All right, so how are you going to define when the timer is stopped.  <br>
When the cube is solved of course!  Okay, I&#x27;m going to give you <br>
unlimited resources here.  You have infinite time, everything, precise <br>
cameras, judges... everything.  Given unlimited resources, write me a <br>
set of regulations, using video analysis, that defines precisely when <br>
the timer should be stopped.  Is it when the final face is aligned?  <br>
How aligned does it have to be?  Are you going to stop the timer <br>
precisely when the edge of the corner passes the column as defined for <br>
the 2 second penalty rule?<br>
<br>
What if someone gets lucky?  Are you going to give them the benefit of <br>
having a shorter time, and not having to react to the fact that the <br>
cube is actually solved?  Guy gets lucky, and solves the cube in 14 <br>
seconds.  Instead, after the OLL since he didn&#x27;t know the cube would be <br>
solved, using a normal timer, he would have been stunned for just a <br>
fraction of time, and then reacted to hitting the pads.  That&#x27;s maybe <br>
.3 seconds right there.  That&#x27;s .3 seconds which I think is valid <br>
because, since he was lucky, he wasn&#x27;t prepared.  We shouldn&#x27;t reward <br>
people for not knowing their cube is solved.<br>
<br>
If you want to claim that high speed video analysis is the most <br>
accurate and fair method of timing, then I challenge you to write a set <br>
of regulations that define exactly how you would implement the said <br>
timing.  And, I&#x27;m giving you the ability to use unlimited resources.  <br>
Now, who could be nicer than me?<br>

Thanks for sharing your sponsorship agreement, Grant.  I am aware, as 
Bob pointed out, that there is an actual rule about offensive content 
on clothing.  What I am asking about is not offensive in its primary 
message.  With the talk today about trying to encourage children to 
participate and become active in the cubing world, I would think 
someone showing up decked out in a Camel or Marlboro outfit because 
the company, for publicity, is sponsoring him or her would be 
extremely bad taste.  But I now understand that there are no real 
rules on the subject.  Do we wait until this situation arises to make 
a rule, or do we just say that it is all fair game?

I agree with Tyson, that the definition of &quot;offensive&quot; is rather 
subjective.  I think outside of blatant vulgarity there is little 
that someone could wear that would result in the organizers raising 
issue.  It is too bad that some people don&#x27;t have the common courtesy 
or commonsense to pick their personal messages accordingly.

          <div class="email-content">I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the rule, so I looked it up:
&quot;Clothes can not display vulgar language or have inappropriate 
pictures.&quot;

So &quot;Jesus Is Lord&quot; was acceptable within the rules, and it may have 
been precisely because of the potential publicity that he chose to 
wear that shirt that day--isn&#x27;t that what anyone who has a message 
they want to advertise would do?  Same reason sponsors put their 
logos on clothing.  

I guess I don&#x27;t see a signfiicant distinction between one&#x27;s right of 
commercial promotion vs. religious promotion--it&#x27;s America, free 
speech reigns, and I don&#x27;t have to agree with everything others try 
to promote, I can just tune it out without taking offense.  People 
should be able to promote whatever they want to, be it at a cube 
competion or anywhere else (though a restriction on vulgarity or 
inappropriate pictures seems reasonable given that children will be 
present).  

just exercising my First Amendment rights...

competitor want&#x27;s to minimize that extra time. And even though I do know <br>
you don&#x27;t want to hear it, I&#x27;ve seen people hit the reset button. Sure <br>
you might say that it&#x27;s the competitors fault and he/she only has <br>
him/herself to blame. Well, we tell them about the reset-issue before <br>
hand, but that makes people who have never seen a StackMat before get <br>
even worse times, because it makes them nervous about stopping the timer <br>
correctly. I&#x27;ve also witnessed Geir do his Speedblindfolded solve and he <br>
has to stop the timer with his blinfold still on. On his first attempt <br>
he actually hit the reset button when doing this and it was a great <br>
relief to see that he hadn&#x27;t finished. I would have fet really awkward <br>
if a successful attempt by him had beed DQ because what I believe to be <br>
a flaw on the timer. This all also makes the fastest cubers not only be <br>
fast at the cube, but they also need that special StackMat training.  <br>
But any one can buy a StackMat and prattice at home can&#x27;t they? Well... <br>
no. First of, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, and to have it shipped to places <br>
like Sweden is a real pain. I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to &quot;force&quot; <br>
people who want god times to buy a timer. Sure, we give the competitors <br>
some time to familiarize themselves with the pad on competition, but <br>
it&#x27;s not enough in my opinion.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not saying the new timer is better, just that we should give it a <br>
try or two. I know it will be available to try out on the WC 2005 (no, <br>
it&#x27;s not going to be used in competition), so why don&#x27;t everyone who go <br>
there just try it out? Then we will know for sure if it&#x27;s crap or not. <br>
Will U layer turns really be a issue after timing has stopped? Only by <br>
testing it will we know for sure.<br>

&gt;All right,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;For the people said the StackMat timer has flaws, I encourage you to <br>
&gt;bring them up.  Now, keep in mind, I&#x27;m not after flaws like, &quot;It <br>
&gt;doesn&#x27;t allow us to calculate averages.&quot; because things like that don&#x27;t <br>
&gt;concern us in a competition.  What you prefer in your own home is not <br>
&gt;my business.  If you&#x27;d like to purchase the new timer for your own home <br>
&gt;use, go ahead.  What I&#x27;m looking for are competition flaws with the <br>
&gt;StackMat timer.  What is a flaw with the StackMat that allows loopholes <br>
&gt;in fair play?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;And please don&#x27;t try to give me the &quot;starting and stopping the timer <br>
&gt;isn&#x27;t a part of solving the cube&quot; because it is and I&#x27;ve explained that <br>
&gt;a countless number of times.  And don&#x27;t give me arguments about hitting <br>
&gt;the reset buttons either because that&#x27;s your own fault.  And if you try <br>
&gt;to say it&#x27;s not your fault, we&#x27;re all going to think in some manner of <br>
&gt;you because you are basically saying you lack the skill and finesse to <br>
&gt;&#x27;not&#x27; hit the reset button.  Seriously, the guy solves a Rubik&#x27;s Cube <br>
&gt;in like, 20 seconds and he can&#x27;t avoid hitting a button?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;What competition flaws does the StackMat have?  We all have our <br>
&gt;preferences, but we have to put those aside when trying to come up with <br>
&gt;a standard.<br>

I don&#x27;t think we need to throw them out the window just beacuase the 
timing is a little different. But even if we do, is it really so bad? I 
think all current records will be beaten eventually. Many sports &quot;reset&quot; 
their records now and then because the rules or devices used have 
changed. I wonder how many times the Javelin Throw record has been reset.

Well, we have to assume he want&#x27;s to have least some money for all his

Well... call me lazy that feels very labour intensive. It takes quite 
some time writing down say 50 solves and then entering them into a 
spreadsheet. And I won&#x27;t even know my average until I do it. It seems 
convenient to have it built in, into the timer for home practicing.

I agree about that it probably would be a problem timing the magic. You 
should give it a try or two on the new timer, but there I put my money 
on the StackMat beforehand. This is a problem for me to as you might 
recognize me as the Swedish Champion in Rubiks Magic, with an awesome 
record average of 3.42 :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jim,
Paul Nixon and I discussed this during our UK weekend this summer.  As some 
of my L2L strategies only require two F2L pairs along with a completed top 
layer this is one way of starting which could easily be used by Fridrich 
solvers too.  I have my own way of getting to a similar position which is 
just as fast but I believe Paul was going to try using the Petrus approach 
before going into an L2L finish.

However, on the stats page, what&#x27;s &quot;region A&quot; and &quot;region B&quot; (appears

Also, the first second of the countdown is (on my computer) a bit fast, 
after that it&#x27;s fine. Nice work though.

Is it supposed to be single user only or will it support multiple

When clicking the &quot;window&quot; I get an error message &quot;This Account Has

No really, I knwo it&#x27;s not finished. I just thought he wanted to 
know about issues just in case he missed them himself.

Looking forward to the first release.

&gt; However, on the stats page, what&#x27;s &quot;region A&quot; and &quot;region B&quot; (appears<br>

<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s a bug. The chart component does that when it fails to get new data. <br>

          <div class="email-content">I think that the stackmat is better for competitions than the new 
timer, because it doesn&#x27;t allow cheating. As cheating I mean the 
availability to turn faces before lift the cube, and after putting 
it down, from the timer.

I think that high speed video analysis isn&#x27;t a very good idea. In 
track&amp;field events you could use that approach to messure exactly 
how high the highjumper jums and what time  the sprinter gets. I 
don&#x27;t think I want that kind of messurement, it sems so unnatural.

This is single user and you should have it installed in your own server.
I don&#x27;t want the responsibility of keeping other peoples times in my server.
It&#x27;s fairly easy to make it multi user, I&#x27;ll do that in a future version.

When clicking the &quot;window&quot; I get an error message &quot;This Account Has

That&#x27;s new to me. Can you send me your system data like browser version and 
OS?

Will this be an &quot;open source&quot; project? :)


Yes. I&#x27;ll just check the licence for the components I use and see it&#x27;s 
possible to GPL it.

Fault of the cuber, not the timer.


- People do get the chance to get used to stackmats at competitions 
before the real competition.

- How can you seriously say someone can be a top cuber but not learn 
hwo to use the stackmat?

- Chris has made nice demonstration videos people can watch 
beforehand.

- People *can* practice *beforehand at home* with PC simulators that 
behave similarly.

- If you&#x27;re really serious about cubing, you can spend some money on a 
stackmat, just like people in other sports spend some money on their 
equipment.

- The reset-button can easily be protected if necessary like in Geir&#x27;s 
solve.

- Is this really far away from Sweden? http://www.
speedstacksscandinavia.com/dansk/

It&#x27;s natural to start solving as soon as possible and to stop the 
timer as soon as possible. That is, I might want to make a U-turn 
right at the start or right at the end, and I wouldn&#x27;t even trust 
*myself* that I don&#x27;t accidentally do it before starting or after 
stopping that new timer. With the stackmat I can be sure I didn&#x27;t 
cheat.

The duty of a timer in competition is to compare the abilities of 
competitors.

There&#x27;s just no way to &quot;exactly&quot; measure the solve time or even just 
define how to measure it, see Tyson&#x27;s comments about video analysis.

> Having to hit one pad in my opinion is faster the having to hit two.

I doubt I&#x27;d smash my puzzles onto that new timer even nearly as fast 
as I smash my hands onto the stackmat. I&#x27;d fear to damage both the 
puzzle and that new timer. Btw, I don&#x27;t know about you, but I have two 
hands. And I can move them at simultaneously. Amazing, huh?

But yes, if possible I will also try out that new timer at WC2005, 
though I can already tell you I&#x27;ll do it just for fun because I don&#x27;t 
agree with the principle it&#x27;s based on.

Yes, it is convenient, but in my opinion, not worth the extra $50. 
For $50, I would rather insert the times onto my PC manually.  Also,
did you see there is a $50 accessory package?  If you want to load
times from your timer to a speadsheet on your PC, it is an ADDITIONAL
$50.  $100 to have my times saved is not worth it.

The problem with &quot;giving it a try&quot; is that I finish my solve on the
table.  The puzzle would not be solved when I put it on the timer
because I would be mid-solution.  For the master magic, for example,
almost the entire solution is on the mat.  If it was required to do
the entire puzzle in the air, times would be ridiculously slow.

It&#x27;s not about stopping the timer but about the timer turning off. 
Also, here&#x27;s what Tyson said:

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Thinking of it i see one advantage with the new timer over the old 
stackmat. It&#x27;s got to do with fundamental design. On the new timer 
it&#x27;s actually the puzzle that starts and stops the running time. On 
the stackmat u start and stop timer using the 2 palms of ur hands. 
Now suppose a handicapped person with only 1 hand wants to 
participate in one-handed solving (or something else). How will that 
person be able to operate the stackmat? It will be fully possible 
for the person to &quot;operate&quot; the new timer. Using a simple stopwatch 
as a stackmat replacement in this case seems a bit unfair, but would 
maybe be the best solution for now, since the stackmat is official 
competition timer.

Just some thoughts. I don&#x27;t think we have the perfect timing device 
yet. Maybe it simply doesn&#x27;t exist or cannot exist. Maybe we will 
have compromises no matter what ... :-o

Easy. Instead of the second hand, use your head. It works, I tried it. 
Happy headache :-)

It also works if you cover both pads with one hand. I won&#x27;t ask to 
make it a rule, but I myself would actually like to do it that way for 
one-handed cubing, for the same reason I voted for one-handed 
preinspection (which is now in the rules), namely that it&#x27;s more 
natural. 

Cheers!
Stefan

That won&#x27;t work. The stackmat doesn&#x27;t work with pressure. It works 
with electricity that goes from one pad through your body to the other 
pad. Try put a book on the pads, no matter how hard you push it down, 
it won&#x27;t have any effect.

Similarly, it won&#x27;t help if the judge puts a hand on the other pad, 
unless he also touches the competitor skin-to-skin. But I&#x27;m not sure 
this would work, of course the longer the electricity has to &quot;travel&quot;, 
the more likely it gets it&#x27;s not strong enough to reach the other pad.

Cheers!
Stefan

the timer, though that technique would work too.

I remember I had no idea I did anything different until you pointed
out that my speed solve stop was different than my demonstration stop.

I&#x27;ll try to correct this as soon as I can, I might be able to get to a
video camera this weekend, so I&#x27;ll work on fixing that.

I was almost sure this would work.  Interesting.

In the computer industry, literally in the factories where they are
made, they have carts that you have to push around on the floor with
computer parts on them.

My brother used to work at one, that&#x27;s how I know.  Anyway they had
wrist bands that you wore that had a long wire (maybe 4-5 ft. (1-1.5m
roughly)) long.  The end of this wire had a clip that you would clip
to a cart just before you touched it so you wouldn&#x27;t get shocked.  The
entire wrist band/wire/clip was metal and it basically kept you from
shocking your hand really bad each time you touched a new cart.

Could we use something like that for a disabled person?  You could
have them wear this wrist band on their hand/taped to their skin/ we
could work on that part.  Then clip the metal clip to the timer
contact.  That way when they hit the other timer contact with their
hand there is a completed circuit through them from one pad to the other.

It&#x27;s a complicated solution, and I imagine the strentgh of the signal
would be significantly weakened after passing through this wire/wrist
band thing, but maybe it just might work?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

yes, improve that :-). But your videos are already pretty good. I 
mentioned them because they show how the stackmat works and how it&#x27;s 
used. So that people are not completely new to it when they go to a 
competition.

Though I must admit it&#x27;d be good if there were an easy to find &quot;what 
you should know for competing in a contest&quot; tutorial. Nothing fancy, 
but at least a link to your page/videos and of course to the current 
rules and maybe the discussion forum for questions.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Stefan for pointing that out. I have a little question with
these points :

# There must be a WCA delegate (appointed by WCA board) attending the
competition.
# WCA delegates have to watch during the competition whether the full
regulations were followed, and advise the organising team when needed.
# WCA delegates must send a report to the WCA board within a week
after the competition.

What if the competition is taking place in some remote place where
theres no possibility of any WCA member to go there? Is the delegate
then appointed on the spot or what? And will the delegates come
anywhere they are asked to? Like in my institute for example? What abt
the travel fees?

Im sorry if this has been discussed before, but i am new to these
rules kind of stuff, so dnt be angry :)

          <div class="email-content">I personally would rather be using a stackmat in competitions. This 
new timer sounds cool, but i would much rather it having hand pads 
than that light sensor. The question is, how sensitive is it? How 
close does your cube have to be to stop the timer? Also (some one 
already said this) what if you pop, and you are planing on putting it 
back together, but the piece lands on the sensor. Is this a DNF even 
though you were planning to put it back together? Or do you get 
another time due to a timer problem? Ive NEVER heard of someone 
having a problem with the stackmat other than the reset button, but 
that can be avoided. If an edge lands on the sensor, its not your 
fault (besides the pop), so what would those rules be?

I just dont think its worth it to have to re-write a set of rules 
that have worked for so long just because some decides to make a new 
timer. I think we should stick to the stackmat which has never had 
problems before. Until someone shows us a much MUCH better way to 
accuratly take a time, the stackmat should stay.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

Even though I like the idea behind the new timer, I agree that there
is no need to change. 

When I suggested no-inspection solves, many people here surprised me
with the times they did. The same goes for &quot;scramble 25 moves and
solve.&quot; That being the case I&#x27;m making a new suggestion.

I&#x27;d like to see a 1x1x1 competition: 

Hands on the mat, pick up the cube with both hands and return the cube
to the mat on a different side from how it began, and return both
hands to the mat. I leave the the allowed inspection time to you :) 

Anyone know where I can get a 1x1x1 cube. I guess Rubik&#x27;s race game
has several. Anyone want to send me one so I can practice? :)

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">I had a similar discussion with Tyson before Chalmers Open (or maybe 
it was before SveKub Annual). At that time the rules were not as 
specific as now. As a result of our discussion, the rule &quot;The 
StackMat timer must be used for time measurement.&quot; was included in 
the regulations, and we was forced to use a stackmat in order to 
have an official tournament.

Crispy, you&#x27;re welcome. In fact, I was very happy that we had at 
least ten competitors so we did not face the problem of breaking the 
rule and the potential discussion of being accepted as official or 
not.

What we normally we do is look for someone whom we can fully trust.
Then we declare that person the WCA delegate.

So now you know that we fully trust Masayuki and Anders. :-)

Have fun (and organize competitions!),

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

For me the 10 is arbitrary. It used to be 8. For officialness we do want enough competitors to make the competition pressure better comparable between competitions.
Definitely 2 is too few. Also 5. But from 6 it starts getting less clear.
To compare it to other sports: you can not set an official WR during a local athletics club competition, or improve your Chess ELO in the fun tournament in your local pub.

I still think 10 is a good number. But if only 8 people would show up in the end, we would definitely openly discuss this on the WCA forum afterwards.

Of course you can ALWAYS organize a competition and have fun.
Hopefully one day everyone will have his chance to compete, at least in a local competition.
The way the number of competitions is rising each year from 2003, we will have 1,000 tournaments in 2007. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

  I had a similar discussion with Tyson before Chalmers Open (or maybe 
  it was before SveKub Annual). At that time the rules were not as 
  specific as now. As a result of our discussion, the rule &quot;The 
  StackMat timer must be used for time measurement.&quot; was included in 
  the regulations, and we was forced to use a stackmat in order to 
  have an official tournament.

  Crispy, you&#x27;re welcome. In fact, I was very happy that we had at 
  least ten competitors so we did not face the problem of breaking the 
  rule and the potential discussion of being accepted as official or 
  not.

          <div class="email-content">Fellow cubers,<br>
<br>
Scrambling 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 is quite hard, especially for novice <br>
scramblers with the inner slice moves (lrfbud). Therefore we <br>
investigated some options, and found out that the inner slice moves <br>
(lrfbud) do not result in better scrambles than double slice moves <br>
(Ll Rr Ff Bb Uu Dd).<br>
<br>
Because the latter moves are easier to execute we decided to change <br>
the scrambling program to use a mix of normal moves LRFBUD and <br>
double slice moves Ll Rr Ff Bb Uu Dd.<br>
<br>
Jaap was as kind as to change his programs. Just try the Multi Slice <br>
checkbox in the cube scrambling program.<br>
<br>
We are open for feedback on the WCA forum.<br>

Hello Ron.

So if i want to make my competition official, do i need to call one of
you guys to inspect it? Ofcourse im not saying that i want to make my
competition official rt now, but maybe in an year or so, we&#x27;ll have
enough speedcubers to have a decent enuf competition. Is there anyone
from India one of your delegates? And what will I have to do to be a
delegate? [Maybe bribe someone ;) ?]

Sachin.

          <div class="email-content">Thats actually great news. Being the main scrambler for all events 
except the 2x2x2 and Rubiks Magic at the Swedish Championships, I 
really appreciate it. I always dread scrambling the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 
much due to to the inner slice moves, but now I don&#x27;t have to... 
whoppeeee... hmmm... now if you only could change the scramble 
length from 40 and 60 to around 10 instead it would be great ;)

          <div class="email-content">What methods were used to determine that these scrambles were good enough?

Does it reach the same depth as scrambling with only inner slice moves?

I mean intuitively this seems like it should still create good
scrambles (using double turns), but are double turns counted as one or
two moves?  This makes a difference.

If you do (Rr) is that doing 1 or 2 moves for a competition scramble?
 if you count it as 1 then what happens if the scramble generates r R
as two single turns, would that also be counted as one move?

If you count it as two moves, what would a scamble look like that
generates all double turn and no inner slice turn scrambles?  Maybe
most of them are still veyr well scrambled, but is there a large
subset of cases where the cube is very easily setup.  Do we know about
the depth of 40 turns using no inner slice turns, only double turns?

I would like to see some more clarification of this personally.  I
think just saying it seems ok is not rigorous enough.

I think that double turns (counted as 1 move) should make scrambling
easier and should still provide good scrambles.  However, this brings
up the issue of whether the scramble generates (Rr) or r R so it can
be either 1 or 2 moves.

Can you please clarify this decision more Ron?  I&#x27;m skeptical of this
change unless it is quantified or at least backed up with some arguments.

Thanks,
Chris

P.S.  I know you guys scramble lots of cubes for competitions in a
short time, and I agree that would get old VERY quickly.  But do you
use shortcuts to simplify moves.

For example, from this scramble from JNetcube you can simplify some moves:
D2 b d2 U b u&#x27; b f u2 B&#x27; R2 r d&#x27; F2 U&#x27; B2 u2 l d L2 d2 D2 b f2 u2 F2
D2 l&#x27; D f2 R2 D2 f&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; b2 L2 R F B&#x27;

[B&#x27; R2 r d&#x27;] can simplify to [B&#x27; (Rr) R (Dd)&#x27; D]
[b f2] can simplify to [(F&#x27; f&#x27; b) (F&#x27; f&#x27;) F2]

things like that in scrambles make the scrambling a bit easier.  I&#x27;m
sure you guys already do this to some extent, but I wanted to ask.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

Of course Rr is then counted as 1 move.
We asked our expert Jaap for advice on this subject. Maybe he can explain why this is the case?

I tried it personally with increasing numbers of moves (2, 3, 4 et cetera) and indeed the scrambles look the same.
With inner slice moves, the corners are not separated from the other inner slices and the opposite outer slice. With double slice moves, the corner is not separated from the connecting inner slice, but it is from all other slices. With 40 (4x4x4) and 60 (5x5x5) mixed outer and double moves the chances are high that all pieces are separated.
But I am no expert. :-)

Btw. the 40 and 60 moves are arbitrary. We did a rough estimate of the maximum depth of these puzzles, also with help from Jaap.

Have fun,

Ron

<br>
Hi<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know exactly how different between single slice move and <br>
double. <br>
<br>
#1<br>
In Japanese Championship, we generated scrambling algorithm by <br>
Jaaps&#x27; program. <br>
#2 <br>
Translate the algorithm into another language which fit for <br>
RevengePlayer or ProfessorPlayer. <br>
<br>
As you know they are great JAVA cube which are provided by Mr. <br>
Randelshofer. <br>
<br>
http://www.randelshofer.ch/<br>
<br>
#3<br>
Use parameter.html (included in the holder of Players), you can <br>
generate HTML code to show algorithm on JAVA cube. <br>
(You can easily translate the code. We used excel macro. )<br>
<br>
#4<br>
Scramble helper clicks computer mouse, scrambler mimic the movement <br>
on computer. <br>
It was better to put cube on the desk to scramble. <br>
If you grab it, you may drop. <br>
<br>
They can check the cube status every single movement. <br>
Although 5x5x5 and 4x4x4 were the first even during the competition, <br>
they failed only once to finish designated scramble. <br>
(There are no one to solve 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 among scramblers!) <br>
<br>
I strongly recommed to use this system for competiton, but some PU <br>
power is needed for smooth movement of JAVA cube. <br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s a capacitance thing.  When there&#x27;s a one-handed competitor, we&#x27;ll

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

Sorry to be a pain, but I just want to get this cleared up.

So does the scramble generator pick among the following possible moves?
:

L l r R F f b B U u d D (Ll) (Rr) (Ff) (Bb) (Uu) (Dd)

So what if it generates (Rr) R&#x27; r&#x27; = nothing, or (Rr) (Ll) = (Rr)2 x&#x27;,
or (Rr) r2 = r&#x27; R, or (Rr) l D2 = L l2 B2 x

Are all of these problem scenarios being accounted for in the scramble
generators?

Also what happens if the program generates:
(Rr) D F2 r R F R2

How is each (Rr) to be counted?  Clearly the move (Rr) was one move
and was generated as a new double turn.  But does the r R count as one
move too?  It is the same effect as (Rr).

If these moves are not both counted at one move, then that would be
using a double standard for counting moves.  If there are both
considered one move, then the scramble program has to account for that
and add an extra move (or double move) at the end.

This sounds really problematic to switch to scrabling this way and I
am not in favor of it.

If all the problems can be worked out then I will be quiet, but so far
I am not satisfied.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Chris, please don&#x27;t think this is aimed at you it is not.  But I&#x27;m
using your post as an example.

If the scrambling programs draws from L R F B D U (Ll) (Rr) (Ff) (Bb)
(Dd) (Uu) then what happens if it scrambles with

(Ll) L&#x27;.  Clearly this is two moves by our new standard, but I would
be very hard pressed to accept the turn (l) as a two move turn to our
scramble.

Also (Rr)2 R2 = r2 would be a problem.

(Rr) R would be r R2 which I would agree is two moves.

what about (Rr) (Ll) = (Rr)2 and a cube rotation.  I would be hard
pressed to call (Rr)2 two turns as well.  But it can be done with this
new scrambling technique.

Please don&#x27;t think I am lazy, I have actually asked Dave Jones if I
can scramble for the 5x5 event in Orlando and I would much rather
allow single inner slice turns than using these double turns.

Double turns like this make me very nervous, as we haven&#x27;t seen any
proof that they are as efficient as regular scrambling.

I would much rather not allow this new double turn scrambling and just
scramble the regular way.  Is there a forum for this on the WCA site
or should we leave dicussion for this topic here?

In short I do not agree with using double turn scrambling like this. 
Can someone please propose, in depth, what exactly the scramble
generators will do, and how the resulting problems will be resolved?

Sorry to be a pain, but I really do not agree with this, and it does
not stem from my laziness.  If Dave will let me I would be more than
willing to help scramble for the 5x5x5 event and use the regular
scrambing system and not these new double turns.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah but this new scrambling system can generate a two move effect:

(Rr) R&#x27; which is exactly equivalent to r by itself.

So if I do (r) on my cube I&#x27;ve now done two moves right?  By this new
standard yes.

Now what happens if that same sort of cancellation happens 3-4 times
in one scrambling alg?  Or say I get two cancellations of that type
and one of the double turn type (Ff) (Bb) = (Ff)2 and a rotation.

So you can, by cancellations, make a 40 move scrambling alg that in
actuality only scrambles the cube say 35 moves.

I don&#x27;t think that is acceptable.  And yes these problems can be
corrected if the scrambling program is smart enough to overcome that.
 But all we heard was (paraphrased) &quot;there is a new scrambling system
that we are implementing + some minor details&quot;

I would just like to hear the rest of the details, as I don&#x27;t accept
the new system just based on what I&#x27;ve heard so far.

          <div class="email-content">&gt;Scrambling 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 is quite hard, especially for novice <br>
&gt;scramblers with the inner slice moves (lrfbud).<br>
<br>
I agree with Rr turn is much easier than r. <br>
<br>
But I don&#x27;t think this is the main problem of scrambling big cubes. <br>
<br>
We had made a lot of mistakes in Kyoto contest although scramblers were <br>
experienced speedcubers. <br>
<br>
As I posted previously, main problem is there were no way to confirm <br>
until scrambler finishs 40 or 60 moves. <br>
This is quite long. <br>
<br>
For 3x3x3, a lot of people can solve it in 30 sec, so the competition <br>
shouldn&#x27;t delay but for big cubes there are not many people who can <br>
solve fast and don&#x27;t compete. One mistake makes huge delay. <br>
If the scrambled condition is not confirmed as same for everybody, I <br>
doubt the fairness of competition. <br>
<br>
I strongly recommend to use of JAVA cube and check every step. <br>
In this way, even novice scramblers can complete their job. <br>
I also like it. <br>
<br>
How the organizer are going to check the status of cubes at world <br>
championship? <br>
In national competitions, everyone must use same color scheme. <br>
But in world championship, there will be a lot of variations. <br>
It is difficult to gualantee the same randomized situation. <br>
It is also dificult to fix the misrandomized cube in different color <br>
scheme especially 4x4 because it doesn&#x27;t have fixed center. <br>
<br>
If we use JAVA cube, we can easily change the color scheme for each <br>
competitor and also for each scrambler. <br>
And probably we will not need to argue single slice move or double <br>
slice move. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
I already do this anyway when scrambling a 4x4 or 5x5, but perhpaps we<br>
can write a scrambling program that does this automatically, making<br>
scrambling easier for novice scramblers.<br>
<br>
Here is a 4x4 scrambling alg and how I execute it.<br>
<br>
Alg:<br>
D2 d R&#x27; d&#x27; B D2 R&#x27; D f2 U&#x27; L b2 u2 d&#x27; R u B R&#x27; F2 d l d2 L2 R&#x27; d2 D&#x27;<br>
l&#x27; U&#x27; l d2 b B U2 D B2 d2 r&#x27; F l&#x27; D2<br>
<br>
How I execute it:<br>
(Dd) D R&#x27; (Dd)&#x27; D B D2 R&#x27; D (Ff)2 F2 U&#x27; L (Bb)2 B2 (Uu)2 U2 (Dd)&#x27; D R<br>
(Uu) U&#x27; B R&#x27; F2 (Dd) D&#x27; (Ll) L&#x27; (Dd)2 D2 L2 R&#x27; (Dd)2 D (Ll)&#x27; L U&#x27; (Ll)<br>
L&#x27; (Dd)2 D2 (Bb) U2 D B2 (Dd)2 D2 (Rr)&#x27; R F (Ll)&#x27; L D2<br>
<br>
These algs are the same, but again the below one is in the notation<br>
for the new standard.<br>
<br>
In the new notation it is 57 moves, which is longer but by the<br>
arguments of those in favor of the new system a scrambler that outputs<br>
a regular scramble in this new notation is easy to read, as it uses<br>
the notation being proposed as easy to read.<br>
<br>
Maybe we could just have scrambling programs output the scrambles in<br>
this notation, so that novice scrambles would know the more efficient<br>
way to scramble these cases.<br>
<br>
Also I agree with Masayuki that pictures during the scrambling process<br>
may help to catch mistakes, since that would take a lot longer to<br>
solve on a larger cube, particularly since most of the fast solvers<br>
will be on stage competing.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron!

The maximum depth is not really the issue. What is more interesting 
is to see a comparison of a collection of random scrambles for 
various scramble lengths vs optimum lenght of solve. Sadly this is 
not possible to do with the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. Has anyone done it for 
3x3x3 yet? Or is the 25 also a random number? I know about the 
discussion on gods algorithm and that maybe 20 is the 3x3x3 cube 
diameter.

Im not really troubled by the new way to scramble using double outer 
layer turns. I&#x27;m very confident that 40/60 moves is far more than 
necessary and if the real scramble length should turn out to be a 
few moves shorter for some scrambles it won&#x27;t be a problem. 

I still like to see the analysis that has been done. And i think 
Chris (Hardwick) and me still would be relieved if the scrambling 
program was made quite clever wrt move avoiding cancellations for 
this new way of doing it :-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi folks,<br>
<br>
Out of curiousity I looked at the new timer at<br>
rubiks.com .<br>
<br>
It looks interesting, dimensions 30 x 25 x 6 cm <br>
(approximately a foot wide) with a LCD display.<br>
<br>
First of all let me say that the original timers<br>
at WC2003 and U.S. Cube-a-thons used a timer that<br>
had used a similar system to the rubiks.com timer. <br>
In Canada at the regional contests the judges used analog <br>
stopwatches and had a photo sensor timer at the <br>
finals. So this type was used at many contest <br>
locations before.<br>
<br>
At WC2003 with the Stackmat I saw some contestants dropping <br>
the cube and slapping down their hands and sometimes the <br>
cube ended up on the floor. Probably the times are slightly <br>
slower with the Stackmat timer. But since the times have<br>
improved so much since 1982 it hardly matters.<br>
<br>
I think that either timer can be used. One thing<br>
for sure the 7 segment LED display was easy to see<br>
and record on film. If the sponsors want to use a<br>
particular timer then I suppose that is the timer<br>
that will be used. Personally I prefer the<br>
photo-sensor timer since you don&#x27;t have to lay your<br>
hands down at the end but I could live with either <br>
type. <br>
<br>
When I&#x27;m timing myself with a stopwatch I have to <br>
hit a button to start the timer so the idea of some<br>
device that automatically starts the timer when you<br>
pick it up is appealing. I&#x27;m sure inexpensive <br>
do-it-yourself timing kits will appear eventually.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The two metrics are still equivalent.  In the current metric, a
scramble can generate R r, which currently counts as two moves, but
would only count as one in the new metric.  This is equivalent to a
new version scramble containing R r&#x27;.  It would only count as r&#x27; in
the present metric.  Your issue that it is possible to have a 40 move
scramble that cancels 5 moves is valid, but it&#x27;s the same system we
use now.  If we use the other metric, my scramble I just generated has
two cancellations like I mentioned above.  It&#x27;s even possible to get
(l&#x27;r) in scrambles now, which are really just an M.  Two turns make
one just as easily now.  I really don&#x27;t understand what you think is
so different with the second metric.

Even so, if it becomes apparent there is a problem, I&#x27;m sure it
wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to alter the code so that the problem cases
wouldn&#x27;t be able to appear next to eachother, such as f2b2, Rr&#x27;, and
the like.

Since I&#x27;m always participating in almost all events I&#x27;m seldomly 
scrambling so I don&#x27;t know how much scrambles are really checked.

Personally I think the cubes don&#x27;t need to be scrambled the same way 
as long as they&#x27;re all well-scrambled. This also means that I think as 
long as you generally follow the scramble algorithm it&#x27;s ok to make a 
few mistakes... the only valid excuses I see to request same scrambles 
is less paper if they&#x27;re printed, and that outsiders might not 
understand same scrambles aren&#x27;t necessary.

> Stefan, I want to hear from you, the master of Revenger and Profesor

Please don&#x27;t call me master just because I use somebody elses great 
applet ;-)

Not sure about myself. I think I&#x27;d be slowed down using the applet, 
but I haven&#x27;t tried it. Like many of us I&#x27;m also quite used to 
reading/executing scrambles so I don&#x27;t think I can estimate well what 
troubles beginners might have. I think if the equipment can be 
provided it might be a good idea to use the applets. Oh, do you let 
the full scramble run automatically or turn by turn with one click for 
each?

I know something else has slowed me down: treating lower case letters 
of ordinary scrambles as double-layer turns. I got confused all the 
time and it took longer than doing them as inner layer turns (which 
take less actual turning action). But it could be just the syntax. 
Printing double layer turns as (Rr) etc might change it.

How many of them had known the stackmat beforehand? I think this has 
changed by now.

Have you tried the stackmat, too?

Yeah, stopwatches do suck. Sometimes I lose 2-3 seconds (!) because 
I&#x27;m too stupid to correctly push the button after the solve. This is 
no problem with the stackmat. I only still use a stopwatch because I 
don&#x27;t take my stackmat with me all the time, and sometimes at home 
because I&#x27;m a lazy bastard who can&#x27;t keep the table/bed/floor tidied 
up enough to put the stackmat there ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Tyson is right. Just think about this. When you reach the LL, you could have 
any of the possible LL positions (provided that you didn&#x27;t do anything 
during the F2L to change the LL).

Ignore the fact that pieces aren&#x27;t oriented correctly. When you do an OLL, 
any OLL, the most it will do is swap some pieces or rotate some pieces 
around the LL. Since you didn&#x27;t pay attention to the permutation before you 
did the OLL, those swaps and rotations won&#x27;t get it closer to any certain 
PLL. It will just &#x27;mix&#x27; up the permutation some more.

I don&#x27;t think that came out right at all, but it made sense in my head. 
Anyway the point is, OLL obvious effects the PLL but there is no relation 
between a certain OLL and PLL.

I think 25 for 3x3x3 was chosen because:
= it is a nice number :-)
= it is more than the expected maximum depth of 21
= it was used for the WC 1982

We could also use a program that puts the pieces in randomly and then generate a CubeExplorer solution.
There is nothing like that for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5.

One day we will know... :-)

Have fun,

Ron

  Hi Ron!

  The maximum depth is not really the issue. What is more interesting 
  is to see a comparison of a collection of random scrambles for 
  various scramble lengths vs optimum lenght of solve. Sadly this is 
  not possible to do with the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. Has anyone done it for 
  3x3x3 yet? Or is the 25 also a random number? I know about the 
  discussion on gods algorithm and that maybe 20 is the 3x3x3 cube 
  diameter.

  Im not really troubled by the new way to scramble using double outer 
  layer turns. I&#x27;m very confident that 40/60 moves is far more than 
  necessary and if the real scramble length should turn out to be a 
  few moves shorter for some scrambles it won&#x27;t be a problem. 

  I still like to see the analysis that has been done. And i think 
  Chris (Hardwick) and me still would be relieved if the scrambling 
  program was made quite clever wrt move avoiding cancellations for 
  this new way of doing it :-)

  Cheers!

Are you talking to your other Chris? :-)

Please test the scrambler. It answers all your questions.
Or check out the code of the scrambler in the page source.

This weekend we will use the old scrambling system. So we have time to think.

Have fun,

Ron

  Yeah but this new scrambling system can generate a two move effect:

  (Rr) R&#x27; which is exactly equivalent to r by itself.

  So if I do (r) on my cube I&#x27;ve now done two moves right?  By this new
  standard yes.

  Now what happens if that same sort of cancellation happens 3-4 times
  in one scrambling alg?  Or say I get two cancellations of that type
  and one of the double turn type (Ff) (Bb) = (Ff)2 and a rotation.

  So you can, by cancellations, make a 40 move scrambling alg that in
  actuality only scrambles the cube say 35 moves.

  I don&#x27;t think that is acceptable.  And yes these problems can be
  corrected if the scrambling program is smart enough to overcome that.
  But all we heard was (paraphrased) &quot;there is a new scrambling system
  that we are implementing + some minor details&quot;

  I would just like to hear the rest of the details, as I don&#x27;t accept
  the new system just based on what I&#x27;ve heard so far.

&gt;&gt; Scrambling 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 is quite hard, especially for novice<br>
&gt;&gt; scramblers with the inner slice moves (lrfbud).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I agree with Rr turn is much easier than r.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But I don&#x27;t think this is the main problem of scrambling big cubes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We had made a lot of mistakes in Kyoto contest although scramblers were<br>
&gt; experienced speedcubers.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As I posted previously, main problem is there were no way to confirm<br>
&gt; until scrambler finishs 40 or 60 moves.<br>
&gt; This is quite long.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For 3x3x3, a lot of people can solve it in 30 sec, so the competition<br>
&gt; shouldn&#x27;t delay but for big cubes there are not many people who can<br>
&gt; solve fast and don&#x27;t compete. One mistake makes huge delay.<br>
&gt; If the scrambled condition is not confirmed as same for everybody, I<br>
&gt; doubt the fairness of competition.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I strongly recommend to use of JAVA cube and check every step.<br>
&gt; In this way, even novice scramblers can complete their job.<br>
&gt; I also like it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; How the organizer are going to check the status of cubes at world<br>
&gt; championship?<br>
&gt; In national competitions, everyone must use same color scheme.<br>
&gt; But in world championship, there will be a lot of variations.<br>
&gt; It is difficult to gualantee the same randomized situation.<br>
&gt; It is also dificult to fix the misrandomized cube in different color<br>
&gt; scheme especially 4x4 because it doesn&#x27;t have fixed center.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If we use JAVA cube, we can easily change the color scheme for each<br>
&gt; competitor and also for each scrambler.<br>
&gt; And probably we will not need to argue single slice move or double<br>
&gt; slice move.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I actually saw more results from eating healthier. I noticed that when
I stopped eating partially hydrogenated oils, my averaged dropped from
19 seconds to 17! It was amazing. I felt better, I thought better, and
i cubed better. However, cubing does have a physical aspect to it, so
in order to maintain high finger dexterity, I powerball for up to 2
and a half hours aday at 30-60 minute intervals (powerballs.com). This
rigorous excercise not only makes my fingers stronger, but also my
forearm. I work out every other day to improve the upper body aspects
of cubing, including biceps ( for picking up and holding the cube) and
abs, to maintain a proper posture. I know macky works out at Golds for
15-18 hours a week. What about the rest of you cubers out there?

          <div class="email-content">Very impressive Tyson :)

I workout 6 times a week and eat 4 meals a day. I basically lift for mass so 
I can get the ladies. My six workouts are as follows:

1. Weight Lifting - Biceps and Back
2. Weight Lifting - Chest and Triceps
3. Jumprope for 60 minutes + abdominals for 20
4. Weight Lifting - Shoulders
5. Weight Lifting - Legs
6. Jumprope for 60 minutes + abdominals for 20

I find that it&#x27;s especially fun to solve the cube after a good biceps

          <div class="email-content">For all practical purposes, yeah.  Theoretically, it&#x27;s possible to 
influence the PLL.  There are several algorithms for each OLL.  Once 
in a good long while, you MIGHT be able to identify certain color 
patterns for which there is a difference among the algorithms.

An example would be the &#x27;H&#x27; OLL where all the corners are OK but 2 
opposite edges are flipped.  The Fridrich algorithm will rotate 3 of 
the edges; the well known &#x27;Cubist&#x27; maneuver will leave them alone.  
If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have all corners in place, and the edges 
are in just the right positions, you can instantly determine which of 
the two will solve the cube without going to PLL.

This is a poor example, because the Fridrich algorithm plus the 3-
edge swap might actually take less time to execute than the cubist 
move!  But I&#x27;m sure there are others.  Again, it would be VERY rare 
that you could do this, perhaps less rare if you are used to ZB and 
extreme stuff like that.

          <div class="email-content">Let me just weigh in here a little.<br>
<br>
Ideally, scrambles are long enough that every possible position has a <br>
nearly equal probability of occurring. There is no way to be totally <br>
sure of how long this should be, even on a 3x3x3. All we can do is <br>
take rough guesstimates.<br>
<br>
Here is a simplified outline for the 3x3x3 cube.<br>
The first move of the scramble sequence can be any one of 18 moves. <br>
For the second and each subsequent move, there are 15 choices (we <br>
ignore LR=RL for now). This means that there are 18*15^(n-1) <br>
scrambles of length n. Of course we want this number to exceed the <br>
total number of positions (43*10^18), so n must be greater than 17.5.<br>
<br>
Clearly this is an underestimate, because there are many scramble <br>
sequences for each position. For the 3x3x3 we use 25 moves, for the <br>
reasons Ron has stated. I think that this number is still a bit low, <br>
since I believe that the diameter (i.e. longest optimal solution <br>
length) is more likely to be 22-23 than 20. Therefore not all <br>
positions will be nearly equally likely, but in practice that doesn&#x27;t <br>
matter - it will be scrambled enough that there is no shortcut to <br>
solving it.<br>
<br>
In the above, we ignored that LR=RL etc. If you take this into <br>
account, the results are not much different. You get much better <br>
estimates for the number of positions a few moves away from start, <br>
but the growth rate is so similar that the scramble length estimates <br>
are hardly changed (only 1 or 2 moves longer).<br>
<br>
Here is a table for all currently available cube sizes:<br>
<br>
2x2x2 : 3.7*10^6  :  9* 6^(n-1) : 8.2   : 11 : 25<br>
3x3x3 : 4.3*10^19 : 18*15^(n-1) : 17.5  : 23?: 25<br>
4x4x4 : 7.4*10^45 : 27*24^(n-1) : 33.2  : ?? : 40<br>
5x5x5 : 2.8*10^74 : 36*33^(n-1) : 49.0  : ?? : 60<br>
<br>
It shows<br>
- the cube size<br>
- the number of positions<br>
- the approximate number of scrambles of length n<br>
- the length n for which #scrambles&gt;#positions<br>
- God&#x27;s Algorithm length<br>
- competition scramble length<br>
<br>
Clearly the 2x2x2 competition scramble length is a bit excessive (but <br>
easy enough to do in practice), but others seem reasonable. For <br>
practical reasons there is a smaller safety margin for the higher <br>
cubes (else we&#x27;d use about 50 and 70 moves) but it is long enough <br>
that there are not likely to be many blocks of pieces left together <br>
at the end of the scramble.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the matter at hand. Would such estimates differ if we <br>
use multi-slice moves instead?  I think not. We still have the same <br>
number of moves to choose from at each step in the scramble, and <br>
there is still the same number of commutivity relations (such as <br>
RL=LR or rR=Rr). <br>
<br>
I find it interesting to speculate on whether you can use this to <br>
estimate the God&#x27;s Algorithm lengths for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. I would say <br>
they are possibly about 45 and 65 moves.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt;Don&#x27;t you just &#x27;translate&#x27; the colors in your head if you have a <br>
cube <br>
&gt;with a different color scheme?  Imagine how thrilled I was every <br>
time I <br>
&gt;had to scramble Doug Li&#x27;s cube.<br>
Hi Tyson, <br>
<br>
Just for scrambling, it may not be so difficult. <br>
If you made mistake during scramble, you have to solve the cube in <br>
different color scheme once then scramble again from the beginning. <br>
<br>
I would suggest we need to establish a solid system that scramblers <br>
will not get thrilled. <br>
<br>
I partly agree with one mistake may not affect solving time. <br>
But who knows? It may affect. <br>
The solution can be a new world record. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi Ron, Chris, and Jaaps,<br>
<br>
If the inner slice move is too difficult for novice scrambler, using <br>
double slice must be the way to go. <br>
<br>
I agree with Chris that reformatting the regular algorithms into the <br>
format avoiding from inner slice moves is better than just producing <br>
new double slice algorithms. <br>
<br>
This is my answer. <br>
It is a sad nature of stupid macro programmer. <br>
You can find a excel sheet in file section of this group. <br>
<br>
The algorithm in A2 cell is the algorithm which Chris (cmhardw) <br>
posted. <br>
Push buttom you will get the algorithms which is completely as same <br>
as Chris reformatted. <br>
<br>
This also produces the algorithms for Randelshofer&#x27;s JAVA cube. <br>
I haven&#x27;t tested on JAVA cube yet. <br>
But it should work theoretically. <br>
Now we don&#x27;t need new randomization program. <br>
<br>
If you find bugs, I will fix. <br>
<br>
I hope this will make everyone happy. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Well the problem here seems to be that putting the cube on the pad is
stopping the timer and in stactmat the timer stops when the hands are
placed on the pads. So instead of putting the cube on its pad why not
put one hand on the pad instead? Then the time will start when the
hand is taken up and will stop when we put our hands back on the pad,
I think this will also solve the problems with other puzzles when the
puzzle dosent leave the table.

So we are then using it like a stackmat only but instead of pads we
now have electronic detection which will be much more accurate.

Dosent anyone see it better than the stackmat if used like this?

          <div class="email-content">All right, let&#x27;s go over this again.  Please identify the improvements  <br>
the new timer provides over the StackMat in a competition setting.   <br>
Improvements with the ability to keep track of averages and scrambles  <br>
and statistics is not relevant to a competition.  Furthermore, just  <br>
download JNetCube.<br>
<br>
As for stopping the photocell with one hand, what about the other hand?  <br>
  Person makes the last turn of the cube with their left hand and they  <br>
stop the photocell with their right hand.  Okay, so you say they have  <br>
to stop turning the cube before they stop the timer.  What about a  <br>
close call?  There is no defined boundary.  You can turn the cube after  <br>
the timer has been stopped.<br>
<br>
What about telling people to stop the timer with the same hand the make  <br>
the last move?  Try this yourself and see how happy you are when your  <br>
last move is a U&#x27; done with the left index finger.  Your right hand is  <br>
already free, so why can&#x27;t it go and stop the timer?  Because it&#x27;s the  <br>
rule, and so you have to make the exchange or drop the cube, and stop  <br>
the timer with your left hand.<br>
<br>
If you want to pay $50 for those extra features, go ahead, but they are  <br>
not relevant to a competition setting.  If you are complaining about  <br>
forcing people to buy StackMats so that they can practice, then you are  <br>
misguided because the new timer is a lot more and it&#x27;s better we  <br>
&#x27;force&#x27; people to buy a StackMat which is half the cost than to force  <br>
people to buy a new timer but with this all being said, you can  <br>
practice the methods of the StackMat without the StackMat.<br>
<br>
As nice as it would be, I don&#x27;t have a 400 meter rubber track in my  <br>
backyard.  No, I practice running my 3 minute 55 second 1500 meters on  <br>
the grass field.<br>
<br>
So please elucidate the $50&#x27;s worth of improvement this timer provides.<br>

Jaap,

Have the (pairwise) correlations between pieces (of the same and 
different types) been checked for a few million random scrambles?  Even 
though I suspect that shorter scrambles would eliminate these anyway, 
it would be reassuring if we could be certain that standard scrambles 
are adequate.  It would be very easy to verify.

Sachin.


P.S. Still if anyone wants to use this timer as a stackmat then buy
two of these for both of the hands and then connect them in some way.
Looks like a nice idea for a contraption :)

  The duty of a timer in competition is to compare the abilities of 
  competitors.

  There&#x27;s just no way to &quot;exactly&quot; measure the solve time or even just 
  define how to measure it, see Tyson&#x27;s comments about video analysis.

  > Having to hit one pad in my opinion is faster the having to hit two.

  I doubt I&#x27;d smash my puzzles onto that new timer even nearly as fast 
  as I smash my hands onto the stackmat. I&#x27;d fear to damage both the 
  puzzle and that new timer. Btw, I don&#x27;t know about you, but I have two 
  hands. And I can move them at simultaneously. Amazing, huh?

      >No need to get insulting here. just stating that stopping a timer with one hand then having to do it with two.
  in a stack may if you do not stop them at the same time it does not stop. with the new timer you only have to 
  place the puzzle on the pad to stop the time. Does this not seem faster to you?



  But yes, if possible I will also try out that new timer at WC2005, 
  though I can already tell you I&#x27;ll do it just for fun because I don&#x27;t 
  agree with the principle it&#x27;s based on.

      > what principle?

  Yes, it is convenient, but in my opinion, not worth the extra $50. 
  For $50, I would rather insert the times onto my PC manually.  Also,
  did you see there is a $50 accessory package?  If you want to load
  times from your timer to a speadsheet on your PC, it is an ADDITIONAL
  $50.  $100 to have my times saved is not worth it.

  The problem with &quot;giving it a try&quot; is that I finish my solve on the
  table.  The puzzle would not be solved when I put it on the timer
  because I would be mid-solution.  For the master magic, for example,
  almost the entire solution is on the mat.  If it was required to do
  the entire puzzle in the air, times would be ridiculously slow.

  I know &quot;the stack mat already does this&quot;

No. I have done some simple back of the envelope calculations ages 
ago. This also helped to determine that 40 and 60 moves was necessary.

The 4x4x4 has 9 cuts inbetween the layers. There are 12 pairs of 
pieces bordering each cut. All together there are therefore 108 
adjacent piece pairs, and each (multi-slice) move disturbs 12 of them 
and leaves 96 undisturbed.

To estimate roughly how many moves are needed for all pairs to be 
disturbed, we want 108*(96/108)^n, which is the estimated number of 
undisturbed pairs, to be &lt;1. This gives n>39.75.

Similarly for the 5x5x5 cube we get 192* (176/192)^n &lt; 1, leading to 
a length of 60.42.

It&#x27;s an interesting estimate, especially in the light of the lower 
bounds on the lengths of God&#x27;s algorithm.  But it&#x27;s not completely 
clear that one can argue this way, since: (1) a given piece belongs to 
more than one pair simultaneously, (2) 12 nearby &quot;pairs&quot; are broken 
simultaneously by a turn and (3) there are short sequences, like URU&#x27;, 
that will first break and then re-connect some of these &quot;pairs&quot;; so it 
is not then obvious that the correlations are destroyed as fast as one 
would like.

That aside (and I don&#x27;t seriously doubt that 25-,40-,60-turn scrambles 
*are* plenty long enough), it would still be nice to have empirical 
results to back up the estimates.  I&#x27;ll look at the pair correlations 
myself sometime soon... unless someone else feels the urge to rush off 
and try it right now ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jaap!

Is ur scrambler clever enough to avoid say (Rr)(Ll) on the 4x4x4 
cube? If not i think it should be made that clever. This can be done 
by grouping legal moves according to axes of rotation :-) And some 
simple rules.

I don&#x27;t think (1) is a problem. I imagine the cube as being covered <br>
in sellotape, and before each move you have to cut any bits of tape <br>
blocking the move. Cutting the tape along one side has no influence <br>
on the other sides.<br>
I don&#x27;t understand your point in (2).<br>
I admit (3) is true, but I don&#x27;t think it matters much, just like the <br>
LR=RL relations in the other estimates.<br>
<br>
Another assumption used in deriving the simple formula is that each <br>
move destroys a certain fixed percentage of the pairings, as if the <br>
unbroken pairings are distributed evenly over the cube at all times. <br>
This is certainly not the case in the first few moves, which usually <br>
break a higher percentage of those pairings. This might compensate <br>
for the effect of (3) a little.<br>
<br>
This kind of thing is just so riddled with simplifications and <br>
assumptions, but it is good enough for getting ballpark figures.<br>
<br>
For single-slice moves this method doesn&#x27;t work as well. Whereas <br>
multi-slice moves tend to keep blocks of pieces together for a while, <br>
single-slice moves tend to keep non-adjacent pieces in the same <br>
relative positions.<br>
<br>
&gt; it would still be nice to have empirical <br>
&gt; results to back up the estimates.  I&#x27;ll look at the pair<br>
&gt; correlations myself sometime soon...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to see some real stats too, but I&#x27;m not interested enough to <br>
actually do it myself.<br>

Yes it is. In multi-slice mode it is very easy to check for this, since 
that is the only case that simplifies to fewer moves plus a cube 
rotation.
Standard single-slice mode is trickier (e.g. R r L&#x27; = l&#x27; Rc), and I&#x27;m 
sure you remember it being discussed here some time ago. There used to 
be a bug in my scrambler that made it fail to detect this in certain 
cases, but I fixed that a few months ago.

   That is awesome that you were able to pull together
10 people.  We are hold a competition here this
weekend and we thought that the 10 competitor rule was
going to be an issue but lucky for us people are
willing to travel (Chris, Mike and a few others).
  When I looked at the 3x3 results I just failed to
realize that your 3x3 BLD was not on the list (which
made 10 - sorry, I wasn&#x27;t meaning to bring doubt into
community).  Besides it is awesome when you can get it
official that way the people who do sacrifice the time
to practice and travel can be ranked and hopefully
inspired to do better the next time.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jaap,

A few questions about the new scramble program.

I guess this one is more general, I perfectly accept that by the new
scrambling procedure all the inner slice moves r,l,f,b,u,d are now 2
moves long (Rr) R&#x27;, (Ll) L&#x27;, (Ff) F&#x27;, (Bb) B&#x27;, (Uu) U&#x27;, (Dd) D&#x27;

So how does this affect the 4x4x4 scrambling?  That was my main
concern.  If 39.75 moves is enough to break up most piece pairs, what
happens if 2 of those moves are now one single inner slice turn?  Are
40 turns still enough?

I guess my main question is does your scrambler allow single inner
slice turns (which are now two moves long)?

Lastly can it allow the legal way of turning three parallel layers?

R r2 l = (Rr)2 R&#x27; (Ll) L&#x27;  ?

And others?

Thanks for your time and posts about some of the analysis of the new
scrambling system.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">If people are hell bent on scrambling the cubes in another way here is<br>
another proposal.<br>
<br>
Why not use more, if not solely, three parallel layer turns?<br>
<br>
If I am away from my computer and unable to print out a scramble for<br>
my 4x4x4 I always scramble almost solely with three parallel layer turns.<br>
<br>
This leaves the cube better messed up than if I just try to estimate a<br>
equal number of inner slice to outer slice turns.<br>
<br>
These can be done like so<br>
<br>
U (Uu) (Uud&#x27;) = U&#x27; u2 d&#x27;<br>
<br>
(U u d&#x27;) (Uu)2 U&#x27; = d&#x27; u&#x27; U2<br>
<br>
(U u d&#x27;)2 (Uu)&#x27; U2 = d2 u U&#x27;<br>
<br>
invert the signs to turn slices another way.  Also you can see that<br>
these are all the possibilities for turning either an outer layer or<br>
an inner layer as the double turn.<br>
<br>
I imagine reading triple layer turns (if we had the right notation)<br>
would not be that hard.  Also if people were trained to realize the<br>
turns would always be (some triple, some double, and some single)<br>
together, then it woudl switch to another triplet of<br>
(triple,double,single) then they see more of a pattern than random turns.<br>
<br>
Try scrambling this way and see what you think.  It is not that time<br>
consuming, and it messes up the cube very quickly.<br>
<br>
Also each parallel turn is 3 moves (HTM) so you could do it 13 times<br>
and then add an extra move at the end.  In terms of execution you have<br>
done 40 moves every time, triple layer turns and double turns counting<br>
as 1 &quot;competition scrambler turn&quot;.<br>

          <div class="email-content">This can extend to the 5x5x5 a bit as well if you count M,E,S as slices.<br>
<br>
The only rule is that still only 3 parallel turns are possible, and as<br>
seen from the turn axis one face must turn clockwise, one<br>
counterclockwise, and one double.<br>
<br>
So among 5 slices on the L-R plane (L,l,M,r,R) you can choose three<br>
(10 ways to do that) and among those three slices you can choose which<br>
faces turn which way (6 ways to do that)<br>
<br>
So among each axis there are 60 possible three parallel layer turns,<br>
and if you change axes frequently then you should still get a very<br>
scrambled cube in 60 turns.<br>

The scrambles may include quadruple layer turns for the 5x5x5, but it<br>
would still come out to 60 &quot;competition scrambler moves&quot; if you were<br>
clever with the scrambling program.<br>

As long as the rule doesn&#x27;t memtion about mistake during scramle, it is <br>

If we allow one mistake during scramble, we can&#x27;t verify there was one <br>

Then, we don&#x27;t need to follow computer based algorithm anymore. <br>

&gt; A few questions about the new scramble program.<br>
<br>
Well, it is just the same old program with an extra option added.<br>
<br>
&gt; So how does this affect the 4x4x4 scrambling?  That was my main<br>
&gt; concern.  If 39.75 moves is enough to break up most piece pairs,<br>
&gt; what happens if 2 of those moves are now one single inner slice<br>
&gt; turn?  Are 40 turns still enough?<br>
<br>
To all intents and purposes a single-slice move and a multi-slice <br>
move have the same mixing power. The first breaks up more adjacent <br>
pairs of pieces, while the second breaks up more non-adjacent pairs. <br>
<br>
For very short mixing sequences you will see that the multi-slice <br>
mixes have more blocks, while the single-slice mixes have more non-<br>
adjacent pairs that haven&#x27;t moved relative to each other. The number  <br>
of facelets of each colour on each face is about the same after the <br>
same number of moves.<br>
<br>
&gt; I guess my main question is does your scrambler allow single inner<br>
&gt; slice turns (which are now two moves long)?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
&gt; Lastly can it allow the legal way of turning three parallel layers?<br>
<br>
For consistency I&#x27;ll write the moves below in single-slice notation <br>
(i.e. r means just one slice in the text below, even though in multi-<br>
slice mode the scrambler uses that to denote the movement of two <br>
slices).<br>
<br>
It allows R,(Rr),(Ll),L as the basic moves on the r-l axis. However, <br>
it does not allow both (Rr) and (Ll) to be used in a combination, <br>
because two such moves would simplify to a cube rotation and a single <br>
move (or even to just a cube rotation).<br>
<br>
So we allow for example<br>
 R (Rr)&#x27; L&#x27;<br>
<br>
but not<br>
 (Rr) (Ll)2 L<br>
<br>
Think of each move not as having an effect on a set of layers, but as <br>
acting on one of the 3 cutting planes along that axis. A move <br>
indicates how much the part to one side of the plane has moved <br>
relative to the other side. Thought of this way it becomes clear that <br>
any combination of these moves along an axis will not be simplified <br>
to fewer moves by using a cube rotation, except for the fact that Rr <br>
and Ll apply to the same cutting plane.<br>
<br>
Note also that it will still use the same system for avoiding <br>
cancellations such as RLR = R2L by only doing the moves on an axis in <br>
one particular order. This is no different than the single-slice <br>
metric, in that for example only one of RL or LR is allowed (I forget <br>
which order I chose in my program).<br>

Just one point here is that &quot;pairs&quot; (or pieces of tape, if you like) 
are not objects that can be treated as if they are independent of one 
another.  E.g., if you break the pair URF-UR on the 3x3x3 you can be 
quite sure that you are *not* also breaking URF-UR.  

> I don&#x27;t understand your point in (2).

It simply led on to (3): because the pairs are all broken together, 
several of them can be joined up again 2 moves later.  None of this 
was well explained - I was just expressing discomfort, a little 
inarticulately.

the

Oh, I agree.  It would just be nice to be sure.

Yes, it&#x27;s very like Boltzmann&#x27;s Stosszahlansatz... and it might 
interact badly with (1).

I find it interesting enough... I&#x27;ll have a go at some point.

Hi Craig,

If I need to explain the first two levels I say that I look for ways
to move pieces about without disturbing the pieces I already have
placed. You might demonstrate 1.) placing a corner, 2.) placing an
edge next to it, and then 3.) pairing up a corner and edge and then
placing them.

Many people told me that they could solve the first two level, so I
only explained the last level.

For the last level I explain that there are two kinds of pieces:
corners and edges; and two kinds of problems to solve: position and
orientation. 

I explain that an algorithm is a sequence of moves which always does
the same thing, and I demonstrate, with 3 cycles, that repetition of
an algorithm returns the cube to the initial state. Solved cube ->
three cycle once -> three cycle twice -> three cycle three times =
solved cube.


The four three-cycles I use are (lower case letters are slices):

Corner position:
R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U
Corner orientation:
R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; U2
Edge position:
F2 U r U2 r&#x27; U F2 
Edge orientation:
r U r&#x27; U2 r U r&#x27;

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">When i teach someone, ive always tried to use my students as guinea
pigs for testing different methods. The first two guys i taught i
taught them the corner first method, and it was quite hard for them.
To the next guy i taught the lbl method with all algos(5-6 in total).
To the next guy i taught him commutators and he learnt it quite fast.
So i use commutators to teach ppl the last layer algos. Usually i
direct them to Gilles site http://grrroux.free.fr/begin/Begin.html

And yes abot the middle layer edges, i also teach them sort of the
away principle that was posted. Suppose the white red corner is to be
placed(white on top, red on the sides) . I first tell them to align
red to red. This is easy as only u have to do a U move. Then i tell
them to move it in a direction opposite to the white edge i.e. towards
the yellow center if green is at the top. Then apply the algo.

Usually ppl understand it after some tinkering.

Hope this helps :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
After about a year and a half of development, the Rubik&#x27;s timer is <br>
now available for sale at www.rubiks.com.  It is in the &quot;New <br>
Releases&quot; section of the online store.<br>
<br>
I read the posts and have received plenty of feedback of from people <br>
ranging from &quot;I am an arrogant asshole who knows nothing&quot; all the <br>
way to &quot;That is a truly remarkable product you designed I can&#x27;t wait <br>
to buy one.&quot;  Of course everyone has a right to their opinion.<br>
<br>
The official timing standard for speedcubing hasn&#x27;t changed, nor was <br>
this the reason why I built the timer.  The Rubik&#x27;s timer will not <br>
be permissible in competition for the forseeable future.  The <br>
stackmat remains the only accepted timer for competition.  If the <br>
speedcubing community eventually decides that the Rubik&#x27;s timer <br>
should be allowed in competition, then that is for the community to <br>
decide, not me.<br>
<br>
All I want to say about the Rubik&#x27;s timer is that I think it is a <br>
very useful training/practice tool, because it can be used <br>
comfortably in your lap, it can track your averages and store your <br>
times in a database, and it&#x27;s handy for generating scrambles.  If <br>
you are a top speedcuber and want to practice with the exact tool <br>
you will use in competition because every 1/100th second counts to <br>
you, then the Rubik&#x27;s timer is not for you.  If you want a timer to <br>
use on your couch that computes averages, times pre-inspection, <br>
maintains a database of times, generates scrambes, then I recommend <br>
the features of the Rubik&#x27;s timer. <br>
<br>
A lot of accusations have been thrown around by people who are <br>
guessing and assuming things about me and my company that aren&#x27;t <br>
true.  So I&#x27;d like to simply state my cubing background.  I have <br>
been speedcubing for 3 years now and I competed in the 2003 WC games <br>
and placed in the middle of the pack with a time of about 40 <br>
seconds.  Nowadays I average around 28 seconds and a good solve is <br>
around 20 seconds.  So I am not a top speedcuber and I tend to keep <br>
low profile, although I do keep a watch on the speedcubing scene.  I <br>
love to speedcube and wanted a timer that I could use in my lap on <br>
my living-room couch with some Rubiks-cube-specific-features in it.  <br>
I thought there might be other people like me too, so I offered the <br>
idea to SevenTowns and they accepted.  So I built the timer for 2 <br>
very basic reasons 1) because I can, and 2) because I wanted to.  I <br>
did not build the timer to try to overtake the speedcubing community <br>
standards.<br>
<br>
Opnions seem to vary wildly, more so than I would have guessed, and <br>
I respect everyone&#x27;s opinion.<br>

I assume that you&#x27;re cubing at the same time you&#x27;re doing all this, 
right?? :-) That would be *real* cross-training.

I do work out for fitness (bike, lift, stairs, soccer, volleyball, 
etc), but for my cubing, I find that the mental aspects are more 
important - calmness, paying attention, foresight, relaxation - they 
help me stay focused and avoid mistakes.  Of course, I&#x27;m a C/D-level 
cuber (average 45-50 seconds on the 3x3x3), so what works for me might 
not work for others.

<br>
I was thinking today that I should change method for 2*2*2. I plan to <br>
learn CLL so I can solve it in 2 steps. <br>
<br>
How much do you benefit on 3*3*3 using CLL? It seems to my that it <br>
takes more time to recognize a CLL-case than just the orientation of <br>
the corners. Do you save more time during PLL on average, than you <br>
loose during OLL, using CLL?<br>
<br>
If I don&#x27;t save some time on 3*3*3, I wil learn the shorter algs for <br>
2*2*2 that would effect the edges on the 3*3*3.<br>

   Need some advice with my cross. I&#x27;m using Fridrich 2-look. Getting very frustrated with my advancement of my cross. Can&#x27;t perform cross efficiently blindfolded.

1. performing cross in less than 7 moves <br>

I don&#x27;t get it. You guys make it sound like it&#x27;s a terrible thing if I 
make a mistake while scrambling. Your argument is that the mistake 
could lead to a world record and that this is bad.

Ok, let&#x27;s say the scramble is:
(30 moves) B (29 moves)
And instead of B I accidentally do B&#x27;. So what? It&#x27;s still an equally 
valid random scramble! The chances of making the scramble easier by 
this are just as high as the chances of making it harder.

This does *not* make the scramble any weaker or less valid.

Particularly I can&#x27;t understand how you can use the world record 
argument. I could understand if you argued about making it &quot;fair&quot; 
inside a single contest round (where it&#x27;s also not necessary) but for 
a world record?? Doesn&#x27;t make sense.

          <div class="email-content">Craig,

My best times are practically identical to yours for the 3x3x3! 
Fascinating.  Not really, but it was nice to see that I&#x27;m not the only
one on this group that hasn&#x27;t broken 30s yet.

Anyway, I have always thought that the Petrus method is the easiest
method to teach someone since it&#x27;s so visual.  Also, I think that the
Petrus method has the advantage that you can clearly define some
&quot;rules&quot; for what sides you are &quot;allowed&quot; to turn in the different
steps.  The only tricky part is the recognition of bad edges; most of
the people I have taught have had a hard time with that particular
step.  The Petrus method can really be distilled down to 2 algorithms
(Niklas and Sune) plus the 3-turns to flip a pair of edges.  It&#x27;s
helpful to learn the Allan too, but it&#x27;s not absolutely necessary.

As was mentioned, I think that corners first is a really difficult
method for new-comers because they aren&#x27;t familiar with looking at a
corner and figuring out whether it is in the right place or not, much
less finding three corners that form a cycle.  Friedrich can be okay
for new cubers, but I think that there are more ways to screw things
up in the F2L.  With Petrus you can just tell them not to turn
anything but three sides once the 2x2x2 is assembled.

Are you saying I must hit the stackmat&#x27;s two pads at the same time in 
order to stop the timer? That&#x27;s not true.

I figured it would.  I got this idea from the Joel van Noort / Dan
Harris team video.

Ha! If you find a link for such a thing, please let me know! :) Some
would say that the Fridrich method is the best method (right now, most
of the top cubers use that one).  The petrus and roux methods can also
be fast.  There are some fast CF methods, too.  I use Fridrich; there
are many places you can learn, but I happen to like my own
(www.cubewhiz.com).

I am glad you find it helpful. :)  I solve the F2L as I explain also
on my site on the F2L page.  I solve it intuitively, but the way I
solve the corner/edge pairs is the same every time.  Hence, I am
technically using the &quot;algorithms&quot; I listed on my F2L page.  I try to
solve the C/E pairs from all angles and minimizing cube rotations, but
it doesn&#x27;t always work out that way. :)

Not only do you have to worry about the 2x2 aspect of the cube, but
you simultaneously have to worry about keeping it in a 2x2 form.

If it&#x27;s only a possible handicap, I don&#x27;t see why it should be disallowed.

Good idea. Other possibilities are:

10 proven + 20 random + 10 proven
or 10/10/10/10 ...

and so on ...

The technicalities of this is hidden in the code of the scrambling 
program. Transparent to both the user and solver ;-)

Not that i really think the scrambling affects the times all that 
much really. In competitions it&#x27;s most important that everyone get 
same scramble(s) :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I was wondering something about maths, and this is a place where <br>
lots of mathmaticians come... So I guess I can post it here.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if there is something like a threedimensional <br>
version of the Pascal Triangle? The numbers in the pascal triangle <br>
represent the number of ways you can walk to that point from the top <br>
of the triangle. But you can also do something like this in <br>
threespace... For example, you can work out a formula for the number <br>
of ways to walk from the origin to the point (x,y,z) (with x,y,z <br>
Natural numbers), if you can use x+y+z &#x27;steps&#x27;, and you can choose <br>
to walk one &#x27;unit&#x27; in the x, y or z direction during each step. That <br>
way, it&#x27;s possible to define a new &#x27;3D version&#x27; of the binomial <br>
cooficient, with three entries. I worked out a formula for this, but <br>
am I the first one to do this?<br>
<br>
Using this new idea, I found out the number of ways to walk from one <br>
corner of an N^3 cube to the other corner of the cube (number of <br>
ways to walk to the point (N, N, N) in 3-space. The formula is: <br>
(3N)! / ((N!)^3), which is 1680 for the 3x3x3 cube, and 756756 for <br>
the 5x5x5 cube, the last number is pretty funny. For a 100x100x100 <br>
cube:<br>
<br>
376523493564631064367712071965768747782444205128669798396168767743500<br>

400<br>
<br>
LoL.<br>
<br>
I also think I found a new formula for (a + b + c)^n using this <br>
idea :). But I am not sure if it&#x27;s correct.. Have to check it out.<br>
<br>
Cheers! <br>

Hi!

Good idea. Other possibilities are:

10 proven + 20 random + 10 proven
or 10/10/10/10 ...
and so on.

You can´t be serious. The Proven moves are assumed to be known to anyone. Hence you do the inverse of the ten last and are left with 10 +20.
Of course, if x is the proven moves and 40-x the non proven, one has to find the optimum for x. I think that even with an x as high as 30, nobody could make use of the fact that he knows the &quot;proven&quot; moves.
R

...

The technicalities of this is hidden in the code of the scrambling 
program. Transparent to both the user and solver ;-)

Not that i really think the scrambling affects the times all that 
much really. In competitions it&#x27;s most important that everyone get 
same scramble(s) :-)

Cheers!

I also agree it is important, though it is not necessarily essential.
 There IS such a thing as an easy scramble.  For example, most cubers
use Fridrich.  If a scramble has an obvious cross (ie - 1 or 2 move
cross that is obviously the easiest choice) and then each C/E pair
results in a connected pair for the next step, it would not be
unlikely for most competitors to have the same (short) solution. 
There are scrambles that are apparently easier than others, so I think
it is more fair for competitors to receive the same scramble as other
competitors within the round.  I also think that competitors should
not be able to watch a scramble in which they will have to solve.  So,
if you are solving the 3x3x3, you should not be able to watch anybody
else solve that scramble until you have completed your solve.  They
did something like this at WC2003, I recall.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Rune!

I wasn&#x27;t joking. Oh i didn&#x27;t know the &quot;proven&quot; 10 moves were 
supposed to be publicly known. And even if so, there is 24 cube 
orientations to start from. In that case, yes it is not good idea to 
end a scramble with a known sequence, even if the chance of applying 
it backwards correctly is low :-)

Have fun!

-Per

PS! A computer could by simple analysis generate &quot;proven&quot; sequences 
randomly. But then why do that analysis on a subsequence only and 
not the whole scramble? Oh well, maybe this idea about proven 
sequences is a bit paranoid. Not sure ...

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan :-)

Then nobody could claim that person X did faster than Y in round z 
because he had easier scramble and got luckier than others with the 
cross. Or something like that ... Well i do know u understand this 
argument actually ;-) Those who don&#x27;t understand it haven&#x27;t thought 
enough ;-) It&#x27;s just to avoid hindsight discussion/speculation about 
someone being luckier than others. That&#x27;s all. From practical point of 
view maybe it&#x27;s not too important. I know for sure that some megaminx 
scrambling in Gütersloh didn&#x27;t follow the scrambles prescribed on the 
sheet ... Oh well ...

Happy puzzling :-)

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s basically to prevent unfairness in the competition.  Otherwise, 
the possibility exists, to varying degrees, that someone gets a 
ridiculously lucky solve or two, and other people have &#x27;hard&#x27; solves.  
It doesn&#x27;t do &quot;that&quot; much to ensure fairness, but it helps keep the 
peace of mind.

There are of course, disadvantages to this as well.  But they can be 
dealt with.

BUT.. if you can program, just create like an external file with all
those 1211 algorithms and then write some code that randomly gives you
an algorithm

that would actually be kinda cool

          <div class="email-content">Quite a long time ago I wrote a short program using Lars Vandenberghs
ImageCube to display a random PLL situation. It&#x27;s not the entire last
layer, but it&#x27;s some :) It shows only two sides of the cube, but with
training that should be enough to know which situation it is. 

The program should display something like a random U-layer twist,
folled by a random PLL, then a random U-layer twist again and finally
a random twist of the first two layers.

The program is not guaranteed to be bug or error free, and no support
may be given :)

You find it for the BOY-scheme at
http://www.ornen.se/gammal/random.php and for BYO at

Hi Rune!

I wasn&#x27;t joking. Oh i didn&#x27;t know the &quot;proven&quot; 10 moves were 
supposed to be publicly known. And even if so, there is 24 cube 
orientations to start from. In that case, yes it is not good idea to 
end a scramble with a known sequence, even if the chance of applying 
it backwards correctly is low :-)

Yes, and after 10+20 you have got a randomized scrambling and noone can tell, which proved moves would be the best in That situation.
R

Bob, 
Clear?

Have fun!

-Per

PS! A computer could by simple analysis generate &quot;proven&quot; sequences 
randomly. But then why do that analysis on a subsequence only and 
not the whole scramble? Oh well, maybe this idea about proven 
sequences is a bit paranoid. Not sure ...

Cheers!

Could you post the php code here? Coz i am using it many times and i
would like it if its hosted on my comp so i get faster responses, also
i&#x27;ll suck up ur bandwidth :) Also I use green as the top layer so im
not able to instantly respond.  I hope there are no copyright
restrictions or such :)

Also what are those numbers below each image? Are they related to the
PLL algs ? If yes then how do i look up the algos to the numbers, i
mean frm which set have u chosen the algs.
Sachin.

          <div class="email-content">Hi again!

One can easily define what is meant by a &quot;proven&quot; sequence from a 
random state of the cube for example like this :

-A sequence is &quot;proven&quot; if applying it to the current state breaks 
as many as possible of the given pairs (neighbouring cubies/parts) 
and at the same doesn&#x27;t introduce any new pairs with respect to the 
solved state of the puzzle.

I think that&#x27;s a good enough definition to be functionable. Or at 
least it&#x27;s my idea of what it should be :-)

With that definition there can be NO universal &quot;proven&quot; sequence 
which could be applied to any state!! What if the state was simply 
applying the inverse &quot;proven&quot; sequence to the solved state 
itself ? :-P

This makes me come up with another idea. For a move applied to a 
random state define the &quot;pair-breaking factor&quot; (pbf) like this : 

pbf = (pairs broken wrt current state) - (pairs formed wrt solved 
state)

Now for a scramble of given length choose a random move with the 
highest possible pbf. This is quite feasible to do with a real world 
scrambling program. Rank all possible next moves wrt pbf&#x27;s and 
choose randomly next move from the ones on top of the list. I think 
this is quite elegant actually :-)


Cheers!

Just a clarification beforehand: I believe it&#x27;s not important and I am 
not joking.

As long as we both have valid scrambles (e.g. generated by Jaap&#x27;s 
program) everything is fine. There&#x27;s no reason we must have the same 
scramble. Why do you always fear that my scramble might be easier? It 
could also be *your* scramble that&#x27;s easier! And I certainly would not 
complain (unless yours is easier because someone purposely made it so)
.

Also, some organizers ask people how to hold the cube while 
scrambling. That influences the scramble. Some people even have weird 
color schemes so it&#x27;s not even possible to give the &quot;same scramble&quot;. 
That influences the scramble. People use different methods. That 
influences their &quot;difficulty&quot; of a scramble. Even using the same 
method, people use different styles and different algorithms, leading 
to different solutions even for the &quot;same scramble&quot;. That influences 
their &quot;difficulty&quot; of a scramble. The concept of &quot;same scramble&quot; and 
particularly the implication &quot;same scramble means same difficulty&quot; are 
flawed ideas!

There&#x27;s good reason the winner is not determined by average and not 
single solve (if time permits). Single times and single time records 
are meaningless anyway (except Rubik&#x27;s Magic because it&#x27;s always the 
same, and for larger puzzles like 5x5 or Megaminx it&#x27;s a little less 
meaningless).

Btw, in order to have a fair comparison to Macky, I hereby request 
that next tournament I get the same scramble he got for his world 
record. Otherwise it&#x27;s not fair. Right?

Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi again!

One could in this fashion also not define beforehand what the 
scramble length should be, but stop when all possible next moves 
have same pair-braking factor (pbf). Umm, actually that wouldn&#x27;t 
quite work. Each first move will have same pbf at least on the 
cubes ;-) But i think it does make sense after the first move though.

Anyone has any more thoughts on this ?

Well, several ppl already had same scramble as Macky had for his world <br>

I know that person Z wouldn&#x27;t become champion because of a <br>

Reminds me of how I scramble my Megaminx. I tried Jaap&#x27;s scramble 
generator but it takes me 3-4 minutes to scramble that way. So instead 
I scramble freely for 40 seconds, first trying to break all pairs. 
After about 15-20 seconds usually it looks well scrambled. Then until 
second 35 I scramble a bit faster, still watching and trying to break 
pairs when I see them. Last 5 seconds I don&#x27;t look because I don&#x27;t 
want it unnaturally hard, either ;-). Overall it&#x27;s a bit more than 100 
moves usually so I&#x27;m happy enough with it.

Cheers!
Stefan

Because I was not among those people and I want the same chance!

So what?

Example: Had Daniel broken my Megaminx record in Dallas, it would&#x27;ve 
been pretty much that situation. Since his &quot;competitors&quot; there don&#x27;t 
really count, Daniel would have gotten a world record solve with a 
scramble that noone else (who counts) had or ever will get again. 
Would I complain? Certainly not.

Cheers!
Stefan

P.S. Sooner or later someone will get a lucky let&#x27;s say 8 second 3x3 
world record. I hope sooner, then we can stop the single record part 
of this discussion...

Well, i think official competitions should be a little more &quot;serious&quot; <br>
than setting UWR&#x27;s at home where noone else has a chance to repeat ur <br>

The online encyclopaedia of integer sequences has already been pointed out so I&#x27;ll just 
mention the last bit on (a+b+c)^n.
You can expand that using the multinomial theorem:

(x_1+...+x_k)^n

=sum (n;i_1,...,i_k)x_1^{i_1}...x_k^{i_k}

where the sum is over k-tuples of non-negative integers (i_1,...,i_k) such that 
i_1+...+i_k=n and where (n;i_1,...,i_k) is the multinomial coefficient (n!)/(i_1!...i_k!) (that&#x27;s 
not the standard notation for the multinomial coefficient). 
Note that if some i_j=0 then that i_j can be omitted from the notation (as 0!=1).

Technically 0^0 isn&#x27;t defined so you&#x27;d need to assume none of x_1,...,x_k,x_1+...+x_k is 
0. Formally if we assume anything that looks like 0^0=1 then everything works out in that 
case too.

It&#x27;s fairly straightforward to prove this by induction - it&#x27;s trivially true if n=0. Each i_j must 
be 0 so the right hand side has just one summand. The LHS=1 and the RHS=1^k=1.

If n=m+1 by induction 

(x_1+...+x_k)^n=(x_1+...+x_k)*sum (m;i_1,...,i_k)x_1^{i_1}...x_k^{i_k}
(in the sum the i_js sum to m).

Each term will have degree multidegree n being a product of a monomial of degree 1 and 
a monomial off degree n.. Consider the coefficient of 

x_{a_1}^{s_{a_1}}...x_{a_l}^{s_{a_l}} - we can assume that each s_{a_j}>0 as the monomial 
has multidegree n. (The set {a_1,...,a_l} might not be the full set {1...,k}.) Te sum of the 
s_{a_i}s is n.
Write s_{a_j}=t_{a_j}+1 and c=s_{a_1}...s_{a_l}.
The coefficient is then just (m;t_{a_1},s_{a_2},...,s_{a_l})+(m;
s_{a_1},t_{a_2},s_{a_3},...,s_{a_l})+...+(m;s_{a_1},..,s_{a_{l-1}},t_{a_l})
That&#x27;s because you&#x27;ll have a contribution to the coefficient from 
x_{a_j}*sum (m;i_1,...,i_k)x_1^{i_1}...x_k^{i_k}.
(the contribution comes from the summand involving the monomial with i_k=0 unless 
k=a_j in which case i_k=t_{a_j} or k=a_r (r not j) when i_k=s_{a_r}.
So the coeficient will be the sum of (m;t_{a_1},s_{a_2},...,s_{a_l}), 
(m;s_{a_1},t_{a_2},s_{a_3},...,s_{a_l}),...,(m;s_{a_1},s_{a_2},...,s_{a_(l-1)},t_{a_l}),

That&#x27;s m!/(t_{a_1}!...t_{a_l}!) * [s_{a_1}/c+s_{a_2}/c+...+s_{a_l}/c]
=m!/(t_{a_1}!...t_{a_l}!) * [s_{a_1}+s_{a_2}+...+s_{a_l}]/c
=m!/(t_{a_1}!...t_{a_l}!) * [n]/c
=n!/(s_{a_1}!...s_{a_l}!) as required.

Yeah, sorry... only people who have a chance to break the record count 
;-) Thus, looking at the stats, I&#x27;d say Daniel was the only one.

I wanted a real world example but you can also imagine a top cuber 
&quot;competing&quot; against nine &quot;dummies&quot; (just to make it official). That 
would also be a case where if he breaks the record he&#x27;s effectively 
the only one who got that scramble.

          <div class="email-content">Not that weird.  It happens to me all the time.  I think subconciuosly, 
when we think we&#x27;re scrambling randomly, our hands tend to do the same

manage to do it all the time and it makes me kind of angry.  

Actually, a long time ago, I used to not scramble well at all.  
Sometimes I&#x27;d scramble the cube, and then when I looked down it would 
be solved, because unknowingly, I&#x27;d just repeat the same scrambling 
sequence over and over again.

100 average, that would really hurt my arm :P

Usually i stop after roughly 30 solves, my hand hurt.

my best average of 10 now is 32.xx

          <div class="email-content">The code is up at http://www.ornen.se/gammal/random.txt . Use it and 
change it freely for your own.

I take no responsibilities for sloppy coding and you might not 
understand everything. Feel free to contact me about it, but I might not 
understand what I&#x27;ve done anymore either :)

Yes, each number correspond to a specific alg. Which one and why I chose 
it that way I&#x27;ve forgotten :) Feel free to find that out or just change 
the numbering to something you like.

Since the program uses ImageCube, you need to have that installed 
somewhere too. The path to ImageCube is at the very bottom of the code. 
You can find ImageCube on Lars homepage: www.cubezone.be

To change color scheme, you have to change:

$top
$g
$r
$b
$o

I think i wrote it so that the &quot;default&quot; is BOY with yellow on top, 
Blue-F and Red-R

If you have BOY-scheme and finish with green on top, I guess one of the 
four combinations would be (this one with Red-F) :

$top=&quot;ggggggggg&quot;
$g=&quot;o&quot;;
$r=&quot;w&quot;;
$b=&quot;r&quot;;
$o=&quot;y&quot;;

Then I&#x27;d have to remember what M means! Additionally I&#x27;d have to remember two 
algorithms which is too much; I don&#x27;t think I know more than one algorithm for any given 
situation (except possibly PLL for double transposition of opposite edges).  Also it takes a 
while to shift the mouse from R to L (especially on bigger cubes). These days I don&#x27;t have a 
decent mouse anyway and I don&#x27;t cube so I guess I&#x27;ll not be able to test your algorithm.
What does M mean anyway, particularly in the large cube scenario?

I didn&#x27;t compete but... shouldn&#x27;t your 1:58.32 blindsolve be marked as

Oh c&#x27;mon, you can&#x27;t mention it and then keep it secret ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I know there are lots of little sequences of moves that I repeat by
habit when scrambling. For example, at the moment I almost always
start a scramble with L2 B2. If I&#x27;m actually timing and doing an
average then I&#x27;ll always use a scramble generator so I can be
confident that they are valid scrambles and not too similar to the
previous scrambles.

I remember ages ago someone (Lars P?) saying that sometimes what he
does when scrambling is to scramble a bit, then toss the cube in the
air then scramble some more. This seems like a good idea since it
avoids the problem of creating the same/similar scrambled states if
you (even subconsciously) use the same/similar paths or finger tricks
when scrambling. Unless, of course, you catch the cube in exactly the
same position as it had been when it left your hands.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; What does M mean anyway, particularly in the large cube scenario?<br>
<br>
Hey Richard,<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think there has ever been an official declaration of big cube<br>
notation, but I belive so far that this version has been the most<br>
accepted.<br>
<br>
The faces are denoted by the same letters as usual, lowercase means<br>
faces behind the outermost ones.  Numbers in brackets declare how far<br>
back.<br>
<br>
So from left to right the faces are:<br>
L l[1] l[2] l[3] ... l[k] ... l[floor((n-2)/2)] r[floor((n-2)/2)] ...<br>
r[k] ... r[3] r[2] r[1] R<br>
<br>
That doesn&#x27;t leave any space for the middlemost slice on odd nxnxn<br>
cubes though, so we denote that slice M<br>
<br>
so in general:<br>
L l[1] l[2] l[3] ... l[k] ... l[floor((n-2)/2)] M(if the cube is odd)<br>
r[floor((n-2)/2)] ... r[k] ... r[3] r[2] r[1] R<br>
<br>
So the other faces would be:<br>
U u[1] u[2] u[3] ... u[k] ... u[floor((n-2)/2)] E(if the cube is odd)<br>
d[floor((n-2)/2)] ... d[k] ... d[3] d[2] d[1] D<br>
<br>
and<br>
F f[1] f[2] f[3] ... f[k] ... f[floor((n-2)/2)] S(if the cube is odd)<br>
b[floor((n-2)/2)] ... b[k] ... b[3] b[2] b[1] B<br>
<br>
Basically M is between L and R, E is between U and D, and S is between<br>
F and B.<br>
<br>
The turning directions are as M=L, E=D, S=F<br>
<br>
I just remember that the acronym LDF goes with MES respectively to<br>
remember how to turn.<br>
<br>
Someone correct me if that is not the accepted notation for nxnxn<br>
cubes, but as far as I know that was correct.<br>
<br>
Also the MES stuff is correct for the 5x5x5 cube and 3x3x3 cube now.<br>

couple of years, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve quit for good! I&#x27;ve been doing a <br>
lot of work on my new site, which has even more cool F2L tricks. I&#x27;ll <br>
also finally show all of my PLL algorithms which I hand picked from <br>
cube algorithm generators utilizing 2 and 3 faces only. Anyway, I live <br>
like an hour away from Orlando now so I&#x27;m psyched about going to the <br>
World Championship. Maybe I can finish in the top 50, but since I <br>
stopped cubing my previous best average of 24.96 went from like 40th to <br>
100th now :( That is a good sign for our community though! Well, I&#x27;ll <br>
let you know the progress of the new site (I know I promised on like, <br>

I call it the Dickens method: &quot;I do the best of times and the worst of 
times&quot;.

To summarize, I ranged from 16 to 49 seconds... I screwed up a LOT of 
LL algs, and had a few pops. Not sure why.

And I seem to have beaten a Swedish and a European record during all 
that chaos.

Oohhh, ok... to me it sounded like you invented yet another timing 
device.

Btw, I just saw that according to rubiks.com &quot;Rubik&#x27;s fans are 
applauding the all new release of the custom designed RUBIK&#x27;S TIMER.&quot;. 
Hmm... no, I won&#x27;t comment this. They also say it computes averages of 
10, does it not support other lenghts?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">I was at a cafe this weekend with some friends and had been cubing on
and off during the afternoon. The cube was sitting scrambled on the
table when a guy walked past and claimed that he could &quot;solve it
really fast&quot;.

The guy really didn&#x27;t have a speedcuber vibe about him. I don&#x27;t even
know what this means, but I immediately felt that he wasn&#x27;t a
speedcuber. Anyway, the conversation went like this...

Anonymous guy (pointing to the scrambled cube): I can solve that
really fast.
Me (getting a distinctly non-cubey vibe from the guy): Really. How fast?
Anonymous guy: Um. How many sides?
Me (thinking if he&#x27;s asking about &#x27;how many sides&#x27; then it&#x27;s almost
certain that he can&#x27;t solve the whole cube): All of them.
Anonymous guy: Um. &lt;paused, looking slightly embarrassed now> Maybe 6
minutes?
Me: I can do it a lot faster than that.
Anonymous guy: How fast?
Me: About 30 seconds.
Anonymous guy (looking slightly embarrassed): Oh. &lt;walks away...>
My friend who&#x27;d been sitting next to me during this exchange: You sure
showed him!!

I think maybe he was just trying to show off and since most non-cubers
would be impressed (at least a little) by watching someone solve 1
side, he thought he&#x27;d get away with it. He obviously wasn&#x27;t expecting
to encounter a real speedcuber! :)

To be fair though, I think we all know that the probability of
encountering a girl who is also a ~30s solver is extremely low!

This happened to me at a dorm party a few weeks ago - the guy who&#x27;s

of everyone.

I would like to say &quot;Thank You!&quot; to Tyson for all his hard work 
setting up and running the NorCal tournament. I had a blast and 
recorded some great personal times. 

Tyson&#x27;s WR blindfold solve was very impressive and well-deserved, 
especially for someone who puts so much time into cubing tournaments 
and cubing publicity.

Thanks, Tyson!

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s terrible! At least you can resticker though. It&#x27;s better than
someone stealing or breaking your speedcube. :/

As I was getting a non-cubey vibe from the guy, I wasn&#x27;t about to
handover my best speedcube and ask him to prove his claim. If he&#x27;d
sounded a bit more confident and didn&#x27;t ask me how many &#x27;sides&#x27; then I
would have asked him what his method was. If he&#x27;d &#x27;talked the talk&#x27;
so-to-speak, then I probably would have handed over my cube and asked
him to show me.

          <div class="email-content">Big thanks to all who helped bring an official tournament to Idaho!  <br>
I know Frank in particular put a lot of effort in to this event, and <br>
I&#x27;m sure he had lots of help.  Thanks also to the cubers who <br>
traveled to get here, especially Chris Hunt and his brother who <br>
mastered the magic just in the &#x27;nick&#x27; of time.  <br>
<br>
It really should be referred to as the Northwestern tournament--<br>
there were cubers from Seattle, Tacoma, Moscow [Idaho] and various <br>
other parts of Idaho.  <br>
<br>
two personal observations about this event: first, it shows you <br>
don&#x27;t have to go to California or NY if you want to attend an <br>
official event--just come to Idaho next time! or, if you&#x27;re willing <br>
to put forth the effort, host one where you are.    <br>
<br>
Second, you don&#x27;t have to be sub-20 to go and compete and have fun <br>
at these events.  From my perspective anyway, cubing is more about <br>
competing against your own times.  We had cubers of all skill and <br>
time ranges, and it made for a good event.<br>
<br>
thanks again all!<br>

Maybe he can really do it and thinks he&#x27;s fast and is just sick of 
those stupid liars who claim they can do it much faster which he 
believes is impossible so *he* thought *he* is the real cuber and 
*you* are not and went away because of that.

just got home from the Idaho Tournament, it was a blast!!  I didn&#x27;t<br>
compete in the 5x5 though for two reasons...<br>
1.  I suck at the 5x5<br>
2.  mine is broken.<br>
<br>
it&#x27;s broken because one of the orange corner-center pieces kind of<br>
snapped off.  so, I can still use it, because the little part that<br>
hooks into the cube is still there, but the actualy face is gone, so<br>
it&#x27;s like a little hole in the orange side.  I was wondering...I<br>
highly doubt this is doable, but if anyone by chance has a spare<br>
corner-center piece, whatever color, could I have it?  like I said,<br>
I&#x27;m guessing no one has a bunch of 5x5 pieces just lying around, but I<br>
thought I&#x27;d check.  there&#x27;s a chance I can just glue it back together,<br>
but I doubt that&#x27;ll work.  maybe I&#x27;ll just buy a new one, but I&#x27;d<br>

&gt; Yeah, broad is bad.  If it were phrased &quot;offensive clothing,&quot; just <br>
&gt; how far down would you have to drill? ...<br>
--- thewetdog wrote:<br>
&gt; I agree with Tyson, that the definition of &quot;offensive&quot; is rather<br>
&gt; subjective.<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that it was objective - in fact, by <br>
definition, what is &quot;offensive&quot; is highly subjective.  Something that <br>
is offensive to one person (or even a large group of people), is very <br>
likely commonplace for others.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t make it clear <br>
that I was merely looking for a rule or set of rules that govern(s) <br>
articles of clothing that &quot;display &#x27;offensive&#x27; or &#x27;controversial&#x27; <br>
content&quot;.  I wasn&#x27;t trying to come up with the final wording for such <br>
a rule - that would be up to the governing body (WCA).  Also, Bob was <br>
kind enough to let us know (since I hadn&#x27;t taken the time to check) <br>
that such a rule does exist.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t take the time to <br>
look into that in the first place.<br>

--- Tyson Mao wrote:<br>
&gt; ... David Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; shirt could be considered<br>
&gt; offensive by many  people.  In my opinion, that was a little bad<br>
&gt; taste.  He knew there would publicity at that competition.  A cube<br>
&gt; competition is no place to promote your own personal beliefs.<br>
<br>
--- Kirk wrote:<br>
&gt; ... &quot;Jesus Is Lord&quot; was acceptable within the rules, and it may<br>
&gt; have been precisely because of the potential publicity that he<br>
&gt; chose to wear that shirt that day--isn&#x27;t that what anyone who has a<br>
&gt; message they want to advertise would do?  Same reason sponsors put<br>
&gt; their logos on clothing.  <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I guess I don&#x27;t see a signfiicant distinction between one&#x27;s right<br>
&gt; of commercial promotion vs. religious promotion...<br>
<br>
Putting aside the already addressed issue of country (read &quot;freedoms&quot; <br>
in the USA) vs. international appropriateness, this does bring up a <br>
good point.  While Tyson obviously does see a difference between <br>
commercial and religious promotion, there are others who prefer not <br>
to (or simply don&#x27;t) make that distinction.  I think it&#x27;s important <br>
to note that regardless who/what we represent with our attire, our <br>
actions and attitudes will reflect on that individual/group.  I&#x27;m <br>
sure David had this in mind, and would expect that anyone <br>
representing a company would do the same as they compete and interact <br>
with other competitors. I personally (just to throw in my opinion) <br>
agree that where commercial promotion would be allowed, statements of <br>
personal belief are reasonable, provided it is &quot;self&quot; promotion, and <br>
not &quot;other&quot; deprecating.<br>
<br>
--- thewetdog wrote:<br>
&gt; It is too bad that some people don&#x27;t have the common courtesy or<br>
&gt; commonsense to pick their personal messages accordingly.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, depending on the message, it may require more than <br>
common sense or courtesy.  As I said, things that are offensive to <br>
some are not necessarily offensive to all.  More than that, something <br>
may be so commonplace to someone that they may not realize it could <br>
be offensive to someone (or a group of people) with whom they have <br>
not yet had contact.<br>

P.S. I&#x27;m not trying to be argumentative, or offensive, but did want <br>
to give some explanation behind my thoughts on this conversation.<br>

&gt; I would think someone showing up decked out in a Camel or Marlboro<br>

&gt; would be extremely bad taste.  But I now understand that there are<br>
&gt; no real rules on the subject.  Do we wait until this situation<br>
&gt; arises to make a rule, or do we just say that it is all fair game?<br>
<br>
Whether you wait until the situation arises or not, I believe this <br>
would be an extremely difficult issue to address in rules.  Where to <br>
draw the line between what is okay, and what is too much, would be <br>
subjective, and opinions could vary widely.<br>

Apologies if it did get sent:


An old thread I know but ...
I was searching through some old vinyl - LPs and singles from a long time
ago - and I found a single that I forgot I had.  I won it in the 1982 (3?)
Radio Budapest fewest moves competition along with other memorabilia.  Its
made in Hungary but sung in English and word sheet is included so repeated

Trick in the Middle (Rubik&#x27;s Cube)
by B Muszty and A Dobey

If you miss the evening train
And you&#x27;re standing in the rain
   - life&#x27;s not roses all the way
When your tax return is false
And you&#x27;ve bet on the wrong horse
   - the Cube won&#x27;t lead you astray

Taking a sunbath on the beach
For a magazine you reach
   - life&#x27;s not roses all the way
Headlines seem to have no meaning
And you&#x27;re sceptical of reading
   - the Cube won&#x27;t lead you astray

Try to harmonize the colours of your life
Or the faces of the Cube to be alike
You can twist, twiddle and fiddle
But the trick&#x27;s in the middle
of the Cube - Rubik Rubik&#x27;s Cube

Your son&#x27;s taking drugs
Your house if full of bugs
   - life&#x27;s not roses all the way
No one calls you honey
Your wife drinks all your money
   - the Cube won&#x27;t lead you astray

When your true love is gone
Don&#x27;t you look for your gun
   - life&#x27;s not roses all the way
Don&#x27;t you weep, don&#x27;t you mourn
You can fiddle on your own ...
   - the Cube won&#x27;t lead you astray

Try to harmonize the colours of your life
Or the faces of the Cube to be alike
You can twist, twiddle and fiddle
But the trick&#x27;s in the middle
of the Cube - Rubik Rubik&#x27;s Cube

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I wanted to run a couple of ideas by you guys.<br>
<br>
1.  Instead of allowing competitors to choose the U-color and F-color, <br>
three colors (A, B, and C) are drawn randomly at the beginning of each <br>
competition.  The cubes are then scrambled with A as the U-face and B <br>
as the F-face.  If B is not possible as the F-face, it is substituted <br>
with C.  Doing this will save time for the scramblers, and make it <br>
easier for us to keep track.  There&#x27;s no &quot;someone&#x27;s getting shafted&quot; <br>
because it&#x27;s random and you have no way of knowing beforehand and thus <br>
it&#x27;s equal.<br>
<br>
2.  We are wanting to eliminate to POP for 2006.  Without POP solves, <br>
in an average of 5, as Lars said, you have to pop 40% of the time for <br>
it to really affect you and that&#x27;s just unacceptable.  However, the <br>
argument still stands that &#x27;mean of&#x27; competitors who popped would <br>
essentially be taken out of the competition.  Common &#x27;mean of&#x27; events <br>
are the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube, which, upon popping, are generally not <br>
trivial fixes.  I&#x27;d like to run the idea that POPs are eliminated for <br>
&#x27;average&#x27; competition but still included in the &#x27;mean of&#x27; competition.<br>

          <div class="email-content">So under this proposal, would the competitor be allowed to use the 
15 second inspection time to examine the cube and place it back down 
with the desired face up?

Personally, I&#x27;m all in favor of making it easier on the judges and 
scramblers.  There&#x27;s a lot of effort that goes into these events, 
and there&#x27;s no reason to make it any more difficult or time 
consuming than it actually has to be.  The proposal seems even-
handed--every competitor gets the same mixed up cube.  So my initial 
reaction is it sounds reasonable to me.

But I would want to place the cube down during the inspection with 
my preferred side up.  It wouldn&#x27;t give an advantage to anyone, and 
would be consistent with current practices.

          <div class="email-content">I agree completely.  It would be far too difficult if not impossible 
to craft language covering every possible way someone might wear 
something that would be offensive to someone (or even to many).  And 
even if you covered all the language or types of pictures that could 
be offensive, I can think of some outfits that don&#x27;t have pictures or 
words but would still be offensive to many.  

I suppose we could require everyone to wear uniforms to compete.  
That&#x27;s one way to eliminate this risk.

The other more practical solution is to imbue the WCA delegate with 
discretion to determine on an ad hoc basis if something is so 
offensive that the person wearing it should not be allowed to compete 
while wearing it.  I would hope that such determinations would be 
limited to something extremely vulgar or pornographic, which is how I 
would interpret the &quot;vulgar or offensive&quot; terms in the rules.  You 
could include a safe-gap measure that such a determination would need 
to be ratified by 3 other judges so that a capricious judge&#x27;s decision 
wouldn&#x27;t be final, and you could even allow the competitor a few 
minutes to change or something.

But has this really been an issue historically, or is this just much 
ado about nothing?  Can&#x27;t we just encourage other people to try to use 
some common sense and try not to take offense at the ideas others try 
to express?

          <div class="email-content">I disagree.  Competitors should not expect the cube to be placed in <br>
front of him/her a certain way.<br>
<br>
For one of my solves at the Dallas competition, I had asked the judge <br>
before starting my solve whether the blue center was in front and yellow <br>
center was on top.  She told me it was, so when I started memorizing, I <br>
hadn&#x27;t realized I was holding the cube the wrong way.<br>
<br>
It should not be the judge&#x27;s job to place the cube in front of the <br>

pay attention to these things.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Another simple solution to this problem would be to give t-shirts to everyone and say that they must wear them at all competitions. 

This would work for something big like theWC2005, But for smaller tourneys, I guess &quot;offensive&quot; would be dicided by the organizing commity.

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I have to agree with Leyan and call myself an idiot.  One of <br>
my main objectives is to reduce the amount of responsibility on the <br>
judges where appropriate.  In a standard 3x3x3 speed solve competition, <br>
this is not an issue.  I&#x27;m pretty confident the blindfold cubers out <br>
there won&#x27;t mind the extra half second it takes for them to put the <br>
right colors in front of them.<br>
<br>
The fact remains that finding judges for a competition is always <br>
difficult.  Finding judges that are willing to stay the entire day is <br>
extremely difficult.  I have been very fortunate to go to a school with <br>
people named Mark who solve the cube in about 45 to 50 seconds and thus <br>
I have a limited supply of &#x27;skilled&#x27; judges.  Until cubers are willing <br>
to attend competitions where they do not compete at all, &#x27;skilled&#x27; <br>
judges will always be a rarity and a precious resource when present.<br>
<br>
With that being said, I remember it was once requested that the judge <br>
picks up and inspects the cube rapidly after the competitor has <br>
finished solving.  Whereas this would be nice, if a judge forgets, <br>
please don&#x27;t grab your cube and insist that the judge wasn&#x27;t paying <br>
attention and didn&#x27;t inspect your cube.  Instead, what I do is I tell <br>
my judge to inspect the cube and hand it back to me.  Not only does it <br>
teach the judge a lesson, but it also makes sure you follow all the <br>
rules completely.  If you&#x27;re aware of the rules, you can enforce them <br>
yourself.  Please don&#x27;t blame something on a judge when you could have <br>
corrected yourself.  This is just a general statement and aimed at no <br>
one.  I read that last statement again in my head and realized that I <br>
could be misunderstood.<br>

P.S.  Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but if you hold the wrong centers to you <br>
and you try to BLD, baring an unsolvable parity error (can that <br>
happen), do you get a nice pretty &#x27;dot&#x27; design?<br>

&gt; For one of my solves at the Dallas competition, I had asked the judge<br>
&gt; before starting my solve whether the blue center was in front and <br>
&gt; yellow<br>
&gt; center was on top.  She told me it was, so when I started memorizing, I<br>
&gt; hadn&#x27;t realized I was holding the cube the wrong way.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; It should not be the judge&#x27;s job to place the cube in front of the<br>

&gt; pay attention to these things.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; So under this proposal, would the competitor be allowed to use the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 15 second inspection time to examine the cube and place it back down<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the desired face up?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally, I&#x27;m all in favor of making it easier on the judges and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; scramblers.  There&#x27;s a lot of effort that goes into these events,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and there&#x27;s no reason to make it any more difficult or time<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; consuming than it actually has to be.  The proposal seems even-<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; handed--every competitor gets the same mixed up cube.  So my initial<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; reaction is it sounds reasonable to me.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; But I would want to place the cube down during the inspection with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; my preferred side up.  It wouldn&#x27;t give an advantage to anyone, and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be consistent with current practices.<br>

I&#x27;d like to hope, though I know this isn&#x27;t true, that if someone is  
smart enough to solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, then they&#x27;re smart enough not to  
wear clothing with alcohol or tobacco slogans, profanity, vulgarity,  
obscenities, and that they&#x27;ve got enough control to refrain from  
promoting any messages (such as Hawaiian Independence or Join My Cult)  
at an international event where people from different backgrounds and  
cultures may be sensitive to things which we take for granted.

I guess this is the one time I can smile at my perfectly mundane  
wardrobe.  Oh, except for that one prank t-shirt.  I won&#x27;t be wearing  
that one to WC 2005.

          <div class="email-content">I would strongly advocate equal rights for stickers of all colors <br>
mainly because, though it is fair to select A-B-C and set them for <br>
every competition, I know people out there all have different color <br>
preferences.  It definitely won&#x27;t get annoying for the scramblers <br>
because if you do one competition, after three solves into the next <br>
competition, you wouldn&#x27;t even have to think twice.  I for one have <br>
gotten to the point where after the second solve of the first round, <br>
I&#x27;m pretty sure someone could hand me a cube, and I could tell you <br>
who&#x27;s cube it was and what color scheme they requested (since we&#x27;ve <br>
been asking for color scheme in the past).<br>
<br>
Really nasty greasy cube?  That&#x27;s Edison Park&#x27;s and he wants green on <br>
top.  Textured tiles with Cube Smith logo on white center?  That&#x27;s Jeff <br>
Soesbe and white on top, orange in front.  Tiled cube that turns very <br>
well?  Yellow on top, blue in front.  New Cube Smith stickers, slight <br>
white line underneath the orange sticker on the white/orange edge?  <br>
That&#x27;s Alan Chang&#x27;s cube and he has no preference.  Paper sticker cube <br>
coated with nail polish to prevent peeling of stickers?  That&#x27;s Timothy <br>
Wong and he&#x27;s cool because he goes white/green.  Warren&#x27;s cube has a <br>
slightly grainy feeling to it which is similar to Lars Petrus&#x27; cube but <br>
it&#x27;s a bit looser and his green is different.  Matthew Wallisa has <br>
older Cube Smith stickers and his blue is the same blue as on my BLD <br>
cube and he goes blue/white.  Mike Grimsley&#x27;s cube says skeenegee on <br>
the white center.  Cube that pops at the slightest touch, is loose <br>
beyond belief, absolutely ridiculous, and has an X carved into the red <br>
center sticker?  Frank Chang... loosest cube at the Caltech Spring 2005 <br>
competition.  Second loosest cube I&#x27;ve felt, losing out only Kenneth <br>
Brandon&#x27;s cube from Caltech Winter 2004.<br>
<br>
It would be really easy to randomly select three colors and it won&#x27;t <br>
really be tedious at all.  Plus, I think it could be kind of fun having <br>
a bunch of Chris&#x27; tiles in a hat and reaching in for three.  <br>
Furthermore, selecting random colors at the competition is another way, <br>
though there really shouldn&#x27;t be any doubt, to further show that I am <br>
indeed running a fair competition.  After WC 2003, I try to make it a <br>
point that randomly generated scrambles are not checked for &#x27;luckiness&#x27; <br>
because there is not uniform definition for luckiness.<br>
<br>
Also, it&#x27;s fun to say I stand for equal rights.<br>

If you really want to make it easier for the organizers you&#x27;ll finally 
accept that it doesn&#x27;t matter and thus caring about it means 
unnecessary overhead work.

Or do you want to force me to solve with a certain method, too? And 
force me to start with a certain color, too? And make the same 
decisions as everyone else? And use the same algorithms as everyone 
else? So that we all end up with the same solution?

Mainly it&#x27;s this: What sense does it make requesting a certain way to 
hold the cube for scrambling, if you don&#x27;t request the same for 
solving??

Besides that, I&#x27;d also say making the judge orient the cube is just 
unnatural and wrong. If you let a non-cuber scramble your cube for a 
demo, would you expect him/her to return the cube with a certain 
orientation?

Same in no-inspection contests, btw, where I hope people don&#x27;t always 
start with a certain orientation (e.g. white center already on D). I 
know this has been violated and I wish the rules would forbid it...

Depends on whether you check it. I check that corners and edges have 
the same parity so I&#x27;d detect the parity case during memorization 
(actually only at the very end, sadly ;-).

Ok, that&#x27;s the first reasonable reason I&#x27;ve heard :-)

Though for scrambling I just grab the cube as it comes. I think in 
this case you overestimate the power of the subconscious ;-). You 
could also toss it in the air before you start. Still &quot;easier&quot; than 
having to follow a rule, I&#x27;d claim...

Right, the cube must be perfectly random. A scramble has to apply to <br>

I think someone had a cube which could actually be turned by tossing it

You might&#x27;ve seen that I often advocate &quot;naturalness&quot; and try to 
imitate &quot;real world&quot; scenarios, e.g. one-handed inspection for 
one-handed solving because it&#x27;s like that for a real one-handed 
person.

In this case, I&#x27;d say the key natural aspect is that you don&#x27;t plan 
ahead (which should be measured because it&#x27;s part of solving). So I 
believe it&#x27;d still be in the right spirit if the competitor could see 
the cube before the solve for a very short time.

Therefore I&#x27;d suggest: Judge covers cube with sheet of paper. 
Competitor says &quot;go&quot;. Judge immediately pulls the sheet away. 
Competitor immediately starts solving.

Btw, when I said I know the rule has been violated, I meant the UWR 
list. I have no idea how it has been done in contests so far. For UWRs 
I&#x27;d simply like to ask people to not orient the cube beforehand in 
order to get meaningful times and more importantly meaningful 
comparisons. I&#x27;ve been told that a former leader in that list had 
oriented the cubes beforehand, and I&#x27;ve always been wondering how Mark 
Waterman did it in his &quot;marathons&quot; and now that this has become an UWR 
list, I&#x27;d like to know about the people on it, too:
http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_misc_marathon.html
It makes me a bit sad that such an important regulation is missing.

Btw, did you see the rules already enforce a certain way?
http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations.html

See article 4. Though, it should be rewritten. What if I have white 
opposite blue and no green? Then it&#x27;s impossible to follow the rule. 
I&#x27;d suggest &quot;brightest color on top, darkest adjacent color on front&quot;.

Simple:
stores cost money.

Did you have a look at the Scandinavian speedstacks site? At least 
that should make shipping easier.

And actually what do u mean an unsolveble parity? Like only 2 corners

          <div class="email-content">Hey Sachin,

If you consider solving the pieces around the centers in different
ways, then you have to consider the centers as pieces as well, and no
longer as fixed points.

The way I think of it is this, do a rotation y (spin the cube like the
move U).

If you imagine that you just did an algorithm to your cube, you have 4
cycled the corners in both the U and D layers.  Two odd cycles is an
even permutation, so you have left the corner permutation alone in
terms of parity.

For the edges you have 4 cycled the edges in both the U and D layers,
as well as the middle layer.  An odd number of odd cycles is an odd
permutation, so your spinning of the cube affected the parity of the
edges to make them odd (if you started from &quot;solved&quot; and if you
consider that all the centers have no stickers and you are just
solving the pieces).

So every quarter turn spin of the cube will change the parity of the
edges with respect to the corners.  Since it it possible to swap two
corners and two edges though you can make this appear to be either two
corners or two edges swapped.

So if you solve with centers without stickers you will get parity 1/2
the time if you just try to solve the pieces of your cube normally. 
This is because 12 of the 24 possible rotations of the cube require an
odd number of quarter turn spins to get there from the solved state
(defined as even).

Sorry if that was long winded, but basically if the centers are
indistinct (like solving BLD without seeing if your centers are
correct) then a parity is possible on the 3x3x3 cube.

          <div class="email-content">It seems to me that giving a standard for which color is placed where
will undoubtedly favor certain color schemes and competitors over
others.  If, for example, yellow was chosen for the top, most
competitors would be fine, because that seems to be the majority of
cubers&#x27; preference.  Red, I suspect, would give similar results.  If
blue were chosen for the top, the Japanese color scheme users would be
given an advantage, however slight it may be.

Basically, I think the entire issue is trivial.  In fact, when I start
with the cube oriented with my LL color on top, it&#x27;s often harder for
me to be creative and get decent F2L times.  However, I think this is
a less fair approach to the problem than the current rule.

Put the cube in a box. Toss the box in the air. Take the cube out

          <div class="email-content">You should be able to immediately know the orientation of the cube
once you see two centers, right?  And when you first look at it,
wouldn&#x27;t you check the orientation anyway?  After all, you don&#x27;t want
to start memorizing the wrong cross.  Even if the cube is oriented the
way I would hold it, I still check to make sure that when I start
solving the cross, I&#x27;ll be putting the white edges onto the white side.

I can do L U&#x27; R&#x27;U L&#x27;U&#x27;R (U2) in a little over a second.  Couple that
with an edge PLL, and that makes for a sub-3 LL.  Seems worth it to me...

It was only a joke. The box would need to fit closely around the 
cube. And also you&#x27;d just take the cube out of the box the same way 
you put it there ... :-P

White is the U-face for me, unless another first face really sticks 
out as better. I do basically sorta LBL for all kinds of cubes with 
U as first face. White as U should also be good for say fridrich and 
then ending with OLL and PLL on the white face/layer. For fridrich 
maybe simply the easiest cross will decide?

Oh well ...

      Isn&#x27;t that just a uniform?
  I guess this would be considered a uniform.



      I&#x27;d like to hope, though I know this isn&#x27;t true, that if someone is  
      smart enough to solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, then they&#x27;re smart enough not to  
      wear clothing with alcohol or tobacco slogans, profanity, vulgarity,  
      obscenities, and that they&#x27;ve got enough control to refrain from  
      promoting any messages (such as Hawaiian Independence or Join My Cult)  
      at an international event where people from different backgrounds and  
      cultures may be sensitive to things which we take for granted.

  While alcohol annd tobacco are not illegal and are somewhat acceptable, the rest is a definite not. 
  I do not remember this being an issue at WC2003.

      I guess this is the one time I can smile at my perfectly mundane  
      wardrobe.  Oh, except for that one prank t-shirt.  I won&#x27;t be wearing  
      that one to WC 2005.

  I plan on taking my WC2003 t-shirt with me to WC2005. But some lifestyles and religions smack 
  in the face of others. Don&#x27;t know how to get around this.

   I&#x27;ve no doubt you run a fair competition.

   Do you screen the &quot;random&quot; tournament scrambles by running them
through solving programs and throwing out any that are solved in fewer
than, say, 18 moves?

   Do you screen those scrambles for ones containing completed
crosses, or that have four corners already solved?

David J

P.S. Some of this stuff is funny to me because I use a non-BOY color
scheme and a method which is not cross-first.

care how the scrambler holds my cube.  I must admit, I do not really
understand why choosing a color to hold on top during a scramble has
any real effect on the solution.  Since so many people do care, I
would bet it does have an effect, I just fail to see it.  Anyone care
to explain?

Really, it looks very nice and effective, probably simpler than the
one I made earlier.  If I ever get around to designing the logic
circuit that makes it behave like a stackmat, I&#x27;ll be sure to let you
know!

Hey Daniel, 
Thanks. It&#x27;s not hard to do. All the wiring is between the two pieces of wood. I used an inexpensive stopwatch and changed the buttons for wire. Here are the schematics:

Really, it looks very nice and effective, probably simpler than the
one I made earlier.  If I ever get around to designing the logic
circuit that makes it behave like a stackmat, I&#x27;ll be sure to let you
know!

The original problem is, how to give the same chances to every 
competitor?
1) They should be given the same cubes, i.e. the same scramble 
applied to the same color scheme.
2) Competitors should not be able to see others&#x27; solves on the scene 
or on a live display.
(maybe that&#x27;s what they did in 1982?)

Let&#x27;s focus on 1). Since you can&#x27;t force everybody to use the same 
color scheme, a choice has to be made about the reference colors to 
use (cube orientation), with minimum bias and organizational 
constraints.

Gilles.

e.g. Rubik&#x27;s Cube.

About your puzzle: I believe it&#x27;s incomplete (not only because the 
question is missing). There are several versions of this puzzle but 
this one is impossible.

hello sir and all my friends of this wonderful group,

I am new member of this group.Friends i am not able to solve following puzzle.If any one of you can help me in finding soloution then i will be very help full.please reply soon.

 

 

BOYwas going a long term behind the bars for &#x27;flirting with my daughter&#x27; as said the King. When the King learnt from his advisers that marriages are made in heaven&#x27; he was not too sure; so he decided to try it out.

&quot;There&#x27;s a door on your left and a door on your right,&quot; said the King to BOY, &quot;one of these leads to the princess and the other to a ferocious tiger. You are permitted just one question, which will be answered by the Court Jester in &#x27;Yes&#x27;, or &#x27;No&#x27;. However, he may choose to answer truthfully or tell a lie. Thereafter you take the door you like and either you have my daughter or the tiger has you

Best Avg of 10 is 41.57 seconds
(29.85) 50.16 31.61 (54.37) 40.35 38.72 33.14 48.52 40.09 42.73 46.65
43.69

I took an average of 30 yesterday (no dropped times).  The avg of all
30 was 44.03 with one time in the 50+ range.  Nearly all my solves are
sub-45 now with the occasional mess-up of an alg resulting in 50+
second times (or the 1/50 solve rate that I actually drop the cube
still!) :(  I did get a 32.xx yesterday that included me dropping the
cube on the floor and it rolled under my bed, but that was a PLL skip. :)

<br>
Yesterday Ton and I arrived back home from Poland.<br>
Polish Open 2005 was the best tournament I ever attended, that was <br>
organized completely by volunteers. <br>
We had a fantastic weekend, of which I will post a report soon.<br>
<br>
But I definitely need a shrink! Man, I am not nervous, am fully in <br>
control and still set so baaaad times. I tried everything: going <br>
slowly, going very fast, fully concentrating, relaxed solving. But <br>
when it counts, I just do not do my normal thing. I cannot find the <br>
pieces, I lock up during algorithms, mess up the cross, mess up F2L <br>
pairs, use wrong algorithms.<br>
<br>
The only excuse I have is that I am always very busy organizing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am not going to give up organizing, so I have to find <br>
another way to improve my competition times. Help!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

I can&#x27;t claim to be expert on 3x3x3 cubes but still my simple advice 
is to go for the black DIY-kit when u want a real good 3x3x3 
speedcube. The studio 4x4x4&#x27;s are excellent cubes however. It&#x27;s 
debatable what is the best 4x4x4, Studio or Rubiks.com. My vote is 
for the Studio one. It seems to me the molding/assembly is more 
accurate somehow.

I would also advice everyone to have same colors stickers on all 
their cubes. Then i really mean SAME nuance of EACH of the 6 colors. 
Easiest way to make sure of this is to get replacement stickers for 
all sizes from same source. (I&#x27;d really recommend cubesmith stickers 
as the quality is excellent!) It makes life a whole lot easier with 
recognition. And besides the feel on touching the cubes will be 
similar ...

Have fun :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

Did you ever perform normally in a competitive environment?

If so, when did you first fail to perfom normally, or start to? What
was the difference between that time and before that?

Sometimes an inconsequential something or other becomes a &quot;thing&quot; and
thereby becomes substantial, so to speak.  There&#x27;s no fixed definition
for it, only that something changed, and *that* is interfering with
your concentration: like &quot;in the back of your mind&quot; you know you can
screw up. 

Identify the &quot;thing&quot; and recognize it for what it is.

The mind is very adaptable, kind of like an enthusiastic puppy. Oh!
this is how I can do that very well; Oh! this is how I can do that
very poorly. You are just learning that you can do &quot;awful&quot;, as well as
you can do &quot;perfect&quot;.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s interesting.  The main thing that&#x27;s slowing me down is 
*executing* (not learning) the F2L as well as the cross.  I have a lot 
of tutorials to work through at Dan&#x27;s Cubestation page.

I didn&#x27;t think it was hard to learn the algs at all.  What I did was go 
through a few dozen solves, using the sheets from the original Fridrich 
page and applying the correct algorithm to each case.

I can&#x27;t stress this enough: Don&#x27;t just memorize!  Pay attention to what 
the cube is doing when you are walking through each algorithm!!  All 
but a few of the algorithms have a very straightforward logic to them 
and you would do well to understand it.  Most of the time you are just 
trying to get the corner and edge pieces to line up in a certain way.  
Knowing how this works will really help you learn the F2L&#x27;s.  Good luck.

Hi Per,

I put  photo from Rubik&#x27;s dot com of their White Do It Yourself Cube
in files:

http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/vwp?.dir=/&amp;.src=gr&amp;.dnm=White+DIY+Cube.jpg&amp;.view=t&amp;.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%26.view=t

Look at the edge piece in the photo, see how it has a part which
sticks out, (where you can&#x27;t see it when the cube is together)? That
part that sticks out fits neatly under the center, and also inside the
circle formed by the second layer. That circle holds the edges
horizontally, while the center holds them in vertically. The corner
piece has a little foot which tucks under the edge pieces.

Hope that helps!

David J

Does anyone here solve f2l intutively and is still sub-20? That will

Hmm, interesting... I finally tried this today with my dad and you&#x27;re 
right, it works. Grmbl, now I&#x27;m without an explanation for how this

I&#x27;m close to sub20 (record average 18.90 but real average a bit above 
20) and I do it &quot;intuitively&quot;, too. Well, of course by now my hands 
can do the algs by themselves but I know what you mean, my eyes still 
follow the current pair instead of the next, quite a bad habit which I 
have to get rid of. I&#x27;m currently switching from cross at bottom to 
cross at left and I believe a side effect of this is that I have to 
&quot;learn&quot; the algs from a different angle now and I have a slight 
feeling I&#x27;m doing it more mechanically now, letting my hands do the 
job and not look after the current pair that much. But I still have to 
work a lot on myself...

Good luck quitting the habit!

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sub-20 yet, but my best averages are just over 21.  I&#x27;ve never
learned an alg for the F2L (one that&#x27;s i&#x27;ve remembered and still use,
at least).  Even doing things this way, I still get fairly frequent
sub-20 times.

The trick is learning to look ahead.  Not only do you need to pace
yourself and train yourself to look over the cube quickly, but you
also need to learn to single out and pair up pieces quickly.  I&#x27;ve
found it to be very helpful to follow the LL edges, because they help
you single out the remaining middle layer edges without allowing your
attention to fixate on a single piece as easily.  You really don&#x27;t
even need to see them; usually peripherally noticing the piece you
need is oriented correctly (by opposite color up if paired+inserted
simultaneously, or same color if paired up, then inserted)is plenty. 
Chris Hardwick made several good posts about this a while back.

I believe the F2L should be learned intuitively first, because it
gives you a greater understanding of the cube which allows for more
optimization, and you&#x27;ll never get amnesia.Afterward, I think learning
optimized for speed algs is a better approach.  You should shop around
for algs on various pages, but I especially recommend Nate Christie&#x27;s
page.

get the 12th.  That... was scary.

&gt; I was wondering how can I go about doing the same type of analysis<br>
&gt; for solving the first two opposite centers of a 4x4x4?<br>
&gt; I&#x27;d like to know the maximum number of moves it takes to solve two <br>
&gt; opposite centers (I don&#x27;t care about any other pieces), and also<br>
&gt; maybe an average # too.<br>
<br>
I have run it through my own solver, and here are the results.<br>
<br>
First of all, solving 2 particular opposite colours on the 4x4x4 <br>
cube, and placing them on any 2 opposite faces.<br>
<br>
depth 0, positions 6, total 6<br>
depth 1, positions 36, total 42<br>
depth 2, positions 624, total 666<br>
depth 3, positions 10290, total 10956<br>
depth 4, positions 136338, total 147294<br>
depth 5, positions 1362756, total 1510050<br>
depth 6, positions 9517212, total 11027262<br>
depth 7, positions 28400748, total 39428010<br>
depth 8, positions 12030624, total 51458634<br>
depth 9, positions 24336, total 51482970<br>
<br>
Note that there are 6 solutions to this problem since there are 6 <br>
faces where the first colour is allowed to end up (the second colour <br>
must then end up on the opposite face).<br>
The above assumes that you have two particular colours you want to <br>
solve first. You may be able to shave a few moves off on average if <br>
you can choose a different pair of colours when one pair is too <br>
difficult.<br>
BTW, I am using single slice q+h metric.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suppose that 2 opposite centres are solved. Without disturbing these <br>
you can solve the other 4 centres. The results are:<br>
<br>
depth 0, positions 4, total 4<br>
depth 1, positions 12, total 16<br>
depth 2, positions 144, total 160<br>
depth 3, positions 1044, total 1204<br>
depth 4, positions 6476, total 7680<br>
depth 5, positions 44320, total 52000<br>
depth 6, positions 253624, total 305624<br>
depth 7, positions 1372656, total 1678280<br>
depth 8, positions 6066480, total 7744760<br>
depth 9, positions 18121248, total 25866008<br>
depth 10, positions 26745272, total 52611280<br>
depth 11, positions 10149368, total 62760648<br>
depth 12, positions 302288, total 63062936<br>
depth 13, positions 64, total 63063000<br>
<br>
Note that this time there are 4 solutions, depending on which colour <br>
you have on the front. It may in some cases be possible to shorten a <br>
solution by temporarily disturbing the two already solved centres.<br>
<br>
Put together, the above shows that the centres of a 4x4x4 can always <br>
be solved in at most 22 moves.<br>

Is pressure on the pads needed, or do the &quot;switches&quot; use a capacitance 
effect, like the buttons you sometimes see in lifts?  I don&#x27;t have a 
stackmat to play with.

lol - that&#x27;s what I used to think. ;) Perhaps I&#x27;m doing the wrong kind 
of practice, but my F2L has been stuck at ~25s for many months.

          <div class="email-content">This is directed in general to everyone, but this post made me think
of it.

I wonder if the line between using algs and solving intuitively for
F2L is somewhat blurry?

I learned all the F2L algs first before I understood what they did. 
At first I would just apply the required algorithm to the required
situation.  Then over time I learned what each alg did, and now can
fully explain how my F2L algs pair up/place/preserve the rest of F2L etc..

I would definitely consider my F2L solving intuitive though, as I
don&#x27;t think &quot;hey that&#x27;s the case where the corner and edge are
separated in the LL and the first layer color of the corner is
perpendicular to the edge&quot; I just think, &quot;hey the pieces look like
this and I could pair them if I did the moves XXXXXX&quot;.

I would consider that intutive, but then again I didn&#x27;t learn the F2L
in an intuitive way.

However, even when solving with Fridrich I will sometimes use a ZBF2L
alg on a corner/edge pair because I know that my regular alg will
leave me with all incorrectly flipped edges (or for the 3rd pair lots
of incorrectly flipped edges).  Also sometimes I use a ZBF2L alg
because the cube is already set up for that case and I would have to
do a setup move (waste a move basically) to set up into my intuitive
F2L alg.  I&#x27;d rather quickly solve that case than use a slower move
and understand how I solved it.

To be honest a lot of the ZBF2L algs are still &quot;algs&quot; for me, or at
least not 100% intuitive.  So I guess I would say that I use a mix of
intuitive stuff and algs, but then again I never learned the F2L
intuitively, so technically I don&#x27;t solve intuitively at all?

Sorry if this sounds like babbling, I&#x27;m up late doing homework and
found this thread waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more interesting than my homework :-D

Anyway I think maybe the line between intuitive and solving with algs
is more blurry than just you are either in camp A or camp B but not both.

Just my $0.02

Mine works perfectly with a sheet of paper on the pads. Even with 
three sheets.

Yeah I&#x27;ve tried that, too. Finding such a metal object I mean ;-). 
Wasn&#x27;t successful...

Hey Stefan,

When I was at the photo page I selected the URL and copied it, then
when writing the post I simply pasted it. The URL never sat in a word
processing program. What do you do differently?

Cheers,

Hey Stefan,

The browser I&#x27;m using is the Mozilla which comes with Compuserve.
Other than that no program. It probably helps that I have Yahoo email.

I copied and pasted what you posted first and it worked just fine. Did
the second try work?

I see you won that used Deluxe cube yesterday. Cool. Is that your
first regular Deluxe (as opposed to the Rubik&#x27;s Game version)?
Cheers,

David J

Yes, I noticed afterwards that there were actually 10 people competing. :-)

Hi David,

oh, ok, so you&#x27;re using emails, not the web interface. No, both 
attempts broke the link into four lines and turned only the first  
line into a link, thereby killing it.

Yeah, I&#x27;m happy about that one :-). No, it&#x27;s not my first Deluxe, I 
got another one in a trade with a fellow cuber recently.

I don&#x27;t pretend to be a meteorologist, but I&#x27;m fairly certain November
is out of Hurricane season.  You should probably attempt to learn more
about it, though.  I suggest Google.

2) How many puzzles in your entire collection?  (Feel free to give

As for me...
1) After losing all my cubes in one day, I sort of went haywire.  I now 
have nine cubes:
3 Ideal (1 re-stickered white-opp-yellow)
4 25thA (1 re-stickered white-opp-blue)
1 Hasbro c.2002 - barely turns even w/silicone
1 keychain with very &#x27;peely&#x27; stickers

2) Nine! :)  As you can see I have quite a bit more collecting to do....

No. I use the web interface, not emails, but Yahoo automatically links

Kills it as a link to click on, but not to copy and paste.

I&#x27;ve got the option of eliminating LL in my method, too. Once I have a
better handle on solving the last 4 corners I can do more work on the
last 5. How far along are you in eliminating LL?

   I developed a version of Gilles method on my own for solving the
4x4x4. His last step are options in my method, but I don&#x27;t use them
that much.

I do this too, but I haven&#x27;t solved all the cases yet. And getting
what&#x27;s in my head onto paper so I can relate to it and organise it
better seems ridiculously hard.

Starting with 4 corners is an option in my method. The cross comprises
my 4th and 5th steps.

Interesting. I had no idea how others solved the cube when I put my

I&#x27;m in the middle of trying to accurately count up how many algs in

that&#x27;s 10, but I&#x27;m sure I have more I can&#x27;t think of right now...yeah.
 maybe I&#x27;ll go count and come back with a more accurate figure.

I have to haul them all out pretty soon to update the family photo.

I have all the algorithms for the complete method - its just that I havent 
learned them all yet!  Once I&#x27;m comfortable and faster with the 35 I use now 
that eliminate OLL I&#x27;ll move along and learn the last 20 which will get rid 
of PLL.  The moves and method are all on my (badly written!) website
http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/cubertscubicle

Don&#x27;t know your method so I don&#x27;t know whether any of these algorithms would 
help.

1) no. of cubes - 3
rubik&#x27;s studio
rubiks.com cube
and a very bad local cube, which is a good exercise for the forearms
while cubing :)

No other puzzle yet, but i want to add the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 to the list.

          <div class="email-content">well, I&#x27;ll give it a go:<br>
<br>
1) I&#x27;m guessing 12:<br>
  1 in my backpack<br>
  1 in my car<br>
  1 in girlfriend&#x27;s car<br>
  3 on my desk atm<br>
  1 sealed ideal cube<br>
  3 retired cubes<br>
  2 sealed 25th anniversary (one in hexagonal package, one in blister<br>
pack with silver instead of white)<br>
<br>
  If you include sticker variations and different sizes throw in:<br>
  1 giant cube<br>
  1 wooden tiled cube<br>
  5 keychain cubes (1 sealed)<br>
  1 necklace cube<br>
  1 itty bitty quarter machine cube<br>
  1 Rubik&#x27;s Game cube<br>
  for a total of 22 3x3&#x27;s<br>
<br>
2) Oh boy... Umm... I count roughly 90 individual puzzles<br>
  highlights:<br>
  4 megaminxes (megaminxi?) 1 tiled mefferts, 2 tomy, 1 hand stickered<br>
mefferts.<br>
  1 alexander&#x27;s star<br>
  3 home made puzzles (siamese cube, master cuboctehedran, keychain<br>
halftruncated cube).<br>
  9 sealed puzzles (2x2-4x4, missing link, calendar cube, darth maul<br>
head, several 3x3&#x27;s)<br>
  8 assembly puzzles (boring IMHO)<br>
<br>
E-bay is a dangerous thing.  The only things I&#x27;m REALLY gunning for<br>
are a sealed tomy megaminx and a hungarian supernova (and of course an<br>
IQ puzzle, shaped like a megaminx but white plastic, but I&#x27;ve only<br>
ever seen 1 picture of one).  And of course as soon as<br>
www.olympicubes.com comes up with their 6x6x6 for sale, I&#x27;ll jump on<br>
that too.<br>

Nope. I actually had two solves in that tournament that were incredibly
close to the penalty, but not. I&#x27;m just lucky :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey chris i want to thank you. After seeing ur fluent solve, i said to
myself i can also solve at that speed. so i did a solve going slowly
and got a very fast time. So i decided to take a avg with the new
method of going slow. here are my times   36.17  	44  	47.78  	37.81 
	39.21  	37.85  	38.62  	39.76  (50.90)  (34.39) 37.64  	43.56

Avg 40.23 seconds! my personal best.

This time too till the last solve my avg was 39.57 seconds. So all i
had to do to get my first sub40 avg was to make a solve faster than 40
secs. but again it got on my nerves and i messed up at the last :(

Anyway i now understand why ppl keep telling to go slow. Till now i
hadent understood, bt after seeing the vid, i had my enlightenment :)

Happy (slow)cubing!
Sachin.

What I remember the most when I met with Ron over a year ago is how slow he
moved. It amazed me that he could achieve such great times by moving so
slowly. I move much slower than a lot of people when I solve because of that
day with Ron. I was just starting when I met him and he had a lot of
influence on me.

Thanks Ron ;)

winter will be closer in November the sea temperature will decrease, 
and the possibility for a hurricane will also decrease.

I&#x27;m not 100% sure but the video makes me think you were also lucky 
that noone remembered the rule &quot;The timer must be stopped with both 
hands flat, palms down and the fingers touching the timer sensors, and 
without touching the puzzle.&quot;, particularly the last part.

I&#x27;m not complaining, just warning. Maybe at RWC they&#x27;ll look closer...

Cheers!

Hmm, why? Because you can easily spend a lot of money? Or did you have 
bad experiences with people there?

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think laptop touchpads work the same as stackmat pads.

1. Laptop touchpads are motion sensitive (so that you can drive the
mouse pointer).
2. There is no electricity running through your body when you use a
laptop touchpad.
(I think the reason that makes that you can only use your fingers is
that the touch pads are heat sensitive too, but I&#x27;m not sure about
that).

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Not all solvers can do that cleverly. The program/solver 
additionally needs to be able to &quot;ignore&quot; edges. One program which 
can do that is ACube which u can get from here :

http://software.rubikscube.info/JACube/index.html

Read the instructions how to do this. (And how to use it in general.)
Many use this program to come up with suitable OLL or PLL algs etc.

Have fun!

Well, Frank and I had talked about it before.  In every competition, 
you need someone sitting out and acting as the main judge running 
everything and Frank&#x27;s main thing are the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 events so he 
said he would be fine with sitting out.  For the other events, Chris 
Hunt did not compete and he ran everything.

But take this as a lesson.  Don&#x27;t take opiates.

  Hopefully there isn&#x27;t any long lasting damage from anything though.  
This year has really been crazy.  But as I said, if someone needs a

if the hole were filled and smoothed out, and the stickers made <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine,

I was going by the photos on your site. I didn&#x27;t see the video. CNN
has a video archive, but no visible way to search it! :( 

I see you have good consistancy in your solves. :) I have days where
I&#x27;m 5 seconds slower than average, and days when I&#x27;m 5 seconds faster
than average.

I think that maybe we should allow another way of taking averages. At
a tournament we sit around, talking and scrambling and solving, and
then we go up and try to solve really fast, then we sit around talking
and scrambling and solving some more before the next solve. 
We don&#x27;t do this at home and I think we should. What we do at home
does *not* reflect what we do in tournaments and I think that we
should allow coffee breaks between attempts at home.

Anyway keep up the good work!

David J

          <div class="email-content">Maybe you could cover the hole with a new sticker if say, Cubesmith
sold them, I&#x27;d have to get a set. I doubt it would be worth his time
to bother with keychain stickers though. Maybe keychain cube could be
a separate category, with keychain attached.

If you want to remove stubborn stickers, &quot;Goo Gone&quot; works extremely
well. It turns the paper/sticker into like jelly that wipes off easily
just make sure to peel the clear sticker layer off first.

good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Yay!  I&#x27;m happy to finally be able to say that I know all the ZBLL<br>
algs for the T-orientation! (do R&#x27; F R B&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R B from oriented LL)<br>
<br>
Dan Harris has already done this also, and I am just happy to say that<br>
I am among those who have done it :-D<br>
<br>
It took me 5 months roughly to learn all the algs.  I think this could<br>
be done faster if someone had several hours a day every day to learn,<br>
but I think 72 algs in 5 months is not too bad, that works out to<br>
about 2 days per alg.<br>
<br>
493 algs minus the 72 and the 21 for PLL makes 400 so in about 800<br>
days I can be finished with ZBLL.  That works out to about 3 years to<br>
learn it total.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve extended my goal to learn the method to 3 years now, and I&#x27;m<br>
still excited as ever about finally knowing it!<br>
<br>
My 1 look LL percentage now is 25.72% which is over 1/4!!<br>

This method is awesome!  On to the U-orientation next!<br>

makes you feel better about yourself when you can actually do it that

          <div class="email-content">I didn&#x27;t learn F2L intuitively at first.  I tried to, but I just<br>
couldn&#x27;t understood how the algs worked at first.  So I printed out<br>
Macky&#x27;s and Katsu&#x27;s F2L algs and each day would learn a few of them. <br>
I would only practice doing F2L in pairs, I wouldn&#x27;t do first layer<br>
corners then middle layer edges like I was doing before.  This was<br>
really frustrating at first because since you only know a few cases<br>
you have to convert everything into what you know, but it&#x27;s good to do<br>
this because it takes some practice to get used to looking for pairs<br>
and not just single pieces.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my advice to you is don&#x27;t worry about learning F2L<br>
intuitively, just print out a list or two of F2L algs and learn two or<br>
three each day.  They&#x27;re all pretty similar so learning the algs<br>
shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.  Then just practice the algs you know by<br>
converting the pair on the cube into a case you&#x27;ve learned.  After a<br>
while, the algs will just &quot;click&quot; and you probably won&#x27;t even have<br>
finish going through the list.  The intuition will come after you&#x27;ve<br>
learned some algs and have practiced with them.<br>
<br>
Now, I do a mix of both intuition and alg recognition to solve the<br>
cube.  My best average is 17.52, and my average average is about<br>
18.5.  <br>

Hope this helps.<br>

okay, i guess learning it intuitively isnt easy. but when learning, at
least try to understand what happens. it makes it easier, and you dont
have to even learn all the algs because you will automatically see it
after a while. regardless, its your choice, as long as you dont peel
the stickers off or break the cube... or anything like that.

Mr. ANYONE left ANYTOWN by car to attend a wedding at ANYCITY. He had been driving for exactly two hours when the car got punctured. He took his driver ANYBODY 10 minutes to change the wheel. In order to play safe they covered the remaining distance at a speed of 30 mph. Consequently, Mr. ANYONE was at the wedding half an hour behind schedule.<br>

A large water tank has two inlet pipes (a large one and a small one) and one outlet pipe. It takes 1 hour to fill the tank with the large inlet pipe. On the other hand, it takes 4 hours to fill the tank with the small inlet pipe. The outlet pipe allows the full tank to be emptied in 5 hours. <br>

Mr. Juari offers to play a card game with Mr. Sharabi using a normal deck of 52 cards. The rules of the game are that they will turn over two cards at a time. If the cards are both black, they go into Mr. Juaris pile. If they are both red, they go into Mr. Sharabis pile. If there is one red and one black, they go into the discard pile. They repeat the two cards flipping until they have gone through all 52 cards. <br>

A number is called a palindrome when it is equal to the number you get when all its digits are reversed. For example, 1551 is a palindrome. <br>
<br>
We discovered a curious thing. We took the number 461, reversed the digits, giving the number 164, and calculated the sum of these two numbers: <br>
<br>
       461<br>
<br>
       164 +<br>
<br>
     -------<br>
<br>
       625<br>
<br>
We repeated the process of reversing the digits and calculating the sum two more times: <br>
<br>
       625<br>
<br>
       526 +<br>
<br>
     -------<br>

<br>
      1511 +<br>
<br>
     -------<br>
<br>
      2662<br>
<br>
To our surprise, the result 2662 was a palindrome. We decided to see if this was a pure coincidence or not. So we took another 3-digit number, reversed it, which gave a larger number, and added the two. The result was not a palindrome. <br>
<br>
We repeated the process, which resulted in another 3-digit number, which was still not a palindrome. We had to repeat the process twice more to finally arrive at a 4-digit number, which was a palindrome. <br>
The Question: What was the 3-digit number we started with the second time? <br>

Emne: [Speed cubing group] please help me solving question




hello friend&#x27;s,

can any one send me the solution of given problem if possible.Specially
last question.please try to find the solution and reply soon.As i am new
member of this group i do not know the rule and regulation of this
group.Even if this group is not related to puzzle than also try to get
the solution from your contact please .



1. 

            Find the maximum number of parts that you can get after
dividing a circle with n lines.



2. 

            Decode the following

                                    

                                      B I L L

                  +      W I L L I A M

                             M O N I C A

                 ---------------------------

                          C L I N T O N



            Assuming every alphabet represents a particular digit.



3.

Mr. ANYONE left ANYTOWN by car to attend a wedding at ANYCITY. He had
been driving for exactly two hours when the car got punctured. He took
his driver ANYBODY 10 minutes to change the wheel. In order to play safe
they covered the remaining distance at a speed of 30 mph. Consequently,
Mr. ANYONE was at the wedding half an hour behind schedule.

Had the car got the puncture 30 miles later, I would have been only 15
minutes late he told the driver. How far is the ANYCITY from ANYTOWN?



5.

Divide Rs.84 (in whole Rs. increments) into a number of bags so that I
can ask for any amount between Rs 1 and Rs 84, and you can give me the
proper amount by giving me a certain number of these bags without
opening them. What is the minimum number of bags you will require?



6.

                                                                        



A cylinder 108 cm high has a circumference of 24 cm. A string makes
exactly 6 complete turns round the cylinder while its two ends touch the
cylinder&#x27;s top and bottom. How long is the string in cm?





7.

A large water tank has two inlet pipes (a large one and a small one) and
one outlet pipe. It takes 1 hour to fill the tank with the large inlet
pipe. On the other hand, it takes 4 hours to fill the tank with the
small inlet pipe. The outlet pipe allows the full tank to be emptied in
5 hours. 

What fraction of the tank (initially empty) will be filled in 0.48 hours
if all three pipes are in operation? Give your answer to two decimal
places (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, or 0.75). 



8.

Mr. Juari offers to play a card game with Mr. Sharabi using a normal
deck of 52 cards. The rules of the game are that they will turn over two
cards at a time. If the cards are both black, they go into Mr. Juaris
pile. If they are both red, they go into Mr. Sharabis pile. If there is
one red and one black, they go into the discard pile. They repeat the
two cards flipping until they have gone through all 52 cards. 

Whoever has more cards in their pile at the end wins. If there is a tie,
Mr. Juari wins. 

What are Mr. Sharabis chances of winning this game?

10.

A number is called a palindrome when it is equal to the number you get
when all its digits are reversed. For example, 1551 is a palindrome. 

We discovered a curious thing. We took the number 461, reversed the
digits, giving the number 164, and calculated the sum of these two
numbers: 

       461

       164 +

     -------

       625

We repeated the process of reversing the digits and calculating the sum
two more times: 

       625

       526 +

     -------

      1151

      1511 +

     -------

      2662

To our surprise, the result 2662 was a palindrome. We decided to see if
this was a pure coincidence or not. So we took another 3-digit number,
reversed it, which gave a larger number, and added the two. The result
was not a palindrome. 

We repeated the process, which resulted in another 3-digit number, which
was still not a palindrome. We had to repeat the process twice more to
finally arrive at a 4-digit number, which was a palindrome. 
The Question: What was the 3-digit number we started with the second
time?

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve finished the program that gives you LL scrambles.<br>
You can find it here : http://gillesvdp.phpnet.org/LL_Scrambler/<br>
<br>
As I write these lines, there are only 50 scrambles and it<br>
automatically show 13 scrambles.<br>
I&#x27;ll add the other scrambles in the next few days.<br>
(Actually it doesn&#x27;t always show 13 scrambles, because every scramble<br>
is chosen individually. (For example : the 2nd scramble will be numer<br>
15 and the5th scramble can also be the 15th in the data base. In that<br>
case, You will only have 12 scrambles. But the probability that this<br>
happens is quite low with 1212 possibilities.)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll add new features soon such as the possibility to chose the number<br>
of srambles you want to have,...<br>
The numbers shown on the page are the same as on this page :<br>
http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/solutions_tout.html.<br>
<br>
There is one thing i wanted to ask you : should I put the &quot;Solved<br>
case&quot; scramble ?<br>
At this moment, you could have this, meaning that you&#x27;ll have an<br>
extraordinary fast LL, but it&#x27;s true that you can have it when you<br>
solve the whole cube.<br>
Do you think I should leave it or remove it ?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, your question about the &quot;solved&quot; scramble brings up a new one, I 
think. Well, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s too much work/faisible, but a nice 
idea would be to add the probabilities to each scramble, so you have for 
example more chances to get this or that scramble than that other one? 
because all LLs aren&#x27;t born equal... and you would for instance have 
more chance to get a Sune-type OLL and a T PLL than for instance a &quot;no 
edge-all corners&quot; OLL and a H PLL. Well, just a thought, and you 
probably have other stuff to do, just like me... I shouldn&#x27;t be writing 
emails... GO WORK, Franï¿½ois...

And then if someone gives the probability for each case (which I won&#x27;t
do, butif you are interested, I can always to that), I can fix that so
that cases will have their own and true probability to occur.

But first, let&#x27;s have all the cases. :p

          <div class="email-content">Hey Gilles,

I&#x27;ve been thinking about adding the probabilities to the ZBLL cases on
my page just as a &quot;why not&quot; kind of thing.

If you could use those numbers for the &quot;all edges oriented&quot; cases of
your LL program let me know and I will start adding those in to my
site immediately.

I mean that&#x27;s something I was thinking about doing anyway, but if you
could use it, then I can go ahead and start.

Let me know if you&#x27;re interested.

Chris

It&#x27;s not clear that it is really desirable for the output scrambles to 
reflect the true probabilities... you might want to get extra practice 
on those cases that occur /less/ frequently in &quot;real life&quot;.  (They 
might occur less frequently, but taken all together they are still a 
significant fraction of the total!)

Just a thought, anyway.
Mike

Well, the probability thing is a bit complicated.
Everybody has his own preference.
Note : 100 scrambles available now.

Well, what is possible is to split my LL scrambler into different LL
scramblers :
1. LL in 1 step : 1212 cases
2. ZBLL : 493 cases

I&#x27;m actually talking to Joel Heymbeek, and he&#x27;s interested in helping
you for the &quot;edges oriented-scrambler&quot; with probabilities. ;-) So
maybe you can do that you two together while i finish my all-in-1
scrambler.

I&#x27;m happy to see that people are interested in that. :-)
Gilles.

Actually there should be (4! * 3^4) * (4! * 2^4) / 12 = 62208 cases. 
And they all have the same probability so you don&#x27;t need to care about 
that.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] please help me solving question



hello friend&#x27;s,

can any one send me the solution of given problem if possible.Specially last 
question.please try to find the solution and reply soon.As i am new member 
of this group i do not know the rule and regulation of this group.Even if 
this group is not related to puzzle than also try to get the solution from 
your contact please .



1.

            Find the maximum number of parts that you can get after dividing 
a circle with n lines.



2.

            Decode the following



                                      B I L L

                  +      W I L L I A M

                             M O N I C A

                 ---------------------------

                          C L I N T O N



            Assuming every alphabet represents a particular digit.



3.

Mr. ANYONE left ANYTOWN by car to attend a wedding at ANYCITY. He had been 
driving for exactly two hours when the car got punctured. He took his driver 
ANYBODY 10 minutes to change the wheel. In order to play safe they covered 
the remaining distance at a speed of 30 mph. Consequently, Mr. ANYONE was at 
the wedding half an hour behind schedule.

&quot;Had the car got the puncture 30 miles later, I would have been only 15 
minutes late&quot; he told the driver. How far is the ANYCITY from ANYTOWN?



5.

Divide Rs.84 (in whole Rs. increments) into a number of bags so that I can 
ask for any amount between Rs 1 and Rs 84, and you can give me the proper 
amount by giving me a certain number of these bags without opening them. 
What is the minimum number of bags you will require?



6.





A cylinder 108 cm high has a circumference of 24 cm. A string makes exactly 
6 complete turns round the cylinder while its two ends touch the cylinder&#x27;s 
top and bottom. How long is the string in cm?





7.

A large water tank has two inlet pipes (a large one and a small one) and one 
outlet pipe. It takes 1 hour to fill the tank with the large inlet pipe. On 
the other hand, it takes 4 hours to fill the tank with the small inlet pipe. 
The outlet pipe allows the full tank to be emptied in 5 hours.

What fraction of the tank (initially empty) will be filled in 0.48 hours if 
all three pipes are in operation? Give your answer to two decimal places 
(e.g., 0.25, 0.5, or 0.75).



8.

Mr. Juari offers to play a card game with Mr. Sharabi using a normal deck of 
52 cards. The rules of the game are that they will turn over two cards at a 
time. If the cards are both black, they go into Mr. Juari&#x27;s pile. If they 
are both red, they go into Mr. Sharabi&#x27;s pile. If there is one red and one 
black, they go into the discard pile. They repeat the two cards flipping 
until they have gone through all 52 cards.

Whoever has more cards in their pile at the end wins. If there is a tie, Mr. 
Juari wins.

What are Mr. Sharabi&#x27;s chances of winning this game?

10.

A number is called a palindrome when it is equal to the number you get when 
all its digits are reversed. For example, 1551 is a palindrome.

We discovered a curious thing. We took the number 461, reversed the digits, 
giving the number 164, and calculated the sum of these two numbers:

       461

       164 +

     -------

       625

We repeated the process of reversing the digits and calculating the sum two 
more times:

       625

       526 +

     -------

      1151

      1511 +

     -------

      2662

To our surprise, the result 2662 was a palindrome. We decided to see if this 
was a pure coincidence or not. So we took another 3-digit number, reversed 
it, which gave a larger number, and added the two. The result was not a 
palindrome.

We repeated the process, which resulted in another 3-digit number, which was 
still not a palindrome. We had to repeat the process twice more to finally 
arrive at a 4-digit number, which was a palindrome.
The Question: What was the 3-digit number we started with the second time?

Without doing calculations, im sure that 1211 (1212) is the reduced

Correct me if im wrong. These reduced cases won&#x27;t have same

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">I get kind of bothered when people say there are only 1212 LL cases,
ESPECIALLY when they say there are 21 PLL cases and 57 OLLs.  If you
say there are 1212 LL cases, then there are 13 PLLs and 40 OLLs. 
However, since most people consider there to be 21 PLLs and 57 OLLs,
so if you use the numbers 21 and 57, please don&#x27;t say there are only
1212 LL cases.  I can&#x27;t invert algs &quot;on the fly&quot; and I especially
can&#x27;t mirror and invert algs on the fly.  If anybody here is one of
the people that can mirror and invert any algorithm without thinking
about it, let me know. :)

Hi Bob,

Depends on what you mean by &quot;without thinking about it.&quot; I usually pay
attention to what I&#x27;m doing but I can invert and mirror &quot;on the fly&quot;
as it were.

I spent some time yesterday working on an algorithm right handed, this
morning in a solve I needed the left handed mirror and I just did it.
I &quot;thought about it&quot; but it took no longer than what I had practiced
right handed. 

David J
 
PS For a long time I&#x27;ve read that there are 1211 positions, not
counting inverses and mirrors. Anyone else notice the irony that
Macky&#x27;s record is 12.11 seconds?

          <div class="email-content">Right, but if the object is to write a program that will generate
scrambles with the same probability as real life, you are making it
more complicated by reducing the 62208 cases to 1212 and then
weighting the probability of each case.  You&#x27;d then have to also do a
random symmetry/inversion/translation modification to the result to
make sure your program can generate every case.

Much simpler to pick any one of the 62208 cases at random.

Do you mind if I upload this text file to the speedcubing.com server

I could definitely get some use out of this personally, but I&#x27;d also

Thanks for the work you put into this!  I for one will get a lot of
use out of these algs.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a question about the David Allen signature finger trick.  Those<br>
of you who were at the RWC2003 remember the crazy way he did (U&#x27;R)<br>
using both of his index fingers, I&#x27;m sure.<br>
<br>
Anyway one of my potential algs for my current ZBLL case uses this<br>
trigger.<br>
<br>
The alg has to potential to be a decent alg, but I would have to be<br>
fast with the David Allen (U&#x27;R) trigger, which I&#x27;m not.<br>
<br>
I know it can be made fast obviously from watching David do it.<br>
<br>
My question is, can anyone do this trick quickly, and how long did it<br>
take you to learn it comfortably?<br>
<br>
The alg that I like for this ZBLL case is [(R&#x27;)2 U] R2 [(U&#x27;)(U&#x27;)] R&#x27;<br>
(U&#x27;R)x4 (R U2) R&#x27;<br>
<br>
I would have to do 4 itterations of the David Allen trigger.  The part<br>
of the trigger around the David Allen trick is fast, and if I can make<br>
the (U&#x27;R)x4 part fast then this would be a nice alg.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m totally new to using a finger trick like this, and am<br>
asking for help from anyone who might use that trick, or who is<br>
dextrous and that trick comes easy to you :-D<br>
<br>
Just wanted to ask, as I would like to be able to have the David Allen<br>
trick be part of my solving :-D but so far it seems like it will take<br>
a lot of work.<br>

Either orient the corners or do the centres first (then do the other one).
Permute the corners. If you have an odd permutation use the T move and move the edges 
back (or keep track of where they went).
Use 3-cycles/double transpositions to permute the edges. There&#x27;s no such thing as 
orienting the edges in a 4x4x4.

          <div class="email-content">Wow, that&#x27;s incredible! And to think that I would dare balk at learning the OLL cases. I had a quick question for you that came to mind when I was reading your post. When you say you know the algorithms, does that mean that you have them memorized, or that you can execute them at full speed? Because, when I set myself up to learn the PLL (which is a meager 21 cases), I found that memorizing an alg wasn&#x27;t too difficult, but that recalling it and then doing it at full speed took days of practice. As a result, it actually hurt my times by quite a bit to do a 3-look last layer until every single case had come up quite a bit and I became comfortable with them. 
Will this be a problem for you, or do you practice each algorithm until they&#x27;re at virtually full speed?
 
I&#x27;ll remember what you say when I memorize OLL,

Yay!  I&#x27;m happy to finally be able to say that I know all the ZBLL
algs for the T-orientation! (do R&#x27; F R B&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R B from oriented LL)

Dan Harris has already done this also, and I am just happy to say that
I am among those who have done it :-D

It took me 5 months roughly to learn all the algs.  I think this could
be done faster if someone had several hours a day every day to learn,
but I think 72 algs in 5 months is not too bad, that works out to
about 2 days per alg.

493 algs minus the 72 and the 21 for PLL makes 400 so in about 800
days I can be finished with ZBLL.  That works out to about 3 years to
learn it total.

I&#x27;ve extended my goal to learn the method to 3 years now, and I&#x27;m
still excited as ever about finally knowing it!

My 1 look LL percentage now is 25.72% which is over 1/4!!

This method is awesome!  On to the U-orientation next!

Well, I can imagine a meaningful definition for this. Call an edge 
correctly oriented if it can be solved solely be outer layer turns.

If you do this first then you can nicely treat the two groups 
independently, the setup moves will be easier. On the other hand, the 
&quot;orienting&quot; step will be hard, so not only do I consider the 
definition to be meaningful, but I also declare it as useless ;-)

Cheers!

Hmm... scramble lenghts are up to 31 moves or so... would be cool to

be gentle.  Don&#x27;t press too hard with your fingers.  My cube is badly
in need of lube (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gotten any since the Chicago
tournament), but just trying to be fluid and using quick finger
movements yielded the best times.  Also, I use my right index and
middle fingers to click the 4 R turns.  It&#x27;s really more of a pulling
motion than anything else.  This alg is not cubes that are too tight,
that&#x27;s for sure.

Thanks for the alg, Chris!  I&#x27;m definitely going to use that one from
now on.  3.7 seconds is a marked improvement from 5 or 6 between two algs.

<br>
This is just a guess, but each COLL case has 8 possible edge flips,<br>
and among those 8 flips there are 12 ways the edges can be permuted.<br>
<br>
So I would guess that each COLL case has 8*12=96 different cases<br>
instead of the ZBLL 12.<br>
<br>
So I would guess that there are 8 times as many LL algs as ZBLL algs,<br>
which would be 8*493=3944<br>

Again there are probably lots of symmetries that I am missing, but I<br>
would assume that this can function as at least a rough estimate.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jaap,

Wow that&#x27;s really interesting!  I find it particularly cool that the
number of moves to solve the centers is the same as the number (or at
least close) of moves to solve the 3x3x3.

It definitely takes me more moves to solve the centers than at worst
22, but I like your idea of breaking up the first two opposite centers
to solve the other 4 more efficiently, maybe a r2 or l2 move when the
first two centers are on U and D or something.

Anyway I want to try to figure out my average number of moves and see
how it compares.

Thanks Jaap, this analysis is really cool.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jeremy,

I&#x27;m at varying levels of comfort for each alg.  The first COLL case I
learned, all 12 of those algs I can execute and recognize at full
speed.  I can also mostly execute and recognize the 2nd COLL case I
learned at full speed.  For the 3rd and 4th I&#x27;d say for 2/3 of them I
am completely comfortable and the other 1/3 I pause.  For the 5th case
maybe 1/2 of them are full speed and the others still some delays. 
For my most recent COLL case only about 1/3 are full speed and the
others have delays.

I still have a bit of work for the last 4 cases, but I would only
delay by 2-3 seconds on a solve if one of those cases come up.  I have
all the triggers memorized for going full speed, but the recognition
is the part that kills me.  I actually practice the algs for each COLL
case to make sure I can trigger them full speed once I do recognize,
but recognition is my biggest problem.

As far as learning lots of algs, I&#x27;m thinking about posting something
on my site soon about what I do.  Basically the more categories you
can put the algs into, the easier it is to learn them.

For recognizing a ZBLL alg I have three steps 1)orientation case 2)
COLL case 3) edges case.

You can do this as COLL case, then edges instead, but I prefer to
break it up even more.

That way I have 8 groups (8 orientation cases) to start with.  After I
identify that I have 6 COLL cases (or 4 for one of the orientaitons,
or all 21 PLL algs for oriented corners).  After the 6 COLL cases I
have 12 edge cases.

So I don&#x27;t have to make a lot of decisions to recognize.  My first
choice is 1 out of 8 possibilities.  The next is 1 out of 6 (or 1 out
of 4 or 1 out of 21).  The last choice is 1 out of 12 except for PLL
cases.

If I chose to look at COLL cases then it would be 1 out of 41, then
either 1 out of 12 or 1 out of 21.

I think the COLL then edges will be faster once I have had more
practice, but for now I find the more categories I break things up
into, the easier it is to memorize.

For the OLLs I would suggest breaking them into lots of subcategories.
 For example
1) no edges oriented
2) two adjancent edges corretly oriented
3) two opposite edges correctly oriented
4) all edges oriented

So instead of 57 algs you have 4 groups, each of which contains
varying numbers of algs.

Again from what I&#x27;ve seen in general, the more categories you split
things into the easier it is to recognize them.  Don&#x27;t go overboard
and call each alg it&#x27;s own categor obviously, but try to make several
substeps and small groups.

Just my $0.02

algorithms, does that mean that you have them memorized, or that you
can execute them at full speed? Because, when I set myself up to learn
the PLL (which is a meager 21 cases), I found that memorizing an alg
wasn&#x27;t too difficult, but that recalling it and then doing it at full
speed took days of practice. As a result, it actually hurt my times by
quite a bit to do a 3-look last layer until every single case had come
up quite a bit and I became comfortable with them.

I like that alg, I haven&#x27;t timed it yet but I am still working on
getting my hands used to it to try.

I do the (R U&#x27;)x3 as (R U&#x27; R) (U&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R2) bringing the R2 afterward
into the (R U&#x27;)x3 trigger a little bit.

I think that way could be very fast, I&#x27;m going to try to work on both
and see which way I like.

I&#x27;ve managed to get the David Allen way down to abut 3.4x seconds as a
personal fastest, but I still average a lot slower than that.  I still
have problems with the David Allen trigger.

Thanks for the alg, if I can get that version to be faster than the
David Allen way, then of course I&#x27;d rather use the faster alg.

          <div class="email-content">Hey again David,

I just spent some time working with this alg done both ways, both with
the David Allen trigger and with your suggestion of (RU&#x27;)x3 instead.

So far I think both algs are very, very good - much better than some
of the ZBLL algs I use for some cases.

What I usually use to evaluate which alg I will choose is how fast I
feel that I have to go to get a good time, and which one have I done
faster.

So far my fastest with the David Allen way is 2.90 seconds, with my
second fastest at 2.91

With the (RU&#x27;)x3 my fastest is 2.98 with my second fastest somewhere
between 3.00 and 3.10.

I feel that I have to go pretty fast for the (RU&#x27;)x3 alg to get a good
solve, but for the David Allen trigger way I only feel that I have to
go smoothly (though still at a really strong pace) to get a good time.

So anyway I think both algs are good, but I will honestly probably end
up sticking with the David Allen way, both because it fits my hands a
bit better (it feels smoother to me) and also because I don&#x27;t know how
to do the David Allen trigger very well yet, and this is as good of an
excuse as any to learn.

In short I think both ways of executing are very good, probably about
the same depending on which feels better to your hands.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
It is with great pleasure that I announce that we have a new WCA <br>
board member: Mr. Masayuki Akimoto from Japan.<br>
<br>
Masayuki is the reigning world champion for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5.<br>
He was responsible for two Asian competitions (Kyoto and Tokyo) and <br>
has plans for more in the future.<br>
He has a very informative website and is always working hard to make <br>
our hobby more fun with his ideas and initiatives.<br>
<br>
There were two people who wrote a recommendation letter for Masayuki.<br>
<br>
Currently the WCA board consists of 4 members:<br>
Tyson Mao (co-founder), Americas<br>
Ron van Bruchem (co-founder), Europe<br>
Gilles Roux, Europe<br>
Masayuki Akimoto, Asia<br>
<br>
We are looking forward to 2006, with more competitions in more <br>
places and more competitors.<br>
One of our other goals for 2006 is to finalise the establishment of <br>
WCA. After that we are ready for elections for a new board.<br>
<br>
If anyone has plans for a competition, please let us know, because <br>
we may be able to help you. Especially if you are in a country where <br>
there hasn&#x27;t been a competition before.<br>
You could start with an informal small competition, just to see how <br>
it works.<br>
<br>
If you want to start a national organisation in your country, then <br>
also let us know. Currently we have 3 national organisations within <br>
WCA: in Japan, Poland and Sweden.<br>
<br>
Keep on cubing,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I agree. Optimal scrambles would be cool.  Maybe someone with
the computing resources to do so could feed these files into an
optimal solver.  I could even provide the cases in the format that
Mike Reid&#x27;s solver uses if that would help.

The file with all 62208 last layer scrambling algs is ready:

          <div class="email-content">I would definitely be interested in this, not only for myself but I
really am trying to make my site have practice options available too.

So far I can only provide pages with tips about how I practice, but I
think this scramble program would be cool.  I can talk to Ron too
about using webspace on speedcubing.com.

I would really like to promote the ZB method, and if I can help out in
any way let me know.  Send me an e-mail and we can talk more - chris
_at_ speedcubing dot com

I&#x27;ll talk to Ron in the meantime and see if we can work something out.
 If Dan can do it that would be totally awesome too.  I would just
like something like this to be available, no matter how it gets done.

If there is anything I can do to help out please let me know.

and thanks again!  This scrambler I think will help a lot!

I do have one suggestion, would there be a way to organize the algs by
1) OLL case and 2) even further by COLL case?

I know this is more work, but again I can try to help out if there is
something I can do.

It would be nice to be able to focus the scrambler only on certain
COLL cases, or even on just one OLL case (this I think would be the
most important feature).

Just some suggestions, but already this scrambling program is awesome!
 I think it is a very good practice tool for ZBLL already!

I&#x27;m a couple of days behind, so I&#x27;m just getting to this now. But, it 
seems to me that this may cause an unfair advantage to some 
competitors because the starting position will vary depending on what 
color you prefer on top. If all scrambles for a competition are to be 
done with white on top, for example, a scramble may create an 
extremely easy cross on the yellow face, but a difficult one on the 
orange face. So, obviously, someone who prefers to solve the cross on 
the yellow face will have the advantage.
The current system provides the same cross setup to each competitor 
regardless of color preference and seems to me to be more fair.

Duane

PS - I solve with red on top.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

you&#x27;re getting very close but the exact number is 3916 including the solved case. The way 
I used to caculate this figure is as follows:

There are 58 OLL cases in total including the solved case.
- 2 of them are completely symmetric (the solved case and the one with 4 edges flipped), 
meaning that they look the same from all 4 angles. For these cases 22 permutations are 
possible; which is the number of PLL&#x27;s including the trivial case.
- 5 of them are half symmetric, meaning that you can turn them 180° and get the same 
orientation. A good example is what I call the H permutation (all edges oriented, corners 
are +-+-). For those cases 40 permutations are possible.
- the 51 remaining don&#x27;t have any symmetry, meaning that they look different fro, all 4 
angles. For those cases you need to know all 72 possible permutations (6 possibilities for 
the corners x 12 possibilities for the edges).

If you add this all up, you get:

2 *22=  44
5 *40= 200
72*51=3672
__________
      3916

I&#x27;m not saying that this is the most elegant way of doing it, but it might still be useful.

Lars

you had a design that specifically associates a specific position for

I have no idea why you think this is unfair. Please explain.

It would be unfair if the organizer purposely gave me a scramble that 
for some reason he knows is &quot;hard&quot; for me and gave you a scramble that 
he knows is &quot;easy&quot; for you. But if we&#x27;re all treated equal...

Why do you only fear that someone else might have a &quot;lucky&quot; advantage 
over you? With the same probability, *you* will have the same 
advantage! Everybody has the same chances of getting &quot;lucky&quot;. Do you 
think telling the scrambler how to hold the cube has any influence on 
fairness? Do you also believe that you can gain an advantage by being 
clever and telling them the &quot;best&quot; way to hold the cube?

Cheers!
Stefan

then everyone isn&#x27;t solving the same cube. This will give some Fridrich

          <div class="email-content">Thanks everyone for the kind words.

Jason, and anyone else interested in ZB, I think that&#x27;s awesome!  I
hope you decide to learn it and I hope you enjoy it.

The method is really fun to use, and so far my average average with ZB
is pretty much the same as for Fridrich.

It feels really cool to get a ZB solve, but then again noone knows if
the recognition will be too much in the long run.

I think the method will be a good method, but I no longer make any
claims about comparing it to Fridrich since I really don&#x27;t know how it
will compare.

I just really enjoy this method, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m learning it.  If
you do start learning ZB and it just feels like work and you don&#x27;t
enjoy it, then I don&#x27;t recommend sticking with it.

The method seems intimidating at first, I definitely thought so.  But
even after a full orientation case now I really don&#x27;t feel like it is
hard to keep track of all the algs.

I honestly feel right now that with 3 years of work ZBLL could be
totally managable.  Will it be faster?  Who knows but I think it will
be fun.  Even if I never use ZB in competition again, and just only
for fun I still think it would be cool to know.

Basically I don&#x27;t think ZB is a necessary extension from Fridrich.  I
mean I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s F2L -> PLL -> OLL -> COLL -> ZB, I think it&#x27;s
just another method to learn if you want.

As far as learning all the algs, it really isn&#x27;t that bad so far. 
They are categorized into so many smaller groups and learning a group
of 12 algs really doesn&#x27;t take all that long.  So I get to celebrate
every 12 algs that I&#x27;ve accomplished a subgoal.

Anyway if anyone who is interested decides to learn it I think that
would be cool, and I&#x27;d be more than willing to provide any tips or
whatever.  Just remember, it&#x27;s just another method, noone knows if it
will be any sort of &quot;super&quot; method.  I think that will depend on the
person learning it, and not on the method.

Chris

P.S.  I did another 100 cube average counting moves instead of the
time.  I&#x27;m still working on getting the page up, but out of 100 solves
I got 26 ZBLL solves and the average number of moves for a ZB solve
was 45.43 moves.  So even if the recognition for ZBLL takes a long
time, I think the overall move count will at least balance that out. 
Anyway I&#x27;ll provide a link to the stats when I&#x27;m finished with the page.

That will help zbll learners I think. :-)

Although I&#x27;m more interested in a full LL scrambler, so I&#x27;ll continue
my scrambler.
(I think too that the possibility to choose the OLL on the zbll
scrambler would be good)

          <div class="email-content">I recently switched from Petrus to Xcross, and I learned to keep my LL
up for the entire F2L. When I Petrused, I would wander about the cube
getting disoriented. Now I keep F2L down until I start LL algs which
really seemed to help keep me from getting lost. I don&#x27;t see why it
wouldn&#x27;t work very well for the Petrus method also. You can try Dw (2
layer D turn) to move the slots if it works for you.

good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the tips, Chris.  I was planning on sending you an email
asking some questions about the ZB method, but you&#x27;ve already answered
pretty much everything I was going to ask.  ;)

I&#x27;m feeling pretty good about learning it though.  Right now I just
want to finish learning COLL (8 cases left) and get comfortable with
that before WC2005.  After that though, it will be time to start
learning ZB.  I&#x27;d like to have all of ZBF2L down by the end of the
school year (early May), then devote a lot of time over the summer to
learning ZBLL.  I&#x27;d like to have the entire method down 3 years after
I start working on it, like you.

          <div class="email-content">Well, the average Fridrich F2L pair takes 7 moves to put in.  4 x 7 =
28 moves for an &quot;average&quot; F2L (not including the cross).  Do you do
your F2L intuitively?  That might be a problem, because if you do F2L
in pairs then you&#x27;re either taking way too many moves to put them in
or you&#x27;re doing a 20 move cross.  ;)  I would suggest going through a
list of F2L algs and comparing them do the way you would do them (if
in fact you do everything intuitively).  48 moves is quite a lot for a
Fridrich F2L though.

As for how I do F2L, I only make extended crosses no more than 10% of
my solves.  I usually use open slots to minimize cube rotation.  I
know a few different angles for certain pairs.

You don&#x27;t have to solve F2L in 30 moves to be fast, though.  I average
35-38 moves for my F2L and I average 18 seconds consistently.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ben,

To be honest I don&#x27;t have any stats about my F2L number of moves, only
ZBF2L which I don&#x27;t think is relavent to what you&#x27;re asking.

Ron took a 100 cube average counting the number of moves in his solves
for all the various steps a few years back and I believe the final
number was about 32 moves on average (Ron please correct me if I am
wrong).

If I would have mentioned something about F2L and number of moves I
most likely would have quoted Ron&#x27;s average.

I can personally try to answer your question, but I am no expert on
F2L.  The only tricks I really use on a frequent basis are empty slot
corner and edge inserts (with one or two algs for empty slot inserts
for both the corner and edge) and extended cross.

In my most recent 100 cube average counting just the number of moves I
did 28 extended cross solves, one of which was a double extended
cross.  So I would guess that I do extended cross roughly 30% of the
time rather than cross, and double extended cross maybe 1% or less.

As far as empty slots, anytime an edge or corner is solved in its slot
and the other piece is in the LL, I would always use an empty slot alg
if there is an available slot.

Also, slant pairing is a very powerful tool to know.  For this you
have the corner of one slot solved and the edge of another slot
solved.  You then do a first layer turn to line up the unsolved edge
from the first slot with the unsolved corner from the second slot into
one &quot;slant&quot; F2L slot.  You then solve a corner/edge pair with the edge
from the first slot paired with the corner from the second.  Once you
do that an undo your first layer turn, you will have solved both F2L
pairs at the same time.

I would say that I average an empty slot case or extended cross or
slant pair every solve.  Meaning I would do at least one alg that is
something additional to the standard 22 non-solved Fridrich F2L cases
per solve.

If you are shooting for 11-12 second F2L times this is what I do to
get there.  If you are shooting for 10 seconds or less, I have
absolutely no clue how to do that and I am no help to you ;-)

Anyway I hope that helps some.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a question for your programmers.  Would it be hard to take an<br>
existing solver program (Ron&#x27;s solver program, ACube, etc..) and<br>
manually specify the desired final state rather than have it be<br>
assumed to be the solved state?<br>
<br>
I was looking for good transformation algs from any OLL case into the<br>
&quot;T&quot; orientation and thought that such a solver could come in handy.<br>
<br>
My method right now is just to start from the T and do the inverse of<br>
various easy and fast moves that leave the edges oriented and when I<br>
end up at an orientation I didn&#x27;t know the transformation for yet I<br>
would then know which alg I used to go from the T to that case, so I<br>
can just do the reverse.<br>
<br>
Anyway I have no idea if a program feature like that is hard to do or<br>
not, but I think it would be a cool option to have.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not really in dire need of a program like this, I was just curious<br>
if it would be hard to do or not.  Are there any others who would be<br>
interested in such a feature, or am I just weird? ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Here is the link to the stats I took for my 100 cube average for ZB. <br>
I counted only the number of moves and not the time.  I also took max<br>
30 seconds per cube (basically as fast as I could go but still<br>
accurately count how many moves I was doing).<br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbstats.html<br>
<br>
All solves were done with ZBF2L and either a COLL/PLL or ZBLL ending.<br>
<br>
Here are the highlights:<br>
<br>
- Out of 100 solves I had 26 ZBLL solves, which is right on par with<br>
my ZBLL % of about 25.7x%<br>
- ZBF2L takes me on average 32.58 moves to solve (over all 100<br>
solves), which is very comparable to Fridrich F2L.<br>
- Best solve was a double extended cross ZBLL solve at 35 moves.<br>
- worst solve was COLL / PLL finish at 63 moves.<br>
- Over 26/100 solves the average number of moves required for a ZBLL<br>
solve is 45.43 moves.<br>
- My hybrid 25%ZBLL / COLL &amp; PLL method requires 52.24 on average to<br>
solve (which I belive is roughly the same as Fridrich)<br>
<br>
Extended cross statistics<br>
- extended cross ZBF2L took 29.96 moves on average over 28/100 solves<br>
- average total number of moves for an extended cross solve was 48.32<br>
moves which is 3.92 moves shorter than my 52.24 overall average.  So<br>
an extended cross start saves (for me) 3.92 moves on the solve on average.<br>
<br>
So I think that counts as proof that extended cross is a good approach.<br>
<br>
There are more statistics on the page if you want to see more:<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbstats.html<br>
<br>
You can also compare this 100 cube average to my one from 5 months ago<br>
before I knew hardly any ZBLL algs other than the COLL algs.<br>

I do the same, but with more variation -- typically 30-40, including 
the cross.  But not much thought used.  ;)

I remember you quoting 52 moves for Fridrich before in a post but I&#x27;m pretty 
sure that basic Fridrich is more like 57-58.
Any views?

Paul Revere did light the lanterns, but it is not sure if he did 
infact shout &quot;the british are coming&quot;. There is some common sense to 
show he didnt. There were already british in town, and by waking all 
the colonists up, he would wake up the british too. This would not 
help him complete his goal, so it is unsure if he did actually shout 
that. (i personally think not)

Just a little fact. Still, believe what you want!

Since I never learned F2L intuitively I like to give out algs for
cases like this if someone is looking.  If you would rather solve
intuitively then don&#x27;t read this message, as it is a spoiler.

Ok, so if you have the case you linked to
http://speedcubing.com/images/c1e2_b21_cl.gif

but the pieces are in the wrong slot, here is what you do.

The pieces will always be in FR, but they will belong in various other
slots.

Pieces in FR but belong in BR: U R&#x27; F R F&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R
Pieces in FR but belong in FL: U&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R F U F&#x27;
Pieces in FR but belong in BL: U2 L2 D F2 D&#x27; L2

Those algs will preserve the other two F2L pairs.  It only affects the
going from and going to pairs.

I personally use those algs quite frequently, and I find that they
help make the case you describe not quite so bad.

          <div class="email-content">About ten months ago I made a few runs  (a few hundred thousand  :) ) 
with ACube, compairing optimal solutions to different first step 
strategies. Later down this message is two of those calculations. 10,000 
scrambles were generated by distributing pieces of interest randomly. 
Then all of them were solved optimally for the X-Cross. Both of the 
calculations assume that the same color for the first step is always 
used. The difference is that in one case the additional F2L-pair (in 
addition to the cross) was always the same and in the other case the 
shortest solution to any pair was chosen. I hope yahoo doesn&#x27;t mess up 
the layout too much:


Number of moves needed to do the X-Cross, including alignment with centers

Moves    Positions    Percent
4:    11        0.11%
5:    120        1.2%
6:    935        9.35%
7:    4395        43.95%
8:    4383        43.83%
9:    156        1.56%

Positions solved:    10000
Average nr of moves:    7.3487


Number of moves needed to do the X-Cross, including alignment with 
centers and always choosing the same pair

Moves    Positions    Percent
4:    3        0.03%
5:    34        0.34%
6:    260        2.6%
7:    1882        18.82%
8:    5584        55.84%
9:    2233        22.33%
10:    4        0.04%

Positions solved:    10000
Average nr of moves:    7.9725


So... if you can do it optimally you can form the X-Cross under 8 moves 
average. Wouldn&#x27;t that be nice :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey again Ben,<br>
<br>
Here is the page where I learned about mis-matched pairs (slant-pairing).<br>
<br>
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/angela.hayden/cube/speed4.html<br>
<br>
It is from stiff hands&#x27; site (I believe his name is Olly, but someone<br>
correct me if I am wrong).<br>
<br>
He provides a few examples to give you the idea, but I recommend<br>
looking more into it on your own.  This method is VERY powerful when<br>
it comes up.  If I get a slant pairing case for the 3rd and 4th corner<br>
edge pair in my speed solving I would do a slant pair + ZBF2L alg.  So<br>
this would effectively solve the 3rd and 4th edge pairs and orient the<br>
LL edges in one step.  Slant pairing can do wonders for your solve. <br>
it doesn&#x27;t come up very frequently, but when it does it helps so much.<br>
<br>
As far as F2L algs go, I can try to make a page with some of my empty<br>
slot algs if there would be some interest.  I mean I don&#x27;t know a huge<br>
number of empty slot cases, just the odd few cases that I got tired of<br>
seeing and either figured out an alg for, or had ACube or Ron&#x27;s solver<br>
analyze.<br>
<br>
Again, I only average 11-12 seconds for F2L, so compared to someone<br>
like Sebastien my advice probably has some inherent flaws keeping me<br>
from sub-10 times, which I would unwittingly pass to you.<br>
<br>
If there would be interest in some empty slot algs I will of course<br>
post them on my site, but as far as F2L goes I&#x27;m not even in the same<br>
league as the people in the unofficial top ten who use Fridrich.<br>
<br>
I mean here are a few examples of other empty slot algs that I use<br>
freqently.  If people would like visuals to go with them just send me<br>
an e-mail.<br>
<br>
I want to help out if people feel that there aren&#x27;t enough resources<br>
for empty slot algs, but I don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel if there<br>
are already good sites out there.<br>
<br>
Other algs I like a lot (do the inverse to setup the case).  Each of<br>
these 4 algs solves the FL pair.  So if you do the inverse of one of<br>
these algs to setup the case just make sure the FL pair is solved<br>
before you start.<br>
<br>
All four algs are for when the corner is solved, and the edge is in<br>
the F2L in the wrong slot somewhere:<br>
<br>
Corner in FL, edge in BR:<br>
1) R&#x27; U R&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; D R2 (edge flipped)<br>
2) R2 D&#x27; F2 D R2 (edge correct)<br>
I actually figured out both of these algs on my own just sitting down<br>
and doing the same case over and over until I found a fast way to do<br>
it.  These algs preserve FR and BL.<br>
<br>
corner in FL edge in FR (reflect these algs if the edge is in BL)<br>
1) F2 U&#x27; F2 U F2 (edge correct)<br>
2) R&#x27; D&#x27; F D R (edge flipped)<br>
I figured out #1 on my own and Heath Litton taught me the 2nd one<br>
about 2 years ago.  These algs preserve BR and BL.<br>
<br>
I mean the algs I would put on my site would be algs like this.  Again<br>
I don&#x27;t have a huge number, but if people would be interested I can<br>
post the ones I use.<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
&gt; And Chris, Thank you for all your useful information.  I don&#x27;t want <br>
&gt; to seem demanding, but you should consider posting your F2L <br>
&gt; algorithms (like the ones on your last message) on your site.  And <br>
&gt; maybe your description of slant pairing, if you felt like it.I think <br>
&gt; they would be of great benefit to lots of cubers.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey, Ben, I think there are some miscalculations...
You took an average from middle 10, correct?
If yes, your Cross average is 7.2, your 1st pair is 7.8, 2nd pair is 9.8, 3rd is 7.6, 4th is 7.9, Pairs is 31.4, F2L is 38.8, (oh, your solve #9 was 38, not 28 moves...), OLL is 9.9, PLL is 13.1, LL is 22.6, and Total is 61.5. But if your average was not that way, please forget this...Oh, another thing: how did you get this x.xx numbers? It might be just .x...or no?
 
Ah, and here are my stats...(I hope there&#x27;s nothing wrong...)

Well, I don&#x27;t know all OLL, so that with 12 or more are 2 or 3 look OLL
and the 18 was a double-extended cross and the 10 was an extended cross.

          <div class="email-content">Here are my stats as well.

I did standard Fridrich on every solve, nothing ZB for either F2L or LL.

I hope the format comes out alright.

------1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8--9--10-11-12---Avg
Cross_7__7__7__8__8__5__7__5__6__9__7__4____6.7
1st___8__5__6__-__-__7__5__7__5__-__8__3____5.4

2nd___6__6__7__4__6__7__7__6__3__7__7__5____5.9
3rd___8__7__7__7__8__8__4__8__6__7__6__5____6.8

4th___8__7__8__8__7__8__8__8__8__7__8__7____7.7
Pairs_30_25_28_19_21_30_24_29_22_21_29_20___24.8

F2L___37_32_35_27_29_35_31_34_28_30_36_24___31.5
OLL___10_11_9__12_8__11_10_8__10_7__9__9____9.5

PLL___12_12_10_13_16_10_14_10_13_15_9__14___12.3
LL____22_23_19_25_24_21_24_18_23_22_18_23___21.8

Total_59_55_54_52_53_56_55_52_51_52_54_47___53.3

For each average I took it over all 12 cubes.  I figure since there
aren&#x27;t many solves I would use all the available data for the average.

I counted extended cross solves as a long cross that skips the 1st
pair.  So for an extended cross solve I averaged the 1st pair as a 0
move solve.  That is why the 1st pair number is so low.

Again this average was without using any ZB techniques, pure Fridrich.
 The last solve, the 47 move one, had an easy cross and the 2nd and
third pairs were both empty slot cases.

Hope this help some,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">I have never practiced team BLD, but I guess the main point is the
recognition and the communication. So you should have codes for a
bunch of different cases (F2L, OLL &amp; PLL or for other methods). But I
think you already have that so I feel like the only thing is
recognition...

<br>
If u guys ever get bored of cubing and u thought that minesweeping was <br>
pretty cool too. Then u should check out the cool 3D sweeping game:<br>
<br>
http://web.aanet.com.au/robertw/Mines3D/download.html<br>
<br>
I have only tried the free demo version and it is very cool. Im not <br>
sure it has the charm of the original though ;-)<br>
<br>
I always liked 2D computer games over 3D games anyway ... lol ... Many <br>
3D games seem to be made only to impress or to kill time (fps games). <br>
2D board games with simple rules and advanced strategy are much more <br>
appealing to me. Many old classics are hard to get to work in later <br>
window versions. For that, DosBox is a cool utility program through <br>
which i have played many old favorites (notrus (best tetris), <br>
lemmings, epic pinball, brix, heartlight, sam and max ... ). <br>
<br>
http://dosbox.sourceforge.net<br>

Have fun!<br>

I live in North Jersey.  I&#x27;m less than an hour away from the city (by

What&#x27;s special about &quot;notrus&quot;?

I (of course) claim the best tetris is my own &quot;3D-Tris&quot;, the only real 
3D Tetris I&#x27;ve seen so far. Here&#x27;s a screenshot:

How do you like that? To prove that you can see it, tell me which 
stone is already lying on the floor, which is on top of the board, and 
which comes in next ;-)

You mistake beautiful and sexy. Best stickers might make a cube look 
beautiful, but sexyness depends on how it feels when I play with it.

I bought the full version of minesweeper 3d a while back, worth it in
my oppinion.  The sound effects are fantastic =P .

That 3d-tris pic is pretty cool too!  1x4 block laying flat on ground,
2x2 block in the air, and z shaped block comes next ;).

the weird 2x2 block with the top 2x1 shifted one to the left (I&#x27;m not
a tetris player as you might have guess :-)

Again I&#x27;ve never really been a tetris player, but I am a huge fan of
Stereograms!

Seriously, can I get a copy of that program?

I never could see such things. And it&#x27;s not interesting when it&#x27;s 
hard to see it either :-P

Obviously u never played notrus. The object is not simply to keep 
everything down. The object is to make sure to collect bonus-lines 
by removing quadruple lines at the same time. These bonus-lines will 
be removed from bottom of playing field when u are otherwise dead 
(hit the roof). This makes it much much more fun to play. So u need 
different skills than plain-vanilla tetris. 3D fancy stuff adds 
nothing to the playability of the game. Unless u really have a 3D 
playing field or something like in blockout. 

That&#x27;s just my personal opinion. Im sure it was great fun to code ur 
3D-tris though :-)

Regards,

Per

PS! Anyone recalls the name of another old cool tetris-clone. The 
polyminoes came sliding down the walls in a pseudo-3d box sorta. And 
u could reduce the field (at bottom of the box) by making vertical 
or horisontal lines. It was russian i think. With some ice-skating 
artwork that was really cool :-)

I don&#x27;t quite agree. I would judge a cube sexy or not without trying 
it out. Just like i could judge a girl sexy or not without trying her 
out. Lol :-P

Maybe i actually confused sexy and charming? But that looks so dull on

If you want to get fast, indeed you need a speedcube.
But a speedcube is nothing but a cube with some lubes and months of use.
For the lube, it&#x27;s often recommended to use a sylycon spray. (you can
find more details on several websites).

And you of course need a good method. There are several methods that
can help you to get under the minute. As for example : Roux, Fridrich,
Waterman, Guimond, Petrus,...

You should look at the principles of those methods and then choose the
one you like :)

Good luck,
Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Eric, 

I&#x27;ll throw in my 2 cents worth.  My average time is about 40 seconds 
now and best is 28.5, and my times continue to drop steadily.  I 
routinely get solves in the mid 30s.  I&#x27;ve been swtiching over from 
my old clunky self-taught method to Fridrich, starting in about 
January.  I run my own wealth management firm and have four kids, so 
I don&#x27;t have quite as much free time as a lot of the cubers out 
there, so you can view my progress as one example of what&#x27;s possible 
with some practice and effort, but not an insane amount of 
dedication.

First, get some silicone spray.  I use Prestone high viscosity 
silicone spray in a yellow can from Wal-Mart.  Best to avoid 
petroleum based products.  I take the cube apart, spray it down, let 
it sit overnight, then cube away.  there&#x27;s a way you can lay the 
pieces to minimize the spray getting on the stickers, or you can 
just wipe it off, or frankly don&#x27;t even worry about that too much 
because you&#x27;ll be buying replacement stickers soon anyway [most 
likely from cubesmith.com].

Second, although there&#x27;s been a lot of talk here lately about the 
First 2 Layers [F2L], it may be more fun to learn some of the PLL 
algs first [permute last layer].  For me, learning those was fun in 
addition to cutting my time.  There are tons of sites with vidoes 
and algs.  I&#x27;m still working through the OLL algs.  My immediate 
goal is to have one alg for each OLL and PLL case, then work on 
getting faster at each case.  If you&#x27;re fast, doing the Orientation 
stage in 2 steps--orient corners then edges [or edges then corners]--
is probably almost as good as trying to learn all the OLL algs.

And yes I&#x27;d spend some time working on F2L also; cutting down the 
time for that step is critical to improving your overall times no 
matter how fast you are.  learn just a couple of those algs where 
the corner and edge are paired up on the LL and then inserted and 
you should see dramatic improvements over your self-taught F2L 
method.  Those are probably easier or more intuitive than many of 
the PLL algs, and even if you don&#x27;t get the exact case you know, you 
can manipulate it rather easily to get that case.

Finally, getting together with other cubers has been a huge help to 
me.  I just learn better from watching it done in person.

Good luck and happy cubing!

Yeah, I like them, too. I still have a dozen books, half a dozen 
posters and probably some floppy disks with my old programs that I 
wrote for generating them.

I became quite good, I see them almost immediately so I can just flip 
through a book and see the images. Or tilt the images a bit. Or let 
you wave your hand in front of the picture. Or actually let my eyes 
*diverge* (i.e. further than parallel) because some pictures had very 
wide repeating patterns so I wanted to know whether it&#x27;s possible. Oh, 
those were fun days...

> Seriously, can I get a copy of that program?

Sure.

Download http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/3dtris.zip
Unzip it.
Start 3d-tris.com
Watch intro, then press some key to continue.
Enter initial speed level 0-9.
Play.

Play with arrow keys. Pause with space bar. Turn grid on/off with g. 
Turn background on/off with b. Choose design with 1-4. Check out 
design 3 :-)

It&#x27;s 11 years old, though, and it doesn&#x27;t work well on my laptop. If 
it doesn&#x27;t work well for you, try it on a desktop pc, preferably an 
old one.

Let me know whether it works for you and how you like it :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

That&#x27;s one reason I liked it so much: because others couldn&#x27;t see it ;

Well, don&#x27;t know what plain-vanilla tetris is like. I remember Game 
Boy Tetris also awarded removing quadruple lines. When playing against 
someone and you remove 1,2,3,4 lines at once then your opponent will 
get 0,1,2,4 lines shifted in at the bottom. Also, 4 lines at once 
gives much more points then the same number of lines in several steps 
(and not only in the Game Boy version). And since it gets faster the 
more lines you remove, you&#x27;d better try removing 4 at once if you want 
to get decent high scores.

Can you play notrus against someone or only alone? No tetris version 
that you can only play alone can be the #1 version ;-). I like xtris 
best, I&#x27;ve sometimes played against 20 people at once. It also offers 
bots, computer-controlled opponents.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi and congratulations on figuring out the cube yourself!  That&#x27;s an 
amazing accomplishment.

Now, about getting faster.  I don&#x27;t know how sound my advice is, but 
the #1 thing that comes to my mind is: START OVER!!  What I mean by 
that is, by now you have probably learned some &#x27;habits&#x27; that are not 
conducive to speedcubing.  If so, you will have to get rid of those 
habits ASAP if you want to get super-fast.

>From my own experience, I learned using the James Nourse method.  You 
start by solving the top side, then the middle layer, then the bottom 
layer.  Completely WRONG!  For speed, solving top-to-bottom is 
nonsensical.  You can&#x27;t see anything when it&#x27;s on the bottom unless 
you happen to be solving with the cube above your head.  So learn to 
solve bottom-to-top.

Also, you may have already developed twisting habits that are hard to 
break.  For maximum speed, you need to learn what many people 
call &#x27;triggers&#x27; - ways of combining several moves into a very quick 
motion.  For example, R U R&#x27; (right face clockwise, up face 
clockwise, right face counterclockwise) can be accomplished with one 
hand in a fraction of a second, provided you have a well-siliconed 
cube.

I myself am in the midst of a complete re-vamp of what I know, and 
let me tell you, right now my times are CRUMMY.  But I know that in 
the long run - probably extra-long for me because I learn slow - I&#x27;ll 
be better off, than letting my old bad habits stay with me.  Sort of 
like Tiger Woods re-adjusting his swing.  Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">sweet, i have a friend who lives in ft wayne who knows how to do the
cube. though he&#x27;s admittedly not very fast or into speedcubing :-/ ..
more of a counterstrike guy.

yea well here&#x27;s my 2cents:

1) dont worry about the speedcube thing yet. maybe get some silicon
spray (the prestone is REALLY good), but other than that, your cube
will get soo much better just by cubing a lot.

2) the most popular method out right now is the fridrich method. but
dont limit yourself to it. see which one seems the coolest and stick
with it till you beat macky ;)

yea, thats about it. everyone else has already said anything else
worth mentioning. good luck!

Whoa cool, that&#x27;s awesome that you wrote a program to do it.  I use to
do pencil stereograms on graph paper.  I read several books about how
they work and would just make line designs, really simple stuff like a
square with one corner coming out of the paper and one sinking in.

Yeah I know what you mean, I also can have stuff between me and the
picture or moving around and still see the pictures.  I can also see
them almost instantly, and can switch between the crosseyed and
parallel methods pretty much instantly too.

I like to try to train my eyes for the parallel method on repeating
wallpaper.  It&#x27;s easy to do with the cross eyed technique, but getting
the two patterns to meet with parallel is often quite hard and takes
some concentration!

That program is awesome!  Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work very well on my laptop
either.  The first piece will move most of the way to the bottom, but
then the program freezes.  It is still very cool to see the designs
change and move the pieces around while viewing the stereogram!

Hey Stefan, I bought a video once that was a stereogram movie.  It was
 the same idea as this game, but it was an animated movie with
different shapes moving around.

There were three episodes for different skill levels: beginner  where
the viewpoint for the stereogram is very small and easy to see and
does not change.  There are very few moving objects and they don&#x27;t
move quickly.  Intermediate where the viewpoint was further apart,
there was more detail and more objects moving on the screen.  And
difficult where there were a lot of objects on the screen and the
viewpoint for the stereogram changed (with clues in the picture to
hint to you to focus further or closer).

Anyway if you know of any other stereogram movies or games or anything
I&#x27;d love to try some more stuff.

I mostly just have books now, but I wonder if there are more games
done in stereogram.

Anyway thanks for the program, I&#x27;ll try to mess with it some more to
get it to work, but it still seems very cool!

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Chris,

  I have a copy of an old game called &quot;Magic Carpet.&quot;  It was kind a a
combat flight sim only you were on a magic carpet casting spells. 
Quite fun actually.  Anyway, it came with built in support for VR
HMD&#x27;s, Red/Blue 3d glasses, and yup: stereogram mode.  Granted, since
this was a fully 3d action game the stereogram mode is practically
unplayable, but it is a lot of fun to mess around with.

There is a short summary and a link to a torrent for the game here:

http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?id=2076

(If you&#x27;re looking for old abandonware games I highly reccomend the
underdogs.)

Cheers,
Daniel

Now that you say it, I think might&#x27;ve drawn some pencil stereograms as 
well. Like a cube and similar. But the programs I wrote computed those 
stereograms with a &quot;repeating&quot; &quot;random&quot; pattern.

Yes, I completely agree :-) Cross-eyed it&#x27;s very easy and parallel (or 
even wider is hard. I had some pictures in some books that were 
intended for parallel viewing (probably you know but maybe not 
everybody: If you view it the wrong way, the depth information will be 
reversed, making the image look strange) but the column width was very 
large, so I had to train this. Maybe the artist had intended the 
picture to be printed smaller than the creator of the book did.

Yes, same happens to me. I&#x27;d guess it has to do with either the timer 
or the sound. Remember I wrote this many years ago and I wrote it 
completely in assembler and not using any libraries besides BIOS/DOS. 
So I also accessed the ports directly and this might be a problem now 
with Windows. I also computed each single pixel myself of course (this 
was even more fun with my other 3d programs (i.e. not stereograms but 
more like a better Wolfenstein 3D engine)) and I&#x27;m just happy Windows 
still let&#x27;s me switch to that graphics mode and set the pixels 
directly...

Wow, it sounds awesome. I&#x27;d ***love*** to watch that. I might just be 
annoyed by the (probably unnecessary) focusing clues ;-). Is it a TV 
video or on computer so you could share it?

Makes me happy you like my program :-). I only wish I hadn&#x27;t made the 
bottom line red. Completely unnecessary and it would be so much more 
beautiful in all blue... sigh... I lost the source code because of a 
harddisk crash and probably wouldn&#x27;t understand it anymore anyway (and 
maybe I wouldn&#x27;t even know anymore how to compile it ;-).

Cheers!
Stefan

Number of moves are usually based on half-turn metrics.
But for fast sequences, I noticed that quarter-turn metrics do a better 
job (even if there are other important criteria).

It&#x27;s a VHS tape, but we have a lab on campus where I can convert that
to an .avi file or something similar and get it online.

Incidently I also have the VHS tape from my MTV appearance that I&#x27;ve
been meaning to take to that lab and get on my site.  I could also
take the stereogram tape down and send the file to you.  It would be a
good excuse to stop being lazy and just go to the technology lab ;-)

I&#x27;ll have to hunt around for the tape, it got lost after my family
moved but I have a few ideas where it might be.

Anyway I&#x27;ll look into that and try to get a recording of it that&#x27;s
computer friendly.

Central Park sounds fine, if temperature is not too low for 
speedcubing :-)
But unfortunately I have some constraints, it has to be a week day

Sounds great, I&#x27;m looking forward to it. And to that MTV video, too 
(assuming you&#x27;re cubing in it, not singing or whatever... nah, 
actually I&#x27;d like to see that, too ;-)

          <div class="email-content">If you take the math approach though you also have to factor in the
3/4 chance for AUF before (or after) the PLL alg.  Also you have to
know for which OLL algs you rotate to achieve the proper start angle

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so much irrelevant to count LL moves, just a more
practical way of doing it, especially for something like ZBLL where I
would have to factor in the number of moves, and the 3/4 probably of
AUF for over 72 algs to know my ZBLL count.

I agree that the method works perfectly, but beyond a certain number
of algs I would much rather do averages counting moves for my LL.

Just my two cents of course,

Ha! - I just posted about that and deleted it again -- was still 
catching up with this thread. :)

Have you tried it, btw?  I&#x27;ve done only a couple of very simple ones... 
it takes ages and it&#x27;s quite tricky to make smooth scratches.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan (and others interested),

If you don&#x27;t want to wait for me to find my video here are some
similar videos on eBay right now.

http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?sofocus=bs&amp;sbrftog=1&amp;catref=C6&amp;fstype=1&amp;from=R10&amp;satitle=magic+eye+movie&amp;sacat=-1%26catref%3DC6&amp;bs=Search&amp;sargn=-1%26saslc%3D2&amp;sadis=200&amp;fpos=27612&amp;ftrt=1&amp;ftrv=1&amp;saprclo=&amp;saprchi=&amp;fsop=1%26fsoo%3D1&amp;coaction=compare&amp;copagenum=1&amp;coentrypage=search

I think yahoo will mess up the link format, but I just searched for
&quot;magic eye video&quot;  nobody calls them stereograms! :-(  Or maybe I
think it is the company &quot;Magic Eye&quot; since I have a book by them.

Anyway check those out if you&#x27;re interested, but of course I will look
for my video as soon as I can get home from school.

Also, I think I will take my MTV video in to the technology lab
tomorrow, I&#x27;d love to get it online.  It was a series of short clips
of me cubing (sadly no singing, though I think that would be hilarious
seeing as how I am not the best singer lol) that they showed in
between the music videos.  The term they called it was a &quot;bumper&quot;.

Anyway they&#x27;re really short, but it was an exciting time for me so I&#x27;d
like to document it online :-)

But, if you can perform multiple PLLs from different angles, or if
they are symmetric, it is less than 3/4 (ie - for me, it is less than
3/4 for T, Y, N, H, Z, 3-cycles (corner or edge), E, J (aka L), and
sometimes G).

The reason why I call it irrelevant is because (unless you are
constantly changing algorithms, which you are so consider yourself an
exception), the average number of moves it takes to solve the LL will
remain static over time.  ie - Anybody who uses pure Fridrich and has
already learned OLL/PLL will have the same average # of moves for LL
even with 10 years of practice of it.  This is not true with F2L since
 the F2L gives the cuber options that are not available with the
Fridrich LL.

I never said it would be worth it to calculate such, especially for
ZB, unless somebody was really bored. :)

No, at least not yet. I do have some acrylic plastic sheets I think 
and also a compass, but just one for drawing, not scratching...

You&#x27;ll be there, too? Awesome! Wow, so many great cubers from many 
different countries will be there... it&#x27;ll be a real big event :-)

Hmm, there&#x27;s one in Orlando which might be the closest... but I 
haven&#x27;t booked my flights yet.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine
Orlando is the best (closest) airport to the resort. From Europe the 
flights are frequent as it is such a big tourist destination. 
You might be able to get a package with a tour operator like Thomas 
Cook who can arrange the flight and Pop Century resort cheaper than 
doing it seperately. It is also sometimes much cheaper to fly from 
Manchester or Birmingham taking a bus or train from London to these 
airports.

Don&#x27;t forget that the  discount on the rooms in Pop Century runs out 
next week, on the 4th, you have to tell them you are with the Rubik&#x27;s 
Championship - contact info is on rubiks.com.

          <div class="email-content">Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
For those who don&#x27;t know me yet, I&#x27;m from Switzerland and I&#x27;m quite<br>
new to speedcubing. I started cubing for nearly a month now and my<br>
times are improving by the day. When I started looking for algorithms<br>
on the web, one thing stroke me: Every cuber has his own website<br>
exposing his algorithms (or just explaining Fridich method), wouldn&#x27;t<br>
it be easier for the cubing community to have a central database<br>
exposing everyone&#x27;s algorithm (or method description) ? What do you<br>
think ?<br>
<br>
To this end, I started coding a simple structured database that can<br>
hold virtually any kind of method (with any number of steps). As soon<br>
as one has an account on that database, one can add his own algorithms<br>
and show them to anyone visiting the database. Currently the demo<br>
database I created (at http://membres.lycos.fr/grubik/), shows the<br>
different methods using ImageCube php script (from Lars Vandenbergh)<br>
and the RubikPlayer applet (from Werner Randelshofer). It also<br>
includes &quot;Summary sheets&quot;. The current development branch also works<br>
for Revenge as well as standard Rubik cube.<br>
<br>
Inserting new cube configurations was made possible by taking part of<br>
Rubik Repair code (http://www.roobik.com from Rob Brown).<br>
<br>

in which they have a virtual employee to take hold of an empty

That&#x27;s fun, thanks :-). After a few attempts, my record is 35 hits. 
But I had to count myself, I don&#x27;t think there really is a status bar. 
Or do you see one?

          <div class="email-content">Hi David,

Thx for your impression

The triangle is perfect representave of 2x2x2 for me. Space corner 
center move accept full position 7!  X 36 = 3 674 160. U=D&#x27;   R=L&#x27;   
F=B&#x27;  Axis changes only.  The eighth corner isn&#x27;t necessary and the 
opposite is the center move. He doesn&#x27;t need a name or color, he is 
a joker:))  I prefer this system on java for the fewest move 
experience. The 3x3x3 and more is&#x27;nt same because  it has edges and 
centers for exact position in space corner move only.
I prefer my 2x2x2 and this system on java only for the good 
perception.

Thx Stephan, my distraction :))  I put my explanation on file on 
this group now.

I couldn&#x27;t see one.  There is also a SIRDS version of Quake 2 to

Hehe, 11 years ago I probably would&#x27;ve bought that book :-)

And I found out the guy meant the status bar of *the browser*... with 
Opera I don&#x27;t see it but with IE I do. Man, why didn&#x27;t he just add it 
to the applet...

I didn&#x27;t like to ask if you already had it. ;)  The idea for a similar 
book had occurred to me -- but only as a joke -- when Magic Eye first 
appeared.  It still might be worth getting this one for a laugh.

I&#x27;m up to 45 hits so far, it&#x27;s hard to hit the ball when it gets near
the back paddle (a little harder to see) but I guess it gets better
with practice.

My last challenge didn&#x27;t have a huge success. Here&#x27;s another one :-)

With corners-first systems, you often keep 6 edges and 4 centers for 
the last step (UL/UR/UF/UB/DF/DB and U/D/F/B).

I think I did a rather good average yesterday (U side not adjusted, 
12 times, starting with the cube in hands, stopping on the table).
-> 3.52s.
Try to beat it :-P

yeah I just got up to 83 hits, but the ball starts to slowly speed up 
and in order to handle the faster speed the refresh rate on the static 
goes up.

After a while it gets to be really hard to see the ball, as even the 3D 
part starts to look a little &quot;staticy&quot; and it&#x27;s hard to make up the 
shapes as they move quickly.

It&#x27;s still a cool program, I&#x27;ll just try to play at the lower levels :-)

          <div class="email-content">So I got my first cube about 3 weeks ago. It took about two days <br>
using the included booklet to solve the cube, and then another two <br>
days or so before I could solve the cube unassisted. I stumbled upon <br>
the various cube sites and decided I should see how fast I could <br>
solve the cube.<br>
<br>
My current fastest is 1:42 using the &quot;booklet&quot; method, however all <br>
solves under 2 minutes are due to be able to skip steps. I average <br>
around 2:30. I knew going in that I would have to learn a new <br>
method, but wanted to at least familiarize myself with the cube <br>
first. I feel like I have done that and am ready to move on.<br>
<br>
I have been researching the various methods, specifically the <br>
Fridrich and the Petrus. After looking at various pages and times, I <br>
feel that the Fridrich method ultimately hold the most potential for <br>
speed. Would most people agree with me here?<br>
<br>
It seems that the &quot;cubing community&quot; as a whole agrees that learning <br>
the algorithms for the last layer is much easier than the F2L. Based <br>
on this I decided (at least for now) rely on my old method for <br>
solving the F2L and then apply the algorithms from the Fridrich <br>
method for the LL. However after taking a look at the LL algorithms <br>
on Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s site, I am not so sure that I am capable of <br>
memorizing that many scenarios.<br>
<br>
Did anyone else become GREATLY OVERWHELMED when first trying to <br>
apply the Fridrich method? Is this a typical response? Is this a <br>
difficult enough tast that some should stick to the Petrus method <br>
due to the smaller amount of algorithms to memorize?<br>
<br>
Any feedback, tips, encouragement, monetary donations would be <br>
appreciated.... ok, so the donations aren&#x27;t necessary, but you get <br>
the idea.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I disagree... I think it&#x27;s better to work on your F2L. You can cut more time than just learning the LL. I already know all F2L and PLL, and half OLL. My times are around 30, so I&#x27;m not an expert, but I really think that you should learn to do fast F2L before the LL. You can use a 3 or 4 look LL at first, and later switch to 2 look (what I&#x27;m trying to do)...
but, just my opinion, see what&#x27;s better for you

days or so before I could solve the cube unassisted. I stumbled upon 
the various cube sites and decided I should see how fast I could 
solve the cube.

My current fastest is 1:42 using the &quot;booklet&quot; method, however all 
solves under 2 minutes are due to be able to skip steps. I average 
around 2:30. I knew going in that I would have to learn a new 
method, but wanted to at least familiarize myself with the cube 
first. I feel like I have done that and am ready to move on.

I have been researching the various methods, specifically the 
Fridrich and the Petrus. After looking at various pages and times, I 
feel that the Fridrich method ultimately hold the most potential for 
speed. Would most people agree with me here?

It seems that the &quot;cubing community&quot; as a whole agrees that learning 
the algorithms for the last layer is much easier than the F2L. Based 
on this I decided (at least for now) rely on my old method for 
solving the F2L and then apply the algorithms from the Fridrich 
method for the LL. However after taking a look at the LL algorithms 
on Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s site, I am not so sure that I am capable of 
memorizing that many scenarios.

Did anyone else become GREATLY OVERWHELMED when first trying to 
apply the Fridrich method? Is this a typical response? Is this a 
difficult enough tast that some should stick to the Petrus method 
due to the smaller amount of algorithms to memorize?

Any feedback, tips, encouragement, monetary donations would be 
appreciated.... ok, so the donations aren&#x27;t necessary, but you get 
the idea.

I don&#x27;t think so.  It&#x27;s the most widely accessible method on the 
net, and therefor, has the most users.  If other systems had as many 
people using them, they would possess as much potential.

It&#x27;s true.  However, F2L is more important, most would agree.  You 
can have a 1 second LL, but if you have a 25 second F2L, you&#x27;ll 
never get sub 20.

Chris Hardwick and others are memorizing hundreds and hundreds of 
algorithms for the ZB method.  If you try, you can pretty much do 
anything.  The trick is convincing yourself to stay motivated.

I&#x27;ve still got 4 PLL algorithms to learn, and my OLL is two steps.  
I average 22.5 to 23 these days.  You don&#x27;t necessarily need to 
learn so many algorithms to do well, it just affords you greater 
odds.  Not pausing during solves and executing what you know quickly 
is much more crucial.

Well, like everyone says, it&#x27;s important to customize your method to 
you.  You need to figure out what works the best with your hands, 
and what your brain can recognize.  There are incredibly fast cubers 
out there with all sorts of methods, and the most successful are the 
ones who have optimized their methods for themselves.  Don&#x27;t just 
become a basic Fridrich clone.  Look at a lot of algs, look at 
different approaches, look at different methods.  Gilles Roux&#x27;s 
method is extremely fast if you&#x27;re good at slice moves.  Lars 
Petrus&#x27; method is more efficient and better at taking advantage of 
blocks of pieces already together.  Corners first methods like the 
Waterman method have tremendous potential, but very few users.  Find 
what works for you.

Good luck, and may the force be with you.

I think ZB has the most &quot;potential.&quot;  If somebody could &quot;master&quot; ZB,
(ie - execute all algs at full speed with minimum recognition), that
should be faster than Fridrich.That is, to say that 4th pair + OLL +
PLL does not have as much potential for speed as ZBF2L + ZBLL.

I recommend first learning F2L, then PLL (with the 7 corner OLLs), and
finally OLL.  When switching from my original method (which I averaged
 ~37 seconds) to Fridrich, I switched from cross on top to cross on
bottom, learned intuitive Fridrich F2L, learned all PLL, &amp; learned the
7 OLLs for corners before taking ANY timings.  Once you decide to make
the switch, it is permanent.  DO NOT USE YOUR OLD METHOD AT ALL.

At first.  The times went from 37 seconds to ~ 50-60 at first (even
with so much learning and practice of it), but dropped below my old
average before long.

F2L is very important, but a fast LL can save you if your F2L sucks
(like for me).  I think F2L is more important, but like I said, I went
straight to a Fridrich 3-look and know nothing about the speed of a
4-look.  Learning algorithms gets very easy with practice.

don&#x27;t need to see it, and if you have cross on bottom then the LL(last

Anybody ever tried cross at back?

times, Jean and I don&#x27;t systematically do our cross on bottom, but we<br>
end up cross with white on bottom, I think doing the 2-3 first edges<br>
of the cross on U layer allows better fingertricks, and putting the<br>
4th edge with your LL on U allows you to have a good transition<br>
between cross and F2L(although most cubers consider that the cross is<br>

I don&#x27;t like to hear &quot;learning&quot; F2L because fast times are easier to<br>

I advice everybody to use bernard helmstetter database to find your<br>

I don&#x27;t entirely agree.  Though I am incredibly grateful to Bernard
Helmstetter for the immense amount of work he has done in generating
all the algs necessary for a 1 look LL, the algs of his that I have
seen so far aren&#x27;t always the best.

I work with the Helmstetter algs for ZBLL every day, and maybe the
ones for OLL and PLL are different, but the ones for ZBLL are usually
fast but not as fast as the ones I find with ACube.
http://software.rubikscube.info/

I would recommend using Bernard Helmstetter&#x27;s algs only in conjunction
with ACube.  Bernard&#x27;s algs can show you which face combinations
[R,U,L], [R,U,F,L], [F,U,B], [R,U,F], [L,U,F], [R,U,L,D] etc. are the
most promising by looking at the best algs on his list.

Still, I find quite often that the best alg on his list is not the
fasest alg, though they are often in the same face grouping.  Bernard
seems to have included the optimal alg, a few slightly non-optimal
algs, and lots of algs in the [R,U,L] or [R,U,L,D].  Usually the
fastest alg for me is among the slightly non-optimal group.  However,
Bernard usually only lists a few when ACube finds 10-50 depending on
the case.

Anyway, I do agree with looking at the Helmstetter algs, ONLY if you
also search for algs for that case using ACube.  Bernard&#x27;s list is an
EXCELLENT *starting point*, but don&#x27;t stop there.

This is just from my personal experience, but again I do work with the
Helmstetter algs every day.

          <div class="email-content">Giving myself about 1 second of preinspection, but no restrictions on
the M slice centers (though I always make sure to have either white or
yellow oriented when I actually solve) I got an average of 5.68s.

I average about 23 seconds, mixing in a few Roux method solves each
average, when the start looks good.  I&#x27;ve been learning COLL for my
normal solves, but still need to learn around 17 of the cases.  I&#x27;d
like to have those finished and learn some of the special cases for
the orientation, even though I know the 1x2x3 blocks are where I lose
most of my time.

I use your orientation method on my 4x4, so improving my Roux solves
seems like a good idea in my quest for lower times.

I can&#x27;t wait to see more people post about this.  I&#x27;m going to find an
average time and move count for my 1x2x3 blocks in a bit.

Happy cubing.

Well, you have done all this work so I think you should be the one

If you do that, I&#x27;ll just stop my basic and incomplete LL-Scrambler

Tell me what you want to do ;-)

Yes.
Cheating? Not really, because most of the time, a start based on 
orientations is anticipated.

About 40 U/M &quot;random&quot; moves. Computer generated scrambles would be 
better.

No :-)

Thanks a lot for your message, Macky and Peter!

I think I can communicate by using English,
so the language is not the big problem.
But I really don&#x27;t what the room sharing is,
but you know, it sounds really enjoyable.
So, I am looking forward to doing it!
Well, my flight is on 2nd 19:20(JSTM) via Chicago,
and then Orlando.  Arriving at 22:40 in Orland on 2nd.

Well, I will check here sometime, so please post here.
See ya!

Can that rule be changed, or reinterpreted for this? I&#x27;ve spent a lot

I&#x27;d love to enter 2x2x2 competitions with half a chance.

          <div class="email-content">The world record would surely be better. Coz more ppl means more
competition and more research would go into different strategies. also
we would see better cubes being made and being easily avaible. Also we
cubers could start earning some money too :)

          <div class="email-content">David,

First off, you are one of my most highly respected twistypuzzlers, but
c&#x27;mon. We all know solving corners of a 3x is the same as solving a
2x, on paper. But the fact of the matter is, it is a 2x competition.
The inherent crappiness of the Rubik&#x27;s 2x is all part of the
challenge. I personally feel the same way you do, but don&#x27;t you think
solving 3x corners defeats the whole purpose of a 2x competition? You
can use (superior) eastsheen 2x&#x27;s in regular WCA tournaments which is
pretty much just a corners only 3x but since seven towns is dishing
out the prize money for the worlds, there&#x27;s no way you can debate that.

I bet you could tear it up on a Rubik&#x27;s 2x if you tried hard enough. ;)

good luck - mike grimsley

As has been said before, there is a difference between cubing and other 
sports (among which I include cupstacking): if we wait long enough, the 
world records in cubing will be 100% lucky cases.  Whereas in other 
speed sports, if we wait long enough, the world records will all be 
held by undiscovered drugs users.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
I have to tell about this very cool achievement. As many of you know <br>
Dan Harris is running a weekly fewest moves competition hosted at <br>
<br>
http://www.cubestation.co.uk<br>
<br>
For FMC#99 the scramble was : D2 B&#x27; F U&#x27; L (R&#x27; D U2 B2 U2 )*3 D2 F2 L <br>
F&#x27; (B D&#x27; R2 D B&#x27; )*3 U L&#x27; B D2 R&#x27;<br>
<br>
My solution started like this : U&#x27; L&#x27; D B D B L&#x27; F&#x27; B L B D F.R<br>
This leaves 5 corners to be solved. I fix this with 2 corner 3-cycle <br>
insertions like this : first insert F&#x27; U&#x27; B U F:U&#x27; B&#x27; U at the dot and <br>
then a rather long D R B&#x27; L B R&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; B D&#x27; at the colon to make sure <br>
to use only quarterturns all the way :D So the final solution is then :<br>
<br>
U&#x27; L&#x27; D B D B L&#x27; F&#x27; B L B D U&#x27; B U F D R B&#x27; L B R&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; B D&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; U R<br>
<br>
It was very fun to have achieved this. My submitted best solution was <br>
3 moves shorter (and used some half turns ... lol).<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

what if other people designed the shirts and submitted the designs

what do you guys think?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Gustav,

I think Masayuki Akimoto&#x27;s page is excellent for learning to recognize
CLL/COLL.

His method is more or less how I recognize also.  You mostly just look
for groups of stickers with either the same color or opposite colors.
 Using that you can identify all the cases.

Here&#x27;s Masayuki&#x27;s page on recognition:

Sounds like a good idea to me, less work for myself :)

If anyone wants to design a shirt for strangepuzzle then post your idea here
or on the &#x27;contact me&#x27; page on strangepuzzle. Get your submissions in by
October 21st. If I have enough submissions, then I&#x27;ll let people vote from
the 21st until the 24th. If nobody or very little people submit, then it&#x27;s
up to me :)

Thanks Sapan,

-Chris

  Hi Ron,

  Can that rule be changed, or reinterpreted for this? I&#x27;ve spent a lot
  of money on 2x2x2s and they are all terrible.

  I&#x27;d love to enter 2x2x2 competitions with half a chance.

  TIA,

I had never seen one of the Harry Potter 2x2 cubes in person before, 
and it never occurred to me that it would be larger than the normal 
2x2, but it sure is.  Would that be legal to use in the 2x2 event in 
Florida? Could it be nixed on a technicality by stating only 2x2 mini 
cubes are allowed for the event?  That cube would be quite an 
advantage to some cubers over the mini cube. 

What are the dimensions of an eastsheen 2x2?  I ask because if they 
are the same (or very close) then one could get new stickers to use 
instead of Harry Potter from cubsmith.com.  Otherwise, I am not sure 
where to get new stickers of that size.

The Harry Potter 2x2 has dimensions of 5.75cm all around (or, for the 
Americans, 2.25 in ), which is the same size as a 3x3.  Oh, and they 
are dirt cheap now, but it is cutting it close to WC2005 at this 
point.

          <div class="email-content">well it only rubiks brand products allowed at the wc,
and since its available to all cubers, i&#x27;m sure there
would be no problem in using it. the large size rubiks
one is just a tad bigger than the eastsheen version, i
believe the eastsheen is  2&quot; (i have no tape measure
for mine)where as the harry potter is 1/4&quot; larger, so
the eastsheen stickers should be sufficent although
there would be a larger gap.

From: &quot;Dan Knights&quot;<br>
Date: Tuesday, 27 Sep 2005 8:03:25 PM -0000 <br>
<br>
Hi Kwickykanny and others,<br>
<br>
How&#x27;s everyone doing?  Dan Knights here.  I haven&#x27;t checked in for a <br>
while, but I heard about this posting, and I wanted to clear it up, <br>
since I wrote the solution in the cube booklet.<br>
<br>
Firstly, the Rubik&#x27;s parent company misprinted the booklet.  They <br>
printed a rough draft without my approval or knowledge.  Somehow, <br>
when they printed it, the last turn of three of the algorithms was <br>
omitted.  There are also numerous changes for the final draft, which <br>
should be out in the next version, hopefully soon.<br>
<br>
They have apologized for the misuse of my solution.  I have accepted <br>
their apology, and we have arrived at an agreement that grants them <br>
permission to use my CORRECTED solution in the future.<br>
<br>
The 25th edition cube in the plastic hexagon contains the errors.  <br>
The 25th edition cube in the regular plastic card packaging does not <br>
have any turns missing from its algorithms, but it is still a rough <br>
draft.  Collector&#x27;s editions, I guess.... Hopefully within the next <br>
year they should have my updated approved solution.<br>
<br>
Regarding the inefficiency/simplicity of the solution, Chris was <br>
absolutely correct when he supposed that I was trying to make the <br>
solution as simple as possible.  The solution is clearly not very <br>
efficient, but it provides a step-by-step guide with very little <br>
decision-making required of the user.  It is intended for the general <br>
public to use as a tool to get their cubes back to solved, even if <br>
they are not mathematically inclined.  The final version should serve <br>
this purpose well.<br>
<br>
Happy Cubing!<br>
<br>

I&#x27;ll also be adding 4x4x4 tile sets.  These sets have rounded corners <br>
and came out very nice.  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;d also like to know what people want to see at WC2005.  I&#x27;m going <br>
to ge making a limited amount of comemorative 2x2 magics which I&#x27;ll <br>
only be selling in Florida.  The final design isn&#x27;t finished yet but <br>
I&#x27;ll post pics on my site when they are.  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll also probably have standard 3x3 sets with a custom logo sticker <br>
in honor of the event.<br>
<br>
If anyone has more sugestions please feel free.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

          <div class="email-content">I got a 19.92 average a little while ago and thought I&#x27;d share some<br>
things I noticed.  It was only sub-20 by .08 seconds, but it still<br>
counts enough for me.  My average average is a little under 23.00<br>
seconds, so this was somewhat unexpected.  It beats my previous<br>
average record by more than a second.<br>
<br>
I was taking an average of 100 (21.67 seconds), and it came 70 or so<br>
solves in.  I got so flustered after I realized I&#x27;d broken 20 that I<br>
got nervous and slowed way down for almost another whole average. <br>
After that, I got it down to about 20.75 for a while.  I did a few<br>
things different than I usually do, and I think they helped.<br>
<br>
Normally, I can find the cross in the 15 seconds, but I generally<br>
can&#x27;t do it blindfolded.  For a while, though, tonight, I noticed I<br>
was able to see the cross within 4 or 5 seconds, and could spend the<br>
rest of the time memorizing it and planning for my first pair. <br>
Forcing myself to find at least an edge that will be in the U layer<br>
after the cross seemed to help a lot.  Also, I noticed that I was<br>
doing the cross much more efficiently than usual.  Good cross leads to<br>
good solves.<br>
<br>
Be flexible in your F2L technique.  I made a lot of blocks to start<br>
with, and made a lot of extended cross solves, or finished my cross<br>
and conserved a c/e pair.  It always gave me great times.  I need to<br>
go read Lars Petrus&#x27; page again for more pointers on block starts.<br>
<br>
I know that going slowly for F2L until you get used to it, and then<br>
gradually speeding up is very helpful for avoiding pauses, but I&#x27;ve<br>
never been really very good at doing that.  Tonight, I focused on just<br>
being fluid and always doing some sort of turn.  I didn&#x27;t worry so<br>
much about the speed, just making sure to always be moving something<br>
(usefully).  It helped a lot.<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;re learning algorithms, decide to yourself ahead of time<br>
whether or not to use those.  I have all but one of the algs for the U<br>
orientation on COLL down.  The last one has been giving me a lot of<br>
trouble.  I&#x27;m probably going to switch to a different alg.  Anyway,<br>
the point is that if you have to split second decide whether or not to<br>
use an alg, it hurts.  Just commit yourself to using your older,<br>
slower method until you can for sure remember your new one.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, just thought I&#x27;d share a little of my excitement, and offer<br>
some of the things I noticed to the group.  Hopefully this will be of<br>
use to someone other than me.<br>
<br>
Happy cubing, and may the force be with you.<br>

I&#x27;ve been doing some reading on running your processor very hot for<br>
long periods of time, and it does not look good.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been running ACube on my computer for significant portions of<br>
every day (12 hours+) for the past week or so.  I have an R31 laptop<br>
with a Pentium III and I&#x27;ve noticed that my computer stays very warm.<br>
 I try to keep it elevated above my desk with books and other objects<br>
to allow the fan (on the underside of the machine) to draw in air, as<br>
well as to give the underside of my laptop space to &quot;breathe&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyway I got kinda worried when reading about running a processor hot<br>
for long periods of time.  I don&#x27;t want to corrupt any data on my<br>
computer, but I want to be able to run ACube a lot.<br>
<br>
Anyway I was wondering if this is much of a problem, I mean should I<br>
consider a new/better fan, or another fan?<br>
<br>
Also, is there way to find out the temperature of my processor?  I was<br>
looking around on my laptop and on the web but didn&#x27;t find anything.<br>
<br>
Anyway I just wanted to ask.  I got worried when I saw the effects of<br>
heat on the processor, and since my processor has been running at 100%<br>
for 12+ hours a day for a little over a week I wondered if I am<br>
harming my machine?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,<br>
<br>
I hope I can shed some light on this, not as someone with a lot of <br>
knowledge about it, but some experience.<br>
<br>
First of: Having placed fans at the bottom of a laptop sounds like a <br>
huge design mistake. Since a laptop will almost always be placed upon <br>
something I can&#x27;t see the reason for this and its the first time I&#x27;ve <br>
heard of it.<br>
<br>
Running your processor too hot for too long will at least shorten it&#x27;s <br>
lifespan, but many times this shortened lifespan is still many years <br>
beyond what you regularly use a computer for anyway. I&#x27;ve run programs <br>
like GIMP (which is even more straining on the processor than JACube) <br>
for months without any noticeable damage and I&#x27;ve also done a few week <br>
long runs of JACube.<br>
<br>
I try not too get my processor too hot though and try to keep it below <br>
at least 65C but more preferably 50C (hard to do with a 100% CPU usage). <br>
There should e a lot of programs monitoring the temperature of your CPU. <br>
One is SpeedFan, which can also sometimes measure other temperatures <br>
(like HD&#x27;s) and fan speeds.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: I don&#x27;t think you have anything to fear, but please don&#x27;t <br>
sue me if you run into troubles :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,

I did the same thing as you a while ago.
I have a laptop which I made work for long periods (video encoding).

I used basically the same system as you to keep it as cold as
possible, but I improved it by using water bottles that you place
under the computer, so that there is a bigger temperature difference
and the heat from your computer will go faster to the bottles than
into the air. Another thing I tried is make it run into the fridge but
I couldn&#x27;t leave it there because my battery was going low fastly.

I don&#x27;t know if this is very safe for a computer but I had no problem
(the main problem could be water condensation...).
Let&#x27;s hear what the true computer people say :p.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris!

Any decent bios should tell u the cpu temperature as well as fan 
speed. And if u are lucky the motherboard of ur pc did come with 
some software that will let u monitor this with an application. So 
that u don&#x27;t have to shut down the pc and go into bios. And yes 
there are also third part utilities for such things.

Ok, i did a quick search and found this promising software:

http://www.lavalys.com/products/overview.php?pid=1&amp;lang=en

(Everest Home Edition)

This link will probably be messed up since it contains a 
querystring, lol. Anyway, good luck Chris.

And no there&#x27;s no immediate risk running cpu at high temperatures 
for long periods. But if it goes beyond say 65-70 celsius it&#x27;s not a 
good sign, insufficient cooling.

Cheers!

Good. :)  Yes, that is what it should say.  Thanks, I&#x27;ll change it. 
The colors are meant to be general.  Obviously, I will not have a red
front every time. ;)  I use colors just to show which pieces have the
same color and which have opposites.  Never do I have to think about
whether a color is left/right of another.  Either it is the same, it
is the opposite, or it is adjacent (to either side). :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

No puzzle really requires dismantling for lubrication. At least if u 
use silicone spray ;-) Use the little tube that comes with the spray 
to get the lube inside. Spray in a little amount from various points 
at the outside. Then work the lube in by twisting it for a minute or 
so. Repeat if more lube is needed. Shouls be easy to work out how to 
get the little tube inside the puzzle in each case. Dismantling 
puzzles in most cases is not recommended unless the puzzles needs 
physical maintenance too ;-) Like replace springs or adjust tension or 
sanding ...

Have fun!

-Per

PS!! Wipe off external silicone w a tissue. If u get external silicon 
on the puzzle it probably means u used too much silicone ...

The water can condense when u take the comp out and may condense in
wrong places like inside ur harddisk or stuff. Its sort of equivalent
to putting ur laptop in a bucket of water :)

As for the cpu thing, there is not much harm in running it if u keep
ur comp temperature low.

The Everest Home Edition won&#x27;t show the cpu temperature actually. 
But many other interesting hardware and software features. Maybe i 
was dumb looking for it? :-P Lol. Anyway, i found that my system 
DOES support temperature monitoring. So i installed SpeedFan too, 
and YES it gives me the cpu temp as well as harddisk temp. Sweet :-) 

It can be mimized to run in system tray only ...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

OK. It&#x27;s your call.

I had hoped that a 3x3x3 with just corner stickers would be allowed
because a.) it would be a legal Rubik&#x27;s brand cube and b.) it has
*more* moving pieces, and would actually be slower than a well
engineered 2x2x2.

Many others *do* have the same problem which is why there have been so
few people in those competitions.

I recently had a solve which I recognised completely during
inspection. I was using the larger Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2, and the solve took
28 seconds, It  constantly locks up and is hard to turn. The same
sequence on an Eastsheen 2x2x2 took about 9 seconds.
But the Eastsheen, which really isn&#x27;t that good, isn&#x27;t allowed.

Regards,

David J

How about Rubik&#x27;s Clock? Excessive lube will easily make it slow and 
if you just spray inside, you&#x27;ll wet the paper and it&#x27;ll become ugly 
dark.

Well, I&#x27;m the kind of guy who *always* attempts to disassemble puzzles 
for lubrication. I want to make sure there&#x27;s lube *everywhere* and 
applied evenly and not excessively. I also like to clean, sand, etc, 
so I need to disassemble anyway ;-)

About Harry Potter 2x2: You can disassemble it easily without breaking 
it if you go to sleep and dream that. It&#x27;s basically the same 
mechanism as the regular Rubik&#x27;s 2x2, just bigger, much stiffer, and 
with sharper edges. And the corner connected to the kernel is 
connected with a screw. Accessible from the inside, i.e. when already 
disassembled. I believe the last manufacturing step was using strong 
glue or a very strong click-in mechanism. Great, huh? Maybe if you 
play a lot with it or put some powder inside that will speed up 
loosening of the cube, you can disassemble it like a normal 2x2 and 
don&#x27;t break anything. I broke one of those little pins. I&#x27;m not sure 
though how bad that is, could be a single missing pin doesn&#x27;t hurt.

Eastsheen cubes have been allowed in competitions.  They are just not
allowed in competitions sponsored by Seven Towns, right?

Why on earth /should/ it be allowed?!

(1) It&#x27;s not a Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2
(2) and if it&#x27;s a Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4, you&#x27;ve restricted the possible 
movements (also not allowed).

On the other hand -- and not wishing to give anybody naughty, /naughty/ 
ideas ;) -- a judge at a competition is unlikely to dismantle a large 
2x2x2 to check its internals.  They wouldn&#x27;t want to break it.  So if 
you took an Eastsheen 2x2x2 core and glued suitably modded Rubik&#x27;s 
corners (e.g. from the Harry Potter) on to it, you would have a 
illegal, fast cube, but no-one would ever know.

Agreed.  I feel that there is a distinct lack of common sense in the 
Rubiks-only competition rule.  (Not the standard WCA rules, of course --
 those have been arrived at through extensive consultation &amp; debate.)

Btw, does Rubiks have an official line on the use of NON-RUBIKS washers 
in its cubes?  Non-Rubiks superglue?!

Yeah, I remember this same discussion about the 4x4x4.  I&#x27;m not sure <br>
who has the authority to do anything in this case, but my judges would <br>
not do anything unless asked to do so by a higher source.  I believe it <br>

No, no, you misunderstood. In the dream it can really work! That&#x27;s 
what I meant. I didn&#x27;t mean that the dream can influence the real 
world afterwards... just inside the dream it works.

Richard Carr has broken 2 minutes for a 5x5 ages ago, before anybody 
else came even close to that, I believe. He also didn&#x27;t do it with a 
normal Rubik&#x27;s 5x5 but he simulated it. Ok ok, so his simulation was 
no official &quot;Rubik&quot; product, but what if? Would you want to allow 
that? It would be a Rubik&#x27;s product and *theoretically* it&#x27;s the 
&quot;same&quot; puzzle (like using corners of 3x3 to simulate a 2x2). But it&#x27;s 
not at all the same *mechanical* puzzle. And part of why these puzzles 
are so fascinating is that mechanical aspect. Would you allow 
Richard&#x27;s simulation?

There *are* real 2x2s and even the official Rubik versions aren&#x27;t as 
bad as David&#x27;s one seems to be (28 seconds ??? It must be a horribly 
exceptionally bad one). No need to simulate them.

Cheers!

Clarification: I didn&#x27;t mean to sound negative about computer cubing 
in general. I just meant to say it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be used for 
the normal events.

Yep ;-)

It&#x27;s just completely stiff. Maybe like I said if you play with it a 
lot first, wear it in, then it might get more loose and taking it 
apart could become easier. I haven&#x27;t tried that. I was careful but 
that damn pin still broke. It&#x27;s all very stiff.

Anyway, like I said, it&#x27;s basically the same mechanism as the normal 
(smaller) Rubik&#x27;s 2x2, so if you know how to take that one apart, you 
have an idea how to take the larger ones apart.

Ok ok, I just had an idea:
Buy two of them, take them apart breaking different parts, combine the 
undamaged parts, sand and lube them so that you get a cube that&#x27;s not 
stiff, and assemble with much less force required.

U could still end up breaking the same unique part of the 2 puzzles.

As for running at 100%... this isn&#x27;t a problem at all. As long as 
you don&#x27;t overheat it, then you won&#x27;t have any problems. If you are 
concerned about heat, leave it in the coolest room of your house 
while running that program.

Also, temp ranges vary from one cpu type to the next.I don&#x27;t know 
what type of cpu you have, but don&#x27;t freak out if the temps are 
higher than someone else&#x27;s.

          <div class="email-content">My concern is that in 2003 the first round 3x3x3 ran over into the
second day, and all the organizers were freaking out because we only
had the 2 days to rent the venue, plus plane tickets and travel plans
from competitors were already set.

So in 2005 if we have *two* 2x2x2 events (a rubik&#x27;s event and a WCA
event) and we still have 2 days, and more people are cubing than in
2003 (and thus more competitors) I think this competition is going to
be a logistical nightmare.

Since a lot of people tend to use other brand cubes from the rubik&#x27;s
2x2x2 cube (meaning the rubik&#x27;s event would be smaller than the WCA
event) why don&#x27;t we cancel the rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 event entirely, and just
run a WCA 2x2x2 event which would accept anybody (rubik&#x27;s and non
rubik&#x27;s brand puzzle users).

I mean let&#x27;s face it, this competition will be a logistical nightmare
with us following this ridiculously stupid &quot;rubik&#x27;s puzzles&quot; only
rule.  Which is exactly why I think it is such a completely non-well
thought out rule passed down from the people on high at Seven Towns
since they are the ones sponsoring the competition and want to keep
their profits as high as possible.  They care about $$$$ and not this
competition or the competitiors.

Can the WCA PLEEEEAAAASE sponsor the 2007 WC?  ***PLEASE*** ??

          <div class="email-content">Both SevenTowns and Alega (the distributor of Rubik&#x27;s in Sweden) 
sponsored the Swedish Open Championships 2005, but the competition 
was organised by SveKub, the Swedish Cube Association. There were no 
discussions about not allowing non-Rubik&#x27;s puzzles. And if the 
question would have been raised, I would rather have lost a sponsor 
than introduced that restriction. I believe that we can have both 
SevenTowns as a sponsor and use non-Rubik&#x27;s puzzles in the future.

WC2005 might be a bit different I think, since SevenTowns is rather 
an organiser of the event, not only a sponsor.

Tyson, I agree with you. We need clear guidelines in advance from 
the WC organisers of what is allowed and what is not. That&#x27;s mainly 
why I raised the issue. BTW, who is the organiser that should 
resolve this issue?

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I only have a mini pyraminx, but i assume the mechanism is the same 
for the normal sized ones. U can really only pop out the 6 edges. Turn 
a layer so that the edge sticks out. Then put a knife under it and 
bend slightly downwards with the edge being over the knife. The edge 
should quite comfortably come out. Putting the edge back u do the 
opposite, but the knife is not needed ;-) There are screws inside the 
corner caps but to access them u will need to break the glue then. I 
can&#x27;t really see why u wanna do this unless u disassemble it for fun 
or want to modify it so as to not have the corners at all on it.

Cheers!

I haven&#x27;t seen any official or unofficial schedule yet. But i&#x27;d be 
mighty surprised if the final for the main event (which 3x3x3 
speeding is) is not gonna be sometime on sunday. Your best bet is 
therefore to cube slow and not proceed. Just kidding :-P Maybe 
something can be worked out in case u otherwise would need to be 
there sunday. I hope so :-)

          <div class="email-content">Last weekend I tried to break the world record for most 3x3 cubes <br>
solved blindfolded. It was at a toy fair where they had several <br>
different world record attempts (mine was the only Rubik-related, <br>
though). For previous records, look here:<br>
<br>
http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/rubik-blindfold.html<br>
http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/rubik.html<br>
<br>
Since Geir and Ralf had done 3, I tried 4. Well, originally (i.e. a <br>
few weeks before) I had wanted to do a few more but lazy as I am, I <br>
didn&#x27;t practice much. I was told I&#x27;d have about an hour and the night <br>
before the real attempt, I tried 5 which took about 1.5 hours and I <br>
made a little mistake in 4 of the cubes.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s a picture of the attempt at the toy fair:<br>

<br>
You see me at the fourth cube, the first three are solved. Too bad I <br>
didn&#x27;t put my drinking glass elsewhere ;-). You can see Ralf (one of <br>
the previous record holders) right in front of me. He helped organize <br>
the world record attempts and also set two world records himself. The <br>
camera man on the far left is probably of the film team that filmed my <br>
attempt, it&#x27;ll be included in a German TV show. You can even see Harry <br>
Potter watching me!! Well, he was the next act, so he was probably <br>
just waiting for me to finally finish ;-). The poster on the front <br>
says &quot;Guinness Record attempt&quot; but as we all know, it&#x27;ll never be <br>
included in the Guinness book, which is ok since I don&#x27;t give a damn <br>
about them anyway. I guess the poster was mostly there to attract <br>
attention, simply &quot;world record attempt&quot; might&#x27;ve been more correct.<br>
<br>
Oh, and yes, I did succeed. Took about 1 hour 7 minutes overall, <br>
including about 47 minutes for memorization. I made really sure I got <br>
them memorized well. After each cube I checked my memorization for it <br>
again, and after all four cubes I quickly checked them all once more.<br>

That is amazing, thank you for sharing.  Where is Harry Potter? I am 
trying to find him.  It is like playing &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo&quot;.  That is 
not him leaning on the cardboard box with the arrow pointing down is 
it?

Yes, that&#x27;s him. Later for his show he had some more magician&#x27;s 
clothes on. His tricks were pretty lame, though. Ok, I only watched 
the first 1-2 minutes, maybe later it got better. But I only saw him 
&quot;push buttons&quot;, i.e. just using tricks he bought that are ready-to-use 
and don&#x27;t require any dexterity. Plus, it was so easy to see how they 
worked. Well, ok, it was intended for little children, so what did I 
expect ;-)

Stefan

P.S. In case someone wonders what records Ralf set, they were 
tiddlywinks records. Fastest mile and longest distance, I believe. 
There&#x27;s some infos and a picture about previous records here:

What the ... ?!?
Are you in some jury of a murder trial or what?
Do they really allow you to speak to people outside?
Or are you trying to break the rules so they have to throw you out?

Ok, I watched the show today, though I was told my attempt would be 
included in two or three weeks. It&#x27;s a show where the candidates have 
to guess some number, e.g. how many school teachers exist in Germany.

Then suddenly they showed a scrambled 3x3. One of the candidates said 
she can solve it so she got the cube and began twisting while the 
other candidates began thinking and making their guesses. But before 
that, she she felt her big day had come to insult Mr Rubik by making 
fun of him and claiming that he was never able to solve his cube. Gosh 
I wish I could&#x27;ve punched her right into her face. A bit later when 
she was about done with F2L she said something like &quot;this cube has 
been with played before... the corners are twisted&quot;. Aha. Riiiight.

The question btw was about something else. Of course I thought they&#x27;d 
ask for the most number of cubes solved blindfolded, but actually they 
just asked about the number of possible states. The closest candidate 
said 22 million so he won that round. The math teacher who had thought 
maybe 20 seconds about it was a little further away with her 10 
million or so...

Sigh...

Hi!

I haven&#x27;t seen any official or unofficial schedule yet. But i&#x27;d be 
mighty surprised if the final for the main event (which 3x3x3 
speeding is) is not gonna be sometime on sunday. Your best bet is 
therefore to cube slow and not proceed. Just kidding :-P Maybe 
something can be worked out in case u otherwise would need to be 
there sunday. I hope so :-)

I learned to do them intuitively, after being shown the basic premises
of &#x27;pair up &amp; insert&#x27; and &#x27;separated pair ready for insertion&#x27; by
Richard Patterson.  It took me about two days to get a feel for all of
the cases, and I was working for a few hours here and there each day.

It took me two weeks to get my averages down to where they were
previously (the very high 40&#x27;s and into the 50&#x27;s), and from there I
did nothing but practice F2L until I averaged in the low 30&#x27;s.  I was
still using a 4 look LL at the time.  I played around with the Roux
method a lot, and used it exclusively for a while, and it helps to
make your F2L more flexible.  I also recommend you take a good, long
look at Lars Petrus&#x27; page.

Whatever you do, make sure you understand why the algs you&#x27;re learning
for F2L work.  Don&#x27;t just learn and apply them blindly.  Understand
them and it will help you greatly.  Also, you&#x27;ll never get amnesia.

Happy cubing.

-Mike Bennett

          <div class="email-content">I understand the value of intuitive solving for the f2l, but I don&#x27;t 
have a good enough understanding of the cube to be able to do that 
yet. I am hoping that after learning the 10 algorithms that I am 
working on now, I will be able to really analyze why they work. For 
now I am working on the cases in which the front face of the corner 
cube to be inserted is the cross color.(assuming cross is on bottom).

Before beginning the Freidrich method, I was using the &quot;7 step 
method&quot; that comes in the little booklet packaged with the cube, so 
my best times are barely under two minutes. For now I am not even 
timing myself. I am simply taking my time and trying to solve in as 
few moves as possible. So far, from just practicing solving the 
cross in as few moves as possible and learning a handfull of f2l 
algorithms, I have cut my total moves down from 160-165 to around 
120-130. This is still WAY too many, but I am sure the number will 
continue to drop as I learn more algo&#x27;s. For now, I am still using 
the 7 step method for all cases that I don&#x27;t know a Friedrich&#x27;s algo 
for. I also haven&#x27;t learned any &quot;non-7 step&quot; LL algo&#x27;s yet, so it is 
incredibly slow and envolves a lot of moves.

going to count my moves now... just out of curiosity...

cross----------->9 moves
cross+f2l------->71  wow that&#x27;s a lot of moves
LL-------------->64
whole cube------>135

As you can see, I am not very efficient yet. And even if I learn all 
f2l algo&#x27;s, my LL is currently 64 moves. Oh well... all in good time 
I suppose.

          <div class="email-content">I really think an intuitive F2L is significantly easier and faster to
learn than simply blindly memorising the zillions of algorithms!! I&#x27;m
still always surprised when people talking about &#x27;memorising F2L&#x27;
algorithms because I reckon this is by far the most difficult way to do
it.

And I agree with Mike that another great benefit of intuitive F2L is
that it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to get cube amnesia. I blindly
memorised the algs for a 3-look LL and I occasionally get alg-amnesia
with those. :(

BTW, as a guide to number of moves, a good beginner method should have
you solving in well under 100 moves on average. Nine moves for a
beginner cross is not too bad (any cross can be solved in a maximum of 8
moves). 71 moves for cross + F2L is quite a lot - definitely room for
improvement there. :) 64 moves is also quite a lot for the LL. I
wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about counting moves just yet. It&#x27;s more
important that you start &#x27;understanding&#x27; how the cube works. If this
means taking more moves to do things at the moment then that&#x27;s probably
fine because it will pay off in the end if you have a better
&#x27;understanding&#x27; of the cube. :)

Good luck! :)

Jaap Scherphuis sent me here! I&#x27;ve had this thing since new in 1987.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I could fix it for you.  I built my master magic from scratch, so I&#x27;ve
already had experience doing that.

Also Doug Li and Peter Greenwood have done the same, so they would be
fully capable as well.

Bob Burton and Doug Li actually taught me how to restring a magic, so
if you&#x27;re interested in learning how to restring from them that would
work better.

I would be fine with fixing it and sending it back to you, but if it
breaks again you would have the same problem all over again.

I personally had a difficult time learning to restring, but I am
usually slow to pick on new things like that.  I would recommend
talking to Bob and Doug first and seeing how hard it would be to learn
to restring online (most people have done it this way from what I
understand).  That would solve the problem you have now with the tile
having come out, as well as any future problem as well.

If that doesn&#x27;t work shoot me an e-mail, I&#x27;d be willing to help out.

He lives in Connecticut, less than 90 minutes from me.  I am on the
East Coast, too, in Jersey.

This whole thing reminds me that Ian gave me two magics to disassemble
and use to make him a Master Magic...

Hrmm, Ohio isn&#x27;t TOO far...just on the other side of that enormously
wide state of Pennsylvania.  6 hours through, yuck! :(

If by any chance you are going to WC, I could certainly fix it there
for you and show you exactly how.  Otherwise, I could try my best
explaining it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Troy! Last week I made my own master magic using 2 &#x27;normal&#x27; magics and re-stringing the tiles together.<br>
<br>
But I live in Spain...I can tell you how to fix it but with my method it is long time expensive and hard to do it, because it must be dismantled and then fixed.<br>
<br>
I have never seen a master magic before, so I do not know if the length of the strings are the same.<br>
<br>
You can try it if you dare to, following the instructions given at twistypuzzles.com, at certain article about magic.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

<br>
<br>
  Hi,<br>
<br>
  Jaap Scherphuis sent me here! I&#x27;ve had this thing since new in 1987.<br>
  I <br>
  was letting some friends play it the other day, and later on one of <br>
  the tiles fell out! It came unwrapped somehow, no wires are broken. <br>
  It&#x27;s old and I think some of the wires lost tension but it was<br>
  working <br>
  great until it came apart. There is a slight mess of wires left but <br>
  only one tile has fallen out. Can someone here put it back together <br>
  correctly for me? I&#x27;ll pay for shipping all around. I live in Ohio, <br>
  USA. Jaap would have fixed it for me, but being in the Netherlands we <br>
  figured shipping costs would be too expensive for just a fix up on a <br>
  puzzle.<br>
<br>
  Thanks for your time!<br>
<br>
  -Troy<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, I´m not an expert on this but I can tell you what I do. My 
record is lika 35 moves or so.

I start to look for a short way to build a 2*2*3-block, as you do in 
the Petrus method. Often I can do this in ~10 moves. After that I try 
do finish F2L and at the same time get a short LL. Try different ways 
to finish F2L and eventually you find a way that gives you a OLL-skip 
or PLL-skip.

I know Per is a master on this, so I hope he has got some better 
advises than mine.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys!!

After Anssis great times for feet-solving 3*3*3, my brother Kåre and 
I descided to break the record for feet-solving the 4*4*4 which was 
1 hour 51 minutes. Th result after first try is like this:

Gunnar: 17 minutes 32 seconds
--Kåre: 14 minutes 16.69 seconds

Quite big improvement, isn&#x27;t it! :-P
Try to brake it!!!

          <div class="email-content">yea, when i learned f2l, i learned to do it intuitively and it took me
a couple of hours to understand the concept, and then about a week or
two to get the times down.

but then again, during that week, i would practice about 2-3 hours a
day... so i dont know..

my suggestion (take with a grain of salt, and you may already have
done this) is to learn the concept of f2l and do it intuitively for a
while (maybe like 2-3 days or so), and then go and learn the algs...
that way you&#x27;ll maybe understand a little more when going into the
algs, and might actually make it so you learn faster...

anyways, whatever you decide, good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
so Gilles Roux held a nice cube gettogether at his place a few weeks <br>
ago, we had a small 3x3x3 competition (of course, I won). There were 7 <br>
people there: Gilles, Guillaume Meunier, Sï¿½bastien Fï¿½lix, Nathan Moreau, <br>
Frï¿½dï¿½ric Badie, Matthieu (forgot the last name...) and myself. I don&#x27;t <br>
have the results here, but noone did greatly. Both Sï¿½bastien and me were <br>
out of speedcubes, so I took my old (crappy) Studio and decided to sand <br>
it down there, just to see what happens. It turned out being even worse, <br>
so, yeah... I used one of Gilles&#x27; cubes which was pretty nice. And Seb <br>
sanded down one of his during the tournament, so it wasn&#x27;t great for him <br>
either. He had some trouble with it. The guy is not only fast at <br>
speedcubing, he&#x27;s also a lot faster than anyone else at sanding down <br>
cubes. Or maybe I was just being slow. Or both. So anyway, we did the <br>
tournament, it was lots of fun, and Gilles taped the whole thing. He <br>
just sent me a CD with many of the solves (well, I received it one week <br>
ago, but I didn&#x27;t have much time to put it online). Some of the vids <br>
were also taken by Matthieu, with a digital camera. He only taped sub-20 <br>
solves...<br>
If anyone wants to see the vids, they&#x27;re up on <br>
http://sylmuzox.free.fr/Bastille%202005/ and you&#x27;ll need a login: &quot;erno&quot; <br>
and a password: &quot;rubik&quot;.<br>
Oh, and we also had a cool event, where we set a WR :-D. I was of course <br>
in the winning team... the idea was to solve 3 cubes as a relay, like, <br>
the first guy ran to his cube across the room, solved it, ran back to <br>
his team, the 2nd guy left, etc. A 3x3x3x3 event, if you want...<br>
Anyway, go get the vids!!! sorry about the password thingy btw, but i <br>
got some trouble with another server, so now I&#x27;m just being careful...<br>
Franï¿½ois<br>
PS. some of the vids are quite large, so if you have a slow connexion... <br>
yeah. Well, there&#x27;s all the preinspection time and some time before on <br>
some of the vid, so it ends up being over a minute. Yes, Per, I heard of <br>
video editing, but I got other stuff to do right now :-P<br>
PPS. I got a bug while uploading a few videos, I&#x27;ll try again later <br>
tonight. But quite a lot of them are up and working...<br>
PPPS. I&#x27;m still out of speedcube since what we now call the &quot;Studio <br>
Fiasco&quot;... So if you want to donate...<br>

&gt;Subject: Bill Gates of speedcubing? :) [Yahoo! Clubs: Speed Solving <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube]<br>
&gt;Date: 9 Mar 2002 00:16:45 -0000<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Hello everybody,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I would like to ask you for your honest opinion regarding the <br>
following issue. A friend of mine said that my system is to the <br>
speedcubing as Bill Gates to software, with both the positive and <br>
negative sides. According to him, my supposedly &quot;brute force&quot; <br>
approach basically killed other, more elegant approaches that nobody <br>
keeps on developing. He did not mention what approaches he had in <br>
mind, though.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I was very surprised to read those words because I never forced my <br>
system to anybody and neither did I try to &quot;sell it&quot;. In 1995, I put <br>
my page up with my only intent - to share my knowlegde. To this day, <br>
I never even bothered to put a counter on my pages, so I was not <br>
aware of the extent of the popularity of this system till I was <br>
actually called upon joining this club.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Thinking more about this issue, it brings me towards asking the <br>
natural question: &quot;What do you see as incentives in using my system <br>
over other approaches?&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I voiced my opinion about systems on my page already in 1995 - it <br>
is not the system that makes a good speedcubist, but the level of <br>
detail to which the system is worked out and the amount of hard work <br>
spent practicing. This is confirmed by comparing the best cubists <br>
and the fact that the fastest people tend to average around 17 <br>
seconds no matter what system they use (it is like a some sort <br>
of &quot;law of nature&quot;).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Furthermore, unfortunately, top-speedcubing IS a question of brute <br>
force, like it or not. An &quot;elegant system&quot; with a few algorithms <br>
could be improved by adding more algorithms. But then you follow the <br>
path towards complexity again.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I am surprised that the by-layers method is so predominant <br>
nowadays. In 1982, most of the cubers in the first 10 places used <br>
corners-first (unless I am mistaken - Lars do you have a better <br>
statistics?). Is it just because no comprehensive description of the <br>
corners-first system is available on the net? How about Minh Thai&#x27;s <br>
system? That should be good, too, right?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;My final thought, if I truly am the Bill Gates of speedcubing with <br>
the negatives and positives, then I should become unhealthy rich <br>
soon, am I right? :)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;BTW, thanks for reading if you made it that far.<br>

I think u better use ur video editing abilities much more wisely. 
Why did u make this video? Just to make fun of some other people? 
And did u ask permission to use lines from private chats? Sorry to 
be so negative, but if u wanted to offend people u have really 
succeeded.

I much rather watch the original Leone movie than this sacrilege.

Nicely cubed. But i guess someone will try to break it not brake 
it ... lol ... ;-)

I&#x27;m curious, how do the stickers like all this feetcubing? Do u 
already use the superior cubesmith stickers? And lastly, do u wash 
ur feet before the cubing ? :-P

Cheers!

At 1 minute 7 seconds you pull your head far back... Well, I&#x27;m sure 
you didn&#x27;t cheat, but only because I know you good enough... if I 
didn&#x27;t know you... it would look very suspicious.

After my recent attempt for 4 cubes Ralf Laue suggested to use better 
blindfolds, namely swimming goggles. Imagine this one with black 
plastic sheets glued in front of the glasses:
http://images180.affili.net/042/917042_1.jpg

That would fit closely, leaving no gaps to look through. And it won&#x27;t 
accidentally slide around during the solve. I think this would be much 
much better that what we&#x27;ve used so far. What do you think?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

I&#x27;ve thought about blindfolds like that, but it might be somewhat 
uncomfortable to slip on.  Actually, now that you mention it, I do 
actually remember that.  I pulled my head back because I wanted to be 
in a more upright position while solving and I actually think, during 
the solve, that people might think I was cheating so I think I may have 
leaned back forward.

And the head tilt somewhere in there was because the cube was jamming.  
You know how people jerk their heads to correspond with their movements 
while playing video games?  That&#x27;s what that was.

I have been trying to come up with a better blindfold for blindfold 
competitions but every time I go on the internet to buy blindfolds, I 
get a whole bunch of sex stores.  What do other blindfold competitions 
use as their blindfolds?

          <div class="email-content">Oh, actually, now I think about it, you haven&#x27;t actually felt our 
blindfolds.  They actually suck quite a bit.  Though they&#x27;re &#x27;easy&#x27; to 
put on, they&#x27;re really tight and it&#x27;s actually almost impossible to 
open your eyes while wearing those things.  The elastic bands put a lot 
of pressure on the eyes themselves.  Yeah, our blindfold sucks, but you 
definitely can&#x27;t see through them and you can barely open your eyes 
with them on.

Yeah but next time maybe it&#x27;ll be during a break (ok ok... but *I* do 
have breaks ;-). I really don&#x27;t doubt you at all, I&#x27;d just like to 
have blindfolds that are easy to see for everybody they make cheating 
impossible. I even/especially want one for myself, too, even though 
I&#x27;m 100% sure I don&#x27;t cheat ;-). I don&#x27;t want anybody to be able to 
say I might cheat.

There&#x27;s a big German TV show called &quot;Wetten, dass?&quot; (&quot;I bet that...&quot;) 
where people try all kinds of stuff. Often they&#x27;re blindfolded, e.g. 
when they bet they can recognize 200 different chairs by sitting on 
them. They get blindfolded and then they have to recognize five or so. 
They always use swimming/diving goggles. Since it&#x27;s a really 
well-known show in Germany, using these goggles for blindfolding 
someone might be called the de facto standard for blindfolding someone 
in Germany ;-)

Nah, that&#x27;s not good. There have been magicians who put on a blindfold 
and then in addition to that put a trash bag or two over their head 
and then drive around the city in a car. One way to do it is take off 
the blindfold after the bag is over the head, so you only have to look 
through the bag. Also, you could hide huge headphones in your bag so 
someone in the audience could tell you instructions. No no, I want to 
see your face/head ;-).  Just the eyes should be covered, and covered 
very well.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m trying to improve my F2L before November, but there are a few<br>
cases I&#x27;m having trouble with.<br>
<br>
Here are four cases I need help with. Try these on a solved cube:<br>
<br>
1) F&#x27; U&#x27; F U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F U&#x27;<br>
<br>
2) R U R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U<br>

<br>
4) F&#x27; U F U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U<br>
<br>
How do you solve these cases when the pieces are in the wrong slot?<br>
Does anyone have any good algorithms for that? Any help would be<br>
appreciated.<br>

I wrote brother/sister so you could combine it the way you wanted. 
In our case it&#x27;s brother/brother.

For each of those cases, if they were in the wrong slot, I would pair
up exactly like the alg you use and then just place them in the spot
where they need to go.

So you use the same idea, pair up, but then place into its correct
spot wherever that is.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Casey,

Yeah, it was a huge revelation to me when I was about your speed when I 
first learned that.  Each one of those algorithms is 8 moves longs I 
think.  The first four moves of the algorithm pair up the corner and 
edge.  It either pairs them up together, or it pairs it up so that it 
can be put in with a R U R&#x27; or something like that.  So do the first 
half of the algorithm and get the two pieces in the top layer.  Then, 
just do the according U turn, line it up, and put it in.  Hopefully 
this helps!

edge.  It either pairs them up together, or it pairs it up so that it 
can be put in with a R U R&#x27; or something like that.  So do the first

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I used to do F2L intuitively but now I&#x27;m learning to use
algorithms instead. When cases that I don&#x27;t recognize very well come
up (like when the pieces are in the wrong slot), I still try to solve
them intuitively. It&#x27;s going to take some practice before I can quit
doing that, but my F2L should end up a lot faster.

Oh yeah, two days ago I got a 19.86 second average. I normally average
24, so that was very weird, kind of like my sub-30 average in Dallas.
But I really don&#x27;t mind. :-D Anyway, thanks for the help.

You&#x27;ve never seen that before?
How someone uses swimming goggles?

I&#x27;d say not really cumbersome, but you probably need to pull them away 
from the face, then move them down, then put them on the face (eyes) 
again. Not just slide down like yours. So it takes a little longer but 
not much.

The last sound you hear was my brother making an exclamation.  When I 
was blindfolded, I thought he was saying, &quot;OOOH!  SO CLOSE!&quot; but it was 
muffled because there were other competitors still solving at that time 
so I really expected the cube to be one move off when I was done.

Just watch Leyan hit a 1:39 on 10/22.  This one will be boring.

Gaetan can do it, but he uses magic! I&#x27;ve been spending too much time
practicing 3-cycles, I haven&#x27;t given magic a shot.

I mean solving a cube BLD that fast, or faster, is not very hard.  I
did 18 seconds solving BLD using Fridrich as my method.  My
memorization time was almost 2 hours, but still the solve time was
under 27 seconds.

I mean just based on what you said I don&#x27;t think 27 seconds is
unreasonable for a BLD solve.

Maybe I don&#x27;t fully understand what you are talking about?

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

There are 2 different ways of doing blindfold (BLD) solve as far as 
i have understood.

1)The total time for a solve is the total of inspection time pluss 
solving. This is what is normal in competitions.

2)Inspect the cube for a long time and derive how to speedsolve it 
by &quot;tracking&quot; each piece in ur head move by move. Then when ready 
time only the solve ;-) This is what Chris Hardwick is talking about.

You (other) Chrs (lol) probably mean the first one ...

Cheers!

-Per

PS! Btw, Geir Ugelstad is complaining that BLD is sorta his 
invention and that competitions should do BLD the way he first did 
it, which is the second method: long inspection and fast solve. I 
guess the first method is more spectator friendly, and hence the way 
it is currently done :-)

Ok, there are 3 ways then :

1)inspection + solve total time

2)long inspection, time only the solve

3)team blindfold

          <div class="email-content">The second method of BLD is only a physical exercise assuming you can 
handle the mental part.  But since it doesn&#x27;t matter how long it takes 
you to memorize, let&#x27;s assume everyone can memorize the cube and see 
all the way through the solve.  Then it really is nothing more than 
just speed solving.  What&#x27;s the point of having a competition like that 
which takes up so much time?

The first method of BLD really tests the prowess of a competitor&#x27;s 
memory.  It is the art of short term memory combined with physical 
execution.  Much more elegant in my opinion than a brute force memory 
and a brute force solve.

the person who memorized in 15 minutes wins.  They should be equal.

Ha! Let&#x27;s talk about speedsolving then.

If one person takes 15 seconds to preinspect a cube, and another 
person takes 0 seconds to preinspect a cube, and they both solve in 18 
seconds, well, I think the person who preinspected in 0 seconds wins.

The question: Why is preinspection not part of the time in 
speedsolving but in blindsolving it is?

          <div class="email-content">Preinspection servers a far different role in speed solving than it 
does for blindfold solving.  In speed solving, preinspection is used to 
maintain regularity throughout all the competitors.  In blindfold 
solving, inspection is an integral part of the solve.  In blindfold 
solving, we are saying that &quot;memorizing a cube in a fast amount of time 
is an accomplished task.&quot;  This it not the same in speed solving where 
we give the competitor a set period of time, and we let them accomplish 
as much as they choose to in that set period of time.

The two are used quite differently.  Just so you know, the argument 
that &quot;it&#x27;s how a random person would do it&quot; does not hold.  Yesterday, 
a guy threw the cube to me, had me solve, and then started timing.  
Should we do it that way for everyone?  (It&#x27;s how you might see it on 
TV... damn that lighting was bad.)

Hi all,<br>
<br>
I have discoverd Ning, an online application builder. It is pretty <br>
cool. I have added an algorithm database, that anyone can use. You <br>
can define your own list of algorithms, tag them, name them, give <br>
them a description, view everyone&#x27;s algs, etc.<br>
<br>
See it live here, and sign up if you like to add algs:<br>
http://alglist.ning.com/index.php<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s pretty easy for me to add properties, so if you have any ideas <br>
let me know.<br>
<br>
This way we can build a huge online database...<br>
<br>
Right now an alg has:<br>
- alias (e.g. Sune)<br>
- description<br>
- definition (the moves, in Harris notation)<br>
- HTM length<br>
- tags<br>
- view only: a link from the alg to a rubikapplet<br>
 <br>
Some ideas I have, to add to the list, and you can all vote for or <br>
against:<br>
- inventor<br>
- first seen in<br>
- url to yahoo group post<br>
- url to your site<br>
- url to alg on your site<br>
- generated image (using cubeimage)<br>
- other metrics<br>
- link to mirror, link to reverse<br>
<br>
Some things I haven&#x27;t figured out how to do yet:<br>
- searching on different properties<br>
- find out if the alg is the same as another alg<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to keep it simple, so I don&#x27;t want properties to be <br>
required (except for definition of course duh).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

One suggestion. Lets standardise to put a space in between each 
move &quot;token group&quot;. hence an alg will look like this w the proper 
spaces :

R U&#x27; F2 D r F&#x27; ... etc

Much more readable this way :-)

Umm, do u mean u have a problem to verify if 2 algs have the same 
effect? Or u really mean similar algs, like F U D2 L2 and F D2 U L2. 
These are similar cause moves on an axis can be written in any 
order. This problem can be avoided with a smart script i guess. 

Impose an ordering on the moves on same axes. Like this for 3x3x3 
cube :

R > M > L
F > S > B
U > E > D

and then always write the largest token first when several moves on 
same axis appear as a consecutive group of moves. 

Which means that F U D2 L2 will be the correct way and not F D2 U L2 
cause it violates the ordering :-)

Cheers!

Why would it not be &quot;regular&quot; (definition?) without preinspection?

          <div class="email-content">I have a couple sites hosted by http://www.hostingrevolution.com/

My plan is 250 megs with 15 gigs of transfer/month. Only 40 bux a 
year!!! The domain is an extra 12, so only 52 bux a year for a great 
host plus domain. They have lower and higher packages and all of 
them include php/mysql/phpadmin/fantastico/unlimited email... pretty 
much all the features you could ever want.

If the UF edge is in the DF slot,

d8/ d7/ u9/ d5/ d7/ u3/
/ u9/ d5/ d7/ u3/ d5/ (d1)

will do the job optimally.  Notation: e.g., d8 means (0,-4) and u3 
means (3,0).

Those are 2 distinct sequences, of course -- sorry for any confusion!

Yes i know Anssi :-) But quite often here a topic is transformed as

But his father is really slow ;-)

Ha, that&#x27;s great! Thanks Richard and Mike! Just two days ago I tried 
solving a Square-1 again and it took me 20+ minutes because I had 
forgotten all algorithms. I solve the first layer intuitively and 
placing the last edge of the first layer took me ages because I tried 
to remember my old alg and just couldn&#x27;t, then I came up with a new 
way but I can&#x27;t reproduce it again ;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Oh... that&#x27;s nice.  Do you know roughly how many turns it takes you on 
average to do the first layer intuitively?  Have you learnt all 
sequences for the last layer?

          <div class="email-content">I cannot figure out why this happened to you. 

My experience is that I strung the magic with the linked rings upside using a similar method explained in the twistypuzzles.com articles database. You can find it under the normal 2x4 tiles magic. With that orientation, I couldn&#x27;t solve it with Stephan&#x27;s method. Then I did the same but with the linked rings downside and it *magically* worked fine !

So I recommend you to take a look to the articles section in twistypuzzles website.

Maybe the *old* style is better for left-handed people?

I mean the edge solution is independent of the corners (duh! it is a 
corners-first method).  Actually not complete separation, the way you 
BLD experts do it.

&quot;Ma méthode des coins permet de préserver les bords sur chacune des 
rangées ainsi que l&#x27;orientation de ceux-ci, par l&#x27;étape 2 et 3. J&#x27;ai 
acquis une indépendance entre les coins et les bords du cube. L&#x27;é
tape 1 est plus difficile car elle demande d&#x27;anticiper la position de 
plusieurs bords. Je dois me concentrer un long moment avant de ré
soudre le cube sans regarder. Et je n&#x27;ai pas mis ce moment sur vidéo 
par platitude et faute d&#x27;espace. J&#x27;utilise une toute autre méthode 
pour résoudre les bords du cube. L&#x27;animateur (témoin) et le public 
ne trichent pas. J&#x27;ai plusieurs vidéos TV. Je garde mon secret et si 
vous croyez que je triche. Allez devant un public à la télévision 
faire le truc!&quot;

(&quot;My corner method allows one to preserve the edges in each row 
[slice, I think] as well as their orientation in stages 2 and 3. I 
have acquired an independence between the corners and the edges of 
the cube. Stage 1 is the most difficult because it requires one to 
anticipate the position of several edges. I have to concentrate for a 
long time before solving the cube without looking. And I have not 
included this moment in the video because of its banality and of lack 
of space. I use a different method to solve the edges of the cube. 
The host (witness) and the public don&#x27;t cheat. I have several TV 
videos. I guard my secret, and if you believe that I cheat, go in 
front of the public on television and do the trick!&quot;)

Something like that. I can understand how a corner method like his 
would be much easier to use for blindfold cubing than Fridrich 
method. Of course, I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t be like 1 min or 2 min 
memorization, but would 10-15 min be possible? I guess it&#x27;s hard to 
say without knowing his edge method for blindfold cubing.

He&#x27;s said that he will be at WC, so perhaps we&#x27;ll have a chance to 
ask him then.

Oh, I have no idea :-). But I&#x27;ve never been fast. Fastest average was 
1:15 or 1:30 (for the whole puzzle, I mean). My &quot;method&quot;:

- make cube
- make UR quarter puzzle placing the four pieces one by one
- solve UL corners
- add remaining 3 U edges
- x2 puzzle rotation
- solve corners by swapping two adjacent ones
- solve edges with transpositions (like I think Ron explains on SCC)
- fix parity

But it&#x27;s all very slow and lengthy. I hate it that I can&#x27;t solve this 
puzzle much with intuition. So I don&#x27;t really practice and forget all 
algorithms. I prefer Megaminx, 99.9% intuitive and explainable ;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Am I the only one who might not come or why is it so important? ;-)

Yeah it&#x27;s true, I might just not have the money. Right now I&#x27;m under 
zero and I haven&#x27;t paid my 700 Euros university fees yet so they might 
throw me out soon, and I haven&#x27;t paid flight/hotel for RWC either.

And actually recently something happened that also made me somewhat 
dislike Florida: http://shootfirstlaw.org
I don&#x27;t say I really fear greater danger with it now, but the 
mentality is just too absurd for me. Don&#x27;t know how living in USA 
(particularly Florida) is, I&#x27;ve only been there on vacation. I&#x27;ve 
lived in Canada for a while but from &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; I 
remember some differences between the two countries. How often do 
people actually carry guns in public places in USA/Florida? My whole 
life I&#x27;ve never seen a real gun in real life except on belts of the 
police...

          <div class="email-content">It is rare for people to carry guns.  The US is quite free about
allowing people to purchase firearms (after being fingerprinted and
with a background check).  I have my own permit to purchase firearms.
:P  Does the Florida thing actually make you fear the US more than the
assault rifle ban that expired?

What do you mean: is in the file here? The files section??? I&#x27;ll 
have a look.

And you are free to add any notation in your alg, or add algs for 
4x4x4 or any other puzzle. In the future I can implement other 
features, like e.g. the 4x4 and 5x5 applet, and a property 
for &#x27;notation&#x27; and one for &#x27;puzzle&#x27;. Although it&#x27;s hard to create a 
valid list. My first guess is it&#x27;s best to leave it free form, but 
that also means I cannot automate anything.
 Big problems for a little man. Anyway, I find Harris notation the 
most flexible, since it does allow for xyzMESdrlbuf and * (in case 
you didn&#x27;t know). You should avoid [] and sub/superscript.

Yeah I guess so. It&#x27;s just that... how can they make *that* a law? 
Guns should be forbidden. Period. *That* should be the law. I don&#x27;t 
want to have anything to do with people who like guns.

          <div class="email-content">While this seems like an odd place to debate the pros and cons of the
Second Ammendment, I might as well throw my two cents into the fray.

The right to bear arms comes from a time when owning firearms was
generally necessary, except for the priveliged.  Nowadays, it really
only serves for sport and for crime.  If guns weren&#x27;t available except
to law enforcement, the overall instance of gun related crime would be
significantly lower.  However, our long in need of an overhaul
government (by its creators&#x27; admission) is very static and difficult
to enact change in, so the odds of anything been done to change this
anytime soon are slim to none.

Basically, gun owning is pointless these days, save sport (who are we
to judge, really?), and even then it&#x27;s rather dangerous.  But nothing
is going to change because no one wants to change the laws.

Charleton Heston would be angry, anyway...

          <div class="email-content">You know, you could look at your WC2005 visit as one person without a <br>
gun showing Florida by example how you can live without one. You&#x27;re <br>
certainly not going to change any Floridian minds by staying away!<br>
<br>
When I moved to the US in 1995, I spent many months being terrified of <br>
muggers, car jackers, police and crazy violent people on drugs that I <br>
had been told were roaming the streets in an endless bloodbath. <br>
Eventually boredom took over and I realized there was not really much <br>
to worry about. I have yet to see a gun not worn by police or military. <br>
Then again my apartment in San Francisco became available since the <br>
previous tenant got murdered with a shotgun inside it. There *is* much <br>
more violent crime here, but most of it is criminals killing each <br>
other, and even so it&#x27; less common than dying in traffic. Not a big <br>
factor in most peoples life.<br>
<br>
Maybe others with experience of both European media and US life have <br>
different views, but personally I think it&#x27;s undeniable that European <br>
media gives a really exaggerated and weird picture of the violent <br>
nature of life here, and got me quite needlessly scared. US media does <br>
too, to a lesser extent, but it&#x27;s balanced by it&#x27;s audience actually <br>
living here....<br>
<br>
So you could also view your trip to WC2005 as a way to check for <br>
yourself how things really are.<br>
<br>
Only if you don&#x27;t make the trip will you have no way of looking at it :)<br>

&gt;  Is it only going to be limited to one notation scheme? I use a <br>
&gt; lot of slice moves and use small case letters to mean slices. The <br>
&gt; notation I use, is in the file here.<br>
<br>
Michiel:<br>
&gt; Big problems for a little man. Anyway, I find Harris notation the <br>
&gt; most flexible, since it does allow for xyzMESdrlbuf and * (in case <br>
&gt; you didn&#x27;t know). You should avoid [] and sub/superscript.<br>
<br>
I am in the middle of working on &quot;Algorithm Transformer&quot;,<br>
with which you can rotate, mirror, or inverse an algorithm.<br>
It currently use JSCC notation only, but I have a plan to add<br>
translation among different notations.<br>
<br>
Though no document or help is available yet, you can look at it<br>
http://unyun.dyndns.org/mad-p/cube/algo.htm<br>
It is a pure Javascript program and you can download it to your local machine.<br>
<br>
Quick Usage:<br>
1. Enter your algorithm in topmost area and click &quot;Set&quot;.<br>
2. Click on &quot;Inverse&quot;, &quot;Mirror&quot; to see these versions<br>
3. To change a turn into a double-layer-turn, first click the<br>
   check box under the turn and click &quot;Toggle W&quot;.<br>
4. To insert whole cube rotation, check where it should be, then &quot;Rotate&quot;<br>
5. You can gather algorithms with cube state image by &quot;Add to Collection&quot;.<br>
   &quot;Printable&quot; opens a new window good for printing.<br>
   You can save your collection with &quot;HTML Source&quot; or &quot;Text Only&quot;<br>
   (copy-and-paste into notepad).<br>
6. You can get a link for the current configuration from &quot;Bookmark&quot; link.<br>
   Example: http://unyun.dyndns.org/mad-p/cube/algo.htm?txt=Dw%27%20M%27%20U2%20Rw%20U%27%20Lw%20U2%20Rw%27%20U%20L%27%20R2%20B2%20R2%20u%27&amp;cubeDescApplet=true&amp;bfdschememacky=true&amp;imgrev=true&amp;imgmem=true<br>
<br>
Other planned ideas:<br>
- split/join of slice moves (M -&gt; R&#x27; L)<br>
- don&#x27;t throw away FSC-hints (parens, hyphens, etc)<br>
- separate scrambler functionality into a new script<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Lars!

Even though u have good points, the main reason for Stefan not 
coming was that he has no money to pay for the trip. The fear of 
guns, im not quite sure, but i guess it was just a subsidiary 
reason. I also dislike american culture and much of its mentality 
very much. But for me the world championship and the chance to meet 
a lot of ppl, including u Lars, far outweighs that :-) Yes, i 
already have the plane tickets and hotel room booked ;-)

On the serious side. Someone should tell the americans that not 
everyone is against them. That&#x27;s how they seem to act right now. It 
seems most issues are reasoned by fear of everyone and everything. A 
country where u get thrown out of an airplane cause u have a t-shirt 
making fun of the president is not a nice place IMHO. If ppl think 
that wearing guns gives them some kinda freedom they are very wrong. 
Since ur &quot;enemies&quot; will also wear them it won&#x27;t help at all. It will 
just serve to escalate violence. U can&#x27;t use what u haven&#x27;t got to 
put it that way.

Ok, this should be cubing forum so i will stop it here ;-)

Cheers!

Just in case you meant that &quot;also&quot; referring to me: I do like many 
things in America. There are just some I really don&#x27;t like. If you 
subtract those, it&#x27;s cool. And called Canada.

Actually if the career criminal comes to my house and knows I have no 
gun, why should he want to fire his? Give him what he wants and let 
him leave. I&#x27;d rather not get into a gun-fight. And I&#x27;d rather not 
shoot my brother when he comes for a surprise visit.

Guns don&#x27;t kill people, people kill people. How else can you kill an
elk, with a stick? I personally love guns, but I hate murderers. 

I doubt you&#x27;d have anything to worry about in Orlando, it&#x27;s the magic

Oakland, California.

I hope you don&#x27;t get kicked out of school.

Question, maybe somebody knows: In &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, numbers of 
people killed with guns in a year in different countries were 
compared. I think in European countries and Canada and some others, it 
was always around 30-300. For USA, then number was over 11,000. The 
question: Are these numbers correct?

Hmm, not sure I need to kill an elk to live a happy life.

Too bad I&#x27;m not vegetarian so I can&#x27;t honestly argue that way 
completely. Well, I never said I have something against police having 
guns. Those (I hope) are educated, trained, responsible, good people. 
Similarly I guess I&#x27;d find it ok for trained people getting food 
(hunting for fun is something I can&#x27;t understand). But guns in 
households just like a cube? Maybe accessible to children? I know I 
certainly don&#x27;t want a gun. Maybe (only maybe) when war breaks out 
here, but I prefer to believe it won&#x27;t.

Stefan

P.S. And yeah, sorry I started this off-topic ;-). Last post from me 
about it, I promise.

things, i for one, think george bush is a retard, and<br>
seriously cried when he was re elected.  everyone<br>
seems to think that everyone over here is a rich, gun<br>
toting, spastic asshole and that&#x27;s not really the<br>
case.  i am doing what everyone else in the world is<br>
trying to do..just get by, and live my life.  i didn&#x27;t<br>
choose here, but i&#x27;m damn glad i&#x27;m here because i<br>
think this is the greatest nation on earth, that<br>
doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re perfect and don&#x27;t make mistakes,<br>
but i love this country, and don&#x27;t say bad things<br>
about other countries that may or may not be inferior<br>
to ours. we do a lot for the world, and if everyone<br>
focuses on the bad that comes along with that so be<br>
it, but think about where the tv monitor your using,<br>
the internet you are on, the plane you&#x27;ll be flying to<br>
the worlds on and many other important things have<br>
come from.  can&#x27;t be all bad, eh?   maybe everyone<br>
should lighten up and not make assumptions based on<br>
things you&#x27;ve never seen or make such broad<br>
generalizations as &quot;everyone hates your country&quot;. now<br>
if you excuse me i have to go pack some ammo for the<br>
world championships.<br>

I was wondering about this and even though I&#x27;m pretty sure that the<br>
answer is that there is a 2 sec penalty, I wanted to ask you about this :<br>

When you stop the timer and the cube needs a U2 move to be solved : is<br>
that a 2sec penalty case ? or a DNF case ?<br>

problem I have is sort of a silly one.

Is there any chance of having bright orange stickers for the 4x4 at or
before WC?  They&#x27;re fantastic on my 3x3, and now my bigger cubes look
sort of...dull.

Also what are the odds of a different shade of green (say...like on
Trevor Holland&#x27;s guide or Gilles Roux&#x27;s page)?

I bet I know of at least 1 person very interested.

If you finish 10 moves away does that incur just a 10 second penalty, I wonder?

Following this logic, a cube can be 19 moves away when it&#x27;s fully<br>
scrambled, so does this mean you can get a sub-20 time if you make no<br>
moves on the cube?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yay! My first time EVER restickering my cube was with Cubesmith stickers :D! I LOVE them and they do wonders with my cube. I got the &quot;textured&quot; ones and they work GREAT! I did it in school, so about 10 people literally stopped what they were doing, watched me stick&#x27;em on, and were like, &quot;They SELL those?!&quot; I promptly recommended cubesmith&#x27;s website to many &quot;noncubers&quot; who just seemed to be interested in &quot;modifying&quot; their old cubes rather than learning how to solve them :p.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi.<br>
Let me introduce myself. I&#x27;m Gustavo Cerezo, aged 17, from Buenos<br>
Aires, Argentina. I&#x27;m not a world class cuber (yet), but I&#x27;m soon<br>
going to learn JF&#x27;s OLL and PLL and I guess that&#x27;ll help.<br>
I&#x27;m writing here to let you know that Tomás Mansilla, my classmate,<br>
aged 17, made a very easy tutorial for solving the 3x3x3 cube<br>
blindfolded usung STIFF_HAND&#x27;s method. Since I know some english, I<br>
offered to translate it into english (the original one is in spanish),<br>
and here you have the link. It&#x27;s in the speedubing.com.ar page, the<br>
first page about speedcubing in Argentina (and the southernmost in the<br>
world I may add), I suggest all spanish speaking cubers check it out.<br>
Although it&#x27;s not finished, and Santiago Mansilla (the webmaster and<br>
Tomas&#x27; brother) isn&#x27;t a profesional web page designer, it&#x27;s definitely<br>
worth taking a look.<br>
Ok, I&#x27;ll stop boring you, here&#x27;s the link to the Tomas Mansilla BLD<br>
tutorial:<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com.ar/BLDENG.htm<br>
Here&#x27;s the spanish version (the original one) for all spanish speaking<br>
cubers:<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com.ar/BLD.htm<br>
<br>
Personally, I found this the clearest, most straightforward tutorial,<br>
and thus, the easiest one. It also has a list of cool algs to improve<br>
your speed.<br>
<br>
Well, hope you enjoy, see you later.<br>
<br>
PD: If you ask, maybe I&#x27;ll say more about myself, I didn&#x27;t want to<br>
make this post too long.<br>

I do have the florescent orange available for the 4x4 and 5x5.  I 
also have a nice bright green that might fit your needs.  I will get 
them up on my site tonight, as I have been meaning to do it for a

4x4 tiles listed as well, and I&#x27;ve had those ready for about 2 weeks.

          <div class="email-content">In which metric are you counting?  Also what is your goal as far as
time goes?  I&#x27;ve noticed that I seem to average around 2 moves per
second roughly (maybe a little less), so 232 moves would be about 1:56
on average at full speed (unless you turn faster of course).

I would say that I average around 120-130 moves or so, maybe 130-140
if I don&#x27;t see optimal stuff during the solve.

I count in this metric:
   1.  Inner slice moves turned with its adjacent outer layer is
counted as one move (D d), (U u) etc.
   2. Turning an inner slice by first turning the double layer, then
undoing the outer move counts as 2 moves (D d) D&#x27; = d counts as 2 moves
   3. Turning an inner layer by itself using my finger to turn it
counts as 1 move
   4. All outer layer turns (and inner layer turns) are counted as in HTM

I would say that 230-ish seems a little high if you are going for
sub-2:00 or faster, but then again that depends on your turning speed.

I would suggest solving slowly for a while and just trying to solve
for fewest moves.  After a while you should find some cool ways to cut
down moves for your method.  Then once you have a few new tricks time
yourself for a while and see if that helped.

If it did try again and knock off a few more moves and see if it helps
too.

230-ish is not horrible, but if you are shooting for sub-2:00 then I
would suggest to cut down the number of moves (or if you turn faster
than I do then maybe you might get faster even with your current mvoe
count).

Just my two cents, hope it helps.

Chris

 That is to say, the rule says if you are off by one move then you get
a 2 second penalty.  A U2 is considered a single move during the
contest in the context of scrambling, so I think it should be
considered a single move in this context as well.

The rules do define it:

&quot;If a side is misaligned by more than the above criteria, then that 
side is considered one turn away. If a cube is one turn from 
completion, 2 seconds will be added to the solve time. In all other 
cases, the solve is disqualified.&quot;

I understand it as:

- U2 is considered one turn away. That&#x27;s all. Results in a 2 seconds 
penalty.

- U D is considered two turns away because both the U side and the D 
side are considered one turn away and I assume they&#x27;re added So this 
would be DNF. Now what about U D&#x27;, I bet some slicers might get angry 
to get a DNF for an E misalignment ;-)

I&#x27;ve seen that picture with the pink lady somewhere before... but it 
looks like the &quot;Giant Cube from 1982 World&#x27;s Fair, outside the East 
Tennessee Historical Center&quot; (Knoxville?)

For a different view, see

Y&#x27;know, I simply can&#x27;t believe that I bothered to look that up. :(

Also, I&#x27;m gonna grab one of those plastic sticker things. Should come

Sometimes, they don&#x27;t want just money. Sometimes they want to rape.

I agree. There should be plenty of trained responsible, good people
with guns in a society to counter balance bad people with guns.

I know... if someone comes to rape me, I will show them my fastest
solve with the cube. They will be so amazed, their heart will change
and they will ask me to teach them and we will become friends. :)

&quot;That guy&quot; will be happy to answer your questions ;-)

The two pictures are completely independent, so sometimes I just scale 
it down but sometimes I use different pictures for gallery and head of 
auction page. And sometimes I write something on it.

Btw, ebay is full of traps. Compare these two:
http://search.ebay.co.uk/_W0QQsassZstefanQ5fpochmann
http://search.ebay.de/_W0QQsassZstefanQ5fpochmann
See how different the pictures look?

In the past I had used German ebay, now I&#x27;m trying UK. In German ebay 
the limit for gallery pictures is 80x80 so I scaled all my gallery 
pictures to that size. Then I saw UK ebay apparently has a limit of 
64x64, scaling my pictures further and making them look ugly! I can&#x27;t 
fix the pictures for auctions that already have bids but I&#x27;ve started 
fixing the others. Then I noticed that in German ebay my old gallery 
pictures are shown correctly as 80x80! Gah, this is just so annoying. 
Either I submit 64x64, then my pictures are smaller than necessary in 
German ebay, or I submit 80x80, then they look ugly in UK ebay. I 
can&#x27;t win in both! Ok, next auction I&#x27;ll try submitting a large 
pictures, maybe that one will look good scaled down by ebay both to 
64x64 and 80x80.

Sigh...

Oh, and you asked why that guy does those fast twists. He does that 
and also show the video in order to show that it&#x27;s a real good cube. 
You know, 90% of all sellers claim their cubes are superb and 
supersmooth or something like that. Yeah right. I claim that&#x27;s just 
because they&#x27;ve never had a speedcube and they just don&#x27;t know what 
supersmooth and the like really mean... just my personal 
opinion/experience, of course.

Cheers!

Ok ok, I&#x27;ve looked at a few again and admit that number was way too 
high. Most sellers don&#x27;t say anything about the quality.

I won&#x27;t speak for the board, but that&#x27;s my interp also.  IIRC, not too 
long ago, that the Rubiks folks (or some powers-that-be) wanted all 
cubes to have the &quot;official color scheme.&quot;  Several people balked, and 
someone fought on behalf of the balkers - and won.  I can&#x27;t find the

Yes - I think it is proven to be between 26 and 42.
For HTM, I believe the range is from 20 to 29.

In particular, in HTM it hasn&#x27;t been shown to be greater than 20.

          <div class="email-content">Ok this is just my guess, sombody please correct the probably glaring
mistakes.

If you look at the corners you have two groups of corners (call them A
and B corners).

The A corners are UBL, DFL, DBR, UFR and the B corners are UBR, UFL,
DBL, DFR.

&quot;A&quot; corners can only be in A corner spots and B corners only in B
corners spots.

Any double turn will affect the parity of both A corners and B
corners, so the parity of the A corners must be the same as the B corners.

So the corners have 4!*4*3 positions.

Now the edges.  There are three rings of edges, corresponding to the
edges on the slices M,E, and S.

Pieces can only be on their respective rings.  So you have A, B, and C
rings.

A double turn will affect the parity of two rings, so all the parity
situations are 

A B C
-----
E E E
E O O
O E O
O O E

So you can give two rings independent parity, but the parity of the
third is required to be set based on the parity of the first two.

So the edges have 4!*4!*4*3 positions.

However, it is a requirement of the cube that the total corner and
total edge permutations have the same parity.

So you have to divide by two to account for our overcount of positions.

So my guess is there are: (4!)^3*(12)^2*(1/2) = 995 328

This of course assumes that the permutations of the corners and edges
are wholly indepent of eachother (other than the general requirement
that the overall permutations of corners and edges have to be the
same), and I don&#x27;t know if that is true or not.  I can&#x27;t think of any
sequences in double turn only metric that swap just corners and leave
edges alone.

So this is my guess basically, don&#x27;t quote me on that number.

year or so ago that it is impossible to 3-cycle corners in the same
group (A or B corners).

So the positions for the corners should read: 4!*4

So the total number should be one third my first guess, or 331 776
which is ((4!)^3*4*4*3)/2

          <div class="email-content">>From ACube:
U2 F2 U2 L2 F2 L2 F2 D2 B2 D2 L2 B2 L2 B2

Can be used on the correct axis to setup all 4 possible permutations
among say B group corners after the A group corners have been permuted.

So the corners definitely have 4!*4 positions (since we proved a while
back that a three cycle is impossible).

Also from ACube:
R2 B2 R2 D2 L2 F2 L2 D2

three cycles the edges within a ring without affecting the other rings
(or corners).

You could intuitively setup the A corners into any of the 24
permutations, then use the alg above to setup the 4 situations for B
corners for each A corner permutation.

Now the corners are either odd or even (total permutation) and the
edge must be the same.

So you can setup two rings into all 24 positions, but the 3rd ring
will have to have the parity that gives the edges the same parity as
the corners (total permutation).

To change the parity of two rings do R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 on the right axis.

So that third ring only has 4*3 possible positions.

So the cube with only double turns has

4!*4*4!^2*4*3 with no adjustment for the corner/edge parity because we
took care of that with the third edge ring.

So I&#x27;m fairly certain there should be: 663 552 positions possible.

Emne: SV: [Speed cubing group] Re: diameter



>From ACube:
U2 F2 U2 L2 F2 L2 F2 D2 B2 D2 L2 B2 L2 B2

Can be used on the correct axis to setup all 4 possible permutations
among say B group corners after the A group corners have been permuted.

So the corners definitely have 4!*4 positions (since we proved a while
back that a three cycle is impossible).

Also from ACube:
R2 B2 R2 D2 L2 F2 L2 D2

three cycles the edges within a ring without affecting the other rings
(or corners).

You could intuitively setup the A corners into any of the 24
permutations, then use the alg above to setup the 4 situations for B
corners for each A corner permutation.

Now the corners are either odd or even (total permutation) and the
edge must be the same.

So you can setup two rings into all 24 positions, but the 3rd ring
will have to have the parity that gives the edges the same parity as
the corners (total permutation).

To change the parity of two rings do R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 on the right
axis.

So that third ring only has 4*3 possible positions.

So the cube with only double turns has

4!*4*4!^2*4*3 with no adjustment for the corner/edge parity because we
took care of that with the third edge ring.

So I&#x27;m fairly certain there should be: 663 552 positions possible.

I&#x27;m staying at the Holiday Inn too (sharing a room with Sean). I live
pretty close from Eindhoven, so basically staying at the hotel is just
for fun. I can arrive at any time saturday, just let me know when you
arive and we can meet. I know Dan Harris will arive around 19:45, and
Sean and Jaap are coming to Eindhoven quite early but will go shopping.
So if anyone wants to meet earlier in the afternoon, let me know and
I&#x27;ll be there.

Also have a look at the last section of this page:
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube3.htm

Solving with double turns only is exactly the last step of 
Thistlethwaite&#x27;s algorithm.

Yes, it counts that move.

You can check this by looking carefully at Dan Harris&#x27;s table -- there 
are 15 positions at a distance of 1 turn from solved.  If the &quot;ADF&quot; 
move /wasn&#x27;t/ counted, that number would be 12: for each of the 4 cross 
pieces, there are 3 possible positions from which it could be inserted 
into the cross in 1 move.

<br>
My advice is get yourself an original Ideal Toy<br>
cube. I&#x27;ve tried the Studio cubes, Berkshire Works<br>
cubes from UK, 25th anniversary cubes... I ended<br>
up using a old Rubik&#x27;s Game cube. Both are very<br>
nice... the tiles on the deluxe and Rubik&#x27;s Game<br>
cubes are good to have. <br>
<br>
I see the Ideal Toy cubes on ebay for about $20 to $25<br>
dollars, not too expensive.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d be curious to know which type of cube the sub 15 second<br>
guys are using though :)<br>

 According to the Help/FAQ at the bottom:

4.	My city is invalid! What gives?
Your city isn&#x27;t in our database. We&#x27;ll update the database soon.

I guess your 2 options are to enter a bigger city thats nearby or to
wait until yours is added.

If anyone has problems with it, and needs something to be removed, you

Do you mean all of them are excellent or just the one you have is 
luckily one of the few excellent ones?

Ha, that&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve asked for exactly that a while ago, though in 
the German group I think. I hope they improve it soon. Right now I 
can&#x27;t enter myself, the don&#x27;t know Frankfurt yet, the largest city in 
my area...

          <div class="email-content">Just a day or two ago I told someone how unfriendly I think Germany <br>
is. Today I had another climax that I&#x27;d like to talk about so I can <br>
get over it...<br>
<br>
So I was cubing in the train home like I usually do. Most people don&#x27;t <br>
care, some are interested, very few are annoyed. If they ask me <br>
politely to stop, I will (or move somewhere else). If I sit myself <br>
next to a person who I think wouldn&#x27;t like it, e.g. reading a book, I <br>
don&#x27;t start. And usually I don&#x27;t go full speed unless I&#x27;m really <br>
alone, otherwise I try to cube quietly. Btw, the train itself isn&#x27;t <br>
silent.<br>
<br>
Tonight there was a guy sitting two rows, maybe 4 meters away, and got <br>
very annoyed. I only noticed because all of a sudden he got real <br>
angry, even came to my place, told me we should leave the train so he <br>
can beat me up. He looked stronger than me but if someone approaches <br>
me like that, I see no reason to be considerate so I didn&#x27;t stop <br>
cubing. He also claimed I terribly annoy everybody around. There was <br>
one other guy, sitting much closer to me, not looking annoyed at all. <br>
And I don&#x27;t think I look like people have to be afraid of me when they <br>
ask me to stop cubing. I told him I don&#x27;t think cubing is forbidden or <br>
immoral and I asked him why he doesn&#x27;t simply sit down somewhere else. <br>
He insisted *I* should do that. Btw, he wasn&#x27;t reading or anything <br>
like that. I cube even more quietly now.<br>
<br>
He stood up, went to the door next to me, and I thought he&#x27;d leave. I <br>
stopped cubing for that time because I didn&#x27;t want things to escalate, <br>
and also I was worried he could try to smash or steal my cube before <br>
leaving. But he didn&#x27;t leave. Instead he sat down... guess where... <br>
exactly where he had sat before. That&#x27;s right, the train was almost <br>
empty but he chose to sit down exactly where he came from instead of <br>
taking any other seat.<br>
<br>
When I left the train, he even followed me, threatening me further to <br>
kick my a.. and beat me up. Well, after a minute or two he finally let <br>
me go, but he did frighten me enough to look behind me most of my walk <br>
home.<br>
<br>
Yes, Germany... you gotta love it.<br>

Stefan: Is Germany really that unfriendly in general or were you just 
really unlucky this time? Asses are everywhere, but are there more per 
capita in Germany?

I guess we&#x27;ll have to invent som kind of martial art involving cubes...

          <div class="email-content">I only ever had one person ask me not to cube while we were taking the
trains through Germany and France.  The man was sitting across the
aisle from me.  He seemed very annoyed, despite the loud volume of the
passengers directly behind him, and by the small children playing
handheld electronics games in front of him.

In his defense, he was reading a paper, but the fact that I was cubing
quietly on an almost silent cube makes me wonder if he wasn&#x27;t just
taking his anger out on the easiest subject.  He seemed rather miffed
when he got off the train at the next stop.

I got more far more angry reactions cubing in various places around
Paris than I did anywhere in Germany.

At least, I think they were angry.  My French needs some work...

now, and am finding it quite confusing. The large number of posts make <br>
it pretty difficult for me to follow.<br>
<br>
I have a fair amount of webspace and have considered starting <br>
a &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Forum.&quot; I know that there are a large number of speedcubing <br>
websites out there and I don&#x27;t really believe that there is a need for <br>
any more... but what would you guys/gals think of having a forum? I <br>
don&#x27;t want to bother doing it if no one will use it, or if people <br>
would be offended because it might steal their traffic. Let me have <br>
your HONEST opinions and I&#x27;ll make a decision based on that.<br>
<br>
If this were to happen... the forums would be broken down to <br>
categories... for instance: 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, other puzzles... maybe even <br>
break the 3x3 down into smaller subgroups like: General, Cross, f2l, <br>
LL.<br>

What I am finding however is that I am not really saving many moves <br>
over my old system, (the 7 step method Dan Knight wrote for the 25 <br>
anniversary booklet). The reason for this is that I am consistantly <br>
having to move middle layer edges because they are positioned wrong. I <br>
tried to fix this problem by paying more attention while solving the <br>
cross in order to avoid placing them there, but this resulted in a ~20 <br>
move cross which is just ridiculous. How do you guys work around this?<br>

Maybe he was not annoyed by the sound but by the view, your hands and 
cube colors moving around? Could be he didn&#x27;t see the people behind 
him or the displays of those handhelds...

So far I&#x27;ve lived only in two countries, Germany most of my life and 
Canada (Vancouver to be precise) for 10 months. I think people are 
much more friendly, helpful and open-minded in Canada than in Germany. 
Here&#x27;s something copied from what I&#x27;ve recently written in email about 
Germany:

&quot;Here people are smoking
almost everywhere so I can&#x27;t really go anywhere. I never go out
and I rarely go to restaurants. And Germans have a negative
unfriendly attitude. For example bus drivers I remember to be
very friendly in Canada and very unfriendly here, once for example
I was inside the bus and the driver had already closed the door
even though it was a minute too early and there was a women outside
the front door and obviously wanted to get in and I even told the
bus driver but he didn&#x27;t care. He did answer something (unfriendly)
so I know he has understood me. That&#x27;s just one example. There&#x27;s
unfriendly mood here in Germany. People are happy when they can
make somebody else feel bad. Really. They enjoy it.&quot;

&quot;I don&#x27;t like is how people separate here.
Right next to the streets we have 1 meter wide footways and then
immediately fences or walls. And there are always fences or walls
between the gardens of neighbours! I liked it in Vancouver, there are
green grass stripes between street and footways and usually no fences.
It felt more &quot;open&quot; there. Here in Germany I compensate for that by
walking in the middle of the street where there&#x27;s not much traffic.&quot;

Oh, and have I already mentioned the guy who threatened to beat me up 
when I walked away to avoid his smoke?


> I guess we&#x27;ll have to invent som kind of martial art involving 
cubes...


Yeah, precise high-speed popping ;-)


Btw, in the meantime I&#x27;ve made a decision how to react next time. If 
someone wants me to stop, I&#x27;ll stop (or go somewhere else). No matter 
how they express the request. If it&#x27;s polite, I would stop already 
anyway. If it&#x27;s not polite, I&#x27;d just like to avoid conflicts. I don&#x27;t 
think it&#x27;s right and I don&#x27;t like it (similarly I also don&#x27;t like 
going away from people who smoke in non-smoking areas) but that&#x27;s what 
I&#x27;ll do.

Gah, alright, I just added you ;-). But I won&#x27;t promise to be signed 
in too often, what you&#x27;ve been told is true ;-). I&#x27;m busy with cubing 
and other stuff (ok, so mostly cubing) already and I fear chatting 
would just kill me time-wise. Yes, I do spend a lot of time with this 
group here, but it has the advantages that I can freely choose when to 
do it and I can take my time and also I don&#x27;t have to say good bye at 
the end of a discussion ;-). The latter is btw a real problem, I 
somewhat have trouble ending a discussion...

One thing I thought we might want to have is a 
&quot;speedsolvingrubikscube-offtopic&quot; group/forum, then we could fight our 
fights about guns, photoreading, etc over there ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,<br>
<br>
I experienced something like that too! Once i was speedcubing in a<br>
train and two guys ( in bomberjacken ;) ) got annoyed by it. They<br>
didnt spoke to me or asked me to stop. Just the one guy said something<br>
like: Oh this guy with his cube is going on ma nerves. As i didn&#x27;t<br>
react in any way he threw an empty beer tin in my direction. mmh. ...I<br>
dont think it is only the sound of our cubes which lets those kind of<br>
ppl react like this. But i really dunno. <br>
To be fair: It was a single event. Its not like i get threatened every<br>
time when i cube in the train. Most times ppl just ignore it. <br>
Children seem to be the only ones to react positive almost every time.<br>
mmh..but then they grow up and wear bomberjackets, haha. who knows...<br>
<br>
Did ppl from other countries experience something like that?<br>
<br>
ah...btw.. i won&#x27;t come to the german nationals. For lacking money<br>
being one reason and have to concentrate on ma study being another.<br>
Eh...and..i ...lost..my ...good ..cube..tooo..its soo sad.<br>
I bought a 25anniversary for 13 euros and it quite sucks at<br>
speedcubing. U cant train with a bad cube as it just frustrates and<br>
hurts your hands.<br>
But good luck to all the competitors!<br>

          <div class="email-content">YMMV, but I&#x27;ve had TERRIBLE luck with 25th anniv cubes.  Yes, the ones 
that are good, are awesome.  But get this -

Out of the three ones I had just a few weeks ago, only one had 
reasonably &#x27;even&#x27; center tensions.  I trashed the others.

I recently found a store that allows exchanges, so I went on a shopping 
spree in hopes of getting some more good 25AV cubes.  It took me FOUR 
cubes to get ONE that was acceptable.  The others all had horribly 
uneven centers.

So out of 7 cubes, I got 2 good ones.  Maybe I&#x27;m just unlucky?

These are the ones in the hexagonal boxes.  Possibly the ones on cards 
are better...but the only carded cubes left around here are the nasty 
silver ones.  Ick.

          <div class="email-content">So yeah, the 25th anniversary cubes are... well, weird.<br>
<br>
I bought two cubes and the first one was really good right out of the<br>
box.  However, it wore out in about 2 months and is no longer a good<br>
speedcube.  The second cube was so very tight, and was terrible for<br>
speedcubing.  I just kept it so greased up that it had no choice but<br>
to loosen up a little bit, but it still was kind of tight.<br>
<br>
Now after about 2 months of breaking in, that really tight cube has<br>
loosened up and is now a really, really, really, really nice speedcube.<br>
<br>
I guess it will wear out sooner or later, but still it&#x27;s weird.<br>
<br>
My opinion is that the 25th anniversary cubes are for the most part<br>
really good, but they are so inconsistent.<br>
<br>
What about the manufacturing process makes them this inconsistent?<br>
<br>
Also could rubiks.com consider selling a special version 3x3 (I would<br>
pay more for this) that is an arched center cube with screws?  That<br>
way we could have the arched centers as well as ability to control the<br>
face tension.<br>
<br>
It could be called the super deluxe or whatever and cost almost twice<br>
as much.  I&#x27;d still buy it :-)<br>
<br>
What do others think of the 25th anniversary cubes?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve also had one 25th anniversary cube that was so bad (as in some<br>
faces *really* tight and some *really* loose) that I stickered it with<br>
my calendar cube stickers.<br>
<br>
It seems with screws these uneven face tensions could be correct by<br>
the cuber and all the cubes would be really nice.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, interesting.  How do you deal with centers that simply don&#x27;t 
have enough &#x27;breathing room&#x27;?  I.e. when you pull on them they barely 
give at all?  I tried the popsicle stick trick to stretch out the 
centers - actually the fit was so tight, all I could fit in there 
were a couple of miniature screwdriver blades - but that did 
absolutely nothing.  Any tips you&#x27;ve got would be welcome.  Thanx.

          <div class="email-content">You&#x27;ve pretty much nailed it - it all boils down to the evenness of 
the centers.  Awful hard to control the tension when you&#x27;ve got 
rivets instead of screws...or to reverse it if you go too far.

It&#x27;s a pity.  There&#x27;s so much to love about the 25AV&#x27;s.  The logo in 
the center RULES, the yellow is super bright and the stickers are 
easy enough to swap around for white-opp-blue fans like me.  But, as 
I&#x27;ve just posted, the lack of consistency is downright frustrating.  
(Stickers don&#x27;t last forever either, but that&#x27;s pretty minor in 
comparison.)

I second the motion for adjustable cubes with screws, to hit the 
store shelves.  And PVC stickers!  I too, would be willing to pay a 
premium.  After all, back in the early 80&#x27;s, cubes were what, 7 bucks 
apiece?  How much is that in today&#x27;s dollars?  Closer to 20, I&#x27;d 
assume.

          <div class="email-content">HI Chris,

The DIY cubes on Rubiks.com come with arched centers and screws.

They&#x27;ve been available for a year.

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi

OK so instead of the Frapper-I-can-not-find-your-city, I had another 
idea.

Everyone:
- download the free version of google earth here : 
http://earth.google.com/downloads.html
- open it, find your location, click tools|add placemark
- save it under YourName.kml
- post it in the files section with your name and location
- done

As an example: I live here  12°30&#x27;46.16&quot;N  69°57&#x27;58.41&quot;W
And my kml (keyhole markup language) is in the files section (the 
locations folder)
You can simply double click a kml file and google earth will take 
you to the map. It&#x27;s also possible to share all of the kml files 
using Google Earth (keyhole community bbs), but I haven&#x27;t really 
figured out how that works.

If you have a slow PC and cannot run Google Earth, just mail me the 
Lat/Long and I will create a KML file for you. Or go to 
http://tinyurl.com/dumtx after you found out your lat/long and just 
generate the kml file there.

More on KML: 
tutorial at http://www.keyhole.com/kml/kml_tut.html
offical docs at http://www.keyhole.com/kml/kml_doc.html

Google beats all!

          <div class="email-content">I have tried four 25th anniversary cubes. The first was great and
after five months it&#x27;s still a good speedcube. The second was horrible
and I noticed one of the edges wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. I took the cube
apart and discovered that the plastic on the inside was breaking off
and basically the whole cube was destroyed. I returned this cube to
the store and got a new one, which is also very stiff. The fourth one
is my friend&#x27;s cube and it&#x27;s so bad we refer to it as &quot;the
monstrosity.&quot; It&#x27;s a lot better after being greased but one side is
still really stiff. I agree, these cubes are very inconsistent, and I
have only seen one good cube out of four.

Unfortunately, the closest place that I can go to buy a Rubik&#x27;s cube
is at least an hour away, so I need to order cubes online. What do you
guys think of the DIY cubes?

          <div class="email-content">I have an ancient webcam that works from time to time.  When it does
work though it has a composite video in jack so you can record video
from anything with a composite video out jack.  For the audio I use a
composite-to-headphone-jack converter from radioshack plugged into my
microphone port.  Works like a champ.

Don&#x27;t know how that helps you... but since I&#x27;ve already typed it out I
think I&#x27;ll post :-P .

Other than obtaining some equipment for yourself, you have a few options:
1) Simply play it on TV and record the TV with a webcam... poor
quality but effective.
2) Ask your friends
3) See if a local university or even highschool has the capability to
do this for you.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t charge you.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I recently had a discussion with Richard Patterson and he had a really<br>
good idea.<br>
<br>
Our little group is not so little anymore, and I know of more than one<br>
person who is behind on reading the messages.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we can, as a suggestion (this is of course not going to be a<br>
rule for posting), include markers in our message the show what the<br>
topic is about.<br>
<br>
For example if I was going to make a math post I would write as the<br>
subject of my post &quot;(math) number of cube combinations&quot; with the<br>
(math) marker at the beginning.<br>
<br>
We could also include markers for specific puzzles, such as (3x3x3) or<br>
(speedsolving), or (new record) if you post your new record.<br>
<br>
This is of course not a rule, and I will never moderate a message for<br>
not having an opening marker.<br>
<br>
I think as a discussion evolves we should try to mark this in the<br>
subject of our posts though.  This doesn&#x27;t have to be a marker and can<br>
just be a subject change/refinement.<br>
<br>
Let this thread be a discussion for the idea of developing a group<br>
etiquette to let people see which category a message falls under and<br>
decide whether to skip it or read it.  If this is something we think<br>
would be a good idea then lets start using it.  If not then let&#x27;s not<br>
worry about it.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s hear everyone&#x27;s opinions.  You are a member of this group, and I<br>
for one want to know what you think.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I really am a fan of studio cubes, and have used them since about 2002
I believe.  Recently I switched over to the new arched center 25th
anniversary and regular rubiks.com cubes though.

I found that with studio cubes I was cutting corners too much and I
think this was slowing me down a lot.  I gained a lot of speed after I
switched to arch center cubes since they are fairly unforgiving of
cutting corners.  My turning accuracy is much, much better than it
used to be and my times have improved a good bit on arched center cubes.

I now prefer arched center cubes to studio cubes, but then again it is
hard to find a good 25th anniversary cube, so I try to keep a few
spare studio cubes ready to use as well.

If you have good turning accuracy then a studio cube is perfect.  If
you don&#x27;t have good turning accuracy then I recommend using an arched
center cube to learn how to improve your accuracy.  It really helped
my times!

          <div class="email-content">Yes a very good idea Chirs.  I think some ppl already do it putting
&quot;offtopic&quot; in offtopic discussions. But it would really be nice to
have some more of these markers in the subjects. Be assured that i&#x27;ll
follow the conventions.

That was of course just a joke. But Chris, how can you not know this ;
-). You should really get one or two, they&#x27;re a bit work to assemble 
cause not all pieces fit right away but when it&#x27;s done I&#x27;m sure 
youl&#x27;ll love them.

sure I want to delete it, and it&#x27;s just a little button on the side of
the quote.  So ChrisH&#x27;s quote is still there when you click his name,
but it&#x27;s not at the bottom with all the other quotes.

Obviously this thing has its flaws, and is in an early beta, but I
think it looks really cool so far.  Within 2 hours of posting my
message about it, there were 19 people from 5 continents and 9
countries that had signed up (and 4 Chris&#x27;s!).  I wouldnt worry too
much about those comments, since thats what seems to be the wierdest

problem as well.  We&#x27;ll see if they update it frequently enough for us.

          <div class="email-content">I really should have remembered, I guess I just had a bad experience
with DIY cubes.

I bought two DIY cubes this past summer and when I looked at the
pieces, a number of the screws were bent pretty badly.  Well I took
the best screws from both cubes and assembled them together into one
cube.  So if I ever want to make the second cube, nearly all of the
screws will be bent and it may not work too well.

Also the one that I did assemble seems very loose even when I tighten
the screws.

Maybe I just need to tweak it some more though.

I guess what made me upset is that I paid for two cubes, but had to
scavenge the pieces from both just to make one good cube.  A $40 DIY
cube is not worth it to me :-(

          <div class="email-content">Sorry, don&#x27;t know about the DIY in Europe part.

But heck yeah, the Mefferts cubes are junk for speedcubing.  I can&#x27;t 
deny that the individual sides turn quite smoothly, but the transition 
from turn to turn is torture.  I think it might be TOO loose, as I 
experienced constant, constant lockups (including one that, along with 
some excessive turning force, led to the demise of my Mefferts cube).

Also quite annoying is the fact that you CANNOT change the color 
scheme.  I couldn&#x27;t tell from the website and I can&#x27;t accuse them of 
being misleading, but I took a risk and hoped that I could make any 
scheme I wanted.  False.  Only the center tiles are interchangeable; 
the others are glued on.  And with red next to orange!!  Boy did that 
make me mad.

Lastly, mine had a weird smell.  Like, moldy or something.  Gross.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, trying to avoid placing edges while solving the cross is
definitely the wrong approach.  As a beginner, the only thing you
should be worrying about while solving the cross is the 4 edge pieces
in the cross.  More advanced people do what they call an extended
cross, which means they solve the first F2L corner/edge pair while
they are solving the cross, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about that for
a while.

It might be useful to study other people&#x27;s solutions to see how they
solve the first two layers without wasting a lot of moves.  One place
that you can do that is at my web site:

http://www.puzzlingaddiction.com/Cube/Net/

Also, you need to know how to pair up corners and edges while they are
in the wrong place.  Do the following moves backward on a solved cube,
then do them forward and notice how I am pairing up the corner and
edge while I am getting the edge out of an incorrect location.  This
will solve the FR corner/edge pair:

U&#x27; B&#x27; U B F&#x27; U F

Why go to see U2? There are only 2 cubes that can be solved by U2 (and 
one of them is solved already!) so it can&#x27;t have been a good 
performance. I&#x27;m intrigued that a guitar might be used to perform U2 
though.

Go and see Star Wars instead. At least R2D2 can be used to solve more 
cubes and more than one side will be turned too.

Or you could go and support PETA - they solve cubes with BLD - that&#x27;s 
even more cubes that could be solved.

I guess BLUR could solve even more cubes.

          <div class="email-content">So I was in the car on a ride home about 5 mins ago and doing some<br>
clock solves. I started to get bored and started to think of a way for<br>
challenging myself with something. &quot;Solving with restrictive moves&quot;<br>
(2-gen, etc.) sprung into my head, and this idea developed.<br>
<br>
Basically, you&#x27;re only concerened with one side of the cube, so ignore<br>
the back. Then, you scramble and make moves on the clock by only<br>
pushing one pin up at a time, and only turning the dial thing that&#x27;s<br>
next to the pin that is up. If you don&#x27;t understand that, I&#x27;ll try and<br>
explain it better.<br>
<br>
At first I couldn&#x27;t see an easy way of doing it and tryed for a while<br>
to solve it. Then I found what I think is the optimal solution. I can<br>
do it from anywhere like this in four or less moves. It&#x27;s easy, give<br>
it a try :)<br>
<br>
Once you know how, the puzzle gets really easy. eg, I did a BLD of it<br>
in a few seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some of you will probibly see it straight away and think it&#x27;s<br>
pointless, but I had some fun trying it out, so I thought I&#x27;d share.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The stories you guys have posted are pretty disturbing. :( 

I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this. In fact, for me it&#x27;s quite
the opposite. Often people seem oblivious to my cubing, but sometimes I
do get questions (not &#x27;can you stop playing with that thing&#x27;, but &#x27;wow -
how fast was that?&#x27; or &#x27;what&#x27;s the secret to solving that?&#x27; or &#x27;can you
still buy those things and if so, where?&#x27;) and on more than one occasion
I&#x27;ve gotten applause from random train passengers!

Maybe people&#x27;s reaction to public speedcubing varies from city to city
or country to country? I cube a lot on the tube in London and I used to
cube on the train in Arlington and Washington DC. Never had any problems
in any of those places. Also never had any problems cubing in various
cities in Australia.

Thanks for letting us know that the public&#x27;s reaction to cubing is not
so positive in all places. I should be more careful about where I cube
when I travel to other cities. Don&#x27;t want any cubing conflict!

          <div class="email-content">If all of the edges are solved, then your cube has come apart and
can&#x27;t be solved unless you take it back apart and reassemble it
correctly.

If your edges aren&#x27;t solved, then do a quarter turn of the LL face. 
You will then have 3 corners that need to be switched, and you can
probably find a solution for that situation.

          <div class="email-content">If everything is solved except for two corners on your 3x3x3...then then are
two ways to solve the cube:

1. Remove those two corners from the puzzle and swap them manually.
2. Take the stickers off both corners and place them back on the corners in
such as way that the cube is solved.

If you are using a 2x2x2 and not a 3x3x3, then place the two unsolved
corners on the right half of the U face and do this alg:

R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;

If your cube is a 3x3x3 : You have to permute manually the corners.
If it is a 4x4x4, use this : (Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2
Then you should be able to solve it like a 3x3x3.

I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it varied from gender to gender (of the

3. Put extra stickers on top of the wrong ones.

So, what I want is a programmable applet for the 4x4x4 that supports HarrisENG notation. Clear now? or no?

Hi Stefan,

I get a lot of responses like Jasmine gets.

During about half my bus trips I find someone who is really interested
in the cube. No one has been rude to me, and I&#x27;ve met some very
interesting people. 

Once, the day after I got my first 4x4x4, I missed my regular stop due
to cubing and found that *everyone* there had been watching me with
interest, because they all laughed. It was very friendy, though a
little embarrassing, and it *was* pretty funny.

Cheers,

David J

I have another theory. If u look young and do the cube people think 
it&#x27;s ok cause the cube is a &quot;toy&quot; only for most people. Whereas if u 
look a bit older and u do the cube people might find u are a very 
childish and irresposible person. Just a guess ... :-o

Have fun!

PS! Umm Rune, maybe u are bachelor too, since u have noticed? ;-)

PPS! I also answer a lot of Stefan&#x27;s posts. But nope, i&#x27;m not a 
gay :-P

PPPS! Reason i&#x27;m often answering Jasmine&#x27;s posts is that she often 
brings up original ideas, and not simply regurgitating :-)

Correction: I just noticed that a .kml file will not be opened 
directly in Google Earhth, but a .kmz file will. So if you add a 
file use the kmz extension.

I have added my place in the files section and i urge all of u to do
the same. It would be great if we have a database of this too, U can
literally fly from one speedcuber to another and it looks so great!

Hope to see more of the placement markers.

          <div class="email-content">Yes I am interested in a dorm. I think it would make a nice second 
home for me... Or I could sell it on ebay. 

Anyway, if you wonder if this is really interesting: it&#x27;s just as 
interesting as frapper, just better (more precise, add any HTML you 
want). The only drawback is that you have to add everyone as a 
single entry. If we have enough entries we can make it a combined 
file, that just loads everyones location.

And I now know that Michael Grimsley lives in walking distance of 
Pixar Studios... Interesting!

I don&#x27;t always do that. But yes im not married. Craig is correct. I 
have a long term relationship since may 2002 :-) I always quote her

Cheers!

PS! Umm Rune, maybe u are bachelor too, since u have noticed? ;-)

PPS! I also answer a lot of Stefan&#x27;s posts. But nope, i&#x27;m not a 
gay :-P

PPPS! Reason i&#x27;m often answering Jasmine&#x27;s posts is that she often

But...this position is not &quot;totally symmetric&quot; in respect to the home position. I can think of only two such symmetries: When all pieces are on there home places, all edges being flipped and the middles being flipped a half turn or not being flipped at all.
(Maybe I look teasing; but I strongly believe that one of those situations shows the antipode of the home position).

          <div class="email-content">James,
congrats on learning the first 2 layers on your own.    

There are many sites with algorithms and diagrams--some even have 
animated [in java?] cubes.  Jasmine&#x27;s page is a good one.  I just 
sent my brother Leyan Lo&#x27;s beginner&#x27;s solution, which he said was 
pretty easy to understand and follow, and he was about where you are 
with the cube.  I don&#x27;t have the link but sure you can Google it.  
I&#x27;m sure there are lots more.

There are also many more advanced solutions out there so you can 
learn to orient last layer in one step [one of 57 algs] and then 
permute last layer [one of 21 algs].  I found a lot of those online 
about a year ago, and I just try them out to see which ones feel 
good with my hands and then stick with those.  Those algs may be a 
good start on your quest to learning all 1211 unsolved states  
  
Also, depending on how you learn, you may find it useful to get 
together with other cubers to try to learn some things in person--
maybe try out that new Google map thing.  I&#x27;ve learned and honed 
some of my fastest algs by getting together with some other cubers 
occasionally.  

Good Luck!
--Kirk

What&#x27;s the use if i&#x27;m not sharing the url? So here it is :

Please enjoy it! It might not be working 100% of the time since i&#x27;m

I thought you meant the edges to be flipped like a superflip and also to be switched wrt 
the middle in the sense that UF and DB would be switched  rather than the actual middles 
(for a supercube). Now I see what you mean.

Clearly this cube doesn&#x27;t have the centres of the faces twisted by half a turn - the B face is 
never even turned. You can see the effect on each centre just by adding p each side 
individually. (The action on the centres commutes.)
So the effect of F R F D F U&#x27; D L&#x27; U&#x27; D R L&#x27; U&#x27; R L&#x27; F D&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; on the centres is the same as 
F F F F F&#x27; F&#x27; R R R R&#x27; D D D D&#x27; U&#x27; U&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; L&#x27; L&#x27; i.e. F2 R2 D2 U L.

I thought your question was originally about the diameter of the regular cube group rather 
than the supergroup.
I&#x27;d imagine the supergroup diameter is larger. It clearly isn&#x27;t less and I&#x27;d be amazed if for 
all those positions out at the diameter in the regular group that each of the 2048 positions 
obtained by twisting centres all took exactly the same number of moves.
I don&#x27;t know what the limit ranges for the supergroup are, except obviously the lower 
limits are at least as high and there&#x27;d be a cap on the upper limits in terms of the cap on 
the regular group plus the diameter of the group that only moves centres.

Do you agree with the statement that two (mutual) antipodes must be totally symmetric in respect to each other? In any case there exist only two such cases, wich can be Seen only on the supercube, namely when the middles are turned 180gr or not turned (and all edges flipped at home).
 Furhermore I believe that the first case represents the antipode of the regular cube, the second of the supercube.
One can ask oneself, why not disregard the middles when analyzing the regular cube. There are more symmetries then! Well those cases when the middles lie randomly turned are so...unaestical. And the mathematics must be aestetical!

They look completely different to what I seem to remember! - especially the one to switch 
2 pairs of edges.
I guess all that matters is having such an algorithm.

I&#x27;m not actually sure what you mean by &quot;totally symmetric in respect to each other&quot;. 
Alo by antipode do you mean at maximal distance or just at a local maximum distance?
Superflip isn&#x27;t at maximal distance (QTM) and it&#x27;s not known if it is at HTM but there are 
several positions that require 20 moves and they&#x27;re not totally symmetric so I wouldn&#x27;t 
agree with the statement. I would agree that superflip being totally symmetric has to be at 
a local maximum distance from the solved cube (because any quarter turn from superflip 
yields an equivalent position aand so, since one must be closer to the solution so must all) 
but that doesn&#x27;t make it a global maximum and I don&#x27;t see why in general symmetry 
would.

In any case there exist only two such cases, wich can be Seen only on the supercube, 
namely when the middles are turned 180gr or not turned (and all edges flipped at home).
>  Furhermore I believe that the first case represents the antipode of the regular cube, the

The first doesn&#x27;t in QTM, I believe. (At least not at a global maximum, thought it is locally.) 
Maybe it is in HTM, but it&#x27;s by no means the only one.

There are more symmetries then! Well those cases when the middles lie randomly turned 
are so...unaestical. And the mathematics must be aestetical!

Perhaps so - I like the QTM vs HTM argument better, although I am generally optimizing in 
HTM instead of HTM. : (

Just one question now (it may be more  later on): If you manully flip all the edges on there place, you get what I have called the &quot;superflip&quot;. But I suppose now that this is not the current meaning of the superflip?

I&#x27;m not actually sure what you mean by &quot;totally symmetric in respect to each other&quot;. 
Alo by antipode do you mean at maximal distance or just at a local maximum distance?
Superflip isn&#x27;t at maximal distance (QTM) and it&#x27;s not known if it is at HTM but there are 
several positions that require 20 moves and they&#x27;re not totally symmetric so I wouldn&#x27;t 
agree with the statement. I would agree that superflip being totally symmetric has to be at 
a local maximum distance from the solved cube (because any quarter turn from superflip 
yields an equivalent position aand so, since one must be closer to the solution so must all) 
but that doesn&#x27;t make it a global maximum and I don&#x27;t see why in general symmetry 
would.

In any case there exist only two such cases, wich can be Seen only on the supercube, 
namely when the middles are turned 180gr or not turned (and all edges flipped at home).

I agree that if u view the statespace of the cube as a sphere and 
solved state is the middle point, then radius is a better term than 
diameter. But recall that making it from solved state to any random 
state is equivalent to go from any state to any second random state. 
This should be quite obvious. So diameter is an ok term too :-)

The diameter is the maximal distance between two points - because we&#x27;re in a group it&#x27;s 
equivalent to the greatest distance from the solved state to another position (in whatever 
metric). Potentially you could define two points as antipodes if the distance between them 
was the diameter (but there could be more than one antipode for any given point - indeed 
for each point the number of antipodes would be the same). Alternatively you could define 
an antipode to be any point such that any of its neighbours (in whatever metric) is closer 
(or maybe at least as close) to the original point in question. That&#x27;s a different thing in all 
likelihood - it would refer to points that are locally as far away as possible (not necessarily 
as far as the diameter though).

That&#x27;s also the meaning of superflip I meant. It is not maximal distance in QTM so it 
wouldn&#x27;t be an antipode in the first sense - that&#x27;s why I disagreed on the symmetry 
conjecture. On the other hand it is clearly a local maximum so it would be an antipode in 
the other sense. It might be an antipode in the first sense in HTM. If it is then there are 
several antipodes.

For the reason you mention you can&#x27;t think of it as a sphere. Diameter is the correct term. 
In the present case it would be in this sense: 
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphDiameter.html
(They also define graph radius which would, in fact be equivalent here.)
Formally, the set of generators defines a metrizable group - different generators will, in 
general, define different metrics (although the underlying topology will always be 
equivalent). Because the group is finite there is a diameter.
The graph in this case would be the Cayley graph of the group.

Diameters are also defined in many other (geometric situations) - if anyone cares, they 
would be defined for any compact Banach space.

Already looking forward to see even more people at the WC!!

C you!

Hi Per,

I had a similar thought, and was pleased to see your post, but I
disagree with your conclusion.

Here we agree:
If the maximum is, say, twenty turns, and its twenty turns from a
solved state to position A, and twenty turns from a solved state to
position B, then radius would be the correct term if you think of the
solved state as the center of a sphere. 

We agree on the first part of this:
If all 43 quintillion positions are somewhere within the sphere, then
the furthest positions away from the solved state could be regarded as
being upon the surface of the sphere.

the furthest positions away from the solved state could be regarded as

Connecting any two points on the surface would not, in fact, be the
diameter of the sphere, only those which pass through the center. I
think that a different word than diameter should have been chosen.

In other words, if you had to go through the solved state to get from
position A to position B then diameter might be appropo, but you don&#x27;t
have to go through the solved state. From position A to position B
would be the same as from the solved state to some position C.

Cheers,

David J

If you think it&#x27;s jsut number of moves holding you back, learn every
single position and it&#x27;s optimal solution from cube explorer. Only
around 43 quintillion or so.

But diameter has a more general meaning and it actually is the 
correct term! For instance a square has a diameter and so does a 
triangle. The diameter is just the maximum distance between two 
points in a figure (geometrically). In a circle or a sphere all 
diameters represent the distance obtained in producing the line from 
a point on the circle/sphere through the centre to meet the 
circle/sphere again (and all such productions go through the centre) 
centre but a centre may not be so easy to define for a triangle or 
some other shape. (Triangles have lots of centres of different 
types.) More generally you can define a diameter in any compact 
Banach space (in particular in any closed bounded subset of R^n - 
e.g. a sphere). Of course, you are right about the disanalogy with a 
sphere in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to talk about a 
geometric centre and a diameter in the present case. (There&#x27;s also a 
centre of a group but that&#x27;s a wholly different thing!)

Nonetheless you can also talk about a diameter for a graph (with a 
metric on it) (at least if it is well-defined, which it always will 
be in the case of the Cayley graph of a finite group with respect to 
a given set of generators). There is a minimum path between any two 
points (the distance between the points would be its length) and the 
maximum of all these distances is going to be the diameter of the 
group. That&#x27;s basically the sense that is being used here. 
Since the topology respects the group structure, it&#x27;s equivalent to 
say that the diameter is the maximum of 

{the distance from the solved state to g: g is a position of the 
cube}

where we have fixed all the distances from the solved state as 
opposed to two arbitrary positions.
Thats because the distance between a and b is the same as the 
distance between e and ab^{-1} where e represents the solved state.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Frédérick,

You are absolutely right. It is hard to stay focused after setting a WR.
But do not underestimate the influence it has on the other competitors... What should you do when your opponent opens with 11.75? :-)

Congratulations again Jean!

Ton and I worked hard all day on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday Bob Burton helped us. On Sunday we had help from a lot of volunteers. Thanks to all who helped. Special thanks to Grada Ooms (Alexander&#x27;s mother). Without volunteers there can be no competitions. With all these volunteers I was able to stop working one hour before the final. Just to relax and practice. It helped. ;-)

There were 6 competitors averaging under 18 seconds in the final.
I was a lucky winner this time. But then again, I was an unlucky loser on a few occasions in the past.

Looking forward to meeting you all in Orlando!

Have fun,

Ron

The world record scramble was (white on bottom, green on front):
U2 F2 U F D R2 U R U L2 F&#x27; L F D2 U R U R B2 D&#x27; R U2 R&#x27; D2 U&#x27;

On the video Jean keeps the white cross on top while solving the cross.

Have fun,

  Hey, Ron, 
  do you have the scrambles used on the competition?
  I&#x27;d really like to try the record&#x27;s scramble...

  oh, and there&#x27;s a video of Jean&#x27;s record? I think everybody wants to watch

  Hi Frédérick,

  You are absolutely right. It is hard to stay focused after setting a WR.
  But do not underestimate the influence it has on the other competitors... What should you do when your opponent opens with 11.75? :-)

  Congratulations again Jean!

  Ton and I worked hard all day on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday Bob Burton helped us. On Sunday we had help from a lot of volunteers. Thanks to all who helped. Special thanks to Grada Ooms (Alexander&#x27;s mother). Without volunteers there can be no competitions. With all these volunteers I was able to stop working one hour before the final. Just to relax and practice. It helped. ;-)

  There were 6 competitors averaging under 18 seconds in the final.
  I was a lucky winner this time. But then again, I was an unlucky loser on a few occasions in the past.

  Looking forward to meeting you all in Orlando!

  Have fun,

  Ron

    When you beat the WR on your first attempt, you are not in a normal
    state to achieve the average.

    Congratulations to everybody for this very nice competition.

So M would be to turn the slice between R and L as you would L.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I always thought that M,E,S was well defined with a general 
consensus ot their meaning. When it comes to the physical turns x,y 
and z there is more confusion.

But anyway Chris is right: M moves same way as L, E same way as D 
and S same way as F. For 4x4x4 cube M,E and S will move 2 inner 
layers. While on 5x5x5 they will move all 3 inner layers. To move 
only the middlemost layer on 5x5x5 one should use m,e and s 
(lowercase MES).

Speaking of larger cubes. My opinion is that en edge is always a 
single cubie regardless of the size of a cube (puzzle). On 4x4x4 i 
would call an &quot;edge-group&quot; a dedge. This is commonly in use already. 
For 5x5x5 cube i would call a complete &quot;edge-group&quot; a TREDGE or edge-
triplet :-) A tredge will consist of a middle edge and 2 outer 
edges. The only parity on the 5x5x5 cube is swapping 2 outer edges. 
Swapping 2 middle edges is possible when also swapping 2 corners.

For the most common 5x5x5 method, pairing-up, one will always end up 
possibly with having to swap the 2 outer edges of a tredge. Or 
possibly one could learn all cases for the last 2 tredges. That is a 
great time save and there aren&#x27;t too many cases. For other methods 
like mine one could end up with having to swap any 2 outer edges. 
With my method that would be any 2 outer edges on the last layer 
(top). The approach is then to either use the common parity fix that 
swaps 2 outer edges on a tredge, followed by an outer edge 3-cycle. 
Or use the same fix with setup moves. Or yet another way is to set 
up the 2 outer edges adjacent on same inner layer, turn that inner 
layer 1 step and do an outer edge 3-cycle on that layer to complete 
the &quot;swap&quot;. The last approach will mess with centers so it&#x27;s only 
good for a method that solves centers after all edges are done.

And yes i will post my complete method for larger cubes some 
beautiful day ;-)

Hey Ron,

Like I said, I was doing preinspection when the crowd suddenly made 
a lot of noise... By that, I already assumed that Jean must have set 
something very close to the WR, or maybe he even broke it... Then I 
remembered something Raymond van Barneveld once said about his 
opponent starting with a 180 in an important darts game: He was 
actually relieved... And then I thought: Well, it should not be a 
problem... :).

Since the example of &quot;cube space&quot; was seen as a sphere then the
analogy continued with the diameter definition you just gave. Which
you acknolwledge below.

I was taught in school that the &quot;di&quot; prefix was the same as the &quot;bi&quot;
prefix and that diameter was defined in part as cutting an area into
two equal parts. Similar to the bisection of a line.

So here the diameter is seem as simply the furthest distance that any
two points can be apart. Yes on a sphere or a circle that would be the
diameter.

Thanks for this additional explanation.

That&#x27;s what it looks like, but I think that&#x27;s a coincidence. Notice 
that Bob got 3.96 twice in a row, this was the second time. I believe 
it&#x27;s more likely that the timer didn&#x27;t manage to overwrite the 
previous result than that it skipped a second.

It *is* an obvious error but before speaking out against stackmats I&#x27;d 
like to hear what the producers say about it. Ron knows about it and 
will contact them. Also, there&#x27;s no guarantee that other timers are 
error-free. Even the computer which you&#x27;re using right now might use 
error-correcting codes to fight errors in its main memory because they 
just do happen and even with those ECCs it&#x27;s not 100% safe.

Bob and I were thinking about the possibility that the timer might not 
add a second from the real time but instead subtract one, resulting in 
impossible times for Magic and Master Magic. Now that I think that it 
didn&#x27;t add a second but just repeated the previous result, I think 
this won&#x27;t happen, at least not with the same kind of error. Maybe the 
SpeedStacks guys can enlighten us. They should have much more 
experience, recently I think their world champs had around 1000 
competitors.

If the problem is really that previous results might be repeated, then 
at least we could prevent impossible world records by letting the 
timer run high before switching to the next event. That is, to prevent 
my last Magic time of let&#x27;s say 1.49 seconds be repeated as my first 
Master Magic time, we&#x27;d let it run for 5 seconds in between. Similarly 
for all other events unless it&#x27;s clear (i.e. no need to believe a 
Magic time could be mistaken for a 5x5 time or vice versa).

Oh, that doesn&#x27;t at all mean I will necessarily speak out against 
them. I like stackmats, I think they&#x27;re good, and before switching to 
something else I&#x27;d like to see proof that the alternative is any 
better.

Wow, that&#x27;s really bad. I timed that solve a few times and this is
what I got: 3.06, 3.10, 3.11, 3.06, and 3.04. Obviously, I started the
stopwatch a bit early or late on some of those, but there&#x27;s no way
that solve was slower than 3.25 seconds.

P.S. Will Stackmats be used at WC2005?

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

I arrived back from DCD yesterday evening. I had a brilliant time, 
thank you to everyone who helped to make it such a wonderful event, 
not just the volunteers (who are incredibly important of course) but 
the wonderful spirit in which the whole event was competed in. We 
are very lucky indeed to have such a great bunch of people who are 
interested in competitive speedcubing.

I am very happy to have set 5 new national records, and I have 
convinced myself much more that I can do well in the Worlds. I 
cannot wait to see you all there! Congratulations to Jean on his new 
WR, it is about time that the mark was lowered some more. But it 
does make it harder for the WR to be broken at the WC of course ;) I 
am sure it is only a matter of time before we see a magical 10.xx 
record or even sub 10.

I do agree with Frédérick&#x27;s point, I myself commented on how Jean&#x27;s 
11.75 may have not been as helpful to him as it could have been. My 
first 3 times in the final were 16.90, 17.75, 14.61... and after the 
14 I really started to believe in myself, and convince myself that I 
could possibly win this thing. But then I thought to myself, ok, I 
only have to do 2 more great cubes and I&#x27;m in with a chance. So the 
pressure started to build on those last 2 cubes, and I thought about 
it much more than before, rather than just taking each solve as not 
too important (like I tried to before). As a result, I rushed, and 
made a couple of mistakes, and ended with 2 20&#x27;s. On the last cube, 
I even did the wrong OLL. It&#x27;s strange what this &quot;sport&quot; can do to 
your head! But even after the 11.75 was set, I did not feel any 
additional pressure, because I hadn&#x27;t yet solved a cube, and I knew 
Jean had to solve 4 more also.

Look forward to meeting you all at the World Championships, I will 
arrive on the Thursday. Perhaps then I will get the chance to make 
an NR 4x4x4 average too :)

          <div class="email-content">I have just viewed the video, and from the evidence provided it does 
look as though the timer jumped a few seconds.

One possibility is that the timer display was lagging behind the the 
timer on the stackmat. I am not sure if this is possible 
electronically (I am no expert of course). 

But if you look at the video, it does take the timer display quite a 
few hundredths of a second to begin counting. Right from the 
beginning of the video, Bob&#x27;s hands have left the StackMat, picked 
up the Magic, and the timer hasn&#x27;t even left 0.00 . So maybe the 
timer &quot;jump&quot; is just the timer display synchronising itself with the 
timer itself. But I doubt if the discrepancy is as large as the 1 
second or so that it seems to correct by.

I am very interested to see how this issue is resolved :) 

Dan :)

          <div class="email-content">Try learning to solve to first two layers together (F2L), then maybe a 
three step Last layer, like Orient Edges, Orient Corners, Permute all. 
If you learn to solve the F2L intuitively, you should only have to 
memorize about 2 + 7 + 13/21 (if you use reflections) algorithms. Once 
you get this method down you should be using way less than 100 moves 
every time, and can get your speed in the 20-30 second range with 
enough practcie! 

Good luck!

I agree with the dan thing. I mean, the stackmat doesn&#x27;t display every
number it goes through, anyway. The frame before the 12.11 in mackys
solve shows 11.96, I think.

happend:
When the puzzle is fineshed and bob goes to the timer to stop, first 
hand is the left hand on the timer then the right hand but when the 
right hand hits the timer left hand goes up and down then the timer 
stops.left or right hand was not placed good for stopping the timer. 

Its not possible to time this vid because when vid starts, hands are 
not on the timer. they are allmost touching the puzzle.So there is 
some time space there.

The diameter of the cube (in QTM) is n, the end points being e and X.
There exists at least one way, L=L(1),L(2)...L(n) from e to X. (There also exists at least one L´ for the mirror case(s)).
Now, as e (and X) is a maximum, we can instead of L do some zL. But, naturally, we don´t find X but some X´. In the end we get 12 Xs for an arbitrary e. Each of those X has in it´s turn 12 Xs and so on and so on, which clearly leads to an absurdity. (One can, of course, think of some &quot;ring-building&quot; here. If e.g. there are only one X and one X´ and if they are mutually diametrical, we could get  quite a  lot of such triplets in the system. But I myself can´t imagine such a case).
All that leads to the fact that it can only exist one X to a given e. Thus we have to construct an X, wich is independent of the first move. Does such an X exist? Yes, it does exist one an only one (visible). It´s the case when e and X are identical except the fact that the flipping (of edges) in X is opposite the flipping in e. In reality this &quot;one&quot; case is  2048 cases, taken into account the possible rotations of the middles.
If we for a moment look at the supercube, we find that instead of 2048 we have only two possibilities to construct an X (for the supercube) viz. when all the middles are turned 180gr or not turned at all (or better(?) 360gr). One of this two cases must represent X for the supercube. And the other (whith the middles turned?)? Beyond any doubt: X in the regular cube.
Where am I mistaken?

Its not possible to time this vid because when vid starts, hands are 
not on the timer. they are allmost touching the puzzle.So there is 
some time space there.

MY 2 PENCE
Strictly speaking, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a matter of &quot;handling
the competition pressure&quot;. Jean is on the right track since
Paris 2005 (just look at de 15.xx during preliminary turn)
regarding this important competition issue (pressure).
And he also won the BLD easily, setting ER for his 1st try,
after only 2 months of BLD practice, with no DNF. Setting
a WR just puts you *out of focus* for a while, if you are not
yet used to it. &quot;Out of focus&quot; is different of &quot;Not handling
the pressure&quot;.

<br>
After seeing Jean Pons doing some very nice BLD solves, I tried to <br>
learn Stefans BLD method... Any withoud a lot of practice, I took more <br>
than three minutes of my old BLD record! (I went from 10:25 to 7:04). <br>
And I now only did the edges with that method, so I can improve even <br>
more, I hope.. Anyway, I was just so excited about this, I just had to <br>
share it..<br>
<br>
One of the amazing things was, that I hardly had to do any thinking <br>
during the edge solving...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, his hands aren&#x27;t touching the Stackmat but I also waited to stop
the watch until a bit after he put his hands back on the timer, so
that delay probably compensated for this to some degree. There was
probably still some time lost, but the times give you an idea of how
far off the Stackmat appears to be. I guess the video might be running
at a slightly different speed though.

That&#x27;s true, but that&#x27;s only a difference of .15 seconds. 2.81 to 3.96
is quite a bit more. I also think Dan&#x27;s idea seems likely though.

Does anyone know if Stackmats will be used at WC2005?

          <div class="email-content">well that is your opinion i see no difference between
out of focus and not handling the pressue.  not to
take away from jean&#x27;s great world record, but macky
for example is rock solid lately, i don&#x27;t see him
crack ever.  again congrats to jean, it was a great
solve glad i got to see it on video finally.

easier for me to solve! I&#x27;m at about 6:30 average after a couple weeks of
practice.

I still memorize the orientation and permutation as separate pieces though
and I don&#x27;t use a story. I just visualize the permutation, it&#x27;s a lot easier
for me. Hardwick showed me this in Dallas and it works wonderfully.

OK - you make a lot of assumptions without backing them up with solid reasoning.
I&#x27;m going to quote from Jaap&#x27;s page:

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cayley.htm 

&quot;The Superflip 
RL D2 B&#x27; L2 F2 R2 U&#x27;D R&#x27; D2 F&#x27;B&#x27; D&#x27; F2 D&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F2 D&#x27; (20f*, 28q) 
R&#x27; U2 B L&#x27; F U&#x27; B D F UD&#x27; L D2 F&#x27; R B&#x27; D F&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; UD&#x27; (22f, 24q*)&quot;

&quot;The 4-spot combined with superflip 
U2 D2 L F2 U&#x27; D R2 B U&#x27; D&#x27; R L F2 R U D&#x27; R&#x27; L U F&#x27; B&#x27; (21f, 26q*) &quot;

&quot;This proves that in the quarter turn metric, there is no unique antipode. If this last pattern 
is indeed an antipode then there are at least three, because the pattern can occur in three 
different orientations.&quot;

To back that last part up - anything that is not the superflip or the solved position is going 
to have a distinct but equivalent position (by some symmetry).
Therefore there&#x27;s no unique antipode in QTM. In particular, also, the superflip is not an 
antipode in QTM.

In HTM, if the superflip is an antipode it is certainly not unique. There are several positions 
requiring 20 moves.

In the particular case of your post I can&#x27;t follow this paragraph:

> Now, as e (and X) is a maximum, we can instead of L do some zL. But, naturally, we 
don´t find X but some X´. In the end we get 12 Xs for an arbitrary e. Each of those X has 
in it´s turn 12 Xs and so on and so on, which clearly leads to an absurdity. (One can, of 
course, think of some &quot;ring-building&quot; here. If e.g. there are only one X and one X´ and if 
they are mutually diametrical, we could get  quite a  lot of such triplets in the system. But I 
myself can´t imagine such a case).

and whatever you meant it can&#x27;t quite be correct because your next conclusion 

> All that leads to the fact that it can only exist one X to a given e. 

is false as noted above.

I&#x27;ve cut the rest (to save space and because I have to go to bed now) but I hope you can 
see that there is not a unique X to a given e from the fact that superflip is not maximal 
(QTM) from the solved position.
If you like I can also supply some algorithms in HTM that are 20 moves out (so that the 
superflip is not unique maximal in HTM, even if it turns out that it is maximal).

          <div class="email-content">LOL, I love how we are all coming up with good explanations for E and 
M, while S remains an enigma.

If you&#x27;d asked me 20 years ago I&#x27;d have solved the mystery by 
declaring that S clearly stands for Smurf.  For those of you not born 
back then (most of you), I&#x27;ll enlighten: The smurfs are these little 
blue dudes (well, 99 dudes and one dudette, known as the &quot;Smurfette&quot;)
who live in some mushroom-house village in the woods.  They&#x27;re all 
named after their personal characteristics, so Brainy Smurf might be 
the best bet as a potential cuber.

Anyways.  Their language consisted of substituting the word &quot;smurf&quot; 
for any other random word in the sentence, such as &quot;Have a smurfy 
day!&quot; &quot;I just smurfed a smurf!&quot; &quot;Smurf you!&quot;  And so SMURF is a very 
handy - er, smurfy - catch-all word with many uses.  Such as naming 
this unknown slice move.

Consider your grip on the cube when you are right handed. The easiest 
moves are obviously R, U, F, which can be performed by the index 
finger.

Now consider E, M and S. All of those moves can be performed with the 
right hand thumb, by just slightly changing the grip of the right hand.
And then for the most logical explanation of the letters:
E = Edges
M = Middle
S = Slice

Just an idea. Will it be an idea to find out during memorisation if 
u have the parity? U can easily figure this out by counting how many 
90 degrees turn to solve each single corner and add up. Should be 
divisible by 4 or possibly 8 also. If 8 there is no parity :-) I 
really hope this is correct. Intuition tells me it&#x27;s correct ;-)

As a part of the summer course in our institute, we have to do a<br>
summer internship for a period of 2-3 months. It can be anywhere in<br>
some company or a research project in a university.<br>
<br>
So I am asking u guys, does anyone here know of any university around<br>
your place which takes summer interns interested in doing research<br>
work in civil/structural enginerring? Could you please ask around and<br>
tell if ur university accepts such applications from outsiders? Also<br>
if some civil engineering professor happens to be reading this then<br>
i&#x27;ll be very happy if u accept me under you :-)<br>
<br>
No seriously, i really need to have a good summer project this<br>
may-june. If i get a good enuf project/internship then it&#x27;ll make my<br>
life much easier and also relieve a big tension from my mind (so i can<br>
concentrate more on cubing :) )<br>
<br>
As for the advantages, you&#x27;ll have a cuber living near you for 2-3<br>
months :-) I hope that incentive is enuf for us :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

I usually see if there is a parity issue by counting the lengths of 
the cycles of the corners. For example (1234)(56) is an even 
permutation, so no paritiy problem. (123)(45) is odd, so we have 
a &#x27;problem&#x27;... 

Btw.. I improved my record AGAIN, by almost two minutes.

I love you, Stefan! ;)

You gotta correct your intuition ;-)

Do T-perm to solved cube and your sum is 2, not divisible by 4. Or do 
a corner 3-cycle PLL, your sum is 4 but no parity.

I do detect parity during memorization, I guess most people do. No? 
It&#x27;s particularly easy for me now because I memorize pairs, i.e. two 
targets at once, so I know I have odd parity if I end up with a single 
target.

Cheers!
Stefan

Nice to hear that. Uh, the improvement, I mean. What made you that 
much faster this time? Did you switch the corners method as well? 
Luck? More practice? You should maybe try your previous method again, 
at least in order to see whether you&#x27;re still slower with it. Maybe 
you&#x27;ve just improved in blindsolving in general?

Cheers!
Stefan

Ehm.. So far, I only do the edges your way... I am planning do it <br>
for the corners too someday.. But first I want to get used to the <br>
edges.<br>
<br>
The improvement is: I now use letters for edges, which is somewhat <br>
easier to remember, because of the sounds. And the setup moves with <br>
your method are very easy. And, I dont have to orientate and permute <br>
the edges seperately, so takes away a lot of time.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t want to do it with my old method again, because I have to <br>
think too much with that method ;).<br>

Macky has had many more occasions than Jean to compete,
and there&#x27;s usually weaker opposition. Compare Horace
Mann Spring (or the caltechs) with the dutch open.
At HMS there was macky, Chris Hardwick (around 18) and
the rest above 20. Where is the pressure ? What happens
when you have 10 potential sub-15 cubers ? Maybe Macky
will stay like always (solid as rock), or maybe not.
I agree he has never cracked, and I admire him for that.
Orlando will be a GREAT event !

Then for the nitpicking between &quot;out of focus&quot; and &quot;not
handling the pressure&quot; :
- &quot;not handling the pressure&quot; : you begin to think that
  you may/should/will win, and u feel anxiety. It bugs
  your brain, and you s***w it up ;
- &quot;out of focus&quot; : can be a consequence of the above.
  But there might be different causes.
  You may just think about the beautiful lady you just
  met in the lobby before the competition...(especially
  idf she is sub20 too)
  Or you may think about ur WR, and you are just out of
  focus because you have achieved SOMETHING GREAT. Your
  mind is not 100% directed toward winning the whole event
  anymore.

There&#x27;s a huge difference between those 2 concepts IMHO.
Well... nitpicking :-).
Congrats to Jean again,

There were 6 competitors with sub-20 averages in the final round of
that competition.  Where did you get this information from?  There
were 8 competitors with sub-20 averages at DCD.  Why do you find this
to be so much different?  TEN potential sub-15 cubers?  Not at either
event.

was a reason it was chosen (not sure who invented these letters

Chris

P.S.  Maybe it stands for &quot;Singmaster&quot;?  As was a way to learn a mark

i would kill for a 16.xx average.  i&#x27;m sure your<br>
opinion is in part based on the excitment of have the<br>

it as a little more impartially for that reason.  as<br>
far as the competition i believe the southern<br>
california contests are just as competitive as any<br>
french event, the people that attended spring 05 are<br>
just as good cubers as the french competitors, in the<br>
last year i can only see of a couple instances where<br>
french cubers have broke 15 in contests, so it looks<br>
pretty even based on the competition statistics.  i<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Craig --

As I hear you, you&#x27;ve got two edges, each edge has the middle edge 
piece flipped, like (random color chosen to illustrate):

B W          W G
W B          G W
B W          W G

The short answer is: 
- Get both edges on one face (say U). 
- Do a sequence that flips one of the middle edges; 
- Turn the U face to put the other edge in the place of the first 
edge;
- Do the inverse of the sequence to flip the other middle edge and 
restore everything else.

Ie, the classic (X) U (X)&#x27; manipulation. 

Practicing with the same situation on a 3x3x3 (ie, flip just two 
edges) is a good way to find the solution without messing up your 
5x5x5.

Give it a shot, see if you can figure it out, then reply back if you 
want more specifics. I&#x27;m sure that bigcubes.com also has what would 
be a much faster way...

          <div class="email-content">yeah craig, i think the best/fastest way to fix that
is to first flip one edge around then use the normal
parity fix for the other one.  i could and probably am
wrong if anyone knows anything better tell me so i can
post it on bigcubes.  right now this is what i would
do, with those 2 tredges on FL and FR

e&#x27;R U R&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R e

e being the middle most slice alone, and using the
convention named the other day, where e is the
direction of D and e&#x27; is the direction of U

this leaves a regular center single center flip on the
left side.

do a number four, then a F2, then a number six

          <div class="email-content">Similarly but alternatively have both edges on a slice, flip one so that it 
doesnt affect the rest of the slice, push the slice through so that it is in 
the place of the first, and then do the inverse.  I only mention this 
because when I solve 5x5x5 its usually the middle slice I end up solving 
last.

True.

I&#x27;m not bashing either of these cubers, I&#x27;m just arguing.

Sub-20 is &quot;nothing&quot; nowadays (I wish I could do that though ;-)).
To get pressure, you need to have potentiel sub-17 at least
when you are yourself routinely below 17.
Look at the :
http://www.speedcubing.com/rankings/ranking2005a.html
and see who can really compete with Macky in the top 10.
Not that many american cubers.
That&#x27;s why having Lars, Jean, Macky, Edouard, the Chris-s, atc.
compete with eachother in Orlando will be so exciting.

In Orlando, why not...

I don&#x27;t &quot;fight&quot;.

>is jean that much of a superior cuber in your mind?

That&#x27;s not my point.
Macky has proven he was the best MANY times.
Will he remain the best ? maybe -- maybe not.
I&#x27;m just having an opinion on how we could interpret
results in terms of pressure/focus/pure-technique.
And I just thought (wrongly or not) that people would
like to read/argue about this.
And yes, I always have the &quot;-verbose-mode-on&quot; when
I write emails/news.

Best regards,

          <div class="email-content">When I originally learned the notation back in 1981, the three slices <br>
I learned were notated as SR, SU, and SF (with the second letter <br>

slice of front,&quot; respectively.  Later (probably on the cube-lovers <br>
mailing list) I saw the M, E, and S came into usage.  M=middle, <br>

Oh well, that&#x27;s not fair!  Why would Macky or anybody of equivalent
speed have ANY pressure in the first round? :P

I agree.  That will be exciting. :)  Don&#x27;t forget those that cube
secretly that could also be very fast. ;)

You have obviously never seen my cubing style, then.  I actually like
that move! ;)  M is of course, much better, but I do use S in one of
my algorithms (http://www.cubewhiz.com/oll.html see #16).  I will have
to make a new video of that one, though. :)

the reason macky and jean are so good at the cube is that they&#x27;ve
figured out a way to fuse a brain into their cube. that way they have
double the mindpower when solving it, allowing them to go faster.

hey, it could happen..

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Ok, so i will finally reveal how i do last layer middle edge 
flipping ;-) Well, i have told many ppl already but i don&#x27;t think i 
have posted it here before :-)

(All flipping is done on the U layer)

In order to flip 2 edges i do the following :

R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27; (U/U2/U&#x27;) R e2 R2 e R (U&#x27;/U2/U)

So as a matter of fact if i know i gonna end up having to flip 2 
edges i only need to spot the first to be flipped, then during the 
first few moves i locate the second edge :-)

If i end up having to flip all of them i can either do :

((m U)*3 m U&#x27;)*2

which does mess up centers (still unsolved anyway for my method). A 
pure version that only flips the 4 edges no matter what is the 
following:

F&#x27; R e R2 e2 R F U2 F&#x27; R&#x27; e2 R2 e&#x27; R&#x27; F U2 

I hope some find this useful :-)

Oh and by the way, of course these flipping algs do work on any odd 
sized cube. Or on even sized cubes can be used to flip blocks of 
edges.

invariably have their transparent covers peel off before the other <br>

IMMEDIATELY if you want to preserve the logo!!  The logo is printed on <br>
the transparent cover, not the sticker itself.  Get yourself some <br>
superglue and glue the cover back as best you can with a toothpick or <br>
some other small object.  I already lost some of the &quot;25&quot; number so I <br>
wanted to spare others the anguish I am now experiencing.<br>

Maybe, but... that was a very fast and smooth solve. I don&#x27;t need a 
timer to know there&#x27;s no way this is anywhere near 4 seconds. Quite 
possibly it was under 3.

Bob, the video starts after your hands have left the timer, can you 
show us a longer video that starts a second or two earlier? Or if you 
have the previous solve on video as well, would be good to show a 
video of both so that people can see how different it looks.

What do you mean? The last times the display shows are:
11.38, 11.49, 11.61, 11.72, 11.84, 11.95, 12.11

I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like the difference between 12 and 16 seconds for 
3x3. That&#x27;s because 3 is closer to the Master Magic limit than 15 is 
to the 3x3 limit.

Assuming a Master Magic limit of 2.5 seconds, 3 seconds is 6/5 of the 
limit. Assuming a 3x3 limit of 10 seconds, 6/5 of the limit is 12 
seconds.

Thomas Kohn&#x27;s attempt at the Dutch Open was to beat the record for 
most cubes solved blindfolded at once, same as what I did two weeks 
earlier:
http://tinyurl.com/djsar (message 20947)

No time limit (except time constraints of the competition of course). 
Thomas tried the same number of cubes as me but wanted to beat my 
time. Afterwards he said next time he&#x27;ll try more cubes so he doesn&#x27;t 
have to worry about the time.

So what you have in mind is different, but also interesting. Did you 
mean to do them separately (memorize and solve first, then same for 
second and so on) or all at once (memorize all, then solve all)? Both 
would be interesting, I think.

Cheers!
Stefan

Unfortunately, that is where that video starts. :(  However, do look
at http://www.cubewhiz.com/temp/dcd%20008.avi and notice that when I
am at the same position of that solve, the timer reads the same:
&quot;0.00&quot;.  Thus, I think it is a good reason to believe that both solves
started out identically in the first 0.1-0.2 or so seconds.

But after some practice finally got the concept and nw its just
another step in the solve. Ofcourse it helps if the parity is avoided
but i have learned to live with it.
I dont know what stefan&#x27;s method is but i can surely say the 3-cycle
method is not that bad. Try it once.

Ok, enough bashing and making fun. The introduction says the author <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I recently got my supercubes out of the closet and dusted them off. <br>
Unfortunately I don&#x27;t really have a good 3x3 supercube anymore, so I<br>
was just doing 4x4 and 5x5 supercubing.<br>
<br>
I was happy to have broken all of my records for supercubing.<br>
<br>
4x4x4:<br>
avg: 1:45.16 [1:41.79 1:38.02(2:07.63) 1:30.12 1:45.75 1:36.84 1:42.75<br>
(1:28.61) 2:02.92 1:43.22 1:57.45 1:52.70]<br>
pb: 1:28.61<br>
<br>
5x5x5:<br>
avg: 3:53.96 [3:52.41 3:59.90 3:57.54 3:50.66 (3:39.65) (4:31.03) 3:49.29]<br>
pb: 3:39.65<br>
<br>
I was particularly happy with the 5x5x5 average.  I had been trying to<br>
get sub-4:00 for a while.<br>
<br>
Anyway I was wondering if anyone else still supercubes (computer or<br>
real cubes)?<br>
<br>
I think the limits for 4x4x4 supercubing are sub-1:20 average and for<br>
5x5x5 are maybe close to 3:00 or just above for average.  Just a guess<br>
though.  Anyone else have any thoughts?<br>
<br>
It seems there are some 5x5x5 supercubers on speedcubing.com, but not<br>
many 4x4&#x27;ers.<br>
<br>
If you haven&#x27;t tried supercubing give it a shot, it&#x27;s fun!<br>

Many congratulations to Jean for the new record! I know first-hand 
how hard it is to do a non-lucky sub-12 under competition conditions 
(well, no one&#x27;s done it before!).

Am I expected to compete this Saturday? There&#x27;s a possibility that 
I&#x27;ll be home doing chemistry homework. If I have to, I will compete, 
but I might just have to walk 4 miles in the morning (don&#x27;t ask).

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I owe an explanation.

My mom is of the opinion that I should not compete in this tournament 
for several reasons.
1. The original plan was to not have a 2005 fall tournament because 
of the world championship.
2. I&#x27;ve competed in 4 tournaments already this year (winter, spring, 
NY, Dallas), while those on the east coast simply don&#x27;t have the 
chance
3. When cubers living 10 min or less away from the venue have a 
possibility of setting a new record on every attempt, the more 
competitions you have, the more chance there is of a new record being 
set.
4. Something about times at world championship being worse than 
usual. Not quite sure.

So not much I can do here. I personally don&#x27;t mind missing the 
competition too much, but I just worry what other cubers are going to 
say.

But you have to keep quiet! This is top secret.

Salutations,
Macky

p.s. I&#x27;ll probably see you tomorrow.

          <div class="email-content">1.  The original plan was never &#x27;not&#x27; to have a fall competition.  The 
original plan was to have a fall competition before the world 
championships so people in Southern California would have one last 
chance to practice before the world championships.

2.  You&#x27;ve competed in 4 competitions, but you made the effort to 
travel to 3 out of the 4.  You have not taken advantage of &quot;home field&quot; 
in Southern California at all simply because only 1 out of those 4 has 
been in Southern California.  It is completely acceptable to 
participate in a second competition which is near your home.  Everyone 
in the United States has the liberty to travel to New York or Texas or 
San Francisco.  You should be rewarded for your efforts in traveling.

3.  Again, see point 2.  You traveled 3000 miles to New York, 1700 
miles to Dallas, and 400 miles to San Francisco.

4.  That&#x27;s just because people get nervous because they didn&#x27;t practice.

So whereas I don&#x27;t agree with your mother, she kind of owns you.  If 
anything, she really should understand that a large part of my 
motivation for hosting the competition on January 24, 2004 was after I 
met you.

I guess that the 42 move solution is the Morwen B Thwistletwaite 
method, or an improvement, which is based on nested subgroups. So 
basically the method performs an algorithm in the full cube group to 
transform to the first subgroup, then another algorithm to transform 
to the next, and so on. Each subgroup limits the allowed moves that 
can be made. Originally he came up with a 52 move solution for this 
system, with all algorithms required neatly derived either manually 
or by computer. Later some of these steps were combined and a 42 
move solution arrived. It had in the meantime been improved to 45 by 
shortening some of the original algorithms.

I first heard about this method in book by the englishman David B. 
Singmaster &quot;Notes on Rubik&#x27;s Magic Cube&quot;. I believe it is also 
mentioned in the book by the german Christop Bandelow &quot;Einführung in 
die Cubologie&quot;.

The best proven method these days is a 29 move solution. I don&#x27;t 
know the details of this method but i believe it is also based on 
nested subgroups and with rather large collection of algorithms, 
which means there only a few steps to be done.

The cube explorer by Herbert Kociemba which uses 2-step solution, 
due to Michael Reid i believe, has so far never failed to produce 20-
move solution for any given cube state (htm). This is however no 
proof that positions requiring 21 moves or more might exist. It&#x27;s 
not possible to have the cube explorer solve all possible cube 
positions :-( Maybe some day :-)

Cheers!

Searching the Georges Helm cube bibliography list i found:

OSTROP Cyril;Solving the cube;Price/Stern/Sloan Los Angeles CL;ISBN 
0-8431-0300-0;1981;21;original;English;3x3x3;;;

So in fact those 3 names are not the authors but name of the

competitions than most.

You are far more gifted at cubing than most of us could ever hope to
be, and it&#x27;s awesome to watch you do your stuff so to speak.  I think
it would be a shame for you not to go to the tournament.  I mean I can
kind of see where your mom is coming from on this, but I still really
hope that she would reconsider.

There are a handful of cubers that inspire everyone, you being one. 
So I for one, as an east coast cuber too, think you should go.

What about me?  I&#x27;m on the east coast.  Have I not had the chance? 
I&#x27;m not rich by any means and I only work during the summer, so it&#x27;s
not like these trips are like free for me.  Those who really really
want to go to a tournament will go, and those who don&#x27;t really want to
will not go.  Flying is cheap these days.  I am flying a total of
3000+ miles for my Florida trip and it is costing me less than 5 cents
per mile. :)

I agree with Tyson&#x27;s points here.  You have traveled quite a bit and
certainly should not be penalized for living close to this venue.  So
what?  Go! :D  ...not only that, but I think EVERYONE has the
&quot;possibility&quot; of setting a new record on every attempt.  It&#x27;s just
that your possibility is far greater than most. ;)  There is that very
small chance that a 40-second cuber will get a lucky case with a
triple-X-cross and a LL skip or something.  OK, not very likely, but
still possible right?

Some may agree with me that you handle pressure pretty well.  I think
you&#x27;ll do fine at WC. ;)

I&#x27;ve sent ESPN a couple &quot;bug&quot; emails asking if they&#x27;d consider 
putting the World Championships on ESPN2. I finally got a response, 
but it was pretty much an &quot;it&#x27;s not on the schedule&quot; response. I&#x27;ve 
appended it below for your reading. 

It&#x27;d be fun to have a real &quot;show&quot; of the WC2005, with things like 
intro, color commentary, play by play, slow-motion replay, etc. I 
know I&#x27;d buy that on DVD. Anyone have the camera, the time and the 
interest??

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jon --

I know I for one am a regular participant, and really appreciate the 
work you put into running the Contest. I just want to say Thank You!

I bet it&#x27;s just getting into a busy season, what with Halloween and 
the upcoming holidays in Nov/Dec. Also, people in school are 
probably in midterms and soon will be in finals.

As a note, I did a semi-random sampling of number of participants 
over the last year and got: January 9, 2005 = 6 people; April 10, 
2005 = 10 people; July 10, 2005 = 38 people; Oct 16, 2005 = 28 
people. So, even though it&#x27;s in a bit of a slump, it&#x27;s still way up 
compared to earlier this year.

Thanks again!

As long as your other cube is also one you can use in competion, I 
think you can ask the judge if they can scramble a different cube 
for you... I think I have even seen this in a competition.

However, I personally would never do this, unless my cube breaks or 
anything weird happens.

without saying.  But whether he should or shouldn&#x27;t come is a 
decision between him and his parents, and our input should count for 
very little [if anything] in the equation.  

If his mom thinks it would be better for him to spend time on other 
issues and miss out on this one tournament, I suspect she has very 
good reasons for thinking that; it&#x27;s not as if she doesn&#x27;t know how 
gifted a cuber he is or where he ranks, etc.  She knows all that, 
and we should give her the benefit of the doubt that she factored 
all that into her thinking when coming up with her decision on what 
would be best for her son [Macky did list some of her reasons, but 
often parents have still other reasons that she may not have 
articulated to Macky or which he may not have shared with us].  

Bototm line, we in here should respect her advice and support that, 
not pressure him to do something against his parents&#x27; better 
judgment.

I think I have seen this in competition...

As long as your other cube is also one you can use in competion, I 
think you can ask the judge if they can scramble a different cube 
for you... I think I have even seen this in a competition.

However, I personally would never do this, unless my cube breaks or 
anything weird happens.

          <div class="email-content">I do also use a 4LLL but I instead do:
- orient edges
- orient corners
- permute corners
- permute edges

The main reason is that I can then gradually go 3LLL and 4LLL without
having to learn too much at a time.

Orienting corners needs 7 algs (all of them are in the OLL part of the
2LLL) of size 9, 8, 9, 8, 8, 10, 11.

Permuting corners needs 2 algs (all of them are in the PLL part of the
2LLL) of size 15 (argh) and 9.

Unfortunately I started cubing not long ago and my times might not be
taken as a reference but I have an average of 1:07 and a single solve
record of 46 seconds.

I am also interrested in knowing what other 4LLL cubers do.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Jeff,

I just took an average using my own version of the 4 look LL technique
(forgive me if someone else already invented it, but I haven&#x27;t really
seen it before on any sites).

I did this average using F2L, orient edges, orient corners, permute
corners, permute edges.

27.61, 19.46, 26.34, (17.44), (30.44), 20.89, 19.74, 20.56, 23.90,
23.39, 22.00, 24.58 = 22.85

The 19.46 I skipped the permute corners step, the 17.44 I skipped the
permutation of both corners and edges.  In short those solves were
lucky.  The 19.74 had all 4 LL steps.

Here&#x27;s is what I do for each step.

Orient edges:
same as you, either two adjacent edges need orienting, or two opposite
edges, or all 4, (or none and a skip).

Orient corners:
I use the required OLL alg (only need to learn 7 to be able to do this).

Permute corners:
either two adjacent corners are swapped, or two diagonals, or none. 
Have to use an alg that preserves orientation now though.

Permute edges:
either a three cycle, two pairs of adjacnet edges swap (Z perm) or two
pairs of opposites swap (H perm), or solved and you skip this step.

Here are some odds about skipping steps.

Orient edges: odds to skip are 1/8
orient corners: odds to skip are 1/8
permute corners: odds to skip are 1/6
permute edges: odds to skip are 1/12

So your chance of skipping at least one step (doesn&#x27;t matter which,
and can also be more than one step) is 1-(7/8)*(7/8)*(5/6)*(11/12)=41.51%

So this method has a 41.51% chance of being a 3 look or better system,
even though you only know it as a 4 look system.

The only thing is, to learn this system you need to learn the 7 OLL
algs for flipping corners when the edges are correct.

The reason I put the steps in this order too is so that you can extend
to the usual 3 look by just learning the PLL algs.

Also, it requires you to learn a few OLL algs too, which will be
helpful later on.

Again this would be my recommendation for a 4 look LL method.  Even if
you don&#x27;t want to learn the OLL algs, I would recommend solving in
this order to get your brain used to the switch to a 3 look LL method
if you do decide to do that one day.  Also you could learn only 2 OLL
algs, the sune and anti-sune, and use them like on Jasmine Lee&#x27;s
beginner method to flip all corners cases.  This method can still be
very fast, and it requires less learning than the 7 OLL algs would.

Like Macky said though, it&#x27;s all about F2L.  You can have a very fast
4 look LL method if you have a good F2L.  So though it is good to be
thinking about the LL, your F2L will have more effect on your times
than the LL will at this stage.

Just some food for thought, but this is the method I would recommend.
 It would require you to learn 7 new algs to do it, but in my opinion
it can be a fast method with very little effort (compared to full
Fridrich say).

          <div class="email-content">LOL ok so my brain totally shut off when writing my last post.  The
odds section is completely wrong.

The correct odds should be:

orient edges: odds to skip are 1/8
orient corners: odds to skip are 1/27
permute corners: odds to skip are 1/6
permute edges: odds to skip are 1/12

The odds for skipping at least one step are then:
1-(7/8)*(26/27)*(5/6)*(11/12) = 35.64% which is still over 1/3 chance
for a 3LLL system or better.

          <div class="email-content">I definitely prefer sgowal&#x27;s order because it transitions easier into 
learning PLL (and the dreaded OLL if you choose).

Wow.  43 seconds with 4LLL is pretty good.  I&#x27;m a 3-looker, OC-OE-PLL 
and I&#x27;m averaging a full minute.  Of course, I&#x27;m also in the middle 
of trying to unlearn 20 years of bad habits (like constant regripping 
&amp; solving cross on top).  It&#x27;s like starting all over again.  Sigh!

42 is a QTM bound, I believe (I think 29 is a bound for HTM which rather contradicts the 
first picture). Anyway. it&#x27;s not really possible to prove a metric is incorrect. It may not be 
the most aesthetic though.

I used to do it this way:
orient edges
permute corners
orient corners
permute edges
(Jasmine&#x27;s begginer solution)
 
But I think it&#x27;s better to do
orient edges
orient corners
permute corners
permute edges
 
&#x27;cause it&#x27;s easier to switch to a 3 look or 2 look LL (like I did)
 
well, I already know all OLL and PLL, and am around 25 seconds on average, with a PB on single solve of 18.50 and 23.91 for average
 
well, it&#x27;s not so bad for 4 months of cubing

          <div class="email-content">Hello all.<br>
<br>
The current topic about 4-look LL has made me real nervous. I<br>
currently do a 3 look LL with most of the OLL algos memorised and some<br>
PLL algs also i know. My current best average is exactly 40.00 seconds<br>
achieved just yesterday. Much slower than the guys with 4-look LL.<br>
<br>
I have been in the 45-40 range for the past whole month, maybe more<br>
and i just am not improving anymore. And i&#x27;ve seen ppl who were behind<br>
me get past me and all i am doing is just practicing. I think there is<br>
some fundamentally wrong that im doing. I want u guys to see my video<br>
that i made and plz tell me if u can find anything that im doing<br>
wrong. heres the link (thanks to chris hunt for hosting it)<br>

I have more vids, so if this ones not enuf i can send more, but plz i<br>
desperately need tips, or else im starting to loose interest in the<br>
cube. I donot live even remotely close to any speedcuber and thats <br>
hurting me a lot. :(<br>

It is difficult to tell, but I think you are doing F2L, right? It was 
difficult to see because your hands were covering the cube most of 
the time. Which leads me to my suggestion: Finger tricks.  

Your cube also doesn&#x27;t look really lubed up, it doesn&#x27;t appear to 
spin too fast, but that may just be how you turn it. But you use full 
wrist turns too much. If you just use finger tricks to move pieces 
and execute your triggers, you will find your number of moves per 
second will go up, thus reducing your time.  But 37 seconds isn&#x27;t too 
bad, hang in there.

Yes, if that isn&#x27;t the best advertisement for the importance of using 
F2L  and using it well  I don&#x27;t know what is. Using a 4 look last 
layer, Chris got an average that is only .5 seconds slower than my 
fastest average ever, and I use pure Fridrich.  Ouch.

          <div class="email-content">Finger tricks!  Good idea - where can we learn more about them?  I 
think Dan Knights used to have a bunch on his site but it has been 
down for a while.

Sachin, I feel your pain.  It&#x27;s been frustrating for me too, as I 
feel this is something I should be good at, I&#x27;ve always liked math 
and puzzles.  But speedcubing is a total enigma to me.  (As is chess, 
where I hang queens and walk into one-move mates with alarming 
frequency).

Not having a buddy makes it tough, and I&#x27;m in the same boat as you 
there too.  Having that extra person to catch your blind spots - and 
vice-versa - is very helpful in most things in life, and I&#x27;m sure 
speedcubing is no exception.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Sachin,

I absolutely know the feeling when you say that you see people pass 
you by and wonder what you could be doing wrong to hold you back?  
I&#x27;ve felt the same way for quite some time :-)

It took me almost 5 years of seriously almost daily practice to get 
sub-20, whereas it seems the average is at right at around a year or 
less.

As far as what you are doing &quot;wrong&quot; I think it is just that 
different people learn at different rates.  I watched your video and 
I don&#x27;t see any huge problems.  I mean you have some delays, but 
they&#x27;re not particularly bad.  The delay after your first corner 
edge pair and before your second one is the longest one, but I mean 
it isn&#x27;t terrible.  Your decision time and execution time for the LL 
is pretty good.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like you delay between steps much, 
if at all really.

Also, you have to remember that learning new algs slows you down.  
Even if you see an alg that you recently learned, it can cause you a 
delay if that alg isn&#x27;t yet in your subconscious.  Even though you 
know the alg, and using it makes your execution of that case more 
efficient than your old method, it can still cause a delay at first.

All I can say is that learning new algs is much better than just 
practicing old stuff.  Once you learn all the algs, and have had 
time to practice them and get comfortable with them, your times will 
shoot down very quickly.

Also, as far as seeing people passing you all the time, don&#x27;t worry 
about it.  As long as you keep practicing, you will discover new 
shortcuts, new techiques, improvements to your system, etc..  Even 
if other people are learning how to do this faster than you, just 
remember that with enough practice you&#x27;ll catch up too.

It really made me nervous to read this line:

> but plz i
> desperately need tips, or else im starting to loose interest in the
> cube.

Don&#x27;t feel like you are simply &quot;not getting it&quot; when others all seem 
to pick up on everything very quickly.  It took me longer than most 
to learn even the basic things about cubing, but over time I did 
learn them.  I don&#x27;t mean to say that you are a slow learner, I&#x27;m 
just trying to say that people learn at different rates.

Plus I think you will be pleasantly surprised when you finish 
learning the Fridrich method and have some time to get comfortable 
with it.  Your times will drop dramatically when that happens.

So in short don&#x27;t get discouraged!  Cubing is a lot of fun!  Always 
feel free to ask questions, or post a video on the group to be 
reviewed.  Not everybody is a prodigy at learning how to cube, even 
though it may seem that way since lots of people do learn quickly.

There are a few of us &quot;average&quot; cubers out there too ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Dave,<br>
<br>
&gt; It is difficult to tell, but I think you are doing F2L, right?<br>
<br>
Yup i use the Layer by layer method with blue at the bottom and green<br>
opposite it.<br>
<br>
&gt; It was<br>
&gt; difficult to see because your hands were covering the cube most of<br>
&gt; the time. Which leads me to my suggestion: Finger tricks.<br>
&gt; Your cube also doesn&#x27;t look really lubed up, it doesn&#x27;t appear to<br>
&gt; spin too fast, but that may just be how you turn it. But you use full<br>
&gt; wrist turns too much. If you just use finger tricks to move pieces<br>
&gt; and execute your triggers, you will find your number of moves per<br>
&gt; second will go up, thus reducing your time.  But 37 seconds isn&#x27;t too<br>
&gt; bad, hang in there.<br>
<br>
Well what i observed is that when i try to do finger tricks, i keep<br>
locking my cube a lot. The main problem is that i inadvertently turn<br>
the bottom layer a little bit with my left pinkie and however i try to<br>
avoid it it always turns a little and leads to locking up. Does anyone<br>
have any videos showing some nice finger tricks? means i know the<br>
simple ones like RUR&#x27; , etc but some other ones maybe at slow speed?<br>
<br>
Keep pouring suggestions :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Dan Knights&#x27; videos on finger tricks were absolutely fantastic, but 
yes I agree it&#x27;s a shame that his site has been down for a while.  
He had videos of the most crucial to know 2 move triggers, then how 
they worked into three move triggers, then 4 move triggers, etc..

I&#x27;ll try to get in touch with him about this, but if it would be 
hard to get his site back up I&#x27;d be more than willing to make some 
videos like on Dan&#x27;s page, at least as a backup until his site comes 
back online.

I&#x27;ll send him an e-mail today.

Just out of curiosity, what&#x27;s Dan doing with himself these days?

take advantage of the opportunity, there are cubers who have been in
more competitions than you this year...*cough* Bob *cough* So go get

          <div class="email-content">Hello all.

The current topic about 4-look LL has made me real nervous. I 
currently do a 2 look LL with some other ELL algos memorised and 
some specialised algs also i know. My current best average is 
exactly 22.xx seconds achieved more than a year ago. Much slower 
than the guys with 2-look LL.

No, I am not mocking you, this is for real. I have done the 
following in the past year:
- converted from cross on top to cross on bottom
- relearned all of F2L, OLL and PLL with cross on bottom
- learned all of Jess Bonde&#x27;s PLL, some OLL
- learned most of Dan Harris PLL, and most of OLL

And guess what: I am still not sub-20, in fact I am slower than I 
was before WC2003. I do know finger tricks, and using a 3.5-Look 
last layer I can do sub-30s. So what did I learn CFOP for??? Or 
maybe a better question: why should I hold the cross on bottom when 
clearly it hasn&#x27;t helped me??

My number of moves during speedsolving is somewhere between 40 and 
60.

Puzzled.

every step I knew so well which one would follow the other that it was

To see a solve using that method, see here:

because my method sucked didn&#x27;t mean I couldn&#x27;t use finger tricks. ;)

Looks like your cross took 5 seconds, so practice and you should do
it in 2-3 seconds

I can&#x27;t do the cross in 2-3s even when I know the exact moves to make, 
because the algorithm is different every time and is usually tricky to 
execute (it&#x27;s hard for a beginner to know where to use FSC&#x27;s on the 
fly).  Ergo I don&#x27;t think specifically working on the cross is going to 
help much.  Probably just sheer finger speed and looking ahead in all 
phases of solving is where it&#x27;s at, for now.

          <div class="email-content">Oh man.  I did a bit of searching and found out some sites for 2x2x2
assembly.  So I followed the instructions and was able to put the cube
back together.  I wanted to solve it a few times to see how it was, so
I&#x27;m doing my first solve with it.  I&#x27;m not even done with my first
layer, and it explodes.  Pieces everywhere.  I&#x27;m not even going to
bother to look for them.  I&#x27;m not sure if I put it together wrong or
something, but I really don&#x27;t care.  I HATE Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2s.  ;)

Does anybody have a Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 that moves well?  I took mine apart
and lubricated mine (it didn&#x27;t explode on me before), and it felt okay
for the two seconds I was using it.  If you have a good one, did you
lubricate it or just use it a lot?  I&#x27;d like to compete in the 2x2x2
event at WC, but if I don&#x27;t have a good cube for it I&#x27;m not going to
bother.

any of them are any better so i will keep them sealed.  Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2s
are AWFUL. The nicest one I&#x27;ve felt was Peter Greenwood&#x27;s, but he
still has the white opposite blue color scheme on his, so even though
it moves well, i still wouldn&#x27;t get good times on it. ;)

          <div class="email-content">Haha Michiel,

Do not worry, I am sure that CFOP is one of those methods that takes 
different people different amounts of time to reach their full 
potential with. Keep on working at it, and I am sure you will reap 
the benefits.

It is likely that you are just making a few habitual mistakes, which 
after lots of practice you will soon discover and be able to weed 
out for yourself. One of the problems may be that you are blindly 
solving the pairs too fast for you to then see the next pair, so 
then a 1 or 2 second delay punishes you when looking for the next 
pair. Better to solve slightly slower but with no delays.

There is nothing wrong with your move count 40 moves at 3 moves/sec 
= 13.3 seconds, and 60 = 20 seconds. So you just need to find the 
correct techniques to allow you to move at 3 moves/sec or even 
faster.

Good Luck mate,

Dan :)

The force runs strong in your family....
pass on what you have learned......

anger leads to hate...hate leads to suffering.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks everybody for the suggestions, esp chris. :)

Btw i dunno why but i thought abt these things u all said when i was
trying this weeks sunday contest and was getting some good times.
Ofcourse there were lucky cases but i got my new personal best avg
today -  36.78 secs! I really am stumped...how can just reading the
suggestions affect ur times? or isit just a coincidence?

Also i liked the finger tricks site someone had posted, still im
waiting for Dan&#x27;s videos though.

Thanks everybody.

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,


I was  wondering if someone could run a php-poll (I know
Joel van Noort used to run polls) of bets on who will
win what at the next WC-2005, like if we were bookmakers.

Macky is undoubtly the favorite of many events, so maybe
the polls will help us to decide who we think will come
in second place :-).

Or maybe this idea is plain stupid, and we should wait
until 5th of november, in order to know the winners,
cube in hand(s), in what will probably will be the most
exciting Rubik-WC ever.

Can&#x27;t wait till this day,
Good luck to all of you, cubers from all over the world,

(just sub-24 today, will wait till 2007 :-))

I tend to hold a corner-edge pair together and pop them both in at once.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Bob  :)  And i plan to fix that color scheme before WC05.

I also have a website (unfinished...) for the 2x2. 
&lt;http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/misc2a.html>

I&#x27;m not sure if you can figure out what do do from there, so ill 
quickly explain:

Find the UBR corner, put the heart shaped piece towards the squared 
one, then put a rounded one in the other side and slide it on. Find 
the UBL, put on a rounded edge and put it on. Find the UFL, put on 
the last squared edge and slide it on. Take your selected corner, 
slide it on the squared edges, then force it over the heart shaped 
piece. (note: needs much force!!)

I hope that helps. 

Misc question answering: 
Some one asked how to lube it, so heres what i do. First i play with 
it for a while. After that, i use my lube (liquid, bought it from 
radioshack). I take it apart, put a little inside the edges, then put 
it back together and put a little down the cracks. 


Final note: 
Since only Rubik&#x27;s 2x2&#x27;s will be allowed at WC05, ill be happy to fix 
people&#x27;s if they happen to pop. 


I hope all of this helped!

How much are 5x5x5&#x27;s in Europe?  Are they more than $30 USD?

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Well, i haven&#x27;t seen 5x5x5&#x27;s in the shops here in norway. Maybe 
there are, but i don&#x27;t fly around to every toyshop here. I would 
guess that shops here if they had them would charge about $30 yes. 
Possibly more if they only buy small stock from rubiks.com. If u 
really test them all here is what u should look for:

- even tension on all sides (one center sticking a bit out is not a 
good sign)

- no internal skewness (can be felt, no need to open)

- no visible chipping of cubies

- not too tight (maybe most important)

If u really really do that i offer 2x15=30+10 = 40. 10 is then for 
the work. Let me know if that is ok ;-)

india then i&#x27;ll have 2-3 of those.

Macky&#x27;s name on the winners trophy. No disrespect to him of course, 
but the competition is wide open in my opinion. So it won&#x27;t be a 
tournament to find the world&#x27;s second fastest cuber at all.

It&#x27;s all on the day, as they say :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Last couple of months I have been developing a new timer that I expect<br>
to be useful to the community. It&#x27;s a online timer and it works with<br>
most modern browsers. The web server requirements are php and mysql<br>
and the installation is supposed to be painless. The first time you<br>
run the app you will get to the setup screen.<br>
<br>
I intended to go for something much simpler but I kept adding features<br>
and ended up with a more generic timer. For this first release it has:<br>
<br>
- multi-user environment<br>
- RSS feeds for each user/puzzle<br>
- a nice history page<br>
- no need to send accepted times to the server<br>
<br>
I have been testing it for some time now with the help of Sachin, a<br>
regular poster here, and don&#x27;t expect any serious bug, but who knows<br>
right?<br>
<br>
The timer is open source software and the project is hosted by sourceforge.<br>
<br>
This is the project site:<br>
<br>
http://phppuzzletimer.sourceforge.net<br>
<br>
You can download the first version from:<br>
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148669<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Marco Garbelini<br>
<br>
PS.:Please tell me about any typo or just plain bad English you might<br>
see on the site or on the software.<br>

Matt Walter is in Southampton.  I am in Toronto, this is correct.  
What about Dan Gosbee and Gaétan Guimond?  Gaétan is in Quebec, one 
would assume.  What about Bob Peters, who holds the current 3x3x3 
National Record?

&gt;Hi all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Last couple of months I have been developing a new timer that I expect<br>
&gt;to be useful to the community. It&#x27;s a online timer and it works with<br>
&gt;most modern browsers. The web server requirements are php and mysql<br>
&gt;and the installation is supposed to be painless. The first time you<br>
&gt;run the app you will get to the setup screen.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I intended to go for something much simpler but I kept adding features<br>
&gt;and ended up with a more generic timer. For this first release it has:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;- multi-user environment<br>
&gt;- RSS feeds for each user/puzzle<br>
&gt;- a nice history page<br>
&gt;- no need to send accepted times to the server<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I have been testing it for some time now with the help of Sachin, a<br>
&gt;regular poster here, and don&#x27;t expect any serious bug, but who knows<br>
&gt;right?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The timer is open source software and the project is hosted by sourceforge.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The competition is definitely wide open, but of course he is one of the 
top 5 favorites.  Ryan Patricio had a 15.51 average in the finals 
yesterday.  With a time like that, he establishes himself as one of the 
favorites as well.

          <div class="email-content">DNS means did not solve.  It generally means that the cuber chose not <br>
to solve the cube.  DNF means that the cuber did not finish the cube.  <br>
Sometimes it means the cuber was disqualified for breaking the rules.  <br>
One such example would be stopping the timer while still holding onto <br>
the cube.<br>

I don&#x27;t think the number of cubers will be a problem almost of us <br>
have friends that can solve and would be willing to come. Plus if we <br>
give enough notice on when the competition is, I would imagine that <br>
a few cubers from the states would come up. NY isn&#x27;t that far from <br>
Toronto. <br>

Dave and I will be talking to cubers and organizers down at the <br>
world championship to see what makes a good competition. Like big <br>
screens and type of venue...etc. <br>

          <div class="email-content">The orientation parity error used on the 4x4x4 cube will fix that.  I
use Chris&#x27; alg:

r2).

That&#x27;s a long alg however, so a quicker way to do that is to find two
pairs like that and do the standard two edge flipper used on a 3x3x3:

M U M U M U2 M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2

Obviously though if you only have one edge pair that needs flipped
you&#x27;ll have to use the first alg.

Hope this helps.

DNS means did not solve.  It generally means that the cuber chose not 
to solve the cube.  DNF means that the cuber did not finish the cube.  
Sometimes it means the cuber was disqualified for breaking the rules.  
One such example would be stopping the timer while still holding onto 
the cube.

          <div class="email-content">Wow, thanks a lot.  I know the alg is a tad long but it is a lot
shorter than rescrambling the cube and trying again!  Cool, and I know
that one from the 4x4 since i get that parity a lot.  I think I tried
this once but I am infamous for screwing that alg up.  Cool and thanks
again.

A pure version that only swaps those 2 outer edges is either:

r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 (Chris Hardwick)

or

r&#x27; U2 l F2 l&#x27; F2 r2 U2 r U2 r&#x27; U2 F2 r2 F2 (Frédérick Badie)

I suppose the latter is faster since not turning the B layer :-)

Curious about who the &quot;favorites&quot; might be for the World 
Championships, I went and plucked all sub-18 averages (middle 3 of 5) 
from all rounds of competitions this year. The full list is below, 
with finals averages marked by &quot;*&quot;. 

Macky has 6 of the top 10 averages, and the top 3 finals averages, so 
I think he does have to be the prohibitive favorite.

However, Lars has been very solid all year long, and Ryan, Edouard, 
Jean, Yuki and Anssi have all put up sub-16 averages in competition.

This will definitely be a great WC - enjoy it, everyone!

Thanks everybody for the suggestions, esp chris. :)

Btw i dunno why but i thought abt these things u all said when i was
trying this weeks sunday contest and was getting some good times.
Ofcourse there were lucky cases but i got my new personal best avg
today -  36.78 secs! I really am stumped...how can just reading the
suggestions affect ur times? or isit just a coincidence?

Also i liked the finger tricks site someone had posted, still im
waiting for Dan&#x27;s videos though.

Thanks everybody.
Sachin.

          <div class="email-content">This is getting a little off topic I suppose, but I think this alg is
very interesting.

An even purer version for 4x4x4 supercubing that swaps only two edges is:
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27;

Per I&#x27;m sure you know about this alg, but still I wanted to post for
those who don&#x27;t.  This alg is in fact proof of the erroneous claim
that the parity is caused by the centers.  It swaps only lUF and rUF
on a 4x4x4.

The closest equivalent of this alg for the 5x5x5 supercube that I know
of is:
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r&#x27; l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U r l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27;

which swaps lUF with rUF and lsU with rsU.

For 5x5x5 supercubing you can spot the parity error when solving the
6th center, but of course if you accidently swap two &quot;+&quot; centers on
some other center by mistake this alg can be quite useful.

Ok, so this doesn&#x27;t answer the original question in a useful way, but
I do find these algs interesting as they affect so few pieces on the
4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes (making them quite useful for supercubing).

          <div class="email-content">Is there a way to find at least an upper bound for the number of moves<br>
(let&#x27;s say HTM) for swapping two edges in the same orbital and leaving<br>
everything else alone?  I&#x27;ve been chewed out for using the term<br>
orbital before, but it is the only word I know.  By orbital I mean the<br>
24 locations on the nxnxn even cube that a certain type of edge piece<br>
may occupy.<br>
<br>
The simplest example of course is swapping two edges (any two) on the<br>
4x4x4 supercube while leaving everything else unaffected.<br>
<br>
The alg I use is 27 moves long, which seems a bit much but maybe it is<br>
near optimal?<br>
<br>
I wonder what the shortest solution is?  Also interesting would be the<br>
optimal QTM alg length, since an odd number of inner face quarter<br>
turns is required.<br>
<br>
This beginning of an alg gets the edges into the correct position in<br>
11 moves, but can we cycle the centers all back in under 16 moves?<br>
r B2 U2 F d F&#x27; U2 F d&#x27; F&#x27; B2 <br>
<br>
Perhaps this isn&#x27;t the best strategy too.<br>
<br>
Anyway I just wanted to ask in case anyone had an idea how to approach<br>
this.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s totally useless and probably won&#x27;t help anything to know the<br>
answer, but still it&#x27;s interesting enough to occupy my mind when I<br>
should be preparing a class presentation for one of my courses<br>
tomorrow.  :-D<br>

Try this one instead:
F [U R U&#x27;, r&#x27;] F&#x27; r&#x27;
Gives you an equivalent result with fewer and nicer quarter turns.

For normal (i.e. not super) cube this should do it
with 19 HTM and 23 QTM:
(r U2)*4 r D x&#x27; [U&#x27; R&#x27; U, l&#x27;] x D&#x27;

Argh... me blind. Try this one with 18 HTM and 21 QTM:

r U (L&#x27;l&#x27;r) U&#x27; R d&#x27; R&#x27; U R d x&#x27; U (r U2)*3 r

I&#x27;d really like to build something around my by far favourite 4x4 
edge-3-cycles but I can&#x27;t yet:

(Rr) U R&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;
R U R&#x27; U&#x27; r U R U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;
(how fast can you do these?)

Ok ok... even better with just 15 HTM and 19 QTM:
r F d F&#x27; U2 F d&#x27; F&#x27; (r U2)*3 r

Oh, and sorry Chris, for hijacking your supercube thread with 
normalcube algs. But you can follow them with your U-center fix like 
you did with the other alg before.

Now I&#x27;ll have breakfast.

Cheers!

That PLL learning was only for feetcubing.
For normal solving I learned PLL July 2004.

I would definitely go as long as it&#x27;s during the school year (so

As a non-mathematician, I don&#x27;t have a well informed opinion, but I 
thought that &quot;orbit&quot; was the usual word for what you describe:

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupOrbit.html

I&#x27;m not chewing anyone out (ugh), just wondering what distinction is 
being made here. :)

I have studied ur alg on my cubix player. What u mean by lsU and 
rsU? What i find is that those 2 edges are the only external effect. 
Apart from that the inner 2x2x2 cube &quot;R-layer&quot; cause of r turns is 
moved one step ccw. That&#x27;s all the effects. So we have internal 4 
cycle as well.

Cheers!

True, but that /also/ agrees with the usual definition of an &quot;orbit&quot;, 
when you apply it to configurations of the Cube as a whole, rather than 
to just one part: The Cube group, applied to one position, gives a set 
of 4.3E19 different positions -- all &quot;correct&quot;, or all &quot;incorrect&quot; in 
the same way.  There is one set of correct positions, and 11 ways to 
have a twist or parity error, so the resulting 12 sets are the 12 
orbits you are thinking of.

I would only use that alg on the 5x5x5 supercube.  By lsu I mean the
only location on the cube lying in the interesetion of the l layer, s
layer, and U face.  rsu is similar on with the r layer, s layer, and U
face.

So this alg swaps only rsu with lsu, and lUF with rUF.

The regular parity alg swaps rUF with lUF, frU with blU, flU with brU,
and rsu with lsu.  After the parity alg I simply add another alg [r l
d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U r l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27;] to swap back all the affected X centers.

It&#x27;s probably not the most efficient alg, but it is easy to remember.
 Especially since it is 26 moves long.

How about:
l U2 r&#x27; (l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U r l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; r) U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; U2

Swaps FUr&lt;->UBr and Urs&lt;->Drs in 23/31 HTM/QTM compared to your 26/37.

here is what I got: http://www.speedcubing.com/events/dm2005/
if you can&#x27;t read German, well, it roughly says in the &quot;Preise&quot; part: 
1st prize: a trip for 2 people to the EC&#x27;06 in Paris (3rd/4th trimester).
just my thoughts...

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve also heard from another source (inside info :) that they would like 
to host it in France. Can&#x27;t remember when though, but likely after the 
summer. None of this seems to be set in stone though.

Gunnar: You can bet some money on that there will be some more 
competitions in Sweden though. And if we are lucky, we might attract 
some of our European neighbors.

of paper (bigger than the whole) loosely on top of where u are putting
the cap...then push the cap on hard...and make sure it is tight on all
sides...Then rip off the extra bits and throw them out, then
reassemble the cube.  Everyone once and a while you have to replace
the paper, but it lasts a while...

Haha, you just left a very positive mark :-). I *hate* glue. In case 
of the DIY cubes, it&#x27;s true, the center caps don&#x27;t fit. So first of 
all those two &quot;posts&quot; should be cut so that the cap at least fits into 
the center piece. From then on, it&#x27;s a matter of making it stay there.

Paper works, scratching the outside of the wall works, a tiny amount 
of glue is ok, too. You can also put some glue around the wall and let 
it dry so it&#x27;s just like an extra layer around the wall, and when it&#x27;s 
dry, put the cap on the center piece. I.e. don&#x27;t use the glue like 
what glue is intended for.

You can also try all four directions the cap can go onto the center 
piece. Usually they&#x27;ll differ so find the best one. And when you&#x27;re 
done, i.e. the cap fits and stays, you can cut/sand the outstanding 
parts, i.e. if the cap exceeds the center piece so that edge and 
corner pieces during play could catch the cap and pull/push it out.

Cheers!

The problem with me was my Java wasent working in linux, so couldnt
use JNetCube. I knew i had to find an alternative and the same day
Marco&#x27;s post came up abt his new timer to be developed (this is abt a
month back) . So i asked him for the code and he was happy to give it
to me to test it.

On using it for some time, i knew i had gotten addicted to it and one
day my windows crashed. so i went back to linux to use this new timer
and lol , MySql was giving problems this time. So again couldnt cube
while in linux. So the whole original purpose is defeated but still i
now use only this one.

Try it out once, you&#x27;ll like it.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all you 5x5x5ers,<br>
<br>
I have a question about block cycling.  On the supercube when doing<br>
the last center I solve the &quot;+&quot; centers first so I can spot and fix<br>
the parity, then I solve the &quot;X&quot; centers.<br>
<br>
I tend to use pure algs that only move those &quot;+&quot; centers, but I was<br>
wondering if a block alg would be faster.<br>
<br>
For example if I need to switch (fmU &lt;-&gt; rsU) and (bmU &lt;-&gt; lsU) I use<br>
the alg:<br>
m d m&#x27; U m d&#x27; m&#x27; U&#x27; m d m&#x27; U&#x27; m d&#x27; m&#x27; U&#x27; m d m&#x27; U2<br>
<br>
The m moves I do as (mr&#x27;R&#x27;)(Rr) and the d&#x27; moves I do as (Dd)(D&#x27;) etc..<br>
<br>
I was wondering if the block alg below would be faser?<br>
r&#x27; (um&#x27;) r U r&#x27; (u&#x27;m) r U&#x27; r&#x27; (um&#x27;) r U&#x27; r&#x27; (u&#x27;m) r U&#x27; r&#x27; (um&#x27;) r U2<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t ever really used block algs so I wanted to ask?<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s too late to try out the block alg, my roommate is asleep, but I&#x27;m<br>
going to time both tomorrow.  I just wanted to ask what others&#x27;<br>
preferences were.<br>
<br>
That case for the &quot;+&quot; centers is my worst case since the alg is so long.<br>
<br>
I also wonder if something like this would work:<br>
(Rr)2 D&#x27; (Ff)2 D (Rr)2 r l e2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U r l e2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)2 D&#x27; (Ff)2 D<br>
(Rr)2<br>
<br>
which simplifies to:<br>
(Rr)2 D&#x27; (Ff)2 D (Rr)&#x27; R&#x27; l e2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U r l e2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)2 D&#x27; (Ff)2<br>
D (Rr)2<br>
<br>
My old move is 35 turns in my big cube metric, the block method is 30<br>
since the block moves can be done with one finger.  This bottom alg is<br>
 31 but seems like it might be fast.<br>
<br>
Hmm... the block method alg is shorter.  Aaaah I wish I could time<br>
myself on these algs!<br>
<br>
Alright, well just looking for input from you block 5x5er&#x27;s.  Thanks<br>
for any responses.<br>

As if you really needed to ask... I play a bit of backgammon now and 
then, Lisa and I play each other quite often (I taught her how to 
play for my own ends lol) 

It&#x27;s a very cool game! Maybe we coupld play online sometime? :)

scrambles, manual input, rolling averages ;-) etc.. but it&#x27;s gonna
take some time. All I need is feedback, good or bad.

I&#x27;ll keep posting updates in the list for the next version or two to
give the project some momentum. After that I&#x27;ll keep it outside, so I
suggest that anyone that might be interested in updates to use the RSS
or the mailing list (it&#x27;s all there in the site).

I&#x27;ll take the opportunity for some thanks:
- Sachin for the patience with the testing.
- Jess Bonde for the first idea and the standard countdown beeps! (no
need to get used to another one)
- Rich (richd.com) for the great cube icons in the admin page.

Cheers,
Marco

Seeing this user problems, it would be nice if u created a default
account to just get the hang of the timer. Keep it w/o any login and
just keep the 12 solve avg. No need to add in the Db or something

this is so that ppl can just test the timer w/o the user hosting it
having to create a new login or something.

Sachin.

P.S. :- this is just like ur &quot;old&quot; timer where u would just keep the
post.php passwd protected so that the times wont be saved still the
timer was usable.

          <em>From:</em> JohnLouis Louis &lt;pjlmem@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Tue, 25 Oct 2005 10:23:21 +0100 (BST)<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Dear Ron, Tyson, Stefan &amp; others,<br>
       IT IS TOTALLY DEJECTED AND VEXED JOHN LOUIS.<br>
Without asking any question about our cubing ability,<br>
considering only my economic status based on self<br>
employment and no regular income,  our visa is denied.<br>
It is unacceptable for me. Bernett is disappointed. <br>
       So, the 25th anniversary rubiks cube world<br>
championship-2005 is going to be held without ONE OF<br>
THE BEST JUNIORS IN THE WORLD. Instead of trying to<br>
USA, We could have tried German and dutch cube day.<br>
       This is not the first time for me in my life.<br>
The same fate continuous for my son as well is hurting<br>
me.What I learnt in my life is - No need to be<br>
brilliant or intelligent,a Grand Master of Memory but<br>
to be born in a rich family or in a  rich country will<br>
do.<br>
       Now, the biggest problem for me is to return<br>
all the money donated to us. This I will do it<br>
promptly and immediately. <br>
       I will never ever apply usa visa in my life. I<br>
could have easily lied to them that I am working in a<br>
concern and produced aa appointment order and I have<br>
regular income. Just for the sake of a visa, I do not<br>
want to do it. <br>
       In my opinion, although the people at the helm<br>
of cube association and people of cubing community<br>
knowing the ability of bernett Orlando, the world cup<br>
is missing the best junior in the world solving 3*3*3,<br>
4*4*4, 5*5*5 blindfolded, speedsolving 3*3*3 in less<br>
than 20 sec, 4*4*4 in less than 2 min, 5*5*5 in less<br>
than 4 min, and megaminx in less than 5 min.<br>
        God knows the best for us and he will give us<br>
the best always. Hope he will let me born in a rich<br>
family or in a rich country next time.<br>
        <br>
        IF VISA TO USA IS DENIED FOR MORE PEOPLE LIKE<br>
US, THEN IT CAN NOT BE CALLED WORLD CUP!!!!!!!<br>
        Plz forgive me, if my words are bit harsh. My<br>
best wishes to all of you for WC-2005.<br>
Kind regards,<br>
John Louis<br>

Lots of interesting problems in that game, with scope for mental 
calculations.  I used to play it for fun quite a bit, but nowadays only 
with my children... it has simple rules, and doesn&#x27;t take as long as 
that boring race game Ludo (same as &quot;Frustration&quot;? I can&#x27;t remember).   

Thinks: If we played for stakes, it might also be a good way to claw 
back some of their pocket money. ;)

Well, that&#x27;s one day. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to have a life like that.
But congratulations Craig :-)

About that question too, I&#x27;ve seen something about Paris and the 
European Championship 2006 (I think, because I don&#x27;t speak german) on 
this page http://www.speedcubing.com/events/dm2005/ .
So is this right that the European championship would be in Paris next 
year ? (i&#x27;ve heard nothing about that for the moment so I don&#x27;t know)

That&#x27;s a little incomplete, isn&#x27;t it? Better:
m d m&#x27; U m d&#x27; m&#x27; U&#x27; m d m&#x27; U&#x27; m d&#x27; m&#x27; U&#x27; m d m&#x27; U m d&#x27; m&#x27; U

How about this instead:
[m s d s&#x27; d2 m&#x27;, U2]
-> 26 turns

Uh, I guess all those &quot;m&quot; turns should be &quot;e&quot; turns instead and also 
some more moves near the end:
r&#x27; (ue&#x27;) r U r&#x27; (u&#x27;e) r U&#x27; r&#x27; (ue&#x27;) r U&#x27; r&#x27; (u&#x27;e) r U&#x27; r&#x27; (ue&#x27;) r U r&#x27; 
(u&#x27;e) r U
-> 42 turns

Equivalent alg (you know it from 3x3 PLL):
[r U&#x27; l (de2) l&#x27; U r&#x27;, U2]
-> 26 turns

> I also wonder if something like this would work:

D
> (Rr)2

Yes it does work :-)
-> 31 turns (after your cancellation)

Simlarly does this (one alg split across three lines):
(Rr) U (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)
[r&#x27; l&#x27; e2 r l, U]
(Rr)&#x27; U (Rr) U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;
-> 30 turns (after cancellation) and easier/faster setup moves.

Finally here&#x27;s one more to try:
m2 U f2 m2 f2 m2 U&#x27; m2
-> 14 turns

Maybe execute it as:
m2 U x u2 m2 u2 m2 x&#x27; U&#x27; m2

Hope you like some of these :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

How did you make them stay? Did you use glue? In any case, I&#x27;d suggest 
a thin rectangular blade like this:

Wow!!   Stefan this alg is great!  I can&#x27;t belive I never though to do
that, especially after using the same idea for the edges of a 3x3x3
(U2 M2 U2 M2)

I think this alg is very intuitive, and also short (!), so I think I
might end up using this one.

> How about this instead:
> [m s d s&#x27; d2 m&#x27;, U2]
> -> 26 turns

This alg is very nice, I can see how you swap the pieces after seeing
the alg, but I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of that for some reason.  I think
I am thinking too much inside the box lol.  Need to think more 3D :-)

I really like your 14 mover, that one is very nice!

          <div class="email-content">Stefan, you&#x27;ve inspired me to come up with a new alg for my second
worst case, switching the X-centers as (frU &lt;-> brU) and (flU &lt;-> blU)
which I used to do as

l d l&#x27; U&#x27; l d&#x27; l&#x27; U l d l&#x27; U l d&#x27; l&#x27; U l d l&#x27; U&#x27; l d&#x27; l&#x27;
(41 moves)

and you don&#x27;t need the last U since the edges are still unsolved at
this step for me.

But now I really like this alg:
[(Rr)&#x27; (Dd)&#x27; L&#x27; u&#x27; R (Dd)&#x27; (Rr), U2]
(17 moves) since you don&#x27;t need to execute the last U2 since the edges
still need to be solved.

What do you think of this alg for the X centers?  Is there a better
for to do this case?

Thanks for the help!  These algs are great!

Chris

That (well, M S D S&#x27; D2 M&#x27;) is how I used to swap two edges of the 
first layer way back when... I started 3x3 with first layer corners, 
then edges.

Btw, you got me confused. Why do you want these pure algs? Do you 
solve centers last? I&#x27;d strongly recommend to solve centers first 
(unless your name is Per). And then you can have all kinds of side 
effects on edges and corners, you could then for example do this:

((Rr) U&#x27; (Ll) (Dde)2 (Ll)&#x27; U (Rr)&#x27; U2)*2
-> 16 turns

This one sadly only almost works:
[(Rr) U (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr), U2]
-> 12 turns (11 without last U2) and 2-gen

Cheers!
Stefan

That&#x27;s a nice one! You&#x27;re beginning to think ;-)

I just came up with this one, the commutator is nice and fast but it&#x27;s 
longer than yours:
x&#x27; (Dd) R2 [(Rr) U (Ll)&#x27; U2 (Ll) U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;, u] R2 (Dd)&#x27; x
-> 22 turns

You can of course also use yet another version of the 3x3 PLL:
((Rr) U&#x27; (Ll) (Dd)2 (Ll) U (Rr)&#x27; U2) * 2
-> 15 turns

Cheers!
Stefan

I didnt know that Ron won the 3x3x3 round. Congratulations to him. so
finally his bad streak is over, and maybe his good streak has started.
So everybody watch out for him in the Wc&#x27;s :)

also congratulations to everyone who won, and ofcourse Jean for his new WC.

Well, after I did the round checking out the bugs on twistypuzzles, I
found only a few in this program.

index.php?puzzletype=[XSS]
stats.php?puzzletype=[XSS]

Above are a few cross site scripting attacks.

It could potentionally lead me to gaining your password hash and
cracking of this would result in me having your or anyone&#x27;s password
on the site hosting the program.

Cross site scripting can result in all sorts of things like cookie
stealing.

If you steal a cookie, and replace your cookies with the ones you have
stolen, you can be the person you stole the cookies from online.

I urge you to fix these bugs soon, if you can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll grab a copy of
the source and write the bugfixes myself and send you a new copy.

Lets trust the yahoo group not to exploit this right now, eh? :P

~Thom

PS:

Where are the scrambles/ability to time generic puzzles? :P

PPS: 

There are also potentional SQL injection errors in the program also,
that can be worse thn XSS. but I&#x27;ve not forced any yet.

PPPS: 

Nice program.

Hmm, actually this isn&#x27;t bad if you do (Ll) and (Dd) instead of l and 
d. Then it&#x27;s just 23 turns. And it&#x27;s a simple technique that covers 
all cases. I use exactly that to permute LL corners of the megaminx 
(though for megaminx I think it&#x27;s closer to optimal than for the 
cubes, particularly X-centers). Oh, and if you hold the center you 
want to solve on L or R then you only have LlUuRr moves, might be 
better for finger tricks.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey.

Well, after I did the round checking out the bugs on twistypuzzles, I
found only a few in this program.

index.php?puzzletype=[XSS]
stats.php?puzzletype=[XSS]

Above are a few cross site scripting attacks.

It could potentionally lead me to gaining your password hash and
cracking of this would result in me having your or anyone&#x27;s password
on the site hosting the program.

Cross site scripting can result in all sorts of things like cookie
stealing.

If you steal a cookie, and replace your cookies with the ones you have
stolen, you can be the person you stole the cookies from online.

I urge you to fix these bugs soon, if you can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll grab a copy of
the source and write the bugfixes myself and send you a new copy.

Lets trust the yahoo group not to exploit this right now, eh? :P

~Thom

PS:

Where are the scrambles/ability to time generic puzzles? :P

PPS: 

There are also potentional SQL injection errors in the program also,
that can be worse thn XSS. but I&#x27;ve not forced any yet.

PPPS: 

Nice program.

How did you make them stay? Did you use glue? In any case, I&#x27;d suggest 
a thin rectangular blade like this:

Ton&#x27;s hammer method for fixing the caps, the alignment is so 
perfectly flush that there&#x27;s often nothing to grab onto.  In this

Hi David,

I know, I know :-). I wouldn&#x27;t tell it in any airport anywhere. Just 
joking inside our group here.

But really... Why did they scramble all the puzzles? Probably they 
were testing whether they&#x27;re real or fakes containing something 
hidden?

Cheers!

I reckon it&#x27;s worth celebrating every cubing milestone - whether it be
sub-60s or sub-30s! Everyone&#x27;s got to start somewhere. :)

          <div class="email-content">27 degrees Celcius sounds lovely. The weather over here has been pretty
crappy for most of the year. I&#x27;m sure native Londoners are used to it,
but as an Australian I&#x27;m finding it difficult to deal with the dreary
grey London weather!!

Hopefully no more hurricanes in Florida though. :/

          <div class="email-content">Congrats!  I set a goal for myself to get a sub-60 time and when I did
I kinda stopped cubing for about 2 years.  Now I&#x27;m going for a sub-30
average, which should keep me occupied for a while!  

Set a new goal for yourself and go for it!

I find this message amusing. Zarqa, I think you know why. :-)

If you&#x27;re going to average sub-60, you&#x27;ve really got to work on
solving the cross faster. It&#x27;s too slow. That&#x27;s my fault, not yours,
by the way. And your cube is really bad. lol. I&#x27;ll try to get you a
new (hopefully better) one next week.

Nice job with sub-60! :-D

this one time when i was in NY going to ellis island, they had to
search my bag because my cubes were in there.... kinda scary because,
you know, im &#x27;brown&#x27;, as they say it, and people are very
stereotypical.... luckily nothing really happened though

Hey about the timer... How do you get it to work?

I went to the site and got the folder, which had folders in it.  But
at that point I have no freaking clue what to do.
Any help would be nice.

I remember my happiness when i got my first sub-60 avg.

 But i thought it was too silly to post it here. But any new personal
achievement is good.

Congrats again and waiting to hear from u when u get sub-50.

I just got a 55 seconds average last week (after 1 and a half month 
of hard work) and a new personal record of 47 seconds.

BTW, I was able to get my times down by 12 seconds only by using a 
lubed cube. I am currently learning PLL and some finger tricks.

          <div class="email-content">To Alberto:

Well, though that isn&#x27;t really conventional notation, it is describing
the pattern in which the puzzle is strung.  LRLR is denoting a pattern
in which the strings in each little gap are alternating in direction.
 LRRL denotes a pattern in which the top and bottom strings share the
same direction, and the middle two are sandwiched between them going
perpendicular.

To David:

Though it is not essential, I also follow that advice.  Many of the
rubiks.com magics do not follow this stringing pattern, but any magic
that I make does.  Actually, even when strings break on my Magics
(that I haven&#x27;t made), I follow the sandwiching pattern.  This also
helps me to know which strings I have broken and which I have not.  If
a string has the alternating pattern, then I didn&#x27;t put it on the
magic.  Stefan recommends following the pattern that is already on the
Magic when replacing a broken string.  However, if you have a mix of
both, pick one and stick with it.  I do not know for sure that it
makes a big difference, but I conjecture that it does have some impact
on the functionality of the puzzle and how well it solves itself.

<br>
At the moment we only have more registered people than planned for 3x3 feet and 4x4 speed.<br>
But things can still change it the last few days, like what happened in Toronto.<br>
<br>
For 3x3 feet we solved it by letting competitors qualify on Saturday on the WCA stage. Only 4 finalists on Sunday.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

&gt; Hey everyone,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This is off topic, but does anyone here play backgammon in tournaments<br>
&gt; or for fun?<br>
<br>
I do.<br>
 <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ve recently gotten very interested in backgammon.  I&#x27;m really bad,<br>
&gt; but trying to study the game and maybe one day play a tournament.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Just curious if any others here play.<br>
<br>
There are some good books for learning backgammon.<br>
&quot;Play for profit&quot; by Joe Dwek is a nice example.<br>
http://www.gammoned.com/books/dwek.html<br>
is highly recommended for a start (if u like the book, you&#x27;ll<br>
probably go on).<br>
<br>
But backgammon is not serious.<br>
You&#x27;d better learn to play bridge instead ;).<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey there, I bought a rubiks cube from walmart about 3 and a half <br>
weeks ago.<br>
<br>
It saw some heavy use but the stickers kinda got dimolished.<br>

Then I ordered a Rubiks cube from Rubikscube.com, I ordered the one <br>
thats already put together blank and comes with the PVC stickers, <br>
which are awesome so far.<br>
<br>
My problem is, when I start going fast, this cube is too loose and <br>
probably 2 out of 10 times it pops, I know I&#x27;m not the best at <br>
lining it up perfect as I&#x27;m doing it but thats just way to many <br>

My question is, if its one of the blanks, with the rivets (I think) <br>
instead of the DIY ones, is there any way to tighten the cube up, I <br>
emailed rubiks.com and they said to join this group and ask you guys.<br>
<br>
My average time now is about 60 to 65 seconds, I&#x27;m still using the <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,

If your cube is too loose, and it has rivets, then the bad news is you
have to either get used to it being looser (which works up to a
point), or get a new cube.  I like the rubiks.com cubes, once they
break in they are very nice.  However once they pass their &quot;sweet
spot&quot; the cube is useless for speedcubing.

Basically you have two options.  If you like to be able to cut
corners, do a turn of a perpendicular layer before you have fully
lined up the previous layer, then I recommend getting another
rubiks.com cube.  Or, if you would prefer one with screws then I would
recommend asking Ton (http://www.speedcubing.com/ton) about getting on
the waiting list (if there still is one, I assume so) for a studio
cube.  Studio cubes are like the older stlye (non-arched centers)
rubiks.com cubes on steroids.  The plastic is a bit softer and it is
easy to sand down the edges if you want, or tighten the screws once
the cube starts to loosen up and make it last longer.

Or, if you want to avoid popping I recommend getting an arched center
cube.  Pop an edge out of your cube.  If the center piece is
completely flat on the inside surface you have an older style
rubiks.com cube.  Studios are like this also.  If the corners of the
center stick out fairly far and form a curves shape then you have an
arched center cube.

The 25th anniversary cubes have arched centers, as well as the
(white?) DIY cubes too.

Arched center cubes are not forgiving at all for cutting corners, but
once you improve your turning accuracy you can really fly on one.  I
used studio cubes forever, and then switched to arched 25th
anniversary cubes.  It took a while to get used to the arched centers,
but once I did my averages went down noticeably.

Basically, if you like the style of cube you have now stick with it. 
If you have a riveted cube, I recommend getting another one since
yours is getting too loose (preferrably one with screws, so either a
studio or DIY depeninding on how you like your centers).

Hope this helps,
Chris

P.S.  Congrats on the fast improvement!  60-65 seconds after only a
few weeks is quite impressive in my opinion ;-)

 I thought the problem with rivets is that you can tighten them but
not loosen them.

          <div class="email-content">All --

Thanks to everyone who replied to my questions about 4-look LL. I 
wanted to summarize the replies and give my interpretation of each 
subject.

1) Switch from: 

Orient Edges (OE) / Permute Corners (PC) / Orient Corners (OC) / 
Permute Edges (PE)

to

OE / OC / PC and PE (permute in whatever order works for you, PC/PE 
or PE/PC).

Why? It gets you started on the road to OLL/PLL, *and* recognizing 
corner permutation situation is usually faster when the corners are 
all oriented (an excellent point, raised by Tyson in email).

You have to learn at least the PC routines that don&#x27;t disturb 
orientation, and might want to learn all applicable OC routines (for 
less net turns), but you should see a gain in time.

This is a great suggestion, especially since I feel like I&#x27;m pretty 
quick on (pre-)recognizing OE and OC situations. I&#x27;ll probably start 
switching to this in another month or so.

2) F2L, F2L, F2L! F2L! (Hello?!?! McFly!?!? F2L!!)

Why? Getting your F2L rock solid and quick is the key to fast times.

I&#x27;m in total agreement here - I notice that for me a great F2L 
usually means a great time. While getting my F2L to the level of 
Chris Hardwick (who can average &lt;23 with a 4-look LL due to a world-
class F2L) is hard, the biggest time gains come from making your F2L 
fluid and quick. Pre-recognize situations, and react quickly.

2A) Turn faster.

Why? Well, duh...

No one suggested this, but it&#x27;s one of the core skills for being a 
speedcuber. I don&#x27;t do any sequence practice (like, say, doing 
the &quot;3-corner turner&quot; 20 times in a row), preferring to practice 
in &quot;real solve time&quot;, but perhaps I should, especially when learning 
new sequences.

There&#x27;s also the &quot;go slow to go fast&quot; motto, which I&#x27;ve found very 
helpful. Turn too fast, and your recognition time starts increasing 
dramatically. But practicing sequences is a good note.

So, I&#x27;ll continue on my recognition work, concentrating on F2L and 
being quick with inserting pairs. Later, I&#x27;ll probably switch to 
OE/OC/PC/PE, and give myself enough time so that I&#x27;m solid with that 
method by the SF tournament in Jan 2006.

Thanks again to all for their input. Keep on cubing!

- a mini 3x3x3 (about 1.5&quot; x 1.5&quot; x 1.5&quot; or 4cm x 4cm x 4cm). <br>
<br>
Cute as an be - the stickers were messed up, but it still works.<br>
<br>
- an 80s era pyraminx <br>
(http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/pyraminx.htm). <br>
<br>
It&#x27;s got a couple end pyramids that look a little hosed (I can see the <br>
steel ball and springs). Anyone know anything about fixing a pyraminx?<br>
<br>
- an original early-80s 3x3x3 cube. <br>
<br>
This thing is solid as a rock! It seems to weigh much more than my <br>
newer rubiks.com 25th anniv 3x3x3. It&#x27;s also very loose and makes a <br>
clacking sound when turned, so it seems like something Fred Flintstone <br>
would use. But I bet when cleaned up, lubed up and tightened (it looks <br>
like I can pop the caps and tighten the screws) it should be a nice <br>
cube.<br>
<br>
They all need a good cleaning, lubing, and new stickers, but it was <br>
fun to get these blasts from my cubing past.<br>

Well, or I&#x27;m unlucky or the white DIY cubes have flat centers...

Hey Chris,

If your cube is too loose, and it has rivets, then the bad news is you
have to either get used to it being looser (which works up to a
point), or get a new cube.  I like the rubiks.com cubes, once they
break in they are very nice.  However once they pass their &quot;sweet
spot&quot; the cube is useless for speedcubing.

Basically you have two options.  If you like to be able to cut
corners, do a turn of a perpendicular layer before you have fully
lined up the previous layer, then I recommend getting another
rubiks.com cube.  Or, if you would prefer one with screws then I would
recommend asking Ton (http://www.speedcubing.com/ton) about getting on
the waiting list (if there still is one, I assume so) for a studio
cube.  Studio cubes are like the older stlye (non-arched centers)
rubiks.com cubes on steroids.  The plastic is a bit softer and it is
easy to sand down the edges if you want, or tighten the screws once
the cube starts to loosen up and make it last longer.

Or, if you want to avoid popping I recommend getting an arched center
cube.  Pop an edge out of your cube.  If the center piece is
completely flat on the inside surface you have an older style
rubiks.com cube.  Studios are like this also.  If the corners of the
center stick out fairly far and form a curves shape then you have an
arched center cube.

The 25th anniversary cubes have arched centers, as well as the
(white?) DIY cubes too.

Arched center cubes are not forgiving at all for cutting corners, but
once you improve your turning accuracy you can really fly on one.  I
used studio cubes forever, and then switched to arched 25th
anniversary cubes.  It took a while to get used to the arched centers,
but once I did my averages went down noticeably.

Basically, if you like the style of cube you have now stick with it. 
If you have a riveted cube, I recommend getting another one since
yours is getting too loose (preferrably one with screws, so either a
studio or DIY depeninding on how you like your centers).

Hope this helps,
Chris

P.S.  Congrats on the fast improvement!  60-65 seconds after only a
few weeks is quite impressive in my opinion ;-)

Hey Jeff,

I agree with you completely about the practicing in &quot;real solve time&quot;.
 I think the only way to truly learn a new alg/trigger/F2L trick/etc.
is to recognize and use it once in a full blown timed speed solve.

Having said that though, I think rote drilling can be very useful too.
 I usually only drill my &quot;problem&quot; algs.  For example I recently
switched to Bob Burton&#x27;s &quot;H-perm&quot; (M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2).  For my style
of cubing slice moves are very uncommon, so I am constantly practicing
this alg as a warmup, or even just to work on it by iteself.  My
girlfriend makes fun of me since I do that alg so often she can
recognize the sound of it :-)

However, when I get the H-perm in a speedsolve, even though it uses
turns that are uncommon for me (slices) I still feel that I can
execute it quickly &quot;under the gun&quot; so to speak.

So I would recommend using the technique of practice by doing lots of
solves and seeing the cases in real time so to speak, but drill your
hard or potential &quot;problem&quot; algs very frequently too.

Just my $0.02
Chris

P.S.  The rote drilling of algs also works for algs with a very low
probability of occurence.  The OLL case of flipping all four edges
(all 4 corners are oriented) has a probability of 1/216 of occuring. 
I also drill that case a lot, since it is very rare to see it in a
speedsolve.

Do you ask that because of the 10 people mentioned for 5x5 
blindsolving? First I wondered, too, but seeing that made me think 
these numbers are just the limits and not actual (pre-)registered 
competitors ;-). Or are there so many 5x5 blindsolvers hiding out 
there?

Did I really say that? Uh, maybe I did :-). In Eindhoven when I 
repaired a Magic for one of the French guys, I guess.

That said, first thing I do when I get a new magic is to take it 
apart, lube the strings, and put it back together with the sandwich 
pattern. So all my magics do have that.

Yeah, one day I hope I&#x27;ll find that magical pattern that&#x27;ll allow me 
to let the magic do that (solve itself) without me touching it...

Like David mentioned already I think you can push the rivets in 
further, just not pull them out. Look again at how the rivet looks 
like:
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/diy_rivet.jpg

I&#x27;d only say they &quot;pass&quot; their sweet spot when they&#x27;re pushed in too 
deep already, but that should result in a stiff cube, not a loose one.

If you lube the cube and put washers under the springs so they don&#x27;t 
eat through the plastic, I believe they&#x27;ll last much much longer so 
it&#x27;s not like it loosens up all the time and you constantly have to 
tighten it. But I must admit I don&#x27;t use Studio cubes much yet so this 
belief is mainly based on pure thought, not much experience.

As far as I know, the white DIYs have flat centers. Someone here once 
said his has arched centers but hasn&#x27;t shown the pictures yet that he 
wanted to. The large image on rubiks.com does show arched centers but 
it&#x27;s a fake picture, you can read about this here:

Hi guys,

For a one handed solve, I know that only one hand is allowed to touch
the cube for the entire solve.  However, if a piece slightly pops out,
like it hasn&#x27;t popped entirely out of the cube but you have to push it
back in to continue, can you use your other hand for this, or would
that be a disqualification?  The cube I use for one handed solving
tends to do this a lot and I need clarification on what the rule would
be here.  Thanks,

          <div class="email-content">I was taking some 4x4 averages with the timer as set up on Chris
Hunt&#x27;s site, and noticed something strange.

A few solves into my 4th average, I stopped the timer after a
particularly quick solve.  I was somewhat surprised when the timer
read exactly 10.00 seconds.

I&#x27;m not sure if I somehow managed to tap the timer during the solve,
or if this is a legitimate malfunction.

Anywho, I&#x27;m just worried about my handy new stats reports.  Any
advice/help with the situation would be much appreciated.

I have not competed in a tournament since I won 3rd place in St. Louis <br>
back in the 1982 Rubik&#x27;s Cube-A-Thon National Finals.  I&#x27;m a bit rusty <br>
after 23 years, but I have managed to get my average down to the low <br>
30&#x27;s.  I guess I could qualify as a &quot;slowest improver.&quot;  Earlier today <br>
I clocked a 22.75 during an average of 12 practicing with a friend.  <br>
Not bad for a die-hard corners-first guy, but probably not good enough <br>

          <div class="email-content">Ya i have got those too sometimes.

But thats just a nice coincidence and i dont think its a timer bug.

Just one thing Marco, for the past two days i&#x27;ve been seeing that when
i complete the avg of 12 sets, the avg diaplayed in the rightmost
column, gets changed by exactly 0.01 when it is showed in the stats
section. Looks like a round off error or something. Plz look into it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I have reached 20.57 secs average with a 4-look LL. My last layer 
strategy is like this:

1 - permute corners

Despite what ppl might say this is not hard. There are only really 3 
cases. Either u fix the corners by only turning the last layer, u 
have 2 2-cyles (6 moves) or else u have a corner 3-cycle to do (7/8 
moves)

2 - orient corners

Recognition for this is also easy. Those corners who do not have the 
last-face color correct will need to be twisted. Then looking at 
only 1 of those corners to be twisted (and knowing how many to be 
twisted) u almost know which case u have. The exception is having to 
twist all corners. Recognition here is also easy. Only 2 cases.

3/4 - edges 

a - All edges wrong orientation

Do an edge 3-cycle to solve 1 edges (orients and positions the 
edge). Then another 3-cycle.
Exception is when we simply have to do the 4-flip.

b - Two edges wrong orientation

Do an edge 3-cycle to orient the edge (easy to learn).
Then do PE alg (only a handful cases, 3-cycle or 2 2-cycles).

In addition i know a few cases that solve all edges directly.

I know this is not the most efficient way to do a 4-lool LL, but it 
works for me. Been doing like that for 20+ yrs now, so im reluctant 
to change it. The number of moves for this is not good, but with 
turnrate 3-4 moves/sec 10-12 secs or faster in &quot;lucky&quot; cases is 
possible :-)

Cheers!

RPS isn&#x27;t serious, you better cube instead.

(will that close this thread or will someone dare to publicly claim 
here that there&#x27;s something better than cubing? ;-)

I don&#x27;t see any exceptions, and it sounds fair and logical to me.

          <div class="email-content">No, you have to assemble the cube with one-hand.  Can somebody explain 
why this is a rule from a logistical standpoint?

Think about it this way.  If you were to pop and you put the cube back 
with two-hands, you could potentially move the cube with two hands and 
it would be more difficult to judge.  If you&#x27;re forced to use one-hand, 
well, there&#x27;s no way you can cheap.

In reality, just don&#x27;t pop.

The cube can&#x27;t touch the table during preinspection?
But at the same time the rules state that we have to put the cube down
before we start the solve. Seem like we have to break one of the rules
every solve.

Hehe, I didn&#x27;t intend to close it, I think it&#x27;s a funny thread which 
also doesn&#x27;t take much time to follow. Was just wondering whether 
anyone would dare to suggest there&#x27;s something better than cubing :-)

I meant to put this reply in my Summary, but I forgot.

To go from one 4-flip move to two 2-flip moves, it turns out that I 
need a upper side orientation (U, U&#x27; or U2) in between, so it ends 
up being the same number of moves.

However, you implied a good point that I hadn&#x27;t though about, which 
is perhaps I can do the two 2-flips (plus U|U&#x27;|U2) faster than I can 
do the 4-flip. I&#x27;m giving it a try and it initially looks to be 
quicker - I&#x27;ll do some real timings and see how it plays out.

Thanks for the idea!

I&#x27;m not sure I want to be &quot;highlighted&quot; as a &quot;slowest improver&quot;, but:

I started in 1980, as a freshman/sophomore in high school. Got to 
the point where, with a layer-by-layer method, on a non-lubed cube, 
turning with my hands, I could average about 65-70 seconds. 

This was good enough for second place in the cube contest at the 
Lamar University (Texas) Mathematics Tournament in late 1981 (I 
still have the newsletter sheet listing my lighting fast time of 65 
seconds, only 2 seconds behind the winner).

Didn&#x27;t really do much with the cube (except play with it now and 
then) until Nov 2004, when I bought one at Target and started 
remembering my old LBL method. 

This time, the Internet was available and I was quickly amazed at 
the incredible times, along with all the newfangled methods and 
techniques (and still am). I also learned about the Jan 2005 
competition at the Exploratorium in San Francisco.

Relearned LBL, stayed with unlubed cube and turning with my hands, 
did some minor method optimizations, and averaged 65-70 at San 
Francisco.

Nine months later, I&#x27;ve learned cross/F2L, use 4-look LL, lube the 
cube, do some finger tricks, and am knocking on the door of a 40-
second average.

So, 25 years later (with the non-serious gap), not quite sub-40. Do 
I &quot;win&quot;? :-)

That was me -  my friend was reading, and convinced that his white DIY had arched 
centers. He had his DIYs confused I guess, because when we went to take a picture we 
realized we were wrong. I&#x27;m pretty sure all white DIYs are flat centered.

Relearned LBL, stayed with unlubed cube and turning with my hands, 
did some minor method optimizations, and averaged 65-70 at San 
Francisco.

Nine months later, I&#x27;ve learned cross/F2L, use 4-look LL, lube the 
cube, do some finger tricks, and am knocking on the door of a 40-
second average.

So, 25 years later (with the non-serious gap), not quite sub-40. Do 
I &quot;win&quot;? :-)

Hi Bryan, Guys,

I&#x27;ve heard three things:

1. the factory in China screwed up. They were supposed to make arched
center cubes, but used the wrong tools.

2. The first batch with flat centers was made with the wrong tools,
but a second batch had arches.

3. One cubist said he got arches on his white one.

I don&#x27;t know.

Cheers,

David J

So, just to confirm, let&#x27;s have a scenario:

I&#x27;m doing a one-handed solve. A piece POPs out. I put the cube down 
with one hand, pick up the piece with same hand, insert the piece 
with same hand, pick up cube with same hand, and resume solving. 

I should be fine (and not DQ) as long as I handle the situation as 
above, correct? (I didn&#x27;t &quot;intentionally manipulate&quot;, ie, use the 
table to turn a face or anything like that). 

I know that right now, a POP is a POP (no time, another attempt 
granted), but I believe that in the future a POP will not be 
special - you just fix it and continue on. So, I want to make sure 
the POP situation (in one-handed) could be covered &quot;legally&quot;.

Not that I POP in 3x-onehand, just that enquiring minds want to know.

This particular bug though can&#x27;t happen in a competition since we 
don&#x27;t use that timer there...

How about:

enough money to buy one on ebay. If you are going to RWC2005, and want<br>
a master magic, just bring me 2 normal magics that I can use to make<br>
it. I will do the rest free of charge (lining up the design, and<br>
stringing it).<br>
<br>
In case you want to take me up on this offer, simpson and harry potter<br>
magics go for like $5 on rubiks.com (which is alot better than the $50<br>
or so you would pay on ebay). I also need to know who is going to do<br>
this and how many they want. I will print extra designs, but not too<br>
many more than what i think people will want. Please reply if you want<br>
one.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Stefan, I remember a while back you posted alternative N algorithms, for both cases.  I adopted your algorithm for the one of the cases:<br>
<br>
(R U&#x27; R&#x27; U l U) (F U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R U&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; F R&#x27;)<br>
<br>
but for the mirror of that case, I remember trying out your algorithm and feeling kind of good about it, but forgetting to write that algorithm down, thus losing it altogether.  Is it possible that you still have (or maybe even use regularly) this algorithm for the mirrored case?  Currently, I&#x27;m using the mirror of the algorithm above adapted for my right hand to solve the mirroed case:<br>
<br>
(R&#x27; U R U&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27;) (U l U l&#x27;) (U R&#x27; U&#x27;) (R B&#x27; R)<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any help and for supplying the former algorithm above.<br>

A 70 second avg within 2 weeks is blazingly fast. Keep up the work and
u&#x27;ll get fast quite quickly. Maybe even surpass my 40 second avg :(

Keep cubing.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I have a bit of a problem with one of my cubes.  The spring on my<br>
yellow side broke, so whenever I turn the side now it goes farther<br>
than it should.  It also feels really loose.  It&#x27;s annoying because if<br>
I&#x27;m not careful when I flick U, sometimes it will do U2, for example.<br>
 This was the cube I was planning on using at WC, so I really don&#x27;t<br>
want to switch to another one with the tournament just a week away.<br>
<br>
The cube is a plain cube (no 25th anniversary or anything) bought at<br>
Toys R Us with flat centers.  If I pop the center cap off, is there<br>
any way I can get to the inner mechanism of the cube to get the spring<br>
out?  I figure if I can I can just replace it with a spring from a DIY<br>
kit or something.<br>
<br>
I guess if that doesn&#x27;t work out, I can just resticker the cube so<br>
that the broken spring is on my white side.  Since I make a white<br>
cross and have it on the bottom for my entire solve, I probably turn<br>
the D face much less than any other layer.  This probably won&#x27;t affect<br>
my solving too much.  It will certainly be better than having a broken<br>
yellow side where the vast majority of my turns take place.<br>
<br>
I just don&#x27;t want to have to switch cubes at this last moment before<br>
the tournament.  I really like this cube, and I haven&#x27;t been able to<br>
hit sub 18 with any other cube I have, let alone sub 17.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts/help/suggestions would really be appreciated!  Thanks,<br>
<br>

starts to happen with a certain frequency I&#x27;ll take a look at it.

About the scrambles, yes, it&#x27;s already one of the next features. One
thing I&#x27;ll need though are the scrambling algorithms, anyone wants to
donate one?

Im pretty sure that we will be using the first generation of 
stacktimer/stackmat. Seventowns have had stacktimers for yrs already 
and i can&#x27;t really see why they should have bought new ones. If we 
gonna use second generation i hope i get to practice it before 
competition since i&#x27;ve never tried it yet :-)

Cheers!

Rune, I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. As you know I&#x27;m swedish and I know

I think it&#x27;s the same alg, but I do pretty much execute it the way I 
wrote it now. My left hand never regrips, it only tilts the cube 
backwards a bit. Only thing the left hand is doing is hold the cube 
and occasionally pull a quarter turn with its index finger.

Do you think I had a different algorithm for this case? I don&#x27;t 
remember anymore right now...

If you do have a DIY cube then you could try using edges+corners of 
your good cube together with core+centers of your DIY.

Before you resticker, try upside-down-solving, i.e. start with a 
yellow cross. My problem with loose cubes is that I make (parts of) 
accidental turns especially of sides that I don&#x27;t turn but only hold, 
so having a loose white face could actually hurt you bad, too.

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to get out the rivets nicely and you&#x27;d 
need to do that to get to the spring. Well, maybe you can get the old 
one out (though I don&#x27;t think so) but there&#x27;s no way you get a new one 
in.

What you could do if you&#x27;re brave enough: saw through the core of your 
good cube so that you only destroy the core, not the center pieces. 
Then you can take edges+corners+centers+5springs from your good cube, 
and core+screws+1spring+optionallyWashers from your DIY.

Let us know what you end up doing :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Btw, how the hell did you manage to do that? That should be pretty 
much impossible. The springs have large wire diameter so they&#x27;re not 
exactly fragile. And the rivets have large heads that block how far 
you can pull the center from the core, thus also how far you can 
compress the spring, which is not much, not close to its limit where 
I&#x27;d at least somehow understand that a spring could break. Very 
strange... if you do get the spring out one way or another, can you 
show a picture of it? Maybe it was already damaged when it was 
produced?

I&#x27;m so sorry ;-). Should I have posted it earlier or later? I&#x27;ve been 
wanting to replace the other alg for quite a while but I was always

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gunnar,
It´s all too trivial. We have to study the question from  historical and ethymological aspects.
(First of all we can exclude that your father or grandfather renamed from a &quot;son&quot;-name. It´s impossible for many reasons, one of which is juridical).
There could be another explanation to the origin of the surname &quot;Krig&quot;. In old times, a poor captain  was perhaps  standing in front of a file of ten men, seven of wich by the name of &quot;Pettersson&quot;. Then he on his own responsibility (and fantasy!)  simply renamed them: &quot;You are Brave, you are Brisk, you are Quick&quot; and so on. If someone was renamed to &quot;Krig&quot;, I think it was whith the meaning  shown below.
Two and three hundred years ago almost everybody in Sweden held a son- (or daughter-) surname (as now in Island) and some simple renamed themselves. (Have you studied your own genealogy?). The old meaning of &quot;krig&quot; was &quot;strain&quot;, &quot;resistence&quot; (as now in Danish?) and I think That was the meaning of the word, when some of your ancestors - or his captain - found that name.
But of course, it´s all your will, be mister &quot;War&quot; or be mister &quot;Strain&quot;.

Hmm..
Rune, I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. As you know I&#x27;m swedish and I know 
my own name. Maybe you think I should have written: What is the 
english word for &quot;krig&quot;? I think most people understand what I meant

Thanks for your alg, I like it a lot.  Hopefully I will be totally used

Hmm, I&#x27;m getting better with the F-alg you can find at many places:
((R&#x27;U)(RU&#x27;R²))y&#x27;(R&#x27;U&#x27;RU)yx(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R²B&#x27;)

Actually I do the end more like (Rl)U&#x27;, *pushing* the U&#x27; with my left 
index finger so I don&#x27;t need to regrip for it. Depending on how I hold 
the cube before PLL, I might also do that last turn at the beginning, 
i.e.:
(U&#x27;(R&#x27;U)(RU&#x27;R²))y&#x27;(R&#x27;U&#x27;RU)yx(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R²)

It&#x27;s one of my slowest algs but at least I don&#x27;t find it ugly :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

It&#x27;s that time of the year again! This year, in the United States, <br>
Daylight Saving Time (DST) will end at 2 AM on Sunday, October 30. <br>
For countries in the European Union, summertime period ends at 1 a.m. <br>
UT on Sunday, October 30.<br>
<br>
This is your only chance of the year to solve a cube in negative <br>
time. I&#x27;ve provided this year&#x27;s scrambling algorithm on the Annual <br>
Negative Time Solving Contest page: <br>
http://cubefreak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/negative.html<br>
<br>
Please send your times to records@... with the subject <br>
line &quot;Negative Time Solving Contest&quot; and include your name, <br>
nationality, time, and a comment in the message.<br>
<br>
To submit your time, you must follow these rules.<br>
Rules:<br>
1. Use the provided algorithm.<br>
2. Begin your solve before daylight saving ends and complete it after <br>
it ends in the country you live.<br>
3. Please, don&#x27;t be an idiot! Remember that this is an unofficial <br>
contest. Please follow all the rules you would when submitting a time <br>
to www.speedcubing.com.<br>
<br>
Finally, thanks to Tyson Mao for bringing this awesome Caltech <br>
tradition to cubing, and to Ron and Chris for accepting submissions <br>
for this contest.<br>

I&#x27;ve tried lots of different adhesives for fixing a snapped center:<br>
-School glue: not strong at all<br>
-Superglue: never able to get that to stick to anything but my fingers<br>
-Plastic model glue: stretches and breaks over time<br>
-Silicone sealant: it was worth a try<br>

Judging from the schedule, I think they will have bought more since
then.  I expect to see either a mix of old and new timers or all new

if you did it at the exact end of daylight savings time, you could get
-24 hours.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

I think I&#x27;m just going to end up restickering the thing with white on
bottom.  I did some practice solves with a yellow cross and wasn&#x27;t
really affected by the loose D face.  I think the only way this could
potentially hurt me is if I do a COLL alg, where D turns are pretty
common for me.  As long as I am aware of this though and adjust my
speed accordingly, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.

I tried putting all the pieces from my good cube into the core of a
DIY.  I didn&#x27;t really like it though.  I really, really don&#x27;t like
arched centers.  I even tried sanding down the centers so they would
be flat, but still didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference.  The cube
probably just needs worn in still, but I&#x27;m not sure how good it can be
with the tournament only a week away.

I have no idea how it happened, but I don&#x27;t think it has anything to
do with the cube being defective.  This is actually the second time
this has happened to me.  Both times it was the yellow spring that
broke.  I didn&#x27;t really care before because that cube was very close
to retirement anyway, but this cube I only got 3 or 4 months ago. 
It&#x27;s probably just my style of cubing.  I like having really loose cubes
with flat centers, and I think that with my rough style it just wears
the cube down.  I&#x27;m kind of surprised that this isn&#x27;t more
common though.

I&#x27;ll have this cube with me at WC, so if you want you can check it
out.  If you take all the pieces out and just flick the center piece,
it makes a few full rotations before stopping.  There&#x27;s no tension
keeping it in the core, it kind of feels like it&#x27;s just hanging there.
   Again this is the second cube I&#x27;ve had this happen on, and it was
the exact same thing before.

Well, off to resticker this cube now.  :P

<br>
I just had a LIVE televsion appearance, together with Ron and Ton. It <br>
was very cool.. I got to do a full OH solve, and I did it in 34 <br>
seconds, which is about average for me. I also got to race Ron and Ton <br>
(normal speedsolve), and we all solved the cube in 14/15 seconds, <br>
though Ron was maybe 1 second faster (well done, Ron!). I hope I can <br>
get a digital version to put on my website soon..<br>

Don&#x27;t you mean close to -24 hours and close to -25 hours? Crossing the international date 
line would surely be a difference of 24 hours under usual circumstances.
To get the extra hour would depend on whether the clocks go back an hour at this 
longitude - not every country changes their clocks in this way. I&#x27;m not sure whether it 
happens near the international date line.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah sure, but still, you started solving at a certain time in a 
certain time zone, and you&#x27;re ending still at a future time at that 
time zone.

The whole purpose of the negative time solve is that you only have one 
chance at it each year.  It&#x27;s what makes it interesting.  It&#x27;s not 
necessarily the negative time.

You could easily cross time zones, but it doesn&#x27;t qualify.

Is that in the same way that average only qualifies for numbers of certain sizes and mean

I could imagine what he meant was the inconsistent terminology. In 
official competions we say &quot;average-of-5&quot; and mean &quot;do 5, then average 
middle 3&quot; whereas in the unofficial lists it means &quot;do 7, then average 
middle 5&quot;.

prefer to have it consistent.

That is, let &quot;average-of-N&quot; stand for either &quot;do N+2, average middle

other way for unofficial records.

Doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;d need to really change anything, we&#x27;d still do the 
same number of solves. We&#x27;d just use slightly different names, i.e. 
either &quot;average-of-3&quot; for what we do in competitions or 
&quot;average-of-12&quot; for what we do at home.

Yep, 4. I was just a little worried when he said he&#x27;s &quot;off to 
resticker this cube&quot; since that sounded to me like more than just 4 
stickers. And admittedly I myself first seriously thought about 
minimizing the number and twisted some pieces around before I realized 
I&#x27;m stupid :-)

I&#x27;ll try to address both your posts in one go - I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s a long post. That way you can 
save energy by choosing not to read one post instead of two. Nonetheless, if having read it 
you still find no value in anything that I write I will respect that as your opinion. My main 
point here is not really to have a go at you - even if that&#x27;s what you think - it is rather that 
I find many of your posts are quite hostile to other people&#x27;s ideas and I think that&#x27;s 
unfortunate.

You have to understand that I am not really from the cubing world as such and therefore 
am not au fait with all your terminology. I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a cubist - I&#x27;ve never 
been particularly fast or dexterous or skilled at it - and so on that basis you can feel free 
to disregard my post - but I am trying to support an idea of one of the other members, 
who probably is a cubist, and I think you should at least lend them your ear, rather than 
chewing them up about their post. I&#x27;m not being shallow or pointless - I&#x27;m in fact saying 
that a valid point was raised by someone in the group and I&#x27;m being supportive of it. 
Perhaps by &quot;pointless&quot; and &quot;shallow&quot; you mean supporting any opinion that doesn&#x27;t 
conform to your own. Particularly, in America, I&#x27;d have thought you&#x27;d support free speech.

You argue about &quot;The Negative Time Tommy&#x27;s run&quot; which has a 50 year tradition but then 
apply it to cubing which has certainly existed for less than 50 years but you don&#x27;t take 
mathematics and apply it to cubing. You feel quite free to change the meaning of 
mathematics, which fyi has a history even longer than 50 years.

In earlier posts you wrote a rather condescending message:

&quot;Emphasis is not necessary in the cubing world. It&#x27;s only necessary to
people who don&#x27;t know about cubing because an average with no times
truncated is referred to as a mean.&quot;

I don&#x27;t know too much about cubing evidently - I do know a little about mathematics. 
You see, I thought average and mean were originally used in a mathematical context which 
has a tradition of rather more than 50 years, yet you choose to define the terms to your 
own liking and not even to well-define them as you also wrote:

&quot;It seems to sound better one way for low numbers, and better for another way for higher 
numbers...&quot;

If you set up a well-definition such as: in the cubing context an average of n+2 cubes 
means the (mathematical) average of those times obtained by removing the best time and 
worst time (each removal only being of multiplicity 1 in the case of ties) and a mean of n 
cubes means the (mathematical) average (or, if you prefer, the arithmetic mean) of the 
times then I&#x27;d not have thought it ideal but at least it&#x27;s well-defined. (It&#x27;s still not an 
excuse to tear into someone who has a different (probably well-defined) definition.)

Writing:

&quot;Yeah sure, but still, you started solving at a certain time in a
certain time zone, and you&#x27;re ending still at a future time at that
time zone.

The whole purpose of the negative time solve is that you only have one
chance at it each year. It&#x27;s what makes it interesting. It&#x27;s not
necessarily the negative time.

You could easily cross time zones, but it doesn&#x27;t qualify.
&quot;

you disallow other contexts. Are we to understand that you can only set a negative time in 
Caltech (because that&#x27;s where the tradition of the negative time run lies)? I sincerely hope 
you didn&#x27;t go to Caltech purely so you could set negative times once a year.
Since crossing the dateline was proposed, surely you can&#x27;t be arguing that people can 
easily cross the dateline. Lots of people will never do that and many of those people will 
put their clocks back every year so that would afford them many more opportunities.
I&#x27;m not saying that the Caltech competition shouldn&#x27;t be just for the case you propose - I 
would argue that to disallow other &quot;negative time competitions&quot; doesn&#x27;t make much sense.

Also, writing:

&quot;For blindfold enthusiasts, this is also a great opportunity to try to
set your fastest blindfold solve ever! What makes it so awesome is
that if you fail, really bad things happen. I heard a rumor that the
world ends.&quot;

displays a staggering lack of knowledge of physics and an extraordinary gullibility in terms 
of the cosmos.

Even if we admit a concept of &quot;negative time&quot; it doesn&#x27;t mean the solve was faster. 
Fastness is a concept of speed and speed is a scalar quantity not a vector quantity. If time 
is presumed to go backwards that would not make things faster. Similarly the guy running 
the inside lane in the 400 metres does not set a time of zero because his displacement 
from the start of the race to the finish is not zero. His average velocity may be 0, but his 
speed is not. Rather it is the distance that counts, a scalar, not a vector.
If you consider the time to actually be faster, I don&#x27;t think there can really be a good 
argument against cubing crossing the dateline.

I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t have specific rules for your own competition but why not 
recognize a time in crossing the dateline - it is a similar idea. You argue that this is 
something that the event is special because it can only be done once a year. This seems 
inconsistent with your position that world records can be set at any competition, not just 
the World Championships (as Guinness would have it). I&#x27;d argue that the argument that a 
world record can only be set at a World Championships is nonsense and therefore in the 
same vein that negative time cubing can only be done under certain restrictive conditions 
is equally crazy. For most people, crossing the dateline is going to be a rarer occurrence 
than the clocks going back and forward so it&#x27;s even more of a special occasion - arguably 
not to be wasted solving a cube. What about people who live in countries where the clocks 
don&#x27;t go back an hour? - are they to be disallowed from trying other methods of getting a 
&quot;negative time&quot;.

&quot;I find it rather pointless and shallow for you to try to argue the principles of a competition 
for whose origins you do not understand. &quot;
Lots of people here talk about commutators and conjugation. Do they understand the 
principles of the origins of group theory? In many cases, probably not. Does it make it 
pointless and shallow to discuss such things? No. Does anyone take them to task and say 
- study algebra before you talk to me about commutators. No, because it&#x27;s rude and 
unnecessary. 

Having said all that, I will concede that I hadn&#x27;t heard of the &quot;Negative Time Run&quot;. As an 
attendee of CalTech, I&#x27;m sure you want to defend that tradition. You could have pointed 
that out originally rather than &quot;You could easily cross time zones, but it doesn&#x27;t qualify.&quot;. I 
still don&#x27;t agree that this is the only context that you can set this sort of record. I can 
agree that such rules can be stipulated for this particular competition. I can&#x27;t agree with 
the tone with which you often reply to people.

I realize that as the guardian of cubing rules, terms and all such matters you will likely 
have the support of most people in this group in this debate. That&#x27;s fair enough - you are 
a cuber and I am not. Nonetheless, I do think find you to be very argumentative against 
anyone who happens to hold different opinions than yourself on any sort of matters so I 
will try to defend the possibility that other ideas can be entertained.

Uh, to prevent misunderstandings: I meant to say they can talk, i.e. 
it&#x27;s not one-way telling only. I asked my dad questions to know what 
to do next. It was our only attempt, btw, he&#x27;s not really interested 
in cubing so I didn&#x27;t want to bug him more. But I&#x27;m gonna find more 
non-cubers and beat that time :-)

I saw the words physics and cosmos in there and well, yeah, that&#x27;s 
really not the point.  The tradition of the negative time Tommy&#x27;s run 
is that it is solely done on the day when daylight savings ends.  Doing 
it across the international dateline, would, while, be &quot;negative time&quot; 
in the sense, but it&#x27;s not the &quot;negative time&quot; tradition in the way we 
have done things.

Seriously, it&#x27;s like saying &quot;Ditch Day is Tomorrow&quot;.  We know it&#x27;s not 
really &quot;tomorrow&quot;, but it is in fact named &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.

You don&#x27;t want to fight physics with me.  First of all, physics and 
cosmology have NOTHING to do with any of this.  I don&#x27;t see why you 
bring it up.  You can start your own &quot;negative time&quot; tradition if you 
want, but the way we do it defines that it has to be on the day 
daylight savings ends.

This record, and this record alone is one that is only achievable once 
a year.  It&#x27;s a competition that&#x27;s just for fun and is NOT recognized 
by the WCA.  I don&#x27;t see why you bring up the issue of having world 
records only being set in world championships.

This whole this is ludicrous.  Either participate in the manner that we 
have requested, or don&#x27;t participate at all.  You alone are responsible 
for holding up to the honor of the rules we have set down for this 
competition.  If you choose to do it otherwise, in an intentional 
manner, well... whatever.  It doesn&#x27;t matter.  Winning this competition 
doesn&#x27;t make you a better cuber anyway.

I&#x27;ll be at the Pop resort from Thursday to Sunday night.  I&#x27;m 
thinking the best time to get stuff from me will be Friday 
afternoon/evening, if you need it before the competition.  

The t-shirts are Cubesmith WC2005 shirts.  I think that they&#x27;ll be 
really nice, I&#x27;m picking them up from the printer on Monday, so I 
may post a pic of the design on my site before I leave.

See you guys there.

Chris

Thanks for a measured reply to my lengthy post. Hopefully this post is more amenable.

Perhaps if you had mentioned the &quot;Negative Time Run&quot; in the original email as a reference 
people could have considered the full spectrum. Of course, you may not want to have to 
do this every year. In that case, it would be a good way to start a reply as to why you 
disallow the crossing of time zones and so on.
Also, I did say that I was happy to agree with the rules of the particular contest in 
question;  I am not complaining about your contest.  Indeed, I wrote &quot; I can agree that such 
rules can be stipulated for this particular competition.&quot; I respect that for a competition you 
set up you can create the rules.

I am saying that crossing the dateline is a valid way to get a negative time (in the sense of 
starting at an apparently later time than finishing) and that this can be recognized in the 
same way but not that it counts towards your specific competition, which I agree has 
certain specified rules.
It&#x27;s a bit like when people used to say that Concorde flew from London to New York and 
arrived before it left. It didn&#x27;t really but it ended up in a time zone that had that apparent 
effect.

Nor should you have to do so. I was rather trying to say that there can be a broader 
context for negative time cubing than in this one contest. I did, in fact, concede that the 
particular competition as such had particular rules and it was not my intention that they be 
changed.

I can also agree with that - the word &quot;this&quot; makes a big difference. Probably though I&#x27;ll 
either be 1) resting my ageing self, 2) trying to catch up on my DVD collection or 3) 
getting better algorithms for BCFSSS (the advanced method in my trilogy of 
blindfold systems).

The comment about the cosmos was mainly because you&#x27;d said that the world would end 
if someone tried and failed to solve the cube correctly during the competition. : )

I added on the part about fastness as an afterthought because there is a valid difference 
between concepts like speed and velocity and whilst you may finish the cube &quot;before you 
start&quot; in some sense, it doesn&#x27;t actually make you &quot;faster&quot;.

I never demanded that - I said that it was valid for negative time cubing, but I didn&#x27;t mean 
that it was valid for your particular competition. That&#x27;s why I mentioned that Guinness only 
recognizes one competition - which most of us believe is not a good thing - but to 
disagree with them and say negative times can only be achieved once a year is 
inconsistent. If you like, you can think of it as being a bit like setting a stadium record in 
athletics or like the Open in golf. Winning the Masters has a great deal of prestige, but it 
doesn&#x27;t carry the same prestige as the Open, the older competition. Setting a negative 
time in the Caltech competition could be considered to have high prestige in a similar way. 
It doesn&#x27;t, to me, mean that you couldn&#x27;t do a negative time somewhere else or in another 
context.

Agreed it would be difficult to have a competition going over the dateline.
It could be done, in principle, though. Particularly, if one really wanted to, one could 
probably go down near Kiribati and take a boat out.  
It&#x27;s a bit of a stretch but then again, people devote a lot of time to getting to sub-20 and 
so forth. If such a cuber was in Kiribati on holiday, I think it&#x27;s quite possible they would 
conceive of setting such a time, at least as an individual if not in competition. 
Some people can be quite driven. Consider the case of Dale Webster, the surfer who surfed 
every day for over 28 years (including his wedding day and on the birth of his children) 
and it might not seem so improbable.

I&#x27;m not going to agree that harshness is valid. It&#x27;s still possible to put across a point of 
view - and in the case of a competition you set up one with a greater amount of authority 
(especially if you fill in the background details) - without being harsh. Had your original 
post made clear that you had set up the negative time cubing contest and explained a bit 
about the history I am sure I would not have been provoked to such a response as I was. I 
might still have argued that - outside of the constraints of that specific post - there is a 
valid setting for crossing time zones to set &quot;negative times&quot;.
I am agreeable to your email.

:  )
That&#x27;s not really what my point was - but I enjoyed reading your reply. Not a butt-kicking 
perhaps, but certainly I&#x27;d agree that such  requests would be impracticable if carried 
through to the logical conclusions. You may not believe it, given my earlier email, but I&#x27;m 
generally for trying to settle even matters such as this in a fairly genial way.

For what it&#x27;s worth - I didn&#x27;t save those posts on average/mean. I just searched for them 
yesterday in trying to make the point that if notation is to be standardised it should be 
consistent and well-defined (and also as I remembered it as criticising someone for using 
a particular phrase which it seemed didn&#x27;t really have an official definition). 
I&#x27;ve not got a really big problem with using either mean or average to represent some kind 
of truncated mean in a specific context (e.g. the cubing world) as long as it is well-
defined. What I didn&#x27;t like was that you basically had written that real cubers would know 
the difference (which I read to mean that people who disagree with you aren&#x27;t real cubers), 
which I don&#x27;t think is a valid way to treat someone&#x27;s post and then to say that in the 
context of big cubes one term should be used whereas for small cubes the other should 
be used (and without even a clear point at where small ends/large begins).

          <div class="email-content">Hmmm.

Seeing this posting marathon i thought i would also post some of my views.

I agree with GameOfDeath in some respects. First of all i also think
that the -ve time solving shouldnt only be considered as the &quot;Caltech&quot;
original competition but i think i should be generalised to suit to
the rest of the world too. I mean finally whats the basis of this -ve
time solving? Its finishing a cube apparently before starting it due
to the way time is handled.

So the process of resetting the Daylight Savings Time offers an ideal
time fo it to do so. But in many countries this Daylight Savings Time
is not at all accepted and i think there is debate in America itself
as to whether continue it or not. So the point that GameOfDeath said
about making it more general by letting the time difference across the
timezones also valid is a correct one. If u think clearly then u&#x27;l see
its principally the same. As to the popularity aspect of it, i think
more ppl cross timezones that be in America(or whereever DST used) at
the particular day at which it is going to be resetted.

And for the implementation part of it, surely it will be somewhat
difficult to do the inspection and everything perfectly, but since
this is just an unofficial comp and we are just doing it for the fun
part of it, making the solve within 2-3 mins of crossing the time zone
should perfectly be fine and if i do it i would feel just as proud.

Abt the second part. I also think that Tyson is quite a bit harsh when
he thinks people are disagreeing him. I dont know if his personality
is like that or there is someother problem but ppl may get offended by
it sometimes. When i was a newbie to this group i thought maybe he is
the ultimate authority or something, but then i found out nobody is
the ultimate authority afterall, every decision are taken by the whole
WCA board and not by one person. And for Tson i would suggest going
through Ron&#x27;s postings (who is also a WCA member) and look how
diffirent they look from urs.

that is all i wawnt to say, now its upto u that u want to change urself or not.

Sachin.

I did, but he also sent it to me via email and I responded via email, 
too, cause we&#x27;ve been talking that way a lot in the past.

And yes, it&#x27;s very sad if people really try to come, organize 
sponsorships, practice hard, and then are denied by people who don&#x27;t 
give a damn. If I understood correctly, they didn&#x27;t even check the 
intentions (cubers going to their world champs) but assumed illegal 
immigration or terrorists or whatever right away...

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, that&#x27;s why I explained first what edges and corners are and what 
correctly solved pieces are. Only to have an 11-cycle and a 7-cycle 
then ;-)

Next time I&#x27;ll try without prior explanations/instructions. I suggest 
the following procedure:

1) Find a non-cuber, i.e. a person who doesn&#x27;t have a clue how to 
solve the 3x3. You can tell him some background info like you&#x27;d like 
to try an experiment by solving the cube blindfolded using his eyes, 
but you can&#x27;t give him instructions or explanations before you start 
the timer.
2) Do some initial scrambling cause non-cubers can&#x27;t even scramble 
well.
3) Let him scramble a bit further while you put on the blindfold.
4) Let him give you the cube.
5) Start the timer.
6) Solve the cube. You can talk whatever you want, but he can touch 
neither the cube nor you (otherwise he could touch a part of your hand 
in order to point to a piece or sticker). That is, he&#x27;s only good for 
looking and talking.
7) Stop the timer, take off the blindfold and check whether the cube 
is indeed solved.
8) Tell us about it :-)

Also works with a &quot;she&quot; instead of a &quot;he&quot;, of course. Maybe that&#x27;s 
even better...

Cheers!
Stefan

I forgot step 4.5: tell him the rules of step 6 so he doesn&#x27;t violate 
the rule unknowingly...

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Rune Wesstrom. Ron and Stefan replied me. But they can not do anything more than that. 
I would like to reinstate that the visa denial is  the denial to the best junior in the world at the moment. RWC-2005 is not only missing one of the the best , but also stops him from cubing anymore.The reason to the denial is unfair, in my opinion.  When people like me - self employed with few lakh rupees as bank balance - can not go to USA, It is untouchability. I do not understand how the Visa Officer find out that I will NOT quit USA after the championship in that 2 min interview without asking any question or testing about  the level of our cubing ability. More over I have already travelled 5 times to other countries and returned.
I pray almighty, the same shame should not happen to any other cuber!!!!!!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Sachin,

Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it works that way!

Another example... when making international calls *from* the UK to
other countries, Telediscount is very cheap:
http://www.telediscount.co.uk/ I can call a landline in Australia for
1p/min (about 1.8 US cents/minute). I don&#x27;t know about calls from India
to other countries (never been to India) but there may be some cheap
call equivalent.

Btw correct me if im wrong but i think the Indian officials didnt have
anything with the rejection right?

And why are u saying that it is stopping Bernett from cubing anymore?
Plz dont let this incident let his interest in the cube to dwindle.
Ofcourse he must be disappointed but still theres always next time.
Hopefully we may even start having some competitions in India itself
(im trying for that) . Let him stop cubing for a few weeks if he wants
too but not completely.

One more thing, why dont u go to the papers with this incident? Maybe
publisizing this event might stop this from happening further, and may
even help future competitiors like me for example.

Another variant:
Why not organize &quot;a part&quot; of the WC in India ( for Bernett only)? India is big country  and there must be a lot of credible people there who could guarantee a correctly made contest.

Shhh, don&#x27;t tell the secret...

But yeah, that&#x27;s almost like we did it. Except I don&#x27;t start solving 
*after* asking questions, instead asked questions along the way. More 
efficient and less error-prone. I hope to beat 2 minutes next time.

If really nobody from outside USA could enter it I&#x27;d suggest calling 
it US Nationals and running the world champs somewhere else :-)

          <em>From:</em> Crispy &lt;redivre@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> Rubix Speed Solving &lt;speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Sat, 29 Oct 2005 12:55:48 -0700 (PDT)<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">I recall around September there was a string of posts<br>
talking about the official Rubik&#x27;s timer.  Peoples<br>
opinons, pros and cons, etc...<br>
<br>
Since that time I actually purchased one.  Why not see<br>
what all the fuss was really about.  Now I know I am<br>
not the best person to be reporting on the<br>
functionality of a timer but here is what I think.<br>
<br>
Overall it is pretty handy.  I can toss it into my<br>
backpack and take it out anywhere I am, the park, a<br>
restaurant, a work at lunch, on the plane to Orlando,<br>
everywhere.  It holds all my solve times for each cube<br>
size, generates the scrambles for each cube size<br>
(which is handy if you aren&#x27;t at your computer), keeps<br>
an average (rolling or not) - it allows you to option<br>
to record a pop, you can increae or decrease the<br>
inspection time.  It is light, pretty durable and<br>
definatly more effecient than rolling out a stackmat<br>
(although with the gen2 stackmat you can remove the<br>
timer piece).<br>
<br>
It runs on batteries or you can go and purchase the<br>
correct AC adapter and you can plug it in - it also<br>
works with the tournament displays (always a plus). <br>
It eliminates the need to start/stop the timer with<br>
your hands - the cube does all the work so once you<br>
lay it down - that&#x27;s it.<br>
<br>
Plus you can use this while sitting on the couch or in<br>
a chair, where again the stackmat is a little harder<br>
to use since the senors and the display are so far<br>
apart and you generally need a hard surface for the<br>
stackmat timers to register your hands(something solid<br>
to push against)<br>
<br>
There are however a few draw backs as well. I have<br>
been spoiled by the online timers that have created<br>
and provided from those in the community.  During the<br>
inspection time of the official timer if you don&#x27;t put<br>
it down and pick it back up before the timer runs out<br>
there is no time.  If you set for 20 secs of<br>
inspection you have to inspect, set it down, and pick<br>
it up to solve bfore the 20 secs run out.  Also there<br>
is no beeping at the final three seconds which is hard<br>
to adjust to - but doable after a while.<br>
<br>
If you don&#x27;t set the time just right you can&#x27;t see the<br>
display.  If you have it on a table you have to look<br>
directly down at the display it is hard to see at an<br>
angle and the display doesn&#x27;t pivot (like some<br>
calculators).  I think if they decide to mass produce<br>
this item or create more of them this may be a<br>
function that they may want to include.  How many<br>
people sit a timer down and look directly down at it<br>
to see the numbers?  Not many, some of us are lower<br>
down or see it at an angle.  <br>
<br>
If you are cubing rather close to the mat you have to<br>
becareful because the sensor is extremely sensitive<br>
(which is good and bad).  If you are too close or in a<br>
shady room the sensor will catch your shadow as<br>
setting the cube down, the time will stop and you<br>
won&#x27;t even notice until you actually set the cube down<br>
and look at the timer.  Of course that only seems to<br>
happen on the times that you think are pretty good and<br>
you look at the timer and it says like 7secs.....damn!<br>
(espeically if you are doing an average - there is no<br>
way to remove that time)<br>
<br>
Overall I think it was a rather ingenious design.  It<br>
has its good and its bad just like some of the other<br>
timers.  It just all depends on the person using it to<br>
what they like or don&#x27;t like.  <br>
<br>
So there is my 2 cents of the official Rubiks timer. <br>
Any one else purchase one or use one?  If so what are<br>
your thoughts?<br>
<br>
:)<br>

<br>
I just want to let you all know, that I had one of the greatest days <br>
of my cubing carreer today :). (For those of you who don&#x27;t know: I <br>
won the Dutch Championships). The secret is: Koen was right with his <br>
comment on that photo... I infiltrated in the &#x27;team absolute&#x27;. <br>
<br>
No, just kidding ;). Actually, there is no secret, I was just in a <br>
very, very good shape today :). I am so excited about the whole <br>
competition, and for the very first time, I had my own digital <br>
camera, so I have a lot of nice pictures to share with all of you. <br>
I&#x27;ll put them on my website some day.. Allthough I don&#x27;t know if <br>
I&#x27;ll do that before the worlds.. The next two days will be quite <br>
busy for me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks to all cubers that inspired me, especially all the <br>
Dutch cubers for comming to the meetings and motivating me that way.<br>
<br>
Hope to see all of you soon (IRL!),<br>

Hmm, Ron also seems to be doing much better than in the past (before 
Dutch Open 2005).

Looking forwards to the pictures... and meeting you again soon!

Congratulations on your Dutch Championship title! I knew ever since I met you, that one 
day your were going to be a very dangerous opponent and it&#x27;s great to see you produce 
the kind of stuff you&#x27;re capable of.

I also want to offer my commiserations to Ron because he is finally getting some match 
rythm going, although today it wasn&#x27;t good enough to beat Joël. I hope he can continue in 
the same vein because nobody likes to see someone struggle in a competition.

See (most of) you on tuesday!

Lars

That helps a lot: I gave it a shot after all.
Started 1:59:55 BST, finished 1:00:24 GMT.
I wasn&#x27;t expecting to go sub-30 (real time) but it turned out that the cube was pretty easy.

          <div class="email-content">about the india thing...

i think there should be a &quot;chapter&quot; or something like that.
maybe we should have chapters all over the world. like, the US
chapter, the UK chapter, the Japan chapter, the India chapter....
etc...

i dont know, i guess im just rambling. but it would sound more official.

and johnlouis louis (im sorry, i really don&#x27;t know your name), don&#x27;t
feel bad about the visa thing. it happens all the time. and we know
how hard it is.

but don&#x27;t let that stop him from cubing. no one in the indian
government is going to care if he stops cubing or not. the only way to
combat it is by, as sachin said, take it to the media. the media is
powerful. they can get things done.

i wish you guys the best of luck

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
Yes, congratulations to Joël for his great performance.<br>
Joël can still do much better than this. His standard times outside competition are 14 seconds (12-17 range). Same as mine, but he seems to be making fewer mistakes when the competition is tough.<br>
So watch him in Orlando!<br>
<br>
Personally I am much more confident than ever. We had a great team of volunteers again today (Pim and his son Bart, Nike and Anne), so after getting up very early and setting things up at the fair, I didn&#x27;t have to work very hard anymore. Just some instructions here and there, and managing the time schedule was enough.<br>
In the final I made three mistakes, which were too many, but still my average was not bad.<br>
<br>
In my first solve of the final I dropped the cube, saw that I had one layer turned, picked it up, corrected the move, stopped the timer. I actually think I had better stopped the timer immediately, because it may have taken more time than the 2 seconds penalty to see and correct it. Maybe the penalty should be higher????? In the future (2007?) we may even see that a full move off is a DNF (half move off is 2 seconds).<br>
<br>
I think we should have the final at the beginning of the day, before the 1st round. :-) At the end of the day everyone is getting tired (especially the organizers) and it is getting hotter with less oxygen in the air.<br>
<br>
My hint to all: if you feel like your eyes aren&#x27;t completely clear anymore: try some cold water! I have a bottle water with me and wipe my eyes with water before I compete. It freshens up your view. :-)<br>
<br>
On Friday we had a fun day with two Dutch National tv appearances. On Friday night Joël did a 34 seconds solve one-handed on live tv. Ton, Joël and I competed in that show with me winning slightly (15 seconds to Joël 15.5 and Ton 18.5??). On Friday afternoon a very popular evening show recorded an item with Ton and me at my place. Ton was able to show parts of his collection and you see the two of us solving for speed. At the end of the item I had to solve a cube in 20 seconds, including explanation of all steps. I succeeded, but I do not think anyone at home was able to understand the explanation. :-)<br>
The funny thing is that even when you were clearly visible on tv, the next day people from audience talk to you and say: &quot;did you see that guy on tv yesterday night? he was great, he showed how to solve the cube, in 20 seconds!&quot;. :-)<br>
<br>
Ton is a strange guy. If you have a collection of 600 or more different pieces, and you have your special moment where you can show one item to the audience on live tv, which would you show? Well, Ton showed the world an old, worn out light blue box with a Politechnika cube from 1978... Booooooring. :-) Why not your solid silver cube, or your signed cube or your most expensive cube??????<br>
<br>
Orlando, here we come! This is going to be to biggest cubist reunion ever.<br>
I hope there will be a media hype, so that we can grow more, have more competitions and have more fun than this already great year!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>
Ron<br>
PS: the upcoming event calendar is almost empty now, please start planning a competition near you! We will help you in any way.<br>

  Hey guys :),<br>
<br>
  I just want to let you all know, that I had one of the greatest days <br>
  of my cubing carreer today :). (For those of you who don&#x27;t know: I <br>
  won the Dutch Championships). The secret is: Koen was right with his <br>
  comment on that photo... I infiltrated in the &#x27;team absolute&#x27;. <br>
<br>
  No, just kidding ;). Actually, there is no secret, I was just in a <br>
  very, very good shape today :). I am so excited about the whole <br>
  competition, and for the very first time, I had my own digital <br>
  camera, so I have a lot of nice pictures to share with all of you. <br>
  I&#x27;ll put them on my website some day.. Allthough I don&#x27;t know if <br>
  I&#x27;ll do that before the worlds.. The next two days will be quite <br>
  busy for me.<br>
<br>
  Anyway, thanks to all cubers that inspired me, especially all the <br>
  Dutch cubers for comming to the meetings and motivating me that way.<br>
<br>
  Hope to see all of you soon (IRL!),<br>
<br>

of our club, so if you run into one of us, you&#x27;ll know who we are.<br>
<br>
Leyan - most likely asleep.<br>
Mark Polinkovsky - overuses the word &quot;bum&quot; and talks excessively about <br>
Moldova<br>
Mark Sullivan - big gap between his big toe and second toe.  clearly <br>
visible when wearing open toed shoes<br>
Inadomi - ninja, will pounce from the shadows and say hi<br>
Daniel - freshman, will be ordered around by the rest of us<br>
<br>
So feel free to come by and say hello!  Though... it might be hard to <br>
catch Leyan.  He likes to sleep between solves.  Oh, and feel free to <br>
order Daniel around too.  The freshmen need to build some character.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Christy,<br>
<br>
Thanks for your valuable opinion. I enjoyed reading it.<br>
<br>
I also like the Rubik&#x27;s Timer. It has all the functionality for home use, without the need for a computer for the scrambles and averages.<br>
I wish the timer for competition use, the Stackmat, would have similar functionality.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Official Rubiks Timer Opinion (just my 2 cents)<br>
<br>
<br>
  I recall around September there was a string of posts<br>
  talking about the official Rubik&#x27;s timer.  Peoples<br>
  opinons, pros and cons, etc...<br>
<br>
  Since that time I actually purchased one.  Why not see<br>
  what all the fuss was really about.  Now I know I am<br>
  not the best person to be reporting on the<br>
  functionality of a timer but here is what I think.<br>
<br>
  Overall it is pretty handy.  I can toss it into my<br>
  backpack and take it out anywhere I am, the park, a<br>
  restaurant, a work at lunch, on the plane to Orlando,<br>
  everywhere.  It holds all my solve times for each cube<br>
  size, generates the scrambles for each cube size<br>
  (which is handy if you aren&#x27;t at your computer), keeps<br>
  an average (rolling or not) - it allows you to option<br>
  to record a pop, you can increae or decrease the<br>
  inspection time.  It is light, pretty durable and<br>
  definatly more effecient than rolling out a stackmat<br>
  (although with the gen2 stackmat you can remove the<br>
  timer piece).<br>
<br>
  It runs on batteries or you can go and purchase the<br>
  correct AC adapter and you can plug it in - it also<br>
  works with the tournament displays (always a plus). <br>
  It eliminates the need to start/stop the timer with<br>
  your hands - the cube does all the work so once you<br>
  lay it down - that&#x27;s it.<br>
<br>
  Plus you can use this while sitting on the couch or in<br>
  a chair, where again the stackmat is a little harder<br>
  to use since the senors and the display are so far<br>
  apart and you generally need a hard surface for the<br>
  stackmat timers to register your hands(something solid<br>
  to push against)<br>
<br>
  There are however a few draw backs as well. I have<br>
  been spoiled by the online timers that have created<br>
  and provided from those in the community.  During the<br>
  inspection time of the official timer if you don&#x27;t put<br>
  it down and pick it back up before the timer runs out<br>
  there is no time.  If you set for 20 secs of<br>
  inspection you have to inspect, set it down, and pick<br>
  it up to solve bfore the 20 secs run out.  Also there<br>
  is no beeping at the final three seconds which is hard<br>
  to adjust to - but doable after a while.<br>
<br>
  If you don&#x27;t set the time just right you can&#x27;t see the<br>
  display.  If you have it on a table you have to look<br>
  directly down at the display it is hard to see at an<br>
  angle and the display doesn&#x27;t pivot (like some<br>
  calculators).  I think if they decide to mass produce<br>
  this item or create more of them this may be a<br>
  function that they may want to include.  How many<br>
  people sit a timer down and look directly down at it<br>
  to see the numbers?  Not many, some of us are lower<br>
  down or see it at an angle.  <br>
<br>
  If you are cubing rather close to the mat you have to<br>
  becareful because the sensor is extremely sensitive<br>
  (which is good and bad).  If you are too close or in a<br>
  shady room the sensor will catch your shadow as<br>
  setting the cube down, the time will stop and you<br>
  won&#x27;t even notice until you actually set the cube down<br>
  and look at the timer.  Of course that only seems to<br>
  happen on the times that you think are pretty good and<br>
  you look at the timer and it says like 7secs.....damn!<br>
  (espeically if you are doing an average - there is no<br>
  way to remove that time)<br>
<br>
  Overall I think it was a rather ingenious design.  It<br>
  has its good and its bad just like some of the other<br>
  timers.  It just all depends on the person using it to<br>
  what they like or don&#x27;t like.  <br>
<br>
  So there is my 2 cents of the official Rubiks timer. <br>
  Any one else purchase one or use one?  If so what are<br>
  your thoughts?<br>
<br>
  :)<br>

Ron for getting his form back.

Btw i have two questions to ask : First to Joel : didnt u make an ad
for some business company where u solve the cube and stuff? Has its
editing completed? Coz i really want to see that ad.

And second to Ron : Do u have the recorded shows of the tv
appereances? I would love to see those too, and just how expensive is
Ton&#x27;s cube? I have a 25$ cube u knw :D

Anyway i really want to meet all u guys at the championships but sadly
im not coming :( Best of luck to all u cubers out there and do ur
best.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Personally i think the 2 seconds penalty is already strict enough, in 
fact i think it&#x27;s too strict. It is however a good idea to distinguish 
between half a turn off and a whole turn from solved. A DNF for 1 turn 
off is far too strict again. And if so, one should at least 
distinguish between &quot;forgetting&quot; the last move or &quot;missing&quot; a move 
because accidentally dropping the cube. I know it will be hard to 
judge the difference between putting the cube down fast and dropping 
it. To risk a DNF because of dropping the cube just doesn&#x27;t sound 
right to me. It will make cubing in competitions less fun. As a whole 
i don&#x27;t see the point in overly strict rules except if someone by some 
means is trying to cheat. I guess normal solving is not very prone to 
cheating, but for blindfold or one-handed i see that cheating will be 
possible.

Just my thoughts :-)

I actually think I had better stopped the timer immediately, because 
it may have taken more time than the 2 seconds penalty to see and 
correct it. Maybe the penalty should be higher????? In the future 
(2007?) we may even see that a full move off is a DNF (half move off 
is 2 seconds).

OK, here is the other video.
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/media/DeWereldDraaitDoor_Rubik.wmv

Watch Ton touch the light blue box and then the 1978 cube. Ton says &quot;this is an original cube from 1978&quot;. The host says &quot;noone can see that&quot;. :-)

Chris Hunt, will you host this video? Speedcubing.com is always close to the limit of GB&#x27;s data transfer per month.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Negative Time Tommy&#x27;s Run, Time = -6 minutes 10 seconds<br>
<br>
It was a success for the Caltech Rubik&#x27;s Cube Team attempting the <br>
Negative Time Tommy&#x27;s Run.  We started off in the courtyard of the <br>
Blacker House modular housing and left at precisely 1:33.00 AM.  Leyan <br>
took a 5 second head start and I tried to catch up.  It ended up <br>
working perfectly as he got to the door of the parking garage in time <br>
to open it for me so that I could start the car.<br>
<br>
I drove the car out of the garage and Daniel Lo, Shelley Chang, and <br>
Mark Polinkovsky jumped in.  Mark was unfortunately sitting in the <br>
middle seat and since he&#x27;s 6-feet tall, I got a good view of his head <br>
in the rearview mirror.<br>
<br>
I made a mistake in the very beginning.  It would be far too easy for <br>
Techers to go to &quot;Near Tommy&#x27;s&quot; so we go to the original &quot;Far Tommy&#x27;s&quot;. <br>
  I turned north onto Hill in the direction of I-210 and no one else in <br>
the car was saying anything.  I then realized that to get to &quot;Far <br>
Tommy&#x27;s,&quot; I had to go on I-110 to US-101 so I turned the car around.<br>
<br>
The drive to Tommy&#x27;s was somewhat tough because of traffic.  I-110 in <br>
Pasadena is a treacherous highway.  It&#x27;s very old and the lanes are <br>
narrow and there are a lot of curves with warning signs that recommend <br>
speeds of 35 miles per hour.<br>
<br>
The direction as stated on donut.caltech.edu are quite brilliant.  Take <br>
110-South, go to 101-North, and exit Rampart Blvd.  Make a left at <br>
every stoplight and a right at every stop sign.  It works!  We got to <br>
Tommy&#x27;s, but there wasn&#x27;t parking so I stopped the car and Daniel Lo <br>
got out and got in line for the food.  Then we found a place to park <br>
the car.  It was on a little side street—quite nerve wracking trying to <br>
parallel park under pressure.<br>
<br>
We got out of the car and ran to Tommy&#x27;s which was about a block and a <br>
half away.  It was somewhat painful for me because I had done a running <br>
workout earlier in the day.  Daniel Lo waited in line for us while <br>
Leyan, Shelley, and I prepared to do negative-time blindfold solves at <br>
Tommy&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
At 1:58.30 AM, we started solving.  I managed to successfully solve the <br>
cube blindfolded in 2 minutes 27.08 seconds which equates to -57 <br>
minutes 32.92 seconds.  Daniel Lo and Mark Polinkovsky got our food.  <br>
There were cheese fries, a hamburger for Mark, and a hot dog for me.<br>
<br>
I hadn&#x27;t actually eaten on the Negative Time Tommy&#x27;s run before so it <br>
was particularly difficult.  The hot dog I got wasn&#x27;t too big, but it <br>
came with a gigantic portion of chili and cheese.  I ate the entire <br>
thing in about 5 minutes and started feeling slightly sick.  It had <br>
taken us 21 minutes to drive to Tommy&#x27;s so we definitely had to leave <br>
by 1:12 AM.  Mark finished his hamburger and went to go wash his hands <br>
but we pulled him back because there wasn&#x27;t enough time.<br>
<br>
The drive back was relatively quick.  Traffic to Pasadena on I-110 is <br>
very light.  I parked the car on the side of the street and we ran back <br>
into Blacker Courtyard where my watch read 1:26.50 AM for a Negative <br>
Time Tommy&#x27;s Run of -6 minutes and 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done in the tradition of the Caltech Negative Time <br>
Tommy&#x27;s run.  We&#x27;re all back and safe... Mark&#x27;s having his appointment <br>
with the bathroom from that hamburger.  The difficulty in the Negative <br>
Time Tommy&#x27;s run is the eating.  With sane driving, you have about 25 <br>
minutes to eat.  However, lots of Caltech students are there so the <br>
lines are long which give you maybe 7 to 10 minutes to eat this thing <br>
with a whole ton of chili.  Anyway, hopefully I&#x27;m graduating... but if <br>
you&#x27;re in the Pasadena area, it&#x27;s something to try.<br>

I can perfectly understand Ton... recently in Eindhoven we shortly 
talked about these (about those oldest cubes, not necessarily this 
specific box). Might not be the most shiny or fast or signed, but the 
oldest and thus most original. And while you can always make more 
expensive or larger or smaller or whatever cubes, you can not make 
older cubes, so this is a very special feature. And don&#x27;t 
underestimate the value, I think it&#x27;s worth a lot!

Here Ton describes a 1979 version (I don&#x27;t think he describes his 1978 
one) which describes the features of those cubes:
http://tinyurl.com/9wt65

I didn&#x27;t really understand anything in the video except names, but... 
did the guy say at the start that he peels the stickers off?

Cheers!
Stefan

Reminds me again of a short thread we had a while ago, I think about 
Dijkstra saying there are really only three important numbers: 0, 1 
and infinity.


Looking for special cube features I can see this analogy:

0) You&#x27;re not interested in them.

1) You&#x27;re looking for the oldest, i.e. most original cubes (a feature 
you can&#x27;t just increase like you want)

infinity) You&#x27;re looking for the fastest, largest, smallest, 
brightest, most expensive, heaviest, etc, etc, etc (features you can 
easily increase if you just want to)


Btw, about user names (for chatting etc):
0) You don&#x27;t have one.
1) You use your real name.
infinity) You choose from the infinity of possible fake names :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Btw i have two questions to ask : First to Joel : didnt u make an <br>
ad<br>
&gt; for some business company where u solve the cube and stuff? Has its<br>
&gt; editing completed? Coz i really want to see that ad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeah... They also took their time for sending me my payment, but <br>
ultimately, they did it. I gave them a phone call last thursday to <br>
remind them of their promise to send me a DVD of it. They said it&#x27;s <br>
all going to be ok, but it takes a long time.. Once I have it, I <br>
will upload it to my site as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
More about the competition, and (first) the TV appearance:<br>
<br>
Yes Ron, I had the same thing. I was talking to a lot of spectators <br>
who were watching the cubers practice... And indeed, on guy said: &quot;I <br>
saw a guy on television yesterday who could do it 34 seconds, with <br>
one hand!!&quot; :). And yes, I also had to laugh about the comment on <br>
the cube from 1978 :).<br>
<br>
And about the competition: The circumstances where just great <br>
yesterday. The ambiance with really good, and the crowed was <br>
changing all the time (people passing by just stopped to watch for a <br>
little while), so even if I did very very bad time, people were <br>
still amazed :). It was fun to anwser all the same standard <br>
questions to all those people... And I also explained them a couple <br>
of ideas (I hope some they understand it :)). I always like to show <br>
a nice commutator to people, because those are the kind of moves <br>
that I can logically understand :).<br>
<br>
And Ron, nice capture of the TV appearances.. I&#x27;d like to put mine <br>
on my website.. Would you mind?<br>
<br>
See you soon,<br>

Why not put a foam rubber carpet on the front part of the stackmat (as in pole-jumping). That would reduce the risk of a DNF when dropping the cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I also had a similar idea about 1 1/2 yr ago before Amsterdam. But 
my reason then was simply to protect the cube/puzzle from breaking 
when putting it down fast :-) A soft mat of some sort might solve 
both problems actually :-)

I also suggested some kinda ring for the clock to prevent messing w 
the buttons. But i guess it&#x27;s not really a big deal. Hasn&#x27;t been a 
problem so far.

Cheers!

The copyright sign didn&#x27;t get &#x27;linked&#x27; in the message.  What you can do 
is create a text file on your local drive with the following text:

&lt;html>&lt;body><a href=

COOL MOVIE</a>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>

and save it as movie.htm.  Then open it, right-click and save.

Wish I had done the midnight run/cube.  I woke up an hour too early 
today.

I also suggested something similar (in email conversation with a WCA 
member), the result was a new rule:

&quot;The timer is placed directly (no objects underneath it) on a table, 
desk or console&quot;

The list of changes mentions this as:

&quot;No objects under the timer to improve picking up the puzzle.&quot;

I had suggested putting a towel under the stackmat because I noticed I 
can pick up the magic better with a soft surface (like my bed) under 
the stackmat. And because it would dampen the force of a puzzle 
falling on the mat.

But I knew it&#x27;s something that would make regulations more complicated 
so I didn&#x27;t really expect it to be allowed.

For the clock, nothing special is needed. Just don&#x27;t lay it down flat, 
instead let it stand. That&#x27;s also in the rules now.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Ah ok ...

So the clock has to remain standing after the inspection and before 
the solve. But i assume one can still lay it down flat after a 
solve. To put it standing after a solve is wasting time ... ;-) The 
buttons won&#x27;t matter here. It is still solved as long as the clocks 
all point to 12 :D

Cheers!

solver in Finland. Here in Finland Johannes Laire is only cuber I know <br>
who has started cubing this year. I have some times brought cube to <br>
school, but only one of my classmates has learned how to solve it, and <br>
he isn&#x27;t very interested. I know about five Finns who are able to do <br>
cube in about 30 seconds, but they are too lazy/busy/old to go sub-20.<br>
I&#x27;m not going to stop cubing but seeing other cubers four times a year <br>
is much too less. Maybe I should move to Netherlands...<br>

Xine did that same but told me I need the avc1 codec.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gunnar,

Yes, it was a lucky case: OLL skip. They didn&#x27;t film this 10.15 completely, but it was done while Ton and I were scrambling each other&#x27;s cubes.

It was funny, they were almost finished but wanted a full solve that was perfect. So I used a scramble that I know by heart. Both times that I tried it, I got stuck halfway through the solve, setting times over 14 seconds. 
Then Ton and I competed each other a few more times. The first time I made a huge mistake (time over 20) and Ton set a 16 second time. The second time it was the other way around. I told them NOT to use the first time. :-) They actually did use the first time, but they did not use the end of the solve. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

  Of course it&#x27;s not lucky.. You see, Ron is a cubing God :).
