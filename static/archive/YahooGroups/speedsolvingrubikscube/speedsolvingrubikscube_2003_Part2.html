        I find that cubes that I find at a store in my town tend to suck, while
        cubes I hear about people buying in their town work amazingly. My
        solution is to buy one over the net. Try Rubiks.com, or if you're
        willing to spend a few extra bucks for a great one, buy a studio cube at
        Ton's site: speedcubing.com/ton --- In

        Hey Ramon: I have had experience with these myself. 'Stretching the
        springs is not even necessary. I have gone through about 5 of these when
        I was just practicing as a beginner (poured hours in them). It's REALLY
        terrible when you first buy them (well, most of them are, but some can
        be considerably well), but if they're just for practice and no speed
        then they're okay. If you load some vaseline in one and wear it down for
        about a week, then i find mine okay (i have one with vaseline i can get
        under 30 secs easy). They do break very easily, and yes, they are cheap,
        but they're not that bad:) Brent razordu30 &lt;razordu30@...&gt; wrote:

        I use those az interior cubes in my designs. I do this for economy. They
        ARE cheap. But as design cubes? Forget it. I much prefer the colors on
        ordinary cubes. You will see that in Toronto. I am not rich and cannot
        afford not to practise economy. I acquired those cubes over the years. I
        would like more, to construct Landry Staircase made of 125 blcks with 8
        cubes/block requires 1000 cubes. For a third iteration Menger Sponge I
        would need 729 cubes. Etc, etc.... I would not be expected to keep those
        cubes, but return them with a design twiddled on them. :-) Hana a kostky

        If the anything that drives me crazy it's a bad cube. I just solved a
        couple of new rubik's cubes for my friend. Turning the thing almost
        drove me mad! and my hand hurt after I was done. My old cube (which I
        have gotten quite attacehd to) is just about dead and pops every couple
        of solves so it's time to get another cube. I was wondering what kind of
        cube you people use and what you would recommend. Is it worth spending a
        lot of money on an old Hungarian cube from Ebay or will a new oddzon
        cube work well with a little work? How about a studio cube? Any opinions
        would be appreciated. --the constanty barefoot ¬©H¬Æ√è¬ß

        I can personally vouch for the "magic cube" with the glittery stickers.
        This was my origional cube. I poured tons of vasoline on it. And dropped
        my time down from about 2:30 seconds to 1:45 seconds. I used it for the
        next couple of weeks and you will come to realize that it will get
        vveerrry loose. You're subconcious is constantly adjusting to the
        ammount of preassure applied for a quarter turn. The only real problem
        that I noticed was that it locked up bad... a lot. But if you could
        learn to adjust and know exactly when to turn it, it turns very fast. I
        was able to get a face about 7/8 of the way around by just using a quick
        flick of the finger. My fastest time on that cube, which is still my
        current record was 45 seconds. I'm in the long process of learning the
        F2L, orientations, and premutations so that record has been a month or
        so ago. Anyway just a few days ago I came to senses that it is... in
        fact, a cheap cube. While applying a trigger (R U') the cube locked,
        flew out of my hand and gracefully smashed into the floor. One of the
        centers broke off and rendered the cube useless. I still haven't bought
        a nice cube but I could safely say that it is a good beginer to
        intermediate cube. It's very good to teach you to align correctly. It's
        not the worst cube and you should by no means discard it. Hope this long
        winded explination helps :-) -Dylan

        The new cubes from Rubik.com are made of pretty smooth plastic, but have
        no adjusting screws. They come pretty tight and speed up when lubed. The
        white plastic versions offered occasionally on ebay, with vinyl stickers
        are set up a tad looser and feel pretty good. I find them tiring to work
        as I am pretty spoiled. Except for the Rubik's Studio Cubes I don't know
        of any that are made today with the adjustable screws. I've heard horror
        stories about the stickers on *all* new cubes. You can order Studio
        cubes at Ton's site. He likes them fine. I use the 20 year old Deluxe
        cubes, which come with plastic tiles, both the regular and the Rubiks
        Game versions which has little peg holes. They are adjustable and made
        of harder plastic than other cubes. They're a little heavier, too so
        they're not for everyone. I use Armorall and 3M silicone lube (the non
        oil-based kind) and the cubes are very fast, rarely lock up and almost
        never pop. The older cubes (authentic Rubik's not counterfeits) which
        have the adjustable screws were made in Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
        Hungary, and I think, England. People have made speed cubes out of all
        of these. It comes down to a matter of taste I think. There are good
        older cubes on ebay, but don't pay through the nose. Look at what
        they've gone for during the last few months, and bid judiciously. There
        were *hundreds of millions* of cubes made, so there are still lots of
        good unopened Ideal cubes out there. Be patient and you might get one
        for a good price. David J

        Alright, I've gotten to frusterated to figure this out on my own.
        Sometime last week my 5x5x5, which I really was afraid of breaking for
        fear of the inside mechanics... did in fact break. Luckily there were no
        little joints as in the 2x2 or balls like the 4x4. It was pretty
        straight forward (altough my mom swears that I need to be an engineer
        now). The problem was after I got it put back together it shattered
        again, just a few solves later. Now you people that have like 2:30
        averages. I know you don't go out and buy another 5x5 cube everytime one
        gets loose. Is there anything I can do to keep my cube from splitting
        into a zillion pieces? I can't locate the "weak spot" if that was it is,
        although I think I can attribute it to the "center- corners" if you know
        what I'm talking about. The only other information that I can see is
        that as I'm doing (Rr) a 2x2x5 chunk explodes out of nowhere (with the 5
        being 5 deep). Hope you can help. --Dylan

        I had one that did this right out of the box. No solution to it yet. But
        when it's all apart, you might try twisting just the center tiles a

        now). The problem was after I got it put back together it shattered
        again, just a few solves later. Now you people that have like 2:30
        averages. I know you don't go out and buy another 5x5 cube everytime one
        gets loose. Is there anything I can do to keep my cube from splitting
        into a zillion pieces? I can't locate the "weak spot" if that was it is,
        although I think I can attribute it to the "center- corners" if you know
        what I'm talking about. The only other information that I can see is
        that as I'm doing (Rr) a 2x2x5 chunk explodes out of nowhere (with the 5
        being 5 deep). Hope you can help. --Dylan Yahoo! Groups Sponsor To

        I prefer the older cubes as well, but i wore outmy old on so i went out
        and got a bunch of rubiks.com/hessport cubes and after months of turning
        and lubing, it is an awesome cube. The adjustable centers would be nice,
        so i will hopefully be getting a studio cube as well. One cheep knock of
        brand that was fairly decent for me at least were the WONDERFUL PUZZLER
        in the black boxes, the ones in the blue boxes really suck, I mean
        REALLY suck, probably the worst cubes ever made, unless i got some
        factory rejects or somethin :) Jake --- In

        I've heard horror stories about &gt; the stickers on *all* new cubes.
        &gt; &gt; You can order Studio cubes at Ton's site. He likes them fine.
        &gt; &gt; I use the 20 year old Deluxe cubes, which come with plastic
        tiles, &gt; both the regular and the Rubiks Game versions which has
        little peg &gt; holes. They are adjustable and made of harder plastic
        than other &gt; cubes. They're a little heavier, too so they're not for
        everyone. I &gt; use Armorall and 3M silicone lube (the non oil-based
        kind) and the &gt; cubes are very fast, rarely lock up and almost never
        pop. &gt; &gt; The older cubes (authentic Rubik's not counterfeits)
        which have the &gt; adjustable screws were made in Korea, Hong Kong,
        Taiwan, Hungary, and &gt; I think, England. People have made speed cubes
        out of all of these. &gt; &gt; It comes down to a matter of taste I
        think. There are good older &gt; cubes on ebay, but don't pay through
        the nose. Look at what they've &gt; gone for during the last few months,
        and bid judiciously. There were &gt; *hundreds of millions* of cubes
        made, so there are still lots of good &gt; unopened Ideal cubes out
        there. Be patient and you might get one for a &gt; good price. &gt; &gt;

        Ok, so i ran the gauntlet today since I finally got my pocket cube and
        my bart-head in the mail... Still waiting on my Pyraminx and Megaminx,
        but this was just a test run anyway :) I know I'm not the fastest
        puzzler around, far from it, but I'm proud of my time, I solved (in this
        order): Bart's head 2x2x2 Homer's Head 2x2x2 15 puzzle 5x5x5 4x4x4 3x3x3
        3x3x3 3x3x3 miniature 3x3x3 Texture cube, without looking 2x2x2 square-1
        that's 11 puzzles in a row with no breaks in between (save when my
        screen saver came on while solving the texture cube and I had to type in
        my password, timer kept running though). All eleven in a row took
        21:39.30 Just under 2 minutes per puzzle on average. Not bad for a first
        try I think. I know some others could do better thouhg. But I got to
        thinking, what about having a Magic-Cub-a-thon section on
        www.speedcubing.com in which one would have to solve: 5x5x5 4x4x4 3x3x3
        2x2x2 In whatever order they wish, all in a row? that might be a fun
        challenge. Any thoughts? I LOVE my pocket cube btw :) Daniel [Non-text

        many puzzles fast as solving one puzzle really fast. Just out of

        Well I got it just 2 or 3 days ago in the mail, and the only
        modification I've made is to spritz some silicon lubricant into it. It
        turns super smooth, but I do get "stuffed" occaisionally. I do have a
        bit of fear about it popping apart from all the horror stories I've
        heard, but it seems solid enough to not give too much thought too just
        yet. I got it from hesseports rubiks shop btw. My records with the 2x2
        so far are: Best non-lucky time, 7.83 Best average 14.53. I love it
        because it requires no thought :) Also, I tried the 2-3-4-5 challenge
        and got about 9:54, so I'm going to try to kick it up a notch first
        before I submit my time. Daniel ----- Original Message ----- From:

        Hi everyone. Just recently I've gotten back to the 4 dimentional cube
        trying to solve it again. Summer is just right around the corner and I
        was wondering if anyone, that seems to be at the stage I am at with
        solving it, wanted to exchange a few e-mails just to combine heads and
        try to maybe share credit of the 20th someodd people to solve it (if in
        fact we do). I would like it if you had at least looked at the puzzle
        and given it some thought. Again I don't want someone who has already
        solved it. If you are interested please e-mail me at eagles10101@...
        thank you and have a great day!

        I spent about 2 weeks thinking about the forth dimension. It kept my
        mind busy for that whole time (Chris Hardwick started it for me... he
        wanted to derive the formula for the volume of a 4D hypersphere). In
        that time, without outside help, I derived formulas to describe any
        dimension, how a 4D cube would look and why we could not keep a 4D
        person in jail in the 3D world. I did a lot of cool stuff. I even looked
        at the 4D cube puzzle. It much conforms to what I discovered, however
        that does not mean I know how to solve it! I cannot figure out how the
        move the pieces the way I want right now. If I learned how to use that
        program, I might try solving it! Like, I tell the program to scramble it
        with 2 moves... I can see how to solve it.. I just do not know how to
        move the cubical faces (yes.. the faces on a 4D cube are in fact 3D

        The two places that I know of that you can try a 4D cube are
        superliminal.com and hadron.org will navigate you to one.
        Superliminal.com is a downloadable version that I think you can save
        positions and come back to it but I'm not sure. I use hadron.org which
        is just an applet. I'm pretty sure it's hadron.org athough you might
        want to try hadron.org/~hatch if that dosen't work. Still looking for
        someone with some ideas, thanks. P.S. I would like to know how that 4D

        Hi Guys, Gals, this is for some who are having trouble finding cubes. I
        know it's different in different places, but where I live there are
        cubes available in large drug stores (toy section) kid's educational
        stores, as well as the regular Toy stores and Game stores. DJ

        I know you guys will get it, probably pretty quickly. When I tried it
        last October (I think), it only took a week of fiddling to get it
        solved. My second try, I did it in four hours straight. And I know that
        many of the puzzlers here are smarter than I. Fourth dimensional theory
        has held a great fascination for me for quite some time... I don't
        exactly clame to be an expert, just a little more knowledgable than
        someone who has never thought about it before :). A few very good books
        on the subject: Hyperspace, by Michio Kaku Surfing through hyperspace,
        by Clifford A Pickover (the book I deam responsible for my obsession
        with the rubik's cube, oddly enough) Flatland, by Edwin Abbot Abbot The
        Boy Who Reversed Himself, By William Sleator (the book responsible for
        my obsession with the 4th dimension). The last two are story books, the
        last one of which is actually a children's story book I read in 4th
        grade. Ever since then I've read all things I could get my hands on
        about the fourth dimension. Since then I've driven geometry and calculus
        teachers crazy in high school and vector calculus teachers to drink in
        college :-D. At any rate, to answer the 4-D person in a 3-d jail thing:
        As is always the case when visualizing 4-d problems, take it down one
        dimension. Draw a circle on a piece of paper, then draw a stick figure
        inside that circle. You have a 2-d person in a 2-d jail. As long as that
        stick figure is bound to the 2 dimensions of the paper (north-south,
        east-west), it cannot pass through the "jail" created by the circle. Now
        place a physical small object inside the drawn circle. If this physical
        small object (I'll use a pocket cube ;) ) is confined to the
        2-dimensions of the paper, it also cannot pass throught the "jail."
        However, since it is a three dimensional object, it is possible to lift
        it up into the third dimension, off the paper, move it over, and place
        it down again on the other side of the "jail" wall. Simple enough,
        right? Well if we do the same thing with a 3d object in a 3d jail and a
        4-d object in a 3-d jail, the same thing happens. the 3-d object is
        bound to the 3 dimensions of our world: up-down, north-south, east-west.
        The four dimensional object can however move in another direction "over"
        the 3-d jail wall, and re-enter the 3-d plane of existence on the other
        side of the cell. My personal favorite description of this extra degree
        of freedom is "ana-kata" which I first heard in _The Boy Who Reversed
        Himself_, though the terms were coined some time before that book was
        written. That is not to say a 2-d object couldn't escape a 2-d jail in
        the same manner if it could figure out a way to move in a 3-d direction,
        exactly as a 3-d object could escape a 3-d jail if it could figure out
        how to move in a 4-d direction. It may also help to remember that a
        direction that defines an n+1 dimensional space is the direction that is
        orthoganol (perpendicular) to all directions in n-space. In 1-D space (a
        line) a line orthoganol to that line will create 2-d Space. In 2-D
        space, a line orhtoganol to 2 already orthoganol lines in 2-d space,
        will define 3-d space. So in 3-d Space if you have 3 perpendicular lines
        (like the corner of a rubik's cube) a line that is orhtoganol to all
        three of those lines simultaneously, will create 4-d space. If you
        figure out how to point to this line, please show me. Hope that helps!
        And good luck on the 4-D Cube!!! You can do it! Daniel Hayes &gt;From:

        &gt;The two places that I know of that you can try a 4D cube are
        &gt;superliminal.com and hadron.org will navigate you to one.
        &gt;Superliminal.com is a downloadable version that I think you can save

        &gt;which is just an applet. I'm pretty sure it's hadron.org athough you

        So in 3-d Space if &gt;you have 3 perpendicular lines (like the corner

        i know this is a REALLY late reply, but i just had to do it. i've beaten
        the game before, and it only took 4-5 hours to complete. you just have

        guys chemical plants in foreign cities and then after that he shows up
        and theres a map of the world and some cities flagged where youve

        There are all sorts of different color orientations. Usually the
        uncommon ones like you described are just made cheaply from some place.
        The real ones, of course, are yellow-white/blue-green/ornage- red. A
        friend of mine has a cube that has purple and pink, and all the other
        normal colors are really neon-y. It's a pretty good speedcube, too. ---

        The color scheme you describe is the original Rubik's color scheme. With
        all due respect to Mr.Rubik, I prefer the scheme with highest contrast.
        The problem with Rubik's scheme is that it has two opposite light colors
        (white/yrllow) and two opposite dark colors (green/blue). Such
        colorcombination photograph rather poorly, particularly with a lousy
        camera used by a lousy photograoher (me :- ) ). Hana a kistky --- In

        Hey, Brent, Dan Gosbee and I never discussed the possibility oif my
        designs being included in the Guinness's Book of World Records. That is
        up to Guinness, not Dan. What I did learn is that evidently no one
        except myself is exhibiting in the cube art category. After an extensive
        search I am unable to find anyone on the web who does what I do. I was
        hoping to find some 3d designers in Toronto, but it looks as if no one
        comes forward even here. :-(( I did write to one of the 2d designers,
        but he declined coming to Toronto. The website to look at for pictures
        of my designs is http://cube.misto.cz . It is an English-Czech site. My
        nationality is Czech, same as Jessica Fridrich's. :-) You can find this
        site among the links to speedcubing.com .I have no site devoted
        specifically to the patterns, but you can find that n Chapter 4 of my
        book. I have no "physics of the Rubik's cube" site. All I can say is
        that luricating the cube is good for speedcubing, but make sure it
        doesn't get too loose so it falls apart.In Toronto, that could do you

        the cubes made by Ideal for the US and Britain were Red/Orange -

        I havent tried the mefferts solution before, but from what it sounds is

        Ok here's something new to do, and even these posts are getting a little
        old, it'll still help to relive a little summer boredom for all of you
        who still go to school. Anyway here you go: using the "A" premutation
        compleatly scramble the cube. Try to fully scramble the 8 corners so
        that no stickers are facing toward their side. To put it more simpily,
        the corner pieces can't be the same color as the edge pieces on all 6
        sides (and those corners do not need to be the same color). I'm pretty
        sure it can be done using a corners first method or something similar...
        that's why I'm saying do it using the "A"pre- mutation :-) reamember the
        corners do not need to be in any kind of order. Have a great

        EXCELLENT!! S. &gt; &gt;yay! I'm ways stoked! I just got my first sub-20
        second solve. 18.95 &gt;seconds. Unfortunately it was a tad lucky, I got
        to skip a 6 move step in &gt;my last layer solution (still using a
        4-look method until I finish learning &gt;the new algs). other than that
        though, it was a normal solve :). Still &gt;haven't broken the 30 second
        average though. Although on this particular &gt;set with my new personal
        best, I averaged 30.99 seconds. &gt; &gt;My times are all over the place
        Several mid 20's and a few low 30's then 2 &gt;or 3 mid 30's. Weird
        stuff. &gt; &gt;Anyway, i'm happy. Yay! &gt; &gt;[Non-text portions of

      <strong> 2056. Megaminx Pyraminx, Mefferts :( </strong>

      <br />
      <div class="email-content">
        Hey all, my Megaminx and Pyraminx came in today, I was way excited.
        Ordered them both from mefferts, despite my previous experience with
        less-than-wonderful service. The first time I ordered from them, it was
        a 5x5x5, a 4x4x4 and a square-1. The 5x5x5 that showed up was the wrong
        color scheme, so after a little prodding I got them to send a
        replacement. The replacement showed up and it was the right color
        scheme, but it would fall apart after about 10 twists. So I kept the one
        with the incorrect color scheme (which functions very well) and retiled
        it myself. Sent the other one back to him after I reassembled it. So I
        was a bit timid. But today when I got my megaminx (which is considerably
        smaller than I expected), 3 of the stickers had fallen off. This was
        kind of ok since I wanted to redo it to a 12 color version, the one I
        got was only 6. But the kicker was that one of the edge pieces was
        actually glued to one of the center pieces. This made any turn that
        tried to separate those two pieces completely impossible, which turned
        out to be more annoying than you might expect. So I eventually got them
        separated using a very sharp pocket knife. But I don't feel that that is
        something the end user should have to do. As for the Pyraminx, I'm going
        to need some help. I solved it once after my girlfriend scrambled it for
        me, took a bit, but I got the hang of it after maybe 5 or so minutes.
        Then she was scrambling it again and it burst to pieces. 3 of the
        pyramid points are still firmly connected to the central ball. On of the
        points has however, come off. This in turn made the center piece of the
        second layer fall off by nature of construction, which made 3 of the
        edge pieces fall off. So if the pyraminx is supposed to look like this:
        /\ /\/\ /\/\/\ It looks like this: /\/\/\ with various other pieces
        laying about. Now I have figured out how it's supposed to go together,
        the problem is, getting it back together. The construction is a ball
        with 4 screw holes in in. Each of the 4 peak pieces has a screw coming
        out the bottom with the screw head imbedded in the peak puzzle piece.
        the screw threads goe through the "middle" piece (of which there are 3
        on each side if that makes sense), and screws into the central ball. The
        problem is this: The Peak piece, which houses the screw head, turns
        independantly of the screw itself. So there is no way to assemble the
        puzzle, 100% and screw the screw back in. The way I see it, I have 3
        options. I can, drill a hole in the top of the peak piece, and try to
        tighten the screw while the puzzle is assembled with a screw driver
        through the hole (assuming this is a normal screw with a phillips or
        slot head, which is not certain). I can try to pry off the bottom part
        of the peak, screw the puzzle back together, and glue the peak back onto
        its base (this is very similar to the way I assume the puzzle was first
        assembled). Or I can simply drop some glue on the screw shaft, making it
        stick to the peak piece and use the puzzle piece itself as a screw head.
        The problem with this is that it will make two pieces of the puzzle
        glued together. Granted those two pieces are the peak piece and the only
        other piece it touches, so it's not exactly a challenging part of the
        puzzle that I lose, but still, then it's not a 100% functioning puzzle.
        If anyone has any ideas on how to reassemble a pyraminx, please please
        please let me know. I can take pictures on sunday, maybe sooner, if
        anyone needs to see exactly what I'm talking about. Thanks. So in
        conclusion, because of my personal experience, and my personal oppinions
        on those experiences, it will be a long time before I order anything, or
        reccomend anyone else to order anything from www.mefferts.com. Just my
        oppinion. Btw, it took about an hour, but I did end up solving the
        megaminx, with no help from anyone :-D. Daniel

        Well, I found that they are eager to help. However, from my experience,
        they have made several mistakes. The most irritating is that most of the
        time they take 4 weeks to deliver. When, ever I specify things like: do
        not attach the tiles, they don't comply. My Revenge broke the first
        month I got it (two of the centers snaped off). My Megaminx was ok after
        a couple hours of sanding, But during normal use edge tiles kept falling
        off. Eventually after most of them, and some corner ones, fell off and
        got reglued. I rarely ever touch the two tiled 3x3's I got from them,
        because they have no springs, and after heavy use some of the little
        pink chunks came off inside the centers. The center caps themself fall
        off constantly until I glued them in. Also those holes are kinda
        unsightly. -Doug, waiting eagerly for my Studio Cube to come in the mail

        I must admit, they were pretty quick. It got here in 11 days, which is

        here you go: using the "A" premutation compleatly scramble &gt; &gt; the

        the "A" permutation? Explain in terms of which pieces are &gt; swapped
        (e.g. FR&lt;-&gt; FL, etc). &gt; &gt; 2) Is the point of this challenge

        Thanks, &gt; &gt; Grant ------------------------------------- Sorry, I
        knew I was going to have trouble explaining it. Ok first of all the "A"
        premutation is described on Jessica's site but this is the algorythem (L
        F' L B2 L' F L B2 L2). This should shuffle the BUL- FUL and the BUR
        pieces. The second question is yes. You do not need to solve the cube
        again just try to have no corner sticker corresponding with an edge
        sticker (edge stickers should be the same on each face). After you're
        done with that it might also be fun to solve it the same way :-). Hope
        this helps

        OK, here is a new discipline. Someone scrambles the cube for you and is
        allowed to remove pieces, too. Your task is to tell as fast as you can
        if the cube is solvable and if it is not, what is it that happened
        (i.e., one twisted corner, flipped edge, or swapped two cubies, or
        combinations of those). You can average 10 attempts, as with regular
        cube solving, and calculate average. If you guess wrong, it will be
        treated as a "pop" in calculating the average. What would be your
        strategy? What do you think is the fastest possible average for this?
        Jessica P.S.: On another thought, this would be really boring because
        you need to either have someone to mix the cube for you or disassemble
        it yourself and then assemble it randomly ... so you need some junk cube
        for this. But still, I am quite curious, for example, if there is a
        faster strategy than solving, say the F2L, and then telling, or simply
        quickly calculating some invariants right from the colved cube, ... any
        ideas?

        is it illegal to paint a thin stripe on the edge of each face using the
        color of the adjacent face? for example, take the red/white edge cubie.
        on the red face you paint a thin white stripe along the edge to indicate
        that the other face is white, and on the white face you paint a thin red
        stripe along the edge to indicate the other face is red. you could do
        the same for corners (there would be 2 colored thin stripes along the
        edges on each of the 3 corner faces. i assume this is cheating. does it

      <div class="email-content">
        I recently got a pyraminx and a megaminx from Mefferts, but the pyraminx
        fell apart after a single solve. I'm looking for ideas on how to
        reassemble it, as I don't want to wait for a replacement, due to past
        experience with mefferts (just my humble oppinion/preference). So here's
        an exerpt from my other thread, in case anyone who might be able to help
        me missed it: I solved it once after my girlfriend scrambled it for me,
        took a bit, but I got the hang of it after maybe 5 or so minutes. Then
        she was scrambling it again and it burst to pieces. 3 of the pyramid
        points are still firmly connected to the central ball. On of the points
        has however, come off. This in turn made the center piece of the second
        layer fall off by nature of construction, which made 3 of the edge
        pieces fall off. So if the pyraminx is supposed to look like this: /\
        /\/\ /\/\/\ It looks like this: /\/\/\ with various other pieces laying
        about. Now I have figured out how it's supposed to go together, the
        problem is, getting it back together. The construction is a ball with 4
        screw holes in in. Each of the 4 peak pieces has a screw coming out the
        bottom with the screw head imbedded in the peak puzzle piece. the screw
        threads goe through the "middle" piece (of which there are 3 on each
        side if that makes sense), and screws into the central ball. The problem
        is this: The Peak piece, which houses the screw head, turns
        independantly of the screw itself. So there is no way to assemble the
        puzzle, 100% and screw the screw back in. The way I see it, I have 3
        options. I can, drill a hole in the top of the peak piece, and try to
        tighten the screw while the puzzle is assembled with a screw driver
        through the hole (assuming this is a normal screw with a phillips or
        slot head, which is not certain). I can try to pry off the bottom part
        of the peak, screw the puzzle back together, and glue the peak back onto
        its base (this is very similar to the way I assume the puzzle was first
        assembled). Or I can simply drop some glue on the screw shaft, making it
        stick to the peak piece and use the puzzle piece itself as a screw head.
        The problem with this is that it will make two pieces of the puzzle
        glued together. Granted those two pieces are the peak piece and the only
        other piece it touches, so it's not exactly a challenging part of the
        puzzle that I lose, but still, then it's not a 100% functioning puzzle.
        Thanks for any help! BTW, I officially have formulated a solution to the
        megaminx. I've solved it about 5 times with no problems. And it is now a
        12 color version :). Gotta go time myself now!

        Hi Jessica, Good question. I tried it, and I could only quickly tell if
        a corner had been twisted or an edge flipped. In trying to determine
        whether two corners/two edges had been swapped I ran into a problem
        regarding the edges - "one in/three out" on the LL can look like "two
        in/two out" with a quarter turn. I had to sort the LL corners, so even
        getting the F2L solved didn't help. I would guess that most would find
        the quickest way would be to solve the cube. You can try it after a pop
        where you didn't note where the popped pieces had been and/or were
        facing. Or you could do it after cleaning and lubing your cube, just put
        it back together unsolved. Thanks, David J --- In

        Someone scrambles the cube for you and is allowed to remove pieces, &gt;
        too. Your task is to tell as fast as you can if the cube is solvable
        &gt; and if it is not, what is it that happened (i.e., one twisted
        corner, &gt; flipped edge, or swapped two cubies, or combinations of
        those). You &gt; can average 10 attempts, as with regular cube solving,
        and calculate &gt; average. If you guess wrong, it will be treated as a
        "pop" in &gt; calculating the average. &gt; &gt; What would be your
        strategy? What do you think is the fastest &gt; possible average for
        this? &gt; &gt; Jessica &gt; &gt; P.S.: On another thought, this would
        be really boring because you &gt; need to either have someone to mix the
        cube for you or disassemble it &gt; yourself and then assemble it
        randomly ... so you need some junk cube &gt; for this. But still, I am
        quite curious, for example, if there is a &gt; faster strategy than
        solving, say the F2L, and then telling, or &gt; simply quickly
        calculating some invariants right from the colved &gt; cube, ... any
        ideas?

        Like i replied before, you should probably try and pry the cap off so
        you can possibly save your whole puzzle without much outside damage. The
        only other way is sawing are drilling through that top peak so you can
        screw it down, but that would make the puzzle very unatractive. I
        suggest trying the first way, and using a really sharp knife or a razor
        blade or something and try and pry through the seems of the peek. the
        only other suggestions is to try a post on the twisty megasite forum

        It works now. I am glad, too. It is easier for me to go through other's
        solutions with the applet than do it on my own cube because I tend to
        forget what move I need to do next. This way, I can go along with the
        applet. It is ammusing to see my solution in Java applet form :) I just
        love it. I cannot wait for the next challenge. I do need to learn more
        algorithms though... See ya (off to graduation.. goodbye Eagle's Landing

        20:38:58 -0000 &gt; &gt;Like i replied before, you should probably try
        and pry the cap off so &gt;you can possibly save your whole puzzle
        without much outside damage. &gt;The only other way is sawing are
        drilling through that top peak so &gt;you can screw it down, but that
        would make the puzzle very &gt;unatractive. I suggest trying the first
        way, and using a really &gt;sharp knife or a razor blade or something
        and try and pry through the &gt;seems of the peek. the only other
        suggestions is to try a post on &gt;the twisty megasite forum where they
        deal more with puzzle building &gt;techniques. &gt;jake &gt; &gt;--- In

        and a megaminx from Mefferts, but the &gt;pyraminx &gt; &gt; fell apart

        &gt; &gt; it, as I don't want to wait for a replacement, due to past
        &gt;experience with &gt; &gt; mefferts (just my humble
        oppinion/preference). So here's an exerpt &gt;from my &gt; &gt; other
        thread, in case anyone who might be able to help me missed it: &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I solved it once after my &gt; &gt; girlfriend scrambled it
        for me, took a bit, but I got the hang of &gt;it after &gt; &gt; maybe 5
        or so minutes. Then she was scrambling it again and it &gt;burst to &gt;
        &gt; pieces. 3 of the pyramid points are still firmly connected to the
        &gt;central &gt; &gt; ball. On of the points has however, come off. This
        in turn made &gt;the center &gt; &gt; piece of the second layer fall off
        by nature of construction, which &gt;made 3 &gt; &gt; of the edge pieces
        fall off. So if the pyraminx is supposed to &gt;look like &gt; &gt;
        this: &gt; &gt; /\ &gt; &gt; /\/\ &gt; &gt; /\/\/\ &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        It looks like this: &gt; &gt; /\/\/\ &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with various
        other pieces laying about. Now I have figured out how &gt;it's &gt; &gt;
        supposed to go together, the problem is, getting it back together.
        &gt;The &gt; &gt; construction is a ball with 4 screw holes in in. Each
        of the 4 &gt;peak pieces &gt; &gt; has a screw coming out the bottom
        with the screw head imbedded in &gt;the peak &gt; &gt; puzzle piece. the
        screw threads goe through the "middle" piece (of &gt;which &gt; &gt;
        there are 3 on each side if that makes sense), and screws into the
        &gt;central &gt; &gt; ball. The problem is this: The Peak piece, which
        houses the screw &gt;head, &gt; &gt; turns independantly of the screw
        itself. So there is no way to &gt;assemble the &gt; &gt; puzzle, 100%
        and screw the screw back in. The way I see it, I have &gt;3 &gt; &gt;
        options. I can, drill a hole in the top of the peak piece, and try
        &gt;to &gt; &gt; tighten the screw while the puzzle is assembled with a
        screw driver &gt;through &gt; &gt; the hole (assuming this is a normal
        screw with a phillips or slot &gt;head, &gt; &gt; which is not certain).
        I can try to pry off the bottom part of the &gt;peak, &gt; &gt; screw
        the puzzle back together, and glue the peak back onto its &gt;base (this
        &gt; &gt; is very similar to the way I assume the puzzle was first
        &gt;assembled). Or I &gt; &gt; can simply drop some glue on the screw
        shaft, making it stick to &gt;the peak &gt; &gt; piece and use the
        puzzle piece itself as a screw head. The problem &gt;with &gt; &gt; this
        is that it will make two pieces of the puzzle glued together.
        &gt;Granted &gt; &gt; those two pieces are the peak piece and the only
        other piece it &gt;touches, so &gt; &gt; it's not exactly a challenging
        part of the puzzle that I lose, but &gt;still, &gt; &gt; then it's not a
        100% functioning puzzle. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for any
        help! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I officially have formulated a solution
        to the megaminx. I've &gt;solved &gt; &gt; it about 5 times with no
        problems. And it is now a 12 color &gt;version :). &gt; &gt; Gotta go
        time myself now! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I want to post my last solve on the Records page, but don't know if it's
        too lucky. I want some opinions on this. Choosing from 4 corners, I

        I too recently bought a magaminx from mefferts. It did seem a little
        small. The quality was horrible. Many stickers fell off and I wasn't too
        happy with the bright pink and 2 shades of orange. What's up with that?
        I could barely turn it. After some lubing and sanding, it turned okay
        but exploded on every turn. I found out this was due to a loose screw.
        One of the center caps actually fell off but the one over the screw that
        I needed to tighten almost broke when I tried to pry it off I mow can't
        get the cap to stay back in. It's not worth it in my opinion. The old
        Hungarian Supernova looks better. I like the fact that the corners are
        thicker and the edged com more to a point. It seems easier to turn.
        How's the quality? --The constantly barefoot ¬©H¬Æ√è¬ß &gt; But today when I
        got my megaminx (which is considerably smaller than I &gt; expected), 3
        of the stickers had fallen off. This was kind of ok since I &gt; wanted
        to redo it to a 12 color version, the one I got was only 6. But the &gt;
        kicker was that one of the edge pieces was actually glued to one of the
        &gt; center pieces. This made any turn that tried to separate those two
        pieces &gt; completely impossible, which turned out to be more annoying
        than you might &gt; expect. So I eventually got them separated using a
        very sharp pocket knife. &gt; But I don't feel that that is something
        the end user should have to do. &gt; &gt; Add photos to your messages

        when I re-read this post on my percentages so I decided to &gt; mix &gt;
        &gt; up my cube (thourougly) again and again solved the LL in just one
        &gt; &gt; alg in exactly 10 turns, no adjustment. I'm begining to scare
        &gt; &gt; myself. Last week I learned about 30 more algs. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; Very nice time! 4 moves for the 2x2x2 isnt all that
        lucky. I'd say &gt; since you have learned algs to be able to solve the
        LL in one step &gt; then you should be able to count that as a non lucky
        time. way to go. &gt; theres my take on the situation. &gt; &gt; -heath
        Thanks. Ok great, but since people have different opinions on what is
        and isn't a lucky time I'd appriciate more opinions from others. I
        decided that those estimates seemed iffy and decided to do 50
        consecutive solves to determine some more accurate numbers. I think it
        would also be nice to have other people post some of their interesting
        statistics here. Especially that of the people in the top 10. For
        example, I remember reading somewhere that Jessica employed over 100
        algs in her prime. And Gosbee's secret system has over 300 algs.
        Speaking of which there is probably no consensus on how to count algs.
        For example on Lar's site inverses are usually shown separatly and in
        the Fridrich system some people not count the c/e insertion sequences as
        algs. Speaking of which, although I don't use the Fridrich system
        competitively I've rarely ever encountered a situation that took longer
        then 7 turns to do the cross in face metric. In my usage the term
        algorithm will denote a sequence of moves &gt;=6 turns but with in a
        reasonable length that's end effect only changes one layer AND not
        counting mirrors, inverses, or mirrored-inveres as different. (In
        gerneral, I would find it perfectly fine to call one turn an alg but it
        is not a big deal to say you memorized trivial stuff like: U,U2,U'...
        referring to a disagreement I saw in a post last week.) So I realized I
        was exagerating earlier when I said I knew more then 120 algs. I think
        more than 90 now, realizing that even the OLL/PLL requires precisely 53
        algs, but my number will raise in the comming days. Ok so out of 50
        consecutive solves today here are some of my interesting stats: But
        first I should clearify somethings. This is not OLL/PLL btw, even
        thought I sometimes apply those algs. Hehe, I guess this way I can count
        it non-lucky when OLL stage is skipped because I follow tighter with
        CLL/ELL. Some of these stats will look wrong due to occassional
        preprocessing during F2L. Speaking of which I do not usually use the
        Fridrich F2L, but do when I see that it is possible to do so in &gt;=4
        turns or there's an Extended Cross easily attainable. The edges were
        orientated correctly 13/50 which is about double what is normal. 12% the
        corners were placed correctly relative to each other, less then the
        usual 17%. I was doing 4% during the first half of the session, with I
        found strange. This might have affected my overall stats since it is in
        these 1/6 that I am more likely to solve in one look/alg. Similarly,
        only 12% were of Diagonaly Swapped corners. So I categorized each solve
        into three groups: Bad, Easy, and 1- Look. These had 30%, 62%, and 8%
        respectively. I define Easy in the following manner: all corners are
        orientated and placed AND the edges are in a simple arrangment requiring
        about 7 moves in slice metric and less then 2.5s, 3.2 for the "Z".
        Simple edge cases include, but are not limited to The "Z" permutation,
        "+" permutation, and Allan. To maintain consistancy in these LL
        statistics I limited myself to solving the F2L not too fast or too slow
        since I would then do more or less pre-processing. The majority of F2Ls
        were kept 11-16s with a median at about 15. A few F2Ls less then 10s
        were disregarded since it meant I was greedy and just wanted to finish
        the F2L quick and leave myself with a crappy LL. The LL execution was
        also timed... summing with the F2L and compensating for inspection pause
        most of these were my natural sub- 25 solves. I hope you find this type
        of stuff interesting, feel free to e-mail me with any questions. Oh and
        I do have all 50 encountered LL senerios well documented. Kinda rough
        doing 50 solves a day when I already probably did over 100 earlier. So
        I'm still pondering the question of wheather my 12.26 solves was lucky.
        There's another supporting detail that it is not: I did another sub-13
        later today! But that one was probably lucky. -Doug Li (Slowly but
        surely working on his cube site, btw any one want to host? I had ads.)

        Hi, &gt; is it illegal to paint a thin stripe on the edge of each face
        using &gt; the color of the adjacent face? Yes, this is cheating. With a
        lot of practice it may help you get better times. There will be a rule
        against this or other puzzle enhancements. It would be much cooler if
        you would be able to predict/know what color is on the back side of a

        is it illegal to paint a thin stripe on the edge of each face using &gt;
        the color of the adjacent face? for example, take the red/white &gt;
        edge cubie. on the red face you paint a thin white stripe along the &gt;
        edge to indicate that the other face is white, and on the white face
        &gt; you paint a thin red stripe along the edge to indicate the other
        &gt; face is red. you could do the same for corners (there would be 2
        &gt; colored thin stripes along the edges on each of the 3 corner faces.
        &gt; &gt; i assume this is cheating. does it say anywhere in the rules
        for &gt; the 2003 championship where this is explicitly disallowed? &gt;

        Not to my knowledge. I do believe the closest was Robert Pergl with
        about half of them. As for recgonition it would be differetn for
        different people. I found that I was able to recognize Corner cases in a
        split second, often I would forget or never fully regester which I was
        doing, I would just start doing them while whatching edge movement. Many
        times I'd know what to expect from none flipped, all flipped, and two
        flipped. So I felt that this would be a natural progression for me and I
        have been working on it for the past couple months, but I have planned
        for it over a year ago. I don't get good speed on the CLL thought, and
        probably don't execute the CLL too fast either. I timed my LL's to be 9
        seconds factoring for pauses. But I have got my 13s F2L down and
        sometimes do it in under 10s. So with some more practice I should be
        ready for the Competition. -Doug Li --- In

        Hi friendz, &gt; &gt; Someone scrambles the cube for you and is allowed
        to remove pieces, &gt; &gt; too. Your task is to tell as fast as you can
        if the cube is solvable &gt; &gt; and if it is not, what is it that
        happened (i.e., one twisted corner, &gt; &gt; flipped edge, or swapped
        two cubies, or combinations of those). You &gt; &gt; can average 10
        attempts, as with regular cube solving, and calculate &gt; &gt; average.
        If you guess wrong, it will be treated as a "pop" in &gt; &gt;
        calculating the average. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What would be your
        strategy? What do you think is the fastest &gt; &gt; possible average
        for this? Corner orientation: 2 seconds. Edge orientation: 4 seconds.
        (Recognition would be easier by always starting from the same angle.)
        Total permutation: 15 seconds by counting the number of swaps. But maybe
        the blindfold guys can do this faster. Have fun, Ron

        My megaminx is a little on the stiff side, but no more than I would
        expect. Occaisionally I have a misalligned twist that pops a piece about
        half out of place, and only once has a piece come completely out. But
        overall I'm very satisfied with the construction of the puzzle. I am
        debating lubing it though, as that may make it a bit too loose. Other
        than the stickers, and the two pieces being glued together, I was happy
        with this puzzle. &gt;From: "dishwashersafe22" &lt;s2chris2@...&gt;

        &gt;I too recently bought a magaminx from mefferts. It did seem a little
        &gt;small. The quality was horrible. Many stickers fell off and I wasn't
        &gt;too happy with the bright pink and 2 shades of orange. What's up
        &gt;with that? I could barely turn it. After some lubing and sanding, it
        &gt;turned okay but exploded on every turn. I found out this was due to
        &gt;a loose screw. One of the center caps actually fell off but the one
        &gt;over the screw that I needed to tighten almost broke when I tried to
        &gt;pry it off I mow can't get the cap to stay back in. It's not worth
        &gt;it in my opinion. The old Hungarian Supernova looks better. I like
        &gt;the fact that the corners are thicker and the edged com more to a
        &gt;point. It seems easier to turn. How's the quality? &gt; &gt;--The
        constantly barefoot ÔøΩHÔøΩœß &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But today when I got my
        megaminx (which is considerably smaller &gt;than I &gt; &gt; expected),
        3 of the stickers had fallen off. This was kind of ok &gt;since I &gt;
        &gt; wanted to redo it to a 12 color version, the one I got was only
        &gt;6. But the &gt; &gt; kicker was that one of the edge pieces was
        actually glued to one &gt;of the &gt; &gt; center pieces. This made any
        turn that tried to separate those &gt;two pieces &gt; &gt; completely
        impossible, which turned out to be more annoying than &gt;you might &gt;
        &gt; expect. So I eventually got them separated using a very sharp
        &gt;pocket knife. &gt; &gt; But I don't feel that that is something the
        end user should have &gt;to do. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Add photos to your

        &gt;I don't know how to count to 31 on one hand. I assume that has to do

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you know jasmine, i would think
        emailing and suggesting ways &gt;to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; score &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; higher on a geek test would bump you up AT LEAST
        another &gt;level ;- &gt; &gt; &gt;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emailed the
        webmaster and suggested a few more geeky &gt;Rubik's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        the other day i was just mixing the cube, not paying attention to any
        turns....just turning for the sake of having it my hands and turning
        it...no goal in mind. well, after awhile i just stopped turning and when
        i looked at the cube, the center slice was solved all the way around. so
        i started to wonder if this happens to anyone else...if other's have
        noticed certain patterns occuring after random mixes. i know it happens
        all the time with shuffled decks of cards, so why not the cube...

        the 2nd. I just watched Cube 2 for the first time last night, and it is
        pretty awesome! I know when i posted way back about seeing the first
        one, the initial reaction was, "that movie was a total waste of time" or

        a waste of time, yet they were still good. Though they are not the
        'best' movies I have ever seen, they are considered classics. Cube 2

        Quite often after "randomly mixing" i will look down and the cube will
        have one of the sides solved around a different center. ie, the yellow

        something like that. ----- Original Message ----- From: mrtrickypants

        well, after awhile i just stopped turning and when i looked at the cube,
        the center slice was solved all the way around. so i started to wonder
        if this happens to anyone else...if other's have noticed certain

        It is so fast to solve a 2x2x2 cube to solved it with or without
        inspection. The fastest persons will tell you that it is twice longer by
        the chronometer. Several people believe that the two-step corner method
        is faster. Putting 3 exact corners around the 4th corner to complete one
        layer. I have 3 steps, but my first step is faster. I direct the 8
        corners right from the beginning to a precise and frequent. The method
        opens up on a second step which is simple and super fast. I am certain I
        can achieve it faster in 3 steps. It is absolutly certain that there is
        only one other method that can equal it: true or false? Without having
        practiced. Using the same amount of moves besides, I have fewer
        algorythms to memoryse. Dan Gosbee the fastest rubik's cube? I was not
        present at the October 6 CUBE DAY, but my inquires lead me to believe
        that none of the cube expert who attended was able to solve in less that
        30 seconds, Why do you keep your method secret? You say that the
        chairperson connot participate. Well then, why not deliver it on the
        web? 16.89 average ! The group set the championship to Toronto. I
        already had picture of rubik'cube competition Toronto on my web site. I
        don't no but funny for me. I'm the fisrt &amp; last cubist with the

        I'm new to this group, but i've been following the speedcube community
        for a while. I enjoy looking at the best scores on the "Unofficial World

        different ways of calculating the average time of the 10 cubes can be
        used to better your score. I have 2 examples of Dan Gosbees, and David
        Wesleys numbers, using both the real numbers with 2 decimals, and the

        would get a better score from removing the decimals and addind .5 of a
        sec. I'm not saying that anyone on this list takes advantage of this to
        get a better placing than he deserves, but i feel that it would be more

        Today I set another new avg record: 17.04 secs My times were: 15.89
        16.95 (14.41) 20.00 14.88 (24.53) 16.64 17.58 20.55 16.25 14.49 17.17 As
        you can see very uneven times, but no one was by definition "lucky". I
        lubed my cube for the first time for several weeks, and that made a very
        big difference! I also made an avg of 16.80 but one of the solves had a
        skipped "OLL", so I didn't post it. The last month I have improved from
        18.23 to 17.04, and now I wonder if my improvements will ever stop. I
        guess that the main reason for me becoming faster so quickly is that I
        train A LOT, often several hours a day. Ron has always said that going
        slow is the key, and I must agree. At least trying to look ahead as far
        as possible. It's in the F2L you can save the most time. Hopefully I
        will put out a video of me cubing some time soon on the net, so you can
        see my technique or style and who I am. Anyway I just want to encourage
        everybody to keep on practising, because that's what makes you faster!

        &gt; I couldn't seem to get to your web page. Is it being moved? And
        when are we going to finally see a video of you speed-solving a cube? Or

        could recall them all it would take over 31 years.) I was never too into
        learning pi. I only got to 830 (after the 3), not even enough to get
        into the 1000 club. Maybe I will try again after I'm done cubing. &gt;

        Hello David, I have responded once already but the posting did not show
        up. If it eventually does, I apologize to everybody. I hope Yahoo works.
        David, your sudden improvement indicates that your brain is moving the
        system into a different level. You started "digesting" it and now you
        solve without any breaks, right? ;) Keep it up and do not try to change
        or "improve" anything at this point. That could set you back :) Also, go
        ahead and count that average with one lucky OLL. It is a valid position
        as any other. This applies to LLP as well. If you discount lucky cases,
        you should discount unlucky cases when you did 18.9 because you got a
        really baaad combination of algs that you hate ... That does not make
        sense, right? So, go ahead and post your 16.8 average ;) It is amazing
        how the vision of the championship motivates people to practice and
        become good. I doubt we would have that many people averaging close to
        17 if there was no championship. You are 16, right? And possessed, too,
        right? ;) Congratulations!!! Jessica &gt; Today I set another new avg
        record: 17.04 secs &gt; My times were: &gt; 15.89 16.95 (14.41) 20.00
        14.88 (24.53) 16.64 17.58 20.55 16.25 &gt; 14.49 17.17 &gt; As you can
        see very uneven times, but no one was by &gt; definition "lucky". I
        lubed my cube for the first time for several &gt; weeks, and that made a
        very big difference! I also made an avg of &gt; 16.80 but one of the
        solves had a skipped "OLL", so I didn't post &gt; it. The last month I
        have improved from 18.23 to 17.04, and now I &gt; wonder if my
        improvements will ever stop. I guess that the main &gt; reason for me
        becoming faster so quickly is that I train A LOT, &gt; often several
        hours a day. Ron has always said that going slow is &gt; the key, and I
        must agree. At least trying to look ahead as far as &gt; possible. It's
        in the F2L you can save the most time. Hopefully I &gt; will put out a
        video of me cubing some time soon on the net, so you &gt; can see my
        technique or style and who I am. &gt; Anyway I just want to encourage
        everybody to keep on practising, &gt; because that's what makes you
        faster! &gt; David Wesley

        Hi David, Congratulations on your great improvements! The reason why we
        remove a best and worst time in an average run is to allow at least one
        error and lucky case. So all lucky cases can be counted during an
        average run. Please post your 16.80 seconds average. Have fun, Ron

        already says, not official. You wouldn't even know how many cubists DID
        NOT post their records. There are still many unlisted members on the
        club. But the group of -to us- unknown cubists is huge. We only see the
        group with Internet access, and from that group only those who dare to
        post their records. I wouldn't be surprised if someone from a small town
        in Korea would win the world championship averaging 13 seconds. = All

        one average a month, on a sunday afternoon. Some take rolling averages,

        happened during the 5/16 Fewest Move Challenge. I think that what Mirek
        and David Barr did was absolutely incredible! :) Anyway, here is the
        story as it evolved in front of my eyes (Mirek Goljan sits next door
        here at Binghamton University). I remember Mirek telling me that this

        Congratulations Brent that is correct. I have memorized up to 120 digits
        a while ago and I feel it has helped me learn algorithms easier. It does

        &gt; Hello David, &gt; &gt; I have responded once already but the
        posting did not show up. If it &gt; eventually does, I apologize to
        everybody. I hope Yahoo works. &gt; &gt; David, your sudden improvement
        indicates that your brain is moving &gt; the system into a different
        level. You started "digesting" it and now &gt; you solve without any
        breaks, right? ;) Keep it up and do not try to &gt; change or "improve"
        anything at this point. That could set you back :) &gt; &gt; Also, go
        ahead and count that average with one lucky OLL. It is a &gt; valid
        position as any other. This applies to LLP as well. If you &gt; discount
        lucky cases, you should discount unlucky cases when you did &gt; 18.9
        because you got a really baaad combination of algs that you &gt; hate
        ... That does not make sense, right? So, go ahead and post your &gt;
        16.8 average ;) Sorry, I haven't got my times left =( But I'll beat soon
        anyway... &gt; &gt; It is amazing how the vision of the championship
        motivates people to &gt; practice and become good. I doubt we would have
        that many people &gt; averaging close to 17 if there was no
        championship. &gt; &gt; You are 16, right? And possessed, too, right? ;)
        Congratulations!!! Yes I am young and cube often several hours a day =)
        Thanks for your help! I also want to see video of you! &gt; Jessica &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Today I set another new avg record: 17.04 secs &gt; &gt; My
        times were: &gt; &gt; 15.89 16.95 (14.41) 20.00 14.88 (24.53) 16.64
        17.58 20.55 16.25 &gt; &gt; 14.49 17.17 &gt; &gt; As you can see very
        uneven times, but no one was by &gt; &gt; definition "lucky". I lubed my
        cube for the first time for several &gt; &gt; weeks, and that made a
        very big difference! I also made an avg of &gt; &gt; 16.80 but one of
        the solves had a skipped "OLL", so I didn't post &gt; &gt; it. The last
        month I have improved from 18.23 to 17.04, and now I &gt; &gt; wonder if
        my improvements will ever stop. I guess that the main &gt; &gt; reason
        for me becoming faster so quickly is that I train A LOT, &gt; &gt; often
        several hours a day. Ron has always said that going slow is &gt; &gt;
        the key, and I must agree. At least trying to look ahead as far as &gt;
        &gt; possible. It's in the F2L you can save the most time. Hopefully I
        &gt; &gt; will put out a video of me cubing some time soon on the net,
        so you &gt; &gt; can see my technique or style and who I am. &gt; &gt;
        Anyway I just want to encourage everybody to keep on practising, &gt;
        &gt; because that's what makes you faster! &gt; &gt; David Wesley

        &gt; Hi David, &gt; &gt; Congratulations on your great improvements!
        &gt; &gt; The reason why we remove a best and worst time in an average
        run is to allow at &gt; least one error and lucky case. &gt; So all
        lucky cases can be counted during an average run. &gt; Please post your
        16.80 seconds average. Sorry Ron, I never saved my times =( I have
        always thought that every lucky case should be discarded in an average
        run. Isn't that what the rules say?? But it doesn't matter, I'll
        probably beat it soon anyway. It's enough for myself to know how fast I

        say _thank_you_ for starting this challenge! It is a wonderful idea,
        indeed. Also, I somehow do not believe that this was soooo lucky and
        will never be repeated. As more people participate and methods develop,
        we may see more short solutions (i.e., below 25). I just do not believe
        that the second scrambling Mirek got his hands on was THAT lucky.
        Perhaps, the abilities of humans are not that inferior to a computer. I
        am really curious how the scores in the FMC evolve. And I am happy to
        have someone like Mirek closeby to watch with fascination. Jessica P.S.:

        Hi guys, In Chess game, human predetermined the position of the king and
        queen on the board. The cube is immuable in its movements and universal
        language. I know that most cube people consider the center move = 2
        moves. That's the way computer count (poor). The cube allows but 1 move
        from the center rows, but it takes a longer move. But what would you say
        about 5x5x5 cube from center row? And 2x2x2 pocket cube L'+R= none ?
        Marc Waterman use 50 moves or 90 moves ? No chance for me and the slide
        cubists. It deprives you the opportunity of solving the cube with the
        fewest moves and a long inspection time for the layer by layer method.

        Everyone [and I mean EVERYONE]: Since school is out over here, I have
        decided to START a new contest for you cubers out there (I planned to

        contest are both very popular and exciting (both excellent ideas). [Yes
        Dan, a good idea to start the FMC indeed]. So I come to the thought:
        'What should this new contest be about?'. So I come and ask you cube
        guys (and girls): What should this new contest be about? OR even, SHOULD
        there even BE ANOTHER contest? I would like all the inputs and info!

        Well first of all I think maybe a Wednesday contest might work because
        it'll break up the long week, or for someone who is out of school and
        not working will give us something to do. Just a thought. Anyway you
        could do various challenges like, fewest moves for the square-1 the 4x4,
        5x5, megaminx, or whatever challenges you like. Then maybe combine them
        saying : here are the scrambeling alogrythems for these (x number of
        puzzles), now find the shortest moves total. And if someone dosn't have
        all the puzzles then there will be a catagory for individual puzzles.
        Take my advice or not I don't care, this is your contest. Have a great
        day. -Dylan

        Hello Brent, At this point I just seem to be another in a long list of
        people to verify your first hundred digits of pi. So in fear of being
        redundant, I'll also mention how such a cognitive thing as pi
        memorization had an impact on my life. A few years ago when I was in
        high school I participatetd in a pi memorization contest. In the end I
        recited 5005 digits from momory...a lot of public attention quickly
        followed and I was even flown out to New York to be a guest on the
        "Today Show." ( I also won the competition ). So besides getting you an
        extra point on a geek test and being extremely correct when calculating
        the earth's circumference by hand, I guess memorizing pi can possibly do
        many other things for you! Jake E.

        We could have a "handicap" competition. That would be something everyone
        would have a chance to win...everyone would have to use their best
        average that they have posted at speedcubing.com...you could come up
        with the set of scrambles. If my best average is 28.95, I subtract that
        from my time for your set. Low score wins. People would need to have
        their best average posted at speedcubing... It seems like this
        competition would work to the advantage of fast improving

        Hello JAKE: Man, this is awesome stuff! Do you have a website or
        something where you have strategies of memorizing 5000 digits of PI? I
        really would have the devotion for memorizing such a large amount, but
        unfortunately I don't have the TIME for it... That's amazing, really!
        How many digits can you remember by hand now? Just curious... I find

        puzzles(one time or average) -doing puzzles with only looking into a
        mirror -have a list of places to solve a cube through the
        week(underwater, infront of a group of 20+, on a roller coaster....im
        not going to think of too many right now, but this could get creative!
        -# of cubes per hour -biggest crowd to cube infront of through out the
        week (this would ecnourage people to cube in public more) -most people
        to teach how to cube through the week(i know this would make me want to
        teach someone how to cube) -fastest time on a computer cube -largest
        cube solved ---basically you could just go through the Unofficial Worlds
        Records Pages and find a ton of different categories. -Heath

        &gt;I have 2 examples of Dan Gosbees, and David Wesleys numbers, using
        both the &gt;real numbers with 2 decimals, and the ones without decimals
        and .5 sec &gt;addition to the time : &gt; &gt;Dan &gt;16.44 16.25 17.10
        17.18 16.47 15.19 17.08 17.11 18.00 18.09 =&gt; avg 16.89 &gt;16 16 17
        17 16 15 17 17 18 18 =&gt; avg 16.7 + 0.5 =&gt; 17.2 &gt; &gt;David
        &gt;16.33 18.13 17.86 18.44 16.75 16.88 17.05 16.99 17.31 17.85 =&gt;
        avg 17.36 &gt;16 18 17 18 16 16 17 16 17 17 =&gt; 16.8 + 0.5 =&gt; 17.3
        &gt; &gt;In Dan's case his best score comes from using the system with
        decimals, but &gt;in David's case he would get a better score from
        removing the decimals and &gt;addind .5 of a sec. Hi Terje! I agree that
        it would be better to have a standard, although I like to cube in a
        cafe, so I don't have a good sub-second timer yet. But I don't think
        there is as much of a problem with using the integer method as you might
        think -- you happened to choose an example average that is a bit of an
        anomaly. The 16.89 average is unusual in that the average decimal
        portion of the times is 0.2 (when you truncate the integer portion).
        Assuming there is a normal distribution of decimals between .0 and
        .99999999 with a mean value of .5, the standard deviation for the
        average decimal portion in a sample size of 12 times is about 0.083
        seconds. This means that the 16.89 average is over 3.6 standard
        deviations from the mean. (Probability 1 in 5000). That's why there is
        such a big difference between the real average and the integer average.
        The 17.36 average, on the other hand, has an average decimal portion of
        0.559, which is 0.71 standard deviations away from the mean, falling in
        the middle 52.2% of averages. That's why the decimal-to- integer
        discrepancy is much smaller. Approximately: 87% of integer averages are
        accurate to within +/- 0.1 seconds. 98.3% of integer averages are
        accurate to within +/- 0.2 seconds. 99.96% of integer averages are
        accurate to within +/- 0.3 seconds. So that's why I think the situation
        that you brought up is kind of unusual. Here are some other averages in
        the top 20, comparing the real average to the integer average + 0.5:
        Katsuyuki Konishi: 17.49 versus 17.60 (+0.11) Jess Bonde: 17.70 versus
        17.70 (same!) Masayuki Akimoto: 18.22 versus 18.30 (-0.08) Lars
        Vandenbergh: 19.01 versus 19.00 (+0.01) Ross Palmer: 19.75 versus 19.70
        (+0.05) Another good statistical measure is the maximum of the 12
        decimal portions from each average. Again assuming a normal
        distribution, the mean value of the maximum decimal for an average of 12
        times is .923. But for the 16.89 average, the max is only 0.47. The
        probability of getting an average like this is actually fewer than 1 in
        10,000 averages, so the big discrepancy is pretty rare. Of course I
        agree that the online records are officially "unofficial" anyway -
        that's why they should just be for fun! Dan

        It's hard to come up with original contest ideas. One I've thought about
        is pair or team solving. It could be most fun in person, but over then
        net you could do it so that the people in a team make every other move,
        without conferring of course. Or more than one each to lower boredom.

        cubing since then but got the bug again a couple of weeks ago, but have
        a totally unusable cube for speedcubing. I have clocked myself to 49 sec
        on a layer by layer method with this cube but i wont post any scores
        before i have a better cube. I have ordered a prepared studio cube from
        Ton, so when i get it i'll post my scores :) If i get fast enough i
        might even try to learn a few more algos, but right now i'm too lazy and
        have too much other stuff going on. Terje p.s. I agree with you on that
        there are many different reasons to why the scores are hard to compare
        accurately, and that's why they are indeed unofficial records :) &gt;

        group] Scoring system for the avg of 10 &gt; solves &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi
        Terje, &gt; &gt; Welcome to the club! Please join us one day in the
        chatroom &gt; during the weekends &gt; and we can have a chat. &gt; &gt;
        I agree with you that it would be better to compare when all &gt;
        cubists would post &gt; averages using the same timing system. &gt;
        Still I would like to make the following remarks: &gt; = The list is FUN
        and useful to cubists, to see where they stand &gt; and to get &gt;
        motivated by the ever growing number of cube fools like us. It was Chris
        &gt; Hardwick's idea, and he is still amazed about the success of the
        &gt; list. We just &gt; had our 400th person on the 3x3x3 single solve
        record list! &gt; = The Unofficial World Records are, as the name
        already says, not &gt; official. You &gt; wouldn't even know how many
        cubists DID NOT post their records. &gt; There are still &gt; many
        unlisted members on the club. But the group of -to us- &gt; unknown
        cubists is &gt; huge. We only see the group with Internet access, and
        from that &gt; group only those &gt; who dare to post their records. I
        wouldn't be surprised if &gt; someone from a small &gt; town in Korea
        would win the world championship averaging 13 seconds. &gt; = All
        circumstances are different. Alone in your bed room, at the &gt; office
        with 5 &gt; colleagues watching, or on a stage with an audience. &gt; =
        Some cubists start cubing when they see the 0 of the timer, &gt; some
        start the &gt; timer by releasing a key on the keyboard, some try to
        start at exactly 0 &gt; seconds. &gt; = Some cubists take averages
        dozens of times a day. Some cubists take one &gt; average a month, on a
        sunday afternoon. Some take rolling &gt; averages, some don't. &gt; &gt;
        So records will always be hard to compare. &gt; &gt; But yes: everyone
        in decimals would be better. Actually many &gt; records were posted &gt;
        before we had Jess's fantastic timer. &gt; The reason why I don't post
        records in decimals is that I have &gt; very bad light in &gt; my
        computer room. But I hope to change that soon. &gt; &gt; What is your
        reason for not posting at all? ;-) &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt; &gt; Ron

        Of the ideas proposed so far I really like the handicap contest and the
        cubing in different scenarios idea. When I had a club at my high school
        I used to do handicap races among people a lot, since everyone was at a
        different skill levels. The handicap races were usually head to head or
        maybe 3 or 4 people but I'm sure they can be expanded to more. Anyway
        they really are a lot of fun because if you do the handicap right, then
        pretty much anyone has a good chance of winning that round, which makes
        everyone nervous and try to cube faster :) We could make the handicap
        include unique stuff too, like one handed or solving 2 or more cubes, in
        addition to the typical head start idea. I also think it would be cool
        to have to cube in those different scenarios every week (in front of 20+
        people, etc.). Just my two cents. Chris --- In

        This is always the problem in high-class competitions, where fractions
        of a second count. Whztever you do, make sure Gyinness approves of the
        sveraging method. Maybe the timer should be hooked to a computer, that
        would automatically calculate the aversge. The program that does the
        calculating should be written by Guinness. Use those numbers to deterine

        &gt; &gt; I agree that it would be better to have a standard, although I
        like &gt; to cube in a cafe, so I don't have a good sub-second timer
        yet. But &gt; I don't think there is as much of a problem with using the
        integer &gt; method as you might think -- you happened to choose an
        example &gt; average that is a bit of an anomaly. &gt; &gt; The 16.89
        average is unusual in that the average decimal &gt; portion of the times
        is 0.2 (when you truncate the integer portion). &gt; Assuming there is a
        normal distribution of decimals between .0 &gt; and .99999999 with a
        mean value of .5, the standard deviation for the &gt; average decimal
        portion in a sample size of 12 times is about 0.083 &gt; seconds. This
        means that the 16.89 average is over 3.6 standard &gt; deviations from
        the mean. (Probability 1 in 5000). That's why there &gt; is such a big
        difference between the real average and the integer &gt; average. &gt;
        &gt; The 17.36 average, on the other hand, has an average decimal
        portion &gt; of 0.559, which is 0.71 standard deviations away from the
        mean, &gt; falling in the middle 52.2% of averages. That's why the
        decimal-to- &gt; integer discrepancy is much smaller. &gt; &gt;
        Approximately: &gt; &gt; 87% of integer averages are accurate to within
        +/- 0.1 seconds. &gt; 98.3% of integer averages are accurate to within
        +/- 0.2 seconds. &gt; 99.96% of integer averages are accurate to within
        +/- 0.3 seconds. &gt; &gt; So that's why I think the situation that you
        brought up is kind of &gt; unusual. Here are some other averages in the
        top 20, comparing the &gt; real average to the integer average + 0.5:
        &gt; &gt; Katsuyuki Konishi: 17.49 versus 17.60 (+0.11) &gt; Jess Bonde:
        17.70 versus 17.70 (same!) &gt; Masayuki Akimoto: 18.22 versus 18.30
        (-0.08) &gt; Lars Vandenbergh: 19.01 versus 19.00 (+0.01) &gt; Ross
        Palmer: 19.75 versus 19.70 (+0.05) &gt; &gt; &gt; Another good
        statistical measure is the maximum of the 12 decimal &gt; portions from
        each average. Again assuming a normal distribution, &gt; the mean value
        of the maximum decimal for an average of 12 times &gt; is .923. But for
        the 16.89 average, the max is only 0.47. The &gt; probability of getting
        an average like this is actually fewer than 1 &gt; in 10,000 averages,
        so the big discrepancy is pretty rare. &gt; &gt; Of course I agree that
        the online records are &gt; officially "unofficial" anyway - that's why
        they should just be for &gt; fun! &gt; &gt; Dan

        A cube may be held with each of the six colors as the Up side and
        rotated with four different colors facing Front; therefore we have 24
        overall facings. Take a scramble and apply it to all 24 facings and do
        24 solves, use it as a double 12 fastest: throw out the slowest two and
        fastest two, and average the remaining twenty. David J

        Hey all, as you may have heard from my incessant babbling, I recently
        got a megaminx. So I finally settled down and took my first average of
        12 solutions. To scramble I just twisted probably about 200 times while
        not looking. I then had 10 seconds inspection, and started twisting like
        crazy :). So my first average is 4:59.68. Times were: 4:36.52 5:39.86
        POP (4:24.58) 5:05.99 5:41.69 4:58.74 (6:11.22) 5:13.71 4:47.19 4:30.58
        4:31.92 4:50.58 I had piece pops a couple times, but only counted the
        one. It is a 12 color megaminx as well. I used the solution I came up
        with, which is a mixture of my solution to the 3x3x3 cube and a few last
        layer steps that I just kinda made up. If anyone is interested in my
        solution, I typed it all out last night. At any rate, I'm looking for
        pointers to get closer to that record of 2:11.56 set by Grant Tregay!
        (Yeah right, that's a long way off for me!) Cheers! Daniel Hayes BTW,
        I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but the pyraminx is effectively fixed...
        a bit more loose than I'd like, but still, it works at least :)

        Team solving...I like that idea-very original. That would be rather hard
        if you can't talk to eachother and don't even know what method the other
        people are doing. Each person should be able to do up to 10 moves (or 1
        alg) before handing the cube off to make it a little faster and easier.
        Doing this in person with 1 cube would be a lot easier but there are
        ways to do it over the net. This would work for fastest time or fewest

        Hello, I just posted some pictures from April when I met with Richard
        Carr (master of blindfold cubing and Oinkleburger) here in Binghamton.
        Richard did the 3x3x3 cube blindfolded in a little over 5 minutes
        including memorization. It was fascinating seeing this in real life! The
        pictures are at http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/blindfold.html
        Also, I just asked a friend of mine to tape me so that I can stop this
        procrastination and post some movies. We did some closeups of my hands
        and whole views, as well. They were mostly 16's. I also did 4 of my
        favorite lightning fast finger tricks! I am curious if I can beat the 8
        moves per second record set by Dan Knights! :) For this, we need to
        analyze the video frame-by-frame, however. The person who taped this
        told me that the movie looked like fast-forwarded already ... :) Anyway,
        I hope to post the movies tomorrow. I will let you know! Jessica

        Geez, eight moves per second? That's crazy! Cool. What's your average
        moves per second, and average number of moves? Just curious. That's

        Everyone; Well, so far, I have decided to stick with the idea of having
        a 'handicap' contest with your fastest 3x3x3 average posted on
        speedcubing.com (possibly with larger cubes as well...) Also, it WILL be
        called the Wednesday Contest, and each day will have a seperate contest
        on cubing in front of the most people, cubing with one hand, etc. I will
        have ALL the details, AND the contest UP and RUNNING by June 25, by the
        ABSOLUTE latest (since I am loaded with summer assignments, etc.). So,
        if you have any suggestions, or criticisms about this, just let me know
        so far ;). So it is: The Wednesday Contest! :) Brent :) --Brent

        trick that I call "The Stick", I perform 30 moves in 89 videoframes (3

        Brent, No, sadly, I don't have a web page with strategies for
        memorizing. But I know something that really helped me was to keep a
        rhythm while reciting the digits. Going at full speed I kindof sounded
        like I was rapping the digits. This is also something I enjoy doing
        while cubing, to get my finger tricks to punch out a rhythm....does
        anyone else do this? At this point I only remember the first few hundred
        digits of pi. In fact, it had probably been a good year since I last
        recited it when you first posted and I tried to check your digits. So in
        a way I'm still surprised that I know as many as I do! About the time
        commitment. It might not take you so long to memorize so many digits as
        you think if you really have an insane passion for it. I really
        memorized most of those 5000 digits in the span of a week, and even
        averaged more than 1000 digits a day on the weekend (this was the week
        before the competition, so I gave it my all) But I'm not sure if I would
        recommend such an extreme approach either, my head hurt for a few weeks
        after and I had a hard time doing simple daily neccesites for a while. I
        did forget those last couple thousand digits a few days after reciting,
        which goes to show you that I probably just have a good short term
        memory....which is also why I now enjoy spending most of my cubing time
        solving blindfolded. I got so much attention with the memorizing because
        my home town paper (the 'Fargo Forum,' yeah, I live in Fargo, ND) wrote
        an article that made its way to the associated press; and then any
        paper/TV station in world has my contact info and can print the
        information (I have newspapers from both Taiwan and New Zealand where
        I'm on the front page!). So with New York, I just got a call from the
        Today show a few days after I'd won the competition and they said "hey,
        ya wanna be on our show?" And, well, how can you resist that? Good luck
        on all you memorizing and cubing, Jake E. --- message from Brent Morgan

        Jessica: Excellent videos!!! I have to say, as I watched these
        'lightning fast' videos i fell off the chair. It was a privelage. I know
        I won't get a 'top' placing at the championships, but I will be glad to
        see all the pros be there, and see them in person. (Jessica, Ron, Katsu,
        Chris, Knights..and many others). Brent Thomas Guillier

        Hi Everyone, I have just posted a Windows Cube Timer application. Anyone
        is welcome to try it out, but it's a test version so I can't promise it
        will work! You need an Pentium-class (or better) processor. I wrote this
        in Visual Basic 6 using the "QueryPerformanceCounter" function, which is
        accurate to nearly 1 millionth of a second. I developed this because I
        wanted to fix some faults with all of the other available cube timers:
        1. Only the space bar makes the time start and stop. Thus, it is not
        possible to mess up your time by hitting other keys. Sometimes when I'm
        using Ron's timer, it deletes my time as soon as I stop the timer, so
        that I can't write it down. 2. The timer starts as soon as the space bar
        is RELEASED. The timer ends as soon as the space bar is PRESSED.
        Although I really like the functionality and presentation of Jess
        Bonde's timer, it stops the time when the key has been pressed and
        released, which means you lose some time if you forget to tap the key
        quickly. Notes for usage: - The Cube Timer keeps your times and average
        copied to the system clipboard, so you can just go into a text document
        and paste them in! - The Cube Timer allows you to delete times, in case
        one of them was a pop, or the time was produced by mistake. - I made
        this in about 4 hours as my first Visual Basic project, so it's just a
        test version. - I like to use a Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard, which has
        a nice big space bar for slamming down the cube! Let me know your
        comments and suggestions: dan_knights@...

        on mid-solution. (unlike you guys who clock in at 17s regularly). I
        would get to an easy PLL at 39s, think "wahey, looking good" and clock a
        45, wondering what I did wrong. The answer is that the timer doesn't
        tick over quick enough. In fact it loses about 3 seconds every 40s. Is
        there anything that can be done about this?? (Just in case, I'm in the
        computer lab at university where we've got some nice 2.4Ghz pentiums)
        Oh, yeah, and I checked: the final time is correct, it's just the
        ticking clock which doesn't work. Greg

      <div class="email-content">
        &gt; &gt;After placing the cross, since all F2L slots are empty, do the
        faster &gt;cubers use the shortest (or perhaps fastest given finger
        tricks) algorithm &gt;to solve any F2L case? What I am basically asking
        is did you find it &gt;necessary to learn a new set of algorithms which
        take advantage of the fact &gt;that all slots are empty, and then use
        your more standard ones later on. &gt; I reckon some shortcuts (i.e.
        using empty slots to do different moves from the basic set of 41 F2L
        algorithms) are so much faster you really should become familiar with
        them; especially the ones where the edge cubie is in the wrong slot and
        the corner is on the top face (R'F2R, for example), but exactly how far
        it is worth travelling down this path will depend on each individual.
        But of course you won't be able to decide for yourself without looking
        into it yourself. And some of the standard moves are the same length,
        regardless of how many corners are free. Lots of the best speed cubists
        use shortcuts, confirmed by going through examples of their F2Ls, like
        this one of Jessica's:
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/examples.html In one of these
        examples she even uses odd pairs to speed things up! (I think Olly also
        uses odd pairs, but when I asked Ron about this he said he only does so
        very rarely.) For all those who have not explored these shortcuts, a
        basic set can be found here: http://www.oinkleburger.com/cube/f2l/. Some
        other good ones can be found at www.speedcubing.com: Algorithms --&gt;
        First two layers --&gt; Advanced tricks for F2L As a consequence of
        learning these my F2L got significantly slower at first, but the
        recognition is definitely speeding up now, as it becomes more automatic.
        If I ever get it fully automatic I reckon I would be looking at a
        dramatic improvement compared to if I had just stuck to the basic 41. So
        what are the problems / advantages of incorporating more algorithms? If
        you think about it, the F2L goes through two stages, up to four times:
        1a. finding a corner / edge pair that needs inserting, AND 1b. deciding
        which algorithm to use 2a executing the algorithm, AND 2b starting again
        on 1a and 1b (or OLL if last corner) The first stage may happen more
        often, because you may spot more than one corner / edge pair, and want
        to select the optimal pair. Now, familiarizing yourself with a whole
        load of extra moves that use empty slots means, for each step: 1a. no
        change 1b. more complicated, and potentially slower 2a. potentially
        faster, but of course fewer moves does not necessarily mean fewer
        seconds, because some moves and algorithms can be done much faster than
        others. 2b. potentially *slightly* harder, but perhaps no change (?) So
        it is all up to you!! ==== Another (more personal) thought about number
        of moves in F2L ... Say you are just starting on F2L and notice that you
        can insert your first corner / edge slot with the following: L U2 L' I
        no longer do this. Now I would do: U' L U' L' This is an extra move, but
        for some reason I find it much much easier to look ahead (step 2b) if I
        break the U2 into two separate moves. With LU2L' I find it a lot harder
        to follow the pieces and anticipate where they will end up; with ULU'L'
        sometimes I have already found the next pair before finishing up. So, by
        adding moves to my F2L some of my F2L solves are up to 2 seconds faster
        than before. Wierd, huh? I wonder if anyone else might be the same ...

        Dan, I like this timer. It is more idiot proof then the others out
        there. However I have a few ideas. I think it should follow tradition
        and only go out to the hundredths, or at least give and option to change
        this. My major issue is that it should have and option to beep during
        the timing similar to Bonde's timer. Is the average given, the session
        average or the average of the last X times? Also how is the trimmed
        average calculated, within all the times or the last 12? The timer
        should take into account that some people do running averages while
        others do not. It would be nice to add and option on how the times are
        copied into the clipboard, I prefer the times to be separated by returns
        for example. Thanks for the timer. I think I'll use it as my default
        cube timer. -Doug P.S. oh and if it's not too much trouble, how about a
        progress graph... No just kidding. P.S.S. I know you helped make the
        diagrams on Helmstetter's site. I would like to know if I could use them
        on my upcomming website. Also I am working on a script to generate my
        own based on my own notation. It was probably ages ago when you worked
        on that, but I was wondering if I could have a copy of that, assuming
        that's what you used and that you or Helmstetter still have it. BTW any
        one who is an expert on ASP, please e-mail me (d_funny007@...). --- In

        You need an Pentium-class (or better) processor. I wrote &gt; this in
        Visual Basic 6 using the "QueryPerformanceCounter" function, &gt; which
        is accurate to nearly 1 millionth of a second. &gt; &gt; I developed
        this because I wanted to fix some faults with all of the &gt; other
        available cube timers: &gt; &gt; 1. Only the space bar makes the time
        start and stop. Thus, it is not &gt; possible to mess up your time by
        hitting other keys. Sometimes when &gt; I'm using Ron's timer, it
        deletes my time as soon as I stop the &gt; timer, so that I can't write
        it down. &gt; &gt; 2. The timer starts as soon as the space bar is
        RELEASED. The timer &gt; ends as soon as the space bar is PRESSED.
        Although I really like the &gt; functionality and presentation of Jess
        Bonde's timer, it stops the &gt; time when the key has been pressed and
        released, which means you lose &gt; some time if you forget to tap the
        key quickly. &gt; &gt; Notes for usage: &gt; - The Cube Timer keeps your
        times and average copied to the system &gt; clipboard, so you can just
        go into a text document and paste them in! &gt; - The Cube Timer allows
        you to delete times, in case one of them was &gt; a pop, or the time was
        produced by mistake. &gt; - I made this in about 4 hours as my first
        Visual Basic project, so &gt; it's just a test version. &gt; - I like to
        use a Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard, which has a nice big &gt; space bar
        for slamming down the cube! &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me know your comments and

        Hi Greg, I know what you mean. Excluding pops and mistakes, which

        will not join those folks. Personally I do not care for memorization. I
        prefer to visualize, derive and formulate. Take pi, for example. A very
        easy and derivable formula reads: 1=tan(pi/4) reshuffling, oine gets
        pi=4*arc tan (1) you can plug this formula in a program and presto, the

        So why bother to memorize? By now you know me and know what I do. Maybe
        some of you think I have to memorize a lot of design strategies. Wrong.
        I memorize nothing or very little. I just build those patterns on
        individual cubes by judicious twiddling. Soif you hand me a picture of a
        design like Jaroslav and ask me how I construct it, I would say:"Here

        Pi is useless to memorize. Hell... I used to know 30+ decimal digits of
        Pi, but now I know a little less... 3.14159265358979323846... Yes,
        pi=4*arctan(1). However, why use that formula? It is very inefficient.
        It takes 628 terms to approximate pi to just two decimal places.
        Ramanujan has a formula that add 8 digits of pi every iteration. Other
        methods exist. Like Euler's series for k = 4: 1/1^4 + 1/2^4 + 1/3^4 +
        1/4^4 + ... = pi^4/90 "I prefer to visualize, derive and formulate." I
        think you would agree that memorization is needed for proficiency in
        anything. I hope you do not visualize, derive, and then formulate the
        multiplication table from one to ten every time you need to do simple
        multiplication. I love to do exactly what you said, but I memorize
        things once I understand them. This way, doing the next step is a bit
        easier. You make it sound to me as if you would try developing calculus
        by starting out with arithmetic, developing algebra, developing geometry
        and trig, then calculus without memorizing rules (once understood).
        Surely, you memorized a lot of things to develop new things. Here is how
        I work in math: I understand all of the topic. I memorize the rules. I
        work problems using techniques I figure out on my own. I rarely resort
        to memorizing techniques of others, however I do need to memorize
        things. Happy cubing, James Sibley --------- "My mother never saw the

        this morning to try it but I realized it was too late to send it in to

        I did last week :-P I know many can do better then 19 moves but that is
        good for me. I had something else to say but I forgot... damn memory.

        use that formula? It is very inefficient. It takes 628 terms to
        approximate pi to just two decimal places. Ramanujan has a formula that
        add 8 digits of pi every iteration. Other methods exist. Like Euler's
        series for k = 4: &gt; 1/1^4 + 1/2^4 + 1/3^4 + 1/4^4 + ... = pi^4/90
        &gt; Machin's formula is quite good pi = 16*arctan 1/5 - 4*arctan 1/239
        is quite good. The Chudnovsky's had a good formula for pi. The best
        known base 10 formulae have quadratic convergence or better, I think. If
        you want pi in base 16 then the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe result is good.
        You can get places without calculating all the previous ones. &gt; "I
        prefer to visualize, derive and formulate." &gt; I think you would agree
        that memorization is needed for proficiency in anything. I hope you do
        not visualize, derive, and then formulate the multiplication table from
        one to ten every time you need to do simple multiplication. I love to do
        exactly what you Well if it were me, first of all, I'd prove that a
        function called multiplication exists. This would involve first proving
        that addition exists and that would be preceded by proving a recursion
        theorem. Also, I'd have to define the natural numbers and so forth.
        said, but I memorize things once I understand them. This way, doing the
        next step is a bit easier. You make it sound to me as if you would try
        developing calculus by starting out with arithmetic, developing algebra,
        developing geometry and trig, then calculus without memorizing rules
        (once understood). Surely, you memorized a lot of things to develop new
        things. &gt; &gt; Here is how I work in math: &gt; I understand all of
        the topic. I memorize the rules. I work problems using techniques I
        figure out on my own. &gt; &gt; I rarely resort to memorizing techniques
        of others, however I do need to memorize things. Understanding all of
        the topic can be quite hard. So even can all the rest of that technique.
        Here's a text to prove it: Cardinal Arithmetic by Saharon Shelah. If you
        can understand all of the topic, memorize the rules or work the problems
        using techniques you figure out on your own (any one of them, I'm not
        even asking for all), I'd be fairly impressed. &gt; &gt; Happy cubing,

        I don't think i would participate in memorizing the decimals of pi. I
        need some sort of reason to memorize something other than the sake
        knowing something. Hana, you shouldn't need to memorize much of anything
        to find your designs. they seem to be a lot of the classic 4 move center
        swap or 6 move checkerboard pattern. Some require more twisting then
        others but the individual cube patterns arent all that complicated.
        Please don't take offense to this but some of your designs just don't
        seem all that impressive, its just a bunch of simple cube patterns
        stacked up on each other. The main impressive thing about them is all
        the cubes you have for your designs! The few designs that i do find
        interesting are the ones you use to show a mathmatical concept like
        fractles and such! You definately have a unique perspective to the
        cubing world Hana, I am looking forward to seeing your designs in person
        some day! Jake --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Hana M.

        Voices of admiration were heard. Sorry, &gt; I will not join those

        visualize, derive and formulate. &gt; &gt; Take pi, for example. A very
        easy and derivable formula reads: &gt; 1=tan(pi/4) &gt; reshuffling,
        oine gets &gt; pi=4*arc tan (1) &gt; you can plug this formula in a
        program and presto, the computer will &gt; give you a value of pi. You
        choose the decimal precision. So why &gt; bother to memorize? &gt; &gt;
        By now you know me and know what I do. Maybe some of you think I have
        &gt; to memorize a lot of design strategies. Wrong. I memorize nothing
        or &gt; very little. I just build those patterns on individual cubes by
        &gt; judicious twiddling. Soif you hand me a picture of a design like
        &gt; Jaroslav and ask me how I construct it, I would say:"Here are some
        &gt; clean cubes I brought from home. Let me show you. Sorry, I don't

        looks like both of these were lucky in that they were much faster than
        your normal time. If someone performs every step of their solution, but
        encounters their "best" algorithm for their last two steps, surely this
        is lucky? I think looking at your times is the only way to know whether
        you were lucky or unlucky or normal. If we had some better definitions
        of lucky, nonlucky (normal) and unlucky, maybe we could just cancel out
        the lucky and unlucky times and average the rest. On the other hand,
        maybe we should only remove lucky times from the equation :-) In my
        opinion, people should be striving flatten out their times: - to prevent
        unlucky times, and - to not rely on the occasional lucky time to get a
        good average Counting only normal and unlucky times in your final
        average would seem to encourage that. Maybe one of mathematicians on
        this list can figure out how to calculate this statistic and even give
        it a name ;-) Ryan

        I am about to start memorizing 17 of the 21 PLL algorithms. For all you
        that have memorized them all, how long did it take you? I plan to learn
        one to two a day... depending on my memory that day. I use the Petrus
        system and I want to do the LL with semi-2 looks. I say that because I
        will still flip the edges but only know 2 orientation cases (for the
        corners). If I figured it right... I will cut 9 moves average because I
        do not have to swap corners. In doing all of this, I will start
        averaging about 64 moves per solve. Later on I might memorize all the
        orientation cases for the corners so I can cut maybe 2-3 moves. What
        would you call this method... Semi-Petrich? After I learn the PLL cases,
        I will be able to solve the cube using Chris's extended cross with more
        proficiency. Using his method, I average maybe 100 moves because I have
        to flip the LL edges two at a time with my own 8 move sequence :( James

        Semi-Petrich? I also used this system about 4 or 5 years ago. It didn't
        have a name back then, but people now call it the Petrich system
        (http://borntodie.free.fr/themethod.htm). That is, when you learn all 13
        permutation and all 6 orientation algorithms. It's a good way to get
        fast without learning too many algorithms (only 19). You should learn
        the permutations in a useful order. Here's what I suggest (using the
        symbolic names on Jessica's site): First phase: - "A" for moving corners
        (If you do corners before edges, you can just rotate the LL around until
        one corner matches and apply this) - "U" for moving edges Second phase:
        - "E" for moving corners in special case - "Z" and "H" for moving edges
        in special cases Third phase: - Learn most common cases where you can
        move corners and edges in one go: "J", "R" and "G". J is easy, G is
        difficult because you need to learn how to do it forwards and backwards,
        left and right mirrored. However, it is the most common case so worth
        the effort. Fourth phase: - The rest: "T", "V", "F", "Y" and "N" For "H"
        in the second phase, I recommend learning: LRU2L'R' + B'F'U2BF which is
        easier to memorise. After you learn all those, you'll find the 6
        orientation algorithms much easier to learn (they are relatively short).

        &gt; &gt; This is a really good functionality. &gt; &gt; There is one
        problem: The time indicator doesn't change fast enough. I've I just
        uploaded a newer version with an accurate time indicator and a larger
        time display font. BTW, the average and the "trimmed average" refer to
        the whole list of times, not a rolling average of 12. I want this timer
        to mimic competition settings - that's why I didn't design it for
        rolling averages. Whenever I get to 12 I start a new average. I might do
        some more work on it in the future, though. Dan

        Hi James, It took me three days to learn all PLL algorithms. I already
        knew the basic ones of course. And for the new ones I started with the
        easiest algorithm. F.i. for the cases P14-P17
        (http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_permutation.html) I used one
        algorithm normal/mirrored/inverted/mirrored+inverted. Once you know all
        PLL algorithms, you will start learning better finger tricks and better
        algorithms. We are all still looking for better algorithms for our worst
        cases. It will probably never stop... Have fun, Ron

        Hello Ron, I would like to figure out finger tricks. It is much easier
        to pick them up as one is learning the algorithms. I have nice tricks
        for swaping two corners but when I learn all the PLL cases, there will
        ne no need for it anymore. I can do that with an average of 4
        moves/second. I solve the whole cube with an average of 1.45
        moves/second on average. I am about 2.8 for the LL right now. Just
        imagine my F2L :-p At the time of this writing.. I already knew 4 of the
        cases and I just learned 2. I am working on the 3rd one although it is
        1:34 AM. I figured I will learn 4 a day. I will do it by learning one
        row at speedcubing.com a day. Since I know the last one on the first
        row... I will just assume I learned it today and call it quits :) James

        I've been trying to reduce the numbers of moves I'm doing, so I'm trying
        to learn all the PLL algs. But my main problem is the F2L. I found out
        that it almost always takes me over 40, and often over 50. I use Lars'
        method, by the way. I think part of the trouble is putting together the
        2x2x2 cube at the very beginning. but then step four, where you extend
        to 2 layers, also takes a great deal of moves. Fortunately I've devised
        a few moves with good finger tricks, so I can get through them very
        quickly. Does anyone have any tips on shortening my F2L?

        place the edge, then conect the two. Sometimes, I will notice I can
        create a corner/edge pair and slide that in for a 2x2x2 creation of

        I also spent three days, like Ron I knew a few already, from having
        learnt simpler systems before, then I spent two days learning all of the
        cases minus the "3-corner + 3-edge cycles" (cases 18 to 21 on
        www.cubestation.co.uk) and then a day to learn the final four. Of
        course, the learning doesn't stop there, but once you confidently know
        an algorithm for each PLL case, you can be much happier about going on
        to learn new/better/different angle algorithms and add them to your
        armoury! Good luck mate - DanH (also no worries about last week's FMC,

        The way I do the 2x2x2 part is I get a corner-edge pair put together
        (either the blue-orange-yellow or the green-orange-yellow; I also find
        it helps to start with the same colors every time so I'm used to them).
        Then I put the corner-edge pair into the right place, then I add all the
        other edges. It's basically the same for extending to 2x2x3. Here's a
        list of my average number of moves: 2x2x2: 10 9 12 14 [7] [15] 11 11 7
        10 12 11 = 10.7 2x2x3: 8 8 7 9 9 9 8 7 8 [4] [10] 9 = 8.2 Orient edges:
        3 [8] 4 3 5 [0] 3 6 3 6 2 4 = 3.9 Extend to 2 layers: 20 [11] 14 22 21
        24 12 [25] 24 23 18 21 = 20.8 TOTAL: 43.6 My worst part, obviously, is
        the 2 Layers. But I believe that the 2x2x2-2x2x3 can be much faster on
        average. But like I said before, since only two faces are being turned
        in step 4, I can do it really fast. I can't find my good cube right now,
        but on my bad cube step 4 takes about 7-8 seconds which is about 3 moves
        per second as opposed to my average 2 to 2.5 moves per second. --- In

        After looking at Jessica's finger tricks(amazing stuff, btw), I had a
        cool idea. There's a website, Superhandz.com, that is all about amazing
        hand manipulation. Their main thing is cards; it kind of started out as
        a magic site, but then grew more into just card manipulation, then grew
        into a everything manipulation. but anyway, they have cards, coins, cup
        stacking(yeah, like that girl), pen spinning, sunglasses manipulation
        (I'm eager to see this, but it's not up yet), lock picking, etc. I
        personally think that Speedcubers could easily fit on that site as well.

        It looks as if you are doing fine in terms of moves for the 2x2x2 block.
        I could learn how to do mine better :) I took an average last night on
        how many moves I do it in: [11 10 11 12 13 (14) 10 13 14 10 (7) 12] / 10
        = 11.3 moves I used to average something like 20 because I did not know
        what I was doing. It took me a few days to figure out a strategy for
        making it. As for the 2x2x3, I place the top edge, then the corner, then
        the last edge. What I should work on is placing the top edge then the
        corner/edge pair. For speedsoloving, it looks like you are doing just
        fine in terms of moves. Competing step 4 in 7 seconds is great. I can
        complete it in about 8 seconds, which, for me, is 2.3 moves/sec. My last
        layer is about 3 moves/sec. I hate my speed for steps 1-3... it is
        something like 1 move/sec. I am working on improving that. I just had a
        thought... I notice that the number of moves you do for step 4
        (extending to F2L) is not very consistent. I used to have that same
        problem. The method I used that caused such inconsistency was to place
        the top edge, place the corners, than place each edge in one at a time.
        I would vary between 18 moves and 32 moves (one or two times at 40!!). I
        have learned you do not have to turn just those two faces to finish the
        F2L. Mr. Petrus says on his site to make sure you turn only those faces,
        but I have one algorithm in which I don't, and it cuts about 3 moves.
        That is a lot for me :) You just have to make sure that the edges stay
        oriented correctly. If you want, I can find out the average number of
        moves I use to complete the F2L just for a comparsion. And, I hope I am
        not coming off as an expert of the Petrus system... hehe. I am still
        learning, too :) James Sibley --------- "My mother never saw the irony

        For step four, I came up with a few alorithms sort of by accident that
        are loaded with finger tricks. That's how I do it so quickly. I'll try
        to explain it, but it's kind of confusing: 1. Put the first selected
        corner on the last layer, facing downwards. So if the top color was
        orange, then the orange side of the corner will be on the bottom, or
        red, face. For this example, this corner will be orange-blue-white, and
        the edge will be blue- white. 2. I'm going to try to explain what the
        cube looks like now: The top color is orange, the front is white, the
        bottom is red, the left is green, and the right is blue. The corner is
        on the bottom layer facing down. Then you get the blue-white edge into
        the proper location, on the right side of the white face, and do the
        move F2. This way, the blue-white edge is in the green-white location.
        Make sure you don't move the blue-white-orange corner from it's position
        facing downwards on the LL. 3. Turn the LL until the blue-white-orange
        corner matches up with the blue-white edge. Then you can simply place
        the blue-white-orange corner-edge pair into the right place. This
        probably sounds reeaally confusing, but it makes sense after a while. Or
        maybe it's just because I made it up, is why it makes sense to me. Kind
        of like my 4x4x4 solution. The algorithm to pair up the edges is long
        and confusing, and the edges need to be in exactly the right place in
        relation to each other. And no one else understands it so far but me. :)

        In the process of looking at the PLL algorithms for memorization, I
        noticed the odds in which each case will come up in terms of 288. With a
        little thinking, I figured out how they got 288. 288 = (4!4!)/2 I can
        see where (4!)^2 came from. There are 4! different permutations possible
        for corners and the same goes for edges. However, I know dividing by two
        has something to do with the limits on how the permutations can come up.
        Why 2? Or is it 2 factorial? And how did they get the odds like 16/288
        and 4/288? I should read up on combinatorics :) James Sibley ---------

        I think the reaso nthat so many people here are memorizing it is because
        it helps improve the memory. Speed cubers need a good memory for
        algorithms, which makes sense as to why you don't need to do it. Because
        you don't memorize algorithms for artwork. I don't think you do, do you?

        Yes, I can see why you needto memorize algorithms for speedcubing. Have
        you seen my designs in http://cube.misto.cz ? Because they are 3
        dimensional, one cube has to contribute to more than one face of a
        design. This makes matters bit more complicated than for 2 d dezigners

        If you mean what I call the six-0 pattern, you are partially right. 4-0
        pattern on opposite faces is very easy, but the 2-9 pattern on opposite
        faces is impossible. However, you can make a 6-0 pattern on adjacent
        faces. I use those as corners and edges for the Menger Sponge, which
        appears to be the favorite of some club members. :-) This, of course,
        makes the Sponge 3-color design. That's another thing you speedcubists

        I thought this was obvious, the number is divided by 2 because you can't
        swap two corners without swapping two edges. It should however probably
        be divided by another 2, to factor out one symmetry. -Doug --- In

        With the Petrus system, you orient all the edges before the final layer.
        Then, you swap two corners, orient corners (not need for edges.. already
        oriented), then permutate edges. With the Fridrich method you orient the
        whole LL and then permutate the whole LL. The Petrich method you ignore
        the swaping of two corners (and maybe orientation of edges if you know
        all OLL algorithms) and solve the LL like the Fridrich method. James

        Petrich... Never thought of it that way... But if you ask me, a LL is a
        LL. You can solve it any way you want. But of course the Petrus method
        does have the edges oriented already, so you can orient corners, permute
        corners, permute edges, or you can orient AND permute corners, permute
        edges, or you can orient corners, permute corners AND edges, or do all
        three with the Petrus method. I don't know anyone who does all three,
        though. It would be pretty cool, because there can't be more than a
        couple hundred algorithms. So if you could do the F2L Petrus method,
        then do the LL in one alg, that would probably be a less than 16 second
        average! I think. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, James

        I finally made a video of myself solving the cube. I couldn't upload it
        to the files section, because there seems to be no file space left.
        Here's a link to a zip file:
        http://web.holmstroms.com/skogshyddan/david_kuben.zip I only had a few
        tries not warmed up, so the time 16.5 seconds was not too bad at all.
        The quality is not very good, and you can't see exactly what is
        happening to the cube, but I'll try to fix a better video some time in
        the summer. Enjoy the speedcubing! David Wesley

        I finally went to the pool today and tried out my underwater cubing
        skills. I have solved the cube underwater, but that was 2 years ago and
        my times were around a minute and a half. Now that i'm solving right
        around 30 secs i was able to scramble my cube and solve it again without
        taking any breaths! I will be trying 3 shortly but i think i should prep
        another underwater cube! Jake

        Today I broke the 3:00 minute barrier with my megaminx. I must say, I
        love this puzzle, lots and lots of fun. My average was 3:30.82 with my
        best time being 2:57.55. Only good enough for 5th or so on
        speedcubing.com, but still, admirable I think. And a huge thanks to Mr.
        Grant Tregay for helping out, sharing pointers and such. One question,
        is there a standard color scheme for these? When I got mine it was only
        a 6 color version, stickered. So I pealed off the stickers that hadn't
        fallen off already and painted it 12 colors: white/yellow, green/blue,
        orange/red, pink/purple, grey/black, neon green/neon orange. At any
        rate... yay! Daniel Hayes [Non-text portions of this message have been

        I bought a cube last week and lubed it by taking out one of the edge
        pieces and spraying silicon spray into the cube. It worked pretty good;
        not quite as good as I wanted, but it was decent. After a week of heavy
        usage, it got a little "rusty" so I wanted to lube it again. This time I
        took apart the whole cube and sprayed each piece and the middle piece.
        Then I set them down for about 15 minutes and then put the cube back
        together. For some reason now my cube is slower than it was before. The
        faces don't move freely....like if I turn it by putting a little
        pressure on, it doesn't turn freely instead it kinda jumps a few times.

        The layer by layer system is tough, That was my first instinct too. I

        Right now I'm using the timer at http://www.rubiks.dk/timer.html. I like
        it a lot because it does averages, but I kinda want a timer that makes a
        beeping sound on the countdown like in Jessica's videos so I don't have
        to look at the screen in order to start. Anybody know of any good ones?

        Actually, time you use has been updated, but the new version can't be
        used online - it's downloadable. It has the beeping sounds you heard in
        her videos. It used to be in the downloads section, but while the site
        is under construction, Jess has made it available at:

        only had a few tries not warmed up, so the time 16.5 seconds was &gt;not
        too bad at all. The quality is not very good, and you can't see
        &gt;exactly what is happening to the cube, but I'll try to fix a better

        Yes, Ron is right, I used odd pairs quite rarely as the extra thinking
        time doesn't seem to quite compensate for the decreased number of moves.
        About 1 cube in 5 could use odd pairs quite adequately but half of those
        are just as good with normal pairs so only 1 cube in 10 is this worth
        doing on. That was in reply to: --- In

        definitions of lucky and non- lucky are useful at all. IMHO, it looks

        their "best" algorithm for their last two steps, surely this is lucky? I
        think looking at your times is the only way to know whether you were
        lucky or unlucky or normal. I do agree with your point about
        encountering your best algorithms meaning that you were lucky, but you
        still have to have performed it. My pb is 12 as opposed to an average of
        22, and it required a full solution just I saw it really easily and
        didn't fumble. I sort of regard it as a bit lucky in that respect, but
        in other peoples eyes it is just a normal cube. I have a clutch of
        13/14/15 all the same. Also, some people strive to get fast cubes
        whereas other people have been more striven to good averages hence the
        faster times may be by cubers who are slower on average just they took a
        lot of guesses that went right (instead of slowing down so that they
        could know for sure where the pieces were) and hence solved at fast
        speed. If you fastest time is less than 2/3rds of your average then I
        guess you are guessing or going too fast too often to get consistent
        times but you will probably get more freak times. No rigorous
        mathematics for this just a general feeling. - stiff_hands

        I watched maybe the final ten minutes of Test the Nation on Fox (here in
        the USA). They said that the average IQ of females is 111 and for males
        is 113. Now, this looks a little fishy, eh? The average IQ is ALWAYS
        defined to be 100. They said during the show they calculated a norm and
        all that good stuff. a/x = 111 and b/y = 113 Assume the average IQ is
        100 (like it SHOULD be) 100 = (a + b)/(x + y) 100 = (111x + 113y)/(x+y)
        100x + 100y = 111x + 113y 0 = 11x + 13y This means that for the average
        to be 100, the number of males or females HAS to be negative. Assuming
        that the number of females in the US equals the number of males, the
        average IQ would be 112. Is my thinking right? It seems Fox rigged the
        show just right so many people feel happy about themselves and will
        watch Fox more. James Sibley --------- "My mother never saw the irony in

        &gt; ("american" numbers on this page) &gt; &gt; I have one little
        question about an example on this page... In its 3 &gt; digit example,
        (472) it says to pronounce it 'four hundred and &gt; seventy two'. I've
        always been told that putting 'and' in the middle &gt; like that is not
        the correct way to do it. It should instead &gt; be 'four hundred
        seventy two', reserving an 'and' for a fraction, as &gt; in 'one and one
        third'. &gt; &gt; Anyone know proper usage? Just curious. That is a nice
        reference &gt; page, though. &gt; &gt; - Grant Depends where you live.
        In the States there's no "and". In the UK it is. As to the possibility
        of confusion (mentioned in another post), if one can't tell that seventy
        two is an integer and two thirds is not then one ought to be worried
        about other things than the presence, or otherwise, of a conjunction.

        Also, English is a Germanic language (i.e. it has its roots in German).
        Think about numbers in German if you will. Vierhundertzweiundsiebzig.
        Note the "und" for "and". The omission of the "and" is very much like
        the omission of the "u" in colour - it is an American convention.
        (Besides, what if one is using a base other than ten? Then there can be
        no decimal place. Also, there is no decimal place in four and three
        tenths. Four point three would have a decimal place but four and three
        tenths does not. If we are to be really technical about things then
        fractions in the usual definition aren't real numbers anyway (although
        there is an isomorphic copy embedded in the real numbers) so they don't
        have decimal points.) &gt; Now, as for someone asking you what the

        That's a normal noise. It was present in each of the last 3 cubes I
        prepared on one of the faces. It will go away naturally. Also, try to

        Total it took me about a week. I sat each night for maybe 2-3 hours
        figuring it out. That is a week to apply a solution to a single solved

        I hope to pick up the motivation to solve it sometime soon. Lately I
        have been too lazy to do anything. I have not speedcubed in a week and I
        have not memorized any new PLL algorithms yet. Shame on myself :-P Maybe
        a good nights rest will do... I have neglected sleep for a week. I am
        working out a solution method. I figure that if I am going to solve it
        layer-by-layer, I must first place the centers and then a corner and the
        edges around it in at the same time. It is all in theory.. in practice,
        I will see :) James Sibley --------- "My mother never saw the irony in

        i'll add that the numerator (above the 288) is always an integer
        divisible by 4 because the last layer can end up in any of the 21
        permutations in one of 4 different LL rotational positions (since LL is
        4-sided). if you add up all the probabilities of all 21 permutations,
        you find you get 284/288, leaving 4/288 for the "solved" final layer.
        obviously there aren't 4 ways to have the last layer already "solved",
        but there is 1.solved, 2.solved but LL 90 ccw out, 3. solved but LL 180
        out, 4. solved but LL 90 cw out. as for why it is half of 4!4! divided
        by 2, it sounds like you're right-- it has to do with the fact that all
        4!4! permutations are not reachable from a solved cube. i am not sure of
        the exact logistics of why it is exactly "half" though. take care, eric

        I think I will adopt the Petrus system for the 4D cube. If my math is
        right, I will have to build a 2x2x2 on each 3x3x3 cube that creates a
        vertex. The number of cubes that create a vertex in on a 4D cube is four
        3D cubes, right? I just have to figure out how to convert the algorithms

        problems earlier this week, and i may have lost solutions sent to me on
        saturday and sunday. If this affects any of you, please post again, I am
        sorry for the inconvenience. I have Zbigniew's and Charles Tsai's
        solutions If I don't have yours, you still have until Friday to post!

        Hey Hana (aka Master with Cube designs): Sure PI is really useless
        memorize, and there really is no need at all to know it in 100 digits.
        Since i'm a kid, I like to learn new things and memorize it just for
        fun. PI in a 100 digits memorized IS useless, but to me so are spicy

        I had no problems applying the Petrus method to the 4D cube. But I
        thought it was easier (more moves) to solve it using an extended edges
        first method. I usually solve it by doing the 24 centers, 32 edges, then
        the 16 corners. I have an abundance of edge preserving corner
        algorithms, each of which translates into several 4D algorithms. Solving
        the edges took care though and was fun. I think it is harder then a
        20x20x20 cube, but then again, the 3^4 has much more combinations. -Doug

        Which one is the "Y" algorithm? Maybe the code will help me. I have the
        same problem with swaping two diagonal corners. Whenever I get to that,
        it really slows me down. One of the reasons I am TRYING to learn the PLL

        I'm learning those same algorithms, but I'm not up to Y yet. I had that
        problem with F, that my fingers couldn't do it very well. Just practice
        them and find the one you like the best, and do it slowly until your
        fingers pick it up. Then eventually you should know it reeaally well. I
        also find it helps to use an algorithm that doesn't turn very many
        faces, so the second one would be my first choice because it only turns
        the L face, the U face, and the F face, then the B face at the end. The
        first one uses R, B, U, D, and L, and the third one uses B, L, R, and U.
        But that's just my humble opinion. --- In

        Ok, James is onto something. What I've done and seems to be working out
        nicely is to take the the X axis and then the Y axis as it's shown in
        the picture on jessica fridrich's page. Or more simple, reflected over
        the diagonal axis from the top left to bottom right of the picture.
        Anyway, that gives you the same move essentially but it's easier for me
        because I'm right handed. Using the second listed algorithm I now do: U2
        R2 U R' B R U' R' U' B' U' R' F' U F this feels more comfortable, I like
        it. Should have thought about this a while ago I guess. Thanks for the

        Eventhough there have been alot of posts about timers lately im making
        yet another one. Ever since Dan Knights posted his Cube timer i've been
        using it about 90% of the time. I really like it for a couple reasons.
        Number one being how you start the timer. I like it because you dont
        have to worry about starting before or after the timer actually starts.
        The other thing I really like is that it copies all your times so you
        can just paste them into a word document. Here are a couple ideas I have
        just come up with, i'd like to know if they are possible. If anyone has
        some free time and is willing to put it together I think it would be
        awesome. I like the layout of Jess's timer, so something like that would
        be good. I would want the option to have a countdown like jess's timer,
        with the beeping to tell you when to start. Also i'd want the option to
        start the timer by releasing the space bar, just like on Dan's timer.
        This timer would also have to be able to calculate averages and keep
        track of times. Now the new idea for the timer... It would be nice to
        just have a continuous log file for the times. I have a
        program(messenger plus 2) for MSN messenger that logs everything said
        during the chat. It saves it all in a notepad document. So the cube log
        could be about the same thing, but since sometimes you have a piece pop
        and things like that i'd like to just be able to hit a button that would
        automatically paste the times and date into a notepad document, after I
        complete an average. ok enough of my pointless babble. -heath

        That's what I usually do, but in the algorithms that I'm learning
        there's alot that don't have any good finger tricks. So you should make
        sure to choose algs that are simple for your hands in particular. Most

        What I found out works is two things: 1) Run the algorithm over and over
        again... like after you do it once.. from that state the cube is in, do
        it again.. repeat step one. After a few times.. the cube will return to
        the solved state. 2) On your computer, write out the algorithm. Then
        using the spacebar and delete key if necessary, space out the algorithm
        into subalgorithsm that make sense. For example...
        LU'RD2R'UL'RU'LD2L'UR' = [LU'R D2 R'UL'][RU'L D2 L'UR'] Run that on a
        solved cube... to me, it is a lot easier to solve. I can make sense of
        the algorithm and I broke it into easy-to-remember chunks. With brackets
        it also shows I can remember half of the algorithm! If I wanted to, I
        can perform the first bracket, turn the cube around 180 degrees and do
        it again. James Sibley --------- "My mother never saw the irony in

        Break the alg down into finger tricks that you can easily remember, then

        &gt; &gt; My pb is 12 as opposed to an average of 22, and it required a
        full &gt; solution just I saw it really easily and didn't fumble. I sort
        of &gt; regard it as a bit lucky in that respect, but in other peoples
        eyes &gt; it is just a normal cube. I have a clutch of 13/14/15 all the
        same. I think "luck" comes not only from being able to skip a step, or
        encountering your best algorithms, but also just finding that all the
        pieces you need for the next step are right in front of your eyes, and
        in a good position (particularly in the "intuitive" parts of your
        solution where genuine thinking time is spent). But standing back from
        all the technical reasons, these "This was not a lucky time..." records
        that shave 40% off their average time look a bit funny :-) Not to say
        that these records are invalid, of course. I hope one day I can achieve
        those times while performing the full extent of my solution. I just
        think we are using the word "lucky" in an unusual way (maybe we could
        just say "I performed the full extent of my solution", instead of "This
        was not lucky"??). Ryan

        I would also break it down further because steps of 2s and 3s are very
        simple to plug into your short term memory. like: [(LU'R) D2

        also helps you rememberit better like in (#1 ) and (#3) Are the same

        choose different groups, hash table sizes, and the like. If anyone's
        interested I can make source available, but it does require about 700 MB
        of RAM, and the input is not the colors of the facelets, but rather a
        sequence of moves. And it requires about an hour to precompute a large
        hashtable the first time you run it. And there's absolutely no UI (it's

        I wouldn't normally use this medium for a message like this, but I have

        there's bound to be something lucky about it. If he's one of your

        non-lucky in just one particular respect (for example, that you did not

        "lucky" why not count any solve &gt; which involved an algorithm that
        you learned from someone else? I am trying to make the definition
        simpler, not more complicated! Here is the current definition of lucky
        time published in the "rules" section of the speedcubing.com records
        pages: | A lucky time is any time you solve the puzzle and a step (3 or
        | more moves) of your normal solution is skipped. There are three |
        exceptions: 1) You worked for it, f.i. by anticipating the next | step.
        2) The chance to skip the step is 20 percent or more. 3) | The skipped
        step represents 2 percent or less of the total moves | of the complete
        solution. Example: if you use the | cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system, then there
        are 7 steps, and skipping | one of the steps would be a lucky case. For
        blindfold solving a | lucky case is defined by: 1) no corners to be
        twisted and/or 2) | no edges to be flipped and/or 3) two or more corners
        correctly | placed in upper or lower layer and/or 4) more than two
        middle | layer edges already in middle layer. I propose that we replace
        that with something simpler, like: | A lucky time is any time that is "X
        percent" faster than your | average time. Or even just replace "X
        percent" with "significantly faster", "much faster", or "*way* faster"
        and let people's guilt decide :-) The advantage this has over the
        previous definition is that it is fair to all varieties of solving
        methods. The previous definition is unfair to some methods in which you
        would have to be unlucky to encounter all of your steps - the 20%
        threshold hasn't been proven to be fair on all methods with different
        numbers and sizes of steps. Also, the previous definition doesn't apply
        to methods that have no clear steps. Note: this definition is all about
        "time", as it should be since it is a definition for "lucky time". I
        think a definition for "lucky solution" would also be useful, for
        example, to use instead of "lucky time" on the 3x3x3 fastest time page.
        It would speak in terms of the length of move sequences instead of the
        length of time, so a "record time for a non-lucky solution" would be
        when your solution had enough moves or steps, but you were able to
        recognise and execute them more quickly than other non-lucky solutions.
        The previous definition for "lucky time" is sort of like a definition
        for "lucky solution". Maybe it can be used as a starting point. So, it
        seems important to be specific about what we mean by lucky: whether it
        be a lucky time or a lucky solution. To say "this record was not lucky"
        is slightly ambiguous. When someone says "this time was not lucky" and
        they really mean "this solution was not lucky", it can be misleading. I
        had not realised until now these two distinct meanings of lucky, but it
        seems to clear up any misunderstandings if we make the distinction. Just
        food for thought. Ryan

        especially since it was the culmination of a lot of work. All the
        differnt things I'm working on came together. &gt; &gt; If you wish to
        be so strict about "lucky" why not count any solve which involved an
        algorithm that you learned from someone else? &gt; &gt; I am trying to
        make the definition simpler, not more complicated! Actually you
        introduced the idea, albeit accidentally. You said, &gt; [snip] (maybe
        we could just say "I performed the full extent of my solution", instead
        of "This was not lucky"??). &lt; If you performed the full extent of
        Lars' or Jessica's solution it's not your solution, is it? Some people
        were lucky to find all the algs that other people developed. What would
        their times be if not for other's work? &gt; Here is the current
        definition of lucky time published in the "rules" section of the
        speedcubing.com records pages: &gt; &gt; | A lucky time is any time you
        solve the puzzle and a step (3 or &gt; | more moves) of your normal
        solution is skipped. There are three &gt; | exceptions: 1) You worked
        for it, f.i. by anticipating the next &gt; | step. 2) The chance to skip
        the step is 20 percent or more. 3) &gt; | The skipped step represents 2
        percent or less of the total moves &gt; | of the complete solution.
        [snip] &gt; &gt; I propose that we replace that with something simpler,
        like: &gt; &gt; | A lucky time is any time that is "X percent" faster
        than your &gt; | average time. &gt; &gt; Or even just replace "X
        percent" with "significantly faster", "much &gt; faster", or "*way*
        faster" and let people's guilt decide :-) This is an terrible idea.
        Deleting *way* faster times from someone's stats isn't fair at all,
        espescially for arbitrary reasons, i.e. they're 40% faster. As
        individuals get faster these spikes happen, and they are important in
        showing the cubist that they can improve...and often *how* to improve.
        &gt; The advantage this has over the previous definition is that it is
        fair to all varieties of solving methods. The previous definition is
        unfair to some methods in which you would have to be unlucky to
        encounter all of your steps - the 20% threshold hasn't been proven to be
        fair on all methods with different numbers and sizes of steps. Also, the
        previous definition doesn't apply to methods that have no clear steps.
        Yes. If I went by that definition I could claim a 13.25 as my non-lucky
        time, as the 20% that fell into place was my hardest 20%. &gt; Note:
        this definition is all about "time", as it should be since it is a
        definition for "lucky time". &gt; &gt; I think a definition for "lucky
        solution" would also be useful, for &gt; example, to use instead of
        "lucky time" on the 3x3x3 fastest time page. It would speak in terms of
        the length of move sequences instead of the length of time, so a "record
        time for a non-lucky solution" would be when your solution had enough
        moves or steps, but you were able to recognise and execute them more
        quickly than other non-lucky solutions. The previous definition for
        "lucky time" is sort of like a definition for "lucky solution". Maybe it
        can be used as a starting point. &lt; Since everyone may apply the
        scramble differently, then a particular scramble can favor some
        solutions more than others. Suppose we used the same solutions, if you
        start on white and I start on blue the scramble may favor you simply
        from where you started. I suggested for a solving contest to apply the
        same scramble all 24 ways and solve them all. What are the chances that
        one or more of these would be lucky? Eventually a cubist could learn to
        recognize the shorter solves, but that takes the ability to start on any
        side. Eventually this would lead to a higher and higher proportion of
        "lucky" solves. I got no feedback about that idea so I don't know if
        there's any interest. &gt; So, it seems important to be specific about
        what we mean by lucky: &gt; whether it be a lucky time or a lucky
        solution. To say "this record was not lucky" is slightly ambiguous. When
        someone says "this time was not lucky" and they really mean "this
        solution was not lucky", it can be misleading. I had not realised until
        now these two distinct meanings of lucky, but it seems to clear up any
        misunderstandings if we make the distinction. Neither the time nor the
        solution was lucky. :) &gt; Just food for thought. Just playing with
        ideas. &gt; Ryan David J

        Sorry, what I meant to say was that an alternative to coming up with a
        better definition of lucky would be to avoid using the word lucky in a
        vague sense, and use more specific words instead - in each case a
        different adjective would be appropriate. &gt; If you performed the full
        extent of Lars' or Jessica's solution &gt; it's not your solution, is
        it? Some people were lucky to find all the &gt; algs that other people
        developed. What would their times be if not for &gt; other's work? Your
        interesting point aside, you must be agreeing with me that the term
        "lucky" is vague. People should say what specifically is lucky or
        non-lucky about their record, if they want to use the word at all,
        otherwise it can be misinterpreted (even in the way that you just
        pointed out, but perhaps not as likely ;-) &gt; &gt; | A lucky time is
        any time that is "X percent" faster than your &gt; &gt; | average time.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or even just replace "X percent" with "significantly
        faster", "much &gt; &gt; faster", or "*way* faster" and let people's
        guilt decide :-) &gt; &gt; This is an terrible idea. Deleting *way*

        faster these spikes &gt; happen, and they are important in showing the
        cubist that they can &gt; improve...and often *how* to improve. Ok,
        you've seen the negative possibilities are many. I'm not interested in
        those applications. You seem to be thinking that I wish to apply the
        constraint that all records in all categories must not be "lucky times".
        This is not the case. I was merely attempting to clarify what "lucky
        time" means and suggest that we only use that specific term when that's
        what we really mean (for example, in somebody's personal record
        description). Specifically, I don't think we should be saying "this was
        not a lucky time", if we really mean "this was not a lucky solution", or
        "I skipped no steps of my solution", or something else. Additionally, I
        am suggesting that the constraint on the "3x3x3 fastest times" records
        list be changed from excluding lucky times to excluding lucky solutions.
        That would more accurately describe how people are currently using that
        list (whereas currently, the casual observer may be mislead into
        thinking that these were not lucky, but typical times) Recall: &gt; &gt;
        I think a definition for "lucky solution" would also be useful, for &gt;
        &gt; example, to use instead of "lucky time" on the 3x3x3 fastest time
        &gt; page. It would speak in terms of the length of move sequences
        instead &gt; of the length of time, so a "record time for a non-lucky
        solution" &gt; would be when your solution had enough moves or steps,
        but you were &gt; able to recognise and execute them more quickly than
        other non-lucky &gt; solutions. The previous definition for "lucky time"
        is sort of like a &gt; definition for "lucky solution". Maybe it can be
        used as a starting &gt; point. &lt; &gt; &gt; Since everyone may apply
        the scramble differently, then a &gt; particular scramble can favor some
        solutions more than others. Suppose &gt; we used the same solutions, if
        you start on white and I start on blue &gt; the scramble may favor you
        simply from where you started. &gt; &gt; I suggested for a solving
        contest to apply the same scramble all 24 &gt; ways and solve them all.
        What are the chances that one or more of &gt; these would be lucky?
        Eventually a cubist could learn to recognize the &gt; shorter solves,
        but that takes the ability to start on any side. &gt; &gt; Eventually
        this would lead to a higher and higher proportion of &gt; "lucky"
        solves. &gt; &gt; I got no feedback about that idea so I don't know if
        there's any &gt; interest. Maybe you're lucky. Sorry, I couldn't resist
        ;-) If you solve a single scramble from 24 angles, maybe your chances of
        getting a lucky solve would increase by roughly the same amount as if
        you had solved 24 different scrambles, assuming all scrambles are
        random. I wonder? I suppose it is a useful to solve the same scramble in
        24 ways if you are attempting the Fewest Moves Contest. (In the current
        FMC rules, you are allowed unlimited attempts, so attempting the same
        scramble in many ways would increase your chances of getting a lucky
        solution (most people's technique?). As I said before, I think it would
        be fair to have separate record lists for those who use unlimited
        attempts, and those who use a single attempt. But back to your idea...)
        Just a point of interest: I am able to solve the cube starting from any
        angle, and can find the optimal solution to the first step or two.
        However, and although you can rarely foresee this, sometimes suboptimal
        solutions to the first part can lead to better overall solutions, as is
        demonstrated by Herbert Kociemba's 2 phase algorithm. The algorithm
        starts out with an optimal solution to the first phase, and this usually
        leads to an overall solution of between 25 and 30 moves (I think). Then
        it continues to blindly test suboptimal solutions for the first phase,
        and by chance (not intelligence), the overall solution quickly drops
        down to about 20 moves in length. Why does the algorithm use chance here
        instead of intelligence? Apart from the fact that it gives results
        sooner, perhaps you would need to have God's intelligence and God's
        algorithm (or just a fast computer with the combined intelligence of
        many humans - see Mike Reid's optimal solver) to look that far ahead in
        reasonable time. I think your idea is interesting if you want to find
        out the best performance you can get out of any particular scramble. I
        think if you do that, you will benefit from luck (for example, if one of
        the worst openings turned out to lead to the best overall solve of 24),
        but you may also learn how to find the best start from any angle. Best
        starts are still useful, because that's all you've got - you can't
        realistically look ahead to the end of the whole solution. On the hand,
        maybe some day sombody will achieve the impossible... Tony Snyder seems
        to think it is possible. If you're only interested in the average, maybe
        24 random scrambles is just as effective. &gt; &gt; So, it seems
        important to be specific about what we mean by lucky: &gt; &gt; whether
        it be a lucky time or a lucky solution. To say "this record &gt; was not
        lucky" is slightly ambiguous. When someone says "this time was &gt; not
        lucky" and they really mean "this solution was not lucky", it can &gt;
        be misleading. I had not realised until now these two distinct &gt;
        meanings of lucky, but it seems to clear up any misunderstandings if
        &gt; we make the distinction. &gt; &gt; Neither the time nor the
        solution was lucky. :) I am guilty of imposing my definition of luck on
        you. What do you mean when you say "lucky time"? Is it just that the
        time threshold is different, or does your definition include many
        variables (like steps skipped) that are specific to your own solving
        style? Ryan

        These shortcuts are of limited value, because when they come up
        alongside other free corner / edge slots during the F2L you can just
        ignore them and treat that slot as another unsolved "empty" to speed up
        other F2L solves. But if no other corner / edge pair immediately

        Hi all! Just got back from vacation in California. It gave me a lot of
        plane time to memorize algorythems and stuff. Well a day or so before I
        left I took an average. My time was 1:01 with a new fastest time of :43.
        So I spent the down time of vacation working on memorizing and F2L
        stuff. On the plane ride back I decided to take a new average. My
        average came to :47.3 with a new fastest time of :37 seconds (done with
        a second hand of a watch so pinpoint times might not be accurate). To
        put this in a sense that everyone can understand that would be like
        droping 25% of your time in a week. I was wondering, does anyone eles
        have this kind of progress before the get really fast? My studio cube
        came in while I was on vacation so I'm going to get working on that now.
        Have a great day! --Dylan

        I got a 70% drop in my time. I went from 5 minutes to 90 seconds in one
        week. Then, I went to 1:10 in a week from 90 seconds. That is a 22.2%
        drop. From there on... I am cubes much less than I did in the first 4
        weeks. Mainly because cubing is the same thing over and over again
        except with the fact that I get really fast. I dropped from 60 seconds
        to 53 seconds in 5 days merely by making one step of the method I use
        much more consistent. I still average 53 seconds. I should be in the
        averaging 40 seconds right now, but I don't cube as much as I should. I
        am working on increasing my motivation level :) James Sibley ---------

        Hi everyone. As I posted a few hours ago, I'm going to go work on
        loosening up my studio cube. I've heard that Scilicone spray works very
        well in lubing cubes. Since I don't have any spray I was wondering if
        Vasoline works just as well. I've tried it before but I want a good

        You could always solve it to that state. That would be greater than your
        50 moves I believe. Someone posted a sequence that you perform twice and
        it does it. In Cube Explorer, you can set the "scrambled" state such
        that all the edges are flipped and then reverse the algorithm it gives
        (I did it once and was able to do it without reversing...). I think I

        lol. Like I said though, I &gt; found a sequencewith Cube Explore and
        did not reverse it... it worked fine. Superflipping the cube from a
        solved state is reversing all the edge cubies Solving the cube from a
        superflipped state is reversing all the edge cubies So the same
        algorithm will do both. An algorithm of order two is one which when
        applied twice to a solved cube will solve it again: R2 R'L' U2 RL FB U2
        F'B' The superflip algorithm will work like that: any edge flipping
        algorithm is orger two, moste corner flipping algorithms are order 3.
        The useful thing about an order 2 sequence is that both it and it's
        reverse have the same effect. This is good if you can't get your fingers
        to work well one way. Am I correct in saying that any algorithm is of a
        finite order? Is there any method to calculate this order without just
        repeating it until a solve comes? Greg

        of these - since the cube group is finite every element has finite
        order. (There are also infinite groups where every element has finite
        order. Off the top of my head, I'd imagine that an infinite dimensional
        version of a rubik cube could give such a group but, if not, it is
        trivial to come up with examples anyway such as a direct product of
        infinitely many torsion groups.) In fact, this has come up before. If
        you work in the group generated by &lt;U,D,F,B,R,L&gt; then any element
        has order at most 1260. Ron found a move of higher order, as I recall,
        but he was working in &lt;U,D,F,B,R,L,M,E,S&gt; which is a different
        group.

        you do it twice and you get the &gt; original cube back; it is its own
        inverse. &gt; &gt; Which brings up an interesting question: are there
        sequences of &gt; order 3? (Do them three times and you're back where
        you started.) &gt; (yes) 4? (yes) 5? 6? etc. &gt; &gt; What are the
        shortest such sequences? &gt; &gt; I believe there are sequences of
        orders 1..12, certainly. I'm not so &gt; sure about 13; I'm not sure
        there *can* be a sequence of order 13. &gt; &gt; I think 14 exists,
        though, and 15, and 16, but the primes are &gt; problematic. &gt; &gt;
        How high can you go? For instance, what's the order of (UF)? There's no
        element of order p for any prime higher than 11 since the cyclic
        subgroup generated by an element must divide the order of the group by
        Lagrange's theorem and the order of the group is not divisible by any
        prime higher than 11. It's esy to see that the exponent of the group is
        2^4*3^2*5*7*11 so any order would have to divide that. Even so the
        highest order of an element is less than the exponent for this group.

        I don't mean to challenge, cause you're wicked smarter than me ;) but it
        makes sense to me. Coul you explain why those two shouldn't be the same

        rotation of the cube or reflection across the cube, or rotation

        that any combination of a single quarter turn on two separate,

        Yes. What you are referring to is what I call cyclicity in my book. Any
        algorithm will produce an element of RCG (Rubik's Cube Group)/ Certain
        of those elemrnts, when done in suddession on a clean cube, will produce
        the clean cube again. tHE NUMBER OF TIMES THIS IS DONE IS CALLED THE

        There's plenty of people here who started out solving at several minute
        averages. When I joined, I struggled to get under a minute, but now my
        average is 30 seconds. First of all, what method are you using? Your
        cube also needs to be lubricated. See www.speedcubing.com/ton to learn
        how to do that. If you have a method with a First two layers and then a
        last layer, then solve the F2L slowly, make sure to look ahead, then
        speed up at the LL. Hope that makes sense.... --- In

        Hi, welcome to the club. When I joined about 3 months ago I was about
        1:30 now my fastest average is 47.3 and about to change after I got some
        silicone spray for my studio cube. I've been building up beginner tips
        in my head for awhile now and now I think it's time to write them down
        for you. 1) Start with an off-brand cube, don't get a fancy 20$ cube
        yet. 2) Don't put silicone spray, vasoline, or any other lubricant.
        These first 2 steps will force you to slow down and not get ahead of
        yourself, learning to look ahead. 3) Start with a simple layer by layer
        method w/ a 4 step last layer. You can slowly translate that into a 2
        step last layer and a very efficiant first two layers. 4) Learn the bulk
        of the first two layers on your own. That way you will be genuinely
        intutative with your solution. That does not include the last layer
        which you should learn patterns for. 5) Listen to all the more
        expierenced cubers when they give tips ( not just me but everyone) the
        faster that you realize that they REALLY know what their talking about,
        the better off you'll be (this attitude generally arises when you are
        switching to more efficiant methods (ex: "that won't be too much faster
        than my solution right now)) My average number of face moves was about
        130 when I started, now my average is somewhere in the low 50's. 6) 7)
        The most important tip : PRATICE, PRATICE, PRATICE. On you're journey to
        "sub-whatever" you will spend a lot of time looking for tips and ideas.
        That is good to a cirtian extent but eventually you just need to sit
        down and do it. Thanks for listening to my long-winded explination. Here
        are some abreviations in the club that you might not understand:
        F2L-First Two Layers LL-Last Layer OLL- Orientation of Last Layer (used
        in the 2 step last layer solution) PLL- Premutation of the Last Layer (
        " ") The only other thing that I can offer is that you WILL get there.
        And never be afraid to ask. There's no such thing as a stupid question.

        Thanks, I think these tips will be great. I remember when I got my
        average down to 1:30 I thought there was no way I could get it lower. I
        thought one needed to be able to forsee everything, like moves in chess,
        in order to get it lower. I'm not that great at chess, but the cube is
        more predictable than an opponent. I have many cubes already, I started
        out with a new one and didn't use it again after I solved it the first
        time. With learning the F2L, I am going slowly so that I can see and put
        it into my own "words" so to speak. I really think that I will be able
        to get there, eventually. I'll keep plugging away. Here's a question, is

        It's weird, because when you have an average of 1.5 minutes or so, then
        you wonder how anyone could possibly go faster. But then when you get
        around 30 seconds, it's actually difficult to get over a minute! You

        will never really feel like you are better. This is odd to say, but my

        Yeah, that is so true James, and is an important thing to notice. You
        will improve your cubing with practice, and you will tend to find that
        you improve in jumps, it won't necessarily be a gradual process. But the
        number one thing I have learnt in my quest to go faster, is to not try
        too hard. You would think to go fast you need to perform finger tricks
        exceedingly quick, do the moves as fast as you can, rush the LL etc. But
        in fact the opposite is true. If you take your time and relax, your mind
        will function much better, you will be able to concentrate more on the
        cube solution, and less of your brain will be devoted to thinking about
        going fast. When you try to go fast, you will inevitably encounter cube
        lock-ups, even on the best cubes, and these will slow you down
        immensely. So the moral is to go slow if you want to be fast, your
        solutions will be more fluent, and therefore end up being quicker in the
        long run! DanH :) www.cubestation.co.uk ----- Original Message -----

        say, but my cubing feels just the same now as it did when I was cubign
        at 1:30 seconds. You will see what I mean when you are a sub-60 solver

        &gt; OK, just to clarify, what moves are allowed here? &gt;
        U,U',U2,D,D',D2,F,F',F2,B,B',B2,L,L',L2,R,R',R2? That's the complete set

        I have one of these cubes, and I'd say it's not a bad cube in the least.
        I've dropped it twice though and broken 2 middle cubies, but I
        superglued them back together and the cube is buttery smooth. The
        easiest gliding cube (of any size) I own. The stickers on my are kinda

        had help with others. I have devised, by recognizing certain

        it took me 6 days. After that, I just wanted to get quicker. I couldn't

        My cubs, all 495 of them, are nit lubricated, either. I use those cubes
        to create designs. Often, when I was struggling with stiff cubes, I
        wished they could transfered to speedcubing cubes. BTW, I am not a

        &gt; &gt;I currently solve it layer by layer. &gt;1. Top Layer - Edges
        then corners &gt;2. Middle Layer - Edges &gt;3. Bottom layer - Corners
        then edges OK, starting with the first two steps of your current method:
        if you sort of came up with a layer-by-layer method on your own, my
        recommendation is to have a look at Jessica's system. Her F2L system is
        brilliant, although I find it easier to follow the algorithms for this
        part of the solution at www.speedcubing.com then on her own pages. But
        here is a way you can do the F2L much faster and without learning any
        new algorithms. It is a key-hole system that combines part of step 1 and
        step 2 of your current method. To get the feel for it, start with this:
        1. Top Layer - just to the edges (called a Cross) 2. Insert 3 corners
        ONLY 3. Using the free corner (the key-hole) insert 3 Middle edges. You
        will find that this can be done by moving the face with the Cross on it
        around, so that the unsolved corner is underneath (assuming that the
        Cross is now the down face) the spot where you want the
        next-to-be-solved Middle Edge to be, and moving the LL (the up face)
        around so that the edge is next to it. Then you can insert the edge
        using only three moves: if the edge is moving into FR then the moves
        will be either FU'F or RUR'. 4. Insert your last corner 5. Insert your
        last edge using the algorithms that you are doing at the moment for your
        step 2 This will be faster, but you can easily make it faster still,
        again with no extra algorithms, by doing this, which is the key-hole
        solution to the F2L proper: 1. Cross 2. 3 corners and 3 edges -- in any
        order (lots of free slots to start with) 3. last corner 4. last middle
        edge This can go pretty fast, because all the moves are triggers. I
        think that this is a good way to start getting your mind into thinking
        of the F2L the way Jessica's system solves it, too. For the LL, I
        presume you are doing a 4 looks system, corners first, then edges. You
        can speed this up by moving towards a 3 look system, and finally a 2
        look system. LL in two looks can take some time to learn, but moving
        from four looks to three looks is not so bad. This link will help you do
        that, if you so desire:
        http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#method
        Finally: lubricate your cube, using silicon spray. That will take 10
        seconds off, easy. Do it, and you will wonder how you ever coped without
        it. If I try and turn an unlubed cube I feel like my wrists are going to
        break. A lubed cube, keyhole method, and 4-look LL can get you
        sub-minute. But I reckon before long will will want to drop the keyhole
        for F2L proper, aka Jessica's system! Good luck! About 12 months ago my
        personal best time was 82 seconds. I now get lots of times between 20
        and 30 seconds, and even one time of 14.98 seconds, so it is possible.

        It does make sense. I printed the algorithims for the F2L. I am going to

        I was wondering how many moves it generally takes a top cuber to solve
        the cube, i averaged 10 solves and got 54.8 turns per cube (HTM). It is
        really odd looking at my personal stats because it shows just how slow i
        am :( My average times are 30-33ish so that means i am only turning the
        cube 1.5 -2 turns a sec!!! If i staayed at a constent 2 turns a sec,
        then i'd be under 30 sec, if i even turned 3 turns a sec id be under
        20!!! So i guess my big poblem isn't my solution, its my recognition and
        speed! But anyway, sorry for the whole pathway of self discovery, i'd
        like to hear how many turns per cube they make and itd be nice to hear a
        turn per sec ratio too :) Thanks for hearing me out Jake

        how to perform triggers, if you haven't already. It's much easier to
        learn algorithms with triggers already in place then to add them in
        later. If you add them later, you almost need to relearn the algorithm.
        Also, in knowing how to perform triggers, you can remember algorithms as
        sequences of finger tricks, instead of individual moves, making the
        memorization process a little easier. However, for triggers to work, you
        may need to lubricate your cube first; it depends on just how stiff your
        cube really is. Here's my recommendation for anyone that wants to go
        from cube illiterate to "speed cubist": 1) Learn to solve the cube
        (you've done this already!) 2) Lube your cube 3) Learn to perform
        triggers 4) Assuming you learned a layer by layer approach, learn to do
        first layer corners and middle layer edges together. This may mean
        working out your own method of "line up corner &amp; edge" and "insert
        pair" operations, or you can learn algorithms from plenty of different
        sources on the internet. 5) Learn a four look LL - I would recommend
        orienting first in two steps (corners and edges, in either order), and
        then permuting (positioning) everything in two steps)Orient corners then
        edges (or vice versa), then permute (position) corners then edges (or
        vice versa). 6) Learn additional permutation algs to get last layer down
        to 3 looks 7) Learn additional orientation algs to get last layer down
        to 2 looks 8) Practice, practice, practice... I think that most people
        find they waste the most time during their first two layers, even after
        learning all the algorithms. However, I would say don't worry about
        spending too much time on that part of your solution until you've at
        least gotten to a 4 look last layer. Then after stage 5, 6, or 7 in the
        learning process (perhaps after each of them), I'd recommend taking time
        to teach yourself how to minimize pauses during the first two layers by
        really slowing down and looking ahead. The reason I wouldn't recommend
        doing this earlier, though, is partly because you need the moves for the
        F2L to be in your subconscious before you can really start looking ahead
        effectively. I'm currently in stage 7 of the learning process. I guess
        I'm a slow learner, but it'll come eventually. I've been averaging just
        over 30 seconds for a long time now, but I remember when I didn't think
        I could do any better than about a minute and a half. I think if/when I
        finally get all the OLL (orientation) algs into my head, and can perform
        them solidly, I'll be able to shave at least 3-4 seconds off my average.
        Then, I can really concentrate on the F2L.

        I average 1.42 move/sec per solve. I solve the cube in 75 moves. I
        really should shorten that down. When I learn all the PLL cases, I will
        be to 64 moves per solve, solving the cube in 43 seconds (in theory). I
        am very slow in the beginning part of the solve. As I get closer to the
        LL, my speed increases to about 2.5 moves/sec. I believe my final step

        It is a finger trick that makes doing a short series of moves very fast.
        For instance, the move R-U-R' can be done by turning the right face, and
        while still holding it, flipping the up face with the index finger, then
        turning the R face anticlockwise while still holding it from before.
        (toungetwister) Check out:

        30-33ish so that &gt; means i am only turning the cube 1.5 -2 turns a

        30-33 seconds for an average, depending on how good of a day I'm having.
        I too counted 10 solves, and averaged the move counts. I'll start with a
        detailed look at the parts of my solution, and then a summary: Solution
        Phase Moves --------------------- Cross 6.2 F2L - Pair 1 5.9 F2L - Pair
        2 7.4 F2L - Pair 3 7.5 F2L - Pair 4 7.8 OLL - Look 1 8.4 OLL - Look 2
        2.6 PLL 13.1 Or, in summary: F2L 34.8 OLL 11 PLL 13.1 ------------ Total
        58.9 So, it looks like I move just a bit faster than you, but do it less
        efficiently. Note that the "OLL - Look 2" had a very low average move
        count, because I knew how to do 7 of the 10 cases presented in one look.

        About 3 months ago I was averaging 81.83 moves/cube (my LL solution
        sucks): 7.48 moves for the cross 8.8 moves per f2l corner/edge pair (x 4
        = 35.2 for F2L) 5.8 for OLL edges 6.87 for PLL Corners 13.045 for OLL
        Corners 13.438 for PLL edges (39.153 for all LL) So my method is not
        very efficient, but I'm having problems memorizing my new LL algys.
        however with averages around 32-33 seconds, that's about 2.5
        turns/second, which is ok but not wonderful. Those LL algs are a beast

        &gt;BTW, instead of 'cycle' you mean Order or in Hana's terminology,

        "order", in this context. &gt; S. Depends if you're American or not.
        "Period" is used in the USA. &gt; &gt;

        FR) : (R U R') U2 (R U2) (R' U) (F' U' F) If you prefer the cross on the
        left, as I do, then do this (cross on L, flipped edge in UF): (U' R' U)
        (R2 U') (R2 U) (R' F R F') In either case, it's easier to perform with a
        cube rotation before the last 3 (for the first sequence) or 4 moves (for
        the second).

        &gt; Well this may take me some time. Unfortunately, this puzzle is
        really no good unless you are willing to write a program to do it, or
        you are a *much* better mathematician than I am. There are just too many
        possibilities! &gt; For cycle 3 can you get better than this: &gt; U2U
        &gt; Or is a move like that not allowed? &gt; S. Hmm, for me U2U has a
        cycle of 4, since U2U is equivalent to U-. Oh, unless you mean at *any
        point* in the sequence it goes back to solved. Now that's interesting!
        No, I define the order of a sequence s to be the smallest natural number
        i such that (s)i == I. For a cycle of 3, I have a sequence of length 4.
        Anyone care to guess what it might be?

        I'm kind of the opposite of everyone here. I always solve in about 70-80
        moves, but I can do 2.6 moves per second, which is pretty good. Once I
        finish learning the PLL algs and get used to them, I should average
        60-70 moves. That will bring my average down to around 25 seconds. ---

        Well speaking as a top cuber... ;) hehe no, I am a fairly average
        speedcuber, averaging in the mid-twenties now. I have been meaning to
        take such a breakdown of my solutions for a while now, and since you
        asked, I thought what better time to do it but noe. Here is my
        breakdown: Step Number of turns Cross 7.4 F2L 30.5 OLL 9.1 PLL 12.9
        ---------------------------- Total 59.9 I will at this time point out
        that a lot of the OLL and PLL cases were nasty, and so my average times
        would probably have been 1 or 2 sec higher than normal. So, assuming an
        average solve time of 28 secs, my turn/sec is 2.14. This also assumes
        that my solutions are fluent and constant, realistically I would
        estimate that I solve at around 3 turns/sec with pauses in between
        (especially with recognition of the PLL) DanH :) ----- Original Message

        solve the cube, i averaged 10 solves and got 54.8 turns per cube (HTM).
        It is really odd looking at my personal stats because it shows just how
        slow i am :( My average times are 30-33ish so that means i am only
        turning the cube 1.5 -2 turns a sec!!! If i staayed at a constent 2
        turns a sec, then i'd be under 30 sec, if i even turned 3 turns a sec id
        be under 20!!! So i guess my big poblem isn't my solution, its my
        recognition and speed! But anyway, sorry for the whole pathway of self
        discovery, i'd like to hear how many turns per cube they make and itd be
        nice to hear a turn per sec ratio too :) Thanks for hearing me out Jake

        are not finished yet therefore if we start loosing competitors for the

        events, and I'm a little confused about the number of rounds and
        attempts per round. Am I to understand that the first round in the 3x3x3
        blindfold event will have 10 attempts? According to the unofficial
        records, there are only 4 people that could do this in less that an
        hour. Perhaps you could get more participation if the first round was an
        elimination round, with only 1 required attempt, and 1-2 optional,
        additional attempts for contestants who want to try again. Then, you
        could just base it on each person's best time, and keep only people who
        can do it faster than a predetermined time or keep just a preset number
        of contestants. Even later rounds could have just one required attempt
        and be based on best time. For the larger cubes, according to the
        unofficial records, it looks like a single attempt could take at least
        1/2 hour (4x4x4) or 2 1/2 hours (5x5x5) per person! With this amount of
        time put into a single attempt, I would think that this category could
        be based entirely on a single attempt, if the contestant is successful.
        Again, maybe these categories should be just a single attempt per round,
        with later rounds being optional (the contestant could just choose to
        let their existing time stand). These, being extended length events,
        could be compared to a 5k or 10k run - how many times do the runners do
        these in Olympic competition - Once? Twice?

        For instance, if I have the notation of (145)(27638) for my corner
        permutations... I've noticed that when I do a corner-cycle of the first
        three corners in any given set n (in this case, 145), it correctly
        places the last two of the three given. For example, in the (27638) set
        I can do a corner-cycle and it would become (238)(6)(7), but the problem
        is, how do I know which cycle to perform (backward corner cycle or
        forward)? Because the wrong cycle here would yield (26738). How can I
        tell what to use based on this notation?

        That depends on what your disjoint cylce notation for the corners means.
        Does it denote the permutation that was done to the corners in the
        scramble, or the permutation that must be done to fix them? (they are
        the inverse of each other). I memorize the permutation that must be done
        to correct them because I find this more handy in computations: So
        suppose you must do the permuation (16352)(784) on the corners to fix
        them. And seeing as that it's easiest to do cycles of three corners, you
        want to break this large permuation up into smaller steps. As you have
        conveniently noticed, doing the permuation (163) on the cube that's in
        this state correctly places corners 6 and 3, so now you remove these two
        numbers from your initial permuation...you now need to do (152)(784).
        you can just remove those two numbers (6 and 3) because, as you noted,
        those corners are now correct and what needed to go to place 5 has now
        gone from 3 to 1, and now needs to go from 1 to 5....so it's correct to
        just pull out the 3 and 6 from the permutation. Does that make sense?
        And does this answer your question? next I would do (152) and then
        finally the permutation (784) So generally, you can see that any cycle
        can be broken down into a sequence of three cylces, with a possible two
        cycle at the end (if the cylce is of even length then a 2 cycle needs to
        be there for parity). So (123456789) can be writen as
        (123)(145)(167)(189) where operations are done left to right (you do the
        permuation (123) before you do (145)....order here is quite important).
        So in this manner you can break down the entire corner permutation and
        know what steps you're going to do before you close your eyes. I find
        this method quite useful in blindfold cubing but wasn't sure anybody
        else used it. I just searched now and realized that Stiff hand's cube
        page explains this approach, is that where you picked it up at? Most
        people seem to favor Richard Carr's method which is a more 'follow the
        pieces (numbers) in your head' approach, but I choose this method for
        multiple reasons. Good luck, jake E. --- message from kyuubree

        In fact, that on the chat several times it was discussed about the

      <div class="email-content">
        Hello everyone. I have a challenge that some of you might like, all
        centred on the looking ahead part of speedsolving. It might be
        particularly useful for cubists like me, who are in that 25-40 second
        bracket and want to get sub-20 averages. It is a way of FORCING yourself
        to look ahead. To do this you need a metronome: a device that produces a
        regular beat which you can adjust to make faster or slower. Metronome
        numbers represent beats / minute, so 60 = 1 beat / second, 120 = 2 beats
        / second, etc. If you do not have a metronome, their is an excellent one
        online at: www.metronomeonline.com OK here is the challenge. What is the
        fastest metronome setting at which you can regularaly solve the cube as
        per your method, moving the cube STRICTLY -- no exceptions -- at one
        move per click? NB: * Random moves to fill up time are NOT allowed! (so
        no UU'UU' nonsense) * Mistakes / false moves are not allowed, so if you
        do e.g. the wrong F2L sequence the solve is discounted (you can decide
        for yourself how strict you want to be with this) * The absolute final
        step of your solution can be done at normal speed as there is no looking
        ahead left * One-off good times are great but don't count: this is about
        averages, not records This may be harder then you think, because if you
        pause for even a fraction more than one beat, the whole solve does not
        count. So if there is ONE spot where you find yourself slowing down, you
        will need to adjust the metronome setting down to accommodate that speed
        for your whole solve! But then, as that area improves, you can shift the
        speed of the metronome up a notch to a faster speed and try again. This
        is not only good practice for F2L (especially the first slot: must
        prepare for it while solving the cross!) but also for OLL and PLL: these
        are quite tricky because if the metronome is set to e.g. 88 it means
        that the OLL will pass excruciatingly slowly, then you suddenly have
        about 0.68 seconds to recognize which algorithm needs doing for the PLL
        (so again, forcing you to look ahead towards the end of the OLL). I'm
        not saying that this is the be-all and end-all of acquiring good looking
        ahead skills -- far from it!! -- but it is a fun thing to do, and it may
        help some people get faster times, too. But as far as I am aware, this
        is the first suggestion made as to how you can subjectively measure your
        looking ahead abilities (are you adagio, andante, or presto :-)?). It is
        also a way to track your improvement in this fairly crucial part of
        speedsolving (and set goals, if you are that kind of person) If anyone
        gives it a go, I would be interested to know what time you can do, so
        either post them or email me directly. These are my "levels" but I'm
        towards to bottom and they may need adjusting: I started at 48 and can
        now do 60 without too much effort. -48: looking ahead beginner: keep at
        it!! 48-60: learning to look ahead 60-96: getting their ... 96-152: good
        to very good 152-176: pro at anticipating next move 176+ : world
        champion?? Where do you fit in? :-) best, S.

        challenge that some of you might like, all centred on the looking &gt;
        ahead part of speedsolving. It might be particularly useful for cubists
        &gt; like me, who are in that 25-40 second bracket and want to get
        sub-20 &gt; averages. It is a way of FORCING yourself to look ahead.
        &gt; &gt; To do this you need a metronome: a device that produces a
        regular beat which &gt; you can adjust to make faster or slower.
        Metronome numbers represent beats &gt; / minute, so 60 = 1 beat /
        second, 120 = 2 beats / second, etc. &gt; &gt; If you do not have a
        metronome, their is an excellent one online at: &gt;
        www.metronomeonline.com &gt; &gt; OK here is the challenge. &gt; &gt;
        What is the fastest metronome setting at which you can regularaly solve
        the &gt; cube as per your method, moving the cube STRICTLY -- no
        exceptions -- at one &gt; move per click? &gt; &gt; NB: &gt; * Random
        moves to fill up time are NOT allowed! (so no UU'UU' nonsense) &gt; *
        Mistakes / false moves are not allowed, so if you do e.g. the wrong F2L
        &gt; sequence the solve is discounted (you can decide for yourself how
        strict you &gt; want to be with this) &gt; * The absolute final step of
        your solution can be done at normal speed as &gt; there is no looking
        ahead left &gt; * One-off good times are great but don't count: this is
        about averages, not &gt; records &gt; &gt; This may be harder then you
        think, because if you pause for even a fraction &gt; more than one beat,
        the whole solve does not count. So if there is ONE spot &gt; where you
        find yourself slowing down, you will need to adjust the metronome &gt;
        setting down to accommodate that speed for your whole solve! But then,
        as &gt; that area improves, you can shift the speed of the metronome up
        a notch to a &gt; faster speed and try again. &gt; &gt; This is not only
        good practice for F2L (especially the first slot: must &gt; prepare for
        it while solving the cross!) but also for OLL and PLL: these are &gt;
        quite tricky because if the metronome is set to e.g. 88 it means that
        the &gt; OLL will pass excruciatingly slowly, then you suddenly have
        about 0.68 &gt; seconds to recognize which algorithm needs doing for the
        PLL (so again, &gt; forcing you to look ahead towards the end of the
        OLL). &gt; &gt; I'm not saying that this is the be-all and end-all of
        acquiring good looking &gt; ahead skills -- far from it!! -- but it is a
        fun thing to do, and it may &gt; help some people get faster times, too.
        But as far as I am aware, this is &gt; the first suggestion made as to
        how you can subjectively measure your &gt; looking ahead abilities (are
        you adagio, andante, or presto :-)?). It is &gt; also a way to track
        your improvement in this fairly crucial part of &gt; speedsolving (and
        set goals, if you are that kind of person) &gt; &gt; If anyone gives it
        a go, I would be interested to know what time you can do, &gt; so either
        post them or email me directly. These are my "levels" but I'm &gt;
        towards to bottom and they may need adjusting: I started at 48 and can
        now &gt; do 60 without too much effort. &gt; &gt; -48: looking ahead
        beginner: keep at it!! &gt; 48-60: learning to look ahead &gt; 60-96:
        getting their ... &gt; 96-152: good to very good &gt; 152-176: pro at
        anticipating next move &gt; 176+ : world champion?? &gt; &gt; Where do
        you fit in? :-) &gt; &gt; best, &gt; S. &gt; &gt;

        "-48: looking ahead beginner: keep at it!!" category. Extending a 2x2x2
        block to 2x2x3 often requires more than a 1s inspection (locate 3 cubies
        and imagine the optimal sequence). If I split this step, I may get a
        much higher BPM rate. BTW, Metallica's "Disposable Heroes" is my
        favorite metronome ;-) Gilles.

        Hi Simon, &gt; What is the fastest metronome setting at which you can
        regularly solve the &gt; cube as per your method, moving the cube
        STRICTLY -- no exceptions -- at one &gt; move per click? Nice idea! I
        tried http://www.metronomeonline.com a few times, and 120 is a very easy
        beat for me. At that beat I feel veeeeeeery slow DURING a stage. Also
        during F2L it is extremely slow for me. But when going from F2L to OLL
        and also from OLL to PLL, 120 is a normal beat for me. For a faster beat
        than that I sometimes am a little too slow. So I could surely beat 180
        for the first two layers, but for last layer 120 - 140 is probably
        normal because of the pauses in between the stages. But of course I will
        practice this more and see where it ends. Thanks for yet another
        interesting contribution to this club! Have fun, Ron

        you've said that people don't need to pre-register for any events, but
        can instead register when they arrive. Isn't it possible that a large
        number of people will sign up for their events once they get there

        your time while you're looking around for options. I'd be interested to
        hear what other people do here. I'm not sure this strategy works if you
        always pick the same 3 cubies, though. Especially if both edges are in
        awkward positions. If you look at all three options for extending to the
        2x2x3, the good edges are easy to spot. Of course, if I see a corner

        there is no looking ahead left While experimenting with different ways
        of solving the cube, I developed a method that used memorised sequences
        for all but the final step, and then used intuition at the end! That
        meant the final step needed some looking ahead. On the other hand, the
        rest of it required no thought. It was a human version of the
        Thistlethwaite algorithm. I'm sure that if you memorised sequences for
        all final step positions, you could achieve an average of 40 moves
        without any thinking time. How boring! That's one reason why I chucked
        the idea into the bin. If anyone else is interested in it, I'd be glad
        to pass it on to someone else. Maybe someone can achieve 13 seconds
        average with it. Now I'm working on another method that currently uses
        about 42 moves and is intuition based. It is more attractive because it
        requires relatively few algorithms (about the same as the standard
        Fridrich system), and it also gives me the opportunity to think. Now for
        something on topic, I think the metronome idea is great. I wonder if
        someone can break a speed record that way? Ryan

        Often, here's what I do: - find the corner - while looking for the
        corner, 1 of the 2 edges is located - while solving corner + 1st edge,
        locate 2nd edge - solve 2nd edge But, in many situations, it's faster to
        solve the 3 pieces in 1 pass. Because of the number of moves, or because
        you can plan shortcuts. I can't tell you exactly when, it's mostly
        intuitive. 1/2 sec wasted here can be a good decision. Gilles

        everyone else? Frank simonl cube &lt;simonlcube@...&gt; wrote: Hello
        everyone. I have a challenge that some of you might like, all centred on
        the looking ahead part of speedsolving. It might be particularly useful
        for cubists like me, who are in that 25-40 second bracket and want to
        get sub-20 averages. It is a way of FORCING yourself to look ahead. To
        do this you need a metronome: a device that produces a regular beat
        which you can adjust to make faster or slower. Metronome numbers
        represent beats / minute, so 60 = 1 beat / second, 120 = 2 beats /
        second, etc. If you do not have a metronome, their is an excellent one
        online at: www.metronomeonline.com OK here is the challenge. What is the
        fastest metronome setting at which you can regularaly solve the cube as
        per your method, moving the cube STRICTLY -- no exceptions -- at one
        move per click? NB: * Random moves to fill up time are NOT allowed! (so
        no UU'UU' nonsense) * Mistakes / false moves are not allowed, so if you
        do e.g. the wrong F2L sequence the solve is discounted (you can decide
        for yourself how strict you want to be with this) * The absolute final
        step of your solution can be done at normal speed as there is no looking
        ahead left * One-off good times are great but don't count: this is about
        averages, not records This may be harder then you think, because if you
        pause for even a fraction more than one beat, the whole solve does not
        count. So if there is ONE spot where you find yourself slowing down, you
        will need to adjust the metronome setting down to accommodate that speed
        for your whole solve! But then, as that area improves, you can shift the
        speed of the metronome up a notch to a faster speed and try again. This
        is not only good practice for F2L (especially the first slot: must
        prepare for it while solving the cross!) but also for OLL and PLL: these
        are quite tricky because if the metronome is set to e.g. 88 it means
        that the OLL will pass excruciatingly slowly, then you suddenly have
        about 0.68 seconds to recognize which algorithm needs doing for the PLL
        (so again, forcing you to look ahead towards the end of the OLL). I'm
        not saying that this is the be-all and end-all of acquiring good looking
        ahead skills -- far from it!! -- but it is a fun thing to do, and it may
        help some people get faster times, too. But as far as I am aware, this
        is the first suggestion made as to how you can subjectively measure your
        looking ahead abilities (are you adagio, andante, or presto :-)?). It is
        also a way to track your improvement in this fairly crucial part of
        speedsolving (and set goals, if you are that kind of person) If anyone
        gives it a go, I would be interested to know what time you can do, so
        either post them or email me directly. These are my "levels" but I'm
        towards to bottom and they may need adjusting: I started at 48 and can
        now do 60 without too much effort. -48: looking ahead beginner: keep at
        it!! 48-60: learning to look ahead 60-96: getting their ... 96-152: good
        to very good 152-176: pro at anticipating next move 176+ : world
        champion?? Where do you fit in? :-) best, S.

        Sorry I didn't get your question correct the first time. First, do you
        understand what the notation means in terms of a permutation? '(276)'
        means that the corner is place 2 goes to spot 7, the corner in place 7
        goes to place 6, and 6 goes back to 2. With this in mind you move the
        three pieces so they're all in the U face and then decide from there,
        depending on which direction they need to travel, which algorithm you
        are going to use. specifically doing (276), and assuming that we're
        using stiff hands' corner numbering system, I would do the face move F2
        so that 6 and 7 take the place of 4 and 1 respectively. And then I would
        do an algorithm that moves the corners counterclockwise and doesn't
        include the RBU corner. If you have also decided to use stiff hands'
        algorithms then you'd break up (276) into (27)(26) and do each of these
        tranpositions individually. Also, with the situation you mentioned,
        trying to do (26738), you would break this up as (267)(238) and perform
        each of these three cycles individually as explained above. I hope that
        helps --- message from kyuubree &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;

        Been doing the cube for like 2 weeks now, figured I should find a forum
        or something about it and I found this place. I have as of now figured
        out the top and middle layers on my own easy enough, and memorized a few
        simple algorithms for the bottom that have to be repeated alot. I
        figured that those weren't the best since they required tons of moves. I
        went to cubestation.co.uk and used those algorithms, but I still can't
        get my cube down to under 80 turns. I know you guys can do it in like 40
        or 50, but how? I've been doing my best and can't get under 80. I can,
        however, do the cube with the few repeated algorithms in under 2
        minutes, so I think learning these new quicker algorithms will increase
        my time alot. Any help will be appreciated thanks :) By the way, when

        What method are you using? And is your cube oiled? That has a lot to do
        with being able to go fast. I actually average about 70-80 moves too,
        but I can do 30 seconds. And if you want to lower your moves a lot, then
        don't time yourself for a while. For the next 2 weeks or so, just solve
        it slowly, trying to use as few moves as possible. Slowly you will lower
        your average to at most 70 moves. And you need to do the last layer in
        about 2 sequences, three at most. --- In

        The method is cross on top, top corners, middle 4 edges, bottom corners
        (position then orient) then bottom edges (position then orient). Yes my
        cube is lubed. I can do the last layer in usually 2 secquences for the
        corners, and 2 for the edges, which is 4. I haven't learned enough

        1st edge, locate 2nd edge &gt; - solve 2nd edge &gt; &gt; But, in many
        situations, it's faster to solve the 3 pieces in 1 pass. &gt; Because of
        the number of moves, or because you can plan shortcuts. I &gt; can't
        tell you exactly when, it's mostly intuitive. 1/2 sec wasted &gt; here
        can be a good decision. I used to start looking for the corner first,
        but I just found it too difficult (have to recognise its three
        orientations). Maybe if I always picked the same colours it would be
        easier to find the corner. Since I use different colours every time, I
        find it easier to spot edges first. &gt; Note: I always take the same
        colors for this 2x2x3. 17 moves on &gt; average. 7.5 secs. Here is my
        move count for steps 1 and 2, placing the lone edge first for step 2: 4
        + 6 = 10 5 + 7 = 12 7 + 6* = 13 5 + 6 = 11 6 + 6 = 12 Average= 11.6
        moves (*) here I found a corner-edge already joined This wasn't going at
        full speed though, but I did go with the first edge I found. I've never
        counted moves for steps 1 and 2 at top speed because because my step 3
        tends to get mixed in sometimes early, sometimes late (anywhere from
        step 0 to step 5). When I do steps 1-2-3 as a group, I do know that it
        takes 20 moves or less at top speed. Also, I haven't really taken
        average times because I haven't learnt the whole of my method. My best
        ever average was 40 seconds but that was back in 1998 using a different
        method. Ryan

        GameOfDeath2 &gt; Sorry, I didn't realize that my potential non-entering
        of the &gt; championships would cause so much trouble. Since I had been
        mainly &gt; going to go for the computer contest and they were silently
        dropped, &gt; only to be revealed when the new webpage came up, and
        since I &gt; thought the rules (though apparently not yet decided) for
        4x4x4 and &gt; 5x5x5 meant the contest would take too long, I decided
        provisionally &gt; not to enter until the rules were finalized, but this
        has been taken &gt; as a complete withdrawal and - it would seem - the

        rules has tipped &gt; the balance so much. &gt; &gt; Anyway, you seem to
        be very impressive at blindfold cubing. Have you &gt; tried a 4x4x4 yet?
        No, I haven't done a 4x4x4 yet, but I started giving some thoughts to it
        a couple of days ago. I actually registered for it in WC2003, so I guess
        I will have to master it pretty soon... I am really learning a lot from
        your site on 4x4x4. Since I prefer using cycle notation (less planning
        required, I think?), my biggest wall will be in the centers. I'm
        thinking of numbering the faces A-F and showing the permutation in a
        cycle with... it's still not solid, but I hope to be able to establish a
        method that fits me soon. But are you serious about dropping WC &amp;
        giving the cube up all together? I am really shocked... You've given me
        great imspirations with all those great achievements... Sorry I never
        replied to some of your mails... My computer's network has been down for
        a long time now. (this isn't my computer I'm using right now) Macky

        There are two main schools of thought as far as cube methods are
        concerned, Petrus method, and Fridrich method. The algorithms on my site
        www.cubestation.co.uk are designed to be used with the Fridrich First
        Two Layer system, which means that to complete the first two layers,
        rather than making the cross, solving the corners and then solving the
        edges, which takes moves and time, you proceed by solving both the
        Corner AND its adjacent middle layer Edge simultaneously. This obviously
        cuts down the number of moves required, but also requires the
        memorisation of at least 41 algorithms, if you want to experience the
        full benefits of the system for the first two layers. For the last
        layer, the majority of expert cubers use a standard 2-look last layer,
        which is seperated from the first two layers (F2L). The Last Layer is
        broken down into two distinct stages, Orient, then Permute. The reason
        that this method has become so popular is because of the ease of
        recognition of all the cases, which allows you to be able to become very
        fast once you have mastered it. In total however, and this is what may
        put some people off, there are no less than 57 Orientation algorithms,
        and 21 Permutation algorithms, but trust me, once you have had some
        practice and experience with the cube, gained some understanding about
        it, and you have these under your belt, it will seem like a piece of
        cake! Also, it would be a good idea, if you were to have a look at the
        Fridrich method, is to get into the habit of solving the cross on the
        bottom, or on the left, NOW. It is very difficult to get out of a habit
        once you have learned so much that depends on the cross on top! Any
        other help you want, or if you want to chat about the system and discuss
        ideas, please feel free to email me @ dan_j_harris@... or my Yahoo! ID

        cross on top, top corners, middle 4 edges, bottom corners (position then
        orient) then bottom edges (position then orient). Yes my cube is lubed.
        I can do the last layer in usually 2 secquences for the corners, and 2
        for the edges, which is 4. I haven't learned enough algorithms yet.
        Thanks for the advice. I'll keep it at. One of the guys on here is

        If you mean can you scramble it after you solve it, yes. I must admit
        though, it's tougher to scramble (especially to have other people
        scramble it for you) than the rubiks cube. This is mostly because it has
        to be lined up just right before it will turn. But it is a fun puzzle,

        question Hey I know this has probably already been asked, but what is a
        good 5x5x5 brand to get for a speedcube? I have one of the ones form
        puzzletts.com when it was still selling them and it is great, only I
        have abused it for several years so it is about time to get a new one.
        Just curious what brands people use and are happy/not happy with. Chris

        &gt; what is a good 5x5x5 brand to get for a speedcube? Hi Chris. A few
        people directly asked me about 4x4 and 5x5 which I am using. So I think
        this is good timing to post here. 4x4: I use rubiks.com's in my videos.
        But it is stiff when you opened the package and it takes long time to
        make it smooth. (I have never sanded it.) A few months ago I got
        Eastsheen's 4x4. It turns well and siliconization makes big difference.
        It changes in a day! Actually, I set 94 sec in average with Eastsheen
        before I get current record. Personally, I prefer rubiks.com's 4x4.
        Eastsheen's is too small for me, but it is also good alternative. 5x5: I
        also use rubiks.com's 5x5 in my video (mechanically same). I also got
        Eastsheen's 5x5. In regard to turn, it also turns well. But it often
        explodes!! Not just POP. When it happens, half of the parts spread to
        everywhere. I also had Meffert's tiled 5x5. I really don't like tiles. I
        removed all tiles and put new stickers instead. This is mechanically
        same as rubiks.com's 5x5. I unscrewed a little bit. It becomes better,
        but still not as good as my old one. I hope this becomes good speedcube.

        I would have to agree, the bandelow cubes are nice. Mefferts and rubiks
        are pretty much the same, i personally like the tiles from mefferts but
        the mefferts cube explodes a lot on me. I think the eastsheen 5x5 is
        really good for people use to looser cubes, i've never had a pop when i
        use my eastsheen but my friends always pop it, so it just might be a
        question of force there. THe big problem with the eastsheen is that i
        get my fingers tangled up in it cause it is way to small, if they could
        make one with bigger cubies that would be awesome!!! --- In

        Guess what everybody?? Looks like I'm coming to Toronto!! :) Living in
        Canberra, Australia, it wasn't realistic for me to make it to Toronto.
        However, by sheer coincidence, I'm actually going to be travelling to
        Washington DC in August. I'm thinking that if I'm making the huge trip
        from Canberra to DC, then I've really got no excuse not to make the
        (much shorter) trip from DC to Toronto! I haven't registered yet as I've
        not been able to view the 'Competition Rules' link from the Registration
        page (I can see the rest of the site though). DanG, if you're reading
        this, I'll keep trying the site and if I can't get the page I'll send an
        email inquiry to the website (I assume this is what you'd prefer us to
        do). My times are still really bad compared to many of you so I'm not
        expecting to get very far, but I reckon it will be awesome to just be
        involved!! :) BTW, I've been really busy lately and I've got heaps of
        messages to catch up on. The main thing that's been keeping me busy is
        that I've moved house. I'm yet to get my computer set up again and my
        internet connection sorted which means it may take a while for me to
        catch up on the posts. I generally prefer not to do personal 'net stuff
        at work. This post is an exception because I just had to tell you my
        travel news! :) Jasmine.

        EastSheen) haven't given me any problems with falling apart, and are
        anything but stiff. Without lubing them, they are decent, and after a

        I had my cube with me at a party on the weekend. Now that I'm going to
        Toronto, I thought it should get some practice speedcubing in front of
        people. I generally don't get too nervous cubing in front of people
        unless I know that there are other speedcubers around. Even if I do a
        really bad time, to someone who can't even solve a cube, it's still very
        impressive. Anyway, at the party my times were *all over the place*!!
        People were timing me at various points and my times ranged from 42
        seconds to around 80 seconds. I did an average of 10 last night and got
        times from 50-90 seconds, with an average of around 68 seconds. I'm
        thinking that I really need to consolidate. In any cubing session, even
        if brief (say 10 solves) then I can usually get a few times under 60
        seconds, but I also get a few shockers. The fact that I can get under 60
        seconds on a semi-regular basis makes me think that if I just work on
        what I know (ie. not learn any more algs for now) I should be able to
        always get under 60 seconds. I know what my problem is, it's that I lose
        time moving from the cross to the rest of the F2L, and then when moving
        from the F2L to the LL. If I manage to do it all smoothly, then I always
        get under 60 seconds. I guess I'm not really asking for advice since I
        know what the problem is. I also know that the only answer is just to
        practice practice practice!! Just felt like sharing... Jasmine.

        were almost identical to yours (ranging from 50 to 90 seconds). &gt; I
        know what my problem is, it's that I lose time moving from &gt; the
        cross to the rest of the F2L, and then when moving from the F2L &gt; to
        the LL. If I manage to do it all smoothly, then I always get under &gt;
        60 seconds. It might be effective to spend some time working out and
        memorising ways to solve each different case that can come up at each
        step. This does not involve learning any new algorithms, but simply
        memorising how and when to apply them. For example, if you only know one
        algorithm for twisting 3 corners on the last layer at a time, think
        about all the possible ways the corners can be twisted on the last layer
        (there are only 7 ways, and one of them is the solved state), and work
        out beforehand the sequence of algorithms you would apply to solve each
        case. Then practice each case so that next time you see it during a real
        solve, you will be able to solve it automatically. This should reduce or
        even elimate your delays. Another reason for delaying might be when you
        move on to the next step, and you don't remember what you're supposed to
        be doing. Here, you just need to insert a trigger into your memory that
        will fire as you are approaching the end of each step. With some focus,
        you can practice activating that trigger until it becomes routine and
        automatic. For example, as you're approaching the end of the cross, you
        should be remembering to look for a white corner piece on the opposite
        side of the cube (if white's your cross colour). Ryan

        are the stickers from hessport (www.rubikshop.com) any good? these are
        the ones where you pay 4.99 for 3 sets of stickers? i've heard some
        people just paint the cube... does it wear off? what kind of paint do
        you use? where's a good place to buy colored vinyl tape? is it any good
        or does it end up peeling off? i tried buying 6 vinyl-covered notebooks
        in the appropriate colors and i cut up 54 squares and super-glued the
        vinyl squares onto my cube. but... the vinyl is partially transparent,
        so against the cube's black plastic, the colors are not bright at all.
        in fact they are so dull they are hard to recognize unless in bright
        light. so i ruined that cube. i since bought a new hungarian rubik's
        studio cube, but the colors weren't right for me, so i peeled the
        stickers and fixed them. but now the sticker edges are pulling up...

        I put blue enamel from Testors on my cube, obviously to fix the blue
        side. It works great. I just had to take the white stickers off first
        because the paint kept coming off that. I plan to paint my whole cube

        I believe you named all the top solutions to the problem. I personally
        have been using vinly tape for the past few years and love the
        brightness of the cube with them. I purchese an assortmant pack of 5
        colors (all but orange) made by 3M, it's easy to find it at Target or
        Meijers. They last fairly long even with the abuse I give them,
        performing over 200 solves a day, 3 times a week. For orange I looked in
        several hardware shops. My orange ones run about a month after sticking
        them on. For the incredible look, I don't mind having to replace
        stickers every month or so. I would highly recommend against buying the
        rubikshop sets, since they are over priced and last for only 1-2 weeks.
        Paint wouldn't be a bad idea, I havn't tried it but with the right
        paint, would imagine that it would take a lot of time and care to get it
        looking right. Multiple coats of course, with drying time in between. I
        believe Vining uses this approach. Using the plastic off notebooks or
        dividers would probably be my second choice, definatly choose bright and
        thick ones though. Gilles site (http://grrroux.free.fr/me/me.html)
        details this method, and using neoprene glue means that you can still
        take the stickers off easily with a razor blade in the future. This may
        be the best permanent, but not too permenent solution. You say you
        runined that cube, but perhaps with a good razorblade you can that those
        off. I just got a Studio cube recently also, I'll be changing the
        stickers on it soon, before they get destroyed. Some of my screws are
        turning WITH the faces however, and I may need help with this problem.

        Did anyone read the Minh Thai Interview on www.rubikschamps.com ?
        (http://www.rubikschamps.com/interview.html) He states that "My record
        time in the World Competition in Hungary was 22 seconds. It will be very
        difficult, if not physically impossible, to beat this time." I think
        it's a load of crap and that the record will be broken, and with a large
        margin .. but mostly because of the fact that this time the competitors
        will be able to bring their own cubes. I dont want to discredit the
        competitors of the 82 WC because i know that they were very fast, and if
        they had used their own cubes i think the records would be much lower.
        Any comments on this ? Are the best cubers now faster than the best
        cubers were in 82 ? Terje

        yes the screws turned with the faces on my studio cube too. i used super
        glue on the screw threads to fix it. this is what i did to prepare my
        studio cube: 1. new cube, very stiff, totally unusable 2. disassemble
        cube and pop all six middle faces off with razor blade 3. assemble cube
        and tighten all the screws down all the way to make it extremely tight
        4. turn the cube for an hour 5. disassemble cube and wash all the
        plastic bits out with water and assemble entire cube 6. unscrew one
        center and remove the center face so you have a complete cube except the
        hole in one center 7. put a drop of super glue in the screw threads 8.
        reinstall the center: tighten the screw all the way, then back it out
        1.5 turns (or however loose/tight you like it) 9. repeat steps 6 - 8 for
        the other five sides 10. pop an edge and lubricate cube with castle 100%
        silicone spray the cube now turns like butter and the corners don't
        rattle and it rarely pops pieces. now if i could just figure out what to
        do about the stickers! i will probably try buying the vinyl tape. -eric

        The screws on my studio cube loosened up whenever I turned a face
        anticlockwise. To fix the problem, I used medium strengh thread lock
        which is designed exactly for that purpose. At first it didn't work well
        because some of the stuff stuck to the center piece also but I solved
        that problem by turning the cube a little while it was drying. It holds
        very well now. BTW, if you are having trouble keeping the center caps
        on, use silicon rubber sealant stuff. It holds very well but the cap
        will still easily pry off using a finger and the dried silicon will peel
        right off. --The constantly barefoot ¬©H¬Æ√è¬ß --- In

        I generally don't get too nervous cubing in front of people unless I
        &gt; know that there are other speedcubers around. Even if I do a really
        &gt; bad time, to someone who can't even solve a cube, it's still very
        &gt; impressive. Anyway, at the party my times were *all over the
        place*!! &gt; People were timing me at various points and my times
        ranged from 42 &gt; seconds to around 80 seconds. I did an average of 10
        last night and &gt; got times from 50-90 seconds, with an average of
        around 68 seconds. &gt; I'm thinking that I really need to consolidate.
        &gt; &gt; In any cubing session, even if brief (say 10 solves) then I
        can &gt; usually get a few times under 60 seconds, but I also get a few
        &gt; shockers. The fact that I can get under 60 seconds on a semi-
        regular &gt; basis makes me think that if I just work on what I know
        (ie. not &gt; learn any more algs for now) I should be able to always
        get under 60 &gt; seconds. I know what my problem is, it's that I lose
        time moving from &gt; the cross to the rest of the F2L, and then when
        moving from the F2L &gt; to the LL. If I manage to do it all smoothly,
        then I always get under &gt; 60 seconds. &gt; &gt; I guess I'm not
        really asking for advice since I know what the &gt; problem is. I also
        know that the only answer is just to practice &gt; practice practice!!

        what kind of paint should i use for my cube if i just want to paint it,

        center piece also but I solved that problem by turning the cube a little
        while it was drying. It holds very well now. BTW, if you are having
        trouble keeping the center caps on, use silicon rubber sealant stuff. It
        holds very well but the cap will still easily pry off using a finger and
        the dried silicon will peel right off. --The constantly barefoot ÔøΩHÔøΩœß

        Hi Guys, The basic basic problems with most cubes: 1. Stickers wear out
        easily, 2. The center caps are hard to get off, 3. The center cubies
        unscrew or tighten up, 4. The cubes pop pieces alot, 5. Lack of contrast
        between blue and green that they sometimes get mixed up. 6. The plastic
        is weak and thin and not very slick. All four of these problems were
        addressed by Ideal in 1980. The solutions were: 1. Stickers were
        replaced by plastic tiles, 2. There are no caps; the screws are
        underneath the tiles which are easy to pry off and easily reglued. 3.
        There is a small washer on the head of the screw, 4. They went back to
        the original design which is having a center cubie which is ached
        underneath. When you open your cube and remove one layer you should see
        a circle. If it's flat under the center cubie it's not a circle so the
        edge pieces can derail and pop out easily, 5. Green was made much
        brighter, 6. The plastic was 3 or 4 times as thick, and slicker. In 1981
        was often beating 25 seconds with no lubrication. The solution was
        applied to the Deluxe cube in 1980, and in the Rubik's Game cube, from
        1982, which is a Deluxe with little peg holes in the center of the
        tiles. These are excellent cubes. They come up fairly regularly on ebay.
        There is a "deluxe" that is made now but I don't know if it is at all
        like the original. David J --- In

        wrote: &gt; I believe you named all the top solutions to the problem. I
        &gt; personally have been using vinly tape for the past few years and
        &gt; love the brightness of the cube with them. I purchese an assortmant
        &gt; pack of 5 colors (all but orange) made by 3M, it's easy to find it
        &gt; at Target or Meijers. They last fairly long even with the abuse I
        &gt; give them, performing over 200 solves a day, 3 times a week. For
        &gt; orange I looked in several hardware shops. My orange ones run about
        &gt; a month after sticking them on. For the incredible look, I don't
        &gt; mind having to replace stickers every month or so. &gt; &gt; I
        would highly recommend against buying the rubikshop sets, since &gt;
        they are over priced and last for only 1-2 weeks. Paint wouldn't be &gt;
        a bad idea, I havn't tried it but with the right paint, would &gt;
        imagine that it would take a lot of time and care to get it looking &gt;
        right. Multiple coats of course, with drying time in between. I &gt;
        believe Vining uses this approach. Using the plastic off notebooks &gt;
        or dividers would probably be my second choice, definatly choose &gt;
        bright and thick ones though. Gilles site &gt;
        (http://grrroux.free.fr/me/me.html) &gt; details this method, and using
        neoprene glue means that you can &gt; still take the stickers off easily
        with a razor blade in the future. &gt; This may be the best permanent,
        but not too permenent solution. &gt; &gt; You say you runined that cube,
        but perhaps with a good razorblade &gt; you can that those off. I just

        over the old timers is the Internet. I had to discover pretty much every
        algorithm myself. Others were more in contact with other cubers, but
        even so someone had to discover everything by hand, and tell others
        about it either in person or possibly by mail. Today you can find all
        the algorithms you could possibly need online. And they're known to be
        perfect. The game today is mostly to learn to do a method real fast, not
        to develop a good method as it was much more back then. -- "They say the

        don't get too nervous cubing in front of people unless I &gt; know that
        there are other speedcubers around. Even if I do a really &gt; bad time,
        to someone who can't even solve a cube, it's still very &gt; impressive.
        Anyway, at the party my times were *all over the place*!! &gt; People
        were timing me at various points and my times ranged from 42 &gt;
        seconds to around 80 seconds. I did an average of 10 last night and &gt;
        got times from 50-90 seconds, with an average of around 68 seconds. &gt;
        I'm thinking that I really need to consolidate. &gt; &gt; In any cubing
        session, even if brief (say 10 solves) then I can &gt; usually get a few
        times under 60 seconds, but I also get a few &gt; shockers. The fact
        that I can get under 60 seconds on a semi- regular &gt; basis makes me
        think that if I just work on what I know (ie. not &gt; learn any more
        algs for now) I should be able to always get under 60 &gt; seconds. I
        know what my problem is, it's that I lose time moving from &gt; the
        cross to the rest of the F2L, and then when moving from the F2L &gt; to
        the LL. If I manage to do it all smoothly, then I always get under &gt;
        60 seconds. &gt; &gt; I guess I'm not really asking for advice since I
        know what the &gt; problem is. I also know that the only answer is just
        to practice &gt; practice practice!! Just felt like sharing... &gt; &gt;

        Yeah.. thats a good point. On stage anything can happen. someone like me

        possible, its gonna be super tough but possible! If i knew that i was
        averaging 16-17 sec solves, i'd consider myself as totally owning the
        competition, but once you factor that you KNOW that you can achieve
        these times, means that you may PUSH yourself to achieve those times,
        and end up totally screwing up an alg, popping, or dropping the cube, or
        get a 23 sec time and barely beat the record. BUT i don't average 16-17

        impressive. Anyway, at the party my times were *all over the &gt;
        place*!! &gt; &gt; People were timing me at various points and my times
        ranged from &gt; 42 &gt; &gt; seconds to around 80 seconds. I did an
        average of 10 last night &gt; and &gt; &gt; got times from 50-90
        seconds, with an average of around 68 &gt; seconds. &gt; &gt; I'm
        thinking that I really need to consolidate. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any
        cubing session, even if brief (say 10 solves) then I can &gt; &gt;
        usually get a few times under 60 seconds, but I also get a few &gt; &gt;
        shockers. The fact that I can get under 60 seconds on a semi- &gt;
        regular &gt; &gt; basis makes me think that if I just work on what I
        know (ie. not &gt; &gt; learn any more algs for now) I should be able to
        always get under &gt; 60 &gt; &gt; seconds. I know what my problem is,
        it's that I lose time moving &gt; from &gt; &gt; the cross to the rest
        of the F2L, and then when moving from the &gt; F2L &gt; &gt; to the LL.
        If I manage to do it all smoothly, then I always get &gt; under &gt;
        &gt; 60 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I'm not really asking for
        advice since I know what the &gt; &gt; problem is. I also know that the
        only answer is just to practice &gt; &gt; practice practice!! Just felt
        like sharing... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jasmine.

        Try leaving an edge piece as the last one to put in. You should be able
        to put one side of the edge in the hole and then push hard to get the

        If you turn the side where your last edge piece is missing 1/8 turn, it
        will pop in much easier .. if you dont do this you might break the
        senter axis. Terje &gt; &gt; Try leaving an edge piece as the last one

        probably compete considering I live in Rhode &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Island
        which isn't to far away. I won't come close to winning but &gt; &gt; I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want a free t-shrit :) It's good to know I wont be

        practice speedcubing &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front of
        people. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I generally
        don't get too nervous cubing in front of people &gt; &gt; &gt; unless
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know that there are other
        speedcubers around. Even if I do a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; bad time, to someone who can't even solve a cube, it's
        still &gt; &gt; very &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impressive. Anyway, at the
        party my times were *all over the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place*!! &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; People were timing me at various points and my times
        ranged &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 42 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        seconds to around 80 seconds. I did an average of 10 last night &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got times from 50-90
        seconds, with an average of around 68 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm thinking that I really need to consolidate. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any cubing session, even
        if brief (say 10 solves) then I can &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usually get
        a few times under 60 seconds, but I also get a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; shockers. The fact that I can get under 60 seconds on a semi- &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; regular &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basis makes me think
        that if I just work on what I know (ie. &gt; &gt; not &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; learn any more algs for now) I should be able to always get
        &gt; &gt; under &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 60 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds.
        I know what my problem is, it's that I lose time &gt; &gt; moving &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cross to the rest of
        the F2L, and then when moving from the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; to the LL. If I manage to do it all smoothly, then I
        always get &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 60
        seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I'm
        not really asking for advice since I know what the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; problem is. I also know that the only answer is just to &gt; &gt;
        practice &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice practice!! Just felt like
        sharing... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jasmine.

        Hi everyone. So now my dream has finally come true =)Today I broke the
        world record on the 3x3x3 cube with an avg of 16.5 seconds. I have been
        on vacation for two weeks and I didn't really cube much during. And when
        I got back home I lubed my cube (terrible before) and then I suddenly
        made very fast times! My style of solving the cube is a little bit of
        risktaking I suppose. I don't solve the cube as smooth as many other
        people, and I solve it "faster" when it comes to "going slowly". What I
        mean is that I don't really try to go slowly, just really concentrate on
        finding the next pair and still do all the F2L algs quite fast.
        Sometimes I can get an avg of up to 18 seconds. This happens when I am
        either tired or unfocused (which leads to bad looking ahead in the F2L
        and pauses between algs). But on the other hand when I am really
        concentrated I make very fast times since I have no pauses but still
        many face moves per second. Here were my times: (13) 15 17 14 18 18 15
        17 15 16 (19) 15 =&gt; 16.0 + 0.5 No bad times, and that's more
        important than to make a few fast ones. I will try to make another (and
        much better) video of me solving the cube maybe in two weeks. My old one
        is dowmnloadable at:
        http://web.holmstroms.com/skogshyddan/david_kuben.zip It's not a very
        good quality nor solve, but it's the only one I got. As you can see I
        had bad recognition in the F2L, but anyway it was a descent time in
        front of people. I have no Rubik's cube home site if anyone wonders. At
        last: What is a reasonable limit for speedcubing? I would say that it's
        not impossible to brake 16 seconds in the future (although it would
        require a LOT of training and most of all learning more algs. I
        challenge you other guys to keep on practising until we reach the dream
        limit 16 seconds (for me it is). And enjoy the speedcubing! It's a lot
        of fun =) David Wesley

        own algs. I only look at the times, and they are really good. Congrats

        works! :-D I will put the zipped source code there some time. In the

        Yeah, as I was writing my previous post I was thinking that some people
        probably do have old cubes that are so loose that they could put in a
        corner piece last. However, I just assumed that anyone initially
        attempted to restore a cube this way is probably new to cubing and
        therefore likely to have a fairly stiff cube. :) Jasmine. --- In

        Impressive .. i guess we have a new favorite for the WC, and Ron &amp;
        co needs to start training hard , but you better watch out, because Adam
        is also improving fast :) I dont think 16 sec is an impossible limit,
        and maybe even 15 could be broken. the cube community is still very
        small, and with a larger numbers of "players" the number of very
        talented will also increase, and the times will drop. if there had been
        only like 1000 ppl running the 100 meters in the entire world, i dont

        F2L algs quite fast. &gt; Sometimes I can get an avg of up to 18
        seconds. This happens when I &gt; am either tired or unfocused (which
        leads to bad looking ahead in &gt; the F2L and pauses between algs). But
        on the other hand when I am &gt; really concentrated I make very fast
        times since I have no pauses &gt; but still many face moves per second.
        &gt; &gt; Here were my times: &gt; (13) 15 17 14 18 18 15 17 15 16 (19)
        15 =&gt; 16.0 + 0.5 &gt; No bad times, and that's more important than to
        make a few fast ones. &gt; &gt; I will try to make another (and much
        better) video of me solving the &gt; cube maybe in two weeks. My old one
        is dowmnloadable at: &gt;
        http://web.holmstroms.com/skogshyddan/david_kuben.zip &gt; It's not a
        very good quality nor solve, but it's the only one I got. &gt; As you
        can see I had bad recognition in the F2L, but anyway it was a &gt;
        descent time in front of people. &gt; I have no Rubik's cube home site
        if anyone wonders. &gt; &gt; At last: What is a reasonable limit for
        speedcubing? I would say &gt; that it's not impossible to brake 16
        seconds in the future (although &gt; it would require a LOT of training
        and most of all learning more &gt; algs. I challenge you other guys to
        keep on practising until we &gt; reach the dream limit 16 seconds (for
        me it is). And enjoy the &gt; speedcubing! It's a lot of fun =) &gt;

        &gt; &gt; I dont think 16 sec is an impossible limit, and maybe even 15
        could be &gt; broken. the cube community is still very small, and with a
        larger numbers of &gt; "players" the number of very talented will also
        increase, and the times will &gt; drop. &gt; &gt; if there had been only
        like 1000 ppl running the 100 meters in the entire &gt; world, i dont
        think the world record would be 9.79 :) &gt; &gt; Terje I forgot talking
        about the limit of speedcubing. With JESSICA's method, I would say the
        limit is around 15, not much less, I'm sure it's sub 16. But if someone
        found a new method, averaging let's say 40 moves (why not???), it might
        be possible to get some 13 seconds averages (at about 3 moves per
        second). So we can't guess the limit of speedcubing, but we can imagine
        it must be 15-16 (maybe sub15 terje?), with the current methods. /Adam

        I just read the article on that Andy Camann 14 year old kid who can
        solve th cube consistantly under 20 sec. Good for Andy!!! But does he
        have any videos or website or anything? One thing that kind of bugged me
        is that they claim he is a genius for being able to do that. I don't
        believe that. You don't need to be smart to solve a cube, none the less
        fast. You just need a good memory and some skill. Another thing that
        really bugged me is that the Doctor guy said that it is all Right
        brained! I'm no doctor so correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't one half
        used to memorize a string of data, and the other side recognizes
        patterns. Even though the two are almost the same, they are considered
        different ways of thinking and the 2 are split between the 2
        hemispheres? I'll have to dig up my old psychology book, but i'm pretty

        I'm no good at psychology, so can't say anything about that, but if Andy

        Speedcubing is, shall we say, the oldest discipline in the Rubik's cube
        kingdom, but there are others, that yet need to be developed. I knew,
        that when they featured Andy, people will comment. The younger set,
        those whose age is less than or equal to 14 years, will complain: "Now
        wny am I not featured? I am at least as good, if not better, than Andy."

        Which side of the brain... Well, to me I believe the right brain takes
        over. Just like when one drives a car. If the left-brain was in control
        of "speed cubing," it would not be very fast. The left brain is way too
        slow. The right brain will see the situation and quickly react. I would
        assume that when we start with cubing, we first use the left brain (or
        even for fewest moves). Once we get better, the right brain figures out
        how to do it faster. James Sibley --------- "My mother never saw the

        I am interested to know the average length of some of the algorithms
        listed on speedcubing.com. I will use this to compare different
        strategies. Particularly, I'd like to know about: 1. the algorithms that
        place the last F2L pair simultaneously with orienting the LL edges
        (also, how many cases are there?) 2. the algorithms that orient and
        place the LL corners without affecting the orientation of the LL edges.
        Ron, do you know these figures? It would be preferable to know the
        average length weighted by probability since that is more accurate, but
        otherwise I would still be interested to know the average algorithm
        length. Also for (1), between 0.5 to 0.75 of the time an alignment move
        needs to be inserted before doing the algorithm. I don't mind if it's
        excluded since I can add 0.75 onto the overall figure for a good
        estimate. Thanks, Ryan

        considering two methods for the LL where edges are already oriented:
        method 1: orient/permute corners = 9.78 moves permute edges = 8.75 moves
        align = 0.75 moves TOTAL = 19.28 method 2 (Petrich): orient corners =
        6.29 moves permute edges/corners = 11.21 moves align = 0.75 moves TOTAL
        = 18.25 So, the Petrich method uses fewer moves and fewer algorithms.

        lots of folks who have great memories who don't understand what they've
        memorised. As to whether one need to be smart to solve a cube, you need
        to make a distinction between the different ways of "solving" the cube,
        i.e. figuring it out yourself or following someone else's directions.
        Figuring it out yourself does take a modicum of brain cells. This is not
        to say that starting from memorized facts someone cannot grasp the
        material, but this is why I encourage people to figure it out
        themselves, at least initially. You're also right about the both the
        left and right brain being involved with solving the cube. David J

        Over the past few years, I have been exploring new ways of solving the
        cube. I pretty much stopped speed cubing during this period, and just
        continued experimenting until I found a system I was willing to commit
        to. This is not it, but Ron suggested that I describe it to you all
        anyway. I have a habit of only revealing the systems that I have no
        intention of using (for instance, "tripod"). After all, I don't want to
        give my competitors the advantage :-) As I said, this system requires no
        thinking. All solutions to all cases can be memorised and applied, with
        an end result of maybe 13 seconds average. Maybe someone is interested
        in doing that. Personally, I find it hard to call that puzzle solving -
        it's more like running the 100 metres. (btw, I am not competing in this
        year's championships so people have suggested that I reveal the system I
        actually use- I agree. Stay tuned.) ----- Forwarded message from Ryan

        Corners (between 1 and 2 algs) - Edges (between 1 and 4 algs) Phase 4
        -&gt; place pieces - Corners (intuitive) - Edges (intuitive) DETAILS OF
        STEPS * PHASE 1 This is solved in 4.6 moves on average. * PHASE 2 EDGES
        This is rather simple. You can learn all 20-30 cases if you wish. I
        forget the exact number. This can be solved in an average of 4 moves. *
        PHASE 2 CORNERS I used a method similar to Gaetan - first get 3 corners
        oriented on one side, and then apply one of 8 algorithms. It is possible
        to directly learn all 60 cases if you want (I can't remember the exact
        number). I think they have an average of 8.5 moves. * PHASE 3 CORNERS In
        phase 3, it is important to do the corners first, because it is
        difficult to see whether they have made it into the U2D2L2R2F2B2 group.
        Just getting opposite colours on each side isn't enough. The algorithms
        you learn to fix this are shorter when you don't have to worry about the
        edges. Here, I'll just describe the simplest technique that requires two
        algorithms, but is very quick for the fingers and brain: First, separate
        up/down colours (one colour on each side). Average 3.2 moves. There
        should be, for example, all red corners on top, and all orange corners
        on bottom. Now, pairs of adjacent corners will either match or mismatch.
        Our goal is to make them either all match, or all mismatch. So, in this
        step, we find the odd pairs out (whether they're matching or
        mismatching), and fix them so they match/mismatch like all the rest.
        There are 4 pairs. Either one pair is the odd one out, or two pairs are
        the odd ones out. For one pair: hold the pair at UF, and do R'FR'B2RF'R.
        It's a modification of the corner mover that doesn't care about the
        exact positions of corners. Two pairs: hold two pairs on F (you may need
        to move them there), and do R2UF2U2R2U. (if you needed to move them
        there first, there's also a trick to get it to work...) I looked for a
        long time to find other methods here that used fewer moves. I found
        some, but this way was definitely by far the quickest to perform. PHASE
        3 EDGES 4 cases - simple (2,4,6 or 8 bad edges). Average 6.1 moves.
        Total moves so far: 33.4. Obviously, fewer moves are necessary to
        achieve an average of 40 moves overall. I worked out some shortcuts, but
        I don't think they're worth it, because I could perform the longer way
        faster. PHASE 4 (the end game) I think you already have a strategy for
        this. Corners, then edges. I think it's possible to learn all cases for
        the edges (about 150 I think, but easy to memorise). A downside is the
        number of double turns which are more difficult to perform. But I tried
        a few algorithms and they are possible to do quickly enough. I think the
        main benefit of this method is fast reaction time and no thinking.
        Another benefit is that it looks cool when you solve it. None of the
        pieces are placed until the very end. Above, I listed each individual
        step with no shortcuts. It is possible to combine steps, or do steps in
        different orders depending on opportunities. The basic method above, if
        you learnt all cases for each exact step, should give an average of 45.7
        moves. Ryan ----- End forwarded message ----- Just a note I'd like to
        add: it is not necessary to stick to only moves within each group. For
        example, in phase 4, it is not necessary to stick to double turns. In
        fact, the shortest solutions for most cases involve single turns. The
        first half (phases 1-2) already has a lot of freedom of movement. I
        suppose it could be solved in 5 to 6 seconds. Maybe someone has a better
        way to finish phases 3-4? For example, one idea is to first get all red
        on top, and all orange on bottom, then permute. Another idea is to build
        up blocks like Fridrich and Petrus (more intuitive). Ryan

        This is another idea I had a while ago. It similar to the Petrus idea of
        orienting edges early so that you only need to turn two sides. Instead,
        we orient all edges right at the beginning, create a "line" on the D
        side from front to back (or a cross if you wish), then we only need to
        turn three sides to solve the rest of the cube (L, U, R). This also
        means you don't ever need to rotate the cube. To see what I mean, have a
        look at this video by AdaM:
        http://borntodie.free.fr/videos/solvedin16.avi Either by plan or by
        chance, all of your F2L edges must have been oriented after your first
        few opening moves. We can deduce this because after that you only used
        L,U,R turns to solve the rest of the F2L. On the other hand, not all of
        your LL edges were oriented. I have to say seeing you solve the cube
        without rotating it looks pretty cool. Note, it only takes 4.6 moves on
        average to orient all edges at the beginning, and maybe you can combine
        this with placing parts of the "line" or "cross". (Ok, the next email
        will be about my system) Ryan

        Here is a description of my system. The basic idea is, rather than to
        leave the last layer until last, to work on the last layer while doing
        the first two layers (F2L). This makes it possible to "understand" what
        you're doing to the cube right up until close to the very end. Only the
        last 4 pieces require the assistance of mysterious algorithms. The
        design of the stages requires very few algorithms yet gives very short
        solutions. I will explain by modifying the Petrus method (since I first
        realised how to make this work last year with the Petrus method). Step 4
        involves completing a 2x3 slice of the F2L, usually built in two parts:
        a 2x2 square (a corner and two edges) and a 2x1 rectangle (a corner and
        edge). The second section takes (corner/edge) about 7 moves to build.
        But if you only insert the edge, it only takes 2 moves average (when you
        blend this into the building of the previous section). This is a
        relatively cheap move, but puts the cube into a position that has 1/8th
        the number of permutations reduced by symmetries (1/4 because the U side
        can be turned independently of the edge, and 1/2 because the edge is
        correctly placed and the orientations of the edges are considered valid
        from twice as many angles). So now what can we do with that? Because the
        edges are already oriented, and because edges are generally more mobile
        than corners, it becomes extremely easy to recognise and manipulate the
        positions of the edges. We re-shuffle the LL edges while inserting the
        last F2L corner, as it is very easy to manipulate the edges in different
        ways as the corner is going in. There are in fact only 17 unique
        permutations of these 5 pieces (one is the solved state, so really 16),
        and they can be solved in an average of 8.5 moves. This average includes
        the alignment moves. After that, there are only 4 pieces left on the
        cube unsolved, and they take 12.5 moves on average to solve, including
        alignment moves (40 or 50 algorithms depending on whether you count
        inverses as unique). When compared with the original, inserting the last
        corner/edge pair of the F2L takes 3.5 moves longer, but it also solves
        half of the last layer in the process! So, the idea originated with the
        Petrus method, but what I actually use now is quite a bit different,
        especially in the opening steps. However, everything is the same from
        inserting the corner simultaneously with the last layer edges, to the
        end. Here are the other aspects of my system: - I start with a 2x2x2
        block, but from there, I start building whatever I see. One path is to
        extend to a 2x2x3, but I have practiced several other alternative paths
        and pick whichever way jumps out at me. Here I avoid searching for
        pieces. - If nothing jumps out at me for each step, I have a fallback
        strategy so that I don't have to waste time searching. It works like
        this: basically I have learnt to orient edges at any stage throughout my
        solution. When I can't find anything to do at any particular stage, I
        just orient the edges, and then re-examine the situation. This
        orientation is definitely not wasted moves, and wherever I do it, it
        always gives around the same solution length. - I also learnt how to
        orient edges while doing the normal routine of building blocks. This
        means I can orient an edge here, and another one there, along the way
        (if it's worth it). My "normal" sequence is as follows: step 1: form any
        2x2x2 block step 2: form any 2x2x1 block (preferrably attached to step
        1) step 3: form any 2x2x1 block (limited by step 2 choice) step 4:
        insert last F2L edge and orient remaining edges step 5: insert last F2L
        corner and re-shuffle LL edges step 6: place LL corners (refer to
        previous email for move count) If in step 2, I don't see anything, I do
        some orientation. If in step 3, I don't see anything, I do some
        orientation. If I end up doing orientation early, I end up with a
        modified Petrus step 4 (as I described at the top of this email). Ryan

        Very interesting method! It's very similar to the Petrus method but you
        flip the edges 1 step after he does; although of course you seem to be

        wrote: &gt; Here is a description of my system. &gt; &gt; The basic idea
        is, rather than to leave the last layer until last, to &gt; work on the
        last layer while doing the first two layers (F2L). This &gt; makes it
        possible to "understand" what you're doing to the cube right up &gt;
        until close to the very end. Only the last 4 pieces require the &gt;
        assistance of mysterious algorithms. The design of the stages requires
        &gt; very few algorithms yet gives very short solutions. &gt; &gt; I
        will explain by modifying the Petrus method (since I first realised &gt;
        how to make this work last year with the Petrus method). Step 4 involves
        &gt; completing a 2x3 slice of the F2L, usually built in two parts: a
        2x2 &gt; square (a corner and two edges) and a 2x1 rectangle (a corner
        and edge). &gt; &gt; The second section takes (corner/edge) about 7
        moves to build. But if &gt; you only insert the edge, it only takes 2
        moves average (when you blend &gt; this into the building of the
        previous section). &gt; &gt; This is a relatively cheap move, but puts
        the cube into a position that &gt; has 1/8th the number of permutations
        reduced by symmetries (1/4 because &gt; the U side can be turned
        independently of the edge, and 1/2 because the &gt; edge is correctly
        placed and the orientations of the edges are &gt; considered valid from
        twice as many angles). &gt; &gt; So now what can we do with that? &gt;
        &gt; Because the edges are already oriented, and because edges are
        generally &gt; more mobile than corners, it becomes extremely easy to
        recognise and &gt; manipulate the positions of the edges. We re-shuffle
        the LL edges while &gt; inserting the last F2L corner, as it is very
        easy to manipulate the &gt; edges in different ways as the corner is
        going in. There are in fact &gt; only 17 unique permutations of these 5
        pieces (one is the solved state, &gt; so really 16), and they can be
        solved in an average of 8.5 moves. This &gt; average includes the
        alignment moves. &gt; &gt; After that, there are only 4 pieces left on
        the cube unsolved, and they &gt; take 12.5 moves on average to solve,
        including alignment moves (40 or 50 &gt; algorithms depending on whether
        you count inverses as unique). &gt; &gt; When compared with the
        original, inserting the last corner/edge pair of &gt; the F2L takes 3.5
        moves longer, but it also solves half of the last &gt; layer in the
        process! &gt; &gt; So, the idea originated with the Petrus method, but

        alternative paths and pick whichever way jumps out at me. Here I &gt;
        avoid searching for pieces. &gt; - If nothing jumps out at me for each
        step, I have a fallback strategy &gt; so that I don't have to waste time

        http://borntodie.free.fr/videos/solvedin16.avi &gt; &gt; Either by plan

        your first few opening moves. We can deduce this because &gt; after that
        you only used L,U,R turns to solve the rest of the F2L. On &gt; the

        seeing you solve the cube without rotating it looks pretty cool. &gt;
        &gt; Note, it only takes 4.6 moves on average to orient all edges at the

        If you wanted to, you could learn algorithms to insert the corner with
        the edge while orienting the LL edges (8.2 moves), then reshuffle the LL
        edges separately (6.3) moves. That would actually take slightly more
        moves on average: 14.5 instead of 14.4 (it takes me 5.9 moves to insert
        the last F2L edge and orient the LL edges, and 8.5 moves to insert the
        last F2L corner and reshuffle the LL edges). It is not much of a
        difference in terms of moves. But there is a HUGE difference in the
        number of algorithms required. There are 124 (symmetry reduced)
        algorithms to learn for inserting the last F2L corner/edge and
        simultaneously orienting LL edges, plus two more to reshuffle edges. For
        my method, there are only 16 algorithms to learn and that includes
        reshuffling the edges. Because orientation is done at a much easier
        time, no algorithms are required for that. It is very easy to insert the
        last F2L edge while orienting the LL edges, because you are just
        focusing on edges and you don't have to worry about destroying the
        corner. To compare different approaches: f2l+edge ori(8.2) + edges(6.3)
        + corners(12.48) = 26.98 (167 algs) redges(5.9) + corn+edges(8.5) +
        corners(12.48) = 26.88 (57 algs) f2l+edge ori(8.2) + ll(12.83) = 21.03
        (300 algs) f2l+edge ori means insert last f2l pair and orient LL edges.
        redges (ryan's edges) means insert f2l edge and orient LL edges. The
        only way I know to beat my number of moves is to learn 300 algorithms.
        Note, all these figures are symmetry reduced (they're the only figures I
        have). I do know that the 300 increases by more than 100 algorithms if
        you treat inverses as distinct, but my 57 increases only by about 10. In
        my system, I spread the last layer work over (at the least) 3 steps, and
        so I also distribute the memorised sequences over 3 steps. Another
        advantage of this is that all of the cases come up more frequently and I
        can practice them more often. If all cases are concentrated into one or
        two steps, that means you might forget how to do rare cases, or when
        they come up you might take some time to access algorithms from your
        memory. I'd imagine with doing the LL in one step (with edges already
        oriented) that some cases would only occur once a week even if you cubed
        a lot. Maybe it is even less frequent (I'll leave someone else to figure
        that out exactly). Ryan

        to know what algorithms you use for your step &gt; 5. The simplest one
        is RUR'. The next simplest one is FR'F'R. Another one is RU'R'F'U'F.
        They average 5.9 moves and are pretty easy to work out. &gt; or after
        learning his method? Also, what times have you been getting &gt; with
        this, and what do you believe is the limit of your method? Oh, &gt; and
        just curious, why arn't you going to the WC? I am only just starting to
        practice speed cubing again now. For the past few years I haven't
        practiced at all. I guess I'm under a minute :-) It will be interesting
        to see whether this system can work in speed cubing. You realise,
        though, that it is possible to apply the second half of my system to
        most other openings other people use. For example, it is possible to use
        this with the fridrich system as well as the petrus system. Those have
        already been proven to give sub-20 times. I think the number of moves is
        a limiting factor in how fast people get. Sure, it may take more
        "thinking" to get fewer moves, but what alternative is there? It is just
        a matter of training your mind to be able to think more quickly. I think
        that's possible. Note that the 300 algorithm system uses fewer moves
        than mine, so maybe that will lead to more amazing times than mine.
        However, I still have a few improvements I plan to make - it is still in
        development. I definitely don't plan to learn 300 algorithms (my memory
        is not that big), but there are other ways to economise on moves. I
        believe the key is to work on the last layer simultaneously with the
        first two layers. Ryan

        I found your post interesting, but I'd have to disagree with one thing
        in particular: "The pint is, that this frenzied chase after averages and
        timers rather spoils the fun, don't you think?" First of all, I wouldn't
        consider it a frenzied chase; I'd like to consider it as working towards
        a goal. Working toward a goal in speedcubing doesn't spoil the fun, it
        creates it! There is nothing more exhilarating than reaching a goal that
        you have set for yourself. "A frenzied chase" makes it sound barbaric
        and purely competetive. I'm very competetive with one person: Myself.
        And your frame of mind is what seperates you from speed cubists, not
        your times. I think someone who averages 3 minutes can consider
        themselves a speedcubist, depending on their attitude. Take you for
        example, your times are around 5 minutes avg. Everyone was there once,
        (or is still there) but your thought is "someone has to be the slowest".
        If you have accepted this frame of mind than maybe it's better that you
        only do cube art. Anyway, I'm done typing almost. I'm sorry if you found
        this reply to be offensive in any way, shape, or form. -Richard ---

        I agree with the definition, but I do not solve the cube for speed. As a
        cube artist using the cube as art medium, I MUST be able to solve it. In
        order to use judicious twiddling to construct patterns, your cube must
        be silved. If I went to my neighbors and qsked trhem to please solve the
        cube for me, they would tell me to get lost. It us also very easy to
        mess up the cube in the twiddling process. If that happens, the cube
        myst be re-solved. Make no mistake - cube artists must also be cubists.

        Althought with a completely different intention, this lack of stickers
        reminds me of one of my inventions. Well, not really an invention, just
        used an old idea when I was to lazy to finish stickering a cube for my
        friend. It had the minimum number of stickers possible to still maintain
        the uniquness of each of the 4.3 quntillion positions. This is the
        challenge, who thinks they can solve this problem. So I finished it just
        in time to mention it as an interesting aspect of the cube during a
        little lecture I was giving at my university on group theory of the
        cube. I only briefly mentioned it, and at the end some grad students
        couldn't take their hands off it. One, claiming to be able to solve one,
        even drew diagrams to figure out the irregular color scheme I used, lol.
        (A professor questioned whether it would be EASIER, but I said that
        instead of getting stickers to where you want them, you would be trying
        to get stickers out of a certain face.) Has anyone else out there
        envisioned or created such a cube? -Doug --- In

        inventions. Well, not really an &gt; invention, just used an old idea
        when I was to lazy to finish &gt; stickering a cube for my friend. &gt;
        &gt; It had the minimum number of stickers possible to still maintain
        &gt; the uniquness of each of the 4.3 quntillion positions. This is the
        &gt; challenge, who thinks they can solve this problem. I never did this
        intentionally, but when I originally got my megaminx, tiles would
        occasionally fall off, and I wouldn't put them back on right away. I
        could still solve it, as long as no two pieces looked the same (e.g. two
        edges from the same face lost their other color). That said, I would
        expect that out of a total of 3x3x6=54 stickers, you would need only 31,
        if I figured it right. Here's my thinking: -Two adjacent center stickers
        (e.g.. D&amp;F) can set the cube's orientation (-4) -One color can be
        completely replaced by "unstickered" (U = up = unstickered for
        simplicity) (-8) -Corners opposite U only need the D color, and one of
        the other stickers (-4) -One of the D corners only needs the D color,
        position being defined by the other D corners (-1) -Edges opposite U
        need the D color, but 1 can do without the other sticker (-1) -One of
        the U corners can be left completely unstickered because position and
        orientation are defined by the rest of the corners (-2) -The U corner
        diagonally opposite the unstickered corner needs only one sticker (-1)
        -One of the U edges can be left completely unstickered, being set by the
        other edges (-1) -One of the middle layer edges on the same face as the
        completely unstickered edge can go without it's other color (e.g. If UF
        is without stickers, FR can lose its R sticker, or FL can lose it's L
        sticker) (-1) 54-4-8-4-1-1-2-1-1-1 = 54 - 23 = 31 Is this the number you
        came up with?

        unique solved state for the cube. If you are allowed to have multiple
        solved states, then each piece merely needs to be unique. In this case
        you need just 26 stickers: - 6 edges have 1 sticker (one of each color)
        - 5 edges have 2 stickers (all unique pairings) - 1 edge is unstickered
        - 6 corners have 1 sticker (one of each color) - 1 corner has 2 stickers
        - 1 corner is unstickered - 2 centers have stickers 6*1 + 5*2 + 6*1 +
        1*2 + 2*1 = 6 + 10 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 26 This will still offer 43 quintillion
        unique configurations, but there will be multiple possible solved
        states. Here's a new puzzle for you - given a cube with 26 stickers, how
        many different ways can it be solved? I don't know, but it would
        probably depend on the configuration of the stickers.

        It's also humorous, but I'd have to disagree with you again...First of
        all, you wrote this: &gt; The goal you are striving for - getting your
        name &gt; into Guinness - is too hard for most of you. My goal has never
        been to get into Guinness. And I think it's safe to say that's not the
        goal of the majority of speedcubists. &gt; Trouble is, that only the
        fastest is the winner. Once again, the ultimate goal is not to be
        extremely competetive and beat everyone. &gt; Suppose that you make a
        spectacularly short &gt; average, and smeone from the boondocks beat you
        to &gt; it by fraction of a second? I wouldn't be bitter about it. I
        would probably invite them to dinner with some fellow cubers to discuss
        methods or something. &gt; You will be frustrated and angry. I know I
        would. I wouldn't be frustrated and angry...but you probably would be.
        &gt; Cube art is a new duscipline on the Rubik's cube &gt;
        spectrum.There are very few of us in the world &gt; today. You're right,
        cube art is on the rubik's spectrum. But it's so far away from
        speedcubing that its almost astonishing. I wouldn't neccessarily call it
        a new discipline, because I've seen cube art. It's not complicated at
        all. I believe there are few cube artists because its too simple. (but
        thats what i believe not everyone else) I'm confident that if i had 500
        extra cubes sitting around I could replicate any cube art I've seen so
        far. &gt; But if you think cube artists don't have to be able &gt; to
        manipulate the cube, then think again! You &gt; can only use
        conventional twiddling to achieve &gt; those pieces, that is, if you use
        the cube as art &gt; medium. If you think about it, people who only know
        how to scramble a cube are capable of manipulating it. The cube is an
        interesting thing to use as an art medium. Some people make art with
        mashed potatoes. &gt; No, I don't feel offended by your reply. I

        I think I'd probably put the mark at a few minutes (maybe 2-3 minutes?)
        to be called a speedcuber. Don't know what I'm basing this on, it was
        just what popped into my head when I read the post. Maybe I'm thinking
        this because (in my mind) the maximum time it would take someone to
        solve the cube if they were using an inefficient method and going fast
        enough to show that they have a some knowledge of speedcubing, but not
        the sort of speed attained when algs have embedded themself into the
        subconscious or when fingertricks are applied. So, if we imagine someone
        using a layer-by-layer-by-layer method with a 4-6 look LL (as opposed
        to, say, a cross/F2L/LL method with a 2 look LL), it would often take
        120+ turns. FYI, I'm basing this on figures from an inefficient method
        that I learnt years ago. If they were turning at an average of, say,
        around 0.75 turns/sec, this would take 160 seconds, ie. between 2-3
        minutes. On the point of 'going for speed'. It's clearly a factor, but
        if someone was working on getting their times from 1 hr down to 1/2 hr,
        I wouldn't think them worthy of the title 'speedcuber'! Maybe they are
        just a 'cuber'? Or 'speed-cuber-in-training'? :) Here are some
        thoughts... BTW, I just made up these titles, but you probably get the
        idea: SpeedCubingGod: can regularly solve in 15-20 seconds
        UberSuperSpeedCuber: can regularly solve in 20-30 seconds
        SuperSpeedCuber: can regularly solve in 30-45 seconds SpeedCuber (1st
        class): can regularly solve in 45-60 seconds SpeedCuber (2nd class): can
        regularly solve in 1-2 minutes SpeedCuber (3rd class): can regularly
        solve in 2-3 minutes Cuber: can regularly solve in 3-10 minutes
        Cuber-in-training: can regularly solve in 10-30 minutes TryhardCuber:
        those people who claim that they can solve it but it takes them a day or
        two. I'm skeptical of these people. I kinda think that if you can do it,
        then you can do it in minutes (even if 30 minutes). I hope I haven't
        just offended anyone!!! :/ Geez, I really rambled on there didn't I??

        I remember a few years back, i found a cube at a friends house (first
        time i had seen one since 83), and tried to see if i could still solve
        it. i got the first 2 layers, and after some fiddling i managed the top
        edges, but i had troubles with the corners. after some more fiddling i
        found an algo that rotated 3 corners. since one of my edge moving algos
        flipped one or more corners, in theory i could complete the cube by a
        combination of those algos. I didnt bother writing down the algos to
        figure out what combinations i had to make to get it complete, but just
        sat there for a while doing those algos until it was solved. i tried it
        again a few days later and made it again after a while. i think this
        would qualify as someone that can solve the cube, but it might take a
        long time. i didnt try the cube again until this spring. Terje
        TryhardCuber: those people who claim that they can solve it but it &gt;
        takes them a day or two. I'm skeptical of these people. I kinda think
        &gt; that if you can do it, then you can do it in minutes (even if 30
        &gt; minutes). I hope I haven't just offended anyone!!! :/ &gt; &gt;
        Geez, I really rambled on there didn't I?? &gt; &gt; Jasmine.

        I take it you consider cube art as something less than speed cubing,
        where those Bohemians think that, by slapping a Rubik's cube on paper,
        they have created a first-class cube art masterpiece. Nothing could be
        more false. Because it is a new discipline, there are really no rules as
        to what constitutes cube art. Read about it in rubikschamps.com, what I
        define as cube art. It is a form that uses Rubik's cube as art medium. I
        repeat, ART MEDIUM. That means the art pieces are made from Rubik's
        cubes. Therefore, to manipulate the cube means more, than just
        scrambling it. In terms of 3d cube art you have to: ¬ï Solve it ¬ñ and that
        means solve it completely. You `paint' patterns on each solved cube by
        judicious twiddling. If the cube is not solved, you have a problem. If
        your neighbor is a speed cubist, you can ask him for help. However, I am
        not fortunate enough to have such a neighbor. As I need to learn
        judicious twiddling anyway, I might as well learn how to solve the cube.
        End of justification. ¬ï Do judicious twiddling ¬ñ you speed cubists use it
        all the time, except you call it F2L,LL, etc, etc.All that speed aside,
        basically what you are doing is to get the identity element of the
        Rubik's cube group. Once I get that element I use certain prescribed
        sequences to get another symmetric element ¬ñ a pattern on the cube that
        will participate in a design. ¬ï Use parity pairs and parity-pair induced
        design symmetries- what? You have never herd of them? No mention is made
        of those pairs n speed cubing, but they are extremely important in 3d
        designs. You see, you deal only with one cube, but this property applies
        to two cubes, a pair. If you come to Toronto and condescend to stop by
        my exhibit, I will tell you what that is. ¬ï Use color control just to
        make sure the cubes color- synchronize properly, a part of judicious
        twiddling. ¬ï Fractals is just a sub problem of the design problem, will
        speak about it, if you are interested. What do you think now? Is this
        more or less complicated than speed cubing? THAT is what will be
        presented in Toronto. May I ask you a favor? You said that you saw some
        cube art. Based on that, you evidently came to your conclusions. What
        type of art did you see? Could you produce a website of that art? I to,
        saw a few pieces. The one, which left me in stitches, was a picture of a
        guy holding 4 cubes with a letter on each cube. The message was SHIT.
        That is roughly equivalent to putting a DO NOT DISTURB message on your
        door and calling it art. I would hope I am doing somewhat better than
        that. Hana a kostky --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I completely agree with your figures for the centers and edges. I don't
        know about the corners, but your probably correct. I am still trying to
        figure out if it works, since it is different from what I concluded. It
        is kind of hard to visualize what my cube looks like with out certain
        stickers. However, I believe we're under different criteria. I had two
        additional criteria (that are most likely mutually dependent on each
        other) that I thought was assumed, but am now proven wrong. First, I did
        want a unique solved position, which is equivalent to saying that the
        stickering scheme FORCES a certain, predetermined color scheme.
        Secondly, it shouldn't have more then one solved postion (to address the
        other possibility in your other post). I think the two are probably
        equivalent conditions since they are so inter-related. That second post
        does pose and gives rise to an EXTREMELY difficult challenge - How many
        "solved" positions are there for a given 26 stickering with the broader
        criteria? Which 26 stickering(s) maximizes/minimizes this number?. So
        what I am left to determine is whether your 31 solution forces a color
        scheme. It is only the corners I care about now, but you don't
        explicitly specify how many edges are fully stickered. Form this I can
        determine how much adjacency is already forced. -Doug (waiting for the

        &gt; -Two adjacent center stickers (e.g.. D&amp;F) can set the cube's
        &gt; orientation (-4) &gt; -One color can be completely replaced by
        "unstickered" (U = up = &gt; unstickered for simplicity) (-8) &gt;
        -Corners opposite U only need the D color, and one of the other &gt;
        stickers (-4) &gt; -One of the D corners only needs the D color,
        position being defined &gt; by the other D corners (-1) &gt; -Edges
        opposite U need the D color, but 1 can do without the other &gt; sticker
        (-1) &gt; -One of the U corners can be left completely unstickered
        because &gt; position and orientation are defined by the rest of the
        corners (- 2) &gt; -The U corner diagonally opposite the unstickered
        corner needs only &gt; one sticker (-1) &gt; -One of the U edges can be
        left completely unstickered, being set by &gt; the other edges (-1) &gt;
        -One of the middle layer edges on the same face as the completely &gt;
        unstickered edge can go without it's other color (e.g. If UF is &gt;
        without stickers, FR can lose its R sticker, or FL can lose it's L &gt;
        sticker) (-1) &gt; &gt; 54-4-8-4-1-1-2-1-1-1 = 54 - 23 = 31 &gt; &gt; Is

        those that started during the rage), when I was first able to solve the
        cube consistatly (I don't remember my randomly solving phase lasting for
        longer then 1 week), I was able to obtain sub-2min times with no more
        then ten simple algorithms, poor dexterity, and no outside
        resources/help (till maybe 1:20). Perhaps, it was my recognition that
        allowed for these good 'beginner' times, reaction times that eventually
        got me to where my times are today. Then again, many would agree:
        recognition is developed through practice. So someone who is not
        achieving under the 2min mark and wants to be a speedcubist is probably
        lacking in one of these attributes (that may or maynot be under their
        control): dexterity, recognition, memory, memory recall, or most likely
        lack of motivation and/or practice. (I am having some joint problems
        myself currently; somehow I got that idea that since I 'can' solve over
        1,000 cubes in one day, I should do it. Advice, don't do something just
        because you can, lol.) Also, what do you suppose would qualify as a
        blindfold cubist? I am getting to around 40% of doing this feat, is that
        enought for me to use this title? Again, this is up to ones opinion.
        -Doug P.S. some people think I don't post enough, so I will be rambling
        on from time to time and perhaps contribute something occasionally
        P.S.S. the metronome thing was a big failure on my part, one turn for
        each tick even at 50 beats/min is too much for me, but I can still
        regularly solve in about 22s. I suppose I solve in bursts, 8 to be
        exact. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, jasmine_ellen

        few minutes (maybe 2-3 &gt; minutes?) to be called a speedcuber. Don't
        know what I'm basing this &gt; on, it was just what popped into my head
        when I read the post. Maybe &gt; I'm thinking this because (in my mind)
        the maximum time it would take &gt; someone to solve the cube if they
        were using an inefficient method &gt; and going fast enough to show that
        they have a some knowledge of &gt; speedcubing, but not the sort of
        speed attained when algs have &gt; embedded themself into the
        subconscious or when fingertricks are &gt; applied. &gt; &gt; So, if we
        imagine someone using a layer-by-layer-by-layer method with &gt; a 4-6
        look LL (as opposed to, say, a cross/F2L/LL method with a 2 &gt; look
        LL), it would often take 120+ turns. FYI, I'm basing this on &gt;
        figures from an inefficient method that I learnt years ago. If they &gt;
        were turning at an average of, say, around 0.75 turns/sec, this would
        &gt; take 160 seconds, ie. between 2-3 minutes. &gt; &gt; On the point
        of 'going for speed'. It's clearly a factor, but if &gt; someone was
        working on getting their times from 1 hr down to 1/2 hr, &gt; I wouldn't
        think them worthy of the title 'speedcuber'! Maybe they &gt; are just a
        'cuber'? Or 'speed-cuber-in-training'? :) &gt; &gt; Here are some
        thoughts... BTW, I just made up these titles, but you &gt; probably get
        the idea: &gt; &gt; SpeedCubingGod: can regularly solve in 15-20 seconds
        &gt; UberSuperSpeedCuber: can regularly solve in 20-30 seconds &gt;
        SuperSpeedCuber: can regularly solve in 30-45 seconds &gt; SpeedCuber
        (1st class): can regularly solve in 45-60 seconds &gt; SpeedCuber (2nd
        class): can regularly solve in 1-2 minutes &gt; SpeedCuber (3rd class):
        can regularly solve in 2-3 minutes &gt; Cuber: can regularly solve in
        3-10 minutes &gt; Cuber-in-training: can regularly solve in 10-30
        minutes &gt; TryhardCuber: those people who claim that they can solve it
        but it &gt; takes them a day or two. I'm skeptical of these people. I
        kinda think &gt; that if you can do it, then you can do it in minutes
        (even if 30 &gt; minutes). I hope I haven't just offended anyone!!! :/
        &gt; &gt; Geez, I really rambled on there didn't I?? &gt; &gt; Jasmine.

        Hi James, Okay, for this contest, there are competitions... You DON'T
        have to compete in each one, it's just a variety of things to keep it
        interesting. The first 4 are always permenant, but the fifth changes
        every wednesday. 1) HandiCap 2) Most moves a minute 3) To solve any cube
        in the largest number of people 4) One hand-frenzy **5)** The weekly
        contest, which changes every week (every wednesday of course). People
        get ranked by the point system explained on the site. I hope this makes
        sense :) If you have any other problems let me know! ;) Brent :) --Brent

        discussion. There was also another concern that I expressed. Since
        rubikschamps.com is a commercial entity, there is no guarantee that we
        will not have to subscribe to marketing in the future. Can you guarantee
        this? I noticed I must join the Rubik's Club in order to have my
        unofficial record appear on this new records list. Surely we need only
        be a member of our own community to post a record to our own record
        list. I don't see the Rubik's Club as having necessary part of this.
        Isn't commercial interest sneaking its way into our community records
        list? Does Rubik's Club want to advertise their latest commercial
        offerings to us? You might try to convince me that the Rubik's Club is a
        good thing so I should not argue about joining it. But let's do things
        the proper way and let people join the Rubik's Club only if they want
        to. And more importantly, let's preserve our community. Let's maintain
        the feeling it has always had by keeping commercial interests separate
        from it. Thanks, Ryan PS. I'm not against commercial entities. I may
        even join Rubik's Club. But I think that the commercial side should be
        run separately from the community side.

        it's not as though they are suppressing our rights or anything. Look at
        it from the company's point of view. So what if they throw a few extra

        for joining this community &gt; discussion. &gt; &gt; There was also
        another concern that I expressed. &gt; Since rubikschamps.com &gt; is a
        commercial entity, there is no guarantee that &gt; we will not have to
        &gt; subscribe to marketing in the future. Can you &gt; guarantee this?
        &gt; &gt; I noticed I must join the Rubik's Club in order to &gt; have
        my unofficial &gt; record appear on this new records list. Surely we
        &gt; need only be a member &gt; of our own community to post a record to
        our own &gt; record list. I don't &gt; see the Rubik's Club as having
        necessary part of &gt; this. Isn't commercial &gt; interest sneaking its
        way into our community records &gt; list? Does Rubik's &gt; Club want to
        advertise their latest commercial &gt; offerings to us? &gt; &gt; You
        might try to convince me that the Rubik's Club &gt; is a good thing so I
        &gt; should not argue about joining it. But let's do &gt; things the
        proper way &gt; and let people join the Rubik's Club only if they &gt;
        want to. And more &gt; importantly, let's preserve our community. Let's
        &gt; maintain the feeling it &gt; has always had by keeping commercial
        interests &gt; separate from it. &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; &gt; Ryan &gt;
        &gt; PS. I'm not against commercial entities. I may even &gt; join
        Rubik's Club. &gt; But I think that the commercial side should be run
        &gt; separately from the &gt; community side. &gt;

        You're right. We have the right to maintain our own records list, no
        matter how hard that might be. &gt; I may be out of my league on this
        &gt; one but i think we're making a big deal out of &gt; something very
        small. Ok, I might be alone on this. I will not be posting records on
        rubikschamp.com, but I understand that other people will not have a
        problem signing up with rubiks.com first. I am disappointed that there
        is no alternative to rubikschamps.com, though. Ryan

        Hi Dan, Sure it is not a good think to have two record site. But the
        Record pages is not only for 3x3x3 Rubik's Cubes. Are you sure
        rubikschamps.com is willing to post ALL the records even if it is not a

        I updated my puzzle page just now. I don't usually announce it here, but
        I think this one might be of interest to you. The main highlight is a
        Rubik's Cube Java Applet. Yes, another one. This one is very different
        to any others you may have seen, as it includes a Kociemba solver, a
        choice of viewing modes, and a choice of subgroups with optimal solvers.
        Check it out. Jaap http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles Full list of
        changes: UPDATED 06/07/2003. Added Cubie, a new Rubik's Cube Java
        Applet. New pages about the Circle Puzzle, Rotos, and the Zauberkreuz.
        Expanded the Lights Out pages with more info on the Deluxe, the theory
        of lit- only games and toggle games, as well as solutions. Added
        JavaScript for the Circle Puzzle, Zauberkreuz, and Rotos. Added
        dreamball, puzzle head, K8 ball and Octo to pocket cube page and Rubik's
        World to cube page.

        new records list. Surely we need only be a member &gt; of our own

        Rubik's Club as having necessary part of this. Isn't commercial &gt;
        interest sneaking its way into our community records list? Does Rubik's
        &gt; Club want to advertise their latest commercial offerings to us?
        &gt; &gt; You might try to convince me that the Rubik's Club is a good
        thing so I &gt; should not argue about joining it. But let's do things
        the proper way &gt; and let people join the Rubik's Club only if they
        want to. And more &gt; importantly, let's preserve our community. Let's
        maintain the feeling it &gt; has always had by keeping commercial
        interests separate from it. &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; &gt; Ryan &gt; &gt;
        PS. I'm not against commercial entities. I may even join Rubik's Club.

        All, please be advised that i have no involvement with the content on
        Rubiks.com other than the wc2003 championships. Its all the sponsors
        doing. not mine..... As to the records lists. I suspect Ron will keep
        his records list on the speedcubing.com site but I am not 100 percent
        sure.Let wait til he returns before assuming... We can have as many
        lists as we want. Please dont worry about the legalities on the
        rubikschamps site. If you all have privacy issues etc like myself then
        hey, dont submit any records then....easy as that.... But after reading
        all the comments on this forum about the rubiks champs site, please by
        all means send your voices and opinions to the respective folks on
        rubikschamps....If they dont see your concerns then nothing will
        happen... each part of rubiks champs has a person who answers certain
        types of questions... if its regarding the rules for the event then i
        get the email...if its for the record list then patrick hess gets the
        email...if your concern is about privacy then Dave Jones from Seventowns
        gets the email...etc etc What we did with the rubiks champs is created a
        forum for you all to voice your concerns so by all means send them in to
        rubikschamps....we also have implemented many items to "protect" the
        rubiks name hence all the privacy items and legalities imposed on the
        site... This way you get heard by more than just myself.....you now have
        all the sponsors(licensee's and licensor) listening(BUT PLEASE KEEP IT
        PROFESSIONAL). I guess the biggest thing i have read on this forum is
        the privacy issues which i have brought forth to Seventowns as I
        personally have issues with that...All in all, Its their product and we
        all have to abide by certain standards and rules etc that they want to
        implement... What we all are able to do now it voice our concerns for
        change....Which took be 3 years to set the platform for you all to step
        up with your issues. Now that its all in place lets use it to our
        advantage. I personally dont like the fact that they want the right to
        use my name and personal info to their advantage without compensation or
        royalty for myself.... Its all issues i am fighting for us all on ......
        But we can all be happy because in 6 weeks wc2003 will be reality and i
        can now say we are doing this all again in 2005 with myself stepping
        away from this organiser role(which i never want to do again) and coming
        back into competitor mode where i belong.. danG chief wc2003 --- In

        Minh Thai recently had an an interview with rubikschamps.com. Read it;
        the bottom line is he is not coming to Toronto to compete. Too busy with
        work and family, he says. Erno Rubik is still alive, but, according to
        the sponsors, he does not want tio be pestered by people. I would like
        to ask him, if he knows anybody, who creates 3d designs. Nobody else
        seems to know. :-( Hana a kostky --- In

        On the Rubikschamps.com site: What is Minh Thai up to these days? Well,
        RUBIKS.COM found out through an interview via email that he is still
        cubing away. However, he states that the time of 22.95 seconds "will be
        very difficult, if not physically impossible to beat" as part of his
        responses to a variety of questions asked by RUBIKS.COM. Won't he be
        feeling a bit annoyed when Jessica or Ron or someone beats 22.95 by
        nearly ten seconds, and get's a 15 second time? LOL I don't understand
        how he could possibly think that 22.95 seconds would be hard to beat. By
        the way, I finally beat his record (22.95) yesterday. It made me feel
        happy inside. Now I only need to get a sub-20 time, and I'll feel much
        better. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Dan"

        I'm assuming that the Championship will be on TV, but does anyone know
        what television station will air it? I think it was NBC last time. On
        www.rubikschamps.com, it has a list of a few shows that will have
        something about it. There is a game show called Unusual Gaming Events,
        and two others are going to make a documentary on the entire history of
        the Rubiks Cube and include things about the current championships. If
        it was on Ripley's Believe it or Not, that would be really cool. They've
        had things like this before.

        clarification!!! the film documentary that is being produced has no
        involvement with the championships and it is not about the history of
        the cube...FYI... the documentary is about 1 man's adventure bringing
        the world most famous puzzle back to life and one groups adventure in
        the search for god's algortyhm. the gaming show company you read about
        is there to shoot the event for an upcoming unusual gaming show out in
        LA. The finale will be webcasted and filmed however only the web cast
        will be "live" and that of tv stattions wishing to film.. but it will
        not be on tv the same time as the event... danG chief --- In

        fully stickered edges on one face, and 3 fully stickered edges in the
        adjacent layer. Of the remaining 6 edges, 5 would have 1 sticker, and 1
        would be blank. 6 * 2 + 5 * 1 + 0 = 12 + 5 = 17 stickers for the edges.
        For the corners, you would have 3 on one face with two stickers, the
        last one on that face needing only the color of that face. The opposing
        face would have 2 corners with 2 stickers, 1 with 1 sticker, and 1 with

        Yes, but you must know the cube's color scheme.If you know the color of
        two adjacent stickers, that tells you thr opposite colors, which fixes
        fout colors out of the six. The remaining pair wil,l come on the third

        edges are fully stickered. Form &gt; &gt; this I can determine how much
        adjacency is already forced. &gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure my original
        answer of 31 stickers did force a &gt; certain, predetermined color
        scheme, except that one color was not &gt; provided (entire face was not
        stickered). I could see that you might &gt; have to be careful in which
        stickers you put on each of the &gt; corners/edges to make sure this is
        the case. Assuming the color &gt; scheme is set, then the solution would
        have only one solved position. &gt; &gt; For the solution I provided,
        there would be 3 fully stickered edges &gt; on one face, and 3 fully
        stickered edges in the adjacent layer. Of &gt; the remaining 6 edges, 5
        would have 1 sticker, and 1 would be blank. &gt; 6 * 2 + 5 * 1 + 0 = 12
        + 5 = 17 stickers for the edges. &gt; &gt; For the corners, you would
        have 3 on one face with two stickers, the &gt; last one on that face
        needing only the color of that face. The &gt; opposing face would have 2
        corners with 2 stickers, 1 with 1 sticker, &gt; and 1 with none. 5 * 2 +
        2 * 1 + 0 = 10 + 2 = 12 stickers for the &gt; corners. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        set, but that the cube orientation was set based on two adjacent centers
        - BOY/BOW cubes are not the same, but both can be determined in the same
        way, assuming that other pieces on the cube also have stickers. If you
        remove all the stickers from the center pieces, any center could be U (6
        possibilities) and any center adjacent to that could be F (4
        possibilities), leaving 6*4 = 24 possible cube orientations. Putting a
        sticker on one of the centers restricts the rest of the face to that
        same color, but leaves four possibilities for the surrounding faces. By
        finally adding a sticker to one of the four adjacent faces, the cube
        orientation is set and the colors of the rest of the faces can be
        deduced through inspection of the other pieces (corners and edges) on
        the cube.

        tired of how you always add something about the "cube art" in all your

        &gt; &gt; However, I believe we're under different &gt; &gt; &gt;
        criteria. I had two &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; additional criteria &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; [snip] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what I am left to
        determine is whether your &gt; &gt; &gt; 31 solution &gt; &gt; &gt;
        forces a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; color scheme. It is only the corners I
        care &gt; &gt; &gt; about now, but you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't
        explicitly specify how many edges are &gt; &gt; &gt; fully stickered.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Form &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this I can determine how
        much adjacency is &gt; &gt; &gt; already forced. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure my original answer of 31 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; stickers did force a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain, predetermined
        color scheme, except that &gt; &gt; &gt; one color was &gt; &gt; &gt;
        not &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provided (entire face was not stickered). I &gt;
        &gt; &gt; could see that you &gt; &gt; &gt; might &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        have to be careful in which stickers you put on &gt; &gt; &gt; each of
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corners/edges to make sure this is the case.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Assuming the color &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scheme is set,
        then the solution would have only &gt; &gt; &gt; one solved &gt; &gt;
        &gt; position. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the solution
        I provided, there would be 3 &gt; &gt; &gt; fully stickered &gt; &gt;
        &gt; edges &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on one face, and 3 fully stickered edges
        in the &gt; &gt; &gt; adjacent layer. &gt; &gt; &gt; Of &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; the remaining 6 edges, 5 would have 1 sticker, &gt; &gt; &gt; and 1
        would be &gt; &gt; &gt; blank. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6 * 2 + 5 * 1 + 0 =
        12 + 5 = 17 stickers for the &gt; &gt; &gt; edges. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the corners, you would have 3 on one face &gt;
        &gt; &gt; with two stickers, &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last
        one on that face needing only the color of &gt; &gt; &gt; that face. The
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposing face would have 2 corners with 2 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; stickers, 1 with 1 &gt; &gt; &gt; sticker, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and
        1 with none. 5 * 2 + 2 * 1 + 0 = 10 + 2 = &gt; &gt; &gt; 12 stickers for
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        cube, the relationship between the cube and science, cube art,
        algorithms for solving the cube in the fewest moves, and yes, even speed
        cubing. (Only cube religion is missing from this list, yet it is the one
        that everybody worships!) Since there is no cube-lovers mailing list at
        the moment, those people interested in mathematics, cube art, and
        solving the cube in the fewest moves, have had no choice but to join
        this community here. I also wonder whether our discussions would be as
        interesting if those people left. Personally, I am interested in all
        topics relating to the cube if they can increase my understanding of the
        cube. Really, in the end, a better understanding of the cube may help
        you in speed cubing. Ryan

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what I am left to determine is whether your
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 31 solution &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; color scheme. It is only the corners I care &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; about now, but you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't
        explicitly specify how many edges are &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fully
        stickered. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Form &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this I
        can determine how much adjacency is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already forced.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure my
        original answer of 31 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers did force a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; certain, predetermined color scheme, except that &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; one color was &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; provided (entire face was not stickered). I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        could see that you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        have to be careful in which stickers you put on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each
        of the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corners/edges to make sure this is the
        case. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Assuming the color &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        scheme is set, then the solution would have only &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one
        solved &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; For the solution I provided, there would be 3 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; fully stickered &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edges &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; on one face, and 3 fully stickered edges in the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        adjacent layer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        remaining 6 edges, 5 would have 1 sticker, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and 1
        would be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blank. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6 * 2 + 5 *
        1 + 0 = 12 + 5 = 17 stickers for the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edges. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the corners, you would
        have 3 on one face &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with two stickers, &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last one on that face needing only the
        color of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that face. The &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        opposing face would have 2 corners with 2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers,
        1 with 1 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sticker, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and 1
        with none. 5 * 2 + 2 * 1 + 0 = 10 + 2 = &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 12 stickers
        for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corners. &gt; &gt;

        We should be able to discuss anything involving the RUBIK'S CUBE on this
        forum. That includes cube math and cube art. Math and art not involving
        the cube should probably be discussed elsewhere. Speed cubing is not

        why is it obvious? I don't see it. It is similar to your algorithm to
        twist two corners. In your algorithm, you move a corner from the third
        layer to the first layer, then put it back to the third layer, then you
        rotate the third layer 90 degrees and do your corner twist move in
        reverse which fixes the parts of the first two layers that you messed up
        while simultaneously rotating your second corner. It is impossible to
        swap two corners without affecting any edges, so my algorithm rotates
        three corners, then does a 90 degree turn which leaves two of the
        corners in the correct place. r+u+r- (moves DFR corner to top layer) d-
        (rotates bottom layer to prepare for second corner) r+u-r- (puts first
        corner back in a different position on the bottom layer while moving
        second corner to top layer and restores every other piece in the top two
        layers) d- (rotates bottom layer to prepare for third corner) r+u+r-
        (puts second corner back in a different position on the bottom layer
        while moving third corner to top layer) -d++ (rotates bottom layer
        preparing to return third corner) r+u-r- (puts third corner back in the
        first position on the bottom layer, and undoing previous moves that
        scrambled the top two layers) d- (orients bottom layer so that two
        corners are in the correct place, and two corners are swapped)

        I finally took the time to whip up a cube site today. It's *VERY*
        unfinished however. I only have the ELL algorithms entered, but did take
        time to show all the probablities of teh CLL and ELL senerios. Take a
        look at my new video, 20.8s. I'd appriciate any feed back. I'm really
        not targeting the newbies, it's very much a site for the more advanced,
        it details (or will detail) the CLL/ELL for the people that have always
        done OLL/PLL. I think I'll go through the abbriviations and terminology
        some where though, in an extensive manner more so then other sites. I
        think that as a community having a standard Dictionary would be great.

        Alright, not quite a speedsolver yet (I average about 60 seconds and was
        told speedsolving starts at 40 seconds and below), but I'm definitely
        working my way towards it. I average 60 seconds without using any
        memorized algorithms, but just recently started practicing my F2L with
        paired corners/edges, and have started memorizing Fridrich's 53
        fundamental algorithms. (I started this all today) After a few hours of
        practice my F2L takes an average of about 40 seconds and I have 3
        orientation alorithms memorized. It takes me an average of about 6.5
        seconds to fully execute any of those 3 algorithms I have memorized. Do
        you think I'm taking the algorithms in a little too fast? Because I was
        thinking I'd learn 5 a day, and in 2 weeks or so I'd be able to fully
        solve a cube in an average under my current 60 seconds using the speed
        solve method. I'm really looking forward to waking up tomorrow, just to
        see if I still remember the 3. Any advice for someone learning the
        Fridrich method completely fresh from the start would be greatly
        appreciated. My name is Christopher Joseph Hasbrouck, I'm 17 years old
        (as of two weeks ago) in California, USA. Got my first Rubik's Cube on
        April 20th of this year. Solved it within 4 days in under 2 minutes. My
        personal best time is 51.1 seconds. Nice to meet you all. :)

        method requires the fewest algorithms that aren't "obvious" &gt; or
        logically clear? Using a simplified Thistlethwaite approach, it is
        possible to solve the cube without any mysterious algorithms. Step 1
        uses no algorithms. Step 2 uses a 5 move algorithm. Step 3 uses a 7 move
        algorithm and a 4 move algorithm. Step 4 uses two 6 move algorithms.
        Because all algorithms are short and simple, someone who tries this
        method can say they solved the cube and understood how they did it! It's
        not too easy to follow, but it's an interesting way to solve the cube if
        you can do it. ** step 1 ** Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F,B,U,D&gt; group,
        which I will call G1. That is to say, put the cube into a position where
        the cube can be solved by only using L2,R2,F,B,U,D moves. It helps in
        this method to think of opposite colours as the same colour up until you
        get to step 4. Let's call the left/right colours "green" (these are
        unimportant in step 1), the up/down colours red, and the front/back
        colours white. Once you get into G1, it is impossible to flip edges, and
        the only thing we need to do to get the cube into G1 is to make sure all
        the edges are flipped right. First you need to find bad edges that are
        flipped the wrong way. A bad edge is one that, if moved to its home
        position using only moves from G1, will be flipped the wrong way. (Of
        course, you don't need to move it there to see that) There are always an
        even number of bad edges, between 0 and 12, or 6 on average. The only
        way to flip edges to turn the left or right sides 90 degrees, and that
        will flip the 4 edges on that side. To flip 4 bad edges, you simply move
        them all into positions on the left side (for example), and turn that
        side 90 degrees. If you have only 2 bad edges, you can make that into 4
        by moving just one of them onto the left side and turning it. That will
        change one of the bad edges into 3 (plus the other one it makes 4). At
        end of step 1, you should see no red edges facing to the front or back,
        and you should see no white edges facing to the top or bottom. To the
        untrained eye, it will look like you have accomplished nothing so far!
        Yet, these 12 edges are in a much better position now. ** step 2 ** Put
        cube into &lt;L2,R2,F2,B2,U,D&gt; group, which I will call G2. In this
        group, pieces in the middle layer will stay in the middle layer without
        flipping, and pieces in the top and bottom layers can only exchange
        between those layers without twisting or flipping. At the end of step 2,
        you should only see red on the top and bottom. In the middle layer, you
        should only see green on the left/right sides, and white on the
        front/back sides. Remember we are currently in G1, so to get to G2, we
        can only use moves from G1. To start with the edges, we want to get a
        red cross on the top and bottom. There are 8 red edges and because of
        limited space, at least 4 of those must already be forming part of the
        crosses. The general strategy is to first get 3 red edges on the top and
        3 edges on the bottom, and align them so that the missing parts of both
        crosses are facing to the front. The other 2 red edges must be somewhere
        in the middle layer (if not, you must have 4 edges instead of 3 edges on
        the top or bottom). Using double turns around the L2,R2,F2,B2 sides,
        move those two remaining red edges over to the two front positions on
        the middle layer, and turn the front 90 degrees. With the edges done, we
        have created some symmetry so it is possible rotate the cube about the
        U-D axis and change your perception of what is the front and back. Very
        convenient. Now for the corners, we can twist two corners at a time.
        Start with one corner at LUF (corner A) and the other corner at FDR
        (corner B). Then do: R'D - twists the B corner L2 - swaps the B and A
        corners D'R - twists the A corner on the way back Do this repeatedly
        until all corners are twisted the right way. You should have all red on
        the top and bottom. ** step 3 ** Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F2,B2,U2,D2&gt;
        group, named G3. In the previous step, you put only opposite colours on
        the top and bottom (red). In this step, you do the same for the
        front/back (white) and left/right (green). In G3, each corner can only
        move between one of 4 positions, which I call a circuit. There are only
        two circuits and each corner belongs to one of those circuits. Within
        G3, the only moves you can do (double turns) will swap two corners in
        one circuit, and two corners in the other circuit that overlap. This
        limits the permutations that are possible, and it means that simply
        getting opposite colours on all sides is not enough to satisfy G3. Since
        the corners are the tricky bit here, we will put the corners into G3
        first, then the edges. You must now distinguish between opposite colours
        to know if G3 is satisfied. I will use red opposite to orange, white to
        yellow, and green to blue. An easy way to see if G3 is satisfied is to
        move all red corners to the top side, and all orange corners to the
        bottom side. Pairs of corners around the top and bottom will either
        match or mismatch. If they either all match, or they all mismatch, the
        corners are in a G3 position. There is only one way for all corners to
        match, and one way for all corners to mismatch (you swap a pair of
        opposite corners), and so when the exact pattern occurs on the top and
        bottom, the bottom corners should align exactly with the top corners.
        You can switch between all matched, and none matched, by doing R2L2R2
        (that swaps a pair of opposite corners on the bottom, and a pair of
        opposite corners on the top). If you're not in either of those
        positions, here is a sequence that will swap a pair of opposite corners
        on the bottom, and an adjacent pair of corners on the top: R'FR' - move
        the 4 target corners to the back side B2 - swap! RF'R - move everything
        back This is one case where it is more efficient to temporarily break
        G2. At the end of the move, everything is restored. This move sequence
        will do swapping on the bottom side, and at the rear/back. The front/top
        pair of corners will be left alone. When you are looking for corners
        that match or mismatch, you will usually find a pair that are not like
        the rest of the pairs (eg. if all the other pairs match, this pair will
        mismatch). If you find this odd pair and hold it at the top/front, doing
        the above sequence will harmonise all the corners. Now for the edges,
        there is nothing special here. The edges also lie on circuits, but there
        are 12 edges and 3 circuits. The edges in the middle layer were already
        done in step 2 and haven't left their circuit. There are only 8 edges
        left do deal with, and we must move the white edges to the white sides
        (front/back), ie. into their circuit, and the green edges to the green
        sides (left/right). There must be an even number of edges that are
        facing in the wrong direction. The easiest move to do here is to swap
        two edges on the green sides for two edges on the white sides. The edges
        on the greens side must be positioned on the bottom, and the edges on
        the white sides must be positioned on the top. Then do: D' M2 (M is the
        slice between L and R) - swap! D This is self explanatory. Like in step
        1, if you only have 2 bad edges, you can make it into 4 in a similar
        way. At the end of this step, you should only have two (opposite)
        colours on each side of the cube. Step 4. The cube can now be solved by
        only using double turns. However, we will break this rule when we see an
        obvious short cut. First, using only double turns, solve the corners.
        First, pick a side, then join two corners on that side and the other two
        corners for that side will automatically join (if you did step 3
        properly). It is then easy to join the two pairs together, and the other
        4 corners will be automatically joined (if you did step 3 properly). To
        solve the edges, there are two simple moves that are easy to understand:
        F2R2 F2R2 F2R2 - Swap two pairs of edges on different circuits. The
        other pieces return to normal. F2 M2 F2 M2 - Swap two pairs of edges on
        the same circuit. The second F2 returns the other pieces back to normal.
        Using variations of these, it is possible to solve all the edges.
        Variations of the first include: R (F2R2 F2R2 F2R2) R' L2B2R (F2R2 F2R2
        F2R2) R'B2L2 Variations of the second include: F2 M F2 M' (the pairs
        overlap so as to rotate 3 edges) F (F2 M2 F2 M2) F' CUBE SOLVED Ryan

        Fridrich's page and Lars Petrus' page (I prefer Fridrich's system so
        far, seems more streamlined to me). I'll definitely give the others a

        that order it should be pretty obvious how to do everything. I don't use
        that method at all anymore, though... I haven't actually solved the cube
        once since I started memorizing Fridrich's algorithms. Just practice,
        practice, practicing those algs. Thanks again for the links! :)

        This is very insightful, as with many of your other posts. If impemented
        this method could be very useful for speed cubing, with an extended
        algorithm set for each step of course. It's good due to it's low number
        of moves, however I think recognition could be killer. I have practiced
        rapid determination of flipped edges for blindfold cubing, but would
        probably still have trouble doing this kind of stuff in speedcubing
        mode. It is fun (and perhaps a good exercise) to solve in the
        &lt;U2,D2,F2,B2,R2,L2&gt; generated group though. You are comming to
        Toronto, right? This article makes me want to use my site to host
        various insightful articles from experienced cubists, with due credit of
        course. I've only seen this on 1 or 2 sites, and believe that a
        categorized repository would be great to have. If not for anything else,
        then just to minimize that random repetitive, annoying posts we have
        that get the same answer the first dozen times it was asked: for
        instance "I am new at cubing, what resources/method do you people
        suggest?" or "I can't solve the cube, teach me/tell me your secrets?". I
        could look up the answers various people post here and collect them in
        one place. &gt; Because all algorithms are short and simple, someone who
        tries this &gt; method can say they solved the cube and understood how
        they did it! &gt; You sort of imply that most speedcubist don't truly
        understand how they do it when using a highly structured method. I don't
        agree with this, at least I hope it is not the case. It would be sad to
        have a sub-20 cubist not understand the entirety of their method or
        algorithms and be blindly applying algorithms and a method found on the
        net. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Ryan Heise

        fewest algorithms that aren't "obvious" &gt; &gt; or logically clear?
        &gt; &gt; Using a simplified Thistlethwaite approach, it is possible to
        solve the &gt; cube without any mysterious algorithms. &gt; &gt; Step 1
        uses no algorithms. &gt; Step 2 uses a 5 move algorithm. &gt; Step 3
        uses a 7 move algorithm and a 4 move algorithm. &gt; Step 4 uses two 6
        move algorithms. &gt; &gt; Because all algorithms are short and simple,
        someone who tries this &gt; method can say they solved the cube and
        understood how they did it! &gt; &gt; It's not too easy to follow, but
        it's an interesting way to solve the &gt; cube if you can do it. &gt;
        &gt; ** step 1 ** &gt; &gt; Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F,B,U,D&gt; group,
        which I will call G1. That is to &gt; say, put the cube into a position
        where the cube can be solved by only &gt; using L2,R2,F,B,U,D moves. It
        helps in this method to think of opposite &gt; colours as the same
        colour up until you get to step 4. Let's call the &gt; left/right
        colours "green" (these are unimportant in step 1), the &gt; up/down
        colours red, and the front/back colours white. &gt; &gt; Once you get
        into G1, it is impossible to flip edges, and the only thing &gt; we need
        to do to get the cube into G1 is to make sure all the edges are &gt;
        flipped right. First you need to find bad edges that are flipped the
        &gt; wrong way. A bad edge is one that, if moved to its home position
        using &gt; only moves from G1, will be flipped the wrong way. (Of
        course, you don't &gt; need to move it there to see that) &gt; &gt;
        There are always an even number of bad edges, between 0 and 12, or 6 on
        &gt; average. The only way to flip edges to turn the left or right sides
        90 &gt; degrees, and that will flip the 4 edges on that side. To flip 4
        bad &gt; edges, you simply move them all into positions on the left side
        (for &gt; example), and turn that side 90 degrees. If you have only 2
        bad edges, &gt; you can make that into 4 by moving just one of them onto
        the left side &gt; and turning it. That will change one of the bad edges
        into 3 (plus the &gt; other one it makes 4). &gt; &gt; At end of step 1,
        you should see no red edges facing to the front or &gt; back, and you
        should see no white edges facing to the top or bottom. To &gt; the
        untrained eye, it will look like you have accomplished nothing so &gt;
        far! Yet, these 12 edges are in a much better position now. &gt; &gt; **
        step 2 ** &gt; &gt; Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F2,B2,U,D&gt; group, which I
        will call G2. In this &gt; group, pieces in the middle layer will stay
        in the middle layer without &gt; flipping, and pieces in the top and
        bottom layers can only exchange &gt; between those layers without
        twisting or flipping. At the end of step 2, &gt; you should only see red
        on the top and bottom. In the middle layer, you &gt; should only see
        green on the left/right sides, and white on the &gt; front/back sides.
        &gt; &gt; Remember we are currently in G1, so to get to G2, we can only
        use moves &gt; from G1. To start with the edges, we want to get a red
        cross on the top &gt; and bottom. There are 8 red edges and because of
        limited space, at least &gt; 4 of those must already be forming part of
        the crosses. The general &gt; strategy is to first get 3 red edges on
        the top and 3 edges on the &gt; bottom, and align them so that the
        missing parts of both crosses are &gt; facing to the front. The other 2
        red edges must be somewhere in the &gt; middle layer (if not, you must
        have 4 edges instead of 3 edges on the &gt; top or bottom). Using double
        turns around the L2,R2,F2,B2 sides, move &gt; those two remaining red
        edges over to the two front positions on the &gt; middle layer, and turn
        the front 90 degrees. With the edges done, we &gt; have created some
        symmetry so it is possible rotate the cube about the &gt; U-D axis and
        change your perception of what is the front and back. Very &gt;
        convenient. &gt; &gt; Now for the corners, we can twist two corners at a
        time. Start with one &gt; corner at LUF (corner A) and the other corner
        at FDR (corner B). Then &gt; do: &gt; &gt; R'D - twists the B corner
        &gt; L2 - swaps the B and A corners &gt; D'R - twists the A corner on
        the way back &gt; &gt; Do this repeatedly until all corners are twisted
        the right way. You &gt; should have all red on the top and bottom. &gt;
        &gt; ** step 3 ** &gt; &gt; Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F2,B2,U2,D2&gt;
        group, named G3. In the previous step, &gt; you put only opposite
        colours on the top and bottom (red). In this step, &gt; you do the same
        for the front/back (white) and left/right (green). In &gt; G3, each
        corner can only move between one of 4 positions, which I call a &gt;
        circuit. There are only two circuits and each corner belongs to one of
        &gt; those circuits. Within G3, the only moves you can do (double turns)
        will &gt; swap two corners in one circuit, and two corners in the other
        circuit &gt; that overlap. This limits the permutations that are
        possible, and it &gt; means that simply getting opposite colours on all
        sides is not enough to &gt; satisfy G3. &gt; &gt; Since the corners are
        the tricky bit here, we will put the corners into &gt; G3 first, then
        the edges. You must now distinguish between opposite &gt; colours to
        know if G3 is satisfied. I will use red opposite to orange, &gt; white
        to yellow, and green to blue. An easy way to see if G3 is &gt; satisfied
        is to move all red corners to the top side, and all orange &gt; corners
        to the bottom side. Pairs of corners around the top and bottom &gt; will
        either match or mismatch. If they either all match, or they all &gt;
        mismatch, the corners are in a G3 position. There is only one way for
        &gt; all corners to match, and one way for all corners to mismatch (you
        swap &gt; a pair of opposite corners), and so when the exact pattern
        occurs on the &gt; top and bottom, the bottom corners should align
        exactly with the top &gt; corners. You can switch between all matched,
        and none matched, by doing &gt; R2L2R2 (that swaps a pair of opposite
        corners on the bottom, and a pair &gt; of opposite corners on the top).
        If you're not in either of those &gt; positions, here is a sequence that
        will swap a pair of opposite corners &gt; on the bottom, and an adjacent
        pair of corners on the top: &gt; &gt; R'FR' - move the 4 target corners
        to the back side &gt; B2 - swap! &gt; RF'R - move everything back &gt;
        &gt; This is one case where it is more efficient to temporarily break
        G2. At &gt; the end of the move, everything is restored. This move
        sequence will &gt; do swapping on the bottom side, and at the rear/back.
        The front/top pair &gt; of corners will be left alone. When you are
        looking for corners that &gt; match or mismatch, you will usually find a
        pair that are not like the &gt; rest of the pairs (eg. if all the other
        pairs match, this pair will &gt; mismatch). If you find this odd pair
        and hold it at the top/front, doing &gt; the above sequence will
        harmonise all the corners. &gt; &gt; Now for the edges, there is nothing
        special here. The edges also lie on &gt; circuits, but there are 12
        edges and 3 circuits. The edges in the middle &gt; layer were already
        done in step 2 and haven't left their circuit. There &gt; are only 8
        edges left do deal with, and we must move the white edges to &gt; the
        white sides (front/back), ie. into their circuit, and the green &gt;
        edges to the green sides (left/right). There must be an even number of
        &gt; edges that are facing in the wrong direction. The easiest move to
        do &gt; here is to swap two edges on the green sides for two edges on
        the white &gt; sides. The edges on the greens side must be positioned on
        the bottom, &gt; and the edges on the white sides must be positioned on
        the top. Then do: &gt; &gt; D' &gt; M2 (M is the slice between L and R)
        - swap! &gt; D &gt; &gt; This is self explanatory. Like in step 1, if
        you only have 2 bad edges, &gt; you can make it into 4 in a similar way.
        &gt; &gt; At the end of this step, you should only have two (opposite)
        colours on &gt; each side of the cube. &gt; &gt; Step 4. &gt; &gt; The
        cube can now be solved by only using double turns. However, we will &gt;
        break this rule when we see an obvious short cut. &gt; &gt; First, using
        only double turns, solve the corners. First, pick a side, &gt; then join
        two corners on that side and the other two corners for that &gt; side
        will automatically join (if you did step 3 properly). It is then &gt;
        easy to join the two pairs together, and the other 4 corners will be
        &gt; automatically joined (if you did step 3 properly). &gt; &gt; To
        solve the edges, there are two simple moves that are easy to &gt;
        understand: &gt; &gt; F2R2 F2R2 F2R2 - Swap two pairs of edges on
        different circuits. The &gt; other pieces return to normal. &gt; &gt; F2
        M2 F2 M2 - Swap two pairs of edges on the same circuit. The second &gt;
        F2 returns the other pieces back to normal. &gt; &gt; Using variations
        of these, it is possible to solve all the edges. &gt; Variations of the
        first include: &gt; &gt; R (F2R2 F2R2 F2R2) R' &gt; L2B2R (F2R2 F2R2
        F2R2) R'B2L2 &gt; &gt; Variations of the second include: &gt; &gt; F2 M
        F2 M' (the pairs overlap so as to rotate 3 edges) &gt; F (F2 M2 F2 M2)

        other hand, &gt; &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms just make sense in
        that they are &gt; &gt; logically clear; one &gt; &gt; such &gt; &gt;
        &gt; is the algorithm to twist two corners: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; r-d+r+f+d+f- u+ f+d-f-r-d-r+ u- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So
        what method requires the fewest algorithms that &gt; &gt; aren't
        "obvious" &gt; &gt; &gt; or logically clear? If I solve top corners,
        &gt; &gt; bottom corners, three &gt; &gt; &gt; top edges, three bottom
        edges, last top/bottom &gt; &gt; edge, then the &gt; &gt; middle &gt;
        &gt; &gt; edges, the only non-obvious algorithm I need is &gt; &gt; one
        to swap a pair &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; bottom corners. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Of course, this isn't really *speed* cubing, but
        &gt; &gt; I bring it up &gt; &gt; &gt; because I used to sort-of speed
        cube back in 1981 &gt; &gt; and thereabouts, &gt; &gt; &gt; but in the
        intervening 20 years I've forgotten &gt; &gt; *all* the nonobvious &gt;
        &gt; &gt; algorithms. It took me quite a while to even &gt; &gt; solve
        the cube again &gt; &gt; &gt; for the first time because I couldn't flip
        those &gt; &gt; bottom corners!) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I haven't heard of them, untilnow. What I cannot understand is how can
        they say that a 2x2x2 cube and a 3x3x3 cube can both have 27 pieces. It
        does not make much geometrical sense, at least to me. If they want

        Hello everyone. On the weekend I did my first public speedcubing, in
        front of about 120 people. It is a bit different from doing it on your
        own, in the living room! It was a pretty relaxed atmosphere (everyone
        there was from my church) but that did not seem to stop me getting very
        nervous. I started with a bit of patter, which seemed to help wind them
        up a bit, so that was good. I wondered if it might be possible to solve
        it in under a minute, which gave me tons of breathing space. I got
        someone to scramble, and someone else to give a 15 second countdown and
        then time with a stopwatch. In one sense it was a bit of a disaster,
        because I ended up having to do one f2l slot twice, and a three-look LL
        (yikes!). But that is not how I feel at all: I didn't chicken out even
        though beforehand I sort of wanted to, I did it in 33 seconds, which is
        not a very good time for me, but in the end is not the point at all: it
        just felt great to be up there, doing something that no one else there
        could even conceive of doing themselves! It was fun, and I really
        enjoyed myself! So hooray! Happy speedcubing everybody! S.

        Since there has been some heated debate about this lately I feel it's
        time I jump in and say something. First of all I started this group
        because I was completely obsessed with the cube at the time and thought
        it would be cool if I could start a group and have others join. I had NO
        IDEA that it would get as many members as it has now. The reason I named
        the group "Speed Solving Rubik's Cube" is because I wanted to draw in
        the attention of other cubists, not just have another "hey I'm into the
        cube too..." kind of group. So anyway my original goal with this group
        was to try to gather as many people as I could who were interested in
        the cube. The speed solving part was just an attention-getter. So I must
        say I'm dissapointed that the discussion environment sometimes isn't as
        open as I originally intended it. Since this is the case, I would like
        to change the name of this group to promote this more open discussion,
        and have those who do not wish to participate in the more diversified
        discussion start their own group on whatever specific topic they wish.
        Now this is just my opinion. So the purpose of this message is to ask
        all of you what you want to do. I can either change the name of this
        group to Cube Lovers or something to that affect, or we can keep this
        group as speed solving rubik's cube and start another group where topics
        such as the math of the cube, art, and any other interesting topics can
        be discussed. I absolutely do not want this group's discussion to be
        limited to just speed cubing and I would like to change it's name. What
        are everyone's opinion's on this? Chris

        heated debate about this lately I feel it's &gt; time I jump in and say
        something. First of all I started this group &gt; because I was
        completely obsessed with the cube at the time and &gt; thought it would
        be cool if I could start a group and have others &gt; join. I had NO
        IDEA that it would get as many members as it has &gt; now. The reason I
        named the group "Speed Solving Rubik's Cube" is &gt; because I wanted to
        draw in the attention of other cubists, not just &gt; have another "hey
        I'm into the cube too..." kind of group. So anyway &gt; my original goal
        with this group was to try to gather as many people &gt; as I could who
        were interested in the cube. The speed solving part &gt; was just an
        attention-getter. So I must say I'm dissapointed that &gt; the
        discussion environment sometimes isn't as open as I originally &gt;
        intended it. Since this is the case, I would like to change the name
        &gt; of this group to promote this more open discussion, and have those
        &gt; who do not wish to participate in the more diversified discussion
        &gt; start their own group on whatever specific topic they wish. Now
        this &gt; is just my opinion. So the purpose of this message is to ask
        all of &gt; you what you want to do. I can either change the name of
        this group &gt; to Cube Lovers or something to that affect, or we can
        keep this group &gt; as speed solving rubik's cube and start another
        group where topics &gt; such as the math of the cube, art, and any other
        interesting topics &gt; can be discussed. &gt; &gt; I absolutely do not
        want this group's discussion to be limited to &gt; just speed cubing and
        I would like to change it's name. What are &gt; everyone's opinion's on
        this? &gt; &gt; Chris

        topics. Besides, I think it's nice not to have to follow several
        different groups. I know that other groups that have been started in the
        past have failed to gain momentum. For example, look at the world
        championship group. In theory, all world championship related
        discussions and questions are supposed to be posted over there, but they
        end up here instead. Why? I'd say it's probably because this is the
        greatest concentration of people "in the know" when it comes to anything
        cube related, be it speed specific or not. I think the problem, here, is
        that people are getting sick of hearing about certain types of "off
        topic" content and forget that they themselves talk about quite a bit
        that is not actually within the context of "speed cubing" proper. I say
        if there's a discussion you don't want to hear about, then skip over it
        - don't even bother reading it. The name should still be
        SpeedSolvingRubiksCube, because in general, that's probably the main
        focus/goal of most people once they can solve the cube (get an interest
        in being able to do so). I think it describes our "community" well, and
        should stay, as well as the discussion that isn't necessarily focused on
        the "speed" part of the name. Besides, like you said - it's a good
        attention getter. Just my 2 cents. - Grant

        I have to agree as well, the name is fine. I think the problem is that
        the topics that are being discussed are quite interesting but then they
        get twisted and distorted. I think we all can get along without changing
        the name. We just need to consider that interupting or changing the main

        said, you are the minority and that is sad, I like that you have joined
        this group and are active in it, but i think you just have to simir down
        your cube art tangents in a "non cube art" discussion to a low roar. I
        think that is whats peeving everyone, for ex. when your concentrating on
        the posts for memorization tips, and then out of the middle no where
        someone says, "well i don't need to memorize anything for cube art" well
        that kind of bums some people out. And i shouldn't be aiming this just
        at you Hana, there are plenty others that like to include their own spin
        offs, (I raise my hand high as well).... As far as others go, we are

        don't. Some of them are just too complicated. Of course, the philosophy
        of my system is to reduce the mysterious part as much as possible so
        that you can participate more in the solving of the cube. Ryan

        Well, after about two days of practice I've gotten my F2L consistently
        below 40 seconds (usually around 37). This is with an un- lubricated
        cube. While I am showing a lot of improvement compared to early
        yesterday when it always took me over 70 seconds, I still can't conceive
        of myself ever being able to do F2L in under 15 seconds. Are there any
        special techniques, or advantageous ways of holding the cube I should
        know about? Any really helpful finger shortcuts? I've noticed there is a
        lot of hesitation during my F2L. I think I actually spend more time
        hesitating than I do executing rotations. Can any experienced
        speedcubers give me tips on intuitive F2L? What I should be
        anticipating? I've been told I *shouldn't* be doing F2L based on
        memorized algorithms, so I don't. But it does seem like that might help
        a little. I'll buy some silicon-based spray lubricant this weekend and
        lube my cube, we'll see how that goes! -Chris

        cube, art, and any other interesting topics can be discussed. I vote for
        the second. If we are to start up the cube-lovers mailing list again, it
        has to be a continuation of the original, out of respect for one of the
        oldest and longest running mailing lists in the history of the Internet.
        If we simply renamed this Yahoo group to cube-lovers, it would not be
        the same list that it was. Not only that, an *important* historical fact
        about cube-lovers was that it was a "mailing list" and not a "Yahoo
        Group" :-) We should either ask someone at MIT if they could start it up
        again, or if there is no other option, I can probably host it here at
        progsoc. But.. if you want to rename this group, my suggestion is
        "cubists". Ryan

        it isnt bad to do F2L based on algs, in fact it can help you to grasp
        the concept better. (In my opinion) I just feel that if you do need to
        use algs to get the hang of it, then do so, but then start solving based
        on intuition... this is when you will start seeing drastic improvement
        in your times. That is how it was in my case anyway. Another big help
        would be to solve some example cubes with other people either in the
        weekend chat or through yahoo messenger. My sn is ephem825 if you ever
        feel like giving it a shot. Good Luck, Frank cjhasbrouck

        I've gotten my F2L consistently below 40 seconds (usually around 37).
        This is with an un- lubricated cube. While I am showing a lot of
        improvement compared to early yesterday when it always took me over 70
        seconds, I still can't conceive of myself ever being able to do F2L in
        under 15 seconds. Are there any special techniques, or advantageous ways
        of holding the cube I should know about? Any really helpful finger
        shortcuts? I've noticed there is a lot of hesitation during my F2L. I
        think I actually spend more time hesitating than I do executing
        rotations. Can any experienced speedcubers give me tips on intuitive
        F2L? What I should be anticipating? I've been told I *shouldn't* be
        doing F2L based on memorized algorithms, so I don't. But it does seem
        like that might help a little. I'll buy some silicon-based spray
        lubricant this weekend and lube my cube, we'll see how that goes! -Chris

        Hana, are you a member of cubism for fun? They deal with rubik like
        puzzles and math behind them as well as non rubiks puzzles and stuff.
        Its an interesting magazine. The downside of the magazine is that you
        only get 3 a year, and the price is kinda high, but the information is
        fascinating!!! I think that would be cool if someone started a mailing
        list and some articles. We could have a small yearly fee, but send out

        I figured you probably already did, but regardless, they have an
        interesting newsletter that isn't just cube related. Its a bummer that
        they hold the cube day in the Netherlands cause i would love to go! Have
        you tried asking them to see if you could include a column or something
        in their newsletter, i would think that they would eat that right up! :)

        important &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; him, why not change it to
        something more general, and suggested &gt; &gt; &gt; cube_lovers. I have

        I both agree and disagree with your friend. I think that the more you
        break in your cube (twisting etc.) then the more the inside will wear
        down and the more you will be able to cut corners, which is a major boon
        when going fast (at least I try to take advantage of it as much as
        possible). Since wearing in a cube and wearing down the hard edges
        builds up cube dust inside, I guess it could appear that the dust itself
        is lubing the cube, but I think it is just the fact that the dust has
        come off the pieces that helps. I used to think that the dust in the
        cube was the best lube, however the first time I applied some silicone
        based lubricant to my cube I changed my mind completely :) My two cents,

        Thanks, guys, you are finally doing, what I always asaked you to do -
        providing me with resources on cube art on the web. However, I know this
        page also. It shows another 2d cube artist, who, alas, is now deceased.
        I think he is one of the first to have the idea to create multi-cube
        art, and from the website I suspect he was about ready to switch freom
        2d to 3d. The end came too soon for him. :-( His name was Fred Holly.
        And that's it. As far as I know, Jacob Davenport, Fred Holly and I are
        the only multi-cube artists I could find. So the next site has to point
        to someone I don't know., Keep trying. :-) Please, by all means visit

        statement completely. Amd let us not make the mistske of excluding the
        speedcubists, just because they have their Yahoo group. In fact,
        everyone who loves the cube should belong to cube-lovers. Hana a kostky

        you can get replacement stickers that are already the right shape. But
        you should measure the litte cubes on the cube, andthen cut the stickers
        to that size. I think it's 1.6 cm. Unfortunately for Americans, we're
        kinda dumb, so I don't know to to use the metric system. Maybe you do.

        I have recently bought the "Memory Pack" by Andi Bell (I wanted to try a
        different approach to that implememted by Harry Lorayne). I am sure that
        this topic has come up before but cannot find any references when
        searching the archives, but he uses a rubiks cube to represent the
        number 56, with the intriguing comment 'If you think about it, it has 56
        squares'. There are 9 squares on each of the 6 facef which adds up to
        54, so my question is how can you think that there are 56 squares? The
        only 2 possibilities I can come up with are: a) he made a mistake
        thinking 9 times 6 is 56, or b) his cube had two extra squares on it (eg
        on a logo on the centre piece of the white face), though I haven't seen
        a cube that does. Any replies (which remain on topic) will be gratefully
        received. thanks, stiff_hands

        I agree with Jake, let's all be friends! :) Here are some more
        thoughts... Let's keep the existing name. This group has a life of it's
        own and I doubt a name change would have too much impact on how it
        evolves anyway. I'm certainly happy to see people initiate conversations
        on any cube related topic, not just speedcubing. However, when replying
        to someone else's topic, surely the reply should_be_a_reply? Isn't the
        reason you hit the 'reply' button because you want to engage in
        discussion on that issue? If you want to talk about something different,
        then perhaps you should start a new conversation string. Replying to a
        topic, and then cutting the conversation off and changing it to
        something unrelated to what everyone was discussing will frustrate
        people. I thought of an example to illustrate one of the points Jake was
        making (at least I think this is what you were getting at Jake, sorry if
        I misunderstoof)... Imagine someone saw a funny Rubik's cube t-shirt in
        a shop and wanted to tell everyone ("hey guys, guess what I saw when I
        was shopping today??"). I don't think there would be a problem creating
        a new conversation string and saying this. It's a different situation,
        however, if someone replied to an existing conversation where people
        were discussing group theory and said "yeah, well, that maths stuff can
        be interesting if you're into it, but I found this cool t-shirt and so
        let's all talk about that now" (not that anyone would say that exactly,
        but you get the idea). In the first example, it's likely to lead to a
        string of replies from others who have seen fun cube merchandise around
        (ie. a positive outcome!). In the second example, however, people will
        just get annoyed (definitely not a positive outcome!). So, I think the
        issue isn't so much the idea of talking about cube topics that aren't
        strictly speedcubing, it's more how you go about raising the topic, and
        not cutting off existing conversations. What do people think? Jasmine.

        We just need &gt; to consider that interupting or changing the main
        focus of a certain &gt; post is just like being rude in a normal
        conversation. (not always, &gt; though) &gt; &gt; As far as Cube art
        goes, Hana, as you said, you are the minority and &gt; that is sad, I
        like that you have joined this group and are active in &gt; it, but i
        think you just have to simir down your cube art tangents in &gt; a "non
        cube art" discussion to a low roar. I think that is whats &gt; peeving
        everyone, for ex. when your concentrating on the posts for &gt;
        memorization tips, and then out of the middle no where someone &gt;
        says, "well i don't need to memorize anything for cube art" well &gt;
        that kind of bums some people out. And i shouldn't be aiming this &gt;
        just at you Hana, there are plenty others that like to include their
        &gt; own spin offs, (I raise my hand high as well).... &gt; &gt; As far
        as others go, we are lucky to have a group to discuss certain &gt;
        aspects of the cube, and this is not a battlefield of pety diferences
        &gt; and such. If you have a problem with something or someone just
        email &gt; them privately. &gt; &gt; Lets all be friends :) &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; to do. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I absolutely do not
        want this group's discussion to be limited to &gt; &gt; &gt; just speed
        cubing and I would like to change it's name. What are &gt; &gt; &gt;
        everyone's opinion's on this? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I personally think
        everything should be left as is. It's nice to &gt; &gt; have all the
        cube related discussions in one place, especially &gt; since &gt; &gt;
        discussion on speed-cubing can lead to questions/discussion on math &gt;
        &gt; or other topics. Besides, I think it's nice not to have to follow
        &gt; &gt; several different groups. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know that
        other groups that have been started in the past have &gt; &gt; failed to
        gain momentum. For example, look at the world &gt; championship &gt;
        &gt; group. In theory, all world championship related discussions and
        &gt; &gt; questions are supposed to be posted over there, but they end
        up &gt; here &gt; &gt; instead. Why? I'd say it's probably because this
        is the greatest &gt; &gt; concentration of people "in the know" when it
        comes to anything &gt; cube &gt; &gt; related, be it speed specific or
        not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think the problem, here, is that people are
        getting sick of &gt; hearing &gt; &gt; about certain types of "off
        topic" content and forget that they &gt; &gt; themselves talk about
        quite a bit that is not actually within the &gt; &gt; context of "speed
        cubing" proper. I say if there's a discussion &gt; you &gt; &gt; don't
        want to hear about, then skip over it - don't even bother &gt; &gt;
        reading it. The name should still be SpeedSolvingRubiksCube, &gt;
        because &gt; &gt; in general, that's probably the main focus/goal of
        most people once &gt; &gt; they can solve the cube (get an interest in
        being able to do so). &gt; I &gt; &gt; think it describes our
        "community" well, and should stay, as well &gt; as &gt; &gt; the
        discussion that isn't necessarily focused on the "speed" part &gt; of
        &gt; &gt; the name. Besides, like you said - it's a good attention
        getter. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Grant

        annoyed (definitely not a positive &gt; outcome!). &gt; &gt; So, I think
        the issue isn't so much the idea of talking about cube &gt; topics that
        aren't strictly speedcubing, it's more how you go about &gt; raising the
        topic, and not cutting off existing conversations. &gt; &gt; What do
        people think? &gt; &gt; Jasmine. &gt; &gt; --- In

        is fine. I think the problem is &gt; &gt; that the topics that are being

        distorted. &gt; &gt; I think we all can get along without changing the
        name. We just &gt; need &gt; &gt; to consider that interupting or
        changing the main focus of a &gt; certain &gt; &gt; post is just like
        being rude in a normal conversation. (not &gt; always, &gt; &gt; though)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as Cube art goes, Hana, as you said, you are
        the minority &gt; and &gt; &gt; that is sad, I like that you have joined
        this group and are active &gt; in &gt; &gt; it, but i think you just
        have to simir down your cube art tangents &gt; in &gt; &gt; a "non cube
        art" discussion to a low roar. I think that is whats &gt; &gt; peeving
        everyone, for ex. when your concentrating on the posts for &gt; &gt;
        memorization tips, and then out of the middle no where someone &gt; &gt;
        says, "well i don't need to memorize anything for cube art" well &gt;
        &gt; that kind of bums some people out. And i shouldn't be aiming this
        &gt; &gt; just at you Hana, there are plenty others that like to include
        &gt; their &gt; &gt; own spin offs, (I raise my hand high as well)....
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as others go, we are lucky to have a group to
        discuss &gt; certain &gt; &gt; aspects of the cube, and this is not a
        battlefield of pety &gt; diferences &gt; &gt; and such. If you have a
        problem with something or someone just &gt; email &gt; &gt; them
        privately. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lets all be friends :) &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I absolutely do not want this group's
        discussion to be limited &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just speed cubing
        and I would like to change it's name. What &gt; are &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        everyone's opinion's on this? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I personally
        think everything should be left as is. It's nice to &gt; &gt; &gt; have
        all the cube related discussions in one place, especially &gt; &gt;
        since &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion on speed-cubing can lead to
        questions/discussion on &gt; math &gt; &gt; &gt; or other topics.
        Besides, I think it's nice not to have to &gt; follow &gt; &gt; &gt;
        several different groups. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know that
        other groups that have been started in the past have &gt; &gt; &gt;
        failed to gain momentum. For example, look at the world &gt; &gt;
        championship &gt; &gt; &gt; group. In theory, all world championship
        related discussions and &gt; &gt; &gt; questions are supposed to be
        posted over there, but they end up &gt; &gt; here &gt; &gt; &gt;
        instead. Why? I'd say it's probably because this is the &gt; greatest
        &gt; &gt; &gt; concentration of people "in the know" when it comes to
        anything &gt; &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; related, be it speed specific or
        not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think the problem, here, is that
        people are getting sick of &gt; &gt; hearing &gt; &gt; &gt; about
        certain types of "off topic" content and forget that they &gt; &gt; &gt;
        themselves talk about quite a bit that is not actually within the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; context of "speed cubing" proper. I say if there's a
        discussion &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want to hear about, then
        skip over it - don't even bother &gt; &gt; &gt; reading it. The name
        should still be SpeedSolvingRubiksCube, &gt; &gt; because &gt; &gt; &gt;
        in general, that's probably the main focus/goal of most people &gt; once
        &gt; &gt; &gt; they can solve the cube (get an interest in being able to
        do &gt; so). &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; think it describes our
        "community" well, and should stay, as well &gt; &gt; as &gt; &gt; &gt;
        the discussion that isn't necessarily focused on the "speed" part &gt;
        &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; the name. Besides, like you said - it's a good
        attention getter. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents. &gt;

        1 meter = 100 cm. You have to keep your dimensionsconsistent n such
        calculations. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with
        things like matrices, determinants, solving a set of linear equationd by
        using Craner's rule and zuch. It is not called for in this computation.

        I think you should definitely attend, as long as it's a possibility for

        Think out this... if you don't go, and then after August, there are
        heaps and heaps of messages here about how much fun it was and what a
        great experience it was... will you be regetting your decision not to

        &gt; &gt; &gt; i have the stickers that came with my cube still on the
        &gt; cube, &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they're comming
        off. I want to try vinyl tape as a &gt; replacement. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        how &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do i put the tape on? do i just cut it into a
        square and put &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        or do i have to do something with dividers or do i have to put &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; PVC &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers on it? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; On Rubiks.com you can get replacement stickers that are
        &gt; &gt; already the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right shape. But you
        should measure the litte cubes on the &gt; cube, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; andthen cut the stickers to that size. I think it's 1.6
        cm. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately for Americans, we're kinda
        dumb, so I don't know &gt; to &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use
        the metric system. Maybe you do. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        You and I are he lucky ones to be able to go to Toronto. Unfortunately,
        unless you live in, or have friends in Toronto, you need a place to
        sleep and food to eat. That costs money, which some of hose college kids
        just don't have. Let us not forget transportation. I think the original
        poster is from the US. But that could be Hawaii, Alaska, Florida or
        Texas. Pretty far from Toronto, as the map will tell you. Han a kostky

        Do you have a job? If not, then you probably need to save your money.
        I'm going to assume you do, though. I got lucky, though, because my dad
        goes on so many business trips that he has roughly 5.7 billion frequent
        flier miles. So we got the plane tickets for just about nothing. But
        doesn't the hotel have a special Rubiks cuber rate for people
        participating? Since this topic is about people going/not going, I'm
        going to share something I find very annoying: I taught three of my
        friends how to solve the cube. They can each solve in about 45 seconds,
        and they enjoy it greatly. At first all three of them were going, then
        one dropped out for no reason. Another one lost interest, so he's not
        going either. Then the last friend, and the one that's best at the cube
        (besides me) decided not to go for no reason at all either. He says that
        he thinks it will be boring. He figures that we'll go to Toronto, go to
        the cube for time, then leave. Now I'm all alone.... --- In

        Cool vid. I've seen some people, like Lars Petrus and Gille(sp?) have a
        watch that they time themselves on screen with. And I think some

        The best place to buy a silicone spray lubricant is your local hardware
        store. I just got some today, and WOW what a difference! It really is
        great. Most people take it apart and spray each side, but the spray I
        got today came with a thin red plastic tube that you can attach to the
        spray-head, so my dad just attached that and gave it about a .5 second
        spray between each cubie. That worked perfectly. So if you don't want to
        go to the trouble of taking your cube apart, just buy a spray that comes
        with a little tube that you can attach to the spray-head. Make SURE the
        spray you buy is silicone-based. If it's not silicone- based, you'll
        have a lot of problems with it... at first I tried some WD-40, that's a
        petroleum-based lubricant, and it completely destroyed my second Rubik's
        Cube. -Chris

        Why don't you assemble your cube and practice, instead of cleaning/
        drying/lubing/watching it and posting messages? Seriously beginners use
        to worry TOO MUCH about their cubes, but the cube is not so important
        (especially for beginners). /Adam

        NOO!!! Water will wash out the silicone spray, and also it will sort of

        Hi ! I'm about to improve the method I currently use and I'm looking for
        interresting new approaches... I do 44 sec AVG with a lucky PB of 33
        sec. I use a light friedrich system with a LL in 4 looks. I average 23
        in the F2L. I like the idea of starting to do the Last layer before the
        first two are completely done. Let's call it an extended LL, where
        instead of doing all the LL in 2 looks you do the last F2L pair and the
        LL in 3 looks. Based on this there is several possible approaches
        including your own, that is : last f2l edge + orient edges, last f2l
        corner + permute edges, orient and permute corners. I thought that if we
        could find a chronology that let us end with only the permutations, it
        would be easier to switch techniques from friedrich's. for example :
        last f2l edge + orient edges, last f2l corner + orient corners, permute
        all. it just spreads the orientation phase on the last pair... the
        problem with this one is the huge ammount of algs when the 5 corners are
        to be moved altogether... And we can't touch the LL edges before the
        last f2l edge is in place... or can we ? I'm sure there is a way...but I
        still don't see it... Think about someone able to do the Hardwick's
        extended cross, then 2 F2L pairs, then finish in 3 looks...it would be
        pretty fast !! joan.

        Oh. You shouldn't wash it anyway. Sometimes dust collects in the cube,

        Well, I would suggest an exacto knife or something. I've never done it
        before, though, so I can't say. But on rubiks.com, they have sticker
        replacement kits for $4.99. They come with enough stickers for three
        cubes, and since it will take several years for the stickers to wear out
        (I think), those will hold forever. Those stickers are already in the
        right shape. Here's the link: http://www.rubikshop.com/cgi-
        bin/shop.cgi/SID=1058140009.3466.r/num=stkcls Also, I'm working on a new
        way to resticker cubes that doesn't actually have anything to do with
        stickers. It has to do with super gluing colored index cards on to the
        cube. It should (hopefully) work well. --- In

        orient edges, last f2l corner + permute edges, orient &gt; and permute
        corners. &gt; &gt; I thought that if we could find a chronology that let
        us end with &gt; only the permutations, it would be easier to switch
        techniques from &gt; friedrich's. &gt; &gt; for example : &gt; &gt; last
        f2l edge + orient edges, last f2l corner + orient corners, &gt; permute
        all. &gt; &gt; it just spreads the orientation phase on the last pair...
        &gt; the problem with this one is the huge ammount of algs when the 5
        &gt; corners are to be moved altogether... &gt; &gt; And we can't touch
        the LL edges before the last f2l edge is in &gt; place... &gt; or can we
        ? &gt; &gt; I'm sure there is a way...but I still don't see it... &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Think about someone able to do the Hardwick's extended cross,
        then 2 &gt; F2L pairs, then finish in 3 looks...it would be pretty fast

        I don't particularly agree with this suggestion. I go through stickers
        like crazy and order them buy the hundreds. Those crappy rubiks.com ones
        are not worth the money, they will peel and lose pigmentation after 3
        weeks of use. I recommend vinyl/electrical tape and a good pair of
        sissors. I call dibs on the signature deep fillet I've been using for
        the last 3 years :). I'm currently trying to work out a deal to obtain a
        bulk supply of cube stickers (with the good orange), I might run a
        service (little/no profit) similar to Ton's studio cubes to help remidy
        this problem we face in this community. -Doug --- In

        the problem with this one is the huge ammount of algs when the 5 &gt;
        corners are to be moved altogether... 14 orientation patterns * 5 corner
        positions = up to 70 algorithms. Also, corners are quite difficult to
        manipulate. You might find the algorithms are longer and more difficult
        to work out. I decided to permute edges instead, for a number of
        reasons: 1. The edge permutation is easy to recognise because the edges
        are oriented. 2. There are only 3 unique edge permutations because the
        F2L edge is in place. 3. Edges are easier to manipulate. Also, many of
        the algorithms are obvious and easy to work out:
        http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step3.html Half of the
        algorithms require only 7 moves, and you probably know many of them from
        the Fridrich system. It is just a matter of knowing how they affect the
        edges. For step 4, you can if you wish split it into two stages,
        orienting corners (6 algs) then permuting (3 algs). 4 of the 6
        orientation algs can be taken directly from Jessica's orientation
        algorithms (the ones that preserve the edges). And all 3 permutation
        algorithms can be taken from her list. Ryan

        No, but it is also the name of the host of some popular dating show on

        That's the problem with doing it &gt; underwater, &gt; &gt; too. &gt;
        &gt; You shouldn't wash it. If it become slippery on the outside at all,
        &gt; &gt; then you might have used too much so just wipe it with a
        towel. &gt; &gt; After all, why would you wash the lubrication off when

        I'm going to be staying at the Holiday Inn when I first arrive, sometime
        on Thursday, then I'll move over to the Crowne Plaza whenever everyone
        is set to get there (I assume the competitor rate starts Friday night).
        Hey by the way, like I said, I'll be arriving on Thursday, perhaps
        around noon or maybe early to mid afternoon. I'm very curious as to who
        else is arriving early as I would love to get together with other people
        before the championships and maybe tour the city or something. Have a

        &gt; Does anybody know about an optimal solver that finds otpimal &gt;
        solutions in terms of quarter-turns? I have an optimal solver that finds
        solutions in either the quarter turn metric or the half turn metric. I'm
        currently running it on random cubes (I'm up to 7000 cubes) but I'd be
        delighted to "optimize" any patterns that people here have. Input is a
        move sequence (of course, possibly non-optimal). I'd be happy to make
        source available too, but it requires 700MB of RAM to run. On an old
        Celeron 1.3GHz machine, it takes an average of about 15 minutes to solve
        a half-turn position and 6 minutes to solve a quarter turn position.
        (The median is quite a bit less than this.) It takes advantage of
        symmetry too so it works well for "pretty patterns". So just post the
        move sequences you'd like to optimize (or email them to me) and I'll
        send back the result.

        To all the people using the fridrich system, do you ever have trouble
        remembering the algs? I was looking at the orientation ones, and there
        are a few that say they come up 1 in every 108 times. Wouldn't you
        forget the ones that you barely ever do? See, I'm trying to figure out a
        different way to do the method I'm using (petrus). During the F2L, the
        edges get oriented. Then for the last layer, I use two sequences. But if
        I didn't orient the edges during the first two layers, and I learned the
        LL orientation algs, it would be the same amount of time minus the edge
        orientation. That would hopefully cut off 2-5 seconds, bringing my
        average down to about 22-25 seconds. Hopefully. The problem is that the

        Since you asked, I don't have trouble remembering the algs, and I know
        several for each case. But there is SUCH a difference between knowing
        the alg, and really KNOWING the alg, in the first case, you would see
        the case, and think, righttt, what do I do here... and then perform the
        algorithm. But in the second case, you would see the case, and not even
        thinking about it your hands would instantly apply the algorithms. This
        way, even if you have not seen the case for weeks, as soon as you see
        it, your hands would automatically start the algorithm off. This I'm
        afraid, only comes with lots and lots of practice. DanH :) -----

        I'd say that I get the "amnesia" phenomenon every now and then. An alg
        that I have learned and applied several hundred, if not thousand, times
        before comes up and I have NO CLUE what to do. I usually just stop the
        timer if it is running and force myself to think through the alg until I
        can again remember how to do it. Sometimes it takes very little time to
        remember, sometimes it takes a LOT of time. That's the only weird thing
        I ever get about the memorized algs. I wouldn't worry about forgetting
        the rare algs, the rarest orientation of them all, the 7th one down on
        Jessica's list, only comes up 1 in every 216 times but it is one of my
        fastest finger trick algs. So as long as you memorize them well, there
        is very little chance of you forgetting them, except for the occasional
        bout of amnesia :) I say go for learning the LL algs if you're
        interested. However, you may want to wait until after the championships
        to really dive into that area, so that you won't confuse yourself when
        you're on stage. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        rack that my girlfriend and her parents made for my cubes, so they
        wouldn't clutter up the desk anymore. It's rubiksrack.jpg. On the very
        very top left are 2 keychain cubes and a novelty mini cube from a $.25
        machine, then my underwatercube surrounded by my instant insanity, and
        my texture cube. Within the cubbies are my Homer cube, 5x5x5, bart cube,
        square-1, pretty 3x3x3, 2x2x2, megaminx, 4x4x4, and pyraminx. The cube I
        ACTUALLY use stays in the living room most of the time. Isn't that neat!
        I was excited, had to share. Thanks for endulging!

        all the people using the fridrich system, do you ever have &gt; trouble
        remembering the algs? I was looking at the orientation ones, &gt; and
        there are a few that say they come up 1 in every 108 times. &gt;
        Wouldn't you forget the ones that you barely ever do? What I do is
        practice the algorithms in groups. In your case, you can divide up your
        groups according to the orientation pattern of the edges, with each edge
        pattern representing a different group. Within each group, there will be
        many different patterns of corners, and in one day, you can practice one
        such group. The way to practice is to just do a normal speed cubing
        session, and when you get to the final layer, adjust the orientation of
        the edges to match the pattern your practicing (usually a 6 move
        algorithm is enough to do the trick). You should still end up in a
        random corner pattern, but you have just narrowed the possibilities.
        This way, you can make some of the rare cases occur more frequently
        while you're practicing. As for remembering algorithms, some algorithms
        are very easy to remember, while some are very difficult. I pick the
        ones that are very easy to remember. For example, in my last layer
        approach, there are a few basic algorithms that are very short, and it
        turns out that it is possible to solve most positions using a
        combination of these short algorithms. When they are combined together,
        a few moves in the middle cancel out giving an optimal solution, but an
        easy to remember one. Maybe this is possible in the Fridrich system too.
        &gt; See, I'm trying to figure out a different way to do the method I'm
        &gt; using (petrus). During the F2L, the edges get oriented. Then for
        the &gt; last layer, I use two sequences. But if I didn't orient the
        edges &gt; during the first two layers, and I learned the LL orientation
        algs, &gt; it would be the same amount of time minus the edge
        orientation. Not exactly, the F2L can be finished more quickly if the
        edges are already oriented (single hand grip), and so can the last layer
        (most of the shortest orientation algorithms are when all of the edges
        are oriented). So maybe it all evens out... Ryan

        go. 1. Have a parent/legal guardian write a letter of consent. (To

        gathered they send you an email clarifying your parents clarification
        that you can go to Toronto. In this email you are supposed to clarify
        that your parent is indeed your parent, or something. Credit card for

        If you don't want to read posts qbout WC and Toronto, just throw them
        out and don't read them. Those going to Toronto are mostly speed cubists
        anyway. They ask about Toronto, then they pose a speueudcubing question.

        Dan, trhe time flies by. Today is July 16. Wehave 15+23=38 days. In that

        about Canadian customs. Those gentlemen don't know trhat there is a
        Championship going on in Toronto and the cubes are shipped for an
        exhibit. When confronted with not one, but 252 Rubik's cubs, they might
        think the world has gone crazy. That's why I would kike to send them out
        sooner. The post office here told me the maximum weight and box
        duimensions it will accept. When I figured it all out, I found all those
        cubes WILL STILL BE UNDER THOSE LIMITS. Isn't that cool? I may send the
        box via the Post Office. Thank you, Hana a kiostky PS. Who is Dave C?

        outlets will be wanting interviews &gt; (live) &gt; &gt; &gt; during the

        A solution that takes about 40 moves is always easy to find in a short
        time. Less than 35 is MUCH MORE difficult to reach. And when I see
        Fewest Moves Challenges solutions far below 30 (!$#@!%!), it makes me
        want to ask a simple question: How many time do you spend on it, in
        order to reach such incredible results? A good strategy and a developed
        intuition help a lot, of course. But you often can't come up with a nice
        ending, unless it has been conditioned many moves before, thanks to
        moves that seem completely useless at that stage. Massive backtracking
        is a key to better, but (sadly) unexpected, solutions. So, how many
        hours? 1,2,4,8..? Thanks, Gilles.

        HEADS UP.... Speedstack timer pads will be used for our event to
        introduce total fairness during starts and stops. All competitors will
        be assigned time to get use to the pads upon arrival to the event hotel.
        Whats new on these pads which introduce total fairness you ask? there
        are hand pads where your hands have to be place on the pad to ready the
        timer...timer starts when hands are removed from pad and stops when
        hands are place back on the pad.... We are aware of possible fallout
        from this however in order to make things totally fair the RCC(rubisk
        championship committee) has decided to implement this type of timer.
        Each event podium will have one of these timers as well as 2 officials
        with stop watches as backups to the timer. in case of timer failure the
        lowest time on the backup stop watch will be the time for said run....
        These pads in the future will be modified with the Rubiks logo etc and
        will be implemented onto the rubiks site for purchase and will be used
        for all future events... for mor einfo on these timer pads and external
        display units please visit www.speedstacks.com danG Chief

        Hi! I suspect alot of people aren't telling how fast they really are now
        near to the WC. But I think that it doesn't matter for me. When we will
        be on stage in the WC it won't matter what record we have. I think that
        most people will be maybe 2 seconds slower than their best avg. So
        that's why I post this. Don't think I will repeat this in the WC...
        Today I broke the unofficial world record. I haven't cubed much lately
        and I thought that I should practise some so I wouldn't be slower. So I
        made a few averages. At first my avg was something like 18.2 or so. But
        in an hour my times were much better. Here are my times: 15.74 17.83
        17.53 14.69 16.99 16.25 (14.19) 15.7 18.7 14.83 14.83 (18.83) = 16.31
        Four times below 15 seconds and no one above 19! That has never happened
        before. Non of the solves was lucky btw. The strange thing was that I
        during this session talked with a friend in the phone. I may not have
        been a very active speaker, but I answered questions and saying "yes "
        or "no" while I was solving the cube. This may have had the effect that
        I wasn't "thinking" so much, and instead my brain took care of the rest.
        I couldn't understand that it went so fast but it did. Someone else who
        have similar experiences? David Wesley

        Hey David, congrats on breaking (your!) UWR again, the times were good.
        Talking with a friend or so helps to keep relaxed and achieve

        Does anybody know of or have algorithms (or a generator for different
        cases, cube orientation, etc.) that ONLY use two faces. I realize these
        algorithms are going to be much longer on some occasions, but
        nonetheless I would like to take a look at some. I am mainly interested
        in the permutation algorithms, but F2L or orientations would be cool as
        well. I have tried to develop a few on my own (with no luck), and I have
        never used any of the java applets and tools out there. Perhaps there is
        already something that generates algorithms (with specified faces only)
        for you that I am not aware of that somebody could fill me in on. Thanks

        My new and improved way will be to not orient the edges, then extend to
        two layers the way people do with the fridrich method. And I've heard

        It was pretty easy to learn the permutation algs, but that's because
        there are only 21 of them. I usually try to learn 2 algs per day, except
        when I have loads of free time when I do 3-5. So it would take about a
        month to learn alll of the OLL algs, but then it would take about 2 or 3

        &gt; &gt; &gt; and there are a few that say they come up 1 in every 108
        times. &gt; &gt; &gt; Wouldn't you forget the ones that you barely ever
        do? &gt; &gt; &gt; See, I'm trying to figure out a different way to do
        the method &gt; I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; using (petrus). During the F2L, the
        edges get oriented. Then for &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; last layer, I
        use two sequences. But if I didn't orient the &gt; edges &gt; &gt; &gt;
        during the first two layers, and I learned the LL orientation &gt; algs,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; it would be the same amount of time minus the edge
        orientation. &gt; &gt; That &gt; &gt; &gt; would hopefully cut off 2-5
        seconds, bringing my average down to &gt; &gt; &gt; about 22-25 seconds.
        Hopefully. The problem is that the &gt; &gt; &gt; championships are in
        about 1 1/2 months, and I don't think &gt; that's &gt; &gt; &gt; enough
        time to get used to my new method. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the

        I don't think that the edge orientation step is necessarily a waste of
        time, I just feel that is is not entirely needed. Right now, I'm
        averaging 65 moves. I do about 2.5 to 2.75 moves per second, which
        results in times of 25+ seconds, so without the edge orientation step
        (which I just think I'm bad at, for some reason) I can get my moves down
        to at most 60 moves. That will be about 22 to 25 seconds. Hopefully. And
        if it doesn't work out to lowering my times, then I doubt that it will
        raise my times at all. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Subject: I broke the UWR Hi! I suspect alot of people aren't telling how
        fast they really are now near to the WC. But I think that it doesn't
        matter for me. When we will be on stage in the WC it won't matter what
        record we have. I think that most people will be maybe 2 seconds slower
        than their best avg. So that's why I post this. Don't think I will
        repeat this in the WC... Today I broke the unofficial world record. I
        haven't cubed much lately and I thought that I should practise some so I
        wouldn't be slower. So I made a few averages. At first my avg was
        something like 18.2 or so. But in an hour my times were much better.
        Here are my times: 15.74 17.83 17.53 14.69 16.99 16.25 (14.19) 15.7 18.7
        14.83 14.83 (18.83) = 16.31 Four times below 15 seconds and no one above
        19! That has never happened before. Non of the solves was lucky btw. The
        strange thing was that I during this session talked with a friend in the
        phone. I may not have been a very active speaker, but I answered
        questions and saying "yes " or "no" while I was solving the cube. This
        may have had the effect that I wasn't "thinking" so much, and instead my
        brain took care of the rest. I couldn't understand that it went so fast
        but it did. Someone else who have similar experiences? David Wesley

        Gilles, this is Mirek. You've got the point. I've solved cube in less
        than 30 moves several times recently. It usually takes me couple of
        hours and the overall time depends on my concentration, mind condition
        and luck. I am observing that the time for solution is shrinking with my
        experience, however. I looked into one challenge from Fewest Moves
        Challenges that had an old winner Guus Razoux with 27 moves solution
        (see FMC Results for 04/07/03) and I found my 24 moves solution in about
        1 hour (between midnight and 1am). Scrambling Algorithm: R B L F (D'
        R)x6 (L B)x6 (U' F')x6 Solution: D2 L2 F D2 F' D B2 L' D' B' D' B U2 B'
        D' L' D' U' L U B L B' L2 Sure, I may struggle with other challenges for
        4 hours to get under 30 moves. My solution for this week challenge took
        me little bit more. If I have measured the time it would have been about
        2 to 3 hours. I am not revealing the number of moves now, you'll see on
        Friday. ;-) Mirek Goljan --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Some time ago I tried to start a thread about this, but without success:
        http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/3153 It
        seems other speedcubists are not that interested in this aspect of
        defining records, which I find a bit a bit strange because it seems so
        crucial. Records need a definite start and a definite finish, and
        starting and finishing with the cube in your hands will make those two
        "instants" almost impossible to identify. I think the speedstack timers
        will probably work quite well but serious contenders had better start
        practicing! I could be wrong, but it seems to me that using the
        speedstack timers results in something fairly similar to what I
        proposed. S. &gt; &gt;If you ask me, you should make it so that the
        timer starts when the &gt;cube is lifted and stops when the cube is put
        down. Because most of &gt;us aren't used to putting our hands in a
        specific location before, &gt;and putting them back after. &gt; &gt;---

        would have to post RWC questions here then. There are probably people

        However... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I joined the the wc2003 group
        ages ago when it started, and was &gt; &gt; &gt; checking it regularly
        (not as often as this group). Then one day, &gt; &gt; my &gt; &gt; &gt;
        access suddenly disappeared. I couldn't get into it anymore. I &gt; &gt;
        never &gt; &gt; &gt; bothered trying to find out what happened though,
        because this &gt; &gt; group &gt; &gt; &gt; was so active that
        (sometimes) I had trouble keeping up with all &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; posts here. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't know if this
        happened to anyone else, but if so, it might &gt; &gt; &gt; partially
        explain why people post stuff here instead of there?? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Having said this, I suspect the main reason people post RWC stuff &gt;
        &gt; &gt; here because this is (at least I think it is?) the most active
        &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; group, and probably the one that more people
        join and check. &gt; &gt; Probably &gt; &gt; &gt; most people would
        automatically post their cube topics here, &gt; &gt; &gt; regardless of
        whether there's a specific sub-group (eg. RWC, &gt; blind- &gt; &gt;
        &gt; folded cubing). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jasmine. &gt; &gt;

        &gt;From Mirek: Some of you noticed that the solution I gave in my
        previous posting was incorrect. This is because I rotated the cube
        before solving. The following move is correct (hopefully :-)): B2 D2 R
        B2 R' B L2 D' B' L' B' L F2 L' B' D' B' F' D F L D L' D2 (24) A short

        Mirek Goljan &gt; Gilles, &gt; this is Mirek. &gt; You've got the point.
        I've solved cube in less than 30 moves &gt; several times recently. It
        usually takes me couple of hours and the &gt; overall time depends on my
        concentration, mind condition and luck. I &gt; am observing that the
        time for solution is shrinking with my &gt; experience, however. I
        looked into one challenge from Fewest Moves &gt; Challenges that had an
        old winner Guus Razoux with 27 moves solution &gt; (see FMC Results for
        04/07/03) and I found my 24 moves solution in &gt; about 1 hour (between
        midnight and 1am). &gt; Scrambling Algorithm: R B L F (D' R)x6 (L B)x6
        (U' F')x6 &gt; Solution: D2 L2 F D2 F' D B2 L' D' B' D' B U2 B' D' L' D'
        U' L U B L &gt; B' L2 &gt; Sure, I may struggle with other challenges
        for 4 hours to get under &gt; 30 moves. &gt; My solution for this week
        challenge took me little bit more. If I &gt; have measured the time it
        would have been about 2 to 3 hours. I am &gt; not revealing the number
        of moves now, you'll see on Friday. ;-) &gt; Mirek Goljan &gt; &gt; ---

        so i've known how to solve the rubik's cube for maybe 8 months or so
        now. i've never done any speedcubing stuff, i just know the long methods
        (where you only have to memorize 3 or 4 algorithms). i dont have a
        special cube or anything, just whatever kind they were selling at KB
        toys. no special lubes or anything. i can usually do the cube in under 3
        minutes, but i'd like to get faster. memorizing all of those algorithms
        seems a bit more then im willing to take on right now, but i do have
        some questions that i think might help me out. one part that slows me
        down a lot is getting the first face. usually i solve for one color, and
        then swap some of the cubies around (take one out, then put it back in
        where it needs to go)... obviously the slow way of going about things.
        i've heard most speedcubers get the initial 'cross' in about 7 moves...
        but i dont see how to do that. does anyone have any tips for me? i dont
        know how to do it besides doing it one edge at a time, which would
        obviously take more than 7 moves. any helpful hints for the first face,
        or any part of the cube really... anything that i can do without having
        to memorize 40 algorithms... would be greatly appreciated. im shooting
        for a sub-2 minute time, and i think i'll be pretty happy. thanks, jeff

        There are a few methods that require very few algorithms to be
        memorized. Lars Petrus' is the best, in my humble opinion.
        www.lar5.com/cube There is also a corners first method that requires

        obviously the slow way of going about things. Yes, for the first layer,
        instead of just solving for one color only and replacing cubies until it
        is all solved, at first you might want to try using the standard cross
        (solving the edges). At this point in your cubing, don't even worry
        about using minimizing moves (for the cross), that number will go down
        the more you solve it. Also, for the cross part of your solution, take
        10-15 seconds and examine the cube to try and plan out at least two
        edges of the cross, that will help your time as well. I would also
        recommend solving your cross on the bottom (or left) because you can see
        another face (as opposed to solving it on the top) and therefore more
        edges, leading to reduced time and moves for that part. If you are still
        solving the cross on the top, I suggest you adjust your method
        immediatly. Another benefit of solving the cross on the bottom, is the
        finger shorcuts associated with solving the corners (or corner-edge
        pairs). Just position the corner above (cross on bottom) the correct
        position, and do a three move finger shortcut (R U R' or L' U' L) to
        place the corner in the right spot. This will allow you to solve the
        first layer in 10 or 15 seconds once you get the hang of the shortcuts
        (you need some silicone spray, check out Dan Knight's page for
        instructions on creating a good, fast, loose cube). Once you have the
        first layer (with no algorithms mind you), you can solve the second
        layer using only one algorithm (and its inverse). With the first layer
        on bottom, just position the edge piece you want to solve (learn to
        avoid "seeing" edge pieces that have your last layer color in them) so
        that whatever color is not in the top layer lines up correctly with the
        center piece and do one of the following: (U' L') (U L' U) (R' U' R):
        places edge lined up with right face. or (U R) (U' R' U') (F' U F):
        places edge lined up with front face. For a better visual understanding
        of these algorithms/situations, check out the second and third
        algorithms (I think) on speedcubing.com's F2L algorithm section. For the
        last layer, just use (and speed up, "triggerize") the moves you already
        know. Using this method I averaged 40 seconds (that's the much improved
        second layer algorithms I listed, much better/shorter than the ones
        listed in the Rubik's hint book that comes with the cube, and I used the
        last four algs in the book: 2-corner swap, 3-corner shuffle, and
        right/left edge flip). Once you get this down and under a minte, I
        recommend learning Dan Knight's intermediate last layer solution (about
        9 algorithms), then his Advanced (about 20), the you will be ready for
        the expert (2 look LL solution, 13/21 + 40/57 algorithms!). If you are
        unfamiliar or unclear about anything, you can post here to ask for
        clarification or email me. Basically the beginning of "the speed" starts
        with a well lubed cube, lots of research and reading, determination, and
        practice! Good luck and I hope this was somewhat helpful while
        longwinded. -Nathan.

        in response to james potter... the method i currently use is the one
        depicted at
        http://www.chrisloanshome.8m.com/Rubics_Cube/cube_complete.htm ...im not
        sure what it's called. i looked at the lars method earlier today, but it
        seems really different from what im already doing, i think id rather
        stick to the method i already use, modified a bit of course. thanks for
        your help tho =] in response to nathan... these hints seem like they
        should help me! i think i'll have to give them a lot of practice though.
        i usually work with the first layer on top (i dont do the 'cross' yet)
        until i solve the first two layers, then flip it over and have the
        bottom on top. i can see the benefit of adjusting it so the cross is on
        the left or bottom, but it will take some getting used to, since my
        finger already know the algorithm with the cross on top, so i dont have
        to think about it too much. ill get the hang of it though. sometimes
        when solving the cube i have a piece that should be in my top layer on
        bottom, and i have to mess up some of the top pieces to get the bottom
        one in place... if that makes sense. the same problem occurs when i have
        the piece i want in the 'top' row (so that the cubie is permuted
        incorrectly). are there any helpful algorithms for these? or am i just
        looking at this from the wrong perspective? and you have the three
        finger shortcuts for getting all of the corners in the right place...
        these seem helpful, but what algorithms do you use to permute the corner
        to make sure the colors are facing the right direction? also, the
        notation you mentioned (U R' F, etc) is always in relation to how you
        hold the cube, correct? or is it standard no matter how you hold the
        cube? thanks much! jeff z PS where is dan knight's page?

        remember when I used to solve the cross, I used have 'algorithms' as
        well. However, try not to think of/use algorithms to solve the cross.
        Try to do it intuitively. Just pick one edge at at time, line it up with
        the appropriate middle/center cubie, and rotate that face to the
        bottom...over and over and over and over and done. &gt; sometimes when
        solving the cube i have a piece that should be in my &gt; top layer on
        bottom, and i have to mess up some of the top pieces to &gt; get the
        bottom one in place... if that makes sense. The only way I can see that
        happening is if you are not solving the cross 'correctly' (All four edge
        pieces lining up correctly with the middle/center cubie) or completely
        (all four edges solved = cross). Because once you have the cross, you
        don't have to remove/move any edge pieces to finish up the remaining
        first layer corners. Just double check to see if your cross is
        complete/correct. &gt; the same problem occurs when i have the piece i
        want in the 'top' row (so &gt; that the cubie is permuted incorrectly).
        are there any helpful &gt; algorithms for these? or am i just looking at
        this from the wrong &gt; perspective? I am not sure about this problem,
        could you clarify it a little bit more? &gt; and you have the three
        finger shortcuts for getting all of the &gt; corners in the right
        place... these seem helpful, but what &gt; algorithms do you use to
        permute the corner to make sure the colors &gt; are facing the right
        direction? Once again, they aren't really algorithms, just maniuplating
        the first layer corner pieces into positions. Once again, try to "not
        see" the corners for the last layer, only the first (ie: my bottom layer
        is white, and I only look ("see") white corner pieces. The key to
        positioning them and setting them up for the quick triggers I
        mentioned...is simply getting them in the top layer (cross on bottom)
        and having your bottom layer color facing either left or right. (Assume
        you use white for the cross from now on, and you have yellow opposite,
        for easier explanations) Once you have a white corner piece in the top
        layer and it is facing left or right (the white side of the cubie),
        simply rotate the top layer until that corner piece is directly above
        where it goes. Still assuming the white is facing left or right on the
        top layer, you will know that it is in the correct position because the
        color to the right/left of the white (on the same corner cube) will
        match the center/middle cubie. Then it is in the correct location, and
        do one of those triggers. Do it slowly and watch how it places the
        corner. If you have corners with white facing up (as opposed to
        left/right) in the top layer, just move the top layer so that that
        corner cubie is over an unsolved (empty) corner. Now you can do a quick
        move (you will eventually triggerize it) to fix it (make the white face
        left or right). You can do one of the following (with a corner where
        white is facing up and above an empty/unsolved corner: R U2 R' U' or L'
        U2 L U They both do exactly the same thing. But do them slowly at first
        and watch how thow four moves positions it correctly. &gt; also, the
        notation you mentioned (U R' F, etc) is always in relation &gt; to how
        you hold the cube, correct? or is it standard no matter how &gt; you
        hold the cube? Yes, the "standard" notation always refers to your
        current orientation (how you are currently holding the cube). &gt; PS

        Hey everyone. I just wanted to make a quick post about a revelation of
        sorts that I have had recently. For anyone that is interested in speed
        solving, I want to take the time to emphasize exactly how utterly and
        completely important the quality of your cube is to your skill as a
        speed cubist. I have recently made some pretty big improvements, after a
        very very very long stretch of static times, and I now know why. Anyway
        for those of you who don't know, I had been stuck with a personal best
        average of 22.0 seconds for about 2 years straight. This was on a worn
        out cube that I had been using since I first started cubing (1998).
        Anyway I was able to improve down to the high 21's on this cube but then
        I switched to a studio cube. As I am continually breaking in this studio
        cube my times have gotten consistently better. What made me want to send
        this post is that I lubed my cube last night, then all of a sudden I set
        a new personal best average today. Compared to my old junky beat up
        cube, my new cube after this last lubing/cleaning is AMAZING! It is
        effortless to look ahead and go fast without having to worry about the
        alignment of the faces, not popping it because it is so loose, etc.. So
        anyway to make a long story short I was stuck in the low twenties for 2
        years simply because I had a crappy cube. Now that I have seen what a
        really good cube feels like I know what was holding me back. So I just
        want to say that if any of you are like me and are cubing on a loose
        cube (the corners rattle when you shake it) and you're stuck at a
        barrier, don't do what I did!!! Don't keep using your old cube and
        getting frustrated that you're not improving! Chunk your old cube (well,
        save it for one handed cubing :-P) but get a new speed cube if you want
        to improve. I have now realized that a good speed cubist not only has to
        have all the algorithms come to you like second nature, dextrous hands
        and all that, but SOOOO much of getting good times is having a good
        cube. So in short, don't be like me. Chunk your cube when it wears out
        for a better one if you want to improve. I'll get off my soap box now,
        Chris

        I use a half year old studio cube. Now I don't know how your old cube
        behaved, but for me the cube's condition doesn't matter so much. I set
        my new record on a bit loose but "not lubed in a long time" cube. This
        cube is not very good at all at the moment, but still I can make very
        fast times. Maybe it has to do with that it is getting a bit loose, so
        it doesn't matter so much that I haven't lubed it lately. I agree with
        you that it's much easier and feels better with a lubed cube though...

        &gt;i've heard most &gt;speedcubers get the initial 'cross' in about 7
        moves... but i dont &gt;see how to do that. does anyone have any tips
        for me? Hi Jeff: some good stuff has been posted already. Here's a few
        other thoughts. S. 1. Always start with the same colour. That way you
        will start to learn where they go without having to aling the cross
        until it is finished. I always start with white. 2. Practice this: start
        with a cross, and without looking at the cube scramble it 2 moves, then
        look at it, solve it in you head, and then actually do it on the cube
        (OK that should be fairly easy). Move to 3, 4, and then 5 moves. Once
        you can do 5 moves this way, you will probably be able to do the cross
        for real in under 8 moves nearly all the time. And if you are really
        keen, see if can do it in your head for 6, or 7 moves! 3. Katsu has some
        tips on the cross that you might find helpful:
        http://www5.gateway.ne.jp/~katsu-k/cubemainf.html ... and then follow
        the link at the top "CROSS" You can run his page through a translator
        but there is no need to bother if all you want to do is look at his java
        applets on the cross.

        asier for me as well. Oh yes, my cubes should be paired. 490 cubes, that
        makes 245 parity pairs. Oh, I wish I could have 1000 cubes in 500 such
        pairs! Than things like a third iteration Menger Sponge, more symmetric
        Bohemian Pyramid and a Ladry Staircase having 125 (27) blocks with 8
        (27) cubes per block would be within my reach. Right now all I can do is
        drem about such designs. Hana a kostky --- In

        know, I had &gt; been stuck with a personal best average of 22.0 seconds
        for about 2 &gt; years straight. This was on a worn out cube that I had
        been using &gt; since I first started cubing (1998). Anyway I was able
        to improve &gt; down to the high 21's on this cube but then I switched
        to a studio &gt; cube. As I am continually breaking in this studio cube
        my times have &gt; gotten consistently better. What made me want to send
        this post is &gt; that I lubed my cube last night, then all of a sudden
        I set a new &gt; personal best average today. Compared to my old junky
        beat up cube, &gt; my new cube after this last lubing/cleaning is
        AMAZING! It is &gt; effortless to look ahead and go fast without having
        to worry about &gt; the alignment of the faces, not popping it because
        it is so loose, &gt; etc.. &gt; &gt; So anyway to make a long story
        short I was stuck in the low twenties &gt; for 2 years simply because I
        had a crappy cube. Now that I have seen &gt; what a really good cube
        feels like I know what was holding me back. &gt; So I just want to say
        that if any of you are like me and are cubing &gt; on a loose cube (the
        corners rattle when you shake it) and you're &gt; stuck at a barrier,
        don't do what I did!!! Don't keep using your old &gt; cube and getting
        frustrated that you're not improving! Chunk your &gt; old cube (well,
        save it for one handed cubing :-P) but get a new &gt; speed cube if you
        want to improve. I have now realized that a good &gt; speed cubist not
        only has to have all the algorithms come to you like &gt; second nature,
        dextrous hands and all that, but SOOOO much of getting &gt; good times
        is having a good cube. &gt; &gt; So in short, don't be like me. Chunk
        your cube when it wears out for &gt; a better one if you want to

        I'm 33 years old. I guess that qualifies as older in this group. My best
        average (set a couple weeks ago) is 25.9. I'm arriving in Toronto on the
        Tuesday evening before the event, and my wife is coming in on Thursday
        evening. She doesn't cube much. I taught her how, but she has to read
        from the notes I made for her while she is solving. A while back, I used
        to see if I could solve a 5x5x5 before she finished the 3x3x3, and she
        started beeathing me, so she was probably solving in 4.5 or 5 minutes.

        I got a new cube and lubed it, but I think it's too loose now. The other
        sides turn when I don't want them to. How can you delube it, or make it
        not so loose? And this is a new one, so it doesn't have screws under the
        caps. By the way, where can I get a studio cube? I know Ton's site, but

        I call this my "GIVE ME A BREAK" speech.... sorry if it offends anyone,
        which it probably will. Ok let me get a complete clearification on this
        (the sticker issue): 1. We are allowed to use any brand of cube we like.
        (Even if its dimensions are slightly bigger or larger? Or maybe a
        separate or sub- category competition for those using key chain cubes.)
        We are not allowed to sand the outside? One of my main cubes was
        accidently dropped last yr and there's bit of corner missing, would this
        be allowed? How about all WHITE plastic instead of black? 2. I know we
        must show the rubik's logo on the white side (would we get disqualified
        if we place the logo on a corner piece instead of center?). What about
        the tiled cubes? Can we just stick the stickers over the tiles? Are we
        allowed to to leave our normal stickers underneth? I use custom
        stickers, if the stickers are too large and show after placing
        "official" stickers over them will we be disquaified? What if a sticker
        or two falls off as we solve? We we be need to justify using group
        theory that it is in deed solved? Maybe people with tiled cubes or
        painted cubes need to razorblade or scratch them off before comming. If
        we want the official stickers early, will we have to pay the usual $4.99
        for them? Probably not, then is there a limit to how many will be
        provided, if not I'd want a few dozen sets to resicker some of the
        nearly 20 cubes I have around the house (not including tiled or painted
        ones of course). 3. Do we need to use the official color scheme? What if
        I don't like their tint of orange? I heard that we ARE allowed our own
        color scheme. What about something like White opposite Black(no
        sticker)? I KNOW someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on their
        main cubes. Heck, I bet someone wants Green opposite Purple! Opps no
        purple in the Hessport/Seventowns stash... Guess they'll just have to
        leave it blank. "Hemm not all 6 'official' colors are present, you are
        hearby disqualified!" Honestly though, the normal stickers that come
        with new Hessport cubes are terrible, crappy, and disturbingly tikalish
        to the fingers when they peel; wouldn't last a week on my cube (I solve
        ~250 times a day). It'd be a sad day when all the cubists in the world
        prescribe to the identical stickers and color scheme. Ultimately variety
        is the spice of life and diversity needs to be upheld. What's next...?
        "All competitors must solve corners first." !@#$ that. Anyone out there
        have an opinion on this issue? BTW I am working on obtaining a mass
        production of pre-cut VINYL stickers (1,200), I might bring part the
        stash to Toronto if it gets finished in time. (still seeking a
        satisfactory orange...) -Doug (attending an extremely liberal college

        AND WE ARE OFF!!!! Here are some excellent questions!! But where have

        lord man - where have you been!!...Only Rubiks brand products are
        permitted!!..no clones!!..period....this has been indicated on this
        forum a million times along with the rubiks web site....Key Chain
        Cubes???? NOT!!! sanding - where have you been man....."no cutting
        corners" ie if an edge is 90 degree's your not permitted to round it
        off. sanding is only permitted to sand any imperfections of the plastic.
        3x3x3 cubes will be inspected prior to each round. the plastic is
        black!!! anything else is a knockoff. if you break a cubie replace it or
        it will be replaced for you upon your arrival if you dont have spare
        parts.... &gt; &gt; 2. I know we must show the rubik's logo on the white
        side (would we &gt; get disqualified if we place the logo on a corner
        piece instead of &gt; center?). danG - where have you been man! ...The
        Rubiks brand places the logo on the white centre sticker. if you show up
        and its on a corner it will be relocated!!! I wont disqualify someone
        because of a sticker in the wrong place...... What about the tiled
        cubes? Can we just stick the stickers &gt; over the tiles? danG-yes Are
        we allowed to to leave our normal stickers &gt; underneth? I use custom
        stickers, if the stickers are too large and &gt; show after placing
        "official" stickers over them will we be &gt; disquaified? danG-where
        have you been man!! - would you like a couple of NEW cubes???? Can we
        have a closeup picture of this beast your referring to which you will be
        using as your primary cube for the event..If it looks like crap then we
        will resticker the whole thing before hand.. Its the sponsors that want
        all the cubes to look pretty(dont make no difference to me personally)..
        So for 2 days lets all just do what we have to do and get this over
        with..... What if a sticker or two falls off as we solve? danG-make that
        happen and i will give you 20 bucks!! you will be supplied stickers as
        required!!!........they ar enot for sale i dont believe but i can ask
        for them to bring a few hundred rolls ok!! danG-get a new cube for the
        event! 3. Do we need to use the official color scheme? What if I don't
        like &gt; their tint of orange? danG-where have you been man!!! NO NO NO
        NO NO NO NO...if you dont like THEIR TINT OF ORANGE THEN BRING YOUR
        OWN!!!... come on dude!!!!..its a sticker.......you come here...we have

        Yes, it was primarily trial and error with some exceptions. For example,
        the three-cycle of edges and corners is a simple commutator. The
        permutations Z, H, E, and N (see my page) are "logical" moves as well.
        Some of the remaining permutation algorithms could be derived from
        algorithms that swap two corners and two edges and looking at cyclical
        versions of them. The trial and error is not that inefficient, btw, even
        though it might sound as the "monkey typing Shakespeare" example. What
        we did was to mess up the first two layers) using, say, 5-6 moves and
        then we tried to assemble them again but, of course, not using the
        inverse 5-6 moves. This is, actually, pretty efficient and one does not
        need THAT much time to invent most of the moves. What helps you is that
        with most moves, you killed two positions with one stone (the inverse
        usually solved a different position). Jessica &gt; since i'm a software
        engineer, if the cube were invented today, i'd &gt; have a decent
        solution on paper within a couple days or so. because &gt; it's possible
        to write software that runs on 3 GHz computers to find &gt; algorithms.
        &gt; &gt; but back in the early 80's, i mean how the heck did the
        old-timers &gt; find some of those 10-14 move algs for OLL/PLL? i assume
        it wasn't &gt; done on the computers of the day... were they found by
        accident / &gt; trial and error (gasp)? or was there some organized
        system for &gt; discovering a reasonably short algorithm for a given

        The discussion about how the algorithms were discovered during the early
        80's reminded me of our early attempts to find all short algorithms that
        swap two edges and two corners (e2c2). Such algorithms were important
        for LL permutations T, V, F, R, J, and Y. During the early 80's, we knew
        that the shortest algorithm of this type must have at least 13 quarter
        moves (the number of q-moves must be odd). By writing the algorithms in
        some alphabetically smallest form, we tried to find all different e2c2
        moves that had 13 q-moves. Then, we started collecting all e2c2 moves
        with 15 q-moves. The list of algorithms that we collected is on my page
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/c2e2.html All of those algorithms
        were found using the trial and error method I described in my previous
        posting, btw :) I am curious if the list for 13 q-moves is complete (I
        think it is). I suspect that the list of 15-q moves is not complete. I
        wonder if anyone was interested in writing a computer program that would
        find all such algorithms. (Note that inversions, reflections, face
        renaming, and cyclical permutations of one algorithms form one "class of
        equivalence" and thus should be identified as one algorithm). Jessica

        geting the rings together from a &gt; scrambeled state???? &gt; &gt; How
        can you get it under 2 seconds without breaking the darn &gt;
        thing!!!?!?!?! &gt; &gt; Jake It's 9 moves start to end so 2 seconds is
        very achievable. Start with two columns and 4 rows: XX XX XX XX with the
        correct side opposite (there are two ways to do this but for one way up
        the moves won't work so you can quickly learn which way to go). 1. Push
        away from you to form a ring. 2. Rotate the ring once clockwise. 3. Push
        away from you to get a column like at the start. (As I recall, if it was
        the wrong way up to start with you can't get this far.) 4. Flip the top
        row and bottom row towards you. It'll now look like XX XX (each X is two
        squares deep). 5. Flip the two columns from the back round. XXXX XXXX 6.
        Continue with the right one. XXX XXX (the right column is 2 deep) 7.
        Flip the lower right X up XXX XXX (the upper right X is 3 deep) 8. and
        then left XXX XXX (the upper right X and the upper middle X are 2 deep)
        9. Then pull the upper two X's up. XX XXX XXX It should now be solved
        (and I mean properly, not just into the correct shape.) It's years since
        I've seen one of these, but I'm sure that's the way I used to do it.
        What exactly constitutes a move is arguable. 1.-3. above can be done
        very fast and so can 4.-9. In some sense you can practically trigger the
        entire solution. You can solve it with your feet too. My best time was
        18 seconds. It's better to do it on a fixed surface (not a rug for
        instance) but one with a bit of friction (not smooth wood) if you are
        solving with your feet.

        times, but I hope that seventowns/hessport isn't the only cube company
        sponsoring the event. I've bought a few cubes from Meffert's myself and
        most people here would agree that their Eastsheen 2x2 is the best 2x2
        availible. Are you saying that if I bring a Meffert's cube (or something
        else if they are sponsoring) that it'll be trashed. &gt; the plastic is
        black!!! anything else is a knockoff. ***actually no, as DJ also
        noticed, Rubiks.com manufactured a white plastic promotional cube. &gt;
        danG - where have you been man! ...The Rubiks brand places the logo &gt;
        on the white centre sticker. if you show up and its on a corner it &gt;
        will be relocated!!! I wont disqualify someone because of a sticker &gt;
        in the wrong place...... ***this brings me to the central question: is
        this a comittee controlled even or company/sponsor controlled even???
        &gt; danG-where have you been man!! - would you like a couple of NEW
        &gt; cubes???? &gt; &gt; Can we have a closeup picture of this beast
        your referring to which &gt; you will be using as your primary cube for
        the event..If it looks &gt; like crap then we will resticker the whole
        thing before hand.. &gt; &gt; Its the sponsors that want all the cubes
        to look pretty(dont make no &gt; difference to me personally).. ***I
        don't think people should be made to purchase a new cube for competition
        (if it comes to it I think if someone shows up cubeless, a speedcube
        should be made availible to them for the competition by the committee).
        Ok, my own main cubes are fine but I'm just asking these questions for
        my curiousity and to help others. I don't want somebody to get
        disqualified for something as stupid as not using the logo sticker.
        Also, according to your post (#3504), "Please note that these rules have
        been in place for years and the sticker portion was a request of our
        sponsor's for the camera's." If that is the case then why not leave it
        open-ended and subjective. I think if people here are smart enough to
        solve a cube then they should be able to tell if their cube looks like
        crap and do something about it. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; I
        think my wacky stickers - 9/16" with deep 3/32" fillets, are AWSOME (at
        least less chance of accidental peeling). So the sponsors should just
        calm down; I don't think anyone here's going to intentionally make
        Erno's great invention look like it's been through hell. &gt; What if a
        sticker or two falls off as we solve? &gt; &gt; danG-make that happen
        and i will give you 20 bucks!! you will be &gt; supplied stickers as
        required!!!........they ar enot for sale i dont &gt; believe but i can
        ask for them to bring a few hundred rolls ok!! ***USD or CAD? then again
        my stickers were custom made (non- rubiks.com) to prevent this. &gt;
        danG-get a new cube for the event! ***Unless someone's main cube is
        pop-happy or in more then 21 pieces {27 if Studio, not counting
        screws/springs}, then I don't see the need. &gt; danG-where have you
        been man!!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO...if you dont &gt; like THEIR TINT OF
        ORANGE THEN BRING YOUR OWN!!!... &gt; &gt; come on dude!!!!..its a
        sticker.......you come here...we have &gt; camera's....if your cube
        looks like crap then like i said....we make &gt; it look good.....
        ***according to post #3448: "2-Your own cube in your own colored
        scheme(must use original color's)." So perhaps bringing my own
        orange/pink will cause a hassle. Exactly, it IS a sticker so why is the
        committee making a big deal? &gt; I heard that we ARE allowed our own
        color &gt; &gt; scheme. &gt; &gt; danG-where have you been man !!
        WRONG!!! ONLY RUBIKS PRODUCED COLOR &gt; SCHEMES PERMITTED!!
        ***according to your post #3448: "Therefore there is now "NO COLOR
        SCHEMES RESTRICTIONS" for this championship." You say Rubik's
        produced... please clarify. There are/were several "rubiks" companies:
        Arxon, Ideal, Hessport, Meffert, etc... and some knock-offs I admit, but
        my first cube was a knock-off gift and I guess after 7-8 years it has
        stuck. &gt; What about something like White opposite Black(no sticker)?
        &gt; &gt; I KNOW someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on their
        main &gt; &gt; cubes. Heck, I bet someone wants Green opposite Purple!
        &gt; danG-buy a new cube!!!!! ***I know of cubists faster then me that
        prefer odd color schemes. Heck, people I've taught want to get fast
        enough and make up their own 'signature' color schemes as I have done.
        &gt; danG-good lord...the above is crap and you know it!!!...we have
        been &gt; adhearing to 2 color schemes in the mainstream for 25
        years.... &gt; your the only one with a color scheme issue and sticker
        issue that &gt; all can be easlily resolved.... ***I seriously doubt I'm
        the only one with these types of issues (which should be clarified
        before and not during the event), perhaps there are people out there
        that are just afraid to ask for fear of sounding like a nag. Also, when
        reading the official rules on Rubikschamps.com I was shocked at how
        short all of it was. &gt; see you in a month......you just set yourself
        up for a major cube &gt; inspection when you get here...thats for
        sure.... ***No my cube should be perfectly fine according to the various
        rules set by the committee, at least at one point in time or another
        (during redraftings of the rules)... &gt; haha ***Another crucial point:
        I think the questions posed by people in this fourm shouldn't be taken
        lightly. If nothing else, at least it'll be good practice for when a
        crowd of cubists come up to the front desk with a marid of complaints.
        If questions were answered more carefully, we would have significantly
        least pots that start with "I still have a question about..." For
        instance back in March, someone asked about color blindness and special
        stickers, pointing out that just because you or I don't have it, that it
        is indeed common among the general population. [post #3450,3454] "that
        would mean that they have a red/green deficiency in their eyes and
        should have it looked at..." I think that condition is permenent and the
        responds could have been more forthcomming. Hopefully, when someone with
        other disabilities will get the proper attention at the event. ***By the
        way, in regards to the external sanding... After 4 years with the same
        cube, the sweat, amino acids, and soda in contact with my "standard
        Hessport" cube has surely left its edges and verticies noticibly
        rounded. Heck it's a millimeter or two smaller then the two new ones I
        bought last night. On a lighter note, Homer Heads arn't so great for
        speedcubing... as I just found out (as I was watching the Simpsons
        nontheless) :). -Doug P.S. [post #5436]"main stream cubes are
        black...always have been always will be...." ***What so great about
        mainstream? If everyone thought so, who would be brave enough to jump
        out of an airplane with a cube?

        learn which &gt; way to go). &gt; &gt; 1. Push away from you to form a
        ring. &gt; 2. Rotate the ring once clockwise. &gt; 3. Push away from you
        to get a column like at the start. (As I &gt; recall, if it was the
        wrong way up to start with you can't get this &gt; far.) &gt; 4. Flip
        the top row and bottom row towards you. &gt; It'll now look like &gt; XX
        &gt; XX &gt; (each X is two squares deep). &gt; 5. Flip the two columns
        from the back round. &gt; XXXX &gt; XXXX By taking advantage of how the
        wires criss-cross, it's possible to twist it in an abnormal way, and do
        all of the above in one move. This is what enables very fast times. (Be
        careful not to break it!) For this move, finger positions are very
        important. Looking from above, I'll lable the important squares: ABXC
        XXDE Thumbs on top: A = left thumb E = right thumb Fingers on bottom: A
        = left index finger B = left middle finger C = right index finger D =
        right middle finger Hold the thing flat in front of you, face up, like
        so: ---- With your fingers in place, bend it like this: -v- Move the
        left and right sides in closer until they meet in the middle, but keep
        your middle fingers firm, pushing their squares in opposite directions.
        Now, this is hard to draw in ascii art, but it should look something
        like this: __ /\ Now here's the trick, and be aware that this could
        damage your puzzle if done incorrectly, so don't hold me responsible!
        With your whole right hand, you need to twist the right half of the
        puzzle toward you, in an anti-clockwise (counter-clockwise) motion. This
        is assisted by your right thumb, right index finger, and left middle
        finger all applying force to twist it in that direction. DO NOT FORCE
        IT! With very little force, you can immediately see whether it's started
        to do the trick. If not, go back and make sure all the wires are aligned
        again. If done correctly, the wires should not come off. Now keep
        twisting. It should move very easily. Once you've almost twisted it the
        complete 180 degrees, you will need some further assistance from the
        back sides of your fingers, in both your left and right hands. Now
        touching the backs of your fingers, you'll see two flaps (each made up
        of two squares). Your right hand needs to flip the flap that's above it
        over to the left side, and your left hand needs to flip the flap that's
        below it (your left hand is upsidedown) to the right side. This should
        enable you to complete the 180 twist. Your thumbs will be pressed
        between the flaps. Remove them. You should now have a shape like this:
        XX XX Simply unfold it into: XXXX XXXX And proceed. Once you get better
        at it, you can use your thumbs to unfold it instead of removing them.
        This can all be done in a split second. Of course, the rest can be done
        very quickly since you just hold onto one X: &gt; 6. Continue with the
        right one. &gt; XXX &gt; XXX &gt; (the right column is 2 deep) &gt; 7.
        Flip the lower right X up &gt; XXX &gt; XXX &gt; (the upper right X is 3
        deep) you mean flip the upper right X down XXX XXX (the lower right X is
        3 deep and the upper right X is 1 deep) 8. and then left XX XXX There
        are also a few steps you missed after this one: 8.1 and then continue
        move the same X up XXX XXX (the upper middle X is 3 deep) 8.2 then right
        XXX XXX (the upper middle and upper right Xs are both 2 deep) Then your
        final step: &gt; 9. Then pull the upper two X's up. &gt; XX &gt; XXX

        beast your referring to &gt; which &gt; &gt; you will be using as your
        primary cube for the event..If it looks &gt; &gt; like crap then we will
        resticker the whole thing before hand.. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Its the
        sponsors that want all the cubes to look pretty(dont make &gt; no &gt;
        &gt; difference to me personally).. &gt; &gt; ***I don't think people
        should be made to purchase a new cube for &gt; competition (if it comes
        to it I think if someone shows up cubeless, &gt; a speedcube should be
        made availible to them for the competition by &gt; the committee). Ok,
        my own main cubes are fine but I'm just asking &gt; these questions for
        my curiousity and to help others. I don't want &gt; somebody to get
        disqualified for something as stupid as not using &gt; the logo sticker.
        Also, according to your post (#3504), "Please note &gt; that these rules
        have been in place for years and the &gt; sticker portion was a request
        of our sponsor's for the camera's." If &gt; that is the case then why
        not leave it open-ended and subjective. I &gt; think if people here are
        smart enough to solve a cube then they &gt; should be able to tell if
        their cube looks like crap and do &gt; something about it. Beauty is in
        the eye of the beholder; I think my &gt; wacky stickers - 9/16" with
        deep 3/32" fillets, are AWSOME (at least &gt; less chance of accidental
        peeling). So the sponsors should just calm &gt; down; I don't think
        anyone here's going to intentionally make Erno's &gt; great invention
        look like it's been through hell. &gt; &gt; &gt; What if a sticker or
        two falls off as we solve? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; danG-make that happen and
        i will give you 20 bucks!! you will be &gt; &gt; supplied stickers as
        required!!!........they ar enot for sale i &gt; dont &gt; &gt; believe
        but i can ask for them to bring a few hundred rolls ok!! &gt; &gt;
        ***USD or CAD? then again my stickers were custom made (non- &gt;
        rubiks.com) to prevent this. &gt; &gt; &gt; danG-get a new cube for the
        event! &gt; &gt; ***Unless someone's main cube is pop-happy or in more
        then 21 pieces &gt; {27 if Studio, not counting screws/springs}, then I
        don't see the &gt; need. &gt; &gt; &gt; danG-where have you been man!!!
        NO NO NO NO NO NO NO...if you dont &gt; &gt; like THEIR TINT OF ORANGE
        THEN BRING YOUR OWN!!!... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come on dude!!!!..its a
        sticker.......you come here...we have &gt; &gt; camera's....if your cube
        looks like crap then like i said....we &gt; make &gt; &gt; it look
        good..... &gt; &gt; ***according to post #3448: "2-Your own cube in your
        own colored &gt; scheme(must use original color's)." So perhaps bringing
        my own &gt; orange/pink will cause a hassle. Exactly, it IS a sticker so
        why is &gt; the committee making a big deal? &gt; &gt; &gt; I heard that
        we ARE allowed our own color &gt; &gt; &gt; scheme. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        danG-where have you been man !! WRONG!!! ONLY RUBIKS PRODUCED &gt; COLOR
        &gt; &gt; SCHEMES PERMITTED!! &gt; &gt; ***according to your post #3448:
        "Therefore there is now "NO COLOR &gt; SCHEMES RESTRICTIONS" for this
        &gt; championship." You say Rubik's produced... please clarify. There
        &gt; are/were several "rubiks" companies: Arxon, Ideal, Hessport, &gt;
        Meffert, etc... and some knock-offs I admit, but my first cube was a
        &gt; knock-off gift and I guess after 7-8 years it has stuck. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; What about something like White opposite Black(no sticker)? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I KNOW someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on their
        main &gt; &gt; &gt; cubes. Heck, I bet someone wants Green opposite
        Purple! &gt; &gt; danG-buy a new cube!!!!! &gt; &gt; ***I know of
        cubists faster then me that prefer odd color schemes. &gt; Heck, people
        I've taught want to get fast enough and make up their &gt; own
        'signature' color schemes as I have done. &gt; &gt; &gt; danG-good
        lord...the above is crap and you know it!!!...we have &gt; been &gt;
        &gt; adhearing to 2 color schemes in the mainstream for 25 years....
        &gt; &gt; your the only one with a color scheme issue and sticker issue
        that &gt; &gt; all can be easlily resolved.... &gt; &gt; ***I seriously
        doubt I'm the only one with these types of issues &gt; (which should be
        clarified before and not during the event), perhaps &gt; there are
        people out there that are just afraid to ask for fear of &gt; sounding
        like a nag. Also, when reading the official rules on &gt;
        Rubikschamps.com I was shocked at how short all of it was. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; see you in a month......you just set yourself up for a major cube
        &gt; &gt; inspection when you get here...thats for sure.... &gt; &gt;
        ***No my cube should be perfectly fine according to the various &gt;
        rules set by the committee, at least at one point in time or another
        &gt; (during redraftings of the rules)... &gt; &gt; &gt; haha &gt; &gt;
        ***Another crucial point: I think the questions posed by people in &gt;
        this fourm shouldn't be taken lightly. If nothing else, at least &gt;
        it'll be good practice for when a crowd of cubists come up to the &gt;
        front desk with a marid of complaints. If questions were answered &gt;
        more carefully, we would have significantly least pots that start &gt;
        with "I still have a question about..." For instance back in March, &gt;
        someone asked about color blindness and special stickers, pointing &gt;
        out that just because you or I don't have it, that it is indeed &gt;
        common among the general population. [post #3450,3454] "that would &gt;
        mean that they have a red/green deficiency in their eyes &gt; and should
        have it looked at..." I think that condition is permenent &gt; and the
        responds could have been more forthcomming. Hopefully, when &gt; someone
        with other disabilities will get the proper attention at the &gt; event.
        &gt; &gt; ***By the way, in regards to the external sanding... After 4
        years &gt; with the same cube, the sweat, amino acids, and soda in
        contact with &gt; my "standard Hessport" cube has surely left its edges
        and verticies &gt; noticibly rounded. Heck it's a millimeter or two
        smaller then the &gt; two new ones I bought last night. &gt; &gt; On a
        lighter note, Homer Heads arn't so great for speedcubing... as &gt; I
        just found out (as I was watching the Simpsons nontheless) :). &gt; &gt;
        -Doug &gt; &gt; P.S. [post #5436]"main stream cubes are black...always
        have been &gt; always will be...." &gt; &gt; ***What so great about
        mainstream? If everyone thought so, who would &gt; be brave enough to
        jump out of an airplane with a cube?

        under 2 seconds without breaking the darn &gt; &gt; &gt; thing!!!?!?!?!
        &gt; &gt; I remember being able to get it done in close to 1 second.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; with the correct side opposite (there are two ways to do
        this but &gt; &gt; for one way up the moves won't work so you can
        quickly learn which &gt; &gt; way to go). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Push
        away from you to form a ring. &gt; &gt; 2. Rotate the ring once
        clockwise. &gt; &gt; 3. Push away from you to get a column like at the
        start. (As I &gt; &gt; recall, if it was the wrong way up to start with
        you can't get this &gt; &gt; far.) &gt; &gt; 4. Flip the top row and
        bottom row towards you. &gt; &gt; It'll now look like &gt; &gt; XX &gt;
        &gt; XX &gt; &gt; (each X is two squares deep). &gt; &gt; 5. Flip the
        two columns from the back round. &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt; &gt;
        By taking advantage of how the wires criss-cross, it's possible to twist
        &gt; it in an abnormal way, and do all of the above in one move. This is
        what &gt; enables very fast times. &gt; &gt; (Be careful not to break
        it!) &gt; &gt; For this move, finger positions are very important.
        Looking from above, &gt; I'll lable the important squares: &gt; &gt;
        ABXC &gt; XXDE &gt; &gt; Thumbs on top: &gt; &gt; A = left thumb &gt; E
        = right thumb &gt; &gt; Fingers on bottom: &gt; &gt; A = left index
        finger &gt; B = left middle finger &gt; C = right index finger &gt; D =
        right middle finger &gt; &gt; Hold the thing flat in front of you, face
        up, like so: &gt; &gt; ---- &gt; &gt; With your fingers in place, bend
        it like this: &gt; &gt; -v- &gt; &gt; Move the left and right sides in
        closer until they meet in the middle, &gt; but keep your middle fingers
        firm, pushing their squares in opposite &gt; directions. Now, this is
        hard to draw in ascii art, but it should look &gt; something like this:
        &gt; __ &gt; /\ &gt; &gt; Now here's the trick, and be aware that this
        could damage your puzzle if &gt; done incorrectly, so don't hold me
        responsible! With your whole right &gt; hand, you need to twist the
        right half of the puzzle toward you, in an &gt; anti-clockwise
        (counter-clockwise) motion. This is assisted by your &gt; right thumb,
        right index finger, and left middle finger all applying &gt; force to
        twist it in that direction. &gt; &gt; DO NOT FORCE IT! With very little
        force, you can immediately see whether &gt; it's started to do the
        trick. If not, go back and make sure all the &gt; wires are aligned
        again. If done correctly, the wires should not come &gt; off. &gt; &gt;
        Now keep twisting. It should move very easily. Once you've almost &gt;
        twisted it the complete 180 degrees, you will need some further &gt;
        assistance from the back sides of your fingers, in both your left and
        &gt; right hands. Now touching the backs of your fingers, you'll see two
        &gt; flaps (each made up of two squares). Your right hand needs to flip
        the &gt; flap that's above it over to the left side, and your left hand
        needs to &gt; flip the flap that's below it (your left hand is
        upsidedown) to the &gt; right side. This should enable you to complete
        the 180 twist. Your &gt; thumbs will be pressed between the flaps.
        Remove them. You should now &gt; have a shape like this: &gt; &gt; XX
        &gt; XX &gt; &gt; Simply unfold it into: &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt; XXXX &gt;
        &gt; And proceed. &gt; &gt; Once you get better at it, you can use your
        thumbs to unfold it instead &gt; of removing them. This can all be done
        in a split second. &gt; &gt; Of course, the rest can be done very
        quickly since you just hold onto &gt; one X: &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Continue
        with the right one. &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; (the right
        column is 2 deep) &gt; &gt; 7. Flip the lower right X up &gt; &gt; XXX
        &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; (the upper right X is 3 deep) &gt; &gt; you mean
        flip the upper right X down &gt; XXX &gt; XXX &gt; (the lower right X is
        3 deep and the upper right X is 1 deep) &gt; &gt; 8. and then left &gt;
        XX &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; There are also a few steps you missed after this
        one: &gt; &gt; 8.1 and then continue move the same X up &gt; XXX &gt;
        XXX &gt; (the upper middle X is 3 deep) &gt; &gt; 8.2 then right &gt;
        XXX &gt; XXX &gt; (the upper middle and upper right Xs are both 2 deep)
        &gt; &gt; Then your final step: &gt; &gt; &gt; 9. Then pull the upper
        two X's up. &gt; &gt; XX &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; Ryan

        In chess tournaments aren't they supposed to use only vinyl chess
        boards, with only a limited number of chess sets available (they have to
        conform to certain specs)? I think we're fighting here over stuff so
        trivial, that we're not even really talking about anything. I agree that
        a cubist having their own cube and color scheme makes your cube
        personalized. A good chess player will probably have a "good board" that
        they are very proud of, yet they still use a vinyl chess board and an
        aproved chess set in a tournament. How is it any different for a cubist
        to have their own "good cube" but use an "official" cube in a
        competition? It seems to work for the chess community - why are we even
        fighting over this? Just do it the same way the chess players do, use
        your own personalized cube, but also train on a competition "approved"
        cube every now and then to be sharp if you choose to go to a
        competition. If a cubist decides to not go to a competition, they
        wouldn't have to worry about practicing on an approved cube. I just
        think all this bickering is getting no where. Blast me if you want, but
        seriously what's the problem here? Chris --- In

        IS a sticker so why is &gt; &gt; the committee making a big deal? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I heard that we ARE allowed our own color &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; scheme. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; danG-where have you been
        man !! WRONG!!! ONLY RUBIKS PRODUCED &gt; &gt; COLOR &gt; &gt; &gt;
        SCHEMES PERMITTED!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***according to your post #3448:
        "Therefore there is now "NO COLOR &gt; &gt; SCHEMES RESTRICTIONS" for
        this &gt; &gt; championship." You say Rubik's produced... please
        clarify. There &gt; &gt; are/were several "rubiks" companies: Arxon,
        Ideal, Hessport, &gt; &gt; Meffert, etc... and some knock-offs I admit,
        but my first cube was &gt; a &gt; &gt; knock-off gift and I guess after
        7-8 years it has stuck. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about something
        like White opposite Black(no sticker)? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I KNOW
        someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on their main &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; cubes. Heck, I bet someone wants Green opposite Purple! &gt; &gt;
        &gt; danG-buy a new cube!!!!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***I know of cubists
        faster then me that prefer odd color schemes. &gt; &gt; Heck, people
        I've taught want to get fast enough and make up their &gt; &gt; own
        'signature' color schemes as I have done. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        danG-good lord...the above is crap and you know it!!!...we have &gt;
        &gt; been &gt; &gt; &gt; adhearing to 2 color schemes in the mainstream
        for 25 years.... &gt; &gt; &gt; your the only one with a color scheme
        issue and sticker issue &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; all can be easlily
        resolved.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***I seriously doubt I'm the only one
        with these types of issues &gt; &gt; (which should be clarified before
        and not during the event), &gt; perhaps &gt; &gt; there are people out
        there that are just afraid to ask for fear of &gt; &gt; sounding like a
        nag. Also, when reading the official rules on &gt; &gt; Rubikschamps.com
        I was shocked at how short all of it was. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see
        you in a month......you just set yourself up for a major cube &gt; &gt;
        &gt; inspection when you get here...thats for sure.... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ***No my cube should be perfectly fine according to the various
        &gt; &gt; rules set by the committee, at least at one point in time or
        &gt; another &gt; &gt; (during redraftings of the rules)... &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; haha &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***Another crucial point: I
        think the questions posed by people in &gt; &gt; this fourm shouldn't be
        taken lightly. If nothing else, at least &gt; &gt; it'll be good
        practice for when a crowd of cubists come up to the &gt; &gt; front desk
        with a marid of complaints. If questions were answered &gt; &gt; more
        carefully, we would have significantly least pots that start &gt; &gt;
        with "I still have a question about..." For instance back in March, &gt;
        &gt; someone asked about color blindness and special stickers, pointing
        &gt; &gt; out that just because you or I don't have it, that it is
        indeed &gt; &gt; common among the general population. [post #3450,3454]
        "that would &gt; &gt; mean that they have a red/green deficiency in
        their eyes &gt; &gt; and should have it looked at..." I think that
        condition is &gt; permenent &gt; &gt; and the responds could have been
        more forthcomming. Hopefully, when &gt; &gt; someone with other
        disabilities will get the proper attention at &gt; the &gt; &gt; event.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***By the way, in regards to the external sanding...
        After 4 years &gt; &gt; with the same cube, the sweat, amino acids, and
        soda in contact &gt; with &gt; &gt; my "standard Hessport" cube has
        surely left its edges and verticies &gt; &gt; noticibly rounded. Heck
        it's a millimeter or two smaller then the &gt; &gt; two new ones I
        bought last night. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a lighter note, Homer Heads
        arn't so great for speedcubing... as &gt; &gt; I just found out (as I
        was watching the Simpsons nontheless) :). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. [post #5436]"main stream cubes are black...always
        have been &gt; &gt; always will be...." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***What so
        great about mainstream? If everyone thought so, who &gt; would &gt; &gt;
        be brave enough to jump out of an airplane with a cube?

        2 seconds without breaking the darn &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing!!!?!?!?!
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I remember being able to get it done in close to 1
        second. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the correct side opposite (there
        are two ways to do this but &gt; &gt; &gt; for one way up the moves
        won't work so you can quickly learn &gt; which &gt; &gt; &gt; way to
        go). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Push away from you to form a ring.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Rotate the ring once clockwise. &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Push
        away from you to get a column like at the start. (As I &gt; &gt; &gt;
        recall, if it was the wrong way up to start with you can't get &gt; this
        &gt; &gt; &gt; far.) &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Flip the top row and bottom row
        towards you. &gt; &gt; &gt; It'll now look like &gt; &gt; &gt; XX &gt;
        &gt; &gt; XX &gt; &gt; &gt; (each X is two squares deep). &gt; &gt; &gt;
        5. Flip the two columns from the back round. &gt; &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt;
        &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By taking advantage of how the wires
        criss-cross, it's possible to &gt; twist &gt; &gt; it in an abnormal
        way, and do all of the above in one move. This is &gt; what &gt; &gt;
        enables very fast times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Be careful not to break
        it!) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For this move, finger positions are very
        important. Looking from &gt; above, &gt; &gt; I'll lable the important
        squares: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ABXC &gt; &gt; XXDE &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Thumbs on top: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A = left thumb &gt; &gt; E = right
        thumb &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fingers on bottom: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A =
        left index finger &gt; &gt; B = left middle finger &gt; &gt; C = right
        index finger &gt; &gt; D = right middle finger &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hold
        the thing flat in front of you, face up, like so: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        ---- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With your fingers in place, bend it like this:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -v- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Move the left and right
        sides in closer until they meet in the &gt; middle, &gt; &gt; but keep
        your middle fingers firm, pushing their squares in opposite &gt; &gt;
        directions. Now, this is hard to draw in ascii art, but it should &gt;
        look &gt; &gt; something like this: &gt; &gt; __ &gt; &gt; /\ &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Now here's the trick, and be aware that this could damage your
        &gt; puzzle if &gt; &gt; done incorrectly, so don't hold me responsible!
        With your whole &gt; right &gt; &gt; hand, you need to twist the right
        half of the puzzle toward you, in &gt; an &gt; &gt; anti-clockwise
        (counter-clockwise) motion. This is assisted by your &gt; &gt; right
        thumb, right index finger, and left middle finger all applying &gt; &gt;
        force to twist it in that direction. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DO NOT FORCE
        IT! With very little force, you can immediately see &gt; whether &gt;
        &gt; it's started to do the trick. If not, go back and make sure all the
        &gt; &gt; wires are aligned again. If done correctly, the wires should
        not &gt; come &gt; &gt; off. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now keep twisting. It
        should move very easily. Once you've almost &gt; &gt; twisted it the
        complete 180 degrees, you will need some further &gt; &gt; assistance
        from the back sides of your fingers, in both your left &gt; and &gt;
        &gt; right hands. Now touching the backs of your fingers, you'll see two
        &gt; &gt; flaps (each made up of two squares). Your right hand needs to
        flip &gt; the &gt; &gt; flap that's above it over to the left side, and
        your left hand &gt; needs to &gt; &gt; flip the flap that's below it
        (your left hand is upsidedown) to the &gt; &gt; right side. This should
        enable you to complete the 180 twist. Your &gt; &gt; thumbs will be
        pressed between the flaps. Remove them. You should &gt; now &gt; &gt;
        have a shape like this: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; XX &gt; &gt; XX &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Simply unfold it into: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt; &gt; XXXX
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And proceed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once you get better
        at it, you can use your thumbs to unfold it &gt; instead &gt; &gt; of
        removing them. This can all be done in a split second. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Of course, the rest can be done very quickly since you just hold
        &gt; onto &gt; &gt; one X: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Continue with the
        right one. &gt; &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; &gt; (the
        right column is 2 deep) &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Flip the lower right X up &gt;
        &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; &gt; (the upper right X is 3
        deep) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you mean flip the upper right X down &gt; &gt;
        XXX &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; (the lower right X is 3 deep and the upper
        right X is 1 deep) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. and then left &gt; &gt; XX
        &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are also a few steps you missed
        after this one: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8.1 and then continue move the same
        X up &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; (the upper middle X is 3
        deep) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8.2 then right &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; XXX
        &gt; &gt; (the upper middle and upper right Xs are both 2 deep) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Then your final step: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9. Then
        pull the upper two X's up. &gt; &gt; &gt; XX &gt; &gt; &gt; XXX &gt;
        &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ryan

        completely different colours from the other cube, not just a reordering.
        I can, for example, easily hold the QWERTY keyboard layout and the
        Korean Hangul keyboard layout in my mind simultaneously. Ryan

        or maybe it wouldn't take that long, i don't really know. so if one can
        solve the cube, you should be able to plan out any sort of arrangement
        of the cube, and make your cube look like that. confused? here's what i
        mean. i was trying to get my cube to spell out JOY, but im not sure if
        it's even possible. i got the JO without too much trouble as seen at
        http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~jzemla/cube.jpg but im having trouble
        seeing if it's even possible to spell out the Y on the last face (to the
        right of the O probably, but on top or bottom would work if the other
        way is impossible). ideally, the Y would have a 2 color contrast like
        the J and O, but im beginning to think that's not possible. any help
        would be much appreciated. thanks! jeff

        you to form a ring. &gt; &gt; 2. Rotate the ring once clockwise. &gt;
        &gt; 3. Push away from you to get a column like at the start. (As I &gt;
        &gt; recall, if it was the wrong way up to start with you can't get this
        &gt; &gt; far.) &gt; &gt; 4. Flip the top row and bottom row towards
        you. &gt; &gt; It'll now look like &gt; &gt; XX &gt; &gt; XX &gt; &gt;
        (each X is two squares deep). &gt; &gt; 5. Flip the two columns from the
        back round. &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt; &gt; By taking advantage
        of how the wires criss-cross, it's possible to twist &gt; it in an
        abnormal way, and do all of the above in one move. This is what &gt;
        enables very fast times. &gt; &gt; (Be careful not to break it!) &gt;
        &gt; For this move, finger positions are very important. Looking from
        above, &gt; I'll lable the important squares: &gt; &gt; ABXC &gt; XXDE
        &gt; &gt; Thumbs on top: &gt; &gt; A = left thumb &gt; E = right thumb
        &gt; &gt; Fingers on bottom: &gt; &gt; A = left index finger &gt; B =
        left middle finger &gt; C = right index finger &gt; D = right middle
        finger &gt; &gt; Hold the thing flat in front of you, face up, like so:
        &gt; &gt; ---- &gt; &gt; With your fingers in place, bend it like this:
        &gt; &gt; -v- &gt; &gt; Move the left and right sides in closer until
        they meet in the middle, &gt; but keep your middle fingers firm, pushing
        their squares in opposite &gt; directions. Now, this is hard to draw in
        ascii art, but it should look &gt; something like this: &gt; __ &gt; /\
        &gt; &gt; Now here's the trick, and be aware that this could damage your
        puzzle if &gt; done incorrectly, so don't hold me responsible! With your
        whole right &gt; hand, you need to twist the right half of the puzzle
        toward you, in an &gt; anti-clockwise (counter-clockwise) motion. This
        is assisted by your &gt; right thumb, right index finger, and left
        middle finger all applying &gt; force to twist it in that direction.
        &gt; &gt; DO NOT FORCE IT! With very little force, you can immediately
        see whether &gt; it's started to do the trick. If not, go back and make
        sure all the &gt; wires are aligned again. If done correctly, the wires
        should not come &gt; off. &gt; &gt; Now keep twisting. It should move
        very easily. Once you've almost &gt; twisted it the complete 180
        degrees, you will need some further &gt; assistance from the back sides
        of your fingers, in both your left and &gt; right hands. Now touching
        the backs of your fingers, you'll see two &gt; flaps (each made up of
        two squares). Your right hand needs to flip the &gt; flap that's above
        it over to the left side, and your left hand needs to &gt; flip the flap
        that's below it (your left hand is upsidedown) to the &gt; right side.
        This should enable you to complete the 180 twist. Your &gt; thumbs will
        be pressed between the flaps. Remove them. You should now &gt; have a
        shape like this: &gt; &gt; XX &gt; XX &gt; &gt; Simply unfold it into:
        &gt; &gt; XXXX &gt; XXXX &gt; &gt; And proceed. &gt; &gt; Once you get
        better at it, you can use your thumbs to unfold it instead &gt; of
        removing them. This can all be done in a split second. &gt; &gt; Of
        course, the rest can be done very quickly since you just hold onto &gt;
        one X: &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Continue with the right one. &gt; &gt; XXX &gt;
        &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; (the right column is 2 deep) &gt; &gt; 7. Flip the
        lower right X up &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; (the upper right
        X is 3 deep) &gt; &gt; you mean flip the upper right X down &gt; XXX
        &gt; XXX &gt; (the lower right X is 3 deep and the upper right X is 1
        deep) &gt; Right, it's a long time since I did it. I thought my move
        count was a bit short. So it would be as you say. I've only seen them
        once in the last 13-15 years or so, so my memory is a bit rusty. &gt; 8.
        and then left &gt; XX &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; There are also a few steps you
        missed after this one: &gt; &gt; 8.1 and then continue move the same X
        up &gt; XXX &gt; XXX &gt; (the upper middle X is 3 deep) &gt; &gt; 8.2
        then right &gt; XXX &gt; XXX &gt; (the upper middle and upper right Xs
        are both 2 deep) &gt; &gt; Then your final step: &gt; &gt; &gt; 9. Then
        pull the upper two X's up. &gt; &gt; XX &gt; &gt; XXX &gt; &gt; XXX &gt;

        By which I mean a position which is reached using an algorithm w whose
        order is prime. My scribblings which (disclaimer) were calculated using
        pencil and paper without calculator etc. (and not checked) indicate that
        there are 170,911,549,183 positions of order 2 (and 10,938,339,147,775
        in the supergroup) 59,807,090,449,754 positions of order 3
        133,637,037,514,624 positions of order 5 153,245,476,454,400 positions
        of order 7 44,590,694,400 positions of order 11 Of course there are no
        positions of order p where p is a prime greater than 11. It follows that
        there are 346,905,106,662,361 positions of prime order and for the
        supergroup there are 357,672,534,260,953 positions of prime order. Now
        (I used Mathematica for this) 346,905,106,662,361 has just 3 prime
        factors (one is pretty easy to find, so I'm ashamed to say I went
        straight to the machine), 13 is the smallest and 3,400,087 and 7848331
        are the other 2. 13 is the smallest prime not to divide the order of the
        group. According to Mathematica 357,672,534,260,953 is prime, though
        whether that just means it is a probable prime I'm not sure as I don't
        know what method it is using to test here. Since the number is quite
        small (having a square root of less than 1,900,000) I imagine it
        conceivably could have used a sieve of Erastosthenes method, although
        I'm sure it didn't, so I'm willing to believe it probably is prime and
        thus that the number of prime positions in the supergroup is prime.

        If the cube has been re-stickered with officially provided stickers,
        including the centre white logo sticker, then would this be satisfactory
        (assuming that it's black plastic)? If someone had an old cube that had
        been restickered ages ago and they can't remember what the original
        stickers/packaging looked like, then how would the competitor know
        whether the cube was okay to use in the competition? If a cube has the
        official Rubik's stickers (as provided at the competition), including
        the Rubik's logo on the centre white, then would this cube be any less
        'eligible' for competition than a new Rubik's cube? Also, when the
        stickers are provided, I assume that we're free to choose whether we
        want to use (for example) a white opp. yellow configuration or white
        opp. blue configuration? The rules seem to suggest that this is okay, so
        no need to reply on this point unless I've got it wrong. Jasmine. --- In

        After about a month, I was &gt; &gt;achieving 50 words per minute, down
        from 100 wpm with QWERTY. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Then I decided I wanted to
        switch back to QWERTY. During my transition &gt; &gt;back, my mind
        became totally messed up and I couldn't type at all. I &gt; &gt;simply
        couldn't hold two layouts in my mind simultaneously as they were &gt;

        brain &gt; &gt;back to QWERTY. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;My point is, I think
        cube colour layouts are similar to this. If you &gt; &gt;have two
        objects that are the same shape, but the elements are &gt;
        &gt;different, you may have trouble holding them both in your mind at
        once. &gt; &gt;This goes for different cubes, different keyboards, and
        different phone &gt; &gt;numbers (if they have the same number of
        digits). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;An exception to this is if the elements are
        completely different in each &gt; &gt;object. For example, if the
        colours in one cube are completely different &gt; &gt;colours from the
        other cube, not just a reordering. I can, for example, &gt; &gt;easily
        hold the QWERTY keyboard layout and the Korean Hangul keyboard &gt;
        &gt;layout in my mind simultaneously. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ryan &gt; &gt;

        I have two questions about the new cubes produced for the competition. I
        apologise if these questions have been asked and answered before, I had
        a bit of a look around and didn't see them, but I might have just missed
        something. Anyway... What colour configuration are the new cubes? What
        I'm most interested in is are they white opp. yellow or white opp. blue?
        (I'm assuming that they are one of these two?) If we did want to use one
        of the new cubes, when would we be able to purchase them? At

        packaging, the person spent 15 seconds scrambling it (because it was in
        a solved state in the box) and then 30 seconds solving it, would their
        time for this record be 30 seconds or 45 seconds? This question is
        probably not very relevant for something like the 4x4x4 because the
        initial scrambling time when it first comes out of the box is negligible
        (well, this was certainly true for me anyway), but with something like
        the 2x2x2, any 3x3x3 speedcuber would solve it quickly straight away (as

        whoever said that thing about all cubes are different. I even saw
        someone who had a purple face and a black face on his cube. It's
        original, and it'll show whoever happens to be watching the TV that we
        care about our cubes, and we make them special for our own personal

        became totally messed up and I couldn't type at all. I &gt; &gt;simply
        couldn't hold two layouts in my mind simultaneously as they were &gt;
        &gt;conflicting with each other. It took several weeks to rewire my
        brain &gt; &gt;back to QWERTY. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;My point is, I think
        cube colour layouts are similar to this. If you &gt; &gt;have two
        objects that are the same shape, but the elements are &gt;
        &gt;different, you may have trouble holding them both in your mind at
        once. &gt; &gt;This goes for different cubes, different keyboards, and
        different phone &gt; &gt;numbers (if they have the same number of
        digits). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;An exception to this is if the elements are
        completely different in each &gt; &gt;object. For example, if the
        colours in one cube are completely different &gt; &gt;colours from the
        other cube, not just a reordering. I can, for example, &gt; &gt;easily
        hold the QWERTY keyboard layout and the Korean Hangul keyboard &gt;
        &gt;layout in my mind simultaneously. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ryan &gt; &gt;

        I think that it just means first solving it, however you choose to do
        it. I chose to work it out for myself, and it took me several months.
        I've taught three people to solve it, but they've all lost interest, so
        they don't cube any more. I feel sorry for them. --- In

        I'm pretty sure that it doesn't mean mixing it up first. Because you
        don't start the time with a 3x3x3 when it's solved, and stop it after
        it's been mixed up then solved again. So why would you with a 2x2x2?

        I'm sorry... I didn't mean to come off as bickering about this subject,
        i just thought it was a funny topic because i'm sure all of us can
        pertain to the "grundgy" more "personalized" cube that we all prefer
        using. I thought it was kinda funny how the previous posts came off as
        we are dressing up our cubes for some sort of ritzi party wearing their
        expensive suites and dresses and makeup just to make them camera
        appealing. I;m totally cool with a spruced out cube but yeah... maybe
        its my sense of humor or something. Oh well. Speaking of sprucing up..
        Are we competitors all going to have to be preped. I myself could use a
        new set of "stickers" to wear and maybe the rubik's logo slapped on my
        forehead.... hehehe ok I'm sorry, I'll put my sense of humor away for

        that is the case then why not leave it open-ended and subjective. &gt; I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; think if people here are smart enough to solve a cube

        with deep 3/32" fillets, are AWSOME (at &gt; &gt; least &gt; &gt; &gt;
        less chance of accidental peeling). So the sponsors should just &gt;
        &gt; calm &gt; &gt; &gt; down; I don't think anyone here's going to
        intentionally make &gt; &gt; Erno's &gt; &gt; &gt; great invention look

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I KNOW someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on

        just afraid to ask for fear &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; sounding like a nag.
        Also, when reading the official rules on &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubikschamps.com
        I was shocked at how short all of it was. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        practice for when a crowd of cubists come up to the &gt; &gt; &gt; front
        desk with a marid of complaints. If questions were answered &gt; &gt;
        &gt; more carefully, we would have significantly least pots that start
        &gt; &gt; &gt; with "I still have a question about..." For instance back
        in &gt; March, &gt; &gt; &gt; someone asked about color blindness and
        special stickers, &gt; pointing &gt; &gt; &gt; out that just because you
        or I don't have it, that it is indeed &gt; &gt; &gt; common among the
        general population. [post #3450,3454] "that &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt;
        mean that they have a red/green deficiency in their eyes &gt; &gt; &gt;
        and should have it looked at..." I think that condition is &gt; &gt;
        permenent &gt; &gt; &gt; and the responds could have been more
        forthcomming. Hopefully, &gt; when &gt; &gt; &gt; someone with other

        &gt; &gt; my "standard Hessport" cube has surely left its edges and &gt;
        verticies &gt; &gt; &gt; noticibly rounded. Heck it's a millimeter or
        two smaller then the &gt; &gt; &gt; two new ones I bought last night.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a lighter note, Homer Heads arn't so
        great for speedcubing... &gt; as &gt; &gt; &gt; I just found out (as I
        was watching the Simpsons nontheless) :). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        DanG, Now I'm confused (but entertained too!)... does the sanding rule
        pertain to not being allowed to sand the inside of the cube, the
        outside, or both? I thought the issue was whether we could sand the
        inside, but this post now makes me wonder. Thanks, Adam Original

        this may seem a little bit off the topic, but a good point. i just got a
        message that had for its subject speed cubing group, so i thought that
        it was cube-related. but it was not, if you understand what im trying to
        say. i dont know how this could have happened, but we need to figure out
        how this can happen.

        All, I've read these posts, and thought I'd weigh in. This is not a
        traditional Olympic sport. This is a competition for a puzzle that is
        sold as a toy, and the sponsor is a toy company. Therefore, they want to
        make sure their product looks good--remember that they are sponsoring
        this because they're hoping it will make more people want to buy their
        product. If people want to exercise more flexibility here, the time to
        take up that issue is BEFORE any sponsor agreement is signed, not a
        month prior to the competition. Let's remember that if there's a contest
        next year and give Dan a break this year. And remember that it could be
        worse... I'm sure most of you have seen that picture of the 1982
        competition with everyone wearing the same t-shirt with the tacky design
        that looked about a size too small on everyone! Original Message: Date:

        What are we doing... entering a cube into a fasion show??? I think weird
        color schemes and tiles and paints are what makes the cube has its own
        personality reflected throught the cuber. I'm sure all of you know what
        i'm talking about. We knoe our cubes better then ourselves, a scratch on
        the yellow blue piece, a dimple on a red, a squeak from the green
        center. I think it would be neat as a person watching to see all the
        different 3x3s and what the cubers have done. It brings a kind of
        mysteryious ownership sense when seing someone elses cube. Maybe I'm

        Well, there could be a couple of reasons. One, someone just put in the
        subject line " [Speed cubing group] " and sent a message. The second way
        could be that someone opened up a telnet program and spoofed an
        e-mail... like I could send an e-mail that looks like it came from you,
        with the e-mail address and everything looking right, but you did not
        send it. I could send an e-mail to this group such that Yahoo believes
        the e-mail came from Chris Hardwick because the e-mail is "from" him.
        The message could be "I am canceling this group." The less-wise would
        believe it. The only difference is my IP address could be looked up in
        the headers. James Sibley --------- "My mother never saw the irony in

        Simple, chess is a two-player competition and the cube is not. So for
        chess standards must be set. And even so, debated and agreed upon by a
        committee (hopefully without "company/sponsor" interference). And I'm
        sure back in '97, Deep Blue wouldn't have mined if Kasparov played it
        using his chose of board and pieces, brand and style. Because in this
        case it'd be the equivalent of a single player event as is cubing. -Doug

        for the competition &gt; by &gt; &gt; &gt; the committee). Ok, my own

        &gt; &gt; somebody to get disqualified for something as stupid as not
        using &gt; &gt; &gt; the logo sticker. Also, according to your post
        (#3504), "Please &gt; &gt; note &gt; &gt; &gt; that these rules have
        been in place for years and the &gt; &gt; &gt; sticker portion was a

        that is the case then why not leave it open-ended and subjective. &gt; I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; think if people here are smart enough to solve a cube

        crap and do &gt; &gt; &gt; something about it. Beauty is in the eye of
        the beholder; I think &gt; &gt; my &gt; &gt; &gt; wacky stickers - 9/16"
        with deep 3/32" fillets, are AWSOME (at &gt; &gt; least &gt; &gt; &gt;
        less chance of accidental peeling). So the sponsors should just &gt;
        &gt; calm &gt; &gt; &gt; down; I don't think anyone here's going to
        intentionally make &gt; &gt; Erno's &gt; &gt; &gt; great invention look

        a sticker or two falls off as we solve? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        There &gt; &gt; &gt; are/were several "rubiks" companies: Arxon, Ideal,

        I guess after 7-8 years it has stuck. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        What about something like White opposite Black(no sticker)? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I KNOW someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on
        their &gt; main &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cubes. Heck, I bet someone
        wants Green opposite Purple! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; danG-buy a new

        'signature' color schemes as I have done. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; danG-good lord...the above is crap and you know it!!!...we have
        &gt; &gt; &gt; been &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adhearing to 2 color schemes in

        with a color scheme issue and sticker issue &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; all can be easlily resolved.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        ***I seriously doubt I'm the only one with these types of issues &gt;
        &gt; &gt; (which should be clarified before and not during the event),
        &gt; &gt; perhaps &gt; &gt; &gt; there are people out there that are
        just afraid to ask for fear &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; sounding like a nag.
        Also, when reading the official rules on &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubikschamps.com
        I was shocked at how short all of it was. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; see you in a month......you just set yourself up for a major &gt;
        cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inspection when you get here...thats for
        sure.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***No my cube should be perfectly

        (during redraftings of the rules)... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        the external sanding... After 4 &gt; years &gt; &gt; &gt; with the same
        cube, the sweat, amino acids, and soda in contact &gt; &gt; with &gt;
        &gt; &gt; my "standard Hessport" cube has surely left its edges and &gt;
        verticies &gt; &gt; &gt; noticibly rounded. Heck it's a millimeter or
        two smaller then the &gt; &gt; &gt; two new ones I bought last night.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a lighter note, Homer Heads arn't so
        great for speedcubing... &gt; as &gt; &gt; &gt; I just found out (as I

        Without financial backing from the sponsors, there is no Toronto! It is
        as simple as that. And who else but a toy company. a cube manufacturer,
        would sponsor such an event? It is logical. I think Dan is doing all he
        can to make this event a success, and I hope it is successful. The
        Championship does more than establish records. It brings new areas of
        the cube the attention of the world, such as new types of speedcubing,
        computer cubing and cube art. That no one could be found whodoes 3d cube
        art is somehing I did not foresee in my wildest dreams and I am truly
        amazed. I hope qe will also see underwater cubing, one-handed and feet

        is sold as a toy, and the sponsor is a toy company. &gt; Therefore, they
        want to make sure their product looks &gt; good--remember that they are

        Ok I think it's pretty safe to assume that the gods algorythem for any
        scrambeled cube is, most of the time going to be 18 moves. But what
        about other sizes. For instance, what is the general number for a 2x2x2
        cube, or a 4x4x4? I wonder if there would be a way to graph this, just
        for lack of anything better to do. I think it might be interesting. On a

        this is getting far off topic, but I found a website that shows you how
        to make fun of your cat without them knowing. I tried the one where you
        put a strip of masking tape on their back, and they think they're under
        something so they crawl around on their stomach all day. I couldn't find
        masking tape, so I tried duct tape but it didn't work. --- In

        We should ask the Rubiks company to make a special Rubiks timer pad. The
        cube is on it, then you pick it up and fifteen seconds later it will
        buzz. You put it back, then a countdown on the pad starts, then you pick
        it up, and when you put it back down solved, the timer starts. That
        would be coool. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "gosd123"

        i bought a cube about a week ago, and the stickers are already in shoddy
        condition. my previous cube became un-usable after some of the yellow
        and orange stickers became white from use (making them
        indistinguishable). how do you guys put your cube to constant use and
        still keep the stickers in good condition?

        the only way is to get new stickers. I like to paint them, but if you
        are planning on using this cube for the WC, then you can't paint them.
        &gt;:( Anyway, buy some vinyl tape and cut out squares with an Exacto

        Some stickers are bad, so you would have to change them once a month or
        so. But the good ones last for quite a while. I don't know what kind of
        paint I use. But it stays on for ages. What I did to my best cube is
        take off the plasticky layer on the sticker, then paint over only the
        paper part. This works very well, for me. --- In

        &gt; I suspect alot of people aren't telling how fast they really are
        now &gt; near to the WC. But I think that it doesn't matter for me. When
        we &gt; will be on stage in the WC it won't matter what record we have.
        I &gt; think that most people will be maybe 2 seconds slower than their
        &gt; best avg. So that's why I post this. Don't think I will repeat this
        &gt; in the WC... I sure hope not, for my sake! Just kidding....;) I
        agree, I think people will be at best within .5 seconds of their record
        average, most likely worse. &gt; &gt; Today I broke the unofficial world
        record. I haven't cubed much &gt; lately and I thought that I should
        practise some so I wouldn't be &gt; slower. So I made a few averages. At
        first my avg was something like &gt; 18.2 or so. But in an hour my times
        were much better. Here are my &gt; times: &gt; &gt; 15.74 17.83 17.53
        14.69 16.99 16.25 (14.19) 15.7 18.7 14.83 14.83 &gt; (18.83) = 16.31
        &gt; Awesome times. Congratulations! You are now unofficially the
        fastest cube solver on the planet, ever. &gt; The strange thing was that
        I during this session talked with a &gt; friend in the phone. I may not
        have been a very active speaker, but &gt; I answered questions and
        saying "yes " or "no" while I was solving &gt; the cube. This may have
        had the effect that I wasn't "thinking" so &gt; much, and instead my
        brain took care of the rest. I couldn't &gt; understand that it went so
        fast but it did. Someone else who have &gt; similar experiences? Yes, I
        have had several experiences like this. A few days ago I was sitting
        around chatting with someone during lunch, and I got two averages in the
        17's, in one of which the worst time was a 19. Another day after I
        played an exhausting soccer game, I sat in the back of an open
        convertible with an aggressive driver (again, not your best conditions,)
        and again got an average with only one 19, and the rest 14-18! I think
        this could have very interesting psychological implications for
        speedcubing - that it's good to be a little bit distracted. Maybe I
        should have my friend on a cell phone during the WC... :) Anyway,
        congrats again, and I look forward to meeting you at the WC! Dan

        This timer looks pretty good, although unfortunately I expect one will
        lose around half a second during the picking-up and putting- down times,
        so perhaps in the future we can do something about that. I have written
        a small program in Visual Basic (download the exe file from the "Files"
        section) that times quite well (It's a beta version, lacking many
        features). I also purchased a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard,
        which has a very large central Space Bar, and I use this to do my
        timing. Can we just write our own custom program, and then use these
        keyboards at the WC?
        http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/keyboard/nke_info.asp If we must use
        the SPEEDSTACK pads, I think we can help reduce the time lost if we
        allow the competitor to place the cube on the table in whatever position
        he/she prefers after the inspection time has ended (I assume that will
        be the case?). Another important function required of the timer is that
        it should keep track of multiple end times, in case the competitor
        accidentally puts the cube down unsolved. Then the competitor must pick
        it up, finish solving, and put his/her hands back down. There should be
        a log of all of the timer events received during each solution,
        something that could easily be written in my custom program. -Dan

        yes and no dan re the Seventowns rubiks company....your correct when you
        say managed however your incorrect when you say they are an actual
        rubiks company.. a company manufacterers which Seventowns does
        not..SevenTowns manages inventions.... irrelevant to the question brough
        forth either way.. re your timer statements... today we reach over and
        hit the space bar(most) and reach over and hit the space bar after we
        perform the solve.. same thing with these timers.... personally i dont
        care where the cube is placed..just as long as its solved...there will
        be a square where the cube should be placed inside however we will not
        be hard on that respect...just as long as the timer stops and the cube
        is done..there will be 2 backups to the timers just in case so not to
        worry....i expect you best time either way..haha therefore we dont loose
        anything and will not increse anything by using these timers...... these
        timers look good for the camera and they sure beat out my home made
        design which is just like what you had described....since we did not
        have 150k to manaufacture our own design(in time for the championships)
        we decided to use speedstacks to introduce a brand new timing scheme
        which thus introduces total fairness in a competition... its all a done
        deal in 33 days anyway so lets just do it and get it all done and
        overwith.. we will leave the timer manufacturer to Seventowns for future

        I've been recording my average for the F2L lately trying to get it down
        (currently 24.5 non-speedy). I was wondering if there is an absolute
        worst case situation for the F2L, say where it takes 32 moves to solve
        it. I know that you can improvise a LOT during this stage, but I'm
        talking about essentially using the Fridrich system for matching corner
        edge pairs. Is there a worst case and if so, what is an example of as

        That cube (or perhaps 2 cubes) does not appear to be of a standard color
        scheme, the one in his had had a white-yellow edge, and the solved one
        had a blue-green edge. The coloring of the shown corner of the solved
        cube does not match up with the white-blue scheme either (although
        matches up with mine). I deduce (frame-by-frame) that the cube in the
        guy's hand WAS of white-blue scheme and then physically restickered to
        show it solved (the film had several cuts). I suppose that the people
        who filmed that commercial can't solve or are too lazy to solve a cube
        since they had to incorrectly resticker it in the end. --- In

        I am finally getting around to posting this ;-) On June 12, 2003, I held
        a Rubik's Cube competition in my classes at Temecula Valley High School
        (California). Many of the participants were people with less than 2
        weeks of practice. They each got three trials, with other participants
        scrambling their cubes...fastest time was recorded. Results: 1. David
        Matics 49.02 2. Bill Aanestad 1:05.70 3. Bryan Curiel 1:07.00 The first
        three are experienced cubists...most of the others, as I said above,
        have about 2 weeks experience... 4. Matt Saul 1:21.79 5. John Randall
        1:31.43 6. Robbie Elcome 1:39.97 Eric Totah 1:39.97 8. Kota Washiyama
        1:44.10 (using his own corners first method) 9. Ty Yacoub 1:47.74 10.
        James Whiteside 2:00.32 11. Ryan Tracy 2:02.79 12. Mark Billhofer
        2:28.72 13. John Wardlaw 2:53.20 Due to time constraints, I only allowed
        3 minutes for solving...several other people could do the cube in 5-6
        minutes... During my teaching career, I have probably taught a couple of
        hundred people to do the cube, but it would be difficult to get an exact
        number. I should have recorded all of their names ;-) I didn't teach
        David Matics to do the cube...he has been doing it for several years and
        has a best of about 35 seconds. Many of the people in this years
        competition are juniors (numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9)...I am hoping that

        would I describe this particular one? It would be easiest with some

        Ryan, I am quite sure that there are many people who came up with this
        idea for solving the F2L independently, so it will be next to impossible
        to find the "inventor". I learned about it when I joined the college.
        There were at least 5 guys (all coming from the same high school) doing
        the F2L this way. However, they solved the F2L kind of intuitively using
        lots of auxiliary moves with only a handful of basic intuitive moves. As
        a result, they were not too fast, and so I did not pay attention to this
        idea at first. Then, one day just for fun I tried to solve the F2L using
        this approach and quickly saw the _potential_ of this approach. However,
        it needed a substantial "overhaul". Thus, I developed over a dozen new,
        less obvious algorithms that you can see on my page. It must have been
        somebody from that high school from which the 5 guys came who "invented"
        the idea. Perhaps, we could find out the name if I contact those 5 guys
        and talk to them. Then, we would have to ask Guus about the origin of
        his system and try to decide who was "first" ... Any volunteers for
        this? :) Jessica &gt; I noticed that Guus Razoux Schultz and Jessica
        Fridrich both use the &gt; same approach for the first two layers, and I
        guess many other 1982 &gt; championship contestants also used it. My
        question is, who should I &gt; properly give credit to for thinking this
        idea up? Neither Guus' nor &gt; Jessica's writings say who it was that
        discovered this idea. Jessica &gt; mentioned "someone" showed it to her,
        but didn't mention who. &gt; &gt; Does anyone know the names of one or

        Hi friends, In Holland F2L was first mentioned in the second issue of
        Cubism For Fun (see http://cff.helm.lu/), dated october 1981. In that
        issue Ren√Ø¬ø¬Ω Schoof is acknowledged as the 'inventor'. F2L is fully
        described in the book "De Hongaarse Kubus voor doordraaiers" ("The
        Hungarian Cube for those who cannot stop") by Frans Schiereck, dated
        december 1981. That is including pictures and algorithms. That book is
        the fourth in a set of four books from that author. See
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/collection/Books%20and%20Collectibles/pages/De%20
        Hongaarse%20kubus%20voor%20Doordraaiers.htm in Ton's collection. OLL/PLL
        is first described in the third of the four books: "De Hongaarse Kubus
        voor Gevorderden" ("The Hungarian Cube for the experienced"), dated
        november 1981. Hans Dockhorn and Anneke treep were then acknowledges as
        the 'inventors'. The book features complete tables for OLL and PLL
        (included mirrored cases). But many algorithms are not optimal yet (all
        found by hand!!!). See

        yes, I have that video too. It's a simple, but elegant timing device.
        Since that was at the Korean national Championships, I doubt the timer
        belongs to him though. Nontheless, timers have already been decided for
        the competition. I do wonder (the speedstack site doesn't give a good
        description) about the details of the pads. How wide apart are the palm
        rests spread? What actually stops the timer - pressure-sensitive,
        heat-sensitive, light-sensitve? Althought I might have heard something
        about our cubes needing to be inside some square, it's feasible that a
        competitor would use the solved cube to "tap" the part of the pad to
        stop the timer, what if any would be the consequence of such action?
        Most importantly of all, will teh timer stop after one hand is placed on
        a spot or after both hands are there? -Doug --- In

        glad to finally see some comments about these timers... my response will
        be of 2 scenario's....first is my personal opinion and my Chief
        Organizor statement... my opinion and comments re these timers as i have
        used them are.. the hand pads were you place your hands, in my opinion
        could be spread a part a bit more.. the square box your referring to is
        only a guide(where the cube will be picked up from)......when you solve
        the cube and place your hands back on the hand pads to stop the timers,
        the cube can be placed anywhere on the pad........just make sure you put
        both hands on the hand pads to start and stop the timers... the
        resistance from your hands(body) closes the circuit at the
        start.....thus starting the timer once lifted off pads...... cube solved
        and hands placed back on pads to once again close circuit..........thus
        stopping timer.... when you look at the way we time ourselves these days
        with online timers..there is 1 small problem i have found.....it creates
        the possibility of "false" starts. speedstack timers eliminate this....
        When we solve the cube, we have to reach over and bang on the space
        bar(most of us)......speedstack timers do the same thing....once the
        cube os solved you must reach over with both hands and stop the
        timer.... now the RCC team thought about timing. we looked at previous
        events,online timers,home made timers and speedstacks..... in a world
        class event and the fact that guiness is involved and we have record
        breaking attempts on the table we were faced with a number of issues....
        1-sponsors/owners of rubiks want something that lookes very
        presentable(hence the sticker issues)...the timer used in the Korean
        championships did not meet their "looks" standards(however i thought it
        was a cool looking timer - even though it looked like a bomb)...... 2-We
        did not want to put a timer issue on the table for Guiness to lay down
        the law thus the creating the possibility of us spending thousands on a
        professionally designed and manufactured timer....yes it is very simple
        to make a timer however in the eyes of guiness and the owners,
        presentation is the main key......not what the timer does... We even
        went to speedstacks and requested a specially made timer for our event
        with the possibility of future business down the road (which is still at
        this time a real possibility)... Speedstacks came back and indicated in
        order to produce a prototype it would cost over 50k to re-engineer and
        they also requested a 50,000 timer commitment order because of the
        Rubiks history..along with a 4 month turn around time..... Therefore we
        were left with only 1 option... To implement a "standard" for
        competitions with respect to timing. Speedstack timers suit our
        requirements at this time. In The future there could very well be
        changes. This timing pad does not apply to blindfold cubing..... there
        will be 2 backups to the main timer for everyones info...lowest time on
        the backups will take over in case of main timer failure... all
        competitors will be alocated time upon arrival to become familiar with
        timers.... hope this all helps....for now...once you have solve a
        cube...take the effort and purposely slap both hands on the table or
        your knee's or whatever to get use to it..... hope this all helps.... 30
        days to go... danG Chief --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        It's a simple, but elegant timing &gt; device. Since that was at the
        Korean national Championships, I doubt &gt; the timer belongs to him
        though. Nontheless, timers have already &gt; been decided for the
        competition. I do wonder (the speedstack site &gt; doesn't give a good
        description) about the details of the pads. How &gt; wide apart are the
        palm rests spread? What actually stops the timer - &gt;
        pressure-sensitive, heat-sensitive, light-sensitve? Althought I &gt;
        might have heard something about our cubes needing to be inside some
        &gt; square, it's feasible that a competitor would use the solved cube
        &gt; to "tap" the part of the pad to stop the timer, what if any would
        be &gt; the consequence of such action? Most importantly of all, will
        teh &gt; timer stop after one hand is placed on a spot or after both
        hands &gt; are there? &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        i've been cubing about 3 months and use a standard cross, f2l, oll, pll
        method. my oll is a 2-look (orient edges, orient corners), and my pll is
        the standard 1-look. a typical "good" solve for me is in the high 30's,
        i.e. no gross errors, no total loss of concentration. i spend 3 seconds
        on the cross, 20+ seconds on the f2l corner-edge pairs, 10 seconds on
        the last layer. cross and last layer are pretty consistent, all the
        variation in my times comes from the f2l corner-edge pairs. i know some
        of the non-intuitive algs for corner- edge pairs, but not all of them. i
        average about 28-30 moves to place all 4 corner-edge pairs, which is not
        too bad considering my experience level. but it is time-consuming due to
        all my pauses! i videotaped myself the other day and basicly what i
        noticed was a quick cross, followed by a lot of pauses during f2l, then
        a quick end (well, quick considering its a 3-look LL). any
        recommendations on practice? just cube and cube and cube? if i just keep
        "doing it" will i recognize the f2l positions quicker and have fewer
        pauses? or are there some drills/excercises that you would do if you
        were me?

        Within the last few months I made the transition from cross on top to
        cross on bottom. My advice is to quit doing the cross on top cold
        turkey. Incorporate cross on the bottom whether it be speedcubing or
        practice solves, and after awhile it becomes just as natural as if you
        were doing the cross on top. It took me about a week to be really
        comfortable with it. -Richard --- KÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩre_Krig &lt;karkr936@...&gt;

        am quite sure that there are many people who came up with this &gt; idea
        for solving the F2L independently, so it will be next to &gt; impossible
        to find the "inventor". I learned about it when I joined &gt; the
        college. There were at least 5 guys (all coming from the same &gt; high
        school) doing the F2L this way. However, they solved the F2L &gt; kind
        of intuitively using lots of auxiliary moves with only a &gt; handful of
        basic intuitive moves. As a result, they were not too &gt; fast, and so
        I did not pay attention to this idea at first. Then, &gt; one day just
        for fun I tried to solve the F2L using this approach &gt; and quickly
        saw the _potential_ of this approach. However, it needed &gt; a
        substantial "overhaul". Thus, I developed over a dozen new, less &gt;
        obvious algorithms that you can see on my page. I agree with your point
        that it would be next to impossible to find "the" inventor, although I'm
        not really interested in who came up with the idea first. In my view,
        all people who came up with it independently deserve equal credit. (If
        there were 20 years before rediscovery, that would be another story ;-)
        What I originally set out to do was to make a list of at least some of
        the people who came up with the idea, but even that sounds like it may
        be a difficult task. Schoof was one guy who is said to have discovered
        it, but if in reality there are more like 10 people who discovered it,
        then it may not be good to give all credit to Schoof. And also, the
        people who first gave you the idea to do the F2L this way only used the
        idea in a very primitive way, and so it seems to me that you really did
        all the work to make it into a world class speed cubing system. I think
        you deserve as much credit here. I looked everywhere on the Internet to
        find out this piece of history about your method, but I'm glad to
        finally read it in this email. Maybe you could add a bit to your short
        historical narrative? Ryan

        Dan, as you can see in this group, people are trying to get a handle on
        the competitors for the WC. Several informal mechanisms have sprung up,
        like the database associated with this group. I assume at some point
        more official detail will be made available--I'm sure the media will
        want it at some point. It would be nice to know how many people are
        registered for each category of competition (e.g. 3x3 speed cubing, 4x4
        speed cubing, 3x3 least moves, etc). Also, when will we be told the
        actual format for the 3x3 speed cubing event (and other events)? What we
        know now is that there is some elimination on Saturday, and finals on
        Sunday. What we don't is: 1) how the elimination works/what types of
        competition are going to be used for each round (e.g. best time out of
        3, average of 10)? 2) approx. what time of day each of the heats are
        scheduled? 3) will the eliminations be based on a time target or # of
        competitors, or some combination? For example, will the first round
        narrow it down to, say, 30 people regardless of how fast or slow they
        solve it, or will there be a time target people are going to have to
        reach (in which case we won't know ahead of time whether 1 or 100 people
        are going to make it to the next round)? Don't feel obliged to answer
        questions here... if that info is going up on the WC site at some point,
        it would just be nice to know when. Thanks, Adam

        Adam, I appreciate your concerns and questions however, I am not
        obligated to reveal information pertaining to the amount of competitors.
        I will say however that the total official count is 68 with another 20
        unregistered. Your media related questions are irrelevant to your
        concerns. If i did tell everyone everything that is planned then there
        would be no suprises. There is no elimination on Saturday. I dont know
        where you got that from as its not written by me anywhere..... Your
        questions have been answered here a million times regarding what is
        happening on each day. All competitors will be provided an email with
        start times etc and info 1 week prior to the event... For now I strongly
        suggest everyone concerntrating on their own performances and not worry
        about logistics.. Day 1 is meet and great day...you show up
        ,register,meet and greet and when your good and ready you step up to the
        podiums and give me your best average... This day 1 averaging is for
        seeding and means nothing..Day 1 is designed for all of you to relax so
        you can give your best performance. Day two will see the eliminations
        and without a final competitor count, I cant reveal the final format
        plan.... So not to worry Adam, we are light years ahead and on top of
        things.. Remember one thing.....Be happy!! and practise and be prepared
        to meet the gang. 30 days... d

        All competitors will be provided an email with start times etc and &gt;

        everyone concerntrating on their own &gt; performances and not worry
        about logistics.. &gt; &gt; Day 1 is meet and great day...you show up
        ,register,meet and greet &gt; and when your good and ready you step up
        to the podiums and give me &gt; your best average... &gt; &gt; This day
        1 averaging is for seeding and means nothing..Day 1 is &gt; designed for
        all of you to relax so you can give your best &gt; performance. &gt;
        &gt; Day two will see the eliminations and without a final competitor

        I just called the hotel to make reservations for a room for the WC. It
        turns out you have to be 19 years old or older to check into the room,

        bar after we perform the solve.. &gt; &gt; same thing with these
        timers.... &gt; &gt; personally i dont care where the cube is
        placed..just as long as its &gt; solved...there will be a square where
        the cube should be placed &gt; inside however we will not be hard on
        that respect...just as long as &gt; the timer stops and the cube is
        done..there will be 2 backups to the &gt; timers just in case so not to
        worry....i expect you best time either &gt; way..haha &gt; &gt;
        therefore we dont loose anything and will not increse anything by &gt;
        using these timers...... &gt; &gt; &gt; these timers look good for the
        camera and they sure beat out my home &gt; made design which is just
        like what you had described....since we &gt; did not have 150k to
        manaufacture our own design(in time for the &gt; championships) we
        decided to use speedstacks to introduce a brand &gt; new timing scheme
        which thus introduces total fairness in a &gt; competition... &gt; &gt;
        its all a done deal in 33 days anyway so lets just do it and get it &gt;
        all done and overwith.. &gt; &gt; we will leave the timer manufacturer
        to Seventowns for future &gt; production after the event... &gt; &gt;

        As you may be aware, the company is actually named "Seven Towns, &gt;
        &gt; LTD.", and they are located in England, but they do manage all &gt;
        &gt; Rubik's products worldwide. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we
        have investigated the production of an actual Timer and it &gt; will
        &gt; &gt; &gt; cost 50k to produce and another 100k to market.... &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after the event some re engineering could occur
        on the &gt; speedstack &gt; &gt; &gt; pads which will match our needs a
        bit more however the it does &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a standard for
        timing which is basically the same way &gt; we &gt; &gt; &gt; do now
        with hitting the space bar on a keyboard to stop our &gt; online &gt;
        &gt; &gt; timers.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; danG &gt; &gt; &gt;
        chief &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This timer looks pretty good,
        although unfortunately I expect one &gt; &gt; will lose around half a
        second during the picking-up and putting- &gt; &gt; down times, so
        perhaps in the future we can do something about &gt; &gt; that. I have
        written a small program in Visual Basic (download &gt; the &gt; &gt; exe
        file from the "Files" section) that times quite well (It's a &gt; &gt;
        beta version, lacking many features). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also
        purchased a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard, which has &gt; a &gt;
        &gt; very large central Space Bar, and I use this to do my timing. Can
        &gt; &gt; we just write our own custom program, and then use these
        keyboards &gt; &gt; at the WC? &gt; &gt;
        http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/keyboard/nke_info.asp &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; If we must use the SPEEDSTACK pads, I think we can help reduce the
        &gt; &gt; time lost if we allow the competitor to place the cube on the
        &gt; table &gt; &gt; in whatever position he/she prefers after the
        inspection time has &gt; &gt; ended (I assume that will be the case?).
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another important function required of the timer is
        that it should &gt; &gt; keep track of multiple end times, in case the
        competitor &gt; &gt; accidentally puts the cube down unsolved. Then the
        competitor &gt; must &gt; &gt; pick it up, finish solving, and put
        his/her hands back down. &gt; There &gt; &gt; should be a log of all of
        the timer events received during each &gt; &gt; solution, something that
        could easily be written in my custom &gt; &gt; program. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; -Dan Okay, sounds good.

        wanted to make a quick post about a revelation of sorts that I have had
        recently. For anyone that is interested in speed solving, I want to take
        the time to emphasize exactly how utterly and completely important the
        quality of your cube is to your skill as a speed cubist. I have recently
        made some pretty big improvements, after a very very very long stretch
        of static times, and I now know why. Anyway for those of you who don't
        know, I had been stuck with a personal best average of 22.0 seconds for
        about 2 years straight. This was on a worn out cube that I had been
        using since I first started cubing (1998). Anyway I was able to improve
        down to the high 21's on this cube but then I switched to a studio cube.
        As I am continually breaking in this studio cube my times have gotten
        consistently better. What made me want to send this post is that I lubed
        my cube last night, then all of a sudden I set a new personal best
        average today. Compared to my old junky beat up cube, my new cube after
        this last lubing/cleaning is AMAZING! It is effortless to look ahead and
        go fast without having to worry about the alignment of the faces, not
        popping it because it is so loose, etc.. So anyway to make a long story
        short I was stuck in the low twenties for 2 years simply because I had a
        crappy cube. Now that I have seen what a really good cube feels like I
        know what was holding me back. So I just want to say that if any of you
        are like me and are cubing on a loose cube (the corners rattle when you
        shake it) and you're stuck at a barrier, don't do what I did!!! Don't
        keep using your old cube and getting frustrated that you're not
        improving! Chunk your old cube (well, save it for one handed cubing :-P)
        but get a new speed cube if you want to improve. I have now realized
        that a good speed cubist not only has to have all the algorithms come to
        you like second nature, dextrous hands and all that, but SOOOO much of
        getting good times is having a good cube. So in short, don't be like me.
        Chunk your cube when it wears out for a better one if you want to
        improve. I'll get off my soap box now, Chris Yahoo! Groups

        Everyone, I just got back from the International Conference On Thinking
        XI in Phoenix, Arizona. Please see www.conferenceonthinking.org . I have
        to say it was the most exciting and _awesome_ experience I ever had in
        my life. By the way, for those of you who read Michio Kaku's books, he
        himself was there, and I got his autograph, etc etc... So much knowledge
        and wisdom just poured through the entire week... I feel my brain has
        just clicked 'on'. ALSO, I actually set up a room for me to do the cube
        for an hour session - so I was a speaker in the Conference On Thinking
        XI, and it was AWESOME. I made a few times in front of the huge crowd,
        like 23 flat, 28, 30, (but I haven't received my good cube from Ton yet
        ;)...) DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT THESE Conferences on Thinking? The
        last one was in England somewhere, so I thought ONE OF YOU did...;)
        Well, thanks to this conference, I am WAY more prepared for the champs
        coming... Just very excellent stuff, and I VERY MUCH plan to attend the
        next one in 2005 at Austrailia... Oh, for those Wednesday Contest
        players, I will just extend the current week into a 2 week
        competition... Thanks everyone. Brent :) --Brent

        Good for the audience, bad for personal use. The mat and display are a
        shocking $200 USD not including shipping. I hope the organizers got a
        good deal for them. How many timers were aquired for the event? Also,
        what are they going to do with all those timers afterwards - sell them,
        award them to contestants, save them for future cubing competitions?
        Even though I really don't like the mechanism of these timers (or their
        price) it'd be really sweet to have a setup like that in my dorm to peak
        people's interest in cubing and show that I am a professional, lol.

        &gt; next one in 2005 at Austrailia... &gt; &gt; Oh, for those Wednesday
        Contest players, I will just extend the current week into a 2 week
        competition... Thanks everyone. &gt; &gt; Brent &gt; &gt; &gt; :) &gt;

        I heard that you have some difficulty at the Crowne Plaza Hoyel, because
        of their age requiements. I do not know Toronto, but I understand there
        is another hotel, the Holiday Inn, which is close to he venue. Why don't
        you ask there? I understand there will be events at the Crowne. You may
        need to walk back to your hotel at night. Walk in groups. There is
        always sfety in numbers. I don't think going to the Crowne, and hang
        around hoping siomeoine who is old enough wil take you in, is a good
        idea. What if no one takes you in? Then you are stranded in a strange
        city, with no place to sleep. You should have hotel reservation and
        plane ticket bbefore you leave your home. Just some advice frim an old
        lady. Good luck, both in securing your lodging, and at the hampionships.

        I think that it's not the hotel, but more of a Canada law where 18 is
        still considered a minor, but I could be wrong, I'm from the states.
        Perhaps, DanG could set that one straight. Anyways, I think that it's
        stupid that the hotel both want contestants to stay at their hotel
        (throwing a banquet and stuff), and enforces this age limit at the same
        time. It'd of been nice if a whole block of rooms could be reserved for
        us, it'd be like CUBE CENTRAL! But anyways, could the organizers play
        middle man and do reservations for the youngin's? I'm comming alone
        (under-aged), and perhaps my under-aged roommate (David) is also, and
        Heath is also in a similar bind; I really would like to stay with my
        potential roomate if at all possible. -Doug --- In

        Oh, God, so that is the way it is.... But if I recall correctly, you had
        certain age categories. The competitors at the lower end of this age
        scale would all be minors. At that point you should have alerted them to
        those problems, so that they knew in advance they wilk nort be allowed
        to book a room in any hotel. Thy should plan someone of age to book a
        room for them. Then they would have knowbn ahead of time, and you would
        never have this discussion. But as you say, the show must go on. Just
        ine question I will ask for them. What happens at the border with
        Canada, if rhey come alone and their passport shows they are not of age?
        Will they be allowed to enter Canada? Their parents might not be able to
        accpmpany them, for whatever reasons. Hana a kostky --- In

        Let me settle this !!! This is a fully open event. The Organization team
        is not responsible for anything outside of the actual event itself... We
        went out of way and setup hotels and things here and there.. It is the
        sole responsibility for any said competitor regardless of their age or
        status to see through any roadblocks that may arise... This includes
        border crossings: A: how can the Organization team be responsibly for
        getting people into Canada....answer: there is no such way. All we can
        do is "alert" canada customs of the fact that their is a world rubiks
        event where foriegn competitors are coming....we have done this and are
        jobs are done with respect to border crossings... Hotels: a: we went out
        of our way to make sure their were siutable accomodations available for
        everyone close to the venue... We have done this and our jobs are once
        again DONE!!! The new rubikschamps web site clearly states that it is
        the sole responsiblity for you to get here. The problem people are
        having with respect to legal age of majority is not our problem what so
        ever nor can we do anything about it. We do not set the laws here in
        Canada so please do not try to put the blame of the people setting this
        event up. How can you all try to hold us accountable for hotels?? We do
        not run hotels. Nor do we write the Laws. There is an easy way out of
        this problem which was identified earlier. Start talking to the other
        folks registered and get it resolved!!.. d --- In

        But if I recall correctly, you &gt; had certain age categories. The
        competitors at the lower end of this &gt; age scale would all be minors.
        At that point you should have alerted &gt; them to those problems, so
        that they knew in advance they wilk nort &gt; be allowed to book a room
        in any hotel. Thy should plan someone of &gt; age to book a room for
        them. Then they would have knowbn ahead of &gt; time, and you would
        never have this discussion. &gt; &gt; But as you say, the show must go
        on. Just ine question I will ask &gt; for them. What happens at the
        border with Canada, if rhey come alone &gt; and their passport shows
        they are not of age? Will they be allowed to &gt; enter Canada? Their
        parents might not be able to accpmpany them, for &gt; whatever reasons.

        say im not putting the blame on the organizers of the competition. I
        just wanted everybody to know about the age limits and to see what, if
        anything Dan G could do about it for us. Im sure I can get things worked
        out so I'll have a place to stay. Either by staying with someone of age,

        &gt; sfety in numbers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I don't think going to the Crowne, and hang around hoping &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; siomeoine &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who is old
        enough wil take you in, is a good idea. What if &gt; no &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; takes you in? Then you are
        stranded in a strange city, &gt; with &gt; &gt; no &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; place &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to sleep. You should have hotel
        reservation and plane &gt; ticket &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bbefore &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you leave your home. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lol, I would never stand outside the hotel
        hoping someone &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; me in. I dont know where you came up with that. Thats why &gt; I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asking on here for someone
        to room with. So I can get &gt; &gt; something &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up beforehand, and plans made. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just some advice frim an
        old lady. Good luck, both in &gt; &gt; securing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        source. That way you will know for sure that everything is OK. If you
        are a minor travelling without your parents or guardian you will
        probably need something to help you get into the country (a letter or
        something). I could be wrong, but probably not: contact the embassy and
        find out. If you feel unsure about doing that then ask your folks /
        guardians to do so for you. There is an official site for these sorts of
        questions here: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/ This site also seems
        good:

        to make a quick post about a &gt; revelation &gt; of sorts that I have
        had recently. For anyone that is interested &gt; in &gt; speed solving,
        I want to take the time to emphasize exactly how &gt; utterly and
        completely important the quality of your cube is to &gt; your &gt; skill
        as a speed cubist. I have recently made some pretty big &gt;
        improvements, after a very very very long stretch of static &gt; times,
        &gt; and I now know why. Anyway for those of you who don't know, I &gt;
        had &gt; been stuck with a personal best average of 22.0 seconds for
        about &gt; 2 &gt; years straight. This was on a worn out cube that I had
        been &gt; using &gt; since I first started cubing (1998). Anyway I was
        able to &gt; improve &gt; down to the high 21's on this cube but then I
        switched to a &gt; studio &gt; cube. As I am continually breaking in
        this studio cube my times &gt; have &gt; gotten consistently better.
        What made me want to send this post &gt; is &gt; that I lubed my cube
        last night, then all of a sudden I set a new &gt; personal best average
        today. Compared to my old junky beat up &gt; cube, &gt; my new cube
        after this last lubing/cleaning is AMAZING! It is &gt; effortless to
        look ahead and go fast without having to worry &gt; about &gt; the
        alignment of the faces, not popping it because it is so &gt; loose, &gt;
        etc.. ______ Adam Slate (434)760-1346 adam@...

        looks like you just gotta have a passport, or some other way to prove
        who you are(picture ID)... heres something about minors getting into
        canada...i got it from the same site... "Children under the age of 16
        should bring identification showing who they are. Bring a letter from
        the parent of a minor child you are travelling with, if you are not the
        child's parent or guardian. If you are coming with your child and are
        the only guardian, bring documentation showing the child has no other
        guardians. For example: a birth certificate that does not identify the
        father." -heath

        All, I'm coming from the US and was expecting to be able to travel with
        just my driver's license or other ID but not a passport. However I
        recently checked with a friend of mine who travels to Canada and he said
        I definitely should have a passport. I called the airline and they
        concurred. If you're driving it's possible you can get in without one,
        but if you're flying, forget it. And even if you are driving, it's
        probably not worth the risk that you'll get turned away. You can get a
        rush on a passport for an additional $60, which would get the
        application processed within a week or so. If you also make sure to
        overnight the application, you should be fine. Regarding the issue of
        18-year-olds checking into the Crowne Plaza--in America it's hard to
        rent a car if you're under 25 years old, unless you have a major credit
        card. Has anyone checked whether having a major credit card allows one
        to sidestep the hotel check-in problem too? Adam &gt;Date: Mon, 28 Jul

        I just thought I'd make an attempt at closing this chain that I
        started...From what I gathered... 1. Don't mail yourself to Canada. 2.
        If you're flying, you NEED a passport. 3. If you are driving you should
        still have a passport. &gt;If you don't have a passport have your
        driver's license, birth certificate, etc. Whatever forms of
        identification you can get. 4. If you are underaged crossing the border
        without a parent or guardian, get some form of written consent from your
        parent/guardian. &gt;It's not a bad idea if you're driving to bring a
        RWC flyer, as sort of a proof that's where you are going. 5. Common
        sense too people...no drugs, no toilets, and no small furry animals are
        to be taken across the border. :P So yeah...that should just about cover
        it. P.S. Does anyone know off hand when check-in is at the Crowne hotel?
        If no one knows I will call tommorow. Thnx all. -Richard --- Heath

        Let's talk about something different (not the WC2003 !) I'm looking for
        a speed edges first method. Ok, I know it's not very used, but there's
        perhaps some interesting methods to try. If you have ideas or links for
        me (I know the Philip Marshall "ultimate" pages), I'm interested. In
        fact, the problem is in the second part of the resolution. Placing the
        edges is very quick, but after that I don't know what to do to place
        quickly the corners. Looking for, then placing corners with a 3-cube
        permutation isn't fast enough. Ideas ?

        Heath, You can go to the State Department web site at www.state.gov and
        download an application (there is one for a new passport and one for
        renewing) or look up the closest passport center where you can apply in
        person. Then go to Kinkos (or somewhere... I was looking for convenience
        because I had dragged my feet) to get your photos taken. Mail or bring
        the application along with a check for the regular fee and rush fee, and
        overnight mail fee if you think you're cutting it close, to a processing
        center. There's plenty of info on the site. Actually I'd start by
        calling your airline and confirming they will be insisting on a
        passport. Adam &gt;Message: 11 &gt; Date: Tue, 29 Jul 2003 04:22:01

        To all US citizens, you need a passport when traveling to a foreign
        country. Canada is a friendly neighbor to the north, but still a foreign
        country, with its own government and its own laws. It is not the 51st
        state of the Unted States. Therefore you need a passport to travel to
        Canada and Canadians need a passport to travel the US. Canada does not
        require a visa of the US citizens, otherwise we all would need to get
        one. Time is running out. Only 26 days till the WC2003, counting today.
        So if you want to go to the Championships in Toronto, turns off your
        computers in order to get a passport in time. Hana a kostky

        about my step 3 description - I know it is currently a bit difficult to
        understand. You just have to figure it out yourself, for the moment. My
        next goal is to put my algorithms for step 1 online. These are
        algorithms for building a square consisting of a corner, two edges and a
        centre piece. Step 1 consists of building 3 squares. Unlike the standard
        F2L system which involves building 4 corner/edge pairs, it is
        practically impossible to memorise algorithms for every arrangement of
        the 3 independent pieces that contribute to the square. Instead, you
        need to come up with a solution as you're solving the cube. However,
        there are a few short algorithms that are useful to know, enabling you
        to think in terms of macros (not figure trick macros, but solution
        macros). Ryan

        here is cool tip for people who like fussing with the center screws on
        the cube, but find it annoying to glue and break the center caps to
        access the screws. the solution i use is neodymium magnets (super high
        strength magnets) to hold the center caps on. basicly i bought a bunch
        of neodymium disk magnets (5mm diameter, 2.5mm thick) from an online
        retailer (see note at end). they cost $0.60 each-- pretty cheap. then i
        bought a bunch of small steel machine nuts (3mm) from my local hardware
        store. 1. super-glue a steel 3mm nut to the inside of each center cap 2.
        set a neodymium disk magnet on each steel 3mm nut 3. put the center caps
        on the neodymium magnet is attracted to both the 3mm nut and the center
        screw, thus holding the center cap on. works great-- my center caps have
        never fallen off and when i want to access the screw, i just pop an edge
        cubie and pull off the center cap. when the cube wears out, you just buy
        another set of 3mm nuts and glue them to the center caps of the new
        cube, and you can re-use the same neodymium magnets. you must be careful
        with neodymium magnets, since the attraction is so strong that they can
        shatter if allowed to come together uncontrolled. to buy neodymium
        mangets, i used the following retailer:
        http://www.indigo.com/magnets/neodymium-magnets.html and purchased
        several of part number 43512A. i wouldn't use anything but a neodymium
        magnet-- ferrite magnets won't be strong enough and your center caps are
        liable to fall off.

        just your birth certificate and some I.D. I did not ask about flying and

        As odd as it sounds, what works for me is to go slower. I once cubed on
        stage in front of the incoming junior class to my high school, as well
        as their parents, (a little over 1000 people) and I was of course so
        nervous that my hands were shaking badly. I intentionally slowed down a
        lot during the entire solve, however since I was so nervous and
        "adrenalined up" my "slow" solve was actually still pretty fast. Anyway
        by going what I felt was a lot slower I still pulled off what I
        considered to be a really fast time. So if you're nervous, slow down and
        the adrenaline will make up for your seemingly slower speed. my two

        Hi Hana, It is easy for me to comprehend someone not expecting to need a
        passport to go between the US and Canada. It was that way for a couple
        hundred years. Times change. In the 60's and 70's I used to visit Canada
        quite a bit. In 1969 I flew into Toronto with no ID at all, and was
        allowed in no problem. I don't know when passports became a requirement.

        any psychologist will tell you the key is to visualize yourself actually
        performing every time you solve, even in your living room. don't just
        sit there and solve. you have to convince your mind before every solve
        that you are on stage and people are watching. they only way to do this
        is to practice visualizing. imagine the stage, imagine the timer,
        imagine the people-- you have to see it all in your head. then solve the
        cube. rinse and repeat. do not become complacent and just solve over and
        over. visualize every time. you must convince your unconcious mind that
        you are there. it is hard to do, but it can be done and it will take
        practice to visualize effectively. i guarantee if you put effort into
        this procedure a hundred times a day between now and wc2003, you'll be a

        that doesn't affect any other pieces (including corners), then I don't
        really have one, but I can construct one that isn't too terribly long.
        This sequence (obtained from
        http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/megaminx.txt ) rotates three adjacent
        edges on F (uf, lf, rf), leaving all other pieces intact. . R+ F+ U+ F-
        U- R- L- U- F- U+ F+ L+ If you prepend R+ F+ R-, and append R+ F- R- it
        should do what you're looking for. Though I realize that 18 moves isn't
        really all that short, that's the best I can offer, since my typical
        approach messes with corner orientation and permutation when permuting
        edges. Hope this helps. If you don't mind messing with corners, I can
        give you something much shorter.

        face so I'll need to start F'U'F and finish F'UF (though I can cancel
        out the F of F'U'F with the initial F' of F'U'L'ULFSLUL'U'S'). I can't
        really mess with the corners since hopefully by the time I get to the
        edges the corners will be solved (or the other way around in which case
        I still don't want my corners messed up). So far, I haven't quite got
        the corners done (best is all oriented and 17 placed - so I got them
        done in 2 looks) but I think I shall soon and then this move will be of
        great use in getting the edges done. My other problem is to find an
        alphabet with 30 characters (Cambodian has over 90 but I don't know it)
        so I can label the edges more efficiently. (The other possibility is
        Greek and Latin to give 50 letters, but there'd be some overlap which is
        not ideal.)

        people who like fussing with the center screws &gt; on the cube, but
        find it annoying to glue and break the center caps &gt; to access the
        screws. the solution i use is neodymium magnets &gt; (super high
        strength magnets) to hold the center caps on. &gt; &gt; basicly i bought
        a bunch of neodymium disk magnets (5mm diameter, &gt; 2.5mm thick) from
        an online retailer (see note at end). they cost &gt; $0.60 each-- pretty
        cheap. then i bought a bunch of small steel &gt; machine nuts (3mm) from
        my local hardware store. &gt; &gt; 1. super-glue a steel 3mm nut to the
        inside of each center cap &gt; 2. set a neodymium disk magnet on each
        steel 3mm nut &gt; 3. put the center caps on &gt; &gt; the neodymium
        magnet is attracted to both the 3mm nut and the center &gt; screw, thus
        holding the center cap on. works great-- my center caps &gt; have never
        fallen off and when i want to access the screw, i just &gt; pop an edge
        cubie and pull off the center cap. when the cube wears &gt; out, you
        just buy another set of 3mm nuts and glue them to the &gt; center caps
        of the new cube, and you can re-use the same neodymium &gt; magnets.
        &gt; &gt; you must be careful with neodymium magnets, since the
        attraction is &gt; so strong that they can shatter if allowed to come
        together &gt; uncontrolled. &gt; &gt; to buy neodymium mangets, i used
        the following retailer: &gt;
        http://www.indigo.com/magnets/neodymium-magnets.html &gt; and purchased
        several of part number 43512A. i wouldn't use &gt; anything but a
        neodymium magnet-- ferrite magnets won't be strong &gt; enough and your
        center caps are liable to fall off.

        does someone actually think that a magneticly attached center-cap offers
        a competitive advantage over a glue-attached center-cap? or is this more
        a matter that everyone must follow the letter of the law "thou shalt not
        modify thy cube" although i'm not seriously competitive (35-40 secs), i
        am registered to come to wc2003, so i guess i'm glad i haven't done this

        The following page shows how to get a US passport in 2 weeks.
        http://travel.state.gov/passport_expedite.html The costs are as follows:
        Regular fee - $55 First time applications - additional $35 Expedited

        - around $10 Plus the costs to overnight the application to the state

        yes most modern cubes are held on by a rivet or something and are not

        Hi Dan, I got your message. Thanks again! But I got a lot more questions
        now. I know, after reading these, you're gonna say, "Where were you
        man?" OK, I was in Reno then this camp place, and haven't been checking
        out much about WC, so please bear with me. This is what was said in the
        rule section of www.rubikschamps.com as the rule for 3x3x3 blindfold.
        Rules: Competitor will qualify to compete in future rounds through time
        trials based on overall placement against other competitors and average
        fastest time over 10 consecutively repeated attempts. Each round
        thereafter will use the best average of 5 consecutive attempts for
        further advancement. Final round competitors will be chosen based on age
        group and total number of competitors. Q's: So we do 10 consecutive
        solves and take the average? I mean, that's really intense. What if we
        mess up on one? Is it going to be like, that's it, or do we get a
        another trial? If so, up to how many times can we mess up? And does the
        middle 10 out of 12 rule apply here, too? Why don't we try like middle 3
        out of 5 instead of 10 like in Clock, Magic, etc. I don't think it
        really makes sense that something that takes much concentration to do
        (at least for me) requires to be done more times than those that takes
        less (at least for me). Is the rules even right? If not, what's the
        correct one? Sorry for rambling on and on and on... It's just that the
        phrase "10 consecutively repeated attempts" freaked me out. Thanks, and
        again, any kind of answer is appreciated Macky

        Try submerging it in clean (maybe mildly soapy) water and mess with it

        Th 1978-1979 cubes from Hungary had the adjusting screws, and the early
        Ideal/Made-in-Taiwan cubes appear to have been made from identical
        molds, which means the cap over the screw can be hard to get off! With
        the other Ideal cubes it is easier to access the screw, with the Deluxe
        being the easiest, the screw being under the tile. The Ideal cubes made
        in England, in the cardboard cylinder, have a good feel to them, as do
        the ones made in Hungary in the clear plastic cylinder. I'm told that
        the Hong Kong version is also good. Several US models are cool, too,
        like the one with the circular Rubiks Logo. All of these have screws.

        Ron I find your last record amazing, congratulations. David Wesley is

        Because after a baaaad 21 seconds (discarded, fortunately), you got a
        baaad 20 seconds, and this one is NOT discarded. It's really really
        impressive to get a 16.3 average with a 20.5 in the list of the 10
        times. When going for 16-17seconds average, even a 18 seconds slows you
        down A LOT. In general, when I get two bad times (= 18-19seconds or
        above) in an average, I immediately stop, and start a new one. Obviously
        I shouldn't. here are the times Ron got, (12) 15 17 15 16 14 (21) 15 20
        14 18 14 =&gt; 15.8 + 0.5 try to replace the 20 seconds time with a
        normal time, let's say 16 or even 17, and then calculate the time Ron

        well as the excitment grows, i thought i might mention something other
        than the fast-approaching championships. i'm always scowering for stuff
        from the golden age of cubing...way back early 80's (golden age in north
        america). right now, i'm wondering if anyone has any tv comercials for
        the cube. i know vcr's were still pretty new, but there's gotta be some
        out there somewhere. and there are a number of people on here quite good
        at compressing videos to a decent size. so who knows...maybe some will
        show up thanks

        Thank you Hana, As I understand, one cm is always one cm, but one inch
        could be anything. But 12 inches is always one foot. Correct? Rune -----

        I got your message. Thanks again! &gt; &gt; But I got a lot more
        questions now. I know, after reading &gt; &gt; these, you're gonna say,
        "Where were you man?" OK, I was in Reno &gt; then &gt; &gt; this camp
        place, and haven't been checking out much about WC, so &gt; &gt; please
        bear with me. This is what was said in the rule section of &gt; &gt;
        www.rubikschamps.com as the rule for 3x3x3 blindfold. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Rules: Competitor will qualify to compete in future rounds &gt;
        through &gt; &gt; time trials based on overall placement against other
        competitors &gt; and &gt; &gt; average fastest time over 10
        consecutively repeated attempts. Each &gt; &gt; round thereafter will
        use the best average of 5 consecutive &gt; attempts &gt; &gt; for
        further advancement. Final round competitors will be chosen &gt; based
        &gt; &gt; on age group and total number of competitors. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Q's: So we do 10 consecutive solves and take the average? I mean,
        &gt; &gt; that's really intense. What if we mess up on one? Is it going
        to &gt; be &gt; &gt; like, that's it, or do we get a another trial? If
        so, up to how &gt; many &gt; &gt; times can we mess up? And does the
        middle 10 out of 12 rule apply &gt; &gt; here, too? Why don't we try
        like middle 3 out of 5 instead of 10 &gt; like &gt; &gt; in Clock,
        Magic, etc. I don't think it really makes sense that &gt; &gt; something
        that takes much concentration to do (at least for me) &gt; &gt; requires
        to be done more times than those that takes less (at &gt; least &gt;
        &gt; for me). Is the rules even right? If not, what's the correct one?
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for rambling on and on and on... &gt; &gt;
        It's just that the phrase "10 consecutively repeated attempts" &gt; &gt;
        freaked me out. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, and again, any kind of
        answer is appreciated &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Macky &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!

        Does anybody have (in digital format) the VH1 special for "I Love The
        80's" (1981 I think) that focuses on the Rubik's Cube. I have heard
        people telling me I need to see it, but have always missed it or saw the
        wrong year. Also, I doubt anybody will have experienced this, but if
        anybody ever plays EA Sports' NHL 2003 for PS2, one announcer randomly
        says something like, "Hey Jim, I just solved this Rubik's Cube!" I heard
        this while my friends were playing and I was intensly cubing. We just
        paused the game and looked at each other for about a minute before
        laughing hysterically. Thanks, Nathan.

        Well in Eurpe they use the metric system. In America and the UK they use
        the English system. Centimeter/meter is metric, inch/foot is English. 1
        foot = 12 inches, and 1 inch = 2.54 cm, and from this point you figure
        it out. Personally, I prefer the metric system, not because I was born
        in Europe, but because the conversion factors are just powers of 10 and
        much easier to manipulate with. This is particularly of compound
        dimension such as dynes (cgs units of force). Hana a kostky --- In

        These are new cubes imported from Europe that are made in the same way
        the old 80s cubes were made (adjustable screws and all). Typically
        members here get these from Ton at
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/buy1.htm. They might be a bit out of
        stock at the moment. Many of the very fast cubists use it. Differences
        with the new rubiks.com brand cubes are that the plastic is much softer
        and brittler (more cleaning), the orange side is bright pinkish, and
        that stickers are vinyl as opposed to laminated paper. Of course most
        notable the center caps can easily be removed for tension adjustment.
        I've found that these cubes can quickly be broken in, however, easily
        worn out. In regards to the 2x2 not being an event due to it's ease,
        shouldn't the same reasoning mean that there shouldn't be a rubik's
        magic event? I think it's not an actual even because of lack of interest
        and/or time constraints. -Doug --- In

        &gt; for tension adjustment. I've found that these cubes can quickly be
        &gt; broken in, however, easily worn out. &gt; &gt; In regards to the
        2x2 not being an event due to it's ease, shouldn't &gt; the same
        reasoning mean that there shouldn't be a rubik's magic &gt; event? I
        think it's not an actual even because of lack of interest &gt; and/or
        time constraints. &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        Yeah, the inside is a exactly the same as a normal rubiks.com 2x2. The
        problem with the homer heads is getting the peices back together. Even
        though the normal 2x2s are super easy to put back together, i dunno why
        the homer heads are so hard. Maybe because they aren't cubed shaped
        peices? jake --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Heath" &lt;

        There were some posts made about modifications to the cube and such...It
        seems to me that everything is super hellified strict...even to the
        point of not being able to have magnetic center caps. Which brings me to
        my question: I sanded the paint off of one of my speedcubes. I'm sure i
        sanded a very minimal amount of plastic off of the cube in the
        process...will i get nailed for that?

        behing the rules: 1. No cheating. If you sand the internal edges of the
        cubies so that you can turn one side way earlier than normal - before
        the prior turn of an adjacent side is complete - that is not allowed.
        This is only fair. 2. Seven Towns holds the marketing rights to Erno
        Rubik's product. Mr. Rubik and his marketing partners have lost several
        million dollars to counterfeit cubes. So, if you compete in the
        championship sponsored by them, then the cube you use has to *be* a
        genuine cube and *look* like one. I think this is only reasonable. David

        [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] I got 54 moves
        (HTM). Fairly useless, I expect. I used the cube applet on the page. I
        also came up with this blindfold solution (66 moves HTM) using my new
        method (all pre-worked out algorithms):
        L2BF2R2D2F'R2UF'U'B2L2U'B'U'B2U2F2R2F2U'F2R2F2U2B'FR'BF'R'U2LB2F2L2UB

        strict...even to the point of not being able to &gt; have magnetic &gt;
        center &gt; &gt; &gt; caps. Which brings me to my question: &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I sanded the paint off of one of my speedcubes. &gt;
        I'm sure i &gt; sanded a &gt; &gt; &gt; very minimal amount of plastic
        off of the cube &gt; in the &gt; process...will &gt; &gt; &gt; i get
        nailed for that? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are two basic ideas behing
        the rules: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. No cheating. If you sand the internal
        edges &gt; of the cubies so &gt; &gt; that you can turn one side way
        earlier than normal &gt; - before the &gt; prior &gt; &gt; turn of an
        adjacent side is complete - that is not &gt; allowed. This is &gt; &gt;
        only fair. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Seven Towns holds the marketing rights
        to &gt; Erno Rubik's &gt; product. &gt; &gt; Mr. Rubik and his marketing
        partners have lost &gt; several million &gt; dollars &gt; &gt; to
        counterfeit cubes. So, if you compete in the &gt; championship &gt;
        sponsored &gt; &gt; by them, then the cube you use has to *be* a &gt;
        genuine cube and &gt; *look* &gt; &gt; like one. I think this is only
        reasonable. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt;

        Not sure if everyone saw, but cube explorer 3.0 is out. Very nifty. It
        has a new feature that allows you to scan in the cube with a webcam,
        then it generates the solution algorithm. With 15 second inspection
        (scanning) I was able to solve scan, genrate, and solve the cube in 29
        seconds (A not bad time for me, but far from great). Though scanning
        took slightly longer than the 15 seconds. Just thought it was neat,

        Thanks for the info! It's really awesome. Seems like he and I have a lot
        in common... cube, blindfold cube, and juggling It's super-amazing
        though, how he can solve the cube blindfolded in 30 seconds. I wonder
        how long it takes him to memorize the cube... I finally solved the 4x4x4
        blindfolded today... I hope he can't do this one so good (because I
        can't) BTW, do you know if he's gonna come to WC? Oh, wait, he lives in

        I checked out your page and I used to use this same method. I learned
        the algs from Ron's site to orient/permute the second face corners in
        one alg and after practice it is without a doubt faster than permuting
        the top and bottom corners together. This is because you have to look
        the whole cube over to see which corners are already correct.

        Hi, Let me clarify. I¬¥ll be standing on something that we may
        conditionally define as a floor. If it actually is a podium or anything
        else is rather irrelevant. And the hight of the podium - 4 or 104 feet -
        doesn¬¥t matter, I never turn giddy. I¬¥m naturally interested in the
        vertical distance from the floor (from the soles of my feet) to the cube
        in the starting moment. Unclear? Rune ----- Original Message ----- From:

        I got your message. Thanks again! &gt; &gt; But I got a lot more
        questions now. I know, after reading &gt; &gt; these, you're gonna say,
        "Where were you man?" OK, I was in Reno &gt; then &gt; &gt; this camp
        place, and haven't been checking out much about WC, so &gt; &gt; please
        bear with me. This is what was said in the rule section of &gt; &gt;
        www.rubikschamps.com as the rule for 3x3x3 blindfold. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Rules: Competitor will qualify to compete in future rounds &gt;
        through &gt; &gt; time trials based on overall placement against other
        competitors &gt; and &gt; &gt; average fastest time over 10
        consecutively repeated attempts. Each &gt; &gt; round thereafter will
        use the best average of 5 consecutive &gt; attempts &gt; &gt; for
        further advancement. Final round competitors will be chosen &gt; based
        &gt; &gt; on age group and total number of competitors. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Q's: So we do 10 consecutive solves and take the average? I mean,
        &gt; &gt; that's really intense. What if we mess up on one? Is it going
        to &gt; be &gt; &gt; like, that's it, or do we get a another trial? If
        so, up to how &gt; many &gt; &gt; times can we mess up? And does the
        middle 10 out of 12 rule apply &gt; &gt; here, too? Why don't we try
        like middle 3 out of 5 instead of 10 &gt; like &gt; &gt; in Clock,
        Magic, etc. I don't think it really makes sense that &gt; &gt; something
        that takes much concentration to do (at least for me) &gt; &gt; requires
        to be done more times than those that takes less (at &gt; least &gt;
        &gt; for me). Is the rules even right? If not, what's the correct one?
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for rambling on and on and on... &gt; &gt;
        It's just that the phrase "10 consecutively repeated attempts" &gt; &gt;
        freaked me out. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, and again, any kind of
        answer is appreciated &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Macky &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I got your message. Thanks again! &gt; &gt; &gt; But I
        got a lot more questions now. I know, after reading &gt; &gt; &gt;
        these, you're gonna say, "Where were you man?" OK, I was in &gt; Reno
        &gt; &gt; then &gt; &gt; &gt; this camp place, and haven't been checking
        out much about WC, &gt; so &gt; &gt; &gt; please bear with me. This is
        what was said in the rule section &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt;
        www.rubikschamps.com as the rule for 3x3x3 blindfold. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Rules: Competitor will qualify to compete in future
        rounds &gt; &gt; through &gt; &gt; &gt; time trials based on overall
        placement against other &gt; competitors &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt;
        average fastest time over 10 consecutively repeated attempts. &gt; Each
        &gt; &gt; &gt; round thereafter will use the best average of 5
        consecutive &gt; &gt; attempts &gt; &gt; &gt; for further advancement.
        Final round competitors will be chosen &gt; &gt; based &gt; &gt; &gt; on
        age group and total number of competitors. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Q's: So we do 10 consecutive solves and take the average? I &gt; mean,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; that's really intense. What if we mess up on one? Is it
        going &gt; to &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt; like, that's it, or do we get
        a another trial? If so, up to how &gt; &gt; many &gt; &gt; &gt; times
        can we mess up? And does the middle 10 out of 12 rule &gt; apply &gt;
        &gt; &gt; here, too? Why don't we try like middle 3 out of 5 instead of
        &gt; 10 &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; in Clock, Magic, etc. I don't
        think it really makes sense that &gt; &gt; &gt; something that takes
        much concentration to do (at least for me) &gt; &gt; &gt; requires to be
        done more times than those that takes less (at &gt; &gt; least &gt; &gt;
        &gt; for me). Is the rules even right? If not, what's the correct &gt;
        one? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for rambling on and on and
        on... &gt; &gt; &gt; It's just that the phrase "10 consecutively
        repeated attempts" &gt; &gt; &gt; freaked me out. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I¬¥ll be standing on something that we may
        conditionally define as &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a floor. If it actually is a
        podium or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything else is rather irrelevant.
        And the hight of the podium - &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4 or 104 feet -
        doesn¬¥t matter, I never &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turn giddy. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I¬¥m naturally interested in the vertical distance from
        the floor &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (from the soles of my feet) to the cube
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the starting moment. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Unclear? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rune

        Thanks again! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I got a lot more
        questions now. I know, after reading &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        these, you're gonna say, "Where were you man?" OK, I was &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reno &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this camp place, and haven't been
        checking out much about &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WC, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        so &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; please bear with me. This is what
        was said in the rule &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; section &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; www.rubikschamps.com as the
        rule for 3x3x3 blindfold. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rules: Competitor will qualify to compete in
        future &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rounds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time trials based on overall
        placement against other &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitors &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; average
        fastest time over 10 consecutively repeated &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        attempts. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Each &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; round thereafter will use the best average of 5 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        consecutive &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attempts &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; for further advancement. Final round competitors will be
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chosen &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on age group and total number of competitors.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Q's: So we do 10 consecutive solves and take the average? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        that's really intense. What if we mess up on one? Is it &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; going &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like, that's it, or do we get a
        another trial? If so, up &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to how &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; many &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times can we mess up?
        And does the middle 10 out of 12 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rule &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; apply &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here, too? Why don't
        we try like middle 3 out of 5 instead &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; in Clock, Magic, etc. I don't think it really makes sense
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something
        that takes much concentration to do (at least &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for
        me) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requires to be done more times
        than those that takes less &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (at &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; least &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for me). Is the rules
        even right? If not, what's the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; one? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for rambling on and on and on... &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's just that the phrase "10 consecutively
        repeated &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attempts" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; freaked me out. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, and again, any kind of answer is appreciated

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I got your message. Thanks again! &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; But I got a lot more questions now. I know, after reading
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these, you're gonna say, "Where were you man?" OK, I
        was &gt; in &gt; &gt; Reno &gt; &gt; &gt; then &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this
        camp place, and haven't been checking out much about &gt; WC, &gt; &gt;
        so &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; please bear with me. This is what was said in the
        rule &gt; section &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; www.rubikschamps.com
        as the rule for 3x3x3 blindfold. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Rules: Competitor will qualify to compete in future &gt; rounds &gt;
        &gt; &gt; through &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time trials based on overall
        placement against other &gt; &gt; competitors &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; average fastest time over 10 consecutively repeated &gt;
        attempts. &gt; &gt; Each &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; round thereafter will use
        the best average of 5 &gt; consecutive &gt; &gt; &gt; attempts &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; for further advancement. Final round competitors will be &gt;
        chosen &gt; &gt; &gt; based &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on age group and total
        number of competitors. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Q's: So
        we do 10 consecutive solves and take the average? &gt; I &gt; &gt; mean,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that's really intense. What if we mess up on one? Is
        it &gt; going &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like,
        that's it, or do we get a another trial? If so, up &gt; to how &gt; &gt;
        &gt; many &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times can we mess up? And does the middle
        10 out of 12 &gt; rule &gt; &gt; apply &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here, too?
        Why don't we try like middle 3 out of 5 instead &gt; of &gt; &gt; 10
        &gt; &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Clock, Magic, etc. I don't
        think it really makes sense &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that
        takes much concentration to do (at least &gt; for me) &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; requires to be done more times than those that takes less &gt; (at
        &gt; &gt; &gt; least &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for me). Is the rules even
        right? If not, what's the &gt; correct &gt; &gt; one? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for rambling on and on and on... &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; It's just that the phrase "10 consecutively repeated &gt;
        attempts" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; freaked me out. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, and again, any kind of answer is appreciated &gt;

        Dan, at this point I think it's clear that we can't just 'show up and
        cube.'...but this is understandable. You and all the other organizers
        have to be meticulous to keep this competition running and the sponsors
        happy. But in the same light, respect others who may have the same
        attention to detail as you do. It's advisable that a person practice
        with the stack mats before the competition....in fact, wanting to
        reproduce the actual setup as close as possible is not that
        unreasonable. You've wondered a few times where all the questions have
        been. But now, as some people express their concern, you respond with
        frustration and ridicule. What's the deal, everybody wants the same
        thing as you: A very successful world competition...hopefully one that
        will revered as the rebirth of the cube and be a blueprint for all the
        other world competitions to come. -jake

        Rune, once again, you have yet to identify your height after repeated

        going to answer.... if a person is 2 feet tall and the podium is 4 feet
        OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE A STOOL OR SOMETHING TO STAND ON....
        same with a person 10 feet tall...we will raise the podium....!!! these
        questions are a bit repeatitive folks when you dont get right to the
        point..... there are other folks assigned to these types of questions on
        the web site. can we please utilize those people please. I dont have
        time to answer every question you all might have which is why the

        jacob, coming from someone who has dropped out......... My point of this

        answer certain types of questions which in turn get answered by various
        RCC members... this forum and myself are getting the bulk of the
        questions and i in turn have to answer them all.. some of the questions
        are common sense questions which people should be able to answer on
        their own..... i dont mind answering questions however when i would like

        If I understand this question correctly, you are asking for what is
        known as an amortized average for corner permutation that ignores edge
        permutation, edge orientation, and corner orientation, right? Ok then,
        how do you know that it averages "4 moves," doesn't this number answer
        your question? There are precicly 3 possible cases of CP, corners in
        place, corners swapped adjacently, corners swapped diagonally. These
        three have the weighted probablities (assuming uniform random
        distribution, i.e. no pertinent preprocessing during F2L) of 1/6, 2/3,
        and 1/6 respectively. Another important issue is weather you are
        counting the pre-adjusts or post-adjusts, which for practical purposes
        we may simply add .25 turns to the final result. I believe the shortest
        diagonal swap sequence is of length 6 in Half- Turn-Metric, 7 for
        adjacent swap, and of course 0 for corners in place (relatively). So it
        is easy to arrive as the final solution of
        (1/6)(0)+(2/3)(7)+(1/6)(6)+.25 = 11+11/12 turns in HTM. A similar
        calculation may be done for QTM, and for considering other more

        Sorry but I got slightly lost in your terminology. In clarification, I
        am talking about using a layer by layer approach, like this: cross,
        place four first layer corners = first layer completed, OLL, PLL. In
        that stage where you just place the first layer corners, on average you
        can place each corner correctly in 4 moves each. So now you have to
        place all four edges in the middle layer correctly. It is this part
        where I was curious about the number of algorithms required to correctly
        move/place all second-layere edges simultaneously effectively solving
        the first two layers. If the situations and the algorithms to place all
        edges were reasonable (10-12 moves), one could solve the first two
        layers of the cube in the same amount of moves as the Fridrich system
        (which I currently use for F2L). So, how many situations are there for
        simultaneously placing all four second layer edges correctly once you
        have the first layer completed? Thanks in advance, Nathan.

        It is a very good method. I use it now but I am switching to Fridrich
        because it does have it's limits and I want to be faster. It's quite
        efficient though and most of the time I can place 2 or 3 bottom edges at
        the same time as the top ones. As for learning the orient/permute algs,
        I never bothered because placing the top corners completely takes much
        much longer than orienting them and recognition of the bottom corners is
        not easy. I disagree with you about having to look the whole cube over
        to purmute corners. The cube never has to be moved at all using a method
        described here http://cube.misto.cz/cfsm.html (stage I #3) --barefoot

        My thoughts on some of the sanding posts I've seen here... the rule
        seems a little arbitrary. If someone uses their cube enough such that
        the inside edges wear down, there doesn't seem to be any rule against
        that, but if the cube gets to that state by sanding inside edges, it's a
        disqualification. That would be like having a rule in baseball that you
        can't oil your mitt... you have to let it break in from using it. What's
        the point of that, since you end up with the same product. I guess
        that's what comes from not having a governing committee to oversee the
        evolution of the standards. Adam

        &lt;mylib_2000@...&gt; Subject: Corners Method I checked out your page
        and I used to use this same method. I learned the algs from Ron's site
        to orient/permute the second face corners in one alg and after practice
        it is without a doubt faster than permuting the top and bottom corners
        together. This is because you have to look the whole cube over to see
        which corners are already correct.

        Ok, I understand the question now, I'm breaking the cases up into 8
        groups: 1 group for each of 0,1,3,4 edges in middle layer plus 4 groups
        where 2 edges are in the middle layer (mid edges adj OR diag)X (LL edges
        ajd OR opp). This is a really tedious calculation and there is realy no
        way of doing it other then going through almost cases by cases for the
        more sophisticated solution that accounts for both diagonal mirroring,
        vertical miroring, rotational isomorphisims, and other wacky
        isomorphisms. (There is no need to account for inverses for the purposes
        of recognition/speedcubing.) The stupid answer would be of course
        (8*7*6*5)(2^4) but I suppose this is not the value you desire. Allowing
        for a free pre-adjust of the LL, I believe the number of "distinct"
        cases for when all 4 edges are on mid is 60 (counting the solved one).
        If all 4 edges are on LL there should be 48 cases. No more then 144 for
        1 edge in mid, 3 on LL. Precisely 11 permutation cases for 3 edges in
        mid, 1 on LL (but don't multiply that by 16 orientation cases just
        yet...). There rest of the calculations are quite tedious. All together
        there should be at least 100 "distinct" cases, which makes this approach
        quite illogical for a speedsolving method. Recognition itself should be
        a pain. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Nathan"

        spot, so some adjusts will &gt; have to be made.. oh and you cannot flip
        a single edge. &gt; &gt; hmm..so less than 64" Actually, you can have
        just one flipped, because there are 4 additional unsolved edges on the
        cube at that point (LL edges). Let's look at that equation... There are
        8 possible spots for each edge, I believe this would be 8^4 (8
        possibilities for edge 1 * 8 possibilities for edge 2, etc.), not 8*4.
        To take into account the fact that you can't have two edges in the same
        place, however, you get more of a factorial type of equation. There are
        8 possibilities for the first edge, but once it's placed, there are only
        7 possibilities for edge 2, and so on. So instead of 8*4 (or 8^4), you
        get 8*7*6*5 = 1,680. Next, let's think about orientation. If each edge
        can be flipped one of two ways, then that would be not just 2, but
        2*2*2*2 (a multiple of 2 for each edge involved). This would make the
        upper limit more like (8*7*6*5)*(2*2*2*2) = 1,680 * 16 = 26,880. The
        actual number of unique situations is quite far from this number,
        though, because of all the cases that are identical to each other. For
        example, there are four separate cases in which all edges are placed
        properly, but one is flipped (4 choices of which one to flip), even
        though these are all solved the same (and therefore are really just one
        case). Also, there are 32 possibilities for having 3 edges solved, and
        one edge on the LL (4 choices of which edge to put on the LL, 4
        positions to choose from to put it in, and 2 possible flips = 4*4*2 =
        32), even though we all know that if 3 edges are in the middle layer and
        the last is in the LL, there are only two possibilities that matter
        (orientation). Sorry to keep babbling, but I think you get the point.
        The number is no larger than 26,880, but I can gaurantee it's not even
        close to that limit. I just don't have any good ideas for narrowing it
        down any further than that without looking at specific cases.

        will enter a room, where it is pitch dark, nly the glowing cube glows.
        His aim is, as usual, to solve the cube as fast as possible. The cube
        should be anisotropic picture ccube, ssomething like you have. Only
        those pictures will glow, nothing else. The cube should be scrambled
        outside the dark room and handed n a bag to to the contestant. The
        contestant opens the bag, takes auot the cube,m inspeucts it nd starts
        cubing. When he is done, he opens the door and shows the solved cube.
        Like it, anyne? Hana a kostky Here is my brand new original cintribution

        Hi Hana, I think the whole discussion originates in a semantic

        will be standing on some kind of a scene, on something that almost
        everybody but DanG would call a podium. And this scene has of course a

        &gt; This would make the upper limit more &gt; like (8*7*6*5)*(2*2*2*2)
        = 1,680 * 16 = 26,880. Correct. &gt; The actual number of unique
        situations is quite far from this &gt; number, though, because of all
        the cases that are identical to &gt; each other. You could rotate the
        whole cube around its vertical axis, or turn just the bottom layer. The
        26880 figure counts all these cases separately, i.e. those that differ
        by a cube turn and/or bottom layer turn are considered different. There
        are 4x4=16 combinations of cube/D-layer turns. If every case were
        non-symmetrical, then the number we had is 16 times too large, giving
        only 105 distinct cases. This is a slight underestimate because there
        are a few symmetrical cases (cases where a D-layer/cube turn does not
        have any effect). Still it won't be more than 200 I think. To get the
        exact number you would have to count them by hand, or apply Burnside's
        Lemma. See the Maths page on my site if you want details. Jaap

        on some kind of a scene, on something that almost &gt; everybody but

        the rules *are* a little arbitrary. the world is not a black and white
        place. it would be impossible to make a rule that disqualifies a cube
        for a small amount of sanding when the same amount of wear could be
        attributed to normal use. also, there's no logic to magneticly-held
        center-caps being disqualified, but i'm told that they are illegal. so
        the rule is: the judge decides if your cube is ok based on some rough
        guidelines that have been laid out. basicly it seems that this is not
        some kind of olympic sport, and as you noted there is no governing
        committee that oversees standards and rules. you are solving a toy
        puzzle manufactured by a company that decided to try sponsoring a
        competition so they can get p.r. value and sell more toys. so whatever
        the company wants is what goes. if they don't want to take the time to
        assemble a governing committee and as a result the rules end up being a
        little arbitrary, then that's what happens. in the end, i don't think
        it's really going to matter much anyways. if someone shows up with a
        cube that is obviously sanded a lot it will be disqualified. if someone
        else shows up with a cube that was sanded but only enough that it looks
        like normal wear, it will probably not be noticed. oh well. if someone
        pulls at my center caps and notices that they're held on by a magnet and
        my cube gets disqualified, i'll use the cube they provide. i find it the
        "rules" more humorous than truly impactful. i'm not going to worry about
        it. in the end i just want to be there for the fun and competition so i
        can have the key competitors autograph something that will be in my
        framed shadow-box cube shrine. --- In

        the rule &gt; seems a little arbitrary. If someone uses their cube
        enough such &gt; that the inside edges wear down, there doesn't seem to
        be any rule &gt; against that, but if the cube gets to that state by
        sanding inside &gt; edges, it's a disqualification. &gt; &gt; That would
        be like having a rule in baseball that you can't oil your &gt; mitt...
        you have to let it break in from using it. What's the point &gt; of
        that, since you end up with the same product. &gt; &gt; I guess that's

        Their lube is okay, but I would instead recommend a silicone spray -
        take the puzzle apart, spray it, let it dry, and then put it back
        together. Some will say not to take it apart, but I think it works
        better if you do - it can feel a little sticky if you don't. - Grant

        ect. ect.!) Well, I can tell you that the centers break off fairly
        easily. To avoid it, I'd recommend that you avoid doing slice moves
        (instead, move slices with the surrounding face, and then turn the face
        back). That's how I broke mine. They do sell a part replacement kit for
        $5 at Rubiks's online store ( http://www.rubikshop.com/ ), but that only
        gets you 2 center pieces... If you think you'll go through a lot, buy a
        new 4x4x4 cube for $22, and you get 4 of each color, plus replacements
        for the other pieces, in case you lose any. - Grant

        edges first method. Ok, I know it's not very used, but there's perhaps
        some interesting methods to try. If you have ideas or links for me (I
        know the Philip Marshall "ultimate" pages), I'm interested. In fact, the
        problem is in the second part of the resolution. Placing the edges is
        very quick, but after that I don't know what to do to place quickly the
        corners. Looking for, then placing corners with a 3-cube permutation

        happens. &gt; &gt; in the end, i don't think it's really going to matter
        much anyways. &gt; if someone shows up with a cube that is obviously

        a cube that was &gt; sanded but only enough that it looks like normal
        wear, it will &gt; probably not be noticed. oh well. if someone pulls at
        my center &gt; caps and notices that they're held on by a magnet and my
        cube gets &gt; disqualified, i'll use the cube they provide. i find it
        the "rules" &gt; more humorous than truly impactful. i'm not going to
        worry about &gt; it. in the end i just want to be there for the fun and

        Barefoot Chris, I was curious because I also use corners first and have
        toyed with learning the F2L,LL method for the same reason. I average
        about 40 seconds, and my recent best is just under 30 seconds. In the
        end I decided that I would live by my favored method at the WC and if I
        don't go back into my second retirement from the cube after the WC, I'd
        learn the new method. Anyway, I'm trying to figure out whether I'm
        slower than other people because they're better at looking ahead and
        finger tricks, or whether Corners First is intrinsically slower. There's
        still more room for improvement for me (e.g, just saw a post about doing
        the position/orient bottom corners in a single look/algorithm rather
        than 2 looks), I think I can get at least another 5 seconds, but after
        that we'll see. If you are at the WC, find me and say hi. I wouldn't
        pass it up just because you're slow... how many other times are you
        going to get to participate in an world-class competition for something?

        but here and there I try it and I'm only a little slower than usual,
        which is pretty good for something I don't practice. So I would guess
        that corners first is not an intrinsically slow method. I think that if
        I had a good 2x2x2 and learned all the efficient corner algs that my
        corners-first time would improve quite a bit. And there are so many
        possible way to do the edges... David J --- In

        just under 30 seconds. In the end I &gt; decided that I would live by my
        favored method at the WC and if I &gt; don't go back into my second
        retirement from the cube after the WC, &gt; I'd learn the new method.
        Anyway, I'm trying to figure out whether &gt; I'm slower than other
        people because they're better at looking ahead &gt; and finger tricks,
        or whether Corners First is intrinsically slower. &gt; There's still
        more room for improvement for me (e.g, just saw a post &gt; about doing
        the position/orient bottom corners in a single &gt; look/algorithm
        rather than 2 looks), I think I can get at least &gt; another 5 seconds,
        but after that we'll see. &gt; &gt; If you are at the WC, find me and
        say hi. I wouldn't pass it up just &gt; because you're slow... how many
        other times are you going to get to &gt; participate in an world-class

        The fastest I ever got with it is around 40 seconds but it is easily
        &gt; possible to average under 30-My best unlucky time is 35. If I took
        &gt; the time to learn more algs, I could go faster but I'm switching
        &gt; over to a layer system and will persue CF no longer. There is a 99%
        &gt; chance I will not be at WC because this is probably the slowest I
        &gt; will ever be but you can count on seeing me at the next WC.

        I solve edge first sometimes when I'm bored and think there could
        definately be a good speed edge first method. It's faster to place edges
        then corners in the 1st layer so why not the whole cube? To place
        corners, you could 1.first move the cubies to the correct top or bottom
        layer with a few algs(+ there are 3 dimensions to choose from) 2.orient
        1 layer that would have to affect orientation of the other. I counted 37
        possible situations but I'm sure that is wrong. 3. orinet the other
        layer using 1 of 7 algs. 4. permute all using a few algs. step 1 could
        also come after 2&amp;3. --just an idea. I'm not an expert and it does
        seem a little lengthy. --BareFoot Chris --- In

        I think it'll take some time to determinin which layer (top/bottom) a
        corner has to go to. How about: 1. correct orientation of all corners in
        1 alg. 2. move all corners to their correct side (top/bottom) in 1 alg.
        3. permute all corners to their correct position in 1 alg. (part of step
        3 can be done in step 2) The whole solving process: Cross: 6 moves avg.
        F2L Edge (1 pattern):3x4=12 ELL (13 patterns): 8 step 1: 10? (can
        someone figure these out?) step 2: 10? step 3: 10? Total: 56? I'm not
        sure about the # of moves for corner algs, but it seems like it takes
        about the same # of moves to solve the whole thing. The problem with
        this method is, though, that you need 4 major "looks", one before each
        of the last four alg. There must be some other ways to do the corners...

        *are* a little arbitrary. the world is not a black and &gt; white place.
        it would be impossible to make a rule that &gt; disqualifies a cube for
        a small amount of sanding when the same &gt; amount of wear could be
        attributed to normal use. also, there's no &gt; logic to magneticly-held
        center-caps being disqualified, but i'm &gt; told that they are illegal.
        so the rule is: the judge decides if &gt; your cube is ok based on some
        rough guidelines that have been laid &gt; out. &gt; &gt; basicly it
        seems that this is not some kind of olympic sport, and as &gt; you noted
        there is no governing committee that oversees standards &gt; and rules.
        you are solving a toy puzzle manufactured by a company &gt; that decided
        to try sponsoring a competition so they can get p.r. &gt; value and sell
        more toys. so whatever the company wants is what &gt; goes. if they
        don't want to take the time to assemble a governing &gt; committee and
        as a result the rules end up being a little arbitrary, &gt; then that's
        what happens. &gt; &gt; in the end, i don't think it's really going to
        matter much anyways. &gt; if someone shows up with a cube that is
        obviously sanded a lot it &gt; will be disqualified. if someone else
        shows up with a cube that was &gt; sanded but only enough that it looks
        like normal wear, it will &gt; probably not be noticed. oh well. if
        someone pulls at my center &gt; caps and notices that they're held on by
        a magnet and my cube gets &gt; disqualified, i'll use the cube they
        provide. i find it the "rules" &gt; more humorous than truly impactful.
        i'm not going to worry about &gt; it. in the end i just want to be there
        for the fun and competition &gt; so i can have the key competitors
        autograph something that will be &gt; in my framed shadow-box cube

        WC2003 !) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm looking for a speed edges
        first method. Ok, I know it's not &gt; &gt; very &gt; &gt; &gt; used,
        but there's perhaps some interesting methods to try. &gt; &gt; &gt; If
        you have ideas or links for me (I know the Philip &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Marshall "ultimate" pages), I'm interested. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; In fact, the problem is in the second part of the resolution. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Placing the edges is very quick, but after that I don't know
        &gt; &gt; what to &gt; &gt; &gt; do to place quickly the corners.
        Looking for, then placing &gt; &gt; corners &gt; &gt; &gt; with a 3-cube
        permutation isn't fast enough. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ideas ?

        Hey all! I just restickered one of my cubes that was in pretty bad
        shape. Since the method worked really well, I thought I'd share. I
        bought 6 colored plastic folders from wal-mart $.49 each, one of each
        color (though finding a white proved far more difficult than it
        should've been) I reccomend going right around now since they have all
        their back-to-school stuff in heavy stock. These are the kinds with 3
        holes and 2 pockets but no rings (except for the white one, which was
        the only thing I could find in white). The plastic is pretty stiff. I
        also bought some crazy glue. After pulling off all the stickers and
        cleaning the plastic with rubbing alcahol, I went into photoshop. I
        created a simple grid with squares measuring about 9/16" square. fit a
        total of 8x8 of these onto a sheet. This gives you 64 squares, or 10
        extra in case you mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files section
        of this yahoo group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . I printed this sheet
        out cut the squares into groups of 9, usually in two connected rows (8
        &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2, 6 &amp; 3, and 5 &amp; 4). I taped one of each of
        these onto the plastic folders, making sure the tape overlapped by a
        comfortable margin onto the plastic. Then it's simply cutting out the
        stickers along the templates. Once your stickers are cut out, just smear
        a thin layer of superglue onto the sticker and press onto the blank cube
        for a few seconds. Voila a waterproof nice-looking stickered cube. I did
        another cube without the template a few weeks ago and the stickers have
        yet to show any wear. And after 2 cubes (and a few mistakes in cutting
        the plastic due to trial and error) I'd say I still have enough material
        to cut 20+ cube's worth of stickers, at least. Total cost: Less than
        $5.00. I also have a template made for the megaminx, but I have yet to
        try it out, as it's tough to find 12 different colored folders (that
        remotely match the scheme I'm used to). Just thought I'd share! Hope
        this helps some people out.

        I'm sure a cube done this way will be disqualified from the wc though.
        Those rules are very strict. Also, it's not an original idea, Gilles
        came up with it a long time ago. I don't like like it (too permanent),
        but using the neoprene glue he suggests should provide for a
        semi-permanent solution so you won't have to scratch the plastic when/if

        Since I'm an idiot and I can't get my studio cube tension adjusted
        properly, I'm posting on here to bitc...umm..complain. The venting will
        feel great, but please feel free to delete this, because I've never
        really supported non-speedcubing related posts. Originally I was told
        the positive effects of having a studio cube, but I've only encountered
        horrific effects, which again, is probably just my fault. I'm sure
        everyone else's studio cube makes them feel like a genuine cuber. Since
        I got my studio cube to replace my worse speedcube, the following has
        happend: My avg has gone from a consistent sub 34, to a fight to be
        sub40. I avg one piece coming out of my cube per solve. This is because
        when I do pop, it is a super mega ultron pop, like a super hero pop. On
        one occasion my cube ended up scattered in 30 different pieces across my
        room, something i didn't think possible. And when i first got my studio
        cube, in the process of getting off a center cap i stabbed myself, bled

        &gt; &gt; I just restickered one of my cubes that was in &gt; pretty bad
        &gt; shape. &gt; &gt; Since the method worked really well, I thought I'd
        &gt; share. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bought 6 colored plastic folders from
        wal-mart &gt; $.49 each, one of &gt; &gt; each color (though finding a
        white proved far more &gt; difficult than &gt; it &gt; &gt; should've
        been) I reccomend going right around &gt; now since they &gt; have &gt;
        &gt; all their back-to-school stuff in heavy stock. &gt; These are the
        &gt; kinds &gt; &gt; with 3 holes and 2 pockets but no rings (except
        &gt; for the white one, &gt; &gt; which was the only thing I could find
        in white). &gt; The plastic is &gt; &gt; pretty stiff. I also bought
        some crazy glue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After pulling off all the stickers
        and cleaning &gt; the plastic with &gt; &gt; rubbing alcahol, I went
        into photoshop. I created &gt; a simple grid &gt; with &gt; &gt; squares
        measuring about 9/16" square. fit a total &gt; of 8x8 of these &gt; &gt;
        onto a sheet. This gives you 64 squares, or 10 &gt; extra in case you
        &gt; &gt; mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files &gt; section of
        this &gt; yahoo &gt; &gt; group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I printed this sheet out cut the squares into &gt; groups of
        9, usually &gt; in &gt; &gt; two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2, 6
        &amp; 3, and 5 &amp; &gt; 4). I taped one &gt; of &gt; &gt; each of
        these onto the plastic folders, making &gt; sure the tape &gt; &gt;
        overlapped by a comfortable margin onto the &gt; plastic. Then it's &gt;
        &gt; simply cutting out the stickers along the &gt; templates. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Once your stickers are cut out, just smear a thin &gt; layer
        of &gt; superglue &gt; &gt; onto the sticker and press onto the blank
        cube for &gt; a few seconds. &gt; &gt; Voila a waterproof nice-looking
        stickered cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did another cube without the
        template a few &gt; weeks ago and the &gt; &gt; stickers have yet to
        show any wear. And after 2 &gt; cubes (and a few &gt; &gt; mistakes in
        cutting the plastic due to trial and &gt; error) I'd say I &gt; &gt;
        still have enough material to cut 20+ cube's worth &gt; of stickers, at
        &gt; &gt; least. Total cost: Less than $5.00. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also
        have a template made for the megaminx, but &gt; I have yet to &gt; try
        &gt; &gt; it out, as it's tough to find 12 different colored &gt;
        folders (that &gt; &gt; remotely match the scheme I'm used to). &gt;

        Wow, that sounds bad. The best advice I can give you is to tighten the
        screws some more. Do it until they are too tight, so it won't pop, then
        loosen it a bit. But you might want to wear safety gloves, or something.

        I pity a person that would rather have have a program do their cube for
        them then to try the challenge themselves. Why else would you have
        bought the cube in the first place? Especially if you can solve the 3x3,
        the 4x4 could be solved by doing corners (no algs), paring edges (do
        algs, except for a little trick on the last two), solving as a 3x3, and
        then, maybe then coming to the fourm asking about the whole parity
        problem, which btw could anyone out there help me on an issue. I often
        end up on both types of parity issues (single edge flip AND two-edge
        swap), I know the optimal or near optimal methods for solving each
        individually, however is there a compound one for solving both
        symutaneously (or such that afterwards it can now be solved like a 3x3,
        hopefully only LL is altered), Hardwick or Akimoto might be able to
        offer a solution to this problem. So anyways, I suggests attempting it
        for yourself, and I kinda like that there isn't a program out there that
        can solve the 4x4 (that I know of), it makes attempts at it seem less
        trivial. Learn to be good enough (or understand it well enough) to write
        a program/applet that will do the 4x4! -Doug --- In

        I don't mean 'temporary' in that it should fall off in a month. It just
        seems more flexible if it would be easy to take the plastic squares off
        when and if one wants/needs to. It's in the same logic that I wouldn't
        use a whole perimeter of superglue on the center caps, opting for just a
        small drop applied with the end of a needle. Also I don't intend on any
        of my main cubes breaking (unless sombody does something stupid like
        toss it out of a moving vehicle), I hope they last forever. (I add more
        cubes into the rotation so that newer cubes are used much more often
        then the older ones, which I eventually retire.) So I'd rather go for
        the not-as-permanent solution incase of an unforeseeable need..., say 10
        yrs in the future. (For example, I once needed to prepare a minimally
        stickered cube to challenge another cubist.) -Doug --- In

        just restickered one of my cubes that was in pretty bad &gt; &gt; shape.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Since the method worked really well, I thought I'd share.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bought 6 colored plastic folders from
        wal-mart $.49 each, one &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; each color (though
        finding a white proved far more difficult &gt; than &gt; &gt; it &gt;
        &gt; &gt; should've been) I reccomend going right around now since they
        &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; all their back-to-school stuff in heavy
        stock. These are the &gt; &gt; kinds &gt; &gt; &gt; with 3 holes and 2
        pockets but no rings (except for the white &gt; one, &gt; &gt; &gt;
        which was the only thing I could find in white). The plastic is &gt;
        &gt; &gt; pretty stiff. I also bought some crazy glue. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; After pulling off all the stickers and cleaning the
        plastic with &gt; &gt; &gt; rubbing alcahol, I went into photoshop. I
        created a simple grid &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; squares measuring
        about 9/16" square. fit a total of 8x8 of &gt; these &gt; &gt; &gt; onto
        a sheet. This gives you 64 squares, or 10 extra in case &gt; you &gt;
        &gt; &gt; mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files section of this
        &gt; &gt; yahoo &gt; &gt; &gt; group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I printed this sheet out cut the squares into
        groups of 9, &gt; usually &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; two connected rows
        (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2, 6 &amp; 3, and 5 &amp; 4). I taped &gt; one &gt;
        &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; each of these onto the plastic folders, making
        sure the tape &gt; &gt; &gt; overlapped by a comfortable margin onto the
        plastic. Then it's &gt; &gt; &gt; simply cutting out the stickers along
        the templates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once your stickers are cut
        out, just smear a thin layer of &gt; &gt; superglue &gt; &gt; &gt; onto
        the sticker and press onto the blank cube for a few &gt; seconds. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Voila a waterproof nice-looking stickered cube. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I did another cube without the template a few weeks ago
        and the &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers have yet to show any wear. And after 2
        cubes (and a &gt; few &gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes in cutting the plastic due
        to trial and error) I'd say &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; still have enough
        material to cut 20+ cube's worth of stickers, &gt; at &gt; &gt; &gt;
        least. Total cost: Less than $5.00. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also
        have a template made for the megaminx, but I have yet to &gt; &gt; try
        &gt; &gt; &gt; it out, as it's tough to find 12 different colored
        folders (that &gt; &gt; &gt; remotely match the scheme I'm used to).
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I'd share! Hope this helps
        some people out.

        found. I had inexpensive neoprene glue in my toolcase, so I tried it and
        was satisfied with the result. An advantage is you can't ruin your cube
        if glue is in excess. Just rub your finger over it after. But now, at
        last, I've found perfect self-adhesive vinyl film :-)

        Sorry to add this, but it's not to annoy you or anything like that. I

        work out....if any sponsor gives you &gt; grief during cube
        inspection...come and get me!!!! Thanks a lot, this is a very terrific
        offer. It'd be nice not to have to feel like one's trying to cheat the
        system. In my opinion, only other fellow cubists can truly tell/judge
        whether another one is 'cheating.' Perhaps all the rules were
        intentionally left vauge since it will be blantantly obvious if we see
        that someone is trying to pull a quick one. Although it doesn't apply to
        me (again with crossing DanG's direct questioning law), I am curious as
        to why a cube modified with magnets to hold the center caps would be in
        violation of the wc policy. Especially since it can't be seen by the
        camera. It's just a way to stick the center caps on (you'd see if a
        cheating cubist is swapping center caps while cubing). What's next,
        regulating the type&amp;amount of glue people have to use to attach
        their center caps? (Like it has to be the same brand/consistancy as what
        the manufacturer (Hessport or else!!) applied...) Or is it that adding
        magnets, actaully changes the overall weight/inertia of the cube? Then
        all professional bowlers must use the same wieght bowling ball in
        official competitions...??? I know, I know..., again with comparing
        something that is a game/propriatory-toy/puzzle with an olympic sport...
        Actually I heard somewhere (well many places) that Erno's patent will
        expire soon (like less then 10 years), since patents don't last forever.
        Besides, competition is great for consumers! Hessport/Seven- Towns has a
        monopoly over the cube (currently for good reason of course), this is
        around the time many people say "Microsoft is Evil." If the cube was
        produced by many companies, we cubists would have access to better
        quality cubes. It IS nice that rubiks.com finally came out with
        longer-lasting stickers after an era of crudy ones. Erno's
        patent/copyrights can't last forever. Nothing against the man of course,
        he's BRILLIANT for creating this devil, but don't feel sorry for him
        either (be it suffered heafty losses due to all the generic clones that
        floated around) - he's no doubt quite wealthy. -Doug

        speedcube, the following has happend: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My avg has
        gone from a consistent sub 34, to a fight to be sub40. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I avg one piece coming out of my cube per solve. This is because
        &gt; &gt; when I do pop, it is a super mega ultron pop, like a super
        hero &gt; &gt; pop. On one occasion my cube ended up scattered in 30
        different &gt; &gt; pieces across my room, something i didn't think
        possible. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And when i first got my studio cube, in
        the process of getting off &gt; a &gt; &gt; center cap i stabbed myself,
        bled all over my favorite shorts, and &gt; &gt; ruined the center cap.
        Oh yeh, the knife hit the bone, that &gt; always &gt; &gt; feels good.
        But once again, this is because of my excessive &gt; &gt; stupidity.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's ok though cuz i found an old speedcube which I
        will be using &gt; &gt; for the RWC. I sanded the paint off of that

        thats awesome Heath...one question though. Hypothetically speaking;
        suppose one of your screws loosens so much a whole center piece comes
        off. You're going to be cutting yourself a lot more trying to get that
        cap off again. But yeh, those things do come glued super tight. It'd be
        nice if they could send the cube to you without the caps glued or even
        on at all. A friend of mine also cut himself getting a cap off of his
        studio cube. Those things should come with a warning. Or at least
        directions for those who don't know how to stop the bleeding. -Richard

        &gt; Originally I was told the positive effects of &gt; having a studio
        &gt; &gt; cube, &gt; &gt; &gt; but I've only encountered horrific
        effects, &gt; which again, is &gt; &gt; probably &gt; &gt; &gt; just my
        fault. I'm sure everyone else's studio &gt; cube makes them &gt; &gt;
        feel &gt; &gt; &gt; like a genuine cuber. Since I got my studio &gt;
        cube to replace my &gt; &gt; &gt; worse speedcube, the following has
        happend: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My avg has gone from a consistent
        sub 34, to a &gt; fight to be &gt; sub40. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I avg one piece coming out of my cube per solve. &gt; This is &gt;
        because &gt; &gt; &gt; when I do pop, it is a super mega ultron pop,
        &gt; like a super hero &gt; &gt; &gt; pop. On one occasion my cube ended
        up scattered &gt; in 30 different &gt; &gt; &gt; pieces across my room,
        something i didn't think &gt; possible. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        And when i first got my studio cube, in the &gt; process of getting &gt;
        off &gt; &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; center cap i stabbed myself, bled all
        over my &gt; favorite shorts, &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; ruined the center
        cap. Oh yeh, the knife hit &gt; the bone, that &gt; &gt; always &gt;
        &gt; &gt; feels good. But once again, this is because of &gt; my
        excessive &gt; &gt; &gt; stupidity. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's
        ok though cuz i found an old speedcube &gt; which I will be &gt; using
        &gt; &gt; &gt; for the RWC. I sanded the paint off of that &gt; beast,
        and now it's &gt; &gt; &gt; ready for some sticker action. If you are
        still &gt; reading this I &gt; &gt; &gt; don't know whether to

        now. Thnx all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Richard &gt; &gt; I think
        i cut myself atleast 3 times when i was &gt; trying to get the &gt;
        center caps off my studio cube. and yeah i ended up &gt; ruining one of
        &gt; the caps too, I just stole a cap off an old worn out &gt; cube.
        Them &gt; things are glued on there pretty good huh!.....i &gt; hope i
        never have &gt; to take mine off again....i superglued them all back
        &gt; on &gt; lol &gt; ...once you adjust the screws right it should stop
        &gt; poping. &gt; &gt; i feel your pain &gt; &gt; -heath &gt; &gt;

        Oh, I have heard of all sorts of horror stories about accidentally
        getting cut when removing center caps, some much worst then what you
        talk about (admittedly hiting bone is fairly severe). Some one said they
        took off a significant chunk of skin doing this. Personally, I've never
        had any such problem, and, believe me, I have done a lot of this type of
        stuff. (Taking the center tiles off the center caps is one of the
        worst..., oh wait this is almost never neccessary, for some reason I
        remember vaguely doing this a few yrs ago.) I think the worst I've done
        is split open a tile. Anyways, my suggestions (from a few years of
        experience and having re-schemed 2 Mefferts cubes) are to: a) Use a very
        sharp knife, preferably a razor blade for it's thinness (but strong
        enough not to break, because that could cause a much worst injury) b)
        Were some sort of eye protection: googles or glasses. Definately no
        gloves, direct finger contact gives better control/friction. I use my
        lap for stablizing so I put on thick jeans incase. c) Always, and I mean
        ALWAYS, direct force away from you (and make sure no one is in the
        vacinity to prvent from being sued...) d) Gradually, very gradually
        increase the force applied (set a limit, never go over that limit, up
        the limit after finding it futile but go at it from different directions
        first) e) Go at it from different directions before increasing the force
        (for center caps, know how deep the surfacee is before hitting the
        mortise - both in parallel and from the 45 deg angle, going from the
        corners of the caps seem to work well) f) Use a non-sharp, but
        preferably thin object to pry the cap or tile out once you make enough
        room (this way you can use a lot more pressure then doing so with a
        dangerous knife or razorblade) do this using the leverage but be careful
        not to damage the cap or the rest of the center piece (or tile as the
        case may be) (prying from the corner of a cap seem to give good results)
        g) Move on to another one if your stuck, some of these suckers are
        rediculously well bonded/melted/sub-atomically-binded together (ok, a
        bit of an exaggeration) h) Employ chemical means before resorting to
        excessive force: dip it in industrial strength nail-polish remover,
        expose it to excessive temperature changes (in the frezzer then oven,
        and vice-versa), knock it with a hammer a few times gently, etc. i)
        Fingers are so important for speedcubing, don't lose precious dexterity
        and suffer the pain of getting cut! HAPPY CUBING!!! (I'm sure many of
        you will find this a bit silly/excessive, but this is what sets us
        apart... goes with the very definition of a fanatic.) -Doug --- In

        Hana, I can't tell if you're being serious--probably both-- so I &gt;
        &gt; &gt; don't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know whether to respond to you
        seriously. I too was both being &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; facetious but also
        making a serious point. Important questions &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should
        go through the web site (as Dan has requested--I think) &gt; &gt; in
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spite of Dan's generosity in keeping up with this
        group. One &gt; &gt; &gt; reason &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is that outstanding
        speedcubers who aren't participants in this &gt; &gt; &gt; group &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; should have the same access to official WC info as we
        do-- &gt; &gt; belonging &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this group is not a
        requirement for speedcubers. So my point &gt; &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; that if Dan got off this group, people would start asking their
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions through official channels in a hurry! &gt;

        Hi Doug, Are you asking me about combined parity problem solutions?
        Sorry I don't have optimized algorithms either. I think you may not be
        comfortable with the center first method because you need 3 alorithms to
        solve in the most weird case: two adjuscent pairs are swapped and one
        edge pair is flipped. You need 3 rotations like 3x3 (7), Chris's two
        edge pairs swap (7), and permute one edge pair flip (15). Total slice
        moves is 29. With my solution, I don't care edges are paired or not,
        because I solve one edge by one. I do 3 edge rotation (12)(not edge
        pairs!), and permute two edges swap (21). I have four choices for the
        first 3 edges rotation but all are basically identical to me. My case is
        33. In case two non-adjuscent pairs are swapped and one pair is flipped.
        You may want to do Chris's two edges pairs swap (7) and one edge pair
        flip (15). This is the shortest with unoptimized method (22). But I do
        two edges swap in same slice (17) and 3 edges rotation (10). (total=27)
        As you know the total move count does not often correlate to the time. I
        don't know how many people use the solution like me. In case someone may
        be interested in, http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com Masayuki Akimoto

        It's definitely worth giving it a go yourself first. Once you get into
        it, you'll find that it's not much more difficult than the 3x3x3. You
        should be able to use all your 3x3x3 algs, and you only need a few more
        4x4x4-specific algs and you're done! When I first bought a 4x4x4, I too
        was tempted to look up a solution. But I resisted because I knew it
        would be so much more satisfying to get there myself. I spent about 4-5
        days going as far as I could, but then got stuck by the edge parity
        issue in the LL. This is where I looked up the answer (I looked at Chris
        H's LL Revenge solution). I'm a bit disappointed with myself that I
        didn't do the whole thing on my own, but I'm happy that I did *most* of
        it without looking up algs. :) BTW, same goes for the 5x5x5. If you get
        one of those, you'll be able to use all your 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 knowledge
        to solve it. In fact, I pretty much just use intuition + 3x3x3 + 4x4x4
        algs to solve the 5x5x5. I'm sure there are 5x5x5-specific algs for
        faster solves, but I think it can be done with just 3x3x3 + 4x4x4 algs
        (adapted for the larger cube of course though). Jasmine. --- In

        Hi Richard, You are not alone with your troubles with the studio cube.
        The first one i got was adjusted so tightly that it's not only hard to
        turn, but impossible to to take apart; so I can't even get at the center
        caps to try to adjust it. The second one I got had been made into a
        speedcube. when I told the person who made me the cube that it popped
        all the time he was really nice about it, but I don't think believed me.
        But this popping is a well-known problem, and the manufacturer just
        fixed it. Many of the older cubes are flat under the center cap which
        allows the edge cubies to derail, but Seven Towns has gone back to the
        original patent. The newest genuine cubes, which may not be in the
        stores near you yet, have the little arches underneath the center caps
        which prevent that derailing. So even though they don't have the
        adjustable screws they might be workable as speedcubes. Now if they just
        sold the centers to use on our older cubes... David J --- In

        Since I got my studio cube to replace my &gt; worse speedcube, the

        cube per solve. This is because &gt; when I do pop, it is a super mega
        ultron pop, like a super hero &gt; pop. On one occasion my cube ended up
        scattered in 30 different &gt; pieces across my room, something i didn't
        think possible. &gt; &gt; And when i first got my studio cube, in the
        process of getting off a &gt; center cap i stabbed myself, bled all over
        my favorite shorts, and &gt; ruined the center cap. Oh yeh, the knife
        hit the bone, that always &gt; feels good. But once again, this is
        because of my excessive &gt; stupidity. &gt; &gt; It's ok though cuz i
        found an old speedcube which I will be using &gt; for the RWC. I sanded
        the paint off of that beast, and now it's &gt; ready for some sticker

        Though I wasn't able to solve the revenge on my own originally, I did
        come up with my own algs for the two parity problems. Unfortunately,
        neither of them was overly optimal, and the alg I used to fix one
        actually fixed both (or caused the other if it wasn't present). For the
        sake of fixing both parity problems on the 4x4x4, try this (lower case
        means just the slice next to the face in this instance): d (F2 d' F2 d)
        (R2 d' R2 d) (L2 d L2 d') (L2 d2 u2 L2 d2 u2) This sequence flips the FR
        edge pair and swaps it with the FL edge pair. This is only 19 slice
        moves, as compared to Masayuki's 22. You'll notice that the edges and
        centers are all matched up again before the last set of 6 moves, but the
        edges are all out of position. The last 6 moves put things in place. ---

        With my solution, I don't care edges are paired or not, because I &gt;
        solve one edge by one. &gt; I do 3 edge rotation (12)(not edge pairs!),
        and permute two edges &gt; swap (21). I have four choices for the first
        3 edges rotation but all &gt; are basically identical to me. My case is
        33. &gt; &gt; In case two non-adjuscent pairs are swapped and one pair
        is flipped. &gt; You may want to do Chris's two edges pairs swap (7) and
        one edge pair &gt; flip (15). &gt; This is the shortest with unoptimized
        method (22). &gt; But I do two edges swap in same slice (17) and 3 edges
        rotation (10). &gt; (total=27) &gt; As you know the total move count
        does not often correlate to the &gt; time. &gt; &gt; I don't know how
        many people use the solution like me. &gt; In case someone may be

        of my cubes that was in pretty bad shape. &gt; Since the method worked
        really well, I thought I'd share. &gt; &gt; I bought 6 colored plastic
        folders from wal-mart $.49 each, one of &gt; each color (though finding
        a white proved far more difficult than it &gt; should've been) I
        reccomend going right around now since they have &gt; all their
        back-to-school stuff in heavy stock. These are the kinds &gt; with 3
        holes and 2 pockets but no rings (except for the white one, &gt; which
        was the only thing I could find in white). The plastic is &gt; pretty
        stiff. I also bought some crazy glue. &gt; &gt; After pulling off all
        the stickers and cleaning the plastic with &gt; rubbing alcahol, I went
        into photoshop. I created a simple grid with &gt; squares measuring
        about 9/16" square. fit a total of 8x8 of these &gt; onto a sheet. This
        gives you 64 squares, or 10 extra in case you &gt; mess up. I uploaded
        this picture to the Files section of this yahoo &gt; group, it is
        stickertemplate.bmp . &gt; &gt; I printed this sheet out cut the squares
        into groups of 9, usually in &gt; two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp;
        2, 6 &amp; 3, and 5 &amp; 4). I taped one of &gt; each of these onto the
        plastic folders, making sure the tape &gt; overlapped by a comfortable
        margin onto the plastic. Then it's &gt; simply cutting out the stickers
        along the templates. &gt; &gt; Once your stickers are cut out, just
        smear a thin layer of superglue &gt; onto the sticker and press onto the
        blank cube for a few seconds. &gt; Voila a waterproof nice-looking
        stickered cube. &gt; &gt; I did another cube without the template a few
        weeks ago and the &gt; stickers have yet to show any wear. And after 2
        cubes (and a few &gt; mistakes in cutting the plastic due to trial and
        error) I'd say I &gt; still have enough material to cut 20+ cube's worth
        of stickers, at &gt; least. Total cost: Less than $5.00. &gt; &gt; I
        also have a template made for the megaminx, but I have yet to try &gt;
        it out, as it's tough to find 12 different colored folders (that &gt;
        remotely match the scheme I'm used to). &gt; &gt; Just thought I'd
        share! Hope this helps some people out.

        I have been reading all the replys to my post in enjoyment and interest.
        I have also been prying my brain for some positive attributes of having
        a cube that pops too much. I will most likely not be using my studio
        cube for RWC, which I believe I've posted allready, but I think that the
        studio cube (even with its immense pops) is good practice. Playing
        around with my studio cube so much has forced me to execute algorithms
        more exactly. It's hard to explain but praciticing with a "bad" cube may
        very well be a good thing. You fly that much faster when you get a cube
        that doesn't pop. Almost comparable would be when you put your hands in
        cold water, then immediately put them in warm water, the temperature
        seems higher. I think now I'm just rambling on. I've seen the eastsheen
        2x2, 4x4, 5x5...they all are extremely resistent to popping...eastsheen
        should get together with rubiks and figure out a super cube. ---

        are not alone with your troubles with the &gt; studio cube. &gt; &gt;
        The first one i got was adjusted so tightly that &gt; it's not only hard
        &gt; to turn, but impossible to to take apart; so I can't &gt; even get
        at the &gt; center caps to try to adjust it. &gt; &gt; The second one I
        got had been made into a &gt; speedcube. when I told &gt; the person who
        made me the cube that it popped all &gt; the time he was &gt; really
        nice about it, but I don't think believed &gt; me. &gt; &gt; But this
        popping is a well-known problem, and the &gt; manufacturer just &gt;
        fixed it. Many of the older cubes are flat under the &gt; center cap
        which &gt; allows the edge cubies to derail, but Seven Towns &gt; has
        gone back to the &gt; original patent. The newest genuine cubes, which
        may &gt; not be in the &gt; stores near you yet, have the little arches
        &gt; underneath the center caps &gt; which prevent that derailing. &gt;
        &gt; So even though they don't have the adjustable &gt; screws they
        might be &gt; workable as speedcubes. &gt; Now if they just sold the
        centers to use on our &gt; older cubes... &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Originally I was told the positive effects of &gt; having
        a studio cube, &gt; &gt; but I've only encountered horrific effects,
        which &gt; again, is probably &gt; &gt; just my fault. I'm sure everyone
        else's studio &gt; cube makes them feel &gt; &gt; like a genuine cuber.
        Since I got my studio cube &gt; to replace my &gt; &gt; worse speedcube,
        the following has happend: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My avg has gone from a
        consistent sub 34, to a &gt; fight to be sub40. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        avg one piece coming out of my cube per solve. &gt; This is because &gt;
        &gt; when I do pop, it is a super mega ultron pop, like &gt; a super
        hero &gt; &gt; pop. On one occasion my cube ended up scattered &gt; in
        30 different &gt; &gt; pieces across my room, something i didn't think
        &gt; possible. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And when i first got my studio cube,
        in the &gt; process of getting off a &gt; &gt; center cap i stabbed
        myself, bled all over my &gt; favorite shorts, and &gt; &gt; ruined the
        center cap. Oh yeh, the knife hit the &gt; bone, that always &gt; &gt;
        feels good. But once again, this is because of my &gt; excessive &gt;
        &gt; stupidity. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's ok though cuz i found an old
        speedcube which &gt; I will be using &gt; &gt; for the RWC. I sanded the
        paint off of that &gt; beast, and now it's &gt; &gt; ready for some
        sticker action. If you are still &gt; reading this I &gt; &gt; don't
        know whether to congradulate you or laugh, &gt; but I'm done for &gt;
        &gt; now. Thnx all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Richard &gt; &gt;

        into photoshop. I created a simple grid &gt; with &gt; &gt; squares
        measuring about 9/16" square. fit a total of 8x8 of these &gt; &gt; onto
        a sheet. This gives you 64 squares, or 10 extra in case you &gt; &gt;
        mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files section of this &gt; yahoo
        &gt; &gt; group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        printed this sheet out cut the squares into groups of 9, usually &gt; in
        &gt; &gt; two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2, 6 &amp; 3, and 5
        &amp; 4). I taped one &gt; of &gt; &gt; each of these onto the plastic
        folders, making sure the tape &gt; &gt; overlapped by a comfortable
        margin onto the plastic. Then it's &gt; &gt; simply cutting out the
        stickers along the templates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once your stickers are
        cut out, just smear a thin layer of &gt; superglue &gt; &gt; onto the
        sticker and press onto the blank cube for a few seconds. &gt; &gt; Voila
        a waterproof nice-looking stickered cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did
        another cube without the template a few weeks ago and the &gt; &gt;
        stickers have yet to show any wear. And after 2 cubes (and a few &gt;
        &gt; mistakes in cutting the plastic due to trial and error) I'd say I
        &gt; &gt; still have enough material to cut 20+ cube's worth of
        stickers, at &gt; &gt; least. Total cost: Less than $5.00. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I also have a template made for the megaminx, but I have yet
        to try &gt; &gt; it out, as it's tough to find 12 different colored
        folders (that &gt; &gt; remotely match the scheme I'm used to). &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I'd share! Hope this helps some people out.

        I agree with Grant... so I don't fall into the "purist" category. Many
        disciplines--science, sports--move forward not because each new
        innovator recreates the wheel from scratch, but because they take full
        advantage of what's already been discovered, and then innovate from
        there. Not that there's anything wrong with trying to solve the cube on
        one's own as well... I think both approaches offer their own challenges
        and rewards. Date: Sat, 09 Aug 2003 01:23:31 -0000 From: "dmswart1"

        Hana, The WC committee doesn't have a formal relationship with, nor does
        it mention in its materials, any Yahoo discussion groups. Dan answers
        questions here simply because he wants to. My understanding is that the
        WC committee officially dispenses information and answers questions
        through the web site and the phone numbers listed on the web site.
        Having said that though, I'm glad to have the quick response we get from
        Dan here. Speaking of which, I'm going to ask on the WC web site, but
        I'll also ask here: should we expect to get anything in the mail about

        I just had an idea- I just bought custom vinyl self-adhering boat
        letters online. The stuff is good quality and not too expensive. Go to
        http://www.speedysigns.com/decals/ and click on bumper stickers. There
        you can upload the colors you want(you could even put a side of the cube
        in a scanner to get the color exact). When you get the sticker, just cut
        it up into squares and stick 'em on the cube! --barefoot Chris --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just restickered one of my cubes that was in
        pretty bad &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shape. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since the
        method worked really well, I thought I'd share. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bought 6 colored plastic folders from
        wal-mart $.49 each, &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; each color (though finding a white proved far more difficult &gt;
        &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should've
        been) I reccomend going right around now since &gt; they &gt; &gt; &gt;
        have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all their back-to-school stuff in heavy
        stock. These are the &gt; &gt; &gt; kinds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with
        3 holes and 2 pockets but no rings (except for the white &gt; &gt; &gt;
        one, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which was the only thing I could find in
        white). The plastic &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty stiff.
        I also bought some crazy glue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; After pulling off all the stickers and cleaning the plastic
        &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubbing alcahol, I went into
        photoshop. I created a simple &gt; &gt; grid &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; squares measuring about 9/16" square. fit a
        total of 8x8 of &gt; &gt; &gt; these &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto a
        sheet. This gives you 64 squares, or 10 extra in case &gt; &gt; you &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files
        section of &gt; this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yahoo &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I printed this sheet out cut the squares into groups of
        9, &gt; &gt; &gt; usually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2, 6 &amp; 3, and 5 &amp;
        4). I taped &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; each of these onto the plastic folders, making sure the tape &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overlapped by a comfortable margin onto the plastic.
        Then &gt; &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply cutting out the
        stickers along the templates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Once your stickers are cut out, just smear a thin layer of
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superglue &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto the sticker
        and press onto the blank cube for a few &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Voila a waterproof nice-looking stickered cube. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did another cube without
        the template a few weeks ago and &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        stickers have yet to show any wear. And after 2 cubes (and a &gt; &gt;
        few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes in cutting the plastic due to
        trial and error) I'd &gt; &gt; say I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still have
        enough material to cut 20+ cube's worth of &gt; &gt; stickers, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; at &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least. Total cost: Less than $5.00.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also have a template
        made for the megaminx, but I have yet &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; try
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it out, as it's tough to find 12 different
        colored folders &gt; &gt; (that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remotely match
        the scheme I'm used to). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Just thought I'd share! Hope this helps some people out.

        white). The plastic &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty stiff.
        I also bought some crazy glue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; After pulling off all the stickers and cleaning the plastic
        &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubbing alcahol, I went into
        photoshop. I created a simple &gt; &gt; grid &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; squares measuring about 9/16" square. fit a
        total of 8x8 of &gt; &gt; &gt; these &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto a
        sheet. This gives you 64 squares, or 10 extra in case &gt; &gt; you &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files
        section of &gt; this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yahoo &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I printed this sheet out cut the squares into groups of
        9, &gt; &gt; &gt; usually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2, 6 &amp; 3, and 5 &amp;
        4). I taped &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; each of these onto the plastic folders, making sure the tape &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overlapped by a comfortable margin onto the plastic.
        Then &gt; &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply cutting out the
        stickers along the templates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Once your stickers are cut out, just smear a thin layer of
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superglue &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto the sticker
        and press onto the blank cube for a few &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Voila a waterproof nice-looking stickered cube. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did another cube without
        the template a few weeks ago and &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        stickers have yet to show any wear. And after 2 cubes (and a &gt; &gt;
        few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes in cutting the plastic due to
        trial and error) I'd &gt; &gt; say I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still have
        enough material to cut 20+ cube's worth of &gt; &gt; stickers, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; at &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least. Total cost: Less than $5.00.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also have a template
        made for the megaminx, but I have yet &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; try
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it out, as it's tough to find 12 different
        colored folders &gt; &gt; (that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remotely match
        the scheme I'm used to). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Just thought I'd share! Hope this helps some people out.

        Hey Dan, I saw on the documentary trailers that you seem to finish the
        cube with the middle layer between the left and right face. I've heard
        you say that it's similar to Marc Waterman's method. Do you orient and

        Since it itsn't specified that it's directed at Chris or anyone in
        particular, I'll offer an answer. This kinda depends on whether the
        remaining two edges are adjacent or diagonal of each other (hopefully
        both on a middle layer as Hardwick suggests). I usually grip such that
        one of the problem edges on the FL slot, and the other on one of the R
        slots (RF or RB). Then I apply R2 or not in order to get the same pieces
        on the same layers (read this twice, if you don't see what I mean). Then
        I apply (Uu)' or (Uu)2' to line up a skew pair, lets denote this manuver
        by P (because it could of just been u' or u2 also, doesn't matter). Then
        do a MONO-FLIP of that skew edge, call this X. Finish with P^-1. This is
        done mathematically as P*X*P^-1, a process known as conjugation. I'll
        let you figure out what a mono-flip is, that's the fun part, any
        monoflip that doesn't affect the u and d layers are fine (must not
        affect center rotation of F,L,R,B either) (Jaap's site is a good source
        for this group theory stuff by the way). I try to go for a mono-flip
        that starts me off in solving the partitioned 3x3x3. -Doug --- In

        Even though this page is interesting in its own right, wrapping an
        already existing cube in cardboart to make it look like a Rubik's cube
        is not cube art, because this type of art does not use Rubik's cube as
        art medium. I admit that teiddling an 8'x8'x8' cube would be rather
        difficult, assuming it was built like the 3x3x3 cube. It would be fun to

        Can someone remind me of the plan re meeting up pre-competition? The
        most recent message I can find it this one, which mentions 8pm in the
        Crowne Plaza bar on the 21st or 22nd. Did we decide which date? I'm
        probably going to be staying with a friend rather than at the hotel, but
        I'm definitely keen to meet up with people since I'm now planning on
        arriving a bit early too. Jasmine. --- In

        I sort of stopped cubing after either messing up the hungy cubes I got,
        or getting messed up ones. In any case, I got more interested in video
        games(competitively though). I picked up a cube recently and found out I
        forgot most of the OLL. Maybe sometime in the future I'll pick it up
        again for kicks, but it just doesn't old any satisfaction for me
        anymore. Probably because I'm a pessimist. There can be only one person
        that's the best. You could be it, but the ammount of time to put into it
        is sickening. Even if you have a natural talent for it. So why even
        bother? Really 20 seconds, 19 seconds, 1 second doesn't have any meaning
        but what you give it. At least this is how I view it. I know other
        people view it differently and its fun to be as efficient as possible...
        I don't know. I know it can be addicting, but only for so long... I mean
        really, there's a point where addictions become unhealthy. Though I
        should speak, I spend 8 hours playing counter- strike, lol.... Anyway,
        cube on my friends, I still love watching other people solve it fast.
        And as long as I have my 27 second solve video for me to show people,
        I'll be satisified. ttfn

        Hey all! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just restickered one of my
        cubes that was in pretty &gt; bad &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shape. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since the method worked really well, I thought
        I'd share. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        bought 6 colored plastic folders from wal-mart $.49 &gt; each, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each color
        (though finding a white proved far more &gt; difficult &gt; &gt; &gt;
        than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should've
        been) I reccomend going right around now since &gt; &gt; they &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all their back-to-school
        stuff in heavy stock. These are &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kinds &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with 3 holes and 2 pockets but no rings (except
        for the &gt; white &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; which was the only thing I could find in white). The &gt; plastic
        &gt; &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty stiff. I also
        bought some crazy glue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; After pulling off all the stickers and cleaning the &gt;
        plastic &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubbing
        alcahol, I went into photoshop. I created a &gt; simple &gt; &gt; &gt;
        grid &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; squares
        measuring about 9/16" square. fit a total of 8x8 &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; these &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto a sheet. This gives you 64
        squares, or 10 extra in &gt; case &gt; &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files section of &gt;
        &gt; this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yahoo &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I printed this sheet out cut the squares into
        groups of 9, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2,
        6 &amp; 3, and 5 &amp; 4). I &gt; taped &gt; &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each of these onto the
        plastic folders, making sure the &gt; tape &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        overlapped by a comfortable margin onto the plastic. Then &gt; &gt; &gt;
        it's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply cutting out the stickers along
        the templates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Once your stickers are cut out, just smear a thin layer of &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superglue &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto the
        sticker and press onto the blank cube for a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Voila a waterproof nice-looking
        stickered cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I did another cube without the template a few weeks ago &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers have yet to
        show any wear. And after 2 cubes &gt; (and a &gt; &gt; &gt; few &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes in cutting the plastic due to trial
        and error) &gt; I'd &gt; &gt; &gt; say I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        still have enough material to cut 20+ cube's worth of &gt; &gt; &gt;
        stickers, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least.
        Total cost: Less than $5.00. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also have a template made for the megaminx, but I
        have &gt; yet &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; it out, as it's tough to find 12 different colored
        folders &gt; &gt; &gt; (that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remotely
        match the scheme I'm used to). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I'd share! Hope this helps some people
        out.

        &gt; &gt; Hey all! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just restickered
        one of my cubes that was in pretty &gt; &gt; bad &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; shape. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since the method
        worked really well, I thought I'd share. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bought 6 colored plastic
        folders from wal-mart $.49 &gt; &gt; each, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each color
        (though finding a white proved far more &gt; &gt; difficult &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; should've been) I reccomend going right around now since &gt;
        &gt; &gt; they &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; all their back-to-school stuff in heavy stock. These are &gt;
        &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kinds &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; with 3 holes and 2 pockets but no rings (except for the &gt; &gt;
        white &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        which was the only thing I could find in white). The &gt; &gt; plastic
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty stiff.
        I also bought some crazy glue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After pulling off all the stickers and
        cleaning the &gt; &gt; plastic &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubbing alcahol, I went into photoshop. I created a
        &gt; &gt; simple &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grid &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; squares measuring about 9/16"
        square. fit a total of 8x8 &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto a sheet. This gives you 64
        squares, or 10 extra in &gt; &gt; case &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files
        section of &gt; &gt; &gt; this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yahoo &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        printed this sheet out cut the squares into groups of &gt; 9, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; usually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2, 6 &amp; 3,
        and 5 &amp; 4). I &gt; &gt; taped &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each of these onto
        the plastic folders, making sure the &gt; &gt; tape &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; overlapped by a comfortable margin onto the plastic. &gt;
        Then &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply
        cutting out the stickers along the templates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once your stickers are cut
        out, just smear a thin layer &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        superglue &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto the sticker and press
        onto the blank cube for a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Voila a waterproof nice-looking stickered
        cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I did another cube without the template a few weeks ago &gt; &gt;
        and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers
        have yet to show any wear. And after 2 cubes &gt; &gt; (and a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes in cutting the
        plastic due to trial and error) &gt; &gt; I'd &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still have enough material to cut 20+
        cube's worth of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        at &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least. Total cost: Less than
        $5.00. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I also have a template made for the megaminx, but I have &gt; &gt;
        yet &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it out, as it's tough to find 12 different colored
        &gt; folders &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; remotely match the scheme I'm used to). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I'd share!
        Hope this helps some people out.

        I just had an idea- I just bought custom vinyl self-adhering boat &gt;
        &gt; &gt; letters online. The stuff is good quality and not too
        expensive. &gt; Go &gt; &gt; &gt; to http://www.speedysigns.com/decals/
        and click on bumper &gt; stickers. &gt; &gt; &gt; There you can upload
        the colors you want(you could even put a &gt; side &gt; &gt; &gt; of the
        cube in a scanner to get the color exact). When you get &gt; the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; sticker, just cut it up into squares and stick 'em on the
        cube! &gt; &gt; &gt; --barefoot Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---

        &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; squares measuring

        case &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files section &gt; of &gt;

        9, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        that many would agree are better (made by EastSheen) go to

        Hi friends, Today after lunch break my colleagues surprised me by
        setting up a "full WC environment" in which I needed to set an average
        of 12 cubes. We followed the same rules, the only difference being that
        one of my colleagues used a stopwatch instead of a speedstacking timer.
        They were really putting pressure on me, and many colleagues were
        watching. It felt like I was on that stage, and I wasn't happy with my
        performance. Do not consider this a way to make you guys nervous, but
        here are some things that you have to take notice of. This experience
        helped me, so maybe it will help you too. 1) your hands may feel cold 2)
        your hands may feel wet 3) you may want to go too fast This may result
        in: a) many more mistakes than normal (like wrong order of cross edges,
        wrong corner/edge pairs, OLL/PLL going wrong) b) more time to find F2L
        pairs c) more cube lock-ups d) more cube pops Be prepared! He who
        performs better under pressure will win the WC. Tomorrow we will give it
        another try. Good luck and have fun, Ron http://www.speedcubing.com

        Hi All, If any of you are tired of dealing with stickers you could
        always find a Rubik's Game cube, like:
        http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3141894774&amp;category=19187
        These cubes are adjustable and don't have a tendency to pop, and the
        plastic is slick. They are a version of the deluxe cube, but aren't as
        expensive. David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey all! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just restickered one of my
        cubes that was in pretty &gt; bad &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shape. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since the method worked really well, I thought
        I'd share. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        bought 6 colored plastic folders from wal-mart $.49 &gt; each, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each color
        (though finding a white proved far more &gt; difficult &gt; &gt; &gt;
        than &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should've
        been) I reccomend going right around now since &gt; &gt; they &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all their back-to-school
        stuff in heavy stock. These are &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kinds &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with 3 holes and 2 pockets but no rings (except
        for the &gt; white &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; which was the only thing I could find in white). The &gt; plastic
        &gt; &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty stiff. I also
        bought some crazy glue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; After pulling off all the stickers and cleaning the &gt;
        plastic &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubbing
        alcahol, I went into photoshop. I created a &gt; simple &gt; &gt; &gt;
        grid &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; squares
        measuring about 9/16" square. fit a total of 8x8 &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; these &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto a sheet. This gives you 64
        squares, or 10 extra in &gt; case &gt; &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; mess up. I uploaded this picture to the Files section of &gt;
        &gt; this &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yahoo &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        group, it is stickertemplate.bmp . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I printed this sheet out cut the squares into
        groups of 9, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2,
        6 &amp; 3, and 5 &amp; 4). I &gt; taped &gt; &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each of these onto the
        plastic folders, making sure the &gt; tape &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        overlapped by a comfortable margin onto the plastic. Then &gt; &gt; &gt;
        it's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply cutting out the stickers along
        the templates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Once your stickers are cut out, just smear a thin layer of &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superglue &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onto the
        sticker and press onto the blank cube for a few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Voila a waterproof nice-looking
        stickered cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I did another cube without the template a few weeks ago &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers have yet to
        show any wear. And after 2 cubes &gt; (and a &gt; &gt; &gt; few &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes in cutting the plastic due to trial
        and error) &gt; I'd &gt; &gt; &gt; say I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        still have enough material to cut 20+ cube's worth of &gt; &gt; &gt;
        stickers, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least.
        Total cost: Less than $5.00. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also have a template made for the megaminx, but I
        have &gt; yet &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; it out, as it's tough to find 12 different colored
        folders &gt; &gt; &gt; (that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remotely
        match the scheme I'm used to). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I'd share! Hope this helps some people
        out.

        21st or 22nd. Did we decide which date? I'm probably going to be staying
        with a friend rather than at the hotel, but I'm definitely keen to meet
        up with people since I'm now planning on arriving a bit early too.

        Subject: Non-cubers? My fiance will be coming to Toronto as well. He's
        not a cuber, but he is keen to see the amazing cubing feats at the
        Championships. And the amazing cube art (I've told him about your work
        Hana!). Do other people have non-cubing family/friends travelling with
        them? Jasmine.

        Hey nice video. However I must say the cases seemed rather easy. The
        cross wasn't too complex to solve (in fact it was already half-done) and
        the F2L placements were utilizing short algorithms. Additionally once
        you reached the LL it instantly progressed into the point where all that
        was needed was a sune (cool but fairly hard to get). Aside from that it
        was a fun video to watch. You know what you're doing :P Keep it up

        Yeah they were almost all easy cases, but I had few pauses, thats what
        really made ME happy. Um, tips for beginners, um, well, I've only been
        cubing for 3 and a half months. So I'll tell you what I did.. I was
        avging about 1:15. So I learned the F2L, and continued using my old LL
        system. Then When I was avging a Minute, I learned the 4 look LL, I used
        that until I hit 45 seconds avg. Now I'm learning the 3 look LL, and
        once I can avg 30 on that I'm gonne switch ver to the 2 look. Just a

        yeah, I have about 20 F2L and LL algs memorized. there is a way I found
        to do the F2LL that only requires 2 algs, but it takes some thinking and
        moving corner pieces in by themselves, so it is kind of slow. I get mad
        at myself when I use those 2 too much and it slows me down. It is good
        to not get into a habbit of using the same ones over and over. --- In

        Hi, guys! I got a new best average today: 16 19 16 17 20 19 19 19
        (11)(23)18 21 =&gt;18.4+0.5 =18.9 This is my first sub-19 average. The
        11-second time was a PLL skip. It could even have been a non- lucky 13
        second solve if I DIDN'T get lucky... I used the scrambling algorithms

        edges down through the middle. It is not difficult, while building this
        much, to "drag in" the nearest already oriented edges into those holes
        (or by some other method). Ryan

        &gt; Gilles. Hi Gilles, Very interesting. This is almost the same as the
        way I solve the 4x4x4. I wondered if it would be good for solving the
        3x3x3, and now I see it can be. Vey cool. Your illustrations are the

        I am really excited to see the new speed cubing systems that people have
        invented in the past year. I am interested in finding the ultimate
        system that will allow someone to break the 10 second barrier - average.
        Yes, it is more like a lifetime ambition, but that's good because it
        will be sure to maintain my interested in the cube long into the future.
        I predict that a 13 second average, or something close, will be achieved
        somewhere in the near future. The standard F2L+OLL+PLL has been tested
        and well proven. However, it is not the fastest system possible. We
        should not stop looking just because we have found something that is the
        fastest we have found so far. In my opinion, as we try to shave off more
        and more moves, it becomes limiting to divide the solution into rigid
        steps. There is no single sequence of steps that, if followed every
        time, will always produce an elegant solution. Thus, I think that an
        intuitive-based system will be the key for eventually breaking the 10
        second barrier. We would need to have a more advanced understanding of
        the cube, to not blindly apply algorithms, and perhaps also to be fully
        aware of pieces all around the cube. Blindfolded cubing may be helpful
        practice for this. Ryan

        I use a variation of this method. I swap some steps around depending on
        cases encountered, and do a few other optimizations like solving at
        least one edge piece while doing the LL corners. I came up with
        something similar a few years ago and have been using it ever since.

        Hello. This is my first time posting, although ive been reading for
        about 2-3 weeks. Just for background info, I'm an ingoing 10th grader
        who's been moderately cubing for not very long. Ive only learned the
        solutions from &lt;http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm&gt;, both which are
        beginner level solutions, yet have broken the 1 minute barrier with the
        second solution and gotten a best of 35 seconds. A question which has
        been nagging me for quite some time is the process of memorizing
        algorithms. I tried learning the Fridrich method and got all the way to
        f2l pretty okay (without algorithms). My question is a fast and
        effective way to learn the rest of the algorithms. I am starting to get
        serious about the cube and hope to go the WC2005 (if there is one).
        Anything is appreciated. Thanks in advance. -soupkid

        (ie. discarded) times were 39s and 59s. I did this average while

        DanG, I was hoping someone would give me the generally-accepted
        procedure for scoring the situation described below, but maybe you can
        just tell me how it would be ruled at the WC. In this week's Sunday
        Contest I did my best average of 10, but one of the times in the middle
        was a pop. The piece didn't come all the way off the cube so I pushed it
        back in and kept going. Just in case that time was going to be counted
        as a pop and thrown out, I did a 13th time. Either way it's going to be
        my best average but I'm not sure whether I can use the time from the pop
        or whether I have to throw it out and use my 13th time. Let me know if
        this isn't clear. Hope you're not too overwhelmed leading up to next
        week's event. Thanks, Adam --- In

        how the position of my elbows can affect the movement of my hands. Also
        I think that we'll need to stand at the WC. So it's better to get used
        to that. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "mackymakisumi"

        Hi all :-) I made a new best average.
        17+18+21+18+18+18+21+17+(16)+22+19+(23) = 18.9 + 0.5 = 19.4 sec. When I
        did the last "19sec" , I was happy because I knew I broke my old average
        and I thought I did 12 cubes ! but I had still to do more one cube. I
        made the last attempt with a bit pressure :-) I still have to learn 19
        OLL but I hope i'll learn this for toronto. I hope see you all in
        toronto ! Thomas

        Like it was suggested several months ago, it is much cheaper to get a
        plane ticket to New York and take a cab or something to Toronto (so that
        it's not considered an international flight, but rather a domestic one).
        Cab fare might be a bit expensive, rent a car, or ask the many NY cubers
        if they could give you a ride (for gas money as you suggested). Just

        My fiance just did a search on www.travelocity.com for Denver &lt;--&gt;
        Toronto roundtrip, leaving 22 Aug, returning 25 Aug and saw prices of
        $US368 and $US377 (not sure if this included taxes or not). It was
        flying Continental Airlines and had one connection (ie. not a direct

        the fares above are pretty cheap. Jasmine. --- In

        Hi everybody, my first post in this group will be an algorithm question:
        I have solved the rubiks revenge almost completely, I first turned it
        into a "3x3x3", but with one flaw. The yellow and white faces never got
        solved, still half the white face is yellow, and vice versa. The rest of
        the revenge is solved, though. My question is, does anyone have clue on
        how to solve this case? Since the rest of the cube is solved I cant
        afford to mess up any other cubies in favor of these last two faces. I
        dont have the revenge on me right now, and I havent looked at it for a
        few days, but it looks like one of these two alternatives (not sure
        which): F W W W W W W W W W Y Y W W W W W B Y Y Y Y Y W W Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
        Y Y or F W W W W W W W W W Y Y W W W W W B Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y W W Y Y Y Y
        Y Reminder: The rest of the cube is SOLVED. Again, I cant use algorithms
        that mess up certain other cubies in favour of these two faces, unless I
        have further algorithms to use. So ... Any suggestions? If you want to
        help me out, best way is by mail, albin.thorning@h... It would be sooo
        sweet to get this thing over with .. So I can scramble it again and
        start over :p

        I am having trouble getting a fast cross. How do you deal with pieces
        that may not be oriented correctly? Or those that, if you orient,
        DISorient another? Sometimes it seems like in order to make a cross it'd
        take too many moves. What are your methods?

        n---, you might just have to get used to it: know how to deal with the
        basic patterns...know how a move to get in a cross piece might affect
        another cross piece...and see ahead... When you have mastered the cross,
        you should be able to take advantage of any combination of
        position/orientation the cross pieces are in... Almost all cross can be
        solved within 6 moves or so. The best advice I can give you is, keep
        trying! I hope that helps, Macky --- In

        p.s. I make the cross on D-face. makes it harder to see ahead on cross,
        but less delay between cross and F2L. After much practice, even cross
        and F2L all in one smooth fingering becomes possible (I can almost never
        do that though) it might be a good option to think about... Macky --- In

        Hi, I would suggest using Ron's Cube Solver Tool (go to speedcubing.com,
        click on tools and other stuff). You can set up different cross
        scenarios, making sure you ignore everything except the cross pieces by
        turning the other pieces gray. Have the Cube Solver find a
        solution...and you will see how to efficiently form a cross, given any
        situation...it's a wonderful tool. Bill

        It could be on Rubiks.com, or maybe rubikschamps.com. It would be more
        &gt; organized and easier to follow messages. Can you post a url so we
        can see for ourselves if it is more organised and easier to follow?
        Considering I could not find it, I doubt it's organised or easy to
        follow. On Rubik's Champs, the menu is: Venue, Rules/Info, Events,
        Register, Contact, Records, Competition, Information, Cube Links, Press.
        Which one would "forums" be under?? On Rubiks.com, the menu is:
        Products, Play Online, Information, Promotion, Contact, Links, plus some
        icons without labels. Which one would "forums" be under?? Of course, you
        know my opinion on all this ;-) I think neither Rubik's Champs nor
        Rubiks.com should be allowed to host our community forum because then
        there would be commercial interests involved (in the Rubik's cube
        specifically). They may be direct or indirect influences (in the case of
        rubiks.com via rubikschamps). I think it would be unfair for any single
        "cube company" to get into such a powerful position. You have already
        seen the effects of this at the championships, which not everybody is
        entirely happy with. For example, in that instance, Rubiks.com is in a
        position to stamp out any other brands of cube for the competition. For
        a discussion forum, we are not so helpless that we must turn to the help
        of a company that clearly wants to stamp out other brands of cube (or
        turn to one that is easily influenced by such a company). Ryan

        I think Ryan makes a good point. There's a big difference between (a)
        aving a corporate sponsor for a not-for-profit group, event, forum,
        whatever (where the organizers decide to bring on the sponsor and
        negotiate a sponsorship relationship), and (b) putting a company in a
        position where they ARE the organizing group, and can shape the group,
        event, forum, whatever to fit their corporate interest. Now I realize
        that the current WC, and the RCC that's referred to on the Rubikschamps
        site, fall into the latter category, but I think this is a case where
        it's a good thing, since it's filling a void that was not being
        addressed previously. Ideally though Rubiks Cube enthusiasts would form
        their own not-for-profit group/committee and manage the sponsor
        relationships. I was actually thinking, after the WC, about seeing if
        there was interest in the US in forming a non-profit organization that
        would formalize competition standards, certify records, and organize
        annual or biennial American championships on a regular basis--I guess
        kind of like the speedstacking association. I thought about trying it in
        the US first because it minimizes travel issues (compared with a
        worldwide group), and because I am already familiar with the laws
        regarding forming a non-profit organization here. And because I like the
        idea of having regional and national championships in addition to world
        championships--their easier to pull together! Date: Fri, 15 Aug 2003

        there is no need for a non profit group for cubing people... please

        after this event will have a representative from the cubing community

        i have been the one fighting them to get what WE AS A CLUB WANT.... all
        they requested was good looking cubes and good stickers. i fought them
        tooth and nail on hundreds of issues surrounding their product and i won
        every battle.... they wanted 1 color scheme...we did not...i voice
        opinion....we now have multiple schemes permitted......... the way
        things are now IS JUST FINE to 85 plus percent of the people in this

        will try to fix that soon...(hopely) The "crazy thing" in the back is a
        building blocks (except they're not blocks). I've had it since when I
        was 4 or 5. It comes in 4 shapes (triangle, square, pentagon, and
        hexagon) and in 6 colors (colors of the cube when the orenge sticker has
        completely been peeled off). You can connect the sides of the blocks to
        create weird- looking 3-D objects. It's not like I play with it anymore,

        One of the local Television News stations, http://www.9and10news.com ,
        contacted me this morning about interveiwing me. We set up an

        they'll have for me and I don't know what I'm going to say. The only
        thing that is certain is that I will solve the cube as fast as I can for
        them and hopefully impress or get more people interested in Northern

        Dan, Several times when someone who hasn't been registered for the WC
        has asked you a question about it, you've responded with something to
        the effect of "you're not even registered so what does it matter to
        you." In fact, you said that to me once before I was registered. So I
        think it's fair to turn that comment back around on you and ask why you
        care about whether American speedcubers decide to organize an American
        speedcubing club? You're from Canada! ;-) Seriously though... my primary
        interest is to develop a group that American speed cubers can join, that
        would promote speedcubing and organize national competitions where we
        could compete regularly in person. If someone is going to start that
        sort of club, you HAVE to incorporate (either as a non-profit or
        for-profit) or else the group won't actually exist... it would just be
        an informal association of individuals, which for a number of reasons
        doesn't always benefit the group or the members. I am envisioning an
        cube organization in the states to be a "membership organization" where
        anyone could join and have a say in the organization's activities. From
        what I understand, the RCC is (1) not a U.S. organization, (2) is not
        actually an officially (i.e. legally) organized entity (3) is not an
        open organization but rather a private group that restricts membership
        to a narrowly defined set of people. Look, like I said before, that's
        great...you all are organizing a spectacular event that I'm looking
        forward to attending. But I can tell you because I've been a member of
        several open membership clubs (such as the New York Road Runners Club,
        which puts on the New York Marathon) that it's a different type of
        thing. Let me reiterate... not better, just different. Perhaps you're
        right that 85% of people on this group aren't interested in a US
        speedcubing club. That's probably because 85% of the people on this
        group aren't from the US! Finally, remember America is a big spread-out
        country with a large percentage of speedcubers. It's harder for us to
        connect with each other and a club like this could help. Anyway, I
        brought this up in response to another post. My intent was to wait to
        propose this to the Americans in this group until after the WC, because
        I thought it would be useful for us all to meet each other in person
        first. I plan to table this until next month. "8 days left..." Holy cow!
        It sure has crept up on us fast. Talk to you (in person) soon. By the
        way, heard you all may have been part of the blackout. Hope you didn't
        lose power for too long. Best, Adam --- In

        There's a big difference between &gt; &gt; (a) aving a corporate sponsor
        for a not-for-profit group, event, &gt; &gt; forum, whatever (where the
        organizers decide to bring on the &gt; sponsor &gt; &gt; and negotiate a
        sponsorship relationship), and (b) putting a &gt; company &gt; &gt; in a
        position where they ARE the organizing group, and can shape &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; group, event, forum, whatever to fit their corporate interest.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I realize that the current WC, and the RCC
        that's referred to &gt; on &gt; &gt; the Rubikschamps site, fall into
        the latter category, but I think &gt; &gt; this is a case where it's a
        good thing, since it's filling a void &gt; &gt; that was not being
        addressed previously. Ideally though Rubiks &gt; Cube &gt; &gt;
        enthusiasts would form their own not-for-profit group/committee and &gt;
        &gt; manage the sponsor relationships. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was
        actually thinking, after the WC, about seeing if there was &gt; &gt;
        interest in the US in forming a non-profit organization that would &gt;
        &gt; formalize competition standards, certify records, and organize &gt;
        annual &gt; &gt; or biennial American championships on a regular
        basis--I guess kind &gt; &gt; of like the speedstacking association. I
        thought about trying it &gt; in &gt; &gt; the US first because it
        minimizes travel issues (compared with a &gt; &gt; worldwide group), and
        because I am already familiar with the laws &gt; &gt; regarding forming
        a non-profit organization here. And because I &gt; like &gt; &gt; the
        idea of having regional and national championships in addition &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; world championships--their easier to pull together! &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Of course, you know my opinion on all this ;-) I think neither
        &gt; Rubik's &gt; &gt; Champs nor Rubiks.com should be allowed to host
        our community forum &gt; &gt; because then there would be commercial
        interests involved (in the &gt; &gt; Rubik's cube specifically). They
        may be direct or indirect &gt; influences &gt; &gt; (in the case of
        rubiks.com via rubikschamps). I think it would be &gt; &gt; unfair &gt;
        &gt; for any single "cube company" to get into such a powerful position.
        &gt; &gt; You &gt; &gt; have already seen the effects of this at the
        championships, which &gt; not &gt; &gt; everybody is entirely happy
        with. For example, in that instance, &gt; &gt; Rubiks.com is in a
        position to stamp out any other brands of cube &gt; for &gt; &gt; the
        competition. For a discussion forum, we are not so helpless &gt; that
        &gt; &gt; we &gt; &gt; must turn to the help of a company that clearly
        wants to stamp out &gt; &gt; other &gt; &gt; brands of cube (or turn to
        one that is easily influenced by such a &gt; &gt; company).

        There was a discussion about an official club a while back. Everyone was
        planning on organizing it, but it kind of died. Also, why just an
        American Cube Club? Why not a world one? Sure, that might be harder to
        work out, but we should leave others out just because they're European
        or wherever. And about the forum VS yahoo group: There's nothing wrong
        with this group. I just think that forums are, well, better. I don't
        know why. It's just my humble opinion. And when Dan said he didn't want
        a cube forum to be with a profited organization like Rubiks.com or
        Rubikschamps.com, I suddenly had an idea: Why not speedcubing.com?
        That's, about the best speedcubing site out there anyway, so it would

        our club. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As to cubes types etc....I am permitting
        Eastsheen cubes which are &gt; &gt; non rubiks. i have been the one
        fighting them to get what WE AS A &gt; &gt; CLUB WANT.... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; all they requested was good looking cubes and good stickers. i &gt;
        fought &gt; &gt; them tooth and nail on hundreds of issues surrounding
        their product &gt; &gt; and i won every battle.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        they wanted 1 color scheme...we did not...i voice opinion....we now &gt;
        &gt; have multiple schemes permitted......... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        way things are now IS JUST FINE to 85 plus percent of the &gt; people
        &gt; &gt; in this club....If we start something new it will only confuse
        the &gt; &gt; situation even more.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are not

        will be fighting a long hard battle if you start up a non-profit &gt;
        &gt; club........to many clubs will confuse everyone..... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; keep in mind folks that 21 years ago there were 19 of
        them &gt; competing &gt; &gt; in a best of 3 contest.... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 21 years later, i built a contest from 4 years of input from this
        &gt; &gt; club. what occure din 1982 WILL not happen at my
        event....There &gt; will &gt; &gt; always be those with issues.....But
        then again, maybe perhaps they &gt; &gt; can setup the next world

        fall into the latter category, but I think &gt; &gt; &gt; this is a case
        where it's a good thing, since it's filling a void &gt; &gt; &gt; that
        was not being addressed previously. Ideally though Rubiks &gt; &gt; Cube
        &gt; &gt; &gt; enthusiasts would form their own not-for-profit

        after the WC, about seeing if there was &gt; &gt; &gt; interest in the
        US in forming a non-profit organization that &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt;
        formalize competition standards, certify records, and organize &gt; &gt;
        annual &gt; &gt; &gt; or biennial American championships on a regular
        basis--I guess &gt; kind &gt; &gt; &gt; of like the speedstacking
        association. I thought about trying it &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        US first because it minimizes travel issues (compared with a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; worldwide group), and because I am already familiar with the laws
        &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding forming a non-profit organization here. And
        because I &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; the idea of having regional and
        national championships in &gt; addition &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt;
        world championships--their easier to pull together! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Rubiks.com should be allowed to host our community &gt; forum &gt; &gt;
        &gt; because then there would be commercial interests involved (in the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubik's cube specifically). They may be direct or
        indirect &gt; &gt; influences &gt; &gt; &gt; (in the case of rubiks.com
        via rubikschamps). I think it would be &gt; &gt; &gt; unfair &gt; &gt;
        &gt; for any single "cube company" to get into such a powerful &gt;
        position. &gt; &gt; &gt; You &gt; &gt; &gt; have already seen the
        effects of this at the championships, which &gt; &gt; not &gt; &gt; &gt;
        everybody is entirely happy with. For example, in that instance, &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Rubiks.com is in a position to stamp out any other brands of
        cube &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; the competition. For a discussion
        forum, we are not so helpless &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; we &gt; &gt;
        &gt; must turn to the help of a company that clearly wants to stamp &gt;
        out &gt; &gt; &gt; other &gt; &gt; &gt; brands of cube (or turn to one
        that is easily influenced by such a &gt; &gt; &gt; company).

        One of the contestants in the original WC in 1982 popped a piece then
        put it back in and continued. I figure it would be permitted because

        American speedcubers decide to organize an &gt; American speedcubing
        club? You're from Canada! ;-) &gt; &gt; Seriously though... my primary
        interest is to develop a group that &gt; American speed cubers can join,
        that would promote speedcubing and &gt; organize national competitions
        where we could compete regularly in &gt; person. If someone is going to
        start that sort of club, you HAVE to &gt; incorporate (either as a
        non-profit or for-profit) or else the group &gt; won't actually exist...
        it would just be an informal association of &gt; individuals, which for
        a number of reasons doesn't always benefit the &gt; group or the
        members. I am envisioning an cube organization in the &gt; states to be
        a "membership organization" where anyone could join and &gt; have a say
        in the organization's activities. From what I understand, &gt; the RCC
        is (1) not a U.S. organization, (2) is not actually an &gt; officially
        (i.e. legally) organized entity (3) is not an open &gt; organization but
        rather a private group that restricts membership to &gt; a narrowly
        defined set of people. Look, like I said before, that's &gt; great...you
        all are organizing a spectacular event that I'm looking &gt; forward to
        attending. But I can tell you because I've been a member &gt; of several
        open membership clubs (such as the New York Road Runners &gt; Club,
        which puts on the New York Marathon) that it's a different type &gt; of
        thing. Let me reiterate... not better, just different. Perhaps &gt;
        you're right that 85% of people on this group aren't interested in a
        &gt; US speedcubing club. That's probably because 85% of the people on
        &gt; this group aren't from the US! &gt; &gt; Finally, remember America
        is a big spread-out country with a large &gt; percentage of speedcubers.
        It's harder for us to connect with each &gt; other and a club like this
        could help. &gt; &gt; Anyway, I brought this up in response to another
        post. My intent was &gt; to wait to propose this to the Americans in
        this group until after &gt; the WC, because I thought it would be useful
        for us all to meet each &gt; other in person first. I plan to table this
        until next month. &gt; &gt; "8 days left..." Holy cow! It sure has crept
        up on us fast. Talk &gt; to you (in person) soon. &gt; &gt; By the way,

        course, you know my opinion on all this ;-) I think neither &gt; &gt;
        Rubik's &gt; &gt; &gt; Champs nor Rubiks.com should be allowed to host
        our community &gt; forum &gt; &gt; &gt; because then there would be
        commercial interests involved (in the &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubik's cube
        specifically). They may be direct or indirect &gt; &gt; influences &gt;
        &gt; &gt; (in the case of rubiks.com via rubikschamps). I think it would
        be &gt; &gt; &gt; unfair &gt; &gt; &gt; for any single "cube company" to
        get into such a powerful &gt; position. &gt; &gt; &gt; You &gt; &gt;
        &gt; have already seen the effects of this at the championships, which
        &gt; &gt; not &gt; &gt; &gt; everybody is entirely happy with. For
        example, in that instance, &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubiks.com is in a position to
        stamp out any other brands of cube &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        competition. For a discussion forum, we are not so helpless &gt; &gt;
        that &gt; &gt; &gt; we &gt; &gt; &gt; must turn to the help of a company
        that clearly wants to stamp &gt; out &gt; &gt; &gt; other &gt; &gt; &gt;

        speedcubing club? You're from Canada! ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seriously
        though... my primary interest is to develop a group that &gt; &gt;
        American speed cubers can join, that would promote speedcubing and &gt;
        &gt; organize national competitions where we could compete regularly in
        &gt; &gt; person. If someone is going to start that sort of club, you
        HAVE &gt; to &gt; &gt; incorporate (either as a non-profit or
        for-profit) or else the &gt; group &gt; &gt; won't actually exist... it
        would just be an informal association &gt; of &gt; &gt; individuals,
        which for a number of reasons doesn't always benefit &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        group or the members. I am envisioning an cube organization in &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; states to be a "membership organization" where anyone could
        join &gt; and &gt; &gt; have a say in the organization's activities.
        From what I &gt; understand, &gt; &gt; the RCC is (1) not a U.S.
        organization, (2) is not actually an &gt; &gt; officially (i.e. legally)
        organized entity (3) is not an open &gt; &gt; organization but rather a
        private group that restricts membership &gt; to &gt; &gt; a narrowly
        defined set of people. Look, like I said before, &gt; that's &gt; &gt;
        great...you all are organizing a spectacular event that I'm &gt; looking
        &gt; &gt; forward to attending. But I can tell you because I've been a
        &gt; member &gt; &gt; of several open membership clubs (such as the New
        York Road &gt; Runners &gt; &gt; Club, which puts on the New York
        Marathon) that it's a different &gt; type &gt; &gt; of thing. Let me
        reiterate... not better, just different. &gt; Perhaps &gt; &gt; you're
        right that 85% of people on this group aren't interested in &gt; a &gt;
        &gt; US speedcubing club. That's probably because 85% of the people on
        &gt; &gt; this group aren't from the US! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally,
        remember America is a big spread-out country with a large &gt; &gt;
        percentage of speedcubers. It's harder for us to connect with &gt; each
        &gt; &gt; other and a club like this could help. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Anyway, I brought this up in response to another post. My intent &gt;
        was &gt; &gt; to wait to propose this to the Americans in this group
        until after &gt; &gt; the WC, because I thought it would be useful for
        us all to meet &gt; each &gt; &gt; other in person first. I plan to
        table this until next month. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "8 days left..." Holy
        cow! It sure has crept up on us fast. &gt; Talk &gt; &gt; to you (in
        person) soon. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, heard you all may have
        been part of the blackout. &gt; Hope &gt; &gt; you didn't lose power for

        I think Ryan makes a good point. There's a big difference &gt; &gt;
        between &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (a) aving a corporate sponsor for a
        not-for-profit group, &gt; event, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forum, whatever
        (where the organizers decide to bring on the &gt; &gt; &gt; sponsor &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; and negotiate a sponsorship relationship), and (b)
        putting a &gt; &gt; &gt; company &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a position where
        they ARE the organizing group, and can &gt; shape &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group, event, forum, whatever to fit their corporate
        interest. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I realize that the
        current WC, and the RCC that's referred &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; on &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the Rubikschamps site, fall into the latter category, but
        I &gt; think &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is a case where it's a good thing,
        since it's filling a &gt; void &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that was not being
        addressed previously. Ideally though &gt; Rubiks &gt; &gt; &gt; Cube
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enthusiasts would form their own not-for-profit &gt;
        group/committee &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manage the sponsor
        relationships. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was actually
        thinking, after the WC, about seeing if there &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; interest in the US in forming a non-profit organization that &gt;
        &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formalize competition standards, certify
        records, and organize &gt; &gt; &gt; annual &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or
        biennial American championships on a regular basis--I guess &gt; &gt;
        kind &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of like the speedstacking association. I

        are nowhere near our 512Kb limit), a separate thread for off topic
        discussions (one for cube art also), more control over the look and
        feel, more compatible and flexible chatter, no more of Yahoo's
        irritating limited file and photo space, those ads are very annoying
        also, and private messaging (to the degree of practically having another
        e-mail inbox). So in this respect, I agree with Adam, that a (true)fourm
        would be better - stable, efficent, uncluttered by ads, etc.. But do we
        really need all that now? I think not, but a Yahoo! group was a good
        step in the right direction (from MIT, Cube Lovers for instance).
        Eventually we 'will' need something better (PHP, assuming we all want
        cubing to gain in popularity) and I know of several member that have
        large server space (heck I have 50Megs), a great domain address, and
        more importantly the programming skills to put it all together. I guess
        I spend a lot of time in various fourms - many with over 2000 members,
        over 60000 posts - being the geek I am. Also, I think we should of had
        more serious discourse about James's fourm question instead of quickly
        disregarding it, and to Ryan, of course it has to be not controlled or
        affiliated with some major toy company :). Just wanted to make sure we'd
        be ready for changes when and if they will be needed in the future. (I
        couldn't do much to initiate it, but I'd put in the time to maintain
        it.) Ahhhhhhhhhh..... just a week left!!!!! Good luck to Jon and Brent
        on their upcomming media engagements, I've been trying the Detriot Free
        Press and local tv stations will no luck, well it's too soon to see
        (either way it'll probably happen after wc for me; hemm, if I fail
        miserably, any possible interviews would be canceled so I better at
        least keep all my times under 30s....). -Doug Li --- In

        &gt; &gt; Several times when someone who hasn't been registered for the
        WC &gt; &gt; has &gt; &gt; &gt; asked you a question about it, you've
        responded with something &gt; to &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; effect of
        "you're not even registered so what does it matter to &gt; &gt; &gt;
        you." In fact, you said that to me once before I was &gt; registered.
        &gt; &gt; So &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it's fair to turn that comment back
        around on you and &gt; ask &gt; &gt; why &gt; &gt; &gt; you care about
        whether American speedcubers decide to organize &gt; an &gt; &gt; &gt;
        American speedcubing club? You're from Canada! ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Seriously though... my primary interest is to develop a group
        &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; American speed cubers can join, that would
        promote speedcubing &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; organize national
        competitions where we could compete regularly &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt;
        person. If someone is going to start that sort of club, you &gt; HAVE
        &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; incorporate (either as a non-profit or
        for-profit) or else the &gt; &gt; group &gt; &gt; &gt; won't actually
        exist... it would just be an informal association &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt;
        &gt; individuals, which for a number of reasons doesn't always &gt;
        benefit &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; group or the members. I am
        envisioning an cube organization in &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; states
        to be a "membership organization" where anyone could join &gt; &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; have a say in the organization's activities. From what I
        &gt; &gt; understand, &gt; &gt; &gt; the RCC is (1) not a U.S.
        organization, (2) is not actually an &gt; &gt; &gt; officially (i.e.
        legally) organized entity (3) is not an open &gt; &gt; &gt; organization
        but rather a private group that restricts &gt; membership &gt; &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; &gt; a narrowly defined set of people. Look, like I said
        before, &gt; &gt; that's &gt; &gt; &gt; great...you all are organizing a
        spectacular event that I'm &gt; &gt; looking &gt; &gt; &gt; forward to
        attending. But I can tell you because I've been a &gt; &gt; member &gt;
        &gt; &gt; of several open membership clubs (such as the New York Road
        &gt; &gt; Runners &gt; &gt; &gt; Club, which puts on the New York
        Marathon) that it's a different &gt; &gt; type &gt; &gt; &gt; of thing.
        Let me reiterate... not better, just different. &gt; &gt; Perhaps &gt;
        &gt; &gt; you're right that 85% of people on this group aren't
        interested &gt; in &gt; &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; US speedcubing club.
        That's probably because 85% of the people &gt; on &gt; &gt; &gt; this
        group aren't from the US! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally,
        remember America is a big spread-out country with a &gt; large &gt; &gt;
        &gt; percentage of speedcubers. It's harder for us to connect with &gt;
        &gt; each &gt; &gt; &gt; other and a club like this could help. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I brought this up in response to
        another post. My &gt; intent &gt; &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt; to wait to
        propose this to the Americans in this group until &gt; after &gt; &gt;
        &gt; the WC, because I thought it would be useful for us all to meet
        &gt; &gt; each &gt; &gt; &gt; other in person first. I plan to table
        this until next month. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "8 days left..."
        Holy cow! It sure has crept up on us fast. &gt; &gt; Talk &gt; &gt; &gt;
        to you (in person) soon. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, heard
        you all may have been part of the blackout. &gt; &gt; Hope &gt; &gt;
        &gt; you didn't lose power for too long. &gt; &gt; &gt; Best, &gt; &gt;

        &gt; I think Ryan makes a good point. There's a big difference &gt; &gt;
        &gt; between &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (a) aving a corporate sponsor for
        a not-for-profit group, &gt; &gt; event, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forum,
        whatever (where the organizers decide to bring on the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; sponsor &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and negotiate a sponsorship
        relationship), and (b) putting a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; company &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; in a position where they ARE the organizing group, and
        can &gt; &gt; shape &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        group, event, forum, whatever to fit their corporate &gt; interest. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I realize that the
        current WC, and the RCC that's &gt; referred &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Rubikschamps site, fall into the
        latter category, but I &gt; &gt; think &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is
        a case where it's a good thing, since it's filling a &gt; &gt; void &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that was not being addressed previously. Ideally
        though &gt; &gt; Rubiks &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; enthusiasts would form their own not-for-profit &gt; &gt;
        group/committee &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manage the
        sponsor relationships. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I was actually thinking, after the WC, about seeing if there &gt; &gt;
        was &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interest in the US in forming a non-profit
        organization that &gt; &gt; &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        formalize competition standards, certify records, and &gt; organize &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; annual &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or biennial American
        championships on a regular basis--I &gt; guess &gt; &gt; &gt; kind &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of like the speedstacking association. I thought
        about &gt; trying &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; the US first because it minimizes travel issues (compared &gt;
        with &gt; &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worldwide group), and because
        I am already familiar with the &gt; &gt; laws &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        regarding forming a non-profit organization here. And &gt; because &gt;
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the idea of
        having regional and national championships in &gt; &gt; &gt; addition
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world
        championships--their easier to pull together! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Of course, you know my opinion on all this ;-) I think &gt;
        neither &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubik's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Champs nor
        Rubiks.com should be allowed to host our &gt; community &gt; &gt; &gt;
        forum &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because then there would be commercial
        interests involved &gt; (in &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Rubik's cube specifically). They may be direct or indirect &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; influences &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (in the case of rubiks.com
        via rubikschamps). I think it &gt; would &gt; &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; unfair &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for any single "cube company"
        to get into such a powerful &gt; &gt; &gt; position. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; You &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have already seen the effects of this
        at the championships, &gt; &gt; which &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; everybody is entirely happy with. For example, in that
        &gt; &gt; instance, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubiks.com is in a position
        to stamp out any other brands of &gt; &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the competition. For a discussion forum, we are
        not so &gt; &gt; helpless &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; we &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; must turn to the help of a company that
        clearly wants to &gt; stamp &gt; &gt; &gt; out &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        other &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brands of cube (or turn to one that is
        easily influenced by &gt; &gt; such a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; company).

        Thanks, Dan, for allowing non-Rubiks cubes! Does this also mean we can
        use cutting sheets with different colors from the official coloring as
        stickers, as long as the they look nice? I don't use cutting sheets, but

        There's a big difference between &gt; &gt; (a) aving a corporate sponsor
        for a not-for-profit group, event, &gt; &gt; forum, whatever (where the
        organizers decide to bring on the &gt; sponsor &gt; &gt; and negotiate a
        sponsorship relationship), and (b) putting a &gt; company &gt; &gt; in a
        position where they ARE the organizing group, and can shape &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; group, event, forum, whatever to fit their corporate interest.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I realize that the current WC, and the RCC
        that's referred to &gt; on &gt; &gt; the Rubikschamps site, fall into
        the latter category, but I think &gt; &gt; this is a case where it's a
        good thing, since it's filling a void &gt; &gt; that was not being
        addressed previously. Ideally though Rubiks &gt; Cube &gt; &gt;
        enthusiasts would form their own not-for-profit group/committee and &gt;
        &gt; manage the sponsor relationships. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was
        actually thinking, after the WC, about seeing if there was &gt; &gt;
        interest in the US in forming a non-profit organization that would &gt;
        &gt; formalize competition standards, certify records, and organize &gt;
        annual &gt; &gt; or biennial American championships on a regular
        basis--I guess kind &gt; &gt; of like the speedstacking association. I
        thought about trying it &gt; in &gt; &gt; the US first because it
        minimizes travel issues (compared with a &gt; &gt; worldwide group), and
        because I am already familiar with the laws &gt; &gt; regarding forming
        a non-profit organization here. And because I &gt; like &gt; &gt; the
        idea of having regional and national championships in addition &gt; to

        &gt; &gt; Of course, you know my opinion on all this ;-) I think neither
        &gt; Rubik's &gt; &gt; Champs nor Rubiks.com should be allowed to host
        our community forum &gt; &gt; because then there would be commercial
        interests involved (in the &gt; &gt; Rubik's cube specifically). They
        may be direct or indirect &gt; influences &gt; &gt; (in the case of
        rubiks.com via rubikschamps). I think it would be &gt; &gt; unfair &gt;
        &gt; for any single "cube company" to get into such a powerful position.
        &gt; &gt; You &gt; &gt; have already seen the effects of this at the
        championships, which &gt; not &gt; &gt; everybody is entirely happy
        with. For example, in that instance, &gt; &gt; Rubiks.com is in a
        position to stamp out any other brands of cube &gt; for &gt; &gt; the
        competition. For a discussion forum, we are not so helpless &gt; that
        &gt; &gt; we &gt; &gt; must turn to the help of a company that clearly
        wants to stamp out &gt; &gt; other &gt; &gt; brands of cube (or turn to
        one that is easily influenced by such a &gt; &gt; company).

        &gt; to &gt; &gt; think quickly for each one, and the controls aren't
        what you would &gt; &gt; expect. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess it relates
        to thinking quickly while solving the F2L :) &gt; &gt; Anyway it's fun,

        Doug, Someone else started the thread about forums. My interest was in a
        Rubik's club that would be regional enough NOT to be Internet-based, not
        just a better Internet-based thing. Personally I like the Yahoo group,
        but I don't know all the possible features we could have with a better
        forum. On thing I don't like about this group... if you set the feature
        to hide your email address in the Members list, you can't post by email
        anymore. You have to use the web form. Adam Date: Sun, 17 Aug 2003

        True, but I think what Adam (or whoever started this thread, oh ya
        Potter) is refering to is something much more sophisticated. Yahoo!
        groups are basically a monotonus list of posts, whereas I've seen
        "better" fourms (true fourms, as I like to think of it). For example,
        www.invisionboard.com/ offers a neat looking fourm. Nice features
        include, the avaliblity of editing your own posts after they have been
        posted (take care of sp errors b4 others nag about it),
        multiple/organized threads, user ratings (cubing exp/number of
        posts/cube ave), user icons/avatars, advanced search options (we know
        have over 6000 posts, many useless ones I'd like to eliminate, but we
        are nowhere near our 512Kb limit), a separate thread for off topic
        discussions (one for cube art also), more control over the look and
        feel, more compatible and flexible chatter, no more of Yahoo's
        irritating limited file and photo space, those ads are very annoying
        also, and private messaging (to the degree of practically having another
        e-mail inbox).

        Thanks Dan for that usefull piece of information. However, I noticed
        that the Square-1 event is not listed in this schedule. And the pyraminx
        wasn't planned as an event, but it's in the schedule. Can you explain

        Dan, In post 5577 you discussed the following: "Day 1 is meet and great
        day...you show up ,register,meet and greet and when your good and ready
        you step up to the podiums and give me your best average... This day 1
        averaging is for seeding and means nothing..Day 1 is designed for all of

        I've been computer-solving a bunch of different positions lately,
        including counting the number of minimal-length solutions to some
        positions. Typically a position will have a handful of minimal-length
        solutions, at best. Looking at some symmetrical positions, I've found
        some positions that have hundreds of solutions, including three that
        have 800-odd minimal length solutions. (I am not counting things like
        R2L2 and L2R2 as distinct solutions, but I am counting reflections and
        rotations as distinct solutions, for those patterns that are
        symmetrical.) Well, so this morning I log on and browse some of the
        numbers. I've found one position that has 28,544 minimal (length 17)
        solutions! The runner-up position (that I've examined so far) has only
        1,416 solutions. Each of 8 different first moves from this new position
        gives a new position that beats the old runner up! The position is:
        U+F+B+D2R2D2R2F-B-R2D2R2U+F2B2R2L2

        Hi Everybody, I've been cubing for a few months now and I can't seem to
        beat the 1:05 barrier. I've even created some of my own algorythms which
        cut off about 20 seconds. I'm using the basic three-layer technique and
        my hands are flying just to solve it in 65 seconds. So I know I gotta
        switch to the more elaborate F2L methods. What would be a logical first
        algorythm or first "few" algorythms to memorize as I step into this new
        technique. Thanks John Dreese

        W.H.O.A.! Looks like you're in quite a rush... Sorry I don't know anyone
        from Colorado (that can solve the cube), but you can find rather easy
        ways on the net in some places... it can only take a day if your
        determined enough to solve it. i have a beginner's solution on my site,
        but again, you said you don't want an applet program, but just _in_case_
        your in the worst case scenario, go to my site (
        www.freewebs.com/brentsuniverse ) and go to my speedcubing section. it's

        What would be a logical first algorythm or first "few" algorythms &gt;
        to memorize as I step into this new technique. Try counting how many
        moves it takes to solve the cube. Keep in mind that an efficient (speed)
        solution can solve the cube in an average of under 60 moves. That said,
        I think a reasonable starting recommendation would be to learn a four
        look LL: Orient corners (7 algs) Orient edges (3 algs) Permute
        (position) corners (2-3 algs) Permute edges (4 algs) This is only 17
        algs, and is a good first step toward a good LL. If this seems like too
        big of a step, then you can always cut that back a little by learning
        only some of the algs from each set, and applying 2 algs as necessary.
        For example, all 7 corner orientation cases can be solved in one or two
        steps with just 2 algs that rotate just 3 corners. You can then use this
        to work into a 4 look LL. Either way, algs can be found on countless
        websites... I'd start with http://www.SpeedCubing.com , and go to the
        links page there, if you find the algs there don't work for you (or just
        to see different options). Once you have a 4 look LL, I would recommend
        working on getting a solid F2L... Again, algs are everywhere!

        we were all (and some are still, respectively) at the point of 1
        minute... I highly recommend the site of _Jessica Fridrich_... I'm not
        saying it will be the best for _you_, but it is for me. I really can't
        even start the _Lars Petrus_ way at all (well, maybe..) but stil,
        everyone will have different thoughts, but mine: Fridrich. (use search
        engine to find link). With the Fridrich system, my fastest f2l is
        probably 8 secs (and still people have gone faster). Brent budlyxy

        months now and I can't seem to beat the 1:05 barrier. I've even created
        some of my own algorythms which cut off about 20 seconds. I'm using the
        basic three-layer technique and my hands are flying just to solve it in
        65 seconds. So I know I gotta switch to the more elaborate F2L methods.
        What would be a logical first algorythm or first "few" algorythms to
        memorize as I step into this new technique. Thanks John Dreese Yahoo!

        those living far away (e.g. Australia, not Canada), they can't leave for
        the event after class on Friday, participate, and then arrive back home
        in time for class on Monday morning. Besides, many people are taking the
        opportunity to get together for a while before the event actually begins
        (or would like to, but can't because of class). I live in Illinois, USA
        (just 10 hours' drive away), and I'm still taking 2 days off work for
        the event, just to allow time to travel there and back. - Grant

        please come and see me as all reporters are to have there interviews
        prearranged via our PR company to avoid the constant disruption of your
        mental processes while your practising.... i have even set rules to how
        they can film the event to avoid you all getting freaked out by the
        camera's.. to date i have received over 25 emails from competitors
        requesting status on interviews and if they can be "alone and isolated"
        for the entire event. Some enjoy the spotlight , some dont... Either
        way, I can guarantee anyone whom does not want a camera shoved in their
        face, that it will not happen at this event..... Just see me upon

        Very good idea. I think other's have tried though, I saw one one Lars
        site and Olly's site for instance. Heck, I've even tried a bit. But I
        realized that there are going to be some major disputes on terminology.
        So it would be great if we could adopt what a majority of us decide on.
        And as long as everything is mathematically correct, I'll be happy. This
        should however prove to be easier to get a consensus on then Notation at
        least. (I found out that I've been incorrectly using "M" notation,
        grr... Olly does this also it seems.) Be sure to clear up confusions and
        myths, like the difference between layer and face as a basic one. And
        list multiple definitions for simple words like "twist" which can be
        used in multiple ways... This would probably be best host on a
        well-established site however. -Doug (...still packing, heading over to

        bring her to Toronto because of her school schedule.) There just wasn't
        any leeway to be in Toronto for a longer period of time. However I know
        from organizing a 2,000-person footrace here in Virginia there's no way
        to get a perfect weekend. Usually for organizers it comes down to there
        being one weekend when you CAN have the event, rather than being able to
        pick from a number of dates. Anyway, I've heard about various
        get-togethers Thursday and Friday night. I hope there's something going
        on Saturday evening as well for those of us getting in late. Adam --- In

        Hey, never meant to imply that I think the way the WC was set up was
        wrong. Just wanted to express my increased desire to go in light of new
        facts I dug up. You've done a lot of work DanG and we all appreciate it!
        It is mostly the travel requiremnts on the preceding Friday that causes
        me problems in attending, as we don't have classes on weekends here
        either, but we don't have flights that way late enough after class on
        friday or early enough on saturday either. And if there IS going to be
        another competition in the future, I'll definately make arrangements to
        attend. And I do want stories and videos (is there an official video
        being made? I'll buy that!). Cheers! Daniel Hayes

        only thing worrying me is the power...if power goes out then we have to

        thing about this whole venture which made everything worth all the

        would just be pretty cool if there was another cubist on the plane.

        When solving (3x3 in my case) for the Championships how will this take
        place? On Day 1 of the competition, will we be solving on a stage, with
        a group of people? alone? in a solo room? I can't find anywhere that
        answers this. Also, will I be standing like in the Budapest
        championships, or sitting in a chair? On day 1 will I just solve the
        cube once, to advance to day 2's competition, or 3 solve average, 10?
        One more question, what are the rules regarding pops? Often, my cube
        will pop, but the piece will not fly out, just stay in and I just push
        it back in while solving. Is this legal here. The thing that scares me
        most is that sometime I'll be solving, and I'll hit a corner, and it
        will rotate. At the end, then I have to rotate it back. Is this legal?
        Because how would people know that I'm not cheating? sorry for all the
        questions, I couldn't find any answers, and would certainly like to know
        so that I can prepare myself. thanks. ferret

        I was wondering something else: Going to the competition, I'm &gt;
        flying from Seattle to Chicago to Toronto. Is anyone else here &gt;
        taking that route? It would just be pretty cool if there was another

        my first thought was to say "see you in 2 days" but.... On Day 1 of the
        competition, will we be solving on a stage, with a group of people?
        alone? in a solo room? I can't find anywhere that answers this. danG- as
        in all competitions....yes...their is a stage,a group of people in an
        2900 square foot room on day 1.. whats nice about this is the design of
        the podiums...there will be 5 and all 5 will be active through the
        entire day.. at each podium(you will be standing unless you have a
        medical reason) there will be 2 judges/officials. 1 to scramble the cube
        and 1 to man the stopwatch..... sequence will be explain when you
        arrive.... On day 1 will I just solve the cube once, to advance to day
        2's competition, or 3 solve average, 10? danG-there have been changed
        made due to time constraints....the first round will be an average of
        10.....total number of competitors registered will determine how many
        move forward into the next round. the rounds are...average of 10,7,5,3
        One more question, what are the rules regarding pops? danG-we have been
        down this road many times.... Often, my cube will pop, but the piece
        will not fly out, just stay in and I just push it back in while solving.
        danG-your choice....you get 1 pop per round.....if you popp it twice
        then you are permitted to use that popp as your slowest time(which in
        turn will be discarded). ***however****.....we will be watching for
        "forced" popps.....be cautious and prepared The thing that scares me
        most is that sometime I'll be solving, and I'll hit a corner, and it
        will rotate. At the end, then I have to rotate it back. Is this legal?
        danG-treated as a pop...same rules apply. plus this is something that
        doesnt happen a whole lot.. Because how would people know that &gt; I'm
        not cheating? danG-i want to see you solve it with it turned sorry for
        all the questions, I couldn't find any answers, and would &gt; certainly
        like to know so that I can prepare myself. danG-you owe me a 20 for my
        time....!!! kidding... see you in a few days...good luck! danG

        Hi Macky, Who ever told you there was an agreed upon notation? I know of
        several in use. I use: First off there are three basic turns. For
        example: R = Right layer clockwise R2 = Right layer 180 degrees R' =
        Right layer counterclockwise Then there are six sides: R = Right layer
        clockwise U = Top layer clockwise B = Back layer clockwise L = Left
        layer clockwise F = Front layer clockwise D = Lowest layer clockwise
        Then there are the middle layers or slices: r = center slice next to R u
        = center slice under U b = center slice in front of B l = center slice
        next to L d = center slice over D f = center slice in back of F And
        finally rotating the whole cube in your hand (used for "finger tricks")
        (Q stands for cube) QR = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the right
        QU = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the top QB = Rotate the whole
        cube clockwise from the back The reasons I prefer this notation are: 1.
        the consistant lettering means not having to figure out which is the x,y
        or z axis or the M S E slices etc. The slice are the same letter as
        either side adjacent. 2. There are provisions for rotating the cube. 3.
        This can be applied to the 4x4x4 with no changes. David J --- In

        &gt; &gt; danG- as in all competitions....yes...their is a stage,a group
        of &gt; people in an 2900 square foot room on day 1.. &gt; &gt; whats
        nice about this is the design of the podiums...there will be 5 &gt; and
        all 5 will be active through the entire day.. &gt; &gt; at each
        podium(you will be standing unless you have a medical &gt; reason) there
        will be 2 judges/officials. 1 to scramble the cube and &gt; 1 to man the
        stopwatch..... &gt; &gt; sequence will be explain when you arrive....
        &gt; &gt; On day 1 will I just solve the cube once, to advance to day
        2's &gt; competition, or 3 solve average, 10? &gt; &gt; &gt; danG-there
        have been changed made due to time constraints....the &gt; first round
        will be an average of 10.....total number of competitors &gt; registered
        will determine how many move forward into the next round. &gt; the
        rounds are...average of 10,7,5,3 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more question,
        what are the rules regarding pops? &gt; &gt; danG-we have been down this
        road many times.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Often, my cube will pop, but the
        piece will not fly out, just stay &gt; in &gt; and I just push it back
        in while solving. &gt; &gt; danG-your choice....you get 1 pop per
        round.....if you popp it twice &gt; then you are permitted to use that
        popp as your slowest time(which &gt; in turn will be discarded).
        ***however****.....we will be watching &gt; for "forced" popps.....be
        cautious and prepared &gt; &gt; The thing that scares me most is that
        sometime I'll be solving, and &gt; I'll hit a corner, and it will
        rotate. At the end, then I have to &gt; rotate it back. Is this legal?
        &gt; &gt; danG-treated as a pop...same rules apply. plus this is
        something &gt; that doesnt happen a whole lot.. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Because how would people know that &gt; &gt; I'm not cheating? &gt; &gt;
        danG-i want to see you solve it with it turned &gt; &gt; &gt; sorry for
        all the questions, I couldn't find any answers, and would &gt; &gt;
        certainly like to know so that I can prepare myself. &gt; &gt; danG-you
        owe me a 20 for my time....!!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kidding... &gt; &gt;
        &gt; see you in a few days...good luck! &gt; &gt; &gt; danG &gt; &gt;

        Wondering if anyone knows a place to find an applet to help me solve the
        3rd/ bottom layer on my Rubiks cube I'm still stuck on getting the
        cubits where I need them to finish it. Anyone able to help with this

        OK, I'll arrive in Toronto around 4pm on Thursday, and I'll be staying

        performance. But I'm just going for fun anyway. I haven't kept track of

        Thanks for the advice on Fridrichs method. I'm wondering, which method
        is faster: layer-by-layer (F2L) methods or the one where you solve a
        quarter of the cube first. I currently solve using a brute-force
        layer-by-layer method in about 65 seconds. I've been able to memorize
        one algorythm from Ms. Fridrichs website and I'm working on more, but I
        don't want to learn a method that is ultimately the slowest. Any
        suggestions?

        definitely learn the fridrich method. its really the opinion of the
        cuber that makes something faster or slower. if you are scared to learn
        the 80+ algorithms of fridrichs method, you might want to try the 4-look
        LL from www.twistymegasite.com. im currently using this and its pretty
        good. course, lots of practice will need to go into it. it'll definitely
        decrease your time after you get used to it. but dont learn a method
        just because its not fast. learn for the experience of learning

        Well gang it was one hectic day.. started by someone stealing a timer
        pad and 300 plus cubes along with 24 rolls of stickers.. with that said
        and the fact the the 5x5x5 category took so long to complete the 3x3x3
        format had to be changed. Also requiring changing was the non category
        challenges. Day 1 originally was to have those categories demonstrated
        and then once again on day 2 for the public.. Changes to be made due to
        time contraints are: all non category challenges are now only a part of
        the finale. the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 categories were cut to best of 3 average
        and the finalists are now set to compete tommorrow(top 3 versus rounds).
        Finals will be best time out of 3. now for the 3x3x3 event. we had to
        run late at the venue(which by the way costs us a heck of alot of money)
        and were only able to get through 51 competitors. There are 32
        competitors left to trial in the 3x3x3 event. Only the first 32 will be
        in the finals versus original rounds of 10,7,5,3. The high cubic puzzles
        killed us and since we lost our 5th timer due to theft we were hours
        behind once the day was finished. Only 2 complaints were received from
        competitors. All others had the most excellent time. Our own Jessica
        Fridrich even went up and gave us a best of 3 which was a complishment
        for myself to acheive her doing it versus standing on the side lines...
        All eye were on Jessica and everyone gathered around to watch our icon
        perform. We were all in AWE!!! when Jessica did her thing. Dan Knights
        had the best time of the day in the 3x3x3 event with a time of 16.71
        seconds(something like that-left data sheet at the
        venue)...(note.....dan must think Canada has nothing but snow as he
        showed up wearing what looked to be a Parka jacket...was a good laugh
        when speaking with him however.... He is a good guy! - was nice meeting
        him after all these years...) only 6 people were able to break the 20
        second barrier. Mr. Rubik must have designed some heavy kick ass
        scrambles or the guys were a bit nervous... Only 1 person was able to
        solve the cube blindfolded and only in the 3x3x3 category..I forget the
        guys name...(will report his name tommorrow). This was a disappointment
        to me as we had 30 people in those events. Tommorrow we get to see Jess
        Bonde do his thing along with Ron van Bruchem and David Wesley. Next
        time I will bring the data sheet home to provide the numbers for
        everyone.... ps-I had to scramble over 500 cubes today. wife is writing
        this email as i have no hands left.. all for now oh ps-we have a sort of
        a FMC and of course Mirek came back with 27 moves.....good for first
        place thus far...round 2 of that event goes tommorrow...Good work
        Mirek!! danG

        While it's morally unthinkable that somebody would steal a timer-pad,
        it's really great to see that you could triumph over this setback and go
        on with the show. Thanks for all your hard work on organizing the event
        and battling the obstacles. Can't wait to hear tomorrows results! John

        reporters from Toronto ;););) The 8 fastest of the list above will
        compete in the next round(s) Again, the times written above are the best
        of three solves. As you can see, and as Ron guessed, some "unknown" guys
        achieve really good times, with "unknown" solving method(s) (corners
        first (?)). New world record is 16.50. we can congratulate
        www.rubikschamps.com for the great stuff they do not do.

        It looks like Allen didn't really perfom 16.50 seconds (video analizis),
        Jess Bonde would have the World record : 16.53 seconds. Congratulations
        to all of those who had the courage to compete, with a lot of

        Hello everybody, Ya it's kinda late, but there's nothing more to be done
        tomorrow (eh, perhaps visit OSC again since none of us really had a good
        opportunity to check the place out, btw it's 4-5 floors deep for those
        of you who havn't checked it out, a bit of a vertical maze perhaps). So
        I was just catching up on the ton of posts, so for all of you who didn't
        attend and have been requesting pictures/clips they will be up pretty
        fast (the two documentaries might take a while longer, appearently it
        takes up to a yr to cut/edit). I think Ron has a good supply of pictures
        up already. I just thought it'd be nice to have a competitor here give a
        bit of an update since it seems almost all of us don't have
        time/internet connection to get through. So about 1/3 of us didn't get
        to go yesterday (the Saturday), I was on of the last few in line. (Oh ya
        the pressure was on!) So just to give you folks an idea of the
        atmosphere here... Everybody seemed very nice. It was great to be able
        to put the faces behind the names. And it was very exciting to meet all
        these great people, to cube with them. Learned a few new tricks..., like
        how to solve the Magic fast (thanks Jaap), do the 5x5x5 under 30min
        (lol, thanks Akimoto), actaully get a 5x5x5 (thanks to Hasbro/Seven
        Towns Ltd.), see all these other great puzzles (pariminx, skewb,
        astrolabacus, Chris's nifty cube 2 triangles for each of the 6 square
        faces for center piece solving, seeing DanK want to prove that it is
        impossible to flip a single center only, it is not!, of course Grant's
        bloody bandaged cube that not even Ron could tackle, well Jake
        eventually got it, a PROPER 2x2x2, no more grabing Homer in the eyes for
        me, etc. can't think of much more now). So at the venue it was an
        exciting and friendly get-together. Well you know, we sort of over ran
        the entire hotel, couldn't walk out without hearing the clicking noises
        and eventually this became the background sound every where, one guy
        compared it to the chirping of crickets... And of course strange
        relationship with the front desk people, I had to do a cold solve after
        7 hrs of driving for them, 23 something I recall. Typical, Ton had to
        cube in front of Customs. Turning in left over items (cubes, cube bags,
        etc. to the front desk). "Did anyone ask about a missing cube?," soundly
        like I'm yanking their chain with so many cubes in the building. But ya
        I almost lost my bag and there would be like 5 identical in the lost and
        found to pick from (all competitors were given 1 cube bag (gotta be
        stylin', stand, silver cube, shirt, and pin). The pins given out were
        apperanetly of the wrong color scheme! (Proud that I was the first to
        notice, and don't use the normal scheme.) They got it correct on the
        bags though. To my displaeasure, none of the 5 podiums were solvable
        even after great efforts by the sponsors. Yep two green stickers on the
        same edge piece ain't gona fly under the radar with us folks around. I
        suppose the lost of one of the 5 timing devices cost us a great deal of
        time, and it probably would have been cheaper to have purchesed a 6th
        one for backup then to have to pay the hefty fees of using the OSC
        facilities prolonged. So I pretty much got to chat with everybody, which
        was great. Open up the morning news to see say Ron on the 3rd page
        (stupid media mis- caption...) and fall asleep watching Hardwick solve a
        cube on TV (MOD, Canada equivalent of MTV). Of course there were a bunch
        of others I didn't notice, I heard of radio interviews, uhh other papers
        and tv programs. I guess know I can speak much more intelligently about
        all the cube related things, esp. cubing styles and people's preferences
        of speedcubes. Of course the first day was incredibly crowded; the
        second, with cameras in your face all the time. I enjoyed talking about
        my cubing experience with the documentary folks, just hope they don't
        make me look like a jerk or something as Ron has suggested (media
        slander). Of course the gift shop selling cubes to OSC visitors ran out
        pretty quick. I got to see the Lego cube solver. No Erno or Singmaster,
        but meeting Fridrich, Ron, Petrus, Knights, and Chris did just fine. The
        people who placed recieved his autographed photo. (Yes I know I'm going
        into a bit too much detail, but not every cubist in our community went.)
        Appearently the signatures of all the cubists is better then gold on
        E-bay, everybody had to exchange sigantures. Some suspected I
        dismantaled a podium, but those won't be used in the future anyways, :).
        Having people sign my cube was a bit to cliche for my taste and signing
        the little 5x5x5s were awful, the T-shirt idea: much better(suggestion
        for WC2005). Personally, I felt the commentation was awfully
        insensitive, btw. The guy told us to shutup and that if we did he would,
        and every body starts clapping/cheering loudly, lol. So anyways, I had a
        decent performance. I came in with two goals one of which I missed by a
        hair: to get one sub-20 time and to keep all my times under 30. No
        terrible times for me, but no great ones either. Interesting how the
        final round times were all very bad (realativly speacking). That round
        was very tense as you can all imagine. I think having the audience quiet
        down was damaging to people's performance, a louder crowd mean's less
        people paying attention to what your doing and your not as nervous. For
        me I have always known I would/could become incredibly nervous in public
        situations, esp. public speaking, but no problems today! (I just looked
        straight down at the floor or the cube.) The simple aspect of believing
        I would be nervous, made me not nervous somehow. Good paliminaries for
        me; got a bit frustrated during all the solves of my second round
        however, I think I got unlucky scrambles for my method or my chosen
        path, but it is difficult to perform in a new environment. A great deal
        of commotion about the poor lighting, I gave some suggestions and got
        some light from top. People still complained, but I had no trouble with
        it, it was more of something to talk about to not get nervous perhaps.
        So ya getting through the qualifying round automatically puts one into
        the top 32 in world rankings. So that makes me happy. Ok, enough random
        thoughts, this fourm shouldn't be my diary, so catch you later... -Doug

        Speedstacking timing pads were the easiest solution for the
        championships. Already manufactured. But, I don't see why you have to
        put your hands at a special place at the end (on the pad, in your
        pockets...) in order to stop the watch. In speedstacking, of course, you
        don't have choice. But in speedcubing, the proper way of stopping the
        watch would be with a sensor under the cube. After all, the most
        important thing is: All times measured with the same device (so, I guess
        speedstacking pads are now the official tool :-( ). Ok, but I certainly
        won't spend $60 for a $1 stopwatch and a mat with "speed stacks" written
        on it! :-) Gilles.

        I also liked the StackMat timers from the first time I tried them. I
        don't think my times where suffering from it at all. Maybe they could
        make some slight adjustments so that the timer starts from the time the
        cube is picked up, and it stops when put down. But really, excellent
        timing device no matter what. Good choice. Lars --- In

        the cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, the most important thing is:
        All times measured with the &gt; &gt; same device (so, I guess

        Speeking of spreading the love and such, One thing I learned through
        this whole experience is how accessible this little phenomenon of ours
        is. At first glance I can see how speed cubing may be intimidating but
        fortunately it's also very engrossing, captivating, etc. I was impressed

        Agreed, I liked the speedstack timers. People were complaining it added
        almost 2s to one's time, but it was probably just an excuse for bad
        times, lol. A bit expensive for my taste I must say, but I might still
        buy one (not enough features however, can't compare to Bonde's for
        recording and dynamic average). The media and audience were what slowed
        us down, I believe, and having total silence in the final round threw
        some competitors off; could of helped some of course. So ya, Dror was
        some machine! Too bad for the 5x5, but the 4x4 is hard enough. Might of
        been easier to do 2 or 3 3x3's then a 5x5, but I guess it takes a lot of
        of ya. And btw folks, we don't NEED another WC to keep on cubing so I
        don't want to hear anymore nonsense about "what's next?". WC2005 is a
        possiblity especially due to the success of this one (ok, I might get a
        list os disagreements there, but there really wasn't enough organizers
        and one man, DanG, can only do so much), but let's not speculate and
        wait for some sort of comformation that probably won't come very soon -
        remember, this one was pushed back twice. You know it was great to see
        the faces behind the SNs. Too bad Harris couldn't go around taking head
        shots of everybody (for cubestation / profiles / galley), but not all of
        us want our pic on the net. Although, I use MES notation (be it wrong on
        the M'), I think now after reading some of these posts that that could
        be abolished for the more friendly/intuitive subscript notation (m,s,a)
        It's not all that computer friendly, but better - what do you all think?
        And could someone please forget the xyz stuff! Why fix an coordinate
        system if it has no other uses then for the rotations. 'Q' I don't like
        either but could live with. Since I'm all for consistancy, mayby 'q' in
        subscript AFTER the letter? And please don't start using "R[m]" to
        indicate subscript if you can't embed it in the HTML, just go for "Rm".
        (m,s,a) is from Mirek as far as I can trace back. I have always used
        something like [r'] for that sort of stuff, I got it from Ross I
        suppose. Just anything to not add new letters to the standard Singmaster
        Notation! Um, that's a good point about "r" for 3x3 vs. "r" for 4x4. It
        'should?' be pretty implicit, but just to avoid confusion something new
        like could be introduced, I was thinking "Rd" for deep but that is crap,
        right? (double meaning, conflict) Perhaps "Rp" for deeP since that
        letter is free. Ok that's just rambling.... So does anyone think there
        was anything unfair about the compition? I'd like to hear some opinions
        about this, couldn't really talk about it over the weekend right? Having
        to go to best of 3 for the first 2 rounds were an "interesting change."
        (It was planned to be like maybe average of 5 or whatever, so assuming
        there was a good reason for THAT, then there'd be a good reason for best
        of 3 being a bad idea.) Regardless of fairness or one's own performance
        I think it'd of been simply more fun to get to do more official times on
        the pads. (Well, I might have been thinking "Why am I here; just get
        this over with," lol, when in front of the huge crowd...) -Doug (just

        Uh, we definately need both meanings, so both "s" and "m" but they are
        of course equivalent to each other after some whole cube rotation. There
        is just a subtle distinction. And yes I immediately noticed where the
        notation stemed from like I mentioned: Mirek, or maybe Jessica. I guess
        I just had a feealing it was from Mirek... I don't CARE what certain

        Being the math geek I am, I took the time to do a more complicated stats
        sheet for the 32 qualifiers of the 3x3 category. This is not to single
        anyone out, well besides those 32. I just used a simple highlighting
        rule: green if placed 1,2,3 in one of the rankings and blue for the
        remainder if in top 10 in any one of the rankings (hope you see what I
        mean). I'll momentarily upload the excel file (I used the raw data from
        what DanG uploaded earlier, not sure if it's the most recent version
        with all the name corrections and stuff so please give me any errors you
        see, or better yet make them and re-upload/overwrite the file). So I did
        it in 7 distinct rankings: {best,ave} X {round 1, round 2, 1&amp;2
        combined} + {Official} in set notation. A bit too much to use average I
        know since some people didn't go right for the stop on their slowest
        times / throw out, but interesting nonetheless. The only thing I didn't
        do was to give some standard deviation values for completeness, but with
        only a size 3 sample size it would of been fairly useless. (Well...,
        with that you could better see the phenomena of inconsistant slower
        cubists beating out faster consistant cubists.) (by slower/faster I mean
        on average) Performing dozens of sortings and filterings, I am bound to
        have messed up on something, and I tried to keep everything value-based
        instead of formula-based. -Doug

        Hi all, I got back from Toronto this afternoon. It was really great to
        meet you cubers at WC! Much thanks to Dan G for organizing WC and taking
        all the questions from me...(lol) Congratulation to Dan K, the new
        champ, and all other winners and finalists of the varoius cubing
        categories. I did a 20.3 on Day 1, but couldn't get a single sub- 20...I
        guess I just got nervous. I messed up the cross once, did a wrong F2L
        combination once, and had a cube drop on 5x5x5(which killed my arms!).
        As for the blindfold event, I was told that I only had once chance, and
        if I mess up, I was to be disqualified. Jim went before me and missed
        two edges flipped, so I got really nervous and decided to go extra
        careful. I did it in 6:3?, including memorization, which was a terrible
        time for me, but managed to get into the finals. (I bombed the 4x4x4 on
        centers) Only Dror and I made it to the finals, and we had a face-off on
        Sunday. The results: Both of us messed up in the final, and since Dror
        had a better time on the qualifying round, he got the first place and I
        the second. The fact that we only got one try at it was the biggest
        mistake in the BLD categories. In BLD, you can never really be sure if
        you did it until you take off the blindfold, and I think it's safe to
        say that it's impossible to keep a 100% accuracy. This results in
        competitors getting nervous, going slowly, and the results not being of
        one's best performance. Also, even with the ear plugs I could still hear
        the sound of cube and people talking and feel some sets of eyes staring
        at me from behind the curtains and the cameras rolling... It really
        wasn't the perfect BLD condition. I think BLD cubers ought to discuss
        and set rules that are best for BLD sooner or later... OK, now I'm just
        rambling again... Anyway, Congratulation to all! Macky

        You are right, "corners first" cubist like to have notation for middle
        layer move. I also developed and used a "corners first, edges last"
        system, not for serious speedcubing although it can be mastered to
        average below 20s. My notation was Sr for slice move, turning middle
        layer between right and left faces clockwise when facing right side of
        the cube. I used "r" for turning the whole cube clockwise holding right
        face. Thus, r = RsSr, u = UsSu and so on. But now I think that Rm is
        better notation for the same thing as Sr. Then, r = Rs Rm = R L' Rm. I
        would say, Rm is little bit more intuitive notation than Sr. Mirek -- In

        I guess my proposal of Rm (middle) should be replaced with Rs (slice).
        &gt; We don't need both. &gt; &gt; On the other hand, the definition of
        Rs on Jessica's page was a little &gt; bit different from what I
        expected. &gt; &gt; It says Rs means: "Rotate the right side clockwise
        and the left side &gt; anti-clockwise". &gt; &gt; I expected it to mean:
        "rotate the middle slice clockwise, from the &gt; perspective of the
        right side". &gt; &gt; I'm sure corners first people would prefer the
        second meaning, because &gt; that way the corners stay still. Maybe we
        can use the Rm symbol after &gt; all to follow the second meaning. &gt;

        After the two people were disqualified you and jacob rueth got called up
        to participate. You only care about getting credit for your times, times
        that you got to take at the expense of two other people. You should feel
        great that you lucked out and had a chance to compete in the semi-finals
        any, considering you originally DID NOT QUALIFY. Instead you told me
        these things: "i want to get credit for what i did" "they called me up
        to get times and i want credit for it" "I just want to be recognized"
        OK, everyone recognize peter babcock right now. He was ranked 34th,
        lucked out and got to go up because two other people didn't show up.
        During the semi-finals he pulled a lucky 24.?? time. A time that is
        admirable because it's under his average. Also recognize he doesn't want
        to call over anyone's attention to all the great things that went on at
        the championships. I was angry too when I had to go on sunday for
        qualifying 3x3. i wasn't too happy that there was only one run for the
        megaminx, although i would have been killed by grant in the category
        anyway. To be in the same room with ron, jessica, dan, jess, and
        countless others, was a great experience. Meeting some of the people i
        only knew by screen name was something interesting all in itself. And

        met this weekend, it is great to have a 3D conversation with you. I
        would also like to express my congratulations to all the prize winners
        out there, you guys are great. Also thanks much Dan for pulling this
        event off, it was like a surreal dream being surrounded by rotating
        cubes and the beautiful noise of the plastic grinding. I couldn't have
        been any happier with times i got this weekend. I thought for sure that
        nervousness would take its toll, but yeah... The timers i feel are
        pretty cool, after getting used to them and such. I feel that the event
        went well for the most part, but i feel that 2 days is definately not
        enough to get everything done. I think the most fun was just getting
        together with some of you and swap algs and tips of the trade. I hope
        that we can all meet again, hopefully in 2005 if another competition
        brews and that i am able to go. You guys are awesome!!! Jake Rueth

        I don't know about OLLs, but I think for the PLLs it's best to just use
        the lettering on Jessica's site. (U and A are a bit strange, and I
        always called the J one L, at least I've always called the R properly.)
        I don't seen any good way of numbering the OLLs, perhaps you should
        devise of some charting system and call them by letters representing two
        or more charicteristics. I found success in organizing the ELLs, but I'm
        no expert on OLLs. Perhaps by a letter for corner twist and one for edge
        flip followed by a number or lowercase letter within each category.... I
        don't know this is much more difficult. But, yes, it would be nice to
        see some standardization, just don't give too big a distintion between
        mirror cases, (maybe add an a) or b)). Due to the recognition aspect of
        the OLL step there needs to be differences in the inverse cases though.
        Personally, I won't use an algorithm just for it's primary effects and
        not know it's secondary effects (permutation in this case). -Doug --- In

        same method, same sequences :-) ). &gt; I don't seen any good way of
        numbering the OLLs, perhaps &gt; you should devise of some charting
        system and call them by letters &gt; representing two or more
        charicteristics. I found success in &gt; organizing the ELLs, but I'm no
        expert on OLLs. Perhaps by a letter &gt; for corner twist and one for
        edge flip followed by a number or &gt; lowercase letter within each
        category.... I don't know this is much &gt; more difficult. A lot of
        people proposed arbitrary codes labeling cube configuration. I think
        that logical and neutral rules like Helmstetter's notation is the best
        way: http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/notations.html Gilles.

        Some hasty thoughts on the weekend before I go away to Nevada for a
        week... It was of course, by far, the best world championships ever!
        Inevitably some things worked less than perfectly. We'll learn from
        those mistakes next time (and make new ones). The important thing is
        that something finally happened. I'm immensely grateful to Dan G for
        doing that heavy and thankless groundwork. It will be easier for those
        who come after. After having been asked in an interview, I decided that
        my favorites were my fellow Swede David, my fellow San Franciscan Dan,
        my fellow Lars Lars V, and of course my fellow Budapest survivor
        Jessica. Really, I have witnesses! It's a little spooky that they took
        the first 4 spots! I'm especially amused that there was a Lars in fourth
        place again this time, though Lars V may see that differently. My only
        ambition was to get a result below 25 to feel I had at least a decent
        showing. That seemed unambitious enough, but when I started badly, it
        made me even more nervous. It was only in the second last attempt I got
        24.99 and could relax a bit for the last attempt and get 21.91. It's
        weird, that nightmarish feeling when your brain, your hands and the cube
        all seem to move in different time frames, and everything jams, and the
        timer just races away the seconds. I saw it in myself and in many other
        contestants. I guess this was the first competition ever for most of the
        participants, and the first one in 20 years for most of the rest, and it
        showed. Aside from two championships I had barely met speed cubists in
        person before, and it was so much fun. Not only to be among likeminded
        people who would also just spin a cube around mindlessly when talking
        without even being aware of it (the film teams started asking us to not
        do that while being interviewed, since it screws up their sound). But
        also for seeing some things I could not have imagined. I thought the
        most unbelievable ones were David Allens index finger tricks, Chris
        Hardwick's one handed magic, and Dan Knights North Pole jacket. The
        final was a real intense drama!! I hope someone makes a good TV version
        of it all, that could be a thrilling half hour! One random fact no one
        has mentioned was that Dan Knights fastest time, his last, was achieved
        while putting back a popped piece! I don't know if anyone keeps track of
        these things, but i think that 18.76 has to be the world record for a
        popped solve! I was interviewed more times than I can remember, and I
        didn't always manage to stop my unfortunate impulse to say whatever
        outrageous thing that amuses me most, rather than more sensible things.
        So I'm a little worried what the documentaries will do with that. We'll
        see... -- "A closed mouth gathers no foot" Lars Petrus, San Francisco -

        Hi Mirek, Would you consider the notation I use? First off there are
        three basic turns. For example: R = Right layer clockwise R2 = Right
        layer 180 degrees R' = Right layer counterclockwise Then there are six
        sides: R = Right layer clockwise U = Top layer clockwise B = Back layer
        clockwise L = Left layer clockwise F = Front layer clockwise D = Lowest
        layer clockwise I think most people agree to this much. Then there are
        the middle layers or slices: r = center slice next to R u = center slice
        under U b = center slice in front of B l = center slice next to L d =
        center slice over D f = center slice in back of F And finally rotating
        the whole cube in your hand (used for "finger tricks") (Q stands for
        cube) QR = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the right QU = Rotate
        the whole cube clockwise from the top QB = Rotate the whole cube
        clockwise from the back The reasons I prefer this notation are: 1. the
        consistant lettering means not having to figure out which is the x,y or
        z axis or the M S E slices etc. The slice are the same letter as either
        side adjacent. 2. There are provisions for rotating the cube. 3. This
        can be applied to the 4x4x4 with no changes. 4. There is one letter for
        moving one layer like "R' or "r" and the option of using two for two
        layers like "Rr". 5. Except for Q there are no other letters added to
        the main ones, and Q for cube seems easier to remember for most. David J

        like to have notation for middle &gt; layer move. I also developed and
        used a "corners first, edges last" &gt; system, not for serious
        speedcubing although it can be mastered to &gt; average below 20s. My
        notation was Sr for slice move, turning middle &gt; layer between right
        and left faces clockwise when facing right side of &gt; the cube. I used
        "r" for turning the whole cube clockwise holding &gt; right face. Thus,
        r = RsSr, u = UsSu and so on. &gt; But now I think that Rm is better
        notation for the same thing as Sr. &gt; Then, r = Rs Rm = R L' Rm. &gt;
        I would say, Rm is little bit more intuitive notation than Sr. &gt;

        Why fix an coordinate &gt; &gt; &gt; system if it has no other uses then

        with. Since I'm all for consistancy, &gt; &gt; &gt; mayby 'q' in

        "R[m]" to indicate subscript if you can't embed it in the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        HTML, just go for "Rm". (m,s,a) is from Mirek as far as I can trace &gt;
        &gt; &gt; back. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I actually forgot that I had seen
        this notation before... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/notation.html &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I guess my proposal of Rm (middle) should be replaced with Rs
        (slice). &gt; &gt; We don't need both. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other
        hand, the definition of Rs on Jessica's page was a little &gt; &gt; bit
        different from what I expected. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It says Rs means:
        "Rotate the right side clockwise and the left side &gt; &gt;
        anti-clockwise". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I expected it to mean: "rotate the
        middle slice clockwise, from the &gt; &gt; perspective of the right
        side". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure corners first people would prefer
        the second meaning, because &gt; &gt; that way the corners stay still.
        Maybe we can use the Rm symbol after &gt; &gt; all to follow the second
        meaning. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ryan

        Hi everyone!! It was good to meet all of you. It was extremely
        interesting for me to be around true speedcubists for the first time. It
        made me realize that I am probably better suited to blindfolding, (you
        speedcubers are so good!!) and at least for me, the two don't mix that
        well. I found it difficult to switch from warming up for the 4X4X4 speed
        cubing, then suddenly shifting gears to participate in the 3X3X3
        blindfold, then going back immediately for 4X4X4 blindfold speedcubing
        then going back yet again for 4X4X4 blindfold. This left me with
        insufficient mental energy to have any chance at 4X4X4 blindfold. I,
        like Macky, was disappointed to learn that there would be only one round
        of the blindfold events. I wish I had thought to ask the number of
        rounds before going in for my attempt. Perhaps I would have been more
        careful to remember to flip those last two edges. (My miss was simple
        omission of 12 moves.) I just assumed that there would probably be three
        rounds. Having additional rounds would have given all of us a chance to
        adapt to the unique circumstances. There is also a disadvantage to going
        first, since subsequent competitors know what time (if any) they have to
        beat. This disparity is maximized in a one round contest. I also agree
        with Macky that the nerves that can cause slow times for speedcubists
        very often cause total failures for blindfolders. Multiple rounds are
        absolutely necessary, because even the best blindfolders miss every so
        often. I know that Geir Ugelstadt feels the same way on this point. In
        retrospect I can see why cameras were present in the blindfold booths,
        but that doesn't mean that they should have moved around, particularly
        during the memorization phase. Once the blindfold is on, if they wish to
        move around quietly, that's probably OK. Personally, the presence of
        noise was not a bother to me. It was variations in the noise that
        mattered. The sound of 4X4X4's hitting the tables is an example. A
        source of white noise to mask the sounds would have been better than
        earplugs. People coming in and out of blindfold area should be strictly
        prohibited during each attempt. The biggest surprise for me was when
        Geir Ugelstadt chose to withdraw from the 3X3X3 competition. It was my
        task to allow him to vent upon his finally realizing that for this
        competition, the analysis phase would count towards the total time of
        the solve. That choice of format put him at an insurmountable
        disadvantage. For most blindfolders, the rules that were in effect make
        perfectly good sense. But then again, no one else was trying to apply
        Jessica's system in a blindfold context, as was Geir. At present, I do
        not know enough about her system to estimate the number of piece
        placements that he would have had to correctly calculate in order to be
        plan all of his moves. But certainly, it would have been several times
        what I would have used in my system. It is very audacious for him (or
        for that matter, for Gaetan Guimond, possibly others) to attempt to use
        a speedcubing system for blindfold use, and I wish him/them well in
        his/their efforts. If both Geir and Gaetan had been there, we would have
        been perfectly justified to split the 3X3X3 blindfold into two events.
        Geir and Gaetan would have battled to create the shortest possible time
        for the solution phase only, and the rest of us would have competed in
        the shortest total time for both the analysis and solving phase format.
        Macky is also correct that we blindfolders must organize, and I would
        prefer sooner than later. I feel strongly enough about this that I might
        actually do something about it. (Shock!!) I hope that everyone enjoyed
        the seeing eye blindfold demo prior to the show on Sunday. There are
        several variations to this that we can discuss if people are interested,
        perhaps in a separate group. Thanks to Dan for putting the competition
        together. It was an privilege to meet you all. See you all in 2005. Jim

        in the same room with ron, jessica, &gt; dan, jess, and countless
        others, was a great &gt; experience. Meeting some of the people i only
        knew &gt; by &gt; screen name was something interesting all in itself.
        &gt; &gt; And being interviewed 187 times was...a new &gt; experience. i
        hope to see you all in 2005, wherever &gt; it ends up being. &gt;

        I can guess one fairly good reason why we had to start/stop the timers
        by placing both hands on the pads, rather than having them start/stop
        when the cube was picked up/put down... if the latter mechanism were
        used then the timer would be stopped every time there was a piece pop
        (as the cubie would fall onto the mat). And as anyone at the RWC could
        tell you, there were quite a few piece pops. As it was, even if there
        was a pop and the piece fell onto one of the pad circles (where we
        placed our hands at the start), the timer would still keep going. I
        think the speedstack timers were a good choice for RWC. I discovered
        that it was also very important that the officials were using
        stopwatches as back-ups. During one of my solves, the stackmat didn't
        trigger properly and so my time for that solve was taken from the
        stopwatch. Jasmine. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        mm..I recently got a mail from my friend saying that he started learning
        2-step OLL from Jessica's page. I guess I had told him about finger
        short cut and things before, and he asked me for an advice on how he
        should turn OLL 35(H1 in Ron's page). I didn't know that he was learning
        the algs from Jessica's page, so took it to be the 35 I knew, which is
        N12 in Ron's page. So, I replied to him with my favorite alg for that
        corner pattern, 37 (The one I knew as 37), which is N13 in Ron's Page,
        and 24/25 in Jessica's page. So my friend looked at 37 in Jessica's
        Page, which is H3 in Ron's page and 25 I knew, found it totally
        different from what I gave him, and replied with "what the ??" after
        which I had to existance of JSCC OLL number etc... Are you following all
        this? If you are, I guess we don't need a standardized (or however you
        spell that) number for OLL&amp;PLL. But if you are not (or had to go to
        four different sites and minimize and mazimize each window and scroll up
        or down every time you read a new number in this message), I believe you
        can understand what I meant in the first message... Macky --- In

        Thanks for the suggestion, Doug. I used to use letters for PLL too, but
        now I use JSCC PLL numbering system which includes a lowercase letter
        (f,r,l,b) at the end to show the direction of the pattern. It's just

        There was an impromptu after-hours event that took place after the WC
        around midnight last Sunday at the piano bar in the Crown Plaza. It was
        a sight to behold and one that will probably not happen again anytime
        soon. It was a good ol' gun slingin' showdown between the Corner's First
        folks (Dave Allen, Gene Means) and the Layers folks (Dan Knights,
        Jessica Fridrich, Lars Vandenbergh, Mirek Goljan and more). The battle
        went on for hours ('til 1:30am) and some incredible times were recorded.
        I was the "official" time keeper using Jasmine`s handy HP iPAQ Pocket PC
        (shameless plug for my employer) and Frank Morris caught it all on video
        and several stills where taken as well. Here were some of the fastest
        times that I remember¬Ö Dave Allen ¬ñ 13.3 Dan Knights ¬ñ 14.2 Dan Knights ¬ñ
        14.7 Gene Means ¬ñ 14.9 Mirek Goljan ¬ñ 15.6 (he was handicapped by starting

        Terje, Mihn Thai's record was for a single solve. The 16.59 was the best
        for a single solve at this WC. Even if a best of 5 average was used to
        determine the outcome (I don't know how it was determined as I was ill
        and left early), there's not really an ongoing stat that we as
        speedcubers keep on that. As far as I know the main stats are best
        solve, and average of 10 (i.e. 12 solves). For the preliminaries, I
        wasn't even sure why the averages even appeared in the official
        results--in a way, showing them draws emphasis away from what not be
        clear to non-cubers who see the results... that the average means
        nothing, we only needed one good time. If the organizers had wanted us
        to care about our averages, the results of the preliminaries would have
        been an average of 3 rather than a best of 3. If you don't buy this
        arguement, look at Jess Bonde. He placed 6 in the preliminaries and went
        on to set a world record... if we went by averages, he would placed
        30th, barely qualifying for the next round! I myself couldn't have cared
        less what my second and third fastest times were. I got one time I was
        really happy with, and two crappy times, and that's absolutely fine with
        me. I'll worry about averages for the competitions that are based on
        them, like the Sunday contest. ;-) Adam --- In

        IMHO, Dan Gosbee did a tremendous job with organizing. If anyone
        disagrees, I would suggest to try to put an event of this extent
        together him/herself. I admired Dan how calm and professional he stayed
        the whole time and that he was responsive to the input provided by the
        competitors themselves. He tried to include all possible disciplines and
        a wide range of puzzles. This championship was not just about
        speedcubing of 3x3x3, but much more than that. Compared to the first
        championship, there was at least 100 times more actual cubing than in
        1982! Also, the atmosphere was quite friendly with plenty of space to
        relax. The timing device felt weird at first but I learned to like it
        with time. If anybody has suggestions for the next event, let's discuss
        this in a creative way. Dan deserves one big hug and THANK YOU from all
        of us. I was fascinated by Chris Hardwick's one handed solving, I
        admired the 7y old Victoria Zborowska how she got on the stage and
        solved the cube surrounded by a swarm of cameras and journalists with
        stings, I absolutely love Lars Petrus' sense of humor as well as his
        T-shirt with an inscription "Front of Shirt" in the front, I was in awe
        when I watched Dror Vomberg memorize the cube in 1.5 minutes and then
        solve it in another 1.5 minutes, I was stunned to hear that Ron tried
        out the pad just twice before the competition - with times in 13's (both
        unlucky cases) and I am shocked by his latest average of 15.4, and I was
        blown away by finger tricks of David Allen. It was a lot of fun to
        observe the competition between David Wesley and Masayuki Akimoto in the
        4x4x4 and 5x5x5 category, etc, etc, etc. I hope to post more with the
        pictures. All in all, the championship was a wonderful event and
        definitely a big success. I got to meet people with incredible skills
        and finally see the faces behind cryptic Yahoo nicknames. It felt so
        weird to see so many cube-crazy folks all in one room. Also, I have
        never realized what noise level can be created when 100+ people start
        twisting their cubes at the same time ... I just started to sift through
        the pictures Mirek and I took at the world championship while trying
        hard to recall everybody's names. I will need a few days to create the
        complete WC pages. Stick around. Jessica

        1:17 AM Subject: [Speed cubing group] We should do this more often! Some
        hasty thoughts on the weekend before I go away to Nevada for a week...
        It was of course, by far, the best world championships ever! Inevitably
        some things worked less than perfectly. We'll learn from those mistakes
        next time (and make new ones). The important thing is that something
        finally happened. I'm immensely grateful to Dan G for doing that heavy
        and thankless groundwork. It will be easier for those who come after.
        After having been asked in an interview, I decided that my favorites
        were my fellow Swede David, my fellow San Franciscan Dan, my fellow Lars
        Lars V, and of course my fellow Budapest survivor Jessica. Really, I
        have witnesses! It's a little spooky that they took the first 4 spots!
        I'm especially amused that there was a Lars in fourth place again this
        time, though Lars V may see that differently. My only ambition was to
        get a result below 25 to feel I had at least a decent showing. That
        seemed unambitious enough, but when I started badly, it made me even
        more nervous. It was only in the second last attempt I got 24.99 and
        could relax a bit for the last attempt and get 21.91. It's weird, that
        nightmarish feeling when your brain, your hands and the cube all seem to
        move in different time frames, and everything jams, and the timer just
        races away the seconds. I saw it in myself and in many other
        contestants. I guess this was the first competition ever for most of the
        participants, and the first one in 20 years for most of the rest, and it
        showed. Aside from two championships I had barely met speed cubists in
        person before, and it was so much fun. Not only to be among likeminded
        people who would also just spin a cube around mindlessly when talking
        without even being aware of it (the film teams started asking us to not
        do that while being interviewed, since it screws up their sound). But
        also for seeing some things I could not have imagined. I thought the
        most unbelievable ones were David Allens index finger tricks, Yes,but
        you should have seen the Japanese (I don¬¥t know his name) a couple of
        hours earlier outdoor. I wonder, who has the fastest fingers of the two!
        R Chris Hardwick's one handed magic, and Dan Knights North Pole jacket.
        The final was a real intense drama!! I hope someone makes a good TV
        version of it all, that could be a thrilling half hour! One random fact
        no one has mentioned was that Dan Knights fastest time, his last, was
        achieved while putting back a popped piece! I don't know if anyone keeps
        track of these things, but i think that 18.76 has to be the world record
        for a popped solve! I was interviewed more times than I can remember,
        and I didn't always manage to stop my unfortunate impulse to say
        whatever outrageous thing that amuses me most, rather than more sensible
        things. So I'm a little worried what the documentaries will do with
        that. We'll see... -- "A closed mouth gathers no foot" Lars Petrus, San

        Another fun thing late Sunday night (and just before the impromptu
        informal rematch Keith mentioned below) was watching Ron and DanH
        'teamsolve' 1 move at a time! I believe they both use a cross/F2L/LL
        method, but from the looks of confusion during the LL I assume that they
        use a few different algs for the last layer. Their first teamsolve took
        ~8 minutes and was hilarious to watch as they both seemed to attempt to
        use different LL algs. Their second attempt was a much more successful 2
        minutes. :) Teamsolving 1 move at a time was more than my brain was up
        for at midnight after 2 solid days of cubing, so I opted for an easier
        version (ie. teamsolve one alg at a time) with Lars V, Michiel, Jasmara
        and anyone else who happened to walk past the table at the time. :)

        solving, I admired &gt; the 7y old Victoria Zborowska how she got on the
        stage and solved the &gt; cube surrounded by a swarm of cameras and
        journalists with stings, I &gt; absolutely love Lars Petrus' sense of
        humor as well as his T-shirt &gt; with an inscription "Front of Shirt"
        in the front, I was in awe when &gt; I watched Dror Vomberg memorize the
        cube in 1.5 minutes and then &gt; solve it in another 1.5 minutes, I was
        stunned to hear that Ron tried &gt; out the pad just twice before the
        competition - with times in 13's &gt; (both unlucky cases) and I am
        shocked by his latest average of 15.4, &gt; and I was blown away by
        finger tricks of David Allen. It was a lot of &gt; fun to observe the
        competition between David Wesley and Masayuki &gt; Akimoto in the 4x4x4
        and 5x5x5 category, etc, etc, etc. I hope to &gt; post more with the
        pictures. &gt; &gt; All in all, the championship was a wonderful event
        and definitely a &gt; big success. I got to meet people with incredible
        skills and finally &gt; see the faces behind cryptic Yahoo nicknames. It
        felt so weird to see &gt; so many cube-crazy folks all in one room.
        Also, I have never realized &gt; what noise level can be created when
        100+ people start twisting their &gt; cubes at the same time ... &gt;
        &gt; I just started to sift through the pictures Mirek and I took at the
        &gt; world championship while trying hard to recall everybody's names. I
        &gt; will need a few days to create the complete WC pages. Stick around.

        Hi friendz, This whole week was wonderful! The idea of this world
        championship started in the 2nd half of 2000 among Dan Knights, Chris
        Hardwick, Matt Wilder and me. But it only came to life when Dan Gosbee
        took over the organization. He made it all happen. And it was bigger
        than we dreamt of. There was even a media hype. Not only did Dan make it
        happen, he also did the organization of the event. Which is a lousy job,
        because you will always get complaints (rightly or wrongly). The second
        day was almost perfect! We cannot thank you enough, Dan. We should also
        not forget the sponsors: KroegerInc (David Charbonneau and the other
        officials), Rubiks.com/Hessport.com (Patrick Hess), SevenTowns (Chrisi
        and David and managing director David Kremer). And on the background
        Hasbro also played a very very important role. Strategic Objectives
        (a.o. Stephen) were the important factor for the media attention. Thanks
        to the sponsors! Being part of the cubing community is great. It was so
        much fun to see the faces behind the nicknames and e-mail addresses. I
        haven't seen one single cubist that wasn't nice. The atmosphere in the
        hotel was really cool. I wonder what it looked like to outsiders. Some
        of us couldn't stop playing their cubes, even when they talked to each
        other or were in the middle of an interview. It was also great to see
        some guys/girls from the old school. Like David Allen and Gene Means:
        these two are fantastic cubists. I am sure they would make a lot of
        money as street artists. It was intimidating to cube next to them,
        because their finger speed is absolutely unequalled. I am sure many of
        you felt that cubing at the WC is much harder than at home on the sofa.
        You discover other factors than just your cube, your fingers and your
        system. An important factor is the nerves, where your heart starts
        bouncing, your fingers start trembling and your hands feel cold. The
        cameras and the big audience made that even worse. But there was also a
        lot of eagerness: you want to perform well in front of an audience, and
        a lot of cubists started to rush instead of doing their normal thing. In
        the first two rounds this extra pressure was still at a reasonable
        level. You only needed to be among the best 32 resp. 8 to qualify for
        next round. Still many of us performed (a little) worse than their
        normal level, but there were also some contestants who were able to
        break their personal bests. The final was completely different because
        of an extra factor: the idea that performing well could bring you the
        world title. I was stunned by the bad times we all achieved. But I am
        sure that even if I would have known that before the final, I still
        couldn't have changed my style to going a little slower. The pressure
        just took over. Dan Knights was the coolest in these difficult
        circumstances. Congratulations Dan! Also congratulations to David Wesley
        (3rd, 2nd and 2nd place!!) and Masayuki Akimoto (the master of the
        bigger puzzles, using a very interesting system). This experience will
        make a lot of difference for future competitions. I think the level of
        the next competition will be much higher. With more good contestants and
        better preparation. I hope the atmosphere will be the same. Thanks to
        everyone! Please send me your pictures or post them somewhere on the
        net. Have fun, Ron http://www.speedcubing.com

        First off I'd like to correct Terje and Adam on Jess Bonde's time, it
        was not 16.59s it was 16.53s. I didn't get to see the team solve craze,
        but I heard that people were undoing each other's last move, how
        annoying would that be! it wouldn't of really worked for me though,
        since I use a different method. The ~8-9 way cube battle / musical
        chairs with cubes (for scrambling) was my favorite part of the whole
        weekend. I got there a bit late. According to Keith it was a showdown
        between Corners First and Fridrich method, I got in there the last
        half-hour to represent a Lars or Lar's variant! I think I might have
        beaten David Allen...., uhh ONCE! (Lovin' his signature trigger.) Yes, I
        too am thankful for DanG's work on organizing the event. It is easy to
        criticize if you've never been to such a thing before. After hearing the
        opinions of Jessica and Lars (the only two returning from Budepest), I
        think everything ran well... you can't really plan for something like a
        timer getting stolen (having it would of boosted productivity by 25%).
        Even though I have little interest in the BLD event (besides to watch in
        amazement), I do agree with Macky's and Jim's opinion on the number of
        rounds and stuff. I don't believe they were all told about how there
        would only be one round! But why, oh why, did we have to write down a
        bibliography line if they wern't going to read it when your up on
        stage??? (I suppose too many comfilicting/overlaping starts.) So to sum
        it up: '82 was done great for the audience/tv, '03 was done well for the
        competitors (getting 3 continuous solves as opposed to waiting forever
        in between solves). You just can't compare, of course this one wasn't
        'perfect,' but it's infinately better then the last! (category-wise)
        Yes, I think most of us actually liked the timers, and to quote DanG
        "created complete fairness." I judged that Jessica had one of the
        hardest time adjusting to it, but in the end, got the hang of it. I just
        kept telling people that "your hands should hit the mat before the cube
        does!" It looked cute and all to have a 7yr old reach way up to grab the
        cube, but somebody really should have given her something to stand on
        (chair, table, higher platform). (did they?, I only watched one of here
        solves) The whole distraction thing during BLD memorization was complete
        CRAP, no one should of been allowed back there! I have a hard enough
        time doing half of what's needed at home in a realxed environment. I am
        curious to know of #33 and #34's times (sorry about names, but beeter
        not to single anyone out) in the semi-round, they deserve to know and it
        doesn't appear to be on the provided spreedsheet. -Doug (regret not
        entering 4x4, but just happy to have earned a world ranking) p.s. this
        whole event has given me tons of new ideas to try, now I just need to
        find a swimming pool, blindfold (no more pulling a sweather over my
        head), 2x2, paraminx, and of course directions to go in the quest for
        humanity's ever elusive goal of solving the cube rediculously fast... :)

        I just wanted to send a post with my story in it, sorry if it seems
        redundant but I just couldn't believe how awesome last weekend was! I am
        incredibly thankful to Dan G for organizing this event, and for letting
        me compete in the 4x4x4 last minute, which held up everyone before going
        on to the next round :-( . I also have to say that I liked the timers a
        lot more than I expected to. I had practiced the setup at home before
        the championships but actually having the timer there was much cooler. I
        have a suggestion, though I have no idea how this might be done. Perhaps
        the speedstack people could manufacture a "cube" timer that is a much
        shorter area (maybe a 1ft. x 1ft. square) instead of the wide
        rectangular mat for an official cube timer. We cube people don't need
        all the space on the sides, which the cup stacking people need in order
        to build the three cup pyramids. This could be the official timer that
        they could sell through the rubiks.com site. Anyway, just an idea. Also
        I just wanted to say how amazing it was to meet everyone! I'm so used to
        people around school not really paying attention when I cube, or asking
        a couple questions with not a lot of real interest. It was amazing to be
        in the same room with like minded people who also cube when talking to
        other people without realizing :) I do have to say that it was awesome
        to race some of the "big names" in cubing, as well as to see David
        Allen's AMAZING finger tricks! I tried to do the same move but couldn't
        even get to a third or a fourth of his speed :) &gt;From my perspective,
        nerves were a big issue. I remember having my knees feel slightly weak
        while at the timer. I'm amazed at all the people who achieved a sub-20
        time under those conditions, especially the final round! I was nervous,
        and I wasn't even on stage! I can't imagine what that must have been
        like! So anyway I thought I was addicted to the cube before the WC but
        now, having met other people who are just as interested in the cube, I
        don't think I'll ever stop :) Last weekend was so incredibly amazing
        (thanks so much to Dan G for setting it up!) and I am very excited and
        very much looking forward to seeing all of you people, and hopefully
        more, in 2005. Chris

        It was so cool to see other people doing the one handed! I get weird
        looks for practicing the cube at school, but even weirder looks when
        people see me doing it one handed :) It was fun to see other people who
        were also interested in this side aspect of the cube. Yes I do use one
        handed "finger tricks" though they aren't real finger tricks in the
        sense of when you do them two handed. Basically my strategy is to use
        all of my fingers, though I'm still working on incorporating my pinky
        finger in my cubing, right now I just use it to stabilize the cube.
        Anyway an example of what I mean by a one handed finger tricks is this,
        hold the cube (left handed) with your thumb on the center sticker of the
        F face. Hold your middle finger on the center sticker of the B face and
        your ring finger on the B sticker of the DBR piece. Place your index
        finger on the B sticker of the BUL piece. &gt;From this setup you can do
        the moves U'R or RU' very quickly (for one handed). For the first move
        flick the U face with your index finger, then immediately after it is
        done turning flick the R turn with your ring finger. For the second move
        pull the R face with your ring finger first, then immediately after it
        stops turning pull the U face with your indx finger. There are lots of
        little tricks like this where you can do 2-3 turns very quickly in
        succession. It's kind of hard to explain but easy to show. Perhaps I can
        work on getting some videos up of what I mean if people are interested.

        are observations that could only be made AFTER my first blindfold
        competition, which was last Saturday. For example, because the blindfold
        cubists did not communicate AT ALL prior to the event, there was no way
        even for us to know that the 3X3X3 blindfold should really have been
        split into two different categories. It was only by getting us all
        together that this realization is now possible. It may seem that we are
        all ganging up against you telling you what you could have done better,
        but that is really not the case at all. The blindfolders who were there
        now understand each other's point of view, and are agreeing with each
        other rather than lobbying you for rules that favor their own brand of
        blindfolding. This could not have happened had you not created an event
        that would bring a significant number of us together. I am certain that
        I would not have had a chance to meet other blindfolders unless you had
        organized the contest. There were many other things that happened that I
        could not have anticipated had I been in your shoes, and I am a
        blindfold cubist. So I can not even blame you for not being one of our
        number. Knowing the blindfolders that I met, none of them (including me)
        were capable of making the event happen. We are just recording our
        suggestions for next time now, while they are still fresh in our minds.
        I hope this helps. I said it in my prior posting, but I had best say it
        again. "Thanks to Dan for putting the competition together." Jim --- In

        Thanks again Dan G. for making this happen. You are the MAN! I had such
        an amazing time -- everyone was wonderful. The best part of the entire
        weekend, the part that I will remember forever, was the fun I had
        meeting all of the other "cube-geeks" from around the world. I think
        everyone was just happy to finally be in the presence of other
        speed-cubers! We had so much fun racing eachother on Sunday night at the
        hotel bar. It's too bad we can't to it all the time. I've been competing
        in other sports for many years, and I've never been to a competition
        with so much mutual support between the competitors. Whenever we weren't
        competing, we were hanging out swapping algorithms and sharing
        techniques. Everyone I met was very friendly. I agree that the finals
        really came down to a mental competition. All of the finalists can beat
        20.00 in our sleep, yet none of us could do it under those high-pressure
        circumstances. I did a lot of public cubing in the last year, including
        street-performing in San Francisco. I think this and my meditation,
        yoga, and hypnosis work helped me recover faster from the
        "fight-or-flight" response (as Ron said, fast heartbeat, cold hands,
        loss of concentration). By the way Ron, if you get cold hands like I do,
        I suggest wearing a big winter jacket next time! ;) I also want to
        acknowledge all of the really fast speedcubists who competed. People
        like Ron, Lars Vandenbergh, Gene Means and David Allen, Jess Bonde,
        David Wesley, Jessica Fridrich, Andy Camann, Jon Morris, Adam G√©hin (who
        couldn't come), and others, are all very fast too. A few of you are even
        faster than me at home, and I would especially like to acknowledge Ron
        who obtained a LEGENDARY average of 15.4 seconds at home before the
        championship. Congrats also to Jess Bonde with the new fastest single
        time in competition of 16.53. So, the cube is back. Popularity will only
        increase after all of the publicity surrounding the championships. And
        we are on the verge of a breakthrough in world of speedcubing. Ron,
        David Wesley, and Andy Camann have already begun to push the barriers.
        All of us using the Fridrich method were in awe of David Allen and Gene
        Means when we saw their cube handling techniques. I'm still not
        convinced that this style of "finger-pushing" (as Jess Fridrich called
        it) is good for competition settings, but it is certainly fast for use
        at home. Now we all have 2 years to improve our solution methods and
        work on steeling our nerves! Let's get some REAL averages in 2005!

        What an AMAZING WEEKEND!! As I mentioned to many of you, RWC2003 was
        part of a month-long Nth American holiday for me. I'm flying back to
        Australia in 2 days and I can now say that of all the things I've
        done/seen on this trip, the Championships was BY FAR the highlight.
        Originally, I thought of RWC as something that I was just fitting into
        my trip, but I had such a fantastic time that I'm now thinking that I
        might aim to organise future holidays to coincide with international
        cubing events! (seriously!) Living in Canberra, Australia, I think I
        probably travelled the greatest distance to get to the competition.
        Canberra doesn't have an international airport so I first flew to Sydney
        where I caught an Air New Zealand flight which went to LA via Auckland
        NZ, then I got a flight from LA to Washington DC (my initial destination
        for this holiday). I spent approximately 30 hours straight in airports
        and on planes -- that was just getting to DC, then later in the month
        took another flight to Toronto (which went via Detroit). So, eventually
        getting to Toronto meant well over 30 hours in airports/on planes,
        flying with 4 different airlines, and going through 7 different airports
        (Canberra, Sydney, Auckland, LA, DC, Detroit, Toronto). No one can say
        that I'm not committed to cubing!! :) Despite the huge amount of
        travelling it took to get to RWC, it was definitely worth it. It was
        such a wonderful thing to be a part of. :) Prior to the competition,
        there were two things that I was hoping to get out of the weekend: (i)
        achieve some good personal times (even if my times were a long way off
        those of the superspeedcubers); and (ii) meet the people behind the
        emails here. On the first point, I was pretty happy with how I went. For
        the 3x3x3 qualification round, my average was a few seconds faster than
        most of my recent averages. For the 4x4x4, I got a personal best in the
        time trials. I entered the Clock event at the last minute and was quite
        happy with my result there too. :) As it turned out, point (ii) was the
        best part of the weekend. There were just so many really nice people.
        Everyone was so friendly and supportive and positive. It was so
        inspiring that everyone was so happy to share ideas, algs, advice with
        everyone else. I feel that I made some really good friends over the
        weekend. :) I miss you guys already! Thanks to DanG for making it all
        possible!! Jasmine. PS. Peter took heaps of high resolution photos over
        the weekend. It may be a little while before we get around to making low
        res versions for the web. I'll let you all know when they're online. :)

        Ok guyz, The Champs were _awesome_. I now have the urge to learn
        speedsolving the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 and maybe more... It's so amazing how
        much faster you can improve when your with fellow 'cubers'. I had a
        great time, especially watching Master Katsu, Chris (one hand), Ron,
        Jessica, and _everyone_ with such different styles. It was really a 10
        out of 10 experience. I still have pics to load, but, i don't have them
        yet... I also have more ideas in getting faster by : GETTING A DECENT
        CUBE (thnx to Heath for letting use his backup, cuz mine really was
        __bad__.). I really had one of the worst cubes around! it was amazing
        seeing all these 'loooose' cubes around. new ideas are just FLOWING.

        all of the slots. What is a good logical way to solve the last 4? I've
        looked all over the net, and I don't understand what is expected when
        solving these. Can anyone give me a link to something that easily

        It was really weird when I did a pretty good but not excellent time one
        handed, but everyone was really impressed by it. I think the reason I
        did good was just because not many people practice one handed. I hope
        you get some vids up, I couldn't see you very well on the stage. That
        finger trick will take ages to get used to, but I'm going to practice it
        a lot. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, cmhardw

        handed :) It was fun to see &gt; other people who were also interested
        in this side aspect of the &gt; cube. &gt; &gt; Yes I do use one handed
        "finger tricks" though they aren't real &gt; finger tricks in the sense
        of when you do them two handed. &gt; Basically my strategy is to use all
        of my fingers, though I'm still &gt; working on incorporating my pinky
        finger in my cubing, right now I &gt; just use it to stabilize the cube.
        &gt; &gt; Anyway an example of what I mean by a one handed finger tricks
        is &gt; this, hold the cube (left handed) with your thumb on the center
        &gt; sticker of the F face. Hold your middle finger on the center &gt;
        sticker of the B face and your ring finger on the B sticker of the &gt;
        DBR piece. Place your index finger on the B sticker of the BUL &gt;
        piece. &gt; &gt; From this setup you can do the moves U'R or RU' very
        quickly (for &gt; one handed). For the first move flick the U face with
        your index &gt; finger, then immediately after it is done turning flick
        the R turn &gt; with your ring finger. For the second move pull the R
        face with &gt; your ring finger first, then immediately after it stops
        turning pull &gt; the U face with your indx finger. &gt; &gt; There are
        lots of little tricks like this where you can do 2-3 turns &gt; very
        quickly in succession. &gt; &gt; It's kind of hard to explain but easy
        to show. Perhaps I can work &gt; on getting some videos up of what I
        mean if people are interested. &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; --- In

        Yeah, it was awesome! I've solved the 5x5x5 already, it took me half an
        hour though. My method, which is the same as everyone else in the
        world's for big cubes, is very simple but very slow. It's the common
        centers then edges then big 3x3x3 method. I've worked out a plan for the
        3x3x3. Heath and probably a few others already use it, but here's how it
        works: The Petrus method orients the edges during the F2L, and that
        usually takes 5-10 moves for me. If I don't orient them, but just
        complet the F2L as is, then I can learn the orientation algs and still
        solve a two-look LL. It should cut about 3-5 seconds off, eventually.
        Hopefully within two years. :) BTW, Brent, this is Mike. The one from

        At the WC, I noticed something reeaally weird. There were about a

        Oh yeah, at first my arm/wrist/hand was sooo sore. You can imagine how
        sore it was during the WC, when I did it about 20 times a day to
        practice. But you just need to do it often. It takes a lot more
        dexterity for one handed. I've heard about these chinese ball things
        that you manipulate in your hands to strengthen them. So do anything
        requiring dexterity to practice. One thing that I did, but didn't
        consider to be dexterity improving until I got into it, was magic. Card
        sleights, and 'flourishes' as they're called, help a /ton/. That coin
        knuckle rolling thing is not only helpful, but it's fun and impressive.
        I can do it on both hands (at once), and two coins at once on my left
        hand. If you want to learn card stuff for dexterity practice, visit
        www.superhandz.com and www.handlordz.com. --- In

        practicing the cube at school, but even weirder &gt; &gt; looks when
        people see me doing it one handed :) It was fun to see &gt; &gt; other
        people who were also interested in this side aspect of the &gt; &gt;
        cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes I do use one handed "finger tricks" though
        they aren't real &gt; &gt; finger tricks in the sense of when you do
        them two handed. &gt; &gt; Basically my strategy is to use all of my
        fingers, though I'm &gt; still &gt; &gt; working on incorporating my
        pinky finger in my cubing, right now I &gt; &gt; just use it to
        stabilize the cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway an example of what I mean
        by a one handed finger tricks is &gt; &gt; this, hold the cube (left
        handed) with your thumb on the center &gt; &gt; sticker of the F face.
        Hold your middle finger on the center &gt; &gt; sticker of the B face
        and your ring finger on the B sticker of the &gt; &gt; DBR piece. Place
        your index finger on the B sticker of the BUL &gt; &gt; piece. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; From this setup you can do the moves U'R or RU' very quickly
        (for &gt; &gt; one handed). For the first move flick the U face with
        your index &gt; &gt; finger, then immediately after it is done turning
        flick the R turn &gt; &gt; with your ring finger. For the second move
        pull the R face with &gt; &gt; your ring finger first, then immediately
        after it stops turning &gt; pull &gt; &gt; the U face with your indx
        finger. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are lots of little tricks like this
        where you can do 2-3 &gt; turns &gt; &gt; very quickly in succession.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's kind of hard to explain but easy to show.
        Perhaps I can work &gt; &gt; on getting some videos up of what I mean if
        people are interested. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---

        (sorry for all these posts!) Do you lube your cube at all? If you do it
        more, then you could probably lower your times a lot, perhaps average
        sub-20 soon. Just an idea. And I was also inspired to learn basically
        all of the puzzles well enough to compete next time. I'm planning on
        being the Jack of All Trades but the Master of None (except the 3x3x3).

        fast. Other than Dan and any others I don't know about. One reason I'm
        wondering is this: A few months ago, I posted something about
        Superhandz. No one replied, probably because it was in the middle of a
        discussion about God's Algorithm or something. But superhandz.com is a
        site that is all about freaky good dexterity. They mainly focus on card
        manipulation, but they also have pen spinning, coins, cup stacking, and
        lock picking. I just sent an E-mail to the webmaster suggesting Cubes,
        because there are sort of cube flourishes one can do, like pointless but
        cool triggers and stuff.

        I noticed that Lars P (and possibly some others?) commented that he was
        slightly concerned about how he came across during the all the
        interviews over the weekend. Me too. :/ I hope I didn't come across as
        too much of a weirdo!! Is anyone concerned by how they went in
        interviews? Being one of the few female cubers, pretty much every media
        person there asked me questions like "why do you think there are so few
        female speedcubers?" and "what is it like to be a female cuber in a
        competition dominated by males?" I didn't really have any good answers
        for these questions. I love puzzles, so it's not easy for me to come up
        with reasons why other people don't. As for the second question, I was
        just happy to meet other cubers, didn't matter if they were male or
        female. I never thought of cubing as a gender-specific activity, but the
        number of males vs females in this group and at the competition suggests
        that perhaps it is? What sort of questions was everyone else asked? I
        mean, besides the usual ones (eg. Why are you obsessed by cubing? How
        long have you been cubing? What sort of preparation have you done for
        the competition? etc. etc.) Jasmine.

        All the reporters were asking me whether or not my blue hair had
        anything to do with the competition. One guy even wanted a shot of me
        and my group leaving the hotel holding cubes and talking (after an
        interview with the usual questions)! As for the male vs female issue, I
        dont really know. I'm curious to know what other people have to say
        about it though. Peter --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        female cuber in a &gt; competition dominated by males?" I didn't really
        have any good &gt; answers for these questions. I love puzzles, so it's
        not easy for me &gt; to come up with reasons why other people don't. As

        didn't matter if &gt; they were male or female. &gt; &gt; I never
        thought of cubing as a gender-specific activity, but the &gt; number of
        males vs females in this group and at the competition &gt; suggests that
        perhaps it is? &gt; &gt; What sort of questions was everyone else asked?

        comes to throwing, bowling, golfing, batting, hammering and many other
        physical sports/activities, I am right-handed. I find that in cubing, I
        use my left hand for most slice turns, but I do alternate to the right
        hand when necessary. My right performs middle slices flips, finger
        tricks, etc, better than my left hand. In the Jeff Geotz article, it
        mentioned that speedcubist tend to be left-handed like chessplayers. I
        also happen to modestly be a decent chessplayer. In fact, I took up
        cubing because it was more of a single-player thinking game, than a
        two-player game. It gets hard to find really good chessplayers at my
        skill level that are actually willing to play. I do play anyone when the
        opportunity arises - novice or master. Most people would consider me
        left-handed because I write with my left hand. Some people call me
        ambidextrous because I do a lot other things with my right hand. Always

        Like everyone else, I had a wonderful time. The best thing was just to
        meet all the different people, putting faces to all the names I see here
        (too many to mention) and in the twisty forum (Sandy, Carter, Oscar,
        Darren, etc). [Note: rest of post is repeat of my post on the twisty
        forum] As for the competitions, they were fun too despite the slightly
        chaotic first day. I didn't take part in the 3x3x3, but instead went for
        the easier events, Rubik's Magic, Rubik's Magic Master Edition, Rubik's
        Clock, and Pyraminx. I had actually only practised and planned for the
        Magics, the other two were a last minute decision. I hadn't touched a
        clock or a pyraminx in a year. I didn't really deserve to win at the
        clock, as I messed up and had a bad time (39 secs) but there were few
        participants in it. The Magics on the other hand were more competitive
        events, and hard to win. It is strange how being up on stage in a real
        competition affects your mind. For example, during the inspection time
        for the pyraminx I checked which face was which colour and how to turn
        the corners. The moment the timer started running and I picked it up, my
        mind went completely blank, and I had forgotten the colours of the faces
        again. On the clock I did so badly that I messed up the first side while
        solving the second, so I in fact had to solve three sides instead of
        two. At least with the magics there is no thinking involved and you can
        do it by rote. Anyway, I picked up three prizes, each consisting of a
        signed wc2003 rubik's cube, a signed photo, a framed Hungarian stamp
        with the cube on, and a cheque for 500 Canadian dollars. I think I must
        have won the most for the least effort of anyone there. All in all it
        was a great week. Jaap

        As far as I know, Singmaster came up with Rs for the "slice" move RL',
        and Ra for the "anti-slice" RL. For cube rotations he often uses
        italics, but I prefer Rc for a cube rotation in the direction of an R
        face turn (what you call r) because it is clearer and can be used on
        cubes of any size. I use Rm for a turn of the middle slice in the
        direction of R. So Rc=RmRs=L'RmR etcetera. In my opinion we don't really
        need Rs since it was only invented to notate a middle layer slice turn
        without moving the centres. Jaap --- In

        "r" for turning the whole cube clockwise holding &gt; right face. Thus,
        r = RsSr, u = UsSu and so on. &gt; But now I think that Rm is better

        I would say, Rm is little bit more intuitive notation than Sr. &gt;

        &gt; I guess my proposal of Rm (middle) should be replaced with Rs
        (slice). &gt; &gt; We don't need both. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other
        hand, the definition of Rs on Jessica's page was a little &gt; &gt; bit
        different from what I expected. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It says Rs means:
        "Rotate the right side clockwise and the left side &gt; &gt;
        anti-clockwise". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I expected it to mean: "rotate the
        middle slice clockwise, from the &gt; &gt; perspective of the right
        side". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure corners first people would prefer
        the second meaning, because &gt; &gt; that way the corners stay still.
        Maybe we can use the Rm symbol after &gt; &gt; all to follow the second
        meaning. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ryan

        I was sort of an anomaly here. I am not a speed cubist, I am a cube
        artist.. I came here hoping that more would come to exhibit. The area in
        front of the auditorium, where the competitions were held, was reserved
        with this purpose in mind, but I was the only one exhibiting. This gave
        me a jolt, because people also told me that they have never seen
        anything like this¬Öso many cubes¬Ö I came here with 20 percent conviction
        that I just may be the only one in the world, who is doing 3d designs.
        Now that I am back home, that conviction has risen to 80 percent. If
        even here, at this high international forum, no one can give me the name
        and contact info of a person who can do it, then that means¬Öthat means¬ÖI
        may be the only one. Guinness was not here, so I could not talk to them
        to find out if I qualify for their `rare skills category', or whatever
        they call it. Too bad, I have to try reaching them. But how? Can anyone
        offer any suggestions? I am very grateful to people who helped me with
        my 345 design cubes, spanning 3 designs. David C. (forgive me, but I
        will never master the spelling of your last name) came to me at the
        airport in Toronto and took us and the cubes to the Crowne Plaza Hotel.
        I set up my designs in the Science Center on Friday afternoon and
        Saturday morning. On Saturday evening I learned, that the Championship
        is moving to a different venue within the Science Center. The timers,
        tables, everything had to go. Of course, my designs had to go, also. How
        am I going to move 3245 cubes in a timely manner, I worried. Another
        person saved the exhibit and my sanity. His name is Janos Kovacs. He
        bundled my designs (which I collapsed into cubical structures) and tied
        them up into boxes by a very clever way. The designs were delivered to
        the venue intact. And I set them up easily. He has my deep gratitude.
        Finally, there is Grant Tregay. He and his wife drove in his car from
        Chicago to Toronto, so they had to drive back.. Since I also live in the
        Chicago area, I asked him to take a suitcase full of cubes with him in
        his car, and I would pick it up. He said he had enough room in his car,
        no problem. Thanks, a lot, Grant and Betty. (For the inquiring minds,
        the number of cubes in that suitcase was 243.) There is a lesson to be
        learned here: I should have taken fewer cubes.. But I wanted to show my
        best. Fewer cubes mean less interesting designs. But what if there us
        another venue change? Next time Mr. Kovacs may not be around with his
        clever ideas and his willingness and ability to help. What then? (BTW,
        Mr Kovacs is an Executive Manager of the Rubik Studio in Budapest,
        Hungary. His boss is Mr, Rubik.) In spite of those problems, it was a
        great weekend.. I have never seen so many people twiddling the cube in
        one place. Congratulations to the winners. And thanks, Dan, for making
        this event possible. Also, I understand perfectly that this was a speed
        cubing event. Perhaps if there were more cube artists present, they
        could help each other out. Speed cubing is not the same as cube art.
        Speed cubists take much less cubes than cube artists. Technically, a
        speed cubist needs only one cube. A cube artist requires tens, perhaps
        hundreds of Rubik's cubes.

        than necessary. Basically, while you still have 3 or more mismatched

        another into FR such that a slice move will align a new pair - Put a
        third onto either U or D (we just need it not to be in either BL or BR)
        - Do the slice move to make the new pair - Replace the new pair with the
        still-mismatched edge from U or D... Be sure not to mess up the centers
        in the process - use something like R U R' or F' D2 F for this purpose.
        - Reverse the slice move (to fix the centers) With this, you can get
        down to just 2 sets left. Make sure that along the way you don't undo

        the alg previously mentioned from Chris Hardwick's page:

        of using BR) - Apply this sequence: d (R U') (R' U y') (R' U R) d' His
        alg is shorter, but I find this much easier for speed applications. If
        you prefer, d and d' can be replaced by u' and u, respectively. Also, d
        and u (lowercase) can be taken to mean either slice only or both face
        and slice - it is unimportant. - Grant

        The Rubik's Clock is actually easier than it first appears. When you get
        the hang of it I'm sure you'll come to this conclusion too! :) I entered
        the Clock at the last minute. Like Jaap, I hadn't done any preparation
        for it (I never planned on entering and so I didn't even bring my Clock
        to Toronto). When I saw how few competitors there were for that category
        I thought "why not enter? I might go okay". I surprised myself by coming
        2nd! I think Lars V (who came 3rd in the Clock), also just entered at
        the last minute and without any preparation. I suspect there will be far
        more people in the Clock event next time, and that much faster times
        will be achieved. :) Jasmine. --- In

        I think the reason why most everyone uses their left hand for one-
        handed is because of two reasons. #1 being your used to mostly holding
        the cube in your left hand and just using your right for moves
        basically, so your used to holding it with your left for one- handed. #2
        is the sides of the cube you are used to seeing while speedsolving, your
        used to holding it with your left hand so your used to seeing the right
        side and its easier to recognize the situations from that side possibly.

        The day after competition (25th), we went to McDonald's for breakfast,
        down the street from the Science Center. On our table there was a

        I hope you are being sarcastic. I am sorry if that made me seem like I
        was singling myself out (I processed the data so maybe I get that
        right...). All I did was follow a very simple rule (top 10 of any
        ranking highlighted), and I did get a good time (20.36) on round 1 among
        the other people in the bottom half of the 32 qualifiers. Your best time
        out of all 6 attempts was 23.32. So it is not nice of you to criticize
        someone who performed slightly better then you, average- wise too. But
        you are welcome to come up with some REASONABLE scheme that
        showcases..., say French cubists for instance. Ok, maybe a bit hasty,
        your official ranking is higher, but I got better averges in both
        rounds. Whatever, lets all just LET IT GO. The times get a bit
        meaningless when you stare at them too long, especially so few of them.
        (Using the sample size and computing standard deviations and stuff there
        actaully is a very, VERY terrible confidence interval for one person
        actaully being better then another based on the "offical rankings."
        That's not to say that any of you should go do a statistical anaysis on

        About cramped hands, when I first started doing one handed cubing I
        literally could only do maybe 2-3 solves a day, on my loose cube. My
        hand would cramp up and my wrists would just feel sore afterward. It
        helps to do finger stretches before you start and between solves, you
        can just look up hand stretches or things like that on google. Also,
        just practicing a lot helps your hand to be able to last longer without
        tiring out. When I first started, I think 9 months ago, my hand would
        tire out near the end of the first solve, but now I can do an average of
        10 all in a row. It's all about lots and lots of practice to build your
        hand strength. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; gets cramped? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think cramping is a
        normal thing, if you're really making an &gt; &gt; effort &gt; &gt; &gt;
        to go quickly one-handed... Another thing that may be at work &gt; here
        &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; hand size. I know I have a relatively easy
        time of doing &gt; puzzles &gt; &gt; one- &gt; &gt; &gt; handed, because
        I have large hands. If you have small hands, it &gt; &gt; may &gt; &gt;
        &gt; make the one-handed thing even more difficult than it already is
        &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; most people. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I am one of so many guys who want to thank Dan Gosbee for his great job
        organizing this event and his willingness to include so many
        competitions and categories so that everybody would be pleased having
        his or her chance to win. It?s not that I don?t criticize anything (like
        going behind the schedule on Saturday) because I?m one of the winners in
        one of the competitions but because I can imagine how tough it must have
        been for Dan to find compromises while trying to make the championship
        the best he could. Some of us wouldn?t even believe until the last
        moment that the second world championship would become reality. This
        thing, along with some of us ;-), just waited 21 years for somebody
        strong and determined ? a cubelover Dan G. Thank you, Dan, and thank you
        for doing it this year. I didn?t win the 40-and-up age speedcubing
        category only because I?m that fast but more because the championship
        was not postponed one more year. Notice that three of 8 finalists are
        39! My luck! J I think this year was the right year. I didn?t know
        before that there was an advantage of getting older J. BTW, when the
        first championship took place in Budapest 1982 I thought I was somewhat
        old to play with the cube (being 22 years old) but now I do not think I
        am that old. What to say more? It was incredible experience to meet
        people who traveled hundred of miles to half way around the globe to
        meet and compete with other cubists and puzzle solvers. Thanks all who
        came and who enjoyed this gathering and thank to the sponsors. The most
        incredible and unexpected things I?ve seen? Somebody solving the cube 1.
        faster than my eyes can follow ? David Allen 2. blindfolded under 5
        minutes - Dror Vormberg 3. being from a tropical island where people
        live in trees (joking :-)) - Yasmara Pourriek 4. blindfolded using
        Fridrich?s layer by layer method though it takes him about 2 hours -
        does anybody know the guy?s name? I didn?t actually see this but now I
        believe he can do it. Mirek

        WC 2003 was pretty amazing. I must admit I also had some doubt that a WC
        would ever take place, but after 20 years there was a major influence
        with the internet and of course Dan Gosbee's determination. This was
        like all the regional and country _and_ World championships all rolled
        into one tournament. It was a little chaotic but highly enjoyable. To
        put the speed of the cubists in some perspective I noticed in the
        qualifier the top 13 people solved the cube in under 20 seconds at least
        once. It also seemed that the Fridrich method was the method of choice
        for most competitors. My prediction before the tournament was either
        Jessica Fridrich, Dan Knight or David Allen would win the tournament,
        but Dan proved best when the pressure was on. Also David Wesley was very
        consistent for all 3 sizes of cube. I thought there was a slim chance
        that Erno Rubik himself might show up at the very end but Janos Kovacs
        told me later on that Professor Rubik was a little tired of travelling.
        I had a brief chat with Jessica and she confirmed what I pretty much had
        already discovered, that the working corner method was slower than
        combining edge pairs. Even so I think the extended Varasano method used
        by Gene Means and David Allen is still competitive with the Fridrich
        method. Marc Waterman himself used a corner starter system. Bob Peters
        started with the Varasano method and probably a few others used some
        other variation. All in all a great tournament, and I enjoyed meeting
        the other cubists. Next time I think I will give some other puzzles a
        try, like 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, or perhaps the clock. Mark

        Actually, I have one more tiny question. I've solved all of the edges,
        except that for one of them, the center edge is flipped. I know that
        this is the parity, but I'm not sure how to solve it, and again, I cant

        before solving like a 3x3x3 (or at least with only F2L solved and LL on
        U), the lower case letters (all r and l) can be taken as either slice
        only or both slice and face. If the cube is solved except for that one
        edge, it's got to be just slice moves. Either way, hold the cube with
        the messed up edge at UF. - Grant

        I was thinking the other day about cube workload. Now...I know this
        might sound ridiculous to some people...but I think that it needs
        investigation... I find that it take me awhile to warm up for the day on
        the 3x3x3, sometimes 30 solves or so...but after about 60 or 70 solves,
        I definitely start losing something... What would you say your average
        number of solves was, per day, two months from the WC? In the last
        month, leading up to the championship? Did you "taper", as one would in
        many sports...or did you just solve and solve and solve...trying to
        learn new algorithms and new techniques? I am sure many of you have
        heard of concepts like periodization of training, and
        overtraining...when an athlete is overtrained, there is a definite loss
        of coordination...and our sport is all about coordination... I would be
        interested in hearing about the work load of the fast
        cubists...like...how did Dan K's compare to someone like Katsu... I
        would imagine that once someone was in Toronto, it was just cube and
        cube and cube and cube? do you think it was good for optimum performance
        to do that? or is solving the cube a hundred times a day for someone
        that is used to that, irrelevent? does anyone that competed feel they
        might have been overtrained...to the point where they had lost their
        zip...or their rhythm? or was it ALL nerves? What is the optimum number
        of solves per day? Should that load be cycled? Back in around 1984, I
        used to average over 500 solves a day during the summer( yes, all day,
        everyday) ...with the watch...recording each one...now I average about
        100 a day, including some work on particular algs... Comments, please

        so...but after about 60 or 70 solves, I &gt; definitely start losing
        something... &gt; &gt; What would you say your average number of solves
        was, per day, two &gt; months from the WC? In the last month, leading up
        to the &gt; championship? &gt; &gt; Did you "taper", as one would in
        many sports...or did you just solve &gt; and solve and solve...trying to
        learn new algorithms and new &gt; techniques? &gt; &gt; &gt; I am sure
        many of you have heard of concepts like periodization of &gt; training,
        and overtraining...when an athlete is overtrained, there is &gt; a
        definite loss of coordination...and our sport is all about &gt;
        coordination... &gt; &gt; I would be interested in hearing about the
        work load of the fast &gt; cubists...like...how did Dan K's compare to
        someone like Katsu... &gt; &gt; I would imagine that once someone was in
        Toronto, it was just cube &gt; and cube and cube and cube? do you think
        it was good for optimum &gt; performance to do that? or is solving the
        cube a hundred times a day &gt; for someone that is used to that,
        irrelevent? does anyone that &gt; competed feel they might have been
        overtrained...to the point where &gt; they had lost their zip...or their
        rhythm? or was it ALL nerves? &gt; &gt; What is the optimum number of
        solves per day? &gt; &gt; Should that load be cycled? &gt; &gt; Back in
        around 1984, I used to average over 500 solves a day during &gt; the
        summer( yes, all day, everyday) ...with the watch...recording &gt; each
        one...now I average about 100 a day, including some work on &gt;
        particular algs... &gt; &gt; Comments, please ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill

        Hi Everyone, How I envy all of the people that were able to make it to
        Toronto! You all know each other now...and I feel like an outsider ;-) I
        knew the weekend would be difficult, because I wasn't going to be
        there...but it was much worse than I thought. I spent most of it
        scanning the net constantly, hoping for information...a lot of time in
        the Chatroom, checking Ron's site, checking this group, checking the
        french group...etc. On Saturday afternoon, a few of us had an
        alternative "world championship" in the chatroom...won by Dave O. ;-)22
        seconds, if I recall correctly... Eventually, some information started
        trickling in...I think the best early info was on the French group (and
        Ron's pictures)...Sunday I was still glued to the computer...watching
        the clock...who won?...a great need to find out what was happening...
        Eventually, I had results...and studied them...and wondered ... would I
        have had a chance to reach the round of 32, with all of the pressure of
        cubing in public? I will never know... Some of the emotions have not
        subsided this week...I have enjoyed every report...every picture...and
        the envy and depression has grown ;-) I will not miss the next
        WC...whenever it is... Great job everyone! Thanks for all the reports
        and pictures! I hope this is all just the beginning! Bill McGaugh

        To delubricate it, you could try putting it in water. Then you'll

        There is a big difference between tightness and smoothness. A cube can
        be tight and smooth at the same time (favored by the forceful style of
        ome of the fastest cubists) or could be loose and resistant. So
        de-lubing it isn't going to help much. Since there are no springs or
        screws that can be adjusted, I don't see how to tighten a 2x2. Perhaps

        That's true. But if a cube is badly lubricated and loose, then it might

        Bill, Sorry you missed the WC, was looking forward to meeting you after
        seeing all of your solves on Jess' timer. I was averaging about 100-120
        timed solves a day for the last 8 weeks leading up to the competition. I
        slowed down to about 50 solves for the last few days but went berserk on
        Friday when I arrived in Toronto. Everyone had a cube. We solved
        constantly, in the hotel, walking down the streets of Toronto, and even
        raced while going up the elevator at the CN Tower. Unfortunately, I
        overdid it and by Sunday morning my right index finger was toast. I took
        3 days off now that the competition is over and just now started turning
        the cube slowly. Still have some minor pain but I think it will be fine
        in a few days. So, Yes, I think I practiced too much on Friday and
        Saturday (My trial runs were at 6PM on Saturday) and that hurt my times
        some. But the pressure of the competition was the real problem. I don't
        even know how to prepare for it. Heart was beating, mind was racing,
        hands were clammy... everything you don't want when speedsolving. My
        strategy for 2005 is to get my average down to 12 seconds before the
        event so when I cave to the pressure I'll possibly still be sub 20 ;)

        so...but after about 60 or 70 solves, I &gt; definitely start losing
        something... &gt; &gt; What would you say your average number of solves
        was, per day, two &gt; months from the WC? In the last month, leading up
        to the &gt; championship? &gt; &gt; Did you "taper", as one would in
        many sports...or did you just solve &gt; and solve and solve...trying to
        learn new algorithms and new &gt; techniques? &gt; &gt; &gt; I am sure
        many of you have heard of concepts like periodization of &gt; training,
        and overtraining...when an athlete is overtrained, there is &gt; a
        definite loss of coordination...and our sport is all about &gt;
        coordination... &gt; &gt; I would be interested in hearing about the
        work load of the fast &gt; cubists...like...how did Dan K's compare to
        someone like Katsu... &gt; &gt; I would imagine that once someone was in
        Toronto, it was just cube &gt; and cube and cube and cube? do you think
        it was good for optimum &gt; performance to do that? or is solving the
        cube a hundred times a day &gt; for someone that is used to that,
        irrelevent? does anyone that &gt; competed feel they might have been
        overtrained...to the point where &gt; they had lost their zip...or their
        rhythm? or was it ALL nerves? &gt; &gt; What is the optimum number of
        solves per day? &gt; &gt; Should that load be cycled? &gt; &gt; Back in
        around 1984, I used to average over 500 solves a day during &gt; the
        summer( yes, all day, everyday) ...with the watch...recording &gt; each
        one...now I average about 100 a day, including some work on &gt;
        particular algs... &gt; &gt; Comments, please ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill

        My brother and I got a lot of compliments on our 5x5x5's at the WC,
        which I learned are 'Bandelows' (sp?) (Bandelow was it's distributor but
        I think it was originally made by Arxon). I don't have any secret but
        there's a few things I can think of. 1) Work in your cube. We bought our
        cubes in '95 and I remember that it used to be stiff but isn't any more.
        2) Lube your cube. As you've mentioned. 3) If you're lucky enough you
        can remove the centre caps without hurting yourself and adjust the
        tightness of the screws. I try to find that fine balance between too
        many lock-ups and too many piece pops (including those centre-corners).

        I have one last question about the 5x5 method. When I have only 2 edge
        pairs left that need pairing, sometimes I get a situation which I can't
        solve (or at least quickly anyway). The situation is this: The upper and
        lower edges in the two unsolved edge pairs are completed. The only thing
        that is preventing them from being pairs are the center edges. If I were
        to do a horizontal slice move, i would solve one edge pair (but
        obviously, i would mess up everything else) Actually, there are a few
        situations mirroring this one, like, is it possible to have both middle
        edges flipped? Sorry for all of the questions about this. thanks for all

        I know this is a response to one person, but in case anyone else is
        following I decided to post here. Yes, that is actually my preferred
        hand stretch before I start solving and in between each solve. Basically
        just bend one finger down and try to bend all your other fingers up. Do
        this for each finger one at a time. You can really feel it loosen up the
        tightness in your hand and it helps a lot, in my opinion. Chris --- In

        I don't know what your talking about. First off, I think it'd be great
        to standardize the following terminology for the 5x5: call the segmented
        edges, edge triples instead of edge pairs (this could be reserved for
        the 4x4 or a 5x5 edge minus the very middle one). If I'm reading this
        correctly it seems that at your level, you could do something as simple
        as a monoflip of on central edge piece and then turn the face to get to
        the other one and undo the monoflip on it. I amd assuming you mean that
        you have two middle edges flipped, similar problems could use a similar
        solution unless it is one or both of the two possible parity problems.
        Here is an example: Suppose you have two edges (small middle ones)
        flipped on U face, speciffically let's say UF and UB (tell by the
        adjacent edges, if there is an odd number of such then you have one of
        the parity problems that this will not fix). Then something like
        MD2M'DMD'M'-U2- MDM'D'MD2M'-U2 should work. (Here I use everybody else's
        meaning of M instead of my own inverted preference, M is turning the
        middle slice behind L cw.) Parity Problem #1, if two non-central edges
        are flipped relative to the middle one, I use Akimoto's alg... say
        they're on DFl and DFr... I get them opposite each other on the left
        slice by somthing like (Rr)^2(Ff)^2(Rr)^2 (undo this at the end)... Then
        perform r'(D2r')^4- (F2lB2l')^2. I showed my roommate David Wesley at
        Toronto and he immediately recognized it as Akimoto's... I cubed with
        him occasioanlly last year so it's not a suprise. (Everybody out there
        better know the R vs. r notation!!!) Parity Problem #2: Swap two edge
        "pairs" (I mean the triple minus the middle) (same problem as having to
        swap two corners) this one I like, it's easy and fast. (if on UF and UB)
        Just do r2U2r2U2-d2r2d2. (I figured this one out myself, but is probably
        the same as the one on Hardwick's site, a bit of a composite manuver
        where two r2's cancel out.) -Doug Li (trying very, VERY hard to break in

        Hi, I need a lot of help with the cross and F2L. I am tryin to convert
        my system into Fridrich's. I have a really bad intuition and it would
        take me more than 45 seconds to find an optimal algorithm (or close to
        optimal) to the cross. I dont want to memorize any algorithms for the
        cross (who would), so what do i do? And for the F2L. I believe if i lern
        the F2L (pairing) my time would greatly decrease. Should i memorise the
        F2L algorithms on www.speedcubing.com? The algorithms there are pretty
        good for me, has lots of F, U, anr R (LOL). ANd for memorizing. I want
        to be an excellent speed cuber and my rubiks goal is to get sub-25. As i
        said, im transfering into Fridrichs method. I have a really bad memory
        but i want to learn all OLL and PLL. What do you guys think a good rate
        of memorizing would be? (1 or 2 a day?) And last, i need a better
        speedcube. I dont want to spend 70 USD on a speedcube from Ton D. (but i
        bet there really really good). So, is it worth it to buy a 1980 rubiks
        cube? will it help my times? And also, do any of you guys have some
        1980's cubes to sell for cheap? Im only 13 and i dont make alot of
        money. AND is Arxon cubes better than Ideal cubes? ok, im done ~Robert

        don't start out by trying to find an optimal algorithm for the whole
        cross. start out by finding the optimal alg for 2 pieces of the cross in
        the pre-examination. then move on to 3 pieces. and once you've mastered
        that, then do all 4 pieces. my opinion is that memorizing loads of 6-8
        move algs for f2l is not the way to start off if you're ultimitely going
        for speed. take the time to figure the algs out on your own-- it will be
        very slow at first, sometimes taking minutes to solve one corner edge
        pair. but you will eventually learn to see all the different cases. once
        you've categorized all the cases in your head (this may take months
        depending on how much you cube), then you can look at the f2l algs to
        see which ones you can improve on. there are a few f2l algs where the
        shortest solution is not intuitive. forget memorizing the actual moves
        for oll/pll. what you are after is memorizing the starting configuration
        for both hands (which facelets to put which fingers on) and then a
        series of finger/hand flexions. you will have no idea what faces you are
        actually turning- - it will just be a sequence of finger and wrist
        flexions. at first it will take you about an hour to totally dissect an
        alg into its sections and find the optimum cube rotations, grip
        positions, and finger tricks that work for *you*. forget what other
        people do-- learn only what you do best. although if you don't already
        know the various finger-tricks that are possible, then it might make
        sense to check out other cubist's sites to see what's possible. also,
        learning one alg a day is a good rate. then spend one day each week only
        reviewing algs you know-- let them 'solidify' in your head-- give your
        learning brain a break. each oll/pll alg must be done hundreds of times
        before it is sub-25 quality. you definitely don't need a $70 speed cube
        from ton-- it won't help your times right now. what you need is a cube
        that doesn't let you cut corners-- so that you learn the algs without
        the benefit of being able to make slight errors of
        incomplete/overcomplete turns. so just buy a new 2003 cube (or 1980's is
        fine), turn it for an hour, then lube it with silicone spray and your
        good to go. when you're sub-30, then worry about $70 for ton's cube. ---

        24.53, and 27.33... I guess I didn't take that long to warm up ;) &gt;
        What would you say your average number of solves was, per day, two &gt;
        months from the WC? In the last month, leading up to the &gt;

        dedicate to cubing. My approach to it (as has been pretty consistent for
        the past couple years) is to always have a cube with me, frequently
        fiddling (when not typing, etc.), and I probably don't solve the cube
        (or any puzzle, aside from the oinkleburger.com applet) more than 15- 20
        times in a typical day. I may just not realize it, though, so I suppose
        this could be as high as 30-35, but I don't anticipate it's any higher
        than that. &gt; Did you "taper", as one would in many sports...or did
        you just &gt; solve and solve and solve...trying to learn new algorithms
        and new &gt; techniques? I would've liked to spend more time practicing,
        leading up to the WC, but as work didn't allow that, I pretty much stuck

        be adjusted, I don't see how to &gt; tighten a 2x2. Perhaps puzzle
        builders like Ton could offer a better &gt; answer. &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt;

        Earlier today I was at Pizza Hut and a guy at the counter saw me doing
        the cube. A few minutes later, he asked if I could solve it. I said
        "Yes, I can and I was just at the WC." He screwed up my cube and I
        solved it. Then he said if I did it again I would get FREE Cinnasticks.
        Of course I solved it in around 19 seconds and got the the free food!
        I've done this before on cruises at the snack bar and made bets for free
        sodas and snacks if I solved it in under 25 seconds. Every time I won.
        Try it sometime, because I'm sure they'll be amazed. Andy Camann

        Robert, The Arxon cubes are Ideal cubes:

        I would recommend getting a 1980 vintage era Ideal cube because thay are
        adjustable and usually cheaper on ebay than a new studio cube which is
        the only authentic one made today with the screws. Sealed ones are
        getting a little expensive, but there are used ones that are OK. The
        easies to tell might be the British version they're the ones in the
        cardboard cylinder. This one is from the batch made in in the 1979 style
        (see the protruding lines under the edge cubie stickers?) which I
        personally don't recommend:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2016%20Ideal%20UK%20(type%20like%20US)%201980.htm
        I prefer this one (see those lines aren't there?):
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2017%20Ideal%20UK.htm If
        you get one in a clear cylinder like this:

        make sure it's Ideal because some pirate firms copied the case too. Hope

        for the F2L, i use pejave's algs, they are very good, mostly 2 gen for
        fastness. to memorize these, i just take a pair of 10 and cram it into
        my brain. maybe you dont want to do that, you could take 2 at a time and
        memorize. just try to think in groupings of finger tricks. for OLL and
        PLL, those are a lot of algs. im still working on them. try to do dan
        knight's 4 look method for beginners. these are really easy, only about
        7. then learn his 3 look method which is the same OLL but you permute
        all. in 2 look, you have to memorize over 50 OLL algs. this will be
        pretty hard with someone with bad memory. it will take about a year or a
        year and a half to memorize them. for a speedcube, use the rubiks.com
        ones, they last the longest. get a few of those. when you get really
        good, you should buy a studio speedcube--about 20-24 bucks. good luck!

        I have a really bad intuition and it would take me more than 45 seconds
        to find an optimal algorithm (or close to optimal) to the cross. I dont
        want to memorize any algorithms for the cross (who would), so what do i
        do? And for the F2L. I believe if i lern the F2L (pairing) my time would
        greatly decrease. Should i memorise the F2L algorithms on
        www.speedcubing.com? The algorithms there are pretty good for me, has
        lots of F, U, anr R (LOL). ANd for memorizing. I want to be an excellent
        speed cuber and my rubiks goal is to get sub-25. As i said, im
        transfering into Fridrichs method. I have a really bad memory but i want
        to learn all OLL and PLL. What do you guys think a good rate of
        memorizing would be? (1 or 2 a day?) And last, i need a better
        speedcube. I dont want to spend 70 USD on a speedcube from Ton D. (but i
        bet there really really good). So, is it worth it to buy a 1980 rubiks
        cube? will it help my times? And also, do any of you guys have some
        1980's cubes to sell for cheap? Im only 13 and i dont make alot of
        money. AND is Arxon cubes better than Ideal cubes? ok, im done ~Robert

        I'm curious how people would compare the level of competitors that
        existed in 1982 vs. the recent competition. I realize that some of the
        same people competed, and some of the people, including 3 of the 8
        finalists, were cubing during the initial cube craze. Of course we can't
        really compare official times since the intial competition had stiff
        cubes and a different format. I'd like to hear from people, especially
        people who were around for the first WC, if they think the group of
        cubers at this years competition were faster than in 1982 or not. -

        I remember two years ago at Cedar Point I got a bit of free food that I
        ended up sharing with my friends just for solving the cube. It really
        needs to be someone elses cube. (Like you show them your speed wiht
        yourone then they have you do their keychain cube or something.) Back
        then I was able to solve it around 1:00 now I'm jsut strange if I do it
        in public, once you solve it say faster then 35s people start not even
        believing it, like it's some trick your doing... (Btw, if your slower
        then 1:40 people tend not to wait around till your done (fond memories
        of 10th grade Calc class).) Solving it while shoping, perhaps in the
        mall, I jsut get some stares. Most people arn't brave enough to come up
        to me and ask for a demonstration, but may be this nifty T-shirt

        Thanks for that help, there is one more question though. On the last two
        edge "triplets" (unpaired yet in the FL and FR)I sometimes get a
        situation where the middle edge of the 3 in a single triplet belongs to
        the other unsolved triplet. How can I solve this, it usually take me
        more than 10 minutes of just playing with it. Say my last two unsolved
        triplets are in the FL and FR. In each of the 2 triplets I have
        correctly placed the 2 outer edges. The middle edges however need to be
        switched between the 2 triplets. This is the situation that I am trying
        to describe. Here is the situation in a 2-D Front face view FL FR * 0 0
        * * 0 Here is what it should look like when solved * 0 * 0 * 0 Does
        anyone have an efficient way of solving this? That would be greatly

        (Sidenote: I deleted your unintentional double [identical] post.) This
        is analogous to my given parity problem #2... the algorithm I supplied
        is wrong, but appearnetly none of us know of a better one. Mine does
        what is needed (more for when it's closed to solved, as opposed to close
        to a segmented 3x3), but swaps two "central"-edges on opposite sides. I
        couldn't seem to get it to work, but thanks to Grant for pointing that
        out :). Um..., at least that is a very quick algorithm to perform... and
        I'm sure you can figure out one of the many ways of swapping two
        central-edge pieces (one-stickered-guys). I just made one up on the
        spot... love doing these that! But resouted to using my normal 3 cycle
        of center pieces on adjacent faces earlier, had to do that like 3 times
        to completely "carry it over." I don't recommend 3-cycles for
        speedcubing though. What I just did to swap two central-edge pieces was
        to get them mirrored directly accross the origin (on F and B), then do a
        bit of a "mini-H permutation or mini-+ permutation": (Dd)^2
        M'U2M-d2M'U2MD2. I know...., I know (head-down in shame), this is fairly

        &gt; What would you say your average number of solves was, per day, two
        &gt; months from the WC? In the last month, leading up to the &gt;
        championship? &gt; &gt; Did you "taper", as one would in many
        sports...or did you just solve &gt; and solve and solve...trying to
        learn new algorithms and new &gt; techniques? I think generous time off
        is often beneficial. I took off 17 months between September 2001 and May
        2003. Then on 5/9/2003, after only 2 days of cubing 3 hours a day, I got
        my best average ever! I've heard that time off allows your brain to
        discard extraneous information, sort of like defragmenting a hard drive.
        Between May and August I only trained 1-2 days a week, 100 solves per
        day. I have carpal tunnel from typing, so if I cube too much I lose
        feeling in my hands and other really bad stuff happens. Instead I train
        with a focus, like using a metronome, performing in public, or
        simulating competition settings. I tried to solve the cube as little as
        possible in the week before the championship. I knew I wouldn't get
        faster at that point, so I iced my arms and focused instead on the
        mental aspect. On the first day of the competition, I only did 2
        averages to warm up, one of which tied my best average ever (16.8). Of
        course now I'm totally inspired by everyone at the championship, so I
        haven't been able to put down my cube for more than an hour. I am
        already working on a new method for the next championship, but I really
        need to put my arms on ice for a month. I am like Linus with his blanket
        -- I need someone to take my cubes away from me! ;) -Dan K.

        Since these posts have come up on here I've been trying to look for an
        efficient way to do this, also to do it if one edge is flipped or if one
        edge is flipped and the other has the parity issue, things like that.
        Unfortunately I don't have special algs to do any of that. I always just
        solve that case by using my standard slice move followed by flipping an
        edge, followed by undoing the original slice move. If the edges are as
        you described and in FR and FL do d R F' U R' F d2 L' F U' L F' d which
        is 13 moves. This move only works if you haven't started solving like a
        3x3x3 yet. Another way to do this move is put the two edge pieces on
        opposite diagonals, so put one piece in FL and one in BR then do d2 L' F
        U' L F' R' B U' R B' d2 which is 12 moves and also only works if you
        haven't started solving as a 3x3x3 yet. If you have the entire cube
        solved and you just need to switch the outer edge groups (same as
        above), without messing everything up, do d2 F2 d2 F2 f2 d2 f2 R2 s2 R'
        f2 R s2 R' f2 R' where s means just the innermost s slice. This move is
        a lot faster if you have the edges you need to swap in UF and UB and do
        the move like this, r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2 F2 e2 F u2 F' e2 F u2 F The
        second move here is the same as the one above it just reflected. I'm
        sure there are faster (i.e. fewer moves) ways to solve all these cases
        but these are the best algs that I know. Hope this helps some, Chris ---

        Hi everyone, My WC2003 Experience pages are now online, go to
        www.cubestation.co.uk and follow the link! I have a request, does anyone
        have a video still or a picture of me solving on stage on the second
        day, that I could use to finish off the page? I would be very thankful,
        it would make the page complete. FInally, the FMC is now online, so if
        the WC has inspired you to take up more cube disciplines than just the
        3x3x3 speedsolve (I know it has for me!) then why not have a go! Simply
        follow the starred link on my site. Good Luck everyone, and thanks for a
        great time in Toronto! - DanH :) www.cubestation.co.uk [Non-text

        ITS TAKEM ME LONG TO &gt; GET TO ONE MINUTE. (with my method that is)
        &gt; &gt; So, honestly everyone, how long did it take you guys to get
        around &gt; one minute? Fear not, there are other slow(er) learners out
        there... I played with the cube for probably 1 1/2 - 2 years and only
        got my time down to 1:30 on average, never breaking about 1:15 or 1:20.
        I got to the point that I didn't think I'd get any faster, and lost
        interest for a while. I then picked it up again after a year or so off,
        and it took me probably another 6 months to a year (maybe even more) to
        get it down under 1 minute. For the last year, at least, I've been
        hovering with an average in the 28-33 second range. I'm hoping that I'll
        eventually get the chance to finish learning the other OLL cases (about
        20 of 57 left), and that should drop my average consistently under 30.

        Well I started speedcubing around Summer of 1998 and was immediatly
        doing a little over 2 minutes using a 4 look LL and intuitive F2L
        (combination of basic, basic layers and Petrus, would of been better if
        I knew about slant c/e pairing :)). Then I remember a long streach of
        1:30 around 2.5 years ago... early 2001. Within 15 months I was
        averaging under 30s... so probably touched at bit under 1:10 in April of
        that year and touched under 1:00 minute around August. Probably averaged
        under 1 minute just as summer started, and after a ton of practice over
        that summer averaged 45s. Even remembering showing off a 46s solve to my
        molecular bio class in July... So getting around 1:00 isn't that hard,
        but I did it the gruling way of figuring out my own system and
        perfecting many of my own algorithms until coasting too long at 90s.
        With internet sites showing advanced systems already and perhaps a
        friend to guide you, it's only a matter of time. I got my friend to
        about 70s after teaching him for 5 weeks with absolutely no prior
        experience and not of a technical background. I practice much more
        now... solving over 250 cubes per day, but taking a bit of a break after
        wc. A bit obsessed with my 4x4 and breaking 50s left-handed on the
        3x3.... still can't find a comfortable pool! Might get into the simpler
        stuff like 2x2 and pyraminx though. -Doug --- In

        It took me sooooo long to get to a minute. I started with a terrible
        solution, one from a book, where I couldn't get anywhere below about 1.5

        So many posts on the professor cube...darn thing...i don't even like it.
        I learned how to solve the 4x4 less than a week ago, and the 5x5 a few
        days ago. My best times for both: 4x4: 2:30.05 5x5: 16:38.97 the
        professors cube can be an ugly thing. -r1C|-|/-\rD ps. i can't do the

        to look for &gt; an efficient way to do this, also to do it if one &gt;
        edge is flipped or &gt; if one edge is flipped and the other has the
        parity &gt; issue, things &gt; like that. Unfortunately I don't have
        special algs &gt; to do any of &gt; that. I always just solve that case
        by using my &gt; standard slice move &gt; followed by flipping an edge,
        followed by undoing &gt; the original slice &gt; move. &gt; &gt; If the
        edges are as you described and in FR and FL &gt; do d R F' U R' F &gt;
        d2 L' F U' L F' d which is 13 moves. This move only &gt; works if you
        &gt; haven't started solving like a 3x3x3 yet. &gt; &gt; Another way to
        do this move is put the two edge &gt; pieces on opposite &gt; diagonals,
        so put one piece in FL and one in BR then &gt; do d2 L' F U' L &gt; F'
        R' B U' R B' d2 which is 12 moves and also only &gt; works if you &gt;
        haven't started solving as a 3x3x3 yet. &gt; &gt; If you have the entire
        cube solved and you just need &gt; to switch the &gt; outer edge groups
        (same as above), without messing &gt; everything up, do &gt; d2 F2 d2 F2
        f2 d2 f2 R2 s2 R' f2 R s2 R' f2 R' where &gt; s means just &gt; the
        innermost s slice. &gt; &gt; This move is a lot faster if you have the
        edges you &gt; need to swap in &gt; UF and UB and do the move like this,
        &gt; r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2 F2 e2 F u2 F' e2 F u2 F &gt; &gt; The second
        move here is the same as the one above it &gt; just &gt; reflected. I'm
        sure there are faster (i.e. fewer &gt; moves) ways to &gt; solve all
        these cases but these are the best algs &gt; that I know. &gt; &gt; Hope
        this helps some, &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; --- In

        one more question &gt; though. On the &gt; last &gt; &gt; two edge

        &gt; &gt; situation where the middle edge of the 3 in a &gt; single
        triplet &gt; belongs &gt; &gt; to the other unsolved triplet. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; How can I solve this, it usually take me more than &gt; 10
        minutes of &gt; just &gt; &gt; playing with it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Say
        my last two unsolved triplets are in the FL &gt; and FR. In each &gt; of
        &gt; &gt; the 2 triplets I have correctly placed the 2 outer &gt; edges.
        The &gt; middle &gt; &gt; edges however need to be switched between the
        2 &gt; triplets. This is &gt; &gt; the situation that I am trying to
        describe. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is the situation in a 2-D Front face

        I think people that start out with the Fridrich solution learn &gt; much
        quicker. I don't know why, I think one reason is that the Fridrich
        system includes a complete table of first two layer positions and their
        solutions. After you memorise this table, you will be able to react to
        any position very quickly. For the Petrus method, this sort of approach
        is impractical because there are too many different positions to
        memorise. Without such a table, learning is a very slow and difficult
        process. So why would anyone want to learn the slow and difficult way?
        Well, if you want to understand more about the cube, that's the best
        way! &gt; &gt; Wen i read posts, i get the feeling that most cubers
        could get there &gt; &gt; times to only a minute in like a day. ITS
        TAKEM ME LONG TO GET TO &gt; &gt; ONE MINUTE. (with my method that is)
        Is it a layers method? I think beginners generally lose most time in the
        last layer and not the first two layers. But for experts, it's the other
        way around. The first two layers can be done in very straightforward
        steps, without thinking: - first layer cross, one piece at a time. -
        first layer corners, one piece at a time. - second layer edges, one
        piece at a time. When you get to the last layer, you always need to
        consider 3 or 4 pieces at a time, so more thought is required. If you
        post the details of your method, I can give you further advice. Ryan

        help with the cross and F2L. I am &gt; tryin to convert &gt; &gt; my
        system into Fridrich's. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a really bad
        intuition and it &gt; would take me more than 45 &gt; &gt; seconds to
        find an optimal algorithm (or close to &gt; optimal) to the &gt; &gt;
        cross. I dont want to memorize any algorithms for &gt; the cross (who
        &gt; &gt; would), so what do i do? RP: In my personal opinion, you need
        to work on your cross before anything. A sharp and quick cross seems to
        set the pace for my solves. &gt; &gt; And for the F2L. I believe if i
        lern the F2L &gt; (pairing) my time would &gt; &gt; greatly decrease.
        Should i memorise the F2L &gt; algorithms on &gt; &gt;
        www.speedcubing.com? The algorithms there are &gt; pretty good for me,
        &gt; &gt; has lots of F, U, anr R (LOL). RP: F2L algs are good, but also
        good is to discover some of the situations on your own. Also something
        to consider, doing your cross on the left. This makes it to where all
        your f2l algs can be rights and ups. Check www.rubiks.dk, jess has one
        of the finest sites i've seen, for f2l, OLL, and PLL. &gt; &gt; ANd for
        memorizing. I want to be an excellent &gt; speed cuber and my &gt; &gt;
        rubiks goal is to get sub-25. As i said, im &gt; transfering into &gt;
        &gt; Fridrichs method. I have a really bad memory but i &gt; want to
        learn all &gt; &gt; OLL and PLL. What do you guys think a good rate of
        &gt; memorizing would &gt; &gt; be? (1 or 2 a day?) RP: First off, you
        don't need to learn OLL to be a sub25 cuber. With a standard 3-look LL
        you should/would be able to pull it off. 13-14 sec F2L 10-11 sec LL As
        far as algorithms go, i think the number depends on what you're
        learning. If you are learning an F2L alg that has a mirror, it is good
        to get that in your head on the same day. If you are bad with memory,
        maybe only one LL alg a day would be fine. Just remember to practice all
        new algs often so as not to forget them easily. &gt; &gt; And last, i
        need a better speedcube. I dont want &gt; to spend 70 USD on &gt; &gt; a
        speedcube from Ton D. (but i bet there really &gt; really good). So, is
        &gt; &gt; it worth it to buy a 1980 rubiks cube? will it &gt; help my
        times? And &gt; &gt; also, do any of you guys have some 1980's cubes to
        &gt; sell for cheap? &gt; &gt; Im only 13 and i dont make alot of money.
        AND is &gt; Arxon cubes better &gt; &gt; than Ideal cubes? RP: Finding
        good cubes can be tought, i can't really help you there.thats all the
        knowledge i have to offer -Richard &gt; &gt; ok, im done &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; ~Robert Smith (RSX) &gt; &gt; Hi Robert, &gt; &gt; The Arxon cubes
        are Ideal cubes: &gt;
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2006%20White%20-%20Yellow,%20White%20next%20to%20Red%20next%20to%20Green%20Arxon%201980.htm
        &gt; &gt; I would recommend getting a 1980 vintage era &gt; Ideal cube
        because &gt; thay are adjustable and usually cheaper on ebay than &gt; a
        new studio cube &gt; which is the only authentic one made today with the
        &gt; screws. &gt; &gt; Sealed ones are getting a little expensive, but
        &gt; there are used ones &gt; that are OK. The easies to tell might be
        the British &gt; version they're &gt; the ones in the cardboard
        cylinder. &gt; &gt; This one is from the batch made in in the 1979 &gt;
        style (see the &gt; protruding lines under the edge cubie stickers?)
        &gt; which I personally &gt; don't recommend: &gt;
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2016%20Ideal%20UK%20(type%20like%20US)%201980.htm
        &gt; &gt; I prefer this one (see those lines aren't &gt; there?): &gt;
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2017%20Ideal%20UK.htm
        &gt; &gt; If you get one in a clear cylinder like this: &gt;
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2006%20White%20-%20Yellow,%20White%20next%20to%20Red%20next%20to%20Green%20Arxon%201980.htm
        &gt; make sure it's Ideal because some pirate firms &gt; copied the case
        too. &gt; &gt; Hope this helps: &gt; David J &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        When coming back from Toronto, I was cubing at an airport cafe while
        waiting for my connecting flight. I wasn't speedsolving, I was just
        solving. A waitress walked past and asked me if I thought that I'd ever
        be able to solve it. A question like this obviously calls for a demo --
        so I solved for her. She was very impressed and asked if I could do
        another demo for her friend. So I did. Then someone at the bar asked me
        about it, so I did another solve. :) Maybe I should've asked for a free
        coffee! :) Same thing happened on several of my flights back to Canberra
        (took 4 flights getting from Washington DC to Canberra!). The scenario
        each time was along the lines... (1) I would play with my cube (2)
        Observer (flight attendant or another passenger) doesn't realise that I
        am actually solving-scrambling-solving-scrambling over and over again,
        and so makes a comment (eg. have you ever solved that thing?) (3) I do a

        I had my luggage searched several airports because of my cubes. I guess
        they look potentially suspicious when x-rayed? And maybe because I had
        so many cubes? It was all okay though because once the security people
        opened up my bags and saw that the cubic objects were just Rubik's cubes
        they weren't too concerned. Actually, they usually laughed once they saw
        what they were. Did this happen to anyone else? Jasmine.

        would be appreciated. &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; &gt; Jess. &gt; &gt; I'm
        also very interested in learning blindfold so I began with a 2x2, &gt;
        but i cant find a good solution that's not too complicated. When I &gt;
        get more time though, I'd really like to learn that (especially if &gt;
        there is a straight forward way of doing it)

        Jasmine. On my way to Toronto I had two cubes on me when going through
        security (my shorts had big pockets). Since the thing beeped when i
        walked through, the guy had to sort of search me. Made me take out
        everything in my pockets...pulled out the cube in my right pocket, he
        didnt say much, took out some more stuff. Then took out the other cube,
        and he sort of laughed because i had two of them. He didnt say anything
        about it though... Going through security on my way home from the
        Toronto airport, i was holding my cube. When we made it to the guy in
        the desk who you have to sort of talk to a little bit, he asked me about
        the cube.. i told him i was just coming home from the WC. He made me
        solve it a couple times :D hehe cant wait till 2005 -heath

        Ya I thought that looked funny; since your all for correctness, instead
        of stiff hands, it should be Olly Hayden to pay tribute to the method. I
        use this BLD method too, not much success, I am basically limited by my
        short-term memorization but that can be worked on... I can do about half
        of waht is needed, half the time, lol. My long-term memory is pretty
        good though - mapped out, memorized, and actively using algs for over
        10% of all LL cases. (1212 of them but don't like that counting...
        &gt;6000 with inverses, mirror, and both) And increasing :)... will be
        saying good bye to my 9s LL average, ok probably not... recognition will
        be rough. Curious... anyone else currently pursuing such a tedious goal?
        I just saw a picture of DanG juggling 3 cubes (must of been outside) on
        Day 1 alongside Macky. I just have to say.... very, very cool. -Doug ---

        Yes, his website is no-longer being maintained... and it's off and on,

        (Sidenote: Sorry for all these straight posts, not DP since of different
        threads, but just taking a break from all my move-in craze today.)
        Nothing quite like that, but then again I drove and it was only to a
        neighbooring frendly country. But let me list some weird things that
        happened to me anyways: 1) Entering, customs: "Why are you coming to
        Canada?" Me: "Here for the International Rubik's ...(cut off)" Dad:
        "Uh...., to see Niagra Falls!" 2) Waited half-hour for Wesley at the
        airport with no luck, appearently his luggage got lost or something and
        came out 5 min after I gave up. Got to that hotel at the same time
        (reminds me: forgot to fill-out the service servey to highlight their
        extreamly crapy bar service). So I take out my cube so that we can
        better introduce ourselves... as strange as that sounds but probably
        typical here :). The guy behind the counter askes: "So there's a cube
        convention here, eh?" Me (proudly): "NO, International Rubik's Cube
        Championships." So I had to do the cube for them and got a 23.xx cold
        and after 7 hrs of driving. "And can you [David] do it too?" Me: "Oh,
        he's much faster then me..." (lol) David didn't even have to perform! 3)
        Clerk at OSC Giftshop: "Interested in buying a Rubik's Cube?" Me: "I
        already have a dozen of these..." She turns away. Me: "I didn't say I
        wasn't interested!" 4) Leaving, Customs: "I was here for the
        International Rubik's Cube Competition." After some good/sensible
        conversation about times and winners, no performance needed. Customs:
        "Ok you story sounds too outlandish to be a lie." Then he makes me dump
        all my beef products... appearently a madcow problem in Canada... and
        probably why we were able to get free BigMacs at MacD. So nobody thought
        I had cocaine stuffed up my cube... (which I DIDN'T!). There was
        actaully a cube ban in many US penitentiaries back in the 80s due to
        this ACTUALLY HAPPENING. -Doug --- In

        beginner method, an intermediate method and an advanced method. This
        &gt; is actually what I was after. Who else has something like this on
        &gt; their site? I'll describe the beginner and intermediate methods
        that I once used. They are simplications of the Fridrich last layer
        system. You need to first understand how that system works:
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html#last This general
        strategy, orienting first, then permuting, is good because it is very
        easy to recognise the positions quickly. But instead of orienting all
        the pieces at once, you just orient the edges first, and the corners
        second. BEGINNER METHOD First, orient the 4 edges (ie. make a cross).
        There are only 4 patterns, and one algorithm to solve them all! To view
        this, you need to use a fixed width font: --- --- -x- -x- -x- xxx xx-
        xxx --- --- --- -x- For each pattern, apply the algorithm "R'U'F'U F R"
        and it will take you to the next pattern. Eventually you will end up
        with a cross. Improvement: notice that if you apply the algorithm when
        you already have the cross, you will end up with a line. That means that
        you can jump immediately from the 2nd pattern to the 4th pattern by
        applying the algorithm backwards! So, this step should take an average
        of 6 moves. Next, orient the corners. There are only 6 patterns apart
        from solved. Look through this complete list, and find all the patterns
        (and algorithms) that have a cross already formed:
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/orient.html For the case when
        3 corners need to be twisted, I recommend the Sune TM algorithm from
        Petrus. See the applet at the top/right of his page:
        http://lar5.com/cube/fas6.html I think it's useful to learn to twist
        them forwards and backwards: - R U R'U R U2 R' - R'U'R U'R'U2 R To see
        that done fast, have a look at the quicktime movies at the bottom of
        this page: http://lar5.com/cube/speed.html I recommend this algorithm
        because one of the other orientation cases can be solved by just
        applying this algorithm twice. To know which case I'm talking about,
        apply this to a solved cube: RU2R'U'RUR'U'RU'R'. Now, apply the sune
        (RUR'URU2R') twice: RUR'URU2R' + RUR'URU2R' Notice that the moves in the
        middle cancel out? So you can actually do: RUR'URU'R'URU2R' which is an
        "optimal" solution. Next, permute the corners (yes, before the edges).
        Most of the time there will be a 3 cycle of corners. In this case, look
        at the 4 sides of the last layer. On one of the sides, the two last
        layer corners will be matching in colour. Hold those two corners on the
        back side and do: R'FR' B2 RF'R' B2 R2 Now the corners should be solved.
        If you don't find any two corners that match, apply the above algorithm
        and that should result in a position where two corners match. Don't
        worry, this case rarely happens. If you want, you can learn a special
        algorithm for that case by picking the most attractive one from:
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html The "Y" pattern
        on that page has the desired corner effect. Next, permute the edges.
        Again, most of the time, there will be a 3 cycle of edges. You need to
        learn to cycle the edges forwards and backwards: - R2U FB'R2F'BU R2 -
        R2U'FB'R2F'BU'R2 Sometimes, all 4 edges need to be swapped in opposite
        pairs. That's an easy case, so why not learn it: RLU2R'L' [U] R'L'U2RL
        The [U] means rotate the whole cube from the up side, 90 degrees.
        There's also a rare case where all 4 edges need to be swapped in
        adjacent pairs. The algorithm's difficult so it's not worth learning.
        INTERMEDIATE METHOD First, orient everything like the beginner method.
        Then permute everything like the full blown Fridrich method. How can you
        learn all the permutations? See my previous email:
        http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/4736 There,
        I list which algorithms to learn first, and which algorithms to learn
        last. ADVANCED METHOD You already know enough! It is not necessary to
        learn 40 orientation algorithms. 6 is enough. Gilles Roux proved that it
        is possible to achieve sub-20 times with just these 6 orientation
        algorithms and 13 permutation algorithms. He used the petrus method for
        the first two layers which gives you a cross automatically when you get
        to the last layer. Using that strategy, those extra orientation
        algorithms are not needed. Ryan

        http://homepage.ntlworld.com/angela.hayden/cube/cube_frontpage.html &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; But I'm not sure I understand what to do. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Does anyone know an easy to learn solution or is this the one? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Any help would be appreciated. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Thanks, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jess. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm also
        very interested in learning blindfold so I began with a &gt; &gt; 2x2,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; but i cant find a good solution that's not too
        complicated. &gt; When I &gt; &gt; &gt; get more time though, I'd really
        like to learn that (especially &gt; if &gt; &gt; &gt; there is a

        Hey, I got interested in blindfolded cubing maybe 2-3 weeks ago. I was
        confused by all of the different methods I had read, but finally worked
        out a system that works for me. As it stands I have solved several 2x2's
        blindfolded. No 3x3x3's yet. But last night, after taking a week of, I
        tried again. After about 20 minutes of memorization, and about 10
        minutes of solving, I opened my eyes and I was 2 moves away! I was so
        excited and so depressed at the same time :) At any rate, my system is
        based largely on the PDF file from Richard Carr, but I'd be happy to
        post it if anyone would like. Daniel

        No problem. I first orient and then premute, it's easyer to remember
        them like that. But don't forget when you permute to bring the corners
        and the edges to the last layer with moves that doesn't change the
        orientation of the pieces, I.E. for the corners do moves within the
        U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2 group and for the edges do moves within the
        U,D,F,B,R2,L2 group. then you do a three-cycle in the last layer and
        bring the pieces back by reverse the moves you needed to bring them up.
        you can give me an example of a scrambled cub and I will show you how
        the steps goes. Dror vomberg --- In

        hi The WC was great! Thank God we also got to see a little bit of Canada
        too. We just arrived. Thanks everyone for a great time, and thanks DanG
        for making this possible.. How are we doing? I am bound to put my cube
        away a while to rest my arms (ouch) and to concentrate on other things
        in life... I am satisfied with my results, I had 6 runs and five of them
        were below my average. That must have been the lube doing that. I wasn't
        nervous at all. Last week Yasmara has set her personal record almost
        every day. That makes me envious, man! Times have developed as follows 8
        days prior: first picked up a cube 7 days prior: able to do two layers 6
        days prior: able to do LL orientation 5 days prior: able to do LL
        permutation 8 minutes (4 days prior) 6 minutes (3 days prior) 4 minutesa
        (2 days prior) 3.56 (at WC), 3.06, day later 2.42, day later 1.52, two
        days later So in two weeks anyone can do this. Maybe I will put up a
        beginners page to show you how you can do this. I have tried the method
        a couple of times for speed, and have gotten 30 seconds. When I choose
        not to use finger triggers and shortcuts, I can get to 1:30. In short,
        this is the method: 1. first layer - create cross, no algs 2. first
        layer - corners, no algs 3. second layer - (RD)2 R (D'R')2 4. third
        layer - edges orientation: RBUB'U'R' 5. third layer - corners
        permutation: RUL'U'R'U'L 6. third layer - corners orientation:
        RUR'URU2R' 7. third layer - edge permutation : same as 6, using it
        multiple times, combined with its mirror (try it!) I'll keep you all
        posted. Michiel

        center caps be glued on! So it will not be very hard to get to the
        screws and prepare and tune the cubes! The price will be about $10 per
        cube, shipment is $7,50 world wide, for 2 to or more it will be $15-$20.
        As soon as I can give some details I will offer them to you all. I would
        like to express that the Rubiks.com cube is a fine cube if you do not

        solved it. Then &gt; he said if I &gt; &gt; did it again I would get
        FREE Cinnasticks. Of course I solved it &gt; in around 19 &gt; &gt;
        seconds and got the the free food! I've done this before on &gt; cruises
        at the &gt; &gt; snack bar and made bets for free sodas and snacks if I
        solved it &gt; in under 25 &gt; &gt; seconds. Every time I won. Try it
        sometime, because I'm sure &gt; they'll be &gt; &gt; amazed. &gt; &gt;

        Hey all, An addendum to my last post on the subject. My brain had ample
        time to cool since last night and I made another attempt. This one was
        successful! My first blindfolded 3x3x3 cube! Took about 20 minutes
        memorize and 10 solution. But the memorization didn't seem as tedious
        this time. I'm very very excited :) Good luck to everyone! Daniel

        I got a few free meals back in the 80s, but my best story happened a few
        months back. My future wife met some teenage girls trying to solve a
        cube while waiting for me in a coffee shop in Gilroy. I arrived and did
        some speed solves. To break the stunned silence I mentioned that it was
        an unusually good cube. I don't know if the owner thought that meant I
        wanted it, that she wished it to have a good home, or if she just gave
        up after seeing me, but to my astonishment she insisted on giving me the
        cube after that!! And I think that was the cube I used for 3x3x3 speed
        in Toronto! For the one handed I used an other gift cube that David
        Wesley gave me after having felt the relative unsmoothness of my
        competition cube. It was too smooth for my brutal two handed style, but
        perfect for one hand. And I got 4 seconds from beating him with it!
        Thanx David! As so often, I sense there is probably some moral to these
        stories, but I can't quite make out what it is. This was just one of
        several recent cube sightings. I think I've seen more cubes this year
        among civilians than during the entire 90s. -- "Before you criticize

        Several people asked me in Toronto for videos of me solving the cube. I
        have two that should be publicly accessible from this URL, if I have

        One is 14.87 seconds, which is fun due to the speed of course, but the
        18.51 one is far more typical and is filmed from a better angle. It also
        has the URL for my perhaps marginally obsessive frame by frame and turn
        by turn recap of these solutions. If I do any more videos, I'll put in
        one (or more) mirrors so you can see the entire cube. They're about 4MB

        I agree that I think it is certainly "easier" to get fast now than it
        was in the early 80's, thanks to the internet and computer generated
        algorithms. But keep in mind that the cube was much, much more popular
        then and there were a lot more competitions going on. So while there was
        less "information", there were a lot more motivated people working on
        the cube. A number of this year's finalists were people that were for
        the most part doing the same methods they were using 20 years ago. From
        comments I've heard attributed to Jessica and David Allen, they were
        both "faster" 20 years ago, but they've made slight improvements to
        their methods over time so net times are still fairly close. So if
        Jessica is about as fast as she was in '82 (or maybe a little slower)
        and she was middle of the pack in '82 and she was 2nd this year, what
        happened? Was it luck, a different format, using your own cube, or

        Don't take the placements of the 82 competition too seriously. Any of
        10-12 people could have won, and it was mostly based on luck who
        happened to get a good result during their three attempts. I expect that
        I would have ended up worse than my 4th place in a serious competition.
        But we'll never know that. I was used to bad cubes and only lost 2-4
        seconds due to them, but people with different techniques must have lost
        a lot more, as would people used to a different color scheme. An other
        major difference was that only the national champions of 19 countries
        were invited, leaving at least hundreds of cubers who would have had a
        chance of winning out of the running. Yeah, kids today definitely have
        it easier, and no doubt use better systems that they didn't have to
        spend nearly as much time inventing. I guess that means that the most
        talented people would achieve better times today. Then again most of
        those most talented kids probably has never seen or heard of a cube
        today. I have no doubt that if this takes off as a serious professional
        sport, all our current records will be blown away, Tiger Woods style, by
        some amazingly skilled and well trained people. To answer the original
        question, I'll have to say I think the 2003 level was higher than 1982,
        mostly due to the one competitor per country rule. Just try to imagine
        how empty and dull it would have made this year. Or compare the 19th
        placed result in 2003 (22.60) with the one in 1982 (54.69). BTW, you
        should have seen the cubes for the Swedish 1981 competition. I won that
        one in over 40 seconds!! /Lars At 16:46 +0000 9/2/03, George wrote:

        i'm using a solution close to dan k's intermediate solution. on the last
        level i have quite a high probability that one of my 4 steps will be
        already solved orient edges 1/8 is solved position corner 1/6 is solved
        orient corner 1/27 permute edges 1/12 and the it's the F2L where i quite
        often end up with one of the corner / edge pairs are already solved ..
        not sure of the probability there but at least 1/30 i think. So in fact
        the probability of skipping at least one step is like one in four. It's
        getting quite hard to do a 12 solve average then without bumping into a
        few lucky cases. I understand that when you use only 2 steps in the last
        layer, skipping one of them will feel like a very lucky case, and that
        those cases should not be counted, but not in my case. Just my 2 cents.

        Yes, there were millions and millions of cubists in the early 80¬¥s, but
        only 19 of them got to the final. And that sometimes under dubious
        selections. Most of the participants had cubed only one or two years.
        Had they waited only one year with the WC (and the participants with
        there own cubes!), the results would have been far better. R -----

        competition I agree that I think it is certainly "easier" to get fast
        now than it was in the early 80's, thanks to the internet and computer
        generated algorithms. But keep in mind that the cube was much, much more
        popular then and there were a lot more competitions going on. So while
        there was less "information", there were a lot more motivated people
        working on the cube. A number of this year's finalists were people that
        were for the most part doing the same methods they were using 20 years
        ago. From comments I've heard attributed to Jessica and David Allen,
        they were both "faster" 20 years ago, but they've made slight
        improvements to their methods over time so net times are still fairly
        close. So if Jessica is about as fast as she was in '82 (or maybe a
        little slower) and she was middle of the pack in '82 and she was 2nd
        this year, what happened? Was it luck, a different format, using your

        Also, in the 80 there was just the Rubik's cube, what is now called the
        3x3x3. Pocket cube, Revenge and the Professor's cube were unavsailable
        then. So were the other puzzles, Magnaminx, Pyraminx, etc. In the 2003
        WC prizes were won in those puzzles. I introduced 3d cube art. In the

        I think that cubers are much faster today than in June of 1982. It is
        because of all the sharing done via the Internet and the computer-
        generated algorithms. Back in 1982 there was no communication among the
        constestants prior to the championship. As a result, there was much
        bigger diversity in methods and cubing styles. Today, people share all
        kinds of details, improve existing systems, help each other to get
        faster. That was not the case in 1982. Also, it is a lot smaller
        psychological barrier to improve from average 19 to 17 IF you know that
        there are 20 other people who did it before you. You pretty much know
        that if you put in sufficient number of energy and concentration, you
        are likely to get there. To get to 15.4, of course, is another thing -
        that takes an immense talent and a HUGE amount of sweat. In 2003 WC
        there was much more actual cubing than in 1982. The conditions were much
        more fair than in 1982 - in 2003 we could have our own cubes and anybody
        could come and compete. In 1982, the stage was far more intimidating
        than in 2003. It was bigger, you were the only one there and the
        audience was bigger. Also, because the cube was at its peak popularity,
        stakes were kind of higher. So, if you were nervous in 2003, you can
        imagine the pressure in 1982 ... :) More below ... &gt; A number of this
        year's finalists were &gt; people that were for the most part doing the
        same methods they were &gt; &gt;using 20 years ago. From comments I've
        heard attributed to Jessica &gt; &gt;and David Allen, they were both
        "faster" 20 years ago, but they've &gt; &gt;made slight improvements to
        their methods over time so net times are &gt; &gt;still fairly close. So
        if Jessica is about as fast as she was in '82 &gt; &gt;(or maybe a
        little slower) and she was middle of the pack in '82 and &gt; &gt;she
        was 2nd this year, what happened? Was it luck, a different &gt;
        &gt;format, using your own cube, or slower competition? Well, first of
        all, I am now MUCH faster than I was in 1982. In 1982 I was averaging
        about 23 seconds. In June 1982, I have owned the cube for a mere 10
        months! I was at my peak in 1983 and I have not really changed my method
        since then. So, the different placement then and this year does not mean
        anything ;) It would be very interesting to know how fast the
        contestants were (average) in 1982. Does anyone have this info? I think
        somebody was taking statistics at the championship regarding the methods
        and our performance. I remember that the corners-first method was more
        frequent among contestants in 1982 than the by-layer approach. Jessica

        group] Re: 2003 vs. 1982 WC level of competition I think that cubers are
        much faster today than in June of 1982. It is because of all the sharing
        done via the Internet and the computer- generated algorithms. Back in
        1982 there was no communication among the constestants prior to the
        championship. As a result, there was much bigger diversity in methods
        and cubing styles. Today, people share all kinds of details, improve
        existing systems, help each other to get faster. That was not the case
        in 1982. Also, it is a lot smaller psychological barrier to improve from
        average 19 to 17 IF you know that there are 20 other people who did it
        before you. You pretty much know that if you put in sufficient number of
        energy and concentration, you are likely to get there. To get to 15.4,
        of course, is another thing - that takes an immense talent and a HUGE
        amount of sweat. In 2003 WC there was much more actual cubing than in
        1982. The conditions were much more fair than in 1982 - in 2003 we could
        have our own cubes and anybody could come and compete. In 1982, the
        stage was far more intimidating than in 2003. It was bigger, you were
        the only one there and the audience was bigger. Also, because the cube
        was at its peak popularity, stakes were kind of higher. So, if you were
        nervous in 2003, you can imagine the pressure in 1982 ... :) More below
        ... &gt; A number of this year's finalists were &gt; people that were
        for the most part doing the same methods they were &gt; &gt;using 20
        years ago. From comments I've heard attributed to Jessica &gt; &gt;and
        David Allen, they were both "faster" 20 years ago, but they've &gt;
        &gt;made slight improvements to their methods over time so net times are
        &gt; &gt;still fairly close. So if Jessica is about as fast as she was
        in '82 &gt; &gt;(or maybe a little slower) and she was middle of the
        pack in '82 and &gt; &gt;she was 2nd this year, what happened? Was it
        luck, a different &gt; &gt;format, using your own cube, or slower
        competition? Well, first of all, I am now MUCH faster than I was in
        1982. In 1982 I was averaging about 23 seconds. In June 1982, I have
        owned the cube for a mere 10 months! I was at my peak in 1983 and I have
        not really changed my method since then. So, the different placement
        then and this year does not mean anything ;) It would be very
        interesting to know how fast the contestants were (average) in 1982.
        Does anyone have this info? I think somebody was taking statistics at
        the championship regarding the methods and our performance. I remember
        that the corners-first method was more frequent among contestants in
        1982 than the by-layer approach. Jessica Yahoo! Groups Sponsor

        Oh, I was not asking about the averages at the competition. Those do not
        tell much not only because of the stiffer cubes but mostly due to the
        color scheme. The only information I have is from the 1982 WC brochure
        (of course, the times from national champs could be ooold for some
        competitors depending on when the champs took place. But even this info
        tells you about the level of the 1982 champs compared with 2003):
        Trajber (Austria): Best time 29 Luc van Laethem (Bel): Best 17, won the
        Belgium champs with 34 Svilen Tenev (Bulgaria): Best 40 Duc Trinh (Can):

        well, people tend to not like to hear this, but the plain and simple
        truth is that a lot of it is simply born talent. your genetics have a
        lot to do with how easily you can get to sub-20. some people's brains
        have high spacial IQ, some people have lower spacial IQ. some people
        have tremendous natural finger dexterity, others do not. you cannot
        teach yourself to increase your spacial IQ because it is something you
        are born with. however, you can increase your finger dexterity, but the
        *rate* at which your dexterity increases with practice is something that
        you are born with. some people learn motor skills quickly, others not so
        quickly. that doesn't mean that if your spacial IQ is average that you
        can't be a fast cuber. but you'll have to practice a lot more than
        someone with a high spacial IQ. spacial IQ is most involved with
        planning the formation of the cross and then following the pieces around
        during f2l. and then the LL is less affected by spacial IQ and more
        affected by finger dexterity. there is a cool free IQ test at
        http://www.emode.com/tests/uiq that is actually pretty accurate. you'll
        find that some of the questions are easy and some are pretty hard. and
        it has a subsection for spacial-visual IQ. you get your total IQ score
        for free, but if you want to read the subsection reports, then you have
        to pay a small fee. people who get sub-20 cube times within a year of
        picking up the cube probably have a spacial-visual IQ in the top 5
        percentile. i took this test and scored an IQ of 142, and i'd suspect
        most people on this board probably have similar IQ scores. --- In

        I've seen that test before, and I think that it's fairly inaccurate. It

        &gt; just wondering, how do you guyz get so fast? Okay, since you
        mentioned me, I'll respond :P Really, for the megaminx, it was a ton of
        practice, and working out my own, new algs. The first time I solved a
        megaminx, it took about 40 minutes. After I had a solution down, it was
        still taking me 7-8 minutes at best. To further improve, I played with
        different approaches to find out what worked best for me. After a long
        time working on it, though, my puzzle moves better than most, and I've
        gotten very used to what color is where on the puzzle. Lately, even
        though I haven't been practicing the megaminx much, I continue to
        improve gradually as my general cubing improves. I have one further goal
        in learning on the megaminx, and that is to orient last layer corners in
        1 look. Then, I'll just keep practicing, and hope that I'm still in the
        running when the next WC comes around.

        I have talked to the finacial Director of the Rubik's Studio and he
        ensured me that they resolved all problems and made some improvements.
        The poor quality was caused because they decided to move production to
        Rusia. But now is everything back to the old style production. I have to
        test the new style cubes, before I can make any quality statements. But
        I think that it will be as good as the old style cubes and maybe even

        I &gt; have &gt; &gt; some great news. Rubik's Studio is willing to sell

        cube will be produce without &gt; the &gt; &gt; center caps be glued on!
        So it will not be very hard to get to the &gt; &gt; screws and prepare
        and tune the cubes! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The price will be about $10 per
        cube, shipment is $7,50 world &gt; wide, &gt; &gt; for 2 to or more it
        will be $15-$20. As soon as I can give some &gt; &gt; details I will
        offer them to you all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to express that
        the Rubiks.com cube is a fine cube if &gt; &gt; you do not need any
        special tuning. For the Rubik's Studio cubes &gt; it &gt; &gt; is
        recommended that you always adjust the screws to your liking. &gt; &gt;

        Hey Everyone... Here is my long awaited message concerning the WC. I'm
        sure a lot of you have been wondering about me... hehe.. I had a blast
        in Toronto!! Unfortunately I had to leave the city and head back home,
        thus taking me away from a ton of new friends. Shoot, 15 people make a
        ton.... make that "tons". I walked away with a totally new outlook on
        the cube, thanks to so many conversations with people who have their own
        unique perspectives on the cube. A lot of people have talked about how
        well we got along and that we all bonded so easily. That has to be due
        to the fact that the cube has just made us happy people. A happiness
        which has come to each of us through those individuals that we have in
        turn made happy. Over the past year or more, we have all cubed for
        strangers, crowds, family, students, and coworkers so much that we have
        made hundreds of people smile, laugh, and just plain excited over
        something that everyone has a strong, if not, passion for. The elusive
        cube, which no one can solve. Sure, I used to peel the stickers off,
        (too bad I didn't know that it actually would not break if I forced it
        apart), but about 99.99% of the general public pretty much "freak out"
        when we solve the cube for them. So, for me, I kept thinking of that
        when I met each one of you... I didn't speak much of it, though. I
        always wanted to see a fast solve "in person" right before my eyes...
        But in all actuality, it was not too much more impressive than a video
        file online. The speed is surely something to behold, but no more
        clarity or ease of viewing is available in a real life setting. This was
        somewhat disappointing, since it was my original reason for becoming
        excited about the WC. Chris Hardwick's solving video was amazing to me
        over 2 years ago... But Chris less than 2 weeks ago, was the same blurry
        mess of fingers and plastic. I guess I can't complain too much about
        that. For it was awe inspiring nonetheless. Another thing for me was
        that I didn't recognize a lot of people's names when I met them, due to
        my extended absence from this club and all other online sites. So, I had
        no biased opinions about anyone that did not fall into the "famous"
        category. For instance, Frank Morris and Dan Harris were just ordinary
        people with cubes in their hands when I met them. I could tell that they
        were solving much faster than me indeed. It was only that night when I
        got online did I see the extent to which I underestimated their
        potential. The reason I even say this here is because it shows how easy
        it was for me and perhaps a lot of us to just becomes friends first. I
        never said, "Wow, Frank, it's nice to meet you!! Dude, how'd you get so
        fast??!!!". It was more of a "Hey, wasssup?!!?" Anyways, that was my
        ramblings.... I will have my hundreds of photos sorted and online
        ASAP... I'm too busy scrapping my old system and relearning all my
        algs... there's not enuf days until wc2005. You are all great, amazing
        people, Jason Hildebrand

        Hey all, I just finished up writing a program for the TI-89. It's a cube
        timer that takes a rolling average of 12 solves, displays best, and
        worst solves, as well as an average. It has the capability to keep track
        of a pop, and it provides a 20 -25 move random scrambling algorithm. It
        is set at 10 second countdown, but unfortunately I haven't incorporated
        dynamic changing of this value yet. The program is as it stands
        functional, if not polished. If anyone else is interested, let me know
        and I'll finish to publishing standards and post it here! (It's TI basic
        so you guys can chop it up all you want.) Gotta do something while
        waiting for class to start. Daniel

        Ya, I use a 3 look LL and know 13 oirentations so the probability of
        orienting the LL in one step is greater than 1/8 and for a couple of F2L
        cases, There's a 50% chance I can oreint the LL edges at the same time
        which makes the probability even higher. It would be hard for me
        calculate it exactly but it doesn't seem too lucky any more and I don't
        think I've ever done an average where I used 3 LL algs for every solve.

        &gt; orient edges 1/8 is solved &gt; position corner 1/6 is solved &gt;
        orient corner 1/27 &gt; permute edges 1/12 &gt; &gt; and the it's the
        F2L where i quite often end up with one of the corner / &gt; edge pairs
        are already solved .. not sure of the probability there but at &gt;
        least 1/30 i think. &gt; &gt; So in fact the probability of skipping at
        least one step is like one in &gt; four. &gt; &gt; It's getting quite
        hard to do a 12 solve average then without bumping into &gt; a few lucky
        cases. &gt; &gt; I understand that when you use only 2 steps in the last
        layer, skipping one &gt; of them will feel like a very lucky case, and
        that those cases should not &gt; be counted, but not in my case. &gt;

        Recently I've been thinking...how fast is it acctually possible to solve
        any of these puzzles? Right now, Jessica has the unofficial record at 11
        seconds, so 10 seconds shouldn't seem completely outside the relm of
        posibility, yet 5 seconds is. When people find out that I have solved
        the pyraminx in 3.98 seconds, most cannot comprehend that being
        possible, but 7 seconds is not unheard of. Why not go just one second
        faster? Where is the cutoff? Is it possible that there truly are no
        limits? Just my thoughts...anyone else think the same or different?

        Hi, what are the best stickers on the market and how much do they cost?
        When I unpacked my 243 cubes (out of the 345) I noticed thatI have about
        40 cubes with this awful glittering color schewme. I wpuld like to get
        rid of that horror and replace the stickers with convwntional ones, as

        Well, in Nature speed of light is the limit and nothing goes beyond it.
        As fr as those mechanical puzzles are concerned, ity depends on the
        puzzle and the puzzler. The puzzle should be conditioned to move fast,
        and the puzzler should be operating it fast. If those two criteria are
        satisfied, you can get fantasatic rewsuylts. If not, consider switching

        For the one handed stuff I have to agree with Grant in that it was, for
        me at least, just lots and lots and lots of practice. I started by just
        trying to find more efficient ways to do the normal moves, clockwise and
        counter clockwise on each face. Then after I felt comfortable with that
        I came up with the "finger tricks" that I mentioned in my last post by
        simply trying to do moves with my fingers instead of always alternating
        finger/thumb/finger/thumb. By practicing a lot I also noticed that my
        times got faster simply because my hand was getting stronger. Also by
        practicing a lot, hence making your hand a little stronger, it becomes
        easier to do even more kinds of "finger tricks". Then the next step was
        to practice each OLL and PLL to find the fastest ways to do each one
        with only the use of one hand. That also helped to make sure I would get
        "amnesia" less often, a nuisance which still comes up (I got one handed
        amnesia for the OLL of my second solve at the WC). I guess I decided to
        put a lot of time into it after breaking Matt Wilder's time of 48
        seconds. I remember thinking that it would be almost impossible to get
        that fast, then after practicing off and on for a while I finally got
        it! I couldn't believe that I was able to do it, and each time I set a
        new record I always noticed something else that I could improve on. That
        started the whole snowball effect for my times. I don't think it's so
        much a question of inherent dexterity and visual spacial skill, at least
        for one handed, but more a question of just lots and lots of practice to
        improve your dexterity and your hand strength. That's just my two cents.
        I know its the piece of advice that no one likes to hear, but at least
        for one handed it is all about lots of practice. Chris --- In

        It was the same for me. My first one handed time was around eight
        minutes, when I was just joking around. I didn't actually plan on
        getting good at it. I think that being fast at the cube has a lot to do
        with brains, but if you're a genius but don't have good dexterity, you
        won't ever be tremendously good. And vice versa. BTW, Chris, about the
        finger tricks you talked about in your last post. I found out that when
        I'm actually going quickly one handed, my hands are never in the right
        position to use that. They're never in the right position to use any
        finger other than my thumb or first finger. It's probably just a habit I
        picked up as I learned to go fast. Did you encounter this? --- In

        handed, but more a question &gt; of just lots and lots of practice to
        improve your dexterity and your &gt; hand strength. &gt; &gt; That's
        just my two cents. I know its the piece of advice that no &gt; one likes
        to hear, but at least for one handed it is all about lots &gt; of
        practice. &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, I've been cubing for a while, and I know how

        seconds &gt; with 4x4x4, It is _Just _Insane_. I cannot even imagine
        myself &gt; averaging 7-8 minutes with the 5x5x5, and here Wesly is

        (Grant for &gt; one..). I am just wondering, how do you guyz get so

        Well, earlier Ian Winokur asked me for a copy, so I finished making sure
        everything works and made it nice and neat and so forth. It's still my
        first prog in a long while though. So be kind. As for the 86, I honestly
        have no experience with it, and I don't have access to one. I would be
        very pleased if you guys found a way to port it over there though! I'll
        post the final (for now) version in the files section under 89timer.zip
        As for in class cubing? Well, MWF I have 3-1 hour blocks between
        classes, perfect for cubing (or writing a cube program on your calc, or
        reading Douglas Adams' Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul, etc.) Besides, I
        think the teacher would notice... Hehehe, Disclaimer, you get in trouble

        Hi All, Sorry for my long absence. WC was the last event of my American
        life. I had to move to Japan. So it took time to set up everything. I am
        getting started new life. Now I can't keep hiding anymore. Thanks to
        DanG and everyone else! It was really wondeful meeting not just because
        I could win. Everybody seemed my old friend eventhough this was our
        first meeting. I really enjoyed watching everybody solving cube and
        sharing time. I regret I could not take a lot of pictures because my
        digital camera has broken. But how nice! I can see the pictures several
        people posted on their web sites. Thanks to those who post their
        pictures. Even 2 years later, I will be still as old as Jessica, David
        A, and Gene are. I am going to try to get much faster, and really wish
        to get together with you guys again. Hope to meet again in WC2005

        &gt;well, people tend to not like to hear this, but the plain and simple
        &gt;truth is that a lot of it is simply born talent. One reason I don't
        like hearing this is because taken alone it is open to
        misinterpretation. Without certain qualifiers (you add them) people take
        on a fatalist approach towards their potential, which is very
        frustrating. As you say, it more reflects on how easy it is to do
        something, not whether you can do it at all. Of course this does not
        apply to the extremes of the scale: the very low and very high IQs.
        &gt;your genetics have &gt;a lot to do with how easily you can get to
        sub-20. Sure, but for most of us I wonder how much our IQ is influenced
        by our environment in the first few years of our lives? Heaps, I
        suspect. Of course, this factor is also pretty much beyond our control,
        as it all happens before we hit about 12 years of age. &gt;that doesn't
        mean that if your spacial IQ is average that you can't &gt;be a fast
        cuber. A crucial point. &gt;there is a cool free IQ test at
        http://www.emode.com/tests/uiq that &gt;is actually pretty accurate.
        Accurate compared to what? I don't regard this test as highly as your
        post suggests, I'm afraid. &gt;i'd suspect most people &gt;on this board
        probably have similar IQ scores. A while ago a load of us did some
        online IQ test: I recall the average was around the 150/160 mark. Best,

        plus shipping. Also, these are supposed to be the good stickers (like
        they had available at the competition), but you may want to check before
        sinking any money into them. I suppose for your purposes, it's probably
        not as big of a deal, though, since you're not solving each cube
        dozens-100's of times per day like us crazy speed-cubists, so the
        stickers shouldn't wear off on you. - Grant

        And speedcubing with the feet most probably requires the same thing as
        doing it with one hand: you have to practice a lot... I solved the cube
        with my feet the first time some 20 years or so ago when I got tired of
        doing it two-handed, with one hand, with the other hand... As I
        remember, I did it only once or twice at that time, and I didn't
        measured the time it took. When Andrea Craig of Strategic Objectives
        contacted Rune and me for promotions of the WC, she asked about my cube
        peculiarities, I happened to mention that I had done it with my feet.
        And she could not resist to persuade me to do it live on the CityTV
        Breakfast Television show on the Friday morning. And the rest is
        history... Before I agreed to do it on TV, I had to try it again and
        this time it took 1/2 h or more, since you easily get lost in the
        sequences. When I got the idea how to work it out, it took less than 15
        minutes. When foot-cubing at the WC Banquet
        &lt;http://lars.studentenweb.org/cube/wc2003/banquet.html#pic7&gt; I
        solved the cube in more than 12 minutes, after embarrassing myself for
        some minute during the placement of the last edges. I have only solved
        the cube with my feet 10 time or so. With just a little more practice I
        should be able to do it securely within 10 minutes. With some serious
        practice, it should be no problem to beat 5 minutes. See you at WC2005
        ;-) /Anders unipsycho6 wrote: &gt; It was the same for me. My first one
        handed time was around eight &gt; minutes, when I was just joking
        around. I didn't actually plan on &gt; getting good at it. &gt; &gt; I
        think that being fast at the cube has a lot to do with brains, but &gt;
        if you're a genius but don't have good dexterity, you won't ever be &gt;
        tremendously good. And vice versa. &gt; &gt; BTW, Chris, about the
        finger tricks you talked about in your last &gt; post. I found out that
        when I'm actually going quickly one handed, &gt; my hands are never in
        the right position to use that. They're never &gt; in the right position
        to use any finger other than my thumb or first &gt; finger. It's
        probably just a habit I picked up as I learned to go &gt; fast. Did you
        encounter this? &gt; &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        stuff I have to agree with Grant in that it &gt; was, &gt; &gt; for me
        at least, just lots and lots and lots of practice. I &gt; started &gt;
        &gt; by just trying to find more efficient ways to do the normal moves,
        &gt; &gt; clockwise and counter clockwise on each face. Then after I
        felt &gt; &gt; comfortable with that I came up with the "finger tricks"
        that I &gt; &gt; mentioned in my last post by simply trying to do moves
        with my &gt; &gt; fingers instead of always alternating
        finger/thumb/finger/thumb. &gt; By &gt; &gt; practicing a lot I also
        noticed that my times got faster simply &gt; &gt; because my hand was
        getting stronger. Also by practicing a lot, &gt; &gt; hence making your
        hand a little stronger, it becomes easier to do &gt; &gt; even more
        kinds of "finger tricks". Then the next step was to &gt; &gt; practice
        each OLL and PLL to find the fastest ways to do each one &gt; &gt; with
        only the use of one hand. That also helped to make sure I &gt; &gt;
        would get "amnesia" less often, a nuisance which still comes up (I &gt;
        &gt; got one handed amnesia for the OLL of my second solve at the WC).
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; guess I decided to put a lot of time into it after
        breaking Matt &gt; &gt; Wilder's time of 48 seconds. I remember thinking
        that it would be &gt; &gt; almost impossible to get that fast, then
        after practicing off and &gt; on &gt; &gt; for a while I finally got it!
        I couldn't believe that I was able &gt; to &gt; &gt; do it, and each
        time I set a new record I always noticed something &gt; &gt; else that I
        could improve on. That started the whole snowball &gt; &gt; effect for
        my times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think it's so much a question of
        inherent dexterity and &gt; &gt; visual spacial skill, at least for one
        handed, but more a question &gt; &gt; of just lots and lots of practice
        to improve your dexterity and &gt; your &gt; &gt; hand strength. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; That's just my two cents. I know its the piece of advice
        that no &gt; &gt; one likes to hear, but at least for one handed it is
        all about &gt; lots &gt; &gt; of practice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris

        A lot of us here are designing our own methods or improving on existing
        ones. That obviously requires intelligence. But I don't know that it's
        particularly important for learning a well defined existing method. I'd
        guess anyone with good dexterity and memory, and above all time and
        interest to put in a few thousand hours of practice, can be a good speed
        cuber. Note that computers, which are completely unintelligent, can
        solve the cube better and faster than any human. -- "The mind is like a

        Hi Dan! The after-effect og the time-leg has gone... I had hoped to have
        some words with you at the WC, but scrambling cubes, talking to Jessica
        and other stars you seemed untouchable for ordinary mortals. I have
        nothing to add to what already has been said, everything was splendid.
        Even the delay on Saturday I took as a relief; I got tired looking at
        all those speed-cubers and hoped to start in good form on Sunday. Alas,
        I had intensively been training with a "podium" four feet high, but when
        it all came around it was only three feet. I¬¥m joking, Dan. For bad
        times I can only blame bad nerves and slow fingers and brain. A poor
        consolation is the fact that even a man as Jess Bonde in a fit of
        nervousness could have a time about 50 secs. (By no means, I¬¥m not
        comparing myself with him!) An unpleasant surprise was that the cube was
        covered after inspection. With my short memory I forgot the orientation
        and got still more frustrated. Maybe I should mention one thing. In the
        smoker-room, that is outdoors, on Sunday evening, a couple of hours
        before the Big battle indoors I saw a Japaneese showing his
        fingertricks. THAT was fantastic to me. Can that man really be much
        slower than David Allen? Anyhow, his name ought to be known. Well, Dan,
        thank you for two unforgettable days! Rune

        I sort of sometimes practice with my feet. My record now is about 6
        minutes, which is sort of good. There were more people who could cube
        with their feet than I expected at the WC. --- In

        most probably requires the same thing as &gt; doing it with one hand:
        you have to practice a lot... &gt; &gt; I solved the cube with my feet
        the first time some 20 years or so ago &gt; when I got tired of doing it
        two-handed, with one hand, with the other &gt; hand... As I remember, I
        did it only once or twice at that time, and I &gt; didn't measured the
        time it took. When Andrea Craig of Strategic &gt; Objectives contacted
        Rune and me for promotions of the WC, she asked &gt; about my cube
        peculiarities, I happened to mention that I had done it &gt; with my
        feet. And she could not resist to persuade me to do it live on &gt; the
        CityTV Breakfast Television show on the Friday morning. And the rest
        &gt; is history... Before I agreed to do it on TV, I had to try it again
        and &gt; this time it took 1/2 h or more, since you easily get lost in
        the &gt; sequences. When I got the idea how to work it out, it took less
        than 15 &gt; minutes. &gt; &gt; When foot-cubing at the WC Banquet &gt;
        &lt;http://lars.studentenweb.org/cube/wc2003/banquet.html#pic7&gt; I
        solved &gt; the cube in more than 12 minutes, after embarrassing myself
        for some &gt; minute during the placement of the last edges. I have only
        solved the &gt; cube with my feet 10 time or so. With just a little more
        practice I &gt; should be able to do it securely within 10 minutes. With
        some serious &gt; practice, it should be no problem to beat 5 minutes.
        See you at WC2005 ;-) &gt; &gt; /Anders &gt; &gt; unipsycho6 wrote: &gt;
        &gt; &gt; It was the same for me. My first one handed time was around

        actually plan on &gt; &gt; getting good at it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        think that being fast at the cube has a lot to do with brains, but &gt;
        &gt; if you're a genius but don't have good dexterity, you won't ever be
        &gt; &gt; tremendously good. And vice versa. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW,
        Chris, about the finger tricks you talked about in your last &gt; &gt;
        post. I found out that when I'm actually going quickly one handed, &gt;
        &gt; my hands are never in the right position to use that. They're never
        &gt; &gt; in the right position to use any finger other than my thumb or
        first &gt; &gt; finger. It's probably just a habit I picked up as I
        learned to go &gt; &gt; fast. Did you encounter this? &gt; &gt; &gt;

        have to agree with Grant in that it &gt; &gt; was, &gt; &gt; &gt; for me
        at least, just lots and lots and lots of practice. I &gt; &gt; started
        &gt; &gt; &gt; by just trying to find more efficient ways to do the
        normal moves, &gt; &gt; &gt; clockwise and counter clockwise on each
        face. Then after I felt &gt; &gt; &gt; comfortable with that I came up
        with the "finger tricks" that I &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in my last post
        by simply trying to do moves with my &gt; &gt; &gt; fingers instead of
        always alternating finger/thumb/finger/thumb. &gt; &gt; By &gt; &gt;
        &gt; practicing a lot I also noticed that my times got faster simply
        &gt; &gt; &gt; because my hand was getting stronger. Also by practicing
        a lot, &gt; &gt; &gt; hence making your hand a little stronger, it
        becomes easier to do &gt; &gt; &gt; even more kinds of "finger tricks".
        Then the next step was to &gt; &gt; &gt; practice each OLL and PLL to
        find the fastest ways to do each one &gt; &gt; &gt; with only the use of
        one hand. That also helped to make sure I &gt; &gt; &gt; would get
        "amnesia" less often, a nuisance which still comes up (I &gt; &gt; &gt;
        got one handed amnesia for the OLL of my second solve at the WC). &gt;
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; guess I decided to put a lot of time into it after
        breaking Matt &gt; &gt; &gt; Wilder's time of 48 seconds. I remember
        thinking that it would be &gt; &gt; &gt; almost impossible to get that
        fast, then after practicing off and &gt; &gt; on &gt; &gt; &gt; for a
        while I finally got it! I couldn't believe that I was able &gt; &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; &gt; do it, and each time I set a new record I always noticed
        something &gt; &gt; &gt; else that I could improve on. That started the
        whole snowball &gt; &gt; &gt; effect for my times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I don't think it's so much a question of inherent dexterity
        and &gt; &gt; &gt; visual spacial skill, at least for one handed, but
        more a question &gt; &gt; &gt; of just lots and lots of practice to
        improve your dexterity and &gt; &gt; your &gt; &gt; &gt; hand strength.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's just my two cents. I know its the
        piece of advice that no &gt; &gt; &gt; one likes to hear, but at least
        for one handed it is all about &gt; &gt; lots &gt; &gt; &gt; of
        practice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        good. Else I can offer Rubik's Arxon Cube (1980) versions, they are

        now if you have really good speedcubes, ton, i dont know what to do!

        As I stated the Rubiks.com cube are fine if you do not need any special
        tuning. But with a Rubik's Studio you can tune the screws so that all
        faces turns the same. And you can make it stiff or loose and adjust it
        to your technique, after it wears down, you can adjust the screws, this
        is not possible with a Rubiks.com cube. Still the stickers remains a
        problem with the Rubiks.com cube. Ton --- In

        &gt; Without those stickers, they would be fine. Except that they don't
        &gt; have a screw, but I've never had trouble with that. &gt; &gt; ---

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you might know many speedcubers
        uses a Rubiks Studio &gt; cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some great news.
        Rubik's Studio is willing to sell me &gt; the new &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; improved cubes for a low price so that I can offer them
        &gt; via &gt; &gt; &gt; my &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; site &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wwww.speedcubing.com/ton again. This cube will
        be &gt; produce &gt; &gt; &gt; without &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; center caps be glued on! So it will
        not be very hard to &gt; get &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; screws and prepare and tune the
        cubes! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; The price will be about $10 per cube, shipment is $7,50 &gt; world
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wide, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        for 2 to or more it will be $15-$20. As soon as I can &gt; give &gt;
        &gt; &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; details I will offer
        them to you all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to express that the Rubiks.com cube is a
        &gt; fine &gt; &gt; &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you do not need any special tuning. For the Rubik's
        &gt; Studio &gt; &gt; &gt; cubes &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is recommended that you always adjust the
        screws to your &gt; &gt; &gt; liking. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy cubing, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        There is a very simple method that you can solve it with, but not
        quickly. It's basically everyone's method of solving big cubes. You
        first solve all the centers, then the edges, then only twist the outer
        layers and pretend it's a big 3x3x3. There's also probably one here:
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/ But I haven't checked it out.

        All the fastest cubists at 5x5 (with the exception of Akimoto) use the
        centers, pair-up edges, and finish as a 3x3 approach. You can catch the
        parity errors early for the 5x5 since you can judge it by the middle
        edge piece.... this allows for some flexiblity in fixing it, i.e.
        deep-slicing instead of single slices. Many also solve centers in
        opposite pairs, cutting down on piece-seeking. Chris told me he does two
        opposites, then one more and the last three in whatever way's most
        efficent. For these larger cubes, you have a chance to be creative and
        figure out some algorithms and variations of this system yourself. It's
        more fun that way. Oh, and fyi, there is no solution specific to the 5x5
        on the web...., well perhaps Jaap, since he has "everything," but
        probably not too specificly designed. If you solve it enough, you'll
        develop some 5x5 intuition that will greatly improve your times..., when
        I first started doing the 5x5, it took me 35 minutes. Now it takes me
        much less time..., hard to measure since my 5x5 is still very stiff
        (I'll keep you posted). -Doug (taking a layers approach to the 5x5) ---

        I just went through a couple of solves and I noticed that my standard
        grip is to hold the cube with only my thumb and middle finger, with my
        thumb on the F face center and middle finger on the B face center. I
        also delibrately extend my ring finger away from the cube unless I'm
        doing moves with it. This leaves your hands almost always in the
        position to use your index and ring fingers in those kinds of triggers.
        I do know what you mean though in that it seems like only your thumb and
        index finger can do moves, I definitely felt that way as well. Try just
        practicing holding the cube with only your thumb and middle finger, see
        if that helps some. The goal is to hold the cube with as few fingers as
        possible, and turn the faces with as many as possible :) Chris --- In

        stuff I have to agree with Grant in that it &gt; was, &gt; &gt; for me
        at least, just lots and lots and lots of practice. I &gt; started &gt;
        &gt; by just trying to find more efficient ways to do the normal moves,
        &gt; &gt; clockwise and counter clockwise on each face. Then after I
        felt &gt; &gt; comfortable with that I came up with the "finger tricks"
        that I &gt; &gt; mentioned in my last post by simply trying to do moves
        with my &gt; &gt; fingers instead of always alternating
        finger/thumb/finger/thumb. &gt; By &gt; &gt; practicing a lot I also
        noticed that my times got faster simply &gt; &gt; because my hand was
        getting stronger. Also by practicing a lot, &gt; &gt; hence making your
        hand a little stronger, it becomes easier to do &gt; &gt; even more
        kinds of "finger tricks". Then the next step was to &gt; &gt; practice
        each OLL and PLL to find the fastest ways to do each one &gt; &gt; with
        only the use of one hand. That also helped to make sure I &gt; &gt;
        would get "amnesia" less often, a nuisance which still comes up (I &gt;
        &gt; got one handed amnesia for the OLL of my second solve at the WC).
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; guess I decided to put a lot of time into it after
        breaking Matt &gt; &gt; Wilder's time of 48 seconds. I remember thinking
        that it would be &gt; &gt; almost impossible to get that fast, then
        after practicing off and &gt; on &gt; &gt; for a while I finally got it!
        I couldn't believe that I was able &gt; to &gt; &gt; do it, and each
        time I set a new record I always noticed something &gt; &gt; else that I
        could improve on. That started the whole snowball &gt; &gt; effect for
        my times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think it's so much a question of
        inherent dexterity and &gt; &gt; visual spacial skill, at least for one
        handed, but more a question &gt; &gt; of just lots and lots of practice
        to improve your dexterity and &gt; your &gt; &gt; hand strength. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; That's just my two cents. I know its the piece of advice
        that no &gt; &gt; one likes to hear, but at least for one handed it is
        all about &gt; lots &gt; &gt; of practice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris

        Regarding limits, you might be able to get some idea of what is possible
        by doing a little experiment that I posted a while ago. Take a solved
        cube and apply the following mixing alg: F' L B R U B' R' D U R L2 D R
        F2 D R2 L' F D' L U' F' U' B' L2 Solve it over and over, using your
        speedsolving method, as opposed to just doing the mix in reverse. The
        idea is that you will eventually attain the desired state for a good
        solve (no delays between algs, near zero case recognition times, no
        delays of any sort really). While doing multiple solves, you will
        undoubtedly find that you can insert setup moves for later steps while
        completing earlier steps (i.e., assembling an edge corner pair while
        making the cross for F2L method, or inserting an edge or 2 while solving
        corners in corners first). This might simulate a state of mind where you
        are actually doing automatic solves of earlier stages while setting up
        and preparing for later steps. Just for fun, I would like to see what
        times people get with this exercise, especially those who are already
        freakishly fast. At the same time, I realize that this is just a speed
        solve simulation, but it might give some clues as to what ultimate speed
        solving would feel like, and perhaps give us some idea of what the lower
        time limit might be. Lucas

        What a very detailed reply Ryan! Here's where I'm up to at the moment...
        I've learnt several LL edge algs -- ones that mess with the corners
        (which doesn't matter if LL edges are oriented first). I already knew
        several LL edge algs that preserve the corners -- I guess these are
        useful if the corners are already done when you get to the LL. I already
        know the Sune and its mirror (can't imagine there'd be any cuber who
        doesn't know this alg?!). I've learnt the algs for the three LL corner
        orientation positions where 2 are corrent and 2 require twisting. Still
        need to learn the 2 algs for when all 4 require twisting. I'm aiming to
        learn the 13 PLL if my enthusiasm lasts that long. In case it doesn't, I
        planned the order that I would learn the algs. First I revised the algs
        that just move the edges since. I knew U and H, but for some reason was
        a bit iffy with Z. After that, I just ranked them by 'probability of
        occurrence'. So, of the remaining 10, I've memorised the algs with a
        frequency of 1/9 or greater (A, R, J, G). So, 7 down, 6 more to go. I
        think I need to take a break from new algs and spend some time getting
        the newly memorised algs firmly planted in my head. I'm finding that I
        can remember them without a problem, but I'm still taking a bit of time
        recognising the patterns. I'm not concerned though because I know that
        practise will fix this! Jasmine. --- In

        site about a &gt; &gt; beginner method, an intermediate method and an

        has something like this on &gt; &gt; their site? &gt; &gt; I'll describe
        the beginner and intermediate methods that I once used. &gt; They are
        simplications of the Fridrich last layer system. You need to &gt; first
        understand how that system works: &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html#last &gt; &gt; This
        general strategy, orienting first, then permuting, is good because &gt;
        it is very easy to recognise the positions quickly. But instead of &gt;
        orienting all the pieces at once, you just orient the edges first, and
        &gt; the corners second. &gt; &gt; BEGINNER METHOD &gt; &gt; First,
        orient the 4 edges (ie. make a cross). There are only 4 patterns, &gt;
        and one algorithm to solve them all! To view this, you need to use a
        &gt; fixed width font: &gt; &gt; --- --- -x- -x- &gt; -x- xxx xx- xxx
        &gt; --- --- --- -x- &gt; &gt; For each pattern, apply the algorithm
        "R'U'F'U F R" and it will take you &gt; to the next pattern. Eventually
        you will end up with a cross. &gt; &gt; Improvement: notice that if you
        apply the algorithm when you already &gt; have the cross, you will end
        up with a line. That means that you can &gt; jump immediately from the
        2nd pattern to the 4th pattern by applying the &gt; algorithm backwards!
        So, this step should take an average of 6 moves. &gt; &gt; Next, orient
        the corners. There are only 6 patterns apart from solved. &gt; Look
        through this complete list, and find all the patterns (and &gt;
        algorithms) that have a cross already formed: &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/orient.html &gt; &gt; For the
        case when 3 corners need to be twisted, I recommend the Sune TM &gt;
        algorithm from Petrus. See the applet at the top/right of his page: &gt;
        &gt; http://lar5.com/cube/fas6.html &gt; &gt; I think it's useful to
        learn to twist them forwards and backwards: &gt; &gt; - R U R'U R U2 R'
        &gt; - R'U'R U'R'U2 R &gt; &gt; To see that done fast, have a look at
        the quicktime movies at the bottom &gt; of this page: &gt; &gt;
        http://lar5.com/cube/speed.html &gt; &gt; I recommend this algorithm
        because one of the other orientation cases &gt; can be solved by just
        applying this algorithm twice. To know which case &gt; I'm talking
        about, apply this to a solved cube: RU2R'U'RUR'U'RU'R'. &gt; &gt; Now,
        apply the sune (RUR'URU2R') twice: &gt; &gt; RUR'URU2R' + RUR'URU2R'
        &gt; &gt; Notice that the moves in the middle cancel out? So you can
        actually do: &gt; &gt; RUR'URU'R'URU2R' &gt; &gt; which is an "optimal"
        solution. &gt; &gt; Next, permute the corners (yes, before the edges).
        Most of the time &gt; there will be a 3 cycle of corners. In this case,
        look at the 4 sides of &gt; the last layer. On one of the sides, the two
        last layer corners will be &gt; matching in colour. Hold those two
        corners on the back side and do: &gt; &gt; R'FR' B2 RF'R' B2 R2 &gt;
        &gt; Now the corners should be solved. If you don't find any two corners
        that &gt; match, apply the above algorithm and that should result in a
        position &gt; where two corners match. Don't worry, this case rarely
        happens. If you &gt; want, you can learn a special algorithm for that
        case by picking the &gt; most attractive one from: &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html &gt; &gt; The
        "Y" pattern on that page has the desired corner effect. &gt; &gt; Next,
        permute the edges. Again, most of the time, there will be a 3 &gt; cycle
        of edges. You need to learn to cycle the edges forwards and &gt;
        backwards: &gt; &gt; - R2U FB'R2F'BU R2 &gt; - R2U'FB'R2F'BU'R2 &gt;
        &gt; Sometimes, all 4 edges need to be swapped in opposite pairs. That's
        an &gt; easy case, so why not learn it: &gt; &gt; RLU2R'L' [U] R'L'U2RL
        &gt; &gt; The [U] means rotate the whole cube from the up side, 90
        degrees. &gt; &gt; There's also a rare case where all 4 edges need to be
        swapped in &gt; adjacent pairs. The algorithm's difficult so it's not
        worth learning. &gt; &gt; INTERMEDIATE METHOD &gt; &gt; First, orient
        everything like the beginner method. Then permute &gt; everything like
        the full blown Fridrich method. &gt; &gt; How can you learn all the
        permutations? See my previous email: &gt; &gt; c &gt; &gt; There, I list
        which algorithms to learn first, and which algorithms to &gt; learn
        last. &gt; &gt; ADVANCED METHOD &gt; &gt; You already know enough! It is
        not necessary to learn 40 orientation &gt; algorithms. 6 is enough.
        Gilles Roux proved that it is possible to &gt; achieve sub-20 times with
        just these 6 orientation algorithms and 13 &gt; permutation algorithms.
        He used the petrus method for the first two &gt; layers which gives you
        a cross automatically when you get to the last &gt; layer. Using that
        strategy, those extra orientation algorithms are not &gt; needed. &gt;

        there were no "official ladies" at the event other than Christine from
        Seventowns.. Minds were never changed as everything was undecided and
        actually it still is undecided.. but yesterday i received notice from
        seventowns that a local event in europe will occure in 2004 and a major
        event in 2005 will also be on that side of the water... more to come as

        I'm sure we've all noticed that there are many great cubers called Dan
        ... DanK, DanH, DanG... And my friend in New York who I taught in less
        than an hour (no one else I've tried to teach has even made it beyond
        F2L, let alone learnt the whole cube so quickly), his name is Dan as
        well. So anyway, there's a DanH at my work. I told him that everyone
        called Dan is a natural with the cube and that he should give it a go.
        He's also a software engineer -- another very common factor among
        cubers! BTW, I realise this is a pretty silly thing to post, I just
        found it interesting that there are so many Dans. Jasmine.
